3744613,4,B001P9KR94,"Slumdog Millionaire offers an enticingly original presentation of familiar tales by utilizing a flashback system of storytelling that fuses exhilarating adventure with suspenseful drama.  Many of the scenarios created are nothing new, but the fantastical delivery and extraordinary setting undoubtedly provide a refreshing take on more traditional themes.

In a series of flashbacks, Slumdog Millionaire retraces young Jamal Malik's (Dev Patel) life up to his current predicament.  He is a contestant on the Hindi version of ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire"" and, much to the chagrin of the show's producers and arrogant host Prem Kumar (Anil Kapoor), Jamal manages to reach the million dollar question.  But before he can answer, time runs out and he is brought backstage to be violently interrogated by Mumbai's thuggish police.  As Jamal explains how he knew the answer to each of the questions presented, we learn the amazing tale of the youth's turbulent childhood and his undying search for a long lost love.

Slumdog's finest accomplishment lies within a unique method of flashback storytelling that perfectly complements the line of questioning presented during the game show.  As Jamal recounts his adventurous and often dangerous childhood growing up in the slums of Mumbai, we slowly learn the trials and triumphs he has faced and his ultimate reason for competing on the show.  This steady build of characters and settings creates a mesmerizing vehicle that allows the audience to easily ride along with Jamal on his tempestuous journey to face his destiny.

For a cast consisting primarily of child actors and debut performances, the acting is surprisingly strong.  The three main characters are shown at several different stages in their lives and each perfectly complements their previous incarnations.  The children truly steal the show as they face the hardships of growing up in such despondent situations, yet while their innocence is lost their spirits remain unbroken, and Patel, Mittal, and Pinto admirably carry on their legacies to a fateful conclusion.

Slumdog Millionaire presents a recognizably surefire love story that has been seen before. But the process in which it is used - the method of storytelling - is wholly original and genuinely entertaining. A rare setting, a coming of age flashback setup, and wonderfully developed characters make Slumdog Millionaire a winning fantasy of unyielding love. It knows when to provoke emotions through heartache, musically driven segments and ardent drama, and knows how to keep the viewer captured by the beauty of love's destiny.

Watching it is just like hearing an orphan telling about his hardships and struggles on the streets. The violence, the emotions, the realms of a third world country, and the beauty of love regardless of any situation was nicely presented on the movie. It also showed the kind of life the slams of India has - the children, the women, and the heartless adults. The nicest thing that I like about the movie is the light after dark part. That something good is possible when you just don't lose hope. The innocent look and the sad eyes of Dev Patel are perfect for Jamals character. Frieda Pinto is really pretty, just the perfect flower on the movie. The rest of the characters are well-suited. This movies characters must be the well selected Indian actors.",1486339200,,849,4.555555555555555
3744775,4,B001P9KR94,"A gaudy, gorgeous rush of color, sound and motion, ""Slumdog Millionaire"", the latest from the British shape-shifter Danny Boyle, doesn't travel through the lower depths, it giddily bounces from one horror to the next. A modern fairy tale about a pauper angling to become a prince, this sensory blowout largely takes place amid the squalor of Mumbai, India, where lost children and dogs sift through trash so fetid you swear you can swear and smell the discarded mango as well as its peel, or could if the film weren't already hurtling through another picturesque gutter.
What gives me reluctant pause about this bright, cheery, hard-to-resist movie is that its joyfulness feels more like a filmmaker's calculation than an honest cry from the heart about the human spirit. In the past, Mr. Boyle has managed to wring giggles out of murder and addiction, and invest even the apocalypse with a certain joie de vivre. He's a blithely glib entertainer who can dazzle you with technique and, on occasion, blindside you with emotion, as he does in his underrated children's movie, ""millions"". He plucked my heartstrings in ""Slumdog Millionaire"" with well-practiced dexterity, coaxing laughter and sobs out of each sweet, sour and false note.",1486339200,,1234,5.1138613861386135

Would you give money to those kids? If you do, you feed them. If you do, you feed the system that promotes destroying children. Tough call isn't it? ... What about the movie? It is a great plotline/story written at the high point of WWtbaMillionaire phenomenon around the world. From the depths of human filth and abuse, comes the story of three kids and how they overcome in the most unlikely way.

3744837,3,B001P9KR94,"I have mixed feelings about this one, though I have to admit that it's hard to resist the pizzazz of the film-making.  But I find myself agreeing with some of the 2-star reviewers that there's a disjunction between the romantic comedy element in the movie and the acknowledgement of the horrible circumstances out of which the protagonist finds a way.  I want to use the word ""exploitation"" -- I mean, for heaven's sake, a child is blinded in this movie, the protagonist is tortured by the police, and a young girl is coerced into sexual slavery -- and yet the two lovers, Jamal (Dev Patel) and Lakita (Freida Pinto), seem implausibly untraumatized at the end of it all.  I saw Kurosawa's ""Red Beard"" recently, and the trauma of the young girl who is saved from prostitution in that movie seems much more plausible.  And when you consider too that sheer luck gets Jamal as far as he does in a game show, then you realize that maybe we're in ""Forrest Gump"" territory -- but that was a satire (wasn't it?).  So how does the director, Danny Boyle, get us past all the horrors?  Partly it's that Patel and Pinto are very appealing young people, and they're soulful here -- and credit too to the younger actors who portray the protagonists' younger selves.  And then Boyle pulls off the remarkable feat of getting the heart of the story told in flashbacks, and where that technique might seem to slow things down, in this movie the pace is kept up and the camerawork is always alive.  But it's an escape and an escapist fantasy, and in the very last scene -- a big dance number in a railway station -- just seems to confirm that: we're here to entertain you!  But I can't forget the blinded child even at the moment when the movie says, ""I'm entertainment.""",1481155200,,1752,4.536507936507936

3744859,5,B001P9KR94,"Released in 2008 and directed by Danny Boyle & Loveleen Tandan, Slumdog Millionaire is a drama/adventure about two orphaned brothers & a girl growing up in the slums of Mumbai, India. The story is framed through the television show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? Where one of the brothers, Jamal (Dev Patel), is a contestant. Madhur Mittal appears as Jamals brother, Salim, who resorts to crime while Freida Pinto plays, Latika, the girl Jamal loves.

If you're not used to the horrors of overpopulation and poverty in modern India you're in for a culture shock as this movie shows India in all its glory and shame. A friend of mine lives in Hyderabad and he regularly sends me pics of orphaned kids living on garbage, etc., just like in the movie; of course he does his small part to try to save them.

The big question of the film is: How does Jamal, a teen who grew up in one of the worst slums on earth, possibly know the answers to the questions on the TV show? The charismatic-but-somewhat-sinister host (Anil Kapoor) thinks its dubious, so he delivers Jamal over to a detective (Irrfan Khan) and his cronies (Saurabh Shukla) to find out how hes cheating. If Jamals not cheating then how does he know the answers? The movie shows you.

This is a hip, kinetic film with a potent message that you might not fully grasp upon your first viewing. Pay close attention to the interrogation & conclusions of the detective. Notice Jamals integrity, persevering faith and idealist love for Latika. Faith, hope and love conquer all.

The film runs 120 minutes and was shot in Mumbai and Uttar Pradesh, India.

3745041,5,B001P9KR94,"An unimaginable RollerCoaster ride from the squalor of a Mumbai slum to a completely believable  realization of the most profound longing of all of us.
  Being an old gringo who has never had personal contact with Hindi folks or visited India, I got connected via Bollywood. I am a high end home audio professional and my first attraction, besides the stunning actresses, was the really artful make use of surround sound and the engaging musical arrangements. That said, I first chased my way through the make believe world of the musical romantic comedies. Searching for more, I ran into some of the real gritty and honest views of life in India. They can leave you emotionally drained with the full complement of guilt, sympathy and a profound respect for the strength of the Human spirit.
  This film is an amazing example of demonstrating the best and worst of what we can be. Nothing is held back. Against the vivd images of life in the squalor and horror of life in almost unlivable conditions, we are graphically shown the very best and worst of what we can be. We are reminded of the seemingly limitless optimism of children.
  You will find it very hard to avoid becoming completely immersed emotionally in this film. As gritty and horrifying as it becomes, the depth of character and spirit of selfless devotion will overshadow everything else.
  Just reviewing my emotional extremes as I took this ride, I am still amazed. When I watched it the fourth or fifth time I started looking for flaws in the characters and progress of the action or even the ending. A movie about making enough money to take you to a living Disneyland is never about the money or the Disneyland dream life that it would buy. That is just the common denominator carrot that draws you into the so much bigger story of a child's dreams and if you get a chance to step back from the torrent of emotion that you are assailed with, you get to see how dangerous the money and what it brings with it are. I guess I never really sat down and analyzed just how much this movie had to say or how much insight is revealed. Just stunning.",1459641600,12,2112,4.5661375661375665

The acting is excellent and believable, and the the many scenes of hardship, poverty, and crime provide a proper canvas for this tale.  There is a lot of empathy felt the 2 main protagonists here.  Ultimately, true love reigns supreme, which also makes it a 'feel good' movie.

3745140,5,B001P9KR94,"Slumdog Millionaire

Slumdog Millionaire is not what I expected it to be and is like nothing I have ever seen before.  I expected to see brilliant tropical colors and I expected to hear exotic music in the sound track.  I got both.  I was not expecting to see the protagonist-played by handsome young Dev Patel-having the truth beat out of him by angry Indian policemen.  The torture of the young contestant on a TV game show provides the frame for the tale of the life of the young man, the Slumdog of the title.
 What results is a journey into the horrid underside of Indian society.  We find out about Indian gang lords and the most horrific exploitation of children.  These children are quite literally thrown onto the garbage heap of Mumbai.  Keep in mind that horror compounds horror to the beat of peppy Hindi pop music, everything filmed in the beautiful visual feast that makes up the Indian color palette.
 Director Danny Boyle has made his reputation with this amazing film.  He will now be joined in conversation with the very best directors in the century of film making.  Bravo.  Co-star Freida Pinto preformed her action assignments-she was tasked to be beautiful and be in danger-with room to spare.  Patel played his role with steady stoicism, as fit the character.
 Slumdog Millionaire is rated R-in Indian film there is no nudity or foul language, the deserved rating is for violence and theme.  It has plucked a bouquet of 10 academy award nominations from the Academy of Motion Pictures.  This gripping, horrifying, engaging and brilliant film gets a stellar four and a half saw blades.
 In spite of the horrid events depicted in the film, I went away from the experience feeling quite happy and uplifted.  This is a remarkable movie, go see it.",1443657600,,1766,4.75

3745152,4,B001P9KR94,"'Slumdog Millionaire' is a recent Academy Award winning film, directed by Danny Boyle. It's famously based upon the book 'Q & A', written by Vikas Swarup, though Simon Beaufoy wrote the movie script.

Framed by questioning in a police station & on the TV show 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire?', the story follows Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) thru his life. He is a slumdog, having spent his earliest years in a ramshackle community located near Mumbai's airport. His older brother Selim is perpetually on the make, to the point of selling Jamal's prized autograph of Bollywood star Amitab Ghosh. One day their community of Muslims is attacked by Hindus, who kill Jamal's mother.

The night of the attack, they meet Latika (Freida Pinto), who is also an orphan. Soon the 3 of them are taken in by Maman (Ankur Vikal), who, under the guise of running an orphanage, is actually exploiting his charges..The brothers soon escape, leaving Latika behind. But Jamal desperately misses her, & spends the next few years searching for her.

Shot primarily in India, 'Slumdog Millionaire' also has the audacity to have the younger Selim & Jamal speak only Hindi; by the time they're teenagers they have picked up pidgin English. The performances are uniformly strong. So strong,in fact, that I decided to check out the book the movie is based upon.

Reading through 'Q & A', I was amazed how DIFFERENT it is to 'Slumdog Millionaire'. Not even the names are the same! 'Jamal' is 'Ram Mohammed Thomas'. 'Selim' isn't the elder brother, he's Ram Mohammed's best friend. 'Latika' doesn't appear in the book at all; her place is given to 'Sita', a prostitute.

The biggest difference of all lies in the reason Ram Mohammed/Jamal competes on the TV show. First off, the title of the show: in the book it's 'Who Wants to Win a Billion?'. 'Q & A' posits revenge against the host as Ram Mohammed's motivation for being on the show; in the film it's because he's desperately trying to find Latika, who has disappeared. In both storylines he's arrested. The book has the show's producers worried sick because they don't HAVE a billion rupees, while 'Slumdog Millionaire' puts the blame of suspicion of cheating.

While Swarup's book is enjoyable, it has almost nothing in common with Boyle's film. Having re-watched my DVD a number of times prior to reading 'Q & A', I have to say I definitely prefer the movie. Does that make me shallow? Or a populist?

Do purchase the DVD or digital download of 'Slumdog Millionaire'. You won't regret it!",1440720000,,2512,4.800925925925926

3745228,5,B001P9KR94,"When Slumdog first came out, I found the realities of its characters' lives so painful and depressing that even the happy ending couldn't make up for the way the movie as a whole made me feel.  The one saving grace for me was the closing credit sequence, one of the best movie postscripts of all time.  I've been playing that sequence on YouTube for a while now, and I finally decided to give the movie another look.  Well, I was wrong.  Its faith in humanity and love is ultimately what's most powerful, all the more so given what the characters endure.  I guess I wasn't prepared for it the first time.  Oh, and that ending is still fantastic.  It's turned me on to Bollywood musicals.  ""Jai Ho,"" the closing song of Slumdog, does something only the songs of Stevie Wonder in this country have been able to do -- express not merely happiness, but the euphoria of sheer joy.",1425600000,,875,4.459119496855346

I could literally not turn away from the screen from the first scene of the game show to the movie's ending with the entertaining dance sequence...

I still don't know what is it that made this movie so highly recommended.  I did not think the acting was that extraordinary, and the story takes us no where with a very strong sense of predestination and hopelessly fatalistic.  I do not recommend the movie, I cannot find any instance when this could be either motivating, entertaining or fun, or much less educational because I miss the positive message (if any).",1420070400,2,547,4.551020408163265

3745328,4,B001P9KR94,"The images in this film will remain with you for life.  It is an amazing story and very original in it's portrayal. This film shows two brothers who grew up in the same exact circumstances, but one takes the path of material wealth while the other is more interested in the spiritual wealth of love.  I did however have some issues with the script.  Some spoilers: Mainly with the character of Salim, Jamal's older brother.  His portrayal seemed to be lacking in the film and at times a bit confusing.  We see from the start that he is a torn individual.  On the one hand he loves his brother very much, but on the other hand he is a hot head and a bully who wants to control those around him making him a conflicted and rich character.  However it's hard to understand why Jamil continues to trust him throughout the film even after he rapes Latika and even after he kidnaps Latika at the train station. It gets even more confusing when Latika seems to care about Salim when he tries to reunite her with Jamal at the end, worried that his boss will kill him.  The movie doesn't explain at all why these characters continue to place their hearts with Salim after everything he's already done to them.  And the only indication we get from the film that Salim has doubts about his behavior is a couple of lines where he prays to allah that he knows he has sinned and where he says ""I know"" after Jamal says he'll never forgive him... but this happens also before he kidnaps Latika from the train station and scars her face for life.  I think Salim's character would've had more impact if we were able to truly see his moral struggle which was difficult to detect.  After all this is a man who was grappling so much with his guilt that he chose to kill himself in a tub of all the dirty money he helped aquire over the years.  We should've seen the signs of this immense struggle that led him to do this and I don't feel that we really did.  Another problem is the issue with Salim's cell phone.  He gives Latika his cell phone obviously because he feels Jamal will call him for some reason. How could he be so sure that Jamal would call him after everything he had done?  Then at the end Jamal does not know how to reach Latika so he waits for her at the train station hoping she'll show up.  But wait-  Doesn't she have Salim's phone?  So why doesn't Jamal just call her up instead?  These issues were what kept me from giving this amazing story 5 stars. Still, the movie is unforgettable and will leave a permanent imprint in your mind.",1408752000,2,2536,4.323467230443975

3745345,5,B001P9KR94,"Slumdog Millionaire is opens with a scene wherein a Mumbai teen named Jamal Malik,who grew up in the slums,becomes a contestant on the Indian version of ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?"".He is one question away from winning the grand prize of 20 million Rupees. What will happen next? How did he manage to get into the final question despite the fact that he is far from someone who has received lots of education? Later,more scenes intrigue the viewers as he is subjected to police questioning with allegations to cheating. As Jamal gets interrogated especially when asked to how did he know the answers to the questions,events from his life history are shown in flashback from his days to the slums at the Taj Mahal up to the point wherein he is as an employee of XL5 Mobile Phones at present.

This was a hypnotic view from the beginning to end. We are intrigued about Jamal and cheer for him from the start just like we usually care for the usual underdog protagonist in every film that we see. It is also worth noting that Dev Patel provides great performance as the older Jamal as he is able so solicit our empathy and care for his character. As for the story,filmmakers did a wonderful job of making it look realistic and plausible. If one is feeling down with regards to how he/she has been treated in life or has been experiencing not-so-good situations,this movie can provide some hope as it gives them the realization that everything happens for a reason in life. Added to that,it also makes us appreciate the events that happen to us whether simple and memorable. Indeed,Slumdog teaches us the value of day-to-day living.",1407801600,,1632,4.686411149825784

It was only in the final moments of the story that we get a glimpse into his depth of character and his ability to care about and search out through impossible obstacles the person for whom he felt responsibility, concern, emotional attachment and love. The game show venue and base for the story telling was brilliant.  While nearly everyone was drawn in to believing it was about the money, his disdain for the money was evident to very few. In the final scenes, the game show must have had a 100% share of market for the final show.  But it wasn't about the money at all but the victory of one of their own, a slum-dog, that captured the imaginations of a unified but extremely diverse people.

I was there in the Seventies, and was astounded many times by the maimed, blind , twisted people on the street who had been ""prepared for life"" to be more successful at begging by parents and agents who knew that sympathetic givers are more likely to give more. The boys in this movie are good examples of the need in those years to learn to hustle, especially if they were normal. Intelligence can be measured by the ability to survive, and the quick mind of the hero is all he has to keep himself alive. It pays off in many ways.

I began watching the movie and instantly fell in love with the visuals and angles that were applied throughout the opening scene. The writer did an amazing job and telling the story without giving the viewer any confusion. The story was easy to get into and you quickly begin to develop your own love / hate opinions with the characters. Since you see the main characters develop through childhood you get easily attached and hope everything plays out for everyone. I do not want to give spoilers in this review but I will recommend to anyone seeking a movie with a little adventure and a well executed story.  This movie by far lived up to the expectations I had set and its gripping story about a boy just trying to survive is amazing.

I find the first 80% flat-out magnificent; Dickens set in India, as a street urchin spins his horrifying tale, intercut with his unlikely success on India's version of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"" The ending is a bit more Hollywood than indie, but even if it could be accused of being manipulative, it did make me cry. There's an honest sweetness, bravery and energy to the film-making and acting that's endlessly infectious.",1381017600,3,581,4.752475247524752

3745528,4,B001P9KR94,"The movie is centered on the lives of three primary characters with the two brothers at the focal point.  The youngest brother, Jamal, has just finished his first day of taping for India's version of ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire.""  He has been detained by police and tortured in order to discover how he has cheated on the game show as no kid from the slum such as himself should know all of the answers thus far to the questions.  As the movie progresses it cuts between scenes of the current time with him in the police station and scenes of himself as he ages from childhood through early adulthood.  The second story line to the movie is Jamal's love for Latika.  It shows his dedication to finding and saving the girl that he feels a deep connection with.  Without directly comparing the two, I would dare say that it is similar to the Forrest Gump/Jenny connection where the boy fawns for the girl throughout life and even with nearly insurmountable odds; the two finally find love in each other's arms.

This was not one of those generic mega blockbuster titles where the background stories of the characters are left out and the time is filled with high dollar CGI effects and A-list stars. I felt that the movie gave a true identity to each of the main characters along with a majority of the supporting actors.  The movie was well written and masterfully intertwined the emotions of growing up in the slums with nothing but despair around and the glorious feeling of love and thus the journey in pursuit of.

Religion did not play a major role in this movie yet it touched on it enough to show that strife is found between people of different beliefs.  The brothers were presumed to have lost their mother at a young age due her Muslim faith; it is presumed that she died at the hands of the Hindu's.  A portion of the movie includes the Taj Mahal and shows the reverence that people even internationally hold for this holy place.  The young street beggars at times express their blessing upon those who toss them charity.

Overall this is a great one to watch when you want a break from the typical movie.  It will probably surprise you and leave you with a positive feeling at the end of the roller coaster emotional ride.",1379894400,,2236,4.516129032258065
3745529,4,B001P9KR94,"Slumdog Millionaire is a fantastic movie! It is about a young man, Jamal, who goes on the hit show in India, ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire"", in hopes that his long, lost love, Latika, is watching. Jamal is an uneducated boy from the slums so the country is shocked when he makes it all the way to the final question. Then, the show runs out of time and on his way out Jamal is taken and interrogated by authorities. They are convinced that he has to be cheating and demand answers. Jamal begins to explain how he knew all the answers and tells about how each question is a unique memory to him. His older brother, Salim, and him considered themselves the ""two musketeers"" when they were younger, and were rather mischievous. After witnessing their mother being killed in an anti-Muslim raid, they escape the city, Mumbai, meeting Latika, a young girl orphaned in the raid also. Salim is resistant on letting her hang around, but Jamal insists that she become part of their group. The threesome runs into a local gangster who provides poor children with food and shelter but exploits them by making them beg and sing for money. The gangsters are about to make Jamal blind (because blind singers earn more) when Salim grabs him and they run away. Jamal and Salim jump on a passing train with Latika close behind them but Salim lets go of her hand. From then on, Jamal is compelled to find her and make it up to her. Salim falls in with a local gang while Jamal lives a more honest life, working as an assistant at a call center. He rescues Latika a couple times but always ends up losing her. In the end he wins the money and the girl. It's such as sweet movie.

I was hesitant about seeing this movie when it first came out because it didn't look like it would be good from the previews. However, I decided to watch it when I saw it on the required movie list for my World Religion class. The whole time I was watching it I kept thinking, ""I should have watched this sooner!"" This movie ties in pretty well with the World Religions class. There is portrayal of the Indian caste system, which we have learned about, and the Hindu god, Lord Rama. Even though it was listed under the ""Hindu"" section of the list, I found it to be rather anti-Hindu. Jamal and Salim are Muslims and are victims of a raid led by the Hindus. Also, there is no mention of Karma, a large part of the Hindu religion. In fact the focus of the movie is on destiny or a divine plan, instead of Karma, which is commonly found in Christianity. There seemed to be links to multiple religions in this movie and therefore I think it relates pretty well to our class, where we are learning about multiple religions. Overall, it was a great movie. It sparked every emotion and kept me on the edge of my seat.",1379894400,,2772,4.372093023255814

From the stifling heat and grinding poverty to the neon lit opulence of modern day (Bombay); after watching this film I almost felt like I had taken a tour of the country.

The cast is excellent, I found the female star to be a darkly beautiful gem worthy of pining for; the lead actors charismatic enough to draw the audiences's alliegiance at every age of the protagonist.

The movie is hard to watch sometimes because of the criminal underground's exploitation of children. However, real life isn't always pretty and this topic is worth visiting.

3745586,1,B001P9KR94,"Let me begin by saying simply- ""I did not like this film at all"". But let me explain why. The film runs not only in constant flashback segments, but it also has a fractured and fragmented style of editing that was both confusing and art house experimental in style. The entire film seemed confused with it's self and what it was trying to present it's self as. For instance, when MIA's excellent track 'Paper Planes' was thrown into a scene, the film took a direction that felt like an experimental music video, tourist commercial, or some kind of low budget after school special. The film uses jolty and dizzying camera angles sometimes, and then other moments those camera techniques are dismissed in favor of more traditional ones. Our main characters are supposed to feel to us like tortured children who are caught in great exploitation and misfortune, yet when the audience might just begin to feel concerned about them they become deceptive thieves who would go as far to commit murder. I also felt it was not very appealing to showcase India's government officials as those who would commit torture on one of their citizens simply because he won a vast amount of money on a game show. That to me was rediculous. To add insult to injury the film is filled with constant depressing landscapes and violent moments, and much of the comic relief was bizzare and over the top. In my opinion this film contains nothing that should garner it even a single academy award nomination, much less a best picture nod. What happened to the great hollywood films that once deserved and won the oscars? Why didn't 'Milk', a powerful and important film win the best picture oscar instead of this mess? yes I truly did not like this movie at all.",1367971200,5,1735,4.691803278688525

Slumdog Millionaire
Review

By Richard E. Noble

This movie is touted as ""the feel good movie of the year."" Anybody who watched this movie and left feeling good about it, in my opinion, is lacking in something vital to their social conscience.

I don't know what the creators' intentions were with this film but I will certainly not be planning my next getaway vacation to India.

After watching this movie, I am left feeling much as I did after watching the movie, ""Midnight Express."" I was happy for the man's release from the Turkish prison in Midnight Express, just as I am happy for the two slumdogs who are the protagonists in this movie.

I definitely think this movie warrants praise and it deserves any awards that have been accorded to it but it certainly didn't make me feel good. It made me feel very, very bad.

A slumdog appears to be India's modern day equivalent to what was once referred to in that culture as ""Untouchables."" The word ""slumdog"" is, of course, meant to be derogatory. An English equivalent might be dirtbag or scumbag.

India once suffered under what was called a caste system and it appears from this movie that they still do.

Supposedly this caste system belief is a part of the Hindu religion and its notion of reincarnation and Karma. It is a system of social stratification and a person's karma,
his behavior in his previous lives, determines his position in his present life.

The karma of certain people is so bad that they are placed in a caste not included in even the lowest caste of the caste system.

They are the Untouchables or the Dolits.

I remember reading about the horrid lives of these poor Untouchables decades ago.
I thought Dickens' ""Oliver Twist"" was a horror story until I began reading about the real lives of the Untouchables in the non-fiction Indian culture.

These people lived in garbage dumps and scavenged and begged for their survival. The parents in these families would cripple, maim and blind their children so as to make them better beggars and increase their beggary dividends.

If I can believe this movie, it does not appear that much has changed in the Indian culture of today. I think it was George Orwell who stated, in his trekking India travelogue, that India would never become a great country because of its Hindu beliefs and the Hindu acceptance of fate and destiny and consequently poverty and social injustice and inequality. Considering the impressions left by this movie, I think he makes a good point.

This movie undermines all that I have been reading lately about the new India and the social progress it has been making over the past few decades.

That there are people living in India today who are boasting that they will soon be the leading economic culture in the world boggles my imagination. Much worse than that is the notion that if this actually were to be the case, the picture of the future that this film paints for the world is bleak indeed.

On the surface this is a love story. But unfortunately the moral, only revealed at the conclusion of the movie is one from that old time religion based on the Hindu notion of karma, destiny and fate.

So it seems that the Hindu caste system and the faith that spawned it are still alive and well in modern day India - at least according to this movie.

The male hero's mother is murdered as she washes her clothes in some filthy pool of water. Her murder is not explained other than it had something to do with rivaling religious fanatics.

The two sons are now orphaned slumdogs. They are captured by a Faganesque, drug dealing gangster. He tortures, maims and brutalizes his captives to keep them in line and enhance their beggary. The two brothers and the younger brother's little girlfriend attempt an escape before the younger boy is blinded by his tortures.

The boys escape but the little girl does not catch the train and remains with the drug dealing gangster and his gang of cutthroats. The remainder of this tale centers on this couple's reunification.

Somehow mixed in here in this slum ridden, horror show of a country, a modern day TV program is incorporated into the film. As hard as it is to believe, the younger brother has matured and is a contestant on the TV show, an Indian version of ""Who wants to be a millionaire.""

The show ends in a Michael Jackson type dance celebration and production extravaganza.

As I said in the beginning of this review, I do not know the real intentions of the creators of this film but they left a huge impression on me.

Unfortunately that impression is extremely negative.

At one point in the movie, one of the characters says to somebody,
""Well, you wanted to see a true picture of the real India, didn't you?""

My god! Thank-you very much but I've seen enough of the ""real"" India to last me a good while.

3745620,5,B001P9KR94,"SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE has it all: a strong, focused storyline; fine acting by all (but especially those who play the central characters); ultra-sharp cinematography that captures Mumbai and much of the rest of India with captivating immediacy; and strong human interest elements that should appeal to people the world over. In the end, however, it's not any one of these elements or even the combination of them that makes this film what it is. SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE just has that inscrutable ""something about it"" that makes it a true stand-out.

Although it's often described as a ""feel-good"" movie, SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE also gives a starkly realistic portrait of the Mumbai slums, showing how life there (and any hope for something better) is left both to the individual and to chance. The themes of karma and destiny support the plot beautifully--the way Jamal faces and ulimately prevails against overwhelming odds is riveting. It's both funny and grim, admirably meshing these two qualities: a true tragi-comedy.

The one little caveat I might offer is that SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE is a two-hour epic (and for some reason, seemed longer to me) that verges on being overwhelming. While it never plods, it's a story that demands patient attention and should be viewed by those who are ready to give it.",1361664000,2,1296,5.1084905660377355

The acting was great and is not a predictable movie.

This is definitely a must watch movie.",1360108800,2,403,4.10126582278481
3745625,4,B001P9KR94,"I enjoyed this movie, but it's really hard to explain why I like it. Verious plot holes for this movie have been explained to me and I have to agree with a good amount of them or respect that point of view. So here's what I enjoyed about it. The movie is pretty good at giving a sense you are in India, in that parts of the movie feel as if this is indeed a less developed country, and as the movie progress you see skyscrapers and some western elements. I feel India is justly represented in that way.

The characters are pretty nice as I get reactions from the acting. I feel like laughing in the right spots, I feel terrified or hurt correctly and get very powerful moments in many spots be it good or bad moments. The way the flashbacks explain both Jamal's life and the answer to MOST OF THE QUESTIONS, was pretty well done, it was an engaging story and pretty interesting to see how someone of low (sorry) education learns interesting trvia.

How the movie played out, mostly was interesting and pleasant to view(minus the issues discussed below) and I felt it was a good two hours. It was a movie that made me feel good, reminds me of the older movies where everyone works out in a good way and you have a love story that, although doesn't have much behind it, you know will work and you enjoy.

Now problems with the movie... I have been pointed out many legit problems and remembering the movie I have to agree with some. First it is possible to argue most of the plot is contrived and most stuff happens only because it needs to (though I THINK you can say that for most fiction book/movie/tv). Some flashbacks don't provide the answer to the questions, and some questions are edited out. The studio side's opinion is not shown well and Jamal gets brought back without any real conclusion reached (unless the host or producers just decided to believe him without seeing him talk to them). Also I've heard the argument that maybe Jamal shouldn't have won as since Latika is free, their love would've been enough for them. Some ways I think it would've been better others I don't.

So I still like the movie, but regonize problems with it and wish bitts could be added to solve them. And as the beginning stated, the reasons I like it, only work for me and can just as easily have not worked for haters of this film. But I'm getting this in my collection no doubt.",1359590400,,2372,4.384090909090909

3745627,4,B001P9KR94,"This movie is about an  18 year old from the slums where we meet Jamal Malik, a chai wallah  at an Indian based call center, he's in the hot seat on the game show Who Wants to be a Millionaire?. As his winnings pile up the show's host, Prem  Kumar , seems quite skeptical over the fact this  teen is answering so many questions correctly. He's now just one question away from winning 20 million rupees and Kumar doesn't understand how this kid from the slums is pulling it off. Through a series of flashbacks, we learn about Jamal's hard life in the slums with his older brother, how he lost his mother at a young age, and about the girl he's always believed he's meant to be with  the beautiful Latika. Because each question relates to a specific chapter in his past  from dealing with gangs to a run in with a ruthless gangster  Jamal's life experience prepared him to win on this game show. It's as if he's fated to be on Millionaire.

I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a movie that shows that anything is possible no matter where you come from and have to deal with in life.",1359244800,,1094,4.276699029126213

3745635,4,B001P9KR94,"This is a delightful and exhilarating film that combines all of the pathos and excitement and over-the-top emotional resonance of classical Hollywood-style romances with a dark and gritty portrayal of life on the streets of India, all filmed in an excitingly kinetic style that combines different kinds of footage to create a hyperreal Mumbai.

It is endlessly diverting, constantly surprising and yet consistent. The inventive camera movements don't so much call attention to the director as they capture a complex and confusing reality into which impoverished Indian teen Jamal Malik has been thrown.

The telling of the story is both remarkably simple and highly effective: Jamal Malik has gone further than anyone on the Indian version of ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?""  Since he is a ""slumdog"" from Mumbai, the authorities assume he must be cheating and interrogate him harshly in order to extract a confession.  Instead, he begins to relate incidents from his harrowing life that explain exactly how he came to know each answer.  His real interest in being on the show, it turns out, is not to become wealthy but to reconnect with a lost childhood friend Latika.

One very refreshing element of this film is that instead of making coincidence a liability -- all romantic dramas employ coincidence in order to increase the tension and excitement -- the filmmakers build the entire premise around the possibility that fate can determine a life and can bring lost loves together.  I was also impressed by the way the film paid homage to numerous traditions of filmmaking, but mostly to Bollywood cinema -- even including an exhuberant musical number.  One thing I hope for this film, in fact, is that it may serve to introduce more Western audiences to Bollywood film (many of the actors here are popular in Bollywood) and prepare them for the many delights that can be found there.",1357257600,,2365,6.0148809523809526

3745658,4,B001P9KR94,"Slumdog Millionaire (2008) is a very good movie with the astounding cinematography, virtuoso directing, and the heartbreaking yet optimistic story. The acting by three main characters especially by a newcomer, Dev Patel, is compelling. Patel plays a street kid Jamal Malik (Patel), an 18 year-old orphan from the slums of Mumbai, who made it to the Indian version of the TV show Who wants to be a millionaire?"" and keeps answering correctly every question. The secret is that every question represents a chapter of his own life, his growing up and surviving on the streets, his adventures and experiences often dramatic and even tragic. When he is just one question away from winning 20 million rupees (around $450,000), the time is up, and millions of TV-viewers who root for Jamal would have to wait for the following night to see him go for the big prize. Jamal is arrested by the police right after the game and he will spend the next day been rather brutally interrogated by police officers who want to find out how the street boy with no education can answer the difficult questions correctly. Fifteen years from the lives of Jamal, his older brother Salem and another orphan from the slums of Mumbai, ""the third musketeer"", the girl named Latika (Frieda Pinto), Jamal's true love since their childhood will reveal in flashbacks, and by the end of Jamal's story, it won't surprise us why he knows all answers. IMO, the only weak point in the story was the big 20 million rupees question. I won't reveal it but trust me, the whole reading or movie watching world knows the answer, and the question was too easy for such high stake BUT it fits the story very well, so I tend to be lenient.

The best part of the movie is IMO the look at India from within, the glorious views of India's beauty and horrifying captures of its unspeakable poverty, from the slums of Mumbai and the dizzyingly crowded streets of Bombay to the heavenly magnificent Taj Mahal.

Boyle's directing very much reminds Fernando Meirelles inspiring movie-making in Cidade de Deus aka City of God by its dynamism, fast and furious camera movements, and amazingly deep and compassionate understanding of the material",1342310400,,2189,4.819148936170213

3745681,4,B001P9KR94,"OK, it's a good movie. Maybe not quite as fabulously great as the hype about it, but it's good.

Jamal is a Mumbai street kid along with his brother Salim. Although Salim is reluctant, they rescue a little girl named Latika. The ways in which they get used, abused and exploited are depressing, but they are smart, resourceful and courageous. They get separated, for which Jamal blames Salim (justifiably), and Latika is taken over by a brutal SOB who just happens to be Salim's employer.

But Jamal never gave up on finding her. In fact, he says at one point that he went on the TV show ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"" mostly because he figured she would be watching. He knows the answers to the questions, much to everyone's surprise because he is supposedly uneducated and ignorant. But he has a superb memory, and in a series of flashbacks, he explains to a policeman who is trying to charge him with cheating how he knew the answer to each question. Does he know the answer to the last one, for a prize of 20 million rupees? Is Latika watching? Will they get back together at last?

This film is a triumph. It is the perfect love story that follows a man and a woman from when they met as children to when they were reunited as adults, after a long list of tragedies happens to them both. It never fails to choke me up by the end. My favourite part, after they reunite in the end, is the Bollywood dance to ""Jai Ho"".

The cinematography in this film is so unique and I really enjoyed it. As far as the DVD itself goes, I couldn't be happier.

3745686,5,B001P9KR94,"The script is absolutely original to me. My family members and I were puzzled for the first 15 minutes of the screen. We were glued to the screen in order to find out why a non-educated orphan could answer correctly all the questions in Who Wants to Be a Millionaire show.

The scenes of the answers to the last 2 questions are full of twists and suspense. One example is the moment when Jamal phoned his brother for the answer of the last question.

The movie graphically and convincingly shows how determined Jamal was in order to get what he wanted. For example, he jumped into a pile of human waste that was higher than he in order to see his movie star in person.

The scene where the bad guys scooped out the eye of the street kid had some truth in it. Some of my friends from a third world country said something like that did happen in their homeland. There were some gangs that kidnapped children. Then they twisted their arms to make them disabled. Then they forced those kids to beg for money from spectators.

Besides all the reasons above, this movie makes people happy and hopeful with its happy ending. I believe that's one of the reasons why many people love it. No wonder it won 6 Oscar prizes in 2009. They included best picture, best adapted screenplay, best directing, best editing, best sound mixing, and best original score (According to Oscars dot org site.)

3745708,4,B001P9KR94,"I just got around to watching this.  It was very good, although only worth watching once.  This was a clear attempt to explore the Indians and their culture.  Years ago, they attempted a ""latin fever"" in order to sell people on that.  However, that was just a forced-fed fad that only lasted a year.

East Indians are a very private and somewhat mysterious group.  They tend to keep to themselves, are usually highly educated (via books only), amass great wealth (which they keep on the low) and their numbers and wealth continues to increase, at least in the US.  Like all groups who were not known - seen, but not heard, Indians want to finally become visible.  So-called ""latin"" culture like East Indian cultures can never become an attractive sell to western audiences.  While you can take a little of this and a little of that, most of it is unattractive in many ways.

With films like this and many Indians doing film and TV, it appears as if they would like to come out of their shells.  This happens when groups gain wealth and status within another society.  At first you just want to live, then you want to live well, then after you live well you want to be credited with living well!  This is good and I cannot knock the Indian commitment to education (on the books) and plans to gain and KEEP wealth, as it has more than worked.  They need to share some plans with African-Americans instead of being so secretive.

So now, films like this and other TV and films help to shine light on East Indians - albeit in a European light, as opposed to an untouched version of Indians, which brings me to my next observation about the film.  First, it is no shocker that India started out black and then was invaded by white or white-like peoples referred to as Aryans and now called Hindus.  These people imposed an apartheid system in India thus keeping the blacks on the bottom and the white-like people at the top.  It has been that way it is still that way, although the more mixed ones move up since the top is getting darker.  Then you had the British and their racist ways which follows the Indian until this day.

So, now my observations...  There are two brothers.  One is darker and one is lighter.  One (the darker one, Salim) has African type facial features and curly hair and the other has a narrower nose with straight hair.  From the start, Salim is more aggressive, heartless, greedy, selfish and not concerned with education.  The other brother is calm, caring, selfless, loving and cares about people.  It COULD be a coincidence that the lighter one is essentially ""good"" while the darker one is essentially ""bad,"" but I am sure someone will argue against it.

As the film progresses, Salim becomes more embroiled in ""thug life"" and gangsta life while the other is always calm and loving and cares about the world around him.  Salim is ALWAYS thinking about crime, sex and drugs.  His hair also becomes more curled as the film goes on too!  Of course, Salim had to rape Latika while the other brother wanted love!  So, you throw in drugs, aggression, rape, crime, dark skin, African features AND curled hair - I am left with no choice but to think that this character was designed to emulate or give the audience thoughts about an African-American stereotype of criminality as opposed to an Indian.  The other brother (lighter with STRAIGHT hair) is shown to embody the righteousness in Indians.

I could be wrong (I doubt it), but if they are brothers, how both of their hair was not curled of straight?  How come the brothers features were not consistent?  I just thought I'd point this out as this is another trick in Hollywood and Indian films.  I have noticed in Indian themed films, they seem to do what they can to separate themselves from the black family and unite with the whites.  Let's see...  There was ""Bend it Like Beckham"" where light-brown Indians were cast to contrast the very dark African or Jamaican in the film.  Of course they had to mention that ""those"" people are black while not mentioning their own blackness.  Instead, they act is if the whites are their people!  That casting was done on purpose.  Then you had Mississippi Masala with Denzel Washington.  He was darker than the Indians although they get much darker than he does.  It was to make the people ""called"" blacks appear to be black and separate from others in the black family.  In fact, I cannot think of any film where there are Indians and African type blacks where the Indians are shown as darker than the ""blacks.""  This is clear propaganda.

Aside from that social commentary, it was a good film.  I just do not understand why the light brother stayed in love with the girl all of those years.  You mean to tell me that he did not have sex since she first left?  If he had, he would not have kept thinking about her.",1313280000,2,4832,4.555168408826946

It's exciting and uplifting with a storyline that has you ready to stand up and cheer at the end. It shows how one person can rise out of poverty and live the life he dreamed of. Nothing is guaranteed, but you only have a chance if you're willing to try.

Another aspect of the film that I enjoyed was the fact that the story took place in India. I find the location and people fascinating and tend to gravitate towards anything and everything dealing with the Indian landscape, both physical, cultural and spiritual. Obviously this was a film I was destined to appreciate.

I was impressed by the performances delivered by newcomers and stars; Dev Patel and the lovely Freida Pinto. However there were also a number of excellent though minor performances by actors who are all but unknown in American but actually quite famous and popular in India. The two I'm thinking about in this category are Anil Kapoor who played the part of Prem, the dishonest game show host and Irfan Khan the police inspector. I thought Anil Kapoor was amazing, in my opinion delivering the best performance in the film.

turns out rental versions removed the extra content. offering a movie only disc instead

the quality was excelent for a rental DVD

this movie is a must see by the way

i found online a copy of the alt retail (Movie-Only) disc & it is the same as the rental copy ,
 with High Quality Anamorphic Wide Screen Video (video scales full screen on my pc monitor), Optional SubTitles (turn On/Off), no extras
the first time i watched this the subtitles appeared over a clean image that was properly displayed on my monitor

i found in store on sale for $6.99 and lucked out the copy i purchased & now own has the extras (deleted scenes, etc.)....
however the disc i purchased is not like the rental , the movie is letterboxed (Letterboxed means black bars on all 4 sides & lower quality video)
 with subs hard coded in the image... ouch...
 and the subs appear with stylized comic book square bubbles around them ... i think this is the theatrical edit of the film....
the copy i bought had the movie with black bars all around it

and no changes have been made to any setting on players
simply switch discs and you get different result

someday i will have to re rent & watch the rental version
and rip it... if i figure out how...

Final Thought

Rent watch enjoy , Rent Again Later ... new version every time you watch it...

yes what i am saying is the movie may be the same on all Three DVD Prints
but they are slightly different

1 x Rental
clean HQ video , text overlay subs at the bottom of screen , no extras

1 x Retail
same As Rental HQ , AFAIK, no extras

1 x Retail
letterboxed ALT. LQ video, subs are in the image stylized and text overlay mix , extras are here !

they should copy the video from the rental to the disc with extras and rebrand 2.0

3745762,4,B001P9KR94,"`Slumdog Millionaire' is the story of a poor Indian man, who grew up in the slums of Mumbai and who goes on to star in India's version of Who Want to be a Millionaire. It is told in flash backs, with each part of his life history linked to the question being asked on the gameshow. This is a novel way of progressing both stories and explained his motivation to be on the show in the first place. This film was marketed in the trailers as quite a light hearted affair, but in reality it is quite dark in places and very gritty. It shows the harsh life of those born into the slums of India and although it has the rags to riches element to it, you are also shown the more ugly side of a life of poverty. I thought the film was all the better for this and it made for a film with greater weight and depth. Everyone plays their roles very well and the acting is good from child and adult cast alike and the direction is as good as Boyle is renowned for. There is also an excellent Bollywood dance scene at the end credits which made for a delightful way to end the film. This is much better than I anticipated and the darker feel to some aspects lent it a gravitas that only increases it's appeal. This was highly commended and for good reason.

3745770,5,B001P9KR94,"Ok, I finally got around to seeing Slumdog Millionaire.  Yes, I was 2 years late but it was indeed worth it.  My only critique would be of the occasional ""cheesy"" element within the soundtrack....the sampled strings during dramatic moments.  For the most part the soundtrack was pretty cool, especially the Indian hip hop elements.  Many people have knocked the film for being too predictable, etc. but I think the predictability works in this case.  The naive elements actually made me appreciate how hard filmmaking can be.  This film was really a breath of fresh air compared to what Hollywood pumps out these days.  After the film was over I actually realized how we as Americans have ""got it made"".....we have it easy!

The film reminded me of the 1981  Brazilian film,""Pixote.""  Both films deal with orphaned children and the rough street life they live.  ""Pixote"" does not have a happy ending. Slumdog does have a ""Hollywood"" ending so to speak.  I've yet to see Luis Bunuel's ""Los Olvidados"", another masterpiece dealing with street kids.

3745772,3,B001P9KR94,"First the Good: Acting and character selection as well as the choice of the music tracks. The three main characters (Jamal, Salim and Latika) are each portrayed by three different actors. The transitions are smooth, and they resemble quite a bit, so it makes it believable.
The storyline is made up of a series of back flashes that give you the background story of Jamal. A key element that ties the story together is Jamal's undying love for Latika, who he eventually wins over.

The Bad: Latika becomes the servant of a gangster, and when she tries to run away, her face is scarred. Women are undermined in this film and treated more like property to be used and abused at will, rather than equal human beings. (Maybe this has to do with the Indian culture).

The Ugly: What I found quite disturbing about this film is the over-emphasis on the cruelty shown to children. Displayed is the deliberate blinding of children so that when they go begging they would get twice as much. Additionally young Jamal is shown jumping into a sewerage pit and is totally covered in filth. In another scene, while Salim is sleeping naked, minced hot peppers are poured unto his private parts.

3745774,3,B001P9KR94,"Hmmm. A while back, I finally got my hands on Slum Dog Millionare, and watched it. This was actually a long time ago, but I was too lazy to comment about it:

So, my response was, besides the epic soundtrack (it really did deserve an award for the score, the movie wasn't all it was cracked up to be. It was a feel good story written by Americans about India, with perhaps a focus on Mumbai. That being said, there was some truth to the movie: The poverty, the gangs, the violence, the crime and all that exist. My friend's mom didn't want to watch it because she has seen these things up front and it's too real for her. Since I haven't directly seen any of this (not to say I'm unaware of these things and I realize that they go on in Dhaka about as much as they do in Mumbai and other Indian cities, I just don't see them because I keep to myself and don't travel about in the slums or at night or interact with more ""shady"" people), I was able to watch the show without it affecting me too much.

But, like I said, Slumdog was a feel good movie. Jamal gets on the TV show, he wins the money, he gets the girl, he lives happily ever after. Even his brother, who ends up dying (killing himself, you could say, though he doesn't actually pull the trigger) has a somewhat happy ending. He had dug himself into a hole and got out of it the only way he knew how: killing his boss and letting his former companions get their revenge. The dying in a bathtub of money was good imagery, since I like to imagine it was the amount of money that Jamal won, something about how money doesn't buy happiness or the like.

And yet, despite the fact that this show has such a clichd ending,it somehow captured the heart of Oscar guys as well as lots of Americans. People going on about how Slumdog is amazing and we all should watch it. I watched it. It wasn't amazing. If anything, I thought the Dark Knight was a better done movie. The Joker was EPIC. It was just amazing. Heck, I enjoyed Iron Man more than Slumdog. Yes, Slumdog was a better show, but it wasn't as fun. I'll probably never want to watch Slumdog again, but I'd watch Iron Man again.

People say that Slumdog was amazing, but I've seen better movies. Gladiator? Master and Commander? 3/10 to Yuma? Russell Crowe has made some amazing movies. I don't even have to mention LotR or Star Wars (original trilogy only please) everyone knows how amazing those movies were. If Slumdog is the best thing to come out of Hollywood (and given the amount of awards and praise it received, much more than any other movie released this year or last), then I weep at the lack of talent Hollywood now has. Where have movie-makers like Peter Jackson and actors like Will Smith gone? When will our next Pirates of the Carribean (not as epic as LotR, but very well done nonetheless) or Spiderman come? Will they ever come? Recently the Oscars have been doing badly in terms of making money, this is because since the last LotR there haven't been any movies that have captured the heart of America, or the world for that matter. The best thing we can show the world is the Dark Knight, a tale of how far humanity has fallen, or Slumdog, a feel good movie that says ""miracles happen,"" just in a rather dramatic and well-done way.

Despite all my criticisms, I did honestly enjoy Slumdog, but looking back on other movies I've seen, I don't think I'd choose to watch Slumdog again over lots of other movies. I've seen better.

3745775,4,B001P9KR94,"I really liked this movie.  It was interesting and kept me captivated on what was going to happen next.

Jamal (Dev Patel among other actors), a young boy from the slums of India and his brother Salim (Madhur Mittal among other actors) sadly lose their mother early to a violent death.  While most of the movie starts from when they are very young, the different scenes show them growing up and fending for themselves on the streets.

More of the plot however, centers around Jamal being on the show of India's version of ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire.""  One question away from winning the grand prize, he is forced into police custody and tortured to see how he is winning (they believe he is cheating).  Instead, he tells them how he knows the answers and in doing so, gives them the story of his life.  Prominently featured in these stories is Latika (Freida Pinto among others) who is a young girl who joins them in their travails after their mother's death.

Each question a new part of Jamal's life is uncovered.  Most of it is very brutal; to be sure there are not many happy parts in this movie.  Now as a contestant on this show, his only thought is to get Latika back, which could prove very dangerous.

For warning, this movie is very graphic.  It features beatings, murders, and other acts of violence.  Definitely not a good movie for the younger crowd.  It is realistically done though so I could imagine things like this happening.

The characters were well played I thought.  Dev Patel especially as Jamal did great at portraying his worry over Latika and his quest to find her.  For some reason the actor who played his brother reminded me of Michael Jackson in his younger years, but it was only mildly distracting from the movie.  All the other characters seemed authentic enough as well.  The only character that wasn't truly amazing to me was the older Latika, while she was quite beautiful, there wasn't a lot of depth that went into her character like there was for the rest of them.

The music in this movie was fantastic.  It was a mix of Indian/English so while a non-Indian dialect speaker might not be able to understand some of the lyrics, there were some that could be understood.  They had great rhythm and fit the flow of the story nicely.

Overall a great movie.  There was a lot of action but enough story to keep you engaged in the characters.  I truly cared about how the ending would turn out and was pleasantly surprised and equally as shocked at the results.  I can see why it won so many awards.",1281657600,,2536,4.518681318681319
3745776,3,B001P9KR94,"Somewhat convoluted film that is told in and out of time order roughly at five levels, some levels separated by years, others separated by days, others by hours. The story is about two brothers Jamal and Salim, and their friend Latika, who are played by three teams of actors, roughly aged five, 12 and 21. The film starts when Jamal is thrown into police interrogation, suspected of cheating on a 20,000,000 rupee quiz show. No one can understand how a street kid could get so many questions right, but somehow he does. Through flashback, we understand how he does it. And the police, never having encountered someone so truthful, cannot keep him in the cell any longer. And so he goes back to the TV studios to play the final round.

Of course, the question of luck is a bit like the story of Chance the Gardener in ""Being There"" - he never did anything other than be himself, and was immensely successful at it - but the story of young people who fought their way out of poverty and bad luck to finally make something of their lives, and to win the support of the population in so doing, is simply a tale that is hard to beat.

3745778,4,B001P9KR94,"Slumdog Millionaire has been criticized by some reviewers as being unbelievable, but I've always believed in the ability of movies to help people escape for that hour and a half or two hours. The story revolves around an impoverished and uneducated Indian man who is one question away from winning the Indian equivalent of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. First he is captured by police forces who simply cannot believe that this impoverished man is one question away from winning the ultimate prize. This leads the viewer on a back-tracking whirlwind through the life of this man through his childhood, the formation of the three Musketeers with his childhood friend Salim and his eventual love interest. Jamal and Salim eventual take off, leaving Latika to become an exotic dancer known as Cherry until the two friends retain to rescue their Third Musketeer.

Eventually Salim turns on Jamal to become a hired gunmen for an Indian muscle-man ejecting Jamal from his life and separating him from Latika once again. The style of this movie is a bit bothersome for me because it comes across as an our and half period of flashback ended with a half an hour of present time period action. There had to have been a better way to do it than just stuff that felt like constant flashback. Still I can't complain about the cinematography because they made India look at once bright, beautiful, and hopeful through colors, but yet dangerous through the blacks, whites, and grays of thug life and things lost.

3745790,3,B001P9KR94,"It seemed that about mid-year, 2008, the entire world (at least the cinematic world) caught a serious case of Slumdog Fever and soon the critics bodies and big prestigious awards bodies followed suit, handing over a near complete sweep of awards to a small yet bountiful film entitled `Slumdog Millionaire', a project that was probably on no ones radar and yet proved to be on everyone's minds.  Looking back on the film (and recently revisiting it) I have to say that I'm still somewhat baffled by the rapturous applause this film received.

I said somewhat.

Personally, I have never seen a film that was so over-thought and yet simultaneous so under-thought as `Slumdog Millionaire'.  For a film that prides itself in telling elaborate stories to add layers to a humble `slumdogs' apparent knowledge (a young boy actually wades through fecal mater for an autograph), this film all but seems to stop thinking completely in parts where it truly matters (like wrapping up a sloppy ending with a rather unlikely love story).  The film had a nice concept, but the script is poorly realized and comes off unnecessary and actually quite choppy in the end.

Not for a lack of trying though.

There are many elements in play here, but the film doesn't know how to tie them all together cohesively.  It is almost like the `gameshow' aspect of the film was an afterthought, something used to connect the dots when instead it actually serves as a distraction.  Yes, I know that this is adapted from a novel; I'm just stating how the tone of the film came across to me, especially in the end, as the film is tying up lose ends.

I kind of have to applaud Danny Boyle here, and so I'll stop my critique to offer a slice of appreciation for the director behind this uneven offering.  Boyle is a director that I really admire and respect.  I have seen a number of his films, and what I love so much about him is that he is a director who will try anything and will adapt to any subject.  He is hard to pigeonhole because his vision is not tied down to one specific theme.  He has a masterful way of creating imagery that is honest and raw without losing a slice of humor that sets the tone of his films apart.  As a directorial effort, I can see a lot of thought in `Slumdog Millionaire'.  I don't think that his efforts were entirely successful (obviously) but I can see flourishes of greatness here.  I'm so elated that he has an Oscar, but I'm saddened at the same time because it came for (arguably) his weakest work.

Where was Oscar in '03, when he delivered the brilliant '28 Days Later'?  Where were they in '05 when he stunned with his touching yet original `Millions'?  What about his shocking sophomore film in '96, `Trainspotting'?

Alas...

`Slumdog Millionaire' follows young Jamal as he nears the home stretch of India's version of `Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'.  The film begins with an interrogation where he is being accused of cheating.  The film then jumps back and forth between his moments on the show, his interrogation and his childhood as he explains to the cops how he knows all the answers.  At times the films explanation of things can be pretty smart, other times they are fairly lazy.  That is what I mean by uneven; over-thought and under-thought.  The ending itself is shamefully under-thought.  The entire `Jamal/Latika' love story is seriously under-thought.  The character development feels like an afterthought.  The development of Salim alone is disgusting.  I have never really encountered a more vile character in recent cinema, and yet for some reason I'm not supposed to feel this way.  The film offers no real development to persuade me in the desired direction.  In fact, I can't decide if my smile at the films end had to do with what happened on the gameshow or in the bathtub.

The acting was decent, but nothing (and I mean NOTHING) to write home about.  Dev Patel was bland beyond words, and Freida Pinto was barely used (but effective).  The real standout here was Anil Kapoor, who evoked more emotional commitment than any actor in the film.  The young actors were well used, especially Ayush Mahesh Khedekar, who played young Jamal.

I won't lie; I enjoyed this film, I was just disappointed.  For a film with such promise, `Slumdog Millionaire' easily finds itself suffering from generic clich&eacute;s that haunt many films.  I expected more from Boyle.  I expected a film with this much praise to rise above those stereotypes and formulate something fresh and original.  The characters feel like skeletal variations (as in `lacking detail') of many other characters from many other movies.  In then end, I was smiling but when the confetti cleared I was left pondering just how much better this movie really could have been.

And is it just me or was the ending credits nosedive into music video edited `You Got Served' territory totally fun yet tremendously cheap feeling?",1274918400,2,4916,4.732941176470589

It got such rave reviews and awards at the Oscars I figured this had to be a fabulous film by far.  To my surprise the film was rather violent and showed abuse and exploitation of children.  I guess this was a touch of realism of the happenings in poor villages.  Anyhow, the story is a bit depressinig and sad, however, the only uplifting part is Jamal's undying love for Letita whom he knew briefly as a little boy, got separated from, and despreately sought to find throughout the rest of the movie.  The story has many holes in it and leaves you wondering what happened here and there.  I thought the flashbacks to how Jamal came to know the answers to some of the questions on the game show was a pretty creative idea.  I never understood why they thought he was cheating or how they could legally get away with torturing him for such an accusation.  The most a game show would do if you cheated is to take back the winnings!!  Not shock you with electrical currents and hang you from a wall!!  That part made no sense.  He was sitting in the hosts face the whole time...how could he cheat??  I just wish the love story was built up more since a good portion of the film showed Jamal searching for this girl.  Also, I wish they would have shown what he did once he won all that money.  Again, the film was good but I don't see what the massive hype was about.

3745794,5,B001P9KR94,"Slumdog Millionaire tells the story of Jamal, his brother Silam, and Latika. All three children are orphaned in an attack on the Mumbai slum in which they live. They join forces to lead an adventurous, poverty-stricken life. Jamal and Silam become separated from Lakita in the midst of a daring escape from a gangster. For years thereafter, Jamal searches for Lakita. He finds her years later, only to be separated from her again.

In desperation, Jamal manages to land a spot as a contestant on the Indian version of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"", hoping aginst hope that Latika will be watching so they can be reunited. In a twist of destiny, Jamal discovers that, due to the unique experiences growing up in the slums, he knows the answer to question after question.

Though there are definitely some very difficult parts of this movie to watch (especially at the beginning, when the primary characters are helpless children, prey to the unsavory environments that surround them), the film is ultimately uplifting. A marvel of casting, to boot, as a gifted actor portrays each of the princpal characters in different stages of life.

3745795,5,B001P9KR94,"The title says it all. The film is about diametrical juxtapositions: affluence and squalor, ethical duty and utilitarian abnegation of morality (e.g., Jamal's conscience vs. the callousness of the slave traders), true love and corporeal lust (e.g., the harem of Javed vs. profound sentiments between Jamal and Latika). Slumdog Millionaire's success lies in its insistence on extremes to offer a quasi-Dickensian social critique. Though this viewpoint certainly represents nothing novel, the film is strikingly original in its multilayered approach. It is at once a credible romance, tracing the development of Jamal's and Latika's relationship to serendipitous fruition from their life as street kid ""musketeers"" through Latika's unhappy position as the sex toy of a polygamous, abusive husband; a documentary that affords a seemingly panoramic view of Indian culture, including a coldy realistic portrayal of the law enforcement officials and the horrors of the child beggar slave trade; and a philosophical commentary on justice and free will. This latter point is of particular importance to the film's message and is particularly illustrated in the sequence involving the show's two final questions that he does not know the answer to.

First, in the move that gets him arrested, Jamal picks an answer different from the one that the quiz show host writes on the mirror in the bathroom. What is interesting here is why he does this. Perhaps he is reacting against the host's obvious contempt for him as one nouveau riche Indian to another by deliberately picking a different answer. More plausibly, however, it is because of Jamal's resistance to choose any answer that he didn't pick of his own accord. In this way, the film equates the apparent randomness of answering a multiple-choice question correctly when one doesn't know the answer with the often apparent randomness of making good ethical choices. Jamal's slumdog background would indicate to the authorities that he should have been taught no moral principles and thus would choose the sleazy way out by cheating, yet he seems to have an innate sense of right and wrong. Jamal's choices may seem more random since they are untutored by a principled upbringing, yet the attempt is to show -- if we grant Boyle the, again, quasi-Dickensian supposition that any individual at birth has a greater propensity toward good than evil -- that the poor and disadvantaged person may, in fact, be more likely to choose right because he is less tainted by the learned behaviors of acquisitiveness.

Second, in a twist of dramatic irony, Jamal is asked what the name of the third musketeer is and is unable to answer even though he, Latika, and his brother Salim used to call themselves the ""Three Musketeers."" In a scene of tremendous energy and tension, Latika, who has been released from her bondage rather unexpectedly by Salim, had rushed to the show to meet Jamal. Because Jamal doesn't know the answer, he uses the ""phone-a-friend"" option to call Salim, but instead reaches Latika, whom Salim had given the cell phone and who has now arrived at the show. She doesn't know the answer either, so in the end Jamal ends up randomly picking the first available answer, A, Aramis, the right answer. This wonderful sequence ties in the themes of fate and justice while reiterating the illustration of moral dilemmas from the first question. Jamal's life has been one of degradation and subjugation, as well as waiting and hoping to be with the woman he loves. It is therefore poetic justice that the answer to the final question should be the first available one.

Some have claimed that the film is nothing original thematically. To them I ask, well what isn't? In the end, it's how one treats the themes that matters. Therein lies the originality of this film, easily one of the very best made in the past 10 years.

Even if I adore the cinematic medium, I avoid the Academy Awards like the plague, and when that time came I decided to watch this film instead which happens to have won in 2009's major categories.  As the film came out, I was into the thick of travel, and moreover the film didn't seem to me like a good fit for Danny Boyle's style.  No less, it is one of those films about foreign poverty, with a grand conscience, and those can just turn out awful.  My perception is that, inevitably, people patronized (and then patronized) the film with work-righteous emotions fit for the occasion, and its distributors piled onto that package with the moniker that it was the ""feel-good movie of the year.""  No thanks.

But I watched it anyway, because it was just remastered onto Blu-Ray and I became an admirer of Danny Boyle's wild directorial style from his science fiction masterpiece Sunshine, which ranks with Kubrick's 2001 and Tarkovsky's Solaris as perfected speculative fiction, lacking any mess of cowboys and indians in space with noises magically permeating vacuums.

Something surprised me about Slumdog Millionaire, though I ultimately found it flawed from its failure to resist utter sappiness with a hyper-romantic disregard of reality (too many perfect coincidences; it might as well have tried to be a Greek drama about gods and fates).  The surprise for me was in its brash, stylistic disregard for the culture.  Boyle shot the film with agitated camera movements, super-wide-angle lenses (practically fish-eyed), avant-garde compositions, skewed framings, and so forth -- in other words, idiomatic to Boyle's modernist style.  Yet, if the original vision were that of the typical Birkenstock-armored documentarian (I am surrounded by them), all of these stylistic measures would be a violation.  It is in fact only at the end of the film (train station dancing sequence) where the Hindi cultural sensibility of Bollywood bridges the gap, and it becomes a merged work of cinema.

And that is the whole point.  A Westerner visiting India arrives a Westerner and leaves a Westerner -- show me exceptions and I'll show you a skeptic.  The pretense of all filmmakers, composers, authors and visual artists who immerse themselves for the purpose of divining native art is perfectly inauthentic.  (Notably, my favorite living composer, Philip Glass, ""invented"" the last major movement in serious contemporary music -- Minimalism -- under the guidance of Ravi Shankar when tasked with transcribing microtonal indigenous ragas into Western notation.  Minimalism, and Glass's Minimalism, does not sound Indian, yet those Eastern fingerprints are all over the place.)

It only increased my otherwise simple affection for the film when I surfed around a bit only to find significant mass criticism against it for failing (in one fell swoop?) to ""capture"" the spirit and the desolation of Mumbai.  I also find it comical as well as hypocritical that many are quite furious to know that the untrained child actors are still living amidst the depicted poverty.  Surely they can only be prosperous and happy in comparison to Western standards of heavyweight wealth!  And surely, snatching them from that ""slumdog"" environment will solve it all.",1268179200,6,3304,5.151685393258427

The first scene opens up on Jamal who has somehow been selected to appear on India's Version of the TV show, ""Who Wants to Be A Millionaire?""  Jamal is not expected to win because of his disadvantaged roots, but he has had some unique experiences as a kid that enable him to guess the answers correctly.  Many flashbacks are shown as he is interrogated by police on how he knows the correct answers to very difficult questions.

The story flows and moves at a good pace.  The life experiences of terrible poverty and treatment of children in Mumbai are both sad and somewhat funny at times.  The children know no other life.

I just came back from seeing Slumdog Millionaire, and if you are any sort of movie fan I would put this movie in the ""must see"" category.  It was rightly nomimated for Best Picture for the 2009 Academy Awards.

First, it is an excellent story. It intertwines episodes of the India version of Who wants to be a Millionaire with the story of 3 Mumbai (Bombay was the colonial name of this city) street orphans. Both story lines kept me on the edge of my seat.

Secondly, it gives a view of India that perhaps we normally do not get to see. Certainly it is a view that we do not want to see or think about. To see/imagine humans living in those conditions is hard for this mind, encased in a body living in a first world country, to contemplate. There were orphaned kids running loose in the streets, sleeping where they could, picking through dumps for sustenance. There was a general disregard for life and unbelievable hardship depicted.

Mumbai, with a population density of almost 30,000 people per square kilometre, is the world's most crowded city.

I've put an email into to an Indian friend of mine to see how close this is to reality, and how much was the movie. I'm betting it is pretty close to the reality of India.

There is violence in this movie. There were 2 or 3 parts where I just had to close my eyes. I could not watch what was about to transpire on the screen. There was some language. Both the violence and the language were not gratuitous like some films out today. They were an integral part of the story.

Ultimately, it is a story of love, hope, self redemption and perseverance against odds. You alternate between being appalled by their living conditions, admiring of their ingenuity, and rooting for a happy ending.

Unfortunately, I could actually see why this film was not well received in India.

The film portrayed mostly poor people in India.  In addition, they made it seem like the majority of the officers were corrupt.  I tried very hard to not let these quirks get in the way of the plot.  After all,  in any poor neighborhood - including places in the United States - these things are bound to happen.  Stress levels are higher, there generally is less reliable help from authority, and so forth.  This can safely be generalized to most places in the world where there is a low-income neighborhood and a high crime rate.  I have not done any research on the statistics in Bombay/Mumbhai, but despite the overemphasis on poor people in India, I was willing to put this reservation to the side.  I even bit my tongue when I saw the Muslim fanatics attack people and saw the main character make a comment about blaming Rama and Allah for his mother's death.  (I will say this, though: the inter-caste violence is generally more infrequent than people in the West make it out to be and even then, it is usually reserved to the rural population.  In almost any society, social norms are more rigidly enforced when you get away from the more populated and diverse areas.)

What really turned me off was the scene when little Jamal was conning tourists, only for the police to publicly beat him.  Some cops might abuse their authority, but I really do not think the developed parts of India would have this happen a lot.  Following this was the young Jamal made the comment to the tourists, ""You wanted to see what the REAL India is REALLY like?""  After this comment more or less helped me make my decision on the degree of stereotyping.  The tourist responded via giving cash to Jamal and saying, ""This is how the real America is like!""  I may have not quoted the scene word for word, but this is how the scene went.  This part of the dialogue really made it obvious that the script writer and film maker over-stereotyped.  It also shows a lack of consideration for the non-profit institutions in India that actually -do- help the poor.  But like America, people in other countries cannot help -all- of their population.

This major ""turn off"" aside, the plot was interesting and I am always up for something dealing with the gray aspect of society.  It really shows what could happen to the homeless when people do not pay any attention to them.  Furthermore, I think the main characters show how far people will go to survive when put under the circumstances many homeless and poor people endure in the city slums.  I think someone already said the only unlikely thing that happened was Jamal becoming a millionaire...despite this, almost everything else seemed a pretty accurate portrayal of this environment.

In addition, I read where 2009 was such a mediocre year that a movie like ""Slumdog Millionaire"" might end up as Best Picture come Oscar time.

""Slumdog Millionaire"" IS a very good movie.  As it began, I thought that I was finding out too much too soon.  With all this information up front, how would the rest of the movie keep my attention.  Before long I realized the brilliance of its' cinematic concept; the answer to each question on the game show was learned in the school of Hard Knocks by our improbable hero, Jamal Malik.  Jamal has lived a tough life and every tragedy and misfortune was etched in his memory.  His seemimgly emotionless reaction to each correct answer on ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire"" was a testimony to the suffering the answer brought to mind.  Naturally, the movie lets us in on the ""stories behind the answers"".  Along the way, we meet other characters important in Jamal's life as they weave in and out of his story.  The ending is somewhat predictable but we would be greatly disappointed otherwise.

The director uses flashbacks in a confusing manner starting with an adult Jamal being tortured in a Mumbai police station.  We are then treated to all kinds of flashbacks with an adult Jamal playing the India version of Who Wants to be a Millionaire and a very poor kid Jamal being abused by his bully brother Salim.  Salim locks Jamal in an outhouse when the local celebrity comes to visit their villiage.  The only way Jamal can get out is to fall in the cesspool beneath the outhouse.  A Jamal covered with feces is able to get an autograph from the star.

Jamal's misery is intensified as his brother sells his Jamal's autographed photo and then a bunch of rioters kill the boys' mother.  The two boys escape the rioters to be taken in by some criminals that are trafficing and exploiting young children.  The boys eventually escape but Salim twarts the escape of Jamal's female friend Latika.

The movie follows them as they grow up and Jamal is constantly searching for his friend Latika.  The movie shifts constantly between the present day torture in the police station, Jamal answering questions on the TV game show and the boys story growing up.

All through their life Salim is bad to Jamal and Jamal can never seem to find happiness without Latika.  I really liked most of the film but I found the constant flashbacks and time shifts to be annoying.  Also, the subtitles when needed were virtually impossible to read.  Jamal's game show experience did not seem believable except if the movie were to be labelled a fantasy.

3745870,4,B001P9KR94,"In the movie time goes backwards, but that's a common technique. Everything begins with a boy from Moombai, Jamal Malik (Dev Pootel) participating in ""Who wants to be a millionaire?"" Jamal grew up in boondocks and didn't have any education whatsoever. He works as a waitress in a cell company and he shouldn't really know any answers. Seriously what can he possibly know besides how much milk goes into tea.  Lost eyes, no emotions also support the idea and clearly audience makes fun of him. But as the show goes on, showman Kumar has less and less to laugh about, because Jamal answers all the questions he's asked. And when the prize is almost there, Kumar gets obsessed with idea that Jamal is cheating. He thinks that there is no way guy like this can answers the questions that couldn't been answered by educated people with degrees.  They send Jamal to police, where he gets beaten and tortured. There he tells policeman about his life and why he knows the answers. His life was cruel and tough of course. Poor childhood in a Muslim family, murder of his mother by fanatics, loitering with his brother Salil and girl Latika, begging, tough love of him and Latika, betrayal of Salil, mafia and a chance to win 20000000 and find his love. Then goes traditional Indy songs and dances.
  Danny Boyl - the director of the movies is original and versatile. Drama about drugattics in ""'' ''''"", adventure ""Beach"", horror - ""28 days"", totally stupid ""Sunshine"", and now drama ""Millionaire"" where Boyl mixed original Indy movie with a thoroughly planned scheme ""Movie for Oscar"". And it worked.  First of all the movie got 8 Oscars plus 75 awards and 26 nominations. Second, with budget of only 15000000(half of which were spent on snacks) it collected 300000000 over the world (almost like a ""Pulp Fiction"" back in the days).
 The movie isn't bad. The idea of mixing Bollywood and Hollywood is quite interesting. But the real drama didn't happen in my opinion. Boyl created a typically Hollywood fairytale: poor but honest guy takes trails over the years in order to get money, girl and a car (or maybe personal Rickshaw).
 The main idea of the movie is that uneducated guy got lucky to know all the answers because of his sad life experience and that can't take any critics. So that's a fairytale although movie is brought as a drama.  Why then all these coincidences? But on the other hand if we assume that the game for a million is a contrast to support the pitiful life in boondocks of Bombay. Boyl was very precise in showing all the horrors of that life.
  I don't want to say it's loosely made movie. But all the soap is overrated. His girl was a towel for a mafia boss and then she runs away to a recently rich tea-seller. That's once again for those who likes fairytales or doesn't defy drama from melodrama.
 Well, Boyl wasn't orienting on a people like me. People like me wouldn't bring 300000000 for the movie or not even that $15000000 budget. But those people who like fairytales, brought that money. So, Boyl was right.",1258070400,,3034,4.652336448598131

He is accused of cheating and is taken into custody. The authorities grill him on how a boy from the slums was able to answer every question on the show. Jamal explains question by question how he knew the answers, and also giving away his life story. This is an amazing story of a young man's life, and I enjoyed the music and the performances by the talented cast of unknowns. However, there were some major holes in the plot, and occasionally the characters' accents were so thick that it was hard to understand them. My favorite part of the movie is probably the credits, which are a lot of fun to watch. I recommend seeing this film, but don't understand why people went so crazy over it.",1256256000,,985,4.387978142076503

I watched the movie with a friend of mine who unfortunately cannot stay awake for more than 15 minutes of ANY movie.  This movie was so good that he stayed awake and fully engaged in the movie.  I was blown away, the child actors are EXCELLENT! They did an awesome job of casting these kids, you actually feel their emotion.  I liked the scene where Jamal is dancing in front of Latika as they wait to be called into the torture chamber. Yes, the idea that love conquers is not just romantic but the very truth, if you seek it and work for it as Jamal did.  Overall, a wonderful movie, I've seen few movies as good as this one! Just as importantly, the poverty levels shown in India can be found in MANY countries around the world.  It makes my heart ache to think about how many kids live, sleep and eat in landfills....this is not fantasy people, it's everyday life for millions of innocent children!!!!!!",1255996800,,1010,4.340425531914893
3745879,5,B001P9KR94,"First of all, the VERY first thing I need to say is this-

Do NOT let the previews you've seen of Slumdog Millionaire fool you- this movie is much more than just a contestant appearing on a gameshow, winning money, and winning back his girlfriend for a happy conclusion.

Slumdog Millionaire is about MUCH more than that.

It's about the contestant winning money on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire (the Mumbai version, which is the name of a city in India), but the storyline is more about how the contestant even GOT the opportunity to appear on the show, and the life long build-up of the contestants tragic and horrible past.

It's a story that focuses on the contestants past, and the way he had to grow up in a poor, dangerous and just unsettling and unhealthy environment. He had to go through life basically looking out for himself, along with his small group of friends, just to survive.

Throughout the movie, every time the contestant is about to answer a question on the gameshow, the story switches to something that happened in his past that enabled him to remember the answer to the questions he was being asked. Eventually there comes a point when the contestant answers so many questions correctly that he gets accused of cheating which leads to a little bit of violence.

It might sound a bit tacky, and maybe to some it is tacky, but to me, it was a story told exceptionally well, and I highly recommend this movie. What will happen to the contestants group of friends as they grow up and grow apart? Well, you have to see it to believe it. I was totally attached to Slumdog Millionaire the entire time and I can NOW see why the film received so many awards. The presentation is just amazing.

Great story, lots of tragic events and suspense, and just fantastic acting all around. Yup, it's one of those rare movies that does everything right.",1255737600,,1859,4.564564564564565
3745880,5,B001P9KR94,"I remember when the initial ""...Millionaire"" fever hit the U.S. back in 2000.  It struck a chord with us armchair dreamers that with a little incidental knowledge of the most arcane trivia we could be instantly rich.  Some nights without the pressure of the lights and the goading of Regis I knew all the answers and others I exhausted all my lifelines by the $1,000.00 question.  Director Danny Boyle and scenarist Simon Beaufoy ingeniously tap into this wish fullfillment and transplant it to India, a country that contains some of the most unimaginable poverty.  Reading some of the other reviews it appears that their film runs the gamut of love it or hate it.  Some feel that they are exploiting the suffering in India for commercial gain.  Others react to the plaudits the film received at the Oscars this year.  I don't have an answer to either criticism.  I can tell you I was engrossed throughout.  I think the critical and commercial success of the film is a response to the Cinderella aspects of the story which serve as an anecdote to our tough economic times.

3745884,3,B001P9KR94,"""Slumdog Millionaire"" portrays the India that we were always told about as kids in the US - crowded and chaotic beyond belief, chock full of nothing but poverty and violence, filthy and disease-ridden, and full of people who wanted nothing more than to steal everything you had if you looked away for even a moment.  This is a portrayal of India at odds with the modern image in every way.  Having never visited, I couldn't tell you which is correct.  But it sure puts you off of any thoughts you ever had about going to the Taj Majal or anywhere else in the country.

The majority of this movie is a oft-distressing downer, unrelenting in its grimness.  Nevertheless, the first part of the film starts to become unintentionally funny after a while.  As in ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles,"" whatever our hero does, things always get worse for him, and you can count on a calamity whenever he starts to become comfortable or happy.  The ending is indeed uplifting and a Triumph of the Human Spirit, but it's ultimately too little, too late.

So what's good about the film?  The performances are fantastic across the board, and we really buy into the characters.  The cinematography is colorful and spectacular.  You can always count on Boyle for great photography, whether in his best films like ""28 Days Later"" or his worst, ""Sunshine.""  And, ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is interesting, even if depressing.

If you're looking for a good-time Friday night movie, this is not what you want, despite how it was marketed.  Nevertheless, it's at least worth a rent.",1254960000,3,1554,4.815094339622641
3745885,5,B001P9KR94,"Danny Boyle's ""Slumdog Millionaire"" has been described as ""Dickensian,"" and there may be no better description of this heartbreaking, funny, riveting tale of three young kids from the slums of Mumbai.

Much of the story's strength comes from its willingness to throw the viewer into a world that is completely alien to most Americans - the slums of Mumbai.  These ramshackle tin roof warrens are home to hundreds of thousands of people, each with their own stories, tragedies, and triumphs.  Like ""City of God,"" which ripped aside the veil to show the horrific slums just outside of the paradise of Rio, ""Slumdog"" shows the squalor that can be found side-by-side with such romantic icons as the Taj Mahal.

I saw ""Slumdog"" after all the awards and accolades, and I was worried.  Could it possibly live up to the hype?  I knew that one of the characters, Jamal (played in teen version by Dev Patel, in youth by other actors) would end up on the Indian version of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,"" and that he had the hots for a gorgeous gal, Latika (teen version, Freida Pinto).  Would this movie strike me as flat as ""Juno,"" another movie I didn't see until dozens of people had told me that ""you have to see this"" (turns out, no I didn't).  Or would this be like ""Sideways,"" a movie that charmed me out of my socks even though everyone seemingly had raved about it?

The great news is that ""Slumdog"" is another ""Sideways"" in that regard.

Using the structure of the increasing dollar amounts of ""Millionaire,"" ""Slumdog"" tells the story of three kids as they try to make their way in a harsh, bleak world that chews up and spits out kids like so many cherry pits.  No spoilers here - just prepare to be shocked at the horrors these kids face with so much aplomb as well as the snatches of beauty and humanity these kids find along the way.  Not as harsh as ""City of God"" by any means, ""Slumdog"" nevertheless contains more than its share of powerful scenes that will haunt you.

Slumdog Millionaire is a very well done movie and deserved the Oscar for best picture and cinematography. Throughout the movie you are never really sure whether he is going to get the girl or the money. Both are certainly worth having.

Be aware that this movie is rated R for a reason. The main character is tortured by the police, his mother is killed during a violent rampage against Muslims, his brother becomes an assassin at an early age, and a ruthless organized crime gang intentionally blinds a young boy.

Slumdog is much more edgy than old school Bollywood films like Asoka or Lagaan. It also has better editing. It is not a romantic comedy like Bachna Ae Haseeno. There are no interspersed song and dance numbers throughout the movie. Slumdog has more action and graphic violence than Monsoon Wedding. But it's not quite as deep as Water.

3745903,5,B001P9KR94,"If you like Charles Dickens and, to a lesser extent, Horatio Alger, you'll love this movie.

  Jamal and his older brother Salim are children of the Bombay (now Mumbai) slums. The viewer is not spared the very apparent misery of those slums and the legions of poor who pick through the garbage, the beggars the very lowest on the social ladder.

  The tale is of Jamal, Salim and a girl, Latika, who becomes attached to them under horrible circumstances as very young children. Taken under the wing of a villain lifted directly from Dickens, but who is probably all too real in such poverty, the children are groomed for lives as beggars and prostitutes.

  Fate conspires to separate Jamal and Salim from Latika. The boys go off on their not-very-honest adventures across India. A few years later - with the kids being played by different actors now to reflect their emergence into adolescence - Jamal returns to Bombay to search for Latika, a rather daunting task in a city of 19 million, but as a product of the slums, he knows where to look.

  The story takes darker and darker turns with the would-be lovers separated again and again.

  Finally, in an unlikely set of coincidences, Jamal winds up as a winning contestant on ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire"" and as a victim of police torture.

  There are more twists and turns to this story than you can count, but the literate viewer will be able to identify all the plot devices lifted from classics and name their authors. Dickens and Dumas are prominent as is Shakespeare and numerous others. In short, this is a brilliant concept for a love story, turned into a compelling script and then an irresistible movie. It is a classic love story as well as poor-boy-makes-good. Some might be put off by the brutal depiction of Indian poverty, violence and generally depressing lives of many shown in this film.

However after seeing it I was left with the same feeling as There Will Be Blood in 2007--and for those who were blessed with missing that little film, in short I think it will be on ""The most overhyped of all time"" list.

After missing it in theaters (I blame limited release and school schedules) I finally rented a copy and sat down to watch the much anticipated and lavishly praised and reviewed film. After all according to the Academy this was the best picture of 2008. It started with a jolt (literally, as electrocuting a teenager's toes was not the kind of beginning I had in mind for a feel-good underdog story) the main character, Jamal I believe, is being tortured by a thug hired by the host of India's ""Who wants to be a millionaire"". Yes, you read that right, tortured because he has gotten to 10 million rupees (no slumdog--as they are called--ever has) and the host thinks he is cheating.

The rest of the film is each question being asked of him and subsequent flashback to describe how he came to know which American president appears on the one hundred dollar bill, and so forth.
Oh yes, and how could I forget there is a girl, yes a girl Jamal is pining after the entire movie. She is the on that got away. Mixed in with the flash backs is a story of how Jamal from a small age became an orphan. A slumdog.

I have no criticisms for the technical aspects, the cinematography is wonderful with the camera racing through the claustrophobic streets of overcrowded slums as a small Jamal and his brother race to get away from a cop hard on their heels. My criticism lies in that dreaded feeling (I felt the same in There Will Be Blood) that all movie buffs hate...""that's it?""

I started to think maybe I missed something. Maybe just maybe I did not quite read into the story as much as my English professor would have liked; but the more I thought I realized this, just like 2007s There Will Be Blood is another Overhyped, Over-awarded picture that just hit the majority of the critics just right.

Still days after I kept think why, oh why was this so recommended even by regular moviegoers and friends. I remember The Kite Runner a couple years back that failed miserable due to (what many cited in their reviews) the child rape scene. This didn't have it quite that bad, but pouring acid in a 5 year old kid's eyes is pretty disturbing for a ""happy"" little guy against insurmountable odds story. So, I thought some more until it hit me...it's all about timing!

In this massive, global economic downturn, academy voters and movie audiences didn't want to see a three hour movie were a previously named ""sexiest man alive"" actor ages backwards, or the border-on-pedophilia love affair of a fifteen year old boy and a thirty-some-odd year old female Nazi prison guard. And with the election finally over after almost an entire year of watching debates, reading polls, hearing soaring speeches, and watching a myriad of interviews; let's just say the mood for political dramas weren't exactly the hottest ticket. Especially when the two films in questions were about a disgraced Republican president who lied (sound familiar?) being interviewed and after the infamously entertaining and just as catastrophic Couric/Palin interview that is a tough sell. Oh and the other--an assassination of the first publicly elected gay man (Prop 8 anyone? If one of the most liberal states in the union failed to stop prop 8, how did the studio think they were going to be able to market and sell tickets to the rest of the nation). What audiences wanted was that rags-to-riches romance, a basic plot line that makes Cinderella such an endearing classic.

3745912,5,B001P9KR94,"Slumdog Millionaire brings to life a most unusual but plausible story of a young man who had to raise himself with his brother on the streets of Mumbai and deal with his affection and ever increasing love for a young woman who seems to be pitifully elusive. In addition, he must fight against the thugs and street gangs, one of which his brother eventually joins for excitement and money. Yes, on the surface it's about a young man who is so good at the Indian TV version of ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire"" that the police torture him to make him reveal ""his way of cheating"" on the quiz show. However, this film goes so much deeper; we see his life in a series of flashbacks as he explains to the police just how he was actually able to know all the answers to the questions on the quiz show. In addition, the cinematography and the choreography lack nothing; I couldn't ask for better. The casting was wonderfully done with great care and the acting is extremely convincing--wow, what a group of actors they had in this movie! The musical score enhances the movie as well.

When the action starts, we meet two young boys who are brothers, the very young Salim (Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail) and Jamal (Ayush Mahesh Khedekar). After they witness their mother being brutally killed by an angry mob, the two young boys are defenseless and they toughen up pretty quickly to adapt to being on their own, although Salim seems to do a little bit better at it. Salim is not afraid of much and he even sells his brother's prized celebrity autograph merely because he wants the money for himself; when Jamal is upset about it Salim just smiles and says he got good money for it and so that makes it right. Already we are seeing Salim going to the wrong side of the tracks. Salim and Jamal also meet another orphaned child, Latika (Rubina Ali) and Jamal takes a liking to Latika almost immediately, he even feels that with a third kid they can be just like ""The Three Musketeers!""

As time goes by we see the boys grow and develop; but Latika is sadly left behind when the boys climb aboard a moving train to escape the evil operator of an ""orphanage"" who likes to maim the youngsters who he forces to beg for money in the streets. Jamal misses Latika very, very badly but Salim just makes light of it; Jamal however is determined to find Latika and ultimately make her his own no matter low long his search for her takes. Eventually they do find Latika but Salim and Latika mysteriously spurn Jamal; and then it takes Jamal several years more to find Latika again. As adults, we see the grown Jamal (Dev Patel), Salim (Madhur Mittal) and Latika (Freida Pinto) coping with life and trying to work on relationships as best they can under horrible circumstances that I will not reveal here; I don't want to give you any spoilers. Of course, what you do know is that Jamal makes it onto the quiz show and he is well on his way to winning a lot of money; he even gets around the game show host Prem Kumar (Anil Kapoor) who tries to throw Jamal off with a phony tip on the answer to the next question on the quiz show.

The rest is left for you to discover; but I shall say you won't be bored. This is an excellent, poignant film that will leave you with quite a lasting impression. The extras on the DVD are quite well done, too. I especially liked the featurette entitled ""Slumdog Dreams: Danny Boyle & The Making of Slumdog Millionaire."" There are optional audio commentaries by director Danny Boyle and Dev Patel and producer Christian Colson and writer Simon Beaufoy. We get deleted scenes, too.

Slumdog Millionaire makes a great addition to your DVD collection; it did win eight Academy Awards including the Oscar for Best Picture and that alone proves this movie is very, very special. There is a modicum of violence so if you're turned off by that you may wish to reconsider; but the way this plays out is so artistic that you might just want to get this and enjoy it anyway.",1250121600,2,3968,4.461432506887053

3745915,4,B001P9KR94,"THE MOVIE

The story of Slumdog Millionaire is, oddly enough, something you could easily see becoming a movie. A little heralded, straight-to-DVD movie; an executive taking a chance by putting it out in theaters; that same film dominating the Academy Awards, and becoming one of the best films of the year, making a star of its young leading actor. Sounds Hollywood, doesn't it?

It's odd for a movie to become so inexplicably popular, but Slumdog did it. While I did (and do) love the movie -- and consider it one of the best films of 2008 -- I have to step out on a limb here and state, on the record, that I do think the movie is overrated. Good? Yes. Great? Close. The best movie of 2008? Not quite.

Still, Slumdog is a fantastic movie the first time you experience it.

The story revolves around Jamal Malik, a young man from the slums of Mumbai, suddenly finding himself in the hot seat on India's version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? Inexplicably, Jamal seems to know the answers to every question. Accused of cheating, he's taken to a secure location, where the police ""interview"" him to get a confession. Of course, it turns out Jamal isn't cheating; rather, the answers to the questions come from his own life experiences. And what a life this young slumdog has led!

The film plays artfully between past and present. In one moment, you'll witness Jamal being ""questioned,"" and in the next you'll witness a much younger Jamil having to find a way to survive in the world, as many poor orphans (and non-orphans) are forced to do in India's slums. Along for the ride are Jamal's older brother, Salim, and the girl he knew since childhood, Latika. Starting out as homeless, penniless, hopeless orphans, the seesawing chronological tale shows the ways life can treat a young slumdog, and Jamal and Salim play perfect foils to one another; Jamal is the boy who desires to escape and avoid a life of crime in favor of moderate living, while Salim is slowly enticed by illegal workings and the gangster lifestyle.

As the film progresses, director Danny Boyle (yes, the same guy from the zombie flicks) takes us to places in India we may have seen in books, but that we've never seen before. Aside from the well weaved story, Slumdog's true charm comes from the feeling it exudes. On one hand a familiar world we can understand; on the other something so different that it may shock or disgust more sheltered viewers.

Ultimately, Slumdog is one of those ""feel good"" movies that, at the end, makes you smile. Is the journey always happy? No. But, as I'm sure you'll be able to ascertain, the ending certainly leaves off on an overall happy note. There are a few problems with the narrative here and there, but overall, the story is solid, it leaves you feeling good, and there are only minor issues. The biggest issue, perhaps, is that once you've seen it, you can never see it the same way again. Some movies get better with repeat viewings -- some stay roughly the same. Slumdog Millionaire, however, is markedly lessened with each viewing. Maybe it's because, after seeing it, the strange and unfamiliar sights and culture aren't so strange and unfamiliar anymore?

THE DISC

- Audio and Video -

One of Danny Boyle's signatures is using various types of cameras and films when shooting, resulting in scenes that look entirely unique to the rest of the movie. That strategy is employed in full force in Slumdog Millionaire, and never has it looked so good. The transfer to Blu-ray is spectacular, and near-reference quality. Colors are vivid, blacks are deep, and certain scenes look incredibly realistic. The only problem I noticed was, in some scenes, grain seemed to be a bit more present, and less an artistic use and more a technical limitation. There's also a problem with bloom in some scenes, but nothing too worrying.

Those two issues are minor, and on the whole the video of Slumdog Millionaire on Blu-ray is as close to reference quality as you can get. It just misses the boat, but it's definitely one of the best looking films to come out so far this year.

If the video is near-reference, the audio is above and beyond reference quality. I knew the movie (and soundtrack) sounded good when I saw it in theaters, but who knew it could sound better in my living room! Presented in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 Surround, the audio is easily the best part of this release. Surrounds are employed to a great extent, really capturing the feel of urban slums. If it has one drawback, it's that it can be too loud -- too overbearing -- at times. With all of the little sounds going on in every scene, it's easy to want to turn it up to fully hear the atmosphere. But a minute later, the bass will kick in, or some foreground sound will increase, and suddenly you'll find yourself fumbling with the remote so you don't agitate your neighbor. (Although, if you live in a city maybe you can convince them the noise is coming from outside...)

- Extras -

The extras include the fare you'd expect with a release like this, but little of what you'd hope to see. To start off, there's the mandatory commentaries, the main one being by Danny Boyle and Slumdog star Dev Patel. Boyle goes on and on about the making of the movie and generally covers everything with a thick layer of enthusiasm, but Patel only offers a few real interesting tidbits, likely since he's not used to this sort of thing yet.

Next you have the deleted (and extended) scenes. A majority of the running time is spent extending scenes currently in the movie, but there are some worthy deleted ones that should be watched, including more fleshing out of Jamal and Salim's teenage years. Nothing that will alter how you view the picture, but worth watching for fans and non-fans alike.

Then, there's my favorite, ""Slumdog Dreams,"" which is the ""making of"" of Slumdog Millionaire. It gives an interesting look at some of the challenges a Western crew faced filming in Mumbai, as well as some of the unexpected problems that arose. Not too long (at a little over 20 minutes), but entertaining and informative.

In a move that may surprise many people, Slumdog Millionaire actually has Blu-ray exclusive features! One of them (""from script to screen"") is short, clcoking in at about 5 minutes, but the other is substantially longer. Unfortunately, it's a very specific piece for a very specific audience. Titled ""Manjha,"" the short black and white film (about 40 minutes running time) follows an actual slumdog through the streets of Mumbai, as he struggles to survive along with his baby sister. A fantastic story and one that must be told... But compared to the movie, a little -- make that a lot -- dark. If Slumdog made you happy and romanticize slums, then this will bring you back to earth.

- Verdict -

Slumdog Millionaire may not have been my favorite movie of 2008, but it's still a fantastic film. Sadly, there aren't as many extras for a Best Picture winner as I'd hope, but maybe we'll get the No Country treatment and see a special edition down the line. Until then, if you haven't seen Slumdog yet, this is by far the best way to do so. The film looks gorgeous, sounds bloody fantastic, and is a very inviting tale with enough character development to satisfy even the most jaded of critics. If you already saw it in theaters and were hoping for a few hours of extra material, I'm sad to say you'll have to keep waiting. In the meantime, still give picking this one up a thought. It may not have been my Best Picture for 2008, but so far it's easily the Best Blu of 2009. (So far.)

3745918,4,B001P9KR94,"Jamal sits in a room, encountering an intense police investigation, as they try to figure out how a young, uneducated kid from the slums could possibly have known all the answers during his appearance on India's ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"" We are taken through a series of flashbacks as he is questioned, and we learn about young Jamal's life with his brother, the difficulties and tragedies he's faced (such as the murder of his mother), the places he's been, and his initial meeting with childhood friend and eventual love, Latika. As perplexing as it seems, his ability to answer is based on some amazing coincidences, and he's also been able to find Latika several times and once even saves her from the clutches of a gangster. It seems that every time he catches up with her, fate intervenes and it is a short lived moment. The film moves back to the present, and the officers who interrogate the young man come to understand who he is. The two major conflicts within the story are: will Jamal be able to finally see Latika, his true love, and will he be the next millionaire. Certainly the love story takes precedent over his appearance on the show.

There's a certain Dickens-like quality to the film, as it has amazing coincidences and a ""rags-to-riches"" feel to it. From the depths of poverty, the protagonist experiences pain in life but rebounds, and is given the chance of a lifetime.  There's also an aspect to the production where we cannot expect to take things at face value; things have a fantasy element to them, and the story can be likened to a parable about love or overcoming one's roadblocks in life.

Slumdog Millionaire presents the often done ""rags to riches"" story in a unique manner and setting, and the film is worthy of its best picture status for 2008 (an award that has become a sham of late). Still, I felt that at some points the film dragged on a bit, and began to lose steam, and took some of the film's power with it. There is some violence, and some language, and the ""feel good"" label attached to Slumdog could be misleading without the resolution at the end.

Over all, though, this is a film with heart, and its story was presented effectively. I'm glad I finally had the chance to see it.",1249171200,2,2235,4.58

But this movie was a marriage made in heaven -- the realism of growing up in the slums of Bombay plus the all-important final dance number.

In all honesty, I found parts of this movie hard going, and not just because of the violence. Bombay, from the perspective of the have-nots, is something straight out of a nightmare (Charles Dickens, eat your heart out). The only reason the beginning of the film wasn't overwhelming was because Jamal's childhood was meted out in flashbacks, which gave us an occasional rest as well as the assurance that everything might work out after all.

I have to say that even knowing that a happy ending was probably in sight (this was an Indian film, after all), Slumdog Millionaire was nail-bitingly tense. There were moments when I actually wondered if our hero would get the quiz-show answer right, or if he would indeed ""get the girl,"" as heroes generally do. But afterwards, when all was said and done, the images that remained with me were not of the happy dancing masses, but of the tattered, abandoned children of Bombay.

3745934,3,B001P9KR94,"Slumdog Millionaire (Danny Boyle, 2008)

It's taken me quite a while since I saw this movie to get around to reviewing it, mostly because I really have no idea how I felt about it. Yes, I was uplifted, blah blah blah, but while I was watching the movie, I realized I was being manipulated, which bothered me. I'm used to needing to suspend disbelief when watching movies, but this one tosses belief right out the window from the first moment and never comes back to it. For all that I know that, however, it's an enjoyable enough movie.

In case anyone actually managed to miss the plot of the 2008 Oscar winner for Best Picture, it involves a young man, Jamal Malik (Dev Patel), who ends up on the Indian version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?.  As the host asks him questions, we see flashbacks to pieces of his life (amazingly, in chronological order!) that give him the answers. Boyle uses this to take us on a tour of Mumbai slum life, the state of gang warfare in India, a romantic subplot, and much much more.

As long as you don't mind being herded into the pen like cattle, or don't notice, this is just about the perfect movie; it took home eight Oscars, and as I write this is sitting at #64 on IMDB's Top 250. Heady stuff indeed, but I still find myself unimpressed with the complete lack of subtlety to be found in the script. Granted, everyone involved did a bang-up job of bringing that script to life, but the script itself left a lot to be desired. It's shameless in everything it tries to do, but it garnered a whole lot of true believers, both behind and in front of the cameras. It had to, for the final product to be as technically fine as it is.

The end is seamed predictably into the first scene, and the movie simply unraps its layers towards the inevitable conclusion. The tension built into the narrative is Disney schmaltz - that is, we are happy to follow the characters through their mistakes and hardships because we know all will come out right in the end.

This is not how life, let alone life in slum communities in India works. If such a film was made about American society it would be pilloried as a piece of Hollywood feelgood pap, profiting out of the naive chimera of the American Dream, as experienced by the poor. Set in India, it offers only a few colourful set pieces that show the hardships of slum life, rather than doing much to intelligently challenge and educate our perceptions of such societies.",1245888000,8,1013,4.627777777777778

Most of these flashbacks show the dangerous and hellacious aspects of life in the slums of India.  The way young children are used and abused by the Fagan like hustlers is disturbing.

3745937,4,B001P9KR94,"I love foreign films. I feel this way because storytelling comes first. If explosions, skin or violence is required to accurately tell their stories, so be it. But the story is everything in films made outside the USA. When I think of great `story' based films, `The Usual Suspects' (USA), `Run Lola Run' (Germany), and `Roshomon' (Japan) come to mind. There is only one element to these films that is similar. They all involve a recounting or revisiting of events that lead up to the finale. `Slumdog Millionaire' belongs in this category as well.

This film has the courage to go almost two-hours. The `standard' for movies these days is 90 minutes. That's mainly because studios listen more to focus groups than directors. The same standard applied in the sixties with record releases. The cardinal rule: never go over three minutes in length. This `wisdom' was obliterated when FM radio and `album oriented rock' ushered in an era of unprecedented creativity. In 'Slumdog Millionaire', Writer, Simon Beaufoy, Editor, Chris Dickens, and Directors, Danny Boyle & Loveleen Tandan complimented each other in a magnificent display of ensemble work behind the scenes. The precious extra minutes were used unselfishly and gave the story room to breath, and ultimately triumph

Another aspect of risk (beautifully handled here) was in seaming together multiple time periods. Many potentially excellent films are ruined as the story gets lost in the time tunnels, and confusion ensues. In `Slumdog Millionaire', we have three characters, interpreted by nine actors. Six of them being children. Each part was brilliantly acted, and the continuity was allowed to develop clearly and naturally. Again, Directors, Danny Boyle & Loveleen Tandan were the reason it worked. They say you get what you give, and they must have been quite generous with the young cast.

I would be negligent not to mention a marvelous supporting cast. Not to be outshone, the people and settings throughout were spectacular. Cinematographer, Anthony Dod Mantle, made the most of capturing an amazing country. The film was shot entirely in India. A few months before viewing `Slumdog Millionaire' I was extremely fortunate to have seen the amazing documentary `Story of India' on public television. I am certain that it enhanced this film for me.

`Slumdog Millionaire' is funny, adventurous, cruel, dramatic and clever. Boyle and wove all of these elements into pure delight. A.R. Rahman's score set the tone for lively, dramatic and humorous sequences. At the end of the film, I felt a sigh of relief; having already known everyone mentioned in this piece was recognized for their excellence. I don't know why, but when I have experienced outstanding film making, I want everyone else to have the same chance as well. If this piece was truly headed straight to DVD, one wonders if it would have been seen at all.

Much speculation has occurred in Hollywood over the connection, particularly financial, with Bollywood. But here is yet another example of something originating from outside of Hollywood that is literally defines `world class' film making. I hope the global boundaries that are falling `flat' in the business world take root in movies as well. Here's hoping that we can do away with the preface and just call them `films'.",1245801600,,3305,5.112962962962963

When I watch a movie I expect certain feelings in the end . . . happy, sad, etc. This movie left me numb. No feeling. I asked myself, ""Why was this made?""

It was not drama, not romance, not comedy, not horror, not fantasy, not science fiction, not the typical movie made for our viewing.

It was more of a fictional documentary. It was a twisted, but predictable 'love' story with trials of searching for one's 'childhood' love.

Why he knows these particular answers and how he got to the game show unfolds through flashbacks, starting with the massacre of an entire village except for Jamal, his brother Samil, and a little girl named Latika. The violent street life that Jamal has known and the love he has lost have uniquely prepared him for this moment.

SO for those who have not seen this movie, don't listen to the hype...don't listen to the offended complaints of those with high cultural sensitivity (this isn't a bad thing) .....don't even take this review too much to heart. Watch the movie. AS a movie on it's own it is average. The acting is passable but I only say passable. The movie is ""feel good"" and you might like that type of ""poverty romance"". But don't expect what you would find with some of the past Best Picture winners. This movie is ok don't get me wrong, but it is no Titanic...or LOTR.....it just isn't, if you were expecting that and came here to complain (for future reviewers) don't.

The movie is not that bad is my final answer. :P",1245110400,,1147,4.673267326732673

I just knew it had swept the awards season, and I had a great respect for Danny Boyle, as a director. The film was, in turn, amazing, horrifying, romantic, beautifully photographed, engaging, and satisfying. What I do not understand are people who found it cliched or formulaic. There is nothing ordinary about ""Slumdog Millionaire"". The use of flashbacks to explain how Jamal knew the answers to the difficult questions was brilliant. Not that flashbacks are new territory; it is how they were used that is intriguing. How hardened do people have to be not to feel swept up into the emotions of the children in the slums of Mumbai? Are people that ignorant of what life is like in India? Danny Boyle just showed you what life was like for a certain caste of people, and some people still cannot see it. There are slums and abject poverty and beggars and orphans and thieves and human traffickers. I found a lot of this unsettling, but I can face the truth. Why is it easier to watch a teen slasher film than the truth about a real country? Danny Boyle and Simon Beaufoy, the screenwriter, as well as all the wonderful actors, have created a masterpiece. It is deserving of all the accolades it received.",1245110400,,1429,5.190476190476191
3745956,4,B001P9KR94,"Winner of eight Academy Awards, including one for Best Picture of 2008, ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is like a Charles Dickens story updated to the techno-savvy 21st Century.  The movie focuses on a trio of impoverished orphans living and loving and contending with a slew of heartless villains in the slums of Mumbai, India.  Jamal, his older brother, Salim, and their compatriot, Latika, a young girl they take under their wing, undergo enormous trials and tribulations as they struggle to survive in a world that has pretty much abandoned them to the vagaries of fate.  In true Dickensian fashion, the story also provides generous doses of melodrama, implausible coincidences, hairbreadth escapes and heart-tugging sentimentality to help mitigate the suffering.

Based on the novel ""Q & A"" by Vikas Swarup, the movie starts off with a now 18-year-old Jamal being interrogated - and, indeed, tortured - by the Indian authorities who don't believe that an ordinary kid from the slums could be racking up this much money as a contestant on ""Who Wants to Be A Millionaire?"" (he's fast approaching the 20,000,000 rupee mark) without somehow cheating.  With this unlikely but clever narrative device serving as a framework, the movie then travels back in time to show the skeptical police investigator just how it is that Jamal does indeed happen to know the answers to all those questions.

Written by Simon Beaufoy and co-directed by Loveleen Tandan and Danny Boyle (""Trainspotting,"" ""28 Days Later""), ""Slumdog Millionaire"" somehow manages to push the envelope in the areas of plausibility and credibility without sacrificing its authenticity in the process. One moment it may be being brutally honest in its depiction of the effects of grinding poverty and cruelty on the human body and spirit - and the next be indulging in the veriest of feel-good fantasies, as Jamal stands on the brink of the ultimate rags-to-riches fable, getting both the money and the girl, in the best Horatio Algers tradition.  Yet, the movie never feels exploitative or compromised as a result of this dichotomy - a dichotomy, in fact, that clearly reflects the Indian culture of both wealth and poverty, traditionalism and modernity from which the story arises.

The flashiness of the editing and the liveliness of the directing keep the film hurtling ahead at a breakneck pace, while the cast of mainly amateur actors - playing the children at various ages - engages our sympathy from the outset.  Dev Patel and the gorgeous Freida Pinto are both splendid as the oldest incarnations of the two main characters.  And don't step out before the closing credits, a fun and lively bit of Bollywood hoopla designed to send audiences out of the theater with a spring in their steps and a smile on their faces - a smile that is well and honestly earned, I must say.",1244937600,,2829,5.0

3745958,4,B001P9KR94,"It's a companion piece to Mira Nair's ""Salaam Bombay!"" sucker-punch masterpiece, from so many years ago.

The slums of India are a human disaster, but humanity sputters for air wherever humans breathe. Poverty can claim the soul and hopes of some, but many continue to dream, and ""Slumdog..."" is a pipedream for a newly reawakened India. It's glorious, old-school, big-time filmmaking, and takes it's place in the 21st century zeitgeist of a country daring to dream bigger than it has in a long, long time. An India that can be India while also being something transnational.

The story of rags to riches is classic narrative, but done with a pulsing sound and camera that doesn't patronize a country and people. I would've preferred Jamal to be a prodigy whose tea-boy opportunity in the New India's IT industry opens a path to making it big. Instead the films opts for a story of flukes and coincidences that give our hero the right answers at the right time. Still, the power of this movie's heart is undeniable. Danny Boyle's craft with telling a global story in a local tongue (and let's put credit out there for the overlooked Loveleen Tandan); Rahman and MIA's drive to lift us off the ground with a roar of sound and a kick in the pants; Dev Patel and Freida Pinto and Madhur Mittal's Bollywood-free delivery... it all adds up to make for great movie-making.

""Salaam Bombay!"" showed the breaking of a human spirit in the crush of the slum. But sometimes, a few daredevils might find a way to get away. Look down on that outdoor latrine, realize what you gotta do to make it happen, scream and take your plunge. For those who get real lucky, maybe they'll even find love and a masala dance number at the end of it. You can hope, right?",1244851200,,1743,4.616129032258065
3745959,3,B001P9KR94,"The prior to this movie, almost no-name actors, carried this poorly written adaptation of a VERY, VERY good book.  Staying with the actors for a minute, they are raw and fabulous; Frieda Pinto is beautiful and backs it up with pure talent; Dav Patel has superb range; and Madhur Mittel showed strong qualities.  I look forward to seeing each one of them in future roles.  They propelled this movie from a 1 star to 3 in my book.

The screen play is pure junk...yes it had all the fancy shots, and it makes you cringe one minute and smile the next...it has all the qualities every other cookie cutter movie needs to make it in a theater today.  I tried my hardest throughout the entire movie to be fair and ignore the fact that I actually read the book that supposedly inspired this cinematic garbage.  I know with certainty that if I had seen the movie without reading the book, I would have sat there on as many occasions and said WTF!!  ""A 6 year old would really jump into an outhouse pit and run covered head to toe in human feces into a crowd of people to see his favorite actor?""  Sorry spoiler; but that's how the movie started and it didn't improve much from that point forward!

There were a few moments during the movie that I recognized the bastardized version of the book.  I am especially critical about the movie because while reading the book (Q&A) I looked forward to seeing the magical writing jump to life form on the big screen and it just didn't happen.  The characters plot and conclusion were all destroyed by the screenplay.  I've been disappointed by movie adaptations before but never like this.  You have to anticipate variations but this was atrocious.  One 5 star review of the book Q&A recommended seeing the movie to fill in the gaps of the book.  I highly...HIGHLY discourage that advice.  If you liked the movie, read the book and experience a legitimate and believable story with a soul.

I had the chance to see this on a double bill with Liam Neeson in TAKEN, and it so happens that they are exactly the same movie, presented in exactly the same way.  Both films depend on the continually postponed deflowering of an underage girl, and the plot of each revolved around the efforts of the hero to prevent this from happening.  So both stories becomes one man against the underworld of the gang, gangs grown rich by preying on the need of sinister, jaded men for the flesh of the young girl.  Life is a crusade against sexual sin led by Dev Patel on the one hand, Liam Neeson on the other.  This crusade allows and encourages violence of all sorts, in the name of protecting the girl.  I expect this feeds into real life violence perpetuating purity.  I enjoyed TAKEN though, while SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE is unredeemable and condescending filmmaking which even AR Rahman's energetic score can't pretty up.",1244160000,2,1187,4.514018691588785

3745979,3,B001P9KR94,"I tried hard to resist this film. Anything that bombards me with so much incredible press I find suspicious. Example? The Da Vinci code: with everyone and their mother talking to me about it I resisted reading it for months until I finally gave in. The difference between Slumdog Millionaire and the Da Vinci Code? I actually enjoyed Slumdog.

Despite myself I was thoroughly engaged, entertained, and delighted by the film. I still found myself put off by the constant talk about it everywhere-- I mean, comparing this film to such intense dramas such as Milk and The Wrestler?? Come on-- but really, deep down, I definitely enjoyed this movie. It is the epitome of the ""feel good"" film. Everything, from the end credits to the cinematography to the acting to the music, spins together to create a great and enjoyable film.

The current controversy surrounding the situation of the child actors in the film really raises awareness to the child poverty issue that is really at the heart of the film. While the film is ultimately ""feel good"" it is important not to ignore the whole ""slum dog"" topic that is often skirted aside by the uplifting ending.

The idea of this game show being imported to a poverty stricken and turbulent area and changing lives may seem far-fetched to some, but after seeing a preview screening of a documentary called Afghan Star (which focuses on Afghanistan's version of American Idol) the topic is much more believable in my mind. Afghan Star mirrors many of the scenes in Slumdog Millionaire that were often the most interesting, but this time for real-- people in rural villages crowded around small televisions in tiny rural and barren towns, families rigging up antennas to be able to catch the show in time, and a nation that ignores its problems for brief moments to come together and cheer for an underdog to change their lives on a reality show. Because of the real people at the heart of this film I found Afghan Star ultimately more moving and deep, and it also addresses the greater issues at work in the country from the turbulent politics to the social changes at work in the country.

Slumdog Millionaire is still a great feel-good film that really so many people can enjoy and, at the same time, be exposed to another culture along the way!",1243900800,4,2285,4.733668341708543

Without parents, they do whatever it takes to survive in a world.  Younger one, Jamal becomes a contestant on indian version of the show ""Who wants to be a millionaire?"".  Show seems to be the only way to conquer poverty an destitute for a young man with no education or any other prospects.

Jamal is kidnapped by a local police nad subjected to brutal interrogation in attempt to find out how he cheated,  It is during this interrogation that becomes obvious that events in this young man's life seem to have led to his knowledge on all answers to his questions.

3746008,5,B001P9KR94,"Whenever I watch Jeopardy or Who Wants to be a Millionaire, I always hope for questions from the following categories: computers, Chicago Bears, The Karate Kid, internet videos, Yo Momma jokes, and famous midgets.  I'm sure I'd win it all.  It never happens, of course, and there ends up being questions about Zoroastrianism, famous European architecture, or Finnish lakes.  For one Indian slumdog, however, the stars align.

A young man, Jamal, is a contestant on the Indian version of ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire"", and he's quickly turning into an improbable Ken Jennings-like participant with a nation of cheering .  He simply cannot lose, and none of the game-show or police officials, who torture him, believe he's doing it legitimately; they're willing to beat him in order to prove that he's cheating.  Time and time again, however, Jamal unfolds exhilarating tales of how he has answered the seemingly impossible questions, and proves through flashbacks that his difficult, poverty-stricken life filled with the pressure of both the impossible rags-to-riches life of urban Mumbai, India, but also a criminal element constantly grasping at his shoestrings, has provided him with a lot more knowledge than anyone could believe.

Together with his brother Salim - who drifts towards the criminal element rather than living a more difficult ethical life - and the only woman he has ever loved, Latika, the three form as children their own version of the Three Musketeers.  When hardship causes them to separate multiple times in life, it's love that eventually brings Jamal back to his brother, and eventually Latika.  When he improbably ends up on the game-show, he realizes it is his best, and possibly last, chance at a dream life with Latika.

Very rarely does a highly touted film actually deserve the praise Hollywood bestows upon it.  In the case of Slumdog Millionaire, I'd say that for a welcome change, the praise is warranted.  The story itself is enthralling; there is intense drama, excellent acting, and a total package that brings about heartbreaking emotion.  Comparable to several movies, I'd say this most closely resembles an Indian Romeo and Juliet, but with a less tragic ending.

Of course, it doesn't hurt that Latika is adorable as a child and breathtakingly beautiful as an adult but this just the way Hollywood used to do it.  The plot may be the oldest in the world but the use of the Millionaire show makes it fresh.

On top of this, the movie is extraordinarily well put together.  An entire story, told in flashbacks yet not at all confusing.  Perfectly paced too, with the suspense building to that final cell phone call.

Was it the best movie of the year? Not really.  But perhaps, just as the stars aligned for Jamal, audiences were ready for a break from the mostly vulgar chick flicks, prequels, comic books and Armageddon that Hollywood shovels at us.

I'd almost go for 5 stars but for one misstep.  Everyone I talk to remarks about the children being tortured.  Of course one can't overcome evil if there is no evil, but this is not the thing people should take away from this uplifting film.",1241740800,,1036,4.516129032258065

Jamal goes from child to man, and still manages to remain pure and idealistic, despite all of the temptations.

When he is being tortured (interrogated) and asked 'What does a slumdog know', he said, the answers. It is more like, he knows the value of love and clings to it, even in the slums. From the episode in the crapper, where he will do anything to earn a living, and also get the autograph of his favorite Bollywood star, to the way his mother sacrifices herself, to the way he repays the little girl for helping them by making her a third 'Musketeer', he holds on to love no matter what.

By contrast we have Salim, his brother, only out for himself, and selfdestructive with it. He is the true slumdog, not willing to work an honest job, acting as a pimp to the poor girl Jamal tries to rescue because he has always loved her, and so full of hate he kills without compunction.  Only at the end does he show he is able to love but by then it is too late.

This film has layers like an onion and some great performances by young actors, but it is not jolly happy viewing, with rape, torture, maiming, and every other crime and inhumanity to man you can think of.

I know Bollywood films and I really like them. This feat of boredom has nothing to do with Bollywood. It's nothing but a silly attempt to gratify Westerners by exploring every stupid prejudice about India.

It is self-evident, of course, that the current recession is the biggest reason behind this film's popularity.

3746037,4,B001P9KR94,"Charles Dickens' novel ""Oliver Twist,"" with its child protagonist and portrayal of criminals - their sordid lives in London's Victorian slums, and their exploitation of children, was made into a very successful musical motion picture, ""Oliver."" Slumdog Millionaire"" reminds me of a British-Bollywood version of ""Oliver."" Like ""Oliver"" it romanticizes the terrible poverty of children who are left alone to live and die by their wits. Just as ""Oliver"" had more than a few extremely dramatic moments, some difficult to watch, ""Slumdog"" follows suit. Primarily, however, both films are made to be more entertainment than social commentary.

Eighteen year-old Jamal Malik, (Dev Patel), is a ""chai wallah,""  who serves tea to employees at a Bombay call center. Unbelievably, he manages to get himself on the popular game show, ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,"" as a contestant. Although literate, Jamal has no formal education. However he mysteriously manages to answer all the difficult questions put to him by the show's egocentric host, Prem Kumar, (Anil Kapoor). It seems like all of India is watching to see if the young man, originally from the slums of Darvi, will answer the final question correctly, an answer which would net him 20 million rupees. The show ends with the promise of an even greater audience and more tension the following evening, when Jamal makes his final, and hopefully winning, appearance.

The film begins with a scene of a Mumbai policeman torturing Jamal. The young man is beaten, waterboarded, shocked with electricity, you name it. Superimposed on the screen is a multiple choice question with four possible answers. ""Jamal Malik is one question away from winning the jackpot. How did he do it? (A) He cheated, (B) He's lucky, (C) He's a genius, (D) It is written."" This is the same format as the ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire"" questions. Mr. Kumar reported Jamal to the police on suspicion of cheating. After all, how could a slumdog know the answers to questions which have stumped doctors, lawyers, even Ph. Ds?  Finally, after an exhaustive interrogation, the police chief believes that Jamal may be legit, and asks him to tell how he acquired his knowledge.

Thus, Jamal takes the viewer on an adventure...on many, many exhilarating, terrifying adventures. For every question asked on the show, Jamal has experienced a life event which gives him the wisdom needed to respond correctly. There are frequent flashbacks to his childhood, and these flashbacks are what I most enjoyed about the film. These scenes include the vast, colorful, impoverished hell of the Darvi slums, where he and his older brother, Salim, were born and try to survive. Adorable scamps, Ayush Mahesh Khedekar, as young Jamal, and Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail, as older brother Salim, run with a crowd of children who inflict mayhem on their surroundings. Their energy is so contagious, that one focuses more on the baby hooligans' activities, mostly illegal,  than on their terrible way of life. In one instance, the camera pans out, and from high above the filthy slums look like a colorful patchwork quilt.

The boys witness their mother's murder by a group of marauding, anti-Muslim hating fanatics. Left on their own, they meet another orphan in similar straights, Latika, a shy and lovely girl. (Rubina Ali plays the child, Freida Pinto the teenager). They call themselves the ""Three Musketeers."" Together they hitch a ride on a train and are thrown off in Agra India, the home of the Taj Mahal. The boys, after a few days listening to guides, improvise an improbable history of the fabulous monument, and show gullible European tourists around, earning enough money to live on.

The three children are eventually discovered by a Fagin-like character, the brutal gangster Maman, (Ankur Vikal). He and his cronies tell Jamal, Salim and Latika that they run a comfortable orphanage  and convince the kids to go with them. In fact, Maman collects street children and trains them to beg for money. He cruelly has some of them blinded and crippled so they can earn more money on the streets. Salim, who is being groomed for bigger things, sees one of the children being deformed and he and Jamal escape before Jamal can be treated in a similar manner. Through an ""accident,"" as Jamal is led to believe, Latika is left behind. Jamal never forgets her. He loved her as a child and will continue to love her as a man. His obsession is to find her. It is his destiny. Salim's destiny is quite different.

To avoid spoilers, I won't continue to summarize the plot. I will say that I loved the extraordinary energy of the film and the wonderfully lavish colors, of the clothing, landscapes and characters. There are so many rags to riches fairytales out there, but this one is special. The last musical number, ""Jai Ho"" is outstanding - a great song and memorable choreography! The acting, by a relatively unknown cast, is usually excellent and the pace is fast.

Screenwriter, Simon Beaufoy adapted the story from the novel ""Q & A,"" (2005) by Indian author and diplomat Vikas Swarup. Beaufoy has expressed his joy at developing and introducing so many different genres and mini-tales within the overall story. Director Danny Boyle earned himself a 2008 Academy Award for Best Director and ""Slumdog Millionaire"" won for best picture.

My only complaint is that the adult characters of Jamal and Latika seem flat and detached. I also think the movie could be improved upon by eliminating the romance, which I felt was a bit cliched and confused. Underdog, slumdog, Jamal is a BIG winner & that is so upbeat...but does he need to be a millionaire to finally win the girl?

3746040,4,B001P9KR94,"Mumbai, a frenetic metropolis and home to 14 or 15 million inhabitants, certainly boasts its share of glitz and glitter. It is the entertainment and commercial capital of India. It is home to Bollywood. But flip that coin over and you'll find the less glamourous side, that Mumbai also happens to be the site of some pretty deplorable living conditions. The poverty and squalor - and the quality of life attached to that - are horrific. And I guess it makes the ideal backdrop for SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE, a film of seemingly relentless bleakness but a film which ultimately champions hope, love, destiny, and the tenacity of the human spirit.

The plot is this: Improbably, Jamal Malik (Dev Patel), an uneducated young chai wallah (tea server) from the slums of Mumbai, is one correct answer away from winning it all on the Indian version of the game show Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? But time runs out for that evening's episode and the flabbergasted audience must wait one more evening to see if Jamal can win the big prize. But Jamal is arrested and tortured, on the suspicion of cheating. Because how can a mere slumdog advance so far in the quiz show when even scholars before him have all failed ignominiously?

The conceit of the movie lies in that each of Jamal's responses to the game show questions ties into a significant moment in his past. As Jamal reluctantly explains to the Mumbai police, the film flashes back to his painful childhood in the Mumbai slums. In the past, we meet his older brother Salim, a bully and avaricious and who soon becomes jealous of Jamal's close friendship with the young orphaned girl Latika. We see these three endure tragic life-changing experiences, as Jamal, Salim, and Latika claw out an existence by begging, stealing, and hustling naive tourists. Down the years, the three separate and reunite several times. Yet one thing never changes. Jamal keeps faith, believing that he and Latika are destined to be together. And that is the heart of the film.

Based on Vikas Swarup's novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Q-A-A-Novel/dp/0743267486/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Q & A: A Novel</a>, SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE is graced with dazzling technical mastery. Danny Boyle directs it and makes the thing accessible for western eyes. And, yet, the film does still feature a few of the core elements so favored by Indian cinema. Most notable is the gulf between classes, with the lead character so lowborn that when he achieves something seemingly beyond his capability, his integrity is promptly doubted and he is brutalized. Also regard the sweeping, star-crossed romance, that theme of love surmounting all odds, most definitely a staple of Bollywood's. And, while SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE is by no means a musical, Danny Boyle couldn't resist putting in an exuberant dance number ""Jai Ho,"" staged during the closing credits.

The story is solid, the hook is good. The film looks visually charged. It's sharply edited, with awesome cinematography, with the cameras capturing the bustle and energy and vibrancy of Mumbai, whether the focus is on the slums or on the city's rapid phases of globalization. The pulsating soundtrack contributes to the emotional texture of the thing (although I laughed when ""Aaj Ki Raat"" from DON came out, since I just saw DON again very recently). The actors are marvelous, with Dev Patel strong as the central character. The film covers three stages in Jamal's life, when he was roughly 7, 13, and 18. The children who play Jamal, Salim, and Latika are terrific, particularly Ayush Mahesh Khedekar and Rubina Ali, who are very moving as Jamal and Latika at seven years of age. There is one moment which crystallizes Jamal's personality to the audience and young Ayush pulls it off perfectly, this being the outhouse scene and what Jamal goes thru to nab an autograph from his Bollywood idol Amitabh Bachchan. Really, from that point on, you're totally on this kid's side. SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE is essentially a flashback film, with the game show sequences used as a framing device. And, ultimately, it's the honest performances of the children which hooks you in. Fair warning, there are some very disturbing scenes played out during these kids' time on screen.

Two other actors make an impact. One is veteran Bollywood actor Anil Kapoor and his trademark mustache. He plays the smug game show host, himself born out of the slums and who doesn't want Jamal to win the game and upstage him. Meanwhile, Freida Pinto makes an auspicious debut as the present-day Latika. She doesn't really have a lot of scenes or a lot of lines, compared to Dev Patel, but she makes them count. Freida Pinto is stunning. She has a presence and flashes such an utterly winning smile that the film flashes back to it several times. With her as Latika, I get how Jamal just never wavers in his efforts to reunite with her. Although, to be fair, Jamal fell in love with Latika before she grew up to look like Freida Pinto.

What I have is the single disc version, with the following special features: the Making of the Film featurette (23 minutes long); 12 deleted scenes, all worth watching and key to filling in several gaps in the film - definitely check out ""The Folder,"" which reveals why the Police Inspector dealt with Jamal in the way he did; two audio commentaries, one with Director Danny Byole & actor Dev Patel, the other with producer Christian Colson & screenplay writer Simon Beaufoy; and the ""Slumdog Cutdown"" segment, which basically is a series of scenes from the film serving as a synopsis and set to the exhilarating song ""Jai Ho.""

As someone who's watched Indian cinema for a few years now, I'm so happy this film came out and I hope that it'll whet the appetites of more westerners, intrigue them enough so that they dip their toe into Bollywood films or Tamil films or Telugu. But if you're not sure yet and you're looking for a more accessible intro to Indian cinema, you should probably check out frothier films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bride-and-Prejudice/dp/B00094AS9U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bride and Prejudice</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Other-End-of-the-Line-Widescreen/dp/B001RP974C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Other End of the Line (Widescreen)</a>. Word to the wise, the Indian film industries tend to produce films which lean towards the more colorful, exuberant, and unabashedly over-the-top and sentimental, so prep yourself if you want to indulge in the real thing.

SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE ended up winning a busload of Oscar awards, and justifiably so. In this film's depiction of the state of things with the poorer masses, I quote from a slumdog in the film as he is about to get trounced by the Indian constabulary in front of American tourists: ""You wanted to see a bit of the real India - here it is!"" SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE shows not all, but only a bit of the real India. Still, it's become one of those films which should linger in the brain for some bit of time.",1241568000,2,7378,5.205387205387205

However, after watching it for myself, I can honestly say this is the first fresh and innovative movie I have seen in at least a decade. It doesn't follow the well-worn Hollywood conventions and stereotypes. The acting is heartwarming, not mushy. The characters take interesting and unexpected twists.

The movie also teaches Western audiences (most of whom have never been to the slums of a developing country) about the struggles of life as a ""slumdog"" without lecturing or moralizing. In fact, at times, the movie turns heartbreaking situations into heartwarming ones. For example, in one scene, a little boy wants to see a famous movie star but is locked in a run-down outhouse, so he runs out of the outhouse, through the waste, and asks for the movie star's autograph while he is covered in poop.

It is a unique masterpiece that grabs the viewer on several levels: the story, the setting, the acting and the cinematography.

It seems impossible to believe that he would have the kind of knowledge to answer a wide assortment of questions that clearly would appear to be outside his scope of experience.

Orphaned at a very young age when their mother is brutally murdered, Jamal and his older brother Salim, survive amidst trash dumps. Their lives are brutally harsh and made more so when they become ensnared by a professional gang of beggars, and later when they do what they must to eke out a living.  Yet in each vignette of their lives something occurs that provides Jamal with the critical knowledge he uses later on the TV program.

The value for me in watching this movie was to remind me of how well we treat one another in America compared to a relatively poor country like India where the accepted behavior is to treat those of a lower class with distain and unworthiness.

First things first: Danny Boyle knows how to put a story on the big screen (the druggish underworld of Trainspotting and the spaced out sci/fi/psych thriller Sunshine are proof of this). S.M. is shot artfully and acted out reasonably well. Somehow, Slumdog misses the mark. It tries to tug at your heart but pushes you away instead. (SPOILER ALERT!) A boy covered in feces is gross; an orphan being maimed is sadistic and telling the poor that your only shot at success is by winning a game show (magically predestined) is insulting.
I could forgive these mis-steps if the emotions conveyed actually affected me. The stunningly beautiful Freida Pinto and D. Patel should have delivered fireworks. Instead, we get sappy sereotypical moments that fizzle. To its credit, this film aims high.

The scenes in the slums of Bombay are such a contrast from what most of us in the United States are used to that they are hard to watch without wanting to do something to help those poor children. What a hellish world those children and adults have to live in everyday.

3746101,5,B001P9KR94,"I just watched ""Slumdog millionaire"" and was definitely impressed by the movie. Since I am originally from India so, I am aware of most of what is shown in the movie. So this might have taken away some of the impact that Boyle tries to deliver.

Is the movie Oscar worthy? I would say, it deserved oscars for 7 out of the 8 categories except for best picture(which I thought The reader should have won).Danny Boyle has done a wonderful job in directing this movie and has captured a slice of India very well. The screenplay and the writing is terrific and the scenes seamlessly fit in the plot. Some people feel that he has wrongly portrayed India as a poor country. But as a film maker he has a right to choose a segment of India and make a movie about it. Yes, what you see only part of Indian life. India is a country where there are palaces and slums side by side. When someone makes a movie about King kakaka with lavishing palaces etc, no one would complain about the movie wrongly portraying India as such a rich country.

A.R.Rahman has done a wonderful job, as usual. A lot of people feel that this is not his best work and he has done better. But we are talking about the original score here and NOT the actual songs. The score certainly delivered the knock out punch and had a tremendous impact throughout the movie. As far as the best song goes, yes Rahman has done better. But ""Jai ho"" was the perfect feel good song to finish off the climax. The academy was definitely unjust towards Bruce Springsteen for not nominating the song from ""The Wrestler"". Among the nominations ""Jai ho"" certainly deserved the honor.

Dev Patel, Freida Pinto, Irfan Khan and Anil Kapoor have done a good job but nothing spectacular. The real stellar performances come from the kids who really set up this movie to stand tall.

Overall, a great movie by Danny Boyle!",1240012800,2,1857,4.469026548672566
3746102,3,B001P9KR94,"You know.... Movies are an art form, and like any art form taste is a personal thing. I reluctantly watched Slumdog Millionaire, as my wife insisted due to the overwhelming high praise lavished on this film, and while it isn't the worst movie I've seen, it wasn't really my cup of cocoa.

For me it had a few issues, for one thing for a movie about some Islamic characters, it was an ironically, Hindu tale in that it was heavy in Karma, but that may be quibbling. More to the point, it was so depressing and violent. Not action movie violent, but sadistic and disgustingly violent. As a movie about India, it is not much of a tourist invitation.

What did work for me was the overall message about why would someone be murderous in the name of religion? That the events of your life for good or ill, make up who you are.
That true love should win in the end.

As for the rest of it... The metaphors were largely lost on me, and the stupid American bit who buys away all trouble, was a bit ham fisted. The music video during the credits... I guess that's a cultural diversity educational bit.

So were there things to admire about the film? Yes.
Was it the film of the year? Not for me.",1239926400,,1186,4.28125
3746103,4,B001P9KR94,"I have read a few reviews that bashed Slumdog, and though I see a point to them, I LOVE this film. I have lived in Faridabad ( just outside of Deli), and have firsthand seen some of the things the film touched on. In the spirit of Mira Nair, Boyle opens ones eyes to this incredible country, but he doesn't sugar coat things like most Bollywood films ( which are basically musicals, some with depth others that are laughable but enjoyable nonetheless).
Slumdog divulges what real India is like: a fight for survival, but one that has moments of beauty in it as well. Again, MOMENTS. The amount of children MUTILATED and forced by parents and others to work is disgusting. It is beyond belief. I was in the Deli area, and that has nothing on Calcutta or some of the bad areas of Mumbai.
And despite this, one can see a beauty in these people that simply does not exist in the West. One brief scene ( SPOILER) in the movie when Dev is about to play the last round of Millionare, a woman on the street taps on his window and says 'go and win it all'. THIS type of genuine 'I'm happy for you', aka namaste, aka respect exists amongst the dire poverty.
And then Slumdog dives into the Muslim-Hindu tension. In the kashmir region, fighting is horrendous. This type of confusion, dislike, and sometimes hatred exists between these two religions, and now with the recent terrorist attacks, things aren't looking too good.
Slumdog Millionaire shows how hard working, diligent, determined, and driven many ( most) Indians are in their fight to survive and feed themselves/their families. The main character has to do this from when he was born, which is a sad reality for many infants/kids there.
THE FILM IS ARTISTIC, FAST PACED AND TYPICAL BOYLE STYLE, WITH A GREAT SOUNDTRACK.

If you like highly predictable and highly improbable feel good stories, then this is right up your alley.  For me, it was the definition of a mediocre movie: good enough to hold my attention, but not good enough to really suck me in and make me care about the movie's world or its characters.  It had a couple of memorable scenes, but it was ultimately a forgettable two hours for me.

I also find it highly ironic that many have said the ending somewhat redeemed an otherwise boring film.  I'll agree that the movie slowed down and became somewhat boring, but the ending only made things worse in my eyes.  The director takes the easy way out, ending the film in the most predictable way possible.  And then there is the closing credits sequence -- I'm shaking my head now, just from envisioning it.  Absolutely terrible.

Through thick and thin, good vs evil and against the odds, this film takes us on a visual and audio journey within India to prove that sometimes, hope and love prevail. Is it a masterpiece? No. It's clever filmmaking from an atypical novel, shown to us in a way that explodes the senses.

Story-wise, it's okay; good, but nothing super. For the first half of the film, it reminded me of ""City Of God,"" about the homeless kids in Brazil, but that film had far more violent kids. This one mainly had kids as pranksters and then victims of some sicko adult who wants to use them to make money.

The story will be fun for those who used to be hooked on the ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire"" quiz show. Almost all of the story is told in flashback, so be prepared for that. It's one of those stories where all the little pieces fit together in the end to explain why things happened in the start of the film.

Compounding the problem are the colored backgrounds on which the subtitles appear, some of which blend in with the background.

While ""Slumdog"" does rate very high in my own personal ""academy"", I really don't feel that it deserved the best picture award. Don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoyed this film, but I did find some of it's premises to be strectching it in terms of reality and believability.

The acting, by all players young, old and not-so-old, is highly commendable, especially some of the younger talent, which I have learned had little to no acting experience. The story, although a little too unrealistic in some parts, is well-written and told with a sort-of ""flashback"" methodology which I found to be different and refreshing. The ending, although a bit sappy, is uplifting. I was sooooo thankful that they saved the big ""dance number"" for the credits (I know it's the ""in"" thing to do in Bollywood, but in this film it would have seemed completely silly and ruined the feel of the whole thing).

All in all, a VERY good film, but to me, it shouldn't have been picture of the year. My personal vote was for ""Gran Torino"".

There is a bit of violence (some graphic, some not so much) and just a smattering of foul language, but because of the overall adult theme of the show, I recommend you keep the kiddies away.",1239580800,,1359,4.603305785123967

First, like others, I'd heard all the hype, and just last night my wife brought it in and we watched it...

I can honestly say for my part, with all the awards it got, I was thinking prior to seeing it, could it really be that good?

Well now having seen it, I have to say it definitely is!  I thought the filming was exceptional and the scenery was incredible!  I've traveled a bit in my time on this floating sod of earth and I've always been amazed when in what are referred to as (Third World Countries), the people can have so little and still seem to be happy with life.  Well not all of them but this movie delves into the underside of humanity also and although repulsive and shocking to some, it unfortunately is a reality as well and very graphically depicted in this film.

It jumps back and forth but it is very cleverly put together so that it all makes completely sense as it unfolds.  I don't want to say more and spoil it for those that haven't seen it, but if you have ever wanted to see another country or the country of India, if you can't get there, this is a film that will take you there!  And I thought the acting was superb!

We rented the movie.

I will definitely buy this movie having seen it now and I truly think it is one of the most amazing films, I've ever seen or that has ever been made!

Hat's off to everyone who made this project come to life and it's deserving, (Again in my opinion) of all the praise and then some!

The story of the main character, as told through a series of flashbacks during a vicious police torture session, is as compelling as it is brutal especially to American audiences unfamiliar with the realities of India's deep religious and ethnic rifts. In addition, the superb stagecraft by Boyle and his talented cast and crew gives the viewer a palpable sense of the depth of poverty from which the characters emerge, something very alien and most likely unbelievable to suburban Americans who consider a ten-hour power outage something akin to living in caves. The true beauty of this film, however, is the steely resilience and imaginative machinations once the children are orphaned and forced to eke out a living in spite of ""considerable"" obstacles. This movie will move you in ways you've never imagined. It left my wife and I exhausted by the magnitude of the forces overcome and it also left us in a puddle of tears.  ps- I NEVER cry at movies <wink>",1239321600,,1067,4.798913043478261
3746123,3,B001P9KR94,"""Slumdog Milionaire"" is definitely a feel-good movie - from early on,young Jamal [Dev Patel] wins our hearts as he desperately tries to find his childhood sweetheart Latika [Freida Pinto] by entering the Indian version of ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"" Incredulous and sceptical of Jamal's intelligence [after all, Jamal is a 'slumdog'], the show's host [Anil Kapoor] gets him carted off by the police for interrogation. Faced by the cynical inspector [Irfan Khan of ""Namesake""], Jamal proceeds to convince the policeman of his innocence by recounting his childhood experiences till the present that accounts for his almost miraculous run of good luck on the show.

I loved the child actors in this show - the ones who played Jamal, his brother Salim and Latika as children were absolutely incredible and wholly credible as street children struggling to survive, falling prey to the most predatory and repugnant of criminals, those who maim children in order that the kids may 'convincingly' beg on the streets to fill the criminals coffers. One of the most horrifying scenes in this movie is the part where the criminal mastermind watches over the removal of a little boy's eyes.

So why only 3 stars you may ask - I liked this movie a lot but I did find that it didn't truly explore the plight of street children which it purportedly aims to portray on-screen. The coverage somehow seems shallow, using the story arc of the child maiming syndicate to shock audiences instead. Perhaps this is due to the fact that I've watched too many Indian movies that deal more convincingly with such themes - ""Nayagan"" [Tamil, starring Kamal Hasan, a renowned South Indian actor], Thalapathi [Tamil, stars Rajni Kanth], the incomparable Salaam Bombay [1988,Hindi by Mira Nair], and also City of Joy [1992, English, starring Patrick Swayze] all are more credible in showing the plight of street children.

""Slumdog Millionaire"" on the other hand is a Bollywood fairytale with a predictably happy ending. It makes one feel good, and in a world filled with cruelty and depravity, most of us are happy to see the fulfillment of Jamal's dreams. But reality is very different, and the majority of street children in India will never experience even a fraction of the success that Jamal attains in this movie. Final verdict: excellent and visually stunning escapist fare.",1239321600,7,2355,5.017902813299233
3746124,5,B001P9KR94,"""Slumdog Millionaire"" is not for the faint of heart. Part heart-wrenching story of predestined love: So it is written, so it shall be; part gruesomely enlightening history lesson on the lives of the inhabitants of the slums of India, the movie draws you into the lives of its mesmerizing characters and does not release its hold on you. Not when the movie ends. Not for a long, long time. This movie stays with you, maybe longer than you want it to...  That, to me, is the mark of a great movie.",1239321600,2,495,4.43956043956044
3746125,5,B001P9KR94,"""Slumdog Millionaire"" is a bilingual British-Indian production based on the novel ""Q & A"" by Loveleen Tandan, which I understand has been modified considerably be screenwriter Simon Beaufoy. Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) is an 18-year-old tea-server originally from the slums of Mumbai. In an attempt to reach the woman he loves (Freida Pinto), he becomes a contestant on the Indian version of ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"". He gets so close to the grand prize of 20 million rupees that he is suspected of cheating and arrested. He tries to convince a jaded police inspector (Irfan Khan) that he really did know the answer to the questions by recounting the episodes in his life from which he learned them.

This is an optimistic romance that is coy about being either of those things most of the time. It generates a lot of energy but has a startling edge. The audience is hit full force with Jamal's violent life as a street child. Shifts back and forth in time, between Jamal's interrogation, his appearance on the show, and his recollections of years past can be jarring at first. But the frenetic energy of it all matches that of the slums and of life on the run for Jamal and his brother Salim. Irfan Khan can play any role, and he is terrific here as a detective whose patience is wearing thin but whose curiosity gets the better of him, even though he's not such a nice guy.

There have been a lot of sleazy characters in Jamal's life, and the film is populated with them. Jamal is the proverbial nice guy from the wrong side of the tracks who has been hindered by circumstances and unscrupulous people. Yet he is savvy and single-minded. His brother Salim (Madhur Mittal) is almost Jamal's alter-ego, a bully who chose a life of crime to get ahead. But he is equally savvy and single-minded, with a different value system. The love-hate relationship between the two men brings a lot of substance to the story. ""Slumdog Millionaire""'s amalgamation of gritty reality, upbeat rhythms, and clichd optimism make it a unique, enjoyable experience.

8. All the kids are healthy looking with nice teeth.
7. Latika experiences no sexual abuse!

4. After step five the contestant does not lose ""everything"" with a wrong answer.
3. The questions were in chronological order of his life!
2. Police in India TORTURE people if they think they're cheating TV shows?
1. Giving a $100 bill to Arvind would be giving it to the hated men who blinded him.

Additionally I wonder:

Did the copyright owners of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"" okay this?  I mean, would Regis Philbin or Meredith Vieira try to cheat a contestant?  Would the producers want a ratings sensation to lose?

Is it okay to celebrate a movie that entertains the privileged with a rose-colored view of poverty and overpopulation?

Good, however, is a City of God/Bollywood/fairytale film made for the poor of India.  Only problem is this film just exploits them by water coloring over the squalor of their wretched lives.  And, incidentally, by the way things are going, there is an enormous mountain of poverty to come worldwide, degrading much of humanity.

(But, hey, I just got the DVD to be entertained.  I don't need to hear about the troubles of the world.)",1239235200,3,1628,4.670175438596491

The only part that touched me at all, was fearing that boy would drop that baby if the little girl wouldn't take her.
other than what, it was a waste of time.
If you like these sort of odd love stories, flashbacks and whatever else, it may be good. But in all honestly, it was boring.

3746129,4,B001P9KR94,"Someone in the movie calls Jamal's story ""bizarrely plausible"" and I would have to agree. The story is basically structured in a way that if one thing had happened differently in Jamal's life he wouldn't have be able to answer all the questions on Who Wants to Be A Millionaire. While nothing in life ever works like that I think it made a really nice story.

Basically the movie was exactly what I thought it would be. It was good but I wouldn't call it great. I heard from tons of people how wonderful it was but also from a few friends (who have similar tastes) who said it was good but not THE BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME, and I would have to agree with them. While I liked the movie I think The Curious Case of Benjamin Button should have gone home with the Oscar, that movie blew me away.

While I liked the structure of the story I did have problems with it. I liked the relationship between Jamal and Latika but felt when they met up towards the end of the movie we should have seen some more proof of their chemistry, I wasn't totally convinced. And the ending, the actual ending (with illustrated credits etc) that totally changed the mood of the movie and I thought was a bit uncalled for.

Slumdog Millionaire was a good movie but not really as emotionally empactful as other movies I'v seen. A lot of people are commenting on how hard some of the scenes were to watch, I was waiting for it to rise above movies like The Kite Runner, City of God, and Tsotsi, compared to those movies Slumddog Millionaire was a cake walk to watch. Also, I was disappointed that it was mostly in English. I know I'm coming off as a total film snob, sorry. I really felt the need to nitpick this one. But don't get me wrong I did enjoy and like the movie!

3746165,3,B001P9KR94,"Slumdog Millionare is a good film, but it is also a very overrated film, and a rather simplistic one.  There are some amazing things in it, but there are some incredibly dull ones as well.

Like all of Danny Boyle's films, there is some truly astonishing imagery in this film.  The shots of Mumbai's slums are brilliantly shot (the cinematographer, Anthony Dod Mantle, deservedly won an Oscar for his work).  Boyle and company deserve kudos for these scenes, as they are rarely seen in feature filmmaking, and are hardly ever seen in contemporary Bollywood films.  There is also a scene where the children go to an opera, and steal wallets and purses from under the bleachers.  This scene is achingly beautiful, and I wish it was longer.  There are many shots like that in this film.  Boyle has always had an amazing eye, especially in Trainspotting and 28 Days Later.  But too often Boyle dazzles us with eye candy, and his films end up being unrelenting hollow, and Slumdog Millionare is no exception.

The script of this film is predictable and, especially in the 2nd half of the film, surprisingly boring.  There is a love story at the heart of the film, and it feels forced, like it doesn't belong there, like the filmmakers insisted that it have some sort of love story in it, like typical Bollywood films do.  The dialogue is very forgettable, and the characters (except for Dev Patel's character) are cartoonish and very one note.  Boyle's array of dazzling images suddenly disappears in the 2nd half when he concentrates on the love story, and he's left with just the story, which is very uncompelling, even though it should be.  The motivation of the TV host is also strange, as it doesn't make any real sense other than to give the story an unnecessary twist.

Most of the performances are adequate, but the best one is by Dev Patel.  While he has the classic Bollywood look, you do believe that his character was raised in the slums, and he has a certain anger and sadness that makes you feel for him.  One of the most fascinating things about this film is the jarring (intentionally) juxaposition between Patel's interrogation (he's tortured by the police rather brutally), Patel's life in the slums (which is all done in flashback), and the slick, hollowness of the TV show Who Wants to be a Millionare?.  It works very well, but it's predominantly in the first half, and the 2nd half is much more conventional and quite staid by comparison.

The musical score is quite good, especially the end credits song/dance, which is one of the highlights of the film.

I think this is another Best Picture Oscar winner that people will question in future years.  Too often the Oscars is not about which is really the best film of the year, but about politics (like great directors like Scorsese winning for mediocre films like The Departed instead of winning for Goodfellas, a true masterpiece), and/or momentum (Slumdog Millionare's wins were all about having momentum and riding a tide, so to speak).  It's not a bad movie at all, but it really is not a fantastic film by any stretch of the imagination.  I would say it's definitely worth seeing, but it isn't a masterpiece.",1239062400,2,3181,4.7228260869565215

3746167,4,B001P9KR94,"It's an amazing thing when you hear of a movie that has been hyped to death actually being worthy of the hoopla.  This is one of them, and quite an unlikely entry from Danny Boyle in that we see a simple love story.  Up till now, Mr. Boyle hasn't gone for the cheaply sentimental, and while there are plenty of opportunities to go in that direction with ""Slumdog,"" it never gets too treacly.

How he does that is the conceat of the storytelling.  Split between Jamal's gritty backstory of a childhood in the the slums of Mumbai is the glitzy tension of him compeating in the Indian version of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?""  A rags to riches story this is, but Jamal has come up from the absolute bottom to the very top of winning it all, and stays basically a good guy motivated by the right things.  Namely the love of his life whom he's known since childhood.  Boyle takes an unflinching look at life in the slums of India's megacities, and this keeps us grounded.  The youngsters picked to play the characters as children have great heart, which can be pretty heartbraking when you see how they keep their innocence in such dark surroundings.  Some Indian citizens claim the depiction of Mumbai is too negative, but this can be a good thing in showing one's country as well.  After all, we can see the good touristy things in a travelogue.  We can experience a country by seeing all sides of it.

Boyle even throws an homage to the musical numbers common in the the Hindi/Marsala Bollywood productions in the end credits.  A simple trope which works wonders, capping an exuberant ending to a well-done film.",1239062400,,1613,4.539792387543253

But the story, if considered rationally, is not believable at all.  The accents are sometimes difficult to understand.  The English subtitles are difficult to see on the small screen.

For better or worse, I'm very much a ""Westerner"" -- Scots-Irish, English -- and India, while a fascinating country, I'm sure, seems to be one of such extremes -- from poverty to wealth, that -- well, let's just say it's not a country I've wanted to visit -- and I'm still not sure -- assuming I could -- would want to.

3746173,3,B001P9KR94,"I have great respect for Danny Boyle, even though I've disliked or felt indifference for most of his films, with the exception of ""Trainspotting"". His latest film, ""Slumdog Millionaire"", is undeniably enjoyable.  Each member of the cast was excellent, Boyle himself was in top form, and the plot was well-constructed.  However, I felt that the film lacked any real sense of social commentary on the issue of poverty.

Poverty in the East, and certainly in India, is a gruesome and desperate state that most people in the Western world can barely fathom.  ""Slumdog"" never truly addresses this problem.  Based on the conversations I've had with people who enjoyed this film, most of them are struck by the horrendous living conditions of the three main characters only momentarily, and then their shock is seemingly swept away by the inspirational ending.  Poverty and its effects of disease, illiteracy, desperate hunger, and social exclusion does not seem to resonate with many viewers.  The film does not instill any sense of urgency about the issue, which is a shame considering that there are approximately 2.8 billion people in the world who live at least as badly, and in many cases worse, than the film's main characters.

So, if you're looking for a great story, then you can do much worse than ""Slumdog Millionaire"".  If you're looking for a film that makes more of a statement on the issue of poverty, I suggest you look into the superb Brazilian film ""City of God"" and the American documentary ""Born into Brothels"".",1238803200,4,1525,4.949019607843137

What should you know if you haven't seen this film yet, and you are trying to decide whether you should see it?  Here are a few thoughts:

1) The film is set in Mombai, India
2) There are images of extreme poverty, including use and implied abuse of children, especially of orphans
3) There is portrayal of religious-based violence
4) There is street violence
5) The storyline is compelling, and you find it difficult to look away
6) The characters seem genuine, and the acting is good overall
7) You will find the cinematography and the casting to be outstanding

To be frank, I didn't know what to expect when we started watching this film.  Just a few minutes into the film we sent our 10-yr old to another room to do something else while we watched this DVD.  This is NOT a film for children.  The violence and apparent hopeless situation of the children living in Mombai's slums was simultaneously heart-wrenching and exciting.

contained within it, is a cinderella story that translates
across continents and socio-economic status!
In a world which is so cynical and jaded and has
seemingly lost it's capacity to be impressed by or moved
by anything that doesn't have a huge price tag or glamour
attached to it, here's a story that stimulates the human
spirit in a way that is very refreshing!
During the 2008/2009 awards season, I was like many people
who wondered just who and what in the hell was
a SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE!! As it systematically cleaned
house at all the major awards: The SAG, Golden Globes
and The Oscars against some very stiff competition,
this underdog of a film began to recieve much buzz and
a tidalwave of curiosity from people who wanted to see
what all the hoopla was about!
I can't really say much more than what has already been
said about this movie by a score of other reviewers.
The whole cast (Especially Dev Patel & Freida Pinto)
pulled it off with the stellar vision
and direction of Danny Boyle.
The young actors who played Jamal, Salim & Latika as
children deserve major kudos too!--Great Job!
As I said, with movies like Milk, Benjamin Button,
The Changeling, The Reader, The Wrestler, Doubt
and others, all of which were amazing projects themselves,
it was truly a long-shot for this foreign-based feel good
low budget but very well made film to even get a nod,
let alone win Best Picture Oscar and damn near
everything else but the kitchen sink!
Slumdog Millionaire is a great film and proof that in
this world that's much too concerned with being cool,
ultra sarcastic, and afraid of coming off as corny,
that a film about the underdogs and good guys
finishing on top has won out!---Check It Out!",1238716800,2,1758,4.692556634304207

Danny Boyle - niczym mloda gwiazda - rozblysnal we wszechswiecie znanych rezyserow swoim filmem 'Trainspotting' (1996). W kolejnych latach potwierdzil swoja pozycje calkiem - moim zdaniem - udana komedia 'The Life Less Ordinary' (E.McGregor, C.Diaz, H.Hunter) oraz 'Beach' (L.DiCaprio, T.Swinton). Niestety po latach bezowocnych poszukiwan w apokalitycznych krainach Zombi ('28 Days') oraz Si-Fi ('Sunshine'), jego blask zaczal slabnac.

3746190,4,B001P9KR94,"Premise
*A young man with a poverish background wins an Indian version of ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire."" Baffled by how a lower-class individual could answer such intelligent questions, the authorities interrogate the snot out of him.  He recounts how he knew each answer by delving into the experiences of his life.

The Good Things
*Video quality is excellent; it is very colorful, detailed, and clean.  There are only a couple of grainy scenes.  The sound quality is good, although some parts seem lower than others.
*Includes a commentary, 12 deleted scenes, a making-of featurette, a behind-the-scenes footage of the ""Toilet Scene,"" a short film (entitled ""Manjha""), a music video, and a digital copy.
*Photography is good.  There are a lot of good camera angles.  Most shots have a unique color/lighting scheme.  Subtitles have a colored box behind them.  It's a vivid visual style overall.
*Production design is great.  There are a lot of good (authentic) locations.  Costumes and props are great, and never out-of-place.
*Story is not bad; there are a number of parallel subplots where the character is struggling against other people who are supposedly better, smarter, stronger, or richer than he is, and ultimately has to fight for his life and well-being numerous times.  It is interesting, but may be seen as long or tedious.
*Acting/writing are not bad.  Characters are interesting enough.
*Music is cool.

The Bad Things
*Not for kids; contains violence, swearing, brutality, and a scene where the little boy is dumped in a pile of crud.

The Questionable Things
*The whole movie is edited in a way that flips back and forth between present-day and past events.  It can be interesting, but if you're not paying close enough attention, it can be confusing.

It is funny that this is a movie about a poor man who won it all, and this is a low-profile independent movie that won many awards.  But it is a good, respectable film in its own right.  It is a brutal drama with a lot of scenes that are heart-wrenching, and is captured on film nicely with a strong visual style.  It ultimately paints a strong autobiographical portrait.  For anybody who has the patience and tolerance, it is quite worthwhile, and the disc is excellent.",1238716800,2,2245,4.904509283819628

It follows the life of a boy, Jamal, who grows up on the streets in India along with his older brother and a young girl, Latika, whom they take under their care.  They face horrible treatment including barely escaping being maimed so that they could earn more as beggars for the men who are their ""keepers"".  They all become separated but Jamal never forgets Latika.  He finds her a couple of times only to lose her again.  Knowing that ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?""  is one of her favorite shows, Jamal earns a spot on the broadcast so that hopefully Latika will see him and he will be able to find her again.  As the questions are asked on the gameshow, Jamal remembers his life and how it is that he knows all the right answers.  He is suspected of cheating because no one believes a lower caste slumdog could be smart enough to answer all the questions correctly.  It's a beautiful movie in which right wins over might and good triumphs over evil.  It's a modern day Rocky.  The movie does contain some violence and profanity.

The only think that made me feel good was that the characters survived this movie, and it was finally over.  I would have felt good if the character won the money and then did something great with it to change the slums.  All the characters, save one, were black and white.  As opposed to say, Gran Torino, the movie I think should have won, which had characters that were black, white,grey, good, bad, and changeable.  Really depressing to me is that nothing has changed in the slums of Bombay(now Mumbai) since I was there 40 years ago, and nothing will until the culture changes.

3746197,3,B001P9KR94,"From what I have seen of most Oscar winning movies, this is a typical letdown;

I rented this a couple of days ago and watched the movie for the first time.  I gave the movie three stars because the cinematography (the visual) and the soundtrack are excellent.  As I said however in my review title this type of movie has such a predictable outcome that it lacks suspense.  Because of the flashbacks you know everything will turn out for Jamal and why would the game show set be used in the first place if he were not going to win everything?
I do think Jamal's adult character does a good job of acting as someone suffering post-traumatic stress as he is forced to relive his life while answering the questions but beyond that the acting is average.  Again, the acting is rescued by spectacular visuals of India, very good juxtaposition between the slums and modern technology and by those cute, adorable children used during the first part of Jamal's life.  Images of cute children will always rescue a mediocre plot.
The story also skips around a lot and has a bizarre speed of slow pace, fast pace- back to slow pace which I found very hard to keep track of.  There were times the movie seemed to be getting interesting, then it would switch back to dull.
Movies that are set in foreign countries tend to do well at the Academy and Slumdog was no exception.  An unfamiliar location and culture adds a certain amount of romanticism to a movie which often will override a mediocre plot as Slumdog Millionaire benefits from the location where it was filmed.  Had this movie been filmed and set in Los Angeles, or anywhere else in America this movie would not have been nominated for the Academy Awards.",1238630400,9,1703,4.5756578947368425

3746199,4,B001P9KR94,"When a release in Blu-ray  is done right it can literally take your breath away. When however a movie is hurried into release because it has won an Oscar for Best Picture the Blu-ray version is just a more expensive version of the regular DVD.

This should have been a movie as cinematically brilliant as it plot, acting and directing. The slums of Mumbai, the Taj Majal, high-rise cityscapes of a new Asian superpower, the Indian countryside should produce jaw-dropping awe when displayed in Blu-ray. It didn't happen. While good Blu-ray will often surpass the theatrical release and make you feel as if you are sitting beside the camera operator wearing great headphones, this movie felt like you were watching a decent movie on television.

Now the movie itself deserved an Oscar. In essence it is an Indian fairy tale of a young man's rise from the horrors of the slums to a menial but honest job supporting telemarketers in Indian call centers to 15 minutes of fame and millions of rupees on a game show.

3746201,4,B001P9KR94,"Movie goers love a film where the hero triumphs over the most adverse conditions to attain a goal. And this goes back further than the pinnacle of this genre, ROCKY. So what did the voters of the Academy do this year when it came to an Oscar winner for best film? They picked SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE.

This movie features the most improved character when it comes to tough times. The major plot of the film is actually quite simple. A young man goes on TV in India for a WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIR show. His goal is to make enough to find the girl of his dreams and settle down with her. That's it. And yet, that's not all there is to it.

The film uses a combination of present day situations combined with well executed flashbacks to show just how fortunate he is on the show. Each and every question asked of him is something he has learned through the rough and tumble times of his life. And troubled times they were.

As the film opens our hero, Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) is being interrogated by the police. His suspected crime is cheating on the game show he is winning. How could someone of his background, a dweller from the poorest community in Mumbai (thus the Slumdog portion of the title), possible know the answers to these questions? As he is questioned, he provides the police chief as well as the viewers of the story of his life and how he came to know them.

As a small child Jamal and his brother Salim play amid fields of garbage while living with their mother. A riot involving the Muslim and non-Muslim factions leads to their mother's murder and their quickly becoming orphans. Along with a young girl they meet named Latika, they live off the street until they are rescued by a missionary who collects young orphans.

But this is no real missionary as it turns out he uses the small children to scam people on the street into giving them money. He collects it all. He even goes so far as to blind those that can sing so they will make more money. With a little luck, Salim, Jamal and Latika escape, only to have Latika captured before they can get away.

Jamal is infatuated with Latika and his search for her spurs the romantic side of the story. He and his brother search for her until the day she is found. But this leads to more tragedy as Salim gets a gun and becomes a young gangster involved with crooks in town. A break between brothers results in Latika and Jamal parting ways once more.

More and more happens to Jamal and each experience shows his determination to find a better life as well as Latika. And while Jamal works hard, attempting to rise above his circumstances, Salim dives into the worst the world has to offer, making a living for himself but at what cost?

The end result is Jamal's appearance on the game show where he has the chance to make more than he could have ever dreamed of. And with the money he has the chance to rescue Latika from the fate that befell her not only at the hands of Salim but of the local gangster head who has chosen her for his own.

There are more scenes and difficulties than I've listed here, but better to see them for yourself. And the best part of this film was the slow unspooling of the tale, as Jamal recounts his life and how each part of it provided the answers he needed to win, The world through his eyes is one of hope, the eyes of Salim a despair. How two brothers can see the world differently makes up a major portion of the tale.

All of the acting in the film is impressive not only for the professionals but for the children who play them in their youth as well. Chosen to play these parts were actual children from the area, the real slumdog children. Dev Patel as the adult Jamal has a future ahead of him granted he gets parts as good as this one.

So was this the best film that came out last year? Good enough that it deserved the Oscar for best film? Yes, it is an exceptional film. But I can think of others I enjoyed more. Then again I've rarely agreed with what the Academy chooses over the past few years. But if you enjoy good storytelling, then you'll want to make a point of watching this film. You won't be disappointed.",1238544000,8,4131,4.310567010309279
3746202,5,B001P9KR94,"Slumdog millonaire really shines on blu ray.  It has 12 deleted scenes and several other bonus features that some dvd pressings did not have evidently.  You have 156 people mostly telling you that this is a great movie, and are they all correct? Absolutely , this is a great movie that has strong characters and is easy enough to follow even though the story jumps from the police station to the game show and back into the past of the main character. This seems confusing but it's not at all. The story is a solid story of the terrible conditions the poor are facing in the hugely overpopulated democratic country of India.  The picture deeerved it's best picture oscar because it tells it's story well , and it is as well acted as any A budget movie made anywhere else in the world.  This isn't bollywood though; a type of movie which had musical numbers thrown into the middle of it and which has it's place in world cinema; this is straight forward filmaking with solid direction and a more western style of storytelling.  Which is why it holds up well against the many other great movies made in the last 100 years and rightly joins them as a top effort in film.  The story of a slumdog orphan escaping poverty and by strange coincidences having his life mirror the questions on the Indian version of ""Who wants to be a millionaire!"".  The actor who plays the host of the show also creates a  very engaging and interesting character. He is all about himself yet not a villian and he certainly doesn't like to be reminded that he was once himself a slumdog.  The blu ray looks great and the sound is excellent. This is the reason to buy a blu ray player so that you can see movies they way they looked largely at the movie theater and this disc comes close to that.

From Shallow Grave, to Trainspotting, to 28 Days Later, to Millions, to Sunshine; he's always managed to deliver visually striking, hypnotic, and intelligent films.  Slumdog Millionaire has proved to be Boyle's most celebrated film yet, as the Oscar darling has captured the hearts and minds of viewers across the globe.  As a fan of Boyle's work, I can honestly say that I'm not in love with it as much as everyone else seems to be, but that aside, Slumdog Millionaire remains a powerful film that should be seen whether you be a Boyle fan or not.  With all the attention it has received, going into the film's storyline would only seem redundant at this point, but what I will say is that Slumdog Millionaire finds Boyle at his technical best.  The editing, sound design, and music are beautifully done, and the film manages to keep a kinetic pace throughout its two hour running time as well.

It's just not the great one I was expecting after all of the awards.  It makes me wonder about the people who are giving out these award nominations....this, the God-awful Doubt, and Milk are three movies I will probably never watch again in my entire life yet they were nominated for every award imaginable.  I don't know maybe I am wrong in the point that movies are supposed to be an exciting way to entertain you for 2 hours.  Maybe these movies have some hidden meaning or artistic cinematography or some other term I am too dumb to understand, but one thing they aren't are a fun time at the theaters.  I think I would rather watch an actual carton of Milk for 2 hours than watch the actual movie Milk again.  And I don't even want to get started on the movie Doubt.

3746217,3,B001P9KR94,"The Film:

""Slumdog Millionaire"" presents the Horatio Alger story of Jamal, a young, poor kid in the Bombay/Mumbai slums who endures various trials and tribulations to win a TV quiz show, get the girl, and escape his troubled life.

The movie is slick and entertaining in the best Hollywood tradition. It puts the protagonists in various dangers, and has them escape in the nick of time, usually with some comeuppance being delivered to the antagonists. ""Slumdog"" offers a gritty portrayal of slum life in Mumbai, to the point where I was left wondering how accurate it really was. The relationship between the two brothers (Jamal and Salim) is relatively interesting. The central love story, between Jamal and Latika, strains credulity just a bit.

The casting director did a very good job of matching child actors to their older counterparts, and it lends a nice continuity to the story.

Overall, the ending is a bit too pat, much like many Hollywood stories. I also found the central conceit, that Jamal succeeds because ""it is written"" to be troublesome. Isn't this sort of reliance on destiny, social status conferred by birth, and prophecy, the kind of stuff that has held large portions of Indian society back by making them second-class citizens? I am by no means scholar of India's history or society - but I found this notion to be troubling.

It's an entertaining movie, but in my opinion it never rises above its material. You can find the same type of story, conflict, and resolution in just about any Hollywood film. A young ""nice guy"" protagonist makes his way through a tough world, is rewarded by the universe for how swell he is, and gets a happy ending. This one just has ""foreign"" trappings. I found it to be a sort of poor man's ""City of God,"" a much better film by Fernando Meirelles.

The Blu-Ray:

The image in this transfer is relatively detailed, but it suffers from a wildly fluctuating black level throughout. Some scenes have good contrast, while others (usually in dark locales) exist in a grayed-out fog. I get the impression that this movie was filmed on digital, which doesn't handle low light scenes as well as celluloid. Whatever the reason, it just doesn't look very good during these scenes, which I would say comprise about 30% of the film. In its defense, the Blu-Ray offers a very vibrant and colorful image when it is not subject to the hazy mosquito noise of the darker scenes. At its best, this disc looks very good. It's just not always at its best.

The DTS audio mix is also seriously problematic. This film switches between very quiet dialogue scenes and EXTREMELY loud action so quickly, (such as trains, gunshots, car crashes, etc.) it threatens to blow out your speakers. Making things more irksome is the heavily accented English - you need to have the dialogue scenes cranked up to really make them out. Essentially, it is impossible to watch this film without subtitles at a lower volume, because of the drastic changes in volume. This plagues the movie throughout. The center channel dialogue never, ever, ever manages to win in any contest with the front and rear channels. I wish they would have just done the film in Hindi with English subtitles. Then I could turn it down and just read the dialogue. Instead, I am forced to fiddle with the volume control for 2 straight hours, trying to anticipate when the next sudden rushing train noise might occur.

Which is not to say that the loud stuff is bad. The sound, especially the music, is very rich and has a lot of surround effects. This is nice. But its dynamic range is just too much for the quiet and tender dialogue scenes. They should have leveled it out better.

Extras include some making-of material, two commentaries, a music video, and deleted scenes. It's all very nice, except for that fact that they are presented in 480p. Yawn.

If you've seen it already and you are a fan, the Blu-Ray is a worthy purchase. Its image certainly does things that DVD cannot do in terms of detail. If you have not yet seen it, I would recommend renting first. The image is not very impressive, the sound mix is annoying, and the film itself is pretty average.",1238544000,3,4176,4.721153846153846

So ,today March 31st it came out officially so I ran into my video store to rent it before all copies get rented out. Luckily ,there was one left.
I ran home turned on my TV started watching and then dissapointment...

Here is why;
Anybody remembers 1990 movie called Time of the Gypsies?
TOTG is a movie about gypsie boy from Eastern Europe,moving to Italy in order to earn enough money as a beggar, so he can return home and marry his sweetheart.
Well, Slumdog borrows heavily from TOTG which made it famous;
the fork,the hot peper scene,the evil brother scene,brother having relationship with his girl scene,the mother gets killed scene,under bridge scene,stealing babies scene,the blind beggar kid scene,the train scene,the richman in the car scene,...and list goes on.

In fact upon further inspection I can safely say that Slumdog is ""updated"" and ""softened"" version of TOTG with ""Who wants to be a millionaire"" plot.

Do yourself a favour and watch the real masterpiece about Slumdog lifestyle;Time of the Gypsies.",1238457600,41,1171,4.730392156862745

I'm really really mad I love the movie but I was really looking forward to the special features -- I think amazon should give us refunds or let us send back this dvd for the one with special features.

It was all a mistake and they sent me the special features version right away. Problem Solved.",1238457600,11,510,4.1

Are a lot of people having this problem? I pre-ordered through Amazon and received it a day early. I wonder if that has anything to do with it.",1238457600,12,426,4.405063291139241
3746223,4,B001P9KR94,"I did not see this Academy Award winning ""darling"" in the theatres last year so I can only review it based on the DVD version (not Blu-ray). From all the press and the awards it won, it became known as the Indian ""Rocky"". The ""little film that could"".

I watched the DVD on a moderately large TV screen and from the first few moments had a trouble with the subtitles. Unlike the usual ""bottom of the screen"" titles, Director Danny Boyle gets ""cutesy"" and has them appear at various places on the screen. Sometime upper right; sometimes left center. And they are not only in smaller print than most subtitles but they appear in colored boxes. Sort of reminds me of those ""trivia bits"" that some nostalgia films add. Now the film is MOSTLY in English but there are large portions in the first half that are in Hindi and need translation to know what is being said. This was enough to drop a full star off my rating. I'm not sure how this all came across in the theatres. Your eyes need to scan the screen, as you never know where the subtitle will appear. (Question: Is it still a ""subtitle"" when it appears in the upper right part of the screen?)

The other thing that got me about the film is the amazing amount of violence. There is a lot of graphic violence going on here and definitely not for kids. The major emotional moments at the end of the film - both the ""will he get the Ru 20,000,000 answer right?"" one and the ""will the lovers finally get together?"" one - are underscored by either the ""So You Want To be a Millionaire"" theme or the crescendo building love theme. Director Boyle has your emotions programmed.

The story did capture my interest- once I got past the subtitle issue - I did cheer Jamal on, just like I did Ken Jennings (on the U.S. Version). And, like nearly everyone who sees this film I wondered ""what happens next?"".

There is certainly plenty of bonus material for the commentary lovers. There are two - at 2 hours each - plus the ""making of"" documentary, deleted scenes and a 6-minute music video of the prime scenes.

I'm not sure it was great enough to win an Oscar, but it sure is worth seeing once, in my opinion.",1238371200,2,2149,4.37593984962406

The only ""features"" are trailers for other movies.  Did anyone else notice this problem?  Unless I missed a menu option, I'm thinking they're missing, and this is truly disappointing.

Another problem is the subtitles.  The DVD version retains the ""boxed"" English subtitles from the theatrical release, which are, of course, terribly small on a home TV.  If you select English subtitles from the menu, it only gives them to what isn't already translated, i.e. song lyrics.

I've noticed that 50% of this movie alternates between English and Hindi. Why this? From a scene to another, little boy Jamal is speaking his native language, and suddenly while showing the Taj Mahal to that old couple he is speaking a flawless English. It is not clear to the viewer, but I can bet that if this movie had had been entirely filmed in Hindi, probably it would NOT have taken the attention from the U.S. public audience and it would have finished ignored by the Academy. And as well, like a few other brilliant films it would be forgotten in time.

3746246,5,B001P9KR94,"I love this movie.  Chaotic, loud, colorful, frenzied and so many other adjectives, the Dickensian ""Slumdog Millionaire"" was one of my top choices of 2008.  I was so thrilled by the film after I first saw it that I brought a friend along with me the second time because I was afraid the movie would come and go too quickly for him to get another chance to see it.  The big surprise was when it started sweeping awards shows and emerged as the front runner for Best Picture at the Academy Awards.

But much like Jamal Malik, the hero of this film, ""Slumdog Millionaire"" came out of (almost) nowhere and rose to the top during the 2008 awards season.  I say ""almost"" because director Danny Boyle was already known for such films as ""Shallow Grave,"" ""Trainspotting"" and ""28 Days Later.""  But ""Slumdog Millionaire"" made him even better known.  Heck, nearly every single member of my family saw this movie, and that never happens.  One of the real treats of this film is the performance by the youngest children who are excellent as children put into a precarious position in their lives.

Some of the scenes of abuse and the rough life of the slums can be hard to watch for some, so let those be forewarned.  How accurately does this film depict reality for people in cities like Mumbai?  I can't really say.  There is criticism that this movie is unfair in its look at the brutal trials these children undergo, that it only shows the absolute worst but come on, how many films have ever been a perfect mirror?  ""Slumdog"" did not purport to be reality any more than ""Sex and the City"" tried to be a documentary of life in New York City.  (And thank God.)  I love this movie.  Ably assisted from the charismatic Dev Patel and Frieda Pinto as well as more established actors such as Anil Kapoor and Irfan Khan (who was wonderful in 2006's ""The Namesake""), this tale is one for the ages.  I'm glad to see that so many other people responded to it as well.",1237248000,,1948,4.473087818696884

3746248,5,B001P9KR94,"""Slumdog millionaire"" is a modern fable, an amazing fairy tale in the middle of the hopeless and the misery in one of the most overpopulated and unhealthy cities of the world.

The genial idea to blend the brutal conditions of living of a good part of childhood around our world, remits us forcefully to those times of the Italian Neo Realism (De Sica's The shoemaker , Rosellini's Germany year zero) and the two sublime French masterpieces (Rene Clement's  ""Forbidden games"" and Truffaut's ""Four hundred blows"") with the splendor of the fifteen minutes of bombastic glory when the right answers collide with transcendental and random events of his miserable existence.

Jamal is a motherless and homeless child whose hazardous existence walks at the razor's edge day after day. The countless obstacles he has to surmount will never make him to miss his romantic dream: Latika. So, he will keep an admirable personal ethic despite the abominable corruption and nasty social surroundings.

Danny Boyle (whose previous cinematography experienced a dramatic turn with this masterwork) captured faithfully, the misery and the glory through a perfect edition whose dynamic rhythm process engaged the viewer from start to finish.

With all fairness this film imposed itself above the rest of their competitors.",1237161600,,1304,5.280193236714976
3746249,3,B001P9KR94,"Slumdog Millionaire chronicles the odyssey of Jamal Malik from the slums of Bombay to now modern Mumbai. The film's framing device is Malik's attempt to win the Hindi version of ""Who wants to be a Millionaire"". He ends up answering each question correctly and a day before he attempts to answer the final question for the grand prize, he's whisked away by the police on suspicion of fraud. The police want to know how a kid from the slums could possibly answer all those questions correctly. As they question him (sometimes using torture at first), the viewer is treated to a series of flashbacks which explains how he's able to successfully answer each question.

The first half of the movie (the much better part) involves Malik first as a young child (of about five) and later at about the age of 10 (played by two different child actors). Malik's older brother, Salim, is the more aggressive of the two, in contrast to the sensitive younger brother. We see how they are orphaned at an early age when their mother is killed during a riot where Hindus attack Muslims. The children must fend for themselves in the slums of Bombay and there are many memorable and shocking scenes that chronicle their tactics of survival. One indelible scene involves Malik securing an autograph from a famous Indian singer who is on a publicity tour in the area. Malik extricates himself from inside a locked latrine and appears at the autograph signing covered head to toe in human excrement. Eventually Malik and Salim are lured by a gang of criminals who end up training them to become professional beggars. The gang goes so far as to increasing their profits by blinding certain children who have sweet singing voices. The blind children are used by the criminals to manipulate unsuspecting tourists who feel sorry for the now handicapped children. Salim alerts Malik to the gang's nefarious plan and they escape along with another child, Latika who Malik falls in love with.

At the midpoint of the film, with Salim now a young teenager, he takes revenge on head of the gang who almost blinded Malik by shooting him to death. But Salim incurs Malik's enmity by raping Latika. Flash forward to the present as we find Malik working at a menial job as a gopher at a large international customer service company. Malik eventually locates Salim who is now working for the boss of Mumbai's biggest crime syndicate. And he finds out that Latika is basically an indentured servant in the boss's mansion. In the film's climax, the police release Malik who goes on to answer the final question correctly and hooks back up with Latika who escapes the crime boss's lair (with the help of Salim, who, in a final act of contrition, sacrifices himself by murdering the crime boss and in turn is killed by the boss's bodyguards).

Slumdog Millionaire has a lot going for it. It's highly entertaining and features some great performances (especially by the child actors in the first half). Dev Patel as Malik is also excellent as the low-key hero who eventually gets the girl. The passionate conflict between the two brothers adds to the verisimilitude of the story.

Slumdog is really designed to be a gritty fairy tale. But even fairy tales must have some kind of internal logic. The weakest part of the story for me was the whole idea that the producer of the 'Millionaire' show was some kind of crook who wanted to fix things so Malik would lose. And was it at all believable, that Malik, who had become a national hero, would suddenly be brought in by the police and tortured merely because they could not believe a kid from the slums could answer such the tough questions on the show? In reality, the police would never have chanced abducting Malik while the show was going on and risk losing their jobs due to possible adverse press coverage. And why would the producer of the show want Malik to lose? If he wins, the producer's ratings go much higher and he makes more money.

Slumdog also stumbles by becoming a Bollywood production in the second half. The villain in the first half, the child exploiter is much more believable and menacing than the crime syndicate boss in the second half. And Latika is wholly an underdeveloped character--she has nothing much to do except being the love object of Malik.

I'm not sure if Slumdog Millionaire deserved to win the Academy Award for best picture. For all its shotcomings, it's still a solid piece of entertainment and will keep you riveted in your seat.",1236988800,3,4483,4.733674775928297
3746250,5,B001P9KR94,"In such a terrible year of movies, it's no wonder an independent film got all the rave. Why not, big business has caused films to lose all the elements that make the movie going public want to sit in a theater. No one knows how to tell a good story, put the right actors in the right role, and even know how to tug at the human emotions. Slumdog Millionaire on the other hand, did know what to do.

This film is the story of a boy named Jamal who came out of the slums of Mumbai India, to end up on the Indian version of the hit game show Who Wants To Be A Millionaire...and he wins! Because of that he is thrust into the worst few hours of his life because he was accused of cheating. You'd like to think his spirit is being crushed, then the story begins, the story of how he knew each and every answer. Then as the story unfolds you are brought into a grand story of family, survival, betrayal and true love. The real heavy hitter is when the police find out exactly why Jamal got on that show and it really makes you wonder about your own life and what truly are treasures in our lives.

I was blown away by this movie for many different reasons. The acting, the story, the music...you name it was a cut above everything I had seen all year. This movie could not have been released in a better time. A time when we in America think we have it bad during a time of misfortune. It teaches us to really look deep inside and find what matters to us and not take things for granted. This movie should also teach the big movie companies a thing or two. I think it is time to stop figuring out how much money a movie can make and just put a great story on the screen. A good story is what will bring the crowds. I mean no offense to Heath Ledger, but when a role in a summer blockbuster based on a comic book is given an Oscar. It just shows you how the so called Oscar worthy movies has gone downhill.

*To redeem myself I thought that Heath Ledger was great in The Dark Knight and truly deserved it! It just shows you that there was not a single better performance in 2008 for a supporting role.",1236988800,2,2094,4.077669902912621

He is treated with suspicion by authorities and even the game show host played brilliantly of Anil Kapoor, one of Bollywood's biggest stars. The young man played by three different actors at different stages seamingly blend into one character of Jamal Patel as his brother and another female orphan. With each question, Jamal remembers something to help him answer and that's the brilliance. When he explains his history, he comes across so natural rather than intensive. There is a lot of drama and flashbacks to his life in only 18 years. In only 2 hours, you are transformed into becoming one of his supporters and win or lose. You are rooting for him all the way to get the money and the girl. You laugh, you cry, and you will remember this film for a long time. I'm not much of a fan of Bollywood films but this film is a keeper. I keep telling people to see it at least once and stay to the end.",1236816000,3,1204,4.427927927927928

He knows the answers, not from having read about them, but from having learned in life about them (for example, he knows who invented the revolver from a shootout he was once involved). From the first scene, where the protagonist is tortured with electric wires to find out if he's a cheat, to the very end, when his lifelong female friend crosses a busy street to reach a cell phone in order to tell him in extremis the answer that will let him win the show, the whole film is ridiculous, sentimental, manipulative, condescending...and yet, this film is nowhere as bad as it sounds, and despite all its low punches, it is eminently watchable. Maybe this has to do with the actor's earnest performances, but this film ends up reaching a deeper emotional chord than it should have.

3746274,5,B001P9KR94,"Slumdog Millionaire is, in a sense, a modern day fairy tale of rags to riches.  The story takes place throughout the city of Mumbai, from the bustling metropolises to the lowly ghettos, the scenery is quite astounding.  In Dharavi, the hometown of the main character Jamal and his brother Salim, the brothers fight for survival amongst feral dogs and the rotting smell of trash.  The hometown of these boys, Dharavi, is so fetid you can almost smell the putridity.
 Jamal, who earns a living as a 'chai-wallah' serving tea to call-center workers and students in Mumbai, finds himself in the hot seat on the popular television show ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire."" Jamal, who is a lowly worker, is expected to have a brief stay on the show, as doctors and lawyers even cannot obtain much more than 60,000 rupees before being ousted.  Jamal has one unique advantage over former contestants however, Jamal has lived a very interesting life, one that has, in one way or another, presented him with the answer to all of the questions at different times throughout his life.
 The opening scene is an energetic one, as Jamal is on the verge of snatching the ultimate prize, but this is just a brief glimpse of the future, first, Jamal's story, how he arrived at this position, must be told.  Our first glimpse of Jamal as a young child is rather comical, but serves to demonstrate the putrid conditions of life in Dharavi.  Jamal and Salim are working a community toilet for money when a local celebrity appears in their neighborhood.  Salim locks Jamal into the toilet and Jamal, out of desperation, jumps into the filth below and swims out, lest he miss his opportunity to meet his childhood hero.  This scene shows us Jamal's determination to achieve his goals despite any obstacle, a reoccurring theme throughout the entire movie.
 Soon after this comical opening scene, the movie takes a rather dark turn.  A sanguinous assault upon Dharavi is launched by fanatical Hindu's armed with anti-Muslim banners and clubs.  It is in this scene that Jamal and Salim lose their mother, she is brutally executed before the boy's eyes by a fanatic with a cudgel.  With their mother dead and no mention of a father, the boys are cast into the larger, uncaring world with nowhere to go for shelter.  Along with the boys is a shy young girl named Latika, who is cursed by Salim and beloved of Jamal.  The three children are found one day in a trash heap by a representative from a local orphanage in the hills.  The boys and Latika at first praise this apparent saint, oblivious to his true intentions.  The exploits of this man push the story to the brinks of the execrable, and serve to add yet another element of hell to the young boy's lives.  The boy's eventually escape the orphanage, but are forced to leave Latika behind, as she is far from a world class sprinter.  Later it is learned that Latika is one of the preferati in a prostitution ring in the heart of Mumbai's downtown.  The boys exact their revenge upon the evil man later in the movie, when Salim shoots him in the face, giving him his first taste of killing, but certainly not his last.  The movie is full of stimulating eye-candy throughout, with brief interludes of the boys marauding around the Taj Mahal to the night scene of downtown Mumbai.  The movie appeals to the human heart, with casual scenes of life in the wealthier sections of Mumbai, to the caustic and fatal streets of Dharavi it shows many different levels of human suffering.  The less than likely hero of the film, Jamal, serves as an example of the indomitable will, the refusal to give up what one believes in regardless of the consequences.
  In the end, I found this bright, cheery film to be an honest representation of the human spirit. Jamal's indomitable will is inspirational, and the movie ends on a rather upbeat note, where lovers reunite, and Jamal becomes the slumdog millionaire.",1236124800,2,3919,4.692982456140351

I knew that this film won the Oscar and many other awards but didn't know much about the plot.  It essentially is the love story of two young people and how their lives separate them and bring them back together.

The way this film is shot is definately unique. The violence and brutality in the movie don't quite seem as realistic as a typical action/drama movie.  I believe this makes it slightly easier to watch for those that have trouble watching those types of films.  Overall this movie was solid.

As a result, there is a bit of a superficial sheen that gleams that merely fixes the film as a lighthearted and breezy, though occasionally exhilarating, great novelty. Indeed, it is a crowd-pleaser, but the tragedies, daunting they may be, seem underplayed, so our rooting for the underdog seems a bit manufactured, and thus, undeserved, and his happy ending seems contrived. On the other hand, Boyle's overall unshaken optimism and idealistic fairy tale sensibilities take control of how this film is perceived: a glass half full. It is through his unwavering positive philosophy which propagates that everything is going to work out in the end that anchors this work by unpretentiously using the old-fashioned way of telling a story: to simply tell a story, and indeed reading it as a fairy tale book. So by virtue of doing this, ""Slumdog Millionare"" succeeds as a fairy tale, and it is a grandly entertaining one at that, with a highly positive and singing ending to boot.

3746282,5,B001P9KR94,"By the end of two hours, Danny Boyle would have sent you through the slums of India witnessing the abject poverty, religious violence, inhumane acts of cruelty (against children) and the eventual modernization of  Mumbai where Jamal Malik sits in the hotseat about to win 20 million rupees in India's version of Who Wants to be a Millionaire. Through some strange twist of fate, he was arrested on suspicion of cheating and from there on, we see Jamal's life unravel in front of us as he recalls the answers to the questions.

Much credit must be given to the child star Ayush Mahesh Khedekarwho plays the child Jamal, for his excellent and endearing portrayal of a slum child who lost his mother to religious insurgents. Along with his brother, Salim, they navigate their way through the streets, making money through the most ingenious ways while never forgetting the young girl, Latika, whose hand let go of his during an escape. The main cast also works well but it's really also A.R. Rahman's excellent score and soundtrack with an eclectic mix of Indian, electronic and ethereal music that makes the film such a success.

At the end, Slumdog is a heart-wrenching and bittersweet tale of growing up and love. Still, it brings so much hope to the millions of children and people living in poverty-stricken areas of India.

As the credits roll, look out for the pulsating dance sequence that brings some cheer. Danny Boyle and AR Rahman deserve whatever accolades bestowed upon them thus far. (A+)",1235692800,2,1500,4.84765625

While I'm not actually reviewing the quality of the Blu-ray release (as that's still a month away as of my writing this), I am reviewing the film itself. Even if this ends up being a bare-bones release that doesn't include a single trailer as a special feature, I'd still give it 5 stars, assuming they treat the video and audio with the pristine respect they deserve. No tech specs or special features have been announced at this time, but I'm really hoping for at least one commentary track (preferably with Boyle and Dev Patel) and some behind-the-scenes making-ofs. Do I want to know everything there is that went into the film's conception, production and reception? Absolutely. But more than anything, I just want to own this masterpiece of filmmaking on the best possible format.

After seeing the trailer when it first came out, I saw Slumdog Millionaire before all the hype started spreading. In my town is a non-profit theater that shows independent and lesser-known films (in addition to the big award winners and cult classics). Anyway, it was there that I first saw this film. I was even more blown away than I expected to be. Not that I had any expectations. It's Danny Boyle. What can you expect?

Danny Boyle has taken us from post-punk to post-apocalyptic England (Trainspotting, 28 Days Later). He's taken us from tropical sands to the sun that heats them (The Beach, Sunshine). Now he's taken us to India. The film is shot as beautifully as you would expect. It will make for fine demo material on Blu-ray. Every scene in this film can be defined as 'eye candy.'

It starts out with a torture scene. Then it cuts to a game show. Then it cuts to a group of boys playing in the slums of Mumbai. This interweaving of flashbacks of flashbacks is really intricate but easy to follow. We are taken on an incredible journey of two slumdog brothers, Jamal and Salim, as they beat impossible odds of survival by being able to think quickly on their feet and looking out for each other (most of the way). How does Jamal end up on Who Wants to be a Millionaire? How does he know the answers to all the questions? Will he know the answer to the final 16 million rupee question? Will he find his one true love?

By the time you find out, you already can't wait to see it again. And so I did. But the second time, I brought about ten people with me, who I had convinced through sheer joy in raving about this film.

Also worth mentioning is the music. While watching Slumdog Millionaire the first time, I made the decision to go out and buy the soundtrack the very next day. It's all so catchy and just as eclectic as the visual aspect of the film. The music and editing are done so effectively that they become characters themselves. Composer A.R. Rahman is now very much on my radar. But I've dragged this review on long enough. I'll let the soundtrack's reviews and Oscars speak for themselves.

If there's anything you should take away from this review, it's this: Slumdog Millionaire is a joy to behold. It is a beautiful film unlike anything you've seen (though it combines many familiar elements): it is a unique, vivid, inspiring, disturbing, funny, depressing and uplifting roller coaster of a film -- all within two hours. You will be just as excited experiencing this film upon repeat viewings as you were the first time watching it. The climax will still get your heart beating as fast as it was, even though you know how it ends. (Because, let's face it, you knew how it ended the first time you saw it.) You will also find yourself going out of your way to share this film with others.

Hope this helps!",1235692800,,3852,4.540345821325649

Since that day I've seen the movie 3 times in theaters (sure it was on dates but still!) I can't wait to get my blue ray copy so I can experience the wonderful cinematography and music in high def. The movie deserves all the accolades it has received and it is a very fun and uplifting film which is rare for Best Picture winners at the Oscars.

Every stop I get to I'm clocking that game
Everyone's a winner, we're making our fame
Bonafide hustler making my name""
(M.I.A. ""Paper Planes"")

And so it goes - the backdrop of a Mumbai slum and a popular game show, mixed with a love story, a drama, the exotic melodies of A. R. Rahman and the unmistakable voice of M.I.A.

Short Attention Span Summary (SASS)

1. Boy from the slums grows up the hard way
2. He learns from his unforgettable experiences
3. Boy meets girl
4. Boy loses girl
5. Boy finds girl
6. Boy loses girl again
7. Boy finds girl
8. You guessed it!
9. Boy risks all to find girl again
10. He doesn't take ""no"" for a final answer

This storyline sounds simple, but it's told as a series of flashbacks that will touch your every emotion. When a former street hustler turned tea boy (Dev Patel) inexplicably makes it up the ladder of the Indian version of ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"" the suspicious host (Anil Kapoor) calls in the police, who proceed to extract the truth out of him in their own inimitable and sometimes shocking fashion.

His sad story is revealed piece by piece, with an explanation of how he knew the answers to all the questions leading up to the big one, and the 20 million rupees.
We learn however, that he's really after a much better prize.

Poverty, violence, religious intolerance, child abuse, betrayal and revenge are tempered somewhat by love, faith, hope, suspense, humor and music, and this exceedingly clever and well directed drama will have you laughing, crying, squirming and sometimes make you downright outraged.

This is one you MUST see, and then buy so you can see it again. Great movie, great casting, great music, great sets, great story - too many ""greats"" to state here.

This isn't one you should miss.

I feel that this is a worthwhile film that has some beautiful moments, especially in the first 45 minutes or so. That said, while it seemed at first that Slumdog might actually live up to the enormous hype, things started getting a bit silly when the boys reached Agra. Having spent several months in India over the course of two trips, the Taj scenes were unrealistic at best and I was never really hypnotized by the film again after that. Security is very tight at the Taj and street urchins operating a stolen shoe ring simply wouldn't happen as you don't take your shoes off until you're well past the military style checkpoint that ""slumdogs"" would never be able to pass. This in itself didn't ruin the film or anything, but starting with those scenes my suspension of disbelief generally faltered and the whole thing began to feel somewhat contrived. I suppose the writer's desire to plug in the trusty old ""rags to riches"" story was probably the main reason for this as VERY FEW Indian street kids ever climb the social ladder. I feel that Jamal losing out on the money but finally rescuing the girl would have made for a more realistic (and artistically apropos) ending. Concerning Jamal, I also failed to see any physical resemblance between the adult version and the two younger ones. Actually, Dev Patel has a significantly lighter complexion than any of the actors who played Salim, Latika, or the younger Jamal.

Ultimately, it seems to me that the gaggle of Oscars might actually damage Slumdog's reception somewhat as they inevitably lead one to believe that this is a once in a generation type of film. Simply put, it's not. For my money, City of God was a better executed film about street kids and Born into Brothels (while a documentary) was a superior chronicle of the Indian variety. Oh well. Slumdog is still worth seeing, it's just not quite worthy of the hype. 3.5 stars",1235520000,3,1926,4.712166172106825

3746302,5,B001P9KR94,"This is honestly one of the best movies I have seen. It is meant to entertain, and a lot of these negative reviewers are trying to break the movie down into something other than that.

Of course this movie has a fairy-tale feel, but when you get to know the main character (Jamal) through the movie, you will find yourself rooting for him towards the end.  There are very intense scenes in the movie, but I was very moved and thought it was a truly beautiful film.  This movie will turn out to be a classic.

P.S. If another movie like Benjamin Button was getting tons of accolades instead of this one, I am sure there would be backlash for it. It is a natural reaction for something so successful to get criticism.",1235433600,6,715,4.353383458646617
3746303,5,B001P9KR94,"I know it's been said a million times already and I hate to sound clich, but it's a statement that rings true every time you say it. Who would have thought Danny Boyle, a man from Manchester could have created such an award winning phenomenon. Slumdog Millionaire is a film I tried to keep away from as long as possible as I didn't want to seem like a person who jumps on the bandwagon. I guess it was inevitable that I was to see it eventually and tonight was the night. It has remained in my memory for a few hours so far and that lump in my throat has yet to subside. From start to finish I was completely engrossed and I have decided that those saying negative things about this picture are ones trying a bit too hard to steer clear of that dreaded wagon.

So the story itself is based around 3 main characters, 4 if you count the ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?"" host. Jamal the main character starts off in a police station as he is accused of cheating to win the ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?"" big 20 Rupees prize. Determined to prove his innocence to the Police, he starts telling them the stories of situations in his life which taught him the answers to the questions which he has inadvertently remembered for all that time. What we get to see as the game show progresses are a number of different defining events in Jamals childhood that are in one way heart breaking and in another heart warming.

He and his brother Salim remained very close to one another from birth and stuck together after their mother was killed. One night after the murder of their mother, they were sleeping in a container as protection from the rain and they met a girl named Latika. Jamal took this companionship from one of his favourite books and labelled them the Three Musketeers, although they could never remember the name of the third after Athos and Porthos. Salim's relationship is never too favourable towards Latika until they get older and after being split up at the still very early age, they meet up many years later and events get worse and worse with Salim raping Latika.

There are other events that take place which I will not spoil for the sake of your enjoyment, so I will now comment on the other amazing parts of the film. The acting was superb throughout and brought some genuinely surprising choices and showed us what they were capable of. Of course the young and teenage versions of Salim, Jamal and Latika were superb but unfortunately attracted accusations of these Indian child actors being taken advantage of. Whether they were or not doesn't take anything away from their fantastic performances. The adult versions of the three characters are played by the fantastically surprising Dev Patel (Jamal), Freida Pinto (Latika) and Madhur Mittal (Salim). Each delivered an astonishing performance, especially from the wonderful Dev Patel known originally to myself as Anwar from Skins in the UK.

The film was set mostly on location which allowed for the true tragedy of the Mumbai slums to be captured in all their glory. There have been things I've read that accuse Danny Boyle's picture of being demonising of the life in the slums. I don't know how you can demonise actual conditions being shown as they are, if anything I believe this is more complementary of the life in the slums. Although you could imagine it to be a very poor and dirty area, the slums are shot in a way that looks very artistic and in some senses quite beautiful. The soundtrack complements this immensely and I think without such spectacular music behind it, I think I would have had a whole different perspective on the film.

To those steering clear of the film because of its massive award success, I have only one thing to say. You're idiots, the lot of you. This is a beautifully artistic masterpiece that should be enjoyed by all film fans alike. I could talk for hours about the psychological implications of the life suffered by the children in this picture, but I have chosen not too. It's a brilliant film that I know as long as you give it a chance, you will love it.",1235433600,7,4073,4.566347469220246

In ""City of God"" the protagonist uses his wits and photography to escape the slums to a decent and realistic life. This film is a bit more over the top with it's vehicles for delivering Jamal out of the slums. This film also heavily pushes fate as the driving force of nature behind everything. ""City of God"" just shows good old fashioned good luck and someone relying on their wits. Money is not the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow in ""City of God"" either.

3746323,1,B001P9KR94,"I wanted to like this film. I like Danny Boyle. I am of Indian extraction. But Slumdog really isn't about Indian, the slums, or even human beings. It's about the transformative of power cinematic illusions. As such it succeeds on its own terms, but so what?

**spoiler alert**

To see how manipulative this film is consider the following question: how would the film have been different if Jamal's mother did not die? Answer: the only consequence is that he would not have known the answer to a game show question.

I'm not joking. That is the *only* discernable difference. Jamal's mother is beaten to death in a pogrom and this influences Jamal's psyche not at all. Later in the film, Jamal's girlfriend (Latika) is raped by Jamal's brother. Again, Latika seems to suffer no ill effects from this sexual assault.

How are the children of the slums able to overcome such trauma? What is their source of inner strength? We never find out because Slumdog makes it clear that the events it depicts are mere plot devices and do not represent real events. The mother really didn't die; the girl really wasn't raped. It's all fake. It's just a fantasy about a boy getting the girl of his dreams. There will be Bollywood ending (complete with a little dance) just in case you had any doubts about the complete unreality of what you just saw. Memories of children being orphaned, mutilated, sexually assaulted, and sold into slavery are all erased in the blinding light of Latika's model-perfect but entirely vacant smile. Hey, that's cool. After all, it's just a movie.

This sort of nonsense comes off rather badly when compared to the brilliant film Salaam Bombay! The street kids in Salaam Bombay! face the same tragedies the kids in Slumdog face. But Salaam Bombay! shows that these stark circumstances are bearable because the children of the slums have individual worth. The urchins have internal lives and real motivations (compare this to Latika or the one-eyed urchin who are just there to move the plot forward). The children of Salaam Bombay! survive their suffering because they create dignity within that suffering. At no time does Salaam Bombay suggest that the main character's suffering is illusory or that it can be forgotten if he just finds a suitably beautiful girlfriend.

I don't deny that Slumdog is reasonably well acted and entertaining. Yet that is part of the problem. In view of films like City of God and Salaam Bombay!, I think we can and should be demanding more than just entertainment.",1235260800,72,2512,4.843822843822844

True, they are completely different in their ""make up"", and grow into two very different young men, but the love is there...definitely.  Salim's choice, for example, is completely filled with love for his brother, as well as his deep love for Allah.  He knows what he needs to do, and does it.  And who can't be touched by Jamal's statement to Latika that ""Salim will help us""?  In his heart, he never gave up on his brother.

Yes, there's poverty and violence in this film, but I also think that one of the most beautiful statements this movie makes is about the bonds we form in childhood-- how they shape us as adults, and, ultimately, how we choose to treat each other as life kicks us around a bit.  It really doesn't matter if you grew up in the slums of Mumbai or Beverly Hills, we all carry life's ""events"" around with us, and what shows on the surface is how we've chosen to assimilate, conquer, or push them aside...if we can.

3746326,4,B001P9KR94,"""Slumdog Millionaire"" is a gripping film.  It has a great story, even though it is not plausible.  The camera work is so magnificent that even without the storytelling part, it would be a great documentary about India akin to ""Baraka"".  The acting is superb.  There have been many great reviews and enough said about its strengths.  The part I found puzzling that Jamal is arrested after the first day of the show and tortured all night.  Is there enough evidence to get him arrested?  The torture is even more severe than anything allowed at Guantanamo Bay - at least they do not use electric shocks there.  At one point, even the police officer in charge gets scared that Jamal is electrocuted.  I wonder if that is the standard practice in India and what Indian viewers would make of it.  Then, perhaps in only a few hours, Jamal seems to be in perfect form to continue the contest on television.  If I survived that kind if an ordeal, I would probably need at least a month to recover.  The mutilation of an orphan child scene is very disturbing.  Even during the darkest of times and among the most depraved of people, it is hard to even imagine a character as evil as the orphanage keeper who mutilates a child for monetary gain.  If that sort of thing really happened, I wonder how it would affect the keeper's karma.  Finally, the ending is lame.  Although completely fictional, the film's story is serious and the silly dance scene erodes it's emotional impact.  It was like telling viewers, ""You got into it, didn't you?

It was an ingenious and engaging idea for a story, and well done. I believed every single solitary second of this movie. But be forewarned, it is EXTREMELY upsetting.

False advertising: I'm flabberghasted at the commercials for first the movie, and later the DVD, that show darling kids atop the train (one of the very few light moments in the movie), the jaunty music and even a DANCE sequence??? that is not even in the movie itself, but over the credits. The commercials will mislead you into thinking this is ""a romantic adventure about a poor kid doing well on a game show."" Be forewarned, this is a GRAPHIC, profoundly upsetting movie about the desperate, dire living conditions in the Indian slums. Grim.

My rating: for adults with strong constitutions only, and older teens with a serious interest in world issues, poverty, etc.",1234915200,6,1878,4.783950617283951
3746328,5,B001P9KR94,"As an Englishman living in Germany, where Bollywood films are dubbed and therefore much eaier to understand than with subtitles, I now know a lot about Bollywood, from both the Masala and the Parallel sides.

""Slumdog Millionaire"" manages what very few films have done before it,(perhaps Ram Gopal Varma's ""Satya"" was the closest), in that it combines both the Indian genres. It is a ""parallel film"" (ie. an Indian Arthouse movie) in its construction, but it has a ""Masala Movie"" (ie. a Bollywood Blockbuster) feeling in its execution.

In other words, ""Slumdog Millionaire"" makes you think about the subject matter (which is arthouse), but it also makes you feel good at the same time (which is blockbuster). That is, it has a deep meaning (ie. that the slum people know things too, which could help the country to progress), but also a flashy cinemagraphic execution (for example, when one watches it, one has the feeling that something new in cinema has occurred, just like with Danny Boyle's earlier film, ""28 Days"").

As far as the Bollywood influences go, Danny has obviously taken time to study the art-form of Indian cinema closely, and any Indian who doesn't appreciate and respect that aspect of the film is banging his head against a wall for the sheer fun of it. Because at its core, the film IS Indian, full of the lifeforce and charisma of Mumbai. Though interestingly, apart from the Hindi speaking kids, who are FABULOUS, the NRI in the cast seems to understand the subtelty that Boyle is after much better than the Mumbai based actors. It's a shame, for instance, that for the film's balance, SRK did not accept to play the role of the quiz-master, as he would have given, as the character of Fate, a far more inspired and impressive counterweight to the background story than AK does. But nevertheless, AK brings everything he's got to the role, and obviously enjoyed it.

As for Mumbai, and the criticism in India of showing the slums too graphically... Well, I'm sorry, but I know Mumbai, and it looks EXACTLY like it's shown in the movie. Especially North Mumbai, near Juhu.

So, in short, Danny Boyle has done agreat job in capturing the lifeblood of the city, and I'm sure the film's sucess will open up a can of worms in the established Bollywood fraternity, where everything is still extremely caste-based, and where a lot of ingrained filmy-families have a lot to lose if ""non filmy people"" start having a success.

But the point is, as the film makes clear, that change has already started to happen with the inroduction of TV, so that already the old style Bollywood of the ""rich kids with their rich kid's problems"" is giving way to the specific concerns of the upper and lower middle classes.

Soon, I hope, the lower classes will have their own TV programs too,(which is not that far away, when one considers that a non-touchable recently won the Indian version of American Idol!). And so, when that happens, let the slumdogs cheer! Because then, just as Gandhi envisioned, India really will become a great democracy

Let us hope, therefore, in solidarity with all the slum dwellers, (who are, by the way, some of the kindest people in Mumbai), that the day of equality will arrive there as soon as possible, so that everyone, no matter what caste they're born into, can filfill their true potential ... as a human being.",1234828800,4,3352,4.767241379310345
3746329,5,B001P9KR94,"Danny Boyle has done it again. Another superbly directed movie. It goes to show that you don't need big name actors or Hollywood sfx to make a great film. In fact, great is an understatement. Its a brilliant film!  I won't be surprised if he goes on to win Best Director at this year's Oscars. I highly recommend Millions, also directed by Boyle, if you enjoyed this one.",1234742400,3,371,4.455882352941177
3746330,5,B001P9KR94,"This is a beautiful film. It uses the program 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire' as a metaphor to tell the life of an Indian boy born into the shantytowns of Mumbai.

The film does a good job in portraying the poverty of these places, although some who know of this poverty may say it does not go far enough. However, even in this poverty the film provides a moment of emotional power where you are horrified, shocked but also hilariously amused when the boy meets his Bollywood actor idol.

There are also disturbing scenes where the boy, his brother and their friend are duped by a 'professional begging outfit'. If you ever see street children/adults in the Indian subcontinent again, you will never look on them in the same light.

The film also provides a wider critique of how these people are looked upon by the richer/more powerful classes. It also provides a powerful critique of 'modern India' which the trio inevitably get swept up in. Modern India seems to be more about superficial appearances rather than true development.

The film looks at India's class prejudices, communal violence, poverty and alleged modernisation. Some Indians, who are very patriotic, despise this film because of it. This is a shame because the film could be used as a springboard for the discussion of these issues. The film is not patronising to India, nor does it preach and it certainly does not practise escapism.

For me, the childhood actors really were the stars of the film. They did a fantastic job of maintaining their childhood exuberance despite all that was going on around them.

Ultimately, the film has a happy ending, but you may feel this happiness is tainted by what has gone on prior to that point.

p.s. I hope the child actors in this film are given a real opportunity to escape the poverty that they have come from, or otherwise the film makers are just as bad as those they portray in the film. From what I have read, they have not really made an attempt to bring the children out of poverty. I encourage people to write to the makers to register their opinions on this.",1234742400,8,2082,4.641304347826087
3746331,4,B001P9KR94,"Slumdog Millionaire is a modern-ish rags-to-riches story. This epic is a combonation of action, romance, and suspense. Slumdog (I'm just going to refer to it as simply ""Slumdog"" is the story of Jamal, a teen from the slums of Mumbai and how he became a winning contestant of India's version of ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?"" . . . The movie consists of flashback after flashback that reveals Jamal's lifestory along with revealing how Jamal knew the answers to the questions asked.

The Movie was rated R and it was rated R for a reason . . Here's why:
1) Language . . .There's a considerable amount of cussing
2) Violence . . . While at times the violence was almost distasteful, it was vital to the plot . . Boyle (the Director) took a almost political stand point in showing the corruptness the roamed the streets of India (namely Mumbai [previously known as Bombay]) . . .There were gang affairs, murderous acts, disfiguration (of a child nonetheless!), a massacre, and sexual abuse [and abuse in general] (if any of those topics bother you intensely I wouldn't see this movie, but remember it's just a movie . . It's NOT real)
3) Prostitution is an issue that's also covered in Slumdog

H'okay I like Slumdog and rated it as 4 stars because:

1) The acting was excellent . . . I never heard of any of these actors before and I think that's what makes it all the more special . . . In my opinion it makes you less biased if you don't know who the actors/actresses are because you can't automatically like a movie because it has whatshisface in or or automatically dislike the movie because whathisface is in it . . . It's weird how some people get really emotionally involved with their most/least favorite actors/actresses . .

2)It has a message unlike all those stupid teen movies (which sometime can be entertaining but not in an artistic sense . . . I see Slumdog as a piece of art). Sure the main message is sort of corny: Love conquers all yada-yada . . .but be sure to note the other messages (some political) as well . . .

3) The Music - I'm such a sucker for M.I.A.'s ""Paper Planes"" and the more traditional Indian music was good too

Things that I didn't like Slumdog (aka why I took off a star):

1) It ruined my image of India . . sort of .  . I always knew there was a lot of poverty there, but I still wanted to go visit sometime . . . I'm not sure if I want to anymore . .

2) The movie made me very tense .  . . I was a bit uncomfortable throughout most of the movie . . But then again, it doesn't take a lot to make me tense . . . (heck, the wheel of fortune makes me tense!)",1234569600,2,2600,4.223790322580645
3746332,5,B001P9KR94,"While commenting upon social inequalities and religious tensions in India, the film careens along with the mad intensity of a Hollywood action feature.  Or should I say, Bollywood - for the plot takes its basic structure from countless Bollywood movies, with two brothers, one ""good"" and one ""bad"", a beautiful girl caught in the middle, and truly hideous villains - yet, reportedly, it has not been a hit in India itself, possibly through being implicitly critical of harsh realities.  The use of the game show to structure specific plot points is contrived, but works fantastically well.  The characters, again much like in an action film, are charismatic without suggesting too much inner complexity, and this suits the wild visual and auditory ride that constitutes the film's prime appeal.

For someone like me only distantly acquainted with Indian film and culture, this was a totally unexpected blast of melodrama and social commentary.  Definitely worth seeing.",1234396800,4,969,5.266233766233766
3746333,4,B001P9KR94,"The camera pans the white monoliths baking in the glaring Indian sun as Jamal's street smart brother Salim waves his hand towards the burgeoning panorama of construction concrete and dust and in a manner of introduction (he has not seen his sibling for years) explains that the site of this savvy new business park in Mumbai's boomtown of finance and commerce once contained the unbelievable (from a Western stance) dichotomy of vibrant patchwork color and dingy garbage-fill filth that like a Bizarro-World sunburnt vision of Legoland constructs the mire mosaic slum in which the Brothers Malik were born.

In director Danny Boyle's 2008 film ""Slumdog Millionaire"" one gets the impression that as the apprehensive Jamal, the child-to-teenage protagonist, struggles to emerge as a viable force with which to be reckoned in his own right--he consistently overcomes one trial of urban treachery after another as all the mythic heroes from Hercules, Jason and Krishna do, literally rising from a sludge of excrement in a moment of quasi-lightness as he imperturbably pursues a coveted autograph from a Bollywood actor helicoptered into the capital amidst a scattershot of plastic and cardboard garbage fluttering as innocuously as autumn leaves--so does modern day India strive to reinvent itself, wishing to shed its reputation of over population and poverty with the apparent ease of a bulldozer flattening acres of slum dwellings to reveal a real-time optical illusion of power and prosperity shimmering with the promise of world-class commercial status after the dust settles.

Whether or not Boyle had this analogy in mind, ""Slumdog Millionaire"" fascinates with its vivid depiction of a transitional India in a twist on the typical rag-to-riches storyline where grossly-over-populated-slum boy makes good and, of course, gets the girl of his dreams. Jamal, a chai-wallah (tea maestro) for a large telecommunications firm inadvertently finds himself on India's version of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"" complete with smarmy jokes and a slick Bollywood version of Regis Philbin. Unlucky Slumdog, with just one question to go to win 20 million rupees, is arrested for cheating and spends most of the film's running time in the police station explaining through life-lesson rather than lifeline vignettes just how he knows the answers to questions that have stumped far more educated contestants. Through the devise of flashback, the audience cringes as Jamal and his older brother Salim played initially by younger child actors, watch their mother murdered by a marauding group of Muslim-hating crazies and as orphans fend in a horrific stomach-churning world of harsh endurance that seems more hellish than anything Dante could imagine. Somehow they survive some downright disturbing almost vomit-inducing entrapments escaping from personifications of evil that Dickens would have loved to make you hate. On average Boyle dishes up an extra huge serving of fraternal devotion with zings as tangy as an expertly concocted chutney as the brothers and Jamal's love interest, Latika, barrel through the underbelly of their country undergoing two other actor reincarnations before the final denouement revolving around the television game show studio hot seat.

Bottom Line? ""Slumdog Millionaire"" gruesomely depicts an India that few would want to visit. Set in Mumbai's Dharavi slum, the otherwise could-be predictability of the boy-meets-girl, boy-conquers-adversity formula escapist fare takes on the additional nuance of the travelogue, introducing the viewer beyond the Pillars of Hercules to an unfamiliar world where dragons lie and commerce wants to reign. No one need `ask the audience' for the final answer on this flick--it surely entertains on a variety of levels despite its predictability and almost ruthless exploitation of the viewer's emotions. Recommended especially for young adults.

This is a finely crafted film, thanks to the always wonderful Danny Boyle; a whole bunch of wonderful kid-actors make the flash-back moments so hopefully  heartfelt. A wonderful cast. The amazing editing and brilliant photography add to the progression of the plot at large, showing past & present. I was impressed that this simple story, that almost didn't find a distributor, appeared to the public.  This is a feel-good film, but subtitles may keep some Oscar voters away. The Oscars have made lots of mistakes; the absence of Dev Patel as a nominee is just another Oscar travesty.  It's as earnest a performance as I've seen. ""Crouching Tiger"", Life is Beautiful"", ""Z"", ""The Emigrants"", and other foreign language films have been darlings at the Oscars, all sub-titled. ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is a worthy film. Kids should see it to know the importance of ""learned knowledge"", though the subtitles may not make it as accessible to the general public (and kids). I was moved by this film, and the impeccable artistry for a ""small"" film. Bravo, Danny Boyle! UPDATE: Benjamin Button was a much better cinematic achievement. It should've won.",1234224000,4,1269,4.976415094339623
3746336,5,B001P9KR94,"in the 20th and 21st centuries, he might well have written this story.  It's that kind of tale:  Unlikely underdog rises from despair due to pluck, perseverance and highly improbable coincidence.  And yet it works.

Make no bones; it's a dark-toned film in the early going, especially the first half hour or so.  You will see the kind of gut-wrenching, cruel beyond belief poverty and exploitation that will make you want to turn away.  I won't lie, 15 minutes into the movie if my friend had said, I'd like to go, I would have.  (But what a mistake that would have been!)  As usual, the ads may be misleading so if your tastes run to typical bollywood (or even hollywood) light-hearted & all feel-good, move along cause this ain't it.  I can understand how some viewers don't want to see the ugly reality of this young man's world, but I would also counter that we can't pretend it's not the way life is for some.

But that being said, if you will give the film the time it needs to tell this story, I think you might be sucked into Jamal's narrative, just as I was.  You might come to admire his resolve; his single-mindedness and the idea that he believes in the future -- not that he will be rich, mind you -- but that he will find the girl who is his destiny despite all of the things that keep pulling them apart.  Ultimately, his motivation is not the money, but doing right by the girl who was left behind.  As the layers unfold of how Jamal came to knows what he knows, I became as intrigued as the police captain who is interrogating him.

But beyond the love story, there's the equally compelling relationship of the two brothers.  Jamal's brother Salim alternately exploits, protects, and betrays him throughout the film as the story spans through their childhood, teenage, and young adult years.  They survive together and end up taking very different paths as young men.  But in the end, blood proves out.",1234051200,3,1919,4.515942028985507
3746337,5,B001P9KR94,"""Slumdog Millionaire"" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: The story of Jamal Malik, an 18 year-old orphan from the slums of Mumbai, who is about to experience the biggest day of his life. With the whole nation watching, he is just one question away from winning a staggering 20 million rupees on India's ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?"" But when the show breaks for the night, police arrest him on suspicion of cheating; how could a street kid know so much? Desperate to prove his innocence, Jamal tells the story of his life in the slum where he and his brother grew up, of their adventures together on the road, of vicious encounters with local gangs, and of Latika, the girl he loved and lost. Each chapter of his story reveals the key to the answer to one of the game show's questions. Intrigued by Jamal's story, the jaded Police Inspector begins to wonder what a young man with no apparent desire for riches is really doing on this game show? When the new day dawns and Jamal returns to answer the final question, the Inspector and sixty million viewers are about to find out...

The cast led by Dev Patel (as Jamal) & Freida Pinto (as Latika) is excellent! The directing by Danny Boyle (Oscar-nominated) (who also directed ""Sunshine"" (2007), ""Millions"" (2004), ""28 Days Later..."" (2002), ""The Beach"" (2000), ""A Life Less Ordinary"" (1997), ""Trainspotting"" (1996), & ""Shallow Grave"" (1995) & Loveleen Tandan (co-director: India, also did the casting) is brilliant! The screenplay (Oscar-nominated) (based on Vikas Swarup's novel ""Q & A"") by Simon Beaufoy (who also wrote the Oscar-nominated screenplay to ""The Full Monty"" (1997) is brilliant!

The (Oscar-nominated) music by A.R. Rahman is brilliant! The (Oscar-nominated) cinematography by Anthony Dod Mantle (who also did the cinematography to Boyle's ""28 Days Later..."" & ""Millions"") is excellent! The (Oscar-nominated) film editing by Chris Dickens (who also did the film editing to ""Shaun Of The Dead"" (2004) & ""Hot Fuzz"" (2007) is brilliant! The casting by Gail Stevens (who also been doing the casting to Boyle's films since ""Trainspotting"", except ""A Life Less Ordinary"") & Loveleen Tandan is excellent! The production design by Mark Digby (who was an supervising art director on ""28 Days Later..."" & ""Millions"" is excellent! The set decoration by Michelle Day (who was an art department assistant on ""28 Days Later..."" & did the set decoration to ""Millions"", ""Sunshine"" & ""28 Weeks Later"" (2007, which Boyle executive produced) is excellent! The costume design by Suttirat Anne Larlarb (who also did the costume design to ""Sunshine"") is excellent!

This is an brilliant drama that is unlike anything you have seen this year or last year, actually. This is Danny Boyle's best film of his career, thus far. This is one of the best films of last year.",1234051200,2,2818,4.953488372093023
3746338,4,B001P9KR94,"Danny Boyle certainly knows how to tell a good story as he weaves together an entertaining yarn of growing up hard in Mumbai.  He builds the plot around ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"" using the questions to reveal Jamal's hard life, as the chaiwalla seems to know all the right answers much to the chagrin of the host, Prem Kumar.

It takes a little while to get on track but Boyle and Loveleen Tandan never lose sight of their characters, charting a course that has a number of amazing twists and turns.  While Jamal never gives up his pursuit for the lovely Latika, his older brother Salim is the one who figures out how to get them out of one jam after another, but not always to Jamal's liking.  Some of the scenes are pretty harrowing, as one would expect from being forced to live on the street after Jamal's and Salim's mother is beaten to death in a race riot, but ultimately Boyle keeps to the spirit of Bollywood moreso than Dickens.

The cast is an intriguing mix of first-time actors and Bollywood stars, as fantasy meets reality.  I can see why the movie is such a favorite among audiences. One would have to be pretty callous not to give into the kinetic energy of the movie, and let yourself be taken along on this wild ride.  The movie is loosely based on the bestselling book Q & A by Vikas Swarup.",1233964800,2,1317,4.372950819672131
3746339,5,B001P9KR94,"Slumdog Millionaire is a rags to riches saga, and it's also the oldest story in the world: Boy meets girl. Boy gets girl. Boy loses girl. Boy tries to get girl back...  But yet, in so many ways, it takes what could be such a dusty old story and makes it new again. Even the premise of a game show on first blush seems like it will yield little if anything of interest, but even though I am not a fan of these silly game shows (except of course Jeopardy, which challenges the mind) I was enthralled by this movie.

And on top of the compelling story, you also get a most fascinating backdrop: India, and the City of Mumbai, formerly known as Bombay. You get teeming slums filled with poor but resourceful people juxtaposed with the splendor of the Taj Mahal; you get an ancient culture making rapid fire changes to a modern one, transforming before your eyes. Slumdog Millionaire is quite an achievement, and one that seems to have come along at precisely the best time: Like the game show, it offers an escape in times of economic strife.

The device of the game show is brilliant, as it allows the questions, and the subsequent interrogations, to each trigger a flashback, an episode in the past that will illuminate how Jamal Malik, the nominative Slumdog Millionaire, came to know the answer. Sure, there is some luck involved, but oftentimes a memorable event in Jamal's past will make the answers stick in his mind. As we discover how he knew the answers we also learn about how much he loves Latika, and how his brother Salim became a gangster. The performances of the three characters in that ""bazaar"" love triangle, as children, and then young adults, were brilliant. Kudos to Dev Patel, Madhur Mittal, and the lovely Freida Pinto. Anil Kapoor was brilliant as the show host, Prem Kumar--a younger, Indian version of Regis, but with an edge.

3746340,2,B001P9KR94,"The film starts off well enough, when they were kids in the slums.  In particular were some scenes on an Indian train that reminded me of some scenes in Gandhi.  Seeing the evil people using kids to beg on the street really hit home with me, it's everywhere in China.  And it's sick.  There were also some good, funny moments during the interrogation scenes when Jamal stood up to his tormenters.

But I don't think the romance worked at all.  The relationship with his brother didn't feel real at all either, it felt very tacked on.  And I found it hard to care about the main character, especially because he spends half his screen time mute, staring into space.

Will he win the money and the girl or lose both.  I didn't care at all one way or the other.  I didn't find much fun in the film, and there's absolutely nothing there to think about.

3746341,5,B001P9KR94,"A mix of kinetic energy, an undertow of suspense, and a dash of Dicken's, Slumdog Millionare has become the breakout indie hit of the year. I was drawn to the film after its win at the Golden Globes and after viewing it, I can see why there is so much fuss over it.

The story is a familiar one, abliet with a refreshed, updated feel. Young Jamal has become an overnight sensation after his amazing streak on India's ""Who Want To Be a Millionare?"". With just one more question left to win big, the question on everyones mind is, how on earth did this kid from the slums, with no formal education, stable living conditions, and answering questions that have stumped dozens of contestents before. Slowly, we are taken back in time and shown Jamal's life, as each question he is asked pretains to a certain event in his life. All the while, he hopes to find the love he lost long ago, and maybe even come on top.

The film literally crackles with intensity. The locations are awashed in a bright gold color, the camera is fast and moving (though no so much to make you dizzy), and the music is so lively and kinetic that it's almost like your actually in the movie with these characters, with Danny Boyle being the main person involved in this, injecting so much life and vibrancy that the film just pops off the screen. He also manages to equally balance the drama, humor, and tenderness of the screenplay without it coming off as to heavy handed.

All the cast members do great, and while there is no particular standout, they all equally play of each other and hold their own scenes, with no one being overshadowed or underplayed.

But what I really liked about the film was that (minor spoiler) unlike most other drama films, by the end of the film, you feel so happy and lifted that you just want to jump up and down as Jamal goes for the million dollars. I can't remember the last time a movie has actually made me grab my seat in suspense, baiting my breath, hoping and praying that Jamal actually wins it all and gets the girl.

3746342,5,B001P9KR94,"'Slumdog Millionaire' is an improbable 'boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy goes on game show to get girl back' story, and yet at the same time a cinematic treat and finally such good fun that any glitches in the narrative are easily overlooked.  Director Danny Boyle (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Trainspotting-Director-s-Cut-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B0001XALTG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Trainspotting - Director's Cut (Collector's Edition)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/28-Days-Later-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00005JMA8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">28 Days Later (Widescreen Edition)</a>) has once again successfully eluded being pigeonholed as a genre director or as someone who revisits the same ground over and over with 'Slumdog', and even if the entire effort is not the most original, it's told with such energy and passion that it feels like a new experience.

The young actors in 'Slumdog' are what elevates this film, in addition to the disturbing yet fascinating scenery of their journeys through Mumbai.  When it comes to the scenes in the slums, I'm sure there will be as many different opinions as there are reviewers, but personally, I thought the director gave an honest glimpse of a world that I know very little about.  What I especially appreciated was how he did not try to play on the viewers sympathy by taking time to over-emphasize the horrid conditions.  He simply filmed - and viewers may draw their own conclusions.

And it is horrid, but that reinforces the vitality of these characters - that they are survivors.  What is even more endearing are the child actors who portray the main characters in the flashback sections.  According to an interview I caught the end of, they were plucked from the very slums the movie is set in.  All of the main characters (at whatever age) are played by young actors that without fail carry their roles with confidence and skill, until I couldn't hardly help but root for them as they tried to overcome all the obstacles between them.

It is possible that the depiction of the slums in this movie, and Indian society as a whole, may overshadow the movie.  I think that would be a shame, though many of the images certainly have the ability to engender strong feelings.  I would encourage viewers sensitive to small children in extreme poverty think twice about watching, but I have to remember that, even though it doesn't conform to my views, this society has been successful for centuries.

I did have a few minor problems with the film, though not really enough to drop the rating.  The biggest one was a scene that I felt was a swipe at Americans, who are shown as seeing a problem and only know how to throw money at it.  Stereotyping good hearted people who honestly try to do something doesn't help accomplish anything.

This is almost a faultless date movie, and even though the characters are just teenagers, there was a mature feel to the whole film.  On the night we went, it was also senior night at the theater, and we were surrounded by the over 60 crowd.  But I was very impressed at how well they all behaved, and afterwards overheard them talking amongst themselves about how well they enjoyed it.  I do think that this movie deserved it's R rating though.  There are some early scenes of torture, plus some gun violence, and the life portrayed in the slums itself can be disconcerting.  Otherwise, call it a positive and affirming movie with a only a few drops of saccharine for flavor.",1233792000,6,3548,5.189473684210526
3746343,5,B001P9KR94,"Believe the hype. Slumdog Millionaire, the latest film from Trainspotting director Danny Boyle, is every bit as amazing as you've heard. It's sweet, it's funny, it's tense, it's uplifting, it's spectacular!

The movie tells the story of Jamal, a young Muslim boy (played at various stages by three different actors, but most notably by Dev Patel of Skins fame), who grows up in the slums of Bombay/Mumbai. These slums are the sort of places governments ignore until either a: they catch on fire, b: there's some major world event, like the Commonwealth Games, on the way and they want to clean up the place, or c: the people who live there make them pay attention.

Through a series of unlikely events, ends up on India's version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, where he's about to win the highest jackpot ever. This, of course, leads to questions: is he cheating? How can he be doing this? He's just a boy from the slums, what does he know?

As the movie unfolds, we see exactly how he answers the questions: he relates them to moments in his life. His knowledge of American currency, for example, comes up from a blind beggar boy who told him the name of the man whose face is on the $100 bill. There's another moment where he reads a person in a ""The Lady or the Tiger"" kind of way, trying to figure out if the answer the man fed him is real, or a bluff (for the record, I got the answer right before anything was fed. I have no idea why. It's not like I follow cricket, but at some point I must've picked up that bit of trivia and it stuck in my head, rather like with Jamal).

The movie is as flawless as anything I've ever seen. Sure, it's unrealistic; a fairy-tale, basically, but who cares? It's beautifully told with some incredibly good acting and writing. The fact that Dev Patel is not up for an Oscar goes to prove that the Academy is pretty out-of-touch with the world. Well, that plus the fact that they give thirteen nominations to The Curious Case of Benjamin Boring. Even the music is noteworthy. I may well pick up the soundtrack.

I cannot possibly praise this film high enough. It is a wonderful, delightful, uplifting movie. If you have a choice this weekend between seeing this and, say, My Bloody Valentine, see this. You can thank me later.

One last side note: for reasons unclear to me the MPAA, that bastion of conservative nonsense, has rated this movie R. I have no idea why. Sure, there's a bit of language and you see some mild nudity, but so what? I'd feel quite comfortable taking children as young as eight or nine to this movie, provided they can read well enough to keep up with the occasional subtitles. The MPAA really just needs to be reformed or go away. We deserve better.",1233705600,3,2717,4.456740442655936
3746344,4,B001P9KR94,"Superficially, this might have been a feelgood movie about a diligent boy rising from the ghetto, getting fabulously rich, and never forgetting the girl he left behind. That's not this movie.

This takes any Dickensian poverty you might have imagined and brings it completely up to date. It starts with Jamal orphaned by lethal sectarian violence, his childhood friend turning to guns and violence, his cute little female friend turned into - well, you get the picture. Every event leaves its mark on him, and he learns from it. The odd smattering of stray facts earns him a place on a game show with multi-million rupee payoff. And, in a coincidence that stretches imagination, every one of the game's questions has answers in his haunted past. Almost every one ...

I liked this one a lot more than I thought I would, largely because of the child actors. The several girls playing Latika at different ages, especially, are heart-breakingly cute - and especially heart-breaking when seen in that cesspool of poverty. The way it documents the poverty of that underclass, the ""slumdogs,"" will outrage any thinking, feeling viewer. In an ending that's really a beginning, Jamal rises above that poverty, and above the corrupt and vicious society at the top, too.

3746345,3,B001P9KR94,"If most Americans are like me, they will associate the term ""slumdog"" with the term ""slumlord,"" as in a  ""dog of a slumlord. I initially thought the word referred to a ""slumlord dog"" -- that is a slumlord that had a doggish reputation for failing to keep up run-down properties rented to the poor at unseemly profits. However, ""slumdog,"" in the context of Indian society, is a derogatory label given to the lowest of the ""untouchable caste:"" the mostly street orphans and wretched waifs and urban denizens that rule the streets by day and night and live on (and off of) the dumps of trash of most Indian cities.

The plot, upon which the movie hangs, is the story of an endearing ""slumdog"" named Jamal who upon reaching adulthood, accidently manages to get on the Indian version of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. "" And as he progresses up the ladder towards the magic jackpot, the host becomes suspicious and reports him to the local authorities on suspicions of cheating. As a result, the game show contestant is called into the nearest police station for interrogation. And the rest of the movie consists of flashbacks of the interrogation, which soon reveals that, associated with each of his answers, is a corresponding incident in Jamal's earlier life as a street urchin, that predicts with a certainty to each of his correct answers. The cleverness of the movie is that the game show motif becomes just a pretext for exposing the many horrors of the violence of poverty of Jamal's childhood as a ""slumdog"" on the streets of Mumbai, and by extension it is a broader expose of the poverty of the underclass of Indian society, more generally.

Despite my initial apprehensions about the movie after misunderstanding the true meaning of the term ""slumdog,"" I wanted to be seduced by this movie. But this was not to be. For the movie shocked me into a corrected understanding of the term ""slumdog"" with a negative act of symbolic vulgarness that could be interpreted in only one way: as the dark mean-spirited political undertones of a ""caste-conscious"" culture.

The incident in question involves a prank by his friends, in which the eight year-old, Jamal gets locked in an outhouse and he has no exit except to take the dive and come up through the toilet hole dripping with fecal slime from head to toe. He then proceeds to run smiling through a crowded street with hundreds of other kids, and somehow manages to get the signature of his movie hero, still draped unnoticed by the crowd in this dripping, stinking, unhealthy fecal robe.

What a metaphor for an uncaring society!

This scene is the most powerful, if not the pivotal scene of the movie, because symbolically it sets the context, the subtext and the pretext of the rather thin and syrupy melodrama that follows. Next to this opening image, the quiz show motif is little more than a handy vehicle for ""allowing"" the wretched ""to be seen"" achieving a modicum of success in a society where it is fully recognized that it is next to impossible to do so.  A society where the only normal routes to ""upward mobility"" for these ""outcasts"" is crime and scheming. The callousness of Indian society is normalized through the shock treatment of the ""outhouse scene"" and then thereafter relegated to the background. After the fecal robe parade, nothing about Indian society can be more shocking or vulgar. This one scene inoculates Indian society from any responsibility for what happens to its poor.

With this shock treatment, it is difficult not to be disturbed throughout the movie by this image of an eight year old walking in public dripping in a fecal robe. For in my mind, that robe points to the deeper and darker political motives of the moviemakers: After that scene, it is no longer an uplifting comedy, but a mean-spirited behind the scene ""caste conscious"" political movie manipulated by the upper classes to maintain the rules of the status quo intact, even as it weaves an unreal story of improbable success for a slumdog. And although it's deeper and darker political messages are cleverly tucked behind the syrupy facile melodramatic Bollywood quiz show motif, one that ends happily with the street urchin getting the girl and living happily ever after, the movie is fun, only if you turn your blinders off to the savagery of the poverty and violence of everyday life of the Indian underclass. I could not.

The unmistakable message embedded in the context is that no one cares that millions of orphaned kids run around each day in wretched, violent poverty, having their limbs severed and their eyes gouged out, their organs sold, all for profits for those on the next level up the class ladder. No one cares if they run the streets with no clothes, no where to live, even in fecal robes. The point of the movie is to desensitize the moviegoer to the fact that in India, poverty is like the grass, a part of the national landscape, most Indians are over it: so the movie's appeal is for the moviegoer to also to just get over it too. Some of us could not.

The subtext is equally clear, the movie attempts to expose, even as it ""tiptoes around"" the edges of the ""uber sensitivities"" of the caste warfare going on today, the utter hopelessness of trying to rise above ones own station in Indian society. Although the motif of ""fictionally allowing"" the wretched to rise up for a fleeting moment of ""upward mobility"" via a TV game show is clever, it belies the truth of Indian society. Plus, that triumph is accidental and occurs by societal and artistic fiat, and even under these odd circumstances, still the success immediately comes under suspicion as involving some kind of ""slumdog"" trickery.

If this shallow, slick, movie wins an Oscar I will be very disappointed.

Crossing genres, this film is a romance, mystery, and thriller all at once.  The framing of the story around the questions of the game show adds to its uniqueness.

3746347,5,B001P9KR94,"Director Danny Boyle's 'Slumdog Millionaire' is a touching, moving and completely riveting cinematic experience. I was blown away not just by its poignant story, but also by its striking contrast in cultural and societal differences from our own here in the Western Hemisphere. In addition to its compelling screenplay, it's also beautifully photographed and captures the backdrop of the dauntingly wretched conditions in the slums of modern-day India as meticulously and realistically as any movie can and probably ever will. The musical score is quite amazing and unlike any other I've ever heard, which hilights several intense dramatic sequences of chasing and running.

The story opens up with Jamal Malik (Dev Patel), a seemingly uneducated teenager from the slums of Mumbai who gets a much coveted, one-in-a-million chance to escape from his hopelessly indigent existence by appearing on India's 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?' gameshow where contestants have a chance to win monetary prizes by answering a variety of trivia questions. He's had an unprecedented hot-streak on the show thus far by answering a rather difficult and seemingly esoteric series of questions and in the movie's opening moments, Jamal is just one question shy of winning the grand prize of 20,000,000 rupees. But the show is out of time before he has the opportunity and must reconvene the following night. Following the episode's airing, Jamal is arrested and detained after the police and the show's host (Anil Kapoor) suspect him of cheating. While in poilce custody, Jamal recounts through a series of vivid flashbacks to his childhood that brilliantly reveal how he knows the answers to all of the questions he has answered correctly.

We learn that as children growing up in the squalid, nightmarish poverty of Mumbai's slums, Jamal and his older brother, Salim, were orphaned at a young age when their mother was killed in an attack from an angry Hindu mob on their shantytown. Together with their female companion, Latika (whom Jamal loves even as a child), the three band together as a scrappy, self-styled version of 'The Three Musketeers', their favorite literary work from school. They stick together and endure a wretched existence on the muddy streets that is at times despondent and depressing. But this is where the movie's message of hopefulness comes in as the three are a plucky group who display courageous fortitude and spirited resourcefulness despite their trying circumstances. Jamal and Salim become separated from Latika after escaping from a nefarious child exploiter where the two subsequently take to riding the many railroad trains crisscrossing India. The trains become a source of livelihood for the two brothers as they manage to eek out a scant subsistence on the trains by peddling to, hustling and in some cases outright stealing from the trains' passengers. There's even a rather funny passage in this part of the movie where Jamal and Salim end up at the Taj Mahal where they hustle tourists as faux tour guides and even steal their shoes to sell on the streets! The two brothers continue this for several years until they eventually end up in the booming metroplois of Bombay. Here, after becoming employed as a tea server at a mega communications call center, Jamal then gets the opportunity at appearing on the gameshow, something every teenager and young adult in his society longs for. It's at this moment the story segues back into the point we originally see in the movie's beginning. After being grilled and harshly interrogated by the police, Jamal is set free and allowed to continue on his final night of the gameshow after he becomes a national celebrity and hero to the public who demand to see him get his chance to win the grand prize. But having not seen his long-lost love Latika (Freida Pinto) in years, his shot at winning the jackpot is more about reuniting with her than it is about wealth.

Slumdog Millionaire is a love story at its core, but there are no sweeping romantic locations and visuals. Jamal, Salim and Latika grow up in a level of squalid, forlorn poverty that makes even the most impoverished American ghettos look like a vision of paradise by comparison. Still, it's surprising how much their culture has been influenced (or polluted) by the West. Interestingly enough, the poor of India are seeming to be as obsessed with gameshows and tv as we are, possibly because it's their sole lifeline to a better existence so few in their society get to experience. A wonderful movie that inspires and teaches us that true knowledge and wisdom comes not from age or education, but from the sum total of our life experiences. A beautifully irreverent and moving cinematic experience with one of the most amazingly original endings and credit sequences I've ever seen in a movie. Always interesting and at times fascinating.

When he's taken in for questioning (and torture), we learn that he answered the ""Millionaire"" questions correctly because of incidents in his childhood, when he was an orphan fending for himself in the teeming slums of Mumbai.

This is an exceptional movie with a riveting script, outstanding acting, and cinematography that makes you feel like you're right there with Jamal.  The movie owes much of its success to the small children who play Jamal and his brother in flashbacks; they're wonderfully talented and believable in quite challenging roles.  However, I would recommend it only to those who know what to expect, because it was way too intense for me.  The scenes of the boys growing up in hopeless misery and squalor are so shocking I often had to look away.  Inhuman cruelty directed at young children drew audible gasps and groans from the theatre audience.

Danny Boyle shows modern India as a constantly moving and evolving place, and that is reflected in the changing destiny of its main character who will do anything to reach his goal. There's a scene involving a toilet that basically sums up the character of Jamal, that he will literally go through crap to get what his heart desires.

The performances by the actors are amazing, especially from the child actors, the cinematography is eye-popping, zooming you right into the experience of Mumbai, and the pure strength of the story of a persistent underdog, makes this film without a question the best of the year.

The Taj Mahal hotel and Victoria Station are featured as are many other aspects of this vibrant city. I visited Mumbai(formerly Bombay)and can attest to the frantic, frenetic rhythm and energy of the city you see in the movie.
 Three or four levels of suspense are going on simultaneously in this story which will mesmerize you. The life of the poverty-stricken boy-protagonist who is a contestant on a millionaire game show with its huge stakes, the police interrogation, the missing girl, the hardships and manipulation of slum life--all cry out for your attention. It's a multi-layered, very intense movie. The acting is topnotch. Everything about the movie is done with meticulous care. I think it'd destined to be a classic.
 It's fascinating to realize how the moviemakers get you drawn into the movie. But stay for the credits because they are in the old Bollywood musical extravaganza tradition. They put you into another world and are sensational.
 There are excruciatingly exciting chases, gangsters, extreme poverty, humor, and always the slums and the slum mentality. The survival wiliness of the two brothers as they grow up is fascinating to watch. The three musketeers is a theme that gallops through the movie. It's triumph and tragedy. The protagonist becomes a chai wallah, a delivery boy of chai, spice milk tea.

It's a portrait of a city and a boy on their headlong dash toward destiny with ferocity and velocity. India is a place where one in a million can hit it big, but for most people can barely survive in one of the world's countries with the highest rate of poverty and intractable slums.

3746352,1,B001P9KR94,"I just read at least half a dozen news articles from India to England, about how much, or little, the child actors in this movie were paid.

My being able to watch and enjoy this movie as an entertainment (they didn't claim this was a documentary) was based on the assumption that this was a fiction. I was going to go watch it again a couple more times and was going to urge all my friends, colleagues, and family to go watch it. But now that I have found out that the movie was never a fiction for these children, I cannot.

Note to Mr. Danny Boyle: You are a pretty good director, but it wasn't merely your talent that made this movie great, and the teenage and adult actors were not that impressive. You would not have gotten this kind of outcome without this particular group of children. I guess that is precisely why you chose them in the first place.

Let's say somebody made a wonderful horror movie where several people meet horrible endings, and it is really a good movie. How many people do you think can sit through the movie, knowing what they are seeing is those unfortunate people dying in reality? I feel kind of the same way about this movie.

The movie is really good, but for it to be entertainment, the people who control the money from this movie should seriously give more consideration to how to better take care of these wonderful children, who were the best part of the movie.

As it is right now, the makers and distributors of this movie are peddling these children's real-life misery for their own fame and fortune, and that is pretty low. I read one of these people saying the children were paid three times what other people in their neighborhood make or something like that, as if that is something to brag about. Folks, three times nothing is still NOTHING!!!

I sure hope the bean counters have a change of heart and fix this situation quickly. Otherwise, I am going to do my best to inform AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE of these children's exploitation by the makers of this movie.",1233014400,14,2013,4.456521739130435
3746363,1,B001P9KR94,"I wanted to like this film. I like Danny Boyle. I'm of Indian extraction. But wow. It's just a bad film. I agree with D. Bhansali's 2-star review in large part. Slumdog really isn't about India or even poor people. It's about the transformative of power cinematic illusions. But so what?

**spoiler alert**

To see how manipulative this film is consider the following question: how would the film have been different if Jamal's mother did not die? Answer: the only consequence is that he would not have known the answer to a game show question.

I'm not joking. That is the only discernable difference. Jamal's mother is beaten to death in a pogrom and this influences Jamal's psyche in no apparent way. Later in the film, Jamal's girlfriend (Latika) is raped by Jamal's brother. Again, Latika seems to suffer no ill effects from this sexual assault.

How are the children of the slums able to overcome such trauma? What is their source of inner strength? We never find out because Slumdog makes it very clear that the events it depicts are mere plot devices. They don't represent real events. The mother really didn't die; the girl really wasn't raped. It's all fake. It's just a movi about a game show. There will be Bollywood ending--complete with a little Bollywood dance--just in case you had any doubts about the complete unreality of what you just saw. Memories of children being orphaned, mutilated, sexually assaulted and sold into slavery are all erased in the blinding light of Latika's model-perfect (but entirely vacant) smile. Hey, that's cool. Why not? After all, it's just a movie.

This sort of nonsense comes off rather badly when compared to the brilliant film Salaam Bombay! The street kids in Salaam Bombay! face the same tragidies the kids in Slumdog face. But Salaam Bombay! demonstrates that these stark circumstances are bearable because the children of the slums have individual worth. The urchins speak and have real motivations (compare this to Latika or the one-eyed urchin). The children of Salaam Bombay! survive their suffering because they create dignity within that suffering. At no time does Salaam Bombay suggest that the main character's suffering is illusory or can be easily forgotten if he can just find a beautiful Bollywood girlfriend.

I don't deny that Slumdog is at times enjoyable. It's reasonably well acted and entertaining. But that is part of the problem. In view of films like City of God and Salaam Bombay!, I think we can and aim a bit higher and demand more than just entertainment.",1233014400,18,2536,4.913551401869159
3746364,3,B001P9KR94,"I went to see ""Slumdog Millionaire"" a couple weeks ago because of the huge Oscar buzz.  And while I enjoyed this movie, I wouldn't recommend seeing it more than once to anyone.  So I find the hyperbole surrounding ""Slumdog"" a little alarming.

I am in total agreement with Salman Rushdie, who has called this movie ""visually brilliant.""  The cinematography is outstanding, kinetic, and the use of perspective and color to establish a scene is superb (in this regard, ""Slumdog"" reminds me of ""City of God,"" a better movie by far).  The soundtrack too is mesmerizing, loaded with pitch-perfect fusions of eastern and western music.  ""Slumdog"" is in this way every bit as good as ""Trainspotting,"" one of director Danny Boyle's best movies.

Yet I also agree with Rushdie that ""Slumdog""'s biggest flaw is its storyline.  Perhaps in the context of Bollywood, a game show which asks questions drawing entirely from the contestant's experience is fine.  But when a western director makes a movie in which this happens, I have a sneaking suspicion that ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is the result of lazy storytelling.  One coincidence in a movie is almost necessary; two is starting to strain plausibility; the dozen or so in this movie alternately provoke indifference and cynicism.  While watching ""Slumdog,"" I realized that this was precisely my reaction to ""Forrest Gump,"" another movie which leans heavily on a succession of improbabilities.  The flashbacks, which in many movies can heighten tension, are sometimes ineffective because we know Jamal (the protagonist) survives these tense moments.

The characterizations in this movie don't always help either.  Jamal's love interest, Latika, never seems to suffer anything worse than living with a rich guy.  And she only seems to care about Jamal when he has won ten million rupees, despite abundant evidence of his virtues beforehand.  Yet I am supposed to identify with her?

""Slumdog Millionaire"" is probably worth seeing once, but its best attributes are also found in other movies.  It's better than ""The Kite Runner"" by a bit, but far worse than ""City of God.""  The Academy has botched its nominations once again, as this is not really one of the five ""Best Pictures"" of 2008.",1233014400,5,2224,5.093922651933702

The music, the pace, the editing is beyond amazing, and should garner an Oscar, needless to say the storyline is brilliant, the actors, even the kids through the years, are just so well done, and the transition from stage to stage is not clumsy, it flows very, very well.

In a year full of odd releases, and surprises, I am so glad a movie like this can come along, in the dead of winter, and remind us that filmmaking is indeed that lavish creativity that a rare few still know how to accomplish with percision and make us enjoy shelling ten dollars to go back to the theatre.

3746367,5,B001P9KR94,"America, I mean the United States of America are changing sides, from Hollywood to Bollywood. They have to answer that unfair competition from the deprived Indians and go directly on their turf, since we can't really speak of a lawn, and bring the biblical truth to those pagans. That's what I found most fascinating at first: the image of the USA seen through the filter of Mumbai. First, make some simple questions fuzzy and difficult to capture. Moslems and Hindus are sure there but we don't know who is who. They speak the same language. No more difference really between Urdu and Hindi. Only the names of the main characters sound Moslem, that's all and the anti-Moslem pogrom or riot is just an unclear detail, especially since the dregs of this society are them, the Moslems. First serious blurred issue. The second is of course the problem of the Untouchables, the Dalits. They cannot be Moslems since they are a Hindu caste. And sure enough our characters who are living in the ""slums"" or shantytown, on the pile of garbage, are not Hindus, hence are not Untouchables. Then we are surprised because taking care of toilets is one of the tasks of these untouchables, or doing the washing for the fortunate who can afford that kind of service. So where are they? Invisible of course, but not in a city like Mumbai where there must be several millions of them. The episode of the little kid jumping into the toilet hole is just unthinkable for a Moslem child. If we go on with that fuzziness, we find out that the orphanage must be on the side of evil, since exploiting the Moslem orphans, hence Hindu. And the gangster who recuperates one of the boys when they are running away from the orphanage people after saving the girl and killing the main organizer of that begging and whoring ring, since he defines himself as the friend of the enemy of his enemies, must be Moslem. All that is unclear and that is done on purpose and it keeps some ambiguity about the Moslems in India without giving the slightest real knowledge about the real situation in India. But then of course we can speak of India itself and of its emergence from the mud-pit of the world. The picture that is given there is this time a reflection of and on what the West was fifty years ago, and some will say still are. Anything is good for these super poor people to do something to improve their lot, essentially by using any kind of opportunity that comes along that is half honest and half dishonest, like borrowing something that has been left somewhere like shoes at the entrance of a temple, but with the firm intention of not bringing them back and of making them circulate further for a little profit. This great poverty is not at all nurturing resignation but all the opposite, determination and the will to gamble everything to get up at least one step if not two. The film is entirely centered on a TV game, Questions and Answers that can lead the winner to 20 million Rupees. A game of punctual knowledge for a lot of money and nothing else. And yet out of that game popular fame is produced, the conviction that you can never keep people down longer than they will decide, that the survival instinct is nothing because it leads to killing, but the instinct to improve one's lot is a lot more stronger because it is supposed to lead to improving your lot in society itself. Then the story is of course a comedy because of the love affair that is intertwined and entangled in that story and the rewriting of Stephen King's ""Running Man"" (with Schwarzenegger) has become pleasant and even funny and not the gruesome drama of the model. The final scene is a typical Bollywood scene with hundreds of actors and actresses dancing in Mumbai's Victoria Station and it is some kind of cherry to top off the ice cream. This film will entertain you deeply if you try to use your brain to see the social discourse that is hiding behind the flashy and colorful surface.

3746368,5,B001P9KR94,"Frantic and pitiless, profane yet eloquent, flush with the ability to create laughter out of unspeakable situations, Slumdog Millionaire takes its simple message--what doesn't kill you yields the most lasting education--and weaves a riveting masterpiece about the life of a boy who makes it in a world of delicious contradictions.

This is trademark Danny Boyle stuff (of ""Trainspotting"" and ""The Beach"" fame). His stunners have left no doubt that he can poke into a subculture and emerge with a fresh new look at it. But Slumdog goes one better. It is pitch-perfect in its take, but also perhaps his most accessible endeavor thus far.

The narrative couches a crisp homage to Bollywood. Funky A.R.Rehman music. A largely Indian crew. Crisp acting, even from kids, in fact especially from kids. And then the gloriously larger-than-life thematic flourishes: poor folks at the behest of a cruel world, friend pitted against friend, brother against brother--and the most tried and tested one of all-- a rags to riches cavalcade of an underprivileged hero who makes it amid impossible odds. It's hero-giri alright.

But where it departs from Bollywood is Simon Beaufoy's screenplay. It's dazzling. Professional Indian reviewers have been overly delicate in their reference to Vikas Swarup's novel that inspired the film, ""Q & A"". The book was an enjoyable read, but the film merely borrows the central premise and that's basically it. There is a scene towards the end with our two protagonists at a train station where a trick of reverse cutting will tell a discerning viewer just how innovative the thinking behind the screenplay truly is--that is such a sweet, affectionate shot that it moistened my eyes.

It's a bummer that such fuss and to-do has been made about how this film projects an unfair image of the country. Guess the confusion arises when established reviewers such as Roger Ebert decide to call it a testament to ""the real India"". I wouldn't be so pedantic. To me, the film carries no such delusions of grand purpose. It's a gleeful entertainer. A breakneck story of one individual from *one* aspect of an astonishingly multifaceted country. To that extent, it covers its subject with addicting vigor and focus. It's witty, gritty, and--for suitable values thereof--sh*tty.

To address some petty cavils:

(1) The use of English by the characters. It's a British production, what did you expect. There's a world outside a specific country. We call it ""International Cinema"". Bet there will be local dubbed versions for those who truly desire it that way (now that the film's multitude of nominations have drawn it far away from a SlumUnderdog status).

(2) The disrespectful use of the word ""dog"" in the title. This smacks of nothing but ignorance of colloquialisms. ""Word up, dawg"", for instance? People forget that an insult becomes an insult only when we choose to let it become one.

(3) Finally, the unfairness of how it depicts India in a manner that might give people the WrongIdea. To these Einsteins may I point out that the baffling kaleidoscope we call India makes it pretty hard to ever get the RightIdea to begin with?

What level of dimness would make a viewer go seeking a wholesome view of a country in *one* film? Just because ""The Godfather"" showed with such pizzazz one specific aspect of the American underworld, should we infer that every American is a gun-slinging gangster? ""Crouching Tiger.."" may have sketched a mellifluous perspective of China, but I don't recall anyone thinking that our Chinese colleagues fly from tree to tree on their way to work. And so on.

It's a movie, not a national treatise. Sure, it depicts poverty. So? Those who have expanded their horizons beyond Spiderman Part 38 will know that countless movies have been made in the last decade alone that depict hard times in *every* country. At any rate, reality is nothing but a collectively accepted notion. I'd say Slumdog is as equidistant from reality as, say, Bollywood's gigantic palaces (yeah, we live that way) or the scantily-clad ""item girls"" gyrating on snow-capped mountains.

To people who have yet to see this upbeat thriller: ignore all the Pavlovian drivel. It's a delectable film, brimming with fun and suspense, and it has its moral spine exactly where it belongs. With one sweeping flourish it will break your heart, then heal it, then send you packing with music. Literally.

3746369,5,B001P9KR94,"""Slumdog Millionaire"" has become a sleeper hit. Made on a relatively modest budget, it has captured the hearts and minds of moviegoers and garnered a fistful of Academy Award nominations. Jamal Malik, played with soulful sweetness by Dev Patel, grows up in Mumbai under wretched conditions. When their mother is killed, he and his older brother, Salim, scramble to stay alive by sleeping wherever they can, stealing food, and even allowing themselves to be duped by a Fagin-like con man. Latika is a homeless girl who teams up with Jamal and Salim, and the trio struggle mightily to get through each day. After enduring unspeakable hardships, Jamal grows up and takes a job in a call center. In an unlikely turn of events, the eighteen-year-old somehow becomes a contestant on ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"" To everyone's shock, this barely educated former street urchin comes up with some very unlikely answers and is on the verge of winning a fortune. Surely he must have cheated, but how?

Directors Danny Boyle and Loveleen Tandan elicit touching performances from a fine cast. The lovely Freida Pinto plays Latika as a young woman who is badly treated by a thuggish gangster.  Jamal grows to worship her, but formidable obstacles stand in his way. The brothers soon veer off in different directions. Salim, played with menace and barely controlled rage by Madhur Mittal, turns on Jamal and the two become bitter enemies. Also worth mentioning is the wonderful Anil Kapoor, who brilliantly depicts the unctuous and phony host of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"" With a frozen smile, he pretends to be supportive of the calm and collected Jamal, while inside, he is seething with resentment and incredulity that this nobody is succeeding beyond all reason.

The intriguing script by Simon Beaufoy is a fairy tale with a twist. ""Slumdog"" combines comedy, tragedy, music, and romance with such energy and excitement that we are willing to accept the surreal plot on its own terms. Somehow, this film would have us believe that in a chaotic world torn apart by violent religious fanatics, sadistic mobsters, brutal policemen, and exploiters of women and children, love and redemption are still possible.

""Slumdog"" is helped immeasurably by its biting sardonic humor and pulsing and electrifying musical score. Boyle, along with his editor and cinematographer, deserve kudos for creating a world that is both repellent and seductive. Mumbai is a teeming city with many faces.  There are fetid slums filled with pitiful beggars, and brothels where young women are used and abused. On the other hand, businessmen in modern skyscrapers are attempting to transform India into a competitive global economic power. Although several appalling scenes make us want to avert our eyes, we cannot help but root for Jamal and Latika, two resilient and courageous youngsters who deserve the happiness and peace of mind that has been denied them by fate.",1232582400,2,2941,5.068181818181818

But Slumdog is not about how he could answer the game show questions but why he became a contestant in the first place. He's clearly not interested in the money itself. This remarkable film is many things -- action thriller, human drama, social commentary on contemporary India, a story of human destiny, and, most of all, a tender romance.

3746372,2,B001P9KR94,"I agree with the consensus that Slumdog is a beautifully filmed and well-acted movie. My problem with it is that it's being perceived by American audiences as an Indian movie, and it's not. It's a Western fairy tale that happens to be set in India. Think Charles Dickens with flashier costumes. And it's precisely the fact that so many viewers will be duped into thinking they're watching a movie about India that I find so troubling.

As an Indian-American, I was hoping that the movie would be both entertaining and insightful about India and Indian people. But unlike Monsoon Wedding, or even the London-based Bend It Like Beckham, Slumdog seems content to rehash tired stereotypes about ""poor, poor India"" without digging into people's motivations or cultural beliefs. Of course there are an enormous number of extremely poor people in India. But what makes India so unique - and therefore so compelling for filmmakers with an astute eye - is its complexity. It's confusing and overwhelming and dirty and chaotic, but it's also richly textured and warm-hearted and astoundingly beautiful. Slumdog touches on almost none of these themes. As mentioned above, it's well-acted across the board, but the heavy-handed direction gives the actors no room to ""be Indian"" in any authentic way. Think of the most overused cliches about modern India - from Bollywood stars to call centers - and they've all been stuffed into Slumdog in one shape or another. It's Paint-By-Numbers pretending to be serious art.

If you're simply looking for a good-versus-evil fairy tale, Slumdog really will be the feel-good story of the year for you. But please, don't come out of the theater thinking you've learned a great deal about India.",1232323200,8,1718,5.045774647887324

3746376,5,B001P9KR94,"You know you've seen a good movie when a packed theater audience simultaneously rises to their feet and applauds for several minutes at the end. This is exactly what happened when I saw this film near Christmas. Some of us had tears in our eyes. I've never seen a response like that for any film, much less a mid-budget production with no A-list talent. SLUMDDOG MILLIONAIRE is that good. It deserves the 4 golden globes it has already won, and should be a strong contender for Best Picture in February.

A straightforward premise guides this film: Jamal, a contestant on the Indian version of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire, has successfully answered all but the final question facing him. One more correct answer and he will win the prize of 20 million Rupes. Before he can answer the show ends for the night and he is arrested under suspicion that he is cheating to win. It turns out that Jamal is a 'Slumdog,' a former resident of the largest and nastiest slums in Mumbai. Because of lack formal education the police are convinced he must be cheating to have had so much success on the game show.

He is taken in for interrogation, complete with torture, to force him to admit he is cheating. The rest of the movie consists of Jamal explaining how he knew each answer, which are shown in flash-backs of the events in his life which taught him the answers. The scenes with the police are very well done and are reminiscent of THE USUAL SUSPECTS. Jamal, sullen, tired, and unusually honest, explains his life and current circumstances with a gripping urgency that correlates well with the vignettes from his past. We learn of his escape from the slums, his survival buy whatever means necessary, and of his great love, Latika.

The film starts with a wild chase through the slums, Jamal and his older brother Salim running from the police, afraid and yet taunting the them at the same time. This intro is sheer genius, painting the boy's environs as well as their personalities with deft strokes. We learn that Salim is a risk taker, that Jamal follows his older brother's lead, that the slum is a horrific place to grow up, and that despite that, it is filled with the vibrancy and hope of human endeavor. Danny Boyle, in an interview on the NPR program FRESH AIR, said that originally they shot the opener in English, but that it just didn't feel right. Only after switching to Hindi did the scene successfully convey the slum and its inhabitants.

There are several remarkable things about this film. First is that because it is comprised of many flashbacks, there are three actors each for Jamal, Salim, and Latika that portray them at different ages. All of them nail their roles. There is no let down at any point. The viewer never doubts the continuity of the characters. Each actor delivers a powerful, believable performance that resonates with the viewer.

Another high quality element is the carefully assembled plot that never becomes predictable, despite the ending being fairly obvious from the beginning of the film. SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE is shockingly original, and sometimes just shocking. The film is gritty and frightening, and doesn't shy away from the harsher realities of growing up in a slum or the consequences of bad choices. The characters are believable, the sets are perfect, and the dramatic moments as intense as the well done action sequences.

Finally, near the end of the film when the various themes of the movie are being woven together, the viewer is allowed to see the full impact of Jamal on the world around him. As 60 million viewers tune in to see if he will be allowed to answer the final question, we see Jamal as much more than a Slumdog with a chance to become vastly wealthy. He is the embodiment of hope. Hope that we can escape the grimness of our circumstances, hope that love can overcome desperation, and hope that even people that seem lost can find redemption.

It is equal parts force of nature and destiny, and something worth contending for. It is also similar to RUN LOLA RUN by featuring a soundtrack heavy with electronic dance music that somehow fits the film perfectly.

The closing scene is very well done. Without ruining it, the director shows a restraint that makes it poignant. As it unfolds, I was thinking ""if only Boyle is smart enough to end it here, the film will be perfect,"" and then he does. CASABLANCA like in impact, there were few in the the showing I attended who were not moved.

There are gansters and call centers and Muslim-Hindu violence and young blue child-gods -- a fantastic blend of Indian of the past and present spiced with danger and love. Also phenomenal music -- one of the few movie soundtracks I wouldn't mind picking up. It's blend of atmospheric tunes and pulsing beats anchors the movie's intense action. The acting by the entire ensemble is first rate. The three leads are played at different ages by three actors, some of the best child actors I have ever seen on screen.

3746378,5,B001P9KR94,"""Slumdog Millionaire"" is a terrific film.  It is a film of great drama set against the backdrop of modern India where an uneducated boy from the slums rises to challenge for stardom on ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire"".  Yet it is more than just this.  It is also a film of escape from horror and poverty.  In many ways, it touches the core of the human spirit.

Do not for one minute think that this film is typical Bollywood.  It is gripping drama with not a song in reach.  We see the lives of three slum children: Jamal, Salim and Latika.  They are forced to struggle as orphans when their parents are killed in religious unrest.  They are sold into beggary and prostitution but manage to escape to greater or lesser degrees.  They drift apart until a final reckoning when Jamal receives national fame for challenging on the Millionaire programme.

The story is told in flashbacks.  Jamal is being forced to explain his television success.  As his story unfolds, we also come to understand how he arrived at television success.  The simple fact was that each question had an answer that he had learned somewhere along the road of life.  The show's producers are not convinced but India is entranced.  Jamal is a folk hero.  But before the reader concludes that the game show is the heart of the plot, I must stress that it is not.  Rather, the true story is one of escape from dreadful poverty.  The settings of the film are thus often pathetic.  However, the power of the story always shines.

This film is well worth seeing.  Hollywood has produced nothing better during 2008.  I can only hope that the Oscars provide it with rewards.",1231545600,,1638,4.572413793103448
3746379,5,B001P9KR94,"Danny  Boyle is a filmmaker who crafts strong works of cinema.  What I mean by that is that his films don't just feature good acting, or fun scripts, or terrific pacing...but they make you feel quite clearly that the experience you've  just had is one you can only get by seeing a movie.

Let me illustrate in an obvious manner:  The recent film DOUBT is based on a play.  In seeing the film, I can also imagine seeing the stage show and probably not feeling greatly different about it.  It might be a good movie, but I don't feel it is IMPORTANT to have been told as a film.

Danny Boyle's best works (my favorites include TRAINSPOTTING, MILLIONS & 28 DAYS LATER) use EVERYTHING film has to offer.  Editing, composition, music and even variations in film stock and color saturation.  He tells his stories through all the elements that go into filmmaking...nothing is left to just sort of happen by itself.  And he also understands that film can TELL A STORY AT A MORE BLISTERING PACE THAN ANY OTHER MEDIA.  A book might be described as a ""fast read,"" but are we individually really capable of reading faster for one book or another?  A play might be ""fast paced"" but it is still padded with scene-changes and perhaps even an intermission.  TV can come close (if you have a channel without commercials), but unless you're watching it with a theatre-sized crowd...you don't get the group viewing experience that Boyle somehow knows how to play to.

His films are not perfect.  His blistering pace sometimes allows for some, frankly, sloppy performances or difficult to understand framing or editing.  His movies often have actors/characters with HEAVY accents, which can take a bit of attuning to.

So having blathered on for so long, we come at last to SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE.  This is probably Boyle's best film.  It has him at the top of his powers and a story that is truly fascinating and involving.  It also features the weaknesses of the past.

It's the story of two brothers, Jamal & Salim, living in a VERY poor neighborhood in Mumbai, India.  At a young age, they lose their mother, and thus spend some time in an orphanage (naturally one with a proprietor who DOESN'T have the best interests of his charges at heart).  They also spend most of their teen years living on the streets by their wits.  And then they become young adults and begin to make their ways in society.  Along the way, they are occasionally joined in their misadventures by Latika, a lovely young girl with whom Jamal falls more or less immediately in love, and the feelings might be mutual.

But the film is FAR, FAR from linear.  We open with the adult Jamal being tortured by two policemen.  Why?  Because Jamal is doing EXTREMELY well on India's version of WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE.  How could a  poor, young ""kid"" from the slums know so much?  He must be cheating.  But Jamal is able to explain to the police exactly why he knows each answer...because each answer took him back to a place in his past.  And as Jamal explains, we see the story of his life unfold.  It's a device so different and so clever as to bring a smile to my face.

Jamal and Salim led a very difficult life, and their personalities grew very much different.  Salim, the older brother, clearly bore the burdens of taking care of his brother with some difficulty, and he grows in his resentment of Jamal as he grows in his brutality.  Life has forced him to make some violent choices, and those actions have scarred him.  Jamal, as a young boy, is prankish and full of life, but grows to be somewhat passive.  He is smart though, and sees everything around him.  But what really gives his life meaning is the yearning to be with Latika.  He has almost infinite patience.  And when you see WHY he really went on MILLIONAIRE, you'll be touched.  It isn't just to win some money.

The three main characters are played by 3 different actors...children, teens, young adults.  The younger performers are excellent and thoroughly convincing.  The scenes of their childhood are brutal, funny, painful & even tender.  It's hard to believe India is a ""modern"" country when watching some of the early scenes of life in the slums.  Squalor has never seemed more squalid on film.  Boyle, using super-saturated film stock, practically makes the smell of the place come through the screen (which is scary indeed when a key early scene takes place in a public outhouse!).

How the lives of these three parallel, diverge, intersect and eventually achieve uneasy understanding is the heart of this film.  But Boyle also shows us that Mumbai (and the people of India) may be squalid, crowded & noisy but is also beautiful, vibrant and musical.  His editing, cinematography and soundtrack practically burst off the screen.  (And his recreation of MILLIONAIRE is pretty spot-on as well.)

In the center of the delightfully palpable story, a story that is both completely believable and charmingly magical, is Dev Patel, the young actor who plays the grown-up Jamal.  And while I understand that Jamal doesn't really come to life unless he's with his beloved Latika...Patel plays Jamal so anemically in so many scenes that he actually comes across as a little dullwitted...which is NOT how the younger versions of Jamal come across.  I have read a lot of reviews that fawn over this young man, but to me, he was the big flaw in Boyle's film.

The other flaw is the very breathless pacing that makes the film so energetic and immediate.  I sometimes wished, especially in early scenes, that Boyle has been able to slow down a little and give us a little background.  The film assumes we understand the socio/religious/political undercurrents that ran through India society...but I'm not really up on my history of India in the `80s/'90s.  I was left to speculate and fill in some blanks.

But while Patel's performance didn't move me as much as another performer's might have, I still  had myself one heck of a good time.  And to top it all off, the final scene (playing beneath the closing credits) and feature Patel and the radiant Freda Pinto (Latika) in easily the most joyous...heck, darn near perfect...closing credits I've ever seen.  It's worth seeing the whole movie for that scene alone...and the movie is quite a wonderful ride itself.",1231459200,3,6281,4.713235294117647
3746380,4,B001P9KR94,"The camera pans the white monoliths baking in the glaring Indian sun as Jamal's street smart brother Salim waves his hand towards the burgeoning panorama of construction concrete and dust and in a manner of introduction (he has not seen his sibling for years) explains that the site of this savvy new business park in Mumbai's boomtown of finance and commerce once contained the unbelievable (from a Western stance) dichotomy of vibrant patchwork color and dingy garbage-fill filth that like a Bizarro-World sunburnt vision of Legoland constructs the mire mosaic slum in which the Brothers Malik were born.

In director Danny Boyle's 2008 film ""Slumdog Millionaire"" one gets the impression that as the apprehensive Jamal, the child-to-teenage protagonist, struggles to emerge as a viable force with which to be reckoned in his own right--he consistently overcomes one trial of urban treachery after another as all the mythic heroes from Hercules, Jason and Krishna do, literally rising from a sludge of excrement in a moment of quasi-lightness as he imperturbably pursues a coveted autograph from a Bollywood actor helicoptered into the capital amidst a scattershot of plastic and cardboard garbage fluttering as innocuously as autumn leaves--so does modern day India strive to reinvent itself, wishing to shed its reputation of over population and poverty with the apparent ease of a bulldozer flattening acres of slum dwellings to reveal a real-time optical illusion of power and prosperity shimmering with the promise of world-class commercial status after the dust settles.

Whether or not Boyle had this analogy in mind, ""Slumdog Millionaire"" fascinates with its vivid depiction of a transitional India in a twist on the typical rag-to-riches storyline where grossly-over-populated-slum boy makes good and, of course, gets the girl of his dreams. Jamal, a chai-wallah (tea maestro) for a large telecommunications firm inadvertently finds himself on India's version of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire"" complete with smarmy jokes and a slick Bollywood version of Regis Philbin. Unlucky Slumdog, with just one question to go to win 20 million rupees, is arrested for cheating and spends most of the film's running time in the police station explaining through life-lesson rather than lifeline vignettes just how he knows the answers to questions that have stumped far more educated contestants. Through the devise of flashback, the audience cringes as Jamal and his older brother Salim played initially by younger child actors, watch their mother murdered by a marauding group of Muslim-hating crazies and as orphans fend in a horrific stomach-churning world of harsh endurance that seems more hellish than anything Dante could imagine.  Somehow they survive some downright disturbing almost vomit-inducing entrapments escaping from personifications of evil that Dickens would have loved to make you hate.  On average Boyle dishes up an extra huge serving of fraternal devotion with zings as tangy as an expertly concocted chutney as the brothers and Jamal's love interest, Latika, barrel through the underbelly of their country undergoing two other actor reincarnations before the final denouement revolving around the television game show studio hot seat.

Bottom Line?  ""Slumdog Millionaire"" gruesomely depicts an India that few would want to visit.  Set in Mumbai's Dharavi slum, the otherwise could-be predictability of the boy-meets-girl, boy-conquers-adversity formula escapist fare takes on the additional nuance of the travelogue, introducing the viewer beyond the Pillars of Hercules to an unfamiliar world where dragons lie and commerce wants to reign.  No one need `ask the audience' for the final answer on this flick--it surely entertains on a variety of levels despite its predictability and almost ruthless exploitation of the viewer's emotions.  Recommended especially for young adults.

3746381,5,B001P9KR94,"Slumdog Millionaire (2008) is a very good movie with the astounding cinematography, virtuoso directing, and the heartbreaking yet optimistic story. The acting by three main characters especially by a newcomer, Dev Patel, is compelling. Patel plays a street kid Jamal Malik (Patel), an 18 year-old orphan from the slums of Mumbai, who made it to the Indian version of the TV show Who wants to be a millionaire?"" and keeps answering correctly every question. The secret is that every question represents a chapter of his own life, his growing up and surviving on the streets, his adventures and experiences often dramatic and even tragic. When he is just one question away from winning 20 million rupees (around $450,000), the time is up, and millions of TV-viewers who root for Jamal would have to wait for the following night to see him go for the big prize. Jamal is arrested by the police right after the game and he will spend the next day been rather brutally interrogated by police officers who want to find out how the street boy with no education can answer the difficult questions correctly. Fifteen years from the lives of Jamal, his older brother Salem and another orphan from the slums of Mumbai, ""the third musketeer"", the girl named Latika (Frieda Pinto), Jamal's true love since their childhood will reveal in flashbacks, and by the end of Jamal's story, it won't surprise us why he knows all answers. IMO, the only weak point in the story was the big 20 million rupees question. I won't reveal it but trust me, the whole reading or movie watching world knows the answer, and the question was too easy for such high stake BUT it fits the story very well, so I tend to be lenient.

The best part of the movie is IMO the look at India from within, the glorious views of India's beauty and horrifying captures of its unspeakable poverty, from the slums of Mumbai and the dizzyingly crowded streets of Bombay to the heavenly magnificent Taj Mahal.

Boyle's directing very much reminds Fernando Meirelles inspiring movie-making in Cidade de Deus aka City of God by its dynamism, fast and furious camera movements, and amazingly deep and compassionate understanding of the material. I won't be surprised if Doyle receives the Oscar nod for directing. He very well deserved it along with his camera-man, editor, writer, and the young actors.",1231113600,2,2348,4.823821339950372
3746382,5,B001P9KR94,"If you think you've ever had it rough, meet Jamal.

He has learned about life  not through book smarts but  by living it.  Appearing on the popular quiz show, he somehow knows the answers.  The narcissistic tv host mocks him as a  'chai wallah,'  (tea boy) yet Jamal remains unfazed.

Suddenly, we see the police torturing this slightly built young man to admit he cheated and forfeit the opportunity for the big prize.  The realisation dawns that Jamal is tougher than he seems, and so the story begins.

It's not about the money, and it's not about the quiz show.  It's more about how character is forged not by adversity, but how you respond to it.

As he tells his story the police officer gets caught up in it. ""What happened to the girl?,"" he asks, the same question we're asking.

It's a twin story showing the contrast, between the two brothers, who both have similar experiences.  Both make entirely different decisions that lead them down two certain but separate paths.  These conflicts drive the narrative at rocket like speed.  Latika, the orphan girl, is the damsel in distress, the subject of desire and conflict.

In fact life is harder for Jamal, because of a certain someone, one of a series of antagonists, as you will see, yet Jamal remains resilient, resourceful, and has a capacity for love and even forgiveness, that is indeed inspiring.

Slumdog has already won numerous film awards, particularly for Danny Boyle, who previously directed Shallow Grave, and Trainspotting.  It's also been nominated for 4 Golden Globes for Best Director, Motion Picture, Score and Screenplay. It does deserve Academy Awards for Best Picture, Direction, and Screenplay.  I suspect though, that this will be the year of Doubt.

Some people compare this movie to Dickens. I find it more similar to Black Book by Paul Verhoeven, where the protagonist is also a survivor against the odds, and with Slumdog I felt that same feeling of being totally caught up in the emotional rollercoaster of a story that played out onscreen.

If you are interested in more Indian fare, consider The Guru, Bend it Like Beckham, and Bride and Prejudice, an amusing Bollywood parody of Pride and Prejudice, featuring Aishwarya Rai, proclaimed by Julia Roberts to be the most beautiful woman in the world.

Author Vikas Swarup wrote the book Q and A on which Slumdog is loosely based.

3746393,5,B001P9KR94,"Essentially, this movie is about a bum who rises to become a millionaire through a famous TV show that was all the craze in India shortly after it was big in the US. There's more to the story than this, but I really don't want to spoil anything. Other than being set in India, I never felt compelled to see this film, especially after the Totally Rad Show's verdict was not to seek it out, but my sister-in-law loved it enough to convince us, and it was definitely a pleasant surprise.

Though the director isn't Indian so technically this isn't a Bollywood movie, I really wish that we had more Bollywood movies like this. A movie like this could definitely make an Indian man feel more proud about his country's cinema. I understand that Bollywood musicals have their place and I'm fine with that, I just wish it would produce films like this that cast India in this light that the world doesn't see: ugliness and beauty all at once permeating the streets. Any scenes that were set on the streets definitely gave me that vibe, and the cinematography was a big part of that. I didn't like how often the camera tried to give the audience a vertigo effect, but other than that it was quite impressive. The casting choices reminded me of Pan Labyrinth in that each one seemed to fit perfectly since these are actors/actresses you've never seen before and they do such a great job of portraying these characters that you don't imagine them in a world outside this movie. The music in this movie was also something that stood out to me: every song really held its own and they've since been stuck in my head at random times because their poignancy really resonated with me.

If all those things weren't enough, it was one of those movies where we were talking about it long after we left the theater and debating motivations and plot points and such. Even though it can try to be too obvious at times with themes and symbols, you can forgive it because it tells the story so well. I was worried that parts of the movie would feel contrived, but I thought that things flowed rather smoothly. If I had one complaint about this film, it would probably be that the pacing felt a bit off. It definitely felt like a long movie, and it was only 2 hours long. I strongly recommend running out and catching this movie if it's playing in your city, or keeping it in mind to rent later this year if you can't see it now. I give it an A+ and say that it's worth seeking out because I feel like it tells a very unique story in a great way and it does suspense so well that I'd compare that element of it to the likes of 24.",1231113600,,2606,4.360082304526749

I thought to myself hey I have enough personal troubles to be watching this sad movie but I soldiered on and stayed to see the rest and it did not disappoint. I loved it once I was done with it. Great movie, great story line and good acting. It's a modern love story of the sort you can not see in Hollywood. It's a story about humanity and good vs evil. Still, you could have faith in good nature human beings like Jamal and Latika. Even Salim redeemed his soul by taking on his boss.

3746395,5,B001P9KR94,"It's difficult to categorize a film that takes as many precariously driven dramatic turns as this 2008 picture directed by the versatile Danny Boyle. So why even bother since he manages to navigate fluidly between the feel-bad and feel-good extremes of Simon Beaufoy's (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Miss-Pettigrew-Lives-for-a-Day/dp/B0018M6J90/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day</a>) emotionally dense script with aplomb? The apt title refers to someone who grew up in the slums of Mumbai, and in this case, is on the verge of becoming very wealthy due to a serendipitous situation that leads him to be a finalist on the Hindi version of ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"" On the surface, the premise sounds rather silly, but the familiar game show, already a trivia footnote in this country, provides the catalyst for the vividly rendered events that unfold for one particular boy named Jamal Malik, a coffee carrier at a local telemarketing company. Contrivances aside, it is his life experiences that feed him the answers to the increasingly difficult questions, but the producers suspect a scam at work and have the police torture him in order to confess. What really emerges is Malik's undying devotion to his one true love, Latika, from whom he has long been estranged due to the desperate circumstances in her life.

The movie's childhood flashbacks have a Dickens-level quality set against a cultural tableau unfamiliar to most of us. They focus on young Jamal and his older brother Salim, who are soon orphaned after their mother is killed for being a Muslim. They are joined by another abandoned orphan Latika, and together they dub themselves the Three Musketeers. They eventually find themselves indentured under the servitude of the deceptively kind Maman, who goes to extremes in keeping the children as street beggars. The brothers escape and eventually figure out how to scam tourists at the Taj Mahal, while Latika suffers the consequences of being left with Maman. The rest of the plot shows how the brothers diverge in values and how Latika becomes an unwilling mistress for a rival gang leader. Amazingly, Beaufoy's screenplay juxtaposes these spiraling events with the multiple-choice questions posed by Prem, the jocular ""Millionaire"" host, a popular figure who reveals his own sleazy underside in short order. There is such a swirl of activity with every episode in the film that there is little time to question the plausibility of the many plot turns because the resulting implausibility is what makes the movie so arresting.

Boyle gives co-directing credit to Loveleen Tandan, previously a casting director specializing in India-themed films like Mira Nair's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monsoon-Wedding/dp/B00006AW0I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monsoon Wedding</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vanity-Fair/dp/B0006FO8E8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vanity Fair</a>, and it's obvious that the combination of their talents gives us a greater intimacy into India than one would expect from Boyle by himself. Other than his charming fable,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Millions/dp/B000AP04GK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Millions</a>, there is little indication in Boyle's resume (the sci-fi shocker&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sunshine/dp/B000Y7U98C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sunshine</a>, the post-apocalyptic thriller&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/28-Days-Later/dp/B00005JMA8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">28 Days Later</a>, the drug-infested&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Trainspotting/dp/B0001XALTG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Trainspotting</a>) that he would have been capable of telling such a fanciful tale so convincingly. At the same time, the visual flourishes (thanks primarily to the stunning cinematography by Anthony Dod Mantel) and fast-cut editing reflect his familiar touches. The no-frills performances befit the story with Dev Patel bringing emotional focus to the grown Jamal and Frieda Pinto appropriately fetching as the grown Latika. Smaller roles are filled with a few more familiar faces with Indian movie icon Anil Koopar playing Prem and character actor Irrfan Khan (the father in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Namesake/dp/B000U2U0E4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Namesake</a>) as the determined police inspector.

3746396,5,B001P9KR94,"I'm going to try and do this film justice by reviewing it with as keen an eye as I can muster, but I fear I'll still fall far short of the mark ...so here goes...

SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE is the best movie of the year for a couple of reasons. The first is that it is both compartmentalized and global at the same time. It harkened me back to my love of another favorite film of mine,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Usual-Suspects/dp/B00000F214/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Usual Suspects</a>, in which a man sits in a police station and tells his story in flashback. But any similarities between these two ends with the police station and their equally excellent scripts (sidenote: The Usual Suspect remains my top favorite film script of all time but this one's pulling up close).

Slumdog takes place at a police station as young man named Jamal (Dev Patel) goes through a tortuous interrogation at the hands of India's police force. Having recently been on India's version of ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire"" -- and answered all of the questions correctly so far -- he was whisked off to the local constables office on the possibility of having cheated. The show has had lawyers, doctors, physicists, and many other well-educated people on the show who didn't get as far as Jamal, so how did he -- a chai tea delivery boy -- get so far (only one more question remains and he'll have his million)?

The story is complex, funny, grotesque, horrible and loving, all within the same breath. Each answer comes not from Jamal's limited education, but from his time on India's hard-bitten streets where he grew up an orphan along with his brother, Salim (Madhur Mittal). Having watched their mother murdered during a religious uprising against Muslims, Jamal and Salim had to make their way in the world on their own, their paths separating wildly and then re-merging, often years later. But during their younger days as little kids, they encountered a pretty young orphan girl named Latika (the amazingly beautiful Freida Pinto), whom Jamal finds an instant fascination with. And it is his fascination and love for her that will drive him for the rest of his young life ...which include his chances on the millionaire show. Separated time and again (including thanks to the departure from his brother as he falls in with some very bad gangsters), Jamal never gives up his quest to be with her, even when it seems impossible.

It is Jamal's remembrances of his street life that are the hardest to watch, making for some gritty scenes (and some funny ones, including a scene where Jamal must jump down a latrine hole in order to escape and get a much-wanted autograph from a local movie star). Forced child labor is nothing new in India's slums, and it is brought into nauseating focus as we watch kids beaten, deformed (""Blind singers earn twice as much"") and sent onto the streets to beg for money ...all at the hands of adults wanting to take advantage no matter the cost.

The stories back and forth nature (like the aforementioned The Usual Suspects) was a great way to show Jamal's life in a bubble. The audience really, really, really cared for him and wanted to see him win (the show I went to had audience members applauding -- loudly -- when the film ended), showing how well the script was put together and how well acted the film was by these relative unknowns (the only actor I was familiar with was Irrfan Khan who was in another favorite Bollywood film of mine entitled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Namesake/dp/B000U2U0E4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Namesake</a>&nbsp;...note: see that movie, too!)

Hollywood should take note of this film, and apparently has as the Golden Globes have come out with their nominations (2008) and listed it among four categories (Best Director, Best Motion Picture - Drama, Best Original Score, and Best Screenplay).

One final note: This film is truly an independent, tolling in at $15 million for production costs. I've seen much, much lesser films (in terms of quality) that had a budget ten times that. But one can't forget that filming in India is much cheaper than here in the States. Still, Hollywood, take notice! This is what great cinema is all about.

Oscars! Here comes Bollywood!",1230940800,,4332,5.023676880222841
3746397,5,B001P9KR94,"""Slumdog Millionaire"", the new film from director Danny Boyle (""Trainspotting"", ""28 Days Later"") is the foreign film break out this year. There is always one. One film containing believable characters, an interesting story and great filmmaking that attracts more than the core audience of foreign film aficionados. ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is the film that will play in multiplexes across the country.

Jamal (Dev Patel, BBC America's ""Skins"") is a contestant on the Hindi version of ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire"" and he is doing quite well, surprising everyone even the show's host, Prem Kumar (Anil Kapoor), an oilier version of our own Regis. Jamal reaches a very high plateau just as time runs out. Join us tomorrow as Jamal goes for the big 4 million-rupee question. As Jamal and Prem walk backstage, two cops take Jamal in and begin interrogating him. A little slum dog like him could not possibly have the intelligence or knowledge to make it this far. Doctors and professors don't make it this far. He must be cheating. Who is helping him? How is he doing it? Thus begins ""Slumdog Millionaire"", director Danny Boyle's newest creation and a film that easily erases any memory of the travesty he last perpetrated on us. (That was called ""Sunshine"" and I don't recommend it. At all. In fact, sorry to bring it up again.)

As Jamal sits in the police station, the Inspector (Irrfan Khan, ""A Mighty Heart"", ""The Namesake"", ""The Darjeeling Limited"") shows a VHS tape of the show he was just on, starting with his introduction. Everyone politely applauds as Jamal enters and Prem tries to get a few personal facts out of the young man. When Jamal manages to make the audience laugh, at Prem's expense, the tides turn and Prem, always aware of his status as one of India's biggest personalities, is a bit taken back. But as he is being watched by millions of people, he laughs it off. They start with the easy questions and Jamal answers the first.

For each of the questions, we revisit a part of Jamal's life, watching how he grew up in the slums, the lengths he would go to to get an autograph from one of his favorite stars, a particularly harrowing stay in an orphanage right out of a Dickens's novel and much more. We quickly get the rhythm director Boyle wants to show us. Jamal is able to answer all of these questions because he has experienced something in his life providing him with the answer. It is almost as though he is fated to appear on the show at this time, because all of the questions seem to be written for him, catering to his knowledge.

The film presents an episode from Jamal's life to give us the background on how he obtained the knowledge necessary to answer the question. And as we watch these moments, most form the coherent narrative of the young man's life to this point. Early on, he becomes an orphan, living on the mean streets of Bombay with his older brother, Salim, and an orphan girl named Latika, whom they befriend and adopt. As Jamal grows up, he makes decisions that will affect his life based on Salim and Latika. In fact, early on, he develops a love for Latika, believing her to be the most beautiful woman in the world. Throughout his life, she is always on his mind and he desperately wants a reunion. Again, the fates seem to step in.

As the story follows many twists and turns, Jamal, Salim and Latika end up in an orphanage where all the children are expected to sing, literally, for their supper. When they achieve a certain skill, the director of the orphanage uses a truly Dickensian method to eke more money out of the children's earnings as street performers and beggars.

Jamal does not have an easy life and all of these harrowing moments are shown to us, giving us a unique portrait of what his life is like and a snapshot of the time and place.

As a young man, Jamal's infatuation with Latika (Freida Pinto) knows no bounds and he tries to relocate his brother, now a well-known enforcer for a local gangster, in the hopes of locating her again. When he finds out she is the 'kept' girl of the same gangster, he decides to pay her a visit. He soon realizes he must have money, to help them both escape, and decides to appear on her favorite show, ""Who Wants to Be A Millionaire?"" He figures any money he wins will help them and his appearance will also attract her attention, proving his love and devotion. More, it will provide a sort of calling card to her, hopefully prompting her to take the next step and meet him, so they can run off together.

He surprises himself when he realizes he knows most of the questions.

At first, Prem is entertained by the little 'slumdog' sitting in the chair opposite him. His appearance could only help improve the already outstanding ratings of his show, and increase his already great star power. But Jamal gets over his stage fright too quickly and begins to verbally spar with the host of the popular show. Then he begins to answer many questions right.

How is he able to answer questions that doctors and lawyers have failed at? Therein lies the story.

Prem tries to maintain his show's reputation and the suspense by drawing things out as much as possible. When they reach a high plateau, he is happy to realize they have run out of time. The 'slumdog' will have to return tomorrow. His director and producers are thrilled, but Prem is happy to see the police take him away.

Directed by Danny Boyle and Loveleen Tandan and written by Simon Beaufroy (""The Full Monty""), ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is very close to a perfect film. Boyle and his co-director weave a stunningly complex tale of three young people who start out the same and follow their lives down different paths. It is the lifelong love Jamal has for Latika that will bring them all back together in a completely rousing, believable and very romantic finale.

Naturally, there are moments as terrifying as others are amusing. Yet, Boyle achieves a fine balance making them all seem believable and taking us on a journey through many emotions. One moment we might laugh at Jamal's predicament, the next cry at his misfortune. The remarkable thing about this is that Boyle manages to make everything seem natural, to flow with ease. Nothing ever seems forced or cinematic.

Quite honestly, there isn't a single thing I can think of to criticize about this film. No false steps, no story holes, none of the acting sticks out for the wrong reasons. What is clear is that Boyle and his team film many scenes in India, on the crowded streets of Mumbai, in the slums, making the film all the more authentic. I know this must seem like a given, but it is difficult to control all of the elements of a film shoot on any actual city street. When you multiply the crowds and decrease the size of the streets, the job becomes all the more difficult. Yet, there are a surprising number of scenes set outside in Mumbai and in very wretched, horrible looking slums.

There have been more than a few films in the last few years to use game shows as part of the story, providing a certain amount of dramatic subtext to the main character's story. Generally, these seem forced and don't really work. In ""Slumdog Millionaire"", there is a key difference; the game show host is a character in the film, involved in the story and the game show is used as a framing device to show us various key moments in Jamal's life. This technique is so much more inherently engaging it makes all the difference in the world.

Even the overly romantic nature of the climax seems well earned by the viewer and fits with the rest of the story.

Boyle is a very good filmmaker who takes his time and seeks out the right projects. When he finds the right project, because there have been missteps (""Sunshine"", ""A Life Less Ordinary""), he knocks them out of the ballpark.",1230854400,,7801,4.592672413793103
3746398,3,B001P9KR94,"For something that was meant to be a fable, Danny Boyle's ""Slumdog Millionaire"" takes itself far too seriously. It's a story of both the Rags to Riches and Love Conquers All persuasions, about an eighteen-year-old Indian boy who becomes a contestant on the Hindi version of ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"" All throughout, his draws on life experience to select the answers. And what a life he has led; he came from nothing, a penniless orphan from the streets of Mumbai (formerly known as Bombay), and he grew up surrounded by poverty, violence, and abuse at the hand of unscrupulous people. I find it odd that Boyle, screenwriter Simon Beaufoy, and author Vikas Swarup (who wrote ""Q and A,"" the book on which this movie is based) were able to evoke so much hope, especially since it's unlikely the main characters would have survived past the age of ten.

As I watched this movie, I made mental comparisons to last year's brilliant ""August Rush,"" which is thematically similar. The thing is, ""August Rush"" had the good sense to be totally unrealistic, which in turn allowed me to engage the story at a more emotional level. If the intention was for ""Slumdog Millionaire"" to be a heightened version of reality, then it didn't go far enough. When it comes to fairy tales, modern-day or otherwise, you either go all the way over the top, or you stay grounded--finding a gray area doesn't really get the job done.

""Slumdog Millionaire"" tells the extraordinary story of Jamal Malik, who was born in the slums and raised with very little to his name. His life was anything but boring: when he was just a young boy (Ayush Mahesh Khedekar), he managed to get an autograph from Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan; he witnessed the death of his mother, who was brutally beaten to death during an anti-Muslim raid; he and his brother Salim (Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail) befriended an impoverished, parentless girl named Latika (Rubiana Ali). All three are taken in by the villainous Maman (Ankur Vikal), a gangster who forces destitute orphans to beg for money by singing. Some of his children are blinded so as to make them seem even more pathetic. Jamal and Salim are able to escape, but poor Latika is left behind, forcing her into a life of prostitution.

The story flashes forward some years, at which point Jamal (Tanay Hemant Chheda) and Salim (Ashutosh Lobo Gajiwala) are teenagers barely getting by as souvenir sellers, pickpockets, and phony tour guides at the Taj Mahal. Jamal insists that they return to Mumbai to find Latika (Tanvi Ganesh Lonkar). At this point, we see just how different Jamal and Salim are: the former is hopeful and patient while the latter is hotheaded and easily impressionable. Upon returning to Mumbai, he seeks out a rival crime lord named Javed (Mahesh Manjrekar) and vies to be a part of his gang. This coupled with the discovery of Latika forces a divide between the two brothers.

And this brings me to the present day, where Jamal (Dev Patel) works as a tea-fetching assistant at an Indian call center. In attempting to get back in touch with Latika (Freida Pinto), he tries out for ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"" which is so popular that he knows she will be watching. A physical reunion won't be so easy; Latika is kept in line by Salim (Madhur Mittal), who Javed has since promoted. If Jamal wins the game show, he just might be able to take Latika away from Mumbai and live happily ever after.

Interwoven throughout the entire film are police interrogation scenes involving Jamal and a sergeant named Srinivas (Saurabh Shukla). I won't go into great detail here, but I will say that it directly relates to ""Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"" I'll also say that each of their scenes kick starts another flashback sequence that explains how Jamal answered specific questions on the show.

It's an intriguing concept, and I'll admit that some of ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is satisfying. But a lot more of it is disappointing. Partly, it has to do with Jamal's sense of optimism, which seems a little overplayed given his terrible circumstances. I never really believed that someone so downtrodden could have so much to live for. A very negative thing to say, I know, but I really do feel that way. And while I get that this movie is supposed to be a fable, I still feel that too much of it is rooted in harsh reality. It certainly doesn't fit with the end credit sequence, which features a completely ill fitting Bollywood-style musical number. ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is a decent effort, but it doesn't quite measure up as far as escapist fantasies are concerned.",1230681600,4,4595,4.773584905660377
3746399,5,B001P9KR94,"Is not who wants to be a millionaire in this case, but why Jamal Malik (Dev Patel), wants to be a millionaire--and how he's getting the answers to questions on the Indian variant of the gameshow that have stumped far better men than he. Was he cheating? Did he have an accomplice?  Was it just dumb luck?

Or was it written?

As a matter of fact, the police have hauled him in to answer that question.  Sergeant Srinivas (Saurabh Shukla) uses some very rough questioning techniques to find out the truth.  Out of this, comes an incredible lifestory of a young man who's persisted to this point despite pretty amazing odds against him.  Frankly, the odds against his survival in the streets are about as good as him winning the 20 million that is the ultimate prize of the show.

As the questioning continues, Jamal reveals bits of his life that have helped him come to this point and the answers to the questions asked.

""Slumdog Millionaire"" is not an easy watch.  Some scenes will haunt you for a good long time and may well change your perspective on your own life.  It's also a beautiful and fascinating film.  I wouldn't miss a moment of it and if you have the courage to see some rough scenes, I strongly recommend it.

One of the best films of 2008?  One of the best of the past 10 or so years, actually.

Not only is the cinematography breathtaking (the realism and graphic imagery is searing), but the acting is amazing and the story is especially relevant to today's global situation (and the timing could not be more on point, considering the recent incident of terrorist violence in Mumbai).

SLUMDOG is set in the slums of Mumbai, and follows young street urchin cum game show contestant, Jamal Malik (Dev Patel).  He has the chance to win the big rupee prize on the Indian version of WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE.  No one can believe that he is answering the questions correctly without cheating.  Malik is in love with Latika (Freida Pinto) who has been taken into  a gang members den, to be groomed as a prostitute, with her virginity to be auctioned off to the highest bidder.  They both come from poverty and profound pain.  Life has dealt them damn near impossible cards, and, yet, they keep on going with heads held high in the face of tremendous (and, at times excruciating) adversity.  We see Jamal's evolution from boy to man.  In the end, it is not the promise of money that does that to him.  It is, perhaps, something on a higher plane.

I won't divulge any more details here.  You just need to see this film for yourself.  It will quite possibly change your life, the way you view your existence and also the life you are living and how you want to live it, as well as humbling all of us to the great bounty and possibility that exists in this world (regardless of class, caste, culture, ethnicity, religion or way of life).

3746405,5,B001P9KR94,"How can Jamal Malik, a poor boy from the slums of Mumbai, be one answer away from the grand prize on India's version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?  This is the question that launches Danny Boyle's tenderly sublime Slumdog Millionaire, 2008's best chance at a film that will both earn the respect of critics and satisfy audiences (well, other than that little movie about a billionaire moonlighting as a crime-fighter).

The film begins just as Jamal's first episode on Millionaire has ended, when the sounding alarm prevents India's version of Regis from asking the final question.  Because of Jamal's lowly socio-economic status, the producers and authorities believe him to be a cheat and begin a Guantanamo-like search for answers.  After some brutal torture tactics (yes, brutal) do not achieve the desired results, Jamal is able to plead his innocence by explaining how he knew the answers to the questions.

Each answer comes with a vignette from his young life, and those scenes make up the majority of the film.  In the accompanying story to his answer about a poet, we learn of a time when he sang poems as a street beggar and in his answer to ""who invented the revolver"", we hear about the time he saw a gun fired.  Something almost supernatural seems to be at play, as it appears that someone followed Jamal through his life and selected questions relating to moments forever burned into his memory.

An ever-present theme to his stories is his desire to reconnect with a girl from his youth.  Like Estella to Pip or Jenny to Forrest, Jamal's Latika is a girl who first stumbled into his life at a young age and has lived in his dreams ever since.  Even in the most dire circumstances and seemingly unlivable conditions, Jamal is able to survive in part because of his memories of Latika and his need to find her, to rescue her, and to care for her.

Equal parts David Copperfield and Artful Dodger, Jamal is always shown to be clever, resilient and slippery.  For a film that's sure to inspire audiences with its sweet, enchanting core, we're also given a look at the horrors of poverty, the absurdity of religious warring and the gloomy life of orphans.  It's impossible to not think of the kids like Jamal and Latika who aren't able to escape the slums, but that's a story for another day.  The one we're given is a refreshing mixture of romance, adventure and coming of age poignancy, all wrapped up in an immediately identifiable piece of pop culture.

3746406,5,B001P9KR94,"This heartrending story of an orphan who gets within a question from winning 22 Million Rupees on the Indian version of ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire"" is simply one of 2008's best films. Jamal Malik (Dev Patel), an 18 year-old orphan, has lived the hard-knock life, so that when he gets to each question posed by the slimy narcissistic host (Anil Kappor), there was some tragedy in his life to illuminate the answer.

""Slumdog Millionaire"" highlights the cavernous divide between India's nouveau riche and it's impoverished. As Jamal and his orphaned brother start out, they are driven from the slums by a murderous religious riot (where the cops act annoyed as a flaming body races by screaming), the find themselves in a nightmare Orphan camp, pimped out by a deadly keeper, caught inside the web of an Indian Mobster's empire, and then Jamal finally incarcerated by sadistic law enforcement. He's a mere question from beating the game, yet no-one wants to admit that this ""slumdog"" could know so much.

The difference between knowledge and experience is what drives ""Slumdog Millionaire,"" and what drives Jamal is his love for Lakita (the stunning beauty, Freida Pinto). Even as his brother and he grow apart, Jamal can't stop pursuing his dream, and like all the good fairy-tales, ""Slumdog Millionaire"" has both a Prince and Princess.

The settings move from the bleakest - the slums outside Mumbai, where our hero, Jamal Malik, lives as a child with his older brother Salim - to high rise vistas and no less than the Taj Mahal. The story ranges from the worst despair and heartbreak to the noblest sacrifice and most romantic love.

We are introduced in the opening moments to the young adult Jamal, played by Dev Patel. He is a contestant on the Indian version of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire and has just answered the ten million rupee question prior to the end of the show. His next question will be worth twenty million rupees, an unimaginable fortune to the average Hindi. The arrogant, primping star of the show, played with artificial charm concealing an oily narcissism by Anil Kapoor, cannot stand that young Jamal is stealing some of his spotlight, and believes that the young, uneducated ""slumdog"" is cheating. (One of the key sequences involves the host ""proving"" to himself that Jamal MUST be cheating.) Jamal has been handed over to the police, who torture him to make him confess his deception. This moment in Jamal's life frames the rest of the film, told in flashback, and explains the torturous road that allowed Jamal to answer even the most difficult questions.

We are not told about Jamal and Salim's father, but in an early sequence we see their mother murdered in a brutal religion riot as club-wielding Hindu's attack a Muslim slum. Orphaned, Jamal and Salim live in the trash dump at the edge of the slum. They befriend another orphan, the young girl Latika.

The remainder of the film fills in the gaps of the lives of Jamal and Salim and Latika, who call themselves the Three Musketeers, but only got far enough in school before the murder of their mother to learn the names Athos and Porthos. Along the way they encounter police brutality, orphanage directors who make Fagin and Bill Sykes look like Mother Teresa, as well as Indian gangsters and other people-traffickers. Several sequences show us that Salim is becoming hardened by their harsh life, although he retains a degree of love for Jamal. For his part Jamal makes the most of what life gives him. He only resorts to the criminal activities Salim sees as the only way to make it out of necessity. At two different times Jamal is heart-breakingly separated from Latika, and at one level the entire film is a love story about Jamal's single-minded dedication to reunite with the only girl he ever loved. (Nine astonishing performances are given of the ""Three Musketeers"" at three different ages of life, and it is appropriate to give credit to Ayush Mahesh Khedekar, Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail and Rubiana Ali as the youngest Jamal, Salim and Latika as well as Tanay Chheda, Ashutosh Lobo Gajiwala and Tanvi Ganesh Lonkar as the just-past-puberty versions. Dev Patel and the beautiful Freida Pinto may become international sensations as the adult star-crossed lovers. Madhur Mittal has less screen time as the adult Salim, but his character plays an important role.)

The faint-hearted should know that the language could appear on American television and that there is no nudity, but the violence, in particular two torture scenes, are flinch-inducing.

Slumdog is a piece of fiction - a fantasy - but it includes real emotions and believable human characters. I walked from the theater feeling a little better about being alive, and knowing that I had just viewed a stunning artistic achievement.

Although I've seen some really good movies this year, I can say with confidence that SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE is the one that I've enjoyed most. It has already generated perhaps the best critical reviews of any film released in 2008 and has won audience awards at notable film festivals. The film completely lives up to the hype that has surrounded it.

In the first couple of minutes of the film we learn several things. First, Jamal, a Muslim who is a product of the slums, is a participant on the Indian version of WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE? Second, he is suspected of cheating and is subjected to horrific torture at the hands of the police. Gradually, after having failed to elicit confessions of how he had cheated, Jamal related, while they all watch a video of his television appearance, how he knew the answers of each of the questions. The result is a series of flashbacks that essentially tell the story of Jamal's life and his relations with the two most important relationships in his life, that of his street smart but sometimes amoral brother Salim, and Latika. These scenes are set in some of the most horrific squalor that one can imagine. It may seem unrealistic that someone could come out of such wretched life experiences as relatively unscarred as Jamal appears to be, but that is in part because at heart the film is a fairy tale. It is not an expose of the abuses of modern economic life. At heart it is a love story.

I am not a big fan of director Danny Boyle, not having enjoyed at all 28 DAYS or TRAINSPOTTING or his other efforts, but his work here is nothing short of miraculous. I knew none of the cast, though I've read that several members are well known Bollywood actors. This film, I have to hasten to add, has nothing in common with a Bollywood film apart from some of the actors. Though filmed in India, this is every bit a Western film. There are many marvelous performances, not least Dev Patel as Jamal. There are a number of child actors who turn in remarkable performances. And as the grown up Latika, the newcomer Freida Pinto is fascinating to look at with her almost surreal beauty.

As I said, despite the squalid settings for much of the film, this is a fairy tale, a love story. But even knowing that the film ends as a fairy tale does not prepare one for the particulars. There were a number of ways that it might have ended and while the ending wasn't completely unexpected, it wasn't entirely predictable. In the end, this was a thoroughly enjoyable film, equal parts love story and comedy, set against the backdrop of almost inconceivable squalor. There has been talk of this Indie film perhaps pulling a LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE and receiving some Oscar attention. We can only hope.",1229644800,,2784,4.573146292585171
3746412,5,B001P9KR94,"As an Indian, I was cynical about this movie being as brilliant as the grapevine was insisting. I expected another Monsoon Wedding but got a punch to my gut as Slumdog and its outstanding music trasported me into the lives of Jamal, Salim and Latika.

For those who are saying it's a fantasy film -yes and no. As a young Jamal tells an Amercian couple while being slapped by their driver, 'You want to see the real India? This is it!'.

The sights, smells, noise, color, filth, frenetic pace and lethargic morals - it's all India, albeit through a Danny Boyle lens. A bit larger than life, a bit made up (police in India are not that bad), but nevertheless believable. Street urchins are frequently very smart and have a survival instinct a few notches above the average couch potato.

Most of you will have seen the movie or the trailer by now, and know the storyline, so I won't go into those details. For me, this movie was a winner because Jamal teaches us the meaning of life with a winsome smile. He is a victim, but wants to be a winner by finding the most important thing in the world -love. He doesn't know how to give up because that's never been an option with him. He lives, he loves, he rises above till the skies bend down to touch him.",1229299200,3,1250,4.356223175965665

From ""28 Days Later"" to ""Slumdog Millionaire"". The only thing any of these movies have in common is they're extraordinary works of filmmaking that both critics and consumers seem to love. And you won't find a blockbuster among them, and you probably never will from Mr. Boyle. But the lack of box office recognition will probably be the last thing on Boyle's mind come award season when ""Slumdog Millionaire"" predictably becomes an Academy Award sleeper. Is it that good? You betcha!

The style, the substance, the tone, the story all scream wow! And all defy description. It's a heart wrenching, gut wrenching, heart tugging, heart warming, soul searching, spirit lifting, epic drama that is as much romantic as it is harrowing, as suspenseful as it is funny.

Slumdog is the name attached to orphans that grow up in the human cesspool of Mumbai India that somehow manage to survive much like poly wags would in stagnant pools of waste back here in America. Against all odds. Miracle against miracle, this slumdog grows into a smart, streetwise young man, who makes it onto India's version of ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?"" And...well, without spoiling the film, all I'll say is ""he doesn't."" ""Want to be a millionaire, that is.""

Smart, intuitive, unpredictable and refreshing. With a Hollywood ending that's only succeeded by it's Bollywood ending. Is this one of my favorite movies of the year? You betcha!

The film's location and occasional use of subtitles will dampen it's overall appeal. But this should find a very loyal and enthusiastic following on DVD and Blu Ray.",1228521600,,1707,4.958041958041958

If that doesn't tell you that he'll be the next big ""crossover"" star, nothing will!",1228262400,,353,3.9859154929577465
3746428,5,B001P9KR94,"It's fresh and it's magical and horrific.  It's the hero's story of a quest.  And it's the story of the city of Mumbai, India, with its vast contrasts of utter poverty in an emerging modern world.  It moves with lightning speed and I found myself smiling one minute and grimacing in disgust in another.  It's an emotional roller coaster ride that left me exhilarated and convinced that this breakthrough film is a true global masterpiece.

The film opens as a young Indian man competes on a television quiz show.  He is winning and winning. In the next scene he is being tortured by the police because they think he is cheating as he is not educated and is a child of the slums.  His story is then told in flashbacks, as the audience learns how he came to know the answers to each of the questions.

We meet him and his brother as young children living on the street and exploited by gangsters to become street beggars.  However, there is constant humor in juxtaposition to the wince-inducing revulsion which adds a special kind of humanity to the story.  Through all the misfortunes to which the brothers are exposed, there is an upbeat quality to the film, as we come to understand that it was these traumatic incidents in this young man's life that taught him the specific answers to the question being asked on the quiz show.

Of course there is also a romance.  Our hero is looking for the young woman he loves, a childhood companion through the horror, who is still being exploited by the Indian underworld, which now includes his brother.

All of this is packed in an upbeat and moving story that involved me from the beginning and made me want to stand up and cheer at the happy ending.

This is not a film to be missed.  It breaks all the stereotypes and comes across as a groundbreaking fresh new voice in the landscape of the world of film.  I give it my highest recommendation.",1227052800,92,1889,4.511764705882353
3746429,5,B001P9KR94,"Warning!  Minor spoilers can be found in this review!

Although I've seen some really good movies this year, I can say with confidence that SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE is the one that I've enjoyed most.  It has already generated perhaps the best critical reviews of any film released in 2008 and has won audience awards at notable film festivals.  The film completely lives up to the hype that has surrounded it.

In the first couple of minutes of the film we learn several things.  First, Jamal, a Muslim who is a product of the slums, is a participant on the Indian version of WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE?  Second, he is suspected of cheating and is subjected to horrific torture at the hands of the police.  Gradually, after having failed to elicit confessions of how he had cheated, Jamal related, while they all watch a video of his television appearance, how he knew the answers of each of the questions.  The result is a series of flashbacks that essentially tell the story of Jamal's life and his relations with the two most important relationships in his life, that of his street smart but sometimes amoral brother Salim, and Latika.  These scenes are set in some of the most horrific squalor that one can imagine.  It may seem unrealistic that someone could come out of such wretched life experiences as relatively unscarred as Jamal appears to be, but that is in part because at heart the film is a fairy tale.  It is not an expose of the abuses of modern economic life.  At heart it is a love story.

I am not a big fan of director Danny Boyle, not having enjoyed at all 28 DAYS or TRAINSPOTTING or his other efforts, but his work here is nothing short of miraculous.  I knew none of the cast, though I've read that several members are well known Bollywood actors.  This film, I have to hasten to add, has nothing in common with a Bollywood film apart from some of the actors.  Though filmed in India, this is every bit a Western film.  There are many marvelous performances, not least Dev Patel as Jamal.  There are a number of child actors who turn in remarkable performances.  And as the grown up Latika, the newcomer Freida Pinto is fascinating to look at with her almost surreal beauty.

As I said, despite the squalid settings for much of the film, this is a fairy tale, a love story.  But even knowing that the film ends as a fairy tale does not prepare one for the particulars.  There were a number of ways that it might have ended and while the ending wasn't completely unexpected, it wasn't entirely predictable.  In the end, this was a thoroughly enjoyable film, equal parts love story and comedy, set against the backdrop of almost inconceivable squalor.  There has been talk of this Indie film perhaps pulling a LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE and receiving some Oscar attention.  We can only hope.",1226966400,28,2806,4.573146292585171
3746430,4,B001P9KR94,"The story is original and the storytelling unique, especially when compared to Hollywood movies. The acting is marvelous from the entire cast, with the children actors overshadowing the adults who play their respective older characters. The movie is very emotional and heartfelt. The only problem with the movie is that the ending is too hopeful, too cheerful, too optimistic.",1226880000,2,376,5.389830508474576

updated 01/14/09

From the perspective of someone who was born in India, grew up there and fled, take it from me, this movie accurately depicts what goes on there and the plight of those whose parents are snatched away by senseless violence.

Inspite of it all, nothing can stamp out the human spirit.

I saw it a day after it opened in NYC and predicted it would sweep the awards.  Not surprisingly, it did, at the Golden Globes. 4 out of 4.

If you want to see the real India, truthfully portrayed, watch this movie.  It makes even Totsi seem pale in comparason.  It is brilliantly put together in a way that will capture your imagination, kidnap it for about 2 hours, have your head reeling on a roller coaster of emotions then release you at the end.

Merficully, when the credits roll, we are cleverly reminded that this was ONLY a movie.... and our heart rates slow down.

Go experience India in a way no other movie director had the courage or imagination to show the world until now!",1226793600,3,1392,4.548387096774194
3746432,5,B001P9KR94,"There has already been some talk coming from Telluride that this film is set to be this year's 'Juno.' It does have the same distributor and it is set for the same release period, and for anyone who hears this buzz, they will definitely not be disappointed.

During the premiere of the final cut (in the words of director Danny Boyle) at the Toronto International Film Festival, the audience gave the film an incredibly enthusiastic response, and it went on to win the People's Choice Award. Boyle, who is sometimes called a British Richard Linklater for yet again surprising the audience with such diverse subject matter, worked his magic. He transcended genres and created a truly unique and energetic picture.

Just about every aspect of this film deserves merit, and above all it belongs to Boyle, who managed to assemble such a massive achievement. The score by A.R. Rahman, with contributions from M.I.A., perfectly accompanies the action on screen. Still, it is great enough to be listened to on its own. With India as a backdrop, Boyle and his cinematographer have composed some remarkable images. The acting is roundly impressive, especially coming from the younger cast, almost all of which has never acted before.

The film begins as Jamal (Skins' Dev Patel) is under interrogation by Mumbai police for cheating on India's version of Who Wants To Be a Millionaire, being only one question away from winning it all. As the inspector says, even doctors and lawyers cannot come close to the 20m rupee prize, and so Jamal, having grown up on the streets of Mumbai, cannot possibly know these things. As Jamal tries to avoid further torture, he begins to explain to the police how he knew each of the answers. Flashbacks present Jamal's boyhood and explain how he got to the show.

At the centre of his journey is his brother, Salim, and a girl, Latika, who is left a homeless orphan after an attack that took Jamal's mother as well. After running from a man who exploits the trio for labour, Jamal replays the incident when Latika left his life when she was unable to catch a moving train. His uncertainty of her fate on the streets of Mumbai and his intense desire to see his first and only love again lead him to the interrogation room where the film began.

Like 'Juno,' Slumdog Millionaire is by genre a comedy, but it becomes much more. The film asks questions about fate, righteousness, greed, and even urban sprawl. Above all, however, it asks about love in the face of the most dire obstacles, and if it can truly prosper. Jamal's story is a tragic and unfortunate one, but as seen through his eyes, it is still beautiful. The vast colour palate of India overwhelm any negative feelings, and Jamal's hope of finding and being with Latika overwhelm despair. For Jamal, 20m rupees isn't his prize. It would be nearly impossible for there to be five better pictures this year.",1226620800,6,2888,4.756487025948104
