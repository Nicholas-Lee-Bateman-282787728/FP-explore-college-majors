7343620,5,B0128GGL9W,"Historically very exciting and accurate from other research I've done. Obviously has a religious/Christian view point, but he was a prominent and important person in the church.",1451779200,,177,5.592592592592593
7343621,5,B0128GGL9W,"This is a wonderful look at the life of St. Nicholas from the time of the Roman Empire to the Emperor Constantine's conversion to Christianity. The history of the ancient cities, and one of the churches that was built for a martyr is now submerged. There is beautiful photography and the research is well done. I would recommend it to anyone interested in the origins of St. Nicholas.",1450742400,4,384,4.661764705882353
7343622,5,B0128GGL9W,A very thorough biography of the real Saint Nicholas (Nicholas of Myra.) It presents the fascinating story of this man and explains why he should be celebrated today. Features great photography. There is a stunning shot showing the ruins of a church which are now underwater. Entertaining and informative.,1449014400,4,305,5.244897959183674
7343623,3,B0128GGL9W,"Not bad but I was expecting an unbiased look at St Nicholas/Santa origin but it was disappointed to realize it was a religious look at the history of a saint, pretending to be unbiased look.  If you are a Catholic, and want a faith based look at this saint I would recommend it.",1448150400,,278,4.245283018867925
8725555,2,B0128GGL9W,"The show had a lot of good information but there were a few one-sided liberal points of view. One glaring omission was around the historical events that lead the relics of Saint Nicholas to be in Venice. The show gave only one interpretation of events. After the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, the Byzantine Empire temporarily lost control over most of Asia Minor to the invading Seljuk Turks.  Because of the many wars and attacks in the region, some Christians were concerned that access to the tomb might become difficult. For both the religious and commercial advantages of a major pilgrimage site, the Italian cities of Venice and Bari vied to get the Nicholas relics. Taking advantage of the confusion, in the spring of 1087, sailors from Bari in Apulia stole the remains of the saint from his burial church in Myra, against the wished of the local monks and took his relics to Bari.  But there is another veryfied historical version of events in which the sailors are not acting like pirates, but they are said to have taken them in response to a vision wherein Saint Nicholas himself appeared and commanded that his relics be moved in order to preserve them from the impending Muslim conquest. Currently at Bari, there are two churches at his shrine, one Roman Catholic and one Orthodox. This was not explained by the host of the documentary, misleading people into viewing the Catholic Church as thieves. Not an accurate historical account.",1514764800,,1447,4.830645161290323
8725556,4,B0128GGL9W,"Very good documentary.  All kids should learn the story of the real Santa (once they get a little older).  I found it very edifying to know he was not only a good man, but a bold man who fought for others and fought for sound doctrinethe trinity for instance, at the Nicene Council.  There are even accounts of him slapping the heretic who denied the Trinity.  He was definitely human, with rough edges, but endearing none the less.

At the very end of the film, the narrator claimed Nicholas would have championed many contemporary issues if he were alive today.  With this I agree, except he mentioned he would have fought against the death penalty.  It was a very strange assertion and inconsistent with everything else reported about him.  St. Nickolas would have indeed fought for the innocentincluding unborn children (not mentioned by the narrator).  But being a biblical man, he would not have opposed the death penalty for murderers, clearly ordained by God in Genesis 9:6.  I think this was just some liberal spin inserted by the documentarians.  And we have at least one legend of him fighting for lower taxes.  You can take that however you want.

Apart form that, a very solid work.  I would recommend to all.",1514073600,2,1222,4.729857819905213
8725557,5,B0128GGL9W,I found it very interesting to hear the details of the life of the real Saint Nick.  Good information for families to share with their children.,1507507200,,144,4.538461538461538
8725558,5,B0128GGL9W,"I'm not a Catholic, but I really appreciate this presentation of the real story of St. Nicholas. The commercial side of Christmas seems bigger every year; this video is a great way to learn about a man of faith, while keeping Christmas centered on Christ.",1507507200,,255,4.688888888888889
8725559,5,B0128GGL9W,Very interesting.  It was neat to see how the real story and the fictional character were at times similar and at other times completely different!,1507507200,,147,4.88
8725560,4,B0128GGL9W,"A good solid presentation of St Nicholas and the historic iconic man that through the ages is NOW has often tranformed into Santa, yet remains, worldwide, as a clear, geniune real man who rightfully gave us the seed for a timeless icon.",1485993600,,236,4.642857142857143
8725561,5,B0128GGL9W,This is a very well structured documentary on Saint Nicholas / Santa Claus.  In fact I think its the only one too.  They could have told more of the fables as filler but they kept it nice and short.,1461628800,,198,4.051282051282051
8725562,2,B0128GGL9W,"Little boring, with little application towards today's Santa",1455580800,,60,6.625
8725563,3,B0128GGL9W,"It's hard to find the details of someone who lived
1700 years ago. They have bits and pieces but
some if not most writings about St. Nicholas date
700 years after he lived.
It seems all we know is based on oral tradition
and the story can change country to country.
St Nicholas when alive is listed with other bishops
but at the same time his name missing from other
lists.
One has no idea when his name was added or
when the lists were written.",1454976000,2,445,4.186046511627907
8725564,5,B0128GGL9W,"Really excellent film!  I have never seen anything that is a better introduction to this extraordinary saint's life.  I strongly recommend it to anyone interested in the man from whom we get ""Santa Claus""!",1454112000,,205,5.0
