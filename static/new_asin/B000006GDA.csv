It is a must have for DVD collectors and I am one of them. I wish there is a way to be informed about when this movie will be released on DVD. It will be sad to let this movie jewel be lost in time since most of the people today own a DVD machine. Please help your customers get this classic in DVD. It is a GREAT MOVIE!!

1193475,5,B000006GDA,"This was one of the best movies I've ever seen. After twenty years I still wanted to see it again, so I bought it. Everyone should see this movie at least once.",1122422400,5,160,4.03125
1193476,5,B000006GDA,"I'm not interested in what the critics say.  This is in my top 3 favorite films of all time.  For any girl who's ever had a broken heart this is the get even, get the man, wreck his life drama that will leave you proud to be a woman.  Set in pre WW11 France, Noelle's father ""sells"" her to (BOSS HOGG of all people)as a means of ensuring her survival.  She is devistated, but discovers her feminine power in the process.  She runs and meets Larry and falls madly in love with him.  He's a pilot and only there temporarily and has to leave, and promises to return in 3 weeks and tells her to buy a wedding dress. Of course, he never returns.  Noelle finds work as a beautiful fashion model, discovers she is pregnant with Larry's child and in an unforgettable bathtub scene terminates the preganacy.  I must have been 5 the first time I saw this movie back when my mom would cover my eyes in the bad parts, and I never forgot the drama of that coathanger scene.  Awful!  She hires private eyes to follow Larry's every move, her modeling leads to acting career and she sleeps her way to the very top all in a measure to control Larry's fate.  As the mistress of a Greek Tycoon ( I can't help but see the correlation between this and Jackie O- perfect timing) Noelle has the resources to destroy Larry's flying career.  In desperation, he accepts a job piloting Noelle's private plane. If any woman ever had ""The Rules"" down, it is Noelle.  She is horrible, hateful, just awful to Larry and suddenly he realizes that he knows who she is and why.  Larry is the classic love em and leave em, and he gets his!  Handsome John Beck plays the part, you will see many sights of Paris, beautiful scenery in Greece, and the marble palace that Demeris, Noelle's lover lives in will take your breath away. Susan Sarandon plays Kathy the woeful wife of Larry, ever dutiful and naive.  They plot to kill her off, Larry backs out despite Noelle's threats to tell her Greek Eye for and Eye Tycoon.  Fate takes over and Kathy is swept out to sea.  In the end they both ""Live in the name of love, and die in the name of love.""  I adore this movie and have watched it probably 100+ times.",1077321600,54,2167,4.306172839506173
1193477,2,B000006GDA,"...The film is 50 minutes too long and it's overproduced and overacted.  It's too bad!  With a better producer and director, Sidney Sheldon's book could have been great.

I saw this at a big palacial theater when it came out and I was amazed after it was over that the time passed so quickly, the movie was that absorbing.  Marie-France Pisier is very good in her role; all the actors were good.  Wish they still made them like this.  One of the great films of the 70's",1024012800,5,380,4.026666666666666
1193481,5,B000006GDA,"The Other Side Of Midnight.......oh, the great tale of Noelle, a little girl from a small french town that screwed her way to the top to become a famous actress, and torments her first love that was a serviceman (a pilot of all things) that got her pregnant and left her.  This film is utter camp -- the scene where Noelle gives herself an abortion with a coat hanger she is straightening out the coat hanger caressing it like it was a substitute vibrator, and the very end, when Noelle goes before the firing squad, the guns blow, and she dies like a graceful forrest gump. the acting was so bad that it was excellent!  I was fortunate to see this movie when it first came out at the Pagoda Palace theatre in San Francisco.  The Drag queens in the balcony were throwing down hankies when Noelle got executed!  I was fortunate to tape this film off of HBO, when HBO gave you a 3 minute intermission because the film was so long.  The plot twists and turns throughout, and is great for its excellence and also for such poorness.  I would equate this film to Mommy Dearest for its campiness, seriousness content, great and bad acting.  A Must have!!!",994204800,16,1148,4.438095238095238

1193575,4,B000006GDA,"Susan Sarandon once said that the producers tried to turn a Sidney Sheldon novel into a Dostoevsky tragedy, and hence badly misfired.  Not a bad assessment of a movie that was intended to bring back the old glamour of 1940s melodrama, although I could not imagine how post-war audiences would have reacted to Marie France Pisier's inventive use of ice cubes.  A movie that would have looked great on the big screen, it's schmaltzy, over the top and a total guilty pleasure.  Revel in the glamour and tragedy of it all.",1451952000,3,518,4.670329670329671

1193590,5,B000006GDA,"""The Other Side Of Midnight""(1977) has plenty going for it as a collectible DVD. First of all the story is a fascinating character study of the extreme lengths a woman is willing to go to get revenge on a man who wronged her. In this case, Noelle Paige (Marie-France Pissier) has a brief but torrid love affair on the eve of World War 2 with American soldier and pilot Larry Douglas(John Beck), who is stationed in Paris. Unknown to Douglas, she ends up even getting pregnant, but he fails to keep his promise to return and marry her. On the very day and date he insisted he would meet her in their favorite Paris restaurant and tie the knot, he stands her up. By this time, he has actually met and married American girl Catherine Alexander (Susan Sarandon).

The rest of the movie details Noelle's efforts to bed her way to the top of France's social ladder, first as a fashion model, an actress and finally as the lover of one of the richest Greek magnates in Europe (Raf Vallone). Her growing power and influence make it extremely difficult for her ex-lover to land a civilian job as a pilot after the war, which was in fact her very intent. She now has the connections and the power to see to it that the only job he can get is working for her, where she finally has him where she wants him. She exacts her revenge at last.

The beautiful French and Greek cinematography, coupled with the stirring musical score by Michel Legrand add the perfect finishing touches on this engrossing epic.

20th Century Fox Home Video should be highly commended for doing this beautiful film justice. The pristine wide-screen color presentation, coupled with the beautifully recorded Michel Legarand musical score, make this film treatment of Sidney Sheldon's popular novel a real keeper.",1444608000,5,1775,4.664536741214057

Based on the novel by Sidney Sheldon, this riveting story of love and revenge boasts dazzling portrayals by Marie-France Pisier, John Beck and Susan Sarandan in one of her career-making roles.

Although American WWII pilot Larry Douglas [John Beck] promises to marry French femme fatale Noelle Page [Marie-France Pisier], he instead returns Stateside and marries well-to-do Catherine Alexander [Susan Sarandon]. And once Noelle takes a Greek multi-millionaire [Raf Vallone] as a lover, she plots to shame Larry by arranging for him to be the tycoon's private pilot. But in one of many delicious twists of fate in this gripping tale of love, war and betrayal, Noelle and Larry again become passionate, and when Catherine refuses to divorce Larry, the cheating couple seek a murderous revenge.

Andrew's DVD Review: Based on Sidney Sheldon's 1974 runaway bestseller, this notorious schlock-fest follows the travails of beautiful and ruthless Noelle Page [Marie-France Pisier]. Europe is on the brink of World War II, and our doe-eyed French ingnue is sent by her father to work in a Marseilles dress shop despite her inexperience. After the lecherous proprietor [Sorrell Booke, better known as Boss Hogg from TV's ""The Dukes of Hazzard""] slides his grubby little hand up Noelle's skirt, she flees home in tears, only to discover that she's been pimped out by dear old dad. ""You have beauty. It's your only weapon of survival,"" Noelle's father advises her. ""Use it. Let the hand under your dress wear gold and you'll be that much ahead of the game."" With writing like that, you know you're in for trashy goodness.

Noelle then heads to Paris and is subsequently courted by handsome Larry Douglas [John Beck], a womanizing American pilot serving in Britain's Royal Air Force. ""This is the boy, there is the girl, how will it all turn out?"" Larry asks rhetorically, unveiling one of the clumsiest come-on lines in recorded history. The couple's lovemaking is followed by an inadvertently hilarious montage in which director Charles Jarrott (who also gave the world the famously crummy 1973 musical version of Lost Horizon) lets the lovers engage in a whirlwind romance replete with caricaturists, shaving-cream fights and, yes, even frolicking in the woods.

The fun abruptly ends when Larry heads back to England, leaving Noelle heartbroken and knocked up. What's a girl to do? Noelle aborts the pregnancy herself with the help of a wire hanger, a trauma that transforms her into a manipulative bitch-goddess who sleeps her way to stardom as a movie actress.

It's all part of Noelle's master plan to exact revenge on Larry, who has long since returned to America and married a ditzy public relations specialist, Catherine Alexander [Susan Sarandon]. From across the Atlantic, Noelle bribes airline execs to ensure that Larry cannot find post-war work as a pilot. She then hooks up with a Greek billionaire [Raf Vallone] and asks moneybags for her very own private plane. Guess who she wants to help her fly the friendly skies.

The Other Side of Midnight has the hallmarks of being a guilty pleasure. And it is up to a point. But at 166 minutes, that's a lot of total guilty pleasure.

DVD Video Quality - The anamorphically enhanced 1.85:1 transfer is generally good in terms of clarity and detail. But there are some disappointments. The major one is the colour which should surely be a lot richer than this. The film seems to have faded into pastel colours with a lot of grey and beige. We also get a rather excessive amount of grain throughout and some minor pixellisation on occasions.

DVD Audio Quality - There are three choices of soundtrack; English mono; English stereo; and French mono. The mono option reflects the original recording and is by far the most satisfactory. The stereo track seems to be recorded a little low and the dialogue is occasionally hard to hear. Legrand's music score is very prominent, which may or may not be a good thing depending on one's personal tolerance level.

DVD Special Features and Extras:

Commentary is actually a discussion in which film historian and DVD producer Laurent Bouzereau conducts separate interviews with Other Side of Midnight author Sidney Sheldon (who died earlier this year), director Charles Jarrott and producer Frank Yablans. All the interviews have their charms, and fascinating hearing all of their comments.

Still Gallery: The DVD also includes a photo gallery that gives different aspects of the film and also behind the scene images.

Theatrical Trailer: The theatrical trailer is presented in its correct format and it's an absolute hoot. A succession of images from the film, which mean virtually nothing out of context, is backed by a hysterically funny voiceover.

Finally, the Other Side of Midnight may have flopped on release but has picked up a cult following over the past thirty years so expectations were high for the DVD release. It was released around the same time as Star Wars and was expected to be a much bigger hit than George Lucas's little movie. Indeed, it lacks the kind of commitment to bad taste which one would expect and is in this respect not unlike Daniel Petrie's film of The Betsy. What should be good, dirty, trashy fun is too often a respectable plod. But there's enough diversion to satisfy fans of melodrama and I can think of many worse films which have a much better reputation. But despite a lot of critics gave it a thumbs down, I love this film and has loved it ever since I originally had it on a PAL [Pan & Scan] LaserDisc and now my hunger has been satisfied, but I really cannot understand why it cannot be released on the Blu-ray format, as then we will have the ultimate image quality, especially the Greek landscape. Despite having this an NTSC DVD, this version will have to do in the meantime and so pleased I have now have this in my DVD Collection. Highly Recommended!

1193691,4,B000006GDA,"I saw this film in 1977, then on television over a decade ago. Though a box-office failure, Andy Warhol liked it. He recognized its melodramatic plot and developments for the enjoyable camp they were.
After seeing it again yesterday, I can reappreciate its appeal, especially the late Marie-France Pisier. Not a classic beauty, she does have beautiful chestnut hair and a very sensual face and figure. As the manipulated then manipulative Noelle Page, she is the film's driving force, and her scene seducing film director Christian Marquand has to be one of the most erotic ever: the lamp-lit interior, the decor, the ice bucket and her perfect figure in action and repose make it so. At the end, she is rather noble when facing a firing squad, knowing that she took from life what she wanted, but finally drew short.
One thing wrong: John Beck's flying for the pre-1941 allies wearing a Canadian uniform. Some Americans did fly for the Canadian Air force between 1939-41, but it was the RCAF (Royal Canadian Air Force), not, as the film says, the RAF.",1351555200,,1052,4.81767955801105

1193699,4,B000006GDA,"There is a great deal of fun to be had with Charles Jarrot's potboiler, ""The Other Side of Midnight"", if you don't take it too seriously, which is, apparently, what critics did when they widely panned the film upon its original release in 1977.  A lavish soap opera with hand-wringing melodrama, cringeworthy dialogue, and a running time of just under three hours, ""The Other Side of Midnight"" works precisely because of a High Hollywood pedigree that has, sadly, gone the way of the dinosaur, as well as its straight-faced camp.  The Latin American telenovelas are currently thriving with this kind of fare, and it's easy to imagine Pedro Almodovar re-making this film in his own signature style; with its twisting turns of passion and revenge, ""The Other Side of Midnight"" is operatic on a grand scale.

The heroine (anti-heroine?) is Noelle Page, an innocent, young French girl from Marseilles whose father sells her to a horny old Parisian with a hairy back (played by Sorrell Booke, who later gained prominence (?) as Boss Hogg on ""The Dukes of Hazzard"").  One roll in the sack later, Noelle runs off and meets up with American Lothario/soldier, Larry Douglas (John Beck), who rapidly impregnates her and then hits the road, with promises that he will return to marry the smitten Noelle when he returns from his assignment.  Meanwhile, in the U.S., the country is preparing to enter WWII, and spunky Catherine Alexander (Susan Sarandon) is making headway as personnel assistant to the head of a top PR firm.  Larry meets Catherine, marries her, and forgets all about the poor little French girl he left behind in Paris.  However, she doesn't forget about him.  Once Noelle discovers what Larry has gone off and done, she is driven to acquire fame and fortune at any cost, which is to say that she spends a good deal of the movie undressed and lolling in the beds of various powerful men.  Once she achieves the pinnacle of material wealth by taking up with billionaire Greek, Raf Vallone, she makes sure that hers and Larry's paths cross again.  Which will not bode well for everyone.

With one double cross after another, ""Midnight"" may be short on logic but it is never dull.  As Noelle Page, raven-haired Marie-France Pisier does a credible job and is exquisitely beautiful, too; it's a shame that she didn't make more movies outside of Europe, because she was a radiant performer who should have become a much bigger star (if she'd wanted to).  Susan Sarandon, for all that I admire and respect her now, sort of reminds me of a boozing Olive Oyl in this film; with her squeaky voice and lanky frame, she's a million miles away from the sexy parts she played in ""Pretty Baby"", ""Bull Durham"", and ""Atlantic City"".  Her Catherine has the worst lines in the film, but, the fact is, she never seems like a fully fleshed out character, anyway.  It's the idea of Catherine, and what she represents, that is supposed to make us, the audience, root for her, but it's ""bad girl"", Noelle, who is the more interesting of the two.  Caught between the two ladies is John Beck, who I never thought was much of an actor, but he has the right stalwart, square-jawed look that is appealing, without any suggestion of real depth--which is perfect for the role of Larry.

The DVD looks great, enhancing the beautifully filmed locations, not to mention the beautiful people doing not-so-beautiful things.  Well worth the cost, ""The Other Side of Midnight"" is a rare treat, a film not often seen anymore.",1309564800,,3491,4.770764119601329

1193704,5,B000006GDA,"They really don' make 'em like they used to...The Other Side Of Midnight belongs to that wonderfully, overtly campy batch of big-budget melodramas made during the mid-late seventies (Airport perhaps the most successful of them all...) - and is in its own way a perfect movie.  Sumptuous locations, costumes, a sweeping score, an insanely entertaining and pulpy story courtest of the one and only schlockmeister, Sidney Sheldon.  And, with only one exception (the wooden and Un-sexy John Beck), the performances bring vitality and life to each preposterous new plot twist.  Marie France Pisier explodes on the screen, in more than one way - she has sensational star appeal, and is matched by an equally fine Susan Sarandon, in an almost comically tragic second-banana role.  The European locations, the yachts, resorts, cafes, high fashion and revenge-driven plot add spice, along with the soft-porn sex scenes, seldom seen any longer in any ""prestige"" films.

A mere few years later when renting it on video, I laughed at how horrible  the dialogue was, how preposterous the storyline is, and how gorgeous Susan Sarandon was at that time. Marie-France Pisier is gorgeous. She's why I rented the video years after seeing it, and she was just as smoking as the first view. And for what it's worth, she's maybe the best in this movie, given the material. But that's not saying much. It's just that she'd most capable of playing tops in a hack movie. This movie is good for laughs, Cinemax late nite type soft porn appeal, and for remembering when Sarandon actually looked beautiful and not necessarily like a tart. But the rest is all ham sandwich. John Beck delivers one of the worst performances in movie history, but again, you have to take the material into consideration. It's like watching a soap from the late 60s, early 70s, and as realistic as a 3 Stooges episode. It might be just as funny as well.",1243123200,,1151,4.507177033492823

1193722,5,B000006GDA,"An absolute must-see.  Noelle has been sold to the concubines(sp) by her parents to help make ends meet, sleeping her way to the top as a high fashion model.  The setting for this motion picture is lovely Paris (very plush budget too for this film).

This drama is extremely addictive & the viewer's attention is easily held by the plot which gradually unfolds.  Noelle falls in love with an american soldier whom soon has to go off to war but promises to return & ends up abandoning her, breaking his promise & Noelle's heart. Meanwhile, she becomes pregnant with his child which adds an interesting twist to the story.

I don't want to give too much away & spoil it, but seeing this film is imperative to lovers of good drama & tearjerker/woman-scorned cinema.  The greatest work of Sidney Sheldon in my opinion.  A brilliant masterpiece of great proportions.  If I could give it ten stars, I would!  Highly recommended!",1215129600,,922,4.7125

This movie leaves all that watch it thinking and talking and shaking their heads in yummy disbelief.  (I dare not give away, too much. Okay, I'll give you a litte..)  This is mostly bacause of the leading lady, Noel Page, who is a tragic, lovable, beautiful, powerful, victim turned ice-woman.  Equally, the other minor characters are well developed with their own interesting interal and external lives.  The movie is a bit slow in the beginning but once you get into it, you're with it for the long haul.  This is great movie to watch with friends who've never seen it because it is so provocative, complex, clever and unpredicatble.  What a plot Sydney Sheldon wove!

1193725,4,B000006GDA,"What a treat to reflect on Susan Sarandon's early film career.  Made 30 years ago, this film is one of the early successes that launched her career. We find young American pilot in Paris during the WWII.  He has enrolled in Canadian airforce to fight against the enemy at the time when US is not involved in a war.  During his stay in Paris, our officer meets Noelle, Parisian beauty who madly falls in love with him not realizing that she is only one of his many flings along the way.  Soon, her lover leaves her alone in Paris with false promise of return. As she learns she is pregnant and realizes that her love is not coming back, she undergoes self-inflicted abortion and sets to establishing herself as a model and actress while tracing every move her former lover makes.  In the meantime, her lover is back in US where he meets young newspaper reporter Catherine (Sarandon) and marries her.  As war is over, he has difficulty finding employment in part due to his inability to adjust to a civilian life.  By this time, Noelle is famous actress in relationship with wealthy Greek businessman.  She plots to get her lover back and in order to have him close to her life, she gets him hired as a private pilot for her own plane.  At that point on, obsession takes over.  Their self destructive desire to be together, opens the door to the worst in them.  People around them do not matter any more.  What matters is that they remain together at any price.  But that desire is the beginning of their own destruction.  Marie-France Pisier in her role of Noelle is famme fatale - beauty beyond words.  After being used by many men, including her own father, she is unstoppable in geting what she really wants.",1195430400,,1710,4.52442996742671
1193726,3,B000006GDA,"If ever there was a movie screaming for a remake, it would be this one.  This 1977 version is so sanitized that it's laughable-especially when it attempts to be edgy.  When my 63 year-old cousin recommended this movie, I was very hesitant, but decided to give it ago anyway.  From the moment Marie-France Pisier shuffles into the frame in her laughable prison guard uniform my eyes  start rolling.  Jeez, look how perfect her hair and make up looks.  There's absolutely nothing believable in this.  Which happens a lot in the older movies.  Everyone is just so camera ready for their close up.  If anything Ms. Pisier does do a remarkable job in showing the character arc of Noelle Page.  Her tansformation from innocent French girl to the worldly Greek billionaire wife is remarkable.  The story could have easily shaved off about forty-fives minutes.  But it seems the director was really getting into his soft pornography in constantly showing us Ms. Pisier's breasts-or rather lack of.  It was nice seeing Susan Sarandon without her hair looking like she stuck her finger in a wall socket.  Both Sydney Sheldon and Danielle Steele became famous writing these sweeping epic novels-and this one with the little surprise at the end was cute.  Though I can't see why either of them would cop a plea when they truely were innocent were beyond me.  But watching people fall for the ole okey doke is always fun.

It played to capacity houses for 6 months upon its first release (4 daily sessions) and when it finished it moved on to a smaller cinema where it continued to enjoy an incredible 12 month run. So much for its critics! I think the reason for its popularity was that it is so reminiscent of the 1940s ""woman's picture"" - drama galore - the stuff of 'soap operas'.

Then it says that one of the two heroines in the film gets killed by her husband.  She doesn't.  If Amazon insists on trying to write witty synopsis's of its films, I would suggest that the staff writer first view the film.

This film is in the tradition of Valley of the Dolls that in spite of misleading 'professional' reviews it is a crowd pleaser.  The material originates from a steamy bestseller, big budget and top notch production - all like Dolls.  You can see the money on the screen from the beautiful locations to the amazing wardrobe and jewels that are all gorgeously photographed.

The film like the book is a juicy soap opera and should be enjoyed as such.  The acting is very good by all especially Marie-France Pisier who throughout the entire film never loses the viewer's understanding of her motives even when at the end of the film she has completely lost herself.

I deny the film five stars because director Charles Jarrott nor his nominal stars, the mannequinlike Marie-France Pisier or John ""The Chin"" Beck(""Rollerball"" and ""The Big Bus"") seem to grasp the satiric implications of the material they were given.  Pisier, though, has a pretty good scene with Christian Marquand(the lousy rubber plantation sequence in ""Apocalypse Now Redux"") that involves body oil and a bucket of ice.

1193738,5,B000006GDA,"The wonderful folks at Fox Home Video have finally answered our prayers and released this colorful 1977 soap opera on DVD. Based on Sidney Sheldon's bestselling novel, TOSOM is the tale of Noelle Page, a poor-but-beautiful French girl who comes to Paris in 1938 to make her fortune. Enter Larry Douglas, a dashing American pilot who finds her, fools her, and forgets her--leaving her pregnant and heartbroken. She loses the baby, swears to get even with the flyboy, and promptly uses her brains and beauty to become the biggest movie star in France and the mistress of the world's richest Greek shipping magnate (sound familiar?). What follows is her life's obsession--a long-range plan of revenge that leads to murder, scandal, and a shocking finale.

This 3-hour drama is as opulent as they come, filmed on gorgeous locations in at least 4 countries, and everyone is dressed to, umm, kill. The beautiful cast includes Marie-France Pisier (COUSIN/COUSINE, CHANEL SOLITAIRE) as Noelle, John Beck (SLEEPER, ROLLERBALL, and TV's FALCON CREST) as the pilot, and a very young Susan Sarandon (we all know her credits) as the pilot's wife, the eventual pawn in Noelle's murderous scheme. Another plus is Michel Legrand's sweeping musical score (with the composer himself on piano). Not to mention the R-rated sex scenes....

By 1977, romantic tearjerkers like this were already out of date, and TOSOM was a big flop at the box office. But its popularity has endured on TV, where new generations have discovered the sheer pleasure of its overwritten, overwrought, overacted, over-the-top dramatics. If you want to see a great film, go watch CITIZEN KANE or RASHOMON or THE TREE OF WOODEN CLOGS. But if you're in the mood for trashy fun, this is it.

Please, please release this film on DVD for the benefit of its many fans. It is long overdue. We've suffered for lo these many years with the monaural, pan-and-scan VHS tape, and that's no way to watch this sumptuously expensive soap opera.

Speaking of expensive--we're aware that this was the big flop you released in the summer of 1977 with many bells and whistles, while your other summer release that year, a little flick called STAR WARS, sneaked quietly into theaters and became a huge hit. We're also aware that a lot of A-List stars (Catherine Deneuve, Burt Reynolds, etc.) and directors (Robert Mulligan, Sidney Lumet, etc.) politely passed on the opportunity to be involved. But is that our fault? Certainly not! Don't take it out on us. We actually went out and saw the movie anyway! We're sorry you took a bath with it, but this is an excellent chance for you to make some of that money back, don't you think?

We, the worldwide OSM Fan Club, patiently await the availability of our favorite trash wallow in a decent, anamorphic widescreen, Dolby 5.1 Stereo DVD version. It is our right as taxpaying citizens and Trash Film Junkies. We would also like the original theatrical trailer, and perhaps a ""Making Of"" documentary, and maybe a running commentary track by Marie-France Pisier and Susan Sarandon--but let's not get piggy. We'll settle for a good print of the film itself.

You've just given us a new, souped-up DVD of VALLEY OF THE DOLLS (Thank you, thank you!), and now we raise our voices in our favorite chant: ""We want our O-S-M!!!"" In the sacred name of Sidney Sheldon, we beseech you to end our suffering. Thank you.

Sincerely,
The OSM Fan Club

PS: Just so you know--there's a pirated, bootlegged DVD version making the rounds, usually priced at about $200.00, and a lot of people are actually shelling out for it. But we won't.

It would be nice if this video was released on to DVD, I feel certain there are several other people of the same opinion as myself.

There are bootleg copies of this movie being sold on DVD on ebay and claiming this movie to be the genuine article and the full uncut version, but after a little further investigation I found that this is an Asian imported DVD which was released on Laser Disc and transferred on to a DVD and packaged up to look like a genuine studio release, the quality is apparently very good according to ebay seller's feedbacks and is also the full uncut version according to the buyer who paid $154.51 on ebay but the cost can  vary, depending on who bids against you.

1193745,5,B000006GDA,"Whenever this picture comes on TV I stop whatever I'm doing and just fall onto the sofa and watch it until its bleak conclusion, then I try to pick up the other side of my mind.

What a great movie and what a shame it's not on DVD with all the extras.  What they should do number one is throw in a copy of the tie-in book that came out at the same time as the movie; it was one of those ""The Making Of"" books that was so popular back in the day.  I remember pages and pages and pages detailing John Beck's reluctance to film nude scenes for the movie, and how the director Charles Jarrott kept wheedling him and flattering him and assuring him that the movie would be nothing without his bare ass filmed in loving, flattering closeups.  Meanwhile in their own trailers Susan Sarandon and Marie-France Pisier were displaying Gallic unconcern about their own nudity clauses.  Beck is appropriately convincing as Larry Douglas, the American airman who cares about only one thing, his own skin, but somehow he has the charm to make two very different women, one good and one evil, fall in love with him.  John Beck is no Larry Olivier, but he's handsome and tall; he gives his lookalike, Michael Beck, a run for his money in the talent department--Michael Beck, the star of XANADU.

The studio evidently spent a huge amount of money on the rights to film Sidney Sheldon's best-seller, but went skimping in other directions, such as stars.

Some Hollywood wise men believe that you don't need stars any more, and that the right vehicle creates stars.

They proved themselves wrong with this movie!  Susan Sarandon walked away from the disaster relatively unscathed, but for Marie France Pisier, it was a one way ticket back to the Dordogne, and for John Beck, it meant an extended stay in the urban soaps of the period--from DALLAS to FLAMINGO ROAD to the best of them all, SANTA BARBARA.  Sarandon's character is called Catherine Douglas, isn't that odd, considering that became Catherine Zeta Jones' name when she married Michael Douglas.  All these thoughts spin through your mind while you're sitting through the epochal OTHER SIDE OF MIDNIGHT trying to make sense of its meldodrama and wartime derring-don't.  It all starts to come together halfway through the movie, and the film picks up momentum and a turn that would be truly tragic had we learned earlier to care about any of the characters.  For veteran screenwriter Herman Raucher, who wrote the novel and movie SUMMER OF 42, THE OTHER SIDE OF MIDNIGHT would have been a plum assignment except, as the MAKING OF book reveals, he was hampered on every side by studio objections to every one of his best ideas.

Raf Vallone, Sorrell Booke, Clu Gulager, Charles Cioffi and Christian Marquand!  Is that the worst back up cast in history or what?",1125446400,18,2798,4.679591836734694

The screenplay and the locales in Paris and other parts of Europe were extraordinary! The Music fit the mood of the movie and the actors were perfect in their roles.
A very young Susan Sarandon was very good as the wife, but Marie France-Pisier stole the movie out from under everyone else! This actress is beautiful and she can act!
There was adultery, sex, nudity, murder, and deceit. Towards the end you had two twisty surprises that will blow away most of the viewers.
I did not guess the second surprise. I did guess the first.
My husband and I watched it together and we both gave it five stars. Recommended highly-in fact I just ordered the book to read. It should be interesting to see the differences between the original novel versus the movie adaption.
Enjoy The Other Side of Midnight. You will not be disappointed. In fact you will watch it again. It was that good.",1515456000,,1012,4.565934065934066
