3891640,4,B002AT4PA0,"This movie is not easy to find. It never made it into the theaters in our region, darn it.

My brother happened to see it in California and said it was worth finding the DVD. Checked ebay (ripoff prices galore) and Amazon, and again, Amazon won hands down.

It's a good B movie action flick. Have watched it twice now and am glad I bought it. It will go into the my collection.",1273104000,16,377,4.1506849315068495
3891641,4,B002AT4PA0,"""Only the Brave"" isn't the best war movie around, nor does it have the shine or polish seen in big-budget, Hollywood movies, but it's very moving, knowing that what happened to the soldiers in the movie is based on historical fact.

""Only the Brave"" is about the efforts of the 442/100 military regiment to rescue a Texas battalion that got stuck behind enemy lines during WWII. In doing so, they lost more soldiers than they ended up rescuing.

What makes this movie quite the rarity in American entertainment is that the soldiers at the center of the movie are Japanese-American. Perhaps with a bigger budget, it could have had more screen time to fully flesh out the main characters (played by Lane Nishikawa, Jason Scott Lee, Tamlyn Tomita, Mark Dacascos, Yuji Okumoto and Greg Watanabe), but it does well enough to pass on this rather underreported part of American/WWII history. While they and their families were in American internment camps, they volunteered to join the American military, to prove that they were just as American as anyone else living in the country.

Some critics have given negative reviews of this movie, but I tend to be more lenient with low-budget films. But this movie does overcome its budget restraints and delivers emotionally powerful scenes, and the film is also interesting and educational. It might be of more immediate interest to Japanese-Americans, but it deserves to be seen by those who don't know the history of Japanese-American soldiers.",1271635200,42,1485,5.004048582995951

3891653,5,B002AT4PA0,"Thank you, Thank you, Thank you Amazon!! I've searched and searched for this movie over the past 8 years or so. At that time and throughout I wasn't able to find it here, but Alas! Here it is.....An historical event for those of us who grew up in Hawaii and have only heard the stories. Seeing it on-screen made those stories all too real. I cannot say that there was any animosity amongst the Hawaiian people towards the Japanese because in actuality, we were ""Ohana"". Those who worked the plantation were just as hurt as our people and those of other ethnic backgrounds. THIS IS A MUST SEE MOVIE! Mahalo Nui Loa Amazon!",1484006400,2,621,4.504424778761062

3891655,4,B002AT4PA0,A very good portayal of yet another historic event that occurred during WW2 that was left out of our American History textbooks.

3891659,4,B002AT4PA0,"Only the Brave is the story of the all volunteer 100/442nd Regimental Combat Team.  This was a company of mostly former Japanese Detention Camp Japanese-American citizens.

This group would go on to become one of most decorated units in WWII.  This unit was instrumental in the rescue of the Texan ""Lost Battalion"".

The sound (voice quality) was occasionally spotty for my ears and no subtitles were offered.  This dropped my grading from five to four stars.  The acting was mostly so-so but the actual story was very strong and good.

This is a great example of one unit putting prejudice behind them to help other American soldiers in harms way.",1443830400,,648,4.836363636363636

3891661,5,B002AT4PA0,"There is so much heart and soul invested in this production.  It is a story that is slipping away from America's conscientiousness and it should not.

3891669,2,B002AT4PA0,I love war movies.  I turned this one off after 30 minutes.  I like the intent behind it (American Japanese enlisting in the U.S. Army and fighting the Nazis) but the acting just wasn't up to par.  I found myself uninterested.,1388880000,,226,4.463414634146342

a sergeant bore a resemblance to Lane.  There are stories not told how the 442 was treated by General Mark Clark and
General Eisenhower by our government.  A lot of the casualties were caused be racial prejudice by those in charge. another

3891684,5,B002AT4PA0,"I'm a war history buff and I have to say it took far too long to tell the story about the 442nd all Japanese battalion of America. It was told in an earlier movie titled ""Go for Broke"" starring Van Johnson and it too was very good for its time. The difference I found between both movies was the battle sequences. ""Go For Broke"" told more of the battles while ""Only The Brave"" dealt mostly with the final battle and the psychological effects of battle on one man. The movie itself was well played out and it deserves a high rating if for no other reason than it told of a real battalion, real men, real battle(s) and the effects of battle. As for the rest of the story it is only an assumption of the writers and is left up to the viewers comments.",1369353600,4,748,4.165517241379311
3891685,5,B002AT4PA0,was looking for this movie for my dad who served in the 442nd.  He has watched all the others and did not know this one existed until I gave it to him.  Highly recommend this movie.,1367798400,,181,4.0

3891687,5,B002AT4PA0,"I caught this film on the Movie Channel a few nights ago.  This is one of the best war movies I have ever seen.  And you would be hard pressed to find very many that I have missed. I rate it 5 stars and maybe a box of kleenex.  I see where some of the reviewers didn't like it because it was low budget. Some of the biggest flops at the box-office in the last 10 years have been ""big budget"" films. True it didn't have massive battle scenes where Nicholas Cage takes out a zillion of the enemy (Wind Talkers), non-stop heroic action (Private Ryan), CGI special effects, etc... but what it did have was the intense, emotional depiction of real combat as seen through the eyes of the Japanese-Americans of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team (Google it) that fought in Africa, Italy and France during WW2. A good story and convincing actors are what really makes a movie. The movie went back and forth between combat situations, where you almost never saw the enemy up close, and flashbacks as the men thought of their loved ones back home, that many of them would never see again. At first I thought that so many flashbacks would break the continuity of the film but it only intensified it. The true story of men who volunteered to serve their country, even after many of them and their families had been placed in internment camps and lost all they owned simply because they were of Japanese descent. Their unit went on to become the most decorated unit in the history of the U.S. Army.  It is a shame that this film didn't make it in the theaters. I would hope to see this film available on blue-ray in the future.",1338768000,4,1612,4.399328859060403
3891688,5,B002AT4PA0,"I like this movie because it is a true story.  However, this movie does not have a Closed Captioned for deaf.",1306886400,3,109,4.190476190476191
3891689,3,B002AT4PA0,"I wish I had read all the harsh criticism of this before getting it (luckily rented). This is supposed to be the true story of the Japanese Americans, who after being interred at the beginning of WW II (after Pearl Harbor) all volunteered to fight for their adopted country. It is a little known part of the story of that war - a bit like all the Germans we interred too.

This then is the story of the 100th/442 Regimental Combat Team, who after fighting through Italy, end up in the French campaign. They are ordered to relieve a surrounded unit of fellow American soldiers against an enemy that out number them 2 to 1. This then should be an action film. Well it is not, it tries to be a couple of times, but fails, there is so much flash back in a futile attempt to engender empathy, that it becomes confusing and has the opposite effect. During the `action' scenes the camera goes all shaky in a, well futile attempt to engender heightened tension.

It is shot in a way to make it look monochrome a bit like the excellent `Band of Brothers', this is suppose to highlight the blood and `gore' when it happens, and yeah it sort of does but it is always so dragged out that any shock is soon replaced by creeping boredom. The acting in places and dialogue was both stilted and lacking in conviction; to call it over sentimental would be a conservative under statement. There are also these ghost sequences that sit awkwardly with the `plot' and do nothing to take the film forward.

They attempt to deal with the racism that these very brave men had to face and it is attempting to be an homage to what became one of the highest decorated battalions of the war. Director Lane Nishikatawa has really not done himself or the memory of these men any favours and it is a shame as it is a real missed opportunity. Like many commentators I feel there is much more here that could have been explored and it may be that too much has been attempted and that is where it falls down. That said it is still an important film for the story it tells and the memory of these very brave men.",1305331200,5,2077,4.334190231362468

3891691,3,B002AT4PA0,"The movie's value is it captures a story that actually happened, that needs to be shared with schoolchildren that might never have known the truth.
