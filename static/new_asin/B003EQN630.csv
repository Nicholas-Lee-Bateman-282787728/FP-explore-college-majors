8395585,5,B003EQN630,This DVD gives a person more than any history books can. It is very informational and gives a perspective of all there is to be thankful for.,1446768000,,141,4.2592592592592595
8395586,5,B003EQN630,Really loved the in-depth telling of this story.,1419724800,,48,5.125
8395587,5,B003EQN630,"If you want the REAL story of the Mayflower Pilgrims - here it is FINALLY! SO well acted and SO well shot I swore I was there! I am VERY fussy about my Mayflower history portrayals - 12 of my ancestors were on that frightening voyage. Six of them signed the Mayflower Compact. The picture of their faith and their spirit and the situations that arose and as they dealt with them is more than moving! The reality is stunning. I have NEVER experienced as accurate and moving a history of this. And it is worth the time to watch it in full. And then watch it again. We are a nation of risk-takers, of people who braved and dared the unfamiliar and the unknown to have a better life. Here were the first and we owe them so much!",1411084800,,724,4.178571428571429
8395588,1,B003EQN630,"A dull and overly long look at the settlers of the New World, ""Instant Expert: The Mayflower"" is criminal in its trivializing of history and ""History"" is guilty of being misleading regarding the contents of the disc. I'm quite certain there are better documentaries that tackle the same subject and do it with greater proficiency, if not, I'd stick with a good book.",1391904000,,366,4.825396825396825
8395589,2,B003EQN630,"Unlike the other entries in the ""Instant Expert"" series, this quick guide to The Mayflower starts out with a lengthy re-enactment and even a title page that gives away its origin as a different film: Desperate Crossing: The Untold Story of the Mayflower. Although when compared to its fellow films (Instant Expert: The Story of Oil, Instant Expert: Ben Franklin) it contains a similar documentary outline of narration, expert interviews and re-enactments, the extensive period piece re-enactments (complete with accents and awkward sentence structure) weigh heavily on this piece, distracting from the historical recounting and the factual presentation of information.

Based mostly on the writings of Pilgrim William Bradford, this story begins in England in 1607 and spans the persecution of religious Separatists in England, their trip to The Netherlands, and ultimately, their travels to the New World (which basically seems to begin as a call to a massive mission trip).

When the documentary reaches the discussion of the original settlement in North America and the Pilgrim's interactions with its native people (including Squanto) it improves significantly, but the re-enactments are still too overdone and melodramatic to properly disseminate historical information. Phrases like ""This is what thou intendest?!"" ultimately kill the non-fictional mood that the History Channel no doubt is hoping to present.

There are Extended Activities and Discussion Questions included in the DVD insert that should help anyone attempting to use this video as a teaching tool.",1316908800,,1571,5.592436974789916
8395590,1,B003EQN630,"BEWARE: History Channel's, ""Quick Guide to the Mayflower"" is EXACTLY the same as History Channel's, ""Desperate Crossing: the Untold story of the Mayflower"".  They just took the later movie, gave it a new name and added a quiz at the end.  For those of you who may be collecting Mayflower data for historical purposes or teaching, there are exactly the same!  It's very deceptive to take one movie and change the cover and name and push it off as a ""new product"".

They movie itself is excellent, don't get me wrong - just want to point out they are both the same thing under a different title.

amazon.com - should review the products they are selling and they would have realized this and warned consumers!  Wish amazon.com would contact me about this.",1281225600,6,753,4.666666666666667
