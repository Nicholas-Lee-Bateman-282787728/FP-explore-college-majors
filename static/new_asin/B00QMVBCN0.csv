However, if you like to think, ""hey I wish I would have made a movie like this and I bet I even could've"", you are going to in a paradise that keeps on giving and taking and lending and returning. Puzzled? Go with it, it's the late eighties when nothing made much sense anyways!

This is about an evil gang of punk rock types who put the impending menace on a bunch of, uh, typical late eighties citizens. I think. That's not all, there are a few other things going on, too, so make sure you pay attention or you might miss 'em. Some are real sinister, others are not.

One fun factual occurence came in the revelation of HOW MUCH some of these people looked like my people, or at least people I knew, and/or attended parties with in the small town I resided in, in roughly the same time period when this was filmed.

Yeah, that's right, one looked like Brainy Jane, one looked like Deke, one looked like Wendy, one looked like Herman, one looked like Kristy, one looked like Boozer, one looked like Sniffy, one looked like Ferd, one looked like Ashley, one looked like Coconut, one looked like Laffy (her nickname, she laughed-a-lot), one looked like Ernie, and last but not least, a girl that looked like that one girl who's name I can't remember.

Wait a minute, were there even that many actors in the cast of this motion picture? Maybe. Maybe not. You know how some people look like more than one people? That explains that!

This film is NOT for the easily upset, or those who ask ""what?"" a lot. You might like it.",1512518400,,1732,4.430817610062893
8692003,5,B00QMVBCN0,"Venus Flytrap is hard to pin down when you're judging just by the cover.  The movie has a House at the Edge of the Park feel, being an uncomfortable horror movie with people dealing with psychos/sociopaths while stuck in a house.  This is shot-on-video from the 1980's, but it's not a gory backyard epic.  VF explores voyeurism, sexuality, tension, and lurid themes with much success.

This isn't for everybody.  Fans of SOV and low budget cinema might be disappointed, if you were expecting a gory epic that's so bad it's good.  I'd argue this is a good movie, well done, with limitations, of course, but a good HORROR movie.

Great special features make this a must own for collectors.",1423180800,3,687,4.722689075630252
8692004,3,B00QMVBCN0,"If you're familiar with Massacre Video's output, then you know what to expect from this shot-on-video obscurity. Plagued with budgetary constraints and a crappy distribution deal, this film was released and then forgotten (or never even heard of) by the majority. It follows a House on the Edge of the Park premise, has male and female nudity, and a Venus Flytrap, but might be better watched with alcohol and friends who appreciate this kind of cinema. This is probably the best the film will ever look and sound, and is film #13 in Massacre's library. Support this little company who loves little movies, so we can continue to see what other surprises they will bring.",1422921600,10,670,4.834782608695652
8692005,1,B00QMVBCN0,"Through no fault of its own, this movie is sooooo 80s!  The neon lights, LPs at a record store, and Pat Benatar-like fashion will have you flashing back.  Prepare to think of Sixteen Candles, Mister Mister, and Ronald Reagan all at once.
This film had a dumb plot, bad actors, ridiculous occurrences, and all other kinds of low-quality features.  The only thing worthy in this movie is the nudity.
This movie was done in video, rather than film.  It looks more like a TV show than a movie.  It says it's 90 minutes, but it's really only 60.
They have an actual venus flytrap in the movie, but it's very small.",1200960000,3,609,4.45045045045045
