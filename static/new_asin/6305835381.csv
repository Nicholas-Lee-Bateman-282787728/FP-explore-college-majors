It has its own pace, story, occasional plot narrations by the main character, and a really small scale plot (no epic battle or unrealistic glory scenes). I liked it for the slow pace, the presentation of actual life, and a little fun thrown in with some modern humor that was actually kinda funny in an ironic way (as it was meant to be).

3712872,1,6305835381,"Avenging the Throne was very poor entertainment!  The trailer suggested five swordsmen are making their way home from a war giving rise to the idea they are probably well skilled in combat- which was semi-accurate.  What followed the opening sequence was a disjointed story line.  The five swordsmen awake on the battle field either from exhaustion or wounds with the five appearing to be the only survivors.  The swordsmen are without horses and talk about having to walk over a hundred miles to return home.  Returning home, as the trailer suggests, is the main story line but the dialog between the five indicate there will be problems encountered along the way.  It is important to note that the leader of the group carries on mental comments about the happenings of their journey.  These mental comments made by the groups leader is sometime confusing to the viewer.  The leader and one other of the five swordsmen wonder off to find horses while the remaining three fall asleep in the forest.  A fight between the landowner and the sleeping threesome results in a standoff.  The next scene takes place inside a castle wherein, the nobleman of that realm appears less then happy to see these visitors.  The leader of the swordsmen sees and immediately falls madly in love with a redheaded girl in the crowd.  He produces a red poppy from his pocket to offer the redhead where upon the castle guards pull out their swords and tell the swordsmen that poppies are not allowed with in the castle walls?  The movie goes down hill at a high rate of speed from this point forward.  A unrequited love scene between the nobleman's wife and the leader followed by a dream state love affair between the leader and the redheaded girl may have given rise to the ""R"" rating of the film, not clear on that though.  The video-graphy is mediocre, the acting is poor, the directing is bad and the script would have been better used for fire starter.

Little did I know, that this night would be so different than all the others. I found a penny heads up behind the couch cushions while digging for a cheese fry and the remote. This was just the beginning of the magic that would ensue. Looking for my typical medieval themed flick to tease at my larping and ladling passions, I came across Avenging The Throne. The title alone filled my loins and bosom with ecstasy. The seemingly no name cast put on a spectacle of performances deserving of every Academy Award. I love the fact they filmed this movie behind our local high school as an after school program for fathers waiting for their children in band to finish marching practice. The instant this movie ended, my ex husband called me and begged me to come back and I would have said yes if I didn't have every man within a one mile radius howling for me while their clueless wives sleep soundly.

3712943,5,6305835381,"I was looking for something historic (more or less), with sword-fighting, grubby reality and not too much special effects or escapist-nonsense in it.  Not looking for magic, dragons or other foolishness.  This movie absolutely fulfilled my need for a little battle and historical sword-play while cooking my dinner.  In fact, it caught my attention and I will be watching it again because there are elements in this film that are that good.

I think that many people come to this sort of movie expecting mind-blowing special effects, magic, romance,  and spruced up extra-clean, extra-shiny actors -- where the characters just ""glow"" with obvious makeup and special effects throughout the most grubby, harrowing adventures of life.  Sort of a Disney in medieval Europe experience. Those are probably the people writing the less-than thrilled reviews.  No goblins, dragons or nyads were used in this low budget film.  Deal with it.

Guess what?  This is a low-budget film. The way you make the best you can with a low budget is not with special-effects --  but with real actors, real acting, and attention to details that do not cost a huge amount but make an impression.  And I was impressed.  I was absolutely won over by the fact that they did NOT spruce up the actors unrealistically --  they existed on that plane of reality with the rest of us, where real people tend to sweat, grow hair, get bruised and bloody and dirty.  Which is a more realistic view of battle, traveling and life pre-20th century.

In particular, someone else mentioned that the clothing etc.  was authentic to the time in history -- 1300's in Malta. It matches what I have seen in art and by reading about that period in European culture.  The actors looked like they were living in their clothing, using their tools and working with their armaments as designed -- everything looked functional and had meaning --  they were not just putting on a costume and pretending.  A number of people complained about the ending battle --  but what I saw was well-choreographed and accurate fighting, accurate wounds and methods.  They didn't have a budget for grand special-effects, but they paid a lot of attention to the gritty reality of the human body and the capabilities of the weapons of that period.

Another point which a number of people complained about was the (spoiler alert!) behavior of one character within five minutes of the end.  I don't see this as supernatural at all (although in the final credits, at least one character is identified as a practitioner of magic, this was probably done to try and attract a larger audience - - of the magical-kingdom-battle-epic-following type).  People today are much too coddled and separated from reality, and so they don't recognize an accurate portrayal of life when they see it.  FACT:  real live people with mental illness or trauma can function normally enough under the right circumstances,  but under the wrong circumstances even the most ""normal"" person could appear ""possessed"" and real live people have done scarier things with their bare hands.  This is a fact of the human condition -- something which our modern audience is out of touch with.

Some of us are not impressed with all that superficial treatment or pussy-footing around the reality of human-nature, and like a little gritty reality, sweat, blood, dust and swordplay in our films.  Sure there are rough edges in this film, but it has good under-pinnings and details to die for.  I, for one, will be watching it again.",1450569600,11,3519,4.901861252115059

Set sometime in the 1300's in some place where there has been a bit of a fight - we meet five lone survivors of the `north skirmish' they never actually say where this is based. They then do some speechifying about how dead people can't hold loved ones ever again and then wander off to some castle. There the hero Tristan de Leon, falls for an enigmatic woman called `Adormidera' and that was the original title of this Maltese film in the UK it was released as 'The Seventh Sword'; which just goes to show that they have to change the name to avoid the bad press of the previous reviews - shameful behaviour for what is a movie that redefines the meaning of 'sucks'.

Back to the 'plot' -the following day they intervene in her release and the other guys come after them. There are some side issues that I got too depressed to care about and basically that is it!

Now this was billed as an `epic' and it is in some circumstances ie `fail' - but to be fair a lot of money was spent on it - but sadly mostly wasted. We have shaky camera action scenes where the camera man seems to have advanced Parkinson's. The script is woeful in places with ropey dialogue and some actors who ought to be arrested for crimes against cinema.

There are issues with over dubbing, lip synch, the sound levels vary and the music is a total mismatch. The sound is all action packed and dripping with emotion, whilst the on screen action is pitifully dull; this is like having the BBC Philharmonic playing whilst Placido Domingo sings an aria to a scene of your dog taking a dump.

There are loads of scenes which go on too long and very little happens. Or the players have to state the bleedin obvious as if we could not spot it we can see the horses have been nicked for instance. Then there are the accents which all vary and sound like they are the victims of a bad elocution teacher. The fight scenes are a bit like watching kids fight with dustbin lids; only with less vim.

Then there is the love interest - if you can call it that - more like screen time waste if you ask me and it has about as much screen chemistry as two rabbits rutting.

In the end credits they thank `The Institute of Healthy Happiness' - well guys you scored a bit of an own goal on this one methinks - unless they have an ironic title. How this has been released with the new daft title I will never know - what is the `Seventh Sword' and what 'throne' needed avenging? The cover art is misleading too as it makes the film look like something actually happens in it. Do yourselves a massive favour and avoid like yellow snow.",1437177600,14,2611,4.296747967479675

I speak as a music lover, this is a testament to having your remote close by.  There is a problem with music for background, as in this film. Lines are mumbled at times, when the LLL overwhelms speech.

 Also present is a high amount of ""battle Sound"", which is fine, it's expected to live large. But when dialogue is present, the LLL should fade accordingly.  This stuff stuck around.  At film's end, it was still THE Last Word.  The LLLM, however all aside, one other troubling aspect of production value, not offensive enough for me to rag this film. I refer to researching the Arms (flags, banners, shield designs) and the garb, (clothes).  It appeared to my eye, which often examines historically correct garb, since I am drawn to this period, squalor to splendid.  This film did not disappoint me in the overall presentation.  Remember, it began as a ""Once Upon A Time"" tale.  The action is either foolhardy or fabulous, depending which angle the camera selects.

 The story was cohesive, the overall atmosphere of authenticity was pretty good, actually.  At some times, AZ reboots became frazzling, along with the above-mentioned, LLL.  Perhaps that's just my LT.  I can deal with that. Scene segues are odd, either blinding or dim as the inside of a clam.  Lots of use of smoke.  Also some brief erotica, blink and you'll miss it, so well done is the photography.

I don't want to kill anyone from watching, so believe me, these tiny nicks aren't anything but a professional eye, since I study the period.
The action here was swaggering, nice choreography on fighting, location was also very interesting.
In all, this is NOT A WASTE OF TIME. Do not want to give that impression.

 If this is an example of a small budget, niche film, it was done quite well.  See for yourself, if you like this genre, and hobbies such as ""Living History"".  Many of the persons seen in this film do have the requisite armor and some decent rags, from practicing and participating in these active groups.  They are featured in some of the credits, and I noted LH was mentioned in the title screen shot.

I liked this film a great deal, so in spite of the tiny flaws I thought I found, I also think I will search for a copy to share with friends. Kept my interest and imagination throughout!",1427068800,,2446,4.641025641025641
