8343623,5,B001UGJURM,Fan of the show? Here are some episodes that will make you ponder a few things....as long as you leave the lights on! I like the series because they use the actual people who experienced these demonic activities. Lets you see the emotional toll the experience took on them. Dramatic but not too Hollywood.,1473465600,2,305,4.666666666666667
