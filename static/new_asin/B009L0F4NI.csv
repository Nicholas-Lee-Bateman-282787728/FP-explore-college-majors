5346072,5,B009L0F4NI,"If you enjoyed the first volume, you will likely enjoy the second as it just continues where the other left off. Again another good 12 episodes on two discs. And once more, the recycled cases which compromises the case and can lead to damaging the paper insert.",1362528000,,261,4.574468085106383
5346073,5,B009L0F4NI,Here is the second set of Pokmon Black and White on DVD; containing the next 12 episodes of the season (Minccino: Neat and Tidy through Emolga The Irresistible). The item arrived promptly around the release date. The set contains great sound and picture quality; and is a must for Pokmon fans and those with younger children to own. I recommend picking one up.,1362528000,,360,4.73015873015873
5346074,5,B009L0F4NI,"Yes, this is the second 12 episode set containing episodes 13-24. They are:

13: Mincinno - Neat and Tidy
14: A Night in the Nacrene City Museum
15: The Battle According to Lenora
16: Rematch at the Nacrene Gym
17: Scraggy - Hatched to be Wild
18: Sewaddle and Burgh in Pinwheel Forest
19: A Connoisseur's Revenge
20: Dancing with the Ducklett Trio
21: The Lost World of Gothitelle
22: A Venipede Stampede
23: Battling for the Love of Bug Types
24: Emolga the Irresistible

This second set has many new Pokemon being caught (not all by Ash) and evolved, along with Ash getting 2 new Gym badges. You also get to see different strategies used in various battles, like self sacrificing.

The set itself is similar to the first set in that it contains 12 episodes, has no extras, and is nicely done in widescreen. It's also nice to see different Pokemon being done on the discs themselves (Oshawott and Snivy are on the first set and Tepig and Pansage are on the discs in this set). Overall, a very good set with a VERY good price.",1360108800,5,1027,4.452127659574468
5346075,5,B009L0F4NI,Really it's worth it. The only downside that happened was when it was over. It ends and you have to have the next one. That's what i'm going to do and I suggest everyone to purchase this and and volume one... And volume three DO NOT purchase this before the first one. It will have spoilers. Overall 5/5,1359244800,,303,4.241379310344827
5346076,5,B009L0F4NI,"This Series Sounds Good Too Bad I missed it when it was on TV but thats why we have DVD's of it, and why do they never release Pokemon seasons in the UK but oh well still looking forward to it a lot.",1354838400,2,199,3.6511627906976742

5346078,1,B009L0F4NI,"Not only was this pricey, but the adventures were a joke.  As much as I love the series I don't understand how the anime continues.  If you are determined be patient and what and see if a box set arrives so you can at least save a little money.",1402790400,,244,3.9591836734693877
5346079,5,B009L0F4NI,"It's a shame we are still the rest of this season and now A WHOLE other season behind from what is currently being aired here in America. Whenever we get the next volume(s), they need to still do ""Adventures in Unova"" then ""Adventures in Unova and Beyond,"" which are still one whole season, then after that, we have the current season, ""XY"".

Great series though and you will enjoy this volume! The ""Black and White"" series is really good!",1401321600,,439,4.556962025316456
5346080,4,B009L0F4NI,"Looked at 6 different stores to find this DVD for my son, goes with his collection.
Witht eh stores that just provide DVD's and music starting to fade out and the BIG stores liek Walmart and Target coming in,, you find less and less of a new product as it comes out- especially in these types of series. I can always find it on Amazon.
Pricing is always very comparable if not less then in the stores.",1399248000,,401,4.220779220779221

5346084,4,B009L0F4NI,"I got this for my son b/c he ""had"" to have it.  He has played the game several times, but he much prefers the DS Pokemon game.  I hope it gets more use b/c these games aren't cheap!",1369008000,,181,3.736842105263158
5346085,5,B009L0F4NI,My kids love anything with Pokeman.  They have watched this movie over and over. The Black & White series is a new favorite.  Arrived when expected.,1366848000,,148,4.653846153846154
5346086,3,B009L0F4NI,"Like the previous set, Pokemon Black and White set 2 contains 12 episodes. The DVD set is collected in a nice neat case once again. Its the perfect item for Pokemon collectors, although the Unova episodes seem to target a younger audience. Many experienced Pokemon fans will probally hope for more than what is on this set. The episode plots may seem familiar because some of them were used in other Pokemon seasons.
  However, this set does please many Pokemon fans. Unlike the previous set of episodes, this set contains 2 gym battles. The first disc has Ash facing Lenora who uses normal Pokemon; the second disc contains the battle with Burgh. While Ash is busy meeting new Pokemon and battling tough openents, Team Rocket is still involved in mysterious undercover missions. What can they be up to, and why have they targeted the strange meatorinite held inside the museum?
  Overall, these episodes target a younger generation of Pokemon fan. Older Pokemon fans will be left wanting more, however I enjoyed them and wish to complete this collection. There should be 2 more sets in this season. They don't take up as much space as the Diamond and Pearl boxsets thanks to there average DVD case style. If you purchased the other Pokemon Black and White set you already know what your getting. These DVDs contain about 4 hours of Pokemon action! (about 2 hours on each disc)",1362787200,,1377,4.773109243697479
