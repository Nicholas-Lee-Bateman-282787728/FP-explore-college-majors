7913345,5,B00000JS7U,"I have the VHS 4 tape set of Christianity - First Thousand Years and it is a very good source for studying the History of Christianity.  It is a wonderful 4 tape set worth the viewing!  I would advise all Christians to watch it and be more informed of what happened in the past and how Christianity is still flourishing all around the world.  If you do not know Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior, I advise you to get to know Him.  His is more than a good prophet and teacher.  He is the Savior of the world for all who will put their faith and trust in Him.",1236038400,,569,4.044642857142857

The History of Christianity does not occur in a linear fashion.  It breaks off into desparate wings and webs.  This first boxed set, though, welcomes newcomers who know very little or nothing about the faith begun by Jesus Christ.",1134864000,8,421,5.253731343283582

Thus, some reviews will only refer to the first thousand years (those who have reviewed the VHS set), and other reviews will cover the entire history of Christianity (those who have reviewed the DVD set).  My review will cover both, with an emphasis on the first thousand years, but also addressing briefly the second thousand years.

The series 'Christianity: The First Thousand Years', narrated by Ozzie Davis and Ruby Dee, was originally entitled 'The Rise of Christianity'.  From the outset, the narrator states the purpose of this series as not being a look at the Bible or theological and spiritual ideas, but rather a history of the church, of Christendom and the whole institution of Christianity.  Because this was done in four, fifty-minute episodes (roughly 250 years per segment), the history has had to be more selective than history ordinarily is.  The documentary navigates a good and interesting course between major figures, events and ideas and interesting trivia and elements of the Christian experience.

Given the audio-visual nature of the documentary, there are lots of pictures of artwork, architecture, archaeological/historical sites, and re-creations of events; there is also a good deal of music as a background - in the first thousand years, the primary music of the church was plainsong and chant, so that is most frequently used here (besides the orchestrated theme and background music that turns up regularly).

One of the limitations of the audio-visual medium of documentaries is that deep theological issues cannot be examined in detail - one hopes that one of the benefits of a series like this is to spur interest in reading the actual works of the people being discussed.  For example, a few excerpts from Augustine's 'Confessions' are used in that segment, but there is so much to Augustine that it is impossible even in a full documentary focussing exclusively on him to give more than a passing acquaintance with his work to the viewers.  This is true for all major theological thinkers, from any era.

Another area of interest is in the historical development of Europe overall, during the first thousand years, and the spread of the church as the Europeans spread throughout the world, during the second thousand years.  Again, the purpose of the documentary being to explore the history of the church, one should not expect a full historical development even of the areas directly touched upon - still, this documentary does a good job at setting the overall context in political, social, military, economic and intellectual terms.

This is a history produced in broad strokes - the overall aspects and trends of Christian history come through in good form, even if the details are not as fully developed as an historian might care to have.  We have used these videos in church history classes at my seminary as a supplement to the primary texts and history surveys that students read - this really does help bring history to life.

The scholars represented on this video come from a very diverse background - the Roman Catholic and Orthodox members of the scholar team on this documentary may be surprised to find themselves classified and dismissed as 'Jesus Seminar types' (particularly people like Eastern Orthodox Archbishop Kalistos Ware); interestingly, this is not a documentary about the Bible, either what it says or how it was made - in this regard, that might be one of the gaps of this particular documentary series (how the Bible was made gets relatively little space in this video).  On the other hand, A&E have another series, 'Who Wrote the Bible', which involves scholars, theologians and religious leaders who were involved in the production (and again, a diverse bunch - Jerry Falwell would not qualify as a 'Jesus Seminar' type either).

This is a very good video series for the novice, the general interest seeker, and for students and pastors who want an introduction or refresher into the overall scope of church history.",1129334400,66,4213,5.030172413793103
7913348,2,B00000JS7U,"After sitting through 4 hours of this narrative of Christianity, I felt that much of this story was distorted. Christianity was presented as some tyrannical force bent on destroying its enemies throughout history. While I don't discount the many factual accounts of brutality presented, I also fail to see balance in the presentation. Where does it show the positive values of Christianity in sustaining people's lives during plagues, wars, etc? Where does it present the millions of good works performed by Christians throughout history? These films are all blood and gore and violence and death. This is only one side of the Christian story. Is Mother Theresa even mentioned? No. Also I would like to know who was behind the production of this show. How can I discern the biasses of the individuals who produced it? Who are they? And what was their motive for the show? It certainly does not present Christianity in a positive light at all. One might even call it anti-Christian. If anyone knows who selected the facts and organized this narration, I would appreciate hearing from him/her.  Len Bazelak, Sarasota, Fl",977788800,27,1118,5.010752688172043
