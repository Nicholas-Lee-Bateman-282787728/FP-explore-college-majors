The video is about the people of Victoria TX and surrounding communities hosting several busloads of veterans for a weekend of being appreciated for their sacrifice. The amount of work that is done is amazing and displays the attitude and ingenuity that made our country so great.  It is truly mind-boggling.

Most of us have family members that have served our country in the military and the video also shows how we can still honor them for their service. I honor four of my family members and plan to watch this video each year since it is not possible to attend in person.",1383609600,2,663,4.554621848739496
