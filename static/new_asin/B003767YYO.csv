4080250,1,B003767YYO,"As an instructor who always searches for scientific, accurate, and up-to-date documentaries on many ancient cultures/societies across the globe to show to and educate my college students, the statement by the various interviewed anthropology specialists was extremely helpful and saved me from purchasing what would seem to have been a waste of both time and money (which I have already experienced in purchasing/viewing other documentaries in the past to recent times).  It is quite disappointing to hear about what could have been a top-notch documentary with great specialists, that could have aided in educating students (and others), and to see how a hidden agenda and pseudo-scientific film-making approach have created what is in essence an expensive paper weight.  Perhaps the film-makers can take their exisiting footage and re-do this documentary since it would seem they have sufficient materials to create what could be a good product.  I should add that while it is perfectly fine for a documentary to provide a broad range of different theories, including what the other reviewers have praised, it is exceedingly objectionable to mislead and distort the interviewed specialists' views in the documentary.

In general, I have found the few reliable documentary makers are definitely the BBC and NOVA/PBS, and to a slightly lesser extent National Geographic, Discovery channel, A&E, Kultur/Koch Vision (including Cromwell), Athena, Ambrose, TimeLife, and the History Channel.  A few other documentary film-makers are also fairly good.  In general, most non-specialist narrators introduce at least some errors or misleading statements, even in fact-checked productions by the best documentary film-makers, while the greater number of specialist interviews in a documentary help make a quality program.",1348963200,5,1812,5.643382352941177

I am LDS and am always enjoy evidences for The Book of Mormon, but, it is a stretch to say that the Hopewell fit the bill. Some of the information presented in this film has got the scholars who appear in the video, a bit nervous and are taking a stand against it. Here is a statement they have made:

[...]

January 4th, 2011
The following is a statement jointly authored by myself and the several other scholars indicated regarding our participation in the recent video production, ""The Lost Civilizations of North America."" Given the notoriety this video has received (it was discussed by Glenn Beck on his television program), we felt it necessary to make the following statement a matter of record. I urge anyone who has any questions not answered by the statement to contact me.

As scholars committed to increasing public understanding of Native American history and archaeology, we want to make it clear that we do not support the theories presented in ""The Lost Civilizations of North America"" DVD. In our opinion, there is no compelling archaeological or genetic evidence for a migration from the Middle East to North America a few thousand years ago, nor is there any credible scientific evidence that Old World civilizations were involved in developing Native American cultures in pre-Columbian times. Many of the artifacts used to support the film's claims, such as the Newark ""Holy Stones,"" have been proven fraudulent based on convincing scientific evidence and historical documentation. Like the great majority of professional archaeologists and anthropologists, we have seen overwhelming evidence that Native Americans were independently responsible for designing and creating the Newark Earthworks, Cahokia Mounds, and the myriad other pre-Columbian sites across the United States.

Each of us was interviewed for this film. None of us was asked directly for our opinion on what turned out to be its underlying claim; that Old World civilizations played an active role in the development of Native American cultures, especially the mound builders. Instead, we were asked general questions about Native American societies, their remarkable technological achievements, genetic histories, and we were also asked to comment on the biases of many nineteenth-century historians and archaeologists concerning the abilities of the native people of North America. We fear that the context of our general remarks as they currently appear in the film might lead viewers to conclude that our words on these subjects provide support for the film's claims. That would be a mistake. In fact, our remarks, if presented in an unedited form, show clearly that we reject the assertions made in the finished documentary concerning a non-native source for the complex
cultures of Native America.
We informed the filmmakers of our objections in February 2010, five months before the DVD's release. The producers did make some changes in response to our objections, including deleting Ken Feder's interview entirely. As a group, we believe that the final product remains misleading and presents claims that neither we nor our data support. In our opinion, there is no compelling evidence for the presence of Old World cultures in North America prior to the incursions of the Norse in the early 11th century.

8390326,2,B003767YYO,"A good documentary but obviously biased. I could tell right away by watching it that it is Mormon based Pseudo-archeology. Not that I'm against that. I bought the dvd to familiarize myself with the mound builders and the artifacts in question to do additional research. If Mormonism is provable I have nothing against that. However there are alternative theories if one investigates further. These theories vary so widely and are open to so much conjecture that of course mainstream archeology largely dismisses them. Science is interested in proof not speculation. I invite those interested in this dvd to look up the term ""confirmation bias."" I also encourage viewers to consider the views of Graham Hancock, watch you tube videos on the Nephilim, and read a book called ""View of Hebrews"" by Ethan Smith. Investigate all possible alternative explanations before allowing ""evidence"" to confirm religious beliefs. Investigate the historical setting of Joseph Smith and the Second great Awakening. Understand that in the early 1820's many anthropologists were trying to fit what they were discovering into a historical view of Genesis as it was widely accepted that the bible was history. The bat creek stone looks Phoenician. The Jews use the same evidence to confirm a different view of the same artifacts from the Mormons.",1493164800,2,1324,5.220657276995305
8390327,5,B003767YYO,"i really enjoyed this film. It explores, in great depth, some of the lost, and advanced civilizations of North America. We need more films like this to preserve our great American history that is in danger of being lost and covered up. It is so sad that most mainstream historians disregard the unshakable evidence revealed in this film. I don't usually agree with anything that Glen Beck supports on his controversial TV show, but he is a very intelligent guy who supports the ideas presented in this film. He, as anyone with even a modest intellectual capacity can clearly see the truth that ancient civilizations of vast reach have existed in North America for millennia.",1491177600,2,674,4.869565217391305

8390330,1,B003767YYO,"I have been studying ancient civilizations of the Americas as well as around the world for thirty odd years now, so I was already very familiar with much of the information contained in this program.  I suppose one could call me an educated novice.

I am also familiar with the idea and practice of succeeding civilizations skewing the history towards their particular agendas, re-writing, and at times, erasing historical fact.  Although I don't personally agree with that practice (and I believe most folks don't either), I see that it is commonplace for all people throughout recorded history and around the world to do so, especially when the people involved have a `dog in the fight'.

I was really looking forward to this video, however ten minutes into it I began to get this funky feeling;  I felt that there was an unstated agenda here and that I was being preached to.  Something about the way it was being edited; sound - bytes  feeling out of context, and leading the viewer to an already established conclusion of a particular ilk.

I wondered if some of the the participants even knew of the producers affiliations and agendas - as one of the other reviewers indicated,  some of the experts felt duped after the fact and wanted to remove their names from this project.

For me it quickly began to have the flavor of a  `Party program'; information posing as educational but coated with poison.  There were suggestions of feminist oppression scenarios, genocide, and white privilege.  Then, one of the experts finally said the word... reluctantly...""RACISM!"". At that point it was clear that the left (so to speak) was at work here.

All of  the  corrosive and divisive  air of `multiculturalism', 'diversity', 'political correctness', and 'social justice' was stinking up the place, and I could no longer  trust nor be interested in the information that was being presented.  Here I was trying to understand  more about the history of my human brothers and sisters, only to be swept up in and subjected to an ideological, re-education camp program.

Those interested in ancient American civilizations would be better served watching programs like ""Ancient America Mound Builders - Edgar Cayce's Forgotten Legacy"", and ""Searching for the Great Hopewell Road"".

At this point I'm leaning toward throwing this video in the garbage can...so disappointing.",1424649600,6,2365,5.041237113402062

8390334,1,B003767YYO,"Anyone who thinks this video represents anything other than racist, fictional, and thoroughly discredited notions of the authentic history of Native Americans needs to review actual scholarly studies of the archaeology, history, and genetics of first inhabitants of this hemisphere. There are absolutely no mainstream archaeologists, anthropologists, or molecular geneticists who will endorse the claims contained within it. Before purchasing, I recommend the reader Google Ohio Archaeologist Brad Lepper's blog entries on the subject as well as links to the articles in the ""Skeptical Inquirer."" Several reputable scientists, Lepper and Deborah Bolnick among them, are absolutely livid at the edited misrepresentations of their sound bites implying they endorse any notion of pre-Columbian contact between the Old and New Worlds other than what is known about the Vikings at L'anse aux Meadows. A number of well-known 19th Century frauds, the Bat Creek Stone, the Newark Holy Stones, and the Kensington Rune Stone are offered as ""proof"" of these ancient seafarers when all have been repeatedly debunked and exposed.

That Native Americans built complex and enduring cultures is well known; the truth is they did it without European influence, however, and they managed to spread from the Arctic to the tip of South America in doing so. Molecular genetics is showing they are all closely related and descended from a small population that originated in Siberia around 20,000 years ago (with a number of smaller later migrations in Alaska and Northern Canada). That spread of humanity is far more remarkable than any mythical claims of trans-oceanic voyages, and those who believe in such nonsense need lessons in geography and maritime technology .

Finally, this video is also a ""crime against history"" with claims a ""Smithsonian Conspiracy"" was engineered by no less than John Wesley Powell and Lewis Henry Morgan, a pioneer anthropologist who mentored the Civil War Hero--who also led the first expedition down the Grand Canyon--when he became the Smithsonian's first head of the bureau of ethnology. Such fabrications are wholly unwarranted and unsupported by the facts.",1409702400,5,2174,5.467261904761905
