7844220,5,6303359922,"The information on the Iroquois, particularly the Seneca is good information. The sources were authorities on what they spoke of. One of the main reasons I bought this video was to hear what John Mohawk had to say. He passed away this last year. His education, both in and out of school was a benefit to the Seneca. John held a lot of knowledge, and he was always eager to share what he knew. He helped bridge the gap, for two generations, between what was and what is. He will be missed. Nya-weh, John.",1197331200,3,503,4.361702127659575
7844221,4,6303359922,"This is a very helpful introduction into the world of the thinking of Native Americans and Native American spirituality.  I've used it in teaching the subject of world religions to both college and graduate level groups of students.  It is admittedly biased to the Native American perspective, and rather negative toward the church and white culture in general in its presentation, but it is a side to the history that we need to hear and confront. It is very professionally done and will spark some good discussion.",1175040000,,516,4.919540229885057
