8676282,4,B00N4X8MTQ,"As a disclaimer, I am a longtime fan of Sister Hazel.  The DVD seems stuck between a documentary and a live concert, some of which were not acoustically at their best.  For fans, this will be enjoyable.  A Blue-Ray version of these guys at a good concert, though, would be awesome.  They are a great band and I think anyone interested should spend a few bucks for this DVD.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed for a production that matches their live performances.
If Sister Hazel performs near you and you spent time reading this review, go to the concert.  You'll enjoy it.",1426636800,,571,4.549019607843137
8676283,2,B00N4X8MTQ,"As someone who has been a fan for about 18 of these 20 years (and an original Hazelnut) I am a bit disappointed here. I must admit, its been 3 years since i've been to a show, but Ken overdoes nearly every single vocal here. Too much yelling, dragging words out and twisting his vocals on every single word. He doesn't need all of those ""gimmicks"" added into his voice. At least, I hope not.

I wanted so much to like this and through each song I was excited, and each song let down. Funny enough is that ""All For You"" is probably the most understated, simple songs here and it sounds great. I guess after 15 years of overdoing that song they have come back to singing it more ""normal"".

Also, I would have liked it much better if the 20 years would have included recordings from over the past 20 years. This would be harder for the video portion (not as many shows were on camera early on) but I know there are great audio recordings even from those first few years (oh please release the Red Rocks '97 show!). A compilation of their early tv appearances would have been neat as well, although some of that was covered in Live Live.

All in all, I simply don't enjoy it. The new songs are nice to have but there are much better versions out there of everything else.",1413417600,,1267,4.270833333333333
8676284,5,B00N4X8MTQ,"I totally agree with the person who said if you are not a Hazelnut, you will be by the end of the DVD. Any band who is still together after 20 years has accomplished a lot. This is a well-produced documentary and I would recommend it to anyone who loves live music. Sister Hazel shows never disappoint, and this DVD captures the fun and energy of the shows. It also includes interviews and some fun old bonus footage at the end!",1412640000,,428,4.296296296296297
8676285,5,B00N4X8MTQ,"20 Stages, a wonderful, joyful DVD.  If you are not already a ""Hazelnut"", you will be by the end of the DVD!",1412640000,,108,3.909090909090909
8676286,5,B00N4X8MTQ,"I'm cheating a bit here, as I received this release in the mail direct from the band today (Monday, Oct. 6, 2014), but I still highly recommend even the casual fan to invest in this labor of love. Aside from great renditions, slight twists on old classics (""Change Your Mind"", ""Champagne High"", ""All For You""), there's also a collection of new material that has yet to be released on a studio album.

Hazelnuts have been making themselves comfortable the last few years with some fantastic songs that continue in the spirit of this one-of-a-kind band, particularly ""Roll on Bye"" and ""Karaoke Song."" The latter tune is simply infectious, one that you feel comfortable rolling down the window of the car and blaring for the whole neighborhood to hear. Go ahead, ""take a sip of courage"" and belt out the lyrics at the top of your lungs and raise your hands to the heavens for Tattoo Dave while you're at it.

Count on some variations on songs that you think you know, but can be reacquainted with as the group infuses new life into tracks with banjos, mandolins, keyboards and sax. If all that were not enough, grab your significant other and take a slow turn while Drew Copeland paces the Wilmington Symphony (NC) through a beautiful rendition of ""This Kind of Love.""

The band; Ken Block, Drew Copeland, Jett Beres, Ryan Newell, Mark Trojanowski and newcomer Dave LaGrande take you on a tour of 20 venues for 20 unique songs that have come to define (so far) a group that shows no signs of slowing down. Lush harmonies, huge hooks and a dash of humor root themselves through two CDs worth of top-notch musicianship from players who are even better human beings when you get to know them.

I may be biased, but there's no way this archival release should have been limited to only 20 songs, but that's wishful thinking from someone who has seen the band 48 times in 13 states and the District of Columbia since 2005.

Find out for yourself what's been going on with this band of brothers from Gainesville, FL -- but save me a CD, Amazon, because I am buying a few more copies to share with friends who need to be enlightened.",1412553600,7,2123,4.576315789473684
