7739447,1,B01ERHK1E6,"If I could give this movie zero stars I would - it sucks that hard. The acting is truly painful ...Plus, it's a pathetic, thinly veiled attack against animal welfare groups who oppose the cruel puppy mill industry: it was financially backed by Forrest Lucas of Protect the Harvest, a completely disgusting anti-animal organization. If anyone still thinks puppy mills aren't a problem, I challenge them to Google it, and see how many investigation photos they can stand to look at....",1467849600,8,483,4.9753086419753085
7739448,1,B01ERHK1E6,"This movie represents the problem with puppy mills... They are backed by big money organizations hiding behind calling themselves animal welfare organizations such as AKC.  Anyone in their right mind would know that breeding 100 dogs constantly in cramped, dirty cages with little to no decent shelter, food, water or medical care is a horrible existence for these mom and dad dogs.  These places are purely in the business of profit. They do not see dogs as living beings with hearts that love so deeply.  Never buy from a  pet store.  Never buy from an online breeder, Never buy from an Amish farmer.  Anyone breeding more than one breed of dog is not in it for the better of the breed.  They are in it for profit only.  A Responsible Breeder checks you out more than you check them out.  They never sell their dogs to just anyone.  They want their puppies to have wonderful loving, caring homes.  Making people who are trying to stop this inhumane treatment of Man's Best Friend is extremely sad.  Don't fall of the puppy mill hype.  Adopt and save a life or investigate a responsible breeder, meet the puppy's mom and dad and see their living conditions.  Make an intelligent decision.  Oh, and don't see this terrible movie.",1467849600,9,1229,4.677570093457944

7739450,1,B01ERHK1E6,"Don't expect an unbiased film about dog lovers here. One of the two executive producers is Indiana multimillionaire Forrest Lucas, founder of Protect the Harvest, an organization that targets animal welfare groups and opposes laws designed to protect animals from cruelty. This film is self-funded propaganda to further the agenda of those who support industries that are harmful to animals. These industries would like the public to believe that animal cruelty is a myth. But make no mistake, dogs suffer and die in puppy mills for human greed. These cases have been well documented by the mainstream media and in court.",1467849600,8,621,5.158415841584159

 This movie is a close second to Ishtar. If you don't know what that is look it up

7739454,1,B01ERHK1E6,"Even by this films own admission there are unscrupulous breeders in business. Since the organizations that should be monitoring this industry for humane & ethical standards before certifying dogs & the facilities they are bred in are doing such a poor job, it is painfully obvious that animal welfare organizations are desperately needed to ensure dogs are maintained & sold to the public in the highest standards. The breeder, featured in this film as a target of false accusations, places blame for substandard practices of veterinary attention on someone else within the community who stole his dogs for backyard breeding. Maybe that is the truth or maybe he is actually the guilty one. Either way, until there are better laws & practices regulating this industry it is very hard to know for sure if a breeding facility is really caring for the dogs or if they are only concerned with their profits (which veterinary care & well maintained facilities eat into). Regardless the people who funded this film, Protect The Harvest, have their own agenda for making this film & I strongly encourage you to research this company before buying into what they are trying to sell you with this film.",1483142400,2,1192,4.935323383084577

The large national animal welfare organization (HSUS in real life) loses, the dog breeder loses, the dog lover loses and most importantly, the dogs lose. I have no issue with what I consider responsible breeders of dogs. I do take issue with Protect the Harvest using this film to promote its agenda against the HSUS and while distorting facts. Don't waste your time on this one or you'll just end up confused about what a puppy mill really is and about the genuine and very serious issues in our country related to the commercial dog breeding industry.",1471478400,,680,4.536585365853658

7739482,1,B01ERHK1E6,"This movie was completely and utterly despicable. I wish I'd read the reviews before I watched it. I thought I was getting a film about a woman going undercover to expose the disgusting cruelty and neglect that occurs in puppy mills. Instead I get a propaganda movie promoting the idea that puppy mills are run by benevolent caring families and AGAINST animal welfare agencies. Well, I can tell you from first hand experiences that this is NOT the case. I have worked in my local shelter and seen the horrific shape these dogs are in when they come from a puppy mill. I have rescued a dog from a puppy mill, a dog who was 3-4 years old when I took her in and who had spent her years in a small wire cage having litter after litter. A dog who was severely underweight and so malnourished and full of fleas that what should have been a thick Pomeranian coat was simply a few sparse hairs left on her haunches. A dog who had never set foot on GRASS. Finally, with lots of nutritional food, a private behavioral trainer and lots of TLC and patience, I have been able to work through her issues. But she will always suffer from PTSD like episodes from the horrific years she spent in the hell of a puppy mill. The very idea that this film could cause people to re-think donating to animal rescue causes makes me sick at heart. Please don't believe this garbage. Puppy mills are a cruel, inhumane national disgrace. SHAME to the actors who participated in this sham.",1471046400,3,1460,4.431226765799257
7739483,5,B01ERHK1E6,"Excellent movie to educate the public that a growing number of these animal raids are not as one is led to believe by the media and these animal rights groups.  One should take the reports with a grain of salt and remember that the accused is innocent until proven guilty by the court...and sometimes not guilty even then.  No matter how much we love animals, we must avoid that knee jerk reaction to only an accusation.  Do your homework and check these groups out before writing a check.  You may be surprised how lucrative the practice of stealing animals by accusation has become.  Thank you, Protect the Harvest for getting involved.",1471046400,,638,4.711711711711712

7739494,5,B01ERHK1E6,"This movie will NOT ""make you pro-breeder.""  but since no research is complete without looking at BOTH sides, I encourage you to watch it.  There is much propaganda out there regarding Animal welfare and animal rights.  Yes this movie was produced by the other side  (agricultural interests), but it is such a rare glimpse of the other side of animal rights groups and lobbying for profit, that it is worth watching.  For those who panned it as ""pro-puppy mill"" they must have not watched it, or don't understand what a puppy mill/Backyard breeder is.  This movie is about a family that has raised dogs for a living for generations.  And they are just as vocal against animal abuse,  puppy mills and Backyard breeders as the AR group that ends up persecuting them.  Had this been done as a documentary, instead of ""entertainment,""  my guess is no one would have given it a glimpse.  As it is, few will, but I encourage you to do so.

The Fact is that the Animal Welfare Act ALREADY prohibits the conditions that the antagonists in this movie are pushing.  The American Kennel Club is heavily promoting this movie, and while The AKC is not perfect by any means, I fully understand its support of a movie that shows the underside of many Animal rights organizations, whose agenda is ""One Generation and Done"".

If you watch the huge number of animal rights ads on TV (the 3 biggies  HSUS, ASPCA, and PETA), it is hard not to be struck by the sad faces and stories.  This movie is accurate in that some of those images are altered, taken out of context, and yes, even faked.  There are also real images that are way out of date, as well as real images from current cases.  Before passing on the pictures, at least know the background of them.  The other facts are that the organizations that plead so touchingly for your ""small monthly donation that will help save a dog or cat""  use the majority of that money for more ads, fundraising, and lobbying.  Cruelty laws that prevent cruelty laws that actually prevent CRUELTY, are great. But the facts are that those laws already exist. If you want to really save animals in shelters, PLEASE VOLUNTEER OR DONATE TO YOUR LOCAL SHELTER.  The money will go MUCH further.  (please note that your LOCAL SPCA or Humane Socoety are NOT the national organizations.

My 5 star rating is largely because it may may you THINK before blindly donating to a cause about which you know little.

As it says at the end of the movie.  INVESTIGATE BEFORE YOU DONATE!  And no investigation nis complete unless you look at BOTH sides.",1469145600,10,2556,4.597345132743363
7739495,5,B01ERHK1E6,"Based on several illegal seizures of entire kennels, this movie shows what really happens and the motives behind it.  Many times the dogs are put in far worse conditions from which they were taken.  Lies, doctored films and photos, whatever it takes to get the public to donate to the big money ""humane society"" organizations.  Often times the press release is written BEFORE the raid has taken place.  Once the publicity is gained and the sensationalized commercials hit the airways, these organizations disappear, leaving the small local shelter with no financial support to properly care for the stolen dogs.  Deaths,  injuries, ""accidental"" breedings  and even starvation follows.  The dogs are victimized for the financial gain of these so called humane societies  while their rightful owners are guilty until proved innocent and go bankrupt in the process.",1468972800,8,862,5.279411764705882
7739496,5,B01ERHK1E6,"After reading some reviews I was unsure how I would feel about the movie.  After watching it with my wife I can honestly say many of the negative reviews claiming this movie is a lie that promotes puppy mills is ridiculous! I did some research and found out it was actually based on a true story (Dan Christensen I believe).  People should educate themselves before speaking.  While the acting was decent, I would give the acting itself a 7 out of 10.  The story line was decent as well.  I think the negative reviews are a hand full of people that despise dog breeders.  I actually didn't feel like this movie promoted puppy mills at all, it simply tried to open the viewers eyes to know WHO the were donating money to so as much of the money would go to your intended purpose.

Let's hope this film is the first in a series that expose the true story behind those ""send $19 a month"" so-called charities.  Bravo to the producers.  Every dog lover, every pet owner, and every legitimate, hard-working animal rescuer is damaged by these out-of-control organizations.  Wonder how many of their paid bloggers and social media employees will attack this movie and give it one-star ratings?  Dozens?  Hundreds?  If they use all their aliases, the numbers could be staggering. Your $19 a month donation buys lots of propaganda.  Too bad less than 1% of donations go to animal shelters.",1467936000,9,708,5.095652173913043

The Humane Society of the United States owns and operates NO shelters, has NO police powers and is not part of the federal government. They are a privately owned political lobbying organization opposed to ALL breeding of animals. The HSUS scams innocent people out of their money. They take in over $100 Million dollars a year and give less than a million dollars to shelters. The rest they spend on travel, million dollar homes, pensions, huge salaries and have over $100 million dollars sitting in an offshore account. Last year they gave less than a million dollars to animal shelters but run commercials that make you think your money goes to help shelter Animals!!! ""Investigate before you donate"". The HSUS has the worst charity rating you can get. To find out more about the HSUS go to humanewatch.org

8759428,3,B01ERHK1E6,"The Dog Lover is one of those budget DVD films where the DVD cover image never appears in the movie, or most of the characters (as in canines) aren't even in the movie, such as the golden retriever she is patting.  It is a propaganda film rather than a movie. It's not a movie with a subtle message, it actually lectures you at the end with text on the screen as to what it wants you to do. Which would be fine it is advertised the film that way on the DVD cover, but it doesn't, meaning a lot of people will buy/rent this one after a nice dog plot movie, but half way through realise they're not watching a movie but a promotional video that (spoilers follow) wants you not to donate money to vigilante animal surveillance/rescue groups.

The basic premise of this one is Sara (Allison Paige - Days of Our Lives), a vegetarian animal rights extremist after successfully filming the atrocious conditions dogs are in at a puppy mill, after going undercover as someone wanting to buy a dog, is offered a bigger target for an undercover gig.  She is told a famous for opposing legislation the group wants passed in Washington, hunting dog breeder is mistreating animals for profit, and if she infiltrates by pretending to be a vet student wanting some live on the farm work experience, she'll not only save those dogs on that farm, but rid the opposition to the bill's power, by showing the true colours of their most vocal spokesman.  Sara eagerly accepts this assignment. The realism of this is on par with the old Get Smart episodes where 99 would without any qualifications get a job in an organisation that was secretly a front for Chaos on a mission of evil.  We're expected to believe a dog breeder farm one would need a veterinary student, when they've got a vet (Lea Thompson from Back to the Future movies).  Two that if they did, they like any other potential employer would not run a back ground check, Google the applicant or, at least confirm with the university she claims to be studying a veterinary degree with that she is actually a student. Not to mention throughout the entire time she's on the farm, she never actually helps Lea Thompson's character to do any vet work.

Once she flies to the farm by private jet, (you'd think this would be another giveaway to the breeder who is meeting her at the airport on the runway that she's not a poor university student, not to mention the fact she's arriving at the airport would further make them question why she couldn't find a farm or facility to get veterinary experience somewhere a bit closer to where she lives than somewhere she needs to board a plane to fly to). It's not like they're at an exotic location where she can go skiing, or to the beach when not working. So the movie sort of has a made for TV feel to it with it's script.  It seems to be a pretty obvious as soon as we get to the farm how the movie in relation to Sara's involvement on the farm is going to turn out.  Although the dad on the farm does make it seem like her undercover placement might not be justified by flying off the handle with the fact she has a mobile phone, and telling her never to go up the hill to that wooden shack with the padlocks on it.  The son also looks around sheepishly when exiting the place.  Why not just tell her what is, if you tell someone not to go in a forbidden mysterious place, and you've got a valid reason, you mention that, especially if she's supposed to be a vet student and would understand that reason.  Like I said the quality of the script is like a Lifetime/Hallmark movie writer wrote it.  They even throw in the cheesy love interest with the breeders son, and the standard, I thought you were my friend line from the little girl.  Even though the little girl and Sara don't seem to have ever had any quality time together, let alone a friend, or big sister little sister moment before that line. In fact the little girl didn't seem to trust her or believe she was a vet student at all.

Then of course we have the propaganda film second half of the movie.  The raid makes no sense, sure the breeder has to let the cops onto his farm and in his barns with the warrant, but the warrant doesn't let protesters and extremist groups accompany them with video cameras. It is supposed to be a potential crime scene after all, you don't contaminate that with more people.  The acting by the prosecutor guy, well actually more so probably the script he is acting from is laughable at how bad it is in one scene. You'll know it when you see the scene.  Overall the second half of the film tries to demonize organisations that have demonized the dog breeding industry.  Of course the truth is probably somewhere in the middle for both.  But the point is viewers don't like being propogandered and lectured to which is what this film ultimately is, rather than a movie about a girl who gets used by people with their own agenda.

Being the region 4 DVD is a budget DVD (Eagle Entertainment) there's no special features so you'll have to do your own research on the real story, the DVD cover claims with the words Based on a True Story.  It would have been nice to have had a documentary on what really happened to see how little or how much it actually matches what happened in the movie.  Since this is a propaganda film and not a movie, you've got to wonder why it's not there?  Surely you'd have a lot of extras with experts talking to the camera supporting the claims of the movie if they rang at all true.",1521849600,,5489,4.390532544378698
