It provides an excellent overview of the tragic history of this very vital region of the world. All of the major battles fought there in World War I are covered as well as subsequent wars after the ending of World War I.This documentary clearly explains a lot of the who,what and how of the numerous military and political figures and treaties that shape today's Middle East.",1212969600,,710,5.970588235294118
2636857,5,B000HEWH3C,"""Blood and Oil"" reveals the energy politics that guided the dismantling of the Ottoman Empire in the Middle East and Caucasus.  The film, perhaps controversially, uncovers how Russia, Great Britain and France exploited ethnic and religious differences to fuel revolts against the Ottoman Empire, so that the West could dominate certain petroleum-rich areas, from Baku in Azerbaijan to Mosul and Kirkuk in Iraq.  One track followed very closely in the film is that of the Russians (from the east) and French (from the south) instigating the Armenian Revolt, 1885-1920, that killed hundreds of thousands of Muslims, mostly Kurds, in eastern Anatolia and the Caucasus, the Ottoman response to which brought terrible suffering upon the Armenians.  The film also delves into the British-engineered Arab revolts from the Sinai, to Palestine, to Baghdad.  ""Blood and Oil"" draws acute parallels between the British invasion of the Middle East in WWI and the present US occupation of Iraq, both of which seemed designed to redraw the region's borders under the guise of self-determination and human rights, but of course in line with energy objectives of the West.  The ethnic and religious feuds of one hundred years ago still haunt the region today, raising the question whether the War to End All Wars actually created a peace to end all peace, as David Fromkin argues in the documentary.",1170892800,23,1382,5.179372197309417
2636858,5,B000HEWH3C,"This is an excellent and compelling documentary of events leading to the middle east crisis that we have been feeling for the last almost 100 years.  The video footage is well done and the narration is clear, not cluttered, and informative.  The entire DVD is very objectively done and I found I could not stop it once I started.  And I am not a war buff or one who likes war documentaries.  Everyone should see this DVD to understand why we're in Iraq now and how the way the US has gone in there (and Afghanistan as well) is unlikely to help and will probably exacerbate an already bad situation.",1169424000,6,598,4.409090909090909
2636859,5,B000HEWH3C,"""Blood and Oil"" is an eye-opener and, as such, a documentary which should be viewed by every American (and I would even say by every Westerner) and, more crucially, by everyone in our political system who is involved - directly or indirectly - in making decisions regarding Iraq and our mostly unenlightened policy in the Middle-East.

In this riveting and carefully researched video, Marty Callaghan shows us how, in the aftermath of World War I (which most Westerners think ended in 1918 - when strife persisted for several more years in the Middle-East) agreements were made, mostly between between France and Britain, which resulted in the carving of the old Ottoman Empire into artificial nations - Iraq, Iran, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Palestine, and Syria - which have remained hotbeds of political and military mayhem ever since.  Oil was the black gold that motivated, and still motivates the West to constantly interfere in the Middle East, without taking into account its widely diverse population, without seeking to understand the complexity of its many cultures and ethnic composition.  It is so much easier to lump all of its people as ""Moslems"" or ""Arabs"" - terms which, nowadays, are often, and very sadly, equated in the minds of many Westerners with a propensity for terrorism.

You do not need to have any background in history to enjoy and fully understand this documentary, which conveys complex events and intricate political dealings with great clarity and in a very compelling fashion.  Some of the historical footage Callaghan dug up is very cool, as is the original soundtrack by Michael Goodis.",1167609600,24,1627,5.101503759398496
2636860,5,B000HEWH3C,"If you want to understand what the United States is up against in the Middle East, watch ""Blood and Oil.""  The primary reason U.S. foreign policy since 9/11 has been wholly ineffective is the administration's ignorance of history and other cultures.  The ""war on terror"" has repeatedly been likened to World War Two and the Cold War -- analogies that don't hold up.  However, the real antecedents lie in World War One.  In the West's last gasp of colonialism, Britain and France apportioned this region between themselves, creating the artifice we now call the Middle East. Since that time, Arabs (and Persians) have chaffed under this unwanted arrangement.  Much of the volatility in that region today has grown directly out of the accords made during and immediately after World War One.

Marty Callaghan is among the first to provide a much overdue perspective of the real historical forces we're dealing with today.  ""Blood and Oil"" is a good primer on the interactions of the Western powers with the Arabs and Ottoman Turks during the war and the long-term ramifications of these actions.  Until American policy makers understand these historical dynamics, we will be doomed to continued inept foreign policy -- like going on a roadtrip and using the wrong map.

Other resources I would recommend:

- PBS's ""The Road to 9/11"": provides an overview of the political forces that have shaped the Middle East during the 20th century

- PBS's ""Lawrence of Arabia: The Battle for the Arab World"": recounts T.E. Lawrence's work as Britain's pointman in cultivating Arab help in World War I in exchange for promises of Arab independence

- Jonathan Lewis' ""The First World War -- The Complete Series"": superbly made documentary series on all facets of WWI, including one episode on ""Jihad""

- World War I: The ""Great War"": a college-level course taught by Prof Vejas Gabriel Liulevicius, available on DVD through The Teaching Company",1166918400,49,1930,5.012539184952978

The appeal of this is to those who would like to attack Europe and the US for the chaos in modern Middle East. The film doesn't even do that well. If you want to talk about the Ottoman Empire, then don't position is as though all of the encompassed area was always Ottoman. If you want to talk about slaughter, then don't leave out what happened during the genocide of thousands of Armenians in Turkey.

Over all it is a good starting point for those who would like to understand the reasons why there was and continues to be so much blood shed, perpetual wars and unrest in the middle east. The western imperialistic powers stirring up the region for it's hunger for power and desire to control the resources was only the starting point to what has followed there after until today.",1328918400,4,1008,4.894736842105263
2636902,1,B000HEWH3C,"The most crucial events are ommitted, because the documentary makers slavishly adhere to the Turkish government's re-writing of history. The repeated dishonest treatment of the Armenian genocide is an embarassment unworthy of a serious documentary. Even when relating that Turkish soldiers died from a lack of medical care, the documentary makers cannot bring themselves to mention the government order to execute the relatively large Armenian medical staffs at every military hospital. When the desparate shortage of military supplies is mentioned, we are not told that the massacre of hundreds of thousands of Armenian manufacturers and farmers caused the shortages. In a bizarre reversal, Turks are presented as innocent victims of war, never as perpetrators. You'd never guess that the Turkish government's crimes were considered so heinous as to cause the very first use of the term ""crimes against humanity.""(better to read THE BURNING TIGRIS by Peter Balakian, or Turkish scholars Taner Akcam (SHAME), and Vahakn Dadrian (many titles).)

The depiction of the post-war period is equally distorted. There isn't a single mention of the attempts of the post-war Turkish leaders and Parliament to punish the war criminals. So, we are not told that the Turkish Justice Ministry filed cases against over 250 persons for war crimes. These files contain official telegrams, documents, and officials' depositions tying the wartime government to the policy of genocide.

The puny Armenian ministate that emerged after the peace settlement is shamelessly described as the great threat to Turkey (!), while the documentary makers ""forget"" to mention that the dictator Ataturk easily wiped out this ministate, and ordered more massacres of Armenian civilians.

Other minorities get the same ridiculous bias. Kurdish independence was crushed by the combined armies of Ataturk and Great Britain (for the sake of oil); but, the documentary only states that Kurdish aspirations for independence were a 'Western fabrication.' In other words, Kurds love the Turkish occupation so much that they would never wish to be free. (For a dose of reality, see Susan Meiselas' amazing picture album KURDISTAN IN THE SHADOW OF HISTORY.)

Greeks are dismissed as foreign invaders. In point of fact, Greeks were given temporary control of Smyrna/Izmir Province by treaty with Turkey, and under the supervision of the League of Nations. After five years, there was to be a vote on which country the inhabitants wished to join. The prospect of losing this vote is what prompted Ataturk to burn Smyrna and massacre the majority-Greek inhabitants, a fact considered best left unmentioned in the documentary. What a disgrace.

2636905,5,B000HEWH3C,"I had been wanting to watch this documentary to understand more about the western world's fascination with oil and why the US and the UK have been so headset on defending the Levant.  This documentary doesn't really cover the history of oil as it covers the general importance of the Middle East as a geo-political hotbed. In that regard, this documentary works well giving the inquisitive mind a good overview of the regional history that reached its zenith before World War I when the Ottoman Empire was the bane of the Russian, Austrio-Hungarian and British Empires of greater Europe.

This documentary covers the time just before World War I through the early 1920s and the great transformations of that decade on Palestine.  Bloody wars were fought in the Ottoman Empire not so much to take control of the oil fields there, but to take care of those pesky Turks in the eyes of the British, French and Russians.  Gaining control of the oil fields was just a reward for the winners; European strategists assumed the easiest adversary to neutralize would be the Turks with their undermanned armies and then the Middle East could be carved up by the winners.  As we all know now, that wasn't quite so easy.

But as the documentary shows, there was much backstabbing by the English, German and French forces in and after WWI, and it was the military need for oil during WWI that showed those countries how valuable oil was to propel its new industries.  While most documentaries of WWI cover either the western or eastern fronts, few cover the southern front fought in the former Ottoman Empire as this documentary does, and for that this production deserves much merit.

The viewer comes away from this documentary getting a better understanding of why there is much tension in the Middle East in reference to its Jewish-Palestinian crisis, the Arabs' control of oilfields, the diaspora of first the Jewish tribes and then the Armenians, and why three major religions place such high stakes on that region.

I highly recommend this for anyone interested in WWI, WWII, Middle Eastern affairs and global issues.",1305244800,,2110,4.871508379888268
2636906,3,B000HEWH3C,"The short description and generally enthusiastic reviews of this DVD are a bit misleading.  I thought that this DVD was about the political machinations of the Western powers after WWI as the Middle East was broken up into its present form.  The first few minutes of the DVD describe the run-up to the second Gulf War (2003), and the impression that the viewer initially has is that this documentary will provide one with the historical context that led to the invasion of Iraq.  Sadly only the last 20-30 minutes of the DVD touch on this issue, the first 2/3s-3/4s of the video is a fairly standard military history of the fighting in the Middle East during WWI  from the British perspective.  It is fair to characterize this documentary as a huge disappointment.  The first hour and a half or so of this DVD contains a description of the fighting in the Caucasus, in Iraq, at Gallipoli, and in Palestine between the Turks, Russians, English, and French.  We learn about the campaigns from a top level perspective, a few experts pine about the brilliance of Winston Churchill and the underrated fighting qualities of the Turkish soldiers, and the inevitability of British victory.  The depth of the material covered in this part of the documentary is less than what you could find in Wikipedia and for anyone who already knows anything about these campaigns is probably not worth the time to watch.  There is some nice footage of the battles though, particularly from the Turkish side.  About 2/3s of the way in though, the story changes dramatically as the war is won and the Great Powers decide to chop up the Middle East to their advantage.  We learn about the Sykes-Picot agreement, the rise to power of Kemal Ataturk, the Balfour declaration and the mass immigration of tens of thousands of European Jews to Palestine, and get a glimpse into the creation of some of the demographic problems (like Armenian and Kurdish states) that exist to this day.  If only the documentary had spent all of its nearly two hours on this fascinating topic, it could have been an all time classic.  As it is, only about 20-30 minutes of this DVD are worth watching in my opinion, and so little time is devoted to the key issues that the narrator has little opportunity to do more than throw a few buzz words around.  It is my firm belief that to understand the Gulf War in the mess we are now in in Iraq, we must understand how we got there.  Middle Eastern history didn't start in 1990 with the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.  I rented this DVD in the hopes of learning more about the events leading up to the present sorry state of affairs.  I agree with many of the other reviewers that the West's handling of Middle Eastern affairs is largely a disgrace with the US and Great Britain generally playing one group off against another for their own ends.  If you really want to learn about Middle Eastern history and the role that the West has played there since WWI, you aren't going to learn much from this DVD.  You're much better off reading Fromkin's book ('A Peace to End all Peace'), Kinzer's book about Iran (`All the Shah's Men'), or the role of oil in geopolitics (Engdahl's book `A Century of War') among many others.  If you want a quick overview of the military campaigns of the Great War in the ME, this isn't a bad documentary.  Don't be mislead by some of the other glowing reviews, for a serious student, this DVD is nothing more than a snack.",1236038400,14,3444,4.594771241830065
2636907,5,B000HEWH3C,"Unlike most of the programs on this subject, this one doesn't seem to be created for commercial purposes.  Therefore, it's short in entertaintment and long on truth.  Nevertheless, it's never boring.

Credentials of the producer is impressive too, which is a big plus to enhance the credibility of the material.  Having watched a number of World War I programs, I can easily say that this one is unique in many ways.

Watch it to gain a better perspective of the events that took place a very long time ago but still haunt Middle East.",1235347200,2,535,4.648936170212766
2636908,5,B000HEWH3C,"I'm always suspicious of a DVD documentary which, upon purchase, causes Amazon to start recommending to me crap like 9/11 conspiracies, oil companies controlling governments, and all sorts of wildly extravagant conspiracy theories that range from aggrandizing the trivial to simply making stuff up.

Ignore all that if it's happened to you; the only controversy this disc could ignite would be the careful avoidance, or potentially total ignoring of the Armenian Genocide from 1915-1917, said to be the inspiration for Adolph Hitler's Final Solution.

The documentary starts very much within 1914, and focuses on the ""forgotten war"" in World War I, that of the Ottoman Empire versus seemingly everyone else.  Every major campaign from the failed Ottoman incursion into the Caucasus, the failed Ottoman incursion across the Suez Canal, to the political, military, and social developments throughout the war, from Winston Churchill's scapegoating for the disaster of Gallipoli, the taking of Baghdad, the massively successful push by Edmund Allenby past Gaza, and into Palestine and Jerusalem, and T.E. Lawrence's role in the Arab revolt.

The first 2/3s of the documentary, being almost wholly devoted to the Ottoman Empire and it's pisspoor management under the Three Pashas, and in-depth military coverage, strategies, movement, etcetera, followed by the seemingly heroic actions of General Mustafa Kemal in resisting the Allied attempt at stealing Turkish lands, and forcibly forming the Republic of Turkey.

These events prove to be highly significant to the last portion, which covers just how these events were directly responsible for causing the issue of the Western World intruding in the Arab World, and the introduction of Israel into the mix.

According to the documentary, the Ottoman Empire overextended itself.  After being defeated in the Balkans in 1912-1913, the Turks did not want war, but Enver Pasha brought them into war anyway, and brought British eyes directly on their land.  Early on, the British knew the significance of the oil in Ottoman lands, and so were relentless to trounce the Ottoman Empire, and utterly destroy them to steal their lands.

They would have succeeded with Turkey if it weren't for Mustafa Kemal.  The region of Syria, Iraq, and Palestine did not escape this, as Britain and France arbitrarily divide Arab lands for themselves, turning their backs on the Arab leaders they had supported against the Ottomans, who now end up fighting the British and French in a series of wars that seemingly extend World War I for several years afterwards, in quite a sharp mirror to the current war in Iraq.

And the documentary does go on to connect the problems experienced between British greed and Arab nationalism, extending further on to include the British mandate to protect the Jews in Palestine, which was later dropped, allowing the Jews to forge their own nation of Israel, and the inclusion of the United States into the conflicts.

This is a highly engrossing, fully-fleshed out and heavily in-depth documentary, which greatly benefits from hundreds of photographs as well as video clips, and apparently licensed use of clips from movies, particularly ""Lawrence of Arabia"".

The only major drawback of this documentary is that there was no coverage given to the Armenian Genocide.",1233360000,15,3327,5.278409090909091

There also seems to be less blame given to Churchill because the entire mess at Gallipoli was his idea.  As has already been pointed out, the Armenian massacres by Turkish troops beginning early in the war is left out.  It's better than I could have put together, I suppose.
