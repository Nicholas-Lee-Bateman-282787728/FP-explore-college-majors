7894951,5,6305732426,Geobreaders is a nice comedy anime. It features a cast of very interesting characters. It's hard to describe this show without spoiling it so I'll sum it up with a tag line of my devising: A young man gets more than he bargened for when he goes to work for a group of young women. I really like this show. It may cause you to never look at cats the same way again - just kidding. It's very funny and has a catchy ending theme.,1336089600,,426,4.023529411764706
7894952,3,6305732426,"Geobreeders is something of a cross between Burn-Up W and Phantom Quest Corporation. The all-girl one-guy team, fighting, fan service, and the fact that Kagura is a struggling anti-supernatural phenomena company all make it so.

It's very hard to effectively summarize Geobreeders' plot. In the first episode, we are thrown right into the middle of a confusing situation. Someone hires Kagura Total Security to do something, and in the next scene we see the gang storming off somewhere -- only to be intimidated by a huge tank with numerous phantom cats on board. A bit later, Kagura's chasing a certain phantom cat wreaking havoc in a building... and I still had no idea why what's happening was happening. In the succeeding episodes, Taba's pet phantom cat Maya gets kidnapped, and Kagura concentrates its efforts on finding her.

Just about the only unique concept in this anime is the phantom cats, and they aren't explained very well at that. All I know is that they can morph into humans and they have superhuman strength, reflexes, plus other powers and abilities. Phantom cats seem rather commonplace in the Geobreeders setting, but there is no background information provided... so you don't know how they came into being and what their real purpose in the story is.

The visuals are exceptional. Character designs are attractive, objects are drawn with much detail, and backgrounds are rendered nicely. While some scenes include scantily-clad girls and incidental breast exposure, Geobreeders is far from being anything erotic. Action and violence are portrayed without blood and gore. The English dubbing is okay as well.

I have mixed feelings about Geobreeders. The plot is chaotic and somewhat unintelligible. Even after watching all three eps, I was still quite clueless. There's a smattering of humorous moments, but nothing is laugh-out-loud funny. However, the production values are rather high -- you get great art, animation, and music. It's not some cheapo show you'd casually dismiss, but it won't leave you craving for more either. With just about an equal amount of pros and cons, Geobreeders surpasses an average rating only by a hair.",1120089600,9,2160,5.145299145299146
7894953,5,6305732426,"Any one who likes watching giggling girls fighting with guns should stay away from this one. This about a group of tough-as-nails girls who travel as Kagura Total Security fighting phantom cats. Oh yeah, and did I mention there's only one guy on the force. These three OVA episodes are suberb for action. In one scene, a phantom cat is running around in a mall with guns blazing here and there. There is one scene in which the explosions never seem to stop and a brilliant helicopter scene that would make 'The Matrix' jealous. The dialogue is without a doubt well done. The animation is very well drawn. Overall, if you crave action and have a high threshold for explosions, watch Geobreeders and be amazed.",983232000,,708,4.672
7894954,4,6305732426,"First, the ""animation director of MACROSS PLUS"" on the top of the DVD shouldn't be the motivator to buy this video because you are  watching somewhat adults in a sort of kids character design.  I guess  ""Bugsy Malone"" comes into mind.
Anyway, at first, I thought the  anime was going a little slow but once you get to the second OAV and so on,  you are hooked to the anime.  A lot of action and interesting characters to  hook you in.
Now,  as for the animation.  I thought it was pretty cool  and colorful.  The audio was something I don't recall it being anything  major but I was expecting less from this anime to begin with and I felt I  got more than expected.  Oh, the DVD comes with dubs (I dislike dubs) and  for purists, subtitles (YEAH!) are also included.  If anything though, it  seems you get more if you have a DVD-ROM which I don't have and so I can't  see the image gallery or storyboards.  Why didn't they include it as a  special feature for everyone who doesn't have a DVD-ROM to see.
Anyway,  GEOBREEDERS is a fun anime to watch and I think you will enjoy it if you  watch all three OAV episodes straight through.",967852800,2,1133,4.295238095238095
7894955,4,6305732426,"The Ghostbusters reference is that the Kagura agency has a job of eliminating phantom cats who can mess with electronic data and cause some  heck to life. The Baywatch reference will be obvious once you watch.
This  is fun. Sharp animation, plenty of humor, good action, lovable albeit  stereotypical characters, and a swimsuit or two.
The plot is a little  muddled (hence only 4 stars) about a kidnapped Kagura member along with the  phantom cats about to return a nuclear warhead to the city in an explosive  way and some guy pulling the strings of both cases. But with cute girls,  exciting action, and Geobreeders humor, who cares? This is great  fluff.
Contains violence and nudity.",965088000,6,687,4.862068965517241
7894956,5,6305732426,"This is definitely one of the best action animes I've ever seen. Best described as a combination of a late '70s action show and the Ghostbusters, Geobreeders revolves around the almost all female crew of Kagura Total  Security, a for-hire company that hunts down and captures the dangerous  phantom cats (living computer programs that can assume the form of cats or  humans and take control of any electronic system.) Geobreeders combines  excellent action, animation, and dialogue to make a film that is a definite  cut above a generous percentage of current titles. The animation has  unusually good flow and is relatively free of the sometimes irritating  stop-start qualities found in a lot of anime. In particular the level of  detail in the vehicle and gun designs is astonishing, I haven't seen  anything this good since Gunsmith Cats (another highly reccomended OVA).  The dialogue is crisp and manages to maintain a fairly regular rhythm while  the translation does an amicable job of avoiding the usual questionable  phrases and pauses. There's some nudity and mild cursing, but almost zero  blood and no actual sex, parental discretion might not hurt. I reccomend  this to anyone who wondered what would happen if Charlie's Angels and the  A-Team interbred.",961113600,2,1268,5.147058823529412
