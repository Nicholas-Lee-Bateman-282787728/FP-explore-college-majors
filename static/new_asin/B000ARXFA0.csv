Find out and see it. Below is a list of what I thought of the actors for each character in the movie:
Felcity-5 stars(She looked and acted just perfectly)
Elizabeth-5 stars(While she didn`t look much like the doll she did a great job at acting)
Felcity`s Father-5 stars(He plays a great father!)
Felcity`s Mother-5 stars(Good actor and is perfect for the role)
Ben-5 stars(He`s just what I imagined him to be like in the books)
Jiggy Nye-5 stars(Great at being the bad guy :)
Annabelle Cole-5 stars(Very snobby like her book character)
Nan-5 stars(Great actor for her age)
Willam-4 stars(Was so young he didn`t do as much as most the actors)
Felcity`s Grandfather-5 stars(Very good actor!)
Miss Manderly-4 stars(Was Ok but didn`t look much like the book character)
Moses-4 stars(You don`t see him much so I can`t say much either)
Miss Wentworth-5 stars(Looks alot like book character)
And those are my thoughts on the actors. Hope you got some good info.",1134432000,5,1593,4.77536231884058
2390638,4,B000ARXFA0,"Overall I found the film to be enjoyable,being a history buff. However I was disappointed with the 'look' of the film. With Colonial Williamsburg in all its restored glory as a reference,most of the sets looked NOTHING like the Williamsburg I have visited many times. Curved Streets? There are none in Colonial Williamsburg. Wooden Church? Never existed. I mean couldn't the set designer pay 5 bucks for a Colonial Williamsburg guide book? Or better yet,why not film in Williamsburg to begin with. Its been done before.",1134000000,7,519,5.046511627906977
2390639,3,B000ARXFA0,"The second holiday movie in the American Girls series tried really hard, but failed to jump over several of its self-constructed hurdles. Yes, they got rid of the `transition' scenes from last year's 'Samantha' to allocate more story time, but 'Felicity' screen play writers obviously had not read the stories which this movie was supposedly based on.

Ben Davidson (Kevin Zegers) is supposed to have his hair tied up in a queue.  He is, after all, in training to become a respectable shopkeeper, like Mr. Merriman (John Schneider). Yet, Ben looks more like the alt-rockers I listen to today than either a colonial-era apprentice or an aspiring member of General Washington's army.  Even a revolutionary apprentice would have his hair in the professional style of that time.

Felicity (Shailene Woodley) is not supposed to visit her grandfather's plantation in the winter; she is supposed to be there in the springtime; an entire book is literally built around the idea. Plus, she is supposed to help out her father's store when he is called away. She, Ben, and Isaac are supposed to uncover the King's men stealing gunpowder in another one of her high spirited adventures, but it was completely omitted from the movie for whatever reason.

Finally, Miss Manderly (Janine Theriault) was way too young in the movie. According to the book, she already has grey hair.  Instead, she gave the impression of somebody only being in her thirties.  Felicity never looses a tooth in her tea cup or anywhere in this movie.

The actors do a good job with the material they had to work with, but the writers really needed to have understood what they were adapting a screenplay from. The little details of a story make all of the difference.

Having Felicity an independent and impatient horse lover-rescuer with empathetic friends, parents, and a grandfather wasn't enough of a distinguishing plot when the books themselves said that she did so much more. The Felicity in the movie certainly had spunk at the beginning, but apparently lost it by the end to become `ladylike'.

People who aren't interested in accurately bringing a story to life should not write screenplays for it.",1133740800,13,2169,4.950413223140496
2390640,5,B000ARXFA0,"Being a fanatic of the WB was why I tuned in to this movie but Felicity and the rest of these characters captured my heart in this heartwarming movie. I laughed, cried, smiled, and sighed...all makings of a great movie. You should own it now, especially with the holidays around the corner and just watch with the entire family because all ages will enjoy! :)",1133395200,5,359,4.538461538461538
2390641,5,B000ARXFA0,"My daughter and I loved the American Girl movie "" Samantha: An American Girl Holiday"" and eagerly looked forward to ""Felicity: An American Girl Adventure"". The movie centers around 10 year old Felicity in 1775 Colonial Williamsburg, Virginia. Felicity is a tomboy, would rather spend time with the horses, however her mother wishes her to become a ""gentlewoman"" (wife, mother, housekeeper). Upon taking her ""gentlewoman lessons"" she meets Annabelle and Elizabeth Cole. The Coles are loyalists from England living in the colonies. Elizabeth and Felicity become friends however their friendship is tested when Elizabeths father is sent to prison for showing loyalty to the king. The other part of the story is that Felicity befriends an abused horse owned by Jiggy Nye. Felicity ends up befriending the horse, training the horse, unintentionally stealing her, only to have her grandfather purchase the horse for her in the end. Felicity starts out as a self centered 10 year old but she learns to put others first, she rescues her father's apprentice Ben from the bounty hunters, she visits Jiggy Nye in prison to give him food and a blanket and lastly she takes care of her family while her mother is ill. By the end of the movie Felicity has changed from a child to a ""gentlewoman"" as her mother calls her. This movie will appeal to girls as well as boys while introducing American history to them. This is a movie for you to watch with your family again and again.",1133308800,67,1465,4.864
2390642,5,B000ARXFA0,"I watched the film with my 8-yr-old daughter and 10-year-old son, and we really enjoyed it.  The movie spent just enough time talking about Loyalists and Patriots that it really opened the doors for the kids to ask questions about Democrats and Republicans, and how families can be torn apart by their beliefs.  The moviw was well-acted and beautifully filmed.

I liked it, and I'm a 50-year old Dad!",1133308800,40,400,4.768115942028985

2390647,2,B000ARXFA0,"All three of the American Girl movies I've watched had acting that could be improved on, but for the other two, the sweetness of the story made up for it.

2390673,5,B000ARXFA0,"The American Girl movies are good-quality family viewing (don't let the occasional schmaltziness throw you off). Some of my favorite actors are in this one (John Schneider and Marcia Gay Harden). I think most of these type of movies have a good balance of story/character/history, so they introduce children to the historical aspect of the time covered in the movie but don't go into too much detail, which is just right for the audience. Check out the other American Girl movies, too. Julia Roberts was one of the executive producers for ""Kit Kittredge"" and ""Samantha"" (and more?), and we loved ""Saige,"" as we had given the doll to our granddaughter last Christmas (a plus on this one: Jane Seymour plays her grandmother). Isn't it time for American Boy dolls? (Our grandson enjoys the movies as much as we do.)",1410912000,,812,4.848920863309353

2390679,5,B000ARXFA0,"Shaliene Woodley stars as Felicity in this wonderful American Girl historical film.  You may already know that more recently Shailene played the role of George Clooney's daughter  in the Descendants, and even more recently she starred in The Fault in Our Stars.  IF you've seen Ms. Woodley in either of these films you might be surprised to see her performing as an adorable child, in colonial era costumes in The American Girl  film Felicity. And what a great job she does.  IF you have female children in the 8-12 age range this is a movie for them, especially if they like horses.  Also interesting are the bonus features, especially Felecity's Tour of Williamsburg in which Felicity and her English pal Elizabeth return looking considerably more mature than in the film and conduct a fun filled tour of colonial Williamsburg. .  I loved this segment. FELICITY is a great kids movie that will entertain and provide much to talk about afterwards.  Amazon sells the DVD separately, but it is also available in a four DVD set called ""4 Favorite American Girl Films"". Which includes ""Felcity"" and three other outstanding historical movies for the very low price of $10.  THis is a tremendous bargain.  You can't go wrong.",1406764800,,1220,4.878640776699029
2390680,5,B000ARXFA0,"This is our first American Girl movie and the whole family loved it!  It is safe for children (our youngest are 5), which I appreciate.  It is a lovely, engaging story with interesting characters that are well-acted.  I especially love that this is so different from the usual disrespectful, slapstick, brain-candy garbage that we see in most of the movies put out today.  This one is a gem!  Highly recommended!",1394323200,,412,4.828571428571428
2390681,5,B000ARXFA0,"We checked this out from the library for my 6-year-old granddaughter, and she just loved itand so did I. It's a wonderful period piece with good values at its heart, something I'd like to see more of presented to children and young people.",1394323200,,239,4.5813953488372094

2390688,5,B000ARXFA0,"I purchased this because Felicity was my favorite American Girl in the American Girls books. Needless to say I was not disappointed...Also, John Schneider plays the part of Felicity's father. That was another reason I bought it. Certainly glad I got it. :)",1382918400,,256,4.976744186046512
2390689,4,B000ARXFA0,"""Felicity: An American Girl Adventure"" is wonderful filmmaking, sure to capture the attention of anyone who appreciates historical drama with a human touch. This one is set in Williamsburg, Virginia, during the American Revolution, and the title character displays a tenacious heroism in her quest to do what is right, despite the threat of imminent danger. Felicity Merriman is beautifully played by Shailene Woodley. She is just perfect for the role, with an energetic screen presence, illuminated by a sweet smile that will steal your heart. Felicity's love for an abused horse teaches her, indirectly, how kindness to others can have a ""ripple effect"" for goodness and justice, no matter that the colonial world has erupted into rebellion. The direction is fluent but not overdone, cinematography is attractive, and acting is uniformly strong throughout the cast. In the interest of full disclosure, I should add that some of the period dialogue does not exactly roll off the lips in convincing fashion, and the special effect of snowfall looks awfully phony, but otherwise I bought this delightful production with no problem at all. You will be happy with this splendid film, which is funny, VERY touching at times, and ultimately inspirational.",1381017600,,1250,5.255

2390691,5,B000ARXFA0,"As with everything American Girl, this is a really well done, quality story and product.  I was surprised how many names I recognized among the producer/actors.  My daughter loves it, it's educational too, and I highly recommend it.",1370476800,,232,5.078947368421052
2390692,5,B000ARXFA0,"I loved this film, especially since the main actress later stars in ""Secret Life of the American Teenager."" This film is about loyalty to family and one's country, and growing up. It's beautiful and fun to watch and great for younger people. I may show this to my American Literature class just for a fun way to watch what life must have been like around the civil war era. It's about a young girl mostly, so the content is more geared to girls, but anyone who likes good clean films for a younger generation will like it.",1368576000,,522,4.391752577319588

Felicity and her friend Elizabeth from a loyalist family, strive to overcome the divisions between Loyalists and Patriots in Colonial America 1775 .  With both a Patriot Father and a Loyalist Grandfather in her family, Felicity struggles to keep a balance of love within her family and friends. Her love of horses connects her with Penny, a beatiful horse who has an abusive owner .  Felicity deals with an ill mother , a horse she wants to save , and the dynamics of the Revolution through self- sacrifice, values, & love learned from her loving Grandfather.  Her positive influence on Ben, her father's apprentice, becomes another success for Felicity !  I really loved this colonial film , showing the American fight for liberty with tender simplicity , and an excellent cast!

2390731,4,B000ARXFA0,My daughter (9) loves this movie. She loves the American girl Felicity. It brings her character to life. It also is very close to what happens in the first books for Felicity. Very wholesome entertainment.,1293062400,,205,4.885714285714286

2390735,5,B000ARXFA0,"All of the American Girl books and movies do a wonderful job of introducing history to our children, but Felicity is by far my favorite.

This movie is all about the Revolutionary war, the tea tax, all those things you would expect from a movie of this nature, but it's also about family, respect, friendship and compassion.  The values it teaches are needed so desperately in our times, and I highly recommend this to anyone who also wants to introduce the rich history of our country to our children.

The script and acting are high quality.  The disc quality is great.  The price is very reasonable.  There really is no reason not to try this one!",1284422400,,650,4.560344827586207

2390739,5,B000ARXFA0,"The action of the film takes place in 1775 before US Declaration of Independence in Williamsburg, so it relies heavily on the history. Felicity, a girl who loves horses more than preparing tea, is a main character. But this is not only about her. The movie shows the struggle of women for more rights just like Samantha film, although in different times. It also shows how in spite of division of the society into Patriots (for US independence) and Loyalists - they all can celebrate Christmas together. This reminds me of Democrats vs Republican constant bickering...

It also shows that every good deed will be repaid by another good deed. Sometimes it is almost naive in this aspect since we cannot expect people change so rapidly like in this movie. Still it is optimistic that the main idea is that nobody is totally bad and we can improve people by acting nicely towards them.

It brings to light many great discussions, such as the wrongdoing of the man in the movie who abused his horse and how being honest and honoring a contract is a sign of integrity. There is nothing objectionable in this film and I applaud the directors for creating a movie void of violence, sexuality, and bad language. I would highly recommend this movie and have added it to my Mom-Approved movie listing on my blog.",1257638400,,593,4.60377358490566

I work in the film industry and I was VERY pleasantly surprised at the quality of the production values; it felt like a good quality ""made for tv"" movie.  ALL of the cast do a great job, particularly the girl playing Felicity.  The story was rich enough not to bore adults and it provided many good ""learning points"" to talk about -- several times I found us pausing the movie to talk about the historical differences and similarities of 1775 to today with my niece.  There were a couple of mildly scary parts that worried my niece (a grandfather dies, a horse is treated badly, and the pregnant mother has a rough delivery, etc.) but all of these are handled responsibly in the movie and a marevelously happy ending comes to everyone.  There are several major male characters as well so boys will also like the story.  I whole-heartedly recommend ""Felicity"".  It's a great family adventure movie for everyone.  I just now bought the Felicity book series for my niece from Amazon.",1250553600,3,1140,4.5763546798029555

  The historical aspects of the movie are great for history buffs. But it also shows that back then, girls were taught to be a lady and be respectful to mom and dad. Yes Felicity has a mind of her own but she still knows she needs to honor her parents. She has a love for horses and that does get her into a little trouble. Felicity shows kindness to someone who was very mean to her, if only that could happen today in our world. Overall this is a good clean, movie with many values for kids to learn.

2390743,5,B000ARXFA0,"This is a wonderful movie adaptation of the American Girl books about Felicity. The other reviewers have done a good job at covering the book, I would just like to add that it can be a very sad story in multiple places. The apprentice disappears and is found injured, the beloved grandfather dies, the friend's father is in prison, then the mother almost dies and finally there are complications with Felicity's prized horse's delivery of its foal. All but the grandfather's death are resolved happily, but if you have a very sensitive child, the movie may take their emotions up and down too hard too fast. It is a great movie however, and is appropriate for adults and most children.",1247356800,2,685,4.716666666666667

2390755,2,B000ARXFA0,"As an American Girl fan and collector I looked forward to watching this movie. The acting was great, the actors looked the part and it was lovely seeing all of the houses and such from that time period. What I didin't like is that they totally changed the order of more than 10 different scenes. They were all scrambled up and not anywhere near the order of the books. Also some quotes were also totally scrambled and were moved to different characters than who originally said them in the book. They also totally changed the ending with Jiggy Nye and it was really over done. All in all I gave the movie a 2 out of 5 stars. Some good things but overall the books were much better and the movie was scrambled up in every way.",1231718400,7,725,4.299270072992701
2390756,4,B000ARXFA0,"I have loved the books on Felicity ever since I discovered them in the 90s when my niece was little.  Though I am in my 30s, I have bought all of them and have collected Felicity and all of her original accessories (I don't care as much for the newer things American Girl--now owned by Mattel--has brought out).

I thought the movie was a pretty good adaptation of the books which is, of course, what I was interested in.  It only bothered me a little bit that some things had to be rearranged for the flow of the screenplay--such as Felicity's birthday being in the fall rather than the spring, the incident with the Gunpowder Plot in Williamsburg was entirely left out and Felicity went to Grandfather's plantation during the fall or winter rather than in the summer like in the books.  But all that can be overlooked when you realize that movie adaptations have time constraints and have to consider the flow of the screen play, and some things don't translate well from book to film.

I am also an 18th Century history buff so I was interested in seeing whether the sets, costumes, hairstyles etc. would be accurate.  To my delight, I thought it was well done overall.  A lot of ""period"" films don't bother to do a lot of research into the clothing etc. and put all women in either ""pioneer"" dresses or ""hoop skirts"" and call it historical.  While the costumes were in some ways a bit ""over done"" (a typical ""middling sort"" of family wouldn't have had near the changes of clothes that the Merrimans did), over all I thought the costume designers did a great job.  I wish they had dressed ""Felicity"" more like she's dressed in the book illustrations as those were the older outfits that came with the doll and in my opinion were more accurate to the period.

A lot has been said in several reviews about low-cut gowns and such.  People need to understand that this was NOT the Victorian Era where everything was covered up--sometimes even piano legs!--for fear of immodesty.  That was not the case during the 18th century.  Just as our standards of modesty are different today, so were the standards of modesty different in the 18th Century from those of the Victorian Era.  Lighten up!  Learn some clothing history.

For those who are bothered by the fact that the story is not more historically accurate to the Loyalist/Patriot views etc., again I think people should lighten up.  This was not meant to be a historical documentary but rather an entertaining movie for kids that can help to be a springboard to get them interested in learning more about the 18th century and our nation's history.  (I got my history start with ""Little House on the Prairie"" which despite being loosely based on the wonderful books by Laura Ingalls Wilder is about as historically inaccurate in many ways as a period TV show can be.  So I am proof that a kid can eventually learn ""real"" history if you can get them interested to start with!)

I found the movie to be well acted and heartwarming.  Being very sentimental, I found myself shedding a tear or two here and there as the story of Penny and Felicity and Felicity's relationship with her grandfather were so touching.

I just rented this movie over the weekend and now plan to buy it.  I would recoomend this film to anyone with children from 8 - 12 years old or for people like myself who like a heartwarming story in a historical setting.",1230940800,3,3384,4.584717607973422

It has good stories (directly from the books) that are both interesting to kids (girls AND boys) and fairly true to the times.  My one real complaint about it is that it does not deal with the issue of slavery at all, and a family of Felicity's status would have definitely owned slaves.  Other than that, I had good discussions with my students afterwards about issues of social status and how people of certain classes were expected to dress and act during Colonial times.  It really helped my students get a better feel for the times we are studying, and brought up tensions leading up to the Revolution.

I liked the costumes, the ball scene was the best. Felicity learned a lot as did other girls in colonial Virginia.  I was impressed with the Mozart that they played. Proof that the Colonists had class and culture, regardless of what some of the snobs from abroad thought!

Felicity had a lot of courage to face up against Jiggy Nie who became a better man at the end when he helped deliver Penny's little horse. She had found a better home with Felicity and grew strong.

One thing though, I would call Annabelle ""Bananabelle"" right to her face! Bananabelle!

I thought a complaint though, it's about Ben. If Ben wants to leave to be a Patriot hero, despite his contract, let him! Times were changing, yes, but I disagree with Felicity's Grandfather.

The sets and costumes were beautiful to look at, but I sat opened mouthed as I watched this little terror of a child in action.  I don't see anything heroic or daring or admirable about her sneaking out of the house night after night to get into a pen with a dangerous horse, that isn't hers.  She steals the horse, and when she is finally forced to return it, she lets it go.  The consequence of her behavior?  Her indulgent grandfather finds the horse and buys it for her.  It just seemed like whoever wrote it was trying to fasten their ideas to historical characters, and it just sounded overtly preachy.  I have a hard time believing a child in colonial times would have gone around sounding like a mini-Betty Friedan.  Ultimately, Felicity ends up learning to do housework and drink tea, and gets all excited about getting dressed up to go to a ball...so I'm not even sure what message the movie was trying to get across, other that it is OK to steal from mean ugly people with Scottish accents.",1168300800,20,1172,4.464788732394366

2390782,5,B000ARXFA0,"Getting children interested in history is a tough thing to do, especially colonial American history. And it's a rarity these days when a historical film is made that is directed mainly to children. It's even more rare when such a film is done well enough that adults can enjoy it, too. ""Felicity - An American Girl Adventure"" is one of those extremely rare movies that shows, fairly accurately, life in the colonial era of our country's history. Oh, I'll be the first to admit that there are 'liberties' taken in this film, as is normal with Hollywood-type movies. But when one compares the liberties taken here to a historical film with more of an adult nature (""The Scarlet Letter"" comes to mind) I would say Felicity is much closer to historical accuracy.
The purpose of this film, however, is not necessarily to be a history lesson, but instead an entertaining story set during colonial times. Entertainment that tweens and parents should both enjoy and yet still understand the history behind it.
The best part is - - - there IS history to be learned here.
I enjoyed the inter-action of the main characters, especially with the grandfather, as it shows our ancestors not as stiff wood-cut sketches from history books but real people that actually existed at one time just like we exist today. In the course of watching this film we see fear, concern, anger, frustration...and happiness. This movie includes some of the discourse between family members concerning the outset of what would become the American Revolution, which, for whom this movie is geared towards, was really taking a gamble. But, I feel it paid off. This alone is reason to award this film five stars, as school children in today's day and age do not always get both sides of the story. Even I, who went to school in the 60's and 70's, was taught that the people who lived in the colonies - virtually ALL of the people - were against the King of England. It wasn't until I took it upon myself many years later to study that era that I found out that many, many folks were loyalists and took arms against family members and neighbors. ""Felicity,"" for the first time that I can see in a movie geared toward children, shows that other side of our history.
And, okay, I'll admit that seeing a ten year old girl sneaking out in the middle of the night to ride another person's horse might be taking it beyond reality of the time, but the director and producer and script writers are following the story line from the popular books. We know that little girls disobeying their parents without retribution would not have taken place during that time (although I'm sure most of today's youngsters will not follow Felicity's lead in this). And it does make for a good story that young folks can follow without the ""fast-action-gotta-keep-'em-interested"" style that's so popular to today's youth. But, the adult viewer must be aware that this movie is tailored toward the younger set and, thus, may not get into the deep details - or may gloss over - certain facts for story's sake. It does, however, allow for a story that can draw the kids, as well as their parents, in.

As a Civil War re-enactor, I tend to look for farbiness (inaccuracies) in all period movies (not just Civil War era flicks) and I must say there was very little that I could see in ""Felicity."" Oh, a few minor things in this movie are inaccurate - ""Hello"" was not a greeting at that time as we know it to be today, and Christmas was slightly over-done for the colonial period - but, all in all, the over-all viewing seemed to be a window into the past.

But, that's okay. I feel films like this (as well as the Felicity books) may just entice kids to learn more about Felicity's time period on their own, and that would be a good thing, don't you think?",1158710400,45,3789,4.595273264401772

2390784,3,B000ARXFA0,"Saw this on television when it came out. The American revoultion fascinates me, so I am inclined to have a look at anything that comes out on the subject.

If you're looking for a film to show children about the American revolution, I am sorry to say that this just is not it.

Felicity is a nine year old tom boy growing up in Colonial Williamsberg. (In one scene outof curiosity she runs around in a barrowed set of breaches). She is a wonderful human being. She helps a  horse escape from a cruel owner. She later helps the owner when he ends up in Williamsberg jail.

It is actually shot on sight. Great scenery.

It shows her getting a upper class girl's education for the time.

Her father is a shoppkeeper. Her Grandfather is a plantation owner. (Despite all the Black people, they don't mention a word of Slavery). Storm clouds of the American Revolutio are brewing.

She befriends a girl who's family is Loyalist. (Her grandfather is also Loyalist). But they're rather flat on explaining why they're loyalist. Other than the King is the King they seem to be Two dimensional about their beliefs.

Her friend, her father's apprentice, is a Patriot and he is even worse. He makes many mistakes. First of which being that most Patriots were not talking independence. Second being they never expressed grievences against the King back then. They made their complaints strictly against Parliment, Hoping the King would be a man of common sence which he was not. Taxation without representation actually meant something. After the French and Indian war many Americans like Benjamin Franklin were actually thinking of Americans being directly represented at Parliment with their own members. Parliment Rejected that and then began laying taxes directly on the Americans along with economic restrictions. These were not good for Americans who were in the process of rebuilding their own economy from the war. Not to mention the fact that at the time the American colonies were a cash poor barter economy which was made worse by Parliment  mindlessly putting restrictions on which was causing them a lot of problems.  As a Patriot his portrayal is pathetic.

In addition, which was also not mentioned, many were actually becoming paranoid that they were being set up for some major take over. This was the same time Parliment had enacted the Encloser Acts in Britain. Many of the displaced immigrated to the colonies rather than take their chances in the big city slums.

The film does not reflect these. It really is very Two Dimensional.

The most historicly true character is her mother, frequently pregnant. (The average Amercan woman of the time had between eight and ten children). During the course of the film she gives birth to a child and suffers complications from the pregnancy but manages to get through though causing a lot of anxiety in the family. This is very accurate.

Overall, this isn't a good film for helping understand the period.",1147651200,2,2953,4.868263473053892
2390785,4,B000ARXFA0,"I'd just like to state in defense of the rioting over 'disobey your parents and everything will be alright', that that isn't the message at all. Anyone who has ever read the Felicity books knows very well that the situation is that Felicity does what she believes in her heart to be the right thing. Any parent would applaud and feel pride for a child who stood up in what they believed in. It is true that Lissie's father tells her not to continue to see the horse because her owner is dangerous, but Lissie knows that the horse is being abused, so continues to do so anyway. Felicity Merriman didn't live in a time where you could telephone the ASPCA from the safety of your own home, she knew that if she did not act, the horse would die, so she acted. Acted in direct disobeyal of her father- but for the right reasons, and her father was able to see that in the end and did not feel anger with his disappointment, but pride. I think if any parent takes the initiative to discuss the issues at hand in this movie, no child will walk away thinking ""Gee, I really think we should disobey Mom because it's fun.""",1146787200,5,1112,4.3

I really like Felicity because she is high spirited, loves horses and is way braver than Ben, a boy!  I like the Felicity books too.  The movie is a little different than the books, but not much.  I think they just did this to make the movie totally awesome.  Every girl should watch this movie!!! It is great.  Felicity stood up for what she believes in and was helpful and kind.  She is someone to look up to.""",1137628800,11,510,4.239583333333333

Absolutely nothing was inappropriate along the lines of clothing (not an exposed bosom in site).  I found the horse's owner to be scary and mean, but in the end (surprise) he turns out to be a nice guy.  Regarding Felicity and disobeying her parents - it's just a story!  Most kids over 8 know the difference between right and wrong.  This is much friendlier than other movies being offered today.  A great alternative for kids that are too old for Disney cartoons but too young for Harry Potter and the likes. I'm surprised it's being torn apart by some reviewers.",1135900800,13,646,4.47008547008547

2390802,1,B000ARXFA0,"FELICITY is a beautiful film and a loving recreation of an era which one doesn't often see on the screen.  The cast is great and the film is entertaining.  BUT the main idea presented to kids via the main character is indeed ""disobey your parents and all will turn out well"".

I also must say here that I have read all these reviews and there was nothing ""religious"" in the ""warning"" review.  There's no need to straighten out any ""religious"" comments.  The issue is a basic family value:  obey your parents (or not).  Nothing religious about that.

My family enjoyed the film (it is certainly a likable film) with many appealing elements.  BUT I'm thankful that we rented it instead of buying it.  The ""warning"" reviewer is absolutely correct that the primary thrust of the main character's goal throughout the entire film does indeed teach a bad example to children:  go ahead and disobey your parents and everything will turn out just fine.

The problem here is that this is a film which is being marketed and promoted as family fare.  Actually even children's fare.  That is what makes these sorts of themes a concern.

For adults --who can spot issues like this one and overlook them-- it's a fine film.  But if you allow your children to watch, you'd better be prepared to initiate a thorough discussion following the viewing, and ""UN-teach"" the film's primary psychological lesson.  (See the very enlightening ""warning"" review below).

As to the costumes, no, nothing is indecent or anything and the period costumes themselves are lavish and beautiful to behold since we don't see these much anymore in films these days.

BUT --- I have been a constumes researcher for several period plays, and I can vouch that these costumes have been ""modernized"" (in terms of the low cut) as have the costumes worn by the actors in Williamsburg and most other historic sites.  You can't judge by such sites.  I have to agree with the two previous reveiwers who mentioned it;  the mother's costumes in this piece are pretty far fetched, historically speaking.  This point, btw, has  got nothing to do with moralizing, but just being historically accurate.  The upstanding mother of small children and the wife of a township store proprietor wouldn't dress like a floozey and get away with it (the townspeople would have more reason to boycott his store than loyalist politics!!).

To give the film it's due, it is refreshing simply because one doesn't often see this period of history portrayed anymore, and it has appealing characters, actors, and locations; however, the negative moral lesson which other reviewers have noted is a serious concern for a children's film.  It was a major deal-killer to what otherwise would have been a sure-fire and enthusiastic purchase for our family.",1135728000,27,2780,4.884615384615385
2390803,2,B000ARXFA0,"This is certainly a beautiful film in it's evocation of the period, and there's a lot that is good about it.

However, a central and ongoing plot point teaches a very dangerous lesson to children.  In the story, Felicity *repeatedly* disobeys her parents' clear instructions in order to visit an almost-wild horse (belonging to the ""villian"" of the story) and to tame and train the horse secretly, by night.  It takes many night sessions in order for her to do this.

In the context of the story this is very dangerous behavior because not only was the horse wild (having been previously demonstrated to be dangerous), but the man to whom it belongs was also, at that time, mean, drunken looking, and obviously threatening had he found Felicity on his property at night.  And, of course it was deliberate disobedience against her parents for her to be doing it anyway.

Now, during Felicity's repeated disobedient and dangerous visits I kept thinking that, in Disney-like fashion (that is, the *older* classic Disney films), there would probably be some consequences to her repeated and deliberate disobedience, and therefore a good lesson learned.  I thought that the huge horse, with it's wildly rearing hooves, would certainly hurt the child, necessatating the ugly intervention of the property owner, and thus teaching the girl (and the viewers) a moral lesson about the serious consequences of deliberate parental disobedience.

Was I right?

Nope.

In the story, the child successfully ""trains"" the horse by repeated disobedient and secretive nighttime visits, and, in the end, the adults basically overlook it, and in effect give their consent and approbation to everything the girl did.  (Her triumphant ride through the meadow after taming the horse, with theme music swelling up under the beautiful scenery effectively makes the girl's actions of disobedience out to be heroic). On top of that, the girl even gets the horse in the end (for which she's been dreaming the whole film, and which motivated her disobedience throughout).

There's no doubt that this is a well produced and visually beautiful film with a lot of good things about it --- and therein lies the danger.

Many parents will think this is wholesome family oriented entertainment and won't stop to consider the overriding LESSON being taught their children by the central crisis/desire of the main character (with whom the children are most strongly identifying!).

(As an aside, I must also mention that a previous reviewer's comments about the cleavage in the ladies costumes is also something which I noticed as being extreme and out of period.  If a real character of the time had worn the sort of buxom-displaying attire that Marcia Gay Harden's character (the mother!!) wears in this film, she would certainly have been considered a ""lady of the street"".  I also noted that, in that day, no child would have been allowed to even enter a prison, much less visit a prisioner as happens in the film.  Prisons in those days were dark almost dungeonlike places and there's no way a father would have taken his daughter into one.)

However, these historical inaccuracies are minor points compared to the overriding moral lesson of the film which is this: IT'S OKAY TO DISOBEY YOUR PARENTS AND YOUR FONDEST DREAMS WILL COME TRUE IF YOU DO.

Bottom line:  beautiful film, bad lesson.  It is a real shame.

One wonders what sort of parents the producers and writers are themselves that they did not spot this gaping moral flaw in the script before production.  But, then, sadly, some parents just don't care these days, do they?

If you are not familiar with the Disney film classics of the '40s through '70s, do yourself a favor and investiate them instead.  There are many historical films there which, while the history may not always be exactly accurate, at least do not overtly teach  accompanying lessons which work AGAINST the very lessons which family-oriented parents are trying to teach their children in the first place.",1135641600,64,4006,4.986466165413534

They have a problem with every doll! If you can't except the past for what it is, you're stupid! And of course this isen't like the book! No movie is exactly like the book. They had to stuff six books into one movie. They had to put the main points in it. Felicity did become more mature in the book towards the end of the series. Her mother even admitted it in Changes for Felicity. This movie was excellent and good for an American Girl movie. I personally loved it considering I've read every American Girl book there is.
