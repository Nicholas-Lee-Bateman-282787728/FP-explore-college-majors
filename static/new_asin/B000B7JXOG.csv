8082785,5,B000B7JXOG,"Davis and Stewart are wonderful in this funny little, old film about a couple who decide to die together and the impact on their daughter when they announce it. Her dilemma is well-defined: to stop them or not. I love seeing these two daffy people together and I love that the question of ending one's own life in the face of serious illness and doing it together, which could be controversial, is brought up clearly without side stepping the issue.",1402531200,,449,4.625
8082786,4,B000B7JXOG,"When a woman (Melinda Dillon, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND) drives from Carmel to Los Angeles to visit her aging parents (Bette Davis, James Stewart), they inform her that the mother is terminally ill and that they plan a double suicide rather than be separated. When attempts to talk them out of their plan fail, she contacts L.A. County Social Services for assistance. But instead of help, it starts a bureaucratic machine in motion that declares the couple incompetent to take care of themselves. This grim drama pulls no punches, this isn't ON GOLDEN POND. It's a painful sit as we watch this determined couple robbed of their choices, their dignity as the law determines what is best for them. The one and only teaming of Davis and Stewart is a treat. They play off each other very well, their mismatched personas (the befuddled congenial Stewart, the acerbic tart tongued Davis) reflecting so many real life mismatches one sees in real life that somehow complement each other. There's a smattering of comedy, mostly by the couple's multitude of felines named after movie stars (""Robert De Niro just threw up a bird's head!""). Whoever did Dillon's disfiguring hairstyle should have been taken out and horsewhipped! Directed by George Schaefer. With Jane Kaczmarek and Jacque Lynn Colton.

The IDA DVD from Spain is an adequate transfer with options for English or Spanish soundtracks. Spanish subtitles are easily disabled.",1373500800,5,1434,5.050632911392405
8082787,5,B000B7JXOG,Was not disappointed about the film.  Had to run it on a newer VHS machine. After that it is a very good film.,1356739200,,110,3.782608695652174
8082788,5,B000B7JXOG,"James Stewart & Bette Davis are together for the first time.

With over 170 films between them, 3 Oscars, 13 Oscar nominations and numerous awards from all over the world. Stewart and Davis are two of the screen's most distinguished performers.

In 'Right Of Way', Stewart and Davis play an elderly couple whose love and respect for each other is as fresh near the ends of their lives as it was at the start.

When a terminal illness strikes Mini (Davis). It is common sense and without regret that she and Teddy (Stewart) calmly decide to end their lives in what for them is an expression of love.

Their daughter is horrified and struggles to change her parents minds. Her good intentions backfire and the couple must fight for their Right Of Way.",1134777600,14,749,4.609022556390977
