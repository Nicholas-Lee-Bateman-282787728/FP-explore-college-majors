8470340,4,B005FNLUIS,"This is a great DVD set for any Barney fan, but what is really great about it is the Frosty Friends DVD thats included because it features Thomas, Bob the Builder, Kipper and more!  So you get two Christmas Barney DVDs and then one with all the HIT Entertainment friends!  My boys are typically not big Barney fans but they got a kick out of watching how Barney celebrates Christmas with his friends.  They visit the North Pole, see Santa and get presents!  There is of course lots of fun songs and good lessons for kids!",1320710400,2,521,4.395833333333333
