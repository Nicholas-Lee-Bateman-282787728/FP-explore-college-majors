3572581,3,B001FB55OE,"While this dark-hued 2009 musical extravaganza offers dazzling star power and the requisite Italiano coolness factor, director Rob Marshall cannot seem to drive the narrative toward an engaging level of momentum. I think his 2002 adaptation of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chicago/dp/B00005JLSE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chicago</a>&nbsp;was successful because he regaled in a pulp fiction element that complemented a familiar set of songs. This time, the filmmaker is burdened by an only so-so score and a stubbornly introspective story that refuses to inspire in a too-literate adaptation of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1982-Broadway-musical-hit/dp/B0000996FQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1982 Broadway musical hit</a>&nbsp;by Michael Tolkin and the late Anthony Minghella. If Marshall heightened the surrealism going on in his narcissistic protagonist's head, it could have worked more effectively, but the musical numbers feel particularly stage-bound for an endeavor ironically dedicated to the joys of cinema.

Following the same structure as its inspiration, Federico Fellini's classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/8-1-2/dp/B00005QAPH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">8 1/2</a>, the story centers on Guido Contini, a Fellini-esque director revered in mid-1960s Italy. Apparently, he is suffering from an extreme case of creative block with his latest and ninth screen project. There is a press conference to announce the production ambitiously entitled ""Italia"", even though there is nary a word written and only his muse attached, international screen star Claudia Jenssen. The pressure of making a landmark film takes its toll on Contini who attempts to escape to a luxurious spa resort. Inevitably, the entire production follows him to the hotel, including his devoted costume designer Lilli who knows him better than he knows himself. His sexy, neurotic mistress Carla also shows up, as does his long-suffering wife Luisa. Further complications ensue when Stephanie, an adoring Vogue journalist, expresses her prurient interest in the tortured filmmaker. Fantasy and memory cloud Contini's mind as he flashes back to memories of his mother and Saraghina, a prostitute he recalls dancing erotically on the beach when he was nine.

It's a rare enough treat to see the chameleonic Daniel Day-Lewis onscreen, and he plays Contini with the right level of Mastroianni-like wariness. He even sings his two pensive numbers - ""Guido's Song"" and ""I Can't Make This Movie"" - more than capably. However, it is the women who really share the spotlight. Looking luminous with a touch of Audrey, Marion Cotillard (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/La-Vie-en-Rose/dp/B00005JPX8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">La Vie en Rose</a>) brings depth and poignancy to the standard role of the put-upon wife. She sings two dramatically different numbers, the touching ""My Husband Makes Movies"" and the passionately naked ""Take It All"". In a role that complements her persona in a similar manner to what Woody Allen did for her in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vicky-Cristina-Barcelona/dp/B001DJ7PR8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vicky Cristina Barcelona</a>, Penlope Cruz brings sizzling gusto to her solo number, ""A Call to the Vatican"", all the while exposing her character's spiraling emotional desperation. As shrewdly observant Lilli, Judi Dench provides the film with much-needed grounding and has a good time with the campy burlesque number, ""Folies Bergre"".

The rest of the cast packs punch but ultimately feels more extraneous. Kate Hudson has little to do as Stephanie except act appropriately saucy and then unexpectedly dazzle with the go-go-salsa-driven ""Cinema Italiano"". Nicole Kidman looks every inch a screen star as Claudia, but sadly, her sweet rendition of the show's most touching ballad, ""Unusual Way"", is broken up by snatches of dialogue. It's wonderful to see the still-stunning, 75-year-old Sophia Loren as Contini's mother, but her role is little more than a cameo. Marshall gives the most ""Chicago""-like production number to Fergie (of the Black-Eyed Peas) who dominates a chorus of voluptuous beauties on ""Be Italian"". In fact, there is so much talent onscreen, one keeps hoping for a big final production number instead of the fantasy curtain call presented. Regardless, Marshall wisely reassembles the same production team he used on both&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chicago/dp/B00005JLSE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chicago</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Memoirs-of-a-Geisha/dp/B000EHRVMY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Memoirs of a Geisha</a>&nbsp;- John Myhre's production design, Dion Beebe's cinematography (a little too heavy on the use of shadows), and Colleen Atwood's costumes are all first-rate.

3572582,5,B001FB55OE,"BRILLIANT STAGE TO SCREEN - FINALLY - MUSICAL VERSION OF FELLINI'S ""8 1/2"" [with due respect to Bob Fosse's masterpiece -""ALL THAT JAZZ""]

ROB MARSHALL who brought us ""CHICAGO"" a few years ago now absolutely dazzles with this homage to Felllini's genius as well as giving us a rich, layered semi-sweet tiramisu.

OSCARS?  Going to be very difficult since most of the cast either has one or a couple and the others are either nominees or will be nominees [Fergie - Wow! This girl will blow you away?  Stunning - absolutely Stunning]

Not a sour note - standouts?

MARION CLOTILARD [who could easily morph into the actual Signora Fellini - Guiletta Masina] ~ Mme. Clotilard shows moments we have just not seen before - what an extraordinary artist from that simple little modest black dress into the stunning stripper bearing all.  GOLDEN GLOBE NOMINEE - this artist deserves continued and continuous success - One cannot take one's eyes from her when she's on screen - everyone else pales and diminishes when Marion is on screen - just her eyes alone speak volumes.

OK - JUST WHY WAS THIS ARTIST NOT NOMINATED?????

Another standout is naturally Penelope Cruz - also moments we have just not seen on screen before - another exceptionally versatile  actress.  GOLDEN GLOBE NOMINEE

BRAVO - PENI ON YOUR NOM.

The rest?  Judi Dench, Kate Hudson, Nicole Kidman [morphing movie goddess Anita Ekberg stunningly], and those lovely leggy ensemble dancers!

Crowning all of this is the eternal SOPHIA LOREN - looking even more beautiful than ever - FOREVER MAY SHE REIGN - and the mesmerizing DANIEL DAY LEWIS as the tortured Guido [how different from ""There Will Be Blood"" and ""The Gangs of New York""].  ALSO A GOLDEN GLOBE NOD TO MR. DAY LEWIS - EXCELLENT!

SETS, COSTUMES [with the incomperable Colleen Atwood at the helm - who can miss - Ms. Atwood's choices and end-results are always impeccable - another Oscar winner!], CINEMATOGRAPHY - FLAWLESS.

Must mention the wonderful ""turn"" by Kate Hudson - another artist who never disappoints.

This movie is just full of so many exquisite moments taken from Fellini and lovingly recreated by Rob Marshall and his team.

NOT TO BE MISSED - DESTINED TO BECOME A CLASSIC.

Let's also take time to remember the ever-missed Raul Julia and the enchanting Anita Morris - who were/are indelible in the original Broadway Production.

SEE THIS MASTERPIECE ON THE BIG SCREEN - NOW!!!!!

Nine (MUSICAL!!) is the story of Italian filmmaker Guido Contini (Daniel Day-Lewis), who is down on his luck and hasn't had success in his career in a while. All of his fans refer to his ""old films"" as being the best. Depressed and lost, he revisits the nine women in his life that are his muses and guides in his film career, although many never saw themselves as anything but a woman in his life. It stars so many brilliant actresses (No particular order: Nicole Kidman, Marion Cotillard, Penlope Cruz, Judi Dench, Sophia Loren, Kate Hudson, Stacey Ferguson (Fergie from the Black Eyed Peas). This movie is not your typical musical, because it goes from one amazing woman to the next, with one song each (Cotillard happens to sing twice) and he moves along, trying to find the inspiration for his masterpiece. So brilliantly acted by the entire cast, Nine should be entered into the books as one of the most unique, beautifully-done movie musicals of all time!",1487030400,3,1075,4.748663101604278

3572906,4,B001FB55OE,"Nine is full of surprises but the film is a screen adaptation of a musical production. I haven't seen the actual musical production. After Chicago, Rob Marshall swings and succeeds in adapting another musical to success, accolades, and honors. With an amazing cast including Sir Daniel Day Lewis as Italian film director Guido Contini, he does capture the role of an Italian casanova director with a wife, mistress, and love for women. His mother is played by the ageless Sophia Loren (she is sorely underused but a delight to see onscreen). His costume designer and confidante Lilly is played by the legendary Dame Judi Dench who can surprisingly sing well especially her number ""Folie Bergeres"" number. I love her hairstyle that it complements her well. Oscar winner Marion Cotillard holds her own as his long suffering wife, Louise. Oscar winner Penelope Cruz plays his mistress. There are other notable performers such as Oscar nominee Kate Hudson in her ""Cinema Italiano"" number and Fergy's ""Italia.""

Rob Marshall adds a lot of dancing to support the film's weak plot about Guido's next film. I believe the musical was inspired by Fellini's movie, ""8 1/2,"" but I'm not a 100% sure. The filming is first rate with great costumes, dancing, and glamour in 1964 Italy. The first rate cast and crew is poorly served with a weak script. Daniel Day Lewis can play anybody including Guido with brilliance but it's not one of his best roles on film. At least, everybody in the cast appear happy and enjoying themselves.

The DVD comes with extra previews; three music videos with Marion Cotillard, Kate Hudson, and Fergy's videos only; the choreography behind the scenes of ""Italia"" and ""Cinema Italiano."" I wished the DVD included how the story came from the musical production to the film production. Rob Marshall earned plenty of acceptable accolades for this film. ""Nine"" is no ""Chicago"" but it holds their own. Whether I missed something in the film, I'll never know since I never saw the stage production.

Oscar winner Rob Marshall does faithfully adapt the story to the film without losing it's charm. When he did ""Chicago,"" he kept the story faithful to the movie version than the stage version. He does the same here with a terrific cast but I felt Kate Hudson was miscast in the role as the American in Rome. I barely know Fergie who plays a beach prostitute from Guido's childhood. A tribute to Sophia Loren should have been included on this DVD. She's still ageless.",1435104000,,2476,4.876484560570071

And Maury Yeston thought so too. The film is a bit less than wonderful, because Rob Marshall seemed to miss the point, but it has some really terrific moments. The title 'Nine' not only refers to the ninth film Contini is trying to make, but the emotional age of the young Contini who grows up confused by the double standard attitudes of the Catholic Church towards sex. His emotional development has stopped at the age of 'Nine'. Rob Marshall didn't make that clear enough.

3573004,2,B001FB55OE,"8  is one of the masterpieces of 1960s Italian cinema.  His final film in black and white, 8 1/2 may have been the peak of Fellinis career.  It contains one iconic scene after another and is consistently rated among the top films of all time.  I remember being very skeptical when the Broadway musical was announced.  However, I went to see it at an early preview and was enthralled by Tommy Tunes dazzlingly theatrical reimagining of Fellinis film.  I became a big fan of the musical version, which was rather cleverly titled Nine.  Which way does one go with a film version of the musical, given the original source film was purely cinematic and the stage musical was purely theatrical?  Director Rob Marshall (Chicago) tries to have it both ways by allowing his cast to give big theatrical performances of the songs, which he then kaleidoscopically intercuts with footage of other scenes.  The effect is just tedious.  A couple of songs have been replaced by inferior ones and some of the lyrics have been changed.  The script of the original film has been watered down to the level of pretentious soap opera.  The opening of the film has some thrilling moments, but ends with a thud.  Things go downhill from there.  A major problem is casting.  I love Daniel Day Lewis.  I think hes a great actor.  He is simply NOT Italian.  His Italian accent is completely off and his basic range doesnt extend in that direction.  This is not good for a show whose signature song is called Be Italian.  (I wonder if Italian pop star Claudio Baglioni was even considered.  He might have been great.)  The other roles are not very well cast either.  The beautiful Marion Cotilliard is a bit young for her role as the neglected wife who repeatedly sings about long ago.  The iconic Sophia Loren throws the whole movie out-of-kilter on sheer star power.  Can one seriously put Sophia in a thankless cameo role?  I love Judi Dench and its great to have her show her considerable musical comedy chops (she was Sally Bowles in the London CABARET back in 1967), but she is in no way Continental European.  In the scenes she has with Day Lewis, they come off like James Bond and M.  Penelope Cruz is preposterous in many of her films (e.g. Corellis Mandolin), but this performance is virtually unwatchable.  Nicole Kidman is no Claudia Cardinale and I have no idea what Kate Hudson was doing in this movie.  Her Dallas-Cowboy-Cheerleaders-in-Vegas number had nothing to do with anything and she has no real personality and is rather ordinary-looking to boot (especially in this company).  Fergie has a good voice, but her casting as Saraghina, the chubby child-flasher, is simply a different character.  Despite singing, Be Italian, she aint no Italian, either.  I wouldnt recommend buying a ticket for this movie, but die-hard musical comedy fans will probably want a copy anyway.  Art direction, costumes, and photography are all top-notch.  The DVD quality is excellent and the sale price is irresistible.",1413763200,,2990,4.807465618860511

3573010,3,B001FB55OE,"Daniel Day-Lewis emerges in his first film role since winning his second Oscar for There Will Be Blood
(2007) to portray Guido Contini, an Italian filmmaker circa 1965 who is struggling with his personal
relationships and directing a film in just days with only one problem: he has not yet written the script.
But there is one flaw in this film that prevents a glowing review: and that is a good number of the songs.
Some of them leave you wondering just how much time they spent on lyrics. Marion Cotillard, who won the
Academy Award last year for her role of the French icon, Edit Piaf in the film La Mome, played the part of
Guidos wife, Luisa, but her song was uninspired. The same is true for Penelope Cruzs song as Guidos
mistress.
Still, two songs are definitely worth the price of admission. Judy Dench, whose had a long and wonderful
acting career but most people will only know her as M in the new James Bond films (sorry to say), plays
Continis costume designer. Her song is a treat on the eye. But nobody steals the show like Fergie. Her son,
Be Italian, is the show stopper. We just wish there were more show stoppers.
There is no way you can help but compare Nine to Rob Marshalls hit musical film, Chicago. But dont.
Yes, its easy because he employs many of the same techniques he perfected in Chicago here. But theres
no comparison. In Chicago, each song was more than simply a character studythey moved the plot long
and embodied the interpersonal relationships between the characters. All while keeping you happily
entertained by outstanding score and unmatched lyricism. The soundtrack of Chicago tells the story on its
own with no need for the images from the film. You fall in love not only with each song but the winding of
songs into a story. Nine simply doesnt compare.
If you like musicals, and if you're in the mood to see a spectacle of color and dancing, see this film. Or see it
if you're simply nostalgic to see a figure like Sophia Loren back on the big screen (and you don't mind that
screen to be shared with Nicole Kidman in a role not meant for her). If you're hungry for another success
such as Chicago, then go see Chicago again but then go see this film.",1408406400,,2192,4.468827930174563

3573067,5,B001FB55OE,"DDL is one of our most talented and gifted actors, in my opinion.  I admire his performance in NINE, totally making the role his...via his choice of using the METHOD form of preparation for all of his parts.  He truly created his own unique interpretation of his character.  His performance is brilliant!
Also, the number led by Fergie, is fantastic!!  BE ITALIAN will stay with me forever!  The number is sexy, sensual, raw, full of emotion, and all of the dancers/singers did a fabulous job!!
I want to acknowledge a truly MAGNIFICENT rendition of a song entitled UNUSUAL WAY...performed so beautifully by vocalist, GRIFFITH FRANK.  This music video can be found under the heading of Special Features...then just click on Music Videos, and you will find UNUSUAL WAY.  Mr. G. Frank sings with a fresh voice, adding meaning to all the lyrics of this powerful song.
I did a search on AMAZON and found no audio CD recorded by this most talented artist.  For a brief moment, I recognized his face checking out if there were any MP3 downloads from Griffith Frank.  The title of the MP3 download song performed by Griffith Frank is entitled ROMANCE.  In checking in with a Customer Representative, via telephone....THANK YOU AMAZON for providing a telephone number for GREAT Customer Service...1-866-216-1072, valid for U.S. customers.  Sorry, I don't know if this number is valid for any other countries.
If you want a Terrific and Fun Musical, with a stellar cast, I HIGHLY RECCOMEND Nine as a great choice.  By the way, Daniel day-Lewis did all of his acrobatic moves, including walking across a very high plank of a long piece of narrow wood, with NO net, etc. to catch him, if he fell, which he didn't.
If you are interested in that MP3 download of the song ROMANCE, sung by GRIFFITH FRANK....a customer service representative at AMAZON, informed me that it is presently not in stock.  I am hoping that other people who have heard GRIFFITH FRANK sing, will call AMAZON and put in a request that they re-stock the song ROMANCE...ASAP!
There is nothing like discovering a talented vocalist that sings with his Heart and Soul....before he becomes famous.  He is young, talented and hungry.  A fantastic combination to discover a wonderful singer before fame sweeps him into another world.  Please enjoy this film!  It is worth it!  And, if you like Griffith Frank's voice singing UNUSUAL WAY, please call AMAZON and ask them to restock the MP3 download of ROMANCE.
And, of course...the heart of the film...BE ITALIAN!!!  Bravo to everyone involved in this uplifting and joyous film!  05/16/14",1400198400,,2589,4.894495412844036

But, it is not for everyone.  ""Nine"" is very European, and probably too sophisticated for most of the American audience these days. For those of us who were adults during the Fellini, Mastroianni era, it provides a microcosm of the Italian movie industry of that time. The performances of the big musical numbers (who knew Fergie had it in her??) are alone worth watching the film. Marion Cotillard breaks your heart, showing how devastating it can be to love a man such as Guido. Daniel Day-Lewis delivers his usual ""spot-on"" performance as the tortured and lost Guido Contini, and, of course, the ageless, gorgeous Sophia Loren needs no description. I would also recommend the 11-minute companion film ""The Women of Nine"" in which Rob Marshall talks about making the film, and all the stars talk about what an extraordinary experience it was to be in it.

Exquisitely shot and vividly color graded, NINE pays tribute to the heady days of Italian cinema.  It's a simple story about Guido the auteur and director, his existential mid-life crisis and catharsis...and of course, the women in his life.

This is not a movie you watch to analyse for either music or plot.  Some people obviously don't get the vibe, and that's understandable.  This is a textbook example for how to make a visually stunning film, layered with nuances.  The lighting, cinematography and art direction (for which it earned an Oscar nomination) truly stand out.

I was actually amazed that film like that could be funded and made in this day and age - by the Weinstein brothers no less - for a reported $ 80 million!

So a monument to excess - or a celebration of the romance and beauty of cinema?  I'd say the latter. NINE was never going to be a box office smash, but more of a showcase of art.  Kudos to Director Rob Marshall who really does know what he's doing here.  And watch it for the stellar cast who bring themselves completely to the role and enjoy themselves thoroughly.

There are so many wonderful actors cast and, for some reason, almost none of them seem to deliver.  The only exception is Marion Cotillard, who is far to good for the material she's been given.  The worst thing of all, however, is that, despite the film being a musical, almost none of the actors can carry a tune.  It's almost embarrassing how bad some of the musical numbers are.  Once again, Marion Cotillard is one of the only exceptions, along with Nicole Kidman (who has maybe fifteen minutes total screen time... what a waste) and Fergie, who brings some serious musical chops to her five or so minutes on screen.

Assuming this was a musical -- was it? -- I doubt there has ever been one with such non-catchy songs: banal music, grade-school lyrics. If ever a musical could use a huge shot of Steven Soundheim this is it. Leonard Bernstein wouldn't hurt either.

Marion Cotillard gives another great performance and Penelope Cruz spends the majority of her time on screen in a sexy corset and garters, which explains the Oscar nomination.

3573339,3,B001FB55OE,"Years ago I saw the musical ""Nine"" on Broadway with Raul Julia and found it only intermittingly entertaining. It was inspired by the Italian director Federico Fellini who had made the groundbreaking film ""8 ."" The 1963 movie portrayed the directorial master trying to come up with a new project. The movie ""Nine"" explores the same territory with a very famous director, Guido Contini, trying to get ideas for his next movie. It involves fantasies, his loves over the years, and his desperation.
It's too much of the same thing, and the movie's absorption with Guido gets very boring, and it's way too intense. You know what? As a movie viewer I cared less and less about him. He was not a figure that could engage me, get my emotional involvement. I could care less about his plight. A rich, pampered, celebrated hedonist who inspires no empathy. A movie benefits when it engages the audience's sympathy.
The film is too long. Perhaps they would have better off making ""4 1/2"" It features nine girls, and some of them get lost in the shuffle. After a while, the viewer begins a countdown, hoping that not all of them have to be given a song. The songwriters contributed four new numbers to this outing. The Broadway musical had seventeen numbers; this has twelve.
There are dream sequences, fantasy, lush, lavish and luxurious settings, but the protagonist and movie remain cold to the touch for the most part. There's little or no humor in the movie.
It's a completely new departure in roles for Daniel Day-Lewis, and he may have not been the best choice for the part. Top writers, Kopit and Minghella, were involved in ""Nine.""  Penelope Cruz, Judi Dench, Nicole Kidman, Marion Cotillard, Kate Hudson and Sophia Loren are among the women involved. Loren plays the mother, but she didn't make much of impression on me. I particularly liked Judi Dench as the fashion designer who performed the Folies Bergere number. She thankfully has a large role in the film. I loved her wry expressions.
The director, Guido, is pursued by the paparazzi like a rock star. He's made some great movies, but now he's having writer's aridity and is going through an agonizing life crisis (agonizing for him, but why does the audience have to share all of its intensity?)",1297123200,,2251,4.771794871794872

3573341,3,B001FB55OE,"`Nine' is one of those films that looked awesome from the trailer and then felt slightly anti-climatic by the time the credits roll.

Featuring an incredible cast this follows a renowned Italian director as he struggle to make his next film and it also focuses on the various women in his life, from his mother, wife, mistress, film starlets, friends and admirers. The drama is inter-cut with musical numbers, which are actually quite good and liven up a rather staid and uninspiring plot.

Day-Lewis is great to watch as ever and Dench is great as his friend, but Marion Cottilard, as his wife, is superb and is the strongest part of the film. Apart from the beauty factor the other actresses add, they don't bring a great deal else to the film.

You can tell this has been adapted from a theatre show (by the same team that brought us `Chicago') and some scenes are shot and framed in a very stage orientated way. I actually enjoyed this aspect and felt it added to, rather than detracted from, the overall feel.

All in all, this is a decent enough film and whilst the trailer makes you expect more and the cast are sorely underused, this still has enough to hold your interest for the duration. Not one to rush to see, but worth a viewing if it's on TV or at a bargain price on Amazon.

the musical number and their production values are amazing. Other than the cast's musicals numbers, they seem like they have nothing to do

This film reminds me more of All That Jazz that 8 1/2 which the musical is based upon. Joe Gideon has nore meat on the chracters bones that guido does. Lewis tries to bring life to Guido, but he seems like he is going thru the motions

I rating four stars because of the musical numbers.there production values remind me of old hollywood musicals.if they chucked the stories and just kept the numbers, it would make a great movie

Then I shucked that image and slipped inside the story and saw what it is about....

A man, a user of women, of his own talent in order to create a film, a perfect film to entertain, to remind audiences of their human frailty, triumphs, goodness, and badness. All that time he lives a life writ large, the life of a bohemian of ethics, a breaker of moral codes. All for what? His own satisfaction of needs and addictions which feed his gift.

Then unfortunately, but ultimately beneficially, he reaches his breaking point. Not all humans do. Usually, they continue the path of destruction, wantonness, illicit activities until they die. Guido Contini (played by Daniel Day-Lewis with powerful intensity) is haunted by images of women in song as they reflect/project his internal turmoil.

At the end with losses abounding, Guido withdraws from the film and spends two years pondering his life, past and future. We see how it will go. The intensity has changed focus...

I loved this film. I was surprised. Although the film ends with no movie, the irony is that there IS a movie filled with powerful song and dance numbers by the women in his life. Clever. Kate Hudson is fantastic in the showstopper number: a flirt praising the slickness, the fashion mastery of his films. Judi Dench, his long-time costumer, sings the praises of the Folies Bergere. Stunning! Whoda thought?

Others: Fergie is absolutely a sultry temptress as the prostitute living on the beach in Guido's childhood memory, then dancing with others in a most rousing number! Marion Cotillard is brilliant as his long-suffering, forgiving wife who also reaches her breaking point, although her break is a different kind. Penelope Cruz performs gymnastic moves as a tease of what further she can do to please this director. Even Day-Lewis sings his woes, of course, convincingly.

I normally don't summarize acts in a musical, but wanted this time to call attention to the ones that most signify key aspects of Guido's life (and also entertain). (I cannot emphasize enough how much I enjoyed Hudson's glamorous, glitzy number!)

A play is meant to entertain, inform, educate, and ultimately cause dialogue amongst viewers. What is the meaning of a creative person's life? Is he allowed to hurt others in satisfying what he needs in order to create? What happens when he reaches that proverbial blank wall, writer's block? How long can he play avoidance? ""Nine"" answers these questions satisfactorily (for this viewer) with the nine ""monologues"" of the seven significant women in his life and two of his own. In ""seeing"" their stories, he sees a reflection of himself and--finally--sees himself for what he is.",1294790400,3,2947,5.270788912579957

I am a huge fan of Daniel Day Lewis. In fact, I just watched 'There Will Be Blood' again, the other day. He is splendid in this movie. So different but equally well acted. A genre that is difficult to do well, and isn't exactly a crowd favourite anymore.

My two favourite musical scenes belong to Fergie and Marion Cotillard. The scene with Ms. Cotillard and Mr Lewis.......very well done. You can feel the anguish in both characters so strongly.

Those of us who saw it on Broadway with Raul Julia and/or Antonio Banderas know what this musical should be like.  Over HALF of the songs are missing.  Lots of confusing photography, filming it like an MTV video with everyone getting their star turn and song. Awful.  Penelope Cruz's number, which was so sensual with Anita Morris and Jane Krakowski looked bland.  First of all they have Cruz dressed in a tart like outfit from an underwear catelogue. Morris wore a black sequined body suit, Krakowski wore a flesh colored one with sequins.  On Broadway Krakowski slithers down a silk cocoon upside down and sings A Call from the Vatican.  The image is like the snake crawling down a vine in the Garden of Eden seducing the prey.  It was a show stopper every night. Same thing when Morris did it in 1982.  Cruz swings some ropes around and looks like she is going to trip, not sexy at all.  I have tried to watch Nine on cable or on DVD rental and each time I either fell asleep or just stopped it.  So frenetic that the thread is lost.  It is a personal show about a man's struggle to come to grips with his life.  Both times on Broadway the sets were simple, featuring instead the story, songs and performances.  Go see the show if it tours near you instead.",1293408000,2,1414,4.426356589147287

Without going into morbid detail, I believe when you have a piece that is so theatrical, transfering to the screen is a losing battle.  The thrill of ""Nine"" on the stage was Tommy Tune's masterful direction and choreography and the perfect cast.  The plot took a back seat.

Daniel Day Lewis plays an Italian director. This is a farce. Lewis speaks English with a horridly bad Italian accent throughout. Not credible. The whole film is in English. Also a farce. Italy is not England. Italian is not translated English. So, basically, I have no idea what this film is supposed to be about. Why does Judy Dench speak the Queen's English, and others do not? The only Italian woman in the film was Sophia Loren, and she spoke English. Aussie actor Nicole Kidman trying to be Italian was ludicrous.

Throwaway songs from the stage show were cut and at least one new song made an improvement (Luisa's song#2). When the credits rolled, I was hoping there would be some reference to Fellini and his film, but there was nothing; perhaps it concerned legalities. I viewed both films back-to-back (not a bad way to spend an afternoon). Nine lifts entire scenes and dialogue from 8 1/2: Carla arriving at the train station and being whisked off to the pensione and then telling Guido her dream of her husband discovering the 2 of them and killing them; the whole bit with Luisa having to sit through the screen tests; even Sereghina's bombshelter abode on the beach is practically the same in both movies.
 If you've never seen the Fellini film or the Broadway show, I don't know if much of the set-up of the film would make sense, but the songs, performances and staging are all done very well.

A very unmusical musical - there is literally not a single memorable song in its 2 hour running time - this film wastes the considerable talents of its all-star cast (best is Marion Cotillard, who generates considerable warmth in an otherwise cold, synthetic film) with a story so indifferent and a leading man so completely devoid of sympathy or interest, I was reduced to fast-forwarding my way through the second hour, which I almost never do. There wasn't even any good dancing to rouse interest, as it was all done in chop-chop MTV style - very disturbing in a musical that boasts a director who is a Tony-nominated choreographer.

Marion Cotillard's poignant rendering of ""My Husband Makes Movies"" resonates with longing and sadness and is done quite well. The choreography is energetic and unique, the music is well-arranged, and the direction is wonderful (much like Chicago).

So why did Nine receive less than favorable reviews and didn't do well at the box office? Answer: Daniel Day-Lewis. The decision to cast the lead actor for 'Nine' is a crucial one since he sets the tone for the entire movie. Day-Lewis is one of the finest actors of all-time, but this is evidence that credentials can be irrelevant when it comes to casting. Day-Lewis was much too intense even in the lightest moments.

3573505,4,B001FB55OE,"""Nine"" has taken the same circuitous route to the big screen as ""The Producers"" did a few years back.  First, it started out life as a beloved movie - in this case, Fellini's classic 1963 ""8 "" - then got itself reincarnated in the form of a Broadway musical (undergoing a name change in the process); finally it got adapted back into a movie by the trusty hands of Hollywood, much to the consternation, apparently, of most of the nation's film critics.

The original movie was a phantasmagoric blending of memory, reality and wish-fulfillment fantasy, focused on a major Italian film director caught in creative crisis (a figure obviously based on Fellini himself).  Daniel Day-Lewis takes on the role, made famous by Marcello Mastroianni, of the filmmaker (now named Guido Contini) who ""has nothing left to say"" - either as a man or as an artist - a man so harried and hounded by producers, subordinates, reporters, detractors, sycophants, and assorted hangers-on that he sneaks away for a rest-cure at an out-of-the-way health spa.  With all his creative juices dried up and feeling that he will have a nervous breakdown if he has to make even one more statement or executive decision regarding his film, Guido, like many of us, believes he will find the peace he so desperately yearns for by retreating from the outside world.  But Guido soon discovers that there is no escaping from the people and pressures of the world in which we live - nor from our religious and familial upbringing - for they are each of them an integral part of the fabric that makes us who we are.

Visually, ""Nine"" captures all the flash, dash and excitement of life among the glitterati in the Eternal City circa 1965.  In terms of plot and incident, the Michael Tolkin/Anthony Minghella screenplay (itself derived from Arthur Kopit's Broadway adaptation) follows the original fairly closely, but what's missing is the spark of cinematic genius that Fellini alone could bring to the material.  But can one reasonably have expected that, anyway?  As a director, Rob Marshall does an impressive job re-staging the dramatic portions, but he certainly doesn't have Fellini's flair for the carnival-like atmosphere for which the maestro is justly famous (but, then again, who does?).  However, as with ""Chicago,"" Marshall demonstrates that he knows how to slide in and out of the musical numbers without being unduly jarring about it.  That`s particularly challenging given that most of the numbers - which serve as reflections of the characters' thoughts and feelings and the movie's themes - are done largely on surrealistic soundstages, as opposed to the on-location filming of the non-musical portions of the movie.

No surprise, Day-Lewis is superb as the dashing but world-weary director (truly as much a celebrity as an artist), perfectly capturing the angst, frustration and conflict taking place deep within the soul of a creator who still has so much to say - despite his protestations to the contrary - but not the slightest clue of how to say it.  Guido is clearly trying to be a good person, but all those inner demons are doing their best to thwart him at virtually every turn.  There are many moving moments of deep introspection, as Guido contemplates the direction of his life and the effect his actions are having on the people he loves.  I'm going to go out on a limb here, and it may sound like blasphemy even to say this, but Day-Lewis lets us see his character's pain in a way that even Mastroianni himself did not.  Interestingly, by tamping down some of Fellini's cinematic ""distancing devices"" and icy-cool tone, the movie actually allows us to relate with Guido on a more personal level and to care more deeply about his plight.

Marion Cotillard replaces Anouk Aimee as Guido's devoted but longsuffering wife who knows about her husband's infidelity and who suspects he has become a filmmaker as a means both of avoiding having to deal with real life and of achieving personal forgiveness and redemption for himself; Penelope Cruz stars as Guido's flighty mistress, whose sudden appearance at the spa throws Guido's world into a tizzy; and Sophia Loren puts in an occasional appearance as Guido's recently deceased mother who gives him words of advice and comfort from beyond the grave.  Nicole Kidman portrays Claudia, the beautiful young starlet who loves Guido but ultimately refuses to be just another of his numerous ""conquests.""  Judi Dench plays the fashion designer who appears to be the one level-headed and brutally honest person whom Guido can turn to for advice and support.  And all of them are excellent.

One thing that ""Nine"" has going for it that ""8 "" didn't is the perspective that comes with the passage of time.  When the original was released, it WAS ""Italian Cinema"" - and everything that went along with that term.  As a result, the movie was totally unconscious of itself and the place it and other films of its time period would occupy in movie history.  ""Nine,"" with the ability to look back on the era from a much later perspective, is able to convey all this in a way that those earlier films, including ""8 "" itself, could not.  In this sense, ""Nine"" sees ""8 "" more as an artifact than as the contemporary trailblazer it was in its time.

As with all remakes and ""re-imaginings"" of classic works, we must finally ask ourselves the crucial question:  ""Is this trip really necessary?""  I think in the case of ""Nine,"" I will have to go with ""Yes""  - or, if not ""necessary,"" at least audacious and stimulating.  ""8 "" aficionados and Fellini purists may have trouble warming up to this version, but I see it not as a denigration of the master and his great work, but as a tribute to them.",1278806400,,5713,4.811860940695296

3573509,3,B001FB55OE,"So, reading the main review of this movie, I have to ask...what's wrong with slutty underwear?

This movie goes beyond mere underwear, however. As I saw it, the women are slutty because they're seen through the conflicted eyes of the main character. That's what he sees in women, and that emptiness is at the heart of why his genius has abandoned him. Because his view of women is so shallow, his own masculinity is likewise empty. Contrasting such a hollow life with the rich, colorful, passionate time of early 1960's Italy, the main character's emptiness is even more stark. The story explores his collapse, as there is nothing left to sustain him, and his eventual reawakening to life. By the end of the movie, the women appear less slutty and more human.

I found the musical numbers to be well written, choreographed and performed. Unlike the main reviewer, I thoroughly enjoyed the film. Sophia Loren looks a bit of a fright, but her warm, regal, sensual nature still shines through, more powerful than all the younger women combined. The fact that her character is a ghost might have something to do with her appearance. Still, wow.

3573510,2,B001FB55OE,"The main issue that I have with Rob Marshall's Nine is that there really seems to be no heart and soul in it. The story is there, but nothing is really done with it. Stars enter and exit, and there is never really any feeling in the characters, nor is there a single memorable song throughout the entire movie, aside from Fergie's ""Be Italian,"" which is actually kind of cool. The music and the songs are very bland and generic, and take away rather than add to the story and to the drama. Everytime song would begin, I would sigh in discomfort because I knew that the drama was going to be interrupted.

Daniel Day-Lewis is Guido Contini, a distinguished Italian film-director who has most recently released three flops, which seem to overshadow his previously applauded films earlier on in his career. The story deals with his struggles involving a new movie script, and with the many women in his life. He is asked early on at a press conference if he is out of ideas, a question which he puzzles and chews over throughout the duration of the movie. He is constantly hassled about the next script, but sees no reason why it is anybody's business, including his own.

The women in Guido's life are introduced as follows: his shy, modest wife Luisa (Marion Cotillard), his fiery mistress, Carla (Penelope Cruz), his costumes mistress Lilli (Judi Dench), his mamma (Sophia Loren), his muse, actress Claudia (Nicole Kidman), a reporter (Kate Hudson), and Saraghina, a mysterious woman from his childhood (Fergie). Of these actresses, Dench stands out the most as the sharp, pragmatic assistant, and each scene she shares with Day-Lewis is a delight. How could any scene shared by these two actors be anything less? I also enjoyed Loren's presence here, and to see a legend along side a legend is remarkable.

Cotillard does some fine work here as well, but she, like most everyone else besides Dench and Day-Lewis, never develops as much as she should. I don't see how this production could have worked well on stage, because the parts of the movie that I most enjoyed were between the songs, and even these scenes often became a bore. Nicole Kidman's part in particular is very slow and underdeveloped. This is the root of the problem: underdeveloped characters in an underdeveloped story stuffed forgettable songs that don't mesh well into the film as a whole. They feel sloppily attached with duct tape, while the actors scurry around, dancing and/or singing. There are some beautifully filmed sequences in black and white, involving Fergie's character, and I admired the potential. Unfortunately, this potential is never quite reached in any other way.

So underwhelming is the overall production, that about an hour in, I was squirming in my seat waiting for the end credits. Even the terrific performances of Day-Lewis and Dench couldn't manage to save this movie, and although I haven't yet seen Frederico Fellini's original movie 8 1/2, which the Broadway show Nine is based off of, I have a strong feeling that this adaptation of the stage adaptation of Fellini's acclaimed work has lost one or many important elements in translation. Everything that worked so well in Rob Marshall's Chicago is absent here, and the choppy, uneven, and disorganized Nine is a major musical misfire. (Pardon the alliteration).",1276905600,5,3316,4.905525846702317
3573511,4,B001FB55OE,"In 1973, ""Nine"" was but a dream for American composer Maury Yeston.  Before Yeston became the popular American composer and lyricist that he is right now, he was inspired by Director Frderico Fellini's ""8 1/2', about an Italian filmmaker who had writer's block in which the film would deal with his memories and flashbacks that were intermeshed onscreen.

After several attempts to having a book created, he joined with American playwright Arthur Kopit in 1981 as Yeston would write the music and lyrics while Kopit wrote the book and sure enough, by 1982, the Broadway play of ""Nine"" was born.

In a 1982 interview with Yeston in regards to how ""Nine"" relates to Fellini's ""8 1/2', Yeston said, ""When Fellini made 8 1/2 he already had done seven films and a documentary, so he called his next movie 8 1/2. I thought, if you add music, it's like half a number more.""  Fortunately, with the help of Katharine Hepburn who saw the original production, Hepburn contacted Fellini and Fellini granted Yeston the rights to write a fictional musical inspired by his film.

The musical was a huge success as it won five Tony Awards, ran for 729 performances and has had several revivals but it wasn't until 2009 when Director Rob Marshall (""Chicago"", ""Memoirs of a Geisha""), screenwriters Michael Tolkin (""Changing Lanes"", ""Deep Impact"", ""The Player"") and Anthony Minghella (""The Talented Mr. Ripley"", ""The English Patient"", ""Cold Mountain"") began writing the film adaptation of the musical and also bringing in Maury Yeston to write a few songs for the film.

For many people, Rob Marshall's success with ""Chicago"" was definitely going to bring people into the theaters but where ""Nine"" has literally struck gold is with its all-star talent.  ""Nine"" stars Daniel Day-Lewis (""Gangs of the New York"", ""The Last of the Mohicans"", ""The Unbearable Lightness of Being""); Marion Cotillard (""Contagion"", ""Public Enemies"", ""Taxi"" films); Penelope Cruz (""Broken Embraces"", ""Sahara"", ""Elegy""); Nicole Kidman (""Australia"", ""The Others"", ""Cold Mountain""); Judi Dench (""Quantum of Solace"", ""Pride & Prejudice"", ""007' films); Kate Hudson (""Bride Wars"", ""Raising Helen"", ""Almost Famous""); the Black Eyed Peas vocalist Stacey ""Fergie"" Ferguson; and legendary actress Sophia Lauren (""Matrimonio All'Italiana"", ""La Cicoiara"", ""I Girasoli"").

Despite the film receiving mixed reviews, ""Nine"" would be nominated for four Academy Awards which include ""Best Supporting Actress"" (Penelope Cruz), ""Best Art Direction"" (John Myhre, Gordon Sim), ""Best Costume Design"" (Colleen Atwood) and ""Best Original Song"" (""Take It All"" Music and Lyrics by Maury Yeston).

""Nine"" is a film that that takes place in the late '60s and revolves around famous director named Guido Contini (played by Daniel Day-Lewis).  As production of ""Italia"" is about to begin, he is having a mid-life crisis in which he is having problems balancing time with his wife Luisa (played by Marion Cotillard), his mistress Carla (played by Penelope Cruz) and many women that work for him or want some of his personal time such as his muse Claudia (played by Nicole Kidman), his costume designer Lilli (played by Judi Dench), American journalist Stephanie (played by Kate Hudson) and also imaginary dreams of his youth such as the prostitute Saraghina (played by Fergie) and his communication with his dead mother (played by Sophia Lauren).

With the press and his film crew thinking that everything is ready for Guido to start filming, the truth is that he hasn't even written one word for ""Italia"" at all.  Despite his writer's block, he is also dealing with the disintegration of his marriage life, knowing that his sexual promiscuity is starting to get the best of him and affecting his personal life and this man, who everyone thinks is so much in control, is really not.  Guido is lost and needs direction.

Using Fellini's ""8 1/2' as a source of inspiration for the film, certain aspects make it to the film as the case of fantasy and real-life are hard to distinguish in ""Nine"" until each layer of Guido Contini is slowly peeled away and in ""Nine"", the question is asked about what kind of man are we left with?  Through the life that this famous director is living now, what would truly consume him and who or what would become his priority?

VIDEO:

""Nine"" is presented in 2:40:1 Anamorphic Widescreen.  Let me first say that if you were deciding on the Blu-ray or DVD, this is one of those films that you would want to watch on Blu-ray.  Various scenes are just vibrant with color and for each musical number, there is a wonderful style to each that simply screams to be in HD.  But for the DVD, picture quality is still beautiful.

The cinematography by Dion Beebe is simply ravishing and what helps is the wonderful cuts used for the musical segments, so a big credit to editors Claire Simpson and Wyatt Smith.  It's hard to believe that the majority of the musical numbers takes place on one adjustable set (which you will see in the special features) but how each set was created, modified and enhancing the dancers and their choreography was fantastic.  Great art direction, production design and also costume design from Colleen Atwood.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

And when it comes to musicals, its simply about the music and the DVD is presented in English 5.1 Dolby Digital.  Again, this is a type of film that screams of HD and I recommend listening to a lossless audio track via Blu-ray but overall, the music and dialogue are clear.  Subtitles are in English and English SDH.

JUDGMENT CALL:

When there was word that director Rob Marshall would be working on his next musical, needless to say, people were excited to see if Marshall can recreate the magic that he brought onscreen with ""Chicago"".  So, when the word came out that he was bringing ""Nine"", the popular musical onscreen, many wondered if he could pull it off.  Meanwhile, new cinema fans were worried (and many who misunderstood) that Federico Fellini's ""8 1/2' would receive a remake.

It's important to let viewers know that the musical was inspired by ""8 1/2' which Fellini gave Maury Yeston approval for the musical version, while for the film adaptation, Maury gave Rob Marshall free reign to do what he can and what he wanted for the film.

What director Rob Marshall was able to create was a glamorous and strikingly beautiful film that showcases the talent of Daniel Day-Lewis who was fantastic!  Although playing an Italian director, Day-Lewis looks strikingly similar to French director Jean-Luc Godard but more amazing is that his performance is as remarkable as he has done in his previous films with the exception that in ""Nine"", the thespian shows off his vocals.  Who would of thought that Daniel Day-Lewis can sing?  Needless to say, he did a remarkable job.

But equally remarkable was Penelope Cruz.  Her musical performance was not just sexy but again, shows off her amazing talent as an actress.  And almost similar to her last films ""Los abrazos rotos"" (Broken Embraces) and ""Elegy"", she's able to make the character of a woman scorned, come alive.  It's one thing to portray her character of Carla with depth, but to transform to this sexual vamp during her musical segment and even titillate the horny Guido in their scene was enjoyable.

""Nine"" definitely features an all-star cast with Marion Cotillard, like Penelope Cruz, brings the emotional and musical aspect to full force onscreen where Penelope's Carla is the mistress, Cotillard's Luisa is the lonely wife and her transformation onscreen during her musical performance is also fantastic.  Other memorable moments include Stacy Ferguson (Black Eyed Peas vocalist ala Fergie) as the buxom beauty/prostitute Saraghina in one of the most memorable musical performances of the film singing ""Be Italian"".

As mentioned, the film does feature an all-star cast, and there is no doubt that Sophia Lauren's appearance brings style and a homage to the '60s for this film.  Judi Dench's Lilli brings the professionalism that compliments Day-Lewis's Guido and yes, Dench can sing as well!  Nicole Kidman's Claudia brings more of the sexual, classy Veronica Lake like character but unfortunately is lost among the more sexually charged performances of the film and Kate Hudson's Stephanie brings the American sexiness to the film but somehow, felt a bit out of place in terms of the context of the other performances in the film.

With some of the musical segments definitely standing out from the film, I give credit to the dancers and the set and costume designer for making these characters come alive, especially in choreography.  Amazing!  And most of all, credit to the cinematographer Dion Beebe (and the editors Claire Simpson and Wyatt Smith) for the beautiful cinematography and making sure each sequence was dazzling, simmering and delightful onscreen.

If there is one thing about ""Nine"", because of the multiple characters, the meshing of the flashbacks, Guido's dreamstate and reality, ""Nine"" does have a commonality with Fellini's ""8 1/2'.  Some may find the banality within the concept but the characters and their musical performance is what emerges out of the banal setting and brings some fervor towards the actual screenplay.

But a problem that Rob Marshall has probably found is the film's comparison to ""Chicago"".  The music of ""Chicago"" was literally songs that came from the soul of the character and works with the movie.  While ""Nine"", you find yourself not zeroing in on the lyrics but simply watching the sexiness on screen as Penelope Cruz and Fergie's characters demonstrating naughtiness.

There is no impact emotionally but more sexually.  If there was a character in which the music helps you feel the emotion and soul from the lyrics is through Luisa Contini's ""Take It All"" as a woman who has had enough as her soul has been sapped by Guido.  She is the only character who sings about how she is feeling while the others sing about how Guido is feeling.  And it's those stinging words that resonate in Guido's head.

So, I felt the musical numbers, while they look great on film, were quite uneven.  I may not be the musical erudite but I would imagine that the film is quite different from the actual musical and those who are familiar with the musical may share its disappointment of the film.

But there is something about ""Nine"" that attracts you to the film despite its shortcomings.  May it be the cinematography, the '60s glitz, the sexual innuendo or just seeing some of the talents on film giving a wonderful performance.  Needless to say, that by the end of the film, I was not disappointed at all by ""Nine"" and can easily say that I had fun watching this film.",1276646400,,13235,4.9407775768535265

Colorful yes but empty.  They redid the Broadway score and turned it into music for a cheap strip club.  I don't know what Lewis was doing but it was not acting.  He was just going around ""emoting"" all the time in a way that made him look silly.  Horrid accent as well.  I could not make it through this film.  I heard it was bad but figured I would give it a chance...nope...it is that bad.",1276560000,5,552,4.08411214953271

Who knew Kate Hudson could sing like that?

This film is a musical. It has a back story that is secondary to the performances. Don't get lost trying to find the meaning of life here. Sit back and enjoy. Go back to reality tomorrow.

The plot line was a little confused, simply because it was not clear this was going anywhere... however, I found the performances quite enjoyable, some of the song/dance numbers captivating enough to go back and see a second time, and my girl Kate Hudson leapt off the screen in a performance I never thought one might associate with her. Penelope Cruz heated up our living room, and I counted myself glad not to have any kids to wisk out of the room.

So, concluding my opinion, a fun movie and worth the rental (I bought mine), and worth a second viewing or more... but not for you if you need something more cerebral or soberly serious.",1275782400,,939,4.323863636363637

3573557,2,B001FB55OE,"""Nine"" contains one of the best modern musical scores, but unfortunately only about half of Maury Yeston's songs make it  into Rob Marshall's miscalculated adaptation of the stage show, which itself was based on Fellini's ""8 .""  The actors, including Daniel Day-Lewis, Marion Cotillard, and Penelope Cruz, are terrific, and the film is beautifully shot. The main problem lies in Marshall and writers Michael Tolkin and Anthony Minghella's mistakes in handling the material as a musical.

In Marshall's ""Chicago,"" the musical numbers were presented as the ""fantasies"" of Roxie Hart's vaudeville-obsessed dreams, and the conceit worked really well--- for THAT film and THAT musical. Unfortunately, the same musical numbers-as-fantasy device is employed here, and it simply doesn't work with this show.  ""Chicago"" is presented on stage as ""a musical vaudeville,"" in which the musical numbers exist in a deliberately ""staged"" form. The fantasy makes sense in the context of Roxie's dreams. Not so in ""Nine,"" where the musical numbers just exist organically within the drama, whether in flashback or in the present. In the film ""Nine,"" each number is presented as a fantasy--but why? The protagonist, flailing film director Guido Contini (Day-Lewis), has no reason to have ""musical"" fantasies--he's a film director.

This makes the film ""Nine"" less a musical, than a ""musical,"" in which the songs are not to be taken literally. It's as though Marshall feared audiences would not believe that the characters simply sing because they just DO, but felt the need to make it easier to accept by making the songs ""dream sequences."" Does not work at all--it undermines the drama of the story by abruptly shifting the tone, while also making it lose its integrity as a musical. It's a shame, too, because there is so much talent in this film. This would have worked a WHOLE lot better if more songs were retained and this was just presented as it is on stage--in which the characters sing, not because it's fantasy, but because it's a MUSICAL.",1275523200,2,2030,5.102409638554217

3573559,3,B001FB55OE,"Hollywood has produced hundreds of movies about men going thru a mid-life crisis; American Beauty, Falling Down, and Lost in Translation are some of the more famous examples.  Rarely does this story get transferred into a musical though, but I guess it had to be done sooner or later, and this is a fairly good, though not great rendition.  The story is simple enough; Daniel Day Lewis plays Guido, a famous Italian movie director on the down side of his career.  He has signed up to direct one last movie, though he has no script for it, and all the past mistakes of his life catch up to him in the run-up to the filming of his movie.  And this being Hollywood, all his past mistakes deal with women, most of them attractive.  The movie is then broken up into approximately 8 parts.  Each of the first 7 parts focuses on his relationship with a specific woman.  In the last part, he has moved past his mistakes and makes a movie about him moving past his mistakes.  Each part is anchored by a musical score, with the featured woman being the lead singer.  The movie's format is quite similar to Chicago, which is to be expected once you discover that the same person, Rob Marshall, made both movies.  The songs' lyrics and melodies are good, catchy, but not memorable.  The singing, however, is OK; even Fergie's performance was ho-hum.  Some of the musical pieces have the quality of a MTV video, see for example the lively performance by Kate Hudson's character.  My only beef with the movie is the use of mostly non-Italian women (i.e. Fergie, Nicole Kidman, Penelope Cruz, etc...) to play the roles of Italian women.  Hence the most authentic portrayal was Sophia Lauren's role of Guido's mother.  Overall, an entertaining two hours, though I would not bother watching it again.",1275350400,,1783,4.651757188498403
3573560,2,B001FB55OE,"""Nine"" was the broadway musical adaptation of Federico Fellini's ""8 1/2"" and was brilliantly directed by Tommy Tune. The show was notorious for not being audience friendly but the movie is audience hostile. Admittedly ""Nine"" is almost impossible to translate to the screen but so was ""Chicago"" and several years ago, Rob Marshall razzle-dazzled the world and ""Chicago"" even took home the Oscar for best picture. This time with ""Nine"" Mr Marshall not only trips, he stumbles and lurches and falls hard on his derrierre. What he has done is combine the black and white photography of the original movie with elements of the broadway musical and it doesn't work. Tommy Tune achieved the combination by having the entire set, even the floor set in white tile, while the actors were dressed in black. They couldn't do this for the movie, granted but the constant switching from black and white to color to black and white was annoying--also annoying was dropping 90% of the musical numbers and throwing in a couple of new songs that weren't very good.

Daniel Day-Lewis as Guido is played as a drowsy-eyed, slouching, chain-smoking and charm-free womanizer you wonder why all these gorgeous women are throwing themselves at him. And speaking of smoking the ENTIRE CAST chain-smokes to a point where it's beyond ridiculous.  I didn't check but it would seem a tobacco company must be one of the producers.

Penelope Cruz has a good time performing ""A Call From The Vatican"" but believe it or not, had the number been performed as in the broadway show the movie would have had to be rated R.

The best in the movie is Fergie and her ""Be Italian"" number is teriffic, and for this moment Mr Marshall gets off his derriere and stirs up some magic. This number also combines black and white with color but here it is used to its best advatage.  The scenes of young Guido and his class-mates chasing Fergie through the sand to the surf, filmed in black and white is close to the same scene in Fellini's original, albeit without the singing and tambourines.

The two star rating is for Fergie but the movie is slow, boring and an endless advertisement for cigarettes.",1275177600,2,2154,4.761394101876675

3573612,1,B001FB55OE,"I was so disappointed when I missed Nine in the movie theater. I have a huge soft spot for musicals and thought that the all star cast would make for an outstanding film. Boy was I wrong!! There is on word that can summarize this movie: BORING. With a cast that includes such actresses as Kate Hudson, Nicole Kidman, Judy Dench, and Penelope Cruz, one would think that the film would explode with action and fantastic acting. If this wasn't enough, the cast is led by the phenomenal Daniel Day Lewis and includes a musical appearance by Fergie. Yet, when all of these things are added together it proves to be a huge letdown and results in two hours of cinematic sludge.

The plot, if you can call it that, centers on the director Guido Contini and his various loves which range from his wife to his mistress, leading lady, and even the whore who gave him his first striptease. The characters aren't woven into the narrative. Instead, they are introduced, sing a song, and then are virtually removed from the film. Contini's wife has a bit more involvement as does his mistress, but the rest of the ladies are basically paraded through as a way to show Contini's philandering. A bit of a back story is tied together through flashbacks of Contini's childhood, but it does not add much to the plot or the understanding of his character. Even the songs seem lacking because they do not add anything to the plot. Instead, it feels like a concert in which each woman comes on stage to sing a song about her relationship with Contini and then is dismissed. With such powerhouse voices as Fergie, Penelope Cruz, and Nicole Kidman, I was expecting something more akin to Chicago or Moulin Rouge. But even their voices could not hold the film together. Eventually, I found myself wanting to fast forward the film to the songs only to be disappointed by their lack of emotion and impact on the audience.

Overall, I was clearly disappointed. The music was sub-par and the story wasn't compelling at all. The dancing was definitely exciting but overly sexual to the point that after three musical numbers, I felt like I was watching pornography. Sadly, Nine didn't even reach the least of my expectations.",1274313600,13,2194,4.666666666666667

3573614,4,B001FB55OE,"When Lilli de Fleur (Dame Judi Dench) complained that the Italian movies of the 60's were too existentialist, that ""love cannot be love without `le singing,'"" she may have very well been describing ""Nine,"" the musical adaptation of Federico Fellini's much revered ""8.""

Whereas Fellini's autobiographical masterpiece told a depressing tale of a burned out director trying to find his 8 film while juggling the women in his life, ""Nine"" instead tells a depressing tale of a burned out director trying to find his ninth film, while juggling the women in his life... with a little razzle-dazzle!

As the director of 2002's ""Chicago,"" Rob Marshall is no stranger to the musical genre, bringing to the film the same sensibilities that he had brought to his previous star-studded musical outing. Once again, the musical sides of the various characters come alive not through the literal song and dance, but through the same daydream motif that Marshall had previously used in ""Chicago"".

Using Fellini's picture as a framework, many elements from the original remain largely preserved, though the bittersweet relationships that guided the protagonist seem to have been under a magnifying glass, perhaps even sweetened, made more accessible and given that extra emotional hook for the audience, in the way that only musicals can.

Certainly, the caliber of stars that the picture brings may have something with it too. With Daniel Day-Lewis, Penelope Cruz, Sophia Loren and even Fergie to name a few, this veritable who's-who of Hollywood talent (ok, maybe not so much Fergie) truly elevates a dying genre with a surprising amount of dignity.

Unlike certain other recent movies that have masqueraded themselves as musicals (I'm looking at you, High School Musical) and even certain recent stage musicals for that matter, the songs in ""Nine"" by Maury Yeston mostly are able to remain catchy, and strangely relevant for a film firmly rooted in the past.

Yet here is where ""Nine"" arguably fails. The message is by no means a new one, and to whom is this retelling addressed? It is a movie in search of an audience: fans of Fellini may take umbrage at even the mention of a remake, the largely female demographic of E! Entertainment fans drawn in by the mere mention of celebrities may be offended by the chauvinistic approach of the protagonist, and fans of musicals may see the marquee list to be a cheap manipulation, akin to casting Ashley Simpson in the Broadway production of Chicago.

All this is unfortunate, as despite a poor box-office showing, and a clear lack of confidence from distributors in its limited-release run, ""Nine"" is a picture that has been painted with clear strokes of brilliance. Though ""Nine"" may never achieve the same greatness as its predecessor, it remains a haunting work of art.",1274227200,3,2804,5.030172413793103

3573616,4,B001FB55OE,"I'm going to set some ground rules here for my review.  First of all, I am a HUGE fan of Federico Fellini.  I consider his masterpiece, `8 ', to be one of the best films ever made; ever.  When `Nine' was being hyped as this great piece of musical cinema I was skeptical.  How can they make `8 ' a musical?  I mean, I knew that it had been done (on the stage) but it just seemed very, very wrong.  Besides, casts that wet with talent usually fall the pieces.  In fact, at the beginning of last year I boldly predicted that this (along with `The Lovely Bones') was going to be a big flop.  I was kind of right on both calls.

With all that in mind, I walked into `Nine' with really no expectations other than disappointment.  Since I was expecting disappointment I knew that I really couldn't be too disappointed.  All this film had to do was suck royally and it would pretty much meet my expectations.

It doesn't suck.

One thing that I will say, and many will debate me on this, is that Rob Marshall knows how to make a musical.  I actually really appreciate the way he crafts the musical scenes in his films.  By distancing the songs from the actual film itself, segregating them for sound stages that resemble the theater, he gives them credibility and a certain seductiveness that I really adore.  The camp quality of the musical is stripped away to reveal something rather enthralling.  I noticed this with `Chicago'.  While overall both films suffer in some areas and wind up a tad uneven and overwrought, both films are undeniably lavish and eye-catching.  `Nine' is one of the most beautifully staged, beautifully edited, beautifully costumed, beautifully filmed films of 2009.

Sadly, this film falters in some key areas.

Any fan of Fellini's masterpiece will notice that the films focus seems to be shifted.  I have never seen the stage musical, so I'm not sure if that was something done from the beginning or something done for this film adaptation alone, but I found the central theme to be altered.  After watching `8 ', I walked away understanding the conflicted mind of the visionary.  You have a director who struggles to stay true to himself and complete something he is proud of while battling those around him trying to condition him to their own needs and wants.  Sure, he is selfish, but so is everyone else.  `Nine' seems to disregard the artistic side of Fellini's story and mainly focuses on Guido's affairs with the women in his life.  Because of this shift, the film loses some of its credibility because it starts to appear common.  There is nothing special about a story of a philandering husband who chases tail every chance he gets.

There needed to be that something deeper here.

When you separate the films source from the actual product, there is little to chastise though.  I am not the biggest supporter of Daniel Day-Lewis.  I find him (like Denzel Washington and or Tom Hanks) to be ridiculously overrated.  That said, I loved the first half of his performance here.  He was fun and fresh and exiting and funny and charming and it was just superb.  Granted, the second half tended to become a little one note and uninteresting, but that first half was simply flawless.  In fact, the entire cast works rather well.  Judi Dench and Marion Cotillard (who should have received the Oscar nomination over Penelope Cruz) are the standouts for me.  Cotillard especially is ridiculously astonishing here, selling every ounce of pure emotion with her musical numbers.  Both numbers are key moments in the film, and she really is the ONLY one here who understood how to act while singing (take that Jennifer Hudson).  Dench is witty and charming and delightful.  Cruz is very good, but her one big number falls very flat for me.  Hudson's performance is enticing, but her musical number is so overly obnoxious I was kind of disgusted.  Loren and Kidman don't have a lot to do, and Kidman's voice has trouble pushing through some of her notes, but they don't take anything away from the film (in fact, Loren adds a little class that I really enjoyed, especially when you consider how raunchy the film can get).

And Fergie...let me just say that her number was AMAZING!

In the end I have to admit that I liked this film more than I ever imagined possible.  It is flawed, but it is also a lot of fun.  I give it a solid B, and I'm very happy with that.  Cotillard is astonishing, Day-Lewis is in rare form, Dench is delightfully snappy and the costumes, cinematography, set pieces, film editing and choreography all come together to create a visual feast that proves very appealing.",1274054400,4,4610,4.640296662546353
3573617,2,B001FB55OE,This story line kept drifting from a dead mother to a mistress to a wife and movie writer that couldn't.  It zigged and zagged so many times I felt dizzy.  This certainly was no Chicago or Cabaret.  Too many dips and not very entertaining.  A total flop in my opinion.,1273881600,2,268,4.3
3573618,5,B001FB55OE,"I saw the film shortly after it opened.  I found it bewildering, fascinating and highly entertaining.  I guess it was not a success but in my opinion, it was highly underrated.  I rented it on Tuesday and ended up buying it yesterday.  I really loved it the second time around.  It completely captures the flavor and style of Fellini's works without the deeply symbolic overtones.  It is rich with the taste and atmosphere of the Italian films of the 1960s which was a genre I greatly loved.  Although frankly speaking, most of those films were not appropriate for someone my age at the time. ""Not Recommended for Children"" was the only warning.  Those were the days when films were not rated.

One could not ask for a better cast.  Everyone is simply brilliant.  I cannot recall any film that assembled so many award winning or nominated actors.  At the core is the performance of Daniel Day Lewis, who as it turns out can dance and sing.  In fact, there is no dubbing of vocal tracks.  Well, I'm assuming that because there's mention of vocal issues during Rob Marshall's commentary.
Definitely one of the finest film versions of a stage musical I've ever seen.  I saw the original production many years ago and admired it for taking a difficult piece and making it work.  But my reaction to that production was not as strong as my reaction to this film.  As stated, this is an excellent film version, with additional numbers where necessary.

I think some of the critics judged it harshly because of its stellar cast, as though they would sound more profound by doing so. I saw the musical on stage several years ago, and they did a great job of tweaking the story for film. Nicole Kidman may not have a great voice, but boy oh boy does Marion Cotillard--her perfomance is SO MOVING!!--and Penelope Cruz is simply a knockout (who knew she could sing so well?). I liked Nine way better than Rob Marshall's earlier film, Chicago; the themes are much deeper, and I was thinking about the story long afterward (in other words, Nine is more than just some ""entertaining musical""; it is honestly thought-provoking). I highly, highly recommend this film!!",1273708800,4,833,4.751724137931035

3573621,5,B001FB55OE,"I enjoyed ""Nine"" very much, a lot more than the stage version.  I haven't read the other Amazon reviews, so this is my fresh opinion. Comparing the multi-layered Fellini film to this musical extravaganza is silly. Fellini's ""8 "" was edited in a way that left the viewer exhausted. To adapt a tale like that to the musical stage is bound to annoy film purists. On the other hand, you have the creative mind of Rob Marshall to provide added life to the already heralded musical version. There seems to be nothing he can't do with the tenuous status of the film musical. One cannot deny the brilliance of ""Chicago"" or ""Dreamgirls"", and ""Nine"" is simply another feather in his cap. Along with Tim Burton's abridged ""Sweeney Todd"", Rob Marshall has provided a ""new"" version of the Hollywood Musical that must be respected for his dedication to form and style. A less stylized version of Bob Fosse, no one has provided a better (and consistant) quality of musical film entertainment. (Randal Kleiser's ""Grease"", and Attenborough's ""A Chorus Line"" should be included somewhere in there). The Broadway-to-film musical is still alive, thanks to  visionaries like Mr. Marshall. If there's a Guiness record, this may be the most Oscar winners in any film in principal roles. Always great to see the very fine Sophia Loren. I was entertained very much by this film. To compare it to a stage show or dramatic film is pure nonsense. I can't think of a better film version of the story, as a musical. Sets, costumes, and no end of period detail is spared. DVD extras were fine.",1273536000,2,1562,4.738970588235294

I will not listen to critics again.  I believe AO Scott of the New York Times deemed this ""unwatchable"", and he couldn't have been more WRONG.
  This movie is totally brilliant.  From the opening numbers, with the great music and flair of a Bob Fosse, to the closing credits, I haven't enjoyed a movie as much since Fosse's ""All That Jazz"".  (I enjoyed this more than ""Chicago""). Immediately I was stunned by the editing of the movie, which approaches genius level.  I've never seen such split second splicing of real moments, flashbacks, dream sequences; interspersing of color with black and white images.  Truly the most magical, memorable, interesting layering of a story I've ever seen.  (They fortunately did not use the short, fast-paced cuts of Baz Luhrmann in ""Moulin Rouge"").
  Daniel Day-Lewis totally transforms into his character .. his body language and posture, the pain in his face and eyes, gives truth to this very haunted man.  What a joy to watch him sing and dance, and to move so lithely in this very physical role.  How brave of him to take on this challenge . and how well he rises to the occasion.
  The musical numbers are breathtaking.  I expected Penelope Cruz to be fabulous . . but she surpassed my expectations, as did each woman in succesion.  Judi Dench was a surprise, with a large voice, and wonderful rendition of ""Folies Bergere"" . . complete with French accent.  (The colorations and lighting in this number were so superb . . totally reminiscent of a Degas painting or poster - Rob Marshall totally gets this ).  Fergie stole the show with her force and passion, a la Sophie Loren in Two Women, in a gorgeous show-stopping routine.  Kate Hudson performed well, proving once again she is Goldie's daughter, and can DANCE.  In fact the cinematography is gorgeous is every scene, the lighting is exquisite, and every frame is evocative of a Rembrandt or Impressionist painting, and the black and white clips were so Fellini.
  The movie has depth, and is moving . . Marian Cotillard always brings great emotion to her roles.  And Sophia Loren brought her inimitable, authentic Italian touch .. .and how fabulous she looks at age 76!.
  Rob Marshall did not get the credit he deserved for this movie.  I only hope he will be able to raise the money for others like this uplifting, joyous film.
  My husband, who had been scared away by the critics loved this as well . . .and would watch it again.  So I guess I will buy it!  It's definitely a don't miss!",1273449600,2,2636,4.6529284164859

3573743,5,B001FB55OE,"One of the best movie adaptions of a Broadway musical I've ever seen.  I think 90% of the critics, and certainly 90% of the movie-going public, didn't have a clue as to what they were seeing.  The musical ""Nine"" was a surreal, semi-autobiographical, 1970's Broadway musical based on a surreal, semi-autobiographical, 1960s Fellini movie.  It requires a certain level of knowledge and sophistication to realize that the story is not supposed to make literal, linear, dramatic sense anymore than ""8 1/2"" made literal, linear cinematic sense.  But Rob Marshall is a genius, and this is film-making magic of a very high order.

When Javier Bardem bailed out of the movie I was patently annoyed that they didn't bring in Antonio Banderas, who was sensational in the Broadway revival of ""Nine"" a few seasons ago.  But after finally watching the movie, I found Daniel Day Lewis completely convincing as the middle-aged, angst-ridden, Italian movie director at the center of this psycho-sexual fantasy come to life.  He is almost channeling Fellini.

All the women from his life are knockouts, particularly Fergie in a jump-out-of-your-seat-scream-out-loud performance of ""Be Italian!""

If you want to see something fresh and invigorating - go rent the nearly 10 year old Moulin Rouge.

As for NINE, don't waste your time -- it's awful from start to finish. This movie has an insanely dull talk/sing/talk/sing pattern that never deviates and quickly creates a sense of dread and compulsive clock watching. The songs and story here are not overly compelling and you won't walk away humming any tunes.

As for performances, the lady who played the wife did a stunning job despite  her obviously limited vocal range. Daniel Day Louis gives a stunning performance -- too bad he has to play such a pathetic and uninteresting character.

3573746,4,B001FB55OE,"The movie NINE is one of the most interesting musicals to come out this past year.  Some of the key aspects of the movie is Daniel Day Lewis' character named Guido who struggles to make a hit film.  Day Lewis' acting and singing in the film was superb.  I have never been let down by any of his performances which usually always deliver.  The other performances were good, but not great unlike Daniel Day Lewis (who is one of the greatest method actors of our time).  One of the biggest complaints is the sexual content of the movie.  I never had problem with sexual content in other movies until this one.  The movie was overly sexually explicit without being overly explicit.  This was the problem.  They teased the hell out of the female characters.  Every scene with them were really sexual in the fact that they tease you without showing something.  I wouldn't have had a problem at all if they would have showed some nudity.  It seemed like all the scenes were a build up to that, but nothing happened.  Even if this movie carried a restrictive rating, I still think it could have been successful to where it's at now.  If you tease that long with the sexual content, you have to deliver with something.  Another complaint was the musical score.  It seems like a lot of the music was cliched sounding show tunes.  Although the song Cinema Italiano had spicy bongo intro, it didn't really save the soundtrack.  I didn't entirely hate the soundtrack, it's just that I have heard this stuff before in movies and musicals.

3573747,3,B001FB55OE,"NINE is far less than '8 1/2', the 1963 semi-autobiographical Federico Fellini film about a harried movie director who retreats into his memories and fantasies because writer/director block.  In that treasurable film  Guido (Marcello Mastroianni)  was seeking to make a picture that goes beyond what men think about - because no man ever thought about it in quite this way! It worked beautifully and remains a favorite in art houses even today.  That is probably why  it was decided to turn this story into a Broadway musical (Arthur Kopit, Maury Yeston, and Mario Fratti) - lots of stagy glitzy glamour to make up for a rather weak transformation of a plot.

The along come Michael Tolkin and Anthony Minghella with the thought that the musical may be strong enough to make into a film (not unlike the road to 'Chicago').  Rob Marshall stepped up to direct and selected 6 previous Oscar winners to fill the rather shallow cast of characters.  The problem is that the story in the hands of these men becomes a monotonous one-note song decorated with so many splashy show-stopping numbers  that for moments the audience forgets how dull the story has become.  Daniel Day-Lewis is the moping Guido (not at all up the standards of the Broadway Guido of Antonio Banderas) who manages to sing his two songs gratefully disguised with cinematic flashbacks;  Marion Cotillard almost makes us believe in Carla, Guido's beleaguered and emotionally abandoned wife; Penlope Cruz is quite stunning as his mistress Carla; Sophia Loren is Sophia Loren as Mamma - still gorgeous on screen; Nicole Kidman is Claudia, Guido's star; Judi Dench  plays Guido's costumer and confidant Lilli, delivering the fine song 'Folies-Bergre' with style; Kate Hudson is a reporter who is able to belt out her own song; Fergie sings the main tune form the show 'Be Italian' with gusto; and Ricky Tognazzi is Guido's pushy producer.

With a cast such as this it would seem as thought he film would be a smash hit.  The problem is that the pacing is boring, the songs sound like poor takeoffs on Kander and Ebb and the dance sequences are imitation Bob Fosse.  Nothing original here - unless you're content with splashy overproduced stage numbers.  Fellini would shudder! Grady Harp, May 10",1273363200,,2255,4.910290237467018

Penelope Cruz, who I usually think is some stick insect with a really big noggin is curvy and hot and wow.

Marianne Cotillard is gorgeous. So reminiscent of Audrey Hepburn, but then they put her in a bustier and pasties and, um... wow.

Nicole Kidman. Meh. ""Central casting? Yeah- I need a tall statue that can walk. Nicole Kidman's available? Great. Truck her on up.""

Kate Hudson's part was really overplayed in the trailers, I'm guessing cuz she's cute and blonde and kicky and fringy. Not bad though.

Judi Densch. I just love her. She cracks my s**t up.

Sophia Loren is finally showing her age, but she's what? 157? There's a scene where she dances with the young Guido, and then with the grown up Guido (DDL) that is exquisite. It really brought tears to my eyes. It could be because I'm an emotional shipwreck today for a hundred other reasons, but I did love that scene.

3573749,1,B001FB55OE,"Federico Fellini was considered one of the great directors of all time. His films inspired not only the people of Italy but film makers around the world. As is the case with most famous directors, Fellini had his ups and downs, his hits and misses, but he was always considered inventive and original if nothing else. His film ""8  ""is considered a masterpiece. So it only seems natural that the film was turned into a stage musical and now the film, NINE.

Daniel Day Lewis stars as Guido Contini, an Italian film maker who is being rushed into his latest project. Dazed and confused, Guido has no script and no idea what his film will be about. But this doesn't stop the producer from touting the making of the new film to the press and the crew preparing for Guido's next masterpiece.

The problem is that Guido has no idea what to do next and has yet to reveal this to the crew or the cast. As he is frantically rushed from one place to the next, he escapes and heads off to a secluded retreat where he calls in his mistress, Carla (Penelope Cruz). But even Carla doesn't have the ability to crash his writer's block. Before he has a chance to even attempt it, the producer and his crew show up at his hotel and begin work there on the same film...which he doesn't have.

Things get more complicated when his wife Luisa (Marion Cotillard) arrives. When she sees his mistress in the hotel restaurant, she heads for her room, crushed that Guido and his womanizing ways haven't changed after their years together. Guido may enjoy time spent with his mistress, but in his own way he loves his wife. It is the women in Guido's life that have influenced him the most, from the town tramp when he was a child to his mother to his wife.

Confused and not sure where his life is going, Guido seeks out any truth he can find. He talks to a monsignor at the church, his friend and favorite costume designer Lilli (Judi Dench) and even the spirit of his deceased mother (Sophia Loren). But in the end, Guido must come to grips with the reality that he is hollow when it comes to true love. And in making this journey of self discovery, Guido finds the inspiration for his next film. The only problem is the pain he has caused himself and others to find his solution.

Fellini based ""8  ""on his own life. The story of the making of the film falls directly into what happens here as well as that film. He did find himself unable to make a new film, to find the right story. And in realizing this, he found the story that he may be best remembered for.

But the musical film here lacks the panache of a Fellini film. It covers the surface of his views on women between garter belts and bustiers dressed on overly endowed (or uplifted) females. But there was so much more to Fellini than this. And until the last 25 minutes or so of the film, this never seems to come out.

The hustle and bustle of making movies, of trying to find that next hit, is portrayed here as little more than running from one spot to the next. The self interest of this director who lets people wait while he dallies away his days comes across, but rather limply. The musical numbers, the center piece of any good musical, seem lackluster and just there (with the exception of ""Be Italian"" performed by Fergie). These should be songs that you walk away singing or in your head. That doesn't happen here.

Director Rob Marshall had a huge hit with the film CHICAGO based on another famous musical stage production. His visual and staging style show when compared side by side, with perhaps more soundstage sequences apparent in CHICAGO. Here, we find ourselves whisked away to locales in Italy and then transported to a single stage set up where almost all musical numbers are performed. It's as if the film can't decide whether to be about film making or about a stage production. In so doing, it takes away a tremendous amount from the film.

While watching this movie I found the dreaded kiss of death in my hand. I constantly checked the timer to see just how much more of the movie there was to go. With the exception of the last 25 minutes, I found little to enjoy here. Instead I was bored. The only saving grace was that in watching this film, it made me want to go back and see ""8 "", which I've never had a chance to do.

In this film, Penelope Cruz is afraid of looking into the camera, and all the dance scenes are filmed from Row M in the back of the theater. I guess this is done because Cruz and others cant give a believable closeup, just as Zelweigger couldn't in Chicago. It takes a special kind of talent to be able to do the ""Vamp"" thing and look right into the camera lens. I don't know who's the bigger incompetent here, Marshal or Cruz, but to waste DD Lewis and have him sitting around grinning convincingly is a shame, and we are never treated to experience any real ""spirit"" or guts.

It also does not help that Contini's lust for women is creating tension in his marriage to Luisa (Marion Cotillard). Needless to say, his career and personal life are at risk.

  The film is visually stunning and eye-popping especially when the camera gets out into Rome. But beyond that it vary rarely soars. Part of the problem is in the editing of the musical numbers. Cardinal rule MGM 101; never cut off the dancer's legs - show the footwork! Let the camera move with the dance and a close up only at the end of the number. In only one shot in the film is the camera allowed to move in full frame of the dancers. ""Be Italian"" has that shot as the camera sweeps along the chorus line of lovely ladies lead by Saraghina and gives a glimmer of what this film could have been.
  So with the loss of the Fellini magic and poor editing what is left. The Ladies. Each and every one of the female stars from Sophia Loren to Judi Dench are stunning, sharp and dazzling in there performances. This is the only saving grace of the film, even Nicole Kidman who seems too old and miscast as Claudia still manages to be entertaining. (Remember the lush young beauty of Claudia Cardinale in playing Claudia in  ""8 "" and you will see what I mean. By miscast.)  The real treasures of the film are Penelope Cruz as Carla and Marion Cotillard as Guido's wife. These two women just blow everyone off the screen in their scenes.
  And at last we come to Guido, Daniel Day Lewis is more complaining than soul searching as Guido. He is bogged and mired in self-pity where he should be floating in and out of his artistic block and his ethereal dream world that he so wants to translate onto film.

3573785,4,B001FB55OE,"This film is very worthwhile. This has been criticized for lacking focus and being distant. Well the answer is simple, look closer and delve into the nature of the characters. Almost all flaws will disappear. Daniel Day Lewis always shines and stuns us once again with his dazzling versatility. The music is great and the supporting cast is equally impressive. Musicals adapted to the screen as usually hard to watch but Marshall adds his scintillating touch to make them special. I highly recommend this anyone who enjoyed Chicago (2002/I) and enjoys musicals in general. Your opinions of your favorite actors will be changed for the better.",1269734400,3,642,5.066037735849057
3573786,5,B001FB55OE,"Today, I went to see Rob Marshall's new musical, Nine, obviously based upon the Broadway musical of the same name, that based off Fellini's 8 1/2. It should be mentioned that the movie contains not quite as many songs as the stage performance does, but, each actress in the wonderful cast having one song, and the way the songs are presented, it certainly works.

Daniel Day-Lewis leads the cast, playing Italian filmmaker Guido Contini, who is about fifty, and going through something of a midlife crisis. Lewis brings alot of panache to the role, belting out his lyrics with such assurance that this part has been well-practiced and a certain amount of passion has been brought into it, playing the character perfectly.

His long-suffering wife Luisa, splendidly re-imagined, not played by Marion Cotillard, is the one gem in the cast that outshines all of its other members. You feel emotion for her character that you don't feel for the others, you can tell that her character has been through alot, and you're happy to see her come out on top at the end.

Penelope Cruz also adds alot to the film, playing Contini's mistress, Carla, a role that 30 Rock's Jane Krakowski played on Broadway, Cruz also brings alot of emotion and sass, often simultaneously, to her role. You really understand Contini's predicament, and sympathize with the character, for not being able to break her heart, or that of his wife. Her musical number brings alot of excitement, and her enthusiasm, and her roaring Soprano is unlike anything we ever thought we'd see from this actress. I see her winning awards a-many for her performance in this.

Dame Judi Dench, always worthwhile, plays Lilli, Contini's wisecracking costume designer and confidante. Dench brings comic relief, having more scenes than any other of the actresses in the film, but also brings depth, playing a kind of a psychiatrist to the lead character, and also bringing a fantastic voice, for her musical number, which contains many chorus girls in feather boas, you think you're watching The Rockettes or something out of A Chorus Line, but for the song, it certainly works.

Fergie plays Saraghina, a figure from Contini's youth who taught him about love, and how to attract a woman. Fergie only has one scene in the movie, basically. She shows up in the overture, and finale, but, her only big scene is her show-stopping musical number Be Italian, which generated applause in my theatre. It makes me wonder if they used Fergie less, because maybe her acting talents were not up to par. I guess we'll never know, but her singing voice is something we didn't even expect from her, as she belts the lyrics with such undeniable passion and exuberance, you're glad this minor role was played by her.

Nicole Kidman plays Contini's muse, actress Claudia Jensen, who is mentioned in the film's beginning, then disappears until close to the movie's end. I kind of feel like Kidman's obvious musical talent, displayed previously in Moulin Rouge, come off as a bit underused, because she has one of the best singing voice among the cast and she only has one song. That's one of the few things that bugged me about this wonderful movie.

Kate Hudson plays American magazine journalist, Stephanie, who isn't in very much of the movie either, but Kate Hudson's big musical number, Cinema Italiano, written specifically for the movie, is amazing. I hate to use the word ""amazing"", because I think it's overused and it's lost its affect, but it's the only way to describe this scene, the way that director Rob Marshall cut the number, switching from sequences in black and white, then color, then black and white again, it's a truly unique experience that you really need to see to completely understand. And here's a surprise, Kate Hudson can sing. I thought she was only cut out for mid-level rom-coms, but I'm glad to say I was wrong, she definitely fits in with the musically talented cast of this movie.

Sophia Loren plays Contini's mother, who is tragically underused, but brought in at the right times in the movie. She, again, only has one song, but it feels like enough, for this actress, who's still looking great, at age 75, bringing drama to her role, and she gives more than she needs to, but it's certainly good to see her onscreen again.

The direction of the movie is just as much one of the stars of the show. Rob Marshall, having directed Chicago and Memoirs of a Geisha knows a thing or two about grand-scale production musical numbers and high-octane drama, and he brings it all to this film, although some of the songs are cut in a way that feels chaotic and rushed, but I think it doesn't hurt the movie at all. It's a movie built on high caliber acting, beautiful music, and gorgeous imagery, and it's something you have to see for yourself. It's that good.",1269475200,2,4820,4.776710684273709
3573787,5,B001FB55OE,"I kinda knew that someone made at some point a musical about Fellini's 8&1/2, but by the time I went to the theater to see 9, I totally forgot about it. It took me one minute to realize what this movie was about, as the Maestro was given access into one of the sets of Cinecitt and the lights and the voices and the muses started to light-up the place. From there on, it was total bliss: this was all about 8&1/2.

Rob Marshall has done a truly outstanding job at capturing the essence of Federico Fellini's 8 & 1/2 conflicts and dreamy visions. He has made a movie that has always been hard to follow accessible, yet at the same time, the his approach to the musical has given this classic a fresh, interesting and highly engaging approach. The camera work is beautiful; for instance, the grainy black and white treatment given to the ""Cinema Italiano"" piece is quite simply a delight to watch, truly reminiscent of the Italian movies from the Fifties, their unquestionable Golden Age. The acting is truly amazing, especially Marion Cotillard (hard to understand why she was not considered for an Oscar).

I am in total disbelief at the cold reception by critics, and deeply annoyed by all the snobs' comments about how this movie does not stack up to 8 & 1/2; c'mon, give me a break! How many of those pseudo-connoiseurs stayed awake through 8 & 1/2? Don't get me wrong: 8 & 1/2 is in my opinion one of the top 5 movies of all time, certainly the crown jewel of Italian cinema and Fellini's unquestionable masterpiece, the movie every director has lifted from, and tried to imitate unsuccessfully, ever since. And yet, it takes a lot of pedaling to absorb it, to make sense of it, and yes, to enjoy it. Marshall managed to retain all key elements -this movie really stays true to the original- and managed to come through with a final product that while being highly entertaining and visually arresting, invites us to reflect about middle age crisis, women in all their facets, the fear of failure, and everything that we learned wrong as we grew up. I highly recommend this movie to anyone in love with movies, with women and without intellectual insecurities. More so, I recommend it to anyone who appreciates the great, unforgettable work of Federico Fellini and Giulietta Massina.",1269216000,11,2286,4.6419753086419755
3573788,1,B001FB55OE,"The movie musical ""Nine"" is an insult to the genius of Federico Fellini and that of  Tommy Tune. The Broadway musical is based on Fellini's film ""Eight and a Half"" which deals with  the director's movie-making block in the 1960's. He went to a spa to recuperate and began to envision a thrilling confessional style. The title came from the fact that he had just finished his eighth film and couldn't decide what his ninth film would be about. Tommy Tune adapted the film for Broadway using the health spa as his only set. The musical showed all the women in his mind and what they had meant to him and alas what he did to them. Fellini let us see his guilt and where it came from. Tommy Tune and Maury Yeston made it sing. It was a phenomenal experience.

When I heard that Rob Marshall was considering making a film version of the show, I was concerned because the score is not one of Broadway's best and that the dramatic intent of the score would not come across on screen. I also thought that Marshall is not yet the great film maker that Fellini was and could in no way come up to the Maestro's standards. I was proven right. I was so dismayed that Marshall set in the film on a movie set and not in a spa. This is very indicative of Marshall whose style is rather cartoonish and bombastic as evidenced in his film version of ""Chicago"" which razzle-dazzled itself into caricature rather than the deadly satire that was Fosse's vision so beautifully recreated in Walter Bobby's Broadway revival. Federico Fellini was a master at combining the subtle with the grotesque. His choice of the spa gave him the freedom to move from the everyday to the realm of the protagonist's dreams and memories. The clean white walls of the spa were blank canvases on which Fellini was able to take his audience into the mind and heart of Guido's nervous breakdown. We were given nothing of Daniel Day-Lewis' inner conflict--just running up and down staircases and scowling at the camera. Who was this man for whom women suffered? Marshall had no idea. But then Marshall has trouble capturing the nuances of his male characters. For example, Richard Gere, who is a fine subtle actor was nothing but a cardboard character in ""Chicago.""

As to the three main women in ""Nine"" they are symbols of three facets of women. Kidman is the ice queen. Cruz was the whore; Coitilard the long-suffering wife. With his ending of ""Nine"" Marshall would have us think that these women are Fellini's inspiration, but they are only his instruments upon which he plays his songs. Fellini had much more to film than just some little romance, which seems to be what Daniel Day-Lewis was working on at the end of ""Nine"" the movie. Fellini never made a little romance--his vision was epic. Marshall's is myopic.

Again, when the ""Nine"" news came out, I thought Marshall was making a bad decision. He just isn't equipped with subtlety. I wish he had chosen Sondheim's ""Follies"" which is certainly more in his range with great parts for women and cold, torn men. I do think given the right material Marshall can be one of our great directors. Hey, Rob, go back to Broadway and direct a few little plays. Trust the material first and out it will come mastering of your craft.

One last note: I hope I never see another musical number in which scantily clad women sing and dance around a chair. Let Bob Fosse rest in peace!!",1268352000,17,3382,4.563426688632619
3573789,5,B001FB55OE,"Opinion on films is such an interesting thing, no two people feel the same way about the art of
film. What's one man's poison etc....""Nine"" seems to have been dividing a lot of people. Reviews
have been almost ridiculously divided, after initial positive press (mainly in ""Variety"") a couple of
major critics utterly trashed it. This seemed to play into a certain loathing of director Rob
Marshall, who, many in the film world resented the way a choreographer had risen from the
ranks to direct an Academy Award winning movie (ie ""Chicago"") Others (especially in Australia)
have been much more embracing of the film, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Sun Herald
both gave it rave reviews. More positive reviews have been turning up every day, so much so
that today a lengthy advert appeared in the paper listing quotes. It;s good to see some people
liking the film as there is much to like.

I went to the film very cynically, but it drew me into its world so much that I did something I
havent done for years, I snuggled down in my seat and stayed and watched it again. I found the
film quite enthralling, the boldness of Marshall's vision, the performances, especially Day Lewis
who completely makes Contini his own and the magnificent Marion Cotillard among the highlights.

Many of the fans of the stage show have been scathing of the movie. No one could be more fond of the stage show than I, but to film it as a stage show runs the risk of the film of the musical ""The Producers"" which stayed so loyal to the show that it is now viewed as little more than an ambitious filming of the stage text. Movies as we know are a different form and very few stage musicals have successfully made that transition. In only examining films post ""Chicago"", I can only think of two that have come close to making a strong film of a hit stage show -"" ""Dreamgirls"" and ""Hairspray"", neither are really great films and both heavily flawed in many ways, but they do manage to stay faithful to the book of the musical in some way while still being movies in their own right. I personally love ""Rent"" the movie, with all its flaws, as it has some great set pieces and a very strong heart, but it is easy to be very critical of it.  The others including Tim Burtons' failed attempt to translate ""Sweeney Todd"" to film, the uneven and hysterically undisciplined ""Mamma Mia"", the languid ""Phantom of the Opera"", all fail to really make the basic premise of the original text live as a movie in its own right. (In the case of :""Mamma Mia"" one could argue -what text!)

""Nine"" I believe makes the transition to film successfully by throwing out many of the songs and set pieces of the stage show while still holding on to the central theme of the show- that is, that for Contini to overcome his demons and his mid life crisis and understand his own womanizing, he has to embrace his inner child. This is the main theme of the Fellini movie as well as the stage show. The stage musical painted this theme in strong colours even to the extent of having the young Guido as part of most of the action and the musical numbers. He makes many appearances in the film as well and I was wondering without the two finally meeting and singing together in the final moments, how that embracing could actually occur. The final words Guido says to his little Guido in the stage musical are to give him advise to go and be embraced by his mother- ""I'll be fourty and you'll be nine"".
The movie ties this up beautifully without the song, we learn in the final moments that the film he is making is called ""nine"" it is clearly autobiographical and the little boy sits on Guido's lap and the two sail high on the movie crane as Guido calls `action'.

Yes we miss the colour and movement, the comedic touches of the stage show, the idea that Guido is going to make a musical of ""Casanova"" is much of the central premise of the stage musical, this would never work in film. Yet this is a more serious look at a man (now aged 50 not 40-more believable) in total crisis, the main four songs from the stage show are there, added with some nice new numbers and
a sense of Fellini and Rome that is perhaps missing in the stage show. This is film  of very European sensibilities, every aspect seems to breathe the central song's theme ""be Italian"", which may explain why some American critics have not ""got it"". It will do well in Europe and I suggest better than expected in Australia. Commercially it can never be a ""Chicago"", its theme is too personal, its canvas too subtle for the broard strokes of a musical bathed in burlesque and murder. Yet Marshall does allow his comic and musical homages; Judi Dench resplendent in ""Folies Bergere' is given her Sally Bowles moment, paying tribute to the role she so affectively created on stage, Kate Hudson deliberately cast in a production number that pays homage to the ""Laugh In' go- go numbers her mother made so famous in the sixties, Nicole Kidman clearly be-decked out to look like Anita Ekberg in ""La Dolce Vita"".  Yet when Marshall turns his eye to his real leading lady; Marion Cotillard, as the much dumped on wife-Luisa, this is when movie magic occurs. Watching her ""My Husband Makes Movies"" is breathtaking with Dion Beebe's camera translating her every move onto a film canvas that illuminates her every word and thought, again her strip number, gets the point across as a worthy replacement for ""Be on Your Own"" her stage number in this part of the story scenario.
In the stage musical Luisa leaves Guido when she sees he is making a mock musical of their own lives, in the film she leaves him when she sees the way he is handling a young starlet in a screen test, so similar to the beginning of their own relationship.

For me ""Nine"" is a masterpiece and I agree with one Australian critic this week who linked it to ""Cabaret:"" and ""All That Jazz"", putting it in the same company as ""Cabaret"" is praise perhaps a little too high, but it is up there with the best of musicals from stage shows. It hurdles the impossible gap between stage and film, but to truly love it, we must let go our memories of the wonderful way the stage musical told the story and embrace Marshall's new vision of the same story.
Let us hope this isn't the last musical he makes, he is a master of the craft, I would love to see what he would do with ""Pippin"", ""Follies"" and ""Company"", all stage musicals tipped to be made into movies. Let us hope the failure of ""Nine"" at the American box office doesn't hold back this master from what he does best. !!",1268179200,10,6544,4.456594323873122

STARRING: Daniel Day-Lewis, Marion Cotillard, Penelope Cruz, Judi Dench, Kate Hudson, Nicole Kidman, Sophia Loren and Stacy Ferguson

WRITTEN BY: Michael Tolkin and Anthony Minghella; based on the Broadway musical ""Nine"" by Arthur Kopit, Maury Yeston and Mario Fratti

DIRECTED BY: Rob Marshall

Rated: PG - 13
Genre: Musical / Drama
Release Date: 25 December 2009

If Nine wasn't one of the ten best films of 2009, it sure was close. I'm not a big fan of musicals in general, but if a film is good, then it's good. Rob Marshal, the Academy Award nominated director of Chicago, has created another unique and glorious musical with a banging soundtrack.

Daniel Day-Lewis stars as Guido Contini. He's a guy who isn't very optimistic despite having Marion Cotillard for a wife and Penelope Cruz for a mistress. He is a successful filmmaker and is having trouble producing the material for his latest film. But due to his accredited past, he is able to have an entire production put into motion without even so much as a rough copy of a screenplay.

The film opens with a huge musical number that was not the least bit cheap. We meet all the leading ladies, and Guido. These leading ladies consist of Marion Cotillard, Kate Hudson, Judie Dench, Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman, Sophia Loren and Stacy Ferguson (aka `Fergie' for you MTV folks).

They are all leading ladies in Hollywood and the characters they portray are leading ladies in the mind and or life of Guido. Sophia Loren is his mother, Judi Dench is his costume designer, Nicole Kidman is his friend as well as a famous actress, and Stacy Ferguson plays a seductive woman of his past that he found attractive at a very young age.

The reason for the huge musical number is to show us that Guido is a man who is constantly fantasizing about these various women in several different ways. Each one of them performs an amazing song at some point in the film; usually, if not always, taking place in Guido's mind.

Guido sulks around the frame throughout the film, living off utter moments of happiness that fade away within seconds. At one moment Penelope Cruz's character does it for him, but then he loses interest and it's Kate Hudson who has his attention. His wife even manages to catch his eye for a brief moment, but it's more than anything the fact that she's enraged with his having an affair, that he finds appealing. He's a poor sap indeed, but Lewis plays him magnificently. If you have seen Lewis in even one other film, then I don't need to tell you how talented he is.

Kate Hudson is in the film for a very short time, but blew me out of my seat nonetheless. She shows a side of herself that I have never seen before, that reminded me partially of her mother (Goldie Hawn) and something else completely unknown. I can't believe that she was not nominated for her performance. As if that's not bad enough, her beautiful song `Italian Cinema' was snubbed out of a nomination to boot. Why was this overlooked? I can't be alone in thinking it was spectacular.

I can see how Nicole Kidman, Daniel Day-Lewis and Judi Dench were all able to walk away without an Oscar nomination. Not that they weren't great, but we know what to expect from them; they are three of the most talented people acting today. But how did Marion Cotillard go unnoticed?

She was magnificent as Guido's emotionally neglected wife. There is a scene near the end of the film where she has come to the realization that he is not the man she thought he was when they married. He looks at her and sees this written across her face, and it is very powerful stuff. Her songs were extraordinary and one of them received an Oscar nomination.

Stacy Ferguson doesn't really do much acting in the film, but her song `Be Italian' was very enjoyable to watch and could have very easily been nominated for an Oscar as well.

It's almost offensive that out of all the incredible actors in Nine, Penelope Cruz was the only one to receive an Oscar nomination. I think she's a pretty good actress overall; but up against Daniel Day-Lewis, Judi Dench, Nicole Kidman and especially Marion Cotillard and Kate Hudson; Cruz falls miserably behind in this film. All of the other actors brought far more to the table than she did. It's bad enough she already won last year for her mediocre performance in Vicky Christina Barcelona. Sometimes, I just don't get the get the Academy Awards.",1267833600,42,4408,4.633333333333334
3573831,1,B001FB55OE,"I truly regret going to see this film and wasting 2 hours of my day.  The film was a complete bore, and I nodded off in the theater a couple times during the show.  The story and dialogue didn't give me anyone to care about in the film. I could have cared less about how everyone ended up. The musical numbers were not at all memorable, didn't have tunes that stuck in my head, or lyrics I could sing along with.  As for the dance choreography--what choreography?  The dancing routines looked like no thought had been put into them.

As for the actors and actresses: Marion Cotillard's character was sympathetic, but I couldn't get enough of a feeling about who she was, what drove her, what made her a unique character; so I couldn't really generate any strong feelings towards her.  Daniel Day-Lewis was merely bland, I think a dozen other actors could have filled his place without any difference in the film.  Kate Hudson's character was cute, but irritating.  Penelope Cruz was sultry, but I can't actually remember anything about her character.  Sophia Loren was in it? I totally forgot.  Judi Dench was great as always but her role was small (a costume designer) and she only appeared briefly onscreen.

All in all, a terrible bore. The film totally lacked the sparkle and excitement of Rob Marshall' last musical, 'Chicago'.",1267315200,7,1332,4.7229437229437226
3573832,2,B001FB55OE,"The cinematography and the lighting of each scene is superb. When the reporter (played by Kate Hudson) remarks that the main character's movies include each shot that's like a postcard, one can't help but relate to the comparison for this film. Yet, the movie's plot is thin and the bottom line is even thinner. One doesn't relate or feel even the slightest hint of sympathy for the director who is having a middle-life crisis and who is strangely played by Daniel-Day Lewis.

Penelope Cruz's musical opening number is the best thing in the movie. Having said that, I think it's uncalled for to give Penelope an Oscar nomination for her role in ""NINE."" She might be the best thing about the movie, but that's not saying much. Also, Cruz has had so many more outstanding performances that went unnoticed it's almost sacrilegious to recognize this performance over the others. Particularly, her performance in ""Elegy"" was breathtaking.

The biggest surprise about this movie is perhaps Fergie's musical number - it's more upbeat and dramatic than the rest of the film.

On their own, there are likable characters in this film - the costume designer played by Judi Dench. Still, it's not enough to save this film and, definitely, this is not a film of Oscar caliber.",1266105600,3,1263,4.865116279069768

Marshall gives short shrift to the ""a movie about..."" part.  'Nine' is basically the play, pushed directly onto screen.  It's a series of set pieces, plopped sequentially onto the screen.  The doughnut hole in the middle is Daniel Day-Lewis, never believable as an Italian director.  Likewise, Nicole Kidman's star turn stops just short of parody.  Has there ever been a less-likely portrayal on screen than Kidman's breathless, coquettish take on the movie role originated by Italian great Claudia Cardinale?  Her waxen, Botox-induced frozen visage is completely out-of-place.

3573834,5,B001FB55OE,"I HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO THE BAD REVIEWS ABOUT THIS EXCELLENT MUSICAL SINCE IT WAS RELEASED. ROB MARSHALL'S CONCEPTION OF THIS BROADWAY MUSICAL IS BRILLIANT. WE ARE NOT SUPPOSE TO KNOW ANYTHING MORE ABOUT THE WOMEN IN DANIEL DAY LEWIS' LIFE. JUST THAT THEY WERE PART OF HIS LIFE AS HE GREW TO MANHOOD. NO DIFFERENT THAN THE HIT BROADWAY MUSICAL. MARSHALL EFFORTLESSLY INTEGRATES THE SONGS WITH THE DRAMA. EVERY NUMBER AND I MEAN EVERY NUMBER IS A SHOWSTOPPER AND STAGED AS ONLY MARSHALL COULD DO. THIS IS A FIRST RATE MOTION PICTURE AND I THINK IT'S BEEN UNJUSTLY IGNORED BY THE PUBLIC AND THE CRITICS. IT STANDS ALONE AS IT'S OWN ENTITY AND CAN NOT BE COMPARED WITH CHICAGO WHICH IN IT'S OWN BRILLIANT COMMERCIAL WAY IS ALSO A CLASSIC.
NINE IS A COMPLICATED AND HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED MUSICAL THAT WASN'T MEANT TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY. THE PICTURE BELONGS TO DANIEL DAY LEWIS NOT TO THE WOMEN IN HIS LIFE.
MAURY YESTON HAS WRITTEN A FANTASTIC SCORE AND COMBINED WITH ROB MARSHALL'S DIRECTION IT FAR SURPASSES THE ACTUAL BROADWAY SHOW. I LOVED THIS FILM AND CAN NOT WAIT TO OWN THE DVD. BY THE WAY, NICOLE KIDMAN JUST HAPPENS TO SING ONE OF THE OUTSTANDING SONGS, (UNUSUAL WAY), WRITTEN BY YESTON AND DRAMATICALLY PERFORMS THE SONG TO PERFECTION. IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO SEPARATE THE SONG FROM THE DIALOGUE. CUDOS TO MARSHALL!!!!",1265155200,55,1325,4.740259740259741
3573835,3,B001FB55OE,"This musical is ok, but Chicago is by far the best of this generation. Only two of the musical numbers stopped the show: the ones by Kate Hudson (best) and Penelope Cruz (2nd best but awesome. She carries it all by herself, no sets and no backup dancers, but yes some overt sex). The one by Fergie was also good, but the others fell somewhat flat.

Almost nothing came to life for me in this, not in the drama nor in the musical numbers. The only character that worked was Penelope Cruz'. I really believed everything she said and the entire situation. Main story of the genius that can't do it anymore was painful, too close to home, and uninteresting and was done over and over to the point of boredom. The only thing that worked for me was the story of the agony of the extra marital affair. The other woman that so badly wants her man but can never have him, the wife that so badly wants the peaceful domestic life of which she's always dreamed but will never have it with this husband, and the man that loves two women and is torn between trying to give them both what they need.

The gimmick dramatic technique of fantasy song vs. reality didn't work at all for me.

They way overuse that one first set, it was used in, like, 7 of 10 songs. At the same time they underused location footage. The opening location scenes in Rome were great but we got almost no other great footage like that anymore. They should have done a lot more of that.

Did superstar Nicole Kidman appear? Oh yeah, she got a 30 second scene with one line rubbing a guy's head, and then at the very end of the movie she gets a song and a scene. She was wasted in this.

Too many superstars watered down the chemistry. Each star only gets one song: Judi Dench, Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman, Fergie, Kate Hudson, and Sophia Loren. It's great as a super-star collage, but that strategy hurt the movie. You don't have enough time to get used to their style and to let the character grow on you. Fergie, for example, just appears suddenly in the movie as a prostitute with no lines and then goes into a song and then that's it. That doesn't give Fergie, nor her character, a chance to work on you.",1264377600,,2168,4.316953316953317

I simply don't understand why ""Nine"", the new musical, not to be confused with ""9"", the recent animated film from Tim Burton, s getting pretty unanimously bad critical reviews. I don't understand why fans of the genre are staying away.

Directed by Rob Marshall (""Chicago""), ""Nine"" is an adaptation of a very successful Broadway musical adapted from the Fellini film ""8 "". The film contains some very good performances and some amazing vocals and dancing from actors I didn't know could sing or dance. Add to that a beautiful and romantic period setting and you have a film that is a fitting companion piece to ""Chicago"".

Are fans of this genre waiting for the next Gene Kelly or Fred Astaire? Is that why they are staying away? Do you secretly desire ""An American in Paris II"" or a remake of ""Singin' In The Rain""? That won't happen (I pray to God). As we continue to evolve and our tastes become more modern, the genres we love have to adapt and change along with us. For a long period of time, the only musicals we could see on the big screen were animated. Many of these were great and provided an avenue for talented people. Then, Baz Luhrmann managed to convince 20th Century Fox to let him make ""Moulin Rouge"". ""Chicago"", ""Mamma Mia"", ""Hairspray"" and more than a few films that should be forgotten followed this. A lot of people didn't like ""Moulin Rouge"" because of the frantic visual style. I loved it. ""Chicago"" is a bit more traditional than ""Moulin Rouge"", allowing the viewer to get involved in the story and characters because they take a moment (every so often) to breath. Now Marshall follows this success with ""Nine"".

Rome, the 60s. Guido Contini (Daniel Day-Lewis), a very successful Italian film director is experiencing writer's block after two of his films have flopped. This is unfortunate because his longtime producer is practically forcing him to make his new film. They have a title, ""Italia"" and are convinced it will star Claudia Messina (Nicole Kidman), Contini's longtime muse. Even his confidant, and confessor, his longtime costume designer, Lilli (Judi Dench) knows he is having trouble, but she does her best to provide support and a nudge when needed. A set is in production on a huge soundstage at Cincecitta, but Guido is experiencing a midlife crisis and can't come up with anything to write about. When the pressure becomes too great, he runs off to a spa on the Italian peninsula and hides there, trying to escape everyone and everything. He calls his wife, Luisa (Marion Cotillard, ""La Vie En Rose"") and tells her he will be home in a few days. Then he calls his mistress, Carla (Penelope Cruz) and gets her installed in a nearby penzione. When his production team and producer show up at the spa, what was supposed to be rest quickly becomes a working holiday and continues to stress out the famous director. Instead, he begins to remember all of the women in his life and with each memory, comes a new musical number and an equally amusing performance by one of the ladies.

I really liked a lot about what ""Nine"" is trying to do. Unfortunately, I also think many of the things I like are also the same things keeping people away from the multiplex.

As Guido deals with his writer's block and all of the complications of his life, he begins to remember back to each of the important women in his life and their various influences in shaping who he has become. There are some references to Guido's history with women and the sheer number of sexual partners seems to be large, but there are certain women in his life who are important and he remembers each with fondness. As the memories flood back, Marshall begins to cut some of the most beautiful footage I have seen in a long time into the story, providing us with a biographical glimpse into the director's life. He remembers back to his childhood when he paid a loose woman to show off her private parts to a group of children. This is told through black and white footage and shows the boys running across an Italian beach. When the woman comes out of her hut, ""Be Italian"" begins and the story cuts back and forth from the footage at the beach to a full-blown musical number featuring singer Fergie (from the Black Eyed Peas) as Saraghina. As the musical number progresses, you begin to realize Saraghina and the many other women in the number are actually on the soundstage back in the studio in Rome, it's iconic roman arches ever present. Yet, the singers are sitting on wooden chairs and flinging sand around. It is a visually striking musical number and quickly establishes how the film will unfold.

Not only do we start to get a feeling for Guido's life leading up to this crisis, we also realize he is, in fact, remembering things that will eventually make it into the film he has to make next. His memories are showing him his next film, guiding him through the narrative before he writes it.

Later, when Carla (Cruz) arrives at the Spa, she sings the song ""Guido, Guido, Guido""; cavorting around in an outfit Victoria's Secret would be smart to copy. Carla is deeply in love with Guido and dances using pink velvet ropes and silk.

Judi Dench is surprisingly good when her turn comes. As a major influence in Guido's life, he turns to her for support, guidance, a stern word when needed. She reveals a lot about her background as a fashion designer when she sings the song ""Folies Bergere"", about her early life designing costumes for the racy nightclub in Paris. Dancers in costumes reminiscent of the popular Parisian show dance around the same Roman arches.

Kate Hudson is also very good as Stephanie, a young American journalist in Rome writing about the director for a magazine. She follows Guido to the spa and flirts with him, the sexual tension increasing exponentially. This footage is intercut with Hudson and a slew of dancers performing ""Cinema Italiano"", which is, I believe, the one new number written for the film. The musical segment is a lot of fun, very fast paced and done as a tribute to the 60s. Hudson seems to be channeling some of her mom's early persona in the performance.

Marian Cotillard and Nicole Kidman are the two most personal female relationships in his life, so their numbers are more introspective and romantic.

Sophia Loren plays Mamma and it is great to see her on screen as Guido's conscience. But her musical number is least successful because she doesn't appear to be as good a singer or as comfortable singing. It is more of the ""talking lyrically"" type of song people generally do when they can't do a real musical number.

Overall, the musical numbers are very good. Will they be memorable enough to be remembered in a decade? Two? Three? Will Robert Osborne's clone talk about the film one day on Turner Movie Classics? I don't know. But they are fun to watch.

This is one of those films set in a very specific place where everyone has a different accent. This aspect of the film reminded me a bit of the big budget films produced in the late 50s and early 60s, the type filled with an International cast to ensure box office success around the world. Daniel Day Lewis' Italian accent is impressive and even more impressive, he sings in the accent. Nicole Kidman does an okay job playing the Italian movie star. Marian Cotillard restrains her French accent and seems to be going for a more American sound. Penelope Cruz is just herself. Strangely, Judi Dench doesn't attempt any accent other than her normal voice and her character is French. Altogether, a bit of a strange hodgepodge. I guess it's better for some to not even attempt an accent if they can't do one. Hearing the actor's normal voice helps you forget they should have an accent. If they did a bad one, you'd never hear past it.

Daniel Day Lewis is very good as Guido. At every moment, you can see and feel the world crashing in on him. Forced to attend a news conference to announce the new film, he tries to joke, to flirt, to laugh, all in an effort to hide the fact he hasn't written one word of the script yet. He basically has no idea what the new film should be about. When members of the press get close to unveiling the truth, he flees to the spa.

When he is presented with the opportunity to make a change in life, he seems close to taking these leaps, but ultimately the change seems to hard for him and he reverts back to normal. This only serves to drive his crisis.

I think it is brave of Day-Lewis to take on this role. We have never seen him sing or dance before and he does a good job with the singing. When he breaks out into song, he retains his accent, never letting it falter.

Either his dancing wasn't up to the task, or his musical numbers just weren't designed to involve elaborate dance moves. His dancing resembles what kids would do on a jungle gym on the playground. Hoe holds onto bars and swings around them in large, lazy circles and slides his feet around.

The film is set in Italy in the mid 60s. This gives the film a beautiful look; everything appears romantic and almost fantasy like.

If you're a fan of the genre, I hope you will make an effort to see this film. If we don't support these works, Hollywood will stop making them. I can already tell you the names of two producers who will most likely never produce another musical again.",1263513600,126,9493,4.566980023501762
3573837,3,B001FB55OE,"Nine is about an Italian director in need of inspiration for his next film. It's also about his saucy costumer. And his fiery mistress. And his provocative childhood. And his long-suffering wife. And his issues with religion. It is to the film's chief detriment that lauded director Rob Marshall abandoned the sleek craftsmanship of Chicago, and instead seemed to throw everything in the story up on screen at once, add in a ton of talent, and expected it to come out clean. It doesn't. Nine is a quality musical on the Broadway stage, but here is a mish-mash of thoughts, feelings and scenes that have no central cohesion. Its disappointment is amplified by its incredibly gifted cast, who here give merely adequate performances (except for Penelope Cruz- yowza). I'd like to think that the film would lead more people to become interested in an important B-way musical, but the film is just too messy and confused for it's own good and lacks the entertainment value and/or emotional heft of more successful musicals that dwarf it by comparison. Brilliant design and cinematography anyways.",1263254400,,1091,5.0
3573838,2,B001FB55OE,"I expected a lot out of this movie, between Rob Marshall, Daniel Day-Lewis and the assortment of actresses, but it left me cold. I just read all four other customer reviews, and Doug I have to say, yours was so thought-provoking and perceptive - and I'd say brilliant. You really hit every nail on the head, esp. regarding Marshall. I just get the sense you liked it a little more than I did - and that what you disliked bothered me a little more than it did you.

I'd still like to see ""8-1/2,"" and it was helpful to have all that backstory. I also wish I'd seen the Broadway production with Raul Julia. In fact I was just looking to see if I could find a tape of that when I came across these reviews.

I just wish I'd read reviews before I went to see the movie. Normally I try to, but this one sold itself with the cast, who unfortunately weren't used to their potential. Part of the ""cinema"" experience is the icons of film, such as Daniel Day-Lewis, Judi Dench, Sophia Loren! And the others have their own various degrees of celebrity and talent. So I wouldn't go so far as to say they should've cast no-names with a higher level of musical talent - although on Broadway that could've worked (ex. for the Guido role). It just needed to be a different kind of movie.",1262476800,6,1271,4.291666666666667
3573839,5,B001FB55OE,"Went to see it today and loved every minute of it.  The big belting songs, the costumes, the wonderful Italian scenery backdrop.  Everything about this film was right for me.  If you love a musical you'll love this.

Be Italian!!",1262476800,3,229,4.65
3573840,3,B001FB55OE,"Daniel Day Lewis already played this part. Back in 1988 he starred in The Unbearable Lightness of Being, another film about a detached womanizer attempting to make some kind of existential sense out of his chaotic modern life. In that film Day Lewis's character desires two very different kinds of lives. On the one hand, he desires a life of lightness and he cultivates a no-strings-attached ethos that allows him to move in and out of other people's lives without any kind of commitment or complication; and, on the other hand, he fears the weightlessness of this itinerant existence and so he is slowly drawn into a long-term attachment that lends his life a weight that it otherwise lacks. He moves from one extreme to another, but ultimately finds no satisfactory way to reconcile his competing desires. The book, written by Milan Kundera, and the film, directed by Philip Kaufman, are comic and tragic in equal measures. I would recommend The Unbearable Lightness of Being as an alternative to Nine as it really explores the same themes in a much more satisfying way.

As for Nine, it's a big tease.

I'm a big fan of Fellini and art film maestros in general, and I'm also a big fan of Marion Cotillard and Penelope Cruz (two of the finest actresses of world cinema). I also happen to be a fan of Daniel Day Lewis (perhaps the finest actor of the last thirty years). So, despite heavy suspicion about this project (a musical version of Fellini's mysterious and moody surreal self-portrait 8 1/2 ?), I had at least four compelling reasons to see this film. Unfortunately, everything that is good about the film (the Fellini references and quotes, the aura of Cinecitta, the excitement of several rare talents working together on a potentially larger-than-life project) is compromised by everything that is second-rate (the loud and gaudy in-your-face musical assaults that feel more like homages to Tom Jones or the Pussycat Dolls than they do to Fellini, the tedious early sixties men's magazine caricatures of women as nothing more than lingerie models, the lame song titles & lyrics.)

The original 8 1/2 was at times a dialogue between Fellini's private reality and his various publics, and at other times a lyrical soliloquy--it was a profound statement about self and cinema. Although it was Marcello Mastroianni onscreen it was understood that the thoughts and fantasies were Fellini's. In Nine, however, Daniel Day Lewis is simply pretending to be a maestro but we never feel like Rob Marshall is saying much of anything through the character. The point of the original 8 1/2 was to examine artistic, identity, and social crisis in post-War Italy and the film is powerful because it documents crisis albeit in an often charming and alluring way. In Nine, Rob Marshall re-creates the look of 8 1/2 but not the feel of it nor the content of it. Rob Marshall is less interested in and does not attempt to convey the substance of Fellini's universe; what excites him is not really Fellini but Italian style. The whole film therefore feels like one of those Vanity Fair fashion spreads where fashion models strut nostalgically down memory lane in period dress. Casting Daniel Day Lewis was an inspired move because Daniel Day Lewis brings to the film something that Marshall lacks: artistic depth & credibility. And admittedly it is exciting seeing Day Lewis attempt to play an Italian director. Day Lewis is certainly very good at showing what artistic and personal crisis look and feel like; however, we never get a sense of him as a visionary director and so it's very difficult to accept him, the consumate actor, as Fellini, the consumate director. Fellini succeeded when he allowed us to accompany him as he transformed fantasies into realities and realities into fantasies. But here, on the Nine set, there is no auteur at work. The whole thing feels more like a folly than an artistic production. In 8 1/2 Fellini viewed filmmaking as an expensive folly but the miracle of that film was that out of all that folly came art. In Nine the folly never crystallizes into anything nor does it seem to be trying to: Day Lewis seems to have a good time exploiting the absurdity of the situation (he and Cruz work especially well together), and Marshall seems to enjoy tranforming a Fellini movie into Fosse movie. I suppose you could say this craziness is admirable, in a way. 8 1/2 may have inspired the original stage production but the similarities are ultimately more cosmetic than thematic. Marshall is obviously less interested in Fellini or art than he is in extravaganza and spectacle and getting away with spending other people's money (and using other people's ideas) so as far as he is concerned all that Day Lewis has to do is prowl around the sets like a trapped cat (in Italian suits and sunglasses) and he's got what he wants. When he's prowling or speeding around dodging paparazzi in his white sports car Day Lewis is an asset (and Marshall's idea of an artist); when he's singing, however, he's a liability. It's not a great performance nor even a very interesting one (it doesn't capture the imagination in the way that Cate Blanchett's Bob Dylan did a few years ago). 8 1/2 revived Fellini's career, Nine may end Marshall's; but no one can say Day Lewis doesn't look good in black suits with skinny ties.

Cotillard is the best thing about this film--both Cotillard the actress and the character that she plays in the film seem like the real visionary if by visionary we mean the one who sees and shares what they see. She's the one with voice and vision and talent to burn. When she is onscreen the film has voice and vision and soul. The problem is there is far too little of her.

If director Rob Marshall's intention was to make all of the scenes without Marion Cotillard seem superficial, and, yes, directionless, then he succeeds brilliantly.

Fergie brings the raw heat she is famous for; Penelope Cruz is brilliant as a mistress with multiple dimensions; Kate Hudson is convincing as a reporter who uses her sex kitten charms to get what she wants; Nicole Kidman delivers as a film icon weary of the icon game but all of these cameos feel like nothing more than that. All of these women are aware of themselves, they all know who they are and what they want. They are sexually free yet dependent on Guido (or at least in Guido's fantasy world they are all dependent on Guido). Why Guido Contini wants all of these women is no mystery, but why they should all want or need him is.

Each of the actresses emit momentary sparks, but only Cotillard generates and sustains any kind of heat that lasts for more than a song and dance number.

Like many Broadway musicals, this one feels more like a batch of loosely affiliated songs randomly flung together than a tightly plotted narrative with any real force. The allure of Fellini is that, however fantastic, the plots always seem natural; the films seem to have a life, an energy, a momentum and a spirit all their own. In Marshall's film however the plot feels contrived for obvious reasons (the film's a remake of a musical that is itself a remake of a film). Some postmodern irony --ie Marshall acknowledging that he is re-making someone else's autobiographical film--or some kind of explanation/rationalization as to why a classic art film would benefit from the addition of musical numbers might have helped matters a bit (although if it were done well I suppose we wouldn't need to ask). I kept thinking, hoping the musical numbers would be moments when the women asserted their own individuality, but (Cotillard's character excepted) most of these women do not want to assert their independence from Guido Contini any more than Rob Marshall wants to assert his independence from the stage show format/formula (that worked in Chicago but doesn't work here) which is the only guiding force at work here, and that's a problem that this film never finds a way to address.

Fellini treated glamour (i.e. style, film magic) as a kind of momentary or pretend grace, but it was never presented as a substitute for the real thing--hence there is always an existential void gnawing away at his characters; I think Rob Marshall is trying to do the same thing--find momentary grace in art--but, although some of the individual performances are as graceful as anything found in a Fellini (or a Fosse) film, the film itself lacks any style or grace or vision of its own.",1261958400,14,8445,4.782727895819054
