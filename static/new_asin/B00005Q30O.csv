7949485,3,B00005Q30O,"The reviews and marketing aren't entirely accurate.  This is NOT some dark, FATAL ATTRACTION film noir.  It's a curiously mild and tepid film.

GLASS, NECKTIE (why the comma in the title?) looks to be shot on grainy, black & white 16mm film, on a very low budget.  The acting ranges from poor to good.

Story is about infidelity, and I expected a noir thriller full of blackmail, betrayals, insurance scams, and possibly murder.  But this is a very mild film.

SPOILER WARNING:

A man cheats with another man's wife.  Then he discovers that the husband knew this, and was hiding behind a two-way mirror, watching.

The husband's brother doesn't know this, so he gets revenge by placing a razor blade behind a garage door handle, cutting the cheater's hand.

A cut hand.  That's this film's greatest peril.

Yes, there's cheating.  But most of the characters know, or soon learn, most of what's going on.  Everyone's gossiping about it, filling everyone else in.

Rather than a film noir, this is a 1990s relationship film (it was shot in 1997), with everyone discussing cheating and guilt and relationships, etc.

The cheater with the cut hand takes ""revenge"" merely by telling the husband what a creep he is for hiding behind the mirror, then tells off the brother for being a jerk for cutting his hand.

The marketing on the DVD box makes this appear to be a dark, murderous thriller.  It's not.

I bought GLASS, NECKTIE because it has Nancye Ferguson, who was in David Lynch's ON THE AIR, a 7-episode sitcom from the early 1990s.

Ferguson was more interesting in the Lynch sitcom, playing a quirky, upbeat character.  In GLASS, NECKTIE, her character is flatter.

Yet GLASS, NECKTIE is offbeat and unusual, mostly due to its low budget, and being a black & white 16mm film.  That's odd for a film shot in 1997.

Who'd enjoy this film?  Fans of indie films that are offbeat, yet tame.  Unusual, but not bizarre.

This DVD also contains an 18 minute, color short film by the same director.  An unusual piece about an unmotivated (as near as I can see) murder.",1216425600,,2061,4.69467787114846
7949486,4,B00005Q30O,"A sexy thriller in the vein of FATAL ATTRACTION, this compelling, frightening film follows a man whose cheating heart gets him in more trouble than he ever imagined. In GLASS, NECKTIE, a married man becomes carnally involved with a beautiful young woman who happens to be his best friend's brother's wife. Quickly caught up in a web of kink and voyeurism, this infidel must get out before it's too late.",1119484800,,403,4.771428571428571
7949487,4,B00005Q30O,"A thoughtful, well-paced film that leaves you thinking.  Much better than the cover would indicate.  This is the real thing as far as independent film.  Nicely shot and scripted.",1018137600,4,178,5.068965517241379
