762689,3,6304039441,Warner's idea of continuing to produce large budget town taming Westerns was something of a myth by the time this film was released in 1950. The idea was old and the film even looks older than it is because of it save for the John Twist's script and Stuat Heisler's direction. The film's opening shootout was a clever piece of scripting and the idea of Gary Cooper and Leif Erickson switching identities is well executed. These are good techniques that enhance the characters but not the plot. The basic premise of cleaning up a Western town is still filmed with very little innovation in standard pre-1950 Hollywood style.,1012003200,,623,4.777777777777778
762690,3,6304039441,"DALLAS is a routine action/western, the sort of thing John Wayne did in his sleep for Republic throughout the forties. And why shouldn't Coop be permitted to amble through this sort of stuff? And amble he does, looking  terrific in his tan buckskin shirt, every inch the hero. The movie is never  boring and it zips merrily along, from one action sequence to the next,  pausing for an occasional breath so that Cooper and Ruth Roman can set up  their eventual kiss at the end. I agree with the previous two reviews that  Max Steiner's score is fabulous (far better than the film deserves, truth  be told). I also agree that Steiner's score for THE HANGING TREE is  ""utterly sublime"". Not only isn't the score out on CD, but Warner  Home Video has taken THE HANGING TREE out of distribution here in the U.S.  Not overseas, just here! What idiocy! Furthermore, why?",953510400,7,863,4.625
762691,3,6304039441,"DALLAS is another example of how Warner Bros. had no idea how to use Gary Cooper during his six picture stint with them from 1948 to 1953. Though DALLAS is a servicable western, it plays more like something Randolph Scott  or Joel McCrae should have done. There's nothing particularly terrible -- a  nice professional cast, an underrated Max Steiner score, even the script at  times provides punch (in fact, in the early going, it shows promise of  being a light-hearted comedy western, like ALONG CAME JONES, also directed  by Stuart Heisler), but the whole exercise seems tired. And Cooper looked  just as tired in some scenes. Of the westerns he did for Warners in this  period, only SPRINGFIELD RIFLE (with an especially resonant and evocative  Max Steiner score; question: why isn't this soundtrack out on CD?) clearly  stands out. And yet, Cooper went on to star in four of the finest westerns  ever made after this: HIGH NOON, MAN OF THE WEST, THE HANGING TREE (another  question: why isn't Steiner's utterly sublime score for THE HANGING TREE  out on CD!), and VERA CRUZ. So it is obvious that the problem wasn't  Cooper, it was the powers-that-be at Warner Bros. They wasted a very good  actor!",952732800,,1203,4.804878048780488
762692,4,6304039441,"It must have come as quite a shock when Gary Cooper received the script for his fourth starring vehicle under the Warner's contract he'd signed in 1948. After three classy features(""The Fountainhead"",""Task  Force"",and ""Bright Leaf"")with first-rate directors(King  Vidor,Delmer Daves,and Michael Curtiz),""Dallas"" was a distinct  comedown. It had been announced for Errol Flynn(also on the wane by this  time),but Cooper was assigned at the eleventh hour. The studio's choice of  journeyman Stuart Heisler to direct was hardly a vote of confidance  either. If you look at Cooper's gag cameo in the previous year's ""It's  A Great Feeling"",you can get a pretty good idea of how the star was  regarded by his new employers. The appearance is brief---Cooper is carelessy  photographed(at a time when his age was starting to betray him),and the  exchange with Dennis Morgan trades on the old ""yup"" and  ""nope"" routine that had dogged him since the beginning of his  career----two decades of fine performances had taken him way beyond that  insulting cliche,yet here he was,engaging in a self-parody that had to  hurt. Unfortunatly for Cooper,""Dallas"" is more of the same. There  is Technicolor,though it doesn't flatter him(his hair looks almost orange  at times,even in original dye-transfer prints),and the whole thing has a  slapdash,backlot feel about it. So my recommendation?You must get this  movie! It's practically a textbook on the declining careers of the pre-war  generation of great leading men---a fallow period in the late forties when  youngsters like Gregory Peck,Burt Lancaster,and Robert Mitchum were getting  the really intresting parts,while the veteran  stars---Gable,Flynn,Cooper---were having to make do in studio product that  made no allowance for changing times,or the leading man's advancing  age(s).Gary Cooper is fabulous in ""Dallas""---you can tell he's  making the best of a bad job. He's winging dialogue,peppering dull scenes  with quirky mannerisms----in short,making plenty out of nothing---getting a  lemon,and giving us lemonade. Watch for his introductary scene---it's a  classic---and only Cooper could make it look so good----burning that wanted  poster and lighting his cigar---yeah! His leading lady is Ruth Roman---oh  well,I guess that's where Warner's saved some money---after all,Coop didn't  come cheap. For the record,""Dallas"" had a negative cost of 1.390  million,and final worldwide rentals were 4.490 million,so Cooper in a  western was still boxoffice----it's just a shame WB didn't think enough of  him to put a little more effort into the piece. I still love it though---and  what a kick to see Raymond Massey in a seedy land-grabber villain role(and  Steve Cochran's his brother!)---bet Massey loved telling that one to his  lunch companions at the Player's Club. Barbara Payton's there too---read her  sleazy auto-bio,watch this movie---and think about it. There's lots to like  in ""Dallas""---a great(and I mean GREAT)Max Steiner score---a  priceless scene where Cooper masquerades as a ""dude""---and a sock  finish when he finally corners Massey.""High Noon"" was a year  away,but if you wanna know the truth,this one's actually more fun.",951868800,26,3185,5.591194968553459

762893,3,6304039441,"""Dallas"" (1950) is one of those revenge dramas that are so popular among westerns. Similar films include ""The Searchers"" (1956) in which the Duke hunts down the Indians who killed his brother and family and kidnapped his niece,  ""The Bravados"" (1958) in which Gregory Peck hunts the men who killed his wife, and ""Hang em High"" (1968) in which Clint Eastwood hunts down the men who tried to hang him. In this case, a Confederate officer (Gary Cooper) hunts down the brothers (Raymond Massey, Steve Cochran) who killed his family.

Gary Cooper (1901-61) is a film icon, ranked #11 in AFI's list of 100 top male stars.  Nominated 5 times for an Oscar, he won twice (""Sergeant York"" and ""High Noon""). His films were in the top 10 box office 18 times between 1936 and 1957, a record surpassed only by John Wayne. Despite appearing in a variety of films, Cooper is best remembered for his westerns (""The Plainsman"", ""The Westerner"", ""Vera Cruz"", ""High Noon"", ""Man of the West"")

Beautiful and sultry Ruth Roman (1922-99) is best remembered for her Golden Globe nominated role in ""Champion"" (1949). She made 50+ films before transitioning to TV in the late 50s where she had recurring roles in ""The Long Hot Summer"" (1965-6), ""Gunsmoke"" (1969-71), ""Knotts Landing"" (1986-7) and ""Murder She Wrote"" (1987-9).

The great Raymond Massey (1896-1983) plays a real estate magnet with a clouded past. Massey is best remembered for his roles as Lincoln in ""Abe Lincoln in Illinois"" (1940), ""The Day Lincoln was Shot"" (1950) and ""How the West Was Won"" (1962). On TV he played Dr. Gillespie in the series ""Dr Kildare"" (1961-5). He made nearly 100 films. I remember him best for his over the top portrayal of John Brown in ""Santa Fe Trail"" (1940).

Dark and handsome Steve Cochran (1917-65) debuted in ""Wonder Man"" (1945) as a heavy and did such a good job he continued to be the heavy in dozens of films. I remember him best as James Cagney's treacherous sidekick from ""White Heat"" (1949). He claimed -  ""The big secret in playing a gangster in movies is to really believe that the character you are playing is doing no wrong.""

Stuart Heisler (1896-1979) directs. He made a dozen or so films between 1936 and 1956 and then transitioned to TV where he worked on westerns like ""Rawhide"" and ""Lawman"".

Between 1935 and 1956 Austrian composer Max Steiner (1888-1971) was nominated for an Oscar 19 times, and won for ""Since You Went Away"" (1944), ""Now Voyager"" (1942), and ""The Informer"" (1935). He was so well known that he appeared on a 33 cent stamp (1999) along with Dimitri Tiomkin and Alfred Newman.

1950 was a good year for films with Oscars for ""All About Eve"" (Picture, Director, Supporting Actor), ""Cyrano"" (Actor) and ""Born yesterday"" (Actress).  The top grossers included ""Cinderella"", ""King Solomon's Mines"", ""Annie Get Your Gun"" and ""Sunset Boulevard"". Other notable films released in 1950 were -  ""The Asphalt Jungle"", ""Cheaper by the Dozen"", ""The Glass Menagerie"", ""Rashomon"", ""The Third Man"", and ""Twelve O'Clock High"". Westerns were popular with films like ""Ambush"", ""Broken Arrow"", ""The Gunfighter"" and ""Winchester 73"".

The NY Times' Bosley Crowther said ""Except for a few clever ""gimmicks"" that are dropped here and there in the tale, this is one of those two-gun-man horse operas that comes right down from William S. Hart.""

Dallas is a pretty good B western, but that's all it is. Cooper had done work in many other westerns, as have Massey and Cochran.",1311206400,,3457,4.867120954003407
762894,5,6304039441,"Dallas is one of those unique movies, with a great cast of stars,lead by Gary Cooper.

762896,4,6304039441,"I just finished reading the reviews for Dallas, and most of them are not very flattering. Overall, I think Dallas is a pretty solid Western. The plot is decent (although a little goofy at times), and the action moves along nicely. Gary Cooper makes a fine cowboy and was one of the best leading men in Hollywood at the time this file was made. Although Dallas may not be as exciting as other Westerns, it is worth watching, especially if you like Gary Cooper. Hardly a classic, but not as bad as some of the other reviewers make it out to be.",1279324800,,542,4.323529411764706
762897,5,6304039441,"I never heard of this movie until just before I ordered it. What a find. This is the B Western at its best (it's officially a B Western because one short scene is used twice). Coop is at his raucous best. Raymond Massey as the bad guy really plays it up. As for Ruth Roman, when she runs up to the returning Gary Cooper and says, ""Reb, you've come back, you're safe"", well, If I were Coop, I would have married her on the set right there. It kind of reminds me of Marilyn saying ""I'd go anywhere with you now"" in Bus Stop. At one point Miss Roman  wears a green and white outfit that is plain but very fetching.

There is enough action to satisfy any western fan. At the beginning Coop shoots it out with Wild Bill. How is that possible since Coop is the star and Wild Bill never got shot before Deadwood? I'll never tell. Get the movie to find out. Classy and almost over the top at the same time. In fact, this movie skirts the edge of over-the-top several times to wonderful effect.

My favorite line is from Raymond Massey when he is talking about his brother who is always causing him trouble - ""He's trying to put the blight on me"".

I think this may turn out to be one of my top 10 favorite westerns.",1238716800,14,1207,4.145299145299146

762899,5,6304039441,"I am a perennial western fan. I recently watched DALLAS starring Gary Cooper,Leif Erikson,Ruth Roman, Raymond Massey, and Steve Cochran. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Roman is a member of a wealthy Spanish family and a gorgeous,smart, and independent woman of the west for the most part. Cooper is a former Confederate Colonel with a reward on his head but a man on a mission post-Civil War seeking justice for the gruesome death and destruction of his family at the hands of the despicable Marlowe Brothers played by Massey and Cochran. After the war they are continually wreaking havoc with decent ranchers and farmers stealing cattle and land. Erikson plays a fish out of water US Marshal from the East in a misguided attempt to impress Roman's character so that she will marry him. Of course he is no match for the man of action, strong and relatively silent ""Coop"".DALLAS is fast paced with a laissez-affaire attitude toward whether the story was executed semi-seriously or semi-humourously. In any event it works. Just like in real life. It is an old fashioned,hero on horseback, gun blazing,exciting chases(outlaws after the hero and the posse after the hero),great stunts(appears to be Cooper or Jock O'Mahoney,but well done), and competition for the girl among the protaganists(Cooper and Erikson).
Massey is mean and nasty as the main villian. The only thing missing is a black top hat. The handsome and tough(like Robert Mitchum) Steve Cochran, who usually played a tough  in urban crime dramas of the 50's is barely recognizable because of the southern confederate cap he wears and a great handlebar mustache. He is agressive and reckless in his manner and equally up to Massey's ruthlessness,but he isn't the brains of the outfit obviously. I highly recommend DALLAS for your Western library. This is a fun movie to watch.

762901,3,6304039441,"Dallas was made after Gary Cooper had appeared in The Plainsman and the Westerner, but before High Noon and his later Westerns, where Cooper was an older, serious, and sober sort.

In Dallas, Cooper is only occasionally serious and sober. He plays former Confederate raider Blayde ""Reb"" Hollister, whose life in Georgia suffered at the hands of brothers who are stealing cattle around Dallas. The brothers are played by Raymond Massey and Steve Cochran. Hollister, wanted as a fugitive, masquerades as a dandified US Marshal from up north, the real identity of hapless Leif Erickson, playing a much different character than he did almost twenty years later in The High Chapparal television series.

There is some good things here, a good, and at times, hilarious script by John Twist, and fine performances all around. But there is a lot of silliness, like the opening sequence when Hoolister pretends to be killed by Wild Bill Hickok. Hickok never really gives a good reason why he's playing along with Hollister. And the masquerading as Erickson, particularly when his fiancee, played by Ruth Roman, is involved.

Maybe the idea was that Dallas would be action with a lot of laughs. Maybe Dallas would have been better with less laughs and a more straightforward story.",1164067200,2,1271,5.014218009478673

7859347,3,6304039441,"Who knew that this would be a comedy? Surely this must be one of the prime places Mel Brooks found inspiration for Blazing Saddles? Gary Cooper has never been a favourite of mine, and this movie just reinforces that feeling. He has one expression through the entire film . . . his horse has more charisma than he does. I bought it because it also stars Ruth Roman & Steve Cochran. But they were not enough to salvage a movie that suffered from an outright silly plot that bordered on being nonsensical, a poor script, and all-round perfunctory acting. Those who place it on their top 10 movie list on IMDB really need to get out more! An ordinary movie that, if not for the high camp comedy, would have been a waste of 90 minutes.",1492214400,,730,4.375
