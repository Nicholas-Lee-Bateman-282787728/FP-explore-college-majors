1806747,2,B00007CVVR,"I thought this would be an art history product with primary focus on the architecture, stained glass and statuary. Instead, much of the disc is devoted to discussion of the spirituality of the cathedral, how it makes one feel. A fair amount of the 1-hour DVD is spent on showing a speaker's head and shoulders rather than showning the building.
The ""editorial review"" shown on this site actually is the blurb from the back of the box.",1045699200,48,434,4.64935064935065
1806768,5,B00007CVVR,"This is not a straight historical movie, so if that is what you are looking for as a viewer, then this may not be the best movie to watch. It is beautifully done. The camera work is high-quality, the narration is easy to follow, and the objective and subjective qualities of such a monument to faith are well covered. There are many topics covered about Christianity, but also how the cathedral was built with the 7 scared chakras in mind. Overall it is a very interesting documentry.",1213660800,6,484,4.574712643678161
1806769,2,B00007CVVR,"The photography is good.  Some of the architectural explanations--the sheer mysteries of Chartres--were fascinating.  But much of the rest is inane babble, featuring discussions of reaching silence, finding the self, and arriving at the center of the labyrinth. New Age thought receives more attention than Catholic Christianity and the Middle Ages.  We even get a lecture on the similarities between the architecture and Hinduism!  In short, this film was worth neither the time nor the money.",1196035200,6,494,5.4605263157894735

1806771,5,B00007CVVR,"I will be visiting France and Chartres on a pilgrimage in May. I got the DVD in anticipation of that.

I felt compelled to write this review in support of the DVD after seeing a couple of very negative and false reviews posted here. They said that the DVD did not present the history of Chartres Cathedral - IT DID! They said too much time was spent with the narrator - Wrong!!  There were several narrators and guides, all giving wonderful insights into aspects of the Cathedral.

As one of the narrators/guides/authors (Malcolm Miller) pointed out; entering Chartres is like entering a library. You shouldn't expect to be able to read all the books in the library in one visit.  Chartres is a visual library, and it too can't be read and absorbed in one visit, particularly just 60 minutes in a DVD. The DVD, did an excellent job in the time it had, and left me wanting more. I appreciated the preview this gave for my visit.",1174089600,12,927,4.5
1806772,5,B00007CVVR,"When I read several of the negative reviews here, I am struck by how they miss the whole point of the film and essentially the whole point of the cathedral. This documentary, which I find simply breathtaking in its detailed analysis of the meaning of Chartres, reinforces something that is so lacking in our time- a sense and remembrance of what is sacred. The various scholars who are interviewed for this film reiterate this key frame of mind that was present in the builders and worshippers of the 12th Century. They knew what it meant to worship God and find God present in all things and in all places.  That is the whole point, and they directed their mostly anonymous toil and craftsmanship to this end- the remembrance and experience of the sacred.

Not only does this DVD give breathtaking tours of Chartres, it is accompanied by a high degree of historical and theological scholarship that clearly and profoundly explains the methods and purpose behind its higly symbolic design. Certainly worth five stars!

See also the VHS ""Cathedral"" by Macaulay and the most excellent book, ""Building the Great Cathedrals"" by Francois Icher! You won't be disappointed.

Enjoy!",1159660800,41,1174,4.944162436548224

1806777,5,B00007CVVR,"I love this DVD!

I hope someday I can see Chartres Cathedral for myself, but for now, I am thrilled to have found this DVD. I had no idea about the sacred geometry involved in the construction of a medieval cathedral, the direct relationship of its proportions to the proportions of the human body, and so much more.

It's exciting and provocative to realize that people in medieval times had  a wealth of knowledge that we have lost in our scientific, materialistic era. They understood that there is another dimension to life beyond what we can grasp with our senses, and they managed to incorporate this knowledge into their sacred architecture. The deep faith which drove their loving, intentionally anonymous work may have been largely left behind in the intervening centuries, but we still yearn for something beyond what our day to day lives offer. And entering into an ancient cathedral like Chartres affects many people in unexpected and deeply profound ways. Can the spiritual concepts which informed the architecture have something to do with this reaction?

I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who is fascinated by the spiritual dimensions of the architecture of Chartres, or of medieval cathedrals in general; and also to anyone who simply wants to get a close look at one of one of the most awesome buildings in the world.",1074297600,57,1339,4.911504424778761

7975277,5,B00007CVVR,"This is a very good presentation of Chartres Cathedral, which is as far as academia in modernity can go.  I love the part where the curator tells the story of an Indian (Hindu) priest toured Chartres and points out that the central aspects of the West Facade (Royal Portal) lays out the symbolism of the Seven Charkas where the Kundalini rises.  This symbolism is esoterically codified in the first four chapters of Genesis twice.  That portion I loved so much because it validated my esoteric studies.

This video is really too expensive and I would not recommend anybody paying that kind of a price.  I paid about $30.00 if that much.  The greed that is in the hearts of some people.  The people that put this video out should reissue it for a fairer price.

If you really want to study Chartres Cathedral study the fires from 1020-1836 and look at the overall symbolic pattern.  It is a magnificent presentation of the soul burning through the materialism that enamors the psyche.  The fires symbolizes FAITH.  Dante Alighieri in his trilogy La Divina Commedia, 27th chapter of Purgatorio talks about this wall of flames that has to be traverse before one enters the Garden of Eden.  THE CATHOLIC CHURCH IS THE GARDEN OF EDEN.  Chartres Cathedral complete is symbolically THE GARDEN OF EDEN.",1423958400,,1294,4.774774774774775

7975281,1,B00007CVVR,"I had hoped to see beautiful pictures of the inside and outside of this wonderful cathedral. There is some of that, but mostly we are subjected to interviews with experts who go off in all sorts of mystical directions and actually tell us very little about the history and construction of the building itself. One Brit, for example, says he's studied Chartres for 34 years (which explains why he's still an assistant professor), but he wanders into theology when he should be talking about architecture. Unfortunately, he looks so bizarre (a cocked eye and woolly-worm eyebrows) that we're distracted by his looks rather than focusing on what he has to say. One wonders why we have to look at him at all; his voice could easily be background for detailed shots of the cathedral. Another maven says it all in French, with a translator. Ordinary things seem to be wonderful (the apse is 365 feet long, just the same number of days in the year, isn't that something? or the height of the rose window is 28 feet - which is just the same number of days as the lunar month!). Better to leave these gasbags at home and simply use the hour going over the details of the building, which is what I wanted to see in the first place. We have about ten minutes of that and the rest is devoted to musings by these experts. Too bad.",1299801600,3,1317,4.491666666666666
7975282,1,B00007CVVR,"With the scribing of a few circles followed by the offhanded identification of some basic architectural relationships within the building, voil!, this movie superficially touches upon its premise, ""sacred geometry"" and then takes flight into history, spiritualism, and dreadfully amateur choral music. Truth be told, this movie is a paen to religion and thus almost completely ignores the actual science, tradition and craftsmanship that informed the builders of yore.

Most of its material is built upon the moviemaker's interviews with three gentlemen: Malcom Miller, a respected Chartres scholar, Keith Critchlow, an arts & architecture lecturer, and the dean of the cathedral. Miller is filmed at his best: lecturing tour groups about the history of the cathedral. When pulled aside, to his credit, he refuses to take the interviewer's bait to ascribe divine control over the builder's actions. Critchlow, however, happily devours the bait and delivers a tour de force of speculation only to be surpassed by the blathering pronouncements by the cathedral's dean who in the final minutes of this film manages, offensively, to cast the specter of AIDS as a symbol of unbelief.

This movie is trivializing drivel. Avoid.",1292716800,4,1221,5.421052631578948
7975283,5,B00007CVVR,"I'M ALWAYS AMAZED WITH THE PERFECTION THAT CAN BE ACHIEVED.
I REALLY ENJOY THE ACCURACY IN ANY PROJECT.

First of all I'd like to invite you to read my review on the book "" Pillars of the earth""

I first got interested in the symmetry of the architectural wonders and bought the video of the Cathedral and really gives you another perspective regarding the ability of the master constructors of the time.

Something that's really mind gobbling is the use of astrological measures as the distance to the Moon or the Sun or the proportions (Perfect Symmetry) of the Human body and how they were able to apply all those measures into the construction of perfectly symmetrical architectural wonders that are a ""MUST SEE"" during our lifetimes.

It's interesting to note that they show the way the MASTERS were able to pass their instructions to the workers (With out blue prints) and how they had to use their inventive potential to make durable blue prints alike to instruct the rest of the crew.

If you enjoy the accuracy in action, the documentary is going to impress you.",1252713600,2,1071,4.705882352941177

7975285,5,B00007CVVR,"If you have had the experience of praying or sitting quietly for any period of time in the great English or European cathedrals you will understand what this dvd is trying to communicate. If you have not had that experience, then this dvd will serve as something of a teaser. This is a very useful film if you are interested in architecture, sacred art, medieval studies or even general spirituality. The sound quality and image are perfect, and you really get a sense of being in a sacred space dedicated to bringing both heaven to earth and earth to heaven. At a time when the vast majority of people could not read, the cathedral functioned as a sort of book, with the windows and statuary being the text, the masonry being the binding. Its story is that of ourselves, from the creation to the last judgment when we will be judged not only for our own lives, but also for the rippling effects that our lives have had upon the world until that last Day, the beginning of the Eighth Day of our Lord.

Aside from the general technical aspects of medieval architecture, which are thoroughly covered, you will learn a great deal about the theological and astrological symbolism behind the form and function of the cathedral. Something that struck me was how the medieval builders at this time (12-13th century) based the proportions of their design upon the human body and the cycles of the moon and sun. You will come away with a very sound respect for the builders of the age. Just odd how skilled they were in calculating the forces of gravity and wind when they had never built anything like this before. The commentators in the film all posit that the designers were actually inspired by the Spirit of God and after studying Chartres for some time I would have to wonder if they are not right. I could go on and on about the symbolism, but just sit back and soak it in.
