3086408,4,B0012CJQXW,"Season 1 was pretty much what I expected from McMurtry. It was fun to watch, until the end, of course. Season 2 was dark, disappointing and, if it is historically correct in any way, I'm glad I didn't live in that period of time. I didn't like Newt by the time Season 2 was finished and, frankly, the series ended with a faint hope that he might find some reason to live and none too soon. I gave it 4 stars as a tribute to the work that came before this final sad story.

I watched all ten dvds in The Ultimate Collection of Lonesome Dove but found that the end of Volume 5, ""Love and War"", of The Outlaw Years (which was the last dvd in the collection) implied that there were more stories.  It left me wondering what happened to some of the players. I looked online but couldn't find any additional episodes.  Does anyone know if there are more?",1328659200,,539,4.6421052631578945

Having a very hard time to keep watching. AND THIS IS JUST THE FIRST DISK, 9 MORE TO GO, going to be a very looong series to get through. The women seem to have bigger balls then the men, and the men seems to be pussy whipped. I've seen a lot better and more action at the circus. Wish I had saved my money or had bought some real westerns. if it weren't for the name louis lamore, I would swear that this was written by a woman",1269993600,,510,3.8666666666666667
3086426,5,B0012CJQXW,"When this was on TV years ago, I looked forward to this every week even though I was not much of a western fan.  But this was an exception to the rule.  It is a real, down-to-earth series with romance and heart-wrenching situations of the old west. It could have been real life even though it is written as fiction.  This is one of the best western collections I've ever seen!  After one DVD, you just want to see more and more!  Totally addictive!  Don't miss this one.  This is the way a heart-warming western series should be made!  I totally loved it!",1266192000,,555,4.320388349514563

3086430,5,B0012CJQXW,This is exactly what we wanted.  Watched the series on TV several years ago and were happy to be able to own it now.  Great series of the old west.  We like it better than the Robert Duvall version.,1256169600,2,198,4.0256410256410255
3086431,3,B0012CJQXW,This is not the entire collection of Lonesome Dove that I was expecting. It is a different tv series more like Bonanza than the Mini-Series.,1252281600,,140,4.64

3086436,2,B0012CJQXW,"The first 5 DVDs are acceptable but the stories cannot be compared with the other Lonesome Dove productions at all.  The stories in the last 5 DVDs are very boring, and poorly written.  Most stories are loosely linked and the characters within the stories are inconsistent.  Especially with the ""Outlaw Years"" series in the last 5 DVDs, there were no more heroes in any episodes; just a group of disrespectful western frontiers, trying to survive.  Very disappointing stories, and acting!  I wish I had not bought this Ultimate Collection!",1249430400,10,539,5.01123595505618
3086437,4,B0012CJQXW,"My husband and I love Western movies and have quite a collection of some really good ones.  One of the best is Larry McMurtry's ""Lonesome Dove"" and we love watching it.  Neither one of us was aware of this television series inspired by the characters of Lonesome Dove, but we've really grown to enjoy it.  It picks up the story of Newt Call when he settles in the little town of Curtis Wells, Montana.  The first half of the disks are a bit too saccharine for my tastes, though the writing and acting is still good.  But the stories get a little grittier and the characters change a bit in the second half, ""The Outlaw Years.""  It's given us a great deal of enjoyment, watching a disk every Sunday afternoon for the past several weeks.  I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoyed Lonesome Dove.",1247788800,,792,4.458333333333333
3086438,3,B0012CJQXW,I traded this set in twice so I had this set three times. All three sets had factory defects. They froze in spots and also skipped ahead in other spots. I finally gave up. I like the series but it was not worth it because of all the defects.,1243036800,2,241,3.938775510204082
3086439,5,B0012CJQXW,"I enjoyed watching the TV Series when it was on the air. The network  put it on some horrible time slot at 2AM or 2:30 AM on Sunday morning.  Some times I would watch it and catch myself dozing off since it came on so early.

I did enjoy watching the TV Series. The networks kept changing the times it would come on. I had strong feeling they wanted to cancel it. The First TV Series ended with the explosion because it was going to be cancelled. Many fans wrote and complaining about the series being cancelled. It somehow it survived and came back as the outlaw years.  Although they did not even show the outlaw years on the network in my area.

I did buy both sets seperatetly and watched them back to back. I enjoy the TV Series more than the outlaw years.  I really liked Hannah and I did not like her character being killed off. I think they took the heart out of the series when she left. Her character gave it a softness and gentleness that the outlaw years just does not have. Since it came on so early in the morning many people never even saw it at all.

Get the series you will enjoy both of them. And viewing the hunk and a half gorgeous Eric McCormack on tv at 2AM was definelty a plus to. Wow! What a view!",1241222400,2,1222,4.1308016877637135

3086441,5,B0012CJQXW,"This is the best western series that television has ever made.. It takes up after Lonesome Dove, The Return, left off. Newt Call is on his own and sets off on a new venture in his life in a fictional town known as Curtis Wells. The characters in this show are all very talented  and the story lines are engrossing... I love the scenery and the brawn of an old western town.. This is a great show.. The Outlaw Years is even more interesting after Newt loses his wife in a tragic accident. He takes on a new image of vilolence and bitterness.. I really believe that anyone would enjoy this show.. the DVD includes both sets..",1235692800,2,623,4.3247863247863245
3086442,5,B0012CJQXW,"I can't recommend this series highly enough to lovers of the true Western experience. Set in 1880 Montana, this follows the life of Captain Woodrow Call's son, Newt.
You can essentially forget ""Lonesome Dove"" after about 1 or 2 episodes, as there is only a tenuous connection. Doesn't matter at all, since this series stands perfectly well on its own, and the further into it you get, the better you'll like it.
It is actually two distinct series; though the scenes, characters and actors are the same. Events have caused changes which create a very different Newt Call in the gritty rough second half, known as the ""Outlaw Years"".
The first episodes are sunny & bright, full of hope & promise, as were the early settlers dreams. And then ... well, buy the set and see for yourself!
I have NEVER spent better money for entertainment than this.
Do be sure to get the ""Ultimate Collection"" by Echo Bridge Home Entertainment, 10 DVDs - 43 episodes. The picture quality is great, sound is clear.",1232668800,10,991,4.7011494252873565
3086443,5,B0012CJQXW,"We really got hooked on the lives of these characters.  Had a couple Newt Call marathone tv nights.  Couldn't stop watching it, wanted to know what would happen next.  Was disapointed in the ending.  No conclusion to the characters lives.  Left you hanging.  Hoping we can find more video or book.  Recommend for family watching.",1231200000,2,329,4.872727272727273
3086444,5,B0012CJQXW,"I didn't get to see this series when it was on TV, but decided from other reviews that I would buy it. I have not been sorry. It has given my wife and myself a lot of enjoyable nights of watching. Sometimes the acting is a little melodramatic but for the most part it is really good.",1230508800,4,283,3.982456140350877

3086450,4,B0012CJQXW,"I'd been looking for Lonesome Dove: The Outlaw Years on DVD, and found some copies on the internet, but never got around to buy it. When I cruised Amazon a few weeks ago and saw this release, with both TV-series in it, to a very reasonable price, I was so happy! Finally I had both series on DVD. I was never so much of a fan of Lonesome Dove: The series as I was of LD: TOY, but now I think I love the first series even more. Hearing the opening music for LD: TS... I nearly cried. Nostalgic much?!

The reason I give this release 4 stars instead of 5, is because of a little thing called subtitles... (and some for not adding bonus material). As english is not my native (I am norwegian), and even though I speak it fairly well, I have some problems with some of the dialogue (Buffaly Bill, anyone?) so releasing this DVD-set with english subtitles (like, for the hearing impaired) would have been a MAJOR plus! But, as I've seen on most DVD releases for ""smaller 90's series"", subtitles are rarely added, so it's okay. But, for me, it drops the quality a little bit.

Still, a long-awaited release and I love it!",1218240000,6,1115,4.304761904761905

Now, almost every evening,my husband and I can't wait to see the next episode of Newt Call and his life in what was still the wild west. Newt is married to Hannah, and they have their differences, but they are young and in love and everything seems to work out for them. Each episode has an exciting plot and leaves you wanting to see what happens next! The photography in this series is every well as fine as it is in the 4 movies (that I know of). Maybe there are more than 4 and I just don't know about it! Highly recommended!!",1213142400,9,705,4.229629629629629

3086453,4,B0012CJQXW,"I am not particularly a western fan, but I do love Lonesome Dove the movie. Both ""The Series"" and ""The Outlaw Years"" were very engrossing and very enjoyable. For the most part, the stories and the characters carry you easily through spots of mediocre acting and directing and some, um, unusual filmmaking. The two series are quite different in tone and attitude. I let my seven year old watch ""The Series"", but not ""The Outlaw Years"" because of the increase in violence and change in the general mood.

You don't get to find out what happens at the end of ""The Series"" until the first episode of ""The Outlaw Years"". It seems they intentionally left it open-ended to keep their options open.

Then ""The Outlaw Years"" doen't 'end' at all. It just stops. Many developing threads are left hanging. It is as if it got cancelled mid-season.

Lastly, the DVD production is less than stellar. The navigation is strange and the numbering and labeling on the DVDs is inconsistent or non-existent, but nothing that can't be worked out.

Bottom line: Sometimes odd in its production, but completely worth watching.",1207267200,41,1102,4.814814814814815

It is a real, down-to-earth series with romance and heart-wrenching situations of the old west. It could have been real life even though it is written as fiction.

Neither one of us was aware of this television series inspired by the characters of Lonesome Dove, but we've really grown to enjoy it.  It picks up the story of Newt Call when he settles in the little town of Curtis Wells, Montana.  The first half of the disks are a bit too saccharine for my tastes, though the writing and acting is still good.  But the stories get a little grittier and the characters change a bit in the second half, ""The Outlaw Years.""  It's given us a great deal of enjoyment, watching a disk every Sunday afternoon for the past several weeks.  I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoyed Lonesome Dove.",1247788800,,792,4.458333333333333

3320936,5,B0012CJQXW,"I enjoyed watching the TV Series when it was on the air. The network  put it on some horrible time slot at 2AM or 2:30 AM on Sunday morning.  Some times I would watch it and catch myself dozing off since it came on so early.

I did enjoy watching the TV Series. The networks kept changing the times it would come on. I had strong feeling they wanted to cancel it. The First TV Series ended with the explosion because it was going to be cancelled. Many fans wrote and complaining about the series being cancelled. It somehow it survived and came back as the outlaw years.  Although they did not even show the outlaw years on the network in my area.

I did buy both sets seperatetly and watched them back to back. I enjoy the TV Series more than the outlaw years.  I really liked Hannah and I did not like her character being killed off. I think they took the heart out of the series when she left. Her character gave it a softness and gentleness that the outlaw years just does not have. Since it came on so early in the morning many people never even saw it at all.

Get the series you will enjoy both of them. And viewing the hunk and a half gorgeous Eric McCormack on tv at 2AM was definelty a plus to. Wow! What a view!",1241222400,2,1222,4.1308016877637135

Newt Call is on his own and sets off on a new venture in his life in a fictional town known as Curtis Wells. The characters in this show are all very talented  and the story lines are engrossing... I love the scenery and the brawn of an old western town.. This is a great show.. The Outlaw Years is even more interesting after Newt loses his wife in a tragic accident.

3320939,5,B0012CJQXW,"I can't recommend this series highly enough to lovers of the true Western experience. Set in 1880 Montana, this follows the life of Captain Woodrow Call's son, Newt.
You can essentially forget ""Lonesome Dove"" after about 1 or 2 episodes, as there is only a tenuous connection. Doesn't matter at all, since this series stands perfectly well on its own, and the further into it you get, the better you'll like it.
It is actually two distinct series; though the scenes, characters and actors are the same. Events have caused changes which create a very different Newt Call in the gritty rough second half, known as the ""Outlaw Years"".
The first episodes are sunny & bright, full of hope & promise, as were the early settlers dreams. And then ... well, buy the set and see for yourself!
I have NEVER spent better money for entertainment than this.
Do be sure to get the ""Ultimate Collection"" by Echo Bridge Home Entertainment, 10 DVDs - 43 episodes. The picture quality is great, sound is clear.",1232668800,10,991,4.7011494252873565

3320947,4,B0012CJQXW,"I'd been looking for Lonesome Dove: The Outlaw Years on DVD, and found some copies on the internet, but never got around to buy it. When I cruised Amazon a few weeks ago and saw this release, with both TV-series in it, to a very reasonable price, I was so happy! Finally I had both series on DVD. I was never so much of a fan of Lonesome Dove: The series as I was of LD: TOY, but now I think I love the first series even more. Hearing the opening music for LD: TS... I nearly cried. Nostalgic much?!

The reason I give this release 4 stars instead of 5, is because of a little thing called subtitles... (and some for not adding bonus material). As english is not my native (I am norwegian), and even though I speak it fairly well, I have some problems with some of the dialogue (Buffaly Bill, anyone?) so releasing this DVD-set with english subtitles (like, for the hearing impaired) would have been a MAJOR plus! But, as I've seen on most DVD releases for ""smaller 90's series"", subtitles are rarely added, so it's okay. But, for me, it drops the quality a little bit.

Still, a long-awaited release and I love it!",1218240000,6,1115,4.304761904761905

Now, almost every evening,my husband and I can't wait to see the next episode of Newt Call and his life in what was still the wild west. Newt is married to Hannah, and they have their differences, but they are young and in love and everything seems to work out for them. Each episode has an exciting plot and leaves you wanting to see what happens next! The photography in this series is every well as fine as it is in the 4 movies (that I know of).

3320950,4,B0012CJQXW,"I am not particularly a western fan, but I do love Lonesome Dove the movie. Both ""The Series"" and ""The Outlaw Years"" were very engrossing and very enjoyable. For the most part, the stories and the characters carry you easily through spots of mediocre acting and directing and some, um, unusual filmmaking. The two series are quite different in tone and attitude. I let my seven year old watch ""The Series"", but not ""The Outlaw Years"" because of the increase in violence and change in the general mood.

You don't get to find out what happens at the end of ""The Series"" until the first episode of ""The Outlaw Years"". It seems they intentionally left it open-ended to keep their options open.

Then ""The Outlaw Years"" doen't 'end' at all. It just stops. Many developing threads are left hanging. It is as if it got cancelled mid-season.

Lastly, the DVD production is less than stellar. The navigation is strange and the numbering and labeling on the DVDs is inconsistent or non-existent, but nothing that can't be worked out.

Bottom line: Sometimes odd in its production, but completely worth watching.",1207267200,41,1102,4.814814814814815
