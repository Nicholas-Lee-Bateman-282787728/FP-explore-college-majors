2412357,5,B000BC8SXS,"Nowhere Man was so far ahead of its time, it makes me wonder how today's mystery thriller shows would have turned out without it. It struck to the heart of our fears of identity theft, paranoia about government conspiracy and mystery in a way that no other show could have, and long before anyone had even thought about it. It catapulted Bruce Greenwood to the top of my favourite actor list, at the very least!!! I am so thrilled it's coming out on DVD at last, a worthwhile one to own and show everyone who hasn't seen it yet.",1132531200,4,528,4.343434343434343

With all of the DVD Box Sets of TV Series available, there are only 3 which I am longing to have in my collection.  This is one of them.  TV Shows are about personal taste but I think this one had something for everyone.",1131753600,4,386,4.1891891891891895
2412359,5,B000BC8SXS,"I don't make it a point to watch many TV shows as most shows are terrible. I caught the very beginning of the Nowhere Man pilot completely by accident back in 1995 and before the intro was finished......I WAS HOOKED! I was completely devastated when it didn't return and the fact that the show has NEVER been in reruns in the United States, completely evades all logic as it runs in other countries.

I've read rumors about the show possibly being available on DVD for some time, but it seemed to only be a CONSPIRACY to get people like me excited. Now it appears to really be the TRUTH. This is the best news I've heard all year! I'M THRILLED! I'm looking forward to having Nowhere Man on DVD and I'm also hoping that a release of this fine show will cause many people to get as hooked on it as I have been since that fateful Monday night back in 1995. (The above was written before news of a definite release.)

***************** NOWHERE MAN UPDATE

FINALLY!!!! MY FAVORITE TV SHOW OF ALL TIME! ""Nowhere Man"" is slated to be released on December 27, 2005 on DVD. This will be a first time release for this program in ANY format.

It ran the 25 episodes in 1995/1996 ONE (1) time and has NEVER been seen again (in the USA that is, it ran in reruns overseas). There is a cult following of this show and we've followed news (very scant news since most people haven't heard of this show) for years since it went off the air. We just knew it was a real conspiracy trying to keep our beloved ""Nowhere Man"" from us.

This show will knock the wind out of you! The absolute best I've ever seen! This is a very CEREBRAL and smart show......we think that's why UPN pulled the plug after only 25 episodes. UPN was a brand new network in 1995 and ""Nowhere Man"" came on TV on Monday nights at 9 p.m. The combination of brand new network and the unique intelligence of the show spelled D O O M.....the general public for the most part didn't see it....(who watched UPN then?) and a lot of the ones that watched it.......well, let's just say it went directly over their heads. But there are a few of us that fell in love with the show, and tried real hard to keep its memory alive on the internet. When I first got my computer and got on the internet the first time, guess what I looked up? You are correct! ""Nowhere Man"" was my first search.

You MUST check out ""Nowhere Man"". You will be as hooked as I have been since 1995. Finally! It's going to be available. HOORAY!!!!

Signed, A Very Happy Fan

2412360,5,B000BC8SXS,"this was one of the most well written and under promoted shows on

television.  I remember waiting each week to see what would happen next.  The shows continually blew my mind and I have only the original VHS copies.  I can't wait to see them complete and unedited on DVD.",1130112000,8,272,4.38
2412361,5,B000BC8SXS,"""NOWHERE MAN"" was a series that aired from August 1995 to May 1996 on fledgling network UPN. It was a new channel and a new show and that combination, along with the odd pairing of this series and STAR TREK: VOYAGER (ran 7 seasons, don't know why) may have been what drove it into the ground. Unfortunately, I feel I have to explain this to you people. Here's the episode run down of this wonderful series ([...]):

1) Absolute Zero
Thomas Veil - quite literally - loses his identity one night over dinner and begins to mentally unravel when he discovers his wife (Megan Gallagher, TV's ""Millennium"") is part of whatever's happening. Placed in a sanitarium, he slowly realizes that he's actually the victim of some massive conspiracy connected to a photograph he took entitled ""Hidden Agenda"".

2) Turnabout
Veil is picked up by operatives, who think he's Dr. Bellamy. He's taken to a Midwest sanitarium for the organization and ordered to crack Ellen Combs (Mimi Craven), a young woman who has just been erased. Thinking he'll be able to secure his own files, Tom plays along, but realizes he must intervene before Ellen divulges any information and endangers other possible victims

3) The Incredible Derek
Tracing the jeep in the photograph to Tipton, Georgia, Thomas Veil meets a blind 10-year-old prophet (Zachery McLemore) who sees into both Tom's past and future. With his help Tom manages to avoid being captured by the army troops that seem to be looking for him, but not before they destroy the army base that has some mysterious connection to the picture in Tom's negative as well as the small town where they've been staying.

4) Something About Her
The conspiracy kidnaps Tom and through drugs and programming convinces him he's in love with an attractive photographer named Karin (Carrie Ann Moss, ""The Matrix"" and ""Memento"") -  actually an actress hired by the conspirators. As their relationship progresses, flashbacks confuse him and Tom angrily turns on the girl, forcing the doctors to step up their program.

5) Paradise on Your Doorstep
While working in a photo shop Tom comes across a picture of his wife Alyson dining with a female customer. When the woman (Saxon Trainor) picks up the photographs he follows her, only to be kidnapped and transported to a strangely isolated ""village"" -- a perfect town specially designed for the ""disenfranchised"" -- those persons who had lost their identities because of ""them"".

6) The Spider Webb
Tom is tracing Dave ""Eddie"" Powers, his friend from the asylum who knew too much and was lobotomized for his efforts to help Tom. He ends up in Eddie's run-down hotel room where the television mysteriously begins broadcasting The Lenny Little Show (Michael McGuire), a serial that is - amazingly enough - re-enacting scenes from Tom's personal erasure. He traces the program to the Max Webb Studios and confronts the sneering writer. Veil begins to realize that Max Webb (Richard Kind of ""Mad About You"") not only knows what he has done but foresees what he'll do next.

7) A Rough Whimper of Insanity
Working as a pizza deliveryman, Tom happens on a computer hack that has cut himself off from the world and lives in darkness with his machines. Sickly and severely socially handicapped, Scott Hansen (Sean Whalen) begins to warm to Tom's gentleness and becomes deeply intrigued when he realizes the extent of his erasure - so profound that even Scott's skills can't retrieve Veil's files.

8) The Alpha Spike
Tom travels to New England to work in the military school where Dr. Bellamy taught and to investigate Bellamy's methods of subliminal persuasion on teenagers. While there he becomes involved in a murder committed by an evil and manipulative cadet (Jackson Price).

9) You've Really Got A Hold On Me
Tom is befriended by a man whose own life was taken away by the organization more than 20 years before. Gus Shepard (Dean Stockwell, TV's ""Quantum Leap"") has come to realize that the conspiracy's focus has shifted from him to Tom and that even his life as a runaway no longer has meaning.

10) Father [""Validation""]
Tom returns to the Missouri town where he grew up and meets the father who deserted him and his mother 20 years before. Although he wants to believe the man now calling himself Jonathan Crane (Dean Jones, ""Beethoven"") is his father, Veil is suspicious of the recent plastic surgery and demands proof, which Jonathan can't seem to supply.

11) An Enemy Within
Tom finds himself in a rural area of Pennsylvania where he's waiting for a phone call from a detective who thinks he can name the cigar-smoking soldier in Tom's photo. Unwittingly camping out on private land, he's shot by a guard and left for dead. He's discovered the next day by Emily (Maria Bello, ""A History of Violence"" and ""The Cooler"", TV's ""ER""), a young woman who manages to drag him to her home and nurses him back to health.

12) It's Not Such a Wonderful Life
During Christmas, Thomas Veil reads in a newspaper that the federal government is looking for him in connection with the photograph ""Hidden Agenda"". And then - quite suddenly - he's found! He's told his ordeal is over and that all he has to do is testify, and - to prove his story - hand over the negatives.

13) Contact [""Deep Throat""]
A mysterious voice (Robin Sachs, TV's ""Babylon 5"") from within the organization contacts Veil and tells him he'll help him reach the man responsible for his erasure. To earn Tom's trust the voice allows him to watch the video record of his own erasure and to see the man who ordered it: Richard Grace (Joseph Lambie). To insure Tom's interest the voice also shows Tom proof that his wife Alyson was involved with Grace and sets out an elaborate scheme for Tom to assassinate the man.

14) Heart of Darkness
Veil uses a Palmtop computer provided by his contact within the organization to track down Commander Quinn (James Tolkan, ""Back to the Future""), a secretive military man who runs a right-wing uniformed organization that carefully screens all applicants. Usurping an accepted applicant's place, Tom finds himself kidnapped and inducted into a brutally disciplined militia group that kills those who don't conform.

15) Forever Jung [""Doubles""]
Following up on information in the Palmtop, Tom journeys to a Minnesota town and finds work at a nursing home that may be performing unauthorized scientific experiments on its residents. The unexpected death of one of the residents prompts Veil to investigate and he uncovers a plot that is directly linked to the organization.

16) Shine a Light on You [""Masons""]
Tom journeys to a remote Colorado town to look for a physicist named Dr. Merrit, whom he suspects is another victim of the conspiracy. Dr. Merrit's disappearance has been attributed to an alien abduction by the locals, who have become accustomed to seeing strange phenomena and unexplained lights.

17) Stay Tuned
The Palmtop leads Veil to Darby, NY -- a seemingly perfect American town where everybody is just too good to be true. Suspecting some form of mind control Tom attempts to infiltrate the campaign headquarters of Jim Hubbard (Cliff DeYoung, TV's ""X-Files"" pilot, ""Suicide Kings""), a local politician who is launching a campaign to run for governor - and who might be part of the organization that erased Tom's identity.  * NOTE: My friend Jane Vandenburgh was an extra during this episode's town hall meeting!

18) Hidden Agenda
Alexander Hale (Robin Sachs, TV's ""Babylon 5""), Tom's mysterious contact in the organization, finally reveals his true identity and arranges to meet with Tom to find out the truth about the photograph ""Hidden Agenda"". Unknown to Tom, Hale has been uncovered by the organization and they intend to use him as bait to bring Veil down once and for all.

19) Doppleganger
Unsure that he can trust the information from the Palmtop computer, Veil decides to investigate one last name: Claire Hillard (Jamie Rose), a fellow journalist who was assigned to the same South American arena where the ""Hidden Agenda"" photograph was supposedly taken. Arriving in the small Ohio town where she lives he discovers there's another Thomas Veil living there -- a photographer with whom Claire occasionally works.

20) Through A Lens Darkly [""Shutterbug""]
Tom is kidnapped and locked inside a remote deserted house. An operative (Sam Anderson, TV's ""ER"", ""LOST"") within the organization uses powerful mind control techniques to induce haunting memories from Veil's past, making him recall his childhood and the violent death of his childhood sweetheart (Monica Creel).

21) Dark Side of the Moon [""Mugging""]
Tom has a chance to uncover an important list of operatives, but as he's phoning his contact an operative (Maurice Chasse) from the organization attacks him and demands the negatives. Fleeing from one enemy Tom runs into another as an inner city gang confronts Veil and steals a bag containing the negatives of ""Hidden Agenda"".

22) Calaway
Thomas Veil is suffering from severe insomnia and a doctor's alarming diagnosis prompts him to go back to the asylum where he was first placed after his erasure. There he encounters one of his fellow inmates (Jay Arlen Jones), a man who has been re-programmed to think he's one of the doctors.

23) Zero Minus Ten [""Coma""]
Waking up in a hospital with no memory of how he got there, Tom is immediately suspicious when he's told he's been in a coma for three months following a car accident. A forced reunion with his wife Alyson (Megan Gallagher, TV's ""Millennium"") only reinforces his belief that he is the victim of another ruse by the organization that is trying to get his negatives.

24) Marathon
Uncovering a section of ""Hidden Agenda"" previously obscured, Tom discovers the numbers for a radio frequency that ultimately leads him to a Washington DC research center called",1129680000,16,9813,4.917775090689238
2412362,5,B000BC8SXS,"This short-lived and under-appreciated TV show which premiered in 1995 was unlike any other show on television.  Only X-Files captured the chilling nature of conspiracy like this show did; but it's focus was on other things.  Nowhere man instead focused on our very nature of perception, and nearly every episode focused on a different aspect of this fallible sense.  And if you liked the X-Files, you'll see many similarities in Nowhere Man, from the atmosphere and the 'trust no one' attitude to the very background score by the talented Mark Snow.

All in all, I am very excited that this unique show is finally being release on DVD.  Go get it!",1129334400,,648,4.801801801801802
2412363,5,B000BC8SXS,"In the fall of 1995 one of the most original progams of that season made it's debut: Nowhere Man. Played by the under-rated Bruce Greenwood who brought just the right amount of suspicion and paranoia to the table, the show quite effectively, and chillingly, shows what could happen if someone had their identity completely erased, in this case after Greenwood's character (photographer Thomas J. Veil) takes a snapshot of what appears to be a hanging in Central America. His life quite literally unravels like a roll of film when the people who want the negatives erases his identity and forces him to go on the run. Everyone, including his wife, no longer recognizes or will have anything to do with him. He is, quite literally, a man without an identity or a past, who must sort out what has happened while avoid being captured. One of the themes of Nowhere Man was that you never knew who was friend or foe, which gave the show it's paranoid edge.

Unfortunately after only one season, and just when it appeared that we were getting to the bottom of who was behind Thomas Veil's erasure and how it was done, the show was cancelled, leaving many a fan, myself included, hanging in the air. It's great that this show is finally being released on DVD, it would have been greater still if they had done so 10 years ago.",1129248000,82,1318,4.584745762711864
2412364,5,B000BC8SXS,"NOWHERE MAN in opinion is the most original tv show since THE PRISONER. One might say it's a cross between THE FUGITIVE meets THE PRISONER. The cloak and dagger pyrotechnics as Thomas Veil identity is erased by the organisation is disturbing and mind bending.  It was a pity this show lasted only one season before the network cancelled it. The ideas and concepts to this genre belong in cinema. If I was a Hollywood executive I would purchase the rights to the show and adapt it to the cinema. Directors such as Christopher Nolan, Zack Snyder and David Fincher come to mind. Even Steven Spielberg could make a classic 150 minute feature film of the story elements from the show. There hasn't been a show like this today. The only other show to challenge and fry the mind is LOST.",1364688000,,780,4.571428571428571

Fans of this show should start a petition to bring the show back, at least for one more season until they can properly rap things up, instead of leaving matters hanging the way they did on the end of the first.

X-Files, for example, did not make every episode about the alien conspiracy, they sprinkled those episodes throughout the series. The Mentalist, another example, does not make every episode about Red John. The 70's show The Incredible Hulk, did notmake every episode about Banner's search to find a way to control ""the beast that dwells within him."" Even LOST, with all of it's ultimate failings, did not make every episode about The Others.

Nowhere Man had some great episodes, I thought the overall mythology was good...I simply got bored with EVERY SINGLE EPISODE being about the main character either being captured by ""the conspiritors"" or the people in the town he was in being in on the conspiracy.

2412373,5,B000BC8SXS,"I had never heard of this show. Amazon recommended it to me, and I bought it because of all the good reviews. I didn't expect much. I assumed it would be an OK show to kill an hour here and there. I put it aside for several weeks and didn't think about. I couldn't find anything good to watch the other day. So, I figured I would watch the premier episode. Well, four DVDs later I realized the whole day was gone and I just had to get some sleep! It was that good. Episode after episode, it was just riveting! I am trying to ration the rest of the discs, to make it last longer. It is very hard.

The only thing I didn't like (very minor) was the episode ""A Rough Whimper of Insanity."" The portrayal of computers was beyond ridiculous, but as a software engineer, I find the computers in most movies and TV show to be utter nonsense. I guess everyone is probably the same when their profession is portrayed on a show.",1285027200,3,917,4.1807909604519775
2412374,5,B000BC8SXS,"""Nowhere Man"" is simply the best science fiction series of its type since Rod Serling's ""Twilight Zone.""  Acting, scenery, casting, directing, special effects, and storylines are all first-rate.  Bruce Greenwood is perfect as the series star, fleeing from place to place looking for the truth and avoiding his enemies.  Why this series was not renewed in 1996 is a total mystery.  It was at least 10-12 years ahead of its time.

Contrary to some reviewers, my wife and I don't see the series as perfect in all respects.  There were a couple of disappointing episodes, like the one with Dean Stockwell, where the dialogue seemed stilted and unrealistic.  There was also a lot of violence that some viewers may find offensive.  Still, the overall writing, acting, and production values sweep you along and make you want to see more.  Unfortunately, there were only 25 episodes and 25 more should have been done, at a minimum.

Regarding the video and audio transfers done for the DVD's, they are the best I've seen yet.  Time and again I'd find myself saying to my wife how it looked like the show had been recorded very recently in digital form.  Hats off to the technical gurus who re-mastered this series.  Your work deserves some kind of award.

Finally, the price for this complete series, along with special features, interviews, and the like, makes ""Nowhere Man"" one of the top entertainment values to be found anywhere.  Buy the DVD set and see for yourself.  You will surely agree.

2412376,5,B000BC8SXS,"I was fortunate enough to see this series when first broadcast. It's storyline fascinated me since I saw allusions to The Odyssey, The Prisoner, and many offerings in between.  My own personal theory was that we had so many stories about aliens abducting people in order to ""see how they tick"" anatomy-wise that now we now had one where the aliens do this psychological experiment to see just how Tom Veil ticks and what lengths a human will go to in order to regain his identify and his life.  That theory fit all the various events throughout the series much better than the hurried up conclusion slapped on the end of the series.  The usenet group for Nowhere Man included fans around the world who exchanged ideas and observations. Larry Herzog occasionally chimed in also - how great is that!  I am so sorry this was cancelled.

2412377,4,B000BC8SXS,"Fans of Ken Wahl's WISEGUY, as well as current series like '24' and  Chris Carter's MILLENNIUM should take note of this exceptional series that only ran for 1 season on the short-lived UPN network back in the early 90's. The list of reviews preceding mine are pretty much on the mark and show a thoughtful mix of comments. I purchased the full series set from Amazon (for only $20!) and although I've only viewed into the third disc, I can say that it was an incredible bargain. Excellent packaging, a crisp, vivid picture throughout, plus LOADED with extras, the series set holds up well in 2010, especially when you consider how quickly technology and effects can date a concept or series. NOWHERE MAN was smart in that it relied more heavily on character and tone, hitting the viewer with just the right level of dark conspiracy and thrilling, edge-of-your-seat action each and every episode. BRUCE GREENWOOD, fresh off his stint on another cult-hit series ST. ELSEWHERE, does an incredible job in this series, doing ALL the heavy lifting as the primary show character throughout. He manages to illicit much of the same empathy that actor's like Wahl and Lance Henrickson maintained throughout the arcs of their successful series. The only downside is that the series was CANCELLED before a satisfying ending. (Maybe fans could convince the series creator to self-publish a conclusion available through Amazon's print-on-demand?) Overall, NOWHERE MAN remains a compelling precursor to other excellent series like X-FILES and FRINGE and is in every way a series that deserves equal status.",1270425600,,1591,5.072519083969466

It, like The Prisoner, was about something, and Hertzog admits that he viewed the show as an anthology series exploring loneliness, with the Organization as a mere spur for those perambulations of the character of Tom Veil. Yet, despite its debt to The Prisoner, Nowhere Man explores many of the same themes from the other end of the spectrum. Tom Veil wanders through his society that does not see him, while John Drake, as Number Six, is physically cut off from his society. Both battle a network of mysterious malefactors, but Veil's fate seems the worse of the two, because, at the end of his series he is still in anomy, whereas John Drake has been restored to his life, his wish to resign just a fleeting desideratum. This may be partly explained by the fact that Patrick McGoohan had total control over The Prisoner while Lawrence Hertzog lost control of Nowhere Man. Despite that, while Nowhere Man does not reach the heights its predecessor did, it remains one of the great achievements of action television- thought-provoking, well-acted, and with a number of terrific episodes, most notably the first twelve. And almost as influential on the show as The Prisoner was were the film The Manchurian Candidate, and the tv show The Fugitive.

  If we take the end of the series as its true end, and ignore a planned second season, Nowhere Man seems to be about the search for the truth. This is what impels Veil to resist, whereas Number Six's motivation was the desire and struggle for privacy, individuality, and his refusal to accede. Veil has no privacy, and may not even really exist- his battle is the more abstract, and perhaps that is why he ultimately fails where John Drake succeeds. The ending also cleared some things up, even as it clouded others. Veil was so good in high danger situations because, like Drake, he was really a trained expert in them. But, the biggest difference between the two shows is that The Prisoner dealt with the inward evils of self, and is therefore allegorical, whereas Nowhere Man dealt with that on the outside, and is more mythic. Drake's battle with the Village is really his own with the desire to conform. Veil's real battle is to find out the truth that others refused him. Hidden Agenda's real Hidden Agenda was that the photos were ultimately unimportant, and there probably was no execution, even of the Senators. They were probably just coerced into cooperation, for funding black ops programs, as the Organization seems to have been a quasi-governmental concern. No organized crime group, nor single government agency- foreign or domestic- could do all it did without being detected, unless it got major cash infusion from a government, likely the American, since the series is a post-Cold War paranoia trip.

  But, another important difference between The Prisoner and Nowhere Man is that the two protagonists, despite being in the same profession, could not have greater temperamental differences if they tried. John Drake is cold, cerebral, a thinker and possibly a misanthropist. Tom Veil, or Gemini, is a feeler, who loves his faux wife even after betrayals, and easily acceded to the sexual desires of his many lady loves. It would be difficult to imagine the two characters in the other's series. John Drake would likely have discovered the secret in two to three episodes, tops because most of Veil's failings are a direct result of his emotionalism bettering his rationalism. And Veil in the Village? He'd have never been able to wall off any part of his ego long enough for his existential dilemma to come to fruition. A listen to his episode opening monologue- `My name is Thomas Veil, or at least it was. I'm a photographer. I had it all: a wife, Alyson, friends, a career. And in one moment it was all taken away. All because of a single photograph. I have it. They want it, and they will do anything to get the negative. I'm keeping this diary as proof that these events are real. I know they are....they have to be.'- aptly delineates the difference between the two men. Would Number Six/John Drake ever had a hint of doubt like that? This has led some to believe that Veil/Gemini is really insane, and the show just one long attempt to make the viewer identify with a lunatic, much the same that the novel The Dead Zone, by Stephen King, is an attempt to make the reader sympathize with an assassin. It could be that everything was real until Tom's psyche broke in the bathroom in the pilot, and clues throughout the show leave interpretation open. Of course, suspension of disbelief is a necessity, for many things don't seem to make sense in any `real' interpretation of the sow's events.

  Nowhere Man, though, is not just a ripoff of The Prisoner, it's a show that works for a number of reasons. First, it appeals to the masses, with its weekly adventure- this is its The Fugitive appeal- with the twist, of course, being that the hunted was also the hunter. The questions are of what the Organization is, what is Hidden Agenda's true significance, and why was Tom Veil's life stripped from him? Secondly, the show appeals to The Manchurian Candidate conspiracists- it's a sociological and political mystery. Is the Organization part of the government, is Veil a spy, and who is behind it. Thirdly, there are The Prisoner fans, who see the show more existentially- who is Tom Veil, and why is he Nowhere Man, concern them. There was a reason the show was the most critically acclaimed of the 1995-96 season, and only studio stupidity, and a slot opposite Monday Night Football, ruined it.",1224201600,5,5780,4.789368104312939
2412385,2,B000BC8SXS,"I was excited to learn of this show and must say the premise is enticing: a man who loses his life and wants to get it back. How in the world could you blow a great idea like this? Stay tuned.

It all begins with our hero going to the restroom and returning to find a restaurant full of amnesiacs: another couple is sitting at his table and and the waiter denies having ever seen him or his wife. Not just his wife and the waiter are in on the conspiracy, but somehow all 30 people in the restaurant are in on it as well, as they all play their parts.

He quickly discovers they've canceled his phone, changed the keys to every lock, recalled his bank card, gotten his wife a new husband, retrained the dog, and basically zeroed out his life. Hmm, that's a lot of work to get done over dinner. Instead of having to enlist entire restaurants full of people and deploy multiple teams of locksmiths, computer hackers, and animal trainers to frantically get the work done while the guy is having dinner, why didn't they just do it all after he'd gone to bed so they could take their time? Never occurs to them.

They can be forgiven that, since it never occurs to our hero to track anyone from the restaurant down to ask them what happened that night. Instead, our hero wanders around the country being chased by the bad guys (every episode) and captured by them (every other episode). They mobilize entire military units to track him, and suffer heavy casualties: a half dozen foot soldiers and three key people in the first few episodes alone. He must be really important to expend that kind of effort and resources on. Right?

Uh, no, not really. All ""they"" supposedly want are the negatives to some picture that our hero took two-and-a-half years earlier.

Hmmm. Two-and-a-half years earlier, and they are just now getting around to trying to shut him up? Here's their reasoning: If you don't want someone to make something public, then wait until after the gala grand gallery opening and a signed publishing contract. Only then try to shut him up. Huh? Did it occur to them to shut him up before all this? Nope.

But let's give them the credit of the doubt. Maybe they waited for the gallery to open so that they could buy the photo from him without all this subterfuge and sneaking around? Uh, no, that never occurs to them. Did he make a copy of the negatives? After being chased around for months on end this might occur to someone. Amazingly, it occurs to neither side.

Actually, not much occurs to anyone in this show.

Since they capture him every other episode, you'd think it would occur to them to simply torture him and ask where the negatives are. But this advanced concept never arises. Instead, they hatch elaborate and expensive schemes to trick our hero into revealing where the negatives are. Needless to say, these schemes are more convoluted than the ones on the old Batman TV show and don't work. Of course, they always make it easy for him to escape, and escape he does, to continue bumbling about the country trying to get back his life.

That's his goal, to get back his life. Let's see what he's trying to get back to: his wife frames him multiple times, his best friend is dead, his estranged mother betrays him, his business is destroyed, and everyone who knew him refuses to aid him and disavows knowledge of his existence. There's motivation for you.

If you enjoy watching a guy with an 81 IQ outwit guys with an 80 IQ then this show is for you. Otherwise, move on, nothing to see here. There is a good reason this show isn't called Knowhere Man.",1217980800,6,3576,4.487692307692308
2412386,4,B000BC8SXS,"What would you do if you were enjoying a steak dinner with your wife, slipped off to the boy's room for some relief, and returned to the dining room only to find your wife gone, a strange couple at your table, and a maitre d' (plus staff) who no longer recognize you? Eventually, you'd head to the ATM for cab fare home, only to find you'd been erased from the bank's memory, you'd arrive at your doorstep to find said wife claiming she doesn't have a clue who you are, and to add to it all, she's living with another guy who threatens you.

As you dig deeper you'd connect it to the fact you are a successful photographer named Tom Veil (played with considerable aplomb by Bruce Greenwood) whose recent show featured a black and white photograph of several men hung from the gallows, being watched by someone who suspiciously resembles a cigar-chomping American marine with a jeep. Does this photograph - and the negatives, which some shadowy group wants - form the centerpiece of the next 24 episodes? You guess :-)

This is the opening of Nowhere Man, conceived by (now) 24's Larry Hertzog, and offered on the (then) new UPN for a single 1995-96 season. For the next 24 episodes, Greenwood's Tom Veil becomes a man without a country, or bank account, or whatever it is he needs at the moment to get to the bottom of the 'organization' who is making his life miserable and attempting to acquire the negatives. What we get is a roller coaster ride, in both concept and excecution. Hertzog conceived the show as a stream-of-consciousness exercise centered around the photograph (which he freely admits in the commentary, is nothing more than a MacGuffin - a Hitchcockian term for The Thing everyone obsesses over). After initial good reviews, UPN got antsy to make the show 'about something', so Greenwood was given a 'palm top' (early version of the Palm Pilot), and directed to shadowy doings by mysterious folks . Hertzog played along for a few eps, then went back to his initial abstract concept, only to be faced with cancellation and the desire to wrap things up plot-wise. So it was back to the 'about something' organization, whose motives were reasonably well explained towards the end. So, yes, there is a form of closure contained in this set of DVDs.

Tom Veil travels from town to town 'in search of answers', only to find an assortment of characters - all of whom had to be suspected of being part of The Big Plan - who were placed in various ominous narrative settings. These ranged from mental institutions, to boys' academies, to strange locked communities that were inspired directly by the 60s TV classic, The Prisoner. In a favorite ep of mine, Veil travels to rural Georgia and almost locates the jeep in his picture, only to be attacked by hostile henchmen. He turns up at a circus sideshow featuring a blind but clairvoyant boy who offers insight into his fate. And so it goes like this. The best way to deal with it is sit back and enjoy the ride, without expecting the powers that be to explain much. Have no fear: by hook or by crook, they eventually will.

The mid-90s were the heyday of conspiracy TV, and Nowhere Man plays directly to this. Chris Carter's X-Files on Fox was at its peak, and Hertzog's creation was added to the pack (he even drafted composer Mark Snow, originator of the tinkly X-Files opening, to do the theme for Nowhere Man). To top it off, Tom Veil's mysterious turncoat wife was played by Megan Gallager, who went on to be the wife to Lance Hendriksen's character Frank Black in Carter's next series 'Millennium', sealing her dramatic fate as the spouse to men with evil conspiracy problems.

This set of DVDs is attractively presented and peppered with a number of video commentaries throughout the season. Watching Greenwood and Hertzog watch again for the first time in 10 years is rewarding, and I would suggest taking in the commentaries as they roll along. This will enhance your understanding of why things 'were the way they were' at the given moment of the production, without introducing spoilers.

Overall, I recommend this set to fans of this genre or of cult TV, though I hesitate to say it's the work of genius others have suggested. What's needed to enjoy this ride is a good imagination, and a few grains of salt. A masterpiece? No. But it is still more engaging than alot of what was out there, including the last three seasons of X Files.",1199577600,5,4407,4.650834403080873

Having the opportunity to watch it again after all this time confirms that view. Yes, some of the episodes are a morew than a bit ""Dated"" (The virtual reality episode being the most flagrant) but it still holds the suspense. The series bears more than a passing resembelence to ""The Fugitive"", another classic TV Series and movie.",1182816000,,436,4.602564102564102

2412392,3,B000BC8SXS,"When I first started watching this show my first thought was ""Wow, this is pretty ambitious stuff for early UPN."" And it is. . .but it is also creating an illusion for the audience. That illusion being that they are telling a story with these episodes when in reality they are telling a bunch of little stories all based around the same premise: Tom Veil (Bruce Greenwood), a man who has had his identity stolen, wanders into whacked out situations and tries to prevent bad guys from catching him and stealing his negatives. So throughout 25 episodes the show meanders hither and yon, leaving a trail of loose ends in its wake. ""Nowhere Man"" travels through Nowhere America, we watch as Veil moves from one creepy small town to the next. They make references to places like Phoenix and Washington DC, but he would never be so brave as to venture into a place that you could find on a map. So while the show may not be as bold as the producers may have thought, it is still a good show that evades greatness by going after the fun/no brainer feel too hard.

Tom Veil in the only character that appears in every episode. Going for the artistic look they dress him up in a ""Da Vinci Code"" hair cut and a wide assortment of blue jeans. He's a good actor and carries the show even if he at times comes off as too calm and too in control. On his journey he meets a lot of colorful characters who engage him for one episode and then disappear forever. His wife shows up a few times, but since the integrity of the episode structure must be maintained she always has to disappear before the end credits role. My favorite one had Richard Kind playing a TV producer who has a show based on the life of Tom Veil. The cleverness comes from the show nearly breaking kayfabe and saying exactly what I was thinking. Yes, the heavies are too powerful! Yes, the show is too predictable! There are a few bombs to be found in this collection as well. One has Veil travel into a virtual reality world to track down the conspiracy. That one will have you laughing at the outlandish ideas these people had about computer technology back then.

The Tom Veil vs. The World narrative works very well, but you can see them straining to keep it interesting. As the season wears on you can see the dots begin to connect less and less and the storyline begins to take on something of a Lynchian feel to it. To their credit, the final revelation is not what you are expecting, but that doesn't mean all the pieces add up either. It does justify the strength of the heavies, but that is about it. My advice to you would be not to watch too many of these in a row. If you watch 2 or 3 at a time you can be overcome with escapist glee, kind of like an ""Alias"" episode. More than anything you will begin to realize just how conventional the show is if you watch more than 3 in a row. All that said, the show is far from a waste of time. It is dated, but it asks questions that are more relevant today than they were ten years ago. Is it better to live under a fascist or live on the run? Tom Veil choose to live on the run and continue his endless pursuit of the truth, and as this seasons shows that is something that is awfully hard to come by when facing off against the US government.

2412405,5,B000BC8SXS,"Following in the footsteps of ""The Prisoner"", ""Nowhere Man"" is one of those few works of television art that keeps you guessing. It's a shame so few people have heard of this series, and a shame it came out in the mid-90's as opposed to today. It almost certainly would have found an audience amid fans of ""Lost"" and ""Heroes."" It was, after all, the brainchild of one of the producers of today's smash-hit ""24.""

Nowhere Man is the story of photographer Thomas Veil who, on the eve of his greatest artistic triumph, finds in the blink of an eye that suddenly everyone in his life doesn't know him. His wife is married to another man going by his name, and even his dog seems ready to get him. Through the course of the series, we find that Tom is the victim of a giant conspiracy bent on obtaining a mysterious negative that apparently shows an execution-style slaying in a third-world country.

The series is mostly an espionage-thriller, but at times delves into the realm of S-F, not unlike The Prisoner in the late sixties. In fact, since Nowhere Man was, by the producer's own admission, inspired by The Prisoner, it is nearly impossible to mention the later show without referring to the earlier. So much so that one episode of N-M pays direct homage to The Prisoner, even going so far as to use the marching band playback from that classic series. It's also interesting to note that it was rumored Patrick MaGoohan was planning a follow-up to The Prisoner called ""Vagabond,"" about a man on the run from unknown forces. I can't imagine that show would have been much different from this. The only disappointing thing about the series is the final episode leaves you hanging. Even so, this in some way lends to the mystique of the series, giving it a Citizen Kane climax which answers everything and answers nothing at the same time.

I was personally glad to see this show on DVD as I was one of the guys who led the charge to see it. This show is an overlooked masterpiece. If you are a fan of Lost, 24, or The Prisoner, by all means get this collection. Chances are you will not be sorry.",1168646400,5,2096,4.496062992125984

During the first episode, I found myself on the edge of my seat. By the end of the episode I was shouting at the TV and wanting to watch the next one.

We watched several episodes a week and got through the whole series pretty quickly.

Some of the episodes are slightly repetitive but still very enjoyable all the same. I would say that one season was about perfect. I'm not sure it could have been carried past the one season.

Bruce Greenwood is excellent in the role as Nowhere Man. As an actor I think he is very underrated.

I'm dating myself a bit here, but, while Nowehere Man has most often been likened to The Prisoner, for me, the show is far more similar to the mid-sixties series Coronet Blue, which starred Frank Converse as a man with amnesia who can only remember being attacked by armed men on a yatch before winding up in the water and then a hospital bed. Aside from this, the only memory he has are the words ""Coronet Blue"" and each week he pursues his own identity while evading mysterious men who are trying to kill him.

2412409,5,B000BC8SXS,"I left America for 5 years in June, 1995 and missed this when it came out.  I discovered it recently through reading the reviews at Amazon.  What a gem! Jewish-American writer Lawrence Hertzog is the creator of this sci-fi thriller.  He drew upon classic masterpieces in this genre such as ""Three Days of the Condor"" and ""The Prisoner"" to create some of the episodes.  But much is original.  The 25 episodes on 9 discs revolve around the main character - Thomas Veil, played by Jewish-American actor Bruce Greenwood.  Thomas Veil has been missing for some time, along with his memory.  But this fact is not revealed until the last episode subtitled ""Gemini Man"".

In the first episode, the audience follows Thomas to a restaurant for dinner with his wife.  When he returns from the restroom, another couple is sitting at his table and his wife is gone.  His credit cards and keys don't work.  His friend is murdered.  No one recognizes him, including his wife.  He ends up in a mental institution and spies his wife chatting with the shrink - Dr. Bellamy, which means she is in on whatever is happening.  Somehow everything is connected to a photograph he took called ""Hidden Agenda"", which shows the hangings of Central American captives by what appears to be U.S. soldiers.  And that is the genius of Hertzog - nothing is as it seems (except, perhaps, for Veil's wife).

My favorite episodes were the 7th - ""A Rough Whimper of Insanity"",the 22nd - ""Calaway"", and the astounding conclusion - ""Gemini Man"".  Working as a pizza delivery man in the 7th episode, Veil encounters a computer genius recluse living off his patent royalties.  The audience is introduced to the world of virtual reality, where the genius discovers a file on Veil and informs him - ""it's not what you think"".  Before he can say more, he vanishes within a crumbling virtual reality room while Veil barely manages to escape.  In the 22nd, Veil comes down with extreme insomnia and returns to the mental institution where he was first placed after he was erased.  There he encounters a shrink who used to be an inmate, but the shrink has no recollection of his past life.  This causes the viewer to ponder whether the same thing happened to Veil or not?  The concluding episode ""Gemini Man"" unravels all.  The mysteries and conspiracies are laid bare.  The disinformation spun to keep Veil and the audience from the truth has been so effective in the previous 24 episodes that nothing is predictable.  It's a great finish to a great series.",1167264000,,2511,4.741339491916859
2412410,5,B000BC8SXS,"Ten years ago, when this aired once and only once on UPN, I got hooked.  Several times over the years I searched the internet to see if the series had been release on DVD yet and was pleasantly surprised to see that it had.

Nowhere Man is an engrossing story of Thomas Veil, a man whose identity has been stripped from him for reasons that can only be assumed are related to a photograph that he has taken.  The series is a some what disjointed tale of Veil attempting to gain his identity and the life he once had back from those who took it.

The best way that I can describe this series is this...  Take the paranoia factor of X-Files and ramp it up by about 10,000 fold.  This series thrives on the sense of paranoia.  Then, take the involved nature of shows like Lost, where one most sort of keep a keen eye out for clues and recurring themes, and ramp that up a bit.  The series contains bits through out it that reference, if I recall correctly since I haven't watched them ALL again, other episodes.

All in all, it is an extreme involved show that serves to engross the audience.  Five stars all around and a masterpiece of television drama that was far too edgy, intelligent and involved to make it in a world of shows like American Idol...",1163462400,3,1251,4.3076923076923075

stick in the thinking viewer's mind.  This beats all the angsty ""who am I?"" type series of the 90's without a problem.  Unfortunately, there aren't enough episodes to rival what studio big wigs at Fox gave more money to, like ""The X-Files"".

This was on TV when I was pretty young and I recorded every episode I could, riveted by the horrific plight of Thomas Veil (Bruce Greenwood); a photographer and journalist, it seems that he has somehow accidentally wronged someone in a very powerful place with his research.  A photographic negative of three people being hung in what looks like a military execution appear in video after video.  His wife spurns him, none of his friends or neighbors remember him at all, and he can no longer find any record of his birth or his existence at all. I haven't seen an episode on TV before or since the original broadcast and have never forgotten it.

The world Veil lives in is necessarily bleak, and this was UPN's best

series, hands down.  The last episode was ridiculously premature, although

I was happy that his ending was not happy, somehow--the point seemed to be that despite Veil's best efforts to again regain his life and discover

precisely what has gone so horribly awry, whoever is in power simply

will not let it occur.  George Orwell would have loved this show.

One evening his wife doesn't recognize him, his credit cards are invalid, his keys don't fit the door and his family and friends are being silenced.  What's going on?  What has he seen?  And just what ""agency"" has deleted a photograph of a third world execution he took?

Go on the run with Vell as he fights to survive long enough to find the answers.",1158451200,,1029,4.459893048128342
2412425,5,B000BC8SXS,"I was a big fan of nowhere man when it was on tv 10 years ago, and rewatching it now it is still a good show.  Yes, the middle of the series seemed almost like padding out the show so it had enough stories for a whole season, but otherwise it was fantastic.  The one big annoyance I would have with it is the ending was not explained well enough; it left more questions than answers.  But otherwise it was great; the DVD is fabulous in presentation too.  A lot of commentary on episodes, promos and such like, it is one of the best releases I have come across in extras.  The only other small problem I had was no pictures of hidden agenda in photo galleries or similar.  Otherwise a fantastic show with great DVD presentation.",1155427200,,727,4.2700729927007295
2412426,5,B000BC8SXS,"I believe had this series come out a few years later instead of when it did, it would have lasted at least 5 seasons.  Nowhere Man was a brilliant, mysterious, intriguing series with twists and surprises, and there was nothing like it on television at the time.  A few years later, several new shows appeared on television with similar style, and they were successful.  Nowhere Man is comparable with great ones like ""ALIAS"" and ""24"".  It is suspenseful and leaves your mouth hanging open with surprise.",1152921600,,503,4.813953488372093
2412427,5,B000BC8SXS,"Nowhere Man is a series that I believe was very very underrated.  I know here in Australia, they showed it very late at night and they would show it some weeks, miss a few weeks and then start it up again, so I never got to see it completely because you never knew what Channel 7 would do (neither do they).
The first episode is amazing and mysifying.  Thoms Veil is dining in a restaurant with his wife after his photo's were on display in his gallery.  He goes to the bathroom - gone no more than 5 minutes - comes out and his wife isn't at their usual table, the staff don't know him, he goes to his house and his wife 'doesn't know who he is' and she's with another husband etc etc.  While he doesn't know what's going on, he's sure it has something to do with a photo he took.  'They' think he knows something he shouldn't and each and every episode from there follows him trying to uncover the truth.  It is funny watching such a fantastic show that back in it's day was 'high tech' and yet now looking back on it, he has no modern day items such as a cell phone or laptop.
You must check this out because it's truly stunning and gripping.  Not all the episodes give you clues to the final outcome - in fact sometimes you are more puzzled at the end of an episode than you were at the beginning, but this is such good entertainment and will keep you guessing right to the exciting end.  I also love the haunting and stunning theme this show has - another well written theme by Mark Snow.  Please go and watch this - if you love good thrillers, then this is for you.  It's great.",1152230400,5,1584,4.147058823529412
2412428,4,B000BC8SXS,"Great show, blending sci-fi, horror, mystery, and drama.  I like Nowhere Man for the same reason that I love The Prisoner, as both shows deal with oppressive forces at work in modern-day civilization.  But where The Prisoner focuses on deliberate, thought-provoking, and highly symbolic social commentary, Nowhere Man focuses on entertainment.  That makes The Prisoner edgier and more experimental (and better, to fringe viewers like me), but it also makes Nowhere Man far more approachable to a mainstream audience.

2412429,5,B000BC8SXS,"I love this show. Love it, love it, absolutely love it. Andthe DVD set absolutely does it justice. Probably UPN's best show, ever. Period. Enough said...

The DVD's are perfect, the casing is beautiful (book-style, if a bit prone to attracting fingerprints ;] ), the audio and video are stellar (though I don't have surround sound or a plasma tv, I was more interested in the storyline than examining with a microscope for dust or other digital artifacts of analog videography: dust, grain, etc.).

The special features are great. I love the commentaries, and the video commentaries, deconstructino of a few scenes and what the cast/crew were going for. Plenty of making-of stuff, even some of the original UPN trailers, even a lame archive clip of Bruce Greenwood recording promotional spots for different affiliate stations (it was kind of funny in a couple places and obvious that he was ad-libbing).

Ahh, the genius oozes from this set. Get it watch it all t eway through from the beginning so as to not taint your understanding of the series if you've never seen it. Once you've watched it all the way through, re-watch it from the beginning and pick up on all the subtle clues and hints and red herrings they dropped throughout the season. The ending is satisfying (they knew they were being dropped, so they tied up the loose ends, mostly; don't worry, I won't spoil the surprise!).

Like I said, don't watch the last episode until you've watched the rest of the series in order. Otherwise it will ruin the tone and character of the other episodes, which should always be watched with a fresh eye first before the big ol' bomb that's dropped at the end.

Highly highly recommended! Excellent suspense/paranoia/conspiracy theory show.",1148601600,13,1741,4.868243243243243
2412430,5,B000BC8SXS,"'Nowhere Man' has finally arrived on DVD!  Now millions everywhere can experience the brilliance of a program that, sadly, was canceled after one season.

The subtle layering of darkness and paranoia as Thomas Veil worked to uncover the truth is an example of masterful writing, directing and acting.  Containing cryptic visual and auditory clues, each episode added to this patina of darkness ever-so-slightly.  Bruce Greenwood never overplays it; in fact, by underplaying the overwhelming stress and anxiety his character is feeling, Greenwood shows us a mounting intensity that evidences itself in his body language and intonation.  We feel for him, and want him to succeed; we want the outside forces to pay for what they've done ... yet we feel there's something just not right about Veil.  Perhaps a subconscious drive toward the shadowy, festering underside of life?

Measured character and story development would finally become popular a decade later, but now that programs like 'Lost,' '24' and 'Six Feet Under' exist, it seems television has perhaps reached an age in which subtlety and intelligence can, at least sometimes, illuminate our living rooms.

Take a long weekend.  Believe me, once you watch the first episode, you'll want to watch the second, and before you it, the sun will have crested the sky.  As the slow march of night overcomes your living room, you'll be too engrossed to realize all the lights are off.  As your mind races to understand all the visual and audio clues set before you and the protagonist, you might want to take a moment to confirm that you are who you believe to be.  Solidify the fragility of identity...  if only for a fleeting moment.",1147305600,4,1686,5.0
2412431,5,B000BC8SXS,"Many of us look back on the 90s in the U.S. fondly and, from the perspective of programmed TV, with good reason. There was the X-Files. There was Twin Peaks. And there was Nowhere Man, possibly the best of the bunch. I kept hoping for a revival of the show, but that never happened--the dumbing down of America that really began in earnest once the 90s had run their course prevented anything like that happening.

Nowhere Man was too gosh darned smart for its own good; in fact, it's a miracle it lasted as long as it did. Very likely one of the chief reasons for its 25-episode run was that upstart station UPN wanted to offer something the big 3 (CBS, ABC, NBC) were not, amd neither, for that matter, was Fox.

Nowhere Man is unique, although as series creator Lawrence Hertzog admits in one of the several interviews with him sprinkled throughout this terrific 9-DVD set, it did have its basis in the groundbreaking, breathtaking 1967 British series The Prisoner which, in fact, was conceived by its star, Patrick McGoohan. And there are definite similarities to The Prisoner. But Hertzog is a sharp cookie; he has Tom Veil, our Nowhere Man anti-hero, always on the run, trapped by forces always running after him, while McGoohan's The Prisoner is trapped inside an enclave, The Village, he cannot escape from. So Nowhere Man is kind of like The Prisoner in reverse, updated to the '90s.

It's also kinda cool to see guest stars like Dean Stockwell and Hal Linden show up, and even the folks who guest whose names are not familiar--like Sean Whalen in ""The Rough Whimper of Insanity"", do a great job. The acting for the most part is superior throughout and in that aforementioned episode, the production values are just as great in depicting a concept of VR (virtual reality) which deftly manages to combine high tech and pure romance in one fell swoop.

This is a show you don't just watch; you sink into, you're absorbed by. And more than that, it's a show that without question still rings true today--maybe even more now than ever before in the history of this country. As the society dumbs down, it's easier for covert ops to do what they do; it's easier for people to not know what is REALLY going on; it's easier for everybody to be fooled by a slick veneer of the ""facts"" that hide the truth.

No other show, for at least 25 years, did what Nowhere Man did. And likely, no other show ever will in the future. Now I'm waiting for a DVD release of the totally obscure, incredibly sharp biting cartoon series created by Martin Short, ""The Completely Mental Misadventures of Ed Grimley"", which was WAY too sophisticated for the Saturday morning slot it was stuck into, which explains why it was also yanked after only one season.

2412433,5,B000BC8SXS,"NOWHERE MAN was truly ahead of it's time, especially in our post-9/11 enviroment of government making it's own rules. The creepy tale is of the life of Thomas Veil, photographer who sees and photographs something he shouldn't have. Or did he? And, his life is ""erased"" by a clandestine ""Organization"" that's obviously government and military connected. This could happen to anyone. And of course, once his life is erased what happens when no one seems to know him and he becomes desperate? He winds up in restraints, in a sinister mental hospital as a involuntary patient, diagnosed as ""paranoid"". And what is more nightmarish than that-being in a place where you know your name and who you are, and your own sanity and everyone else is trying to tell you something different and why you are acting the way you are?? Except, they seem to want those negatives, the only common denomonator Veil has between his former life and, what he is thrust into. Veil discovers in a later episode, other ""patients"" who were the same as he-erased-and even finds a doctor, who formerly was a patient. The mystery deepens. In THE FUGITIVE-like fashion he criss-crosses the country in search of those who stole his life. On the way, he meets all sorts of characters and even gets a few allies and manages to destroy some of the conspirator's facet operatives as he goes. The ending stretches over several episodes-in one it resembles something from THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR. The final episode answers some questions but also leaves the viewer to ponder just what really went on, and keeps us as bewildered as Thomas Veil-but then I think that was all part of the game. It was the end of one aspect of the show and the possible start of another. We can interpret things as we want.  Had there been a 2nd season or some follow up TV films(which almost happened) we would have been taken in a completely different direction I think.

A nice extra on the set of disks is an interview with an anonymous ex-CIA op who claims that, while aspects of the series are somewhat dramatized, that some other aspects of it are closer to the truth than we care to imagine. The idea for example, of manipulating or conditioning a society to think one way or another to meet a larger agenda.  He claims that he became useless to the CIA(which is why he is an ex of it) when he started asking the ""why"" of what he was involved in as opposed to the ""what"" and just following orders. Creepy stuff.

The current hit show LOST is operating on this same idea as NOWHERE MAN-hints and clues which, we the audience can put together, or, dismiss as we see fit. And debate with others.",1143676800,2,2640,4.586864406779661

The actor playing the title character Thomas Veil could not be better in the role.

2412456,4,B000BC8SXS,"In many ways ""Nowhere Man"" might be seen as ""The Fugitive"" on acid. But as has been mentioned, Hertzog also planned it as a reworking and echo of our UK gem, ""The Prisoner"". This goes beyond just refences and throwaway lines.

For those already familiar with ""The Prisoner"", there are several stories in both series where the plot matches up - i.e it is intentionally mirrored. Here is a list of 'doppelganger' episodes in Nowhere Man / The Prisoner respectively. The main four pairs are:

Turnabout / Chimes of Big Ben - (the second story in both.)

Something about Her / ABC

Paradise on your Doorstep/ the whole series - (there's no need to name an episode here, this is just ""the Prisoner"", period)

It's not such a Wonderful Life / Many Happy Returns - (Xmas and Birthday, my favourite pair; in both cases the story came in the middle of the series and restored Veil and No. 6 to something like normality. The fact that ""Its not such a wonderful life"" was a Xmax special and was billed as the final episode meant that the plot took many viewers for a ride.)

Other episodes in the second half of Nowhere Man also have their Prisoner counterparts and references, though more discreetly.

Stay Tuned / The General

Hidden Agenda / the Girl who was Death & Living in Harmony - (a nice double pairing; without giving anything away the connections are: Veil and No. 6 are recounting a story from their past;  Veil and No. 6 get to revisit the scene of a recent experience.)

Doppelganger / the Schitzoid Man - (naturally they'd come up with this one.)

Through a Glass Darkly / Once upon a time - (in my view, ""Through a Glass"" is the better of the two.)

In time, I beleive Hertzog was going to have a show featuring the Beatles soundtrack (Nowhere Man). This would have made the pairing complete with the last Prisoner episode, ""Fall Out"".

Sure, I had to endure Star Trek: Voyager first while that show hopelessly wrote itself into the ground. But here was a show that kept the mythology alive. While X-Files would wait to November and February sweeps months to continue it's Black Oil/ Alien mythology, here, every Monday on Nowhere Man, Thomas Veil was searching and finding clues to his lost identity. It takes a lot of effort to continue a mythology week to week, which requires writers to create a Bible for the show, as a reference of all of it's secrets, so they can keep continuity.

An intelligent, clever TV series that lasted only one season on UPN (coupled mysteriously with ""Star Trek: Voyager"" a big mistake on UPN's part)""Nowhere Man"", like ""The Prisoner"" may have been too good for TV, ahead of its time or had the wrong audience for UPN. It would probably have been coupled better with Fox's ""The X-Files"". Now 10 years later with shows like ""LOST"" presenting mysteries and conspiracies like ""Nowhere Man"", the show's time has finally come.

This excellent release from Image Entertainment includes all 25 of the first season episodes. As extras we get commentary tracks including  video commentaries by Bruce Greenwood, producer Peter Dunne and creator/writer/producer Lawrence Hertzog. The video commentaries whomever is doing the commentary frequently presented in splitscreen with the episode itself. There are also traditional audio commentaries (they're separate though)as well as promos and interviews with Bruce Greenwood, Hertzog, Megan Gallagher, director Ian Toynton and others.

Image quality varies from quite good to very good. It's clear that the show was remastered from the original broadcast videotapes and not the finished filmed episodes themselves. My guess is that Image ran into the same problem here that they did with ""The Twilight Zone:1985/6"" where the studio (Buena Vista) wouldn't pay or allow them to go back to the original film masters to remaster them. Regardless, Image has done a stellar job with the source material. There is some minor issues with interlace errors and the image can occasionally look soft as well but, on the whole, the show looks extremely good.  The discs with the video commentaries are, essentially, holding four episodes so there are some digital artifacts such as aliasing that occasionally crop up but, on the whole, the series looks excellent. Dialogue and music come across crisp and clear on all the discs in this set providing fans with a good looking good sounding set. With nine discs in the set it doesn't feel as if too many has been crowded onto too few discs. All discs are in the dual layered/single side format. Having had to suffer through some of Universal's dual sided discs (which have had problems with quality control and also are more likely to be damaged), I'm happy that this has been presented in this deluxe format.

We also get Greenwood's promo outtakes for UPN, a couple of fine featurettes ""Networking"" where Hertzog discusses with former UPN Executive Mike Sullivan why this terrific critically acclaimed series got to air.  Sullivan comes across as intelligent and a sharp guy. He approved the show hoping that UPN's launch wouldn't be like the WB or other stations where low brow material dominated the airwaves. He also notes the challenges of a start up network but that's why he was willing to take a big risk on ""Nowhere Man"". ""Fact or Fiction"" features a mysterious former CIA operative discussing conspiracies in the real world as compared to the real world. He also discusses just how easy it would be to cut the tether to our identities away and lose who we are in the world. While it isn't to the extreme of ""Nowhere Man"" it is certainly frightening. We get a four page booklet that gives a synopsis of the plot and the special features for that particular episode. Also included are deleted/extended scenes compared to the finished version scenes done in a picture in picture format. Packaged similar to ""Moonlighting"" and other shows with plastic inserts holding the DVDs, this set doesn't use tape to hold the sets together but hinges which is a big improvement over previous sets. An exceptional job from Image at putting together a deluxe treatment of this important cult series.",1135555200,10,4427,4.974324324324324
2412462,5,B000BC8SXS,"I never looked forward to an hour of television more than I did each new episode of ""Nowhere Man.""  Its dark, paranoid stories excited me much more than those of its spiritual cousin, ""The X-Files.""  (Mark Snow composed the creepy music for both series).

The genius of this show was the abandonment of the long-time television formula whereby a drifting hero travels from place to place, helping others and leaving each better or happier than he found them.  Granted, it's a formula that works.  It kept us entertained with such shows as ""The Fugitive,"" ""The Incredible Hulk,"" and, dare I mention, ""Starman.""  What was so special about ""Nowhere Man"" was the inversion of this formula.  In spite of Tom's desire to help others, he destroys the lives of nearly everyone he meets along the way.  It was brilliant!

Paired malignantly with Star Trek: Voyager, it was not destined to last.  UPN did not respect its fans, and despite being the second highest rated show on the network (after Star Trek), it died an untimely death.  I still feel betrayed when I remember that ""Nowhere Man"" was replaced by the ever-so-classic, ""Home Boys from Outer Space.""

For years I have bemoaned the loss of this show and have praised it to all who would listen.  Now, with the release of the DVD's, those of us who are initiated can share this amazing program with any and all who would watch.",1135036800,3,1376,4.707112970711297

Back in the dark days when UPN had no quality shows (oh, wait, they still don't), they put this little gem out. Calling it the American Prisoner may be giving it a bit too much praise, but in many ways the comparison is apt.

Honestly, I am glad the series ended as it did. It explained the basic mystery which drove the series in an unexpected but decidedly logical way. Had the series gone on longer, odds are this mystery would have been dragged out to the point of tedium. As it stands, the later episodes of the series were starting to stretch credibility (see the VR episode). And while there was surely more to learn about the Big Conspiracy, that was hardly new and exciting territory. It told the tale, and got off while the getting was good.",1134691200,6,823,4.4144736842105265

2412465,5,B000BC8SXS,"More proof that TV is not a lost cause - Firefly is supporting evidence.

Nowhere man was a milestone in American TV. It is the US version of the UK series The Prisoner.

I am not so surprised that it was cancelled after a season, I am more shocked that it made on the air to begin with and lasted the season. This is a very thought provoking and cerebral story. This is not for the average ""Entertainment Tonight/Desperate Housewives"" TV viewer.

This show truly meant something and communicated it's message on a variety of levels. Elements of this show were exciting and in-your-face while other plot elements went deeper and were revealed often hours after you have seen an episode only after it sunk inand your brain absorbed the sublties.

There was not a single bad, dry or slow episode in the whole series. Every one was important and added another piece to the puzzle.

Plus there was absolutely no clue as to where the thing was headed until very close to the end. This was spectacularly well done and Bruce Greenwood was magnificent in his role.

This show so intrigued me I wrote a script for it. The show was cancelled before I presented it to the producer.

I was sad when it was cancelled but pleased that they were able to hastily put together a wrap for the story that while a little cryptic, not as surreal as the ending of The Prisoner.

I think The Prisoner is one of the true masterpieces of artistic TV production, and Nowhere Man is easily it's equal.

I can't wait for the release. I have to have this set. I made room for it right next to my Prisoner Megaset.",1134432000,25,1584,4.43448275862069

Update - January 20, 2006

I have been viewing ""The Prisoner"" episodes thanks to my newly obtained DVR. I concur - Nowhere Man mirrors The Prisoner in many ways; it is a wonderful tribute to the BBC series. I have embraced both, but tend to prefer the 'darkness' of Nowhere Man in most cases. Nevertheless, both are brilliant; Hertzog was clearly inspired by The Prisoner, and pays a wonderful tribute to the series by means of Nowhere Man. I'm honored to have been privy to both, and plan to purchase the Nowhere Man series as soon as I complete this review. WooHoo!!!",1133654400,3,752,4.522058823529412

public on the up-and-coming UPN.  Little did anyone know this show would become the standard by which future shows of its kind would be measured against!

Take a brilliant photographer who, in one split second (of about two minutes) is completely and utterly rendered an enigma.  Add to that, the relentless quest towards regaining your identity because you KNOW who you are.  Yet, all the while, forces beyond your control conspire to manipulate you and the world around you in the hopes of denying you your identity.  All the while, you're uncovering piece-by-piece why your identity was so totally vanquished.

8084989,5,B000BC8SXS,"A seriously under rated series that should have gone on to do greater things.  Picture the opening episode. Thomas Vale a professional photographer celebrating in a restaurant with his loving wife after a successful exhibition containing some controversial photos he took as a war reporter, returns from the bathroom to find his wife not in the restaurant and his identity completely erased. No one seems to know him and there is no proof he even existed! Thomas Vale is determined to find out who did this to him and why, and to exact revenge on the people who took his life away from him. Living as a fugitive, traveling from town to town, each episode unfolds a little bit more of the plot, giving pointers as to what happened and why until in the final episode we learn the truth about the man himself.  Loved Bruce Greenwood in the leading role. His depicting of a character hunted, living in quiet desperation yet also able to maintain a sense of kindness and humanity. A very thought provoking series, I couldn't wait to see how each episode turned out.
