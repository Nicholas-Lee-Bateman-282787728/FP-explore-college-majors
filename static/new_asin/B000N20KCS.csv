8539463,4,B000N20KCS,"I really enjoyed this video.  It is great for someone who is not real familiar with how to care for house plants such as: leaves that have burnt tips, the best time to water and fertilize and how much, how to take care of insects using house hold products and more.  It's not overwhelming either.  I was just looking for an updated version for household product suggestions, since it's now over 25yrs later since this video was released.  If you are wondering how to better care for your house plants and some of your outdoor plants to protect from insects, I recommend this video.  Enjoy!",1331942400,,589,4.571428571428571
