Oliver Reed gives a very good performance as the ailing Roderick Usher and Donald Pleasence is wonderful as his insane older brother Walter. The sets are also well done. Only a few elements of Poe's tale remains and the ending is pretty lousy, but overall it is an entertaining,well paced, and somewhat bizarre gothic horror film.",1326153600,,388,4.984615384615385

Doesn't anyone ever read the reviews before they are attached to the items??",1172016000,2,267,4.804347826086956
