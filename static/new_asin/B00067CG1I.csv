2171462,3,B00067CG1I,"While my cat loves the dvd, I thought it was really expensive considering it was an amateur production.",1164585600,2,103,4.777777777777778
2171463,5,B00067CG1I,"Prior to purchasing the DVD, I was a bit skeptical about whether my cat would be entertained or not, as he can bore easily without constant human contact. I put it in the player and intially, his ears perked up, but he left the room. However, within 5 minutes, his whole tale was bushed out and he was walking with his back arched back into the room. When he saw the screen, he got so excited that he ran up and jumped at the t.v.!

My cat was totally focused on the video. He now gets excited when I turn the t.v. on, he immediately goes right to it and sits down to watch (see picture under video images).

As for the video and sound quality, they are excellent. They did a great job capturing animals in their native habitats.

It is well worth the price. Knowing my cat can be entertained if I have something to do, is very reassuring.

It's 2 hours of multimedia fun for your feline!",1154908800,7,888,4.205882352941177
2171464,3,B00067CG1I,"This appeared to be the best of the available videos for cats, but my cat doesn't seem to be very interested in it so far.  The segments are somewhat disconnected; rather than one segment showing the same view for several minutes, there will be multiple short clips of different birds in a variety of settings.  Another thing that seems unnatural to me is that some of the views are extreme closeups, with a medium-sized bird occupying most of the TV screen.  If the clips were longer-lasting and at a reasonable scale, it might be better at making the cat feel as if she was looking out a window at a bird feeder.",1142380800,7,614,4.464285714285714
2171465,5,B00067CG1I,"I moved to a building with a view of a courtyard--not interesting enough for my neurotic, old kitty, who began licking her belly bald.  She doesn't jump around and attack the screen, but she enjoys watching this DVD; when I come home from a long, long day at work, she is often sitting on the bed looking at the computer screen where the DVD is playing.  She seems more playful with me in the evenings, more curious about her environment.  Licking herself bald has not stopped, but it has slowed down.",1140825600,7,501,4.483516483516484
2171466,4,B00067CG1I,"This DVD has my cats pawing at the television, trying to catch the birds and squirrels on the screen.  They go behind the TV trying to find the critters ""inside.""  One of my cats actually runs into the room whenever he hears the TV go on...he crouches on his belly and stares at the screen hopefully.  The length of the two video programs are great--the cats lose interest before the end, usually. But  there is a looping option to have them run over and over if you like. The soundtrack of chirping birds and chuckling squirrels is not at all obnoxious to have on in the background while you are doing something else.

 If I have any complaints it is that there is a bit too much close-up action (cats like the flitting of birds and hopping of squirrels, which you can only appreciate from a little distance), and the spiders and bees leave them completely cold.  If there were an option for 4.5 stars, I would give this DVD that score.

If you have indoor cats who sometimes seem to be bored, this is a GREAT diversion for them.  I am glad I bought it and I would recommend it highly to any cat owner.",1127088000,10,1103,4.315533980582524
2171467,5,B00067CG1I,"I took my dog to the pet store recently where they had the feathers for felines video playing. My dog noticed it playing and I had to literally drag her away, she loved it!! I bought a copy and played it when we got home. She sat in front of the TV and tried catching the birds as they flew away, she watched until the very end!

4 paws up here!!",1122336000,8,346,3.8732394366197185
2171468,5,B00067CG1I,""" What a great way to keep my 3 indoor cats busy and entertained! I already had a couple of other cat videos but found that the music and lack of action didn't always work for my 'girls'.  With this DVD I can't keep them away from the TV. It goes for 2 hours and do they have a ball!  Even Snowball, the eldest of the trio at 11 years, gets into the stalking, crouching and swatting of the birds, squirrels and other cat favourites.  Unfortunately, my downstairs neighbour borrowed my copy for her cat. She's enjoying it so much that I'll likely have to get another one to replace it. Highly recommended. 5 stars out of 5!""",1119139200,9,623,4.262711864406779
2171469,4,B00067CG1I,"Both of my cats were immediately captivated by this DVD and were engaged the entire two hours. The second hour ""special edition"" included clips with squirrels and chipmunks that seemed to get them especially excited. I was surprised that the next morning one of my cats went to the TV and started looking around, it seemed to me that she wanted to watch again so I put it on and she happily sat in front of the TV talking and touching the screen. Her brother was attracted by the sounds and came in to join her.

Because it is a DVD it can be set up to run as a continuous program if you want to leave it running when not home. Lucy gave it 4 stars only because she wanted more squirrels and chipmunks and found the aquarium scenes boring.",1109721600,14,739,4.24113475177305
8039653,5,B00067CG1I,"Don't worry what others say about picture quality. Your kitty won't care and the quality is fine. My cat immediately perked up and went over to the TV and stood on his hind legs trying to get at the birds. He has other cat videos but this one has moved to the top of his list. He loves seeing birds flitting around bird houses making pecking movements. This one has lots of variety which keeps his attention longer. I have a crows dvd, just crows on a tree limb for a solid hour and that one just scares him. Now as soon as he sees me putting a dvd in the player he gives me that look -  is it my dvd you are putting in .",1222992000,,621,3.8897637795275593
8039654,4,B00067CG1I,"Although I found this DVD to be a little over priced, I must say our cats enjoy it. (2) of our previously indoor/outdoor cats are now indoor only cats, and this has helped to amuse them, and to ease their initial frustration of no longer being allowed to go  outdoors.

The birds and squirrels are in your face, especially since we play it on a big screen TV. The bird sounds are great as well, so that even when the cats are in another room, the birds chirps drawn them to the other room.

Recommended.",1220832000,,503,4.273684210526316
8039655,4,B00067CG1I,"My cat loves this video, at least for about 15 - 30 minutes at a time, which is OK with me.  I don't expect her attention span to be as lengthy as mine anyway.  There was a lot to hold her interest, however I do have a few gripes...  The production seemed a bit amateurish, and there were way too many shots of bluejays, especially closeups of them.  On the plus side, I liked the squirrels sneaking up to the camera on the railings to get the peanuts.  All in all, I do think it's worth it, and so does my cat apparently.",1204934400,,522,4.029126213592233
8039656,5,B00067CG1I,"My youngest cat, a Maine Coon named Patsy, has hijacked my TV to watch this! She gets right up in front of it and puts her paw on the screen indicating it's time for her video while I'D like to watch something else.
This is a series of views of backyard wildlife. The production is not all that bad for what it is actually. Perhaps for those who live in an apartment and can't have a birdfeeder, this might satisfy. I enjoy watching the birds outdoors so it's not a real strain to sit and watch with Patsy as she likes. I compare it to sharing the favorite movie of a two year old child who has watched the story several thousand times yet continues to find it inspiring. Oh what the heck.
This video gets a two paws up from Patsy. She LOVES it and that makes me happy too.",1202601600,,773,4.125827814569536
8039657,1,B00067CG1I,This appeared to be a pirated copy of a canadian video. It was of very poor visual quality and did not even get any interest out of the two cats for whom it was intended. Do not recommend. The scenes were very repeatative as well.,1201132800,,230,4.133333333333334
8039658,4,B00067CG1I,"This was a great DVD for at least one of my 2 cats.  Emma sat for a few hours just watching the birds and squirrels.  When a bird flew across the screen she actually moved and was looking out the window thinking the bird flew there.  She was thoroughly fasinated with the whole dvd.  M other cat, Shadow, sat for a few minutes but didn't show any interest in it.  I imagine it is something to put on looping when you are not at home.  It will keep your cat occupied and keep them from getting lonely while you are away.",1201046400,,519,4.089108910891089
8039659,4,B00067CG1I,"Our cat LOVES this DVD. The second she heard the birds chirping she came to check it out, and couldn't stop watching. Sometimes she tries to paw the screen to catch something. Every time she hears birds singing now she thinks it's time for her show. The drawback is she has started sitting right in front of the TV so we can't see it, any time she thinks the show is on or hopes it will come on. I don't know how she can stand it but she often watches the birds on our 37 inch widescreen from two inches away. She likes the squirrels and stuff in part two also, but it's the bird chirping sounds that really catch her attention. Therefore I think this DVD is probably better than some of the others that have music. This has some quiet spots but is basically nonstop animal sounds and movement.

I would give this five stars but the quality is low since it's clearly a transfer from VHS format. I also think it might be improved by longer sequences showing the same bird (this cuts from scene to scene very quickly), and some more long-distance shots would be nice (it's mostly closeups). But none of these things seem to bother my cat much, she's nuts about it.

One benefit of having the DVD instead of video is the infinite loop option, which plays through both parts sequentially and then starts again. So I can put this on when I leave the house and I know the cat will have some entertainment for as long as I'm away.",1181692800,2,1423,4.3059701492537314
8039660,4,B00067CG1I,"The introduction of this DVD to my house is akin to the CIA's introduction of crack cocaine to south central LA in the 80's.  Now everytime I turn on my TV my cat goes crazy - I fear for the safety of my home electronics.

But seriously, the quality is low, but the cat doesn't mind.  I think that $25 is too much, but really it's just a testament to how far we cat owners will go to make those little furballs happy/cracky.",1176163200,2,424,4.0843373493975905
8039661,4,B00067CG1I,"If your cats sit in windowsills and make ungodly noises as birds fly by ... if they spring into action whenever a squirrel comes within a 100-yard radius ... if they've been stung more than once playing ""catch the wasp"" ... you NEED this DVD.

I will say that I cannot leave my cats unsupervised while it's on, since they bat at, jump on and generally attempt to climb through the TV while they watch, but this is prime entertainment for both the cat and the cat-watching public.

The production values are admittedly poor (I have a big screen plasma TV and the first feature in particular is exceedingly grainy). However, the cats don't seem to care, so I can't mark it down too much for that. I just hope they come out with a high-def version soon.",1169078400,3,750,4.427536231884058
8039662,5,B00067CG1I,"I have 4 felines (2 boys-almost 9 and 2 girls 1&1/2 yrs).  The first time I pressed play-that was it!!!  Jaz-zee is obsessed with it! When I come down stairs, she is sitting in front of the TV - looks at TV and then at me and over, etc...This happens morning and night.  She did hit her head on the TV screen a few times.

I am a pharmacist and people will call me when they have a problem with their kitty.  Works for me!  I hope to find another DVD that is just as good and I will buy them their own DVD player.  If we burn it up, I will buy another one!!

First review I have written.  I know several people who have cats and this is going on the Christmas/birthday present list for a couple of my friends.

Enjoy!!  Between the DVD and the Cat Claws Organic Catnip, everyone at my house is pretty mellow!",1168214400,4,808,4.018867924528302
