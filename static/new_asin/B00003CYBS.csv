1312343,5,B00003CYBS,"This is a powerful film. There are no other epithets that describe it. Gitai is able to draw us into teh conflict from the very first shots that capture the desolation of three long refugee camps along a deserted road.  The excellent photography of Renato Berta is very effective and matches the director's intent.  The realism of war is interpreted in all its crudeness and, at the same time, with desperate humanity.  The story leaves no space to memory and focuses on human suffering, the rescue operations and the aid provided to the wounded.  The article also poses the question as to what constitutes moral cinema. The answer, is suggested, is the film ""Kippur"". The realism of the screenplay renders with uncanny clarity the horror and the absurdity of any war. This point of view, Amos Gitai's point of view is valid well beyond the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Gitai does not blame one or the other side, but he takes the audience at the epicenter of the chaos that is a war against men - regardless of colour, nation or creed",1074902400,9,1036,4.738888888888889
1312344,4,B00003CYBS,"Its good to see an Isreali film-maker show an un-flattering portrait of war.  Past films about Isreal have always lauded the so-called heroic frontier spirit of Isreali's farmers living on the lands taken from the moribund palestinians.  Here we see some of the price Isrealis have paid in order to maintain their state amidst a hostile and confused Arab world.
This is not your standard war movie.  There are virtually no combat scenes.  Once the war is shown it consists of a series of rescues from the battlefield by medical personnel.  We see the aftermath and cost of combat, without the usual heroics involved.  The style of the film is a bit redundant, but perhaps purposely so.  The average viewer may become quickly bored, but its worth sticking it out to the end more or less.  The main scene of action are the constant rescues from the ongoing battle, mostly Isreali tankers who suffered heavy losses in the 1973 War as a result of Improved Soviet anti-tank technology which the Syrians and Egyptians poossessd.  The Yom Kipper War cost Isreal some 3,000 casualties, and the Arabs more than 8,000.  It was a brutal, costly war, and the film shows the price Isreal paid to repel the invasion.  I give this Isreali film-maker a lot of credit for making a film like this, even if a bit slow and monotonous at times.  You do get to see a lot of Chieftain tanks churning around in the background moving from position to position while under fire.  The end scene where the protagonists are shot down in the helocoptor by the surface to air missile is very realistic and quite shocking.
The film has a symetry to it in that the lead character ends up back with his girl friend where they indulge in some interesting kinky sex with paints and oils which I suppose are meant to reflect the colors of peace and war. Oddly enough I found this one of the most interesting aspects of the movie!  Considering this is probably one of the only films available in the English speaking world about the 1973 Yom Kippur War its worth looking at just for that reason.  I doubt the Arabs could or would produce anything different or better.  I am glad to see that Isreali cinema has the courage to make a film like this.  Ariel Sharon should see this film to remind him again what the costs of war can be.  He played a principle part in the conflict.",1063670400,6,2339,4.541766109785203
1312345,5,B00003CYBS,"Cinema has come a long way since ""The Dirty Dozen"". I think that this portrayal of the 1973 war in the Golan Heights is one of the first films to actually project an image of war as its naked ugly self. No inspirational film score, no inflated heroism. The emotions are of helplessness, confusion, fear, uncertainty. The images are damp, gray, green and mud. This film has been knocked for a lack of coherency, shallow dialogues, drawn out and monotonous scenes - BUT THAT'S EXACTLY THE POINT THAT'S BEING MADE!!! The Yom Kippur War was anything but coherent for all sides - Israel, Syria, and Egypt. I think that anyone interested to experience the less glamorous and more frank side of war should see this film.",1012348800,13,713,4.666666666666667
1312346,5,B00003CYBS,"KIPPUR is a great film that is bound to get a negative response from general American audiences that are too used to the narrative cliques, characters, scenarios and general plot devises that have become the prerequisite elements in American war films of the past several decades(i.e. fast and disorienting battle scenes cut with slow metaphorical dramatic moments and flashback sequences). KIPPUR intellingently avoids these things NOT just for the sake of being different or to bore or annoy the audience but to show that the particular war being portrayed is an entirely different one altogether. What KIPPUR has accomplished through it's one-day time frame and linear narrative is the banality and monotany of a conflict like this. A war that seems almost like a dream to its inhabitants(the films moody slow jazz score contributes to this feel). The two main characters at the beginning of the film are literally ""driving"" to war, shooting the breeze as if going to a regular day of work. Here is a conflict that has dragged on for so long, that is has become engraved in the very culture and everyday routines of its people. You can see it in the faces of emotionally repressed men who have become desensitized to the violence and only become distraught when their initial defenses are broken down. The long take of the soldiers dragging and dropping the injured through the mud culminating in the weaping and arguing of the men clearly conveys the pointlessness of it all. These men cry not mainly because of a sense of indignation or sorrow but more out of sheer frustration. However, even despite these epiphanal moments of the human condition that are supposed to be self changing, the men really just want to get through the day and go home and continue there regular lives. Indeed, they do return home, unchanged, continuing their domestic routines, Slowly losing their soul. RECOMMEDED VIEWING.",1003190400,21,1907,4.981191222570533

1312479,5,B00003CYBS,"Kippur is one the great war films ever made.  Compared to other films about human conflicts, Kippur takes a microscopic view of people caught up in a disaster and how they try to survive it with no heroes, no false structures, no big battle scenes, nothing but the grim reality of war.  Few films approach this masterpiece, perhaps Hamburger Hill, or Fires on the Plain.  People narcotized by Saving Private Ryan cannot see the sere beauty here.  Tarnovsky's Andre Rublev is a major influence here, and if you are interested you might want to watch it before to see how a 15th Century Ikon painter's life can be transmuted into a major war in the 20th century.

It's hard to find a better war movie than this one. Kippur is a great war film -- period. War movies as a genera are perhaps my most favorite. This is no Saving Private Ryan; no Fury; no The Pacific; no Band of Brothers and no Bridge Too Far. This is a foreign, war film not an American war film. Kippur demands a lot of its viewer. A viewer has to apply a story to the manifested action if a story is necessary. So what if there is hardly a discernible plot. If there is very little to this plot, well, that is the point. Action of the film occurs within a small span of real time, a couple of days. In real life is there a discernible plot to events within a duration of a few days? Most of this film's cinematic shots are very, very long in which no dialogue is heard. For example, in one scene what is seen is a face of a character, seated in a helicopter, the cinematic frame -- a mid-range-shot. The camera is fixed on him. He looks ponderously at landscape from a window of a helicopter in flight. At his time a viewer must put thoughts to the character, or not put thoughts to him -- maybe just wonder what he is thinking about. Most anyone in those same circumstance would silently look out a window. Most often on the ground the character with his comrades scramble hurriedly from place to place to retrieve wounded and get them in a helicopter. This film has its own sense of cinematic style. A  documentary sense is brought to mind. The style of this film is what I call realistic-naturalism. Realistic action shows how anyone would naturally respond under those same conditions in which the characters find themselves.",1426377600,,1805,4.404191616766467

Unfortunately, the confusion, aimlessness and tedium are conveyed by being recreated literally, and those are not what most people watch movies to experience, so - be warned.
Imagine if a regular soldier had worn a GoPro to the Yom Kippur war, then edited out the sleeping, eating and defecating, and uploaded it to youtube.  This is a little more tightly edited than that, but not much: Amos Gitai seems never to have seen a scene that would be better if cut shorter.

1312810,4,B00003CYBS,"It would be hard for me to find a war more just than Yom Kippur.  A small nation fighting for it's life, far outnumbered and outgunned, totally surrounded and pinned against the sea.  In Vietnam and recently in Iraq, it seems that the just war depends on a person's political opinion, even though we must of course fully support our troops sent in harms way by our government.  But, YK seems like a no-brainer.  I think the director was trying to point out that even in the most just of wars, there is still waste, physical and mental damage and futility along with doubt as to the worthiness of the cause.  Is it worth one human life?  Is it worth the mental terror makes every combat soldier a casualty?  At the end, the helo pilot said he had been asked to fly Dyan to the front, but told them to have him take the bus.  Figure out that line, and you have his thesis, perhaps.  Fighting for the life of the nation vs fighting for your own life and it's value?

On a practical side, the movie has lots of great IDF tank shots that are of value for the modeller or armor freak.  I think this is a decent movie and well worth watching if you are interested in the psychology of war, the IDF or armor.  It does have some minor nudity at the beginning and end (the artsy shots) and cursing in Hebrew.",1389830400,,1298,4.2317073170731705
1312811,1,B00003CYBS,"The Yom Kippur War was one of the most incredible contests of arms of the Twentieth Century; Israel, against impossible odds, managed to turn a disasterous beginning into a complete victory against overwhelming invading forces.
If you want to learn the dynamics of that war; how it was planned by Russian advisors and executed by Syrian and Egyptian armored forces; how unprepared and surprised Israeli forces absorbed the near fatal impact of the first assault and improvised a winning strategy, how America's just in time resupply of exhausted stores snatched success from the throat of the Arab forces;
You will have to find it elsewhere, it is not in this film.
Apparently the movie makers wish to show the futility of war by showing only futile actions by powerless actors.
How did the war start? It just fell out of the sky like a meteor.
How was it fought? In utter futility.
A aerial shot of an empty field full of tracks from armored vehicles that have gone on to somewhere else, shows the utter futility of trying to understand the battle by the marks left on an empty field by armored vehicles that have gone on to somewhere else.

It leaves ugly questions twisting in your guts. But like film when it is powerful, images come back and sit in the memory, prompting questions. It does not attempt to explain Israel or occupation but it tells well the stories of men going into war. The human cost is evident. The lack of cohesion as violence disintegrates into engagement; strategy is not evident in battles which seem almost random, even isolated and chaotic, shambolic. But at the core is the medical team and their efforts to get wounded soldiers out of war zones and save lives by risking their own. It is evident as the film progresses that trauma is something that comes after, that in this exercise there is no time to reflect. It is reactive to events outside of the control of the protagonists. And this is this film's strength. This film becomes many years later the reflection on part of the Yom Kippur War.

I agree for the most part with Tsuyoshi's review above and his advice is good. For someone that is interested immersing themselves in the experience of war without any Hollywood glamour this film does a splendid job. The scenes like getting stuck in the Golan mud while trying to carry a stretcher convey both the pain of training (what most of a soldier's experience is really about) and the frustration of war. Looking for more action? Not in this film, there is a reason that in the military that the old saying goes: ""hurry up and wait"".

I have often had friends that ask 'what was life like in the army?' and this film is a very good answer to that. I would gladly watch the film again with friends and recommend the film highly to those who understand what it is meant to be.

Other Israeli films in the same genre about war: ""Beaufort"" 2007 and ""Ricochets"" 1986 (no longer in circulation)",1254787200,6,1006,4.491803278688525
1312888,5,B00003CYBS,"An amazing film.  I've served in both the U.S. and Israeli militaries, and seen combat in both.  This is the closest thing to reality I've ever seen in a film.

The confusion of the Yom Kippur War is legendary.  I lost my brother and his wife during the first few days.  This film is hard to watch, seeing the Israeli military of which I am so proud, struggle and stagger under hammer blows from Syria and Egypt.  The traffic jams of civilians and military mixed up in complete confusion.  The radio playing urgent announcements set to martial music followed by tapioca pop music.  The newspaper announcements casually announcing cancellations of graduations and excursions, along with ""Be strong and courageous"" exhortations.

To anyone expecting a Hollywood ""guts and glory film"", or a peacenik ""all soul searching and folly of war"" story, go elsewhere - but it is YOU who SHOULD see this film.  No epic battle scenes set to stirring music.  The war is in the background yet all around.  This is the war a foot soldier sees.  Confusion, tedium, sadness, friendship...  The scene in the mud is devastatingly gruelling - sorry Hollywood movie lovers, you're not going to see the hero, just finished reading a love letter from his sweetheart grabbing a wounded man and carrying him out single handed.  No.  Four burly men, stuck in an impossible situation, struggling to get one man out.  The end of the scene is devastating, and the actors convey just how hopeless their characters feel.  The scenes of fields torn to shreds by tanks, no apparent reason or order in the trails, is stunning.

There are so many amazing scenes in this film.  The stark reality is brutal and pitiless.  The helicopter crash landing is handled in a perfect way - no explosions and heroics, just men struggling to survive.  As in real life, the survivors are not jumping into action, nor is there one hero who takes charge.  They are stunned and hurt, the world stands still.

This film is a must see.  This film is Israel.  There is no bravado or flag waving, no depictions of ""evil Arabs"" (in one scene, the characters are looking at a newspaper, and grow quiet upon seeing a photo of a captured Syrian).  Neither is there any scene of ""evil Israelis"" trying to oppress anyone or using dirty tricks.  It is a depiction of a country at war, no marches, no speeches.  A wounded pilot saying he wants to be with his mother.  Two soldiers talking, and one saying ""Here I was going to say I miss my girlfriend, and you've just told me about your mother and the Nazis"".  This is Israel. No miracles, paperwork in a hospital. No charges up hills, just confusion on a road.  Used Fiats and soldiers grumbling about officers behind their backs.

1312889,2,B00003CYBS,How is it possible to make a war movie boring? especially one about as dramatic of an event as the 1973 October War? well these folks managed to do it. After what seemed like a promising start showing a very huiman element and realistic experience - traffic jams etc - it never built up or got unstuck from that sense of smallness and triviality. It was a disappointing movie and I had difficulty finishing it.,1235433600,,410,4.48
1312890,3,B00003CYBS,"The movie takes place during the Yom Kippur war of 1973.  However, it really isn't about the war itself so don't expect to learn much about it.  That was the first bit of disappointment for me.  Rather the movie is a personal account of two reservists who are trying to catch up to their unit and end up on a helicopter crew collecting wounded soldiers.  So it about their experience of war, the emotions they get caught up in and the lived of people they encounter in the process.

The movie pretty slow and somewhat boring.  It takes a while for the plot to start developing and there are long shots of just gazing and watching.  I suppose if I expected the movie to have this focus rather than being about the Yom Kippur war itself, then I may not view it this way.  But I kept waiting to see an encounter with the Syrians and it never came.

The movie is framed with a bizarre opening and closing scene of love making, which really does not have much to do with the movie.  I suppose it was meant to be an artistic expression of a life in Israel -- where the surreal and ordinary goes hand in hand.  Where one leaves a peaceful home, goes to war and returns back as if nothing had happened.",1223424000,2,1194,4.238938053097345
1312891,1,B00003CYBS,"This movies is lacking any form of plot or story line, it is also stretched unnecessarily. Gitai obviously created this movie for propaganda purposes. Basically the same scenes appear over an over again just in different settings. I had expect, being a veteran of that war, that he would be able to translate the pain and suffering of the reservists into the concept of the movie but the failed terribly.
The fact that amazed me the most is the lack detail. The injured soldiers mostly are completely unresponsive if they are not vital to the hardly existing story and for some reason none of them (the ones in the field) have any physical injuries visible.
Probably the only more disappointing aspect of this movie, aside from the directing, is the acting of the main characters. Not convincing and often very amateurish.
Overall, if this movie is not 99 cents, don't waste your money.",1207094400,4,886,4.7973856209150325
1312892,1,B00003CYBS,"I was looking forward to an interesting movie about the Yom Kippur war, and I mean interesting and not necessarily a thriller with lots of blood. This movie managed to be utterly boring.  There is no story line, no climax, you learn nothing about the Yom Kippur war, its context or anything relating to it, and not really anything about the characters either. The shots are endless, especially of the same tracks and the same tanks again and again and the same injured soldiers. The only thing I learned was that a lot of stretchers were used during the war. The content of this movie was just about enough for a short film, especially if you take out the long sex scenes in the beginning and end, which were apparently only there to add time and to maybe wake you up at the end.  Somehow Gitai seems to have thought an art movie means an utterly pretentious, boring movie. What an utter disappointment!",1151366400,15,903,4.533742331288344
1312893,4,B00003CYBS,"""Kippur"" is not your typical war movie.  There are no heroes - just two reservists who get swept up in the backwash of the 1973 Yom Kippur war while looking for their already mobilized and departed unit.  It is like one of those nightmares where you know you have to be somewhere to take an exam/go to an interview/go to work, and somehow, you just can't get there.
Kippur tells us almost nothing about the details of the 1973 campaign (which Israel, surprised, came fairly close to losing, since it is really after conveying the sheer randomness and chaos of war from the worm's eye point of view. Unlike our modern Iraq adventures, it is likely the average grunt knew very little about what was happening in the next town or valley, or whether the war was being own or lost.  The persepctive was interesting to someone raised with the media-enhanced viewpoint, after the 1967 war, that the Israeli military ran like a Swiss watch.  In ""Kippur"", we learn that like our own army mired in Iraq, these are just weekend soldiers trying to get by.
This is a European-flavoured film, so it is bookended by equally dreamlike sex scenes (""Thin Red Line"" tried this in a tamer way) which makes the movies' R-rating well deserved.",1084838400,19,1221,4.638888888888889
