8112819,1,B000EQ5UZA,"I grew up watching Cantinflas. I know there is no way to fill those shoes, but this movie was far from anything I expected. The acting is terrible and that paired with the horrible audio of the video makes for a huge disappointment.",1366156800,,232,4.4186046511627906
8112820,4,B000EQ5UZA,"When Bruce Lee died in 1973, Hong Kong and Asian filmmakers made literally countless, campy ""Bruce-ploitation"" films that showed Lee back in action as played by imitators such as Ho Chung Tao, Dragon Lee, and others. No Hay Derecho, Joven(2006, It's Not Fair, Young Man)is a campy comedy with Mario Ramirez playing Mario Moreno Cantinflas, Mexico's famous comic actor and humanitarian. Cantinflas(Ramirez)tries to sneak his way into heaven and St. Peter(Julio Aleman)punishes him by putting him in purgatory! St. Peter, Justice(Itati Cantoral), and Satan review Cantinflas' life and are going to judge him in heaven's court. By the way, Justice(as played by Itati Cantoral) is smokin' sexy! The actor who plays Satan is a hoot and Valentina(Angelina Santana)is ultra cute! We must give Mario Ramirez his due credit; he gave a sincere performance as Cantinflas.
 This film is campy, but it does have heart, soul and pathos. Cantinflas is reunited with his wife Valentina Ivonova; she died in 1966. This film has references to Cantinflas' films such as El Bolero de Raquel and A Volar, Joven, but it also has references to Beetlejuice, Wired, and The Simpsons(Satan is sleeping and wearing novelty glasses that make his eyes look open). This film is fun, lighthearted family entertainment, but a serious, sincere Cantinflas biopic should be made one day.",1237334400,2,1352,5.2304147465437785
8112821,3,B000EQ5UZA,"Mexican comedian Mario Ramirez stars in this fictionalized story of Cantinflas. The film develops with the death of Cantinflas in a  realistic recreation complete with  screaming ambulances and ultimately flat lines in the hospital. Then the comedy begins. Cantinflas works his way up to the pearly gates, cons people in line by fast talking with his famous ""cantiflar"" speech  style, only to have St. Peter tell him he must wait in purgatory because his number beongs at the back of the line. This is a place where the devil and a sweet female angel via for his soul in comedic courtroom fashion. Cantinflas watches his life as the represenatives of heaven and hell argue it's merits in silly dialogues. In essence you see the major goings on in the development of the genius Mexican comic's life. The recreation of his life his well done by actor Ramirez as he portrays Cantinflas exceptionally. Eventually his fate is determined. How can you condemn a man for making people laugh, forget their problems and be happy? The movie is flawed production wise as the audio track is horrible. By making purgatory, in the midst of a fog machine, draped in a white set that apparently was sound proofed to sound like an otherworldly echo, with the result being poor sound clarity. There is a major difference between the side by side tracks where they are in purgatory and where Ramirez is recreating a part of the life of Cantinflas. This is a major distraction that requires reference to the subtitles otherwise it would be unintelligible for the most part. Otherwise this is a pleasant little movie for fans of Cantinflas. Ramirez nails his performance, especially when he goes into his rhetoric, long winded speeches that are known as ""to cantiflar."" A simple movie, a simple message based on the life of one of the great comedians of the twentieth century who grew out of a Mexican hoboesque character often compared to Charles Chaplin. This is a comedy that the whole family can enjoy.",1199923200,,1984,4.829411764705882
