939093,5,6304910150,"Have always loved this movie. Four couples who are good friends, all with their quirks and comedic personalities. Knit together they are rather endearing. The music is fabulous, and the scenery is really lovely too. But the characters....such a wonderful blend of fun, sensitive, naive, idealistic, loving that you just can't help liking them.",1508716800,,343,5.37037037037037
939094,5,6304910150,Alda's greatest performance ever!  I love it when he gets so angry that he trashes the place at the end of the movie.  Oscar performance.  That moose is his expense.,1508544000,,165,4.433333333333334
939095,5,6304910150,"Written and directed by Alan Alda, three couples meet annually for a fun time. The meetings are in different locations and span four seasons. The story is of the relationship of the couples to each other and the other couples. We also deal with divorce and distraught children. To top it all off we even deal with a rusty Mercedes.

We get to hear Vivaldi in the background and look at many great outdoor scenes. With repeated viewing one can see many dimensions tare were overlooked originally.",1505952000,5,495,4.689655172413793

939100,5,6304910150,"This movie is an absolute delight.  The writing is fantastic and the acting is outstanding.  For those who have been married for a number of years, you'll find yourself nodding in agreement with the sentiments expressed by the characters.  For those who are just starting married life, it might help give perspective.  I don't mean to imply this movie is a sort of guide to marriage and relationships in general.  It would appeal to anyone who enjoys watching movies that are rich enough in content and acting to make you laugh, cry and think.",1497312000,,543,4.73404255319149

939163,3,6304910150,"I watched this a long time ago. It is a fairly funny movie. I may watch in the near future. The one downside is jack weston. I remember he was a dentist in the film. He goes into a long discussion about what it would  take to pass his certification for the state. Totally annoying, long, unnecessary and unfunny.",1492128000,,312,4.288135593220339

939170,5,6304910150,"I always remembered this movie (I'm 60) because of Sandy Dennis' elegance.  But when I watched all these many years later, it just had too many slapstick scenes.  I had also forgotten how Alan Alda always took himself so ""seriously.""  Still was great watching Rita Moreno on a rainy afternoon.",1487030400,,293,4.82

939854,5,6304910150,"I admit that I was never a fan of MASH the tv show (though I love the 1970 film!) However, Alan Alda's ""The Four Seasons"" has been one of my all-time favorite movies since I was a kid and watched it with friends. We decided that when we were grown we would do the same thing as the couples in this movie- take a vacation together every season. Unfortunately we did not end up sticking to that plan which is sad but also echoes the sentiment in the movie that friends pass out of your life for whatever reason- as Carol Burnett says: you realize they become just another pain in the ass and it becomes inconvenient to stay friends with them... This is sad but true. I never get tired of watching this film. It is so profound and so true to life that I feel like the characters were based on my life. The vulnerability of Alan Alda's character, the quirkiness of Jack Weston's, the humor of Carol Burnett's- all are so real and true to life. The script is perfect, the characters great and the cast amazing- one could not have asked for more. Vivaldi's music is the icing on the cake. This movie is beautifully written with such fantastic humorous dialogue that I could quote every line from it and never get tired of watching it. Rita Moreno and Len Cariou are also perfect in their roles. This is just a perfect little movie- I don't have one bad thing to say about it except I wish there were more- like 5 sequels! I wanted to keep following these people much the same way I wanted to follow the characters from ""The Big Chill."" Thank you, Alan Alda, for writing and directing a perfect movie. This and ""Peggy Sue Got Married"" are my faves!",1400371200,,1641,4.3311688311688314

How can it not be with Carol Burnett & Alan Alda at the helm! Because the center of the story is how one of the couples has a divorce & the effects this has on all those involved.  The movie though made some years back, still resonates with us today in our constantly changing times.

939928,5,6304910150,"Let's set aside for a moment that I adore Alan Alda and Carol Burnett both star in this wonderfully warm movie. A story of three couples who make plans to go away every season to do something different, skiing, sailing and so on. Their relationships change and get increasingly complex when one of the couples divorces and (Ginny) a young attractive partner enters the scene.

The dialogue is charming and poignant. The arguments between the couples are realistic and pragmatic. The marital and divorce issues are real and intelligently dealt with.

Alda and Burnett light up the screen with their presence and interaction. Rita Moreno is amazing in her role as an Italian wife married to a neurotic dentist Jack Weston.

As for the scene where the newest couple are making out in the boat, I have tears running down my cheeks. And on finding them naked in the water Moreno suggests her husband is ""waiting for her to do the backstroke."" So funny!

And to add to the wonderful atmosphere this movie creates for the watcher, the seasons changes come with Antonio Vivaldi's Four Season's violin music. With every season the music changes and I found myself smiling with the beautiful scenery. Although not a new movie, it is a worthwhile one.",1378339200,,1240,4.807511737089202

I had watched the Carol Burnett Show (soooo FUNNY), & M*A*S*H (Funny & meaningful), so Carol Burnett & Alan Alda were the main reasons to watch. All the characters I loved. The story was great because that's what I grew up with; my mom & dad had so many friends and many of them were that close.

Makes working out on the treadmill a pleasure!

OK, I don't know the man so I can't comment on that but I do think he's a pretty smart guy. The Four Seasons is sharp, witty and entertaining but not mean-spirited like, say, some Woody Allen movies can be. It's also not dirty so you can watch it with your grandma and there are a lot of truths in it. Very fun and has held up over the years. Why doesn't Alan Alda do a reunion movie of these characters?

I had a look on the internet for it recently without realising that it was available on Amazon, and as soon as I made my discovery I ordered a copy.  We watched ""The Four Seasons"" a weekend ago at my parents home, and rediscovered a movie that is of excellent quality!

There is no doubt that Alan Alda is a very great actor, writer and director - without reservation!

940106,3,6304910150,"A rather trivial movie, but sufficiently full of stars to be entertaining. Alan Alda plays Jack Burroughs, a lawyer, and Carol Burnett plays his wife. Jack Weston plays Danny Zimmer, a dentist, and Rita Moreno plays his Italian-American wife. Len Cariou plays Nick Callan, an insurance broker who refers to himself as an estate planner. Sandy Dennis plays Anne, his wife who is a neurotic photographer who makes superb photographs of vegetables.

These three couples are in the habit of taking vacations together, and in the opening scenes, they are sharing a farm house in the country, celebrating how much they all love each other and how nothing can break them up. You know that is too good to last.

During the vacation, Nick confides in Jack that after 21 years of marriage, he's planning to leave Anne. He says there's nobody ""waiting in the wings,"" but by their summer vacation renting a sailboat, he has brought along an adorable bikini-filling blonde named Ginny (Bess Armstrong). Needless to say, the group dynamics have changed drastically.

The rest of the movie concerns a vacation in the fall to visit Beth Burroughs and Lisa Callan at college (both played by Alda daughters), when Anne shows up and checks into the hotel as Mrs. Callan. Since Nick has brought Ginny along in that capacity, things are seriously awkward.

The fourth season is a skiing vacation, and I won't give away any details, just in case it is not all quite as predictable as I found it. Yes, there is humor and there is also pathos, but I had a hard time separating myself from the take-it-for-granted money that allows them to have such expensive vacations, not worry about arguments so loud that us lesser folk would get booted out of restaurants and hotels, and damage caused by temper tantrums. Money is simply not relevant to these people, and that's my limitation and not the movie's.

940188,3,6304910150,"Ha, so I think you should be able to draw from my review title that I can easily compare this film to `Tyler Perry's: Why Did I Get Married?' and honestly, I feel very similar about the two films.  If you've read my review for the other one (it stirred much heated debate and actually garnered me some hate mail) you'd know that I was not a huge fan.  While I admitted to liking the film I also stated that I felt it had a lot of issues (not the least of which was Janet Jackson).  I feel the same here.  In parts I like this movie, but as a whole I don't think it works quite like everyone else seems to say it does.

I think most of you are delusional, but whatever.

The film tells of three couples who have been friends for many years and who take vacations together every season.  The film takes place over the course of four seasons (or a year for those of you not mathematically inclined) and it shows the strain the friendships come over thanks to getting older.  Nick expresses his desire to leave his wife Anne during the first season, and that sets off a chain reaction as the couples now have to get used to his newer, younger woman.  Jack and Kate seem the most stable of the other two couples, while Claudia and Danny are apparently not as happy as they once were; both needing a spark to ignite their love for one another.

Like I said; in parts this is good.

When looking over this season for season I have come to terms with what works and what doesn't.  For instance; the overall plot of six friends shifting in their relationship over the course of the year works, but the way that Alda develops his characters does not.  This is a major problem because it takes away from the genuineness of the film and it makes it hard to relate to the characters.  I understand that people have flaws, so please; I don't want anymore comments about how I don't understand that no one is perfect or whatever.  There is a difference between flaws and what we have going on here (and in Perry's mess as well).  These characters are so unlikable and annoying you can't help but despise them.

I would never be friends with anyone in this movie; and I find it very hard to believe that they would remain friends.

The first season is probably the worst of all.  So, I guess it sufficed to say this movie gets off to a rocky start.  The reason for this is Alda.  He has the most annoying character in the film (I label him the Janet Jackson of this episode) for he is always trying to `preach' to everyone else.  Listen, I am all for sharing feelings and really bonding or whatever.  I am one of the most emotionally connected men you will ever meet and I pride myself in my ability to truly connect with my friends, on a deeper more meaningful level.  This guy is way too much though.  His toasts are ridiculous and they feel so forced that you can't take him seriously.  Later in the film, in the fourth season, he tells the group he wants to `get to the heart of things' and I became so frustrated with him I wanted to scream.

WHO TALKS LIKE THAT???

Anyways, the second season is far better.  It is probably the better season for it establishes Nick's new love interest and it gives us an idea of how everyone else feels about it.  Jack (Alda) also keeps his mouth shut with the whole `lets analyze our feelings' bit and so we have a chance to just enjoy the underlying emotions stewing in the pot (or on the boat if you will).

The third season is the most important (especially when in regards to Nick and his ex-wife Anne).  It is also the season that makes the least sense.  There are a few things that happen over the course of this autumn vacation that raise questions.  First is the relationship between the women.  I don't know about you, but from my observation of women, they seem to be much more emotionally connected than men, and they stand up and stick by their friends much more than men do.  So, the very fact that Kate and Claudia have fallen out of touch with Anne to the point where she feels neglected makes no sense to me.  In all honesty, if this had been real life you can place money on the fact that Anne would be the one vacationing with the group, and not Nick.  I felt that Perry's film handled that aspect of things a little better (there is no way those women would be so civil with Nick so soon after the divorce); in fact I even feel that the way Kelly and Deacon's split on `The King of Queens' was handled more realistically than this was (I can't believe I just did that).  The next issue is the strange feud between Jack and Kate, which made little sense to me.  Maybe it wasn't supposed to make sense.  Maybe it was just to show that women at times can be crazy (no offence) but I just scratched my head thinking `really; all this over a football tackle?'

The fourth and final season is a mixed bag.  They are skiing; they are having fun; Jack is back to his `analyzing' again and it is borderline excruciating; especially when they get out to dinner and Danny gets in on it.  That's the bad, but the final confrontation involving the group and Ginny (Nick's new wife) is actually really effective.  I was moved, slightly, and felt that it was the one note Alda hit perfectly.

So it starts on a sour note, yet ends on a good one.

The acting and character development is as poor as Perry's, maybe worse here.  I hated Jackson's character as much as Alda's, maybe more so; but Alda truly was repulsive here.  Carol Burnett was effective for the most part; but her character Kate was the emptiest of them all.  Danny's character was as bad as Alda; truly obnoxious; so much so that believing these guys would want to be friends with him is beyond me.  The first time he tallied up what I owed him for dinner would have been the last time we spoke; seriously.  Claudia, like Kate, feels empty.  She has a brief moment during the second season where I felt that she was going to really shine, but it was short lived.  In fact, the most likable and engaging of the characters are the two (especially the one) you are supposed to feel distant towards; Nick and Ginny.  Len Cariou plays his character very well and it's understandable why he's liked.  He's fun, outgoing, interesting and he never feels fake.  He is who he is, and he wants to be happy.  Ginny wants to fit in, although that is hard for her.  I also felt that Sandy Dennis, who plays Nick's ex Anne, was superb in her few scenes.  Her final scene with the girls is stellar on all accounts.

So, in the end I feel torn here.  Overall the film is not that good, but in parts it works well.  It had a great concept but its execution was less than effective.  I want this movie to be made right, because I think that if done so it could be brilliant.  Alan Alda, like Tyler Perry, is too concerned with preaching to the rest of us than he is with developing realistic and intriguing characters.  This needs a director and screenwriter who is willing to take a backseat to the stories development; preferably someone who is not insistent in staring in the film.

Oh well, this is just my opinion.",1235692800,5,7095,4.3089123867069485
940189,5,6304910150,"Jack and Kate, Nick and Ann, Danny and Claudia are three couples who, in their words, had shielded themselves from the ""Winds of Divorce"" through their friendship with each other.  They spend countless weekends and vacations with each other and for years they have a perfect relationship........or so they think.  During a spring time weekend trip to celebrate Nick and Ann's 21st wedding anniversary, Nick and Jack are gathering firewood when Nick makes a surprising confession........he's leaving Ann!  Nick cites that Ann is no longer stimulating and exciting.  He declares that he's through with her, her quirky behaviors, and wants to start a new life with a new family.  Jack attempts to get Nick to reconsider his decision but Nick is steadfast.

During their summer vacation, Nick has met a much younger beautiful women.  Enter Ginny who has fallen for the older, wiser, and seasoned Nick.  She is impressed with his job, his life experience, and believes most everything he tells her about himself.  Nick and Ginny are very happy but it leaves Jack and Kate and Danny and Claudia feeling insecure and unsure about their own futures.  The story addresses the other couple but mainly focuses on Jack and Kate.  Kate accuses Jack of being jealous of Nick and Jack is trying to convince her he is not while maintaining a composed exterior.

Alan Alda did a fantastic job of writing and directing this film about middle age couples in the early 1980's.  While I was in my 20's at the time, it addresses the fears that middle aged couples experienced, sudden divorce, younger women interested in older men.  It also addresses the stability that couples also felt.  One very touching scene was when Nick and Jack were gathering fire wood.  Nick and Jack have the following conversation:

Nick:  Are you and Kate happy?

Jack:  Yeah, very.

Nick:  No I mean really happy.

Jack:  Yes but not every minute.  There are times when we drive each other crazy.  Like the way her teeth click when she eats, the way I smell my sweatshirt before I put it on.  Then there are times like the one we're in now.  It comes over us like an unexpected wave.  I can't wait to be with her and when I'm with her my heart beats faster.  I'd expect that from a stranger but not someone I've spent half my life with.  It's wonderful.

940252,4,6304910150,"Twenty-five years since its initial release, this 1981 comedy from Alan Alda, its director, writer and nominal star, still holds up pretty well. In fact, I just saw Norman Jewison's 2001 film, ""Dinner with Friends"", which feels like a partial remake in following the friendships that evolve among married couples hovering around middle age. Using Vivaldi's familiar string concertos as a transitional device, Alda's film concerns itself with three upscale couples who take vacations together every season, consequently we get four vignettes over the course of a year. It's a contrived plot machination with no sense of climax, but it all seems to fit the contours of the story.

Jack is a lawyer who would like nothing more than have group therapy sessions with his friends, while his wife Kate, a magazine editor, is a no-nonsense woman who sometimes gets frustrated with Jack's constant emotional insulation. Danny is a neurotic, penny-pinching dentist married to Claudia, an artist with the hot temper of her Italian roots. Nick is a philandering insurance agent who wants to divorce his wife Anne, a housewife frozen by her self-doubts. It is the dissolution of this last marriage that provides the impetus for the group to examine the state of their relationships with their spouses and friends. The group starts out with a spring fishing trip when Nick confides to Jack about his need for a divorce, followed by a Caribbean summer boat trip when Nick brings his new nubile girlfriend Ginny, a wide-eyed stewardess. The fall has them visiting their kids in college, and a soccer match proves to be a test of wills among the men to prove their virility to Ginny much to the chagrin of the wives. The last piece takes them to a wintry cabin where true feelings are divulged, especially as Ginny exposes the women for their vindictive exclusionary tactics.

The acting is solid. Alda seems to be doing a send-up of his own sensitive male persona as Jack, and a wisely cast Carol Burnett is actually pretty subtle as Kate. These two were such huge TV icons in the 1970's that the impact of their goodwill is almost instant. As the most comic pair, Rita Moreno and Jack Weston provide most of the laughs as they banter and bicker like Fred and Ethel Mertz redux. Broadway actor Len Cariou manages the insolence and liberation of a husband set free, while Sandy Dennis brings a palpable dimension of sadness to the socially ejected Anne. Bess Armstrong plays Ginny with an apt sunniness masking a burning need for acceptance. The story leads to little beyond a funny sight gag and an implication that Ginny will become more integral to the group, but the dialogue is often shrewdly observant and sometimes cannily witty. Alda doesn't quite have Woody Allen's sharp acumen in producing genuine laughs out of the human condition, but the film generates a good time while it lasts.

I remember this one because It was one of the few movies I could get away with watching because it was during a point and time when all the movies that were coming out were rated ""R"", and I'm only 14 at the time. This showed Alda's character as somewhat henpecked as he was trying to be peaceful, and his significant other played by Carol Burnett was itching for a fight trying to get Alda's goat throughout the whole movie. I found this to be rather degrading, and violent especially when Alda finally snaps, and goes off on a tirade at the end which leads me to believe that it was Alda's character having the midlife crisis, and that Burnett's character had a tough time forgiving him, but let's put it this way it seems as though they spent too much time with friends, and not with one another, and it explodes at the end with a tirade of slamming things, breaking things, and a slew of obscenities that made you wonder if the character was getting turned on sexually while saying them, and if this was his way of coming. It shows a brief moment after the storm ends that they may begin to understand one another, but the ending shows that it's business as usual, and therefore it would've been better that Alda's and Burnett's characters never married.

The film's plot centers around three middle-aged couples who enjoy sharing vacations together: Jack Burroughs (Alan Alda), Kate Burroughs (Carol Burnette), Nick Callan (Len Cariou), Anne Callan (Sandy Dennis, 1937-1992), Claudia Zimmer (Rita Moreno) and Danny Zimmer (Jack Weston, 1924-1996). Each vacation occurs about every three months, beginning in the spring, then to the other three seasons; with each accompanied with Vivaldi's seasonal movement of music.  With each vacation, something new is learned about the various couples.  In the spring at a secluded lake, Nick reveals to Jack his desire to divorce Anne.  In the summer while vacationing on a sailboat in the Caribbean, Nick is no longer with Anne; instead he brings a young girlfriend named Ginny Newley (Bess Armstrong). With Nick constantly giving Ginny presents and keeping the other two couples up at night with their noisy activities, Jack & Danny find it difficult to keep their eyes off of Ginny to the consternation of Kate and Claudia.  With autumn, the three couples visit some of their college-aged children, Lisa (Elizabeth Alda) and Beth (Beatrice Alda), at a Connecticut university and get the unexpected visit from Anne. When Jack expresses his jealousy towards Nick while playing soccer, Kate expresses her unhappiness with his obessesion over Ginny as well as her tiring of being responsible for setting up the couples' vacations.  Lastly, in the winter, the three couples go on a ski trip.  There, the ongoing rivalry between Nick and Jack results in the two them being injured while trying to show off with inappropriate tricks on cross-country skis: Nick with a broken ankle and Jack with a torn tendon.  Following Danny expressing his fears of death, Ginny expresses her discontent with being the outsider and goes for a walk alone in the snow.  With Nick & Jack impaired, Danny decides to go and look for her; but he ends up falling through some thin ice.  It's then up to the other five to rescue the hypochondriac Danny, but it may cost him his most prized possession: his new Mercedes.

It stands the test of time, because the truths (funny and unfunny!) about marriage and about friendships between couples still stand up. I often think of it. One of my favorite lines of all time is in this movie, when Carol Burnett accuses husband Alan Alda of always overanalyzing everything, and he says, ""Yeah, but do you know WHY I always overanalyze everything?"" And Rita Moreno looking wistfully at their divorced friend with the adoring hot lover and saying, ""I wanna be like them."" It's a sweet and real movie.

Two from the cast,Sandy Dennis and Jack Weston, are no longer with us, but their comedy talent lives forever in this romp of three couples and their vacations together.

  Len Cariou shines and the selfish and emotionally inept Nick. Jack Weston as the hypocondriacal dentist and Rita Moreno as his grounded artist wife are hilarious! Bess Armstrong as beautiful and naive Ginny shines.

  I loved Carol Burnett and Alan Alda as the more sane couple in this comedy. How fortunate I have been when this came out in DVD.

  My biggest regret is that this didn't have a second disc and wasn't a special edition with surviving cast member interviews and interviews from back then.

  Take the time and buy this, as well as Alan Alda's other great  comedy Same Time Next Year. I am even considering getting Sweet Liberty. The side-splitting role that Michael Caine played makes the whole move worth it as well.",1121126400,2,1055,4.572192513368984

The cast is top notch, as is the script. One couple is on the verge of falling apart and will crumble before the season ends, which follows the group as they continue their habt of vacationing together as a group, albeit with great change - and the emotionsl upheaval that always brings. At times, you wonder - why are these people friends ? But, under it all, you can see love for one another...love and exasperation, almost any emotion close bonds will cause to erupt or simmer. Because this could be any couple, within any group of friends, the story is not dated.

940276,4,6304910150,"The aspect ratio is fake.

The top and bottom of the regular full screen version has been cropped out of the picture to give the illusion your getting a widescreen - what your getting is less picture!

The studios should label the DVD's as they did when they cropped VHS video picture "" this film has been modified to fit you tv screen"" as in modified to fit a 16x9 tv in this case.

You have already lost one third of the picture when it was modified to full screen, now you loose an additional one third to one fourth of the movies image!

The reason leterbox and widescreen has a demand, is that the audience or consumer wants to view the Movie as it was filmed and framed by the filmaker, and not loose out on portions of the movie that the director intended.

In other words the idea to release in widescreen was for the intention of showing MORE not LESS of the movies image.

The studios believe they can get away with this, since the average buyer does not have a full screen video version to compare with, or the consumer is just unaware.

I compared this DVD to a full screen VHS version, and in many cases where some DVD's come with both Full & Wide Screen on a flip disc, compare them before watching, many of the widesreen sides are just chopped versions of the full screen.

The picture quality is great on this and most DVD's, it is unfortunate though that it has to be a conciliation for cropped picture.",1119484800,31,1420,4.31203007518797
940277,5,6304910150,"This is one of my favorite movies about relationships. Alan Alda has written a brilliant comedy that shows how essentially healthy adults respond to problems and conflicts-- with humor, intelligence, honesty and compassion. And yeah, mistakes too.

These characters are fully realized as individuals and as they relate as couples. They each have their own quirks that show a different way to handle emotions. When Len Cariou decides to get a new wife, Sandy Dennis decides to get a snake...Carol Burnett wears her feelings proudly while Alan Alda tries to hold on to his until he pops... Rita Moreno remains passionate ""because I'm Italian"" and Jack Weston is simply hilarious as he tries to cope with his fears about death and underwear....

Through the movement of the seasons, each couple is required to face something in themselves and learn from it. A good life is not about living happily ever after, it's about managing all that life throws at you with skill and good friends..

I would enjoy going on vacation with these people-- it would never be boring!!

Why do they butcher a great film like this? Pan and Scan means we don't get all of the picture, but it also means that the close-ups are always too close-up--the face fills the screen. This is the same perverted treatment originally given to ""Chariots of Fire,"" until Warner Brothers finally heard the public outcry and reissued it. I'd certainly be willing to pay more for a film of this quality if UMVD would transfer to DVD all the quality that's there.

940281,5,6304910150,"Alan Alda (best known as the wisecracking Hawkeye from the long-running TV series M*A*S*H*) wrote and directed this brilliant film which, for me, is the perfect homage to the successful marriage.

The story centers around the close friendships of three middle-aged couples who always take their vacations together. A huge problem arises when one of the husbands (played with gusto by Len Cariou) abruptly sheds his longtime, devoted and quirky wife (played by the brilliantly gifted late actress Sandy Dennis) for a much younger and pretty woman (portrayed by Bess Armstrong.) Dennis suddenly becomes the odd-woman out of the group while Armstrong takes her place in the traditional group vacation.

Everyone feels the effects of the switch, and their reactions and adjustments (or lack thereof) to the situation create the movie's tension and raise universal questions about love, commitment, marriage, honesty and aging.

Alda's wife in the film, played by the legendary Carol Burnett, struggles to make sense out of what happened, and worries that all aging women (including her) may be cast aside without remorse by their husbands stuggling with the mid-life blues who want younger, sexier partners. In one revealing portion of the story, Alda joins in a soccer game ""with the boys"" and plays to the point of exhaustion and even injury to impress Armstrong. Burnett withholds her sympathy for her wounded mate and is furious instead, forcing him to realize what he was doing through witty, poignant and hysterical dialog.

Multi-talented Rita Moreno and Jack Weston are the third couple also caught in the tortured but humorous and telling web of self analysis and doubt.

Armstrong feels the tension from a completely different perspective, having fallen in love with a man who refuses to vacation alone and whose closest female friends refuse to accept her as part of the group but resent and mistrust her instead.

The humor, and it is a very funny film, comes from the honesty the situation forces on the participants for them to be able to survive the vacation with their relationships and/or marriages intact.

Ultimately, the younger woman is accepted on her own terms and the other couples understand more fully their love and dedication to their mates, while embracing true friendships with everyone in the group.

Vivaldi's classic Four Seasons is the perfect soundtrack for the film and the inspiration for its title.

I strongly urge anyone in a relationship, whether new or of long-duration, to see this film. It is very rare, indeed, when any studio produces a coming of age film FOR ADULTS that has humor, heart, respect for the middled-aged and absolutely NO teen angst!

As was apparently the case with Sweet Liberty, so too is the case with this ALAN ALDA classic - released only in pan/scan - which, IMO, it might as well not be release at all on DVD.  I will not and do not purchase any film on DVD that has been altered (i.e., parts of the film cut out of the DVD release) even when it is just parts of the sides of the picture cut to fit it onto the eventually-to-become-obsolete 3x4 TV screens.

While we should all rejoice in the fact that it is to be released at all (it wasn't looking good there for a while!) we should also scoff at what a flimsy release this is going to be. A commentary by Alda would have been great; an ANAMORPHIC WIDESCREEN TRANSFER would have been better! This is going to be another lame ""pan and scan"" job with no extras, and that is sad. This is a fantastic film about adult relationships with excellent performances around the table. I love this movie and I will buy the DVD the day it comes out, but a decent issue of this classic film would have made the buy all the more sweeter. The good side is at least the cost reflects the package. And now, I present some irrelevance: ""Look, you can't lay all that on my shoulders. Don't you know how much this place stinks? Don't you know what it's like to stand day after day in blood? In the blood of children? I hate this place. And if I can't stand up to it to your satisfaction, then... then the hell with it. How dare you? The hell with your Iowa naivete, and the hell with your hero worship and your teddy bear, and while you're at it, the hell with you! Why don't you grow up for crying out loud?

940327,5,6304910150,"My boyfriend of five years asked me this question last year, uncertain of where to take our relationship and desperately afraid of boring me to tears.  I was determined to show him this film, which I last saw in the theater at the time of its release.
Three middle-aged couples with children meet once a season every year to do a group activity.  Although they get together in smaller groups at other points, the ritual of celebrating each season is pretty much an unquestioned tradition ... until one of the couples split up.
Can the group survive?  How about the individual friendships?  The introduction of a new spouce, the question of what to do with the previous one, and simply the planning to come up with ideas of how to keep the group activities from getting stale are as valuable as the effort the stars put into their performances.
This movie values effort without drudgery, the complexities of communication within a chosen family, and how daunting it is to try to play catch-up with a group that's been around nearly forever.  These characters drive each other crazy occasionally but always love each other, and try to stay together even when their world is falling apart.

My reasons for 4.5 stars are two. In the fall and winter segments, I could periodically see the shadow of the photographer. It distracted a bit. However, it did answer my curiosity as to how the walks through actual nature paths were filmed. The other issue is maybe particular to me. I expected the winter scene to have maybe five or so inches of snow on the ground. But it looked more like a dusting. I wanted to see just snow and the path, but not the leaves and other aspects of the ground mingled with the dusting of snow.
Other than these minor issues, I love this DVD. It helps me imagine that my trek on the treadmill is actually in a woodland forest. Now all I need is the feel of the breeze and the scents of the forest.",1526256000,,893,4.1976744186046515
