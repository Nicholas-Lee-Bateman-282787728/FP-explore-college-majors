3661265,1,B001JXPBRE,"I was looking for a Tai Chi routine I could do everyday but this dvd is way too long.  He explains each move over and over in their own segments. Instead of being a nice concise 40 minute workout it takes hours to watch the dvd and learn each section poses.  There is no real choice of different Tai Chi routine options with different time lengths.  I was very disappointed with this dvd and it is not at all what I was hoping it would be.  The reviews are rather misleading, and so is the description.",1323043200,50,502,4.197916666666667
3661266,4,B001JXPBRE,This video is very easy to follow -- almost too slow and repetitive--but can always be fast forwarded.  Probably one of the best that's out there.,1321488000,9,146,4.615384615384615
3661267,5,B001JXPBRE,"Chris Pei presents hours of instruction on the 24 part form of Tai Chi.  The final workout itself is about 15 minutes straight through, but he breaks everything down in a series of 8 lessons.

The lessons range from 20 to 30 minutes or so and he teaches you a few of the parts.

First he is presents the material, then reviews it and points out things to note, then continues on increasing the speed/smoothness of the parts.

The video also makes sure to show all angles as you work through the moves so you can really see what is going on.

I have used it for a few weeks now and really enjoying how I feel doing this.",1320624000,101,619,4.168067226890757
3661268,5,B001JXPBRE,"Chris Pei reminds me of my first Tai Chi teacher in San Francisco about twenty years ago.  The class was offered at a junior high school gym and it was packed with people.  He is the first person who helped me feel the Qi and I will never forget it!

It's been a while now since I practiced Tai Chi and this is a great video to get me back in.  Very practical and affordable.  Thank you, laoshi!",1318204800,24,395,4.012820512820513
3661269,5,B001JXPBRE,"I have tried other beginner tai chi DVD's, most costing much more than this one, but this is easily the best to learn true Yang short form (24 moves) tai chi. I am buying his companion DVD on Qi Gong today.

Pros:
- camera angles change throughout each lesson to clearly show important details from front, sides, and rear
- in each of the 8 lessons, 3 moves are taught slowly and repeatedly without rushing
- instructor points out minor but important details, and also the things that beginners often do wrong
- good video and sound quality - the instructor is easily heard over the soft music
- includes a separate warmup routine, and shows all 24 moves from beginning to end so you can do it with him after learning them all
- simple menu navigation
- optional subtitles

Cons:
- like on any tai chi DVD, at times you will need to deal with the ""mirror image problem"", but the changing camera angles minimize this.
- some people will be frustrated by the slow-paced lessons, but this is necessary to learn the proper details of the moves",1318204800,"1,060",1039,4.463157894736842

3661271,5,B001JXPBRE,"I've enjoyed this DVD a good deal so far (been at it for a week or so)

Mr. Pei does a very good job breaking down each pose slowly and methodically. There are 8 different sections, each one describing 1 or 2 poses, with the last session combining all of them into a singular routine.

I've been looking for something slightly less rigorous to work on- to focus more on balance, tensile strength and breathing. I was very surprised when my core and back were a little bit sore after day 2 of Tai Chi, so there is a very subtle workout, even for someone in decent shape used to strenuous workouts.

It's very enjoyable and relaxing, I highly recommend this.",1315353600,447,962,5.808510638297872

3661349,3,B001JXPBRE,"It's opposite, his right is your left - fatal flaw.  Obviously, as you get deep in the movement this gets more confusing.  In my experience, Tia Chi teachers turn their back so you are aligned right and left and you see their hand movements in a mirror, or they stand along side you.  If you follow the video you have to stop periodically and evaluate if your right is his left, or his left is mirroring your right, is he stepping toward the right or left, or whatever.  It's sort of a crazy disconnect.  I really don't see the excuse for this, this is basic production sense; you don't want to have your student constantly expected to reverse your moves or ignore the visual entirely.",1519516800,,685,4.448

I am absolutely a beginner, and although part of the video was interesting, I felt like going over each position three times very slowly, was too frustrating. Although the gentleman who made the DVD, is easy to understand, going as slow as he did, made me feel like I was wasting more time than I had, and it made my patients grow very thin. I ended up passing this particular DVD onto my mom, so that she had an opportunity to try it as well, she has not gotten back to me yet.

I'm at a computer all day for work, and, as he points out, the warm up is very good for getting rid of the stiffness. However, I am directionally challenged and it is hard to follow him when he doesn't mirror you. I just try to do that myself, but sometimes it's hard to use your right when he says left. And each pose is slow, as others have said. I fast forward a bit to where he does it more fluidly, otherwise I'd be asleep. That's the issue I've had with some classes, except you can't fast forward a class!  When he does the whole thing together at the end, he explains as he goes, so even if you haven't mastered all the poses, you can follow. All in all, I'm not sorry I purchased this DVD, he's very clear and precise, but it's not my favorite.",1506124800,6,819,4.024539877300613

I would like to have it where you could, after learning the postures, just have a section where you could flow from one posture to the next without stopping for instruction or having to do the pose 3-4 times on each side. If you're someone who has a couple of hours to go through the whole routine, then it's a good way to learn, not a good way to practice. I say this realizing the point is to go slow, but not so slow you're going backwards.

Tai Chi is difficult and for me, progress is painfully slow....I've taken classes before and found this to be true even with a teacher present.

3661443,5,B001JXPBRE,"Quite possibly the best DVD I've ever seen on the subject of the 24 movement Yang Style Tai Chi Chuan.
Chris Pei is a calm and patient instructor, the location adds to the relaxing aspect of what can be a tedious subject.
If you're new to Tai Chi Chuan, this is the DVD for you.
If you've got a few years (or decades) under your belt, it's a nice trip back to the basics.

3661462,5,B001JXPBRE,"I am just learning Tai Chi, and this is the first video I bought after browsing through a decent selection.
Why did I decide to choose this one? from previous buyer's comments. most of the other dvds had complaints that the instructor was boring, hard to understand, or talked too long. Chris does a good job of explaining the technique, walking you through it, explaining common ways that the exercises are done wrong, and showing how to do the exercise in reverse (if shown how to do a technique starting with the right hand, he will then show how to do same starting with the left).
I also bought this dvd because of the way that the program was described. I learn best when I am given instruction and shown how to apply it. the repetitive motions of the practice that Chris walks you through makes sure that you are doing the exercises correctly before moving on.
I am glad that I chose this dvd and am planning on continuing with the series for the time being.

Tai Chi Lessons Gone Digital
I bought this DVD because Im really interested in the health benefits touted by tai chi practitioners. I have always wanted to take a class or join a group, but Im kind of shy. I also worry about looking clumsy and foolish. I guess Im afraid of failing, which is pretty dumb. I guess I have always been this way. Thats why I prefer to just exercise at home. Basically, I rely on my fitness DVDs and the little home gym that Im slowly building. For the past year, Ive spent most of my time on HIIT workouts demonstrated in my The Biggest Loser and Jillian Michaels DVDs. However, I felt there was something missing from my workout routines. I was doing crunches, planks and burpees, but nothing was helping me to find my center or inner balance. But then one day, I came across this relaxing program playing at my physical therapists office. It was called, Tai Chi for Beginners. Thanks to the typical 30-minute wait in the waiting room, I was able to watch an entire 30-minute lesson. (There are eight lessons on the disc.) The tai chi masters name was Chris Pei and his voice had a calming effect. He was graceful and his explanations were easy to understand. Right then, a switch went off in my head. So I asked my physical therapist about the DVD and she said that Tai Chi was instrumental in helping her to lower her blood pressure. She believed in it so much that she wanted to share it with her patients. I purchased the DVD as soon as I went home.

The Bottom Line
I like this DVD because of Chris Peis easy to follow instructions. I am surprised at how much content he packs into this disc. There are eight lessons, which equates to 3.5 hours of instruction. Another thing that I appreciate is how Pei gives modifications for people who lack flexibility such as my parents. Ive been trying to get my parents into tai chi, so having these modifications is valuable to me. These lessons are great for people who zero tai chi experience. I really feel that Im learning from a master who genuinely who genuinely wants to impart his knowledge to others. The production value of the DVD is not super high, but it doesnt need to be. Ive wasted good money on tai chi DVDs by GAIAM that were too difficult to follow along with.",1488067200,11,2450,4.762352941176471

3661545,3,B001JXPBRE,"This video goes through the movements very slowly, which is good, and the instructor's voice is very calming. The warm-up exercises and forms are very well explained. However, the video is very hard to use for practice because the moves are not labeled well on screen. Mr. Pei is very conscientious about repeating a step several timesgreat if you already have the moves and transitions internalized. But if you are trying to learn the motions for the first time, and you want to repeat a portion to study a fine point, it is hit or miss how far to back up. This makes practice very jerky, the opposite of the smoothness inherent in good Tai Chi. In a few places, the narrators voice is out of synch with the movement, so the voice will say ""palms up"" when the screen image shows palms are down, though this is very minor.

 I would give this video 5 stars if it had more detailed navigation to facilitate the close attention to internalize Tai Chi's finesse points.",1484265600,13,966,4.545977011494253

I didn't give the DVD 5 stars because sometimes the spoken directions are different from the movement shown at that moment.  If the audio instruction is off by only 5 seconds from the video, it's enough to confuse me.

3661650,5,B001JXPBRE,"So Tai Chi is an ancient Chinese martial art, and is not to be confused with Chai Tea, which isn't. if you try to do Tai Chi while drinking Chai Tea then it can get very messy indeed. Especially if it's in a Chai Tea shop. I found out the hard way. It ended in a caffeinated bloodbath of epic proportions. (The horror, the horror). So just to clarify: Tai Chi and Chai Tea are two very different things that should never be combined or discussed in polite company.  Even in unpolite company I'd watch what I said about them.  Actually, should It be 'unpolite' or 'impolite'? I'm a grammar genius, but I think to work that one out would be unpossible. Right, where was I? Oh, yeah, Chai Tea. Chai Tea is made by brewing black tea with a mixture of Indian herbs and spices and... wait a minute... hang on... No, I should be talking about Tai Chi, not Chai Tea. See how easy it is to get them mixed up.

So this DVD with Tai Chi Master, Chris Pei, will helps you works on the moves to improves your balances and fitnesses. After learning the moves your sense of balance will be so good that you'll be able to dance across a 100 yard long grease covered high wire while spinning ten plates simultaneously, one on each finger, and composing a poem, with a pen in your mouth, about the scales of justice. You may also be able to ride a bike, in the street, without training wheels, but that's probably for the more advanced students. So, if you want to get fit and improve your balance, while learning a martial art then this is for you. If, on the other hand, you want to drink hot Indian beverages, then it's not.",1466208000,6,1609,4.268852459016394

He goes back over each individual move numerous times and explains step by step what you do with your hands, arms, feet, legs, body. If you can't learn from this DVD you should probably get a real live instructor to teach you. I also like that you have the option of watching the mirror image or actual image of the moves.

The instructor should be facing away so we can mimic the movements instead of trying to figure out which direction we should execute.

If he demonstrated the moves in the same direction as we are standing, he would only have to repeat 3 times.",1453248000,5,439,4.4625

If Master Pei can't lower your blood pressure your spring is wound way too tight.
Doing the exercises is a pleasure and a challenge. No worries. You WILL be awake when moving as demonstrated (not easy) and there are enough rudiments taught to keep me busy for awhile. Good quality sound, natural setting, and easy logical instruction. Very cool. Just what I wanted.

The lessons are generally steadily-paced and provide great, step-by-step detail about how to execute the forms.

I had never done Tai Chi and am in great shape, but I was surprised on how deceptively taxing this form of exercise is.  I was genuinely fatigued afterward.  The one slight struggle I had is getting used to Chris Pei's mispronunciation of several English words.  It was only about the third time I went thru the exercise that I could understand him clearly.  At the same time, though, if I had to do a DVD speaking a second language, I am sure the Chinese would have a hard time understanding me.

When you practice meditational practices like Tai Chi, Yoga, or Qi Gong try incorporating the Saam Meditation Technique into your procedure. This is a meditation based upon a 500 year old Korean Acupuncture Technique. Instead of only focusing on the chakras or third eye, Saam Meditation technique brings one's Qi and attention to acupuncture points on the hands and feet. In doing so we can specifically target each of the twelve primary organs like the heart, liver, lungs, stomach, kidneys, etc. Meditation upon the hands and feet strongly stimulates the brain and intensifies the sensation and healing effects of Qi across the whole body. Saam Medical Meditation has pictures of the four point acupuncture combinations for each of the organs. Each point of the meditation is easy to locate.

I got the video running and was looking through the main menu, started the section called warm ups and turned around and mom was behind me following along.

I saw other reviewers stating they wished the instructor was faster with instructions. To me, the reason the instructor takes his time is so positions can be learned properly.

Just fast forward to where I want to be once I've gotten proficient enough to continue on to the next part of a movement.  Saw many poor ratings that really sounded like people who are in a big hurry.  When using your body in a martial art style you do not want to hurry.  Husband and 3 sons took Kenpo karate.  It took many hours/years of practicing at home to learn their forms.  Take your time, spare your muscles injury by doing it slowly to achieve that nice fluidity.",1419724800,2,563,4.375

3661909,5,B001JXPBRE,"At first I thought the lessons were very slow and apathetic, but after a few times through, I can really appreciate the pace and it turns out now I see Master Pei as very calm and have come to admire him.  I'm only on the second routine, but the first one (Parting Wild Horse's Mane) I can do almost effortlessly and its a real pleasure to do motions that are natural to the human body and feel beautiful and graceful.  In moving slowly, balance becomes paramount so my overall balance is better now too.  I have to go through each routine with the DVD about 5 times to get all the details and practice a bit without the DVD to make it truly mine.
On some mornings, when pressed for time, I only do the warm-up routine which is a great way to start the day as it addresses the body from head to foot and makes you breath and stretch.  I found I could  also do the warm-up sitting on a ball or a chair when I got surgery.
Tai Chi is also great because it doesn't need any special equipment or clothing, you can do it virtually anywhere, any time.
Tai Chi is great for relaxing and focusing.  It's a real pleasure.
On some instances when I was learning the routine, my hip would hurt and then I would look and see where my weight is not transferred correctly or I'm trying to turn too much, etc. and was able to correct it.
With the emphasis on relaxing the shoulders the core is holding me instead of my shoulders which feels a lot better.
I'm hooked!",1417996800,7,1450,4.197841726618705

3661915,5,B001JXPBRE,"Many years ago I purchased a VHS tape featuring the Tai Chi 24 'frame' Yang Short Form, and I really enjoyed watching it and following along. Unfortunately, the 21st century came along and tape players all seemed to simultaneously give up the ghost. So here is this tape--now a paperweight--and it got me thinking to look for some modern day equivalent. I ran across a couple of great videos of Master Pei on Youtube, and really liked his style and manner of teaching. Long story...um...long--I just received and watched this (4 HOUR) DVD for the first time, and it is all I'd hoped. It incorporates the same style and form as my previous tape, and is actually much more detailed. Chris is a great teacher, and I can highly recommend this DVD.",1417392000,,743,4.636363636363637

The only real difficulty is on complex moves he is facing you so you are getting a mirror of what he wants you to do.  But he does explain the moves to listening is often better than watching his move.  Yes, he does make some errors in his English but they are very minor (often adding an ""s"" to words that should be singular) but this is very, very minor and his voice is well modulated and the background sounds are soothing.

3661973,5,B001JXPBRE,"The DVD is split into several sections.  The only ones I bother with are the warm up and the tai chi lessons.  The warm up is amazing, I usually feel much better before even getting to the tai chi.  The tai chi lesson is split into sections, each section teaching you a different set of movements that will become part of the final routine.  each section is about 30 minutes long, and includes the movements, and the most common mistakes to avoid so that you get the health benefits rather than more problems.  The final lesson combines all the other lessons into a single movement.  He still tells you what to move and how to move it, but he doesn't tell you what to avoid.  This is kind of fast paced compared to the rest, but the entire final routine is compacted to fit into about 11 minutes.  Perfect for someone who wants to do this before work each morning.  He does mention that you should always do the warm up first, so your total time is about 26 minutes between the two.",1403395200,,982,4.3224043715847

That said, there were some moves that I had learned in flowing sequences from other DVDs, and this was a pretty good source for refining technique, once the basic moves were learned. I was very frustrated in the end, and rarely was able to finish a segment without some degree of negative feeling.

This video is very easy to follow and you can progress at your own pace. For the first three weeks I just did the warm up and the first two series of movements until I felt comfortable with them. I have moved to the next movements, but could easily just do what I know now and feel fulfilled. I am slowly but surely getting my head into the practice of Tai Chi as well; meaning to meditate at the same time.

I bought this DVD because of the low price - I didn't want to spend a lot of money if I was just experimenting - but I've been very pleased with it. The instructions are clear and easy to follow, with lots of repetition to help you master the different movements and forms. Once you start to get the hang of it, the slowness and the repetitions get a little frustrating, but it's easy to skip those chapters on the disc and move ahead to the final segment.

He explains the moves very carefully and slowly, demonstrating over and over so that you get it. Each move is a separate lesson culminating in a final segment where the viewer gets to do all the moves together. The only problem with the DVD is that each move is a long lesson. And there is no review....so once you move to the next move....you can't do a quick review of the movements you've already learned.

Those who say that you cannot learn Tai Chi from a tape have a point, because it is much better studying under a master.  But sometimes you don't have the time, access or money to buy lessons, and then learning from a tape is your best alternative.  It takes longer and is more work, but it can be done.

This is the best instructional tape for beginners I have seen.  Christopher Pei is totally focused on your learning the intricate moves of the 24 step Yang style, repeating each part of the moves enough to build up knowledge of each step.  He tells you what the common mistakes are so that you can coach yourself.  The warm up  is  so unusual and very effective that my wife now performs it every morning before work.  She says it gives her  energy and releases the tension in her neck and back that lasts the day. The stretch by itself is reason to buy the tape, and the rest is a good way for a beginner to study and benefit from Tai Chi.  This tape is well worth the money.",1388016000,9,1039,4.165829145728643

Chris Pei is indeed a master, and his voice coupled with your background music makes for a focused session. As an old karate student (like fifty years ago!), I understand the wisdom of thoughtful elementary instructions.

For anyone who wants to experience Tai Chi on a beginner level....this will work for you.",1384560000,3,458,4.329411764705882
3662039,5,B001JXPBRE,"One of the very best, 'how to' videos I have seen.

The instructor is incredibly precise and goes through each step again and again demonstrating and correcting the usual mistakes a learner will make.

If one wants to do Tai Chi, and can't find a good instructor, this is the video that will help.

If you have an instructor and find classes rushed and want to know precisely when to move or where to move your hands and feet, this is the video to use.

This video is authentic in that it is not part of some new age nonsense you would never find back in the old country!

Buy it if you want to do Tai Chi.",1384387200,2,606,4.101694915254237

3662041,4,B001JXPBRE,"Tai Chi is hard, I don't care who you are...but this video breaks down the movements and makes it easy to learn/follow.  It's a bit repetitive once you get the hang of it, however.  I myself find that I'm bored with this type of exercise so I may give this away.

I have finally made it through all the parts and tried the final part yesterday where all movements are put together.  From the beginning, I have noticed an improvement in my balance, next I noticed that I wanted to sit up straighter and my back was feeling stronger.  After a time I noticed I feel more energetic and don't feel the need to nap in the afternoon.  I love what practicing with this dvd has done for my body.  I would give this dvd 5 stars if the demonstrations were done in mirror image so I could follow the actions more easily.",1384300800,2,633,4.198347107438017

3662081,5,B001JXPBRE,"I had been interested in learning Tai Chi, and from the moment I put this on, I knew I made the proper choice.

Before even going into the specifics of learning the form, there is introductory lessons about things that apply in general to tai chi, including may tips about how and when to breathe and proper form, such as positioning of the knees.

The lessons themselves are broken down into lessons where 3 or 4 movements are shown, and at the end of the lesson all the moves are done at actual speed, so you can go straight there when you feel like you just want to work on the moves.  Once you are done with the lessons, the entire form is done in full form.

The repetitions of moves seem slow paced, but after learning initially am able to easily skip to the putting moves together section.

In this he brings his same ability to teach.  Showing the movements slowly,  pointing out errors and then showing the moves at speed.  Being able to follow along like that made it easy to follow.

Camera angles this way and that; lefts and rights getting constantly reversed.  I frequently found myself with my back to the screen and had to crane my neck to follow.  I tried to use landmarks to stay oriented: like where he was in relation to the tree behind him.  Next shot he was in front of a lake and there was no tree.  Very frustrating.

3662134,4,B001JXPBRE,"I was very impressed with ""Tai Chi for Beginners"" featuring Chris Pei.

The 4 star rating above is based on only one sector of the CD: Warm Ups. That one part was so helpful that I have incorporated the moves (or most of them) into my daily stretching routine. They can also be used as warm up moves at the gym! More power to Mr. Pei.

That leads to the one drawback to this product: It moved too slowly for this impatient reviewer-but that is not the fault of the instructor. (A scan of other comments also mentioned Mr. Pei's leisurely pacing).  Just because I can't calm myself down to sit through the whole tape is no cause for subtracting stars from a review.

3662141,5,B001JXPBRE,"When I was looking for Tai Chi videos I read about the instructors, and Chris Pei is highly regarded in the Tai Chi and martial art community. So I purchased his title, and he indeed is a great instructor.

His approach to teaching Tai Chi makes it easy to follow with a building block approach.  There is a nice warm up section that can be done anytime.  It is about 10 minutes, and I have been using it often.

Then the Tai Chi itself if broken down in a series of lessons.  He works through the moves at a slower pace so to focus on the movements carefully.  This also includes tips and cautions of mistakes.  The movements are shown at various angles to see them.  The pace is then increased in speed.  These are done in a series of three to four movements in each lesson.  At the end of the lesson, all the moves are put together in the full speed.  The lessons also have chapter markers to move through them.  So once you have the first movement down in a lesson, you can go to the full particular movement, jump to the next movement, or just work on all the moves together in a lesson.

This all leads up to the full Tai Chi form which is done with all the moves and the speed Tai Chi is done.

If you want to learn Tai Chi properly, this DVD is definately worth it.",1367193600,7,1273,4.121951219512195
3662142,4,B001JXPBRE,"This is a good DVD for beginners. But the demonstrations can be painfully slow sometimes. It's nice that the forms are shown at different angles that make them easy to follow along.

3662144,5,B001JXPBRE,"I have never practiced, watched, nor attempted Tai Chi in my life before. I am horribly out of shape, which is why I'm trying to fix it. To be honest I was afraid I would not be able to do the moves at first. But the instructor very carefully and slowly showed several times from different angles how to move and where to put your foot, your arm, etc that I found myself actually able to keep up and understand. I am the epitome of beginner here so if I can understand this, I think anybody could. :)
I am amazed. With just one runthrough of the warmup I felt my body respond. It was AWESOME! I'm so far out of shape  that I can't do each movement for very long but I can do them. It took me a few tries to get some of the movements down correctly but I was able to do them. Even the whole...erm squatting lower thing (sorry new to this) I could do, I just can't do it well.
I would most definitely recommend this to the beginner. I think more advanced people might find it too slow perhaps, but as this is for beginners I think he nailed it spot on. It is very low impact (believe me, I've hurt myself enough times trying to work out in other formats I know!) and no matter how out of shape you are, you can do these movements. I am excited to get back home and do the next round. The stiffness in my body is going away, which is amazing.
One of the things I appreciate most (and maybe this is normal, this is the first exercize video I've ever bought) is that the DVD is partisioned into the warmup and different levels of exercizes. I can go at my own pace and redo the movement until I understand how to move properly.
This might not be for everyone, but if the beginner like me is looking to figure out how to do Tai Chi, I so very definitely recommend this. I cannot say that enough. Once I build up my endurance and need to expand my knowledge I will buy further DVDs from Master Pei's teachings. I am as newbie to this as they come and Master Pai is very patient in the video, going slow so beginners can keep up, understand, and learn. Thank you.",1366243200,7,2055,4.086633663366337

3662195,5,B001JXPBRE,"This seems to fill a big gap in the market. It's the best Tai Chi instructional DVD I've seen, and it's nice that it's based on the standard Beijing 24 form: probably the best place for a student to start.

Pei's evidently got some background in Chinese Medicine but the instructional method here is thoroughly western-mechanical. And that's crucial. Overall, the instructional standard here is about the level of a Kathy Smith production, which I consider the apex in the fitness video market. To finally see it in a martial arts video is so refreshing.

Basic geometric principles are explained at the outset. Every frame is described in terms of weight distribution, orientation, arm placement etc. at a rate of six or more points per move. And interspersed through these instructions are many key warnings and general reminders pertinent to the current posture. This is important stuff. I spent three years practicing Tai Chi before figuring out by painful trial an error that the foot needs to be oriented with the knee. Pei isn't two minutes into the introduction before explaining this, with the camera following to illustrate.

Some DVDs tout multiple angles--- either on separate tracks or in windows for simultaneous play. That style of presentation is often less helpful that it might seem, however, and thankfully it's not the approach they've taken here. Instead, the camera angles track the instructional focus. So a frame can start from one angle and then switch through three or four others before it's complete, following the instructions that are being given by Pei. This must be a lot more work for the producers, (imagine the additional filming cost of three or four cameras, then the extra costs in editing and post-production), but the advantages are tremendous. The other production style demands a lot of extra work from the student; this doesn't. I've spent hours watching online video footage for angles on a frame that are given here ""for free"" by the skill of the production crew (along with Pei's seasoned consultation I'm sure).

Also, kudos to Bodywisdom for making this video very affordable, too. At their price, I don't think there's a Tai Chi student on the continent that shouldn't have a copy in their DVD collection.",1359504000,7,2254,5.002666666666666

The posture is key so you don't pull sometime or make an existing ache or pain more so. The movement of each element looks easy when you see someone else do them - but I have found that moving from right to  left is more difficult than it appears. I for one have to work hard to do anything in a series of tasks that is left led. Normal exercises - yes, but not a sequence of moments. (For you lefties -is the opposite true for you?). Chris Pei goes through all 8 sequences 3 - 4 times explaining placement and form by the 3rd or 4th time you are comfortable and confident. Once you are ready you can skip the segments and go directly to the full sequence of Tai Chi. On the DVD you just pick the place you want and go. I very much appreciate his warm ups  -I always start w/ them and I am still learning the 8 sequences. When I am ready for a more  advance program I will move on to the full sequence. I took a Tai Chi class a few years back and did not get nearly as much out of it as I have from this single source. He has other DVDs ( I got his Qi Gong - starting that next month),

Pei will explain all of this. he teaches through repetition. which i love. that way we can be sure that we are learning. just like in a classroom. the setting of the video is very nice, the wind is a little loud in the mic at first, but clears up. he speaks softly so turn up the volume. be sure to watch every chapter from beginning to end and you will have a better understanding of what you are doing. the warm up routine is a blast!",1353283200,8,874,4.303030303030303

This video teaches the short yang form of Tai Chi.  It is broken into eight 15 to 30 minute lessons, each with the repetition needed to learn the moves.

The warm up is excellent - worth starting out in the morning each day to get your body going. I now use this warm up before any of my other work out routines. The Tai Chi moves themselves are explained verbally while being demonstrated in a controlled progression to allow the viewer to follow and replicate the moves and then in the demonstration section the moves are repeated as they are learned to reinforce the mechanical aspect of the moves and then progress into Tai Chi aspects. For individuals new to Tai Chi this is a very good beginning. All the basics can be learned using good form and fundamental movements before later progressing to more advanced Tai Chi.

I bought this and Chao Pang's ""Tai-Chi: Stillness Through Motion.""  That disc is a lot more in-depth.  In purchasing Tai Chi for Beginners, I wanted to counterbalance that with something simpler.
This disc definitely is simpler.  The instruction is very ""left foot here, right arm there"" which I kinda like.  The problem for me though is that the instructor is facing the camera so his movements are hard to mimic.
I feel like I really need something with multiple camera angles, especially a rear-angle.
If you're spatially-challenged (like maybe I am), you might struggle with this.
Honestly my experience with this disc as well as the Chao Pang has lead me to think the only way to learn Tai Chi is with a personal instructor.  But maybe it's just me!

3662266,5,B001JXPBRE,"I took a good Taiji class years ago, but did not follow up on it. In time, I forgot all the moves. I move house a lot and often live in places and countries without any Taiji instruction for hundreds of miles. Consequently, a DVD is my only chance to practice regularly. I have tried out about seven DVDs before hitting upon this one, with very mixed and frustrating results.

As stated by other reviewers, other DVDs will often ""cheat"" by omitting parts of the form, starting slow but then speeding up, offering muddled instructions...very frustrating and futile.

This is the first DVD in which I feel as if I were participating in a class with a very patient, kind and generous instructor.

This DVD is for you if you are completely new to Taiji, if you took a class once but forgot the moves, if you have had physical difficulties because of surgeries or other types of traumatic experiences and, above all, if you need a gentle yet precise approach.

If you are very physically active, if you are confident with the basic form, or if you have access to regular classes, one of the videos by Jwing-Ming Yang may be better for you.

But as a first experience or a refresher, this DVD is as good as it gets. Highly, highly recommended. I am very grateful to Christopher Pei and to the makers of this DVD.

I like the calming effect it gives me and Master Pei does the moves many times so someone who has trouble using a DVD for exercise can get the moves right.

Of personal note: I have fibromyalgia and a post surgical hip injury. I find many exercise DVDs to be either too aggressive or way too soft. This is perfect for me. I actually do the 10 minute warm up EVERY morning now--and in one month I have RADICALLY improved my flexibility and decreased muscle pain and stiffness.

1. Having to mirror image right and left is confusing.  It would be much easier to follow if he reversed his positions.  This is actually complicated further by the black jogging pants worn by the instructor.  It is not always clear whether he is moving the right or left leg.  If the same DVD was redone with the instructor reversing left and right, I would buy a new one.
