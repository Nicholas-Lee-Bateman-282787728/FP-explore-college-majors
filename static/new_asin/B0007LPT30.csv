8048341,5,B0007LPT30,"I bought this DVD to complete my collection of this series of TMNT, but I also watch it and not have just to collect dust.",1362441600,,122,3.92
8048342,2,B0007LPT30,"Don't you just hate when DVD sets contain out of order episodes?  Exactly what is the point of that?  The space episodes themselves are lackluster, but that is not my beef.

This DVD includes ""The Lesson"" and ""Hunted,"" which absolutely do not belong on this disc and ""Hunted"" only serves to confuse those who saw what happened to Leatherhead some episodes before.  As you can see from my list of shows IN ORDER like it's supposed to be, this disc and the disc that follows (3.2) is severely flawed:

Episode 53: The Christmas Aliens

Episode 54: Space Invaders Part One

Episode 55: Space Invaders Part Two

Episode 56: Space Invaders Part Three

Episode 57: Worlds Collide Part One

Episode 58: Worlds Collide Part Two

Episode 59: Worlds Collide Part Three

Episode 60: Touch and Go

Episode 61: Hunted

Episode 62: H.A.T.E.

Episode 63: Nobody's Fool

Episode 64: New Blood

Episode 65: The Lesson

Episode 66: The Darkness Within

Episode 67: Mission of Gravity

Episode 68: The Entity Below

Episode 69: Time Travails

Episode 70: Hun on the Run

Episode 71: Reality Check

Episode 72: Across the Universe

Episode 73: Same As It Never Was

Episode 74: The Real World Part One

Episode 75: The Real World Part Two

Episode 76: Bishop's Gambit

Episode 77: Exodus Part One

Episode 78: Exodus Part Two

Next time learn that B comes after A, not C!!",1147132800,15,1352,4.698275862068965
8048343,5,B0007LPT30,"Prime Leader Zanrumon still has his sights set on the Fugitoid, and now he's planning a massive invasion of Earth to find him.  He's pulling out all the stops, and he'll stop at nothing until he finds the robot.  Now its up to the turtles to fight off this assault.  Not only to the green teens have to face a full scale invasion, but the sinister Agent Bishop is introduced in this episode as well.  What is his agenda?  Well, I know, but I don't want to spoil anything for you guys who haven't watched season three or four yet.  If you haven't, where ya been?  Oh well, just buy it.

  This five episode Dvd also includes The Lesson in which the toddler turtles must help a young boy face a few bullys.  Hunted is also included as well.  Leatherhead must evade a croc hunter, and the turtles must assist him.  So you defenatly don't wanna miss this one.  Buy it!",1146960000,3,864,4.285714285714286

8048345,5,B0007LPT30,"I happened to snag this early, and found that it has 5 episodes.

Along with the 3-Parter ""Space Invaders"" [mentioned by the other reviewer], the DVD also includes ""The Lesson"" (a cute ep., with another flashback look at the young Turtles), and ""Hunted"" (another great Leatherhead-centered episode).",1110499200,7,299,5.361702127659575
