7928468,3,B00004ZERF,"Four more episodes from Showtime's The Hunger series.  These episodes are from the second season and are introduced by David Bowie.  These stories deal with the different natures of evil.
In the first tale, Bowie is an artist of the extreme who has sought seclusion in an old prison.  But one day a man comes seeking sanctuary and Bowie decides to let him in.  Bowie's motives and what happens makes for a story that many will find disturbing.
In the second story, a partially empty apartment building is suddenly plagued by a vicious killer who seems to me targeting homosexuals.  The building owner, also a homosexual, is visited by the strangely dark Michael who is certainly guilty of something.  A fine dark tale with interesting revelations.
Next we have a homeless man and a mission worker who share a past.  He seems less than sane (or is he more than sane?).  e believes he can see the evil of The Freaks.  She becomes spooked and frightened although he claims they will now be after her and it is now her job to kill them.  Is he crazy?  Interesting.
Finally we get the story of an ex-lawyer, not morgue worker, who is afraid to look in people's eyes.  He thinks that he can see their deepest evils and he does not want to see them.  He has a therapist who wants to help him but doesn't believe him.  To make it worse, the man will not look in the therapists eyes to prove what he says.  In the end the man has a revelation at a tragic moment.  Possibly the best story on the disk.
Because this is a Showtime show, there is plenty of nudity and sex so these stories are not appropriate for all.",1067212800,7,1604,4.386440677966101
7928469,5,B00004ZERF,"When I rented this first DVD of the Hunger Showtime series, I had low expectations for the first 4 episodes because it had been made for a network and was pleasantly surprised when I found these actually manifesting into something worthwhile. It was as if they managed to hit on all cylinders, having all the pieces to an efficiently thought-provoking horror/sci-fi jigsaw puzzle well within their grasp. From the writing and directing to the actors being showcased and the presentation (and acting in the first) done by David Bowie, it all meshed into something worthwhile and, at the same time, easily missed.
Each portion of this tapestry basically showcases some larger-than-life names in little tales of the horrific, merging into separate entities with the same goal of teaching their viewer a life-lesson. Beginning with a tale about an artist that finds himself confronted by a rendition of his past that shows up on his doorstep, we are immediately thrust into the thick of things by a series that apparently wishes to make a statement. Already well known for his works in the work of the shocking (and played by Bowie), the artist finds his piece-of-mind disturbed by someone begging to be let into his fortress of a home, and lets them in to stave off his curiosity and what seems to be something darker still. This leads him into deeper and more shadowy realms of self-discovery and suffering for the sake of creation, climaxing in a result that is strangely entertaining in a bloody sort of way. This leads into the next piece that deals with a killer preying on the homosexual and the angel that seeks to protects them from harm by punishing the one committing these acts, then into a tale that seemed very much to me like an Outer Limits episode when a homeless man suddenly is able to ""see"" the true faces of those about him and finds himself able to protect himself and ""the fire inside him"" from those hidden beasts by killing them with a rather large knife, and finally concludes with a story about the ""sin seer;"" a man that can look into the eyes of a person and see the dilemmas plaguing their lives.
All in all, I would suggest at least looking into these and seeing if you like them because I kept looking at them when I was out, avoiding the series because of something that kept telling me that they wouldn't be any good, and then keep kicking myself for this oversight because of all the gore and overkill added to some of these pieces. For fans of sc-fi/horror/gore, its comes as a welcome scrap from Showtimes bloated table.",1041984000,3,2553,4.6755555555555555
