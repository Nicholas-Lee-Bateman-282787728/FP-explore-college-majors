8386970,5,B0031EUI9U,Trigun is one of my favorite anime series. It was one of the first ones I ever watched. The price for this set was extremely low. There were three dics in the box in excellent condition. The only catch is the dics default to Japanese with English subtitles. You just have to remember to set it to English if you don't want the subtitles.,1362528000,,337,4.28125
