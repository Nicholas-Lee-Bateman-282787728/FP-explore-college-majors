But, even with all the negatives against it I still have a soft spot in my heart for this steaming pile of crap. Not just one pile. But, three. Yes this DVD is so bad @$$ you get three version of this long lost crap feast. Each one worse then the last. I love it. When I watch this movie it really makes me realize why I'm a fan of cinema. This movie makes just about ever other movie seem better. Ok, it's not as bad as ""Avatar"", but what really is? And don't be fooled. This is not a so bad it's good movie. This is a bad movie. Really, painfully, hurts to watch bad. Well worth my $[...]. Every fan of film should see this movie. It should be shown as the first film in every film class in every film school around the world. Just so something like this never happens, ever again. Funny enough, the DVD is one of the all time best. The movie is one of the all time worst. I love this movie. You won't.",1268611200,,1048,3.971563981042654
7977861,2,B00007L4NQ,"Raiders of the Living Dead had accumulated a lengthy stay on my dust-ridden shelves before I finally got around to cracking open the cheap plastic casing and popping the disk into my DVD drive. I wasn't really expecting much from the beginning as it had only cost me a mere five pounds but I was prepared to sit back and watch anyway.

The movie itself stands merely as a simple time waster offering very little new, nor exciting. Its setbacks are the shoddy and over-the-top acting mainly originating from the younger actors, the cheesy special effects, and the downright lack of zombies. These 'Smurf-grey' coloured zombies do make an appearance, don't get me wrong, but they don't really seem to make much of an impact until later, an impact that wasn't going to be shaking anyone's world anyway. Sadly, my zombie taste buds were only ticked.

Raiders of the Living Dead seems more focused on the young lad's ridiculous laser gun, formed from parts of a VHS player. If a VHS player can make a laser gun like that, it stands no chance against today's DVD players. Come on, how often does opening part of a VHS player send a laser ray out that sizzles your hamster?

It also appears the directors were seriously trying to make up some extra time in this 86 minute movie. How necessary are extended scenes of a guy walking past a metal fence, and uneventfully boring nightmares.

Raiders of the Living Dead hasn't aged well either. Only made in 1986, it already looks far more outdated compared to other movies of it's time.

Sadly, Raiders of the Living Dead offers little new and is probably as far away as you can possibly go from receiving an Oscar nomination. For me, the movie simply made it's marks as a mere time-waster. And for five pounds, what do you expect? If you catch it cheap like I did, maybe consider purchasing. But any higher than bargain bin prices then I seriously recommend staying away.",1089590400,9,1910,4.6390532544378695
7977862,2,B00007L4NQ,"Raiders is a cheesy, hoaky, run of the mill forgotten horror film.  Funny at moments with one head exploding scene (the most gore you'll get with this film), Raiders is descent, but not great by any means.
A good thing to have in my collection, but would I watch it again...may be awhile--if never.
...The other DVD's are screwed up versions of the first film, not worth viewing really. Brett Piper's version is incomplete and crap, don't buy it for his version.
You've been warned, bad movie, good collector's item.",1088640000,,516,4.733333333333333
7977863,1,B00007L4NQ,"So bad.  So So So bad.  I can only think of one or two scenes in this movie that were ok, but one or two scenes does not a movie make.  Terrible acting, bad makeup, terrible acting, stupid story, terrible acting, cheesy effects, and terrible acting.  Oh, and the acting was terrible.  A waste of time, money and resources.  Watching paint dry is more entertaining then this.",1048032000,4,374,4.507462686567164
