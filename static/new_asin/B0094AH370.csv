5261140,5,B0094AH370,"The previous reviewers have covered most of the points on this excellent recording and I am in general agreement on most points and I too highly recommend this disc.
I would like to add a few personal points as Sicilian Vespers and I share a long history. One time when a teenager in the late 40s or early 50s I attended a concert in New York and a bass (Pinza?)sang ""O tu Palarmo."" I was fascinated by the depth of emotion in this music. Later in a NBC Symphony concert I heard the Overture of the opera and was thrilled by the music. I recall and even earlier exposure to the work in my Grandmother's collection of RCA Victor 78s one of which was the Siciliana ""Merce dilette amiche"" sung by Luisa Tetrazzini. Fortunately for me, Grandmother had a large collection of Victor records and a wind-up Victrola with cactus needles, the ultimate in sound technology of the day.
My first complete record set of the opera was the 1974 LP set with Martina Arroyo, Domingo, Milnes and conducted by James Levine. (Caballe was supposed to sing Elena but was pregnant again). I loved the opera and still do. Arroyo gave a searing performance and she remains the standard for me. When in Act 1 she sings the ""Coraggio su corragio"" aria and demands that victory is in ""votra mano"" she means it and the chorus and the audience are ready for rebellion. I can still hear her steely voice. I'm afraid that Ms. Dessi of this disc just does not arouse.
My next Sicilian Vespers came as a VHS two tape set of l986. Conducted by Riccardo Chailly and done in Bolognia. The Monforte is Leo Nucci who dominates every scene he is in as he does in the current disc. The voice is smoother in the older disc but just as penetrating. He is truly an amazing artist. The Elena of the 1986 tape is Susan Dunn and the Arrigo is Veriano Luchetti. Both are competent in their parts. A bit part (Ninetta) in this tape is played by Anna Catarina Antonacci. She is a major star these days. The sets in the tape, by the way, looked authentically Sicilian.
The first DVD of this opera was a stunning set of 1989 conducted superbly by Riccado Muti at the La Scala. Two excellent singers took the parts of Elena and Arrigo; Cheryl Studer and Chris Merritt. As long as you didn't have to look at then all was fine. They were top vocalists but not actors and quite heavy. However the sets, costumes chorus and orchestra were top notch with the great Muti leading the show. One sour note was that the Paris ballet was included; the ballerina was far too old and the ballet was bad.
The present recording is excellent in most categories. Armiliato is beautiful to listen to, Dessi maybe couldn't arouse a rebellion  but her Siciliano in Act 5 is sweet to the ear, Tetrazzini not withstanding. I think conductor Zanetti kept tight control over all the doings and produced a truly excellent performance.",1370304000,11,2855,4.490384615384615
5261141,5,B0094AH370,"To understand why I Vespri has always been a bit of a ""problem child"" among Verdi's works, one must understand that it was written as Les Vepres Sicilienne for the Paris Opera. This venue required opera in five acts, written on a GRAND scale, with a required ballet, rousing choruses and extended arias. All this, as I understand it, was a result of Meyerbeer (a FRENCH composer, mes amis, thus to be emulated) who started all that stuff. In addition, Vespri was written next in line, following the ""big three"": Rigoletto, Trovatore and Traviata, none of which could be considered on the Meyerbeer scale, as superb as each is.

The result, gentle reader, is what William Berger (""Verdi With A Vengeance"") calls ""...an opera that has never wholly pleased anybody, despite many excellent qualities ... If anything is missing in Vespri, it's the sustained level of emotional truth so evident in his previous three operas"". Well, it pleased me very well, truth be told, and it has since I first heard it as a Met broadcast, many years ago, and if you love Verdi, you will want to add this to your Verdi operas because, with all its blemishes, it is very good Verdi overall, with many exceptionally moving moments.

Daniella Dessi sings  Elena, a Sicilian duchess in mourning for her murdered brother. Her ...fervent admirer... Arrigo, is sung by her real life SO, Fabio Armeliato (and it's a good thing that they have a license with some of the ardent rolling around that occurs in Act I!! But I digress). Leo Nucci is Montforte, the local tyrant, who (quelle surprise!!) it is revealed is Arrigo's father, which throws a major league monkey wrench into plans by the unknowing Arrigo to assasinate him. Procida, an exiled patriot returned to Sicily is sung by Giacomo Prestia.

Dessi, a recognized Verdi soprano at a time when such are rare, does a nice job. She is able to do all the ""Verdi tricks"" ( melting pianissimi, rich mid voice, full top notes) superbly, despite the fact that the most demanding vocal parts come in the last act. She has a very real stage presence, although with somewhat limited acting skills.

Armiliato is not one of my favorite tenors: he has an annoyingly rough passagio at times wherein he attacks the note an octave below what is written to ""kick start"" the high note intended. Anyone who has studied singing will recognize it as bad technique. Listen to Carlo Bergonzi for an example of a smooth, seamless transition. That said, he does a (to me) surprisingly good job carrying off a very demanding tenor role.

What can be said about Leo Nucci that has not already been written? Born in 1942, there is little in the voice to suggest any diminishing of vocal skills and his acting is very good. Someone reviewing the Tutto Verdi series remarked that the title should have been ""Tutto Nucci"", since he is featured in many of the C Major releases. In each one I have seen, Nucci has been superlative, as he is here!

Prestia, as Procida, does a very good job. His ""o tu Palermo"" melts the heart. His acting is somewhat limited, though, but not sufficiently so to diminish the rating I gave this disc.

Staging is what I call ""limited traditonal"": there is some very innovative staging here, with the theatre being used as an extension of the stage. This is nothing new, but while it works very well in the main, having singers wander among the audience while doing an aria strikes me as a bit off putting. There are some cuts, none of which are serious,and (thank the opera gods!!) the ballet has been cut, as well.

Disc quality is excellent, with (for me) the indispensible DTS surround sound that makes the performance so immediately real. Subtitles abound.

Despite all the critical negativity on Vespri, this is one hugely enjoyable performance of a lovely opera .",1368057600,15,3797,4.71342383107089
5261142,5,B0094AH370,"This production was a big success when mounted in Parma in 2010. The blu-ray is superbly done and should disperse any doubts about this work.  Stage director Pier Luigi Pizzi uses an approach he has used before but never so successfully: he updates the action to the 19th century, to the period of the battles over the unification of Italy, and uses the theater's auditorium as an extension of the stage. This idea is far from new, but I never saw it done so effectively. The ""breaking of the fourth wall"" enables Pizzi to achieve a miracle of sorts: a minimalist staging with some of the Grand Opera effects that Verdi had in mind when he wrote this work for what was the largest opera theatre in the world at the time.

For example, in the opening scene there are only three boats on an otherwise empty stage, and French soldiers make fun of and provoke the local Sicilians. Then Daniela Dess&igrave; (Elena) makes an electrifying grand entrance from the back of the auditorium. Clad in black and veiled she creates a charged dramatic field that spans the entire house, with one pole being the stage and the other the back of the auditorium. She glares eloquently at the unseemly pranks of the French on stage with a dignified, aristocratic disapproval and slowly approaches them, her imposing demeanor dramatizing her grief and subdued rage. The fantastic video direction by Tiziano Mancini shows us her grand entrance as perceived from the stage by the leering French; the shameful behavior of the French as perceived by the disapproving Elena, and Elena's slow, subtly menacing progress towards the stage as perceived by the audience. The combination of dynamic camera work, imaginative staging and Dess&igrave;'s impressive charisma and acting skills create a thrilling theatrical effect. Add the sound engineers who created a sonic marvel that gives us a soundstage and ambiance that correspond exactly to where we see the singers/chorus in the house (with a realistic projection), and you get a gripping experience. There isn't a single moment that is less than completely riveting in this production for its entire duration.

I had my doubts when I saw the cast list (regarding the tenor and soprano), but overall they all give superlative performances. Dess&igrave; gives a commanding performance with her unique, rich timbre, a total artist, a modern Grand Tragedienne. The score has a lot of dynamic markings that call for soft singing (""mezza voce"", ""dolce"", ""dolcissimo"", ""p""; ""pp"", etc.) and she has a full command of a superb mezza voce (light singing). The forte side of the piano-forte spectrum is subdued - the Diva economizes her vocal resources, which is understandable, considering the challenges ahead. The role's more than two octave range is a walk in the park for her, as is the coloratura agility that reaches its first-half peak in the short cadenza of her act II duet with Arrigo ""Presso alla tomba ch'apresi"", with its long trill.  Now for the nitpicking: the role's demands gradually increase in the second half. Her act IV ""Arrigo! Ah parli a un core"" is overall superb; she manages the first two of the cadenza's descending scales, but they are just a warm up for the third, which she glides over rather than really touch the notes (but she does the trill). Caball&egrave; (and many others) did the same thing  and no one complained (but no none glides like Caball&egrave;). So how is her act V bolero? How do you think? It's no better than it was in 1996 in Rome, so it's far from perfect, but if you consult the score you see that her only difficulty is to sing long lines composed entirely of sixteenth notes figurations &agrave;-la-Rossini fast enough (no, she does not interpolate a final high E...Jeezus!). But it's a big show and her elegant style and artistry are of the highest caliber. With Pizzi's help it's also a scene of simple, aching beauty and with the sound engineers' help it's almost a miracle, the way they capture the back and forth between Elena on the stage and the chorus in the auditorium.  When it ended the audience paused for three endless seconds that made my blood curdle (""are they really going to boo her?..."") before a ""brava"" ushered in the applause.

Armiliato usually sounds like he constantly sings on all his capital and forces, probably because if he didn't we'd hear just a generic voice without a distinctive timbre. I always think he wouldn't last when I hear the forcing, but last he does and he knows exactly what he's doing. You need to forget all his previous performances, he is a huge surprise - it's the best I've ever heard him, I did not dream he has it in him. His tone is beautiful in a way I never heard before, his high Bb's and  B's ring securely, he doesn't fudge a single note including rapid coloratura figurations, his phrasing is elegant and his soft singing seductive.  Act V ""La brezza aleggia intorno"" (after the bolero) is cut, so no high D for the tenor (IIRC, some of the repetitions of the concluding act IV concertante are mercifully cut as well, and no ballet). On opening night he got into vocal problems in the second half and was announced indisposed before the second performance, from which most of the material for this blu-ray was taken. He bowed out from his last scheduled performance, so we are lucky to have this Vespri at all, because the replacement was not up to snuff.  To be honest, I don't think Dess&igrave; and particularly Armiliato could have pulled it off in a bigger house, Vespri is truly scary for the tenor and soprano. It took a lot of courage for them to take on these roles.

Giacomo Prestia also offers his best performance so far in the Tutto Verdi series (he also sings in Ernani and in I Masnadieri). Nucci offers great finesse, style and power - he is a reference in many Verdi roles. I don't think there is a better Monforte on record, other than his earlier assumptions of the role. I heard him in this role at the MET when he last sang at the house in 2004. I pulled out a souvenir from that run and realized in retrospect that this may have been the greatest operatic performance I had the good fortune to attend.

The chorus is more than first rate. The musical direction of Massimo Zanetti (who also conducts Rigoletto in these series) overcomes the difficulties of singers and chorus scattered throughout the house with superb detail, precision and attentive accompaniment. The entire cast (particularly Dess&igrave;) seems giddy at the curtain calls - they overcame a supreme challenge and the audience is vocal in its gratitude (there is even a final cry for an encore!). The recording engineers deserve a standing ovation: Paolo Berti, Michele Ruggiero, Alessandro Marsico.

This is a Vespri for the ages and if you are still not convinced about the place this work deserves in the canon you are totally doomed and there is no point even talking about it.",1363564800,29,6903,4.761705685618729

8535679,4,B0094AH370,"Admittedly, this is a difficult opera to stage. It has been said that this is a ""stand-and-sing-opera"". And I must confess that it is difficult to get excited about the plot. Orgininally being composed for Paris as a ""grand op&eacute;ra"", it must be especially difficult to stage on a small stage such as Parma. But from the start the staging is OK. But even if this production convinces in many respects, I feel that I cannot give it five stars. The main singers are good, even if Fabio Armiliato (Arrigo) sometimes sounds strained, and Daniela Dessi (Elena) often is a bit unsteady.",1442793600,,584,4.735294117647059
8535680,5,B0094AH370,"I want to point out that the other two reviews of this opera are not in fact for the Dynamic label production in question but are actually for the Tutto Verdi production.  You can blame Amazon for that.  Why they can't correct this ongoing issue of misplaced reviews is beyond me.

This is a grand opera performed in a very small theater.  The use of the actors and especially the chorus being deployed throughout the entire theater does get a bit claustrophobic in this production but is understandable given the large chorus and the very small size of the stage and theater as a whole.  They wouldn't all fit on the stage at one time I'm afraid.  I do wish for once somebody would mount this opera in period appropriate attire.  Once again we have vaguely 19th century dress for a story that is supposed to take place in the 13th century.  And the fact that the Sicilian ""patriots"" are dressed in a very similar blue uniform as are the occupying French makes things a bit confusing.  Some individual scenes, such as the ball at the end of Act 3 are very colorfully and artfully staged but all in all the staging and costuming were done on a very low budget indeed.  On the other hand I cannot fault the singing which is beautifully sung, very strong and emotive; nor can I fault the orchestra or conducting and these are the most important elements.  I found this version of I Vespri  very entertaining.  Something I cannot say about most versions I have watched or listened to, most of which lead my mind to wander throughout long stretches.  This opera is often criticized as a stand and sing opera where most of the action happens offstage but very little happens onstage.  True enough, so its even more of a compliment when I say besides beautiful singing, all the main actors in this performance emoted enthusiastically, powerfully and convincingly keeping me engaged throughout.  This is the rare performance of I Vespri that was actually fun to watch.  The soprano aces her big arias in Acts 4 and 5.  There are cuts including most but not all the ballet and the tenor aria in Act 5.

 I do long for a truly grand opera production with elaborate staging and rich period appropriate costuming along with great singing actors, but this small stage/ small budget production made the most of what they had to work with.  This performance gives the viewer a good Idea of what provincial, smaller scale opera looks like in Italy these days.  I would add that the viewer who likes this style of production might also enjoy the mostly splendid Tutto Verdi series which includes every one of Verdis operas performed in smaller scale regional theaters, some of his more obscure works had never been filmed before.",1436572800,3,2712,4.6415094339622645
8535681,4,B0094AH370,"I think it is true of Verdi operas that there are no really bad ones.  They may simply be divided into good and better operas.  Unfortunately, in my opinion, although  I Vespri Siciliani, is a good opera, it is nowhere near in caliber musically and dramatically to the three Verdi operas that preceded it chronologically namely Rigoletto, Il Trovatore and La Traviata.  There are parts of the opera that are tedious musically and dramatically and the stirring Verdi cavatinas and cabalettas are by and large missing from the opera.  The parts for chorus are surprisingly weak.

 I Vespris problems may stem from the fact that Verdi composed the opera as Les Vepres Siciliennes for the Great Exhibition in Paris of 1855 and therefore likely attempted to compose an opera along the lines of the then popular operas composed by Meyerbeer for the French grand opera.  Accordingly, the opera is unduly long consisting of five acts and includes a lengthy ballet (thankfully omitted from this production).  The Meyerbeer operas are rarely performed nowadays and I Vespri Siciliani has suffered a similar fate and probably for the same reasons of excessive length and prolonged periods of dullness.  Also, the Eugene Scribe libretto has many silly and illogical moments.

Despite all of this, I think I Vespri Siciliani is a fine and even wonderful opera and I enjoyed this production by the Teatro Regio di Parma.  The opera house itself is an exquisite jewel box that is more suited to intimate operas than to grand operas.  The opulent gilt, cream and red velvet dcor is most striking.  Pier Luigi Pizzi, the director/designer has overcome the problems of presenting a grand opera on a small stage by using spare sets and by moving some of the operas action into the auditorium.

The chorus often stands at the back of the theater behind the audience causing some coordination and sound problems.  The principal characters often enter and leave from the rear of the theater rather than from the stage.  The audience looked rather bemused by having an operatic character singing a few feet away from them as happened with some audience members.  This type of theater-in-the-round concept takes a little getting used to, but after a while I rather enjoyed it.

Apart from Leo Nucci who sings the role of Guido di Monforte the remainder of the cast are not well known in the USA.  Leo Nucci sings beautifully and even manages to soften the rigid and ruthless character of the governor of Sicily when desperately seeking the love of his son, Arrigo, who is largely on the other side in the French-Sicilian conflict.  His In braccio alle dovizie in Act III is quite stunning.  I was struck though by the general competence of all the performers.  Giacomo Prestia gives a moving performance as Giovanni da Procida, a Sicilian doctor who is a strong Sicilian patriot and who wishes to eject the French occupiers.  His O tu, Palermo, terra adorato in Act II is beautifully sung and he manages to convey all the emotion that makes this one of Verdis most famous bass arias.

Fabio Armiliato is very effective as Arrigo.  I found his singing to be excellent although his acting at times is a little silly and unconvincing.  Daniela Dessi as the Duchess Elena does a fine job in general but has difficulty with top notes.  She simply was unable to perform the famous Bolero (Merce, dilette amiche) in Act V with any degree of effectiveness as shown by the tepid audience response to this famous showpiece.  Her Arrigo, ah parli a un core is rather lovely but Maria Callas showed how this should really be sung.  Ms. Dessi has a dignified stage presence.  She is dark, attractive and every inch a tragic Verdi heroine.  Her entry aria in Act I, in which she whips up the courage of the downcast Sicilians, is perhaps the most strikingly effective part of the entire production.

The production values of this Blu-Ray DVD are very good.  The video quality is excellent.  The audio quality is good.  However, when the chorus is arrayed at the back of the house, there is some loss of volume which makes it less effective.  The sets are very spare consisting of very few props on the stage but are nonetheless effective.  The costumes are mainly black except when brides to be, including Elena, adopt snow-white costumes.

In conclusion, this is a very competent production of a Verdi opera that has some intrinsic limitations.  I would recommend it to any Verdi lover who, like me, has never had an opportunity to attend a live performance of I Vespri Siciliani.",1425772800,3,4543,4.804123711340206
8535682,5,B0094AH370,Dessi and Armiliato seem to be recoding / filming most of the Italian repertory. I Vespri Siciliani is still not one of Verdi's most popular score but I find it completely  satisfying and this performance very enjoyable. Both artists know the style and bring temperament to their roles. The supporting cast is very strong and this is a good version of the work.,1407801600,3,361,4.73015873015873
8535683,5,B0094AH370,"I Vespri was composed for the Opera in Paris. The whole 5 acts, the required ballet, long and in French. It was later translated to Italian while keeping the French characteristics of the opera.
This production is exactly the opposite of what Grand Opera staging is supposed to be.  The stage is not particularly big, minimalistic staging and, most impressively, it is very intimate.  The director, Pier Luigi Pizzi, uses not only the stage, but also the auditorium. People at the audience find themselves sitting just next to a singer or the chorus. It cant get more intimate than that. Regrettably, the musical effect of having a great singer like Nucci singing next to you is lost in the recording.
Although the plot of the opera is not great in dramatical terms, in particular its macabre ending, the music is beautiful and engaging, lots of great arias very well executed by the cast. In addition, the sound in the Blu-ray is almost perfect.
In summary, a very interesting staging, great music and captivating filming, we cant ask for more. Highly recommended.",1399248000,,1065,4.878453038674033

It really is an excellent performance, part of the Verdi bicentennial series produced in Padua.  I thought the singing quite good, even though the artists are not world famous.  The staging is bare bones but effective.  Not a flashy production but true to the story.  This opera's ending is problematic-I don't think this director did it any favors.  I recommend it for Vespri lovers like me (i.e. I have three different productions on audio in addition to this video and just spent five hours at the theater to see the film of Covent Garden's French version).",1387584000,,686,4.762711864406779

The lovers are Armiliato and Dessi, who are husband and wife in real life, and are acceptable in this version of Vespri Siciliani.. I did not like the bass, but the other 3 characters are fine.
