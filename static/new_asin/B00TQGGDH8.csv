8702778,4,B00TQGGDH8,"I liked this little film.  I  won't go into detail because  the  other reviews  were spot on.  I liked the two main  characters Nate and Johnny and I thought  they  gave natural performances - the other performances were less impressive.  Nothing new plot wise.  Predictable end.  But I was feeling romantic and love Brits.  A suggestion  to  those finding slang hard  to follow.  Turn  on  subtitles  and look  up words you  don't know. The list is pretty short.  Trust me, I'm not takin' the piss mate!  :-D",1501632000,,509,4.586206896551724

8702782,4,B00TQGGDH8,"This film hardly broke any new ground in the area of gay cinema, but it was well done, entertaining, and certainly worth a watch.  It was a good story and for the most part, the acting was excellent.  It did seem a bit far-fetched that Nate would go to such great lengths to protect his secret, then be so incredibly blase when he's finally outed at the speed-dating event.  Also, it was sometimes challenging to follow the film because of the character's accents and the use of local (British) expressions, but that wasn't a bad thing as it made the setting all that more realistic.  I was somewhat disappointed that there wasn't more skin shown, but that's probably okay since Johnny was only moderately attractive, and Nate...well, let's just say that he wasn't my cup of tea.  I definitely enjoyed the ending; a bit predictable, perhaps, but warm and uplifting nonetheless.",1446595200,,877,4.781456953642384

8702784,4,B00TQGGDH8,"Set in Manchester we meet Nate who runs a record shop and is ensconced in `the closet' as the saying goes. He has two sisters who both have a crisis and just move into his flat. They are full of the joys of relationships and the lows and go for the default hetro option and think Nate just needs to meet the right girl.

Meanwhile a new neighbour has moved in to another flat - this is Jonny and the two boys sort of hit it off. But Nate still thinks he can not come out to his friends and family (this is Manchester by the way where you have to explain if you are not gay sometimes). Anyway he is also an aspiring musician but just like his love life he lacks confidence in coming out with it all. As you can guess this story is all around the relationships and whether Nate will finally fess up to his true self.

Now this is a rather good indie effort; it does have production issues, the sound could be better and some of the acting is a bit staged. That said this has a great big heart and some funny and tender moments which bring it back from being barely ok. There is nothing new here in terms of plot - as we have all seen it before. And that is ok so long as it is done well and for the most part it is. It is supposed to star Jody Latham of `Shameless' fame but he is only in it for a few minutes of screen time. However, despite its flaws I still enjoyed this and would give a seven out of ten but I am rounding it to four stars as I always appreciate a good indie effort and it's made in Manchester too which is brilliant.",1429401600,2,1535,3.9483870967741934
8702785,4,B00TQGGDH8,"Here is another wonderful example of why TLARelesing is so important to the world of cinema. They spot them and give them an outlet on DVD. What they spot are fantastic films of love, relationships, comedy and unique stories that people can relate to. They give an outlet to cinema that should be seen in all its storytelling and movie making glory, and Three in a Bed is a prime example of that important choice of cinema that should be seen by the masses.

This is a wonderful romantic coming of age comedy from the UK. It's a film that is funny and one that shines in acting, story and direction. The plot is simple, your main star Nate who is a musician lives his life, but soon his two sisters crash the party having to live with him. Well next door to Nate is a new sexy man that he has a thing for. Now he is stuck in the middle, literally, he does not know how his love life can prevail. His sisters don't know he is gay.

Very funny, and sexy. There are many moments I found myself hysterically laughing. The acting by all is what stands out. All the players come together and play off each other with great chemistry and comical moments. Brandon Reece is an amazing and truly awesome actor that gives his all to the part of Nate. Alongside actor Darren Bransford, who plays Nate's love interest, Johnny, both are magical together and work the parts. One of the strongest points to the show is the chemistry between the actors, coming off as real and emotional and comical at times. Both Reece and Bransford perform with ease. These two together, reminds me of acting elitism.

Nate no longer can live his life now that his sisters have invaded. He hides behind the truth of who he is, causing conflict and drama that only he can fix through decisions, he must make.

Beautiful, funny and brilliant. You can finish my review here: http://www.abucketofcorn.com/2015/03/three-in-bed-2014.html",1427673600,2,1899,4.592920353982301
