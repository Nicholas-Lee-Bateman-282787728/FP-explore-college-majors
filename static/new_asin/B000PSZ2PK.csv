8193224,5,B000PSZ2PK,"I am using this 2 or 3x a week to improve my flexibility & for paddle strength. So far I see an improvement. I combine this with yoga the other 2 days & am getting stronger  A simple work out, goes by quickly & not drawn out.  I am sweating 5 mins into the work out because you really are working out..but in a fun way. If you are a beginner surfer like I am, this is giving me all the strength I can when I am not able to practice out in the Texas surf!! (Yes, there is surf in Texas).",1402272000,,486,3.7549019607843137
8193225,5,B000PSZ2PK,"I love this DVD as you use light weights and a ball with it.  You get a good well rounded workout.  This is not a waste of money, especially if you do board sports or are a swimmer.  I have improved my body shape doing this workout.",1392163200,,232,3.893617021276596
8193226,4,B000PSZ2PK,"This is a very nice workout.  It is kind of short, which I guess is ideal for some.  It does feel like just when you start to get going, it suddenly ends and you then have a 20-minute stretch and cool down.  It is basically a 5-minute warm up, then a 21 minute workout (which is pretty good), followed by a 21-minute stretch and cool down.  I wish the workout were longer.
But i did feel sore in my shoulders the next day after the first time I did it- so it must be doing something.
The only other drawback is that you need MULTIPLE weights.  I thought maybe a 15lb would be enough- but they were a little heavy for some exercises, then much too light for others.  I think for me, i would want 8lb, 10lb, 15lb and maybe a 35lb weights.  So that is a little annoying.
Overall, a good little workout though.  Although I think if you have the option, just go surf for an hour and that will serve you better!",1298246400,,905,4.1022727272727275
8193227,5,B000PSZ2PK,This is the best workout video for surfing I have ever tried. I was very weak and wanted to be able to surf the whole time I was away. This workout definitely got me ready for my trip so I could surf the whole time and not be sore the first days.,1267747200,2,246,3.75
8193228,5,B000PSZ2PK,"I bought this DVD before taking my first surfing trip and after taking a few lessons.  I did it 3x/week for a month prior to my trip and really saw results.  I can't say I felt like a stronger paddler, but I had much more endurance.  And I was much, much less sore each morning after surfing, which says to me that the workout targeted the exact muscles used while surfing.  I highly recommend this workout for other beginner surfers, but it's also a fantastic full-body workout for anyone and takes only 45 minutes (including warm-up and most of the cool-down).  Added bonuses are that my biceps pop a little more and my butt's perked up a bit. :)",1195430400,3,648,4.411764705882353
8193229,5,B000PSZ2PK,"I found this exercise program to be very helpful and the DVD itself was very nicely done. I think it's a great program even if you're not a surfer. The fundamentals it teaches apply to anyone, not just surfers.

They seem to know exactly what they are talking about, the video was very easy to follow, and the results have been very positive for me so far. I've had lower back problems in the past, and was told strengthening my core was highly important to improving my health. The Core work this program promotes have really helped me. If core strengthening is one of your priorities, this is a great program, whether you're a surfer or not.",1189987200,3,643,4.495726495726496
