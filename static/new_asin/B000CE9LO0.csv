8098154,2,B000CE9LO0,"Let me tell you what you get when you buy this movie:  We start with a mental patient escaping from a hospital.  This takes about 1 minute, as the nurse walks into his room, the lights are out, and someone grabs her.  Okay, then we get the longest thrash metal song ever recorded.  A really generic thrash metal song.  While this thing plays and plays and plays, we watch feet walking down the street.  For about two minutes.  Then we watch an elevator door open and close while the opening credits are displayed.  This takes probably 8 - 10 minutes.  Then we're lucky enough to watch the camera go around in a circle over a bunch of garbage laying on a floor.  And the thrash metal song still plays!  Congratulations movie makers, this marks the first time I've hit the fast forward button withing the first two minutes of a movie.

Then we meet our characters.  The guys are basically dirtbags, and so are the girls.  A couple of the girls are quite well endowed, which is about the only good thing in this whole movie.  Even though they all look to be in their mid-late twenties, we're apparently supposed to believe that they're too young to buy alcohol, so we waste some time as they discuss how they're going to get alcohol and then we waste some more time actually watching one guy standing outside a liquor store trying to talk somebody into buying beer for them.

Anyhow...they eventually arrive at this building where they're going to do some partying.  It's under renovation, so nobody lives there.  Oh, except for the slasher.  The ""kids"" go up to the roof and we get another thrash metal video.  At least the photography is nice this time, the cameraman zooms in on the girls' chests quite a bit.  Then we waste some more time as they play with a Ouija board (one girls spends a while talking about how dangerous it is), and it spells out ""death"".  Oh yeah, now we're terrified.  A couple wander off for a makeout session, and the slasher kills them in a pretty routine manner.  I have to say, there is a fair bit of scary atmosphere when they're wandering around inside the dark building.  Unfortunately, it's too little and way too late to help this movie much.

Another couple wanders off and gets killed in another pretty boring scene, then the others meet a crazy lady who explains the killer's motives to them.  This scene is pretty laughable actually.  They're running for their lives but stop to chat with a crazy lady, lol.  The showdown between the killer and the last survivor is pretty good actually, I'll give them credit for that.  Okay, now the movie's pretty much over, but we get another music video, a completely pointless surprise, and then ten solid minutes of closing credits.  Whew, I think we can almost call this a movie now!

Overall, crummy characters, so much padding it'll have you fast forwarding within five minutes of putting in the DVD, no plot whatsoever - even for a slasher - and a small amount of good atmosphere.  A small amount of T&A, and some boring deaths.  It's not the worst thing I've seen lately, but it's in the ballpark.",1222473600,2,3080,4.550091074681238
8098155,1,B000CE9LO0,"This movie just barely goes through the motions of all the other movies it's ripping off. Not even fun as trash - it's too dark to see large parts of it.  No scares, no suspense, nuthin.  Rock bottom.",1222214400,,200,4.2368421052631575
8098156,3,B000CE9LO0,"The director CORBIN TIMBROOK ( BLOOD RANCH, A CRACK IN THE FLOOR... ) and the producer DAVID STERLING ( DEMONICUS, GRAVE VENGEANCE, HELL'S HIGHWAY... ) once joined forces to give the world that TOWER OF BLOOD. Was it necessary ? Hell yeah it was !! It was because the world always need another SLASHER flick if you ask me. That one is about a bunch of (very) horny teens having an orgy in a abandonned buiding. All they want is to get stoned, get high and have sex. All we want is to see them die ( it's not that there is something wrong with them though... ). Fortunately for us, a big ape-like machete killer fresh out the looney bin has found shelter in the same very building. So you know, some people are being dismembered, strangled, impaled while making love... the usual lovely stuff we've come to expect and enjoy.
 CORBIN TIMBROOK got major skills, his movies always look more expensive than they are. It's especially obvious with this one being a STERLING production. When it comes to production values everything is pretty much on point. Most of the actors are good, the editing is involving and the cinematography is allright even though they could have used more lights ( it's a bit too dark at times ). Now the GORE... don't expect much it ( in other words this is not VIOLENT SH.. man ) but enough for you not to feel cheated.
The bottom line is : if you wanna see some machete slashing into some sexy bimbo's skull and some nudity, GORYSSIMO advice you not to go further and to enter the TOWER OF BLOOD.",1192492800,,1520,4.428571428571429
8098157,2,B000CE9LO0,"Whitney Houston and someone did a song by that name, but it fits this cast very well. The killing is so dated that it lessons themovie, as apposed to great movies in the past like ""Halloween and Friday the 13"" are dated but you never pay attention to that, because they are great movies. This movie is not great. I can imagine a bunch of college students sitting around, watching it, but few others. Some of the actual killing was silly, especially at the end.""Ravenous"" is a great movie to rent instead. Leave this one on the shelf , unless you are really, really bored. This one could have been a lot better, had this oversized ape killer beat his victims to death and then snapped the girls necks, bodyslam and beat the guys senselss,before throwing them off of the roof or something more action oriented. This would have subbed for the lack of story. Instead we got yet another masked killer, with a bid knife killing a group of horny teens, who should have been at home, but instad chose to spend the night in an abandoned building. Well, I am going to abandon this movie, and you should too. Not the worst horror movie, but could have been better.",1175731200,,1153,4.469194312796208
8098158,1,B000CE9LO0,"Bad acting, bad script, uncoordinated wardrobe, and pathetic ""special effects"". I'm glad this came in a 2 pack with a decent film and didn't cost any more the the one by itself. I have been watching horro and suspence films for the majority of my life and this one goes on the top of the realy bad list. That is why I say giving it one star is gracious. stay away if you want to keep your IQ.",1175731200,,392,4.038461538461538
8098159,1,B000CE9LO0,"This was a pretty damn boring movie.  Thank god I did not buy it, for I would be rather angry at myself. Boring plot, boring actors, you can probably see where I'm going with this. They couldn't even throw any gore into the movie for at least something to watch. I guess that would have put them over budget.  I will say that I thought the cover art looked pretty cool, which is why I rented it in the first place. So overall, I would not recommend this to anyone.",1164067200,,464,4.144444444444445
