Quality of DVD--excellent, good condtion etc.",1264464000,,165,5.875
3903836,4,B002C4ORME,"As noted by the other reviewers here, this is really a superb movie.  I highly recommend it and the movie itself gets 5 stars.  However, Warner Brothers sells this exact same DVD on their online shop ""wbshop"" for $19.95 with free shipping.  With a 20% coupon, I just bought it there for less than $16!",1260230400,6,301,4.4363636363636365
3903837,5,B002C4ORME,"The opening narration by Al Schmid(John Garfield) would elicit a chuckle from anyone from Philadelphia.  He talks about how he used to visit the historic monuments afterschool as a child.  Anybody knowing the geography of the city and where Schmid resided knows that required him to take the 56 trolley car and transfer to the elevated train to get to these landmarks.  Schmid resided in my neighborhood in the Tacony section of the city.  The movie was filmed partially on location there and from the distance I could see the parochial school that I attended as a child.  Hometown pride would allow for a certain degree of bias in reviewing this film.  That's why I'm grateful that ""Pride of the Marines"" is such a resounding success.  The film begins with Schmid living comfortably as a regular Joe carrying his lunchpail to the steel mill and looking forward to seeing his girl, Ruth(Eleanor Parker), and his occasional hunting jaunts.  Duty calls as he's reading the Sunday funnies on December 7,1941 and he joins the Marines.  At Guadalcanal Al distinguishes himself in battle with the cost of his eyesight.  Recuperating at the V.A. hospital in San Diego, the transition is rough on Al with his feelings alternating between anger and self-pity.  With the help of friends and sympathetic hospital staffers Al is able to make the slow transition back to normalcy before returning to Philadelphia and Ruth and an uncertain future.  What cannot be diminished is Al's heroism and his service to his country.  In every aspect this film excels.  Director Delmer Daves uses authentic location shooting to give the film's opening scenes a homey feel.  The battle sequences have an intensity that I found comparable to Oliver Stone's ""Platoon"".  In the film's second half the focus is on the returning wounded and the questions of why we fight are compellingly bandied about.  Garfield probably has the role of his career effectively conveying the transitions his character goes through.  Parker, who I feel is one of the great unsung actresses in American cinema(see ""Detective Story"" and ""Interrupted Melody""), projects warmth and compassion as Schmid's supportive fiancee.  ""Pride of the Marines"" may be one of those films that has fallen through the cracks.  It's not a blatant flag-waver and it's obscurity may be the result of it's understatement.  It's a landmark film that definitely should be sought out.",1256601600,19,2409,5.048101265822785
3903838,5,B002C4ORME,"This movie is so much fun.  In the first half its all about the man, a civilian going through everyday like as an average Joe, a Joe who is a great guy, a typical fun loving guy from the fun lovin 40s.  The little things, the almost nuance lines are so classic 40s you just have to love it, if you love a look back in time. Nowhere can you get this kind of day to day situation of life in the 40s, in no other movie I've ever seen!  This movie is one of my all time favorites.  I was highly responsible for promoting it to be offered on DVD, and ""I'm Mighty Proud"" to own it.  I quote Al Schmidt from the movie.  He was awarded The Navy Cross, for his actions in repelling a major Japanese offensive, and lost his sight in the process.  Ho goes through some Hell dealing with whats happened to him, who wouldn't?  But the awesome and realistic acting is so superb, like when his fiance is talking to him back at home and he realizes how right she is by the mere power of her honest and heart touching words.  His face and the tone of his words as he responds to her words, all such perfect acting right to the last!  This is a great movie!  I Love It!!!  100 STARS.",1255392000,15,1165,4.017391304347826
3903839,5,B002C4ORME,"This movie stands alone in so many categories, it's unbelievable its been so long passed over for DVD release that it's truely a crime.  The early scenes of the movie show Al Schmid as his life was prior to the onset of the war when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor and it's so classic 1940's its priceless!!  The humor or what you see onscreen is so real life you'll be glued to it and love it forever.  It's always been one of my favorites.  Eleanore Parker is so perfectly cast you love her immediately, as well as every other actor and actress.  The acting is utterly realistic and top notch.  It's incredulous this movie isn't available on DVD yet, how can this be possible?  The first third of the movie is Al meets Ruthie, and its my favorite third, the middle is the revelation of a gritty war that leaves a great guy to deal with the price he pays as one brave American who fought for ""OUR"" freedom, as so many brave souls have done before him, the backbone of this brave nation of unsung heroes.  Well, this story sings out of the true tale of one of these heroes and does it with stark realism and pulls no punches in doing so.  We see the side of heroism most people don't like to think about, the men sitting healing in a hospital and learning to deal with their new handicaps.  We see a man who doesnt want to be a burden, or be pitied by others.  We see a loving fiance whose precious committed heart yearns only to have her lover back in her arms.  and in the end we see a happy couple and get to feel great at the final outcome after so tragic a twist of fate comes full circle and life becomes the blessing it was meant to be all along.  If you love to see the fun and beauty of 1940's life during that more innocent era, and then a happy ending after the ravages life whips up suddenly like a tempest, then watch this movie.  I've seen this movie a million times because thank God I taped it 25 years ago off TV on my VCR.  Now I'm dying to see a high resolution digitally remastered copy one day when someone wakes up and does justice to this timeless classic.  This is the most rewatchable movie I own, and I own a lot of them!  I like the whole movie, but the first half of it is so uniquely excellent I could watch just that part alone, every month!  Man if this movie doesnt make me smile at the 40's antics, enjoy!",1246492800,7,2339,4.16
3903840,1,B002C4ORME,"This is really a four star movie, but it is being sold at twice the retail price.  You can purchase this from Warner Home Video for $19.95.  Don't be fooled by this seller!",1245196800,4,172,4.181818181818182
3903841,5,B002C4ORME,Oldie but goodie according to my hubby!  He was happy I found it for him!,1431820800,,73,3.8666666666666667
3903842,5,B002C4ORME,"Definitely John Garfield's best film in my humble opininion. It is more of a story about unconditional love than a war film. Garfield and Eleanor Parker show some great chemistry here despite being separated for a great deal of the movie. Great story about real life WW2 hero Al Schmid. If you enjoyed this film, you must try Since You Went Away, The Best Years Of Our Lives and Tomorrow Is Forever. All of these fit into the war on the homefront category as I like to call it.",1426377600,,477,4.370786516853933

3903845,4,B002C4ORME,"It's a real story of a disable WWII veteran who has to adjust to his new life.  It has the feel of ""Its a Wonderful Life"".  At 120 minutes it spends substantial time for character development compared to modern movies.  I highly recommend it.",1416614400,,242,4.454545454545454
3903846,5,B002C4ORME,"May be one of the best war movies ever done.  Garfield is great - just look at how he portrays a blind man,",1410480000,,107,3.652173913043478

3903849,5,B002C4ORME,"This is a great movie. It accurately portrays an American blue collar mindset prior and during WWII, and the painful emotional lessons of life. The scenes of Marines on Guadalcanal are very accurate with no propaganda of any kind. You can taste the struggle, pain, and fear. I highly recommend this movie, because it's one of a kind.",1398124800,,333,4.758620689655173

3903851,4,B002C4ORME,"I hadn't seen this movie in several years, but was glad to catch it on TCM recently and loved it all over again.  The initial heat between Garfield and Parker is amazing.  What is it about John Garfield and the way he looks at a woman?  As for Eleanor, what can you say but that while she may not have been on the same level with Lana Turner or some of the other starlets of her day, she was one drop dead gorgeous redhead and that is NEVER a bad thing.

All in all a great movie with love winning over pride.",1368230400,,509,3.9607843137254903
3903852,5,B002C4ORME,One of the finest WWII movies. Beautifully acted by Eleanor Parker and John Garfield. Anyone who loves the movies from that period should see it.,1365465600,,145,4.84
3903853,5,B002C4ORME,The fact that this story was based on an actual individual and events made it more enjoyable. Thr haunting scenes in the jungles with the approaching Japs and the steadfast character of the Marines is most memorable. Saw this movie 50 years ago and it is ageless.,1354838400,,263,4.617021276595745
3903854,5,B002C4ORME,"Any film which stars John Garfield runs the risk of a real-life character (Al Schmidt) being upstaged by the actor. After all, Garfield is known for his rebellious character and the question is asked as to whether he is believable and convincing. I know nothing about Schmidt's persona in real life, but I do know that after seeing this film I was convinced that Garfield and Schmidt were one and the same. I have lost count of the number of times I've seen this movie. It is quite outstanding in its characterization and realism of what went on at Guadalcanal in 1942. My favourite sequence is the fantasy where the blinded Schmidt taps his way with a stick along the railway platform. The US Marine Corps deservedly takes pride in this Marine.",1351209600,,745,4.651515151515151
3903855,5,B002C4ORME,A movie I saw as a young boy when it first came out on the big movie screen.  A movie that stuck in my mind all these years.  A blue collar worker who was caught up in WWII.  I could relate because I was a blue collar worker who spent six years in the Marine Corps in the term oil of the 1960s.,1350691200,,294,3.634920634920635
3903856,4,B002C4ORME,It's a great movie. The facts are correct but the time line isn't. My Dad fought in this battle on Guadalcanal (Battle of Tenaru). My wife and I stood on the sand bar that was in the movie and we saw the exact spot where this machine gun nest was located. The only problem was that the disc had several bad spots during the last 15 minutes of the movie. It caused problems with the picture and sound.,1334707200,,400,4.141025641025641
3903857,3,B002C4ORME,"Inspiring Movie.  They should have made another movie in 1945 for Medal of Honor recipient ""John Bassilone"" who is portrayed in the HBO series ""The Pacific"". Both Marines real American hero's.",1285027200,,192,5.193548387096774
3903858,5,B002C4ORME,Great human story about an average american guy caught up in the horror of war. Facing a cruel enemy in the jungles of Guadalcanal in 1942. A story about a machine gun crew holding off countless japanese soldiers while themselves severly wounded. And then he has to face a bigger battle when shipped home. The fight to go on living without the use of his eye sight.,1279152000,,365,4.462686567164179
3903859,5,B002C4ORME,"I am a collector and constant viewer of WW2 movies. Especially the ones made during the War. I consider this the finest WW2 movie made. It shows what the average people were thinking when we got into the war. It's scenes of combat were
realistic and beleivable. Most important was the manner in which the director and
actors addressed the coming home with so many types of wounds. Much research with
medical staff and actual injuries was seen to insure the message was sent on what
is done to help those who gave so much to re adjust to civilian life with their injuries both physcial and mental. Not all our prople came back whole then as now
and it is important to show what was done to help them...I waited a long time for this movie to finally come out in DVD and have watched it several times since it
arrived. A truley worth while movie and a ""keeper"" for anyones WW2 movie
collection.",1277942400,3,891,4.406060606060606
3903860,4,B002C4ORME,"He plays Al Schmid the ""Pride"" in Pride of the Marines. He's ""Joe Sixpack "" in 1941. He's a steelworker, from Philly, full of himself, a bit obnoxious but everybody loves him. He's got two families, his best friend, his best friend's wife & daughter &  his girlfriend, Ruth. His second family is his buddies in the Marines, which he joins shortly after the war begins. He returns from Guadalcanal, the first American land victory in the Pacific, blind. Recovery back in San Diego presents him with new challenges. He is not going to recover his sight. So begins his emotional roller-coaster. Will Ruth still want him?  Does he still love her?  Should he dump her rather than be a burden? Lots of self pity. But he has a great support system, other injured Marines at the hospital, a compassionate Red Cross worker, his friends at home & of course, Ruth. She never wavers in her love for him. He is to be awarded the Navy Cross for heroism & has to return to Philly eventually to get it & start his new life. His story is covered in magazines, with pictures which, for this particular Marine surely helped. Pretty good & inspiring movie.",1275436800,9,1136,4.5588235294117645

8363145,5,B002C4ORME,A great John Garfield film.  He gives an excellent performance of real life Marine Al Schmidt.  And considering the age of the film the war scenes are pretty realistic.  Based on a true story.  A must for all John Garfield fans.  And a great introduction to this very talented actor.  Shame he passed so young and had such tough time at the end of his.  His own lifestory plays out like a film.  It would make an interesting movie.,1464912000,,431,4.367088607594937

8363148,3,B002C4ORME,"I enjoyed this movie though I felt John Garfield overcooked the anger of the wounded Marine.  There are worse things than losing limbs.  Sometimes keeping them is the worse choice, simply because a damaged limb can cause more problems than an amputated limb.  Additionally, the acting is out of place with our touchy feely world.  When we fight wars, it helps to become racists in order to dehumanize the enemy.  We have always done it.  That said, I am sure the level of racism in this movie will offend some viewers.

I give this movie three stars because the story is worth telling even in the face of the drawbacks mentioned above.",1443916800,,635,4.616071428571429
8363149,5,B002C4ORME,"Great film! Definitely one to watch over and over. Eleanor Parker was so pretty. Also, amazing to see Philly back in the 40's. The war scene from Guadalcanal was also done well for a film made in the 40's. How these guys made it through those long, gut-wrenching nights while Japanese soldiers shouted out taunts of ""Marine, tonight you die!"" is beyond me. Creepy...True heroes they were!",1443398400,,388,4.8059701492537314
