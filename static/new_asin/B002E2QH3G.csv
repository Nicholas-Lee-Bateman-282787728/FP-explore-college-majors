TURN OFF THE CENTURY was her public-access variety series produced with underground filmmaker (and Mors Syphilica singer) Lisa Hammer (currently best known as the voice of Triana Orpheus on THE VENTURE BROTHERS), and featured everything from music performances, interviews with freak idols like Tiny Tim, poetry recitations, and original short films from silent to doll animations to DIY tutorials.
