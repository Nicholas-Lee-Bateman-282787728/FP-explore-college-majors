6463316,1,B00L29MR4A,This film had a very loose plot line.  You were not sure where the film was going at the end.  I did not enjoy this film and I am a fan of his films.,1411689600,,149,3.3529411764705883

6463318,3,B00L29MR4A,"It's apparent in this film (as well as with ""The Monkey King"") that Donnie Yen's trying to get away from the more serious, grim crime dramas he's done in recent years and have some fun.  The story is light and breezy, although disjointed with a few huge gaps in credibility and logic, even given the film's premise.  Donnie is a Chinese general who lived several hundred years ago.  He is framed for treason and is about to be executed when he and certain of his companions are frozen in an avalanche and placed in suspended animation.  The film never shows us how Donnie and his friends are discovered, but needless to say they manage to defrost in modern-day Hong Kong, and hi-jinks ensue.  A lot of the culture/time period clashes are played for laughs (some extremely forced).  The bit where two of Donnie's former henchmen, now defrosted, kill a few policemen and take over a criminal gang jars with the attempts the movie makes later on into portraying them as comedic good guy sidekicks.  There's also a Macguffin that all the time-lost warriors need to find, but all that is left unresolved when the climatic fight on a bridge leads to Donnie's character falling into the water---and then the movie ends!!!!!  Then there is a trailer of what I assume is the sequel film, which hopefully will tie the story up and make sense of all the goings on.  When the sequel makes it's way to these shores is anybody's guess.

Another problem I had with the film was the quality of the subtitling.  It's not quite as bad as the heyday of HK film of the 80s and 90s, when the subtitles were written over a weekend by high school students studying English, but it's nowhere near the quality you get with the HK/Chinese films distributed by Well Go USA or  Dragon Dynasty.  Be that as it may, I still enjoyed the overall experience of watching the film, and will hunt down the sequel when it's released.",1408838400,20,1896,4.57396449704142
6463319,5,B00L29MR4A,It had a good storyline with a touch of mystery. Donnie Yen pulled off a few new stunts this time and the martial arts is always great. The ending was good suggesting a sequel.,1408665600,4,176,4.205882352941177

6463336,3,B00L29MR4A,"I was excited to see Donnie do another time piece of olden China.  I think he excels when you see his raw talent.  Unfortunately it seems that Donnie really, really, really wants to crack Hollywood since this is a blend of yesteryear meets 2014.  Think the Brady Bunch movies.  I thought those were hilarious.  However this I felt was neither funny not clever.  It's ok, felt a little forced and crass.  Stunts and camera were good, storyline wasn't.

Also ... the movie left you hanging for the sequel.  Not really sure I'll be paying for that one.  All in all, an ok movie.",1455926400,3,575,4.495145631067961

action scenes are so much fun too my favorite part is the scene on the bridge between Donnie and the other 2 warriors. but this ends with a cliffhanger and gotta wait to part 2 comes out I hope that happens soon. thank you very much again Donnie I am so happy with this movie.

6463350,1,B00L29MR4A,"I very rarely comment on films but this pathetic bomb motivated me. False advertising as the cover makes it appear another historical period piece with elegant costumes and lots of fighting but in fact its a feeble comedy set in Hong Kong full of vulgar jokes and swearing with total about 15 min of actual kung fu, so if urination and defecation (no I'm not joking) and boring chit chat are your thing you will love this, otherwise not worth it even if free(and we love Chinese  kung fu stuff and Donnie Yen's other movies--e.g., all the Ip Man's).",1442275200,,549,4.545454545454546

6463354,1,B00L29MR4A,"Wow, that was really bad.  I could only sit through around 30 minutes before giving up all hope.  The story was silly and thin, the characters were uninteresting and stereotypical, the intended comedy was banal, the supporting acting was poor, and special effects were sometimes subpar.  Some interesting fighting and choreography doesn't nearly make up for this being a total waste of time to watch.  And I swear I could see wires in some of those scenes...  Donnie, why?",1439856000,2,472,4.924050632911392

6463368,3,B00L29MR4A,"""Iceman"" has a fun, and yet intense story that begs for cool fight sequences choreographed flawlessly. I didn't totally get the grandeur that surrounds these figures-who obviously have mastered the teachings so well they have transcended into ""godhood"". However the scenes are so strong, with a balance of melodrama, humor and action. The story does capitalize on the expected components that make up modern action films from China, it almost mirrors the set up of Japanese anime series. The characters, although a bit clich, offer a collection of comic relief, romantic interlude, and tons of dramatic inflection. All in a blended cultures piece that brings the past into the present.

Overall ""Iceman"" is a decent action/fantasy film with plenty of fights and drama. I am not sure if it is truly a strong piece because some of the material didn't connect with me personally. I enjoyed watching this film but I have seen better films similar to this one come out of Hong Kong. Still the cinematography and production value is stellar. The flat areas for me are the humanizing scenes of character relationship/ dialog interaction moments that are intended to build up the characters so that they more personable dimension, but really just creates drag on the action and thrills a bit too much. Again  I liked ""Iceman"" but I am not sure if it will be strong enough for the die-hard Asian cinema fan.",1431475200,,1398,4.919491525423729

6463381,2,B00L29MR4A,"He Ying (Donnie Yen), a dutiful royal guard of the late Ming Dynasty, who has been frozen for 400 years, wakes up in the modern-day Hong Kong, and meets a young woman May (Huang Shengyi). But Hi Ying is not the only one who has travelled in time as several other warriors in period costumes are looking for him, eating chicken curry.

Hong Kong-Chinese film Iceman (Bing feng: Chong sheng zhi men) attempts to be both a martial arts action and culture clash comedy (and in 3D), but fails to be either of them, with a dull storyline, confusing flashbacks, subpar fight scenes, unfunny gags (including toilet jokes) and wasted supporting players including Simon Yam and Suet Lam.

I think I have seen many Donnie Yen films, but most probably this is the worst of his movies. Maybe Donnie Yen is trying to change his image. I understand, but this is not simply the right way to do.

I almost forgot to say one important thing. This is a remake of a 1989 Hong Kong film The Iceman Cometh (Ji dong ji xia) starring Biao Yuen. For the remake they decided to turn it into a two-part movie, and this is the first segment of it. The second part will be released in 2015.",1426550400,4,1161,4.41588785046729

The bad
The story is pretty bad. Too wacky to be serious. Some parts are too weird to be funny. Where one scene-a man uses his bathroom waste as a weapon on soldiers. Pretty weird right? Well most of the scenes in this movie are bizarre like this one example. Little of any fight scenes. The fights that are in the movie are good but too little in a martial arts movie. I believe there are 2 fights in this whole movie. The ending is also weak leaving in a be continued, instant cut off where you wouldnt think it would end.

6463384,3,B00L29MR4A,"As a huge fan of Donnie Yen I felt slightly disappointed with Iceman. The movie was ok, just not what I expected. The fights were ok & well done but they are far & few in between with the best being at the end. At times the movie seemed to drag a bit which is weird because once it ends it feels like it ended abruptly without almost any solid conclusion. Its like the director woke up & said ""today we end the film"" even though it feels like there was a bit more to be told or found out. Sometimes the story makes little sense & certain things are never fully explained or explored at all. I feel like it had the makings of being a very good film but somewhere along the line it just fell off. Characters were ok but with I feel the only ones that were trying to work with what they had were Donnie Yen & Simon Yam, the rest felt kinda off or bland.

6463407,5,B00L29MR4A,Great,1420156800,,5,5.0
6463408,2,B00L29MR4A,this is a decent movie.  However we have been ripped off once again. THIS movie was filmed in 3d I am tired of them NOT putting out 3d movies on 3d blu ray.  They suck for doing this to us.,1420156800,,189,3.7
6463409,5,B00L29MR4A,loved the movie,1420070400,,15,4.333333333333333
6463410,1,B00L29MR4A,Thought it was a serious IP man type movie. It was an inappropriate wannabe comedy,1419724800,,82,4.533333333333333

6463412,4,B00L29MR4A,"A rushed ending, leaving many aspects undone and making for an obvious setup for a sequel.",1419120000,,90,4.6875
6463413,2,B00L29MR4A,There is no plot.  The ending left me hanging!,1419120000,,46,4.111111111111111

6463417,5,B00L29MR4A,Liked the action performances,1418169600,,29,6.5
6463418,3,B00L29MR4A,OK.  Little too much humor.  Ending fight is nicely choreographed.  Unfortunately it ends abruptly so it can be continued in the sequel.,1418083200,,136,5.090909090909091
6463419,4,B00L29MR4A,"It's Donnie Yen, enough said right?  Well, I would have given it 5 stars but the ending is confusing. Ok I get that there's going to be a sequel but please give some meaning to the end of the movie. So, rather than the ending causing anticipation for the sequel, it had me wondering what the heck??

If you're expecting to see Donnie beating up the bad guys, think again. Donnie spends more time riding atop tour buses than fighting except the scene where he fights an old woman. Donnie, we know you're aging, but when your most strenuous fight scene is with an elderly lady, your coolness rating slips big time!

All in all it's a good movie for chuckles and light hearted fun.",1418083200,,678,4.408
6463420,5,B00L29MR4A,"I watched it for two days, meaning I couldn't get enough of it. Funny, and adventurous",1417910400,,86,4.4375
6463421,1,B00L29MR4A,Donnie Yen fans should be disappointed.  I was very disappointed,1417564800,,64,5.4
6463422,1,B00L29MR4A,"Aweful movie,  I love Donnie Yen and these type of movies but this one was garbage.  The plot made no sense, the writing was terrible, even the fights were nonsensical.  The movie just stops with no ending and I have zero interest in seeing a sequal.  Watch ANY other Donnie Yen movie and please skip this one.",1417219200,,310,4.385964912280702

6463424,1,B00L29MR4A,i wacthed most of Donnie Yen flicks and over the years they start to decipate in the quality of the plot....this one is a prime example of it.  wouldn't recommend it till it shows on tv....Donnie you can do better.,1416787200,,214,4.35
6463425,4,B00L29MR4A,"Bought the Chinese 3D, very disappointed with the quality of the picture.",1416787200,,73,5.166666666666667

8663383,5,B00L29MR4A,I really liked this movie. The past and present entertwining throughout the movie made it interesting. Lots of martial arts...my kind of movie. And lots of humor. I am hoping to see Iceman 2s release because the ending was a cliffhanger. This is 2018...this movie was released in 2014! PLEASE....release part 2! Thank you...,1530489600,,324,5.018518518518518
8663384,1,B00L29MR4A,"I liked that I was able to hear movie in English. The special effects and color were good also. I didn't like how there were so many plots, twists, and turns; that at the end I really didn't get what really happened! Ended as though there had to be a sequel to help it all make sense!",1526256000,,284,4.0
8663385,5,B00L29MR4A,I live and die for Kung Fu. Donnie is at his finest in this one.,1522195200,,64,3.3333333333333335
8663386,2,B00L29MR4A,"I have always loved Martial Arts movies.  I was recently introduced to Donnie Yen through the IP Man series and XXX.
Frankly, this movie tarnished his credibility.  His martial arts are always exciting to watch and the storyline was interesting too...except for the ending (Spoiler Alert).  There's a huge backstory which takes some time to explain, a good vs. bad element as always, and lots of fighting, building up to the climax of the movie...then POOF it ends.  What the heck?  I understand that they're making a sequel, but the ending was so stupid that I really don't want to see the 2nd.  Sorry Donnie...this was a bust.",1519171200,,628,4.768518518518518

8663389,3,B00L29MR4A,I bought the movie at Walmart and I did like it....they need to do an Iceman II....it felt like a cliffhanger near the end of the movie....there were some funny spots and I am a big fan of Donnie Yen from the Ip Man movies.,1499558400,,223,3.977777777777778
8663390,5,B00L29MR4A,"The movie is great. Definitely what I was expecting. Donny yen is a good actor, good supporting cast. This like a lot of Asian movies doesn't and don't get the press or leeway a movie from Hollywood does. If you are a fan of action movies with stories you will like this movie. Just remember that this movie crosses nearly all style of movie",1496966400,,341,4.34375
8663391,5,B00L29MR4A,Excellent movie.,1494460800,,16,7.5
8663392,2,B00L29MR4A,"I'm a big Donnie Yen fan, love his work, but this was a confusing, mess of a film. The cover art is amazing but the film can't decide if its historical, slapstick, fantasy, martial arts..... and then it just ends. I spent much of the film trying to figure out if the female lead was a hooker or just dumb. The film's producer in the bonus features spoke about how this was a breakout role for a female actress-- which is just sad. If you haven't seen IP Man (1 through 3) watch that instead, or Bodyguards and Assassins, Flashpoint, etc....any other Donnie Yen film- just not this one :-(",1489449600,,588,4.3545454545454545
