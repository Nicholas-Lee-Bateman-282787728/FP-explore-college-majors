3146130,3,B0015OKWL2,"I had forgotten just how charming Al Pacino could be and how powerfully convincing both he and Robert DeNiro are as actors.  That said, neither of them did much but to essentially play themselves in the film.  Righteous Kill was an interesting story with a twist that was fairly predicatable.  I doubt highly that unknowns could have carried the script.  John Leguizamo and Donnie Walhberg added a freshness that helps to round out the overall feel of the movie.

This movie is worth seeing mostly because its always fun to see two heavy weights together, however I went during peak movie times and paid regular price and I wish I had gone during a matinee.  Go see it... just don't expect a mindblowing experience.",1221350400,,715,4.725806451612903
3146131,2,B0015OKWL2,"There are films that the critics pan but the people love. This isn't one of them. There are movies with trailers that so effectively summarize a weak story that there isn't much point in watching the film. This is one of those movies. The trailer hit every high point. The trailer got me to the show. If only the movie had been constructed so skillfully...

Robert De Niro and Al Pacino play two grizzled veteran (""thirty plus years"") NYPD detectives who are investigating a series of vigilante-style killings of ""low lifes"" who escaped justice. The meandering trail may lead to a rogue cop.

The story soon gets confusing. I lost interest. But De Niro and Pacino do not disappoint. They demonstrate that the fire is still burning. They perform with power and conviction. The audience was clearly pulling for them. Occasionally the two (mostly Pacino) had a funny line, and the audience responded with enthusiasm. Unfortunately, there were only a few such moments.

There just wasn't much for the cast to work with. This isn't Heat, the 1995 classic in which the two starred. This is Heat on Ice.

I'll give it two stars for the two stars.",1221350400,,1139,4.737373737373737
3146132,3,B0015OKWL2,"""Righteous Kill"" draws the audience deep into a mystery that, in reality, isn't all that mysterious. While I can't say I predicted the big revelation at the end, I can say that I didn't find it too surprising, given the overtly misdirecting nature of the plot. Far be it from me to get way ahead of myself, but the truth is that the filmmakers want us to notice the mystery more than the characters, the story, or the even the setting. They took great pains to tease us with hidden messages, subtle clues, and clever camera angles that hide things from view; in the end, we're given an appropriate yet strangely unsatisfying plot twist, one that resolves the story but somehow doesn't do it justice. As for Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, they made the most of what they were given, meaning their performances were decent at best, complacent at worst. It's quite possible both are too good for a film like this.

This isn't to say that ""Righteous Kill"" is a gigantic miscalculation. Actually, it held my interest all the way through, despite the plot being very uneven at times. It tells the story of two veteran NYPD detectives--David ""Turk"" Fisk (De Niro) and Thomas ""Rooster"" Cowan (Pacino)--who aren't ready to retire, despite being partners on the force for over thirty years. They're sent to investigate the murder of a pimp, which, strangely enough, seems connected to a case they ""solved"" four years earlier, one involving a man suspected of murdering his girlfriend's young daughter. In this new case, the pimp was murdered even though he was only a suspect. Pretty soon, more people are found dead, each of them suspected of some heinous crime. Clearly, the NYPD has a vigilante on their hands, and what's worse, all signs point to this mysterious person being a cop. But who is it? And why is he or she leaving handwritten poems at every scene?

I don't think I can describe anymore of the plot without being annoyingly vague. Let's just say that what we're led to believe isn't necessarily what we should believe. All good mysteries work this way, and up to a point, ""Righteous Kill"" does a good job misleading the audience. Unfortunately, the ending wasn't everything it could have been. Even though the plot twist made sense within the context of the story, it wasn't the bombshell I had been expecting. To be fair, I'm well aware that some plot twists are too shocking for their own good; films like ""The Village"" and ""Hancock"" and ""Awake"" made revelations that, in my opinion, were over the top. It's one of those situations where you need perfect middle ground--not too weak, but not too strong, either.

It doesn't help that the performances were merely fair. Both De Niro and Pacino seem a little too comfortable in their roles, a little too relaxed given the material. Part of that can be blamed on the mindsets of their characters, both so numb after thirty years in the NYPD. But even then something feels incomplete. The tension between them and two suspicious detectives--Simon Perez (John Leguizamo) and Ted Riley (Donnie Wahlberg)--never feels as palpable as it should, and this is bad because they continuously antagonize Turk and Rooster. Their scenes feel restrained and underdeveloped, as if the actors were indifferent about their roles. This indifference is most noticeable in surveillance footage of Turk, which appears intermittently throughout the film; while I can't reveal why this footage is being shown, I can say that it features dialogue so clich, it's as if De Niro wasn't taking it seriously. Example: ""Most people respect the badge. Everyone respects the gun."" Another example, one that pretty much tells us the same thing: ""You don't become a cop to serve and protect. You do it because they let you carry a gun and a badge. You do it because you get respect.""

One of the better performances came from Carla Gugino. She plays Karen Corelli, who sleeps with Turk on a regular basis and demands to be treated roughly every time. There's a moment when she pressures Rooster for details about Turk beating up a suspect. Rooster, deciding to have a little fun, embellishes the story with outlandish descriptions, all of which Carla enjoys hearing. She felt the most genuine of all the characters in ""Righteous Kill."" At times, she's highly assertive, while at other times, she's greatly fearful. She, like most of the characters, tries to make sense of the situation as best she can, which to me seemed authentic. While hardly an extraneous character, it probably would have been a good idea to give her more screen time.

As for everyone else, it would have been a good idea for screenwriter Russell Gewirtz and director Jon Avnet to develop them a bit more. ""Righteous Kill"" is hardly a terrible movie, but at the same time, it's hardly a good one. It quickly sucks the audience into a mystery that keeps building, and then it spits it out as soon as the mystery is solved. There's no sense of satisfaction leaving the theater; there's only a sense of apathy. What a shame the twist ending failed to be so surprising. What an even bigger shame that Robert De Niro and Al Pacino seemed so blas about their performances. Both are wonderful actors, so I'm not inclined to blame them for holding back when they shouldn't have. I'm much more inclined to blame the filmmakers, not only for steering them in the wrong direction, but also for crafting a lackluster story with a less than impressive plot twist. Clearly, I'm having trouble getting over it.",1221350400,,5488,4.784810126582278
3146133,3,B0015OKWL2,"Righteous Kill is only the second pairing of two of cinema's greatest actors - Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. Their first on-screen collaboration, only featured them together in a couple of scenes, and left the public wanting more.

Righteous Kill has them playing NYC detective partners who've been on the job for 30 years. A serial killer start killing criminals who gotten off on technicalities. Soon, all the evidence points to the killer being a cop. And the cop would seem to be De Niro's character, Turk, a rough-edged type who isn't above falsifying evidence to convict suspects. He's balanced out by Pacino's Rooster, a calm, soothing influence on Turk in a relationship that seems as much like a marriage as it does a professional partnership. Added to the mix are John Leguizamo and Donnie Wahlberg as younger cops investigating the killings and Carlo Gugino as a forensic specialist in a relationship with DeNiro.

The movie works well as a police drama, less so as a mystery, although the solution of the killings does take some interesting turns. If two lesser actors were playing Turk and Rooster, the film might have been touted as asking interesting questions about the nature of friendships, partnerships, and romantic relationship amid all the stresses and strains of police work. But with De Niro and Pacino in tow, the viewer expects more, and doesn't necessarily get it with this film.

However, the two greats still know how to pull off great performance, and know how to elicit sympathy, affection, and every other possible emotion from an audience. Righteous Kill isn't a complete misfire, but might require a third teaming of these great actors.",1221264000,2,1670,4.978494623655914
3146134,3,B0015OKWL2,"This was a pretty good cop film. Turk and Rooster have been partners for 30 years, then some killings happen in the same way a killer had done a few years back and Turk and Rooster stopped him. Now, they must figure out if it's a serial killer, or a cop turned dirty. If you like cop dramas, Al Pacino, and Robert De Niro, you'll like RIGHTEOUS KILL!!!",1221264000,,352,4.1911764705882355
3146135,2,B0015OKWL2,"This film was entirely unsatisfying from beginning to end. An awesome cast from top to bottom (except for 50 Cent) but just a weak, predictable story with no delivery to speak of.

I hate saying this about a movie with two legendary and, more often than not, specatacular actors but 20 minutes into the movie I was looking at my watch waiting for it to be over. Less than 40 minutes into the movie I had the whole plot ""twist"" figured out which says something because I'm normally somewhat dull-whitted when it comes to crime solving shows. Let's just say they didn't make it difficult to solve this one.

The lovely and talented Carla Gugino plays the love/sex interest of DeNiro with some pretty strange likings (of which no explaintions are ever offered). It's almost like her role in the movie was an afterthought.

Also, who the @#$% told 50 Cent that he could act??????????? I almost got up and walked out of the movie house as soon as his worthless @$$ showed on screen.

This one gets two instead of one only because DeNiro & Pacino were in the same film. I wish they would've wasted the script on lesser talent because this piece of crap is gonna rake in the dough just because of the marquis.

Don't even waste a Netflix rental on this film. Get a good crime mystery like ""The Usual Suspects"".",1221264000,,1303,4.504237288135593

3146172,4,B0015OKWL2,"""Righteous Kill"" hasn't been all that well-received -- Rotten Tomatoes is down on it -- but it seems to me at least as good as two other movies I've seen lately that were better received: ""Stand-Up Guys"" and ""The Departed.""  I liked the latter, but it was a bit bloated, and one wonders whether Scorsese's name got it more credit that it deserved.  ""Stand-Up Guys"" was quirkier, but gave Al Pacino a bit more opportunity to chew the scenery.  In all three, though, I wouldn't fault the acting -- such problems as there are are more with script and pacing, and I actually quite enjoyed all three.  ""Righteous Kill"" is very strongly cast, with Pacino, De Niro, Leguizamo, Donnie Wahlberg, Dennehy, Curtis Jackson (aka 50 Cent), and Carla Gugino.  All of them do good work.  The plot is very clever, and the mode of narration, which is a complicated form of flashback, is well-handled.  The limitations of the movie are the limitations of the genre, which as some reviewers have commented, aren't all that different from the limitations of, say, ""Law and Order"" episodes, but ""L&A"" was a solid show, and so is this.  Also, it comes in at well under two hours, and packs a lot of incident into that time frame.

The plot is clever, and I want to avoid spoilers, so I'll say no more than that it's a serial-killer search movie and that it puts a lot of weight on conflicts within a police department, where two different teams of cops (Pacino/De Niro and Leguizamo/Wahlberg) are working aspects of the same case (or cases, given that serial killing is the issue) and taking different views of the case.  Brian Dennehy is underused as their boss, and Carla Gugino is a forensics detective with whom they all interact and who is in many ways the most interesting character in the movie.  What makes her interesting becomes clear quite early, but I won't spoil your discovery of it in case you haven't seen the movie yet.

I wonder if some of the disappointment in the movie has to do with seeing De Niro and Pacino together (for the first time, really, for they hardly interacted in ""Heat"") in a movie that is pretty generic.  Both have played in cop-thrillers before, and while they are given some personality quirks in the script that individualize them reasonably interestingly, these roles are hardly a stretch for either of them.  That said, they are very effective.  Neither one seems to be ""dialing it in,"" so there's real pleasure in seeing two old pros going at it -- a bit like the pleasure of seeing Alan Arkin, Pacino, and Walken in ""Stand-Up Guys.""  Yes, it would be nice to see ""King Lear"" with De Niro and Pacino as Lear and Gloster -- certainly a better script and more room to dig into character there -- but that's not going to happen, so we take what we can get and enjoy it for what it is.  Pacino's natural flamboyance is still there but well subordinated to the demands of characterization, and older De Niro's taciturnity is likewise familiar and yet given a twist.  All in all, it's not a great movie, but it's very far from a disaster.",1422144000,,3053,4.580882352941177

3146202,5,B0015OKWL2,"""Righteous Kill"" is great! This is how the story goes: A pair of veteran New York City police detectives are on the trail of a vigilante serial killer. After 30 years as partners in the pressure cooker environment of the NYPD, highly decorated Detectives David 'Rooster' Fisk and Thomas 'Turk' Cowan should be ready for retirement, but aren't. Before they can hang up their badges, they are called in to investigate the murder of a notorious pimp, which appears to have ties to a case they solved years before. Like the original murder, the victim is a suspected criminal whose body is found accompanied by a four line poem justifying the killing. When additional crimes take place, it becomes clear the detectives are looking for a serial killer, one who targets criminals that have fallen through the cracks of the judicial system. His mission is to do what the cops can't do on their own--take the culprits off the streets for good. The similarities between the recent killings and their earlier case raise a nagging question: Did they put the wrong man behind bars?

The cast led by Robert De Niro (as Turk) & Al Pacino (as Rooster) is excellent! The directing by Jon Avnet (who has produced movies, such as, ""Risky Business"" (1983), and directed and also produced movies, such as, ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" (1991), and most recently, did ""88 Minutes"" (2008, which also starred Pacino) is excellent! The story and screenplay by Russell Gewirtz (who also wrote ""Inside Man"" (2006) & its possible upcoming sequel in 2010) is excellent!

The music by Ed Shearmur (who also did the music to the upcoming ""Passengers"" (2008) and the recent ""88 Minutes"") is excellent! The cinematography by Denis Lenoir (who also did the cinematography to ""88 Minutes"") is excellent! The film editing by Paul Hirsch (who won the Oscar for his work in ""Ray"" (2004) is excellent! The casting by Nancy Klopper (who also did the casting to ""Risky Business"") is excellent! The production design by Tracey Gallacher (who also did the production design to ""88 Minutes"") is excellent! The art direction by Christina Ann Wilson (who is doing the art direction to the upcoming ""Shutter Island"" (2009) & ""Alice In Wonderland"" (2010) is excellent! The set decoration by Kathy Lucas (who is doing the set decoration to the upcoming ""The Ugly Truth"" (2009) is excellent! The costume design by Debra McGuire (who also did the costume design to ""Redbelt"" (2008), and was also Pacino's wardrobe designer on ""88 Minutes"") is excellent!

This is an excellent action-thriller that keeps you thinking and on the edge of your seat. This is an excellent reunion for De Niro and Pacino, 13 years since ""Heat"" (1995). Their roles in this movie couldn't be any different than they were in ""Heat"".",1369526400,,2749,4.894849785407725

Working again with Pacino and with the special added bonus teaming Pacino and De Niro again for the first time since Michael Mann's 1992 crime thriller, Heat. The two play disenchanted, seasoned police detectives who are all too familiar with the fact that violent criminals they worked so hard to nail are allowed to go free. Both men are enraged by this. The character De Niro plays allows his brute anger to show outwardly, while Pacino's character(Rooster) Keeps the same feelings inside and calmly deals with it as best he can. Then things come to a head when a child killer is also allowed to go free because of a legal technicality, the two men frame the ""Mutt"" for a crime he didn't commit. During this ""crossing the line"" choice they make the two are assigned to investigate a series of vigilante murders, the targets whom are some of these scum bags that were allowed to go free. Upon seeing the first victim of the killer at the crime scene, Rooster can't help but comment concerning the killer, ""They should give the guy a medal"". Their investigations lead them to discover that the person responsible for the killings may be a cop. But this doesn't matter to the audience because from the very begining, the movie tells us who the killer is. None the less despite that there is a surprise ending that will knock your socks off. This film is well made and hardly resembles the very bad 88 minutes John Avnet directed just before this one. This film is not a great picture but it is a pretty damned good one. One side note though. I did feel that John Leguizamo, a very good actor who has had much bigger parts was under-used in this film. All in all Pacino, De Niro, Leguizamo, Dennehy, and Wahlberg were all great. And this film is good enough to be considered a very good but not righteous movie.",1368144000,,1971,4.634285714285714

3146224,3,B0015OKWL2,"`Righteous Kill' is a pretty formulaic and sedate thriller starring two giants of cinema whose talents are sorely underused. Following some NYPD detectives who are tracking down a vigilante cop this film has very few surprises and you can guess the ending from about twenty minutes in. The acting is ok, but not great and although both De Niro and Pacino are legendary actors, they always feels a bit stilted and lacking of any conviction in this film. The storyline is sadly unoriginal and without any great shocks or twists, but it does keep you engaged for the 90 minutes duration. Any longer and you'd get restless though. For all it's flaws this film is not that bad overall and when you want an easy evenings viewing, where you don't have to think too hard, then this is a pretty good place to go.

In the special features they keep referring to Deniro and Pacino as 'icons' of acting--and they are and deservedly so. But great actors can't do anything about a bad script and being cast in parts they should no longer take on. Deniro has crossed over into comedy (Analyze This) and has been hilarious.

3146230,3,B0015OKWL2,"I had really high hopes for this film, and that may be why I was ultimately disappointed.  Pacino and De Niro are iconic actors, and their performances here are top notch - for what they had to work with.  The film's writer says in the extras, ""I decide upon the twist and then build the movie backward from there"" and that sums up my problem with the movie.  The twist was predictable, and there wasn't enough substance beyond that to take it to the next level.  The entire story is a set-up for the twist, and the pacing of the film is very slow.

Someone is killing bad guys; the trailers and opening let the viewer know it's either Pacino or De Niro. The film jumps from one vigilante killing to the next, showing how the partners were involved or knew the ""victims.""  There was a bit of surprise in the fall out (not who did it, but the why and what happens next) once the vigilante is revealed, but not enough for all the build-up.  Still, I gave it three stars because these two actors, and many fine supporting ones, are riveting to watch.  Pacino and De Niro are perfectly cast as jaded cops who keep doing the job because it's all they are made to do.  They have that certain quality that made Jerry Orbach so beloved on Law & Order.  Despite them being so famous, I still became lost in their roles. I knew who the killer was, and I kept watching to the end to see what these two would do with that knowledge.  Overall, this was a good drama but it could have been classic.  Recommended for fans of cop dramas, or of Pacino and De Niro.

The DVD has two featurettes, and a commentary.  One featurette is a making of, and well worth watching.  I particularly liked how the cast and crew were so in awe of working with the two heavy weight stars.  Nice to know audiences aren't the only ones star-struck! The other is a kind of documentary on ""bad"" cops, but I found it very biased and quite negative.  They were stretching trying to tie it into the film and it showed.  Overall, decent extras for a single disc edition.",1282521600,,2029,4.308707124010554
3146231,2,B0015OKWL2,"Robert De Niro and Al Pacino are in one movie. You know, much awaited team-up of two legendary actors should be big news for many movie fans, and, actually, it was when Michael Mann made very intense thriller ""Heat"" back in 1995, even though they are together on screen only in one scene. (The two actors were both in ""The Godfather Part II,"" but they didn't share a scene.) Now I finally saw ""Righteous Kill"" starring Robert De Niro and Al Pacino (credited that order), and though their acting is worth the price for DVD, the film itself turned out disappointing to me.

For ""Righteous Kill"" is not really successful as a thriller, or anything else. In this crime thriller directed by Jon Avnet (""Fried Green Tomatoes"" ""88 Minutes""), Robert De Niro and Al Pacino play hot-tempered ""Turk"" and cool ""Rooster"" respectively, two veteran NYPD detectives. There is a vigilante-type serial killer at large, leaving a poem at the crime scenes. To investigate the murder cases Turk and Rooter have to work with Simon Perez (John Leguizamo) and Ted Riley (Donnie Wahlberg), a team of younger detectives, whom the veteran detectives seem to dislike.

From the very outset Jon Avnet's storytelling falters, partly because he fails to provide a viewpoint from which audiences can follow the plot in a logical way. ""Righteous Kill"" suffers from the muddled storyline, thinly developed characters (script by Russell Gewirtz of ""Inside Man"" fame), and its clumsily paced narrative. Yes, there are twists and turns along the way, but most audiences would lose interest by the time they reach the conclusion.

In addition to the two stars, obviously the best assets of the film, ""Righteous Kill"" has interesting cast including Curtis Jackson, Brian Dennehy, Carla Gugino, Trilby Glover and Melissa Leo. Sadly they are all wasted. After all this film is helmed by the director who did incredibly bad thriller ""88 Minutes."" As to the much-anticipated team-up of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, I strongly recommend you watch ""Heat"" again and forget anything about this one.",1276387200,,2052,4.994152046783626
3146232,2,B0015OKWL2,"That's the sound of my hopes and expectations deflating.  Not to say that RIGHTEOUS KILL is a complete and utter disappointment (I guess it was worth borrowing for free from my local library), but I can't help but feel that it could have been so much more.

One look at the cast and you have to think, ""How can this be a miss?""  I mean, they could have just named this film ""DeNiro & Pacino"" and it probably would have done better at the box office.  Throw in the bonus talents of John Leguizamo, Donnie Wahlberg, and the normally riveting Brian Dennehy and you should have sure-fire cinematic gold, right?

By and large, the talents of the actors listed above are not fleshed out in any compelling fashion.  I lay this squarely at the feet of director Jon Avnet, who somehow compiled a stellar cast and was unable to coax much emotion out of any of them.  They pretty much sleepwalk and mumble through the scenes, and the ""live-wire"" ones are devoid of passion even as the actors are shouting at each other.  I was largely unmoved by the characters and found myself growing annoyed by the near constant saturation of nearly every paragraph with the F-bomb with nothing to back it up.  I was especially disappointed by the passionless performance of Dennehy, whose trademark sneer and undulating fury have been substituted with a smirk and mild annoyance - a truly wasted opportunity to crank up the temperature on a potential potboiler.

The script didn't help Avnet's cause, either.  Truly bizarre character relationships (a coroner and detective who work together have a largely emotionless but physically rough sexual affair that adds absolutely no intrigue or interest to the story) and out of place characters (Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson's scenes seemed to be only an excuse to get him on screen) only muddy the already strained performances.  The back cover quotes Larry King as saying the film has ""a twist at the end that will blow you away.""  Larry King must not watch too many movies these days, as most seasoned viewers should have it figured out with 30-40 minutes to go.

The DVD includes a couple of approximately 15 minute featurettes that were mildly interesting.  ""The Thin Blue Line: An Exploration of Cops & Criminals"" is produced just like something off Court TV, and could easily have been expanded to an hour (or heck, a series).  Unfortunately, it too falls short.  Literally.

In good conscience, I can only recommend this film to hard-core fans of the cop-film genre.  DeNiro and Pacino fans will find far better performances elsewhere.

Actually, Cugino is so strong in this role, I'm convinced she should have played Pacino's part! Although the character she did play is pivotal to the plot resolution, it still is one which strains credulity: a Cop who loves to bed Cops and other guys who perform dangerous tasks. It would have been more interesting if she played a kind of recovering ""call girl"" who tries *not* to fall in love with her favorite client.

3146238,4,B0015OKWL2,"De Niro and Pacino don't disappoint as a pair of hardened, slightly ""off-kilter"" cops with DeNiro, in particular, appearing to be a head case, a character whose interest in police work, it's strongly implied, is directly traceable to a strong, explosive, sado-masochistic strain in his relation not just to the bad guys but to authority and women.  The problem with the film is the length to which it goes (""whatever it takes"") to hook the viewer and keep him snapping at the bait.

All films are manipulative, but problems arise when the manipulation is totally contrary to the viewer's expectations and trust.  It's one thing to see a sci-fi space fantasy in 3-D (in which case, I say ""make me a passenger on your psychedelic roller coaster--sweep me into some other world or orbit""), but it's quite another to confront what is represented as a ""realistic"" police drama, purporting, moreover, to take us into the psyches of the main characters.  In this latter case, we as viewers have no choice but to invest our trust in the director and his devices--above all in the accuracy of the fictive world along with the boundaries and signposts that have been established as standards of judgment,  enabling the viewer to make sense of the characters and the ""reality"" they function in.  Unfortunately, in the case of ""Righteous Kill"" that trust is totally violated.

 When a film opens with a character giving a testimony, as if under oath, then that same character necessarily comes to serve as our sole reference for the reliability, or ""verisimilitude,"" of the world of the film.  He becomes our eyes, our standard of reference, our ""point of view"" in place of the objective camera lens.  If at the end of the film, that character suddenly tells us that he's lied to us from the first frame, we may not exactly have cause to ask for a refund (all great fiction amounts to a ""lie that tells the truth""), but we do have a right to feel, if not betrayed, a trifled disappointed and irritated.  Imagine Jane Austen saving the last sentence of ""Pride and Prejudice"" for a statement such as: ""By the way, everything I've just written about Elizabeth Bennett in the foregoing 300 pages is a complete lie.  She's a horrible person who can be expected to behave toward Darcy as Lady Macbeth did to Macbeth.""

Manipulation is one thing (Wayne Booth, a former teacher of mine, calls it the ""rhetoric of fiction""), but outright deception feels less like influencing or even tricking the witness (i.e. you and me) than plain and simple ""cheating.""  In a good movie (Hitchcock is always a reliable example) the director and the viewer are engaged in a game, or even a contest, the spectator getting many of his kicks from trying to stay a step ahead of the director.  It can be fun, even exhilarating, entertainment--you win a few, you lose a few.  But say the director--for example, Billy Wilder at the end of ""Double Indemnity""--suddenly reveals that everything you've heard from Fred MacMurray is the exact opposite of the story you ""thought"" you had just heard.  That's not mere ""manipulation"": that's substituting another movie for the one you've just seen!  (Reminds me of Humphrey Bogart and the ""African Queen"" making a brief appearance in the desert in Bing Crosby-Bob Hope's ""Road to Bali.""  But in that instance, our expectations have been conditioned to accept such absurdities. In the case of ""Righteous Kill,"" I wasn't adequately prepared to expect the same sorts of absurdities.  You might even say that the ""righteous"" one is the director, who self-servingly abuses his authority (or ""author""-ship) in what amounts to a regrettable ""breach of trust"" from the viewer's point of view.

Why 4 stars?  Frankly, I'm not sure (you're free to go much lower, or even higher).  The film did hold my interest, and it had me guessing throughout, with some juicy Hitchcock-worthy red herrings (until the very end, when I felt like I'd been watching the wrong movie).  Moreover, Deniro and Pacino are great actors individually and collectively, and both are on their game; both ""age well"" and, if the script deserves some blame, it should not be at the expense of the actors.  Finally, I would rather be lied to by an otherwise intelligent movie than patronized and insulted. Too many movies are formulaic commodities designed, with Pavolian, formulaic, marketplace certainty, to empty the consumer's wallet.  ""Righteous Kill"" never stoops that low.

Finally, one of the respected, ""classic"" films of all time--hated by the Marxist director Eisenstein but practically serving as the prototype of German psychoanalytic cinema--is ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.""  It pulls much the same trick as ""Righteous Kill,"" waiting until the film's final moment to reveal that the film's narrator, in whom we as spectators have necessarily placed our trust, is in fact a mad man in an insane asylum.  What's the difference?  Is there a difference?  For one thing, whereas Caligari gives us an apparently sane narrator who proves a lunatic, ""Righteous Kill"" gives us an apparently semi-pathological narrator who, ultimately, proves an ""all right"" kind of guy.

Perhaps the main difference is that ""Caligari"" has a message about an insane, paranoid, totalitarian world: it's use of the deceptive narrator is integral with, if not crucial to, that message.  The film seems to want us to recognize the wolf in sheep's clothing or, in this instance, the pending Hitler who at first seems so seductively rational.  ""Righteous Kill,"" on the other hand, has no such message--or, if one insists, the film says no more than ""guys who seem sinister, tough or plain nasty can turn out O.K. if you wait until the end of the movie.""  Similar, perhaps, to ""Caligari"" but not quite the same--and not quite enough.",1262908800,,5774,4.929752066115703

Yes, DeNiro has seemingly played this role 1,000 times before, but Pacino's character has a bit more originality. Both are jaded NYPD vets, but still with a few good days left in them. The bad guys, except for 50 Cent, are all pretty forgettable. And though Brian Dennehy plays the cop boss, he isn't given much to do. The movie is all about DeNiro and Pacino.

DeNiro and Pacino are both cops, both veterans (well, they'd have to be wouldn't they...) who end up investigating a vigilante serial killer.  As the clues start to appear, suspicion grows that the killer is in fact a cop.. so who can be trusted, and just who is telling the truth...?
Well, that's the set up, but it's great potential is somehow fumbled.  The tag line of `the two best actors alive at the top of their game' is certainly somewhat overstated, but the fault does not lie there - rather it is in a weak story directed in such a straight forward way that red herrings are just rather too obvious.  It's really not that bad, and has its own stylistic flourishings along the way - however it is also not half as clever as it seems to think it is, and the ending is unlikely to surprise anyone.  Fortunately it is only 97 minutes so does not overstay its welcome too long.. certainly bearable for an undemanding watch, but when you factor in the disappointment factor of having two such great stars so sorely underused, this would come down a notch to a two star movie...",1258675200,,1358,4.459677419354839
3146243,3,B0015OKWL2,"With two screen legends, RIGHTEOUS KILL is like watching Ali and Frazier take each other on, long after their prime.  Deniro is no longer the man he was in Raging Bull and Cape Fear, while Pacino holds steady in another grizzled veteran role.  The missed opportunity here was to not give these two men more unique and dynamic roles - they had to be of all things, casted as old cops - which isn't so challenging.  They both wear the role well, but you sense they're doing it easily in spite of the movie's twists.

Their previous pairing HEAT had only one scene with the two greats, but was a lot more exciting.  Less thriller and more a character study, RIGHTEOUS KILL is watchable, but it doesn't raise your adrenaline.  It's like watching the cops go toe-to-toe but never quite landing that KO punch.

The casting is strong, but with so many strong cop shows these days - there's no point in making these guys product.  Deniro and Pacino can offer so much more - if you challenge them.  That's what the studios should do.  I'm hoping their next time out won't be a Walter Mattheau and Jack Lemmon kind of pairing.

RIGHTEOUS KILL isn't bad.  It just isn't great.  But it does give fans a chance to see two actors tango together which I believe was partly the point.",1258416000,2,1268,4.460869565217391

~ Look what they've done to your song.""

Alas, Al Pacino *was* a great actor.  This man (ecco homo!) this man was, at one time, The Prince of the City -- New York *and* Hollywood!

Lemme tell ya a story ...

There was this kid I grew up with.  He was younger than me.  Sorta looked up to me.  You know, short guy.  We did our first work together; worked our way out of the street.  Things were good, we made the most of it.  During the 60s we schtupped Tuesday Weld.  Me first, then Al.

The 70s, we ran tye-dye shirts into Canada.  Made a fortune.  Mr. Pacino, his father, too.

As much as anyone, I loved him; and trusted him.  (About as far as I could throw the Empire State Building.  But that's another story.)

Later on he had an idea.  To build a theatre out of paper mache and put on productions like ""Richard the Third Gets a Hickey."" ... ""A Streetcar Named Shecky"" ... ""The Merchant of Venice Goes to the Catskills On His Way to the West Coast, The Clueless Schmuck.""

And that kid's name was Al Pacino.  And the theatre he founded here in New York City was the Max Bialystock Vernal Equinox Gardens.

This was a great wop.  A paisan of vision and guts, and there isn't even a plaque, or a signpost or a statue of him in this town!

Someone put an Ex-Lax in his gabaghoul sandwich. (Crapped for weeks.)  No one knows who placed the order.  When I heard about it, I wasn't angry.  True, I laughed my ass off.  But I wasn't angry.

I knew Al, I knew he was head-strong; I knew over the years he had built up a tolerance to laxatives: farting loud, saying stupid flatulent things.  So when he turned up with an overflowing enema bag (tic), I let it go.  And I said to myself (tic): this is the show biz-a-niece we Italians have chosen.  I didn't ask (tic) ""Who placed the gabaghoul order?"" because it had nothing to do (tic) with biz-a-niece!

Now I'm going in to take a nap.  I had a peppers and sausheech sandwich that's laying right here, like a rock.  When I wake, if Tuesday Weld in on the table ready to go, I'll know my prostate has a chance.  If not, I'll know I don't.",1257897600,,2318,4.080357142857143

3146249,4,B0015OKWL2,"Before I saw this thriller, I kept hearing many mixed reviews about it. From James Berardinelli to [...], most found it very average. I finally got a chance to watch this Righteous Kill, but with very moderate expectations. After the film was over, I found myself liking it. Not loving it, but liking it. It wasn't great, but it wasn't terrible, either. It was . . . between average and above average.

I think I'll start with the bad. I'm not a fan of Curtis Jackson (50 Cent), so I knew right away that his acting was wooden and dull. He doesn't even say most of his lines right; it sounds a bit like gibberish to me. Now, if Christopher Bridges (LUDA!) played Jackson's part, then it would have been far more engaging. Also, throughout the film, there are numerous cliches that we've all seen before (good cop bad cop, for example). If there was even a hint of originality, I would have given it a higher rating. The third flaw we have here is the plot twist. We already know that Turk (played by De Niro) is not the killer, so the major twist at the end wasn't shocking enough. Then, we have the script, which isn't really Grade A material. Some of the dialogue was pretty cheesy, and some scenes felt very uneven. And lastly, the sex scenes . . . they were very out-of-place and very unnecessary.

Now, here's the good. First we have De Niro and Pacino. I mean, DE NIRO & PACINO! In the classic film Heat, they were only onscreen together for about ten minutes. Here, these two guys share the screen almost throughout the movie. And although, as I mentioned before, the script is pretty average, De Niro and Pacino deliver their lines very well. The supporting cast (Dennehy, Wahlberg, Gugino, and Leguizamo) do a very fine job as well. Finally, there are a bit of references to Heat that can be found here, and while they are a bit too obvious, they're mildly decent at best.

Again, this is a thriller that's not great and not horrible. I give it a B- because, even though there were some crappy moments, it's still fun to watch Pacino and De Niro interact with each other. Jon Avnet is a good director, but he could have given a lot of things here some improvement. I hope he gets to make far more sophisticated films in the future.",1252886400,,2240,4.432038834951456

3146256,3,B0015OKWL2,"Actors of the stature of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino deserve to have the best offered to them. Unfortunately it seems that actors in their age bracket rarely receive those phone calls. Instead they are offered roles that are decent enough but nowhere near those they played before, roles that helped them gain the notoriety that they now enjoy. Such is the case with RIGHTEOUS KILL.

De Niro and Pacino play NYPD detectives Tom ""Turk"" Cowan and David ""Rooster"" Fisk. As the film opens we see what is apparently a confession by Cowan to the murder of 14 victims beginning 4 years prior. From there the film moves into flashback mode and the tale unfolds.

At that time a suspect in a murder case is released due to insufficient evidence. Everyone knows he did it, but he still gets off. In an attempt to see justice done, Fisk plants a gun taken from evidence in the suspect's bedroom while Cowan at first attempts to stop him then lets it happen. This results in the suspect being arrested and convicted of a murder he did not commit, but at least justice is done, right?

Moving forward to just weeks before the film's opening sequence, the duo is staking out a club run by an up and coming rap artists named Spider. Witnessing a woman named Jessica using cocaine in the club, the pair plan on running a sting operation to take Spider and his drugs off the street. With the help of their less than willing witness, they plant a listening device on her and send her in to set up Spider. But Spider realizes what is happening and with the possible threat of violence, the pair breaks in to stop him. Caught in their own bit of entrapment, a shoot out follows and Jessica is shot as is Spider's bodyguard.

The case is blown. Procedure was not followed and an arrest, let alone a conviction, is not about to happen in the foreseeable future. Spider walks.

As the film progresses, various other cases come to the attention of Cowan and Fisk. At each one a poem is left with the body. It seems they have a vigilante serial killer on the loose and he's taking out various suspects who were let off from the crimes they committed due to technicalities. As they look deeper into the case, both men come to the conclusion that the perpetrator to the crime could be someone who works on the police force.

With few leads to follow and never knowing who to trust, the pair continue their investigation. The only people they feel they can trust are each other. But after hours drinks and a few secrets let lose make both men realize that the other is not quite who they thought them to be. Fisk always looked up to Cowan as his hero, his inspiration. And Cowan always thought of Fisk as a stand up guy he could count on. Both men end the film in disappointment.

As the culmination of their investigation comes to a close, the setting drops back to Spider's club. With Spider in the mix as well as the gun toting thugs he hires to protect him, you can be sure a shooting is in the mix.

Prior to the final moments of the film, most movie lovers will guess who the killer is. But that doesn't mean I'll spoil it for those who don't. Both actors seem to be walking through these roles without a ton of enthusiasm. It doesn't lessen what they have to offer, but one would think after waiting for just the right movie to be able to work together again in they would have found something a bit better than this.

Which is odd. Because while the film may not meet the standards I have in my own mind for these actors, it is actually a relatively decent film. The story seems as if it could happen and the possibility of someone going off the end after years of watching suspects set free is plausible enough, though one hopes it's never happened.

The rest of the cast include 50 Cent as Spider, Carla Gugino as Karen Corelli (Cowan's love interest), John Leguizamo and Donnie Wahlberg as fellow detectives and Brian Dennehy as the their supervisor. All turn in well done performances and it's nice to see Dennehy on screen again.

Is this movie worth renting and watching? Certainly. It's far better than a number of films released. Is it worth adding to your collection? I would say for die hard fans of the two actors only. Anything either of them decides to do make their performances worth watching. They elevate things they are in. This movie doesn't drop their standing in the least.",1247356800,,4375,4.45625

What was about the ending that easily could win an award for the most ridiculous, preposterous, and stupidest scene that involves two Oscar winners ever.

It is not the case with Righteous Kill, and even two stars can't save it. Ironically, the most memorable scene for me was De Niro (Turk) quoting Dirty Harry, ""There's nothing wrong with a little shooting, as long as the right people get shot."" It made me think about Clint Eastwood. How did he manage to direct himself last year in his own film at the age of 78, and to make it a fantastic poignant movie that obviously salutes to his most beloved character Dirty Harry Callahan, tells the story in the best traditions that seem lost nowadays, and ends on a high and moving note. The film with two great actors should be a cinematic event, not a laughing stock.

*Spoilers*

I really wanted to like Righteous Kill. I love ambiguous morality dramas like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Brave-One/dp/B0010HOZW6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Brave One</a>, and was looking forward to seeing the psychology behind a police vigilante - what motivates him (revenge? justice? protection? disgust? anger?) and whether or not we would agree with his motives, if not his methods. With Pacino and De Niro, I was sure I couldn't be disappointed. In the end, I was both right and wrong. I was disappointed with the movie, but not with the acting. It was the ham-fisted plot that did it for me.

The movie starts out, promisingly enough, with De Niro performing a voice-over, video-taped confession - explaining why he murdered his victims, what motivated him, how he chose them. We flash back to 'the beginning' and are treated to the stereotypical long standing cop-partnership: De Niro is the hot-head and Pacino is the mediator, calming him down and keeping him out of trouble. Pacino cleans up De Niro's messes and holds the deep tenderness and understanding that seems to characterize long marriages and cop partnerships.

As De Niro explodes repeatedly over various incidents ranging from disputed baseball plays and criminals walking free on court technicalities, the savvy movie goer begins to find themselves on the edge of a doubt. As De Niro sweats under the inquiring gaze of the other police officers and seems constantly on the verge of discovery, it hits us between the eyes that De Niro can't be the killer, because he's just too obvious a set-up. The voice-over confession, the constant raging temper, the internal investigation: all these are so blatant, obvious, and ham-fisted that we realize, long before we are supposed to, that the killer must be Pacino because, well, De Niro is just too obvious.

This is irritating. As an avid movie-watcher, I expect twists, sure, but the twist shouldn't be set-up so obvious that it's being shoved in your face. When the entire movie seems to be one long shout of ""De Niro is the killer!! De Niro is the killer!!"", then the movie-goer is forced to switch gears from the subtle intricacies of vigilantism and into the teeth-grinding, ""Well, who is the REAL killer?"" mode. Let's see, it can't be De Niro because he's too obvious. It can't be his girlfriend because she's there to be a sex object and a victim, and not anything so glamorous as The Killer. (Which is a shame, because it would have been an interesting twist, with Pacino thinking that De Niro is the killer and covering for him, only to find that he had misjudged his partner all this time.) Nope, it's got to be Pacino because he's a headline name and his character is charming and patient, which is an extremely suspicious thing to be in these sorts of movies.

After the viewer is slammed in the fact with the ""twist"" thirty minutes ahead of schedule, all interest is lost. The movie isn't really about exploring vigilantism, or delving into the psyche of someone who witnesses daily horrors - it's about finding out that Pacino is the real killer. Having already let that slip via the ham-fisted set-up of De Niro, there's nothing much left to do but let it grind down to the end.

3146265,3,B0015OKWL2,"Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro play two long-time NYC detectives who have been partners for years. DeNiro's Turk has a hair-trigger temper and definite issues with anger management. He's counterbalanced by Pacino's Rooster who's an easygoing, funloving guy. Both are tracking a serial killer who's murdering criminals who have not been convicted due to technicality glitches. The investigation points to a cop (this brought up by Rooster) which Turk adamantly refuses to believe. Brian Dennehy (another great actor) has a peripheral role as their boss. Carla Gugino plays a forensic criminalist who is also Turk's girlfriend, and she's just weird in this role. None of the characters were that likeable; therefore, I wasn't vested in the outcome.

The pace of the movie seemed lagging and at times just wasn't interesting. DeNiro and Pacino play off one another well but it didn't work in this case. Almost from the start, I figured out who the real killer was - as in any mystery, filter out all the red herrings thrown at you and focus on the least likely one.

3146268,2,B0015OKWL2,"There is something amusing to me when people simply spit out famous actor's names and presume that means you are getting a good movie.  For years, people bemoaned Pacino and De Niro didn't really have a scene to together in 'Heat,' so I suppose this is their remedy.

Ah, this film is a masterpiece.  Two famous actors who have nothing left other than the relative fame of their names do what they do: act like De Niro and Pacino.  For years, people have extolled the virtues of their respective movies but what nobody wants to admit is that Pacino and De Niro have played themselves for years.  They don't really have any particular skill other than playing the same character over and over again.

Both men make the same faces they always make; Pacino requires a barking soliloquy at the end of each movie.  De Niro's mouth turns down at the corners all the time.  The acting is just silly; these are two overblown actors, at least a decade past their primes (likely more), together in a movie in the hope the combination of their respective names would somehow make these utterly unremarkable movie marketable.

You have to buy De Niro as virile enough to have Carla Gugino as a girlfriend and, in order to demonstrate his manliness, they have to show an elderly De Niro in various sexual poses which serve to disgust as opposed to convincing you he's a man of 'action.'  If you survive the gag flex of those utterly unnecessary scenes, you get the reward of two actors acting for a paycheck.

3146269,2,B0015OKWL2,"Well first off i would like to start this review by saying that Jon Avnet is not really a very good director, and the only film he is really recognized for is Red Corner(1997 Richard Gere), which was pretty good but not stunning. Secondly it seems Al Pacino(my icon) likes his direction because this is the second film that Al has done with him(88 minutes)in the past 2 years which was stated as being one of Pacinos worst films ever. I did think 88 minutes was cliche' to say the least but it was 10 times better than this film mainly because Pacino acted his butt off for a very sup par film. So that said al and robert being on the big screen together was one of my dreams come true, but that dream fell short when i started about 10 minutes into the film and realized what i was about to witness.
  This movie is riddled with horrible dialogue, a cliched script and screenplay as i said before and just a horrible sense that the film was rushed. This could be in a literal sense of the word considering when you watch the movie nearly all the scenes between al and Robert and anyone else for that matter seemed very rushed and they never had any time to just sit and feed off each other like it should have been. Heat was the first time they actually talked face to face and in that short 10 minutes or so it is still one of the greatest most classic scenes in movies today. Now as for the movie itself basically the whole premise is the two detectives trying to find a serial killer who's basically murdering the murderers but eventually points towards a cop, thats it, thats all. The ending of the movie while clever still cant hold together the overall plot and really you may be suprised but disappointed because you wished it had been the end of a ""better"" movie. So in closing of this short review the only thing that saves Righteous Kill for even a casual viewing to see these two legends together and is in fact themselves that barely hold it together, they are the only reason to even bother. Any other actors that may had been chosen for the film would have sent this straight to DVD. And while these performances aren't even close to there best, they both bring there own unique talent to a very tedious, rushed and at times boring movie. Lets hope they have enough in them before 70 hits to maybe reunite again, with a very great director. Michael Mann where are you?:(

Also note Jon Avnet trys to get away with slick suprise endings, well it didn't work very well in 88 minutes, nor does it in this film. Also i find it amusing that it says a Jon Avnet film, like he's a grade A top director. Not so either. Just pick it up you'll see what i mean.",1239840000,,2665,4.294234592445328
3146270,3,B0015OKWL2,"Arguably the two greatest actors from my teens together again in a gritty vigilante film should be a slam dunk success, but for me it wasn't.

Top that off with these super-cops being in at least their mid sixties, made the suspension of disbelief surpass any science fiction plot that I can think of.

3146277,5,B0015OKWL2,"I can recall seeing previews for this movie and thinking that I couldn't wait to see it.  After all it has Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino, how could it be a bad movie.  Well the trend for movies now is that they are in the theater for five days before being pulled, so I never got a chance to see ""Righteous Kill"".  Then the DVD came out and it was bought for me by my girlfriend.

Before I put the movie into my DVD player I recall all the negative praise I heard about this movie.  Many of the reviews called the movie a ""dud"", not good as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heat-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B0006J28KU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heat (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;(the classic film that featured DeNiro and Pacino in 1995), predictable or just a lazy effort.  I confess I was a bit concerned that this movie was going to ""suck"".

Upon completion of viewing ""Righteous Kill"" I was very, very pleased. The movie was about DeNiro and Pacino investigating a series of murders.  These murders involve all ""criminals"" that either ""got off the hook"" or ""haven't got caught yet"".  The crimes these delinquents have performed range from rape to drug dealing.  As both of these veteran cops dig deeper they discover the ""killer"" could be a cop/police officer.  There is a lot of misdirection in this film about who did or didn't do it.

There is some criticism that the ""serial killer"" was painfully obvious.  I am not sure about all that.  I will admit the outcome of this movie wasn't the most original, but it didn't ruin the film for me.  I won't give the ending of the movie or spoil any details of this film.  I will say that it is very likely a viewer might have the mystery figured out before the denouement of the film arrives.

What I found refreshing about this film was the acting and the grittiness of the subject matter.  Seeing DeNiro and Pacino together (again) was awesome.  I didn't feel that their acting was lacking substance or dull.  These are two classic actors and are still in their prime.  I felt their interaction made up for mundane film clichs that could have transpired.  As for the supporting cast, that was excellent too. John Leguizamo, Donnie Wahlberg, Carla Gugino, Brian Dennehy and even Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson did a good job.  This movie also presents a rather moral question about murder that you can almost smell a ""Death Wish"" movie.  This flick has a very intelligent edge to it, much more than you normal crime drama.

I can't speak for why other people didn't like this film.  As for it being predictable, isn't 90% of every successful and box office smash predictable?  Look at romantic-comedies.  Perhaps the problem ""Righteous Kill"" faced was the prior catalogue both DeNiro and Pacino have, including ""Heat"".  Now in juxtaposition ""Heat"" is a better movie than ""Righteous Kill"".  However the latter does feature more screen time between DeNiro and Pacino and this is what makes this movie work.  I am glad I took a chance on this movie and didn't listen to ""critical acclaim"" because I thought it was awesome.  There are worst ways a person could spend an hour and forty minutes.",1237248000,,3180,4.853159851301116
3146278,2,B0015OKWL2,"'Righteous Kill' represents a big foot forward for screenwriter Russell Gewirtz. Where Gewirtz's rookie effort, 'Inside Man', was a story about a bank heist that completely lacked credibility, the plot of 'Righteous Kill' actually is modestly clever. A vigilante serial killer is on the loose in New York City, murdering various criminals. His calling card is a rhymed poem left at each crime scene. De Niro (Turk) and Pacino (Rooster) play the two aging detectives assigned to solve the case. De Niro is seen throughout on a surveillance tape seemingly 'confessing' to committing the murders. But in a twist at the end of the story, his confession turns out to be forced and it ends up that Pacino is actually the murderer all along.

Before arriving at the film's climax, we learn that Turk planted evidence on a murderer who got off on a technicality and as a result the criminal is sent off to jail. A good part of the movie chronicles how each of the bad guys are dispatched by the vigilante. The main bad guy is a drug dealer played by 50 Cent who is convincingly menacing. An early unconvincing scene involves Turk and Rooster sending a pretty coke-addicted lawyer to the drug dealer's lair, wearing a wire, and trying to entrap him. The drug dealer sees through the ruse right away and the lawyer is shot by the drug dealer's bodyguard (but eventually survives). Why veteran detectives would place an amateur informant in such easy jeopardy doesn't ring true. There's a subplot involving a sexy Crime Scene Investigator who is simultaneously bedding Turk and Perez, a younger detective (played by John Leguizamo). Perez and his partner Riley (played by Donnie Wahlberg) come to the conclusion that it's one of their own who has been committing the murders.

Various posters here have pointed to deficiencies in the script including that De Niro and Pacino are too old for their parts, there's a lack of character development (too many good cop/bad cop clichs), a lack of suspense and scenes that are repetitious. One poster suggested that the characters needed to have a softer side but I think it was the director's intent to keep the entire story as dark as possible. The constant use of the moody soundtrack throughout most of the film compensated for the lack of emotional depth of the characters. Was this a good thing? I don't know. But clearly the music added to the film's 'neo-noir' feel.

'Righteous Kill' will probably do fairly well at the box office if one factors in the potential global market. This is really a noir version of 'Dirty Harry' and those who love having their stick-figure bad guys brought to justice without putting up a fight, will be drawn to his type of film. And then there's De Niro and Pacino. De Niro almost always channels the same character--a hot-headed gangster type (I was so much reminded of his performance in 'Analyze This', although that's a comedy). Moviegoers always want to pay money to see De Niro even though he usually coughs up the same shtick. Pacino however is much more subdued in this film until the end. Only then does he allow his over the top persona to come out. Actually that was the intent of the screenwriter; the audience is led to believe that De Niro is the hot head and Pacino is the reasonable one. Pacino keeps De Niro ""in check' throughout the film until the ending.

Although many claimed they 'figured out' the twist ending 30 minutes into the film, I must confess that I didn't see it coming. But once it was revealed I didn't really buy the reversal since it was inconsistent with the way the character arc had developed. Pacino's 'Rooster' has noble motives for offing the bad guys. But suddenly, when the sexy CSI gal is about to expose him, he viciously attacks her. It just seemed totally out of character for this noble 'Dirty Harry' character to suddenly decompensate and attack a woman. What 'noble' criminal would do such a thing? Rooster's explanation is that he became disappointed with Turk after Turk planted evidence on the murderer who got off on a technicality. He had 'looked up' to Turk but now the image of him being a noble cop had been destroyed. Somehow he now becomes a vigilante serial killer because his partner no longer 'went by the book'. This is his explanation as to why he becomes unhinged which leads his partner of 30 years to shoot him to death. If you believe in this motive, then you'll believe that the portrait of the New York City Police Department as depicted in this film is a realistic one.

When all is said and done, we never get a feel for Turk and Rooster as flesh and blood human beings. There is little 'back story' to 'Righteous Kill' and that applies to all the characters. 'Righteous Kill"" remains a modestly entertaining detective mystery with little character development and chiefly relying on the hit or miss semi-comic banter between two aging Hollywood legends.",1237161600,3,4900,4.739742086752638
3146279,3,B0015OKWL2,"Turk and Rooster (feel free to cringe) are a couple of veteran cops, who've been handed a doozy of a case: a serial killer with a badge; or, as young detective Perez makes a point of saying, ""It's a cop, it's a cop, it's a cop!"" A video-taped confession by Turk doesn't quite seal the deal; after all, once we hear his confession, we have an hour and a half of movie left, and believe me, it's full of twists and turns and bullets and blood and gratuitous violence and freaky sex.

""Righteous Kill"" isn't at all what it could have been, and that is a damn shame.  Pacino is as enthusiastic and enjoyable as ever; De Niro appears to be sleep-walking at times, though he has his moments (does anyone else think he should team with Scorsese again?).  John Leguizamo and Donnie Wahlberg are good as younger detectives investigating the same case (though I wonder if four detectives wold be allowed to share the lead on a single case); and Carla Gugino is enjoyable as Turk's freaky girlfriend.  Curtis Jackson (aka 50 Cent) isn't half bad, though I believe that's because he only has a little screen time.  Brian Dennehy, as the police captain, is a pure pleasure to watch as always; his scenes with De Niro and Pacino (Pacino especially) are the best in the film.

The ""twist"" here (the main one, that is) is clever and intriguing, but it's bogged down by shoddy directing and an overly-ambitious script.  The fault isn't with the actors, it's with the people behind the scenes.  To put it simply, ""Righteous Kill"" is a second-rate film starring first-rate talent.  It's a shame, that THIS is the movie Pacino and De Niro finally decide to make together.

Most cops retire in their mid 50s, because by then most of them already have 25 to 30 years of service, and they can retire with full pension benefits.  Those that still want to work often take lucrative gigs in private security and private investigation work (which is on top of their generous taxpayer-funded pensions).

This is a decent little thriller, but I simply cannot suspend disbelief that they would still be on the job at that age.  Pacino, particularly, looks well into his 70s, even though he hasn't yet turned 69.  By casting 70 year-old Brian Dennehy (who looks 80) as their boss, they tried to make the two leads look younger by comparison, but it just compounds the silliness.  Most police forces have a mandatory retirement age, and it doesn't go up to age 70, even for the highest ranking officers.

There are still many juicy roles these guys can play, and I hope to see much more from each of them.  They just cannot play cops anymore.",1236297600,,1121,4.537313432835821

Anyway, some pretty bad people, who have gotten off (i.e., eluded justice...among them a child rapist, pimp, killer, a molesting priest, etc) on technicalities  are being murdered (actually gunned down with their own weapons). Assigned to this case are Turk (the sexy Robert Deniro) and Rooster (Al Pacino), who have tons of history and experience between them, and two rookies, Perez (John Leugizamo) and his dedicated sidekick Riley (Donnie Wahlberg). With converging storylines (there are tons of them....for example Deniro's romantic relationship with a fellow officer, played by Carla Gugino and Rooster's sketchy past), ""Righteous Kill"" was fairly entertaining. With plot twists and turns, this movie offers just the right amount of suspense (although I am sure that you will figure out the killer before the end) and mystery.

Together, they are investigating a serial killer who has decided to mete out his own brand of vigilante justice.  Criminals who have gone free on technicalities are being shot by an expert marksman; poems are being found on their corpses.  Who is the poetic serial killer?  Could it be a cop?  The answer will shock you.

  Fans of horror and action thrillers alike will love ""Righteous Kill.""  Thanks to the gory, shocking murders that compose a high body count, the pacing is fast.  Also, some of the victims were genuinely corrupt and the viewer will tend to sympathize with the serial killer.  Is the killer truly righteous in disposing of these criminals?  We also cheered Charles Bronson in the classic ""Death Wish"" and Jodie Foster in ""The Brave One"" when they relentlessly pursued the criminals who had killed their loved ones.

  Planting false evidence and killing criminals who have escaped justice have been themes of past vigilante films.  Michael Douglas was a judge in ""The Star Chamber,"" which was a vigilante organization contracting hit men to kill criminals.  Charles Bronson is found guilty of planting evidence on a serial killer in ""10 To Midnight;"" he later pursues the serial killer himself after three more young women are stabbed to death at his daughter's dormitory.

  As long as there is a justice system that favors the criminal over the victim, there will be movies like ""Righteous Kill.""  They represent a society that feels frustrated and hopeless because criminals are not receiving the punishments that they deserve.

In Heat, which was a significant drop-off from the Francis Ford Coppola film, they had a single scene together.

Did Jon Avnet think ""oh, we can do better than THAT?""

Well... maybe someone could, but this isn't that film.  Putting De Niro and Pacino in the room with this script and rolling the camera doesn't work any better than putting my two year old grandson in a room with paint and canvas and expecting a Jackson Pollock.

These iconic actors simply do not fit this script.  Their ""police buddy/partner"" characters are street cops.  De Niro, 65, and Pacino, 68, both look their age, and no degree of ""suspension of disbelief"" allows me to accept these two post-retirement age acting icons as ""street cops"".

Carla Gugino, luscious and 37, plays the love interest.  Does it matter whose?  Make sure the defibrillator is charged...

The story is insulting.  It borrows from the ""Keyser Soze Syndrome"", trying to ""surprise"" the audience, who is deliberately misled in an attempt to make them believe the wrong thing before unveiling the surprise.  Now that I think about it, De Niro stars in another of my least favorite ""surprise ending"" films, Hide N Seek.

Mr. De Niro would do well to be a little more selective in his scripts and Mr. Pacino would do well to take a look at Frank Caliendo's impersonation of himself, then take steps to NOT reproduce it. (I think Caliendo's point is that Pacino has played essentially the same exact character in every film since ""Scent of a Woman"".)

This storyline was so predictable and overdone.  I knew exactly how it was going to end.  I guess if you watch a lot of movies it is easy to become jaded and guess endings, but this was just so lame.

The acting was not bad, John Leguizamo and Donnie Wahlberg were interesting, but overall the acting was not at the level I was anticipating.  And what is wrong with Carla Gugino ... why is she picking such strange roles that showcase her physical and sexual attributes, and not her acting?

I am greatly disappointed.  This movie is a series of clich&eacute;s strung together that was not supposed to be noticed because we were supposed to be mesmerized by the De Niro/Pacino combo.

On that slender thread are hung the abilities of two of our greatest living cinematic actors.  The film held my attention, though the subplot was shaky and the conclusion largely predictable.

3146298,1,B0015OKWL2,"This movie is such a tragic waste.  Like ""On The Waterfront""'s Terry Malloy, it coulda been a contender -- if it had a different script, a different director, and a different supporting cast.  (Seriously -- 50 Cent and Donnie Wahlberg?  What, was Rob Schneider busy?)  As it is, the plot is stale and utterly predictable and completely dull to watch.  It's not even right to call the ending a ""twist"" because if you were watching with at least one eye open, you saw it coming pretty much from the beginning.  Pacino and DeNiro don't do anything with their performances that lift them out of the molds they've made for themselves these last  ten years -- the craggy, foul-mouthed cop and/or crook.  DeNiro has gotten some traction out of sending up that image in movies like ""Analyze This"" and ""Meet The Parents"" but this time around, he expects us to take him seriously.  Not happening.  There's really not much more I can say about this movie, to be honest.  The bottom line is that it should have generated some Heat (pun very much intended) but instead it left me cold.  It's boring as heck, and the presence of these two heavyweights doesn't make it any more interesting.  It's even worse than ""The Score"" -- another epic combination of actors (DeNiro, Brando and Norton) in a movie that's unworthy of their talent.

The extras are a waste of time.  There's a trailer, but it wasn't that great a trailer so I had no desire to watch it again.  I saw this movie because of the DeNiro/Pacino pairing, not because of the trailer.  There's a short feature on the movie itself with all the actors gushing about being able to work with the two legends.  That feature only makes me wonder why there isn't a feature where the two legends sit down and talk to each other about working together and about their careers.  Spike Lee and Denzel Washington did it in the extras for ""Inside Man,"" and I would have loved to see something similar here, but no dice.  Instead we get a long, useless feature with real NYPD cops talking about their jobs and how their jobs compare to the movie.  It's the kind of thing I'd expect to see on The Discovery Channel, but would never actually watch, and I didn't finish watching it on this DVD either.  Not a single actor from the movie is in it.

Even the most die-hard Pacino and DeNiro fans -- the nutters who'll never admit to any flaws in their icons, and sweep all their recent terrible film choices under the rug (""88 Minutes"", anyone?) in favor of harping on the increasingly distant past -- are sure to be disappointed by this one.  It's just a crying shame that these guys couldn't have spent the last 14 years finding another project that suited their talent, and really challenged them to step up to the plate again as great actors, instead of just phoning it in.  This entire DVD is just a monument to a colossal missed opportunity.",1233705600,,2873,4.542801556420233
3146299,2,B0015OKWL2,"What happens when someone in Hollywood gets a great idea, but the execution of said idea becomes mismanaged, resulting in an essentially half-hearted attempt at a movie? Well, one could say that the outcome would resemble something similar to the mind-numbingly formulaic, contrived, and completely devoid of any thrills thriller known as ""Righteous Kill"" starring screen legends Robert DeNiro (""Goodfellas"") and Al Pacino (""The Godfather"" trilogy).

""Righteous Kill"" centers upon two detectives, ""Turk"" (Robert DeNiro) and ""Rooster"" (Al Pacino), longtime partners within the NYPD for over 30 years. For these two decorated officers the streets shouldn't be able to offer them any new surprises; that is until several known criminals begin getting murdered by an alleged vigilante. To make matters worse, the dead bodies are all tied to cases the pair had solved over their many years on the force, prompting many in the department to wonder if one of their own has gone over the edge.

Prior to viewing this film I began to notice some rather strange omissions from the trailers preceding the impending release upon DVD and Blu-ray. Namely, the lack of any critical praise being thrown about; of course, this makes perfect sense given that a vast majority of film critics blasted the movie to pieces. With a growing sense that perhaps this movie is as lackluster as the critics had said it was, I found that my eagerness to see it was waning significantly. Yet, like a glutton for punishment I decided to sit down one night to see it for myself, because even though the movie was almost universally panned, I still like to make my own judgments about a film. Needless to say, after watching ""Righteous Kill"" I find myself in complete agreement with the majority of the critics, and wondering why on Earth did this film ever see the light of day, let alone find its way into the hands of two of Hollywood's icons?

To attempt to understand where this film went wrong we must first look at the base on which the film stands... the screenplay. Next to the involvement of actors Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino, the other big surprise surrounding this film was the fact that the script was written by the man who penned the outstanding heist film ""Inside Man"", writer Russell Gewirtz. After crafting such an entertaining thriller full of twists and turns and originality, I'm surprised that Gewirtz's follow-up would essentially embody the antithesis of all that was great about his previous script. With ""Righteous Kill"" there is nary a hint of originality, in place of that is an abundance of predictability that causes all of the potential twists and turns that the story will no doubt throw at the audience to fail due to the sheer obviousness of the proceedings.

On top of that is the fact that the only way any sense of suspense was created in this film was through a contrived plot device where several of the characters are referred to solely by their nicknames. This way the viewer doesn't know who is really who until the final moments of the film. It is this manufactured form of suspense that made me feel especially disappointed for two reasons. One, I can't think of a single person whose nickname is the only name by which they are called; and second, if Russell Gewirtz didn't want certain people's identities being truly known until the end, there are much more natural ways to achieve this. For instance, many people don't even refer to someone by name when talking to them, especially if they are very familiar with them. So, in the movie the nickname device could have still been used in conjunction with just casual conversation where no names are ever mentioned. This way the dialogue could still feel natural, and the unknown identities would still be a form of manufactured suspense, but one far less obvious and annoying.

Now lets move on to the director of this travesty, the much maligned (by me, that is) Jon Avnet, director of the abominable ""88 Minutes"". From what I have been able to gather after watching Jon's last two attempts at feature films, if it weren't for the surprisingly talented cast members he is able to ensnare, his films would most likely wind up on rental shelves or never even see the light of day in the first place. I find myself completely surprised that this man is able to get such high-caliber actors and actresses to flesh out his roles. Granted his track record of television shows (""Boomtown"" for instance) is a bit more impressive, even if his shows haven't been the longest lasting, at least they were compelling; and it is conceivable that news of the utter crap-fest that was ""88 Minutes"" was not made known until after it was too late and those involved in this film were already signed. With those two thoughts in mind, they may serve as an explanation as to why Pacino and DeNiro would even consider joining up with such a hack director; although Pacino by all rights should have already figured out that this guy didn't have a clue after his time spent headlining the previous film. Whatever the case may be for why this man still has work coming to him in Hollywood, from my perspective he's had his first and second chances, and massively blown them both, so I can't understand why he isn't just shown the door or at least his way onto the B-list, a.k.a. the Direct-to-DVD list.

As I stated before, the biggest surprise of all surrounding this movie, was the involvement of Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino. The last time these two screen legends had acted opposite each other was in the superbly crafted ""Heat"" from director Michael Mann. Here we are 13 years later, and what should have been one of the greatest Hollywood reunions of all time, is wasted in a movie that is well below their considerable talents. Although some could argue that neither actor has been at the top of their game in quite some time; I still believed that their common sense would have told them to run away from this mess before it is too late. But I guess I would have been wrong on that count. Which leads me to wonder if these two acting giants have lost the drive that once made them such forces to be reckoned with, and is it too late for them to reclaim what they appear to have lost?

I will say that even though this film is well below the standards of their prime, both Pacino and DeNiro did give decent performances. However, I would have to say that neither one seemed too committed to their respective role, but at least they weren't just overtly going through the motions without a care, as they have done in some of their recent work (i.e. ""88 Minutes""). Joining them we have actress Carla Gugino (""Sin City"") who serves the purpose of being nothing more than the eye candy of the film. Her role doesn't really offer anything to the proceedings, and the one point in the story when it seems her character may have some relevance after all, is squandered in the end. Other supporting cast members include Donnie Wahlberg (""Saw 2"") and John Leguizamo (""The Happening"") as two other police officers with ties to some of the various criminals being murdered. I'm sure their characters were intended to serve as compelling antagonists to Pacino and DeNiro's, but in the end both of them appear as bland and uninspired as the rest of the production, despite the efforts of Leguizamo and Wahlberg. Lastly, Brian Dennehy appears in a thankless role so small that it is almost relegated to cameo status as the boss/friend of ""Turk"" and ""Rooster"". Brian Dennehy is a talented actor who has always managed to entertain no matter the role; yet in this film even he can't make a miracle happen and his choice for signing onto this project seems just as bewildering as the two leads.

It's a shame that such a large amount of talent was wasted on such a generic movie as ""Righteous Kill"", and truth be told had the star power associated with this film not been involved, I have no doubt that most people never would have heard of the movie and it would have found its way directly on to rental shelves instead of in theaters. Now, if you have not seen a mystery/thriller or any kind of cop movie or television program, then perhaps you will find ""Righteous Kill"" to be outstanding; however, if you have seen any of the aforementioned, then you will most likely find this film to be just as dull and boring as I did.

De Niro and Pacino sail through the film using their, by now, patented mannerisms....De Niro mostly scowls as if he's still working in ""A Boy's Life""...what's most amazing is these two exhibit zero chemistry together.

Secondly, it deals with a subject that appeals, in fantasy, with emotions shared by a large segment of our society, retribution for heinous crimes but unfulfilled because of the often unfair legal system.  This film harkens back to the popular DEATH WISH series of the '70's and '80's starring the great Charles Bronson in which he, too, became a vigilante due to the dubious legal system.

Sure, there are some weak plot details, but that exists in many of the greatest films of yesterday and today and in the end we rate films for a great number of things not the least of which is great acting which does not dissappoint here.

3146307,1,B0015OKWL2,"Ah, I just couldn't wait to buy this movie - De Niro, Pacino!  What could possibly go wrong?  Answer: everything!

Take a bad script, add a narrator, and then throw in a few B-level actor wannabes and you have a disaster on film.  This movie is so predictable and boring that I can only imagine Robert and Al were heavily medicated for head colds when they agreed to take lead roles in this project.

If it had been any other actors, this movie would have been stopped in the middle of production.  However, many people actually give this movie high ratings, here at Amazon.com, because they know the amazing track record for the two big leaguers!  And I truly can't blame them for that.  Pacino or De Niro sitting in a rocking chair for thirty minutes would probably be a bit interesting, because these two have that IT factor.

Two very old, white, NYPD detectives fall under every single clich ever invented about cops.  Then they work out in the police weight training room, shoot lots of bullets at targets, talk trash, brag on each other, fight with the younger cops, stand up to the black street thug, and along the way discover they have a vigilante in their midst; wow, how will the audience ever handle the suspense.  Easy, there is none.  In fact, there really isn't a single character in this movie who I found myself rooting for to succeed.  I was actually hoping they all got shot!  Sorry, just being brutally honest; everyone seemed corrupt, arrogant, and void of any good human qualities.

Righteous Kill is one of those movies that everyone hoped would live up to the hype.  But when you rely on a cool musical soundtrack and two great movie stars to carry the whole project, you are going to create a mess.  And that is exactly the best way to describe this movie:  A MESS.

And CASTING DIRECTORS, please stop putting 50 Cent in movies!  He should not even be an extra in a film.  He cannot act!  He's not even good enough to convince an audience he is a rapper, and he is.

I really should have known better after Pacino's last effort ""88 Minutes"", another tepid thriller.

Okay, so maybe I'm exaggerating - it's not that Righteous Kill is a completely bad movie, but it's the unfulfilled expectations of seeing two legends paired together to make a really good movie that proved it's undoing.

De Niro plays ""Turk"" and Pacino plays ""Rooster"", two NY cops who've been around for a while, perhaps too long. A serial killer is on the prowl, offing acquitted criminals and an earlier scene with Turk confessing to the crimes naturally makes viewers think he is the suspect. But the flow of the movie just doesn't mesh with the development of the main characters - in the end, the revelations don't really shock and the characters appear pretty much one-dimensional.

I also felt that these two veteran actors and screen legends left it too late to make an on-screen appearance together - they are both in their late 60's and it shows. There is no sense of presence and we don't get any indication that these are acting heavyweights - much of the blame goes to the bad direction as well as the tepid plot, but part of it is also because these two are unconvincing in their roles here.",1231977600,,1489,4.611320754716981

3146312,3,B0015OKWL2,"The last time I watched my two favorite iconic actors was in the blockbuster hit ""HEAT"" and of course, I was drawn to director Jon Avnet's ""RIGHTEOUS KILL""--although, I was keeping my expectations really low (after amazon friend Chris Blackshere`s review). The film has a very interesting premise and has the makings of an effective police drama, unfortunately the screenplay by Russell Gerwitz appears to have been hampered by a ""gimmick"" in the form of a video taped confession.

Turk (Robert De Niro) and Rooster (Al Pacino) are two cops, with a 30 year service to the NYPD. These two detectives have a lot of experience and have seen a lot of things in their career. Turk actually has some anger management issues and Rooster is just full of ""cool"". The two are teamed up with another pair of detectives, Riley and Perez (Donnie Wahlberg and John Leguizamo respectively) from another unit to investigate the killings of several ""scumbags"" who are still out on the streets because of technicalities in court. These killings seem to be the work of a vigilante roaming the city streets who leaves poetry after each kill. There is some tension between Turk and Perez, Turk is currently a forensic scientist's (played by sexy Carla Gugino) ""whoopee"" buddy and Perez has a history with her. The four detectives find themselves in a collision course as Riley and Perez names Turk as the suspect. All the evidence points to Turk--or does it?

First of all, I love Pacino and DeNiro so it is such a treat to see them interact within the same camera view for such a good period of time. (they had limited interaction in ""Heat"") These two men are iconic actors and they can carry any film to no end. You just look at the actors and their presence just commands attention. Their characters ""Rooster"" and ""Turk"" are somewhat compelling and complex, they are very interesting, so at least both Pacino and DeNiro have something to work with. Pacino is the one who is level-headed while De Niro is the hot-headed one; also quite an unusual parallel to Wahlberg's Riley and Leguizamo's Perez. I suppose it was an attempt for Avnet to express the familiar mechanics of the ""good cop, bad cop routine"". Quite stereotypical, but with Pacino's and DeNiro`s performances, one doesn't necessarily need to be original.

The script does have a good plot, decent set ups, complex characters but what really hurt the film is its predictability. The film's main gimmick with ""Turk"" on videotape confessing in the first act just ruined everything for me, it became so predictable and I solved the ""mystery"" before the first half. For a movie like this, the serial killer-vigilante's identity have to be meticulously hidden so the viewer can be immersed into the proceedings--the style is just a cheap trick to try and interest the audience. Ok, I tried to justify the videotaped confession by thinking that the film is mostly about friendship, duty and trust; I honestly did try to get over the thriller elements but the directing and editing just kept me from buying this film as a morality play. I cannot go any further without spoiling the film for anybody, but to make things short, the direction was depending on misdirection on the screenplay and some ineffective twists for it to be accepted as one. Too bad, a few efforts in the editing room would have put this film into the list of effective cop dramas.

The film just showed a lot of errors in the way it was structured, the proceedings truly discouraged me to be involved and interested. Several elements proved to be critical mistakes. I was quite surprised as to how Avnet managed to convince this impressive cast to accept this project. Then, the screenplay plays its desperate hand by displaying some forensics groundwork and some tricky camera-work  which are obviously meant to add some ""meat"" to the film. Carla Gugino's character Karen seemed to be an obvious plot device to add some tension as well as eye candy; but her assault by the killer just felt too cheap. As a whodunit cop film, the movie falls apart.

The mistakes with ""Righteous Kill"" began and ended with the fact that it showed its cards too soon, it misuses its good elements, and it gave this terrific cast some, but too little to work with. There is a very good film underneath, which could have easily been solved by re-shoots and re-editing but I suppose Avnet liked his product as it is. The film isn't that bad, it does have a good premise but it just does nothing with its iconic leads. One might say, predictability can be accepted and if the journey is rewarding--well, the one great thing we can divulge from this film is the fact that it does star Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino. Yep, their performances does command respect.

Recommended with caution for Pacino and DeNiro fans, and a Rental for everybody else [3 Stars]

Innovative?--Worthy of two of the last half century's
greatest actors?--Hell Yeah!!
But for this particular genre of film, I still found it entertaining.
Of course, everybody was licking their chops when word of
another De Niro/Pacino pairing was announced, having been
properly teased by them in their way too breif (but nonetheless)
powerful two scenes in 1995's ""HEAT"", which is the stuff of
modern movie legend!

Bottomline, I still think this is a pretty good movie
and I think the subtlety of both Pacino and De Niro's performances
in it, supported admirably by John Leguizamo and Donnie Wahlberg's
parts and the other cast members give this film substance.
I think that when people hear De Niro & Pacino, their minds go
up 10 levels above what they expect from other actors,
which is a testimony to both of these great thespians body of work.
But never forget, THEY ARE ACTORS!!---And they will be as dynamic
or as subtle as the subject matter requires!
So to the naysayers of this film, I say look at it again
and you'll discover that less is vastly more!
I think this film will be appreciated in another 5 ot 7 years.",1231891200,,1188,4.739130434782608

Perhaps the critics savaged ""Righteous Kill"" because of its politically incorrect dialogue, specifically in regards to women.  In any case, it doesn't matter.  What matters is this movie has an interesting story, top-notch actors in Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino, and hard-hitting action.  I give it three and a half stars.

Deniro was good, not amazing by any means, he seems to be coasting through as usual in most of his newer movies, Al Pacino was outstanding, his characters are always very believable, John Leguizamo played his character well, as always and Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson also did a good job, so far his acting seems to be worthwhile!!!

3146322,4,B0015OKWL2,"The trail of good cop/bad cop films grows longer as does the fascination with Serial Killers (witness the success of the excellent television series DEXTER where killing of 'people who deserve to die' is condoned).  RIGHTEOUS KILL is a good story with problems: the script is wrinkled with aphorisms, the direction allows the dialogue to overlap so often that subtitles are required to keep the viewer alert as to what is happening, and the music score too often drowns out what could be heard of the actors' voices.  But at the core of this much-maligned film is a tour de force for two aging actors (actually three) in Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and  Brian Dennehy.  Jon Avnet works with crusty lighting effects and photography to create a sense of tired, aging, worn out detectives who show us a side of law enforcement we'd rather not see.

Turk (Robert De Niro) is seen in the opening in a videotaped monologue about how he came to kill 14 people while in the line of duty.  His partner is Rooster (Al Pacino) and the two of them run their mode of law enforcement in their own style: even their boss Lieutenant Higgis (Brian Dennehy) gives them free reign.  An event occurs which triggers the concept of a serial killer whose murders of 'worthless street trash' victims who are tied to crimes for which they escape punishment.  Turk's fellow detective (an S&M girlfriend) Karen (Carla Gugino) becomes suspicious as do young detectives Perez (Leguizamo) and Riley (Donnie Wahlberg) - the idea of the perpetrator being a cop drives the 'honest cops' to extremes.  The twist at the ending could have had more impact with a better script (the work of Russell Gewirtz), but the interplay between De Niro and Pacino makes the entire film and ending well worth watching.

Great movie? No, but given the flaws and the overexposure of the theme the 'old guys' carry it off and provide a riveting, fast paced film worth the attention of more viewers.  Grady Harp, January 09",1231632000,,1969,4.728070175438597

These two could sit around and read the yellow pages and it'd be entertaining.  But, because they are DeNiro and Pacino the expectation level is pretty high...at least it was for me and I would assume many others.  The acting and subtle nuance between these two really makes this film quite good and it works.  Although, ""Heat"", was a much finer film, ""Righteous Kill"" is a much more satisfying one, in that we get over two hours of these two great actors playing off each other and it is quite enjoyable.  Also cast is one of my favorite character actors, Brian Dennehey, who delivers a solid performance.  Also look for the sexy Carla Gugino in another fine role as the CSI agent who begins to stumble onto the killers path.  I give this film a definate thumbs up and encourage all to give it a look.

3146325,3,B0015OKWL2,"The movie is worth a watch or rental if you haven't seen it.  But if you love it and want to buy it, you might want to spring for the target version as that comes with a free digital copy of the film as well as a trial version of RIGHTEOUS KILL: THE GAME on a bonus disc.  i have not tried either as of yet.

As for the film, it's pretty good, but nothing great considering the two lead actors and a very good supporting cast.  This crime thriller has one of those 'twist' endings, but the problem with the twist is that it is rather obvious as to WHO the serial killer is.  While that disappointed me, i still enjoyed finding out the WHY or WHAT it was that motivated the person to do what they did.  Besides the great cast, that part of the story kept me interested and entertained(for the most part) to the very end.

Unfortunately, i found the extras on the dvd to be just average at best.  There's a standard documentary on the making of the film, a feature on cops and corruption, some trailers, and a commentary with the director.  All worth a watch probably once, but i actually had trouble sitting through them.  Others might find them fascinating though.

Overall, i bought the dvd(without seeing the film first) cause i'm a fan of DeNiro and Pacino but i was a bit let down with the final results.  I liked it and will hang on to my copy, but can't help but agree with most that this could/should've been a lot better than what it was.  3 1/2 stars for the film, rounded down to 3 on amazon cause the extras are so average to me that it hurts the dvd.  In other words, i can easily recommend a rental, but not a purchase.

Heat marked the first onscreen pairing of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, albeit briefly during the nearly three-hour film.

Here De Niro and Pacino spend the entire film side by side and while the run time is about 100 minutes shorter than Heat, the effects are quite the opposite. They are weary. So are we. They are tired. And so on... The been-there-done-that-before story and leaden pacing are simply too much for two Academy Award-winning actors to save.

The premise is actually pretty cool.  Deniro is the cop serial killer, and Pacino is his partner that turns the other cheek.
Both these veteran actors deliver solid performances, but nothing special.  It's like they're on cruise control, nothing meaty in the script to pull the best out of them.

Still it's scary to think of the power a police officer wields, and how in some regards they are exempt from the very laws they try to enforce.
It's hard to feel any contempt or discomfort for the cop that puts a bullet in the head of a rapist or pedaphile priest.  The line between evil and righteousness gets blurred, and few want to focus on sorting things out.

The story progresses with some decent action scenes and interesting developments.  The biggest downside of this movie is without a doubt the ending.  Hollywood always deems it mandatory to throw in an absolutely shocking, retarded ending.  Yeah, they fooled us the first 2000 times.

3146329,3,B0015OKWL2,"RIGHTEOUS KILL has a few things going for it. First off is the A-list talent. Pacino and De Niro are two of the greatest American actors alive today, with filmographys that include many of my favorite films of all time (TAXI DRIVER, THE GODFATHER, GOODFELLAS, CASINO). While the plot is not the most imaginative, it is suitable cop-drama fare. The twist that comes at the end may not surprise many, but at least it is consistent with the film.

The real problem with this film is a script that does not allow De Niro or Pacino to dial into what has made them the actors they are beyond their formidable acting skills: playing interesting, well written characters. Cast as two NYPD officers with many years of experience who are frustrated with The System's inability to keep the bad guys off the street, Turk (De Niro) and Rooster (Pacino) decide to take matters into their own hands. The concept itself is cliched, but might have worked if these two great actors were given the opportunity to bring any depth to their characters. This is where the weak script really kills this movie. Pacino, fresh off the flop that was 88 MINUTES (also directed by Jon Avnet so he might have known to steer clear of this one) is mired in yet another work-horse of a plot with very little emotional depth or character development to really let him shine. De Niro looks defeated throughout, as if the lines he is asked to deliver are killing is soul. The impression is that this might have been an excellent film with better dialogue and more character development, that it might have been a classic right up there with films like Casino, that it had that potential but fell far short.

Most of the criticisms leveled at this film (including my review) have a lot to do with ""what might have been."" The expectation level for a film with two film greats in it was so high that it makes what is really an average film appear worse than it actually is. There is nothing wrong with a cop-drama buddy romp for old-times-sake. However, actors of this caliber cast in the same film do raise expectations, possibly even unfairly high. ""There's nothing wrong with shooting,"" says Pacino at one point in the film, ""as long as the right people get shot."" In this case, it's Di Niro and Pacino facing a firing squad made of professional movie critics. It's up to you to decide if they deserved it.

2.5/5 Stars. Worth renting if for no other reason than to build your hopes that the re-make of HEAT (currently in production) will be the movie that RIGHTEOUS KILL wasn't.",1231459200,,2542,4.594713656387666

Although this movie is worth a rental, I doubt most fans will buy it. Sure I was glad I saw it, but I probably won't watch it again. There wasn't anything to bring me back.

The problem, as I see it, is one of ""expectations"".  If Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino are co-starring in a motion picture, one expects something of the caliber of THE GODFATHER, Part II, or at the very least, HEAT.

Unfortunately, RIGHTEOUS KILL is not in the same league as either of those films, but that doesn't mean it isn't worth seeing.

Directed by Jon Avnet, RIGHTEOUS KILL is a taut, very watchable cops-and-robbers thriller.  It has the two stars playing NYPD detectives on the trail of a serial killer who is probably a fellow police officer turned vigilante.  He is killing violent bad guys who have been able to escape the justice system.  Although the movie opens with DeNiro ""confessing"" to the killings, there is a twist ending that astute viewers will probably guess long before it is revealed on screen.

The script by Russell Gewietz is well-written, and the actors, including John Leguizamo, Brian Dennehy, Carla Gugino, Donnie Wahlberg, Melissa Leo and Curtis Jackson, deliver strong performances.

Avnet delivers audio commentary on the DVD, and there are two ""Making of"" featurettes.

Robert Deniro is as outstanding as always, Al Pacino...I've seen better,I mean this is the Godfather here he could have done a lot better, The movie starts out in a way that makes you feel it's going to be great, even though the story has been done before but quickly you realize that it's just average.

25 to 30 minutes in the movie you get the picture and realize the end, from there on it's just a matter of enjoying the performances by the actors john leguizamo was also very good.

Near the end the events stop making any sense it's like they wanted to finish the movie and put whatever they found on film.

3146336,3,B0015OKWL2,"Putting two of the most legendary stars of all time together in a movie is always a big gamble.  Expectations are immediately heightened, which puts extra pressure on the filmmakers to make a better-than-average film.  Looking back at projects with great duos like Fight Club or The Bucket List, one has to consider how much less spectacular they might have been with a cast of lower caliber actors.  On the other hand, sometimes superior acting can save an otherwise dull or disappointing film.  As for Righteous Kill, even the combined skills of Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro could not hide the fact that the film's premise was far better than its execution.

Following the opening credits, we see DeNiro through a video camera confessing that he is a rogue cop who has killed fourteen people.  As his narration continues, we step back in time a short while where we are formally introduced to longtime partners Turk (DeNiro) and Rooster (Pacino).  They are obviously the best of friends, but DeNiro seems to be headed down a dark road with Pacino unable to stop him.  The story goes on to reveal that a serial killer is on the loose who leaves handwritten poems at every crime scene telling why each person was murdered.  Partners John Leguizamo and Donnie Wahlberg challenge the older detectives for the case, which eventually leads them to an odd suspicion.

The acting is good all around and the twist is sensational!  Unfortunately there are many other elements that interfere with the movie's overall impact.  First, the editing leaves much to be desired as many of the scenes appear to have been cut short, diminishing their potential to affect.  Second, the script contains a number of one-liners that make even these amazing actors come off sounding cheesy at times.  Third, the film drags at times because little time is spent developing the relationship between the leads.  (Heavies like these deserve and require a solid foundation in order to give the movie depth.)  Lastly, the final act is lame and predictable following the twist.

The best that can be said about Righteous Kill is that having Pacino and DeNiro together is awesome no matter what.  If you happen to be at the video store and nothing else is jumping out at you, then rent this film.  It does have its moments.

I would rather have seen them sink their teeth into something worthy of their early efforts and all we got was something that was worthy of their latest efforts which haven't been all that great. The movie had a really good cast and Carla Gugino looked great and super sexy as usual.

Example: DeNiro's character tried to play a turbocharged sex stud that was giving some other, younger female cop a good thrashing on a regular basis. DeNiro is about 70 years old in real life-- and looks it. Something went wrong in the casting department.

3146341,3,B0015OKWL2,"Righteous Kill is only the second pairing of two of cinema's greatest actors - Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. Their first on-screen collaboration, only featured them together in a couple of scenes, and left the public wanting more.

Righteous Kill has them playing NYC detective partners who've been on the job for 30 years. A serial killer start killing criminals who gotten off on technicalities. Soon, all the evidence points to the killer being a cop. And the cop would seem to be De Niro's character, Turk, a rough-edged type who isn't above falsifying evidence to convict suspects. He's balanced out by Pacino's Rooster, a calm, soothing influence on Turk in a relationship that seems as much like a marriage as it does a professional partnership. Added to the mix are John Leguizamo and Donnie Wahlberg as younger cops investigating the killings and Carlo Gugino as a forensic specialist in a relationship with DeNiro.

The movie works well as a police drama, less so as a mystery, although the solution of the killings does take some interesting turns. If two lesser actors were playing Turk and Rooster, the film might have been touted as asking interesting questions about the nature of friendships, partnerships, and romantic relationship amid all the stresses and strains of police work. But with De Niro and Pacino in tow, the viewer expects more, and doesn't necessarily get it with this film.

However, the two greats still know how to pull off great performance, and know how to elicit sympathy, affection, and every other possible emotion from an audience. Righteous Kill isn't a complete misfire, but might require a third teaming of these great actors.",1228003200,34,1670,4.978494623655914

But it seems the scriptwriter(s) tried to compensate out of fear perhaps or perhaps that is how the book was adapted by flashbacks and all sorts of deceptions - it was not necessary. I just wanted to see two cops in trouble and their emotions acted out by 2 brilliant actors. Which I did in part.

3146343,5,B0015OKWL2,"I have to be honest, Righteous kill is a good film but isn't really one that can be considered above the likes of their previous collaborations such as Heat or Godfather part 2, but it's one that's definitely worthy of praise. Righteous Kill tells the story of two aging cops, Turk (De Niro) & Rooster (Pacino) who seem ready for retirement. Before they can hand in their badges they're called in to investigate the murder of a notorious pimp which seems to have links to a case they solved years ago. As the story progresses a number of different murders are committed by what seems to be the same man and in a vigilante fashion. The killer is teasing the cops by leaving poetic calling cards with the victims, obituaries of sorts. As time rolls on and the killer continues to stay on the loose, a theory is developed that a cop is the serial killer which leads to suspicions that it's Turk committing the crimes.

This being a crime psychological thriller isn't anything fancy, it's not about the flashy shootouts or gory killing, it's not even about the sex or any form of violence. It's intelligent and it keeps you wondering until the very end of the movie. De Niro puts on a stellar performance and is only complemented by Pacino. They're not playing any characters they haven't played before, they're still the clich tough guy Italian Americans, but isn't that what we love them for? The twist at the end is also quite cool and in a way very unexpected. Throughout the film we're given snippets of Turks ""confession"" and we're honestly lead to believe it is really him committing the murders. Of course as is the tradition with films of this sort, Turk is not the killer but you will be genuinely shocked to find out who it is.

The supporting do their job and do their job well, but are only hampered in their performance when sharing screen time with either De Niro or Pacino. It's even quite pleasant to see Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson in a role that isn't the obnoxious rapper criminal, but is a criminal caught in the middle of a bigger investigation. The acting between the two main stars is stellar and the chemistry really works, it's a joy to see them perform together and in a way is quite a saddening affair to think this may be the last time we ever see these two greats share a movie screen. I sincerely hope it's not though.

All in all a really enjoyable film that touches on a good message of ""Is it right to kill those who have hurt or killed others?"" The notion of a Righteous Kill is an intelligent one, it touches on a subject that we all face when we look at criminals who don't get their punishment. We've all thought ""I can't wait until that guy gets what's coming to him"" and this film asks the quesion of, is it right? Maybe not, but it certainly made a worthwhile movie fun to watch.

I would firstly recommend you go and see it in the cinema, then, if you're completely satisfied I would buy it on DVD as it's truly worth it.",1224979200,7,2956,4.428308823529412
3146344,3,B0015OKWL2,"The situation in that film is too classical to be original. It is humdrum and it is not the trick of making us believe one of the two cops is the culprit whereas we discover at the end it is the other that is going to renew in anyway the genre and the interest of the film. Two aging actors reduced to their life-long tricks made easy by new technology. And it is not an allusion to the dirty cop of Clint Eastwood that is going to renew in any way the discourse and provide it with legitimacy. And finally it is not the cheating of the police institution that is going to present the final death of the ""justice-maker"" at the end and the bullets of his own team-mate as the fatal success of the dead officer to stop the crimes of the criminal he was, hence making the myth of that criminal true though it will have no body, no identity, no nothing that is changing the plot from mud to gold. We should have expected that flop with the title because there is absolutely no righteous kill because ""Thou shalt not kill"". It reveals nothing about cops, the police, law and order or anything else. It is just some kind of paycheck to two aging actors.

De Niro and Al Pacino co-star in a police procedural cop thriller.  They're partners and police detectives on the verge of retirement.  The two wind up with a major case.  Someone is hunting down people who have been acquitted, but still done the crime, and executing them.  Are Turk and Rooster still up for the job?  The answer, of course, is yes.  I liked this movie even though some might find it a little cynical.  Even as the two are investigating, two other detectives start investigating Turk as a suspect!

What makes this film memorable is not so much the plot and its twists, but the banter and interaction between Pacino and De Niro. They're just brilliant, sardonic and funny.  As one of the police says, ""They're like Lennon and McCartney.  Not an inch between them.""  Some people will think that the twists are cheating, but I don't think so.  It's clever and fits with the story.  The key to ""Righteous Kill,"" for me, was that Pacino's character, nicknamed Rooster, is a strategizing chess player.

3146346,5,B0015OKWL2,"I think people are misinterpreting the film. This isn't M Night Shyamalan. The flashbacks and ""twist"" in the end weren't supposed to be a shocker or a revelation. It was to make a point. The killer's identity is insignificant.

The story is about two police officers who went into the job with the best of intentions. They are by nature good men. The job and the ineffectiveness of the system weighs on them both and damages them both differently.

The killer's actions throughout the movie can be justified by the audience. We get to know the characters and grow to like them. It doesn't matter who the killer is because we've grown to care for them and it has been determined that the actions of the killer are forgivable. He killed murderers, rapists and pedophiles - people who deserved to die. The transition in the film is when the killer hurts an innocent. When he victimizes someone who doesn't deserve it, the revelation should happen. It isn't a hammer like hollywood is known for. It's more subtle.

Can you forgive him now? You know him. You like him. He had good intentions and his motive is understandable. Can you forgive him for what he did? Do you even care about the other character enough for it to bother you?

If you do forgive his character and like him in the end, is it fair to root for the demise of all of the 'bad guys' before. We didn't know their story. We didn't know their motives or intentions. They're a blank slate.

It's much easier to root for the death and destruction of those we do not know that commit heinous acts than those we do. That is the point.

Either man could have been the killer. It didn't matter. The ending flashback sequences were an explanation and nothing more. It wasn't intended to be a ""WOW"" moment. It was deeper than that.

I was blown away by the movie. It was a thought-provoking movie that pushes you to believe one way (that getting the bad guys is just) to completley having to readjust your thought process (well....rape is bad, but......)
That to me is much better than a cheap shocker. It's an unjustified compromise that one makes with themselves. For a film to do that is quite amazing.",1222473600,,2158,4.532133676092545

If anything, John Avnet's ""Righteous Kill"" showed us just how tired and worn out these two faded stars have become. The film was not able to emulate the electric chemistry the two actors shared 13 years ago in Mann's earlier film Heat (1995), which was so provocative and so moving that the sheer magnanimity of that famous 'coffee shop' scene heralded more than just a dream come true for movie fans; it was a love affair between two of the world's greatest living actors. In ""Righteous Kill"" on the other hand, we have a paunchy, tired looking De Niro and a gaunt, gravelly-voiced Pacino reduced to playing TV parodies of themselves with about as much chemistry as a mongoose paired with a rattlesnake.",1222300800,4,952,5.070063694267516
3146348,2,B0015OKWL2,"So, going into Righteous Kill last night, I knew who the killer was.  It wasn't that I've read spoilers or knew much of anything about the plot, except for what was shown in the trailers.  But it just seemed so obvious and I didn't expect the movie to be anything more than what I thought it was; i.e. needless.  However, watching the movie, I started thinking...hmmm, maybe the movie is smarter than I expected.  Maybe it won't be the most obvious person in the room and maybe they are actually trying to do something interesti--oh.  Nope.  It's who I originally thought it would be.  Bummer.

I guess I shouldn't have expected much out of the director who did 88 Minutes, but I was hoping it would be something surprising.  The beginning was certainly interesting; it caught my attention and had me going for a bit.  Unfortunately, as the film progressed, I started wishing it was over just so I could find out who the killer was.  Nothing that was happening was terribly interesting or insightful.

Most of the movie was about building a case against one of the characters and that's it; there's no real red herrings and you could probably piece together who's doing it rather quickly so that the ""plot twist,"" which might have been hip back in the early 90s or late 80s, is anything but. If you already know that the only possible suspect isn't the killer and the movie doesn't even pursue any other red herrings, then you have a boring film.  The only reason to go see this, as the trailer seems intent on letting you know, is to see Pacino and De Niro acting together.  But really, is that enough to make someone sit through a boring film?  If you're that hard-up to see them acting together, go watch Heat again.

3146349,3,B0015OKWL2,"Righteous Kill had, rightly so, fans across the globe salivating for a piece, the moment it was known that Jon Avnet was making a film, putting two of the most prolific and potentially explosive actors together, after Michael Mann attempted the same in ""Heat"", more than a decade ago.

However, it's a sad day when stalwarts such as Pacino and De Niro are pretty much wasted on an attempt as half-hearted and clearly under-prepared as this one. The movie takes on a potentially explosive subject matter (cop serial-killer!), and twists it into such a tight knot that even the climax isn't able to do much to undo the damage that an abject script, lackadaisical dialogue, and an unnecessarily twisting screenplay have done.

Pacino and De Niro play ageing NYPD homocide detectives, who are on the trail of a suspected serial killer who bumps off perps whom the law is unable to convict. Gradually, it becomes evident that the killer might be a Police Officer. It doesn't help understand the story that sequences in the movie are interspersed with De Niro's taped confession to all the murders, giving a detailed explanation and justification for all his supposed actions.

Naturally, sparks fly in all directions, and the story develops around this premise. However, the dynamite delivery that the hungry audience is looking out for is nowhere to be seen, for the actual delivery of both the actors is muted, toned down, and too small to be significant.

I fail to see why Avnet didn't develop the characters, or at least the background to the storyline, showing less of his editing skills and more of the actors' acting skills.

Overall, the movie has its good points and can't simply be written off as a complete failure; in fact, one of the reasons it's being made out to be such a failure all around is perhaps the fact that there are such high expectations from a Pacio / De Niro pairing.

The two officers have issues with their career choices and with their personal lives, especially women. In the late stages of their careers, the two officers are assigned to pursue a serial killer of criminals who have evaded punishment for their misdeeds.

The interaction between DeNiro and Pacino is adequately portrayed at best.  Unfortunately this interaction is not enough to save the movie. The story is told in an unnecessarily disorganized way and the pacing is slow. The scenes of city life, loneliness, grit, violence, and toughness that are essential to any noir movie or film of urban life are lacking. Photography and scenes are routine and uninspired. The result is dullness. These two fine actors, with memories of Taxi Driver and Raging Bull among other things, deserved better.

3146351,3,B0015OKWL2,"De Niro and Pacino are excellent actors and their abilities save this movie from being a total piece of Dreck. If the word F**K was deleted from the script there would be no screen play and if you deleted the profanity there would be no plot.  You wonder if Russell Gewirtz who wrote the screen play has a vocabulary larger than the average rapper.  The play is poorly written and not helped by pedestrian if not amateurish direction.  The close ups are too many and extremely unflattering to all of the actors -- especially Pacino and De Niro who are not young any longer and the director accentuates that. The lighting makes everyone's personal hygiene suspect which is exacerbated by the unkempt and unshaven appearance of the actors. I was especially annoyed by the highly implausible sex between De Niro and the female officer who could easily have been his granddaughter.  Then the S&M twist to this implausible love affair added nothing to the film.  The director (Avnet)and the screen play attempted to insert twists and surprises throughout the film but the plot was so transparent that these seemed amateurish.

Essentially this is a film about two teams of police detectives investigating a series of crimes that appear to be committed by a cop.  There is violence, sex, drugs, and blood galore, but as you can see not much of a plot.  However, the movie is entertaining and the surprise ending isn't very surprising.

De Niro gets to play Travis Bickle with a badge as a 30-year veteran of the NYPD who turns to vigilantism after too many of the suspects he arrests get off on technicalities.  Pacino is De Niro's longtime partner who seems unaware of what his fellow officer is up to on his off hours.

De Niro and Pacino are both pros enough not to embarrass themselves unduly during the course of the film, but they are hardly helped by an implausible screenplay (Russell Gewirtz) and claustrophobic direction (Jon Avnet), not to mention ugly photography and unflattering lighting that make them look even older and more haggard than they already are (do we really need this many tight close-ups of these former matinee idols at this late stage in their careers?).

Robert De Niro and Al Pacino play two grizzled veteran (""thirty plus years"") NYPD detectives who are investigating a series of vigilante-style killings of ""low lifes"" who escaped justice. The meandering trail may lead to a rogue cop.

3380629,3,B0015OKWL2,"""Righteous Kill"" draws the audience deep into a mystery that, in reality, isn't all that mysterious. While I can't say I predicted the big revelation at the end, I can say that I didn't find it too surprising, given the overtly misdirecting nature of the plot. Far be it from me to get way ahead of myself, but the truth is that the filmmakers want us to notice the mystery more than the characters, the story, or the even the setting. They took great pains to tease us with hidden messages, subtle clues, and clever camera angles that hide things from view; in the end, we're given an appropriate yet strangely unsatisfying plot twist, one that resolves the story but somehow doesn't do it justice. As for Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, they made the most of what they were given, meaning their performances were decent at best, complacent at worst. It's quite possible both are too good for a film like this.

This isn't to say that ""Righteous Kill"" is a gigantic miscalculation. Actually, it held my interest all the way through, despite the plot being very uneven at times. It tells the story of two veteran NYPD detectives--David ""Turk"" Fisk (De Niro) and Thomas ""Rooster"" Cowan (Pacino)--who aren't ready to retire, despite being partners on the force for over thirty years. They're sent to investigate the murder of a pimp, which, strangely enough, seems connected to a case they ""solved"" four years earlier, one involving a man suspected of murdering his girlfriend's young daughter. In this new case, the pimp was murdered even though he was only a suspect. Pretty soon, more people are found dead, each of them suspected of some heinous crime. Clearly, the NYPD has a vigilante on their hands, and what's worse, all signs point to this mysterious person being a cop. But who is it? And why is he or she leaving handwritten poems at every scene?

I don't think I can describe anymore of the plot without being annoyingly vague. Let's just say that what we're led to believe isn't necessarily what we should believe. All good mysteries work this way, and up to a point, ""Righteous Kill"" does a good job misleading the audience. Unfortunately, the ending wasn't everything it could have been. Even though the plot twist made sense within the context of the story, it wasn't the bombshell I had been expecting. To be fair, I'm well aware that some plot twists are too shocking for their own good; films like ""The Village"" and ""Hancock"" and ""Awake"" made revelations that, in my opinion, were over the top. It's one of those situations where you need perfect middle ground--not too weak, but not too strong, either.

It doesn't help that the performances were merely fair. Both De Niro and Pacino seem a little too comfortable in their roles, a little too relaxed given the material. Part of that can be blamed on the mindsets of their characters, both so numb after thirty years in the NYPD. But even then something feels incomplete. The tension between them and two suspicious detectives--Simon Perez (John Leguizamo) and Ted Riley (Donnie Wahlberg)--never feels as palpable as it should, and this is bad because they continuously antagonize Turk and Rooster. Their scenes feel restrained and underdeveloped, as if the actors were indifferent about their roles. This indifference is most noticeable in surveillance footage of Turk, which appears intermittently throughout the film; while I can't reveal why this footage is being shown, I can say that it features dialogue so clich, it's as if De Niro wasn't taking it seriously. Example: ""Most people respect the badge. Everyone respects the gun."" Another example, one that pretty much tells us the same thing: ""You don't become a cop to serve and protect. You do it because they let you carry a gun and a badge. You do it because you get respect.""

One of the better performances came from Carla Gugino. She plays Karen Corelli, who sleeps with Turk on a regular basis and demands to be treated roughly every time. There's a moment when she pressures Rooster for details about Turk beating up a suspect. Rooster, deciding to have a little fun, embellishes the story with outlandish descriptions, all of which Carla enjoys hearing. She felt the most genuine of all the characters in ""Righteous Kill."" At times, she's highly assertive, while at other times, she's greatly fearful. She, like most of the characters, tries to make sense of the situation as best she can, which to me seemed authentic. While hardly an extraneous character, it probably would have been a good idea to give her more screen time.

As for everyone else, it would have been a good idea for screenwriter Russell Gewirtz and director Jon Avnet to develop them a bit more. ""Righteous Kill"" is hardly a terrible movie, but at the same time, it's hardly a good one. It quickly sucks the audience into a mystery that keeps building, and then it spits it out as soon as the mystery is solved. There's no sense of satisfaction leaving the theater; there's only a sense of apathy. What a shame the twist ending failed to be so surprising. What an even bigger shame that Robert De Niro and Al Pacino seemed so blas about their performances. Both are wonderful actors, so I'm not inclined to blame them for holding back when they shouldn't have. I'm much more inclined to blame the filmmakers, not only for steering them in the wrong direction, but also for crafting a lackluster story with a less than impressive plot twist. Clearly, I'm having trouble getting over it.",1221350400,,5488,4.784810126582278
3380630,3,B0015OKWL2,"Righteous Kill is only the second pairing of two of cinema's greatest actors - Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. Their first on-screen collaboration, only featured them together in a couple of scenes, and left the public wanting more.

Righteous Kill has them playing NYC detective partners who've been on the job for 30 years. A serial killer start killing criminals who gotten off on technicalities. Soon, all the evidence points to the killer being a cop. And the cop would seem to be De Niro's character, Turk, a rough-edged type who isn't above falsifying evidence to convict suspects. He's balanced out by Pacino's Rooster, a calm, soothing influence on Turk in a relationship that seems as much like a marriage as it does a professional partnership. Added to the mix are John Leguizamo and Donnie Wahlberg as younger cops investigating the killings and Carlo Gugino as a forensic specialist in a relationship with DeNiro.

The movie works well as a police drama, less so as a mystery, although the solution of the killings does take some interesting turns. If two lesser actors were playing Turk and Rooster, the film might have been touted as asking interesting questions about the nature of friendships, partnerships, and romantic relationship amid all the stresses and strains of police work. But with De Niro and Pacino in tow, the viewer expects more, and doesn't necessarily get it with this film.

However, the two greats still know how to pull off great performance, and know how to elicit sympathy, affection, and every other possible emotion from an audience. Righteous Kill isn't a complete misfire, but might require a third teaming of these great actors.",1221264000,2,1670,4.978494623655914
3380631,3,B0015OKWL2,"This was a pretty good cop film. Turk and Rooster have been partners for 30 years, then some killings happen in the same way a killer had done a few years back and Turk and Rooster stopped him.

3380632,2,B0015OKWL2,"This film was entirely unsatisfying from beginning to end. An awesome cast from top to bottom (except for 50 Cent) but just a weak, predictable story with no delivery to speak of.

I hate saying this about a movie with two legendary and, more often than not, specatacular actors but 20 minutes into the movie I was looking at my watch waiting for it to be over. Less than 40 minutes into the movie I had the whole plot ""twist"" figured out which says something because I'm normally somewhat dull-whitted when it comes to crime solving shows. Let's just say they didn't make it difficult to solve this one.

The lovely and talented Carla Gugino plays the love/sex interest of DeNiro with some pretty strange likings (of which no explaintions are ever offered). It's almost like her role in the movie was an afterthought.

Also, who the @#$% told 50 Cent that he could act??????????? I almost got up and walked out of the movie house as soon as his worthless @$$ showed on screen.

This one gets two instead of one only because DeNiro & Pacino were in the same film. I wish they would've wasted the script on lesser talent because this piece of crap is gonna rake in the dough just because of the marquis.

Don't even waste a Netflix rental on this film. Get a good crime mystery like ""The Usual Suspects"".",1221264000,,1303,4.504237288135593

3380669,4,B0015OKWL2,"""Righteous Kill"" hasn't been all that well-received -- Rotten Tomatoes is down on it -- but it seems to me at least as good as two other movies I've seen lately that were better received: ""Stand-Up Guys"" and ""The Departed.""  I liked the latter, but it was a bit bloated, and one wonders whether Scorsese's name got it more credit that it deserved.  ""Stand-Up Guys"" was quirkier, but gave Al Pacino a bit more opportunity to chew the scenery.  In all three, though, I wouldn't fault the acting -- such problems as there are are more with script and pacing, and I actually quite enjoyed all three.  ""Righteous Kill"" is very strongly cast, with Pacino, De Niro, Leguizamo, Donnie Wahlberg, Dennehy, Curtis Jackson (aka 50 Cent), and Carla Gugino.  All of them do good work.  The plot is very clever, and the mode of narration, which is a complicated form of flashback, is well-handled.  The limitations of the movie are the limitations of the genre, which as some reviewers have commented, aren't all that different from the limitations of, say, ""Law and Order"" episodes, but ""L&A"" was a solid show, and so is this.  Also, it comes in at well under two hours, and packs a lot of incident into that time frame.

The plot is clever, and I want to avoid spoilers, so I'll say no more than that it's a serial-killer search movie and that it puts a lot of weight on conflicts within a police department, where two different teams of cops (Pacino/De Niro and Leguizamo/Wahlberg) are working aspects of the same case (or cases, given that serial killing is the issue) and taking different views of the case.  Brian Dennehy is underused as their boss, and Carla Gugino is a forensics detective with whom they all interact and who is in many ways the most interesting character in the movie.  What makes her interesting becomes clear quite early, but I won't spoil your discovery of it in case you haven't seen the movie yet.

I wonder if some of the disappointment in the movie has to do with seeing De Niro and Pacino together (for the first time, really, for they hardly interacted in ""Heat"") in a movie that is pretty generic.  Both have played in cop-thrillers before, and while they are given some personality quirks in the script that individualize them reasonably interestingly, these roles are hardly a stretch for either of them.  That said, they are very effective.  Neither one seems to be ""dialing it in,"" so there's real pleasure in seeing two old pros going at it -- a bit like the pleasure of seeing Alan Arkin, Pacino, and Walken in ""Stand-Up Guys.""  Yes, it would be nice to see ""King Lear"" with De Niro and Pacino as Lear and Gloster -- certainly a better script and more room to dig into character there -- but that's not going to happen, so we take what we can get and enjoy it for what it is.  Pacino's natural flamboyance is still there but well subordinated to the demands of characterization, and older De Niro's taciturnity is likewise familiar and yet given a twist.  All in all, it's not a great movie, but it's very far from a disaster.",1422144000,,3053,4.580882352941177

3380699,5,B0015OKWL2,"""Righteous Kill"" is great! This is how the story goes: A pair of veteran New York City police detectives are on the trail of a vigilante serial killer. After 30 years as partners in the pressure cooker environment of the NYPD, highly decorated Detectives David 'Rooster' Fisk and Thomas 'Turk' Cowan should be ready for retirement, but aren't. Before they can hang up their badges, they are called in to investigate the murder of a notorious pimp, which appears to have ties to a case they solved years before. Like the original murder, the victim is a suspected criminal whose body is found accompanied by a four line poem justifying the killing. When additional crimes take place, it becomes clear the detectives are looking for a serial killer, one who targets criminals that have fallen through the cracks of the judicial system. His mission is to do what the cops can't do on their own--take the culprits off the streets for good. The similarities between the recent killings and their earlier case raise a nagging question: Did they put the wrong man behind bars?

The cast led by Robert De Niro (as Turk) & Al Pacino (as Rooster) is excellent! The directing by Jon Avnet (who has produced movies, such as, ""Risky Business"" (1983), and directed and also produced movies, such as, ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" (1991), and most recently, did ""88 Minutes"" (2008, which also starred Pacino) is excellent! The story and screenplay by Russell Gewirtz (who also wrote ""Inside Man"" (2006) & its possible upcoming sequel in 2010) is excellent!

The music by Ed Shearmur (who also did the music to the upcoming ""Passengers"" (2008) and the recent ""88 Minutes"") is excellent! The cinematography by Denis Lenoir (who also did the cinematography to ""88 Minutes"") is excellent! The film editing by Paul Hirsch (who won the Oscar for his work in ""Ray"" (2004) is excellent! The casting by Nancy Klopper (who also did the casting to ""Risky Business"") is excellent! The production design by Tracey Gallacher (who also did the production design to ""88 Minutes"") is excellent! The art direction by Christina Ann Wilson (who is doing the art direction to the upcoming ""Shutter Island"" (2009) & ""Alice In Wonderland"" (2010) is excellent! The set decoration by Kathy Lucas (who is doing the set decoration to the upcoming ""The Ugly Truth"" (2009) is excellent! The costume design by Debra McGuire (who also did the costume design to ""Redbelt"" (2008), and was also Pacino's wardrobe designer on ""88 Minutes"") is excellent!

This is an excellent action-thriller that keeps you thinking and on the edge of your seat. This is an excellent reunion for De Niro and Pacino, 13 years since ""Heat"" (1995). Their roles in this movie couldn't be any different than they were in ""Heat"".",1369526400,,2749,4.894849785407725

Working again with Pacino and with the special added bonus teaming Pacino and De Niro again for the first time since Michael Mann's 1992 crime thriller, Heat. The two play disenchanted, seasoned police detectives who are all too familiar with the fact that violent criminals they worked so hard to nail are allowed to go free. Both men are enraged by this. The character De Niro plays allows his brute anger to show outwardly, while Pacino's character(Rooster) Keeps the same feelings inside and calmly deals with it as best he can. Then things come to a head when a child killer is also allowed to go free because of a legal technicality, the two men frame the ""Mutt"" for a crime he didn't commit. During this ""crossing the line"" choice they make the two are assigned to investigate a series of vigilante murders, the targets whom are some of these scum bags that were allowed to go free. Upon seeing the first victim of the killer at the crime scene, Rooster can't help but comment concerning the killer, ""They should give the guy a medal"". Their investigations lead them to discover that the person responsible for the killings may be a cop. But this doesn't matter to the audience because from the very begining, the movie tells us who the killer is. None the less despite that there is a surprise ending that will knock your socks off. This film is well made and hardly resembles the very bad 88 minutes John Avnet directed just before this one. This film is not a great picture but it is a pretty damned good one. One side note though. I did feel that John Leguizamo, a very good actor who has had much bigger parts was under-used in this film. All in all Pacino, De Niro, Leguizamo, Dennehy, and Wahlberg were all great. And this film is good enough to be considered a very good but not righteous movie.",1368144000,,1971,4.634285714285714

Following some NYPD detectives who are tracking down a vigilante cop this film has very few surprises and you can guess the ending from about twenty minutes in. The acting is ok, but not great and although both De Niro and Pacino are legendary actors, they always feels a bit stilted and lacking of any conviction in this film. The storyline is sadly unoriginal and without any great shocks or twists, but it does keep you engaged for the 90 minutes duration. Any longer and you'd get restless though. For all it's flaws this film is not that bad overall and when you want an easy evenings viewing, where you don't have to think too hard, then this is a pretty good place to go.

But great actors can't do anything about a bad script and being cast in parts they should no longer take on. Deniro has crossed over into comedy (Analyze This) and has been hilarious.

3380727,3,B0015OKWL2,"I had really high hopes for this film, and that may be why I was ultimately disappointed.  Pacino and De Niro are iconic actors, and their performances here are top notch - for what they had to work with.  The film's writer says in the extras, ""I decide upon the twist and then build the movie backward from there"" and that sums up my problem with the movie.  The twist was predictable, and there wasn't enough substance beyond that to take it to the next level.  The entire story is a set-up for the twist, and the pacing of the film is very slow.

Someone is killing bad guys; the trailers and opening let the viewer know it's either Pacino or De Niro. The film jumps from one vigilante killing to the next, showing how the partners were involved or knew the ""victims.""  There was a bit of surprise in the fall out (not who did it, but the why and what happens next) once the vigilante is revealed, but not enough for all the build-up.  Still, I gave it three stars because these two actors, and many fine supporting ones, are riveting to watch.  Pacino and De Niro are perfectly cast as jaded cops who keep doing the job because it's all they are made to do.  They have that certain quality that made Jerry Orbach so beloved on Law & Order.  Despite them being so famous, I still became lost in their roles. I knew who the killer was, and I kept watching to the end to see what these two would do with that knowledge.  Overall, this was a good drama but it could have been classic.  Recommended for fans of cop dramas, or of Pacino and De Niro.

The DVD has two featurettes, and a commentary.  One featurette is a making of, and well worth watching.  I particularly liked how the cast and crew were so in awe of working with the two heavy weight stars.  Nice to know audiences aren't the only ones star-struck! The other is a kind of documentary on ""bad"" cops, but I found it very biased and quite negative.  They were stretching trying to tie it into the film and it showed.  Overall, decent extras for a single disc edition.",1282521600,,2029,4.308707124010554
3380728,2,B0015OKWL2,"Robert De Niro and Al Pacino are in one movie. You know, much awaited team-up of two legendary actors should be big news for many movie fans, and, actually, it was when Michael Mann made very intense thriller ""Heat"" back in 1995, even though they are together on screen only in one scene. (The two actors were both in ""The Godfather Part II,"" but they didn't share a scene.) Now I finally saw ""Righteous Kill"" starring Robert De Niro and Al Pacino (credited that order), and though their acting is worth the price for DVD, the film itself turned out disappointing to me.

For ""Righteous Kill"" is not really successful as a thriller, or anything else. In this crime thriller directed by Jon Avnet (""Fried Green Tomatoes"" ""88 Minutes""), Robert De Niro and Al Pacino play hot-tempered ""Turk"" and cool ""Rooster"" respectively, two veteran NYPD detectives. There is a vigilante-type serial killer at large, leaving a poem at the crime scenes. To investigate the murder cases Turk and Rooter have to work with Simon Perez (John Leguizamo) and Ted Riley (Donnie Wahlberg), a team of younger detectives, whom the veteran detectives seem to dislike.

From the very outset Jon Avnet's storytelling falters, partly because he fails to provide a viewpoint from which audiences can follow the plot in a logical way. ""Righteous Kill"" suffers from the muddled storyline, thinly developed characters (script by Russell Gewirtz of ""Inside Man"" fame), and its clumsily paced narrative. Yes, there are twists and turns along the way, but most audiences would lose interest by the time they reach the conclusion.

In addition to the two stars, obviously the best assets of the film, ""Righteous Kill"" has interesting cast including Curtis Jackson, Brian Dennehy, Carla Gugino, Trilby Glover and Melissa Leo. Sadly they are all wasted. After all this film is helmed by the director who did incredibly bad thriller ""88 Minutes."" As to the much-anticipated team-up of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, I strongly recommend you watch ""Heat"" again and forget anything about this one.",1276387200,,2052,4.994152046783626
3380729,2,B0015OKWL2,"That's the sound of my hopes and expectations deflating.  Not to say that RIGHTEOUS KILL is a complete and utter disappointment (I guess it was worth borrowing for free from my local library), but I can't help but feel that it could have been so much more.

One look at the cast and you have to think, ""How can this be a miss?""  I mean, they could have just named this film ""DeNiro & Pacino"" and it probably would have done better at the box office.  Throw in the bonus talents of John Leguizamo, Donnie Wahlberg, and the normally riveting Brian Dennehy and you should have sure-fire cinematic gold, right?

By and large, the talents of the actors listed above are not fleshed out in any compelling fashion.  I lay this squarely at the feet of director Jon Avnet, who somehow compiled a stellar cast and was unable to coax much emotion out of any of them.  They pretty much sleepwalk and mumble through the scenes, and the ""live-wire"" ones are devoid of passion even as the actors are shouting at each other.  I was largely unmoved by the characters and found myself growing annoyed by the near constant saturation of nearly every paragraph with the F-bomb with nothing to back it up.  I was especially disappointed by the passionless performance of Dennehy, whose trademark sneer and undulating fury have been substituted with a smirk and mild annoyance - a truly wasted opportunity to crank up the temperature on a potential potboiler.

The script didn't help Avnet's cause, either.  Truly bizarre character relationships (a coroner and detective who work together have a largely emotionless but physically rough sexual affair that adds absolutely no intrigue or interest to the story) and out of place characters (Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson's scenes seemed to be only an excuse to get him on screen) only muddy the already strained performances.  The back cover quotes Larry King as saying the film has ""a twist at the end that will blow you away.""  Larry King must not watch too many movies these days, as most seasoned viewers should have it figured out with 30-40 minutes to go.

The DVD includes a couple of approximately 15 minute featurettes that were mildly interesting.  ""The Thin Blue Line: An Exploration of Cops & Criminals"" is produced just like something off Court TV, and could easily have been expanded to an hour (or heck, a series).  Unfortunately, it too falls short.  Literally.

In good conscience, I can only recommend this film to hard-core fans of the cop-film genre.  DeNiro and Pacino fans will find far better performances elsewhere.

Actually, Cugino is so strong in this role, I'm convinced she should have played Pacino's part! Although the character she did play is pivotal to the plot resolution, it still is one which strains credulity: a Cop who loves to bed Cops and other guys who perform dangerous tasks. It would have been more interesting if she played a kind of recovering ""call girl"" who tries *not* to fall in love with her favorite client.

3380735,4,B0015OKWL2,"De Niro and Pacino don't disappoint as a pair of hardened, slightly ""off-kilter"" cops with DeNiro, in particular, appearing to be a head case, a character whose interest in police work, it's strongly implied, is directly traceable to a strong, explosive, sado-masochistic strain in his relation not just to the bad guys but to authority and women.  The problem with the film is the length to which it goes (""whatever it takes"") to hook the viewer and keep him snapping at the bait.

All films are manipulative, but problems arise when the manipulation is totally contrary to the viewer's expectations and trust.  It's one thing to see a sci-fi space fantasy in 3-D (in which case, I say ""make me a passenger on your psychedelic roller coaster--sweep me into some other world or orbit""), but it's quite another to confront what is represented as a ""realistic"" police drama, purporting, moreover, to take us into the psyches of the main characters.  In this latter case, we as viewers have no choice but to invest our trust in the director and his devices--above all in the accuracy of the fictive world along with the boundaries and signposts that have been established as standards of judgment,  enabling the viewer to make sense of the characters and the ""reality"" they function in.  Unfortunately, in the case of ""Righteous Kill"" that trust is totally violated.

 When a film opens with a character giving a testimony, as if under oath, then that same character necessarily comes to serve as our sole reference for the reliability, or ""verisimilitude,"" of the world of the film.  He becomes our eyes, our standard of reference, our ""point of view"" in place of the objective camera lens.  If at the end of the film, that character suddenly tells us that he's lied to us from the first frame, we may not exactly have cause to ask for a refund (all great fiction amounts to a ""lie that tells the truth""), but we do have a right to feel, if not betrayed, a trifled disappointed and irritated.  Imagine Jane Austen saving the last sentence of ""Pride and Prejudice"" for a statement such as: ""By the way, everything I've just written about Elizabeth Bennett in the foregoing 300 pages is a complete lie.  She's a horrible person who can be expected to behave toward Darcy as Lady Macbeth did to Macbeth.""

Manipulation is one thing (Wayne Booth, a former teacher of mine, calls it the ""rhetoric of fiction""), but outright deception feels less like influencing or even tricking the witness (i.e. you and me) than plain and simple ""cheating.""  In a good movie (Hitchcock is always a reliable example) the director and the viewer are engaged in a game, or even a contest, the spectator getting many of his kicks from trying to stay a step ahead of the director.  It can be fun, even exhilarating, entertainment--you win a few, you lose a few.  But say the director--for example, Billy Wilder at the end of ""Double Indemnity""--suddenly reveals that everything you've heard from Fred MacMurray is the exact opposite of the story you ""thought"" you had just heard.  That's not mere ""manipulation"": that's substituting another movie for the one you've just seen!  (Reminds me of Humphrey Bogart and the ""African Queen"" making a brief appearance in the desert in Bing Crosby-Bob Hope's ""Road to Bali.""  But in that instance, our expectations have been conditioned to accept such absurdities. In the case of ""Righteous Kill,"" I wasn't adequately prepared to expect the same sorts of absurdities.  You might even say that the ""righteous"" one is the director, who self-servingly abuses his authority (or ""author""-ship) in what amounts to a regrettable ""breach of trust"" from the viewer's point of view.

Why 4 stars?  Frankly, I'm not sure (you're free to go much lower, or even higher).  The film did hold my interest, and it had me guessing throughout, with some juicy Hitchcock-worthy red herrings (until the very end, when I felt like I'd been watching the wrong movie).  Moreover, Deniro and Pacino are great actors individually and collectively, and both are on their game; both ""age well"" and, if the script deserves some blame, it should not be at the expense of the actors.  Finally, I would rather be lied to by an otherwise intelligent movie than patronized and insulted. Too many movies are formulaic commodities designed, with Pavolian, formulaic, marketplace certainty, to empty the consumer's wallet.  ""Righteous Kill"" never stoops that low.

Finally, one of the respected, ""classic"" films of all time--hated by the Marxist director Eisenstein but practically serving as the prototype of German psychoanalytic cinema--is ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.""  It pulls much the same trick as ""Righteous Kill,"" waiting until the film's final moment to reveal that the film's narrator, in whom we as spectators have necessarily placed our trust, is in fact a mad man in an insane asylum.  What's the difference?  Is there a difference?  For one thing, whereas Caligari gives us an apparently sane narrator who proves a lunatic, ""Righteous Kill"" gives us an apparently semi-pathological narrator who, ultimately, proves an ""all right"" kind of guy.

Perhaps the main difference is that ""Caligari"" has a message about an insane, paranoid, totalitarian world: it's use of the deceptive narrator is integral with, if not crucial to, that message.  The film seems to want us to recognize the wolf in sheep's clothing or, in this instance, the pending Hitler who at first seems so seductively rational.  ""Righteous Kill,"" on the other hand, has no such message--or, if one insists, the film says no more than ""guys who seem sinister, tough or plain nasty can turn out O.K. if you wait until the end of the movie.""  Similar, perhaps, to ""Caligari"" but not quite the same--and not quite enough.",1262908800,,5774,4.929752066115703

3380739,3,B0015OKWL2,"Apart from the cast, there's really very little to separate this from a whole slew of straight to DVD thrillers.  Which makes it all the more a mystery why DeNiro and Pacino chose this as their next vehicle to star in together, having created such screen heat in.. well, Heat.
DeNiro and Pacino are both cops, both veterans (well, they'd have to be wouldn't they...) who end up investigating a vigilante serial killer.  As the clues start to appear, suspicion grows that the killer is in fact a cop.. so who can be trusted, and just who is telling the truth...?
Well, that's the set up, but it's great potential is somehow fumbled.  The tag line of `the two best actors alive at the top of their game' is certainly somewhat overstated, but the fault does not lie there - rather it is in a weak story directed in such a straight forward way that red herrings are just rather too obvious.  It's really not that bad, and has its own stylistic flourishings along the way - however it is also not half as clever as it seems to think it is, and the ending is unlikely to surprise anyone.  Fortunately it is only 97 minutes so does not overstay its welcome too long.. certainly bearable for an undemanding watch, but when you factor in the disappointment factor of having two such great stars so sorely underused, this would come down a notch to a two star movie...",1258675200,,1358,4.459677419354839
3380740,3,B0015OKWL2,"With two screen legends, RIGHTEOUS KILL is like watching Ali and Frazier take each other on, long after their prime.  Deniro is no longer the man he was in Raging Bull and Cape Fear, while Pacino holds steady in another grizzled veteran role.  The missed opportunity here was to not give these two men more unique and dynamic roles - they had to be of all things, casted as old cops - which isn't so challenging.  They both wear the role well, but you sense they're doing it easily in spite of the movie's twists.

Their previous pairing HEAT had only one scene with the two greats, but was a lot more exciting.  Less thriller and more a character study, RIGHTEOUS KILL is watchable, but it doesn't raise your adrenaline.  It's like watching the cops go toe-to-toe but never quite landing that KO punch.

The casting is strong, but with so many strong cop shows these days - there's no point in making these guys product.  Deniro and Pacino can offer so much more - if you challenge them.  That's what the studios should do.  I'm hoping their next time out won't be a Walter Mattheau and Jack Lemmon kind of pairing.

RIGHTEOUS KILL isn't bad.  It just isn't great.  But it does give fans a chance to see two actors tango together which I believe was partly the point.",1258416000,2,1268,4.460869565217391

~ Look what they've done to your song.""

Alas, Al Pacino *was* a great actor.  This man (ecco homo!) this man was, at one time, The Prince of the City -- New York *and* Hollywood!

Lemme tell ya a story ...

There was this kid I grew up with.  He was younger than me.  Sorta looked up to me.  You know, short guy.  We did our first work together; worked our way out of the street.  Things were good, we made the most of it.  During the 60s we schtupped Tuesday Weld.  Me first, then Al.

The 70s, we ran tye-dye shirts into Canada.  Made a fortune.  Mr. Pacino, his father, too.

As much as anyone, I loved him; and trusted him.  (About as far as I could throw the Empire State Building.  But that's another story.)

Later on he had an idea.  To build a theatre out of paper mache and put on productions like ""Richard the Third Gets a Hickey."" ... ""A Streetcar Named Shecky"" ... ""The Merchant of Venice Goes to the Catskills On His Way to the West Coast, The Clueless Schmuck.""

And that kid's name was Al Pacino.  And the theatre he founded here in New York City was the Max Bialystock Vernal Equinox Gardens.

This was a great wop.  A paisan of vision and guts, and there isn't even a plaque, or a signpost or a statue of him in this town!

Someone put an Ex-Lax in his gabaghoul sandwich. (Crapped for weeks.)  No one knows who placed the order.  When I heard about it, I wasn't angry.  True, I laughed my ass off.  But I wasn't angry.

I knew Al, I knew he was head-strong; I knew over the years he had built up a tolerance to laxatives: farting loud, saying stupid flatulent things.  So when he turned up with an overflowing enema bag (tic), I let it go.  And I said to myself (tic): this is the show biz-a-niece we Italians have chosen.  I didn't ask (tic) ""Who placed the gabaghoul order?"" because it had nothing to do (tic) with biz-a-niece!

Now I'm going in to take a nap.  I had a peppers and sausheech sandwich that's laying right here, like a rock.  When I wake, if Tuesday Weld in on the table ready to go, I'll know my prostate has a chance.  If not, I'll know I don't.",1257897600,,2318,4.080357142857143

3380746,4,B0015OKWL2,"Before I saw this thriller, I kept hearing many mixed reviews about it. From James Berardinelli to [...], most found it very average. I finally got a chance to watch this Righteous Kill, but with very moderate expectations. After the film was over, I found myself liking it. Not loving it, but liking it. It wasn't great, but it wasn't terrible, either. It was . . . between average and above average.

I think I'll start with the bad. I'm not a fan of Curtis Jackson (50 Cent), so I knew right away that his acting was wooden and dull. He doesn't even say most of his lines right; it sounds a bit like gibberish to me. Now, if Christopher Bridges (LUDA!) played Jackson's part, then it would have been far more engaging. Also, throughout the film, there are numerous cliches that we've all seen before (good cop bad cop, for example). If there was even a hint of originality, I would have given it a higher rating. The third flaw we have here is the plot twist. We already know that Turk (played by De Niro) is not the killer, so the major twist at the end wasn't shocking enough. Then, we have the script, which isn't really Grade A material. Some of the dialogue was pretty cheesy, and some scenes felt very uneven. And lastly, the sex scenes . . . they were very out-of-place and very unnecessary.

Now, here's the good. First we have De Niro and Pacino. I mean, DE NIRO & PACINO! In the classic film Heat, they were only onscreen together for about ten minutes. Here, these two guys share the screen almost throughout the movie. And although, as I mentioned before, the script is pretty average, De Niro and Pacino deliver their lines very well. The supporting cast (Dennehy, Wahlberg, Gugino, and Leguizamo) do a very fine job as well. Finally, there are a bit of references to Heat that can be found here, and while they are a bit too obvious, they're mildly decent at best.

Again, this is a thriller that's not great and not horrible. I give it a B- because, even though there were some crappy moments, it's still fun to watch Pacino and De Niro interact with each other. Jon Avnet is a good director, but he could have given a lot of things here some improvement. I hope he gets to make far more sophisticated films in the future.",1252886400,,2240,4.432038834951456

3380753,3,B0015OKWL2,"Actors of the stature of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino deserve to have the best offered to them. Unfortunately it seems that actors in their age bracket rarely receive those phone calls. Instead they are offered roles that are decent enough but nowhere near those they played before, roles that helped them gain the notoriety that they now enjoy. Such is the case with RIGHTEOUS KILL.

De Niro and Pacino play NYPD detectives Tom ""Turk"" Cowan and David ""Rooster"" Fisk. As the film opens we see what is apparently a confession by Cowan to the murder of 14 victims beginning 4 years prior. From there the film moves into flashback mode and the tale unfolds.

At that time a suspect in a murder case is released due to insufficient evidence. Everyone knows he did it, but he still gets off. In an attempt to see justice done, Fisk plants a gun taken from evidence in the suspect's bedroom while Cowan at first attempts to stop him then lets it happen. This results in the suspect being arrested and convicted of a murder he did not commit, but at least justice is done, right?

Moving forward to just weeks before the film's opening sequence, the duo is staking out a club run by an up and coming rap artists named Spider. Witnessing a woman named Jessica using cocaine in the club, the pair plan on running a sting operation to take Spider and his drugs off the street. With the help of their less than willing witness, they plant a listening device on her and send her in to set up Spider. But Spider realizes what is happening and with the possible threat of violence, the pair breaks in to stop him. Caught in their own bit of entrapment, a shoot out follows and Jessica is shot as is Spider's bodyguard.

The case is blown. Procedure was not followed and an arrest, let alone a conviction, is not about to happen in the foreseeable future. Spider walks.

As the film progresses, various other cases come to the attention of Cowan and Fisk. At each one a poem is left with the body. It seems they have a vigilante serial killer on the loose and he's taking out various suspects who were let off from the crimes they committed due to technicalities. As they look deeper into the case, both men come to the conclusion that the perpetrator to the crime could be someone who works on the police force.

With few leads to follow and never knowing who to trust, the pair continue their investigation. The only people they feel they can trust are each other. But after hours drinks and a few secrets let lose make both men realize that the other is not quite who they thought them to be. Fisk always looked up to Cowan as his hero, his inspiration. And Cowan always thought of Fisk as a stand up guy he could count on. Both men end the film in disappointment.

As the culmination of their investigation comes to a close, the setting drops back to Spider's club. With Spider in the mix as well as the gun toting thugs he hires to protect him, you can be sure a shooting is in the mix.

Prior to the final moments of the film, most movie lovers will guess who the killer is. But that doesn't mean I'll spoil it for those who don't. Both actors seem to be walking through these roles without a ton of enthusiasm. It doesn't lessen what they have to offer, but one would think after waiting for just the right movie to be able to work together again in they would have found something a bit better than this.

Which is odd. Because while the film may not meet the standards I have in my own mind for these actors, it is actually a relatively decent film. The story seems as if it could happen and the possibility of someone going off the end after years of watching suspects set free is plausible enough, though one hopes it's never happened.

The rest of the cast include 50 Cent as Spider, Carla Gugino as Karen Corelli (Cowan's love interest), John Leguizamo and Donnie Wahlberg as fellow detectives and Brian Dennehy as the their supervisor. All turn in well done performances and it's nice to see Dennehy on screen again.

Is this movie worth renting and watching? Certainly. It's far better than a number of films released. Is it worth adding to your collection? I would say for die hard fans of the two actors only. Anything either of them decides to do make their performances worth watching. They elevate things they are in. This movie doesn't drop their standing in the least.",1247356800,,4375,4.45625

While watching her so called comedy, I kept thinking, is THAT what she picked up for her come back? While watching Righteous Kill with De Niro and Pacino, for almost every of its very long 103 minutes I thought, you guys better enjoy retirement than choose the project like this.

Why are the ending results of both attempts so disappointing? Why do we have the comedy that is not funny and the thriller that does not thrill. Watching Richteous Kill, You would think that the union of two brilliant actors would save a weak, mediocre, simply not interesting in all departments picture but it did not happen. Instead of following rather predictable plot, I kept looking at the actors who have given us so many moments of joy and thinking to myself, no, it is not Serpico, nor ...And Justice for All, no Taxi Driver, nor Heat, nor The Sea of Love. What was it? What about the twists that I figured after ten minutes into the movie? What was about the ending that easily could win an award for the most ridiculous, preposterous, and stupidest scene that involves two Oscar winners ever. I love Crime /Thriller/Mystery mixed with the drama. Those are among my favorites and I am not too picky. As long as the movie is clever, well acted, keeps me guessing and entertains me, I am happy. It is not the case with Righteous Kill, and even two stars can't save it. Ironically, the most memorable scene for me was De Niro (Turk) quoting Dirty Harry, ""There's nothing wrong with a little shooting, as long as the right people get shot."" It made me think about Clint Eastwood. How did he manage to direct himself last year in his own film at the age of 78, and to make it a fantastic poignant movie that obviously salutes to his most beloved character Dirty Harry Callahan, tells the story in the best traditions that seem lost nowadays, and ends on a high and moving note. The film with two great actors should be a cinematic event, not a laughing stock. I'd suggest De Niro and Pacino contact Eastwood and try to do a movie together or even crazier idea - to remake Righteous Kill with Woody Allen or Brothers Coen.

*Spoilers*

I really wanted to like Righteous Kill. I love ambiguous morality dramas like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Brave-One/dp/B0010HOZW6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Brave One</a>, and was looking forward to seeing the psychology behind a police vigilante - what motivates him (revenge? justice? protection? disgust? anger?) and whether or not we would agree with his motives, if not his methods. With Pacino and De Niro, I was sure I couldn't be disappointed. In the end, I was both right and wrong. I was disappointed with the movie, but not with the acting. It was the ham-fisted plot that did it for me.

The movie starts out, promisingly enough, with De Niro performing a voice-over, video-taped confession - explaining why he murdered his victims, what motivated him, how he chose them. We flash back to 'the beginning' and are treated to the stereotypical long standing cop-partnership: De Niro is the hot-head and Pacino is the mediator, calming him down and keeping him out of trouble. Pacino cleans up De Niro's messes and holds the deep tenderness and understanding that seems to characterize long marriages and cop partnerships.

As De Niro explodes repeatedly over various incidents ranging from disputed baseball plays and criminals walking free on court technicalities, the savvy movie goer begins to find themselves on the edge of a doubt. As De Niro sweats under the inquiring gaze of the other police officers and seems constantly on the verge of discovery, it hits us between the eyes that De Niro can't be the killer, because he's just too obvious a set-up. The voice-over confession, the constant raging temper, the internal investigation: all these are so blatant, obvious, and ham-fisted that we realize, long before we are supposed to, that the killer must be Pacino because, well, De Niro is just too obvious.

This is irritating. As an avid movie-watcher, I expect twists, sure, but the twist shouldn't be set-up so obvious that it's being shoved in your face. When the entire movie seems to be one long shout of ""De Niro is the killer!! De Niro is the killer!!"", then the movie-goer is forced to switch gears from the subtle intricacies of vigilantism and into the teeth-grinding, ""Well, who is the REAL killer?"" mode. Let's see, it can't be De Niro because he's too obvious. It can't be his girlfriend because she's there to be a sex object and a victim, and not anything so glamorous as The Killer. (Which is a shame, because it would have been an interesting twist, with Pacino thinking that De Niro is the killer and covering for him, only to find that he had misjudged his partner all this time.) Nope, it's got to be Pacino because he's a headline name and his character is charming and patient, which is an extremely suspicious thing to be in these sorts of movies.

After the viewer is slammed in the fact with the ""twist"" thirty minutes ahead of schedule, all interest is lost. The movie isn't really about exploring vigilantism, or delving into the psyche of someone who witnesses daily horrors - it's about finding out that Pacino is the real killer. Having already let that slip via the ham-fisted set-up of De Niro, there's nothing much left to do but let it grind down to the end.

3380762,3,B0015OKWL2,"Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro play two long-time NYC detectives who have been partners for years. DeNiro's Turk has a hair-trigger temper and definite issues with anger management. He's counterbalanced by Pacino's Rooster who's an easygoing, funloving guy. Both are tracking a serial killer who's murdering criminals who have not been convicted due to technicality glitches. The investigation points to a cop (this brought up by Rooster) which Turk adamantly refuses to believe. Brian Dennehy (another great actor) has a peripheral role as their boss. Carla Gugino plays a forensic criminalist who is also Turk's girlfriend, and she's just weird in this role. None of the characters were that likeable; therefore, I wasn't vested in the outcome.

The pace of the movie seemed lagging and at times just wasn't interesting. DeNiro and Pacino play off one another well but it didn't work in this case. Almost from the start, I figured out who the real killer was - as in any mystery, filter out all the red herrings thrown at you and focus on the least likely one.

Ah, this film is a masterpiece.  Two famous actors who have nothing left other than the relative fame of their names do what they do: act like De Niro and Pacino.  For years, people have extolled the virtues of their respective movies but what nobody wants to admit is that Pacino and De Niro have played themselves for years.  They don't really have any particular skill other than playing the same character over and over again.

Both men make the same faces they always make; Pacino requires a barking soliloquy at the end of each movie.  De Niro's mouth turns down at the corners all the time.  The acting is just silly; these are two overblown actors, at least a decade past their primes (likely more), together in a movie in the hope the combination of their respective names would somehow make these utterly unremarkable movie marketable.

You have to buy De Niro as virile enough to have Carla Gugino as a girlfriend and, in order to demonstrate his manliness, they have to show an elderly De Niro in various sexual poses which serve to disgust as opposed to convincing you he's a man of 'action.'  If you survive the gag flex of those utterly unnecessary scenes, you get the reward of two actors acting for a paycheck.  If you must watch this movie, get it from a library.",1240531200,11,1549,4.555956678700361
3380766,2,B0015OKWL2,"Well first off i would like to start this review by saying that Jon Avnet is not really a very good director, and the only film he is really recognized for is Red Corner(1997 Richard Gere), which was pretty good but not stunning. Secondly it seems Al Pacino(my icon) likes his direction because this is the second film that Al has done with him(88 minutes)in the past 2 years which was stated as being one of Pacinos worst films ever. I did think 88 minutes was cliche' to say the least but it was 10 times better than this film mainly because Pacino acted his butt off for a very sup par film. So that said al and robert being on the big screen together was one of my dreams come true, but that dream fell short when i started about 10 minutes into the film and realized what i was about to witness.
  This movie is riddled with horrible dialogue, a cliched script and screenplay as i said before and just a horrible sense that the film was rushed. This could be in a literal sense of the word considering when you watch the movie nearly all the scenes between al and Robert and anyone else for that matter seemed very rushed and they never had any time to just sit and feed off each other like it should have been. Heat was the first time they actually talked face to face and in that short 10 minutes or so it is still one of the greatest most classic scenes in movies today. Now as for the movie itself basically the whole premise is the two detectives trying to find a serial killer who's basically murdering the murderers but eventually points towards a cop, thats it, thats all. The ending of the movie while clever still cant hold together the overall plot and really you may be suprised but disappointed because you wished it had been the end of a ""better"" movie. So in closing of this short review the only thing that saves Righteous Kill for even a casual viewing to see these two legends together and is in fact themselves that barely hold it together, they are the only reason to even bother. Any other actors that may had been chosen for the film would have sent this straight to DVD. And while these performances aren't even close to there best, they both bring there own unique talent to a very tedious, rushed and at times boring movie. Lets hope they have enough in them before 70 hits to maybe reunite again, with a very great director. Michael Mann where are you?:(

Also note Jon Avnet trys to get away with slick suprise endings, well it didn't work very well in 88 minutes, nor does it in this film. Also i find it amusing that it says a Jon Avnet film, like he's a grade A top director. Not so either. Just pick it up you'll see what i mean.",1239840000,,2665,4.294234592445328
3380767,3,B0015OKWL2,"Arguably the two greatest actors from my teens together again in a gritty vigilante film should be a slam dunk success, but for me it wasn't. The story is okay, not great, full of clich&eacute;d plot lines. The acting is okay, just not what I might have hoped for from Pacino and De Niro.  Top that off with these super-cops being in at least their mid sixties, made the suspension of disbelief surpass any science fiction plot that I can think of.

3380774,5,B0015OKWL2,"I can recall seeing previews for this movie and thinking that I couldn't wait to see it.  After all it has Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino, how could it be a bad movie.  Well the trend for movies now is that they are in the theater for five days before being pulled, so I never got a chance to see ""Righteous Kill"".  Then the DVD came out and it was bought for me by my girlfriend.

Before I put the movie into my DVD player I recall all the negative praise I heard about this movie.  Many of the reviews called the movie a ""dud"", not good as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heat-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B0006J28KU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heat (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;(the classic film that featured DeNiro and Pacino in 1995), predictable or just a lazy effort.  I confess I was a bit concerned that this movie was going to ""suck"".

Upon completion of viewing ""Righteous Kill"" I was very, very pleased. The movie was about DeNiro and Pacino investigating a series of murders.  These murders involve all ""criminals"" that either ""got off the hook"" or ""haven't got caught yet"".  The crimes these delinquents have performed range from rape to drug dealing.  As both of these veteran cops dig deeper they discover the ""killer"" could be a cop/police officer.  There is a lot of misdirection in this film about who did or didn't do it.

There is some criticism that the ""serial killer"" was painfully obvious.  I am not sure about all that.  I will admit the outcome of this movie wasn't the most original, but it didn't ruin the film for me.  I won't give the ending of the movie or spoil any details of this film.  I will say that it is very likely a viewer might have the mystery figured out before the denouement of the film arrives.

What I found refreshing about this film was the acting and the grittiness of the subject matter.  Seeing DeNiro and Pacino together (again) was awesome.  I didn't feel that their acting was lacking substance or dull.  These are two classic actors and are still in their prime.  I felt their interaction made up for mundane film clichs that could have transpired.  As for the supporting cast, that was excellent too. John Leguizamo, Donnie Wahlberg, Carla Gugino, Brian Dennehy and even Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson did a good job.  This movie also presents a rather moral question about murder that you can almost smell a ""Death Wish"" movie.  This flick has a very intelligent edge to it, much more than you normal crime drama.

I can't speak for why other people didn't like this film.  As for it being predictable, isn't 90% of every successful and box office smash predictable?  Look at romantic-comedies.  Perhaps the problem ""Righteous Kill"" faced was the prior catalogue both DeNiro and Pacino have, including ""Heat"".  Now in juxtaposition ""Heat"" is a better movie than ""Righteous Kill"".  However the latter does feature more screen time between DeNiro and Pacino and this is what makes this movie work.  I am glad I took a chance on this movie and didn't listen to ""critical acclaim"" because I thought it was awesome.  There are worst ways a person could spend an hour and forty minutes.",1237248000,,3180,4.853159851301116
3380775,2,B0015OKWL2,"'Righteous Kill' represents a big foot forward for screenwriter Russell Gewirtz. Where Gewirtz's rookie effort, 'Inside Man', was a story about a bank heist that completely lacked credibility, the plot of 'Righteous Kill' actually is modestly clever. A vigilante serial killer is on the loose in New York City, murdering various criminals. His calling card is a rhymed poem left at each crime scene. De Niro (Turk) and Pacino (Rooster) play the two aging detectives assigned to solve the case. De Niro is seen throughout on a surveillance tape seemingly 'confessing' to committing the murders. But in a twist at the end of the story, his confession turns out to be forced and it ends up that Pacino is actually the murderer all along.

Before arriving at the film's climax, we learn that Turk planted evidence on a murderer who got off on a technicality and as a result the criminal is sent off to jail. A good part of the movie chronicles how each of the bad guys are dispatched by the vigilante. The main bad guy is a drug dealer played by 50 Cent who is convincingly menacing. An early unconvincing scene involves Turk and Rooster sending a pretty coke-addicted lawyer to the drug dealer's lair, wearing a wire, and trying to entrap him. The drug dealer sees through the ruse right away and the lawyer is shot by the drug dealer's bodyguard (but eventually survives). Why veteran detectives would place an amateur informant in such easy jeopardy doesn't ring true. There's a subplot involving a sexy Crime Scene Investigator who is simultaneously bedding Turk and Perez, a younger detective (played by John Leguizamo). Perez and his partner Riley (played by Donnie Wahlberg) come to the conclusion that it's one of their own who has been committing the murders.

Various posters here have pointed to deficiencies in the script including that De Niro and Pacino are too old for their parts, there's a lack of character development (too many good cop/bad cop clichs), a lack of suspense and scenes that are repetitious. One poster suggested that the characters needed to have a softer side but I think it was the director's intent to keep the entire story as dark as possible. The constant use of the moody soundtrack throughout most of the film compensated for the lack of emotional depth of the characters. Was this a good thing? I don't know. But clearly the music added to the film's 'neo-noir' feel.

'Righteous Kill' will probably do fairly well at the box office if one factors in the potential global market. This is really a noir version of 'Dirty Harry' and those who love having their stick-figure bad guys brought to justice without putting up a fight, will be drawn to his type of film. And then there's De Niro and Pacino. De Niro almost always channels the same character--a hot-headed gangster type (I was so much reminded of his performance in 'Analyze This', although that's a comedy). Moviegoers always want to pay money to see De Niro even though he usually coughs up the same shtick. Pacino however is much more subdued in this film until the end. Only then does he allow his over the top persona to come out. Actually that was the intent of the screenwriter; the audience is led to believe that De Niro is the hot head and Pacino is the reasonable one. Pacino keeps De Niro ""in check' throughout the film until the ending.

Although many claimed they 'figured out' the twist ending 30 minutes into the film, I must confess that I didn't see it coming. But once it was revealed I didn't really buy the reversal since it was inconsistent with the way the character arc had developed. Pacino's 'Rooster' has noble motives for offing the bad guys. But suddenly, when the sexy CSI gal is about to expose him, he viciously attacks her. It just seemed totally out of character for this noble 'Dirty Harry' character to suddenly decompensate and attack a woman. What 'noble' criminal would do such a thing? Rooster's explanation is that he became disappointed with Turk after Turk planted evidence on the murderer who got off on a technicality. He had 'looked up' to Turk but now the image of him being a noble cop had been destroyed. Somehow he now becomes a vigilante serial killer because his partner no longer 'went by the book'. This is his explanation as to why he becomes unhinged which leads his partner of 30 years to shoot him to death. If you believe in this motive, then you'll believe that the portrait of the New York City Police Department as depicted in this film is a realistic one.

When all is said and done, we never get a feel for Turk and Rooster as flesh and blood human beings. There is little 'back story' to 'Righteous Kill' and that applies to all the characters. 'Righteous Kill"" remains a modestly entertaining detective mystery with little character development and chiefly relying on the hit or miss semi-comic banter between two aging Hollywood legends.",1237161600,3,4900,4.739742086752638
3380776,3,B0015OKWL2,"Turk and Rooster (feel free to cringe) are a couple of veteran cops, who've been handed a doozy of a case: a serial killer with a badge; or, as young detective Perez makes a point of saying, ""It's a cop, it's a cop, it's a cop!"" A video-taped confession by Turk doesn't quite seal the deal; after all, once we hear his confession, we have an hour and a half of movie left, and believe me, it's full of twists and turns and bullets and blood and gratuitous violence and freaky sex.

""Righteous Kill"" isn't at all what it could have been, and that is a damn shame.  Pacino is as enthusiastic and enjoyable as ever; De Niro appears to be sleep-walking at times, though he has his moments (does anyone else think he should team with Scorsese again?).  John Leguizamo and Donnie Wahlberg are good as younger detectives investigating the same case (though I wonder if four detectives wold be allowed to share the lead on a single case); and Carla Gugino is enjoyable as Turk's freaky girlfriend.  Curtis Jackson (aka 50 Cent) isn't half bad, though I believe that's because he only has a little screen time.  Brian Dennehy, as the police captain, is a pure pleasure to watch as always; his scenes with De Niro and Pacino (Pacino especially) are the best in the film.

The ""twist"" here (the main one, that is) is clever and intriguing, but it's bogged down by shoddy directing and an overly-ambitious script.  The fault isn't with the actors, it's with the people behind the scenes.  To put it simply, ""Righteous Kill"" is a second-rate film starring first-rate talent.  It's a shame, that THIS is the movie Pacino and De Niro finally decide to make together.

Most cops retire in their mid 50s, because by then most of them already have 25 to 30 years of service, and they can retire with full pension benefits.  Those that still want to work often take lucrative gigs in private security and private investigation work (which is on top of their generous taxpayer-funded pensions).

This is a decent little thriller, but I simply cannot suspend disbelief that they would still be on the job at that age.  Pacino, particularly, looks well into his 70s, even though he hasn't yet turned 69.  By casting 70 year-old Brian Dennehy (who looks 80) as their boss, they tried to make the two leads look younger by comparison, but it just compounds the silliness.  Most police forces have a mandatory retirement age, and it doesn't go up to age 70, even for the highest ranking officers.

There are still many juicy roles these guys can play, and I hope to see much more from each of them.  They just cannot play cops anymore.",1236297600,,1121,4.537313432835821

Anyway, some pretty bad people, who have gotten off (i.e., eluded justice...among them a child rapist, pimp, killer, a molesting priest, etc) on technicalities  are being murdered (actually gunned down with their own weapons). Assigned to this case are Turk (the sexy Robert Deniro) and Rooster (Al Pacino), who have tons of history and experience between them, and two rookies, Perez (John Leugizamo) and his dedicated sidekick Riley (Donnie Wahlberg). With converging storylines (there are tons of them....for example Deniro's romantic relationship with a fellow officer, played by Carla Gugino and Rooster's sketchy past), ""Righteous Kill"" was fairly entertaining. With plot twists and turns, this movie offers just the right amount of suspense (although I am sure that you will figure out the killer before the end) and mystery.

Together, they are investigating a serial killer who has decided to mete out his own brand of vigilante justice.  Criminals who have gone free on technicalities are being shot by an expert marksman; poems are being found on their corpses.  Who is the poetic serial killer?  Could it be a cop?  The answer will shock you.

  Fans of horror and action thrillers alike will love ""Righteous Kill.""  Thanks to the gory, shocking murders that compose a high body count, the pacing is fast.  Also, some of the victims were genuinely corrupt and the viewer will tend to sympathize with the serial killer.  Is the killer truly righteous in disposing of these criminals?  We also cheered Charles Bronson in the classic ""Death Wish"" and Jodie Foster in ""The Brave One"" when they relentlessly pursued the criminals who had killed their loved ones.

  Planting false evidence and killing criminals who have escaped justice have been themes of past vigilante films.  Michael Douglas was a judge in ""The Star Chamber,"" which was a vigilante organization contracting hit men to kill criminals.  Charles Bronson is found guilty of planting evidence on a serial killer in ""10 To Midnight;"" he later pursues the serial killer himself after three more young women are stabbed to death at his daughter's dormitory.

  As long as there is a justice system that favors the criminal over the victim, there will be movies like ""Righteous Kill.""  They represent a society that feels frustrated and hopeless because criminals are not receiving the punishments that they deserve.

Well... maybe someone could, but this isn't that film.  Putting De Niro and Pacino in the room with this script and rolling the camera doesn't work any better than putting my two year old grandson in a room with paint and canvas and expecting a Jackson Pollock.

Carla Gugino, luscious and 37, plays the love interest.  Does it matter whose?  Make sure the defibrillator is charged...

The story is insulting.

This storyline was so predictable and overdone.  I knew exactly how it was going to end.  I guess if you watch a lot of movies it is easy to become jaded and guess endings, but this was just so lame.

The acting was not bad, John Leguizamo and Donnie Wahlberg were interesting, but overall the acting was not at the level I was anticipating.  And what is wrong with Carla Gugino ... why is she picking such strange roles that showcase her physical and sexual attributes, and not her acting?

I am greatly disappointed.  This movie is a series of clich&eacute;s strung together that was not supposed to be noticed because we were supposed to be mesmerized by the De Niro/Pacino combo.  Like I said, poor man's ""Departed,"" watch that or Godfather 2 instead.",1234396800,2,779,4.594202898550725

In fact, he's about the only actor in the film that seems to be enjoying himself.",1234310400,,410,4.652777777777778

We've seen it all before.  Here there is a twist--the apparent vigilante may actually not be guilty of the crimes.  On that slender thread are hung the abilities of two of our greatest living cinematic actors.  The film held my attention, though the subplot was shaky and the conclusion largely predictable.  The supporting cast is effective and the direction is workmanlike.  This is a rental.",1234137600,,564,5.065217391304348
3380795,1,B0015OKWL2,"This movie is such a tragic waste.  Like ""On The Waterfront""'s Terry Malloy, it coulda been a contender -- if it had a different script, a different director, and a different supporting cast.  (Seriously -- 50 Cent and Donnie Wahlberg?  What, was Rob Schneider busy?)  As it is, the plot is stale and utterly predictable and completely dull to watch.  It's not even right to call the ending a ""twist"" because if you were watching with at least one eye open, you saw it coming pretty much from the beginning.  Pacino and DeNiro don't do anything with their performances that lift them out of the molds they've made for themselves these last  ten years -- the craggy, foul-mouthed cop and/or crook.  DeNiro has gotten some traction out of sending up that image in movies like ""Analyze This"" and ""Meet The Parents"" but this time around, he expects us to take him seriously.  Not happening.  There's really not much more I can say about this movie, to be honest.  The bottom line is that it should have generated some Heat (pun very much intended) but instead it left me cold.  It's boring as heck, and the presence of these two heavyweights doesn't make it any more interesting.  It's even worse than ""The Score"" -- another epic combination of actors (DeNiro, Brando and Norton) in a movie that's unworthy of their talent.

The extras are a waste of time.  There's a trailer, but it wasn't that great a trailer so I had no desire to watch it again.  I saw this movie because of the DeNiro/Pacino pairing, not because of the trailer.  There's a short feature on the movie itself with all the actors gushing about being able to work with the two legends.  That feature only makes me wonder why there isn't a feature where the two legends sit down and talk to each other about working together and about their careers.  Spike Lee and Denzel Washington did it in the extras for ""Inside Man,"" and I would have loved to see something similar here, but no dice.  Instead we get a long, useless feature with real NYPD cops talking about their jobs and how their jobs compare to the movie.  It's the kind of thing I'd expect to see on The Discovery Channel, but would never actually watch, and I didn't finish watching it on this DVD either.  Not a single actor from the movie is in it.

Even the most die-hard Pacino and DeNiro fans -- the nutters who'll never admit to any flaws in their icons, and sweep all their recent terrible film choices under the rug (""88 Minutes"", anyone?) in favor of harping on the increasingly distant past -- are sure to be disappointed by this one.  It's just a crying shame that these guys couldn't have spent the last 14 years finding another project that suited their talent, and really challenged them to step up to the plate again as great actors, instead of just phoning it in.  This entire DVD is just a monument to a colossal missed opportunity.",1233705600,,2873,4.542801556420233
3380796,2,B0015OKWL2,"What happens when someone in Hollywood gets a great idea, but the execution of said idea becomes mismanaged, resulting in an essentially half-hearted attempt at a movie? Well, one could say that the outcome would resemble something similar to the mind-numbingly formulaic, contrived, and completely devoid of any thrills thriller known as ""Righteous Kill"" starring screen legends Robert DeNiro (""Goodfellas"") and Al Pacino (""The Godfather"" trilogy).

""Righteous Kill"" centers upon two detectives, ""Turk"" (Robert DeNiro) and ""Rooster"" (Al Pacino), longtime partners within the NYPD for over 30 years. For these two decorated officers the streets shouldn't be able to offer them any new surprises; that is until several known criminals begin getting murdered by an alleged vigilante. To make matters worse, the dead bodies are all tied to cases the pair had solved over their many years on the force, prompting many in the department to wonder if one of their own has gone over the edge.

Prior to viewing this film I began to notice some rather strange omissions from the trailers preceding the impending release upon DVD and Blu-ray. Namely, the lack of any critical praise being thrown about; of course, this makes perfect sense given that a vast majority of film critics blasted the movie to pieces. With a growing sense that perhaps this movie is as lackluster as the critics had said it was, I found that my eagerness to see it was waning significantly. Yet, like a glutton for punishment I decided to sit down one night to see it for myself, because even though the movie was almost universally panned, I still like to make my own judgments about a film. Needless to say, after watching ""Righteous Kill"" I find myself in complete agreement with the majority of the critics, and wondering why on Earth did this film ever see the light of day, let alone find its way into the hands of two of Hollywood's icons?

To attempt to understand where this film went wrong we must first look at the base on which the film stands... the screenplay. Next to the involvement of actors Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino, the other big surprise surrounding this film was the fact that the script was written by the man who penned the outstanding heist film ""Inside Man"", writer Russell Gewirtz. After crafting such an entertaining thriller full of twists and turns and originality, I'm surprised that Gewirtz's follow-up would essentially embody the antithesis of all that was great about his previous script. With ""Righteous Kill"" there is nary a hint of originality, in place of that is an abundance of predictability that causes all of the potential twists and turns that the story will no doubt throw at the audience to fail due to the sheer obviousness of the proceedings.

On top of that is the fact that the only way any sense of suspense was created in this film was through a contrived plot device where several of the characters are referred to solely by their nicknames. This way the viewer doesn't know who is really who until the final moments of the film. It is this manufactured form of suspense that made me feel especially disappointed for two reasons. One, I can't think of a single person whose nickname is the only name by which they are called; and second, if Russell Gewirtz didn't want certain people's identities being truly known until the end, there are much more natural ways to achieve this. For instance, many people don't even refer to someone by name when talking to them, especially if they are very familiar with them. So, in the movie the nickname device could have still been used in conjunction with just casual conversation where no names are ever mentioned. This way the dialogue could still feel natural, and the unknown identities would still be a form of manufactured suspense, but one far less obvious and annoying.

Now lets move on to the director of this travesty, the much maligned (by me, that is) Jon Avnet, director of the abominable ""88 Minutes"". From what I have been able to gather after watching Jon's last two attempts at feature films, if it weren't for the surprisingly talented cast members he is able to ensnare, his films would most likely wind up on rental shelves or never even see the light of day in the first place. I find myself completely surprised that this man is able to get such high-caliber actors and actresses to flesh out his roles. Granted his track record of television shows (""Boomtown"" for instance) is a bit more impressive, even if his shows haven't been the longest lasting, at least they were compelling; and it is conceivable that news of the utter crap-fest that was ""88 Minutes"" was not made known until after it was too late and those involved in this film were already signed. With those two thoughts in mind, they may serve as an explanation as to why Pacino and DeNiro would even consider joining up with such a hack director; although Pacino by all rights should have already figured out that this guy didn't have a clue after his time spent headlining the previous film. Whatever the case may be for why this man still has work coming to him in Hollywood, from my perspective he's had his first and second chances, and massively blown them both, so I can't understand why he isn't just shown the door or at least his way onto the B-list, a.k.a. the Direct-to-DVD list.

As I stated before, the biggest surprise of all surrounding this movie, was the involvement of Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino. The last time these two screen legends had acted opposite each other was in the superbly crafted ""Heat"" from director Michael Mann. Here we are 13 years later, and what should have been one of the greatest Hollywood reunions of all time, is wasted in a movie that is well below their considerable talents. Although some could argue that neither actor has been at the top of their game in quite some time; I still believed that their common sense would have told them to run away from this mess before it is too late. But I guess I would have been wrong on that count. Which leads me to wonder if these two acting giants have lost the drive that once made them such forces to be reckoned with, and is it too late for them to reclaim what they appear to have lost?

I will say that even though this film is well below the standards of their prime, both Pacino and DeNiro did give decent performances. However, I would have to say that neither one seemed too committed to their respective role, but at least they weren't just overtly going through the motions without a care, as they have done in some of their recent work (i.e. ""88 Minutes""). Joining them we have actress Carla Gugino (""Sin City"") who serves the purpose of being nothing more than the eye candy of the film. Her role doesn't really offer anything to the proceedings, and the one point in the story when it seems her character may have some relevance after all, is squandered in the end. Other supporting cast members include Donnie Wahlberg (""Saw 2"") and John Leguizamo (""The Happening"") as two other police officers with ties to some of the various criminals being murdered. I'm sure their characters were intended to serve as compelling antagonists to Pacino and DeNiro's, but in the end both of them appear as bland and uninspired as the rest of the production, despite the efforts of Leguizamo and Wahlberg. Lastly, Brian Dennehy appears in a thankless role so small that it is almost relegated to cameo status as the boss/friend of ""Turk"" and ""Rooster"". Brian Dennehy is a talented actor who has always managed to entertain no matter the role; yet in this film even he can't make a miracle happen and his choice for signing onto this project seems just as bewildering as the two leads.

It's a shame that such a large amount of talent was wasted on such a generic movie as ""Righteous Kill"", and truth be told had the star power associated with this film not been involved, I have no doubt that most people never would have heard of the movie and it would have found its way directly on to rental shelves instead of in theaters. Now, if you have not seen a mystery/thriller or any kind of cop movie or television program, then perhaps you will find ""Righteous Kill"" to be outstanding; however, if you have seen any of the aforementioned, then you will most likely find this film to be just as dull and boring as I did.

You were searching for a commradere between the two partners but there was always that ""guy thing"" that kept them at odds and made their partnership rather vacant for anything meaningful, especially after all those years.  All the action throughout the film just seemed like a filler only until the end when it finally decided to pick up the pace.  Pacino and his righteous kills didn't sound like a mystery finally unearthed but just a flat ""well here it is"".  This movie could have been written better for these fabulous actors.

But like so many others that reviewed this flick, she didn't enjoy it at all. I knew it must have had poor rating, especially when I rented it through NetFlix as a Blu-ray release and I didn't have any wait at all to receive it.

3380801,2,B0015OKWL2,"Has Hollywood become so cynical it thinks that simply slapping the names of two iconic actors on a marquee will cause the throngs to line up at the box office.

The throngs stayed away from ""Righteous Kill"" in droves and with good reason--it's a less than routine cop-serial killer movie without a single witty or new idea--had anyone brought this script to the producers of TV's ""Law and Order"" they would have been laughed out of the office.

De Niro and Pacino sail through the film using their, by now, patented mannerisms....De Niro mostly scowls as if he's still working in ""A Boy's Life""...what's most amazing is these two exhibit zero chemistry together.

The supporting cast, which includes Brian Dennehy, John Leguizamo and Carla Gugino, try hard, but the script gives them nothing to play.

Take any one episode for example, from the five years of HBO's ""The Wire"" and you have better acting, writing and direction than what's exhibited in ""Righteous""...

3380803,5,B0015OKWL2,"Unlike several of the previous reviews, I liked the film very much for several reasons.  First, it pairs two of the very best and versatile actors in the business, Pacino and DeNiro, along with super supporting actor, Brian Denehy.  Secondly, it deals with a subject that appeals, in fantasy, with emotions shared by a large segment of our society, retribution for heinous crimes but unfulfilled because of the often unfair legal system.  This film harkens back to the popular DEATH WISH series of the '70's and '80's starring the great Charles Bronson in which he, too, became a vigilante due to the dubious legal system.

Sure, there are some weak plot details, but that exists in many of the greatest films of yesterday and today and in the end we rate films for a great number of things not the least of which is great acting which does not dissappoint here.  For the most part, the film leads you in one direction and many surprises occur along the way.  All in all, take it for what it is:  a pairing of three great actors, lots of action, a sympathetic theme and many surprises.

3380804,1,B0015OKWL2,"Ah, I just couldn't wait to buy this movie - De Niro, Pacino!  What could possibly go wrong?  Answer: everything!

Take a bad script, add a narrator, and then throw in a few B-level actor wannabes and you have a disaster on film.  This movie is so predictable and boring that I can only imagine Robert and Al were heavily medicated for head colds when they agreed to take lead roles in this project.

If it had been any other actors, this movie would have been stopped in the middle of production.  However, many people actually give this movie high ratings, here at Amazon.com, because they know the amazing track record for the two big leaguers!  And I truly can't blame them for that.  Pacino or De Niro sitting in a rocking chair for thirty minutes would probably be a bit interesting, because these two have that IT factor.

Two very old, white, NYPD detectives fall under every single clich ever invented about cops.  Then they work out in the police weight training room, shoot lots of bullets at targets, talk trash, brag on each other, fight with the younger cops, stand up to the black street thug, and along the way discover they have a vigilante in their midst; wow, how will the audience ever handle the suspense.  Easy, there is none.  In fact, there really isn't a single character in this movie who I found myself rooting for to succeed.  I was actually hoping they all got shot!  Sorry, just being brutally honest; everyone seemed corrupt, arrogant, and void of any good human qualities.

Righteous Kill is one of those movies that everyone hoped would live up to the hype.  But when you rely on a cool musical soundtrack and two great movie stars to carry the whole project, you are going to create a mess.  And that is exactly the best way to describe this movie:  A MESS.

And CASTING DIRECTORS, please stop putting 50 Cent in movies!  He should not even be an extra in a film.  He cannot act!  He's not even good enough to convince an audience he is a rapper, and he is.

The performances of both leads keep you interested, but I figured out the twist way before the end of the film. The film also seemed like a very long hour and a half.

They don't get frantic and out of control, because to them, it's all business as usual - taking out the trash. The plot is solid, if not spectacular and the acting exactly what I would expect from the stars. I'm not sure if I'd call it a twist ending, as there are several ""clues"" or tip offs through out the film that might lead you to figure it out before hand.

3380807,3,B0015OKWL2,"Robert de Niro and Al Pacino together again after such a long period [they have only shared two movies - The Godfather Part II and Heat]seemed like a surefire winner. Instead, I felt like I was ripped off - the writing was bad, the acting was so-so, and the plot was just hackneyed. I really should have known better after Pacino's last effort ""88 Minutes"", another tepid thriller.

Okay, so maybe I'm exaggerating - it's not that Righteous Kill is a completely bad movie, but it's the unfulfilled expectations of seeing two legends paired together to make a really good movie that proved it's undoing.

De Niro plays ""Turk"" and Pacino plays ""Rooster"", two NY cops who've been around for a while, perhaps too long. A serial killer is on the prowl, offing acquitted criminals and an earlier scene with Turk confessing to the crimes naturally makes viewers think he is the suspect. But the flow of the movie just doesn't mesh with the development of the main characters - in the end, the revelations don't really shock and the characters appear pretty much one-dimensional.

I also felt that these two veteran actors and screen legends left it too late to make an on-screen appearance together - they are both in their late 60's and it shows. There is no sense of presence and we don't get any indication that these are acting heavyweights - much of the blame goes to the bad direction as well as the tepid plot, but part of it is also because these two are unconvincing in their roles here.",1231977600,,1489,4.611320754716981

3380809,3,B0015OKWL2,"The last time I watched my two favorite iconic actors was in the blockbuster hit ""HEAT"" and of course, I was drawn to director Jon Avnet's ""RIGHTEOUS KILL""--although, I was keeping my expectations really low (after amazon friend Chris Blackshere`s review). The film has a very interesting premise and has the makings of an effective police drama, unfortunately the screenplay by Russell Gerwitz appears to have been hampered by a ""gimmick"" in the form of a video taped confession.

Turk (Robert De Niro) and Rooster (Al Pacino) are two cops, with a 30 year service to the NYPD. These two detectives have a lot of experience and have seen a lot of things in their career. Turk actually has some anger management issues and Rooster is just full of ""cool"". The two are teamed up with another pair of detectives, Riley and Perez (Donnie Wahlberg and John Leguizamo respectively) from another unit to investigate the killings of several ""scumbags"" who are still out on the streets because of technicalities in court. These killings seem to be the work of a vigilante roaming the city streets who leaves poetry after each kill. There is some tension between Turk and Perez, Turk is currently a forensic scientist's (played by sexy Carla Gugino) ""whoopee"" buddy and Perez has a history with her. The four detectives find themselves in a collision course as Riley and Perez names Turk as the suspect. All the evidence points to Turk--or does it?

First of all, I love Pacino and DeNiro so it is such a treat to see them interact within the same camera view for such a good period of time. (they had limited interaction in ""Heat"") These two men are iconic actors and they can carry any film to no end. You just look at the actors and their presence just commands attention. Their characters ""Rooster"" and ""Turk"" are somewhat compelling and complex, they are very interesting, so at least both Pacino and DeNiro have something to work with. Pacino is the one who is level-headed while De Niro is the hot-headed one; also quite an unusual parallel to Wahlberg's Riley and Leguizamo's Perez. I suppose it was an attempt for Avnet to express the familiar mechanics of the ""good cop, bad cop routine"". Quite stereotypical, but with Pacino's and DeNiro`s performances, one doesn't necessarily need to be original.

The script does have a good plot, decent set ups, complex characters but what really hurt the film is its predictability. The film's main gimmick with ""Turk"" on videotape confessing in the first act just ruined everything for me, it became so predictable and I solved the ""mystery"" before the first half. For a movie like this, the serial killer-vigilante's identity have to be meticulously hidden so the viewer can be immersed into the proceedings--the style is just a cheap trick to try and interest the audience. Ok, I tried to justify the videotaped confession by thinking that the film is mostly about friendship, duty and trust; I honestly did try to get over the thriller elements but the directing and editing just kept me from buying this film as a morality play. I cannot go any further without spoiling the film for anybody, but to make things short, the direction was depending on misdirection on the screenplay and some ineffective twists for it to be accepted as one. Too bad, a few efforts in the editing room would have put this film into the list of effective cop dramas.

The film just showed a lot of errors in the way it was structured, the proceedings truly discouraged me to be involved and interested. Several elements proved to be critical mistakes. I was quite surprised as to how Avnet managed to convince this impressive cast to accept this project. Then, the screenplay plays its desperate hand by displaying some forensics groundwork and some tricky camera-work  which are obviously meant to add some ""meat"" to the film. Carla Gugino's character Karen seemed to be an obvious plot device to add some tension as well as eye candy; but her assault by the killer just felt too cheap. As a whodunit cop film, the movie falls apart.

The mistakes with ""Righteous Kill"" began and ended with the fact that it showed its cards too soon, it misuses its good elements, and it gave this terrific cast some, but too little to work with. There is a very good film underneath, which could have easily been solved by re-shoots and re-editing but I suppose Avnet liked his product as it is. The film isn't that bad, it does have a good premise but it just does nothing with its iconic leads. One might say, predictability can be accepted and if the journey is rewarding--well, the one great thing we can divulge from this film is the fact that it does star Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino. Yep, their performances does command respect.

parts and the other cast members give this film substance.
I think that when people hear De Niro & Pacino, their minds go
up 10 levels above what they expect from other actors,

3380812,4,B0015OKWL2,"Lambasted by the critics, ""Righteous Kill"" is actually a good movie with a clever story.  Granted, I figured out who the real killer is early on, but that doesn't diminish the fact that this is a suspenseful cop thriller.

Perhaps the critics savaged ""Righteous Kill"" because of its politically incorrect dialogue, specifically in regards to women.  In any case, it doesn't matter.  What matters is this movie has an interesting story, top-notch actors in Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino, and hard-hitting action.  I give it three and a half stars.

It's a good movie, a great cop drama and has a outstanding cast as you know.

Deniro was good, not amazing by any means, he seems to be coasting through as usual in most of his newer movies, Al Pacino was outstanding, his characters are always very believable, John Leguizamo played his character well, as always and Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson also did a good job, so far his acting seems to be worthwhile!!!

3380819,4,B0015OKWL2,"The trail of good cop/bad cop films grows longer as does the fascination with Serial Killers (witness the success of the excellent television series DEXTER where killing of 'people who deserve to die' is condoned).  RIGHTEOUS KILL is a good story with problems: the script is wrinkled with aphorisms, the direction allows the dialogue to overlap so often that subtitles are required to keep the viewer alert as to what is happening, and the music score too often drowns out what could be heard of the actors' voices.  But at the core of this much-maligned film is a tour de force for two aging actors (actually three) in Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and  Brian Dennehy.  Jon Avnet works with crusty lighting effects and photography to create a sense of tired, aging, worn out detectives who show us a side of law enforcement we'd rather not see.

Turk (Robert De Niro) is seen in the opening in a videotaped monologue about how he came to kill 14 people while in the line of duty.  His partner is Rooster (Al Pacino) and the two of them run their mode of law enforcement in their own style: even their boss Lieutenant Higgis (Brian Dennehy) gives them free reign.  An event occurs which triggers the concept of a serial killer whose murders of 'worthless street trash' victims who are tied to crimes for which they escape punishment.  Turk's fellow detective (an S&M girlfriend) Karen (Carla Gugino) becomes suspicious as do young detectives Perez (Leguizamo) and Riley (Donnie Wahlberg) - the idea of the perpetrator being a cop drives the 'honest cops' to extremes.  The twist at the ending could have had more impact with a better script (the work of Russell Gewirtz), but the interplay between De Niro and Pacino makes the entire film and ending well worth watching.

Great movie? No, but given the flaws and the overexposure of the theme the 'old guys' carry it off and provide a riveting, fast paced film worth the attention of more viewers.  Grady Harp, January 09",1231632000,,1969,4.728070175438597

After two more viewings on DVD, I just can't say enough nice things about it!  First off:  DeNiro and Pacino...what more do you really need?  These two could sit around and read the yellow pages and it'd be entertaining.  But, because they are DeNiro and Pacino the expectation level is pretty high...at least it was for me and I would assume many others.  The acting and subtle nuance between these two really makes this film quite good and it works.  Although, ""Heat"", was a much finer film, ""Righteous Kill"" is a much more satisfying one, in that we get over two hours of these two great actors playing off each other and it is quite enjoyable.  Also cast is one of my favorite character actors, Brian Dennehey, who delivers a solid performance.  Also look for the sexy Carla Gugino in another fine role as the CSI agent who begins to stumble onto the killers path.  I give this film a definate thumbs up and encourage all to give it a look.

3380822,3,B0015OKWL2,"The movie is worth a watch or rental if you haven't seen it.  But if you love it and want to buy it, you might want to spring for the target version as that comes with a free digital copy of the film as well as a trial version of RIGHTEOUS KILL: THE GAME on a bonus disc.  i have not tried either as of yet.

As for the film, it's pretty good, but nothing great considering the two lead actors and a very good supporting cast.  This crime thriller has one of those 'twist' endings, but the problem with the twist is that it is rather obvious as to WHO the serial killer is.  While that disappointed me, i still enjoyed finding out the WHY or WHAT it was that motivated the person to do what they did.  Besides the great cast, that part of the story kept me interested and entertained(for the most part) to the very end.

Unfortunately, i found the extras on the dvd to be just average at best.  There's a standard documentary on the making of the film, a feature on cops and corruption, some trailers, and a commentary with the director.  All worth a watch probably once, but i actually had trouble sitting through them.  Others might find them fascinating though.

Overall, i bought the dvd(without seeing the film first) cause i'm a fan of DeNiro and Pacino but i was a bit let down with the final results.  I liked it and will hang on to my copy, but can't help but agree with most that this could/should've been a lot better than what it was.  3 1/2 stars for the film, rounded down to 3 on amazon cause the extras are so average to me that it hurts the dvd.  In other words, i can easily recommend a rental, but not a purchase.

Heat marked the first onscreen pairing of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, albeit briefly during the nearly three-hour film.

Here De Niro and Pacino spend the entire film side by side and while the run time is about 100 minutes shorter than Heat, the effects are quite the opposite. They are weary. So are we. They are tired. And so on... The been-there-done-that-before story and leaden pacing are simply too much for two Academy Award-winning actors to save.

3380825,3,B0015OKWL2,"Deniro & Pacino, the two exceptional actors that ignited my passion for cinema.  You know it's a sad day in showbiz when you pair these two up and still can't arouse much excitement.

The premise is actually pretty cool.  Deniro is the cop serial killer, and Pacino is his partner that turns the other cheek.
Both these veteran actors deliver solid performances, but nothing special.  It's like they're on cruise control, nothing meaty in the script to pull the best out of them.

Still it's scary to think of the power a police officer wields, and how in some regards they are exempt from the very laws they try to enforce.
It's hard to feel any contempt or discomfort for the cop that puts a bullet in the head of a rapist or pedaphile priest.  The line between evil and righteousness gets blurred, and few want to focus on sorting things out.

The story progresses with some decent action scenes and interesting developments.  The biggest downside of this movie is without a doubt the ending.  Hollywood always deems it mandatory to throw in an absolutely shocking, retarded ending.  Yeah, they fooled us the first 2000 times.  So, for about the last hour you'll feel like a deer in headlights, as that H-wood vehicle comes barreling down the road of absurdity.

3380826,3,B0015OKWL2,"RIGHTEOUS KILL has a few things going for it. First off is the A-list talent. Pacino and De Niro are two of the greatest American actors alive today, with filmographys that include many of my favorite films of all time (TAXI DRIVER, THE GODFATHER, GOODFELLAS, CASINO). While the plot is not the most imaginative, it is suitable cop-drama fare. The twist that comes at the end may not surprise many, but at least it is consistent with the film.

The real problem with this film is a script that does not allow De Niro or Pacino to dial into what has made them the actors they are beyond their formidable acting skills: playing interesting, well written characters. Cast as two NYPD officers with many years of experience who are frustrated with The System's inability to keep the bad guys off the street, Turk (De Niro) and Rooster (Pacino) decide to take matters into their own hands. The concept itself is cliched, but might have worked if these two great actors were given the opportunity to bring any depth to their characters. This is where the weak script really kills this movie. Pacino, fresh off the flop that was 88 MINUTES (also directed by Jon Avnet so he might have known to steer clear of this one) is mired in yet another work-horse of a plot with very little emotional depth or character development to really let him shine. De Niro looks defeated throughout, as if the lines he is asked to deliver are killing is soul. The impression is that this might have been an excellent film with better dialogue and more character development, that it might have been a classic right up there with films like Casino, that it had that potential but fell far short.

Most of the criticisms leveled at this film (including my review) have a lot to do with ""what might have been."" The expectation level for a film with two film greats in it was so high that it makes what is really an average film appear worse than it actually is. There is nothing wrong with a cop-drama buddy romp for old-times-sake. However, actors of this caliber cast in the same film do raise expectations, possibly even unfairly high. ""There's nothing wrong with shooting,"" says Pacino at one point in the film, ""as long as the right people get shot."" In this case, it's Di Niro and Pacino facing a firing squad made of professional movie critics. It's up to you to decide if they deserved it.

2.5/5 Stars. Worth renting if for no other reason than to build your hopes that the re-make of HEAT (currently in production) will be the movie that RIGHTEOUS KILL wasn't.",1231459200,,2542,4.594713656387666

The case isn't new, a serial killer is murdering bad guys. We have seen that in a number of movies dating back at least thirty years. The fact they think it is a cop isn't original either. Although this movie is worth a rental, I doubt most fans will buy it. Sure I was glad I saw it, but I probably won't watch it again. There wasn't anything to bring me back.

3380831,4,B0015OKWL2,"Most of the reviews I've read on RIGHTEOUS KILL, available on DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment, have not been very positive, but I think that this picture has gotten a raw deal.

The problem, as I see it, is one of ""expectations"".  If Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino are co-starring in a motion picture, one expects something of the caliber of THE GODFATHER, Part II, or at the very least, HEAT.

Unfortunately, RIGHTEOUS KILL is not in the same league as either of those films, but that doesn't mean it isn't worth seeing.

Directed by Jon Avnet, RIGHTEOUS KILL is a taut, very watchable cops-and-robbers thriller.  It has the two stars playing NYPD detectives on the trail of a serial killer who is probably a fellow police officer turned vigilante.  He is killing violent bad guys who have been able to escape the justice system.  Although the movie opens with DeNiro ""confessing"" to the killings, there is a twist ending that astute viewers will probably guess long before it is revealed on screen.

The script by Russell Gewietz is well-written, and the actors, including John Leguizamo, Brian Dennehy, Carla Gugino, Donnie Wahlberg, Melissa Leo and Curtis Jackson, deliver strong performances.

Avnet delivers audio commentary on the DVD, and there are two ""Making of"" featurettes.

25 to 30 minutes in the movie you get the picture and realize the end, from there on it's just a matter of enjoying the performances by the actors john leguizamo was also very good.

3380833,3,B0015OKWL2,"Putting two of the most legendary stars of all time together in a movie is always a big gamble.  Expectations are immediately heightened, which puts extra pressure on the filmmakers to make a better-than-average film.  Looking back at projects with great duos like Fight Club or The Bucket List, one has to consider how much less spectacular they might have been with a cast of lower caliber actors.  On the other hand, sometimes superior acting can save an otherwise dull or disappointing film.  As for Righteous Kill, even the combined skills of Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro could not hide the fact that the film's premise was far better than its execution.

Following the opening credits, we see DeNiro through a video camera confessing that he is a rogue cop who has killed fourteen people.  As his narration continues, we step back in time a short while where we are formally introduced to longtime partners Turk (DeNiro) and Rooster (Pacino).  They are obviously the best of friends, but DeNiro seems to be headed down a dark road with Pacino unable to stop him.  The story goes on to reveal that a serial killer is on the loose who leaves handwritten poems at every crime scene telling why each person was murdered.  Partners John Leguizamo and Donnie Wahlberg challenge the older detectives for the case, which eventually leads them to an odd suspicion.

The acting is good all around and the twist is sensational!  Unfortunately there are many other elements that interfere with the movie's overall impact.  First, the editing leaves much to be desired as many of the scenes appear to have been cut short, diminishing their potential to affect.  Second, the script contains a number of one-liners that make even these amazing actors come off sounding cheesy at times.  Third, the film drags at times because little time is spent developing the relationship between the leads.  (Heavies like these deserve and require a solid foundation in order to give the movie depth.)  Lastly, the final act is lame and predictable following the twist.

The best that can be said about Righteous Kill is that having Pacino and DeNiro together is awesome no matter what.

Example: There was all this suspense built up as to whether or not DeNiro's character was really the serial killer-- as if we would *never* think to see if Pacino's character was also a possibility. WTF?

Example: DeNiro's character tried to play a turbocharged sex stud that was giving some other, younger female cop a good thrashing on a regular basis. DeNiro is about 70 years old in real life-- and looks it. Something went wrong in the casting department.

Example: 50cent's character went wrong (he wasn't made for the movies). His acting just wasn't believable-- and there are no shortage of other young guys who could have played a believable thug.

3380838,3,B0015OKWL2,"Righteous Kill is only the second pairing of two of cinema's greatest actors - Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. Their first on-screen collaboration, only featured them together in a couple of scenes, and left the public wanting more.

Righteous Kill has them playing NYC detective partners who've been on the job for 30 years. A serial killer start killing criminals who gotten off on technicalities. Soon, all the evidence points to the killer being a cop. And the cop would seem to be De Niro's character, Turk, a rough-edged type who isn't above falsifying evidence to convict suspects. He's balanced out by Pacino's Rooster, a calm, soothing influence on Turk in a relationship that seems as much like a marriage as it does a professional partnership. Added to the mix are John Leguizamo and Donnie Wahlberg as younger cops investigating the killings and Carlo Gugino as a forensic specialist in a relationship with DeNiro.

The movie works well as a police drama, less so as a mystery, although the solution of the killings does take some interesting turns. If two lesser actors were playing Turk and Rooster, the film might have been touted as asking interesting questions about the nature of friendships, partnerships, and romantic relationship amid all the stresses and strains of police work. But with De Niro and Pacino in tow, the viewer expects more, and doesn't necessarily get it with this film.

However, the two greats still know how to pull off great performance, and know how to elicit sympathy, affection, and every other possible emotion from an audience. Righteous Kill isn't a complete misfire, but might require a third teaming of these great actors.",1228003200,34,1670,4.978494623655914

When I came to watch the movie, I expected that there probably wouldn't be as much action as in many movies. But it seems the scriptwriter(s) tried to compensate out of fear perhaps or perhaps that is how the book was adapted by flashbacks and all sorts of deceptions - it was not necessary. I just wanted to see two cops in trouble and their emotions acted out by 2 brilliant actors. Which I did in part. Too bad the story had to jump from the past to the present and future so much.",1225152000,,661,4.131782945736434
3380840,5,B0015OKWL2,"I have to be honest, Righteous kill is a good film but isn't really one that can be considered above the likes of their previous collaborations such as Heat or Godfather part 2, but it's one that's definitely worthy of praise. Righteous Kill tells the story of two aging cops, Turk (De Niro) & Rooster (Pacino) who seem ready for retirement. Before they can hand in their badges they're called in to investigate the murder of a notorious pimp which seems to have links to a case they solved years ago. As the story progresses a number of different murders are committed by what seems to be the same man and in a vigilante fashion. The killer is teasing the cops by leaving poetic calling cards with the victims, obituaries of sorts. As time rolls on and the killer continues to stay on the loose, a theory is developed that a cop is the serial killer which leads to suspicions that it's Turk committing the crimes.

This being a crime psychological thriller isn't anything fancy, it's not about the flashy shootouts or gory killing, it's not even about the sex or any form of violence. It's intelligent and it keeps you wondering until the very end of the movie. De Niro puts on a stellar performance and is only complemented by Pacino. They're not playing any characters they haven't played before, they're still the clich tough guy Italian Americans, but isn't that what we love them for? The twist at the end is also quite cool and in a way very unexpected. Throughout the film we're given snippets of Turks ""confession"" and we're honestly lead to believe it is really him committing the murders. Of course as is the tradition with films of this sort, Turk is not the killer but you will be genuinely shocked to find out who it is.

The supporting do their job and do their job well, but are only hampered in their performance when sharing screen time with either De Niro or Pacino. It's even quite pleasant to see Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson in a role that isn't the obnoxious rapper criminal, but is a criminal caught in the middle of a bigger investigation. The acting between the two main stars is stellar and the chemistry really works, it's a joy to see them perform together and in a way is quite a saddening affair to think this may be the last time we ever see these two greats share a movie screen. I sincerely hope it's not though.

All in all a really enjoyable film that touches on a good message of ""Is it right to kill those who have hurt or killed others?"" The notion of a Righteous Kill is an intelligent one, it touches on a subject that we all face when we look at criminals who don't get their punishment. We've all thought ""I can't wait until that guy gets what's coming to him"" and this film asks the quesion of, is it right? Maybe not, but it certainly made a worthwhile movie fun to watch.

I would firstly recommend you go and see it in the cinema, then, if you're completely satisfied I would buy it on DVD as it's truly worth it.",1224979200,7,2956,4.428308823529412
3380841,3,B0015OKWL2,"The situation in that film is too classical to be original. It is humdrum and it is not the trick of making us believe one of the two cops is the culprit whereas we discover at the end it is the other that is going to renew in anyway the genre and the interest of the film. Two aging actors reduced to their life-long tricks made easy by new technology. And it is not an allusion to the dirty cop of Clint Eastwood that is going to renew in any way the discourse and provide it with legitimacy. And finally it is not the cheating of the police institution that is going to present the final death of the ""justice-maker"" at the end and the bullets of his own team-mate as the fatal success of the dead officer to stop the crimes of the criminal he was, hence making the myth of that criminal true though it will have no body, no identity, no nothing that is changing the plot from mud to gold. We should have expected that flop with the title because there is absolutely no righteous kill because ""Thou shalt not kill"". It reveals nothing about cops, the police, law and order or anything else. It is just some kind of paycheck to two aging actors.

3380842,3,B0015OKWL2,"Righteous Kill

De Niro and Al Pacino co-star in a police procedural cop thriller.  They're partners and police detectives on the verge of retirement.  The two wind up with a major case.  Someone is hunting down people who have been acquitted, but still done the crime, and executing them.  Are Turk and Rooster still up for the job?  The answer, of course, is yes.  I liked this movie even though some might find it a little cynical.  Even as the two are investigating, two other detectives start investigating Turk as a suspect!

What makes this film memorable is not so much the plot and its twists, but the banter and interaction between Pacino and De Niro. They're just brilliant, sardonic and funny.  As one of the police says, ""They're like Lennon and McCartney.  Not an inch between them.""  Some people will think that the twists are cheating, but I don't think so.  It's clever and fits with the story.  The key to ""Righteous Kill,"" for me, was that Pacino's character, nicknamed Rooster, is a strategizing chess player.  If you know that, then you'll know how he thinks, and the ending will make sense.

3380843,5,B0015OKWL2,"I think people are misinterpreting the film. This isn't M Night Shyamalan. The flashbacks and ""twist"" in the end weren't supposed to be a shocker or a revelation. It was to make a point. The killer's identity is insignificant.

The story is about two police officers who went into the job with the best of intentions. They are by nature good men. The job and the ineffectiveness of the system weighs on them both and damages them both differently.

The killer's actions throughout the movie can be justified by the audience. We get to know the characters and grow to like them. It doesn't matter who the killer is because we've grown to care for them and it has been determined that the actions of the killer are forgivable. He killed murderers, rapists and pedophiles - people who deserved to die. The transition in the film is when the killer hurts an innocent. When he victimizes someone who doesn't deserve it, the revelation should happen. It isn't a hammer like hollywood is known for. It's more subtle.

Can you forgive him now? You know him. You like him. He had good intentions and his motive is understandable. Can you forgive him for what he did? Do you even care about the other character enough for it to bother you?

If you do forgive his character and like him in the end, is it fair to root for the demise of all of the 'bad guys' before. We didn't know their story. We didn't know their motives or intentions. They're a blank slate.

It's much easier to root for the death and destruction of those we do not know that commit heinous acts than those we do. That is the point.

Either man could have been the killer. It didn't matter. The ending flashback sequences were an explanation and nothing more. It wasn't intended to be a ""WOW"" moment. It was deeper than that.

I was blown away by the movie. It was a thought-provoking movie that pushes you to believe one way (that getting the bad guys is just) to completley having to readjust your thought process (well....rape is bad, but......)
That to me is much better than a cheap shocker. It's an unjustified compromise that one makes with themselves. For a film to do that is quite amazing.",1222473600,,2158,4.532133676092545
3380844,1,B0015OKWL2,"Unfortunately, this eagerly anticipated, much hyped about team-up between screen legends Al Pacino and Robert De Niro proved to be nothing more than a tiresome, disappointing, and ultimately embarrassing exercise in straight-to-DVD schlock cinema. If anything, John Avnet's ""Righteous Kill"" showed us just how tired and worn out these two faded stars have become. The film was not able to emulate the electric chemistry the two actors shared 13 years ago in Mann's earlier film Heat (1995), which was so provocative and so moving that the sheer magnanimity of that famous 'coffee shop' scene heralded more than just a dream come true for movie fans; it was a love affair between two of the world's greatest living actors. In ""Righteous Kill"" on the other hand, we have a paunchy, tired looking De Niro and a gaunt, gravelly-voiced Pacino reduced to playing TV parodies of themselves with about as much chemistry as a mongoose paired with a rattlesnake.",1222300800,4,952,5.070063694267516
3380845,2,B0015OKWL2,"So, going into Righteous Kill last night, I knew who the killer was.  It wasn't that I've read spoilers or knew much of anything about the plot, except for what was shown in the trailers.  But it just seemed so obvious and I didn't expect the movie to be anything more than what I thought it was; i.e. needless.  However, watching the movie, I started thinking...hmmm, maybe the movie is smarter than I expected.  Maybe it won't be the most obvious person in the room and maybe they are actually trying to do something interesti--oh.  Nope.  It's who I originally thought it would be.  Bummer.

I guess I shouldn't have expected much out of the director who did 88 Minutes, but I was hoping it would be something surprising.  The beginning was certainly interesting; it caught my attention and had me going for a bit.  Unfortunately, as the film progressed, I started wishing it was over just so I could find out who the killer was.  Nothing that was happening was terribly interesting or insightful.

Most of the movie was about building a case against one of the characters and that's it; there's no real red herrings and you could probably piece together who's doing it rather quickly so that the ""plot twist,"" which might have been hip back in the early 90s or late 80s, is anything but. If you already know that the only possible suspect isn't the killer and the movie doesn't even pursue any other red herrings, then you have a boring film.  The only reason to go see this, as the trailer seems intent on letting you know, is to see Pacino and De Niro acting together.  But really, is that enough to make someone sit through a boring film?  If you're that hard-up to see them acting together, go watch Heat again.

3380846,3,B0015OKWL2,"Righteous Kill had, rightly so, fans across the globe salivating for a piece, the moment it was known that Jon Avnet was making a film, putting two of the most prolific and potentially explosive actors together, after Michael Mann attempted the same in ""Heat"", more than a decade ago.

However, it's a sad day when stalwarts such as Pacino and De Niro are pretty much wasted on an attempt as half-hearted and clearly under-prepared as this one. The movie takes on a potentially explosive subject matter (cop serial-killer!), and twists it into such a tight knot that even the climax isn't able to do much to undo the damage that an abject script, lackadaisical dialogue, and an unnecessarily twisting screenplay have done.

Pacino and De Niro play ageing NYPD homocide detectives, who are on the trail of a suspected serial killer who bumps off perps whom the law is unable to convict. Gradually, it becomes evident that the killer might be a Police Officer. It doesn't help understand the story that sequences in the movie are interspersed with De Niro's taped confession to all the murders, giving a detailed explanation and justification for all his supposed actions.

Naturally, sparks fly in all directions, and the story develops around this premise. However, the dynamite delivery that the hungry audience is looking out for is nowhere to be seen, for the actual delivery of both the actors is muted, toned down, and too small to be significant.

I fail to see why Avnet didn't develop the characters, or at least the background to the storyline, showing less of his editing skills and more of the actors' acting skills.

Overall, the movie has its good points and can't simply be written off as a complete failure; in fact, one of the reasons it's being made out to be such a failure all around is perhaps the fact that there are such high expectations from a Pacio / De Niro pairing.

Overall rating: 3 / 5 (one each for Pacino and De Niro resp., and one for them together!)",1221955200,,1983,4.733333333333333
3380847,3,B0015OKWL2,"Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino play a pair of aging partners in the New York Police Department in this flat crime drama. Over the years, the two officers have grown close. Both men have become disillusioned with life on the beat and with seeing dangerous criminals escape justice based upon what they see as legal technicalities. The two officers have issues with their career choices and with their personal lives, especially women. In the late stages of their careers, the two officers are assigned to pursue a serial killer of criminals who have evaded punishment for their misdeeds.

The interaction between DeNiro and Pacino is adequately portrayed at best.  Unfortunately this interaction is not enough to save the movie. The story is told in an unnecessarily disorganized way and the pacing is slow. The scenes of city life, loneliness, grit, violence, and toughness that are essential to any noir movie or film of urban life are lacking. Photography and scenes are routine and uninspired. The result is dullness. These two fine actors, with memories of Taxi Driver and Raging Bull among other things, deserved better.

3380848,3,B0015OKWL2,"De Niro and Pacino are excellent actors and their abilities save this movie from being a total piece of Dreck. If the word F**K was deleted from the script there would be no screen play and if you deleted the profanity there would be no plot.  You wonder if Russell Gewirtz who wrote the screen play has a vocabulary larger than the average rapper.  The play is poorly written and not helped by pedestrian if not amateurish direction.  The close ups are too many and extremely unflattering to all of the actors -- especially Pacino and De Niro who are not young any longer and the director accentuates that. The lighting makes everyone's personal hygiene suspect which is exacerbated by the unkempt and unshaven appearance of the actors. I was especially annoyed by the highly implausible sex between De Niro and the female officer who could easily have been his granddaughter.  Then the S&M twist to this implausible love affair added nothing to the film.  The director (Avnet)and the screen play attempted to insert twists and surprises throughout the film but the plot was so transparent that these seemed amateurish.

Essentially this is a film about two teams of police detectives investigating a series of crimes that appear to be committed by a cop.  There is violence, sex, drugs, and blood galore, but as you can see not much of a plot.  However, the movie is entertaining and the surprise ending isn't very surprising.  I enjoyed the movie but I doubt that any of the actors will claim this as the highlight of their careers.

De Niro gets to play Travis Bickle with a badge as a 30-year veteran of the NYPD who turns to vigilantism after too many of the suspects he arrests get off on technicalities.  Pacino is De Niro's longtime partner who seems unaware of what his fellow officer is up to on his off hours.

De Niro and Pacino are both pros enough not to embarrass themselves unduly during the course of the film, but they are hardly helped by an implausible screenplay (Russell Gewirtz) and claustrophobic direction (Jon Avnet), not to mention ugly photography and unflattering lighting that make them look even older and more haggard than they already are (do we really need this many tight close-ups of these former matinee idols at this late stage in their careers?).
