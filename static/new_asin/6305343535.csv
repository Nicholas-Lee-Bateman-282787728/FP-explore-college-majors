7888084,3,6305343535,A  good method for learning a few great blues songs,1419984000,,51,4.1
7888085,4,6305343535,"The instructor shows the basic chord patterns and riffs of the song. However the version performed by the instructor includes several embellishments not taught in this video. These advanced techniques required a more detailed explanation to make it clear for the beginner guitarist.

The additional materials section has an outstanding tutorial on broken 7th and 9th chords that alone is worth the price of this instructional DVD.",1292284800,,430,5.417910447761194
7888086,5,6305343535,"I purchased this DVD for my husband, he loves it.
The filming is great, good close ups, you can actually see the cords and strum patterns. If you want to learn more than cords, things like strum patterns and and how to put together a Blues riff, I highly recommend this DVD.",1263686400,,274,4.288461538461538
7888087,2,6305343535,"The problem with this (and most DVD and CD supported guitar instruction programs) is that the instruction is incomplete and misleading.  The instructor shows a few chords and a basic lick.  However, what is shown is so basic that it could be picked up for free on u-tube.  Now, the DVD does provide nice versions of the songs, but the problem is the versions played are not the ones taught.  The instructor adds lots of embellishment and flourishes, but gives no information on these additions.  While no DVD can teach the subtleties of performance, at least the TAB for the performance could be included.  Even without direct and explicit instruction, the addition of COMPLETE TABS would lead to an excellent product. As is, the product looks good, but has little substance.",1237420800,,775,4.877862595419847
7888088,4,6305343535,"I strongly disagree with the reviewer who said that this dvd was all flash and no substance.
This is the best dvd of the classic blues in terms of instruction and songs selection, and the only one worthy of purchase. Stay away from vol 2&3, they're neither worth your time nor your money.
For each song, I liked how Dan Warner takes the time to explain how to play each section, it did not feel rushed and was like having a real teacher with me. I enjoyed the final performance with the vocalist.
If only the other two volumes were as good as this one.
Recommended for beginners who want to learn their first blues songs.",1234656000,,621,4.362068965517241
7888089,3,6305343535,"As a beginner / intermediate guitarist, I like the SongXpress series of DVD's (originally done on video tape and bought up by Alfred Music) because they are basic and can get anyone playing the core fundamental of any song they offer but sometimes they tend to be too basic and this is the case with Classic Blues vol. 1

They teach you the basic chord patterns or maybe the easiest of riffs but then at the end, the song is performed in a manner much advanced from what you were taught with no way of picking up the advanced material.  You are left with a feeling of frustration and being left out.

I would have rated it 2 stars but in the additional materials section there is an 8 min instructional on 7th and 9th chords that I found very valuable.

If you just picked up the guitar there are better beginning DVD's, if your intermediate in your skills this is going to leave you frustrated.  If someone gives it to you don't throw it away.",1226793600,,944,4.340909090909091
7888090,1,6305343535,"Wow, they sure spent a lot of time and money making sure they got ""cool"" effects for the section intros.  Too bad there is so little material.  Oh, and instead of wide angle shots of playing the songs why not more split screen of right and left hands with Tab.  Too much trouble I guess.  WAY too many shots of a wiggling hand on a fretboard while being told that there are many more variations you COULD learn (that they don't show!)  If you think you will learn these whole songs guess again.  So little to work with here.  I'm cured of buying ANY Songxpress title from here on out.

Thanks for nuthin'",1122681600,4,604,4.283185840707965
7888091,5,6305343535,"I am a begining guitar player. This video was a great help to me. It is easy to understand and follow. The guitarist in the video was straight forward and to the point. I had tried using several books and CD's prior to  using the video. But this series is fantastic, I learned the songs in about  2 weeks with regular practice. If you are just starting out with the  electric guitar and are looking for some guidance,  this is the video  series. It makes sense and well worth your time. Don't pass it up.",964051200,,504,4.2631578947368425
