7888092,5,6305371636,pretty good for it being that old love the speical effect and the actress/actor the plot is ok but the action is good,1361577600,,117,4.130434782608695
7888093,2,6305371636,"- It tries hard to be a comedy but it's a bad comedy.

- The fighting scenes might be good in 1991, the day the movie was released. However compared to other movies made in the 21st century like Kill Zone, Flashpoint, Ongbak etc., the figting is just okay.

In short, it's worth renting but not buying.",1258243200,,302,4.280701754385965
7888094,3,6305371636,"When I was just a wee lad, I saw Iceman Cometh in a dodgy little theater and it became one of my favorite films. It had it all, sword fights, fisticuffs, time travel, magic etc. Twelve years later, I didn't find it quite as charming. There are things that still hold up very well. The fight scenes are well coreographed and showcase Yuen Biao and Yuen Wah's martial arts prowess. In addition much of the camera work with its beautiful tracking shots still look fresh and exciting.
But of course there are things that did not stand the test of time. Although you can't fault fashion too much, the ultra-hip, tight-rolled-up-jeans, neon-lit, late-80's look really dates the film. Also, the quirky story wich I once found so profound, made me cringe for the most part.
If you have never seen this film before, you might enjoy it. But if you're like me, seeing this film again after many years, you'll still enjoy it, but you're left a bit disappointed. Oh well, chalk up another one to rose tinted glasses.",978566400,4,1003,4.608938547486034
7888095,5,6305371636,"Though the plot is not original enough, still has some fresh elements, very Chinese style. My English is poor, can't tell the story well, 1st reviewer did a great job helps a lot. Fung San was Chinese version of "" Jack the Ripper "" travel  through time to present Hong Kong. ( Well, not actually "" Time Travel "" but frozen over three hundred years and resurrect, still young and alive.) Our hero took on the mission to chase after the rapist. Ching encounters with the streetsmart hooker Maggie,  She uses him as a servant / bodyguard and drag him into her deceiving world. Due to Ching's higher moral standard, he has a hardship to fit in ( fallen ) modern society, and split with Maggie when he find out her tricks. The whole process how he fells for this feisty, vigorous not-so-decent lady, has a struggle against his will, all the laughter came from. Fung San go with the flow  easily, still a villain/ robber/ murderer and about to strike again, living on the verge of dark society, Maggie became San's prey accidentally. The rescue leads to the final showdown between Ching and San, Maggie was took as a hostage, Ching must prove his love for her, to save her life, and will he sacrifice for her? Basically the storyline is the martial arts version of "" Time After Time "", more hilarious, action packed, and shows off both Yuen's solid stunts, I mean "" real stunts "" especially rare to find in recent years H. K. films. Unlike Jackie Chan, How to describe Yuen Biao's characteristics ? His small figure make him "" as light as a swallow "" looks as if he can leap so high and flying without a wire. Besides, he can act in this one.",977270400,3,1636,4.428571428571429
