8697013,4,B00S1VR6Z2,"Very satisfied with the quality of the images.  Great value.  Movies dated?  Well, of course.  But this is 'Liz Taylor.  You gotta have 'em.",1476316800,,140,4.666666666666667
8697014,3,B00S1VR6Z2,"The set is really only worth owning for X, Y and Zee, which provides a decent picture quality.  Doctor Faustus has a pretty good quality image also but it's a rather boring film and more of a showcase for Richard Burton.  Elizabeth has no speaking parts in the film, just appears here and there as a temptress to Burton.  Last Tine I Saw Paris sports a not too good video quality and there are probably better versions out there.  Driver's Seat is not really a great movie and even worse the video quality is that of bad VHS.  So, for the low price, this is worth getting for X, Y and Zee.",1457049600,2,589,4.223214285714286

8697016,5,B00S1VR6Z2,"The quality of the films are good, but I would recommend Warner Archive's, The Last Time I Saw Paris version. The first two films are quite good and one these films was released MOD and it's pressed here. The Driver's Seat's quality is good but it's not the best. There isn't any bonus features and there's no subtitles, and English is the only audio. Overall I would recommend for the first two films.",1426723200,7,402,4.52054794520548
