For one like me who has been involved with this particular sport for many decades and who knows personally quite a few of the people in the film and involved in the event, this is an awesome product.

The quality of the film presented is topnotch and it seems like it was just filmed. Considering this was an independent film created for a short 1-time TV showing as a segment in a 1-hour TV show is incredible. This was not created as a hi-budget feature movie. It was expected to be edited to a 15-20 minute portion of the weekly ABC Wide World of Sports show. The production is amazing considering the logistics and the fact it was 1968! This event is very difficult for video production now over 40 years later. In-Car film done with ""film cameras"" actually do a fine job of showing how rough the ride was for the participants. Sure, one can do video like that now with a $150 digital video camera, but for the time it's incredible.

My one negative comment is that in this production, like every attempt to film the event or other offroad races since, is that it doesn't show the hundreds of entrants and thousands of other participants involved in this event. An uneducated observer will get the impression that only a handful of famous participants are involved. Coverage of the Indy 500 often shows a view of the 33 starters howling down the front straight taking the green flag together. It doesn't work that way in desert offroad racing, they take off 1 at a time. But it would be great for some videographer to cover the long line of racers and show the quantity and variety.

Bottom line is that I LOVE IT!!!!! As I've loved every film I've ever seen by  Bruce Brown and family. The 3rd generation of the Brown family is doing a great job. Obviously well taught by Grandpa Bruce. I say ""Collect the whole Set!""",1305504000,2,1907,4.471264367816092

2351796,5,B000A2UBKW,"I just received the video and I've already seen it twice. It is very inspiring. The movie really makes you feel how hard it was to go through the baja 1000.  The way the movie was made and the look of the commentator really takes you back in the 60's

If you like off road races then this is a must see video.

8072657,4,B000A2UBKW,"It's pretty cool to watch this knowing it's essentially a Bruce Brown production, but it is missing the narration that only he can provide. It really is an episode of Wide World of Sports, but still cool as a document of an amazing race. Just don't expect a classic Bruce Brown movie!",1471651200,,284,4.480769230769231
