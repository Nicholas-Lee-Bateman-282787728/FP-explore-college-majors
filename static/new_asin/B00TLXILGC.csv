7012919,5,B00TLXILGC,Great movie for children,1433721600,,24,5.25
7012920,4,B00TLXILGC,"LOTS OF FUN AND ABOVE PAR FOR DIRECT TO VIDEO - PERHAPS NOT A CLASSIC

There are plenty of recognizable stars doing the voice-over for this fun feature and the animation was reasonably good.  For younger kids who love dinosaurs in particular, it might be a hit.  For direct to video, it's really not bad and I thought their injection of expressions on the characters faces was better than expected for a lower budget CGI.  I did notice the mouth movements were not as tightly matched considering the good facial expressions.  I would also say the feel was a lot more like watching Saturday morning cartoons rather than a high budget animated feature.  That doesn't have to be a bad thing.  There is kind of a cool soundtrack here and there which is not oriented to a musical format.  Just a little edgy guitar and alternative feel, rather than Disney sing-along.

THE PLOT (no spoilers):  Ernie (played by the voice of Bobby Hill - Pamela Adlon from King of the Hill) is an energetic and active young boy who loves dinosaurs and visits to the local dinosaur museum called Terra Dino.  Max is his best buddy and partner in antics who is the son of an amateur inventor.  They hatch a plot to sneak into a local exhibit to see a new set of dinosaur bones but are foiled by Ernie's pesky younger sister Julia.  Though Ernie is grounded, he sneaks off again to Max's house (trailed by Julia of course) and they inspect a time machine being worked on by Max's father.  Through a series of mishaps, the children are transported back millions of years to what Ernie calls the high Cretaceous period.  Yes, the movie is called Back to the Jurassic (I assume because it has a better ring).  The time machine happens to be shaped like an egg and during the process a real tyrannosaurus egg is sent forward in time to Max's house in replacement.  As it happens, the machine lands in the nest of a kindly tyrannosaurus mother who adopts stray dinosaurs while her own egg has never hatched.  That's the same egg sent to present day.  She mistakes the children for her own offspring and the mildly disobedient Ernie finds one restrictive and doting mother replaced with another.  This sets up all the high jinx as the kids work on one end and the parents work on the other to set things straight.  Complicating it all are the malevolent Sarco brothers (bigger and badder dinos than a T Rex) who might want to eat someone for dinner!

OTHER THOUGHTS:  The voice acting is quite good overall.  Ernie's real mother is played by Jane Lynch and the dino mother is played by Melanie Griffith.  The Sarco are played by brothers Stephen and William Baldwin.  It's fairly light and good hearted.  For parents really particular about content there is some burp and fart humor, not to mention the idea that the kids would not have their adventure if they didn't disobey their parents.  However, the parents (including dino mom Tyra) help save the day.  The themes are positive.  I make no judgments and leave it to each family to decide.  I recommend a rental to check it out before you buy.",1433635200,8,3065,4.568807339449541

8702252,3,B00TLXILGC,"Ive gone on record countless times expressing my disappointment in the practice of taking a foreign CG film, slapping an English dub over the visuals and calling it a new movie.  Sadly it happens far more often than most people realize; but they certainly discover why its so unsuccessful the moment they sit their kids in front of the screen with the DVD they rented from the Redbox.

That being said, every once in a great while a CG film born of this tactic defies all the odds by being watchable- and even rarer still, dare I say enjoyable.

Back to the Jurassic comes to us by way of South Korea in the form of a 2012 computer generated animated feature film known as Dino Time.  It comes in at a run-time of 88-minutes and, oddly enough, wears a PG rating despite being more all-ages-friendly than most domestic animated efforts of late.

In any event, you have to give the English dub distributors (Alchemy) credit on their marketing strategy- this one was released 10 days before the blockbuster Jurassic World here in the US and, worse still, actually steals the tag-line from the original Jurassic Park film: An Adventure 65 Million Years in the Making.  Lets hope Universal Pictures is too busy to notice.

Anyway, the story here tells of rocket-skateboarder and all around rebellious kid Ernie (voiced by King of the Hills Pamela Adlon) and his exploits in his fictional home town of Terra Dino.

Ernie, like most of Terra Dinos residents, is quite the dinosaur buff and, with nerdy best friend Max (Yuri Lowenthal) decides to go behind closed doors at the local dinosaur museum for a closer look at the bones theyve been collecting.

After a groundation that doesnt stick, Ernie escapes to Maxs house where the two of them, along with Ernie's sister Julia (Tara Strong) end up inside of one of Maxs dads (voiced brilliantly by Fred Tatasciore) inventions: an egg-shaped time machine.

As you may have predicted, the trio find themselves in the Cretaceous (perhaps Back to the Cretaceous wouldnt have allowed them to steal Jurassic Parks tag-lines) and face to face with a mother T-Rex (Melanie Griffith) who, aside from being pink, seems to think the strange little mammals in her nest are her own hatchlings.

Factor in a pair of evil two evil Sarcosuchus brothers (voiced by real-life brothers Stephen and William Baldwin), a wacky colorful dino named Dodger (Rob Schneider), a few gas-spewing simpleton prehistoric birds and you have all the makings of a colorful, silly romp.

About the films greatest strength, aside from securing a surprisingly capable English cast, is an intelligently written script; especially in the early goings of the film.  As in our time.  Once the dinos enter the equation, things do take a step back in terms of humor, wit and plot strength but it is also likely the target age-group here will be much more forgiving.

The visuals are bright and clean with nice character models and surprisingly adequate animation cycles.  In fact, their ability to match voice with mouth flaps is also uncannily smooth throughout.  Another one of those small details that goes a long way.

All in all, Back to the Jurassic is simple, mindless entertainment that will likely appeal to kids for its linear plot and bright dinosaur models.  Adults won't be completely tortured as is so often the case with dubs; in fact, until the talking dinos portion of the show, there may even be enough wit to keep them smirking as well.",1488412800,,3453,4.812182741116751
