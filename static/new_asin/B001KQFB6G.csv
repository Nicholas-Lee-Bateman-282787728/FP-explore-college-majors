8315865,2,B001KQFB6G,"Colorism is a within-race prejudice.  It's when dark-skinned people of one race are deemed inferior to their light-skinned counterparts.  I know Indians come in a huge array of complexions, but most of them are brown.  In this work, however, all of them look European or Middle Eastern.  Not a single person looks like Sanjay Gupta, M.I.A., Gandhi, or any other South Asian I know.
For more than a decade, books and programs for children have tried to promote multiculturalism and diversity.  These tales are diverse in origin, but they show the same faces and bodies that we've always seen.  How no one can be brown in a cartoon about pre-colonial India is ludicrous and Eurocentric.  I'd be very careful before I showed this to children of color.
Besides, the animation was cheap and some of the tales have morals with wich I disagree.",1254355200,,837,4.811188811188811
