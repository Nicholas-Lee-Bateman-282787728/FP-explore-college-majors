766895,4,6304054254,"An all too familiar timeless story yet it ends as the old story should. Well written, acted and casting. At a couple of times the actor's lines were read/spoken too fast and had to be reversed to hear properly, could be this critics hearing. :-]",1453680000,,245,4.466666666666667

767002,5,6304054254,"It was a g8t ""who dunnit"" movie!  Kept me on the edge of my recliner seat.  Wunnerful!  So good!  No crass sex scenes, ugly profanity or insipid plots like in today's flicks.  The B/W photography, the setting and the music takes you away on a magic carpet of some sort if you know what I mean. A marvelous mystery to boot and to love.",1432512000,,334,4.15625

Well written in a theatrical style. Fine cast. Resolution satisfying but could have been bleaker.",1428451200,,123,5.888888888888889
767076,4,6304054254,Movie was very well done cast was brilliant and Gene Tierney as beautiful as ever drags out at times but overall worth seeing,1428105600,,125,4.478260869565218

767078,3,6304054254,"Fun to see a very young Glynis Johns. Gene Tierney was gorgeous as always. The movie was somewhat predictable and found it hard to relate to any of the characters. Still it was watchable. Not bad, but not great.",1426291200,,211,4.435897435897436

767081,5,6304054254,"Glynis Johns, young, romantic school girl.  Gene Tierney, fragile, revealing.  Leo Genn, integrity incarnate.  What a puzzler from start to finish!  No cliche' reactions from anyone.  The pacing and writing are quite well-done, the characters are constantly unpeeling layers of personality, you don't know how they will react to one another, if there's any trust, if there's any reason to trust.  I really didn't know how this would end!  Wonderful acting by entire cast, although the Aunt is a bit...over the top or stiff, couldn't make up my mind.  You really should watch this film without interruptions, so have your popcorn ready and turn off the cell phone.",1410652800,,663,5.074074074074074
767082,4,6304054254,"The plot is predictable, but the storyline kept my interest.  Leo Genn was perfect for his part; reserved but sensual.....and not entirely innocent. The kind of love story that continues to repeat itself.  Susan",1399334400,,211,5.176470588235294
767223,5,6304054254,I had seen the movie many years ago and yet the movie is worth seeing again. It is a classic. Keeps your attention and riveted to the screen.,1391126400,,141,4.071428571428571
767224,4,6304054254,"I had never heard of this film before looking through available titles on Amazon prime. The casting seemed a bit odd in that the college girl seemed too old and the teacher didn't seem like anyone's first crush. That being said I like film noir type movies , ""B"" movies, and old black & white movies.  I am not quite sure how or why Gene Tierney ended up in this movie. The storyline is a reminder of just how a gesture or selfish decision can lead to gossip with many unintended consequences. There are many movies that one might call cheesy that I can watch over and over again. This movie is NOT one of them. Once is enough for me.",1388880000,,634,4.239669421487603
767225,1,6304054254,I did not even finish this film - something about seemed all wrong. Maybe it was me. See what YOU think.,1388102400,,104,4.0
767226,2,6304054254,"Hard to believe Gene Tierney's husband character, a university professor in England, was handsome enough to have young women students infatuated with him.  And harder to understand, Gene's jealousy, or concern.  Ms. Tierney's role in ""Leave Her to Heaven"", is a superior possessiveness display. Not sure I could get through this one again to see if I missed something.",1387756800,,368,5.220338983050848

767228,3,6304054254,a nice movie for a cold rainy day when you'd like to do nothing but drift and sleep. Excellent for sick days off the clock,1375660800,,122,3.92

767230,5,6304054254,"Not all classics hold up to today's scrutiny, which is why there are so many flawed re-makes.  However, this one works off a simple premise about human behaviour that still holds up today.  If it were a case for 2012, it would be featured on all those ""speculation"" crime shows that are all too popular today.  Yet, because it is not a modern film, and therefore keeps the telling of the story ""close to the vest"", it actually works better because it is stripped of the fanfare and false leads that are way too overdone in modern films.  I HAD to add my voice to these reviews, because I know what it's like when there are so few reviews and a person wonders if the film is worth the viewing.  Well, it is!!",1356134400,,707,4.285714285714286
767231,4,6304054254,"PERSONAL AFFAIR starts out as a conventional British soaper but quickly morphs into a bitter expose of the nastiness of rumor.  Leo Genn is Professor Barlow, an erudite and well-spoken teacher of Latin at an exclusive school in England.  His wife is Kay (Gene Tierney) and both seem to have it all.  They call each other ""darling"" incessantly as she complains that his teaching takes him away from her.  This call to duty soon takes a corrosive bent in her mind as she learns that one of her husband's students Barbara (Glynis Johns) has a massive crush on him and follows him about unseen as he takes walks.  He may not see her as she tails him but the nosy neighbors certainly do.  As he takes time to coach her for an exam, the town's tongues begin to wag.  Things take a morbid turn when she disappears for three days and now Barlow is not only rumored to have an affair with her but also has killed her to end it.  No one in the town, not even Kay, is immune to the lurid possibilities.  PERSONAL AFFAIR is a ruthless expose of how supposedly ""good"" people can let their imagination run riot.  Genn is convincing as a dedicated teacher who analyzes the complexities of poetic love in his classroom but is clueless when the real thing appears right under his nose.  PERSONAL AFFAIR is a sobering wake up call that to see love only as an intellectual excuse for poetic moralizing may lead to tragic consequences.",1281744000,,1415,4.48828125
767232,4,6304054254,"This is one of Gene Tierney's most overlooked films. Being a fan of Gene's I love almost anything she is in, and this film is no exception. A very interesting story about the obsession of a young girl for her teacher. Gene plays the wife of the teacher and Leo Genn is the man being sought after by Glynis Johns (who was actually 30 years old but played a much younger person.)
The action in the film takes a surprising turn when the girl vanishes and the teacher is now the #1 suspect-
Great movie for a rainy afternoon!",1212796800,,521,4.2727272727272725

7859963,3,6304054254,What you would expect from this period in film making. It's really hard for someone who has lived through the brief enlightenment of the late sixties and seventies to remember how totally absurd the post war era was. The laws governing human behavior were medieval! They are threatening to become that way again.,1470700800,,312,4.90566037735849

7859966,5,6304054254,Simple premise. Fantastic plot. Out of this world casting and acting. A classic for all times. And the scenes are great too.,1468627200,,124,4.681818181818182
7859967,5,6304054254,"A very thought provoking movie. Gene Tierney is that luminous self, extremely well acted movie throughout.",1463788800,,106,5.6875
7859968,3,6304054254,"Superficially, ""A Personal Affair"" is like every one of Carol Burnett's ""Late Late Late Late Late Show"" parodies rolled into a single production. I frequently found myself laughing out loud at scenes that are meant to be completely dramatic and serious.  If you can imagine Gene Tierney channeling Carol Burnett parodying Gene Tierney, then you know everything you need to know about Kay Barlow.  Though leading man Leo Genn is more subdued, he does not completely avoid Harvey Korman territory with his stoic but bumbling aloofness as professor Stephen Barlow.

I will give credit to Glynis Johns for her deftly understated performance as love-struck schoolgirl Barbara Vining, but her spurned spinster aunt Evelyn (played by Pamela Brown) exists for no reason but to generate feigned tension and suspicion.  Her part is completely unnecessary and is arguably the main reason ""A Personal Affair"" takes on its unintended comedic overtones.

Though it may sound like I'm being harsh, the story itself was compelling enough for me to stick with it, and I'm glad I did.  Beneath the melodramatic veneer lies an interesting examination of how rumor and innuendo can destroy a person's reputation and cause heartache and pain to loved ones and associates.  It also serves as a cautionary tale, illustrating the consequences of half-truths and self-serving misdirection, especially when your 'crime' is but a minor indiscretion or a moment of bad judgment.

In summary, I'm not willing to point my finger at the actors or director for lines and scenes that come across as overwrought and maudlin a half century later.  More than anything, this movie is a victim of time and constantly evolving production values and viewer sensibilities, but unlike some movies from this era (see ""Whistle Stop"") ""A Personal Affair"" is good enough and is especially built upon a story solid enough to redeem it as a worthwhile sick day or rainy weekend movie.",1462060800,,1936,5.12063492063492
7859969,3,6304054254,"I like the actor and actresses in this movie, but the plot was little off color.",1461801600,,80,4.0625
7859970,4,6304054254,"Good classic retro movie. Probably considered somewhat saucy for the time, but tame today. Suspenseful.",1461715200,,103,5.933333333333334
