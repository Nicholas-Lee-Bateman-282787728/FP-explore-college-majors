8754480,5,B01D01K5PU,"I just saw this movie and liked it so much I had to buy it.  First movie I have purchased in 3 years.  Well done.  Acting very impressive for such a low-budget film.  In particular, Mike Pfaff and C. Thomas Howell excelled.  I have followed Mike Pfaff in other projects - The Librarians and as a neighbor in Two Broke Girls.  I love what he is doing.  Nice work by all.",1487462400,,369,4.112676056338028

8754482,5,B01D01K5PU,"In Lazarus Rising, Mike Pfaff once again shows us his versatility as an actor.  His commitment to his craft, doing some of his own stunts, and ability to play roles with an inner sense of the character should really offer - at least some insight - to what Pfaff adds to the discipline of method acting.  The great method actors; Pacino, DeNiro, etc may have the opportunity, dare I say, to learn something from Pfaff's sense of honesty and purity to acting.  Pfaff ""gives himself"" to his character, saving Emma at all costs, with no compromise.",1479945600,,544,4.645833333333333
8754483,5,B01D01K5PU,"Awesome action film with a lot of unexpected twists and turns that keep you guessing.  It mixes politics and crime, I guess they are really one in the same. Acting is convincing. For me it is a keeper.",1476576000,,201,4.2894736842105265
