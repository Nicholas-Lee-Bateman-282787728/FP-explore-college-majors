4102121,2,B003AIL24C,"I am a GIANT fan of the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series, and my friends and I were waiting with bated breath for the movie to come out.  I'll admit I had high expectations (after all, Chris Columbus did a FABULOUS job with Harry Potter) and they were totally dashed.  If one hadn't read the books, the movie would rate a solid 3.5.  Not amazing, but not total garbage either.  After reading the books however, this movie failed.  On so many levels.  I'm not going to bother explaining all the things they changed (that would take far too long!) but in general, it just didn't work.  It seems as if the people behind this movie skimmed the dust jacket and decided to create their ""own version"" of what happened.  It was just off.  The casting (although I did love Grover), the character of Annabeth seemed like a bad Clarisse-Annabeth hybrid, and Logan Lerman as Percy was hot as hell, but the character was so different from the book, as were all the others.  An okay movie, but for anyone who has read the book, a complete disappointment.",1266105600,7,1046,4.51595744680851
4102122,5,B003AIL24C,"First, let me say right up front that I have not read any of the Percy Jackson books.  My 12  year old has read them all and loved them, but I did not read any of them before seeing PERCY JACKSON & THE OLYMPIANS: THE LIGHTNING THIEF tonight.  And while I see many, many similarities to the Harry Potter series, I really enjoyed THE LIGHTNING THIEF.  Although it feels a bit familiar, it is still a fun and exciting adventure.  And a very delightful family film.

Percy Jackson is a misfit, always in trouble and having difficulty in school.  He has a lot of trouble reading; the letters dance around the page.  The one place he feels at home is in the water.  Turns out, there is a good reason for that.  It seems that Percy is the son of the god Poseidon and a human mother.  And there are others like him, ""half-blood"" kids (demi-gods) who all attend a special camp to learn to use their powers and to protect themselves.  But now, the Earth is in danger.  Someone has stolen Zeus's lightning bolt.  If it is not returned by the solstice, then the gods will go to war.  And humanity will suffer the consequences.  Did Percy steal Zeus's bolt?  If not, then who did?  Can Percy and his companions Annabeth and Grover find the lightning bolt and return it to Olympus before the deadline?

As you can see from the above synopsis, there are huge parallels between Percy Jackson and Harry Potter - secret powers, a trio of friends, a special school, a dangerous quest, and the world in peril.  Add to that director Chris Columbus, who also happened to direct the first two Potter films, and you get a movie with a very similar look and feel.  But in this case, the copy holds up well to the original.  THE LIGHTNING THIEF is a an enjoyable romp through Greek mythology with really great special effects, an engaging story, good acting, and an amusing touch of humor.  All-in-all, it made for a terrific evening out with my family.  And you can bet that I will be reading these books very soon.",1266019200,3,1990,4.418732782369146
4102123,4,B003AIL24C,"Here's a review that fans of the book and parents alike should find helpful.  Despite targeting a younger audience, Lightning Thief is actually a fun movie that grown-ups can also enjoy.

The Lightning Thief is based on the first novel in a five-book series by Rick Roardan.  Readers may be a bit confused by the film, as Percy is only 12 in the book, but 17 in the movie.  My guess is that Chris Columbus, who also directed Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber of Secrets, made the age change just to appeal to Harry Potter fans now in their late teens.

Logan Lerman (3:10 to Yuma) does a good job playing anxious teen Percy Jackson.  Uma Thurman is a terrific addition as Medusa, though she could have gotten more screen time.  While the concept of Greek Mythology in the future sets the film apart from Harry Potter, the chemistry between Percy and his two companions seems a little familiar.  What's great about Lightning Thief are the frequent comic interjections by Brandon T. Jackson (Alpa Chino in Tropic Thunder), playing Percy's wisecracking best friend.

Parents, here's the rundown: Teens and tweens will enjoy the movie's visuals, but a few fight scenes (Furies & Hydra) might frighten your little ones.  Rosario Dawson is gorgeous as  Persephone, the seductive wife of Hades; though her suggestive lines will go over most kid's heads.  For adults who aren't into Harry Potter movies, you'll still find the visuals fun, and the movie entertaining.

Take my advice about one thing: Don't finish watching the movie when the credits start rolling.  You'll be in for a fun surprise if you hang in there for just a minute ;)",1265932800,8,1625,4.777777777777778
4102124,4,B003AIL24C,"**If you have not read the books, this review DOES contain possible spoilers. If you have read them, then nothing here will be a surprise... hopefully.**

As an avid Percy Jackson fan, I knew that I had to go and see any movie based off Rick Riordan's tremendous book series. And when I heard wind that THE LIGHTNING THIEF was indeed coming out to theaters on January 12th, I made sure to take work off and be ready to see the midnight showing. Now that I'm fresh off the movie, I thought I would sit down and share my thoughts on the movie directed by Harry Potter's own Chris Columbus.

First off -- this is one of your basic book-to-movie adaptations. That said, some things HAVE to be cut for sake of time. I wouldn't mind watching five hours of one of my favorite books being turned into a movie, but I realize that most people can't sit still that long -- let alone the whole bathroom // eating situation. Unfortunately, a LOT of plot is cut from Riordan's first book in the series, leaving something that is still rich in and of itself, but is not quite as complex as the book. There are also a lot of subtle changes that will probably irk book purists: such as Annabeth's hair being brown instead of blonde, Annabeth's blue eyes vs. gray eyes, and Grover being African-American (which I LOVED). Set that aside, there are also a couple of major plot points that are skewed in order to fit the two hour time slot.

One thing I will note is the fact that a couple of the early action scenes didn't seem as ""dangerous"" to me. I didn't feel like the characters were in as much danger as they were supposed to be. It seemed like pretty quick fixes altogether at the beginning, and I would have loved to see those battles drawn out just a bit.

**MOVIE SPOILER**

As a double warning, this section contains spoilers on the major plot of the movie. The main thing I missed from the book plot was the over-arching plot introduced in the series about the big prophecy and the children of the big three gods: Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades. This plot was completely thrown out the window (for now anyway), and also Kronos is not barely even mentioned. The actual thief of the master bolt is changed, which didn't bother me as much, but definitely changed the dynamic of the storyline. To be honest, I wouldn't have minded if Columbus had just added on another 30 minutes to the movie and given us this storyline. I would have loved to watch more.

**END MOVIE SPOILER**

Okay -- my nit-picking aside, there were quite a few GOOD things to love about this movie. For instance, Uma Thurman's appearance as Medusa was inspired and insanely creepy, and definitely it goes down as one of my favorite sequences. The whole set-up of her Garden Emporium was downright freaky and definitely made me jump. The other great thing was actually the look of Camp Half-Blood. It is changed a bit from the books, but the realistic direction they tilted was perfect. Capture the flag was great, as well as a scene in the Nashville parthenon (which is quite changed from the book). Also, the manner in which they have to travel across the USA was a perfect plot improvement that changed encounters with monsters from random chance occurences and giving them a reason to have to face such horrible things.

Acting-wise, there were only a couple clunker lines that kind of fell flat, but overall the cast did a fairly manageable job of their roles, with a few shining moments (such as Uma Thurman) thrown into the mix. Logan Lerman does a decent job portraying Percy, albeit a bit older than he is in the books, but that didn't bother me too much. To be perfectly honest, I don't quite know why they chose to change Annabeth so much at least in looks, but it ended up working out okay.

THE LIGHTNING THIEF is definitely a good movie for families to enjoy, but do be aware for really little kids there are a couple pretty frightening scenes. My main advice is this: Forget the story you love in the book and go see the movie as a separate story altogether that uses characters and events from the books. Overall, with the time constraints that they had, the movie crew did a fairly good job of boiling down Riordan's book as best they could.

Here's crossing my fingers for THE SEA OF MONSTERS...",1265932800,3,4267,4.494193548387097

The movie itself, outside of not following the books at all, is so poorly done its amazing that they made the sequel.
The structure of the plot is chaotic, disjointed, with uneven.  The writing is unnecessarily simplistic, boring, and condescending.  It treats the children this movie is target to as simpletons.  The acting is flat and uninspired.
If they were going to steer so far from the books they might have at least TRIED to write something that was good.
As far as a book adaptation goes this is one of the worst I have ever seen.  The old 1970's adaptation of The Hobbit (as crazy as it was) is a far better attempt than this even tries to be.  The original book is a straight forward story that could have been adapted almost page-for-page and worked fine as a movie.  Very little needed to be changed to make it work on screen.",1520121600,,873,4.459119496855346

NOT FOR FANS OF THE BOOK. Various changes were made to increase the adventure aspect.

4102164,3,B003AIL24C,"If you have never read the books, you might like the movie. My children did. I was surprised to learn that my oldest son - who has read the books and truly loves them - liked the movie too. He didn't seem to mind the many mistakes and exclusions. However, I have read the books and thought the movie was a very poor adaptation. In the past other directors have done such a good job at adapting Harry Potter, and Lord of the Rings, that I was looking forward to the movie version of the Percy Jackson fantastic books. Unfortunately, the movie is merely inspired-by the book. It includes a number of events that never took place, and excludes critical characters (e.g. Mr. D, Ares, Clarisse) and events (e.g. life and struggle in and out of camp, dreams, visit to Oracle, Percy being tricked by Ares, Hades helm). The casting is poor, in terms that it doesnt hold true to the book, and there is such extend of mixed up, and made up situations that sometimes is really hard to follow - if you have read the book. Lastly, although still PG, the movie is inexplicably and unnecessarily sexualized. It is hard to understand how they could possibly miss this opportunity. After all, all they needed to do was stick to the book. The story is phenomenal - why change it? Big disappointment.",1516752000,5,1281,4.502145922746781

Rick Riordan must have no creative say, or just saw dollar signs.
The female lead was turned into a helpless love sick girl, where in the book (like Hermione) is strong and a leader.
Its unfortunate that a book can be this badly destroyed.

4102214,2,B003AIL24C,I will go ahead and be that person and say that the books were better than the movies. If anyone that watched it read the books they would say the same thing. This series had a lot of potential to be the next Harry Potter series but unfortunately they didn't have David Yates as director or David Heyman as producer. If they had them doing what they did on the Harry Potter series this series would be just as good.,1496275200,,415,4.2

I know that there are always differences between books and their movies, but sometimes I felt like the only similarities between this movie and the book were character names. I thought people complaining about the differences were exaggerating - they weren't. From arbitrary changes (like why make Riptide a click pen instead of uncapping it? Why turn Mrs Dodds into the English teacher instead of the math teacher? Why isn't Percy at boarding school?) to ones that seem to go completely contrary to the ethos of the books, the movie is just one change after another. If you've never read the books and never will, you will probably enjoy the movie. If you even think you might want to read the books, please read them instead of watching - the story is much better.",1494633600,,871,4.699346405228758

It's better to eat popcorn when you watch the movie.

it was better the second time.

4102287,3,B003AIL24C,"What i like about the movie:
- great plot line
- First scene is kinda random.
- Amazing water powers
- Cool edits
- Great sets

What I don't like about the movie:
- How it made Poseidon is the blame for the gods are not able to visit their children
- ""I USED TO DATE YOUR DADDY""
- Pretty sure no dudes or gals like having a relationship with a satyr
- Sean Bean's character didn't die
- bad choreograph on sword fighting

Questions for this movie:
Why is a fury is scared of the centaur?
Why was the lightning bolt stolen?
How was the lightning bolt stolen?
Why no one noticed that the lightning bolt is in camp?
Why no one suspects children of Hermes? (he's the god of the thief's)
Did Chiron just have some random sword in hand? (to give to new demigods)
I people have the insurance to pay for the damage....
Why does the gods have really small chairs? They should've had thrones, but they're just chairs
Why didn't Sean Bean die? Oh yeah because he's Zeus.
Why does hepatheus looks good? I mean I can't see anyone that's ugly. Maybe he's just ugly in olympian-level

4102342,1,B003AIL24C,"I want to start with a disclaimer. I very rarely like movies based on books, especially if they don't even make an attempt to follow the story line. That being said, I HATE this movie. Not only does it corrupt one of the funniest, smart, and good natured adventure books I have ever read, in itself, it is a bad movie. It lacks in character development, interest, or a comprehensible plot. It is unfaithful not only to its source material (The Lightning Thief by Rick Riordan) but also to the source material of those books, Greek Mythology. It is reduced to just another movie about a teenager saving the world. It falls on plot lines, clichs, and stereotypes instead of embracing creative source material and refreshing characters. Truthfully, and it really pains me to admit this, if you haven't read the books, you probably won't think it is that bad. It may be stereotypical, but hey, stereotypes are stereotypes because they work. The real reason that I am so upset with this movie is that I love the books so much, and I don't understand why movies don't try to adapt more to their source material. If you are the kind of person who doesn't read books very often, and won't read the Percy Jackson series, then this movie was probably your only chance to be introduced to the fun, creative, and wonderful series that so captured my imagination when I first read the series. The Hunger Games and Harry Potter both show that being somewhat faithful to source material (even if you change plot and characters as in Harry Potter) can attract a wide audience and achieve critical and box office success. I mean, Catching Fire literally took large amounts of dialog directly from the books! But I digress. It really comes down to this. You can watch this movie, if you haven't read the books, you might even enjoy it. But you should know that in watching this movie, you don't get to know one of the best contemporary stories out there, and you're really missing out. If you heard about Percy Jackson, and you want to experience it, read the book, if you don't want to read it, listen to the audiobooks. As far as I'm concerned, this isn't Percy Jackson.",1473724800,,2154,4.611979166666667

But about the movie...

Honestly, the acting was flat, the plot silly, and the special effects mediocre by today's standards. The basic premise seemed odd - there are demigods among us and they feel like loosers because their spectacular abilities manifest as ADHD? Doubt it. And one of them stole Zeus' lightning? How, exactly, and why? The answer turned out to be ""I don't care"". Which is about what I have to say about the whole film.",1471564800,,709,4.488372093023256

She has really gotten into the books so she was really looking forward to the movie.  From what she said there was practically nothing linking back to the book.  Whole sections of the book are missing, important plot lines missing, characters not reacting correctly, etc (and a lot more coming from my daughter). Not ONLY that the mythology is completely unfaithful to the Greek characters.  It seems like it is just meant to be a teeny-bopper heart- throb movie.

4102381,5,B003AIL24C,"HALF-BOY, HALF-GOD, ALL HERO!!....the Tagline says it all. Percy Jackson is your quintessential pre-teen, dyslexic and suffering from ADHD. Getting into unexplainable scraps and shuffled from school to school, he pretty much accepts the fact that hes destined to be......well, one big Loser.

Little does he know that hes a Half-Blood, an off spring of a powerful Greek God and a mortal woman. And there is a special place for him, Camp Half-Blood which houses and protects other such demigods, nymphs, satyrs and the rest of the celestial brigade.

But every thing is not peachy-keen in heaven. The Greek Gods are very much active in the western world, quibbling like normal siblings and ready to wage war at the drop of a hat. An important weapon has gone missing and unless it is recovered soon and handed over to its rightful owner, the Gods are willing to unleash their fury on the world.

So newly discovered demi-god, Percy has been given the dubious honor of retrieving the missing weapon. Accompanied by mates Annabeth and Grover, Percy sets off on his quest, battling icky monsters and vaulting over tricky situations.

The plot never loses its quirky pace and dangerous surprises spring up at every corner. Rick Riordan has dragged Greek Mythlogy out of the musty olbooks and given it a fresh and humorous angle. With every page, you find yourself ardently praying for a sequel, which I am glad to say.....THERE IS!!!",1470268800,,1428,4.912863070539419

4102503,3,B003AIL24C,"Every review on here has already said that this isn't anything like the book so I instead will base my review as if I had never read the book and as if I was just watching this movie with no previous experience with Percy Jackson.

If you don't sit there and count all the differences between the movie and the book the movie is pretty ok. The acting was ok and the characters were fun. The story makes sense, Percy doesn't become a hero because he wants to but because he has to.
Percy and his friend go on a quest reminiscent of Greek Mythology trying to find their way to the underworld to try and rescue Percy's mother who was kidnapped by Hades because everyone thinks that Percy stole Zeus's weapon. Along the way they meet monsters and gods from classic myths and discover the true identity of the thief.
Overall it was a fun movie that kids and teens will enjoy. And if you have a child you are trying to get into reason this movie might get them interested enough to try the book.",1460246400,,989,4.288770053475936

4102593,1,B003AIL24C,"My 7 year old is a very advanced reader and loved the Percy Jackson series. She wanted to watch the movie so I watched it first to make sure it was suitable for her age. First of all, they completely ruined the books with their trashy Hollywood revamping. Why could it not have been as the original, with middle schoolers still as the main characters, instead of high schoolers and tons of sexual innuendo? So intelligent middle schoolers are being dumbed down to, just like with the terrible trashy shows on TV. All the good this series has done in terms of education and intelligence was completely sucked out of the book when doing the movie.  In addition, despite an all star cast  - I was sure it would be amazing for that reason alone - the acting was subpar, even by the elite like Pierce Brosnan. And the script was written, again, like those ridiculous TV shows being put out for kids now with beautiful but plastic no name actors. The jokes were also in that sphere - not even deserving of eye rolls. I can't believe they thught their cheap jokes could substitute the truly clever ones from the books.

4102677,5,B003AIL24C,"and they're up to their old tricks, having childrendozens, if not hundreds, of themwith mortals.  One of these, though he doesnt know it, is Percy Jackson (Logan Lerman), who is a son of Poseidon (Kevin McKidd) by human Sally (Catherine Keener).  Soon after he was born, Zeus (Sean Bean) proclaimed that none of the Olympians could have any contact with their halfling children, and Poseidon, though he loved both Sally and Percy, was forced to leave them.  Diagnosed with dyslexia and ADHD (which are in reality symptoms of how his half-divine system is hardwired), Percy attends a special academy for kids with learning disabilities, and maintains a barely civil relationship with his stepfather, Gabe Ugliano (Joe Pantoliano), until one day, on a field trip to the museum, hes confronted by a substitute teacher (Maria Olsen) who transforms into a Fury and demands that he return the lightning bolt.  Suddenly he finds himself being hustled home by his best friend, the handicapped Grover (Brandon T. Jackson), and hurried into the family car by his mother for a journey deep into what is presumably upstate New York (though thats never specified).  Here, hidden away in the forest, is Camp Half-Blood, staffed chiefly by centaurs, including Chiron (Pierce Brosnan), whom Percy has heretofore known as a wheelchair-bound teacher, Mr. Brunner.  Percy learns that there are many children like himself, some living out their lives in quiet anonymity, others training here to use their powersand that Grover is a satyr and his personal Protector.  He meets Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario), whose mother is Athena (Melina Kanakaredes), and Luke (Jake Abel), a resentful son of Hermes; discovers that the lightning bolt is Zeuss personal possession, the most powerful weapon ever known, and recently stolen from him, a crime for which he blames Percy (why is never explained); and that he can call watersalt or freshto use as a weapon, or draw strength and healing energy from it.  But unless the lightning bolt is returned to Zeus by the summer solsticeonly days awaythere will literally be war in Heaven, with the various gods taking sides as they did at Troy, and this time the strife may well spread to and destroy Earth itself.  So, barely trained at all, Percy sets out to find the bolt, with Grover and Annabeth as his companions and several very useful giftsa sword and shield, a magical map, and a pair of winged sneakersprovided by Luke.  The threesome will face a Gorgon (Uma Thurman), a Hydra, and Hades (Steve Coogan) himself, get trapped in Lotus-Land, get some unexpected help from Persephone (Rosario Dawson), and rescue Percys mother from the Underworld before finally confronting a council of the gods.

The special effects are, of course, splendid, and the integration of the world of mythology with modern-day reality is intriguing, although, as is probably true of the book from which it was taken (and which I haven't read yet), the movie does throw a couple of curveballs into Greek mythology: the only Gorgon who could be killed at all was Medusa, a job Perseus (Percys namesake, obviously) already did some 2500 years ago; Athena, like Artemis, was a virgin goddess (although perhaps in Percys Universe that simply means that she doesnt dally with other immortals).  All the same, Ive enjoyed it thoroughly and hope there are sequels in the works.",1441411200,,3367,5.0359712230215825

The movie changed so many plot points- key plot points- that provided meaningful character development. The minor baddies from the book became the main baddies here, and the main baddies from the book were completely missing. The strong, well-rounded female characters in the book became either sex objects or sex objects with swords. As a result, the characters were flat, with zero development, and the story was filled with plot holes.

All in all: the movie doesn't tell the same story as the books, nor does it have the same characters. The only similarities were names and family ties.",1435795200,8,752,4.829457364341085

The major plot changes were what bothered me the most, but a couple of other things also reminded me why I hate cookie-cutter Hollywood movies. In the book the kids have just finished 6th grade. They're 12 years old. In the movie they make them high-schoolers. Why? Ohhhhhh, maybe so that they can create a love interest where there is no (clear) one in the book? We the audience are so lame that we cannot possibly be interested in a movie if there is no sex appeal, apparently.

4102763,4,B003AIL24C,"I've never read the books. My 8-year old daughter and I rented this movie and loved it. It had action, greek mythology, and a fun script and story-line.
I would say it's just as good as the Narnia stuff and maybe a small step below the Harry Potter movies. Probably better than the most recent Pirates of the Caribbean movies. It had some intense scary creatures so if you're kid is easily scared or has nightmares I would wait. I'm surprised at how many trashed this movie expecting it to be some deep oscar-worthy sci-fi, or epic Lord of the Rings (Thank god it's not that..This movie is a concise 2 hours) instead of just letting it stand on it's own. I also noticed that most of the people who rated it low were people who had read all the books. Most movies don't hold up to the books. I'd say if you and your kids are casual fans of this genre and like a fun story with a few little Greek myths thrown in..You will dig this movie.",1433548800,,936,4.23463687150838

4102776,2,B003AIL24C,"There was a diamond in the rough here that had the potential of being a gem; however, it was flawed during production.

My kids loved the books so much I read them too.  I've always had a soft spot for greek mythology, and I have to say the stories are well written and I enjoyed them as an adult.

From a ""I read the books and now watched the movie perspective"" I would have given this 1 star.  The books have a good cadence to them, and a plot build up that is cohesive and interesting.  Almost none of this was transposed to the silver screen.  A lot of potential wasted.

If I ignore the books and just take the movie at face value, I give the movie 2 stars.  It just left me with the feeling of a lot of cool special effects scenes sewn together, with little-to-no plot.  For me the film can be summarized as ""A teenage angst movie, where the kids are demigods and are ticked at their immortal parents; however, our young heroes overcome that angst.""  Sad considering they had a terrific cast.

To draw a corollary:

I've also read the How to Train Your Dragon books and watched the movies.  That is another series both my kids and I enjoyed immensely together.  Imagine my surprise when I saw the first movie.  It diverted even more so from the books than ""The Lightning Thief;"" however, it was done really well.  I give that movie 5 stars and it is one of my favorite family films.

These are just my opinions.  Everyone has their own.  You may find the movie more enjoyable.",1432857600,,1482,4.304347826086956

4102799,3,B003AIL24C,"I read all of the series and the Heroes of Olympus series and honestly I was very sad. The movie skipped like 5 of some of the funniest chapters. I could go on and on all day so if your are reading this and you haven't seen the movie yet then these are some spoilers, so you can keep going on or if you are a real Percy Jackson fan then you will agree with me. So, first of all when Percy wakes up at Camp Half-Blood Annabeth is there and says her famous line,""You drool when you sleep."" And she isn't even there when Percy wakes up!!! In the movie Annabeth is like 20 and so is Percy,when they are like 12. One of the worst part is Annabeth she's a BRUNET!!!!!! Her eyes are blue instead of gray. The director forgot the chapter where they meet Ares and the old abandon water park. You know how in the book Ares gave them the bag with the bolt in it? Well I guess the director likes to change things up too much. Because Luke tricked Percy and gave him the shield with the bolt in it. When they are in the Underworld, in the book, Percy gave Grover his flying shoes. And Grover almost slipped into Tartarous, but no flying shoes go to Tartarous. And in Hades's palace, Hades looks alot like a rock person and in the book you imagine him like a goth. In the end when he's on the roof of the Empire State Building, his mom, Annabeth, and Luke Aren't there in the book. When Annabeth and Percy's mom go and Percy and Luke fight. THEY NEVER FIGHT IN THE BOOK!!!! Yeah so that was my review. Like it or nah. Oh yeah if you do get this movie you will notice that no one is wearing a Camp Half-Blood shirt!!!!! really you couldn't spare $150 to make it at least some what close to the book. Seriously read the book before watching the movie. Then you will agree with everything I say. ;)",1430611200,5,1781,4.106017191977077

4102802,4,B003AIL24C,"I've got to admit I didn't read Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief until January.  Yes, the fact that a movie was coming out got finally got me to read it.  When I did, I discovered a very fun book.  That got me hyped to see the movie version, which I finally did today.  While they took some major liberties with the story, I still enjoyed it.

Percy Jackson (Logan Lerman) is a high school student attempting to deal with his dyslexia and ADHD while just surviving the day.  And at night, he has to deal with a horrid stepdad (Joe Pantoliano).  At least he has a good relationship with his mother (Catherine Keener) and a best friend in Grover (Brandon T. Jackson).

His life changes one day when a substitute teacher turns into a horrid beast and tries to kill him.  That's when he learns the truth, the ancient Greek gods are real, and one of them is his father.

Unfortunately, things aren't going well on Mount Olympus right now.  Seems that Zeus' lightning bolt is gone, and Zeus (Sean Bean) thinks that Percy stole it.  Now Percy must team up with Grover (who turns out to be a satyr) and his new friend Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario) to find and return the stolen item before the gods go to war.  Can he do it?

This movie was produced and directed by Chris Columbus, the man behind the first two Harry Potter movies.  Considering how faithful those movies were, I am surprised at just how much the book was changed.  There are superficial changes (main character's ages, Annabeth's hair color) and some rather major changes, including added parts to the quest and some cut sub-plots.  Frankly, this robs the story and characters of the richness the book had.  So if you are going into this as a fan of the books, be prepared to see something different.

If you can do that, or are going in blind, you'll find a pleasant adventure movie.  Percy and his friends wind up making a journey across the US, making several stops along the way.  It feels like an epic journey, yet they still mange to set stuff up and bring it all in under two hours.  That's pretty impressive.  Each stop in the journey finds the gang up against a monster from Greek mythology.  I'm not completely up on my myths, but I knew enough to appreciate everything I saw.

And let me tell you, this movie is visually stunning.  There are tons of special effects, and all of them work.  One scene near the end is a little iffy, but that's the only one.  I loved getting lost in this world.

The acting is great as well.  The better known names are reduced to the small parts, but that wasn't a problem for me.  The main characters were all perfectly believable.  Pierce Brosnan has a small role as one of Percy's teachers.  But the scene stealer as far as the adults were concerned was Uma Thurman as Medusa.  She was perfectly creepy.

Speaking of creepy, obviously in Medusa's scene, we get some snakes.  Frankly, all the monsters that Percy and crew face could frighten young kids.  I think 9 or 10 and older should have no problem with anything seen here, however.

I just can't quite get past the details left out of the book.  I haven't read beyond book one (yet), so I don't know if any details were brought into the movie from later books.  But my favorite scene and the entrance to Hades were both changed here.  I kept filling in some of the character details in my head that seem rather important.  And I'm sure there is a plot hole concerning how Percy knew he had a deadline for his quest (but I'd have to rewatch to be sure).  One sub-plot is introduced and then dropped, so why even bring it up?

Those complaints aside, I definitely enjoyed The Lightning Thief.  If this is your introduction to the characters, I highly recommend your next stop is a bookstore to fill in some gaps.  If you already love the characters, do your best to lower your expectations, and you'll wind up enjoying the movie.",1430524800,,3905,4.4596888260254595

But after reading the books I decided to give it a go again and even though there are plenty of cringe worthy scenes and alterations made, I didn't hate it as much and actually appreciate it more.
There are some changes though that are just inexcusable and stupid. Why did Annabeth and Clarisse get merged into one character? This Annabeth is a bully half the time and a weird flirt the next. The actress did what she could with the part, but the character was not endearing.

Major plot points were missing (one, mentioning Thalia, was actually in the deleted scenes. The only reason I can see them cutting it was because they had decided at the time to drop any sequels?)

The actors do a fine enough job. In my opinion, it's the bigger names who seem to lack quality in the film. Maybe they felt it beneath them? (Uma Thurman did just fine though.) The kids are the ones that shine the most...if you can call them kids. In the books they were 12 at this point and here the actors are in their 20's.

Grover is made out to be a major pervert...even worse in the deleted scenes where he takes several snapshots of Aphrodite's breasts and makes a comment about them being implants.

The effects were nice, especially the water. It looked a little gel like, but I still liked it.

I plan to watch the sequel soon, I heard they did a better job and fixed some of the complaints people had.

As for the product itself, the Blu-Ray quality was fine, but didn't seem up to the quality of most other recent releases. My main complaint was that the digital version included doesn't give you the option to choose Ultraviolet and instead makes you choose Windows Media player or itunes. I'm pretty much fed up with Apple and their draconian way of treating customers and their walled ""garden"" that keeps you locked to their devices or the monstrosity my once favorite media player has become.

4102893,4,B003AIL24C,"I finally got around to watching this rather interesting movie.  After inundated with many episodes of NCIS (all series) and CSI (all series) I felt I
needed a change of pace and being interested in Greek and Roman mythology and history, I purchased these films as well as the book set.  I found
the movie very interesting, well made, cast well (with some exceptions) with a decent if rather unbelievable story line.  The young man and the young woman were exceptional, especially the beautiful girl.  I love women with dark hair and bright blue eyes and she had those.  The young man
was also quite attractive and has, I think, a good future in movies.  I did have a problem with some of the political correctness that seems to be a
necessity in movies and TV today.  They showed a black man God on Olympus and that simply is not factual; all the Greek and Roman Gods were
quite European.  Also the  Sataryr (!) was played by a young black man who seemed to be primarily the comedy relief.  Though perhaps I am nit-
picking, I like historical accuracy in stories.  Imagine if a blond haired, blue eyed Euro played Martin Luther King in a movie of his life.  Still, the
Sataryr (!) was well played and was a hero near the end.  I may have miss-spelled the goat-mans species name; forgive me.
  The  tale of the Madusa creature was accurate as depicted in the movie except that she was kills thousands of years ago by Perseus.  I guess
Hades brought her back.  The tale goes that Athena (that goodly wise Goddess)  discovered that the young Madusa who was a priestess of hers
had been raped by Poseidon but punished Medusa as if she was the guilty one and exiled her and condemned her to live forever and turn people
to stone when she looked at them.  And gave her a snake coffiere to boot.  Lovely Goddess Athena, lady of Wisdom and Justice!!!
  The tale of Hades is inaccurate: Hades was not an evil God, but he was a bit crabby be being stuck in the Underworld to watch over the dead.
Not all of the Underworld was bad: Tartarus was were all the evil people went to suffer for ever, but the Fields of Eleisium was a pleasant place
for the good (mostly the upper classes!) and a middle world for the rest of us, rather boring but no suffering.  there it is as I understand it.  In
most movies the God Hades is portrayed as evil, but in reality he really wasn't, just grouchy!  In the second of the ""TITANS"" movies, he became
rather good at the end.  But this film I think is fun, well done with a lovely young girl as a heroine,  some good  action including a near destruction
of the Empire State Building and lots of vertigo scenery.  Evil is vanquished at the end.  FOUR STARS for fun and imagination.  I  got my DVDs as
usual from Amazon.
  One more thing.  In the Odyssey there is character named Calypso who in fact may have been black.  And I think the Calypso in the ""PIRATES
OF THE CARIBBEAN"" may in fact supposed to be the same woman, as she was a Demi-Goddess.  So there!  Live long and Prosper!  Enjoy!",1424563200,,3014,4.370036101083032

4102929,3,B003AIL24C,"Let me just say something first of all: The only reason I gave it 3 stars was because I wanted to put 1, and by Amazon's terms 1 was 'i hate it.' I don't hate it, and 3 was 'it's ok', so I put 3.
  The movie as, well, a movie, is five stars! (*****) But when it comes to the movie compared to the book, only 1 star AT THE MOST. (*----)
If you believe the movie is wonderful, I'm glad you enjoyed it! But you have these options: a) Watch the movie and only the movie, enjoy it, and judge the entire series at that, b) Watch the movie, then read the book like I did, and realize how the movie is icky, and the books are awesome and such, and enjoy it much more, or c) read the book first and realize how amazing it is before you see Chris Columbus' huge mistakes.

Sometimes I want to go egg Columbus' house. He took out the best parts, added in lies and annoying junk, and then mixed it up. The combination of Annabeth and Clarisse: I'm dying. Please help me. Avenge me.
  Someday I will become a director, and make a 20th Anniversary Edition of this movie, fixing it and making it more like the book.
I cannot believe the 12 year-old characters are 17 in the movie, and they left out Ares and Kronos- my, my. But Persephone wasn't supposed to be there! And why is she an insane over-obsessed satyr-lover? And what did they do to meek, shy Grover? Why do the Aphrodite kids love him? Where did Percy get a house built by his dad? And everyone knows a video game system and computer would attract monsters like Hades knows. And Hades isn't bad. He just wanted his helmet back, not a world war. He didn't want war because the underworld was already crowded!
  The worst mistake Columbus made is he teen-ized it. He made it like many popular movies: A lovey-dovey connection between Annabeth and Percy, and of course adding 5 years to their lives! I even added a picture to show you. UGGGHHHH!!!

But yeah, if you don't like to read, enjoy!!!!! :)",1422144000,5,1943,4.232432432432432
4102930,2,B003AIL24C,"I was cringing when I watched this after I read the books. When it first came out, my friends dragged me to go see it, and I actually liked it. It was enjoyable, funny and not to mention Logan Lerman's looks. That was when I was ten, and I hadn't read any of the books. Well, here we are, five years later, and I'm on the House of Hades in the Heroes of Olympus series. Percy Jackson is amazing, the books are insanely good and the movie was horrendous compared to them. I feel SO bad for Rick Riordan. His incredible creativity and fantastic plot points were tarnished. Chris Columbus should be ASHAMED of himself. The movie missed so many great plot ideas, the characters are TWELVE, and they look EIGHTEEN. I don't understand how challenging it is to make them look like how they're supposed to look. Is it THAT hard to at least make Annabeth blonde?

Anyway, I managed to watch it again and, let me tell you, I was yelling at my computer screen, ""THIS IS SO WRONG! WHY!"" the entire time, to the point my brother asked me if I was okay. ***SPOILERS COMING UP***>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> First of all, I need to get this straight; WHY WAS THERE NO FIGHT WITH ARES? THAT WAS MY FAVORITE PART. What about Hades' Helm of Darkness? That's the entire point he captured Sally Jackson in the first place! Poseidon coming out of the water as a giant in the opening scene? What the heck? So many things made no sense, and many other things weren't explained or elaborated upon. In all honesty, I had a hard time sitting through it again without having outbursts of rage. The Percy Jackson series touched and still touches so many peoples' hearts, and to think that this movie ruined its reputation is astounding to me.

I only hope there will be a reboot in the future. This series deserves the attention and accuracy it earned. Another thing, when did Persephone suddenly become this over-sexualized woman who likes satyrs? WHERE is Thalia? Mr. D? Why is Chiron not a white stallion? Why did they miss out on Percy plummeting to his death only to be saved by water, and WHY does Hades show up at the camp in a Kronos-esque form? What's up with Grover not having his hat, and no acne? Why does Annabeth show no sign of having a crush on Luke? Since when is the Mist not a thing when the fisherman OBVIOUSLY saw Poseidon exiting the water? What about Percy and Sally's vacation to their little beach house, and Grover coming and retrieving Percy? Why is Medusa not an older woman with an accent? WHAT ABOUT THE CABINS AT CAMP HALF-BLOOD? Why DOES PERCY GET THE WEIRD OUTDOOR CABIN? WHY WOULD HIS FATHER ONLY BUILD IT FOR HIM? Where are the naiads and dryads and all the spirits of the wild? Since when does an English class go to a Greek exhibit with a supposed Latin teacher? Since WHEN are there other centaurs at the camp? Where's Clarisse? Since when are the Aphrodite girls into Grover? Why are Annabeth's eyes blue? Since when do Poseidon and Zeus have their little chats outside Olympus? Why DOES ATHENA even regard Annabeth?? What's with Annabeth throwing out weird romantic lines? She didn't even like him back then. Why is Hades like a weird rocker? He's supposed to be kinda traditional looking! Where's the waiting room for all the souls? WHY are Percy, Annabeth and Grover SO special to the point where they get a lone boat? What about the animals? The Hephaestus-Aphrodite Cupid-arrow scene, the Tunnel of Love??????

I'm sorry, there are just so many things wrong with this. I'm finished hoping for a third, better movie. They MUST redo everything, since they screwed it up. Try to enjoy, if you've read the books you feel me, but if you haven't, try to enjoy it then read the books and join all of us angry PJ fans. Very painful, very wrong and very sad to think what it could've been. Writers/producers/actors/director NEED to be thrown into Tarturus, ASAP!",1422057600,5,3870,4.573487031700288

The only saving grace of this experience was that she was as upset about the changes as I was. I understand having to scrap a ton of story in Harry Potter - that book was over a thousand pages. This one was 300. The original story was so much better, and I'm not even getting into casting issues and design. Big fat fail.

4102970,1,B003AIL24C,"I was not at first aware of the difference between the the book and movie until I had decided to actually read the books. Here is a list of what I thought about the movie during and after watching the second time.

Grover- wonderfully played by Brandon T. Jackson although he did make Grover a little more confident.

Annabeth- first of did annabeth just magically have brown hair? She also reminded me of the main antagonist  that they completely forgot, Clarisse! She ended up being the two smashed together, attitude and all (believe me, the two DON'T mix).

Percy- did not remind me of the person in the book, including the way he acted and behaved. Yes, the movies can't be exactly like the book but it can sure get close.

Other important things-
The percy and annabeth are both twelve in the book. I don't know if they wanted to aim the movie at teens or fans but they sure did not get my approval.

I did wish that they showed percy eating something blue or explaining what was going on the whole time.

Conclusion:
I am extremely sorry for Rick Riordan, this whole movie threw his writing  and dream for a good series in the trash.",1419984000,7,1140,4.447115384615385

The storyline is close enough to the book that it makes sense but the cinematography lacks the wow effect and does not come close to the magical and mystical settings of Half-Blood camp described in the book. The Harry Potter series were a treat for the eyes in that respect and I expected Percy Jackson to transport me the same way. It didn't.

People shouldn't get too caught up in petty details, but rather enjoy these movies for what they are: fun and entertaining adventures.  I love them even more than the Harry Potter movies!

4103083,1,B003AIL24C,This is one of those examples of a good book that was sanded down to Hollywood standards. Daughter and I both read book and were really disappointed.,1413676800,4,149,4.555555555555555
4103084,2,B003AIL24C,"I never do reviews with spoilers and if I ever did I'd give a warning, but for this movie I'll make the exception even though it's so loosely based on the book that it spoils absolutely nothing! I don't honestly know how it got away with it because not only did they miss out loads but changed the remainder so that it barely resembled the book. This might not be so bad if Rick Riordan's book wasn't so fricking amazing! When I wrote this review it had been a long time since I read the series but still I noticed so many differences I can't even imagine how bad it would be if I watched the movie again recently.

The director Chris Columbus has a lot to answer for that's for sure. You'd think that after directing a couple Harry Potter movies he'd know how to do it (stick to the book as much as possible) so I don't understand how he could stray so badly. I saw one fan say and I agree 100% ""not sticking completely to a Potter book...understandable, they are 1,000 pages each...Not coming close on a book 350 pages long...not forgivable."" I could make a list of everything major he missed including Kronos, Ares (a hell of a lot of Ares; there was no fight scene what so ever and he got no blame) plus Clarisse, Mr. D, the furys and the oracle. There was no prophecy. Just let that sink in a minute. No oracle: no life-changing, ground-breaking prophecy!

So don't watch the movie expecting any of these things and more, basically don't expect an adaptation of the book.

Don't even get me started on the actors... I could be petty and point out the smaller things like Annabeth's hair wasn't her signature blonde, or Poseidon wasn't wearing his signature Hawaiian shirts, but that could go on forever and it's easy enough to get over and even change in movies to come. However I can't believe how old they are. Percy Jackson was played by Logan Lerman who was 17 years old at the time, yet Percy is supposed to be 12. Same with Annabeth who was even older at 23 years old.

I can almost understand where Columbus is coming from but if he can make child actors work with Harry Potter what makes this so different? Especially since the whole series is working up to Percy's 16th birthday because of the prophecy... but oh wait! The missed that out didn't they... *rolls eyes*

Maybe if you're not a fan or simply haven't read the books you might enjoy this fan but I can't help but refer back and it honestly can't compare.

4103085,1,B003AIL24C,"this movie made sharknado look like a Grammy winning movie. I was very unsatisfied, for the book was so much better. some of the characters were also off. Annabeth was supposed to have blond hair, gabe should've been more fat, and Clarisse was forgotten all together. also in capture the flag, Annabeth was supposed to be on the same team as Percy. why in hell would they have made her part of the Ares team??? in conclusion, this movie sucked.",1413504000,3,444,4.5625

My sons were so disappointed in the movie that they stopped watching it half way through. I won't bother to watch the sequel.

They either found it boring, of having poor acting, or a dull plot line. If I could give this zero stars, I would. I do not recommend it to anyone.

Annabeth comes across as a rude brat and Grover has become some horny teenage boy. The greatest qualities of these characters were completely erased.

4103253,3,B003AIL24C,"I don't know how to pinpoint what went wrong with this. The books were set a bit younger than the movie, so the movie is full of tv show quality acting and dialog. The effects are great, and supporting cast is great, but if they were shooting for another Harry Potter, they fell well short.
It lacked the majesty and wonder of the Potter movies. This had the potential to be as majestic, you're dealing with the entire pantheon of Greek Gods, after all.
It has it's moments. My 8 year old liked it, but I wouldn't say he ""loved"" it.
I cringed more than once at the ""modern"" quippy dialog.
Think teen show with a $100 million budget.",1400112000,2,632,4.319327731092437

 There is a half horse Pierce Brosnan, and half goat guy. I was wondering how that happens. Was one of these characters parents a horse or goat.

From the very first scene, we knew they were butchering Riordan's awesome story.  I cannot imagine he would have approved this version.  We were so taken back by how off base the movie script was, that we actually didn't watch it all the way through.  The only thing that matched with the book for the 30 minutes we did see were the names.  What a shame!  Although I'm sure those who watched the movie without reading the book may have enjoyed it, we just could not get past such glaring differences between the book and movie.  My son's thoughts: some of the differences that I noticed in the 30 minutes we watched were that Luke didn't have his white scar on his cheek, Annabeth has blonde hair, not brown and grey eyes, Annabeth and Percy didn't fight in capture the flag, they were on the same team (and Percy didn't get the flag, Luke did.)etc. If you have read the book I would not recommend you to watch the movie.

But we thought the movie would be a fun compromise in the meantime. We were very disappointed to find the dialogue even more glib, formulaic and smart assy than the books. But even worse, they totally sexualized the relationship between Percy and Annabeth, who in the early books at least, are friends and become hard-won allies. And the Grover character is this horny goat boy person. Not appropriate for our kid and, frankly, just bad knee-jerk storytelling going for the lowest common denominator in terms of jokes, violence and understanding of character. What sucks about this is the whole point of Greek mythology is to express the inexpressible about the human condition- a poetic and powerful ride.

The film has some super slick FX and impressive Mythology creatures ala Harryhausen (I know he didn't invent them, but he has certainly influenced the appearance of these creatures in films) and it is hard to not think of the starring trio from Harry Potter when watching the young stars of this film.

Who can resist the casting of Uma Thurman as Medusa?! Uma is a beautiful woman, but I've always thought she was a little scary looking at the same time. It all seemed like familiar territory, but I enjoyed this film much more than I thought I would. If you like Harryhausen's work or Harry Potter, than you might want to give this a shot, it's an entertaining film even if the ending is a little sappy.

spoiler. if you haven't watched the movie stop now if you care about finding out for your self.

most of the characters are wrong and the places and the actions.

some places in the book weren't in the movie and they added some that weren't in the book
some characters some what matched the ones in the book and they left out some characters that are in the book.

Entire methods and segments are worse than left out... they are changed completely.  Hermes stole Zeus's master bolt?  Heck no!  It was Ares... that entire sub plot never makes the movie and they lazily blame another God to avoid having to make that segment of the movie.  That sucks.  No wonder there was so much outcry from fans when this movie came out... and terrible casting.  The whole series of these books even establishes and reiterates hair color and eye color of characters.... no attempt to mesh with book in casting of characters.  At least dye their hair and have them wear eye color altering contact lenses.  How easy would that be?  A disappointing must watch for fans.",1392854400,,904,4.7006369426751595

Both of the Hobbit movies are vastly different than the book, but I enjoyed those movies more than these adaptations. The young actors do their best and the support cast also does a fine job. The first movie, The Lightning Thief, is more enjoyable to me than The Sea of Monsters. I found the first movie introduced the characters and seemed more cohesive. The second movie, The Sea of Monsters, was very choppy. It abbreviated too much of the story. So much so, that you lost the edginess that is so well conveyed throughout the book.

If I had to sum my estimation of both of the movies, it would center of that fact for me: the movies lose the tension to experience in the books. Perhaps, if the movies captured more of that bit of the storyline I would have enjoyed The Lightning Thief (and The Sea of Monsters) more.

So, would I say not to see this movie (or the second installation)? No, of course not. See what you think. You may be, like my son, able to let go of your expectations and enjoy them for what they are.",1390348800,5,1574,4.254180602006689

4103494,1,B003AIL24C,"This movie was nothing like the book, they changed characters' ages, personalities, looks, they changed big scenes, major aspects, they added some weird things that did not fit, and over all if you read the books, it was a huge disappointment!  I could not bring my self to watch the second movie and have the images from it burned in to my eyes! If they keep going on with the movies they will lose lots of viewers in my opinion! They turned an AMAZING book series into two (so far, and hopefully the only) horrible movies! I really hope they don't make a movie for ""Titans Curse"" (the next book) because i just know they are going to ruin Nico and Bianca!",1387843200,2,657,4.385245901639344

Grover is by far the best one in the show as Percy's guardian.  The Half Blood Camp is pretty cool.  My 7 and 10 years olds watched it then went out and got the whole series on book so they could read it before the rest are made into movies.,1387065600,,400,3.888888888888889

4103518,3,B003AIL24C,"I enjoyed this movie overall.  But I found the character of the satyr (forgot his name) to be fairly annoying.  He was supposed to be funny but wasn't actually that funny and he came across more like a token than anything else.  Otherwise very enjoyable movie, very action-packed with a good storyline.

My husband watched it too...he's Greek, and had to study mythology growing up.  He hated it...everything he complained about were things that they added in (ie: wasn't in the book) or had neglected to include from the book.  I look forward to him reading the books to our boys, because I think it's a fun modern twist on the classic mythology...but this movie adaptation is the worst movie adaptation I've ever seen!",1386115200,4,528,4.458333333333333

What I really liked about Percy Jackson is that is actually made and appropriate for kids.  The movie is sincere, respectful and not constantly winking at adults.  At the same time, it is full of adventure and humor, fun to watch.  There is a little bit of a love story, but it is low key and innocent.  My son, a Percy Jackson fan, enjoyed the movie very much and was able to understand everything that happened.  Is it perfect? No.  But it is an enjoyable movie that bears repeated watching.",1385769600,,596,4.4036697247706424

I'll only really enjoyed to Pierce for his ability to pull the joke about Chiron being a Centaur.

Some other actors were barely ok: Uma thurman, Kevin MacKidd, Sean Bean, Melina Kanakaredes,
But others were just unconvincing: Rosario Dawson, Joe Pantoliano, Steve Coogan and specially Catherine didn't look that interested in doing a good job.

They just left me with a feeling they were there just there to show up and get paid.

I don't know if it was director but I was really really disappointed because I know that every single one of these people can do their job much much better than this, even on a kid's movie.

That was the main reason I wanted to watch this movie: Having Sean Bean together with Kevin MacKidd accompanied by such a great cast (Pierce was a nice surprise) was supposed to be great.

And the Annabeth, she was nothing like the book! She's not a brunette! I always imagined the character looking like AnnaSophia Robb, not this actress. Logan Lerman was perfect, and so was Jake Abel, but everyone else? ALL WRONG. If you want to see a good movie just like it's book, watch Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone. Not this.

It does markedly vary from the book, but is really well done.  The action sequences are exciting...but not too thrilling to be enjoyed by young kids.  There were no parts of the movie where we were bored, and that's a big draw here.
Logan Lerman makes a very likable Percy, too, although Grover is our family favorite of the three main characters.

4103684,1,B003AIL24C,"I decided to watch this movie for a couple of reasons. First, the sequel is coming out so I wanted to find out what happened in this movie. Second, I wanted to try out Amazon Instant Video. Third, a dear friend said it was a good film.  Do not mind the order in which I have stated the above.

After having watched this movie, I realized it would not matter if I had watched this film in preparation for the sequel. I was rather confused how Percy Jackson took his mother's death really well. The movie does delve into Greek Mythology, but does so only slightly. I have not read the book; however, from some of the reviews I've read, I imagine the literary approach would have been more rewarding. Despite having A List Stars (not all of them, of course), their acting prowess could not saved this movie from what it has become.

I am please with Amazon Instant Video (emphasis on the ""Instant"" part). Although, I was expecting that I would be allowed to temporarily download the film; as I have chosen to 'Rent' it, soon afterwards it started streaming. It streamed quite well on my PlayStation 3 console; however, I do prefer having to download a film, as the quality is far better, even in Standard Definition (SD). As with the A list stars in the film, downloading, watching in SD or HD would not have helped this film's...that's it, this film (I was going to mention 'quality', but it seems to be devoid of it).

I am curious as to 'why' a close friend would suggest this prepubescent film. I should have trusted my instincts upon seeing the trailer, way back in 2010 - I knew it would be lacking. The only positive marks I can think of are, that there were a few moments in the film that triggered an tinge of familial emotion - only a tinge; the other 'plus' mark is that the SD Rental option is only $2.99. Thank the gods I didn't have to pay a theatre's price of admission to watch this film.

The only means with which I would suggest someone watch this film, is if they could find chapters of it on YouTube.",1376697600,6,2018,4.370666666666667
4103685,5,B003AIL24C,I have seen it at theater. I love greek mythology. I cannot wait to see Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters.,1376611200,,103,4.2
4103686,3,B003AIL24C,"I have read and enjoyed all the books of the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series. When I saw the movie trailer, I was pumped and immediately went to go see it when it came out. When I got out of theater, I was somewhat satisfied but not entirely. I don't hate this film at all. I enjoyed watching it and thought it was pretty entertaining. But that didn't stop from noticing all the flaws the movie has.

I knew from begging there were going to be a lot of things that would be taken out ore changed for the movie. After all, if it did follow the book exactly, the movie would be like 5 hours. I can definitely say the movie followed only about 40 to 50 percent of the time. Like a lot of the other reviewers have mentioned, it is a bit disappointing that a lot of the main characters and crucial plot points had been left out. I kinda forgave it since this is going to a movie series, I figured that maybe they'll reveal these characters later on in the next movies that come out in the future.

The slightly  altered personalities of the main characters kinda threw me off a bit though.  In the book Percy is described as being a somewhat awkward kid with ADHD, you don't see that as much in the movie version. I almost thought Annebeth was Clarrise (one of the character left out of the movie) when she first appears with brown hair and intentionally wounds Percy during the catch the flag scene, and the tomboy bookworm personality that she has shows up only a little in the movie. Grover is changed from  a coward into a wise cracking ""cool guy""

With it's set design, there times where the sets are done very well ( Ex. The Lotus Hotel scene, it was just as glamorous as I imagined), But other times its not that special ( Ex. Camp Half Blood, I know its a summer camp but couldn't they made it look less cluttered and small?) The action scenes were done pretty well, even if sometimes they were a bit typical.

The main problem I have with this film though is that it tries too hard to be a  moody, serious adventure film like Harry Potter.  Even with it's several comical scenes ( which were often a hit or miss), it still tries to take itself way too seriously. The original books ( thanks to Rick Riodan's great writing) maintained a very zany and silly mood throughout, at least up until around the end of book 4. The books were often filled with much sharper humor and gave a different and more modernized portrays of Greek Mythological figures. (Ex. Zeus being portrayed as an executive with a pin stripped suit and Poseidon in typical fisherman's attire) What we do see on screen a lot of times is a typical view that's been repeated in several other mythology movies. So as a result, the adventure story the film is trying to tell doesn't seem as fun or interesting to get into, because the overall mood of the story has been changed and several things have been left out. Even if you didn't have time explain them, you could SHOW them instead.

I know that no film based on a book adaption will ever follow it's source material exactly. Sometimes things will be changed for time,content ,and personal preference. But do the changes to the story work to it's advantage or it's disadvantage? But in this case it kinda works to it's disadvantage because the final  product is something doesn't really seemed as unique and special as it could have been. It almost feels like the movie is telling a story without really feeling totally interested in it. However, it's a still fun film to watch, if you ignore it's source material and accept it for what it is, it's a lot easier to enjoy. But I recommend checking out the books if you really want experience bigger and no doubt livelier adventure.",1376524800,,3710,4.417276720351391

4103688,2,B003AIL24C,"We were planning to stream this movie for my son's ""movie"" birthday party on our new HD TV, and luckily we tried it out in advance because it did not work!  The movie itself (having rented it from Redbox as a back-up) is surprisingly outstanding.  It tells the tale well with much less violence than I would have thought, and fewer ""inuendoes"" than I expected, but was surprisingly well-acted and had an excellent pace.  Anyway, when we tried streaming it as an Instant HD movie, it played for a while and then kept quitting.  I just needed to turn the TV off and then back on (while leaving the Wii U through which we were streaming it still on) and the movie would have continued while I was doing so.  But we were not interested in having this happen many times during our son's party, so we rented it instead.

4103713,2,B003AIL24C,"Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief is mediocre at best as both a film in general and also a fantasy film.  I have seen many fantasy movies at this point like The Lord of the Rings trilogy, the Narnia films, the Harry Potter films, etc.  Compared to all of those films this does not stack up well.  It is definitely not the worst fantasy movie out there.  It is not as bad as the Twilight Saga or the Golden Compass, but it is not anything special either.

First of all I did not find the characters interesting at all.  They are the stereotypical characters that you tend to find in a story like this.  Percy Jackson (Logan Lerman) himself is the typical hero and fish-out-of-water characters.  There is nothing to his character that I have not seen before and done better.  Grover (Brandon T. Jackson) is the typical black comic relief who I did not think was that funny.  The best character in the movie is definitely Annabeth (Alexandra Deddario).  She is the love interest I guess, but she is tough and can take care of herself.  She is the best of the main cast, but even her I did not find all that interesting either.  There are other decent character like Zeus (Sean Bean) Mr. Brunner (Pierce Brosnan), but they are not in the film that much.

The story is very simple and not interesting.  Someone stole Zeus's lightning bolt and they half to go find it.  Sometimes simple stories can work if the movie is entertaining, but in this case it wasn't.

Another thing that did not work for me was that they take a lot of Greek Mythology and modernize it for comedy which does not work at all, at least for me.  The comedy is not funny at all either.  There were a couple scenes that got a laugh but mostly the humor was dry.  The effects were not that good either.  They were not bad but compared to Harry Potter or Narnia, the effects are lackluster.

Overall, I would skip this one.  I heard the books are fairly good.  I f you are interested in this then read the books.  The new movie is coming out and it does not look any better looking at the trailer.",1375660800,,2080,4.354166666666667

4103718,2,B003AIL24C,"I haven't read any of the books, so my reaction to this movie (and anything I say about it) is based purely off what was on the screen.

I mention that because my immediate reaction to Percy Jackson & the Olympians - The Lightning Thief was that it desperately wanted to be Harry Potter. Everything that happened in the first 45 minutes just felt like Harry Potter with a slight twist.

It's not that the Harry Potter concept was  particularly original but this movie hits so many of the same elements in a similar order that it's really hard to put the comparison's aside. Particularly when you're dealing with the same director who did the first two Potter movies.

Unfortunately for most of those elements it's weaker than the movies it gets compared against. Yes it's an American setting and it attempts a slightly edgier tone, but that falls flat given the for kids nature of the movie.

The plot itself is blandly inoffensive, the characters and actors are fine. The special effects are adequate or better and they've managed to get a few big names in supporting roles.

But none of that leaves a lasting impression. I can't point to anything I hated, but equally I can't point to anything that really stood out.",1375401600,,1218,4.641860465116279

The entire plot line was invented; Prosephonie's pearls are such a tiny part in the book it could have been easily ignored, but that is what the plot revolved around in the movie. It could have been done closer to the book and made just as much, if not more money.
On top of all this, many major parts of this book have been ignored (spoiler alert) such as Clarrise, the fact that Luke didn't die, Ares, the scorpion venom that poisons Thalia, and much more. How are they going to make The Sea of Monsters?",1372723200,2,849,4.151515151515151

It is NOT as good as the book. There is really no question. And there are multiple differences between the book and movie. I would guess that there was some thought that perhaps the book was so detailed that the story had to be more streamlined to make the movie work in 2 hours. But in doing so, I think lots of interesting content was sacrificed. There were too many missing pieces for me. Also, some acting is not wonderful.
That said, I disagree with the reviewers who have written this movie off as terrible. If I hadn't read the books, I may have enjoyed it more. But it is entertaining, not without flaws, and my teenage son loved it. So if your kids like these stories, they may like the movie, too.
It had some pretty interesting visuals with different monsters. I'd say it is exciting, but not overly scary. I'd say it is very appropriate for ages 7 and up.
If you have been on the fence because of other reviews, I would say go ahead. It may not be your favorite movie ever, but it is entertaining and family-friendly.",1372377600,2,1156,4.307339449541284

4103770,4,B003AIL24C,"I like fantasy movies and over-the-top CG and explosions.  If you like fantasy movies and over-the-top CG and explosions, you'll like Percy Jackson & The Olympians: The Lightning Thief.

Have you read the books?  Are you looking for a faithful adaptation a la The Lord of the Rings?  Don't watch Percy Jackson & The Olympians: The Lightning Thief.  The movie starts out pretty strongly following the books, then the director (Chris Columbus, the same guy who butchered the first few Harry Potter movies) starts chopping huge chunks of rather important or interesting plotlines out.  In the books, Percy had a ""whodunnit"" mini-mystery about who his father is.  In the movie, heck, it's right there on the back cover.  Where's the fun in that?

Now, I understand that movies can't use all the plotlines from the book, but Percy Jackson & The Olympians: The Lightning Thief drops the ball pretty hard and ruins plotlines that are in subsequent books.  I want to know how the heck future directors will be able to handle some of the major characters that were just completely left out of this movie who are pretty crucial to the sequel books.  Good luck to you folks...

That being said, if you can ignore the books and just want a decent fantasy movie, Percy Jackson & The Olympians: The Lightning Thief will fit the bill.  The CG is well-done, even if it's a lot of Airbender-esque over-the-top elemental control, and the acting is superb.  I laughed my butt off when I saw Sean Bean was Zeus (hey, at least you know HE's not going to die, saving poor Sean from yet another tallymark in the ""Sean Bean Always Dies"" movie trope) and loved Pierce Brosnan as Chiron.  The witty actor playing Grover threw me for a loop, but then I just threw out my mental book-version of a pathetic, useless Grover and the comic relief was a lot better.  Uma Thurman as Medusa, however, she took the cake.  Flawless acting, perfect modern-day outfit, and just the right amount of creepy.

Definitely a good movie if you can ignore the books.  I'm looking forward to The Sea of Monsters whenever it gets released!",1370649600,2,2091,4.695054945054945

It did not follow the book at all, it changed the age of the characters (which is quite vital in this series), it changed almost all of the important and even the unimportant events that take place in the book, and it even changed some of the appearances (Annabeth is a brunette in this movie). It didn't contain too much of the innocent and wry humor of Rick Riordan that we all know and love. Sure, it contained humor, and it was in fact funny, but it didn't feel right, it almost felt forced. The action was also a bit bogus, like it was from the 1980's (no offense to those movies).

It has enough action and story to keep them entertained and the right amount of humor for any adult to enjoy. If you are like me and get tired of the Pixar/Disney fair and their heavy use of emotional tropes, then this is a good change of pace.

The story takes a modern-cum-clash-of-the-titans-approach (the classic loin cloth version) but your young hero is a kid who has ADHD and Dyslexia, part of the effects being a Demi-god. Several other characters have physical disabilities that hide their true abilities. Also Percys female companion is the best warrior of the bunch.

I was expecting a film of similar quality to Harry Potter, I wasn't satisfied with the outcome. Chris Columbus is a decent director, the first few Harry Potter movies which he directed were alright, and The Help is good, but this was a missed opportunity. Shot on a similar budget to the first Harry Potter movies, I was expecting something as visually appealing as those movies were, but the CGI in this film looks unnatural, which makes it hard to get into the movie. The dialogue is pretty bad and the characters are more like caricatures, they are very one dimensional. This is a silly film that I expect a younger audience (grade school age kids) will appreciate, but I just couldn't get into it.",1360195200,4,813,4.575342465753424

4103888,3,B003AIL24C,"this movie is a loose adaptation of the book it's based upon. when watching it i had to detach myself from much of what happened in the novel it was based upon in order to enjoy it as a film. much of the politics and the beauty of the world created by riordan in the series was lost in the transition to film and it seemed to lack the magic that went along with that world in the novel. one thing i think it did well was keep the overall personality of the characters (though they are made older in the film) intact. i do, however, think it failed as an attempted adaptation and hope that the future films in the series will improve in that regard.

once i was able to let go of how it differed from the novel i found it to be a fun adventure! good effects and impressive acting from the seasoned supporting cast and the young lead actors alike made it an enjoyable and easy watch. it was fairly fast paced and definitely amusing. my family who hadn't read the novels loved it very much on its own and some of them are even wanting to pick up the books now! if anything, you've got to thank the movie for that.

Where's Clarisse, and Ares, and Dionysus? Aren't the gods supposed to be wearing modern clothes? Annabeth is supposed to be blonde! That was the whole POINT--to make the really smart girl in the story BLONDE as a punch in the face to the dumb blonde stereotypes. Writers give their characters their features for a REASON!!! And where's that scene at the St Louis arch? That was one of my favourite scenes! And where's Annabeth's love of architecture? And there is NO romance between her and Percy in the FIRST BOOK!! And since when is she the warrior-girl? That's Clarisse! Who is a MAJOR character in the sequel, which I can't believe the people--not to mention the laws of the Universe and all that is good--are letting them do. Where's Kronos? The pact? The Big Three? Why is Persephone in the Underworld if it's SUMMER?! And don't even get me STARTED on the ages!!! Logan is older than Percy is NOW!!! In the movie he's, like, 17, but at the current moment (end of Mark of Athena) Percy is (to be precise) 16 years, 10 months, 1 week and 6 days old!!!! And that's not even ALL of it!!!! I know it's impossible and kinda boring for the movie to be EXACTLY like the book, but leaving out crucial parts, minor yet essential details that shape the story, and completely altering the plot line? I just HATE it when movie directors do that. The movie would've been WAY more successful if it actually FOLLOWED THE STORY!!!!
THEY RUINED MY FAVOURITE SERIES OF ALL TIME!!!!! THEY DESERVE TO BE IN THE FIELDS OF PUNISHMENT FOR THEIR SINS!!!!!

  Well, Chris, are you happy? You managed to make hundreds of fans cry because you didn't stay faithful to the book. What surprises me about this is that so many people have given this a negative review because of its unfaithfulness. And, admittedly, I was very mad when I walked out of the theater. However, I managed to find some positive things in this movie:
  Logan Lerman as Percy Jackson: So many fangirls' hearts melted at the sight of this guy. Being another guy myself, my heart didn't. However, much like how Brandon Routh looked like Christopher Reeve as Superman, Logan Lerman looks remarkably like Percy(in my opinion). His only problem is that his eyes are blue while Percy is described as having green eyes. His personality? Ok. Percy is a very sarcastic character who actually takes it really well that Greek mythology is real. In the movie, Logan portrays him as being scared out of his mind, which could be argued as being realistic. But this is a book series with ghosts, hydras, and ancient gods. How realistic can you get?
  And that's all I can say about the characters that's positive. The acting is solid for the portrayal the actors were going for. Alexandria Daddario as Annabeth? Meh. Annabeth's spunky, intelligent, by the book personality that she has in the first book(it changes as the series goes on) is completely missing in Alex's portrayal. She instead acts like a flirty, typical teenager who happens to be good at sword fighting. Where's the intellectual prowess? The cunning portrayal? The battle strategies? The bickering between her and Percy? She just isn't there.

Did Percy meet the same results as Harry? No. Everything changed so much I am now re-reading the first book just to make sure it wasn't that horrible. The memorable scenes, laughs, and coolness from the book are gone, leaving the movie to feel like an enhanced Dora the Explorer episode. Percy uses the map on his quest and gos to 3 different locations complete with 1 obstacle to overcome. I understand some elements have to be left out because of run time, but the company was able to cram almost every event of Harry Potter in a reasonable length, so I understand how they missed almost the entire story of Percy Jackson.  To top off bad plotline, the CGI is awful. The monsters aren't scary, they look fake and unnatural. The battles look faker then fake. The cast is horrible as well. I never pictured Grover as tall and muscular, I always thought that he was rather puny. In fact, almost everybody is muscular. Did the people who made the movie even read the book? I could complain more, but I think the movie is really summed up. Read the book, avoid the movie. I will not be watching the sequel, either.",1351814400,,1280,4.47008547008547

4103947,2,B003AIL24C,"My son and I have both read the entire Percy Jackson series, plus the Kane Chronicles and the Heroes of Olympus (that last series to date; we are at yet another cliff-hanger in the series at the moment); thus, I had high hopes when I found this DVD at the library. We were both filled with shock at the liberties that the movie was taking with the book, and we were taking turns in pointing out things that were wrong, wrong, wrong. Still quite early in the movie, I made a rule: we were to forget about the book and just sit back and try to enjoy the movie as just a movie. We then took it in turns to call out ""forget the book"" when the other one of us couldn't contain ourselves any more.

So as a film of the book, this movie was a disaster. But was it a good movie in its own right? If so, maybe that could excuse the terrible adaptation of the book. I had to sit back and give myself time to think about this. Forget the book, forget the book, forget the book.... Nah! It was a pretty bad movie independent of the poor adaptation issue. It also required some background knowledge from the book to know what on earth was going on.

What was the point of making the movie? Who is it for? It is not for fans of the book because any fan of the book is going to come away from this movie frothing at the mouth. The movie is so poor that if you are not a fan of the book, you wouldn't want to waste you time on it. The only reason that I am giving this two stars rather than one star is that I saw an adaptation of ""A Wrinkle in Time"" the same week as this, and - trust me - that would have been negative stars if I could make it happen.",1349913600,,1637,3.9425981873111784

4103954,5,B003AIL24C,"Percy Jackson (Logan Lerman, ""Gamer"") doesn't have a great life it seems, he has some friends at school but gets picked on by others, his mother is his rock but is together with a massive drunk who does nothing (Joe Pantoliano, ""Daredevil""). Soon this changes though as Percy is found out to be the son of the god Poseidon (Kevin McKidd, ""Brave"") and gets taken to a camp for children of the gods so they can be trained on how to use their powers in the best way to defend themselves. The rest of the movie has Percy not willing at first to accept his fate, but soon after making a couple of friends at the camp they decide to go retrieve the thunderbolt of Zeus before a war between the gods and Earth occurs.

Given the PG rating its actually a well done flick, doesn't focus on a ton of the bad for too long (don't want to scar the younger viewers of course) and keeps the pace up through the action sequences especially the final few, with the last one being a grand display of special effects. The story is fairly simple, though the cast has some good actors in it including, Catherine Keener (""Capote""), Pierce Brosnan (""Goldeneye""), Uma Thurman (""Kill Bill""), Sean Bean (""Silent Hill"") and Rosario Dawson (""Alexander"") among others. Also nice how young up and coming performers besides Logan, there's Brandon T. Jackson (""Tropic Thunder"") and Alexandra Daddario (""Bereavement"") who has some of the most beautiful blue eyes I've seen in a long time.

I thoroughly enjoyed this flick, it was just fun from start to finish and even though it was totally predictable at least it was enjoyable. ***1/2 out of 4 stars",1346457600,,1618,4.595155709342561
4103955,3,B003AIL24C,"I find this movie to be a lot more humorous than entertaining. Brand T. Jackson, who played as Grover kept the movie entertaining. I have to say, if he was not in the movie, then this movie would become a lot more entertaining or even worst not even as 'cool"" as it is right now. The movie itself is okay, it had a great plot, but then again I expected more at the end and also at the beginning. Not to mention, I noticed that the beginning did not make sense because why couldn't the gods just meet up in Olympus versus in New York City at the top of the Empire State Building?

To make this even more humorous, the underworld (hell) is located in Hollywood! Hmm, what message does that give that give to audience? Obviously someone is trying to put down Hollywood. Otherwise, its an okay movie to watch, you will be laughing a lot versus being oooed and aahhhed.

Not to mention, I'm surprised Uma Thurman was Medusa in this movie. Where you guys surprise too? I guess because she had the perfect figure and I wonder, if she does comes back as Medusa as a stand alone movie, it will be exciting and entertaining and something that I would look forward to watch. Not mention, I got lost of where that lady came from when she took Annebeth (Athena's daughter)...",1344643200,,1262,4.365957446808511
4103956,1,B003AIL24C,"I didn't buy it here; though I think it is cheaper to get it on Amazon.
I wanted to give feedback about the movie; don't read if you don't want spoilers.

Introduction: I loved the animation and lightening effects, there was no defects there. However, once they introduced ""Zeus"" and ""Poseidon""... I didn't want to watch the rest of the movie. Especially when they show the Empire State building. First of all, the movie was supposed to start off from Percy's point of view and reveal later when he goes to Camp Half Blood about the war that was going to erupt.

Zeus: FAILURE! He didn't hold any real authority in his appearance. He's also not supposed to be a chunky overweight middle aged man. He's supposed to have had a storm cloud beard and hair. His outfit is supposed to be in professional stuck-up pin stripped suits.

Poseidon: FAILURE! He was supposed to have BLACK HAIR like Percy. He was also supposed to have a more strong appearance. I believe the actor who played him really killed his character. He was also supposed to have sun wrinkles around his eyes that show he smiles alot...

Both Percy and his father are supposed to have the same black hair and green eyes. I think the actor who played Percy has blue eyes? Which on a technical level messes up the physical details of the characters.

Percy Jackson: I believe that they picked the perfect boy actor for Percy. Although it seemed that he was ""stiff"" in many emotional aspects of his character. He didn't present any ""fun loving"" get-at-it attitude like Percy in the books. It was like he was detached the entire time.

Grover: 100% FAILURE! The major issues was with his personality and is ""gun-how"" attitude. In Book 1, Chapter 1, page [3]: --""Grover was an easy target. He was scrawny. He cried when he got frustrated. He must've been held back several grades, because he was the only sixth grader with acne and a start of a wispy beard on his chin."" In the movie, his character is headstrong and wants to GOGOGOGOGOGO. It completely destroys Grover's character development in the book series. :/

Mr. Brunner: SUCCESS! He had the tweed jacket, the wheelchair, the hair, the beard and the right welcoming warm face. They picked the perfect middle aged male actor to play as Mr. Brunner (Chiron in disguise). I believe he was the only one that actually got to stay true to his character. (Probably because he was more years of experience in acting, anyway)

School field trip: 40% Success. 60% Failure. The museum was a success, its interior, everything. However, the field trip did not start right off there. They were supposed to be driving in a school buss where Nancy Bobofit (who had been slashed from the movie), was picking on Grover. Percy in turn, tries to defend his best friend Grover from being hit with wads of sandwich that stuck in his curly brown hair. It really hurts Percy's character for not adding this scene in because before he explains all the strange occurrences that happened in his life that labeled him a ""failure student"" and a ""troubled kid.""

Mrs. Dodds: Too quick to reveal her true form as a ""Fury."" She was supposed to be wearing a leather jacket. Her physical appearance was alright but I didn't get the feeling of ""Georgian"" as the book describes her to be. Slashing her background and involvement with Percy also kind of hurt in certain areas.

Getting caught by Mrs. Dodds: 100% FAILURE! There were no ""ear buds"" or apple ipod being played in the book. Percy gets called out by Mr. Brunner when Nancy Bobofit couldn't shut up about a naked guy on a stele, where he turned around and said ""Will you shut up?"" in a loud voice. That's when Mr. Brunner asks him if he had anything to say about the exhibit and about why Kronos ate his children. Mrs. Dodds did not call out Percy then! After they had left the museum to get lunch and when Nancy picks on Grover got on Percy's last straw and sent her flying into a water fountain is when she called it out. The disappearing act up the stairs was botched by her slight disappearing act into the room (which is right for the most part), where he's supposed to kill her.

Fury (Mrs. Dodds): I think for the most part, her demon appearance was an success? BUT! She was not supposed to GET AWAY. Percy ends up slashing her with riptide and disintegrates into a spin-wheel of dust. Having Grover there alongside Mr. Brunner destroyed this scene. Grover never goes inside with the latin teacher, he remains outside where Nancy Bobofit gloats about a ""Mrs. Kurr"" (a different teacher that the ""Mist"" created) giving him a butt whooping, so-to-speak.

Going Home: 100% FAILURE! They totally cut off the biggest part of the book where Grover and Mr. Brunner talk behind Percy's back about the summer solstice deadline. Especially when they ride on the travel bus on the way home for summer break. The most important part is when the bus breaks down in front of the three fates sitting at a (gas station? fruit stand?) and cuts the life cord of someone. I believe by leaving this out, really throws off the plot to the whole series about whose destined to die. . _ .

Sally Jackson: SUCCESS! They found the perfect actress to play Percy's mother. They got her physical appearance down to a ""T."" However, she could've been more headstrong in certain areas. Specially, where she's supposed to gather her wits like she does in the book and protect her loved ones.

Gabe (Not so smelly?): His actor ALMOST got it right. He was supposed to be more ""walrus"" shaped. Cutting his poker game which was supposed to happen when Percy walks in after ditching Grover at a public restroom area destroys his character personality. Beer bottles, cigars and smoke was supposed to be evident. Also, the part where Gabe sniffs out the money left over in Percy's pocket and threatens him to hand it over. Slashing the mess and disgust that Gabe presents to Percy upon returning home also affects this scene. How are you supposed to get the interpretation of ""Smelly,"" when you cut out major parts of character developments?

The apartment scene overall: Percy's mother's not supposed to be in the apartment when he first comes home. Gabe is the only one he meets with his poker buddies. Then, he was supposed to enter his trashed bedroom that was filled with muddy boots, empty beer bottles and whatever else was mentioned in the book that Gabe thought of stuffing in there to spite Percy. Grover is also not supposed to be there, popping in on the apartment. Percy doesn't run into Grover until the vacation down on the beach where Percy and his mother borrow Gabe's car with a lot of fuss. And THAT'S WHEN the dream about an Eagle and Horse were fighting each other (Zeus and Poseidon).

Racing to Camp half blood: When Percy gets agitated and concerned asking Grover about what he was, Grover was supposed to ""Blaah-ha-ha!"" And the interaction was completely wrong. Percy asked (In Chapter 4, page [44]; at the bottom of the page)--""Um... what are you, exactly?"" Grover said: ""It doesn't matter right now."" Then Percy replied: ""It doesn't matter? From the waist down, my best friend is a donkey--"", which is were Grover let out a sharp, throaty ""Blaa-ha-ha!"" and cried ""Goat!"" And Percy goes: ""What?"" And Grover replies: ""I'm a Goat from the waist down."" and Percy answers: ""You just said it didn't matter.""---Cutting this whole scene really destroyed it. That and Grover was NOT awake or physically conscious when running to C.H.B.. Grover was knocked out because of the Minotaur flipped Gabes car into a ditch. Percy and his mother were the ones dragging his goaty butt towards camp.

Fighting the Minotaur: 100% FAILURE! Percy doesn't have the sword with him! He gave it back to Chiron at the school trip. Grover is not supposed to be there egging him on to defeat the thing either. GROVER IS SUPPOSED TO BE KNOCKED OUT, like he always does. There was also no door-way or arch-way leading into Camp Half Blood.

Camp Half Blood: 100% FAILURE! First of all, they slashed Thalia's tree from the WHOLE story. That destroys her character appearance, history and development. Second of all, I'll just say that the Cabins were wrong. It looked like it all came out of Per 1. It was RIDICULOUS! - . - They also disregarded the campfire and the sacrificial food scraps to the gods. :/ Argus the 100 eye'd security guard was also cut out, as well as Dionysus. And where was Clarisse? She's supposed to be the key player in picking on Percy and revealing he is the son of Poseidon during the capture the flag night. Which, of course, was also slashed horribly. Annabeth and Percy were supposed to be on the same side during capture the flag. Not just Luke and Percy! The whole water-healing scene was good but everything else was choppy. Third of all, there are no Oracles?! The corpse hippie has also been slashed--so, the quest isn't given right. Nor does anyone hear of any prophecies... What was the whole point of making a movie if you aren't going to keep true to the key parts of the series?

Annabeth: FAILURE! Supposed to be blonde haired, gray-eyed and have a California appearance.

Luke: 80% FAILURE! 20% SUCCESS is for keeping true to his sandy blonde hair (I can't remember if his eyes were right--but they're supposed to be blue). They revealed that Luke was playing video games. I mean, c'mon. The ""techno"" stuff wasn't in any of the series besides cellphones and even then, they only thing really used was laptops because it sent up Monster flares telling them where they were. Luke was also supposed to have a long white dragon scar on one of his eyes from going on that quest from his father Hermes to get he ""forbidden fruit"" and got injured from Landon.

Chiron (Mr. Brunner): 50% FAILURE! In centaur form, Chiron is supposed to be a WHITE STALLION--NOT BROWN!
 Although his character is played beautifully, his outer appearance really slashed it.

The Quest: 100% FAILURE! The quest to the underworld and meeting the major monster characters were completely wrong. There was nothing about ""marble this"" ""marble that"". Percy only receives three white milky marbles from his father back in Santa Monica Bay from a water lady. Medusa was also supposed to be a middle eastern woman and never reveals who she is. There's also NO humans around when Percy, Annabeth and Grover end up there during their quest. It made me sad they cut out the scene where Percy had to say hello to the Pink Poodle. :( Hades appearance was ALSO HORRIBLY WRONG! He looked like Jaguar... And his wife was not supposed to be there either. Nor was Percy traveling with a metal shield given to him from Luke. The only thing Luke gave Percy as he was going on his quest was those winged shoes, which was also misused. The winged shoes brought Percy in Zeus's domain and if he ever dared to fly with them, he'd be shot down like a pigeon. He gave the shoes to Grover. ARES was supposed to play the biggest key part in the quest since he was the God who was ""turned"" being brain washed from Kronos. The lightening bolt is supposed to appear in the blue backpack Ares gives to Percy after they fetch his war shield back to him from the abandoned Water-land exhibit. (And so on)

I'll cut it short here. Basically, the producer slashed the entire series. It wasn't really worth it to buy the movie. Previously there was a movie trailer where they showed a girl named Clarisse wearing camouflage who had been doused in toilet water because of Percy. I don't know why they scrapped it? And I'm not sure if anyone else saw it but I did, on YOUTUBE.

The major key players that had been taken out of the movie really affected the development. The look and feel of Mount Olympus was cheap and completely ruined what I had envisioned from Rick Riordan... I believe they would have done a better job if they weren't so ""gun-how"" to earn more money. :/ If they want to continue this movie series, they need to RE-START from scratch and go by the book. Otherwise... I will only stick to the books and that's about it.",1344124800,2,12016,4.619493908153702
4103957,3,B003AIL24C,"What a surprise. Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief was not as bad as I thought it would be. Of course the big comparison has been made a thousand times, and while it's certainly no Harry Potter, I don't think it doesn't matters in the slightest. The first two harry Potter films happen to share the same director, Chris Columbus. I have to admit that this movie was surprisingly entertaining. The effects were top notch, and the actors weren't so bad either. Sure, there were a few spots where dialogue was a little shoddy, which would make any actor look bad delivering it, but overall, I thought they were good. As Brandon T. Jackson's performance was probably my favorite, because he was so tongue-in-cheek that it's impossible to take his character seriously. That sounds bad, but I mean it in a good way. It's nice to see him in another worthwhile role (in my opinion anyway), after his last substantial role being in one of my all-time favorite comedies, Tropic Thunder. He made me laugh a couple times, like near the beginning when Percy (played by Logan Lerman) frantically asked him if he was half donkey, then he replied, ""I'm half goat."" It's hard to explain, but his expression just worked perfectly for me. Speaking of our lead, Logan Lerman, he was actually pretty good as well. He's probably best known for his role in 3:10 To Yuma, and that's still his best. Not to take anything away from his performance here.

I hate to say this, but I'm surprised to see Uma Thurman as Medusa in this movie. Not because I think that she's too good for the part, but because her screentime was very short. It was just long enough to not be a cameo, but too short to say she's a star. Even so, she played a pretty essential part throughout the rest of the story, including a mid-credits stinger. I was also surprised to see Pierce Brosnan, Rosario Dawson and Steve Coogan, all of which are actors that I enjoy watching. They all seemed to have fun with their roles, and in a film like this, that helps a lot. If the actors take their roles too seriously, it'll come off as hokey, or corny. When you can tell that the cast obviously had fun making the film, then it allows you to lighten up and have fun watching them ""work"". Not sure if the following is really a spoiler, but in case it is, you've been warned. Pierce Brosnan plays a minotaur who is seemingly the only instructor in a camp for the young demigods. I thought that was kind of odd, considering there was a lot of students in that camp, but it wasn't too distracting. Steve Coogan played Hades, and he played him with a rockeresque persona. In his actual ""Hades form"", he's quite menacing, but as himself, not so much. I should say though, it did fit, oddly enough. Rosario Dawson played Persephone, the daughter of Zeus (Sean Bean), who was abducted by Hades, and is now the queen of the Underworld. I rather enjoyed their love-hate relationship (mostly hate).

Overall, I thought the action was well choreographed, and accompanied by some gorgeous CGI, and some questionable CGI. Of course it's not perfect, or completely convincing, but it's still looks pretty good nonetheless. But in all honesty, how likely is it that even the best looking centaur or dragon would convince the audience? We know these are mythical creatures, so their believability is shot from the start. As for the action itself, the best in the film came when the three main characters, Percy, Grover and Annabeth, were fighting hand-to-hand. Yeah, the budget-focused CGI battles were good, but I'm a stickler for hand-to-hand combat. I thought it was a little brutal for a PG film, and I liked that. The transfer was truly amazing as well. I honestly cannot complain too much about it. There were a number of nighttime scenes, and usually those scenes lose detail and become a bit murky, but that wasn't the case here. I was always able to clearly decipher everything in dark shots. The audio was damn good too. It's still pretty much reference quality. I would definitely recommend this movie to kids (all ages) who aren't too ""cool"", in the South Park and FPS age, to enjoy cheesy fantasy films. For older adults, maybe not so much. I am actually looking to a sequel. There are lots movies that don't deserve them, but sequels get made anyway. Percy Jackson and the Olympians is one that does deserve it.

I read all Percy Jackson books and I like them, but I definitely like the movie too. When I first watched the movie, I thought man, they skipped/changed some things but I've got to tell you - you get past that and just enjoy the ride.",1339718400,5,585,4.086956521739131

4103962,1,B003AIL24C,"It's been a while since I've seen this movie (watched in theaters), but I recall that the movie was Hollywood's overhaul of an otherwise great series of books.  The books were subtle, mischievous, and fun while the movie was an explosion-laden, shallow delivery of instant gratification which killed any hope for a sequel.  Key points that I recall that were serious and almost unforgivable transgressions against the books:

 **Spoiler Alert**

1) Poseidon appearing as an old sailor - from my memory he always appeared as the stereotypical surfer/beachcomber.
2) The reason for the hydra fight in the museum - the hydra was fought in the swamps of Florida and for an entirely different reason.
3) Huge plot gaps with missing involvement of Aries, Aphrodite and other figures in Greek mythology
4) The antagonist and the use was utterly wrong and held little to no connection to anything happening in the book.  There was never any indication of who the TRUE antagonist was and the threat ended with the final fight.
5) The love interest was developed too quickly and the tension that was existent throughout the series was cast aside.

This series of books could've been turned into a wonderful trilogy of movies (it absolutely had the potential), but all of that was squandered by some Hollywood blow-hard ripping all that was good from the story.  This was the first time I've ever walked away from a movie angry, but this was clearly someone trying to cash in on a title and nothing more.",1337644800,,1493,4.850393700787402

THE BOOK!!!!!!!

The movie is SO STUPID!!! The resemblances? It has a kid named Percy...maybe some more... Why can't they make sea of Monsters? Here's why:

1. They don't show you Clairese
2. I don't think you can poisen a stupid gate...It is supossed to be a TREE!
3. I only watched it ONCE...and I'm pretty sure Percy destroys Luke...
4. Percy is in High-School...that defeats the whole ""At the age of Sixteen"" part of the Prophecy!

Also, there is no fight with Ares...I think we are missing something here! Not to mention Percy brings a phone to Aunty Em's Garden Gnome Imporium...which is stupid because having a cell-phone(or at least using it)is moreless saying ""Hey Monsters! Come And Get Me!"" Oh, and another thing, they don't even show Kronos! WHAT THE HECK!

They really dumbed down the Greek Mythology and changed the entire story to appease people that wouldn't have been willing to follow the original plot.  Grover's character had a completely different personality and his cheesy little one-liners could have been stolen from your typical Disney or Dreamworks movie about talking animals from a variety of ethnic backgrounds.  I think the books have enough of a following that this movie would have made plenty of money without selling out this way but whoever made it did not have enough faith in the Percy Jackson fans.  And why are they in high school??  He was supposed to be 12.  They thought having good looking teen actors would be better than young kids.  I guess they weren't worried about what age he would be in the sequels, if they even bother to make them after this atrocity.  Maybe they were trying to make it more ""hip"" than Harry Potter, but I've got news for them: If they had just told the story as it was and had younger kids grow up in these roles it absolutely would have been better than Harry Potter.  No contest.  But instead they RUINED it.  I should have known it would suck when it was bargain priced on Zune.  I won't give up on the series though, because the books are so awesome.

Not as action-packed as say, Clash of the Titans...but it also doesn't take itself quite as seriously. The Blu-Ray version looks and sounds phenomenal, and the Digital Copy bonus never hurts.

ALL THE MAJOR POINTS have been tossed aside. & I'm talking about this is the bases of the story line of the actual books and they completely ignored it for the movie. Believe me there's no way they can make a movie for the 2nd book because they cut out everything for the sequel to even make sense unless of course they destroy that movie too and just make up stuff as they go like with The Lighting Thief.

4103976,5,B003AIL24C,"I was not lucky enough to have read the Percy Jackson and The Olympians series prior to the release of this movie (I didn't even know the series existed until this movie.) Anyway, I saw the movie in Blockbuster and thought the cover looked interesting so I rented it and I ended up loving the movie. I love this movie so much that I bought the 3 disk blu-ray version of it so I could watch it home, at my parents house and on my iPod at the gym.

Naturally, I couldn't understand why people hated this movie so I read the books. After reading The Lightening Thief I realized the movie was completely different from the book. It's almost as if Chris Columbus loosely based the movie on the book rather than direct the movie based on the book (a slap in author Rick Riordan's face.)

Regardless of how much ""artistic license"" he used I thought the new story line was fantastic. Even after reading the series in its' entirety I still watch the movie all the time. Would I prefer Riordan's story line to Columbus'? Yes. Since a remake is out of the question I've chosen not to boycott this movie or the next and just enjoy them for what they are.

As for Annabeth, though she does not have gray eyes and curly blonde hair, I thought Alexandra Daddario was perfect for the role of Annabeth. Daddario is a good actress that got a lot of ""heat"" for not having the physical attributes of Riordan's Annabeth.

Since I don't want her reading my books (Stephen King and such) I started reading hers. This series of books is a great tribute to the old Greek myths, of which I have read the originals. The character development by Rick Riordan is comparable to some of the best authors out there today. I knew when I bought the movie adaptation to his first book that it would not be anywhere near as good as the written word. And I was not disappointed in the least. Pierce Brosnan was ok as Chiron and I could accept that they needed to make Percy and Annabeth older to accomplish some of the story action, but the movie story was horrible. The characters were poorly portrayed and not at all like the book. Characters were left out while others were introduced that were not in the book such as Persephone. The casting director should be shot for that one alone. If you want to see a horrible adaptation of Greek mythology, get the remake of Clash of the Titans and this one. Movies these days stink because they all want to be blockbuster action hits instead of telling a story anymore and they can't make anything original. I pray they NEVER make another of Mr Riordan's books into a movie, they'll just ruin it like they did with this one. Save your money and read the series, but if you must see a good Greek mythology movie, feel free to pick up the original Clash of the Titans or even one of the cheesy Sinbad movies from the 70's.",1328313600,,1564,4.341296928327645
4103978,3,B003AIL24C,"Honestly, if you've read the Percy books and you loved them, this movie will irritate you. With all the changes they made to the story, I'm surprised Riordan let them use the book's actual title. I would say this movie was loosely based on the book, not the book made into a movie. This movie is done nothing like the Harry Potter or Twilight or Lord of the Rings movies. This movie took the basic idea that Percy Jackson is the son of Poseidon and a lightning bolt was stolen from Zeus, and ran with it. Some things made you think Columbus actually read the books, but for the most part I think he must have been skimming, because there are some GLARING changes that I don't really see the purpose of.

That said, the cast was great. (Although, I had a LOT of trouble accepting Annabeth's casting. That actress would have made an AMAZING Clarisse. Or even Thalia. Why they picked her for Annabeth, when there are TONS of blonde actresses they could have chosen, makes no sense. I also take offense to the fact that they continued to uphold the ""only brunette chicks can kick ass, blondes are for ditzy romantic comedies"" stereotype. Annabeth should be blonde. Period.) There is some awesome talent in this movie and I really hope they continue to make the series. Preferably with a different director.

In truth, it probably wasn't anything like the readers were expecting but if this movie was originated as just a movie and not a book first; I'm sure it would've been a hit to everyone. As far as the ""somewhat sexually oriented scenes""; this is America and sex sells, whether it's appreciated or not.  All in all I liked this movie and I look forward to watching it again and again until I grow tired of it.  Also, for those who wish to compare this movie to Harry Potter because of its influences; you all are lunatics.  Harry Potter is a scenic empire with many movies in its collection.

 Percy Jackson returns in this astonishing book full of adventures and exhilaration. In the beginning of this amazing story, Percy finds himself getting forced out of boarding school once again. As you begin to flip through the pages you start to discover that leaving school is the least of his worries. In one of the first encounters with Percy and the mythological creatures, he finds that the monsters are much closer to him and his protectors, than anyone could ever predict. He soon realized that some of the monsters were aiming to hurt him, when his own teacher, Mrs. Dodds turned into a grotesque monster. She grew talons and black feathers in the blink of an eye as she turned into one of the only three remaining furies in the underworld. Until that day Percy had never heard or seen anything close to what this was...this was the beginning of the story that changed his life forever. Percy soon realized that his close friend Grover has always been a satyr. For Percy noticed that Grover was always the person who stayed in the background, until that day. For that day Grover took charge over Percy, for that was his lifelong task. Grover soon told Percy that he was endangered, because he was a demi-god. At first it was hard to believe for him, but after seeing what happened to Ms. Dodds, it suddenly became easier. Once Percy noticed the truth, Grover told him that he was endangered, because Zeus's lightning bolt was stolen. The most precious item ever to be a part of the universe had been stolen. Percy didn't understand why he was endangering at first, because he didn't take the lightning bolt. However Grover soon told Percy that he was a prime suspect. For Percy was the son of Poseidon and Poseidon was the brother of Zeus, and for many years Zeus and Poseidon had been in a huge feud. Zeus thinks this is a way for pay back. So now Percy has just ten days to find the thief and return the bolt before the ten days are up and the beginning of the war that would end the world starts. In order to complete this quest, Percy and his friends must face the oracle and unravel its mind-altering riddles; he must also face the father that walked out on him! If he is successful in this quest he will have unraveled a betrayal more powerful than the Gods of Mount Olympus themselves! Want to find out if he does? If he comes to terms with his father? Or if the riddle is solved? Well...Read more into this mind blowing book.",1322697600,,2480,4.511111111111111
4103990,5,B003AIL24C,">>> This is a review of the BD+DVD+Digital Copy >>>

Just so we know up front, I had no knowledge of the books until long after I first saw the movie. And I must say, despite a few off-beats from acting, it can fall into the epic. The plot is hashed down as it has been since times immemorial - middle-class nobody discovers powers beyond their reason. Then he gets a magic sword. Sound like Star Wars, Episode IV? That's where the similarities end. Period.

Percy Jackson is a demigod, the only son of Poseidon.  This is the brilliance of the movie before it even gets to the good stuff - we aren't treated to yet another in the long lines of Zeus's bastard sons. Here's a great look at what can happen when folk start to think for themselves. My understanding is that in the books, he is younger enough to make inferences to Harry Potter. And thank the cast and crew for not letting the film fall that way.

The MacGuffin is nothing less then the Thunderbolt of Zeus. A short but brilliant scene between Poseidon and Zeus (portrayed by Sean Bean, and with an intensity that makes short work of Liam Neesen's own portrayal of the Greek God Zeus. Sorry, Liam). that show there is no doubt that Sean Bean's Zeus WILL kick your butt backwards if you so much as look at him wrong. The other performances range from awesome (Poseidon - epic Kevin McKidd from Grey's Anatomy, the satyr, Medusa, and best of all Persephone - a delicious and enchanting Rosario Dawson) to slightly forced (Chiron the centaur, Annabelle Chase, Percy's mom). Not that they perform poorly at all; they just fall slightly behind the power-houses previously mentioned (i.e Rosario Dawson).

And the highest praise to be Logan Lerman. This is a role that could easily become a poor Harry Potter or Sorcerer's Apprentice, but he steps up to plate for an incredible performance. When he comes into his deific powers, you can see the change in his demeanor, slowly at first. By the end, we believe he can kick butt without Olympian intervention.

The special features of this film includes standards like featurettes and deleted scenes. Also included is little interactive ""What Are Your Powers"" quiz, a bit forced itself, but the kiddos' love it.

Thankfully, Olympus deems this film worthy of a sequel. Now, if you'll excuse me so I can go read a book....",1321574400,,2324,4.62621359223301

4103992,3,B003AIL24C,"After reading the books the movie was a bit of a letdown. Most of the stuff that happened in the movie did not even happen in the book, or happened in the 2nd. NOT the first. 2nd of all, they used older characters. Instead of Percy Jackson being portrayed as 12-13, he was 16. The age where he is supposed to end up dying or living according to one of the prophecies. So now, they are either going to have to start from scratch and come out with another first movie, or they will just have to improvise. (They will most likely choose the second) Also, Annabeth's eyes were GREY. And I think Percy's were green... Not that that matters, but when your basing a movie off of a book, it is probably best to go by the book.
Although, if you have not read the books then you would like this movie. Percy Jackson & The Olympians was a good movie by itself, but basing it off of the book, it was a rip-off.",1319587200,,898,4.137142857142857

If you are a Percy Jackson book freak, I suggest that you should buy this movie.. NOW!! Be aware of story mistakes including:
1. Annabeth NOT having blonde hair and grey eyes
2. No pact with the big three
3. They are 16!
4. No capture the flag
5. No being ""claimed"" by their parent, Percy somehow knew who his father was

4103996,3,B003AIL24C,"I've read the book and now I've watched the movie.  As you can tell from the other reviews, the movie is ""based"" on the book and thats about it.  I would love to find out why the changes were necessary, it wasn't as if the book was very long and needed to be trimmed. And the book didn't really have any twists and turns that couldn't have been translated into a move- who knows.  Truthfully- in my opinion, I don't think there was really a need to make the book into a movie. I enjoyed the books well enough, but I felt that certain parts of the book were silly.

The movie standing on its own...I'd give it 5 stars for special effects and cinematography - Olympus and Hades were visually gorgeous!  But I would give it only about 2 stars for acting and storyline.  If you're going to expose an audience to Greek mythology- get it right!  Hades wasn't Hell - it was the underworld. Death - the good and the bad.  That part in the movie annoyed me.  Also- Ares played such a big part in the book, that in the movie, it seemed that they were going out of their way to not mention him. In a movie about a great war, why wasn't the god of war in the movie. So silly.

The only piece of story line I felt made sense, was looking for the pearls.  In the book, all of the ""monsters"" they ran into throughout their quest felt silly to me.

Otherwise the movie story was so weak. The actual villain in the movie was ridiculous. Seriously - why couldn't they have used the real villain??? Kronos is much more interesting and terrifying than a boy.  Disappointed.",1316390400,,1553,4.241496598639456

Whether you have read the books or not, it's worth seeing at least once just to enjoy the special effects sequences (even if most have nothing whatsoever to do with the plot or the story).  My favorites were:  Poseidon walking out of the sea, the entire Medusa sequence, and the commercial gimmick of Percy calling out the waves to help him fight--cliche or not, it looks pretty neat.  :)  I also really liked the portrayal of Grover; he was the one character who imho was believable even if he was completely different from what I expected from the book.  Kudos to the actor on that one; I could watch the screen and absolutely believe he was a satyr.

The bad--everything else.  Try to ignore the idiotic dialogue, the nonsensical plot, and the complete absence of coherent story line--you'll only be disappointed.

4104005,3,B003AIL24C,"Percy Jackson and the Olympians(released Feb/10) brings back the Greek God motif to the big screen and in the process reminds this reviewer of how much I miss the magic of Ray Harryhausens work. Ray's movies included many of the monsters/characters seen here like the Medusa,The Hydra,Poseidan and many others. However here in 2010 its all CGI and I must say I was impressed with the work done. However the weak plot is what brings this film down and no matter the amount of S/FX,they can't make it rise above itself.
The plot finds The Greek God Zeus meeting with the God Poseidan atop the Empire State Building. Old Zeus is in an uproar because his infamous lightning bolt has gone missing and he is accusing Poseidans son Percy Jackson of stealing it. Zeus gives Poseidan a short time to retrieve it or there will be war.
Percy is just your average high school student,kind of shy and withdrawn. His main friend is on crutches and he has no idea who or what he really is. On a class excursion to a museum his teacher gets him alone,turns into a harpe like creature and wants the lightning. He is scared stiff and has no idea what it wants or why and it flees after his friend reveals himself to be his protector. He runs home to Mom and together all three head for a camp for half bloods(half humans ,half Gods that no mortals can enter).On the way his mother is seemingly killed by a rather large Centaur,who in turn is killed by Percy. In the camp the truth comes out and Percy now knows that he is the half son of the God Poseidan,with all the powers that come with a demi God. His friend is actually a Satyr,half man and half goat. He also becomes friends with the daughter of the Goddess Athena and the son of Hermes. During training at the camp Hades appears and demands the lightning from Percy and in return promises to give him his mother back.
Percy goes into action and on a quest to retrieve his mother,with his friends in tow. The son of Mercury gives Percy a map which reveals the location of three pearls which must be obtained in order to reach the underworld. Along the way they meet up with Medussa,a hydra and the lotus eaters who drug Percy and his friends into staying five days at one location,thereby losing precious time.
In the underworld,after a ride over the river Styx with Charon,it is found Percy has had the lightning tucked away neatly in a shield he was given by Hermes son. It was a setup. Hades takes the lightning and is about to do Percy and the gang in when Persephone,his wife,takes it from him and knocks Hades out. With Percy's mother now back with him only three can return and his Satyr friend volunteers to stay behind. Back on top of the Empire State Building Percy is ambushed by Hermes son whom he defeats. Down to the last few seconds Percy arrives in the nick of time with the lightning on Mount Olympus and with the details of who took the lightning. Athena's daughter meets her mother for the first time and Zeus grants Poseidon some time with Percy. The film ends with Percy happily back in half blood camp.
I found the story just does not pack the punch it should and while the action moves from one thing to the next to be sure,it has with no real twists or turns to keep one guessing. I also found Percy's disturbingly tepid reaction to his mothers death to be rather strange considering how close they were. The S/Fx as I have said are impressive throughout. I found Uma Thurman as Medusa to be a real stand out with her delicious modern take on that creature.
The movie is quite clear and crisp and it is transferred into its original a/r of 2:35:1. Extras include deleted scenes,the trailer and a featurette on the movie.
All in all an average movie that should have been better than it was but is still an enjoyable romp through Mount Olympus and back. Recommended.",1309392000,,3827,4.445234708392603
4104006,2,B003AIL24C,"Look, I understand.  PERCY JACKSON & THE OLYMPIANS:  THE LIGHTNING THIEF is a movie for kids.  And the film is based on the books (which I am not familiar with).  And with actors the likes of Pierce Brosnan, Sean Bean, Uma Thurman, Joe Pantoliano, and Rosario Dawson (wolf howl) it certainly has star power.  Decent special effects, lots of action. . .so what's the problem here?  Goofiness.  Plain, old-fashioned, I-can't-believe-I-just-watched-this goofiness.  Children's stories should be imaginative and innovative and inspiring and uplifting--not banal and contrived and downright silly.  After watching this predictable mess I felt embarrassed--for the children who have sat through it.

I give the filmmakers some credit for at least exposing young audiences to Greek mythology; but the modern vs. ancient Greek worlds never really mesh, and this incoherence is augmented by, again, the relentless goofiness.  Logan Lerman is an unlikable protagonist as Percy, the loser teen who learns he's actually a demigod; and Brandon T. Jackson is merely annoying playing his sidekick Grover, a satyr who is supposed to protect him.  Everything is contrived, much of the acting feels forced, and the quest to obtain Zeus's lightning bolt to prevent the end of the world is pure nonsensical zaniness.  I hope some children got something out of PERCY JACKSON & THE OLYMPIANS:  THE LIGHTNING THIEF, yet I can't help but feel the 8-year-olds watching were blushing as much as I was.

I had trouble watching the movie at all. The sound balance was nothing short of horrible. You either couldn't hear a word anyone was saying or you had to rush to turn it down before you lost your ear drums. There was no in-between. As for the effects, I spent half the movie looking away from the annoying strobe effects that gave me a headache. If I could have heard what people were saying without having my hearing destroyed a moment later or actually managed to look at all those special effects they spent their film budget on, I might have enjoyed it. Judging from the other comments, however, I suspect I'm not missing much.

In short, there are plenty of better book-to-film adaptations out there, though few remain faithful to the books from which they are derived. It's more of a shock to find a movie adaptation that stays faithful to the book these days than the opposite.

I mean, yeah they could've done A LOT better, but remember, they have to change the storyline from the book so you don't know what's gonna happen. But maybe they stayed CLOSER to the actual storyline.
They kinda messed it up if they are going to make Sequels (Which they are) and I have a couple reasons why.

1. They made Hades the bad guy instead of Kronos.
2. Luke died or something...

I was disappointed that they left out the fight with Ares. That was one of my favorite parts of the book. Maybe next time they will actually READ the book so they know what to do.

4104014,3,B003AIL24C,"This movie has the most mixed set of reviews of any that I can recall seeing. At one end of the spectrum are those who think this is a great movie and are impressed by the fact that it's about Greek mythology. At the other end are those who loved the book and can't get over the differences in the film version. Somewhere in between are the rest of us.

Dealing with the five-star reviews first- have you people seriously not seen any movies better than this one? It's an exciting enough adolescent caper, with state-of-the-art special effects (already, of course, outdated). The principal character is likeable, his sidekick is funny and the girl, who remains just a friend, is attractive. The three of them set out on a quest to save the world from evil. Now, let me think, has that idea ever been used before? I'll just repeat the name in case you missed it: Per-cy Jack-son. Does that happen to remind you of Har-ry Pot-ter, by any amazing coincidence? As for Greek mythology- this story tells you nothing about it except the names. The author, instead of calling the three brothers Zeus, Poseidon and Hades, could have called them Larry, Moe and Curly and it wouldn't have made the story one jot less authentic. Indeed, he DOES call Medusa 'Auntie Em'; so much for Greek classicism. Take the movie for what it is, a rather derivative romp with no real substance, and enjoy it- but don't award it five stars.

As for the one-star crowd, why is it impossible for you to accept that a movie is not the same vehicle for a story as a book? If the director had tried to create a movie as faithful to the book as you would like (several people mentioned as one of their complaints that the character Annabeth has dark hair instead of blonde- is there no nit too small to pick?) the film would have been so long that everyone would have gone to sleep long before the intrepid trio got anywhere near the underworld. The test is not whether the movie is faithful to the book, but whether it works as a movie. Try to separate the two in your mind and you'll find you enjoy your evening a whole lot more than if you sit there muttering ""That wasn't in the book."" By the way, I read the book before I saw the movie, so don't accuse me of not knowing how wonderful the book is (it isn't, but that's another story).

In short, those who opted for a star choice somewhere in the middle have got it right. The average review rating is three stars and that's exactly what this movie deserves. It's an enjoyable, light-hearted couple of hours, with a good director and a decent cast. It's not a classic and it's not a dud. Now, if you'll excuse me, I must get to Auntie Em's before they close.

She had read these books several years ago so she didn't remember all the details, but that's probably a good thing judging by the other reviews here from fans of the books. As someone who had not read the books I saw it from a different perspective than my daughter. The storyline didn't make any sense. It jumps from one thing to another with no connections. Percy's instant acceptance of his previously unknown heritage is totally unbelieveable. The characters always seem to locate the one thing they need, know the exact place to go & the right thing to do when they get there.

The changes that the director made to this film were totally unnecessary.  As someone who ADORES these books, here are just a few of the things that bothered me.
1.  Why does Annabeth have brown hair?  *seriously, how hard is it to find a blonde actress?*
2.  Where was Clarisse?  She's a huge part of the books.
3.  Why did they have to make Riptide a clicker pen?
4.  Chiron's flanks were supposed to be white... why did they make him have brown horse hair?
5.  They wasted the first part of the movie with showing him in the water.  We find out quick enough who his dad is.
6.  Grover is supposed to have long curly hair to cover his horns.
7.  The Hydra was in the 2nd book... not the first
8.  The whole fight scene with Luke was just horrid.  The scene in the book would have been so much more effective.
9.  The search for the pearls?  Not in the book at all.... wasted time and missed out on great details in the book (like the mattress store scene)
10.  Persephone had nothing to do with his time in Hades.
11.  Hades isn't supposed to look like Hell.  It's not the same place as Christians think of.

4104019,5,B003AIL24C,"It's always difficult to find anything original to say about a product that has been reviewed hundreds of times. That said here are my impression.

No movie could have possibly duplicated the tone of the book. The book is written in first person by protagonist Percy Jackson. Much of the humor and tone of the book comes from Percy's hilarious commentary on his situation and various predicaments. Baring a narration device which is very difficult to pull off without slowing down the pace of the movie to a crawl, any movie made from the book had to take a different approach. The movie has to be judged on its own merits.

The movie pretty much succeeds in my opinion. I almost gave it four instead of five stars because I thought the Percy and Annabeth characters were undeveloped. Brandon T. Jackson's Grover stole every scene. The action sequences were well rendered and generally great, in many cases improvements over those in the book.

In short, the movie was about as faithful as it was possible to be to the book without being overly long. Fans of the book who don't like liberties taken will not like it, but all other fantasy action fans should have no problems.",1299456000,2,1175,4.666666666666667

Being a avid Ray Harryhausen fan, I couldn't help but notice the similarities between this film and Ray's Clash of the Titans and Jason and the Argonauts(certainly not bad company). The film has some super slick FX and impressive Mythology creatures ala Harryhausen(I know he didn't invent them, but he has certainly influenced their appearance of these creatures in films) and it is hard to not think of the starring trio from Harry Potter when watching the young stars of this film. Who can resist the casting of Uma Thurman as Medusa?! Uma is a beautiful woman, but I've always thought she was a little scary looking at the same time. (hehe)

It all seemed like familiar territory, but I enjoyed this film much more than I thought I would.

4104026,2,B003AIL24C,"Personally, I thought Chris Columbus did a pretty good job with the first two Harry Potter movies. But this movie was terrible. It was absolutely NOTHING like the book.

First, the appearance of the actors. They were way, way too old to be playing twelve-year-olds (the actress playing Annabeth was in her early twenties when they filmed this) and Percy was the only one who looked as his character was described in the book. Annabeth had brown hair and brown eyes and her personality was nothing like Annabeth's in the book. Annabeth could be a sometimes sarcastic know-it-all, but sweet. In this, she was a fierce warrior maiden and for most of the movie, pretty mean to Percy. Grover is supposed to be a redhead, awkward, gangly, but a good friend. In this movie, he had most of the attributes of a gangster. The only person who really was anything as they were in the book was Luke, but of course, being a good actor, he wasn't in it for very long.

My main problem though is that so much changed form the book. I'm okay with a few changes, with some books they are necessary. But this movie was pretty much nothing like the book. The only thing they had similar was the title. If they are to continue with the rest of the series, they are going to have a hard time explaining what everything is because they skipped out on a lot

(Spoilers ahead, if you don't want the movie ruined, don't read!)

--Kronos was not so much as mentioned in this book, which I think is pretty important. He's the main bad guy and it's going to be hard to make the movie if they don't have the main antagonist.

--Maybe this isn't really important, but they never mentioned Luke's scar, and it sort of stemmed his turning evil because he was mad at his father for giving him such a lousy quest.

--Grover's search for Pan isn't mentioned. It's not necessarily important to this film, but it is to the next one because it's why he gets captured.

--Hades never shows up as some sort of flame demon at camp in the book.

--It's never mentioned that Percy is a child of the Big Three and that's pretty important.

--A naiad gives Percy the pearls, they don't go search for them.

--Most of the monsters were missing from the film, such as the echidna, the Furies (the bus scene), and they added in the hydra

--The prophecy of Percy's sixteenth birthday. It's not mentioned and Percy is all ready sixteen in the movie. They need to do something about the prophecy in the movies since it plays a big role in the books.

If they do the second movie, I think they should get a new director because Columbus got this movie completely wrong.",1295654400,,2617,4.440501043841336
4104027,5,B003AIL24C,"This was an excellent movie, however, if you are looking for purity of translation from book to movie you may be disappointed. There were several points where the movie translation of the book strayed. Unfortunately, they were also key points and minor points. It will be interesting to see how they recover from leaving out or flat out changing the key points in future movies. I still recommend the movie, just don't look for a literal translation.",1295395200,,450,4.857142857142857
4104028,2,B003AIL24C,"Here's my take: if you've read the book, you'll probably be very let down by this film. It's not terrible, but so much has been changed, it's virtually unrecognizable. It's one thing to drop secondary characters and scenes that don't affect the outcome of the story; that happens in almost all adaptations. It's quite another to change main characters' personalities (in some cases, drastically), eliminate secondary characters that play a major part in this AND subsequent books, add characters that had no part in the story to begin with, and alter plot, motivation, and oh yeah, THE MAIN VILLAIN. You know you're off to a bad start when the title character's age has been upped almost five years, which flies in the face of the narrative thread that runs through the entire series! (Namely, the Prophecy involving Percy when he reaches 16). One can only deduce that this was made with little regard for fans of the book, which makes little sense, since those are the ones who were looking forward to it the most and most likely to see it in theatres.
The actors try, and Logan Lerman is an appealing Percy, but all are let down by a truly lame script that casts them adrift in cliche and tedium. If you haven't read the books, you're far more likely to enjoy this, but you may leave wondering what all the excitement was about.",1295222400,,1330,4.663829787234042

4104034,4,B003AIL24C,"After watching Clash of the Titans, it seemed fitting to watch a junior edition of the Greek Mythos. Percy Jackson & The Olympians: The Lightning Thief may have the longest title in the history of kid's movies.

It also was an enjoyable film.

Follow young Percy as he discovers why his mother lives with a slob of a man and why his best friend has to use canes to walk, yet seems to move quickly.

Being the son of a god means there are people/forces in the world who would like to see your ruin; and if they can tag you with stealing Zeus' lightning bolt, all the better.

Sean Bean represents Zeus in this film. It was hard for me to imagine Bean as a god. Pierce Brosnan is part man-part horse. Yet another image hard for me to imagine.

This is a fun movie for those it was intended - middle school kids. Adults may enjoy the fun romp, but by the end of the film, I was ready for Percy to just hand the bolt over already without having to fight for the longest time.",1294531200,,971,4.1436170212765955

I happen to be older but stuck with it to the end; I suppose I was curious how it would play out.

The special effects are very well done and visually convincing; the surround sound is also effective and has some powerful moments, especially if the volume is cranked up higher.

The movie views Percy, Annabeth, and Grover as around 15-17 yers old...totally wrong. They're around 11-12 years old. Second of all, Annabeth's hair is blonde,not dark brown or black. Also, it mentions nothing of the Great Prophecy, or Thalia's tree, or,anything actually important from the actual book. To add to this bull****, they make Grover black ...nice, make the satyr the black one. Also,their so-called ""quest"" had nothing to do with what happend in the book, really, trying to find the three pearls which Percy got from a river spirit in the book...nonsense. And also, when they leavethe Underworld, they take Percy's mom and leave Grover to do God kmows what with Persephone after throwing Hades in some fire in the fireplace...???, that never happend in the book. And also, the ending wasn't remotely similar to what happend in the book. Now,I realize a movie is never gonna be the same as the book,but they took it to far with this one.

He has taken a world that we are all familiar with... reintroduced it, creating a fantastic ride of adventure. A true treasure of a book.

The movie... was awful. The entire story line was changed. The entire plot rearranged. Sub-plots became the major plots and the major plots became sub-plots.  They took out several major characters, including Ana-Beth and Ares.

This is the third movie that I have seen directed by Chris Columbus - the first was HP 1 the second HP 2.  Columbus did what he did with the first two Harry Potter movies.  He ruined it. Destroyed it. There is no excuse for the creative liberty he took this time - because the books were fairly concise and they needed no changes.  The readers loved the book - why did you have to ruin it?!

A shameful excuse to make a few bucks. Horrible directing - for the simple fact that he pretty much rewrote the entire book.

Dissapointed. A shame that something like this was approved and allowed to be produced. A sham because the people who read this book will never know the real joy or enchantment of Mr. Riodran's writting.

And just like Eragon, Golden Compass, and Inkheart before it, Hollywood produces another clunker.  The special effects are good, and the dialogue is believable, but the overall movie just does not carry thru.  Maybe the biggest failure is the acting, of which there are many.  For example, Uma Thurman's Medusa seemed a little forced; her lines a little too rehearsed.  Another example is Grover, who seems to be in the movie for comic relief, as if the only role for black actors in sci-fi movies is comic relief; think Chris Tucker in the 5th Element or Eddie Murphy in Pluto Nash.  And then there is Pierce Brosnan and Sean Bean playing key supporting roles.  Funny, why is a movie about Greek myths using Brits to play Greek roles?

I very much enjoyed the book, and have read the entire series, but this movie was an epic Failure.  Look I know that books do not translate well into movies, so to expect it to be perfectly and follow it exactly is rather unfair, however this was nothing like the book and followed nothing at all.  I have enjoyed movies where they changed the story like Harry Potter, X-Men trilogy, and Star Trek.  I am not a Book -> Movie Nazi, but this movies was not even mildly entertaining.  Had it been a good movie with good acting I would have been forgiving of the fact that it did not follow the book.  But it was slow and boring and completely wrong.  I wish I could have these two hours of my life back.  Next time leave the movie in the Underworld with Hades.

What was wrong
No mention of the prophecy, wtf is this law about gods not being able to interact with their Children, children of the big three are rare?!?!? they didn't even mention that the big three had a pact not to have kids with mortals, left Grover in the underworld, no mention of the quest instead Percy just decided to leave, no interaction with Ares, had them run all over the US for pearls which were actually given to Percy in the book, Annabeth should be blonde, Ms Dodds should be the math teacher not a sub english teacher, no mention of the fates, so many more things missing... and it was utterly boring!!!!",1291593600,44,1539,4.257731958762887
4104047,3,B003AIL24C,"I can only echo what others have said in terms of the radical changes from the book to the movie.  With that being said, the movie itself wasn't a total loss.  Sure, I was disappointed that it was so very different from the book, including the fact that they changed the character who is the Lightning Thief.  However, I think that two of the main characters are portrayed by very charismatic actors (Percy and Grover.)  The movie Percy is different from the book Percy in that he's much more likable.  He seems to have a gentler, less sarcastic side to him in the movie and doesn't seem to be out to antagonize anyone, well, other than Gabe, and even so, he's much less antagonistic.  Grover is hilarious.  I didn't picture him that way at all while reading the book, but I see that it fits well.  Annabeth was the disappointment for me.  There was nothing at all about her backstory, whereas in the book, it helped to lend depth to her.  The actress couldn't inject enough personality into the role and came up short, relying on piercing stares and fierceness to establish herself.  There is a lot of sexual tension in the movie.  Much more than was in the book.  Grover's consumed by it.

I think that there is enough in the movie to carry it, especially if you haven't read the book and there's nothing to compare it to.  It was scary, quite scary in some parts.  I'm not a fan of surprises and ended up jumping a few times.  The story is an adventure and smoothly transitions itself through to the end, which was surprising for me as it was so different from the book.  Overall, it was okay, just not as outstanding as I had hoped it would be.

Yes, there are major differences from the book, but not enough to say that it's a complete and total departure.  I was really hoping that Percy's home situation would have resolved itself as it did in the book, but, alas, it wasn't to be in the film.  ((sigh))",1291593600,2,1910,4.4
4104048,3,B003AIL24C,"Hi, I'm Katie. Now before you read this whole long rant you should know: if you haven't read the books IT'S A GOOD MOVIE and that's all you need to know! PERCY JACKSON & THE OLYMPIANS: THE LIGHTNING THIEF IS AN AWESOME ACTION MOVIE!! End of story. However if you have read the books and you want to know if you should watch the movie: It depends- so, read below:

First about me, just so you know this is the opinion of a teenage girl, I don't know how an adult would review this but this is my personal opinion and I believe I have valid points so you should listen anyway.
I got hooked on these books when I started reading them to my little brother. My grandma sent the first book to him for his birthday, but it was a little above his reading level. When he saw the movie commercials on TV and he asked me to read it to him I thought what the heck? I really didn't expect to love them so much. After the first book I was addicted. I couldn't wait to finish the series. I've read them all. Its an awesome story. Now to review to movie, but first:

***A WARNING- I AM A SPOILER!! But I'm honest and at least read the rest of this paragraph, I promise no spoilers. First if you haven't watched the movie and have read the book you're lucky, because you can take the advice I'm gonna give you. Try to watch the movie with an open mind. There are lots of changes, its very different from the book but i loved it. However the movie is more for older kids. The books are appropriate for younger kids but in the movie the characters are like 16, (Sorry if that's a spoiler. But, come on, you can tell from the cover there's no way he's twelve!) And there are some inappropriate innuendos and more risqu scenes. Just a warning. For you people that have read the books and loved them, I do recommend you watch the movie but just be careful of your expectations or you may be disappointed. But who knows maybe you hated the books and the changes in the movie are you're style. :)

  And if you still want to read my review/opinion here it is.

  In my opinion the movie was great. But it would've been greater and less disappointing if it wasn't related to Rick Riordan's genius series. Because then there would still be hope for a good, book-following movie. And the now-crushed hope for a sequel.

  In the movie, Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief, I love that the characters in the movie were my age. It's easier for me to relate to since I'm not twelve. I wish I was Annabeth. The movie pulls you into the story just like the books, and I immediately fell in love with Percy! The acting was remarkable and the beginning of the movie was an awesome lead in!  The character I was most impressed with was Gabe. He was disgusting and rude, I felt bad for Percy's mom! I was disappointed that Gabe was the character most closely portrayed. Joe Pantoliano did an awesome job.

I was disappointed with how the story progressed.  The action and affects were good, but the scenes in the book were too. For example the chimera scene would've been just as good as the hydra scene. In Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief the movie, the whole middle of the movie is completely different. It's completely made up!! The journey to hell isn't as exciting and there aren't as many obstacles. And the huge characters that present the obstacles such as Ares, Clarisse, the echidna and chimera Mr. D, and Hephaestus are cut out because the story is so totally different. There's no stop at the arch, the diner or the water park. It's a domino effect of change.  And with those pieces and people missing, parts of the characters are missing. With out these details it not possible to learn about certain personal details like Annabeth's love of architecture. The important details that shape the book, like the prophecy, the story of Thalia, the pact are all missing. Even the reason they suspect Hades! In the book Chiron suggested Hades for the thief because he was angry with his brother for breaking the pact. That's never explained in the movie. Even little nit-picky details like Annabeth's supposed to have blond hair, Grover's supposed to be a little nerdy guy that gets bullied. Percy and Grover shouldn't be HOT! Percy should give Luke's shoes to Grover because it would be dangerous to fly in Zeus's domain. And I was disappointed in how the camp looked I was expecting something cooler and bigger. There are so many differences and not enough of the same parts in the book to resemble the original story.

  After I finished the book series I was super excited to watch the stories come to life in a series of movies. But that's impossible; because in the second movie they won't be able to add all the missing pieces.
That being said I know that it's nearly impossible to create a movie the mirror image of the book. But this is too different.  Other than characters names and the ending goal in the broadest terms, this movie completely different! One of the things I hate most about watching movies based on books I've read is when the creator takes too much liberty in changing the story. For example: My Sister's Keeper, WTF people!! Hello?? The wrong girl dies in the end! I wanted to scream.

  Anyway as I said before it is a good movie, and I love it! In fact, it's on my Christmas list. But it would've been better if they had at least kept ideas similar. Maybe my expectations were too high. But when I watch a movie the goes with a book I've read I can't help but note all the things different. I always read the book first and am usually disappointed (don't get me started on Twilight). But I can't just turn off my brain.

  If you've never seen this movie and you read this anyway. I'm sorry I told you I was a spoiler. But still, I DO recommend this movie. Even though there are an uncountable amount of changes, it's a good quality movie, but, be cautious because even though I love this movie, I only give it 3 stars because it's too different for me personally but maybe you'll like it. Consider yourself warned! :)",1291420800,5,6054,4.412926391382406

Even better, it helped my daughter and I discover the books. I never even knew the series existed. My daughter is in the fourth grade and she was so taken with the movie, we orded all of the books and she read through them in two weeks! Any movie that can encourage my child to do that has my vote! Not to mention, she loved telling me how the movie and the books differed from each other. I know many reviews were dissappointed because they had read the books first. But honestly, what movie ever compares to the book before it? This movie is fun, exciting and a great introduction to Greek Mytholgy. I also loved that it played on having dyslexia and ADD, and said those things were actually gifts and talents rather than disablilities.

4104050,1,B003AIL24C,"I was so excited to see this movie, then I saw it! :(

I read Percy Jackson and the Olympians series that Rick Rodian released and LOVED them. I actually got the series of books when the movie was released in theaters and made myself read them before I saw the movie because lets face it a movie that is based on a book always leaves out vital information. This movie left out everything!

I would like to know were they got the whole pearl idea? When did the mom play such a big part? Luke wasn't defeated at the end of this book. Annabeth was blonde, a book worm, and fought with a dagger. There was no Clarisse from the Ares cabin! There was NO Ares either! Half blood camp was described differently and Poseidon didn't build Percy a cabin. No one knew Percy was Poseidons kid until Poseidon claimed him. Hades never formed out of a fire at camp half blood. The book had an oracle that gave a Great Prophecy. Oh I could go on forever on all the things that the book had and the movie didn't but I think this is already long winded.

I would NOT recommend this movie to anyone that has read the books. I think that you would be left wondering what the heck you just saw. I had to even make sure it was the correct movie that I put into the dvd player. A HUGE TWO THUMBS DOWN!!!!

I just hope that some good film maker takes it in and realizes that it could be really fun. Not great because it just what it is: a cool kids tale. Which is all Riordan ever meant to do.
There could be so much more though. Half the story was left out, including all the references to the continuing story. Like I said, it's bad. But it's Percy and it could be so much more. I will continue to hope. (It was kind of a little bit of a guilty pleasure though. The CGI guys were having a great time.) Bad though, campy bad.

4104058,2,B003AIL24C,"Confident this is enjoyable...if you're 10 years old.

Otherwise, as a general cinema buff, you'll find yourself stumbling across massive plot holes and choking on a preposterous story. There's suspension of belief for a film's sake. And then there's just plain ol' mind boggling moronic.

Guess which of two options this production falls into?

Tells the tale of Percy Jackson, the hidden son of the Poseidon - Greek God and Lord Of The Seas. Growing up in New York with adoptive parents, he has no idea of his true heritage, although there are hints that something is different about him. Now, having reached young adulthood, Percy is finally told who his real parents are and is given a chance to join his fellow demigods in a special school where he can train to become a great warrior.

Got that? The Greek Gods - Zeus, Apollo, Athena, etc., and Greek mythological creatures like Medusa and Pan - and they're all living in the United States. Not Greece, or even Europe, they've moved to the East Coast.

Why? Who knows. <smdh>

I will say that I suspect this film does not play well in Greece.

And before any fanboy or fangirl jumps in to say, ""This, this is the reason!"" (emphasis on the exclamation point)

Here's my point - and one that I seem to be repeating more and more nowadays:

IT'S THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE FILMMAKERS TO DELIVER A STANDALONE PRODUCT. IT IS NOT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE AUDIENCE TO DO FURTHER RESEARCH IN ORDER TO MAKE SENSE OF THE MOVIE.

I could do a point-by-point deconstruction, but what would that accomplish? It's like discussing the Middle East Peace Process with the self-same ten year old, whose glassy eyed stare of boredom would be your only reward.

Additionally, it's usually a bad sign for any film if the best elements anyone can talk about are the special effects - which by the way are decent-to-pretty good.

If you have young children - this is a 'must see'. If you're a teenager this is a 'might rent'. And if you're an adult this is a 'must pass'.

Personal Notes:

- I'm actually a fan of YA movies. Done right, they can be very enjoyable. The 'Hunger Games' franchise and newly minted 'Divergent' films are proof that these productions can be appreciated by a wide audience.

- Feel bad for Pierce Brosnan. I know he quietly campaigned to be in the Harry Potter franchise, and this movie must've seemed like his chance. Sad for him.",1290038400,,2391,4.632701421800948

For the first ten minutes of the movie the pretty much stuck to the book, however after those ten minutes I honestly have no idea where the rest of the story came from.  Not one scene that I was so anxious to see that was in the book, was not there.  The movie itself was ok, I think I would have enjoyed more if I hadn't read the book.  For everyone that as not seen the movie I would recommend for you to watch the movie before you read the book to try and avoid dissapointment.",1289347200,2,628,3.992
4104061,3,B003AIL24C,"When the movie first came to theater, I encouraged my son we should read the book before seeing the movie.  The first page of the book had us hooked!  The time for it to be in theater ended so I bought the movie as soon as it came out on DVD.  By this time we had read all 5 books in this series and had gobbled down the 1st book in the Kane series.

We were disappointed in the movie.  It strayed away from the book and Greek mythology.  As one reviewer points out about Percy, Annabeth, and Grover being greeted by Pes ... Pes (what her name???)  Anyway, that particular gal wouldn't have been with Hades in the Underworld because it was Summer!!  She only stayed with Hades during the Autumn and Winter.  Also, since the Oracle was eliminated, they elimated a MAIN character that shows up in ALL 5 books.

I give it 3 stars because .... 1) As an action movie with a story of it's own it does ok and my son chose to block out that fact it didn't follow the book.  When you judge it as movie, it can stand.  2) Because it didn't follow the book nor remain true to the plot of the book.  So, I give it the ""middle of the road"" score.

I would like to take this time to mention that parents should take an active involvement with their children's reading and entertainment choices.  I read one comment by a parent that said Medusa was scary looking and the movie isn't for ages 8-12.  Well?  Sorry, but that is Medusa for ya!  Have ya read the book or studied any Greek mythology?  If the 3 headed dog in the underworld doesn't scare ya, nuttin will.

4104062,3,B003AIL24C,"I, too, am a big fan of the books and took a group of four kids (two eight year-olds, one ten year old, and one eleven) to see this--only one of whom had read the series. I think all 4 kids modestly enjoyed it, but it wasn't something that they would wish to see again or get on DVD.

Most of the changes from the book were not upsetting. I think using the Parthenon in Nashville was inspired, for example--but that was about the only inspiration in the movie. The ages of the characters were one of the big problems. Instead of having kids the age of the ones in ""Chamber of Secrets"" we get fully-fledged teenagers, played by adults. I thought Daddario's performance as Annabeth was particularly off--I didn't think the 23 year old actress was in any way convincing as a 16 yer old character (who should have been 12).

The elimination of Kronos from the plot was, I think, a very poor choice on the part of the film makers, at least it was, if they had any intention of making more of these movies. (So was casting adults who were already too old to be playing kids. So was pulling the hydra out of the second book and putting it in the first movie.) Without the overriding plot of Kronos's awakening, there would be nothing to tie a second movie to the first. I can understand not wanting to complicate the story--which might have become quite confusing with that added layer--but it would also have upped the stakes for the characters--and the viewers.

My biggest problem with the movie was thematic. In all the old myths, the gods kept their distance from their children, not because they were forced to, but because they felt it the best thing for them. By keeping their distance, they allowed their kids to grow and test their own strength, and not rely on their godly-parent to bail them out, or even for advice. By keeping their distance, their children had to become more than just their parent's kid. You can imagine that today's hyper-successful parents face the same dilemma--do they withhold money and assistance in the hopes that their kids will find their own way? or do they set the kids up with a trust fund so that they never have to achieve anything in their lives?

Instead of using this real theme from mythology, the filmmakers rejected it in favor of modern view of parenthood--of course the gods want to play a part in their kids lives, but Zeus just won't let them. Zeus thinks it will make the gods weak if they associate too much with their kids. So instead of wise and powerful gods, you get whining and weak ones. And instead of a really challenging view of parenthood, we get the same kind of parenthood you see just about everywhere else.",1289001600,2,2671,4.5010309278350515

The acting was quite good, the story pacing was dead on, and it had both action and comedy. I watched it three times and then decided it was time I read the books.

I just finished the second book in the series about ten minutes ago, and now I understand why so many fans of the books are upset at the movie adaptation of their beloved story. Aside from the VERY basics (i.e. who Percy is, who the Gods are, the lightning bolt being stolen, and the quest) the movie doesn't stay true to the book at all. While everyone knows book adaptations are not going to be 100% accurate, I think most fans hope for at least 80-90%. This movie is closer to 50%, if that.

Percy's best friend is characterized completely differently in the movie than in the book. Rather than an awkward teenager who is unsure of himself we're given a smooth-talking lady's man. The character who turns out to be the major villan of the book is completely left out of the movie - which then makes someone else the villan for the movie's purposes. The screenplay writer left out major plots, I'm assuming because he felt it wouldn't make for a good movie. My issue with this is that if the story wouldn't make a good movie, why did Disney go forward with it, other than to make a buck?

In the end, though, I still enjoy the movie. Just be aware that if you're looking for it to be true to the books, it's not and you'll likely come away hating it. If you just want to enjoy a movie and can overlook it's adaptation flaws you'll probably enjoy it very much.",1288051200,,1659,4.293929712460064

I didn't dislike it, but it didn't quite make it to ""liking it"".  I don't think, in fact, that I would read the books now, except they were spoken of highly in these other reviews.  My critique:
1. The acting was weak.  Percy was almost credible and that was about it.
2. The story had way too many holes in it (e.g.  Percy & his mom lived with a smelly grotesque bum - is that the best option?  The guy smells and masks Percy's demi-god odors.  That's pathetic).
3. The story line pushed sexuality - it didn't need to.
4. The story didn't flow well.  It was like watching a video game jump from one task to complete to the next.  I got bored pretty quickly and just sped up the DVD to get through it.  e.g.  It never explained why Percy presumably stole the lightening from Zeus and why he was suspect)

Having said all this, I can say it's worth watching if you don't have to pay to do so.

4104075,3,B003AIL24C,"""Percy Jackson & The Olympians: The Lightning Thief""
------------------------------------------------------------------
The first film in a presumably long franchise, this adaptation of the popular fantasy book series has moments of wonder, balanced by hours of tedium and mediocrity. A lot of the film seems underbudgeted - the acting in scene after scene falls flat, as if the director kept saying, ""Eh. That's good enough. They'll still buy tickets.""

The same was true with the special effects and set design: eh, good enough, I guess. While some attention was lavished on Medusa's snake-y tresses, and Hades' demonic fire was cool, many monster sequences had a Harryhausen-esque clumsiness that's surprising to see in this day and age. Finally, the script was atrocious -- dull, flat, overly full of exposition, short on emotional resonance. A lot of this had to do with direction and pacing: Chris Columbus simply doesn't let scenes breathe, he's in too much of a rush to meet his deadlines and get his product out to market. For example, when Percy and his gang realize they've been tricked and that one of them has to stay in the Underworld, hardly anyone bats an eyelash when Percy's sidekick Grover volunteers to become eternally damned. Oh, okay man. Bummer, but I'll come back and get you out. Later, dude, gotta roll. Fight sequences have a similarly lax feel: Minotaur? Dead in sixty seconds. Fire demon? Don't worry; it'll go away soon.  Zeus hassling you?  Tell him to chill, dude.

I dunno. I guess this film was ""okay,"" but if you're going to make a fantasy epic, why not make it, you know... epic?  Or fantastic? Why settle for just okay?  (Axton)",1284422400,3,1666,4.996389891696751

The Justin Bieber hair and the squishy, constipated emo facial expressions teenage percy had plastered on his face really did not help endear him to me. Was annabeth supposed to be a cyclops? because i only saw ONE of her gigantic creepy blue eyes the whole movie. (yeah by the way, in the book her eyes were GREY and her hair BLONDE not brown.) in the book grover, the satyr is supposed to be pale white with red hair. i do appreciate hollywood trying to squeeze in minorities into the movies but was it really necessary to have a MYTHICAL CREATURE behave like a STEREOTYPICAL HORNY GHETTO person? It's a KIDS MOVIE, leave the sex stuff out for goodness sakes! I think it's more insulting to black people than it is beneficial. would a white skinned satyr have acted like that? no? then leave it out!

forget the physical appearance of the actors, 90% of the movie was totally different than the book. the ONLY thing i actually liked was the Uma Thurman scene (Medusa) medusa was supposed to be ugly in the book but the movie did a good job (or at least Uma Thurman did.)

I've never read the books, I haven't read or seen any Harry Potter, and I still haven't seen Lord of the Rings at this point, so I'm not ""over-sensitized"" by the fantasy genre like some people may be. But I did recently see The Last Airbender, which is a total desecration to its source material. And I have to say, with that heap of garbage in mind, The Lightning Thief blows it out of the water in comparison. Lightning Thief is a PG movie, which doesn't bother me at all, as I personally think the rating has come to allow a lot more these days in terms of content. Any fan of the original or remake of Clash of the Titans should be able to pick up on a lot of the similarities in terms of screenplay and parts of the plot. And, it just so happens I've coincidentally had quite a bit of exposure to both versions of Clash, as well as Jason and the Argonauts within the last few days of this review, making this transition relatively smooth. When I first saw the trailer, the concept struck me as a modernized version of old Greek tales, though much more geared towards the young teen demographic. After eventually having my fair share of the Harryhausen classics and Leterrier's action-ized revision, I have to say Lightning Thief actually makes for a good dose of family entertainment. It never takes itself too seriously, has a fairly light atmosphere between all the protagonists, and manages to tell a decently-paced adventure story. The script runs a bit on the generic side and the child actors don't get much room to show any real potential, but I like the casting of the adults. Sean Bean, Pierce Brosnan, Steve Coogan, and Kevin McKidd add a good deal of maturity, and even a little poetic savvy with what little screen time they actually get. The film probably won't garner too much praise for originality, but if the mood ever strikes you for an effects-laden fantasy film, Lightning Thief wouldn't make for a bad choice.

Video - 4.5

Lightning Thief presents itself on BD with excellent quality. The cinematography has a peculiar ""darkness"" to it that makes for some very bold colors. Greens and blues stick out the most and look very lush early on in the film with a chromatic progression towards more reds, grays, and blacks around the end. Black levels are deep and don't suffer any instances of crush, despite the photography, and contrast is very good at accentuating the actors' faces, as well as the fine prop and set designs. The special effects look especially pleasing with some pretty seamless integration of CG and visual staging. Two parts that I really like are the trip into Hades for its eerie and fearsome depiction, which I think was rather scary for a PG film, and the scene where Percy starts to realize the greatness of his power by summoning up a couple of pretty big tidal waves. And while the image is relatively sharp, the dark photography does manage to lose a little bit of detail in some of the low-lit scenes. Otherwise, the picture is nearly flawless.

Audio - 5.0

While the video may be just a tad off, the audio quality for Lightning Thief is flawless. Dialogue is crisp through the center, while high and low ends give off great fidelity. Being a fairly robust action film with a good deal of sound effects, directionality and separation are spot on. Mythical creatures, clashing weapons, and magical energies pop all across the sound stage with proper panning from left to right, right left, front to back, etc. when the action calls for it. Little things like shuffling feet on terrain, snake hair, flames, and water ripples help in showcasing the subtleties of the track. The score by Christophe Beck immerses with a very balanced plethora of orchestral pieces and adds that extra sense of depth to the adventure and action. But the real beast of the audio is bass. LFEs range from low and constant to absolutely booming. A good indicator of what to expect for a majority of the film should be from the get-go where we see Zeus introduced as his thunder rumbles in the night New York skies. From there on out, it's reference audio.

Extras - 2.0

Not a whole lot, here. No commentary track, 14 minutes of deleted scenes, a couple of interactive games that are nothing more than window dressing, and only about 20 minutes of making-of or behind-the-scenes featurettes. We get very brief interviews with various important persons like the director, the creator of the novels, the composer, and the three main child actors, but that's it.

Overall - 4.0

Lightning Thief is innocent and harmless fun that's definitely geared for PG audiences and family atmospheres alike. It's not the most original of fantasy tales, but what do you expect from a guy that was just trying to make up a bedtime story for his kid? I'm sure there's a lot of depth missing from the books that would certainly add to the plot, characters, and everything else, but I personally find this to be a better film than another piece of crap that came out the same year. With excellent video, reference audio, though a meager set of extras, Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief comes recommended.",1283817600,,5145,4.663726571113561
4104082,4,B003AIL24C,"1 Disc Widescreen DVD, being released June 29, 2010

""Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief"" besides being a mouthful was directed by Chris Columbus with a screenplay by Craig Titley based on the novel by Rick Riordan. Riordan's books much like the Harry Potter series, have really taken off particularly with the middle school age crowd. His stories follow Percy Jackson named after Perseus who discovers he is a demi-god, son of Poseidon and that there are other demi-gods living among them. Once thrown into this new world, he is wrongfully accused of stealing Zeus' lightning bolt and has to find a way to rectify the situation to save his mother being held hostage.

The story itself is charming and empowering much in the same style as Harry Potter. Just like Harry, Percy discovers he has powers, that there is a place he can go to train and learn more about his past and his abilities with other children like him and also like Harry, someone out there resents him and is setting him up to take a fall. For heaven's sake, Harry even has a lightning bolt scar on his face! Despite all these similar factors, the story works and is appealing, particularly to children with dyslexia like Percy has. Of course, his turns out to be a special ability to read ancient Greek so good for him.

Percy is played by Logan Lerman whom you might remember from ""3:10 to Yuma"" looks like an up and coming Zac Efron with almost Elijah Wood caliber blue eyes so holds his own pretty good appearance-wise and emotionally as a lead in this series. Catherine Keener lends extra star power by playing his mother, Sally.

His sidekick or ""protector"" has he prefers to be called is Grover played by Brandon T. Jackson. Grover is a Satyre whose first priority is to look out for Percy (second priority to find hot chicks). Percy's love interest is Annabeth, daughter of Athena, played by Alexandra Daddario who is very intense with a sword and even more so with her piercing blue eyes.

More stars clocking in here are Pierce Brosnan in a too-short stay as a Centaur professor, Uma Therman as a wonderfully hypnotic Medusa, Sean Bean as Zeus, and Rosario Dawson as the very seductive Persephone, wife and hostage of Hades.

The story is fun and exciting, not as much as the more popular Harry Potter series, but a good one for kids to jump into since Harry Potter's movie run will be ending soon and this Olympians series is just getting started. Hopefully as the characters age, the intensity will as well following the pattern set before it. I highly recommend checking it out. It's young, cute, adventure-y, and brings in all that fun Greek God mythology. Heck, I liked the Medusa in this film better than the one they came up with for the ""Clash of the Titans"" remake which is saying a lot since they went a different route and made her all modern here. Gotta love exciting times and mutant-like abilities!

Bonus Features:

In the deleted scenes, Grover takes pictures on his cell phone of one of the naked Greek statues, gives some back story on a failure in his past being a protector, dances and fights more at the Lotus casino, and Hades laments how miserable his life in hell is making a good argument for letting him have the power to overthrow his brothers which is probably why it was cut.

There is a Powers Quiz that poses a series of statements asking you to choose how you feel about it with happy/sad/mad/indifferent faces and apparently matches you to the most likely God who would be your parent.

""The Book Comes to Life"" is a featurette where the author Rick Riordan talks about having his kids and his students read this book before he sent it off to a publisher and how the grassroots phenonmenon of popularity started for the series. Chris Columbus was attracted to the project because his daughter was listening to the book on tape and she is dyslexic just like the main character so he loved how empowering this was for kids with dyslexia to dream of being a demi-god. Of course there is a trailer in the extras too but that goes without saying.

I did not get to review the Blu-Ray edition, but it apparently has twice as many deleted scenes and four more featurettes about Greek Gods and being on the set with Brandon T. Jackson.",1283817600,,4254,4.598944591029023

This movie was a horrible disservice to Rick Riordan and the Percy Jackson books. I wish HBO or any other cable channel with the means would hire intelligent visionaries who are fans of the material to develop a series based on the books. The difficulties would include aging the characters believably from 12 to 16 or so, but perhaps certain books and series (such as the Harry Potter books and this one) can truly be brought beautifully to the screen only as part of TV. As to this and the Potter films, there are those fans of the books who dislike the film adaptations and those who just don't care; they'll see anything based on their beloved books. Count me in the first group.",1283299200,8,824,4.427631578947368
4104086,2,B003AIL24C,"I read the Percy Jackson series twice, once before viewing the DVD and once after. I had been trying to encourage my 13 year old son to read the series, but he only did so after seeing the DVD. So, if nothing else, the movie encouraged my son to read! For everyone who liked the movie, I highly recommend that you read the series! The written storyline is so much better!

We never saw the Lightening Thief movie in the theater, only the DVD. My son liked the movie. The actors were very good and so were the special effects. Unfortunately,the movie deviated from the storyline to the point that the major reason for any sequel was lost. I was very disappointed in the DVD storyline; so much so, that I gave the DVD away and will not keep it in our DVD library.

SPOILER ALERT, I'm now stating some of the differences and why I was disappointed. There were a lot of minor differences that can be attributed to poetic license.  One example is that the characters were all in their late teens in the movie, whereas in the first book Percy and Annabeth were only 12. Another example is that Percy didn't know that he was a demigod at first. The latter doesn't detract from the series; but the former does, because of the prophecy. The reason for Percy not knowing his dad was attributed to Zeus' jealousy of his brother Poseidon. Hades was portrayed as a maniacal power grabber, where in the book he is not so evil. The characters of Ares and Clarise were omitted. Some of their attributes were given to Annabeth and Luke respectively. The more substantial omissions and changes detract too much from the storyline of the book - let alone the series. There was no mention of the prophecy of a child of the ""big three"". There was only superficial mention of Kronos in the museum scene. Luke was portrayed as the bad guy behind everything, instead of as a pawn for Kronos. Percy, Annabeth and Grover go after the lightening bolt in order to try and rescue Percy's Mom without permission, instead of with permission because of a quest. Minor details: the ""Pearls"" were a gift from Percy's Dad, not items that they needed to find (although it was done well in the movie); Percy wouldn't wear the flying shoes because of Zeus, so Grover wore them - in the movie he not only wears them, Percy battles Luke with them on; the St. Louis Arch part of the book was omitted; the ""Parthenon"" replica in Tennessee was not in the book; Luke tries to kill Percy at the end of the book and then disappears.

With the omission of Kronos and the prophecy from the storyline of the DVD, I don't see how they can hope to create a series of movies.  I for one, will not go to see them - they can only be made by deviating even further from the written series.  It is a crying shame, with the actors, directors, producers and author involved, it should have been a real triumph; instead, it was a farce.",1283040000,9,2877,4.418867924528302

Good points:
-Good graphics
-okay plot
-Acting is good
-Funny, hip, movie aimed for teens

Bad points:
-Loss of background, like Nancy Bobofit(Yancey Acadamy)and the first time he uses his powers.
-The ages of the actors, book describes them as 12, in the movie they are like 14-15
-Character flaws- Grover is sopposed to be timid, not confident and joke-cracking (MAJOR let down), Annabeth has ALOT more envolvment in the story then the movie depicts, they captured Percy pretty well.
-Leaving out characters- Examples- Clarrise, Dionysus, Ares,etc.

4104092,1,B003AIL24C,"Created for a younger audience you can understand the sophomoric atmosphere that permeates this film. But the film also has a ""dumbed down"" feel that actually becomes irritating. Some have compared this, and even suggested that it competes, with Harry Potter films, I disagree. Harry Potter is: Respectful - even to his enemies. Academic - having a hunger to learn. Humble - confiding with and yielding to his elders and even his peers. Cooperative - working with others to achieve what's best for everyone. Considerate - considers the thoughts and feelings of those around him, even when they are wrong or confused. Although Harry faces tremendous obstacles, including dealing with the loss of his parents, he always displays an air of integrity and honesty that gains him the respect of his elders, peers, and even his enemies.

Percy Jackson is: Disrespectful - to his father and teachers, it's all about Percy, after all he's a child of a god. Inconsiderate - doesn't even consider that his father CANNOT associate with him. Anti-academic - doesn't listen to learned or intelligent people, is torpid in class listening to his music player with a vacuous stare in his eyes (blames dyslexia & ADHD - more pills please). Thief - steals the gold coins from the fountain before knowing they could have belonged to Medusa or not, although that's not a justification. Uses people - Percy and his mother use her ""boyfriend"" (his stink) to hide Percy from the gods (what did Percy do when he was away from him). Vengeful and possibly murderous - in an epilogue scene, between the credits, the mother's ""boyfriend"" is murdered using the Medusa, knowing full well of his obtrusive nature that he would spring the trap they set for him. These flaws are not only supported and approved of, they are praised (the centaur, played by Pierce Brosnan, shows approval and admiration for Percy's disobedience). Also the basic premise of the film depends on him not obeying and suggests that the only reason to have authority and rules are to disregard them. Although Percy faces tremendous obstacles, he does so in a bumbling, foolhardy, ignorance is bliss kind of way that risks the lives of himself and those around him. Evidently because someone in the heavens is watching over him.

Although gods are ultimately created as a means of control, the Greek gods were also born from a desire to understand and explain nature and man's place in the universe. The gods of today are created to control and dominate nature and man. That is why both suffer so much in our time. The ancient people had already faced the contradictions of most of their beliefs and tried to deal with them. Notice in this film that the gods are very emotional and have many human characteristics like anger, sadness, and petty rivalry. However they are not omniscient, they do not know everything. Zeus, Poseidon, Hades, as well as the other gods have no clue as to where Zeus's Bolt is located.

An omniscient god cannot have emotions. For example, if you came home to find that your spouse has been having an affair. You would become angry or sad because it is new information, something you've now learned. If you had all knowledge there would be nothing for you to learn, you would have known it for as long as you existed. An emotional omniscient god nullifies itself. So an omniscient god repentant of previous actions that eventually destroys everything in a flood because of anger is illogical. Another example is an infinite, perfect, loving god who has no need of anything and therefore could not experience loneliness or lack creating a people knowing that ninety percent will suffer an excruciating torture for an eternity. If you were all-knowing and knew you were going to have ten children but eight or nine of those children would suffer not only in this world but for an eternity in a hell, I doubt you would ever have children. I wouldn't do it if only one of my ten children were to suffer. To experience loneliness and satisfy it knowing that it would cause unimaginable suffering would be the ultimate in selfishness. To be all-loving and do it would be the ultimate in cruelty.

For ages gods have been a perfect way to control people. Simply create a god, then define what [you] the god likes and dislikes and which people to hate or love. Then exploit peoples fears and prejudices, using laws or violence if necessary. And presto! You have control. This is why gods tend to look like or have the characteristics of the people, culture or environment, of those who worship them. Contrary to some popular belief god is actually made in our image.

If all the world decided that we would not acknowledge any god, we would not go to a church, temple, synagogue, etc., there would be little change. If we decided to do the same with money, that we would not buy or sell, the world system would come to a halt. The true god of this world is money. There's a correlation between the fact that the majority of people that believe in a god have less money, are more illiterate, and are therefore more controllable. A very small percentage of people control the wealth of the world and a large portion believe in a god. If I were to ask you to find the closest source of the words ""In God We Trust"" where would you suggest? Religion doesn't teach you HOW to think, it teaches you WHAT to think.",1282089600,2,5367,4.711395101171459

4104094,2,B003AIL24C,"What a disappointment.  After all, the book was terrific and the director is someone who has done 3 of my all time favorite movies (the first 2 Harry Potter, and Adventures in Babysitting).  Too many things were changed or omitted which totally changed the ""feel"" of the book.  The movie seemed rushed to cram a lot in, yet too many key topics were left out. First, the Luke-Kronos relationship was left out, which is the main plot of the 5 book series.  Then, the age of the kids were changed from 12 to 17, which blows away the age 16 prophecy part.

The acting was pretty terrible, too.  I would not be so harsh with my review, except that I know Chris Columbus can, and has done so much better.  Perhaps he was trying to avoid the obvious similarities with the Harry Potter series (2 boys and a girl battling a once-destroyed evil from coming back to power...), but in the process, the spirit of the novel was lost.",1281830400,,919,4.402366863905326
4104095,5,B003AIL24C,"Although my wife and I enjoyed the movie I may have given it a star less except I'm adding another because of the negative book reviewers writing movie reviews.

I must admit it took me awhile to move beyond that same desire which blinded me to the good points. It was made into a movie and some of the material is there to expose the public to an interest which will hopefully get them to read the books.

We had no preconceptions going into this movie as neither of us had read this set of books. We will now that we have seen the movie. We find it better that way so we don't cast dispersions because of disappointment. We both found the casting, directing, sets, cinamatography, costumes, F/X, music, sound and the rest quite good.

The story takes place now with a young man in High School living with his mom and stepfather. When Zeus's lightning bolt is stolen he believes Percy, son of Poseidon, stole it.

Percy isn't even aware he is a demigod and when he is told it is overwhelming at first as he also has to go on the run to avoid mythical creatures trying to kill him and get the lightning bolt for themselves or their god. Percy (Perseus) goes on an adventure with a satyr and the daughter of Athena. While trying to collect three pearls they encounter the likes of Medussa and a hydra along the way. They try to get Percy's mother out of Hades and return the bolt to Zeus. Overall it smacks of an updated version of the original mythological story of Perseus.

The younger actors give more lively performances as the young demi-god, Percy Jackson, along with his inevitable love-interest and loyal side-kick satyr (who steals every scene) have an exciting road-trip from NYC to Hell (AKA Hollywood) and back, saving Percy's mother and exposing the evil-doer's plot. The ""surprise"" betrayal by another demi-god is ill-explained and consequently ill-portrayed by the actor, but in an awkward-looking aerial fight, as expected, the hero saves the day. In the end, this is a typical hero-in-the-making movie with quite a few weak points but still manages to be quite a fun watch, even though it might not be a strong enough installment to be memorable or launch a franchise.",1281571200,,1011,5.246913580246914
4104099,2,B003AIL24C,"After reading The Lightning Thief, I decided to see the movie adaptation.
To my dismay, the movie was a disappointment.  In general, it doesn't bother me when film makers change a book's original story when adapting it to the screen.  As long as it has a good story and interesting characters, I'm happy.  This is where the movie The Lightning Thief went wrong.

It seems the film ignored the strong storyline of the book, and instead of progressing in its own unique direction, the film substituted the potential quality of its story with flashy fight scenes, shallow dialogue, and static characters.  It's just another shallow adaptation of a thoughtful, complex book.  Rent it if you must see it.  Not worth buying.",1281484800,,718,4.884297520661157
4104100,3,B003AIL24C,"'Percy Jackson & The Olympians: The Lightning Thief' is the kind of film young boys between the ages of 8 and 12 will go absolutely crazy for. I know I would have if I were still somewhere within those age parameters (some would say I still am but that's another matter). Yes I suppose some girls will enjoy the movie as well however it's generally boys that become absorbed in ancient myths and legends. Just think of it, Olympus and the Gods along with minotaurs, satyrs, centaurs Medusa, furies and many other divine and semi-divine beings exploding to life on the television screen. Great stuff if you're willing to accept good special effects and ignore the rather tepid story-line and particularly horrendous dialogue.

Another negative was the rather uninspiring acting abounding in this film. Yes the cast was attractive and did include a number of well known actors and actresses but there rolls where small and little more than cameo appearances. The lead roles were held by the younger members of the cast in the roles of sons and daughters of the Elder Olympian deities. These youthful demi-gods were likable enough but unfortunately their performances just didn't succeed in breathing life into their desired to be bigger than life personas.

Bottom line, much of the story simply didn't work. After all is said and done; the monsters slain, the quest completed and the mystery solved the audience is left with a rather trite day of dysfunctional deities who are too busy quarreling amongst themselves to participate in any form of parental care or guidance to the next generation of demi-gods.

4104126,2,B003AIL24C,"My irritation with this movie came from the fact that the book had real potential for becoming the next great teen adventure series. I read the books a few years ago, and I knew the series' dynamic characters, winding storyline, and breathtaking imagery would make an amazing movie. Of course, when I heard the movie was in the works I was very excited.

But then I saw the movie, and was horribly disappointed.

I did not expect the movie to stick to the events and details of the book with extreme precision, but I didn't expect such a complete disregard for the original story either. Some differences are easy to tolerate (such as the change in the character's ages, or the actors' differing physical appearance from their counterparts in the novels) but most of the changes were too great to bear. All of a sudden, Percy has escaped camp with Annabeth and Grover on a personal mission to gather three pearls that will allow him to enter the underworld long enough to explain to Hades that he is not the lightning thief and then escape unscathed. Virtually every aspect of Percy's original journey is either omitted or reworked to fit the new story line.

The only detail I liked was the definitive final battle with Luke through the New York skyline (which was also not part of the original story) because Luke's defeat meant that there will most likely not be a sequel to this terrible film.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Percy-Jackson-The-Olympians-The-Lightning-Thief/dp/B003HARV3Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Percy Jackson & The Olympians: The Lightning Thief</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Percy-Jackson-the-Olympians-The-Lightning-Thief-Blu-ray/dp/B002ZG98J6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief [Blu-ray</a>]",1280275200,,1841,5.861940298507463

One normally expects movies to be a bit inaccurate... one also accepts that there is a certain.... value, per say... that is lost in the transition of book to movie. However... what was done to this book is unforgivable.

Nothing is accurate. Nothing even touches good acting. It was a mediocre film with a whole lot of ""nothing"" thrown into it.

I thought, perhaps, that it might be because it was made to target a much younger age group.... however, the comment Persephone makes,""I've never had satyr before...."" leads me to believe otherwise. Also, even if the movie WAS targeted for a much younger age group, even that fell short. My four year old AND nine year old, were unimpressed. My friends six year old was so captivated by the movie... he fell asleep.

In the production, a lot of important information was cut out.... I would say roughly... all of it. It makes me wonder if they will even attempt a sequel. .. I certainly hope not. I cannot even fathom how they will tie everything in.

Once again, I  know that books and their movie counterparts are rarely exactly alike... however... EVERYTHING is not normally lost in the transition.

I will not be seeing the sequel, or anything resembling a take in the novels again. I refuse to commit  my time or spend my money supporting such a colossal waste.

I would give this movie zero stars if I could. If you want to be unimpressed, rent it from the redbox. But please, do not waste your money on buying the DVD.",1280102400,12,1623,4.568965517241379
4104130,2,B003AIL24C,"Can anyone answer this simple question?  Why does Hollywood constantly feel the need to take an existing property that's loved by millions and turn it into something that bears almost zero resemblance to the source material?  I just don't get it.  Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The lightening thief is yet another sad example of this far too often occurring phenomenon.

Don't get me wrong, I am not a super fan of the book.  I thought the book was entertaining, but pretty mediocre.  That being said though-I still expected a decent movie.  My first reaction after seeing it though was...""huh?""  and ""Did I miss something?""  First off, it was completely wrong in tone.  Granted, the book is very contemporary as are the characters, but at its heart it's still a fantasy.  The movie by comparison tried to be some uber-cool teeney bopper road trip flick that just didn't fit the context of the story.  Second, there are missing characters (Ares anyone?), tons of missing scenes and even a major plot point that's completely absent.  Also-the kids seem way too old.  And what was up with Grover?  The Grover from the book is completely gone-replaced by a completely different character that totally misses the point of who Grover really is.

Even if you ignore the book, I still don't think this is a very good movie.  Besides a couple of really cool scenes and really cool creatures-this movie came off as kind of obnoxious.  Good casting on the adults though (Ares, Poseidon, Athena, Chiron) as well as Percy & Luke, but I can't say much for the rest of the cast.  The actor who played Grover was pretty good, but like I mentioned-completely wrong for the character.  Just like Eragon & The Golden Compass  I doubt there will be anymore books in this series developed into films.  And rightfully so.

  It's nice to see Chris Columbus return to making the kind of movie he's good at, since both Christmas with the Kranks and I Love You Beth Cooper were horrible. But Percy Jackson isn't as good as the book since the effects are weak and Columbus' direction with the first 2 Harry Potter films is much better. With Percy Jackson it's as if he wasn't even trying and as if he was thinking ""I made two Harry Potter films, I can make a Percy Jackson one with my eyes close."" While the movie doesn't follow the book close enough either, too much was cut out.

  Percy Jackson is basically Harry Potter with Greek Gods instead of Wizards after all. Percy is a hyper active kid who has no idea he's special and he lives with his mom and his smelly step-dad that he can't stand. Soon teachers turn out to be not what they seem and he finds himself in a world of magic and mystery.

  That does sound a bit like Potter doesn't it ? The author of the books brings more originality to his books than you'd think though. I'm reading the first book now and it's really as if I never seen the movie.

4104140,2,B003AIL24C,"First let me say that I have not read any of the books, and I had no prior knowledge of the series before seeing the movie.  I think the second disclosure I should make, for the record, is to seeing this movie on the plane.  Granted I was lucky enough to see it in first class, but still, the screen is tiny and the sound just doesn't bode well for a good movie experience.  I am sure these factors degraded my appreciation, but I have to admit there just wasn't much there to pull me in.  It seemed cumbersome, choppy, forced.  Almost as if it were tripping over itself as the movie progressed.

The movie begins with Percy living the life of an ordinary high school student.  He has no idea he is a demigod and the son of Poseidon.  During a trip to the museum he gets attacked by a creature from beyond and finds out the world as he knows it is not quite as it was.  His mother along with his protector (Brandon T. Jackson) attempt to take him to the safety of the school for the God's offspring.  Mom then quickly gets abducted and shipped off to the God Hades.  Seems that before Percy even has a chance to digest his newfound status he immediately sets off on a quest.

His goal is to grab a few keys for the return trip home, but these are guarded by a few ugly looking creatures.  Medusa is played by Uma Thurman and all I can say is in context of the movie, oh how the mighty have fallen.  Uma attempted to reincarnate her ""Kill Bill"" persona, with a hair full of snakes, but sadly there was just something missing.  That seemed to ring true with most of the story.  Luckily Uma only graced the screen for a few minutes which led us to the overriding plot.  Poor Percy was accused of stealing Zeus' lightning, and at some point he really needed to clear his name to avoid an all out war of the Gods.

In the end of course Percy saves the day and hands over the lightning, back to Zeus the rightful owner.  He rescues his mom and luckily she finally evicts the foul smelling step father.  Apparently he was only around to mask Percy's aura anyway.  Damn, now what a mom will put up with for the sake of her god like son.  We never did get to see if Percy hooked up with Alexandra Daddario, but she was one of the truly refreshing aspects of the movie.  She played a hard core fighter with just enough of the soft side to keep all the young boys on their toes.

Keeping in mind this was a movie geared toward the younger generation, it was ok.  It seemed like it could have been so much better but just never quite figured out whether it was an adventure film or a comedic spoof.  The lame jokes were buttered a little too heavily for me to tolerate in an all out epic quest flick.  I would be have been a little saddened to have paid money to watch this film, but on the flip side it would have most likely been substantially better if I had seen the movie on a screen larger than six inches while sipping Champagne.

If you are a 12 year old boy or younger you will most likely enjoy the film, if you are anything older than 12 you will probably walk away wondering why you watched it.  Still, if you are flying coast to coast, and you have nothing else to do, flip on the headphones and lay back.  It will make the time go by faster than watching the clouds below.",1279065600,,3274,4.158982511923688

**Some spoilers to follow so don't read if you don't want to hear about the movie**

My first huge gripe came up about 5 minutes in to the movie.  Who is this kid?  It can't be Percy because Percy is only 12 years old.  But of course, it was Percy.  The rest of the characters were totally miscast as well.  In the book, Grover is kind of shy and comes off a bit as a nerd.  Not the cool guy that's portrayed in this movie.  The same thing with Annabeth.  Where's the brainy cute BLOND?  Not the a** kicking brunette with the bad attitude.

Next thing that irritated me to death was the adventure to the Underworld AKA Los Angeles.  Where was the stop in St Louis?  And when in the books did they go to the park that had the Parthenon replica?  Where was the waterpark stop?

My biggest disappointment was that Chris Columbus directed this horrid movie.  I had such high expectations since he did the first Harry Potter movie and it was spot on!

I'm not sure what to say next.  Do I hope the next movie is made?  I'm kind of undecided.  That was my 2nd favorite book in the series.  Part of me does, part of me doesn't want the disappointment if it sucks.",1279065600,,1289,4.192622950819672

After reading the entire Percy Jackson series, I was very hopeful for this movie to be something similar to the books. Again, I was wrong. Chris Columbus is by far the worst director in Hollywood.

Throughout this endless pile of dreck that was supposed to have something to do with Percy Jackson, we kept looking at each other in bewilderment.

***SPOILERS! Do NOT read any further IF you don't want info about the movie!!!***

Here's a list of Pros & Cons about ""Percy Jackson"":

CON: Percy Jackson - in the book, he's a 12 year old with ADHD and dyslexia...which causes him to have issues in school (so much so that he changes schools frequently).  In the movie, Percy is now 16-17 years old with a weird Adam Lambert haircut & a ""wink wink nudge nudge"" delivery of his lines.  I think this was an agenda to try & snag more teen/tween girls into attending.  I had a hard time thinking he was a credible Demigod when he looks like the mutated love child of Zac Efron & Justin Bieber.

PRO: Grover - I just have to acknowledge the fact that Brandon T. Jackson (who often stole the show in ""Tropic Thunder"") made a great Grover.  He played him with humor & distracted us from Zac Bieber's inability to act.

CON: Clarice - is missing. Completely.  To have Percy's major antagonist completely MISSING from the movie was just plain stupidity.

CON: Annabeth - is different. Completely.  The ""writers"" of this movie decided to blend the characters of Clarice and Annabeth...resulting in the ""Claribeth"" mess in the movie.  She's the daughter of Athena but kicks booty like a daughter of Ares.  Disappointing doesn't even begin to cover it.

CON: Hades - played by the often hilarious Steve Coogan.  Hades could've gone both ways - either wickedly evil OR (by using Coogan's talents) weirdly funny.  Instead, Hades came off as anemic & a tad boring.

PRO: Medusa - brought to life with an over-the-top performance by Uma Thurman in an acting style a tad reminiscent of her ""Poison Ivy"" role.  I think this movie could've been good if it was all handled a bit more tongue-in-cheek.

I could go on but all I have are more ""cons"".  The only other ""pro"" would've been the character of Luke, who was believable as a snarky teen with daddy issues.  I'm thinking this series will flame out (cinematically - see ""The Golden Compass"" for another example of this) before it even really started due to shoddy writing, bad casting, and an inability to adhere to the original plot. Chris Columbus should be ashamed for his true disservice to a great series.",1278720000,65,2583,4.628571428571429
4104149,3,B003AIL24C,"Our story takes place in the present, where the gods of Mount Olympus are fighting with each other. Zeus' Lightning Bolt has been stolen! He charges the son of his brother Poseidon as the thief. Zeus issues a warning that if the Bolt is not returned in 14 days an all out war will ensue that will destroy the Earth! Now Percy finds himself caught between angry and battling gods, he and his new found friends must embark on a quest to catch the true lightning thief and save Percy's mom from Hades!

That is the story in a nutshell! The problem here lies in the way the story is rushed along. This is a story about Greek Mythology which is so rich in history. In order to achieve a reasonable runtime, character and plot development are really thrown out you in waves (pun intended). They seem sacrificed to get to the great CGI action sequences. Very little explanation or none is given as to why Percy is considered the thief or how he learns to fight and use his powers so well. These are things that hurt the overall story and give it a 3 star mark. Please, don't get me wrong. This is still a very enjoyable movie, just lower your expectations.

BLU RAY THOUGHTS: This is a gorgeous disc. The picture is very strong with a wonderful audio mix. The cgi action sequences will blow you away. A special effects feast! SPECIAL FEATURES: You get some deleted scenes and a mixed bag of extras which are ok. FINAL THOUGHTS: Fans of the books and/or fantasy, this is a MUST OWN.",1278633600,,1474,4.395604395604396
4104150,1,B003AIL24C,"Positives:
They employed more visual arts personnel than actors. Downside - graphics, although good, were largely stolen from 5th grade Greek mythology story books.
Negatives:
(1.) Whenever a film relies upon darkness to convey darkness I know immediately - cheap film. This one is so dark that when I turn the brightness to the highest level - it's still black. In effect you see nothing! So what's the point of creating a monster if you can't see it?
(2.) It takes a creative mind to write/direct creative & plausible fantasy. It takes a ""short-cuts"" mind to write/direct ridiculous fantasy. This movie would have fit perfectly into a Disney, Hannah Montana dream episode.
(3.) It takes no mind to utilize the following formulae to sell to the 9-16 year old demographic: Scenes with a dysfunctional family; defiant teen; a black, an attractive female, good looking male (the typical triumvirate with minimal acting skills) and a fourth nerdy-techy providing backup. Lots of close ups of aforementioned male & female teens checking each other out to provide filler and sell the sex-appeal.
(4.) Dialogue utilized the minimalist quickie dictionary of the 100 most frequent words in a 9 year old's vocablulary. Further degraded into contrived and artificial cliches such as Percy's first & primary question to Hades on learning his mom might be dead in his domain, ""What have you done with my mother?"" - Ughhh
(5.) The camp for demigods looked more like a Boy Scout's summer camp with playground equipment added in. The fight scenes, with obviously plastic swords, looked so staged I was waiting for the director to yell ""action"" or whatever and suddenly every evenly spaced/paired group starts swinging their swords about. And why swords? Hello, 21st century teens that are half gods and do have some god-powers and besides there is technology such as what's found in any gun shop.

4104151,1,B003AIL24C,"I managed to swallow Chris Columbus's changes to the first two Harry Potter movies, but the travesty he created from Riordan's lively, likeable ""quest"" novel I just can't ignore or forgive. All the great conversations, the truly funny situations, the believable universe, and the contemporarizing (is that a word???) of Greek mythology that made Riordan's novel (and the complete series) such great fun were completely ignored. What this movie is instead is a retread of every stereotypical ""fallback"" character, plot line, and dialogue ever presented in a movie for preadolescents. Obviously, the choice of young stars was to introduce two more attractive youngsters who have some potential--whether as actors or teen idols remains to be seen. But what was the point of making Grover an over-sexed satyr? Of making Persephone a hot mama? Of making the Lotus Hotel an older teen's idea of free drinks, free sex, free gambling? Of making the gods SO stereotypical of every bad B movie from the 1930s through the 1990s? I mean, Riordan created a great new consistent universe, and Columbus turned into a tired old grade-B (even C or D!)
stereotype.
Don't bother with the movie--get the audio books instead! Jesse Bernstein does a good job with the tone and feeling that Riordan created.

Riordan respected his audience, and created well and true for them; Columbus, on the other hand, ""disrespected"" Riordan's intent, and it shows.)",1278547200,282,1515,5.112903225806452

4104154,5,B003AIL24C,"I never knew much about the Percy Jackson series before watching this film.  Based on what I saw in the commercials, however, I went into this film with the prejudice that it would be a corny, wannabe Harry Potter movie.  Boy, was I wrong!  What I liked most about this movie is that it is FUNNY.  Among all the antics and adventures that the kids get themselves into, there are a lot of jokes among the action that keep you entertained.  The actor who plays Grover, Percy's best friend, definitely delivered many laughs.  I was quite surprised to see how talented the young actors were- each actor only made me more engrossed in the movie and there was no awkwardness in how the actors delivered their lines.  All the actors (adult and child alike) had great chemistry.  I also found the plot to be fresh and entertaining and I retract my statement that this would be a wannabe Harry Potter movie. I now think that the Percy Jackson series stands on it's own as a fun fantasy film for families.  I SINCERELY HOPE THERE ARE SEQUELS TO THIS GREAT FILM! As a novice in Greek mythology, I enjoyed learning new and interesting facts about Greek mythology throughout this film.  The plot is simple and light (by which I mean not too much blood and gory and dark issues being discussed) and something that a family (or just anyone) can sit down and enjoy.  I will say that the issue of drinking and (slightly) abuse are discussed, but things wrap up beautifully, so no problem there. :) There was also some slight sexual content in this film (cleavage bearing females) but it is NOT the focus of the film. This content does not last long so just skip ahead a few seconds in the film.  All in all, between all the action and laughs and sweet friends/family moments, you will be thoroughly entertained.

First, books translated to film always must be rewritten and altered for time/pacing.
FACT: You CANNOT put an entire book into one movie.
The only bad thing about it, in my point of view was, they rushed to get so much into the movie that it was, well, rushed. I guess I have to say that it was also not likely that Zeus would be so eager to falsly accuse Percy. He had absolutly zero evidence or knowledge who the thief was and was threatening war? Some explaination of this in the movie would have been welcome.
I found it interesting that because they couldn't tell Percy of his past, they had to explain his gift of reading or translating writing as ADD/ADHD or Dyslexia. His gaining control over this gift as he learned of his lineage was an interesting concept. I also found it interesting that he was a very fast learner and a natural leader. All it took was him learning the truth.
If they make any other movies based on these books and Chris Columbus makes the movie, I'll go see it.",1278460800,,1215,4.264069264069264

4104157,3,B003AIL24C,"It's interesting that the ubiquitous negative reviews regarding The Lightning Thief come primarily from those who abhor the deviations from the book, while those giving the film positive reviews come mainly from those who haven't had the opportunity to read the book yet. I'm of the latter camp.

Why, for example, doesn't anyone give a film like the Wizard of Oz deplorable reviews because of its deviations from the book? In fact, I'm curious how many people are familiar with the Wizard of Oz through their knowledge of Hollywood's depiction of it, rather than Baum's actual book. Gone are the Hammer-Heads and China Country, as well as some of the Witch's machinations, just to name a few. The Wicked Witch of the West summons 40 Wolves to kill Dorothy and her friends. The Tin Woodman slays them with his axe. The Witch also summons 40 Crows to peck out the eyes of Dorothy and her friends. The Scarecrow defeats them by grabbing them and breaking their necks. Kinda bleak, if you ask me (and not a little violent). But both versions of the Wizard of Oz are immensely enjoyable on their own terms, and I wouldn't change either for the world.

As for Harry Potter, I only read the first of the novels. The travesty of the film version (The Sorcerer's Stone) was that it was nearly a carbon copy of the book. While the film attempts to do service to the book and its readers by being a faithful adaptation (way too faithful, in my opinion), it ends up being quite stilted and boring.

On the other hand, the Lord of the Rings film trilogy strays from a chapter-by-chapter accounting of its source material out of necessity; all the while, however, it maintains a devoted love and integrity to the book. The result is a visually brilliant and smartly crafted epic.

The Lightning Thief film may not have the artistic depth and merit of the Lord of the Rings film trilogy, but it's also not the boring carbon copy that the first Harry Potter film was. And while the deviations from the book may, indeed, be sacrilegious to the many who had high hopes to see the story's characters and plot elements come to life straight out of the pages of the book, I found the film to be an enjoyable popcorn flick, nonetheless.

But that's just my two cents worth...

(Oddly enough, although I'm sure there are more than a handful examples, the one instance that comes to mind in which the translation to a different medium is actually better than the original source material is Wicked. Great musical to watch, but a ponderous experience to read the book.)",1278374400,2,2545,4.631929046563193

Honestly, Hollywood should throw this attempt on the scrap heap and try again, or better yet, let a British film-making crew have a go at it, because that's the only way the project gets handled with the finesse and tact appropriate to 3000 years of civilization.

The movie solved the first two mysteries in the very first scene, ignored the subplots and many of the rich characterizations that made the story half-way believable.  We're left with some good CG monsters and a cast whose talents are totally wasted on a really banal dialogue.

Some of Grover's dialogue was certainly ""cringe-worthy"". With better screen writing, this could've been a lot better. I don't even think many oscar award winning actors could've done much better with the script. The flow also seemed very rushed and it sort of jumped around a bit too fast. There is a lot to the story that I know they wouldn't have been able to incorporate with their budget or time constraints, but I believe the story could've been adapted better for the screen.

Oh and his best friend isn't really handicapped, but walks with crutches because he's really a half man/half goat satyr who pretends to be handicapped because  he doesn't want to scare everybody with his cloven hooves.

Welcome to the wonderful world of Percy Jackson, star of a series of extremely popular books written by Rick Riordan and now his own big budget adventure movie directed by Chris Columbus. Like that other franchise Columbus helped bring to theaters -- you know, the one about a young wizard fighting a guy whose name you aren't supposed to say - Percy Jackson & The Olympians: The Lightning Thief is an uneven blend of broad mainstream entertainment and very specific details designed to make the rabid fans of the books happy with the adaptation. As a result, the film gets a little bogged down in details along the way, and way too much of the dialogue plays like a Cliff Notes version of a high school history book, but the special effects are cool and the adventure is fun to watch.

The film stars Logan Lerm
The adults in the movie are a mixed bag, too. Steve Coogan is fantastic as Hades, God of the underworld, and it is fun to watch him go toe-to-toe with his wife Persephone as played by the always entertaining Rosario Dawson. Uma Thurman will simply haunt you as Medusa.

That's the good news.

On the other end of the spectrum, Sean Bean and Kevin McKidd are little more than cardboard cutouts as Zeus and Poseidon, immortal siblings looking to start a war, and Pierce Brosnan is downright awful as the centaur Chiron. It may be the gear he has to wear to make his horse body special effect work, but Brosnan goes through the movie looking like he's in severe pain whether the scene calls for it or not.
an as Percy and the mix of anger and acceptance he brings to the role is really interesting to watch unfold as the story goes along. As his hairy-legged sidekick, Grover the satyr, Brandon T. Jackson is a good match for Percy, combining street sense with the inside knowledge of the gods that will keep his friend alive, delivered in a sly and comical way. Unfortunately, the third member of the heroic trio, Alexandra Daddario isn't given much to do beyond stare at the camera and pose in some overly choreographed fight scenes.

4104166,4,B003AIL24C,"My review is mainly on the audio and visual quality of the blu ray disc itself.

First off, the picture quality is very good. It's not as striking as Avatar, but it is still good, even for blu ray. However, where this disc really shines is in the audio quality, particularly the bass (LFE). From the opening 5 minutes you can tell that you're gonna be in for a real treat. The bass is the star of the show. For those who have a capable sub, you will be rewarded with thunderous amounts of LFE throughout the whole movie. Some movies only have one or two scenes of impressive LFE, but this movie is filled with heavy amounts of LFE. In fact, this blu ray will definitely be demo material for me to show off.

Don't worry, bass isn't the only thing that's worthy to write about. The overall surround presentation of this film is just as engaging as the LFE. Each and every battle scene (and there are plenty of them) hits you with sound from all angles. Sword swings, fireballs, and lightening bolts all attack the soundfield with heart pounding authority.

Although the movie may not win an award for Best Picture, the audio quality of this movie will make Percy Jackson's adventure that much more enjoyable to watch, especially those with a capable sound system.",1278028800,,1262,4.526315789473684

The young actors actually manage to do surprisingly well; it's the older ones who tended to fail. Sean Bean was shockingly bad as Zeus, the actor playing Poseidon only a little better. Brosnan might as well have been a block of wood. Only Steve Coogan and Uma Thurman managed to have some dignity (and that's debatable). It's too bad the changed plot made no sense. Starting a war was going to achieve the titular thief's goals...how exactly? Never mind, we'll just create a new action setpiece out of nowhere and hope the gee-whiz water effects dazzle.

Very few things in the film remain true to the books (which by the way were delightful, action-packed, funny, and charming). So many things where changed from the very minute (hair color of characters (Annabeth)), to age (Percy & Grover), to more important aspects of the novel such as motivation and personality of characters (Percy, Annabeth, Posieden, Grover, etc), to the disappearance of characters (Ares, Clarisse, Mr. D., etc.) and who did what. And what the heck was up with Rosario Dawson's character?!

I understand that it is hard to stay within time constraints when moving from a book to film but this movie stretched that concept to the extreme.

Bottom Line: It you have not read the books you MAY enjoy this film. If you HAVE read the books and are expecting to see characters brought to life on screen please, please, please proceed with caution! If you have read the books and simply just don't care then enjoy!",1277942400,17,1052,4.774725274725275

THINGS THAT BUGGED ME
1.  Annabeth -- the movie combined her character traits with Clarice and left out Clarice entirely.

2.  Chiron -- poor centaur costume that looked like, well, a costume.  Compare it to the centaurs in Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian; or Harry Potter.  Much more 'believable' in those films.

3.  No prophecy -- the weight of the story is taken away without it. The importance/relevance of the quest did not come through in the movie.

THINGS I LIKED
1.  Grover -- the movie made Grover more fun and cooler than the books, while keeping the essence of him being a Goat Boy.  Very well done and his costume looked more natural (believeable).

2.  Auntie M -- these scenes were brilliantly done.

STARRING: Logan Lerman, Brandon T. Jackson, Pierce Brosnan, Alexandra Daddario, Katherine Keener, Jake Abel, Sean Bean, Uma Thurman, Kevin McKidd, Joe Pantoliano, Steve Coogan and Rosario Dawson

WRITTEN BY: Craig Titley; based on the novel by Rick Riordan

DIRECTED BY: Chris Columbus

Rated: PG
Genre: Science Fiction / Fantasy
Release Date: 12 February 2010
Review Date: 26 March 2010

I never went to see Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone at the theater, because I didn't think it would live up to its hype. Having seen it recently for the first time, although it was good, I was right. I had the same thoughts based on the trailer to Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightening Thief. But man, am I glad I didn't listen to them!

Although Greek mythology was hands down the most pointless thing we ever studied in high school; it was still one of the most interesting and the film displays it wonderfully. It was a ton of fun and was oozing with the perfect blend of humor and beautifully constructed fantasy / action driven sequences.

Logan Lerman practically screams to us, ""Hey, I'm ready to be famous now, because I'm clearly talented!"" and he's right. The kid has got something and we have only seen the beginning of him, trust me. He stars as Percy Jackson; a kid who has a terrific mom played by Katherine Keener, and a dead-beat dad in Poseidon (Kevin McKidd), the god of the sea.

Don't worry, the film doesn't ask us to believe that a god who stands several feet taller than any human being, actually impregnated Percy's mother while in his physical god form. Gods are able to shrink down to the size of all of us, as is shown to us in the opening scene, which looked amazing. Poseidon emerges in all of his god-like glory from the ocean, arousing some unwanted suspicion, by some nearby humans.

Poseidon transforms himself down to an un-noticeable size and continues on his way as if nothing has happened. He has a very important meeting to attend to, with Zeus (Sean Bean), the god of gods. At this meeting between Zeus and Poseidon, we learn that Zeus's notorious lightening bolt has been stolen, and that Poseidon's' son Percy is believed to be the culprit.

Zeus awards Poseidon with a limited amount of time to retrieve it before he will unleash all of his fury. Why the two gods had to have this meeting on earth rather than back at home, where they live together is beyond me. Oh, I guess they wouldn't have been able to open the film with that shot of a giant Poseidon emerging from the ocean... yeah that's probably why. What was I thinking?

Not being able to intervene in person, Poseidon sends a comedic sidekick to protect his son. Percy befriends Grover (Brandon T. Jackson), who is half goat / half teenage boy. I suppose if you already have daddy issues brought on by a severe case of abandonment - it will only add fuel to the fire to discover that your father made your best friend be your best friend. Just a thought.

Grover and Percy team up together with the help of another teen, who doubles as a secondary sidekick and a potential love interest to Percy. Along their journey to recover the stolen trident, they are met by the following interesting characters: Pierce Brosnan toting a horse's body; Uma Thurman in a dazzling performance as the sinister Medusa; a cunning portrayal of Hades (the god of the underworld) by Steve Coogan; and of course, the most dashing lady in Hollywood ever, Rosario Dawson, as the imprisoned love stricken princess to Hades, Persephone.

In addition to these characters played by real life actors, we have daring run-ins with some spectacular computer generated monsters, one of which includes a muliti-headed, fire spewing dragon. Don't take the film's PG rating lightheartedly if you plan on bringing little ones; the special effects are terrifyingly convincing.

I'm pleased to see that 2010 is as of yet not the CGI nightmare of a fiasco that 2009 was. With the release of The Wolfman, The Book of Eli and now this, we're off to a pretty good start as far as computer animation is concerned. The effects in this film were the best yet for this year. Look for the water effect that takes place on a rooftop; sensational. And how about Medusa's heedful of sadistic snakes?

Attention currently unknown future director of the second Wolverine film; if you are reading this - please hire the special effects crew of this film to do Wolverine's claws for us will you? Thanks!",1277942400,,4507,4.694550063371356
4104171,2,B003AIL24C,"Okay. First off, I have to say that I absolutely LOVE the Percy Jackson series. It's funny, creative, and very well put together. When I heard that they were going to make Percy Jackson into a movie, I thought it was a mistake from the start. I know what happens to books that are made into movies. Then I see that Christopher Columbus, the director who put together harry potters one and two (which i thought were amazing because they actually followed the plotline with minor mistakes) was going to directing it and suddenly I was hopefull again. I bought a ticket and went to go see it with my friend (also a huge fan of Percy Jackson).
I was very upset with the way this movie was put together. NOTHING IS THE SAME! Clarisse, Diyonisis, Procrustes, echidna, and Nancy Bofit aren't even in the movie. Oh, and neither is Thalia's tree which is a big part later in the series. I can't believe that Clarisse wasn't in there (to tell you the truth i would have liked to see that part where Clarisse gets a mouth full of toilet water. Hahaha). And the Annabeth actress sort of takes on the role of Clarisse, even though she's not as big of a bully.
  They cut out most of the good parts that were funny, and the actual places that they went were replaced with others. The dialogue was also different. All of it. I think the only sentance that was the same was when Percy says to Grover ""You're half donkey?"" and Grover replies, ""Half Goat"" Which leads me to my next complaint. Grover is supposed to be so unsure of himself and a good friend. He's constantly nervous. In the movie he is a player. He's flirtatous, happy, and full of self confidence.
  Anyways, the whole thing with the arch was cut out. The thing with the fates was cut out when Percy saw them on the bus. AND THEY STOLE A CAR AND DROVE! They're supposed to be 12, not 16 or 17! The waterbed palace was cut out, i would have liked to see their take on procrustes.
  I could go on forever and ever but I'm not going to bore you by telling you all the details that i've noticed. When it's your fave book turned into a movie, you tend to compare the two. Bottom line, the plot was so screwed up that it wasn't even fun to watch. I almost fell asleep.
  The pros to this movie is that the graphics were AWESOME! I loved the river Styx. It was amazing. I would have liked to see elysium though. Anyways, if you're asking my honest opinion, I wouldn't buy this movie. I would rent it to see if you like it before you go all willy nilly and get it. If you're a serious Percy Jackson fanatic, you've probably already seen it and been mad about how badly they twisted the plot but. . . all i can say is I hope the next one is better, although I don't see how they're going to make a comeback from this.",1277942400,3,2757,4.228136882129277

4104175,4,B003AIL24C,"I really enjoyed this movie, even though there are slight changes to the story compared to the book.  First of all the plot line of the story... Percy is an ADHD and dislexic child attending Yancy Academy.  One day on a field trip, a substitute teacher pulls him aside but turns into a winged creature and attacks him. Mr Brunner, another teacher, and Grover, a friend of Percy's, come to his rescue and subsequently explain that the winged creature was a furie.  Percy is given a ""pen"" that turns into a sword from Mr. Brunner, and sent off to Camp Half-Blood.  On the way to camp, Percy, his mother, and Grover are attacked by a Minotaur.  Percy defeats the beast but not before he believes it has killed his mother.  Percy and Grover arrive in Camp where he meets Chiron, the centaur.  Chiron shows Percy the cabin that ""his father built for him.""  The audience finds out Percy's dad is Poseidon.  The campers then participate in a pretty full contact game of capture the flag, where Percy beats Annabeth.  At the celebration that night Hades appears in the fire to force Percy to give Zeus' lightening bolt to him.  Percy, Grover, and Annabeth then set off on a quest to get Percy's mom back from Hades even though Percy didn't take the lightening bolt that Hades wants.  Luke, another camper, gives them a few items to help along the way, such as a shield and some winged shoes.  In order to exit Hades they must find three of Persephone's pearls that are hidden around the USA.  And off they go!  They rest would just spoil it for you : )

I know that it was different in ways from the book but I, overall like the flow of the movie a little better.  I do wish they would have kept all the detail regarding info on the Greek gods and myths in the movie.  I also feel that the movie version of Camp Half-Blood did not live up to the image the book portrays and therefore could have been done better.  I was really looking forward to seeing all the cool cabins, especially Poseidon's, but they were just kind of generic camp tents in the movie.  Also, they took out a lot of what went on at camp before the quest and people Percy meets.  In the movie there is no Dionysus, no oracle, no prophecy, and no Thalia's tree.  Oh, and Clarissa.  If you have never read the book you wouldn't feel like something is missing but it would have been cool to see the oracle and in my opinion the prophecy is important for the sequels.  All this said, after Percy and company leave on their quest, I like the movie better.  I probably can't give you as much detail on this but....I felt the changes they made to the book to make the movie after they left camp made the story flow much more smoothly.  I liked that they left out Ares and Aphrodite, which in my opinion seemed a little disjointed from the rest of the plot of the book.  Instead the blame goes right to Luke, which makes sense.  And when they are traveling the country in search of the pearls....makes way more sense when thinking about why they traveled all over and then Poseidon's messenger just happens to give them the pearls.  Also Percy's defeat of Luke at the end is way more believeable than Percy defeating Ares, god of war!!  Anyhow, I hope you enjoy the book and the movie!  I would recommend both!",1277856000,,3264,4.381031613976705
4104176,2,B003AIL24C,"Like many others, I read the five books before I saw the movie.  (I'm an adult, but my nephew was reading them at the time.)

My biggest gripe is the age difference.  In the movie version, Percy is older at the start of the series than he was at the END of the fifth book.

I don't really miss Dionysis or Ares, but I think Clarisse (daughter of Ares) was too important a character to be left out.  I also don't like that the heroes weren't sent on a quest.  Excuse me, but going on quests is what heroes do.

Despite the fact that I would rather have seen a much younger actor play the lead, Logan Lerman was very good.  Kevin McKidd's opening scene was much better than his closing one.  Brendan T. Jackson, as Grover, also gave a good performance, but I didn't care for the sexualization of his role.

The special effects and computer graphics were the movie's strong points.

I read others having problems with Avatar when it was released due to DRM problems, which this is also 20th Century Fox, so I wonder if this is the same problem.  The BluRay Player has the latest firmware updates, and it appears to pick-up the disc okay on the menus.  As I said it even plays the 20th Century Fox intro.

With it just coming out today I didn't figure there would be many people reporting problems just yet, but if anyone does please post a reply.  Unless I find something new tonight I'll take it back tomorrow and see if they can help.

4104178,4,B003AIL24C,"New on DVD this week is PERCY JACKSON & THE OLYMPIANS: THE LIGHTNING THIEF. Long title but what would you expect since the books it's based on has the same? Having never read the book written for the teen crowd and having no expectations for the movie, I went it not knowing for sure what to expect. For me that turned out great as I came across a highly enjoyable movie.

The movie opens with a meeting between Zeus (Sean Bean) and Poseidon (Kevin McKidd) atop the Empire State building. It seems someone has stolen Zeus' lightning bolt and he believes it was Poseidon's son. He now gives Poseidon 10 days for the bolt to be returned or war will break out between the gods.

Off we move to Percy Jackson (Logan Lerman). Percy is your typical high school nobody. With best friend Grover (Brandon T. Jackson) he wanders aimlessly through school dealing with bullies and dyslexia. But on a trip to a local museum's display of Greek mythology the Greek words read clearly to Percy. When a substitute teacher takes Percy off for a discussion, she turns into a scaly winged Fury and attacks him, asking where the bolt is. To his rescue come Grover and teacher Mr. Brunner (Pierce Brosnan). Once the Fury is gone, they tell Percy he needs to learn the truth and head to a place of safety.

With his mother and Grover along, Percy discovers who he truly is. It seems that Percy's father was Poseidon, making Percy a demi-god or half human/half god. The place of safety is a camp for those like him in training but before he gets into the camp, his mother is captured by Hades and taken to the depths of hell.

Once inside the camp Grover reveals his true form, a satyr or half man half goat. Mr. Brunner also reveals himself as Chiron, a centaur who trains those in the camp. Discussing the problems at hand, Chiron begins training Percy. During the training, Percy takes an interest in Annabeth (Alexandra Daddario), the daughter of Athene and makes friends with Luke (Jake Abel) the son of Hermes.

Tested in battle, Percy learns of powers he has that derive from water. Knowing that he must go to Olympus to tell Zeus of his innocence, he first decides to rescue his mother from Hades. Joining him in his quest are both Grover and Annabeth. To find the gate to hell, they ask Luke whose father was the only person to ever enter and escape unharmed. Luke provides them with a few items including a map that will reveal the entrance. All they need is to retrieve 3 pearls that will not only provide them the means of escape but illuminate the hidden locations on a map he provides.

The majority of the movie involves the journey these three take across the U.S. to find the clues to the gate as well as retrieve the pearls. These journeys bring them into contact with everything from a fire breathing Hydra to Medusa (Uma Thurman). Each of them develops not only individuals learning about themselves as they move forward, but as characters in the story as well.

Of course the journey doesn't always take them where they want nor are the results of the journey as they expect. But they do move forward, become heroes in their own right and finally have their confrontation with both the real lightning thief as well as the court of gods on Mount Olympus.

The most obvious attraction to this movie is the special effects and those in charge here have done a tremendous job. But one would expect no less from director Chris Columbus who brought us HOME ALONE and two of the Harry Potter films. Under his direction the film flows smoothly and you never once feel the need to check the clock to see how much more there is. You're left, instead, wanting more.

The young casts does a great job in each of their roles and the old pros do a fine job as well never hogging the stage from these upstarts. It would have been easy to do too, but instead they remain pros and allow the story to take center stage as well as these youngsters.

When released in theaters this film didn't do nearly as expected which is sad. One can only hope that they continue to film the other books in the series. Not only did it provide a nice family film that could be enjoyed, it also might serve to interests young people into looking deeper into the myths of ancient Greece which would possibly lead to more interest in learning. One can only hope.

While critics have felt the need to slam this film and call out what they think are shortcomings, I'd advise to give this one a look. You'll be entertained, have fun and perhaps remember those lessons learned years ago. And for young viewers, you'll perhaps pique an interest that you didn't realize you already had.",1277769600,,4640,4.498812351543943
4104179,2,B003AIL24C,"[WARNING:  Spoilers!]

Now, I haven't seen the DVD, itself, yet, but I did see this movie in the theaters.  Now, I realize that there do have to be changes between a book and its movie.  That's fine, but the changes to this completely changed the story, making any sequels virtually impossible.  The biggest problem I could see was changing the bad guy.  What is with Hollywood making Hades out to be the bad guy?  First, it was done by Disney's Hercules many years ago.  Now, it's this one, and they even did the same thing in the remake of Clash of the Titans.  What are they going to do with the final battle at the end of the series?  Will it be Hades, along with the Furies, against Olympus?  That wouldn't stand a chance.  Also, they messed up everything from the very beginning of the movie.  Having Zeus and Poseidon meet on the roof, and say they hadn't seen each other for a few years?  In Mythology, they met multiple times a year for the equinoxes and solstices, unless they were being petty about something, of course.

So, they combined Annabeth and Clarice, Hades and Cronus, and I thought there was another, but I've tried to blank as much of this horrid film from my mind as possible.  If the director/screenplay author had at least looked at the mythology that these books were based on, it might have been better, even with combining some characters, but the main enemy still should not have been changed.

I've seen some people compare this to the Harry Potter books, and that's fine.  They had to cut parts there, too, but not the extremely important parts.  This movie was more like the Eragon movie, in that the changes made were bad changes.",1277683200,3,1665,4.526845637583893

However, one change altered the fundamental meaning in a terrible way--moving this story away from a meaningful fairy tale into a Hollywood picture with a simple happy ending and no heartbreaking sacrifices.

I had encouraged my oldest daughter, 9, to read them, but she has just started the Warrior series, and wasn't interested, but did want to see the movie. I took her and my 7 year old. I was very disappointed that it differed so much from the books, but tried to look at it as a totally separate thing. Neither of my daughters had read the books, but they really loved the movie. Looking at it as just a movie, it was a good, fun adventure. And after seeing the movie, both girls were interested in reading the books, which is always a positive. It has become part of our bedtime routine, for me to read one chapter out loud to them both. We're now on the 4th book, and they are loving it. My oldest daughter also takes each book when we're done, and re-reads it. Even knowing the differences in the books vs. movie, she still wants to watch the movie again. It IS a good movie, it's just completely different from the first book.

4104182,1,B003AIL24C,"My son talked me into reading these books with him, and we loved them.
When we went to see the new Harry Potter movie, scenes for it came on during the trailers.

He recognized the story the second the preview started.  He was thrilled, and so was I.  What potential this unique and fun series had for a movie--or movies...I mean, they advertised that it was being brought to us by the people who make the Harry Potter movies.

The Potter movies stay so true to the book--taking care to absolutely keep things in the screenplay that are necessary to the plot line.

I wish I could say the same for this movie.

When it finally came out, we went to a movie theater in NJ that was right across the river from NYC.
We could see the Empire State building from the theater parking lot, and took it as a sign that the movie was going to rock.  We were so psyched to see it.

When we left the theater, I thought my son was going to cry, and I couldn't un-scrunch my eyebrows--huh?? I felt so bad for him, for me, for Rick Riordan...

We understand that it's impossible to make a movie exactly like a book-- but this was a travesty.
Every important aspect of the story was by-passed for the sake of special effects.

It's almost as if the screenwriter had been given a verbal summary of what the book was about, and took it from there. So many important plot points were left out or down right changed to the point that it would be impossible to even think about a sequel.

It's such a shame.  These stories have the ""book made to movie"" potential of the Potter series, or dare I say, a kids ""Lord of the Rings"".

If someone with vision had just read the books, the money used to make it could have been so much better spent.

He's so hot when he's wet!"" was the first thing I heard from the squealing 13 year old girl seated next to me as this movie started in the theater, and yes, Percy Jackson (the son of Poseidon) was frequently wet throughout this movie.  I also heard other variations on this exclamation, ranging from ""He's so hot when he sweats"" to ""He's even hot when he bleeds!"" and although I agreed wholeheartedly with the young lady to my left, this movie has a lot more going for it than the fantastic eye candy that is Logan Lerman.

The movie is a great adventure filled with plenty of suspense and cleaver and funny dialogue.  It also includes one of my favorite scenes in a movie released within the last five years, which I will only describe with the words ""Poker Face"" so as not to spoil it for any new viewers.

Yes, there are a several over-the-top or wooden performances from a few of the adult actors (Pierce Brosnan, coming off as more of a creepy child molester than the Dumbledore-like figure of wisdom and guidance he hopes to be) but the young actors playing Percy, Grover, Annabeth and Luke were fantastic in their roles.

This movie was so much fun; I wound up seeing it 4 times in the theater with a friend of mine who also fell in love with it.  I had never read the books before, but I am grateful to this movie for inspiring me to read the Percy Jackson series, which is better quality than the film.

The book did a nice adaption of the Olympic Gods to the Western world/culture, but the movie just does not have the charming details or great character build up that the book has.  Pierce Brosnan looked and acted like he wished he were elsewhere.

4104187,5,B003AIL24C,"Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief is a film that's overflowing with character vigor and spectacular direction.

Percy Jackson is your regular teenager who doesn't think much of himself, except for the fact that he's got an uncanny ability to remain under water for extended periods of time. During a class field trip, Percy is confronted by his first real monster, and it has nothing to do with high school drama. This monster's a real fiend - literally. After finding out that it was after him because he had been accused of stealing Zeus's master lightning bolt, Percy begins a journey toward understanding his true identity; he's a demigod - his mother is a mortal and his father is Poseidon, ancient Greek god of the seas.  As the film progresses, Percy takes on a personal quest to clear his name from charges of being the lightning thief. But more importantly, Percy begins the quest in order to save his mother from the treacherous clutches of the evil Hades. What is ensues is both surprising and enjoyable.

I am a fan of Chris Columbus' work and believe that he excels at creating a world that's both believable but also just whimsical enough to make the content seem truly plausible. He knows how to develop a character. He knows how to set the scene. And what he does with this film I am prepared to claim could not have been achieved by just any other director.

I applaud the casting. Logan Lerman does a fantastic job carrying the title role unflinchingly. Lerman's Percy is both charismatic and relatable, making him seem like a good friend. I laughed a great deal at his interaction with the other characters - they all pulled it off without seeming like they were trying. While kids films (though I would not be quick to call this one of them, but for the sake of Percy's rep, let's go with that) are notorious for their lacking scripts, they do a wonderful job of keeping the dialogue interesting and convincing. Also, Jake Abel as Luke and Steve Coogan as Hades threw a lot of great variety into the mix.

I know there's a lot of controversy about the book vs. film debate. I went in without having ever read the book. Independent of the novel, this film carries a different motivation and target audience but they both have a similar energy - an emotional but still good-humored journey. I would mentally separate the book from the movie before heading off to see this.

Don't let the lack of promotion discourage you from giving it a chance. Even before it was over, I had already begun wondering when it would be out on DVD. I actually ended up seeing this film several different times. This film left me smiling and wondering just how many demigods live in my neighborhood. 5/5",1275004800,,2720,4.632780082987552

Rick Riordon did an amazing job of creating Percy's world.  The way he bounced myths and legends off of each other made me feel like I was coming home to a place I already knew.  It didn't take us long to read all five books in the series.

The movie was an excellent adaptation of the first book.  Although there were many differences, I felt they did a good enough job that the differences were not disappointing.

4104197,5,B003AIL24C,"First off let me just say that I have read all 5 books at least twice through. I am an avid fan of this series. I was looking forward to this movie for quite a while. Of course this takes the course that many book adaptions take. That is, it differs from the book in many ways. Personally, I went to the midnight showing of this film expecting the differences, and went with an open mind to the idea of differences. And you know what? I immensely enjoyed this film! First, let me run down some differences between the book and film.

Unless you've read the book and don't mind finding out what was cut and changed, consider this your SPOILER ALERT!

First and most obviously, the ages of the actors. They are all in their late teens, whereas the kids in the book are 12.

Second, no Ares, Clarisse, or Dionysus. The fight for the Lightning Bolt is with Luke instead of Ares. And Annabeth takes on the role of the warrior girl in the movie.

Third, instead of a quest, Percy Grover and Annabeth just ditch camp to get the lightning bolt and save Percy's mother.

Fourth, NO PROPHECY. No mention of Thalia or the Big Three pact. I hope they mention it in The Sea of Monsters if they make it.

Those are the 4 biggest changes I remember from the movie and biggest complaints from avid fans. Logan Lerman (Percy), Alexandra Daddario (Annabeth), Brandon T Jackson (Grover), and Jake Abel (Luke) are all great actors. I hadn't really heard of them until The Lightning Thief. But they are terrific actors! Brandon is hilarious as Grover, and makes tons of jokes as the comic relief. Some may find his constant cracking of joke irritating, but in the right mood he's hilarious.

Sean Bean, and Kevin Mckidd are great as Zeus and Poseidon respectively. They're not in it very much, but Mr. Mckidd's entrance in the beginning of the film is awesome. I won't reveal more, but he's the first we see in the film.

And lets not forget Uma Thurman as Medusa! She was brilliantly done, and was very spooky and awesome. If you've read the book you know she dies, but I wish they would find a way to bring back Medusa because Uma Thurman was brilliant!

All in all, this was an amazing film, and I look forward to the deleted scenes included with the Blu-Ray release, because only 5 out of 10 scenes are on the DVD release. Plus, the Blu-Ray comes with a DVD and a code for a free copy on iTunes, which is brilliant. So this is a great film for the whole family, and I know I will be headed to the store to get it after it's release.

4104200,2,B003AIL24C,"I've read all the books and thoroughly enjoyed them. Then I went to see the movie and was thoroughly disappointed. Although the most basic elements are there--Percy is a son of Poseidon, he's accused of stealing Zeus' master bolt and has to return it, his friends are Annabeth and Grover--that's about all they took from the book. About every other minute, I kept yelling (in my head) one of two things: ""That NEVER happened!!"" and ""That event did NOT happen that way AT ALL!!"" They left out about 90% of what happened in the book and changed virtually EVERYTHING that happened.

Differences between the book and movie (SPOILER ALERT!! DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE YET!):
* I think this is an important point: In the book, Percy is only 12 years old. In the movie, he looks about 15 or 16. I think this will create big problems later on, if they decide to make more PJ movies because there's a prophecy about Percy and his 16th birthday.
* In the book, Chiron was the one who sent them on the quest. In the movie, they sneak out against his orders.
* In the book, during capture the flag, Percy is not the one who finds the other team's flag and does NOT battle Annabeth. He fights Clarisse as a distraction so that Luke can grab the flag. In the movie, Clarisse is completely absent.
* In the book, the bus blows up after the 3 furies attack them. This is completely removed in the movie, though they did take a bus, but nothing happened.
* In the book, they're lured to Aunty Em's Gnome Emporium from hunger. There, Aunty Em feeds them burgers & fries. When Medusa attacks, it's Grover who wears the flying shoes and attacks her from the air. Then Percy sends Medusa's head in a package to Olympus. In the movie, no eating, Medusa's victim turns to stone while holding Annabeth's wrist, and the kids keep the head and are forced to leave a motel when a housekeeper sees Grover holding it.
* The Lotus Casino scene: In the movie, there's no hotel room and they are given lotus-shaped snacks that make them forget about the quest. In the book, no lotus snacks, there were more games appropriate to their age (instead of gambling), Grover's never surrounded by all those women, and they NEVER stole a fancy car!
* In the movie, the quest involves collecting 3 pearls from various places. In the book, they never went to any of those places and Percy was given the pearls by a naiad.
* In the book, there's a very important meeting and later a battle between Percy and Ares, god of War. In the movie, Ares isn't even mentioned, let alone present.
* In the book, Luke doesn't reveal his betrayal until the very end. He leaves Percy to be poisoned by a scorpion, the two never having actually battled each other, as in the movie.
* In the book, the master bolt appears magically in a backpack given to Percy by Ares. It was not hidden in the shield (which Luke never gave them, but which they acquired on a mini-quest assigned by Ares), as it did in the movie.
* In the book, Hades' helm of Darkness is also stolen by Luke along with Zeus' master bolt. In the movie, nothing is mentioned about the helm.
* In the book, it's Percy's mother who has to stay with Hades whereas in the movie, Grover volunteers to stay with him so that Percy can have his mother back.
* Probably most importantly, I don't remember Kronos ever being mentioned in the movie (since I only could only stand to see it once), whereas Kronos is the most crucial player in the entire story since he's the one that started the whole chain of events--and, in later books, becomes the main antagonist.
* There are many other smaller differences as well, such as when Percy arrives at Camp Half-Blood, he doesn't go straight to the Poseidon cabin, since he's ""undetermined"" and isn't revealed as a son of Poseidon until after the capture-the-flag game. The camp itself looks nothing like it's described in the book, the gods don't appear as they are described in the book, and even Annabeth is written as a blond, not a brunette.

Long story short, if you've read the book, you'll likely be disappointed by the movie. If you haven't, then the movie will probably be OK, though it won't knock your socks off.",1271030400,35,4182,4.465359477124183
4104201,4,B003AIL24C,"I'm going to start this review by saying, yes, I did read the book.

I went into this movie with one of my guy friends, and I wasn't expecting much. I read the book when I was twelve, and I vaguely remember enjoying it. I was pleasantly surprised. The movie was pretty entertaining, not too cheesy or predictable, and I loved the mythology that was tied in with it. After seeing the movie I went back and read the book again. There were a lot of differences from the book. The movie appears to have been made to target teens, and I'd recommend it for teens. It was a fun movie.

I also recommend reading the book (either before or after seeing the movie). Even re-reading the book (at 17), I enjoyed it. It was quick and light and funny at times. Overall and easy/fun read.",1270598400,40,773,4.287671232876712

4104203,3,B003AIL24C,"Yet another adaptation of fantasy novel, ""Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief"" is pretty decent as mindless entertainment, but still a slight disappointment, considering the film is helmed by Chris Columbus, director of the first two installments of ""Harry Potter"" franchise. ""Percy Jackson"" is nice to look at (with Uma Thurman as campy snake-headed Medusa), but it lacks something that makes a truly thrilling adventure tale.

Gods and goddesses of Greek mythology really live. The film's story is set in today's America, where an ordinary high school boy Percy Jackson (Logan Lerman), who is actually son of Poseidon, is accused of stealing the lightning bolt of Zeus (Sean Bean). Percy doesn't know anything about the theft. In fact, he didn't know anything about his lineage until he is attacked by a winged creature and is saved by his best friend Grover (Brandon T. Jackson) and mysterious teacher Mr. Brunner (Pierce Brosnan).

The setting is unique (I like Mick Jagger-ish Hades played by Steve Coogan), and the special effects are reasonable, but you may not find wisecracking Grover very funny. I haven't read the original books by Rick Riordan, but even so, I can see considerable changes have been done to the source material. The story and the character development both are weak and underwritten. So what does Percy really want to do, save the world or his mother? What is the point of stealing Zeus's lightning in the first place?

The two-hour film, of which script is unfocused at best, fails to build up the necessary tension that is essential to the storyline. The film has interesting fantasy elements - Zeus' warning on global-scale war, romance of Percy's mother, Percy's potential as a demigod - but none of them really rings true. ""Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief"" is a fairly enjoyable, but a little disappointing, adventure movie.",1268524800,,1891,5.05448717948718
4104204,3,B003AIL24C,"Percy (Perseus, get it?) is a teenager with a goofy sidekick, listens to music while his teachers lecture, a bit arrogant and know-it-all, who thinks his mom married badly (at least he's right about the bald drunk for a step-father) and leads the usual high schooler's life.  Example:  He walks down the hall of his school with a fight or two happening in the background, and his crutched friend and himself are casually going down the hall chatting.

His mother and he live in a run-down apartment where she brings beer on command when her husband asks for it.  Wow, I'm marrying this gal!  The bum husband is not developed very well in the story and is in purely as a plot device.  Later in the film the relationship is further developed but predictable and silly.  Holy Mount Olympus!

Meantime, back at the skyscraper (long story) Zeus and Poseidon (the king of the gods and the king of the sea, respectively) get angry with each other when Zeus accuses Poseidon's son (hey, Percy!) with stealing Zeus's source of power: a lightning bolt.  Pose has until the summer solstice to find out what's happening or else get the consequences.

I mean, really now!  What proof?  Never explained.  Why does Poseidon walk in plain sight of everyone when he changes to human form?  Not explained.  So far so hole-ish....  :P

After a particularly silly scene where Percy is learning about the Greeks in a museum but not paying attention with the ear buds from his iPod.  Gee, the irony.

Then the magic happens.  His English teacher with the pinched face turns into a Harpy and demands the bolt.  I mean, you always knew your teachers were harpies, right?

Pierce Brosnon is a guy in a wheelchair doing the Greek lecturing.  (Spoiler) we learn later that Pearce's character is really a centaur (half man, half horse) with the usual jokes of being a horse's ass.  (No, I'm not making this up).  (End spoiler)

The inevitable mom gets kidnapped to Hell and Percy's quest, with the help of the daughter of Athena (who he sort of loves) and his crutched friend who turns out to be a satyr (mild sex jokes here) and they're off.

If you know your Greek mythology you will be mildly insulted.  If you just want to watch a show of teenagers on a quest to deal with the devil, then you might enjoy a Friday night rental.

The Medusa effects are interesting, turning people into stone.  But why did that woman grab Athena's daughter and bring her before Medusa only to herself turn into stone??  Sorry, thinking too much.  :P

The original Perseus vanquished Medusa and was the son of Zeus, but the film did not pretend to be faithful to the Greek myths.  There are some scenes where the sons and daughters of these mortal/immortal unions were at Camp Half-blood (very ""potter"" like) where they train all day and fight all day.  No explanation as to why or for what purpose they train.  They just like to have a boot camp for these kids I guess.

The whole film plods on and on like this.  From what I understand the film is based on a series of four books by Rick Riordan.  I may pick up these young adult novels to see what the fuss is all about.

Director Chris Columbus did a lot better with Harry Potter.  ""Percy Jackson"" has a lot of plot holes, very derivative and predictable storylines, subplots that make no sense, and leaves many unanswered questions.

I'm hoping the books make more sense, but in my book, ""Percy Jackson"" is a failed attempt at not only a decent book to film adaptation, but leaves little to the imagination, more special effects than a Michael Bay movie and not much else.

Better:

To sum it up it was extremely rushed mixed with horrible acting (main character is just bad) and horrible directing.

Example?

Don't need one. Watch it yourself and you'll either see it or you don't. If you don't see it and you think this movie is awesome than good for you, I'm just glad I can see. Thank god I didn't watch this in the theater, movies like these are just asking for.

Predictable, corny, typical. Like always I'm expecting major disagreement but it's okay. 95% of the population doesn't know whats good from bad, I just hope one in ten of you find some sort of agreement. This movie is BAD.",1267833600,9,839,4.2578616352201255
4104206,1,B003AIL24C,"Pros:  One or two redeeming acting performances, decent special effects.

Cons:  Bad casting, failure to bring the world to life, lack of creativity, complete failure to capture either the tone or the characters from the book.

Percy Jackson and his friends are racing to the underworld, desperate to get the lightning bolt in time.  As they reach Hades' residence, they are greeted by Persephone, wearing a ripped black lace, cleavage baring dress.  They ask to see Hades, but Persephone makes a few suggestive remarks and then thrusts her breasts into Grover's face.

""I've never had a satyr ...(long pause) ... visit before,"" she purrs in a Spanish accent.

Grover (who has already been established as sex obsessed) is appreciative.

If this sounds like a scene that would remotely fit in with your concept of the first Percy Jackson book, then you might enjoy this movie.  If not, then stay away, because it's pretty well a snapshot of the movie as a whole.

They went for a more mature feel for the movie - not just the characters' ages, but the content reflects this.  The casting for this movie was completely wrong.  It wasn't that the acting was bad, exactly, it was just that some of the actors were completely inappropriate for the parts they were playing.  Grover is not a smooth talking, wise cracking, confident character.  Sure, the guy playing him was funny, but he wasn't Grover.  Annabeth was an even worse failure.  They kept telling us that she was smart, the daughter of Athena, etc., but we don't actually get many instances of her acting smart.  Instead, she seems like a generic tough, sexy action girl.  In fact, every female character in this movie (with the exception of the mothers) is sexualized - Annabeth, the women at the Lotus Casino, the Aphrodite girls, Medusa (who is supposed to be ugly), Persephone.  Female characters that could not be turned into sexy girls (like Clarisse) are cut from the movie altogether.  It isn't that I have a problem with action movies that are about smashing heads and meeting beautiful women, it's just that this is so not what the Percy Jackson series is about.

By making this movie about the action, the creators have really undersold the wonder and magic of this series.  I'm not a person who believes that a movie must mimic a book exactly, but there are so many missed opportunities here dealing with setting alone.  For example, in the books each of the Olympian gods has a unique throne - Poseidon's is a fishing chair.  This is something that could have been a great visual for the movie and could have been played up even more - instead the movie opts for identical marble thrones.  In Camp Halfblood, we get generic military setting instead of the unique cabins and campers.  In the Underworld, we get a generic hell instead of great details like the EZ Death line and the burnt out fields of Asphodel.  Generic is the best word to describe this movie.

There were a few good points.  The kid who played Percy Jackson really captured that character's impulsiveness and good heart despite being way too old for the role.  The special effects were okay.  Not great, but okay.

You might be wondering if this movie would be good to someone who has never read the books.  The answer is no.  It might not be such a huge disappointment, but it is still nothing more than a below average action flick.

I tried to decide if the few points of light were enough to give this movie two stars.  I concluded that they weren't, because not only does this movie suck, but it completely ruins any chance for a decent series.  If they make another Percy Jackson movie, then it will have to move away from this one completely to be any good.  1+ stars.",1267660800,117,3712,4.661016949152542
4104207,3,B003AIL24C,"I have read all the books and enjoyed them very much.  I was anxious to see the movie.  It wasn't horrible, but I have to say I was a bit disappointed. Here is a list of some of the things I didn't care for:

- Percy was older than he was in the book, so where does that leave him to go as the series continues?
- Barely any mention of Kronos, who is the actual antagonist of the series
- The whole St. Louis scene was left out, moved to Nashville.  Having Percy control the Mississippi River rather than water out of drinking fountains would have been so much better.
- Medusa was so UGLY she turned people to stone when they looked at her.  In the movie she was awfully pretty with the exception of her hair.
- The movie lacked the banter, insults and sarcasm that made the book so much fun. The movie was almost too serious.
- Aries, Aphrodite and Hermes were left out altogether.  \
- Percy's sword was just a sword where as in the book it was almost a living entity with a name.  It was explained that no matter what happened to it, the sword would reappear in his pocket when he needed it.
- There was no connection between Annabeth and Luke as there was in the book.  This connection also plays an important part in the rest of the series.

But I said the movie wasn't horrible and here is what I liked:

- The guy playing Percy, although too old, did a good job.
- Grover was great.
- Most of the mythical creatures were very well done and the explanations for them were also good.
- Most of the fight scenes were very exciting
- The gods were portrayed well and of course they have the obligatory British accents.

4104209,4,B003AIL24C,"The 'Thief' enters a tough market: expectations have been set by a series of truly outstanding fantasy movies over the last few years, including others that focus on the education of the teenaged protagonist. Few movies from any era can hold their own against some of those modern classics. So, in fairness to this movie, I address it in its own terms only.

On the whole, those are pretty good terms. It delivers a wicked stepfather we love to hate, a chaste bit of teen romance with a decidedly un-wimpy female character, good effects (esp. faun and centaur), and exciting adventure. Things have been toned down a bit, for example around the bloodlessness of the fight scenes. I read that as an appeal to a younger, more skittish viewing audience than as real weakness, however. And, although I'm not up on the Greek myths to which it refers, I'm told that it stays close to the classics even when they aren't referenced explicitly. My brother, who had the old stories more freshly in mind, said that the movie's faithfulness to the classics actually made it predictable in a few places. My own objections tend to the more mundane, like wouldn't it raise a few eyebrows to see vast stone sculptures appear overnight in public places? Well, part of the appeal of teen movies lies in the stupidity of the adults involved.

Hardly the epic that some viewers seem to expect, this is still a fine bit of popcorn entertainment. It treats the old stories with reasonable respect while rising to high standards of modern moviemaking. Even if it's not one to remember ten years from now (or even one, maybe), it's easy to enjoy in itself.

4104210,2,B003AIL24C,"Percy Jackson is about a 12-year-old schoolboy who discovers to be a demi-god, grows up with his equally aged friends in Camp Halfblood and explores his origins deeply rooted in ancient Greek mythology...Oh wait, this has to be another story...

The Percy Jackson of this let-down of a movie is 18 years old and discovers that his uncle is Sean Bean, who pretends to be the almighty Zeus at a costume party highly reminiscent of an episode of the original ""Star Trek"" series called ""Who Mourns for Adonis"". This Percy Jackson drives his car around the States, falls in love with some arrogant brunette chick for some inexplicable reason called Annabeth Chase and has to discover that his second-favourite James Bond actor has grown horsebuns...

Seriously, this movie is nothing but a very sad travesty. The very basic, educational storyline and dialogues would have perfectly fitted with a children's movie, but no, they had to turn Percy Jackson into some weird action flick for young adults. The acting is throughout mediocre, the script lacks any depth and the directing is uninspired and bloodless. Even the costumes and sets look cheap as out of a 90s TV show.

Agreed. The CGI looks okay and the score by Christophe Beck is a masterpiece, but the rest of that movie simply lacks any coherence or aesthetic appeal.

I guess the only way to save this story would be to reboot is right away with some talented 13-year-old actors doing the book some justice.

 Now, I can't make this a really good, informative review without spoilers, because....
 DIFFERENCES FROM THE BOOK; (this may be pretty cryptic if you haven't read the book)
 As I'm sure most people who saw the preview noticed, the kids are in their late teens instead of pre-teens. However, the movie still was made as though for younger teens and kids.
 The relationship between Percy and Annabeth was ruined. Yeah it was turned into a sorta romance, with Annabeth being a ridiculously stereotypical 'tough' female who's always second best to the male characters and has a crush on Percy even though she pretends to hate him.
 The water park scene was left out. So was the scene where they're attacked by monsters on the bus. So was the fight with the monsters on the bridge!
 Instead of the plot being the kids trying to get safely to LA, it was them trying to get safely to LA and find the pearls in different places. In the book the pearls aren't made a big deal of.
 The Medusa head; oh, oh. This is a PG movie. I don't see why a severed head, sometimes with it's eyes open, had to be flaunted for the camera every five seconds. In a scene never in the book, they fight a hydra, and win by turning it to stone. They also have to flee a hotel because someone sees it. Grover kisses the thing after it kills the hydra. And it isn't ever sent to Mt. Olympus. Nor does it quite play the same part at the end; instead Gabe opens the fridge and finds it (which is during the credits). Medusa's character is also nothing like in the book.
  Instead of the villain being who it is in the book, it's Hades. How stereotypical and expected is that? The underworld in the book follows mythology well; in the movie it's just shown as being hell. Uncreative! In the movie we meet Persephone, who we are given to understand hates Hades, hates the underworld, and is desperate for sex with people other than her husband. Chiron wasn't funny like in the book; obviously Hades wasn't anything like in the book. The dog didn't have a part at all - no, we didn't get to see a three headed dog play fetch! The way Riordan wrote about the underworld was so original and entertaining; the movie just presented an un-educated stereotype.
  Percy doesn't encounter the bullies at the camp, nor is there the awesome exploding toilet scene.
  We never meet the guy who is responsible, in the book, for having the lightening stolen.
  We are given to understand that the kid who stole the lightening for Hades did so because his father, a god, never paid attention to him. In the movie, the gods are forbidden to have anything to do with their offspring, unlike the book. The whole `big three' and the results of them having children is never mentioned.
  The showdown at the end is between Percy and Luke. The titan is never mentioned.
  Instead of Percy's mom staying behind, and being freed because of Percy recovering the helmet, Grover stays behind, and is magically released by Zeus.
  The reason this is getting a 3 star rating is because the casting was mostly good, the acting also mostly good, and the action was very exciting. I wouldn't bring a young child to see this - It wasn't the scary images that surprised me as the fact that there were so MANY scary scenes. For teens and adults, I think these just add to the excitement of the movie, but if you don't like intense scenes, be warned. And again I think some of these scenes, especially the severed head, would be very, very frightening to some children. Despite this, the script was written as though aimed at pre-teens.

8392992,2,B003AIL24C,"It's OK if you're a kid. Probably would need to be a little kid. Probably only a little kid would enjoy jokes like the idea that Percy's mother married a really smelly jerk to protect her son, so evil people wouldn't be able to smell her demigod son's blood. Huh? There are some usually good actors in this film, but on the whole the acting is abysmal. Not a convincing word in the whole movie. What happened Sean Bean? And the rest of you!

So, I'd advise you to skip it unless you have little kids.",1526860800,,500,4.208333333333333
8392993,2,B003AIL24C,"This is a good movie - if you don't compare it to the book. The only things in common with the movie are pretty much the title, the character names, and the fact that they are demi-gods.",1526688000,,186,4.054054054054054
