The main word here is: Scenery. Just awesome - especially in Winterhawk. Great panoramic cinematography of it's day...capturing wild Montana. Some terrific winter scenes too.
These Charles B.Pearce films were lovingly made, and well cast with strong performances. The trustworthy character actors you will find familiar. In fact, both movies benefit from the absence of big name star power. And I've got to say - Winterhawk's horse should have been up for an Oscar! That spotted steed was kinda whack - putting on a show performance as if it knew it was in the movies. Come to think of it, I'm certain he is also Grayeagle's horse in the other movie here.
Both films are presented in the correct 2:35:1 aspect - and DTS-HD Master Audio Mono. I am not a technician, but there are a few minor transfer/master hiccups here and there - but nothing to spoil your enjoyment of these lost classics. Movies of this genre...and as obscure as this...will never receive a Godfather series-like restoration...this is as good as it will ever get for these two films. I'm glad they are finally here in Blu-ray.
If you are seeking critically-sound, and politically correct movies, well...the cheese is strong here. In keeping with their era, they do have some mid-1970's film-making  flavour. It was of course a different era of First Nations portrayal. But I would say these two films were respectful as possible of that time. Even ahead of their time in that regard. I recall much worse. But we do see Caucasians playing natives in a few bad wigs. Stunt doubles who don't resemble anyone...anywhere. The kidnapped ladies in both films have an endless supply of make-up and hair products at their disposal within the deep wilderness. A couple brief & minor nits like: visible power lines, and distant automobiles. And a few hayfields freshly cut by 20th Century swathers...
But hey - it's all good! Nothing that will spoil your enjoyment of either movie.
Both films offer strong-silent type-mysterious lead characters. And both romances are somewhat understated, which is also appreciated.
If you like westerns and frontier movies - you will love these films and their unique portrayal of Native Americans. Enjoy!",1462060800,6,2295,4.961038961038961

Charles Pierce was a visionary and had a magnificent eye for scenery and landscape beauty. He definitely showed his talent in these movies. Especially for me, Michael Dante's wife, I know that Michael Dante  played Winterhawk as a spiritual man, making decisions from his heart. The leader of a nation has tough decisions to make and he used his inner spirit as well as his strength to guide his way. Michael Dante has written the sequel to Winterhawk, 'Winterhawk's Land' that will be released in 2017.

7597125,5,B01AB4Y6Z4,"The quality of these movies is fantastic. Both are filmed outdoors and the scenery is beautiful. My biggest concern was about the musical score for Winterhawk. The VHS version has a terrible piano score which was not the original music that played in theaters. Thank goodness it is not only a sharp remastered color print, but the music and original score of the  Winterhawk theme are on the new Blu-ray version. Grayeagle has been available on DVD for awhile, and it is also a pristine remastered color copy. I enjoyed both these very well done westerns.",1462492800,5,555,4.78125

8746894,4,B01AB4Y6Z4,"GRAYEAGLE

Released in 1977, ""Grayeagle"" is a Western about a man (Ben Johnson) whose daughter (Lana Wood) is kidnapped by a Cheyenne brave (Alex Cord). The man teams up with his Native partner (Iron Eyes Cody) and a friend (Jack Elam) to get his daughter back. Along the way they must tangle with a Shoshone hunting party, including a crazy brave named Scar (Jacob Daniels).

While the plot is reminiscent of 1956's ""The Searchers,"" it's different enough to not be a rip-off. ""Grayeagle"" is not a big-budget Western, like ""The Searchers,"" but I like it better. However, it's not a cheapie either and it genuinely surprised me for a number of reasons. For one, it's not a typical Western; it's just as much a Native American film as it is a cowboy Western; and the Natives are portrayed quite good, considering the time period. Secondly, everything about the film is totally over-the-top, like the acting, the (melo)drama and the blaring score. Speaking of the score, it plays like the bombastic music of the original Star Trek TV series, but updated to the mid-70s and fitted for a Western. It's quite good -- sometimes even moving -- albeit decidedly dated.

The plot similarities to ""The Searchers"" is interesting in that Lana Wood's sister, Natalie, played the kidnapped girl in that film. Speaking of Lana, she's just gorgeous. You might remember her as Bond girl Plenty O'Toole in 1971's ""Diamonds are Forever.""

Believe it or not, the annoying, half-crazy character Bugler was played by the director, Charles B. Pierce.

Shot in the Helena National Forest Northeast of Helena, Montana, the landscapes are picturesque.

FINAL WORD: ""Grayeagle"" is full of gusto and must be respected because the creators gave it their all to entertain the viewer; in fact, I include it on my hallowed ""Favorite Westerns"" list. However, the film is so overdone that it sometimes borders on ridiculous. So while it's often supremely entertaining the sacred words are fitting: ""Just because you like a movie doesn't mean it's good.""

The film runs 104 minutes.

GRADE: B

WINTERHAWK

RELEASED IN 1975 and written/directed by Charles Pierce, ""Winterhawk"" chronicles events in western Montana in the 1840s when small pox breaks out in a remote tribe of Blackfoot. The titular chief (Michael Dante) goes to the New Americans to apprehend a remedy, but things don't go well and a movie-length chase ensues. Dawn Wells from Gilligans Island plays the female lead while Leif Erickson plays a mountain man whos friends with the Blackfoot. Woody Strode, Denver Pyle, L.Q. Jones & Elisha Cook Jr. have peripheral roles.

While watching, I was reminded of 1977s Grayeagle and therefore wasn't surprised to discover that Pierce made both films. Grayeagle is superior, though, and it shows that Pierce learned a thing or two while making this one two years earlier.

The movie has its points of interest, like a notable cast, with great alpine locations and moments of aesthetic wonder. But its marred by a sometimes draggy vibe with overly syrupy moments and a blaring piano-oriented score that starts to grate due to its booming redundancy. Moreover, Winterhawk (the character) is depicted as excessively mysterious, noble and superhuman, not to mention more time needed spent on his group in the chase for the simple sake of human interest. If you can handle these cavils, however, this is a worthwhile Western.

Some have pointed out that Winterhawk is noteworthy because of its respectful view of Native Americans (who aren't really native since their ancestors emigrated from Asia), yet pro-Indian Westerns actually go back to Buffalo Bill (1944), Fort Apache (1948), Broken Arrow (1950) and The Last Wagon (1956), not to mention the more contemporaneous A Man Called Horse (1970) and I Will Fight No More Forever (1975).

THE FILM RUNS 98 minutes and was shot in Kalispell & Browning, Montana, and Durango & Silverton, Colorado.
