8454112,1,B0052PKIXC,"I wanted a good stretching video to work out tight muscles, as I've just started an intense cardio/strength program and need the stretching afterward.  This video is actually yoga, and not the relaxing kind.

There are a few relaxing poses, but also things like downward dog, and other moves that require you to be extremely flexible and strong already (walking your feet to your hands on the floor, bending knees all the way beneath you, etc).  Some of the movements can be intense.  I'm very disappointed, simply because the title/description doesn't accurately portray what you get.

Nothing against yoga, but if you're selling a yoga dvd, then title it appropriately.  If you name your dvd 'stretching,' I actually expect stretching, not active yoga!",1338595200,,754,5.0894308943089435
