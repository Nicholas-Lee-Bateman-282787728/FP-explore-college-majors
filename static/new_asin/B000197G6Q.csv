8008304,5,B000197G6Q,"It seems the older I get I suddenly get involved with books like ""Pride and Prejudice"" and will watch all movies (sometimes my eyes will not allow me to read books) by that author.  Now trains have arrived and I really enjoy taking these magical train rides from the comfort of my easy chair through a DVD.

I find watching and imagining I am on the train works for me.  This is sooo fun to do.

Who says you need a lot of money to retire..Just use your imagination and take a train ride with the help of this excellent product.",1332460800,2,528,4.198019801980198
