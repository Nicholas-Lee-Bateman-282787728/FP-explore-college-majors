7906530,5,B00000F2MX,"the ANIMATORS! What a great historical account. Wonderful older cartoons with real visual density to rival Disney, and even satirize them. Early use of the music of Scott Joplin before its popularization in the soundtrack score to ""The Sting"". Bob Clampett is featured as the main narrator, along with Tex Avery. Chuck Jones is not featured, partly because he was very modest, almost shy, about his work. Orson Welles' deep gravitas suits the mockumentary tone to a T. If you are an animation history buff, or just love good cartoons, this one is a rare CLASSIC. p.s. The Rhapsody Rabbit segment has influenced more than one youngster around the world to aspire to classical piano excellence. See Lang Lang's interview with Daniel Barenboim on D.B.'s Beethoven Master Classes DVD. (no kidding!)

7906531,5,B00000F2MX,"If you buy this only for the ""Rhapsody Rabbit"" cartoon, the purchase is worthwhile.  This setting for ""Hungarian Rhapsody"" by Liszt is extremely clever.  I always lose it when Bugs begins gets off the piano bench to pray when the sheet music shows difficult notes ahead.  My kids love it -- and so do I!",1180742400,,303,4.472727272727273
7906532,4,B00000F2MX,"This video is a very good look back at the old Warner Bros. Animation Studio.  I highly recommend it to anyone interested in Warner Bros. animation, especially those interested in the classic cartoons and their history.
The title of the video, however, is somewhat of a misnomer: the film is not entirely about Bugs Bunny, although he does get the most attention of the cartoon characters mentioned.  Instead, the film, which is narrated by Orson Welles and hosted by Bob Clampett, is more of Mr. Clampett's look back on the studio and the cartoons they made.
There are really good things to be said for this video.  It features some really interesting commentary by Mr. Clampett.  It also has some cool interviews with Tex Avery and Friz Freleng.  But, one of the greatest things about this video is that it contains entire cartoons!  Most other documentary films of this type contain only clips of the cartoons they mention, but this one features nine complete, six-to-seven-minute-long cartoons: What's Cookin', Doc?; A Wild Hare (which is generally considered Bugs' first cartoon); A Corny Concerto; I Taw a Putty Tat; Walky Talky Hawky; Rhapsody Rabbit; My Favorite Duck; Hair-Raising Hare; and Old Grey Hare.  Note that not all of these are Bugs Bunny cartoons because, as I have said, this video is not entirely about the rabbit.
On the down side, though, there were no interviews with Chuck Jones or Bob McKimson, the other two great directors of classic Warner Bros. cartoons.  The interviews with Mr. Clampett, Tex, and Friz were great, but I just can't consider a documentary like this complete without some input from Chuck and Mr. McKimson, which is why I give only 4 stars rather than a full 5.  But, on the whole, it's a great video and one that I highly recommend.",1015891200,26,1780,4.828947368421052
