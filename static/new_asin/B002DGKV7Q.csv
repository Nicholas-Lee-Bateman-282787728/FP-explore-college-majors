3910155,5,B002DGKV7Q,"Excellent illustration of how far removed Christianity has become from the teachings of Christ. Would love to see comments from the  fundamentalist crowd, but that will never happen.",1364947200,2,182,5.5
3910156,2,B002DGKV7Q,Not for the weak in Faith as satire can be very rough.  Jesus provides what we need through the Father and will use all things to the good of the Kingdom.  Self--reliance is good and we poor humans are need so much sometime that we need to be reminded that we can do most things on our own. Keep this in mind and don't belive everything on the internet,1361491200,2,352,4.086956521739131
3910157,5,B002DGKV7Q,"I thought this dvd was great! I laughed throughout the show. I liked how Troy threw in the ""power point"" presentation every so often. That was a great addition. I just wish I could see him live. If you can't get out to one of Troy's shows, get this dvd. You will laugh hard and hopefully learn some too.  The extra's on the dvd were great too!  I can't wait to see more of Troy's genius in the future. For atheist's and no atheist's alike.",1260057600,13,439,4.152941176470589
3910158,5,B002DGKV7Q,"Troy Conrad is a bright and witty comedian. Whether you're an Atheist or Christian, Troy will give you something to laugh about as well as ponder. Don't pass up ""The Comedy Jesus Show"". If you can't attend a live performance, then consider ordering this DVD. I will probably also purchase any other DVDs featuring Troy.",1258588800,5,319,4.818181818181818
3910159,3,B002DGKV7Q,"Basically what you get here is a half-hour stand-up routine and several bonus features.  The concept is great, and ""Jesus"" does a pretty good job.  I was entertained, but I felt like it was just scratching the surface of what can be done with this sort of material.  For instance, there was a clip where he went to New Life Church.  I was expecting some amusing hijinks, but they really didn't do all that much with it.  As soon as it started to get funny, they moved on to something else.  I felt the same way about some of the bonus features, especially the one with the minister who uses a banana to prove the existence of God.

The one thing that really got my attention was the preview for the feature movie that these guys are working on.  Hopefully they can do a little something more with it.

I also feel like this is probably more ideal for people who are currently struggling with their faith as opposed to somebody like me, who finally came to peace with my atheism several years ago.",1250294400,13,996,4.369565217391305

3910164,4,B002DGKV7Q,"As an atheist, I skimmed past this one because of the ratings. Then I watched it and felt bad for having done so. Comedy Jesus hits on a great many of my complaints about the Bible based world view more eloquently and certainly more humorously than do most of the people with whom I discuss this sort of thing.

And it kinda made me believe a bit more in Jesus. If Jesus said the things this guy said--which... he did--then I'd really have liked Jesus. It'd be nice if his followers today still thought the same thing.,",1455321600,,519,4.350515463917525
3910165,4,B002DGKV7Q,"All I can say is it was funny. Not the most professional thing I've watched but It had me laughing out loud to things that I am sure are going to get me a fst track to he$$ when the time comes. This is not for the evangelicals of Iowa, but for the rest of us sinners it was pretty darn funny.",1454976000,,292,3.725806451612903

3910168,5,B002DGKV7Q,Low budget fun. Not for someone easily offended. A good laugh for the not so religiously inclined.,1448064000,,98,4.823529411764706

3910170,4,B002DGKV7Q,"Very funny and actually very true. I can't give the show five stars because of the obscene language. However, the language is what made the film humorous too!",1445644800,,158,4.678571428571429
3910171,5,B002DGKV7Q,Funny! Gimme some more Amazon Prime!,1445472000,,36,5.166666666666667

3910176,5,B002DGKV7Q,"Fresh, enjoyable.  A tad dated, i.e. it is was apparently filmed when George W. was president.",1436572800,,94,4.875
3910177,1,B002DGKV7Q,Couldn't get through the first five minutes.,1432857600,,44,5.428571428571429
3910178,1,B002DGKV7Q,Made the mistake of thinking this was a religious comedian but unpleasantly surprised by vulgarity,1430697600,,98,5.6
3910179,5,B002DGKV7Q,right on,1428019200,,8,3.5
3910180,1,B002DGKV7Q,"Kind of skimmed through it. Nothing I saw was at all funny (and I should add that I'm not at all religious, since that seems to matter in reviews of this movie). I was prepared for that. What I wasn't prepared for was the way-over-the-top laughtrack over everything I landed on. Nothing makes unfunny even less funny than an obnoxious laughtrack. Wonder why I didn't see reviewers mentioning that.",1427241600,,397,4.768115942028985
3910181,2,B002DGKV7Q,Troy tries too hard and the comedy is lame. I'd hope for something better.,1426982400,,74,4.357142857142857
3910182,5,B002DGKV7Q,I think this is exactly what Jesus would say if he came back today. VERY funny.,1426032000,,79,4.0

3910184,3,B002DGKV7Q,Substance was good; delivery not very good.,1425945600,,43,5.285714285714286
3910185,3,B002DGKV7Q,It was just ok? I liked some of his lines but I didn't laugh out loud very much. I think I'm funnier most of the time.,1425513600,,118,3.576923076923077
3910186,5,B002DGKV7Q,This is so funny my ribs hurt.  If you like politics and religious humor together - this is definitely the cake you should have!,1424390400,,128,4.333333333333333
3910187,4,B002DGKV7Q,Jesus Christ! Very funny and on target. Not a criticism of Jesus. It is a criticism of what is done in his name under the pretext of religous guidance. Love the irreverence.,1420502400,,173,4.4375
3910188,4,B002DGKV7Q,I found this to be funny and on point.  More right wing people should not only watch this but really think about what is being said. There was a lot of truth in his comedy.,1419897600,,172,3.914285714285714
3910189,5,B002DGKV7Q,"Anything that blasts religion gets my vote. Really, this only deserves 4 stars, but I have to cancel out at least one of the 1 stars.",1419724800,,133,4.153846153846154
3910190,1,B002DGKV7Q,Ridiculous.  Not funny at all.  Very poor taste.,1418169600,,48,4.875
3910191,1,B002DGKV7Q,"I am a non-believer, but frankly this came off as juvenile. I felt like I was listening to a dude in a Jesus costume read his ideas for snarky comments on YouTube videos out loud. Really people, I think the whole obnoxious atheism is overdone. There are funnier ways to examine the absurdities of religion.",1417564800,,306,4.581818181818182
3910192,1,B002DGKV7Q,just plain sucked,1416873600,,17,5.0
3910193,5,B002DGKV7Q,"As far as I can tell if you're religious deep down in your heart you will likely be offended by this.  If, on the other hand, you are a rational philosophically inclined thinker who has spent at least enough time in America to understand the way in which religion particularly Christianity and the rest of what we do intersects you will find this act a cathartic experience.  Troy's act is really well done, and with humor combats the dogmatic hypocrisy we are all forced to deal with, whether honestly, or with eyes shut, ears blocked, and mouths muted.",1414627200,,554,4.642857142857143

3910196,5,B002DGKV7Q,"Oh man, just when I'm thinking of leaving, some guy comes and speaks my mind.  There a few truisms in this comedy act; ""Don't be a *BLEEP*"" and people will remember you for whether you were a *BLEEP* or not.  The other is that you have to be true to yourself.  It is a brilliant piece of comedy that had me laughing and cheering.  I'm just beaming with pride in a nation that can allow this guy do his bit without being dragged off by the religious police, or thrown in a dungeon, or otherwise mistreated by the government, for laying it on the line to people he need to be reminded that Jesus of some distant Roman provence, was not an American, did not speak English, taught some tenets that were more akin to the humanism of Krishna, and did not preach about a Thor nor Zeus like sky-god that was angry and jealous.

He hits on sexual themes, labor relations, government intervention, and personal attitudes regarding respect and perhaps a good regard for your fellow human being.

If I had one complaint, it's that it isn't long enough.  I might add that Troy Conrad could probably stand to add material to his act, and perhaps even let his hair and facial hair grow to actually assume a Jesus like appearance as he reminds folks, ""Hey!  Don't be a *BLEEP*""

Truly an entertainer who, if the dice roll right, will be big, or should be.  I hope he makes more videos of his act, and keeps adding material to it.  Outstanding stuff.",1410825600,3,1433,4.4106463878327
3910197,5,B002DGKV7Q,definitely worth watching.. it starts off little show and he makes great points and arguments while making you laugh.,1409356800,,117,5.2105263157894735
3910198,2,B002DGKV7Q,"I enjoy people poking fun at sacred cows, and I liked the idea of Jesus coming back as a comedian, but I found this a poor execution of a good idea..

I particularly dislike the quality of the audio, I seen better amateur video and audio production on YouTube.",1409356800,,260,4.3061224489795915
3910199,4,B002DGKV7Q,"Well of course this is irreverent.  And it's really funny.  I agree that it could have been better.  There's such great material here to work with.  He pulls some of the standard material, but also has some fun takes on being irreverent.  Look, if you're a super Christian, common sense should say this isn't for you.",1407196800,,317,4.589285714285714
3910200,5,B002DGKV7Q,"Smart, insightful, intelligent! Sometimes veers too much into religion-bashing, which I am NOT into because I'm a very spiritual person who has studied many religions. But if I can listen to and find something to respect about fundamentalists (or my stalkers, as this Jesus calls them), then I can certainly listen to atheist humor, especially when it's as humanitarian as this. Troy Conrad's message is very ethical and concerned for our best global survival, which is what the real nonpartisan God cares most about I would say!",1405987200,,529,5.091954022988506
3910201,1,B002DGKV7Q,Very anti Christians,1404518400,3,20,6.0
3910202,1,B002DGKV7Q,After about 10 minutes of watching he had one funny line.  He needs more than the shock factor of dressing like Jesus.  Not worth my time.,1402876800,2,138,4.269230769230769
3910203,1,B002DGKV7Q,"Sounds like listening to myself minus the profanity, and I am a Minister of the Bible.  Another big exception is he is completely and throughly wrong about the Bible being irrelevant.  The Bible tells the true stories extant throughout human history fraught with the Presence of GOD in the World, and HE who MADE IT!  But his criticisms of Religion are accurate and is the very feeling I get form reading the Gospels.  Jesus would be chagrined by what is being passed off as Religion.  Basically the Churches have become the modern version of the Medicine Shows of the 19th Century and Vaudeville of the late 19th and early 20th.  And the greatest sin is conformity and going along to get along!",1399161600,2,695,4.655737704918033
3910204,1,B002DGKV7Q,"Not very compelling, seems like he is trying very hard to be offensive.. Wasn't offended by the jokes but you could really tell that's what he was going for..",1395964800,2,158,4.482758620689655
3910205,5,B002DGKV7Q,"I thought this show was very funny and introspective but without offending people with true spiritual beliefs. If you're all about dogma though, you probably will feel offended. I like the comedic manner he makes fun of the absurd parts of religion, while also combining it with real world things happening today. Athesists and agnostics will appreciate this very much too. I also liked that he seemed in the moment...not flying high on something.... he seems to enjoy his are an have intelligence by making you laugh and think. I also like the way he flipped his hair.  I hope to see more as he evolves, haha- pun intended.",1392940800,6,624,4.724770642201835
3910206,4,B002DGKV7Q,"It's fun to laugh at what once was so clearly true, but actually isn't after the blinders are  removed. Definitely worth the 45 minutes, and you'll wish it were longer.",1392422400,2,168,4.6
3910207,1,B002DGKV7Q,"The show had a great opportunity for constructive humor and thought-out laughs, but they squandered it and embarrassed themselves by turning it into this product of petty bashing and superficiality. Sad.",1392249600,6,203,5.580645161290323
3910208,5,B002DGKV7Q,"He really puts religion into perspective, in a funny and human way. It's a unique routine. It really gets one thinking",1391731200,,118,4.666666666666667
3910209,5,B002DGKV7Q,"Incredibly funny, but not terribly irreverent.  It's one of the few comedy shows that I would watch over and over again.",1388188800,,120,4.714285714285714
3910210,1,B002DGKV7Q,"Poor quality video and really poor humor.  Not worth the energy turning this on.  This is what Jesus meant when he warned by a place of ""weeping and gnashing of teeth.""",1387238400,,168,4.387096774193548
3910211,1,B002DGKV7Q,extremely  boring....the stage setting . had funny moment s but overall not an attention sustainable comedy...two stars would mean I might watch again.,1387065600,,151,5.565217391304348

3910213,1,B002DGKV7Q,Had to turn it off. Unfortunately this guy must have been born without a conscious towards people of faith. When people reject Gods absolutes then they embrace their own just like Hitler. You don't offend your own creator without consequences.,1381708800,3,243,5.1
3910214,2,B002DGKV7Q,Long prerecorded video clips and super-long credits at the end do not add up to stand-up comedy. This is a joke worth flushing down the toilet.,1379808000,3,143,4.538461538461538
3910215,5,B002DGKV7Q,Hilarious.  A must see for any lover of Jesus or comedy.  Just about a 30 min. set with a funny old psa about obscenity that runs after the credits.,1368921600,,148,4.068965517241379
8365096,5,B002DGKV7Q,"This is actually really well done and funny! You should watch this it's good. The purpose is not put to down the idea of religion or jesus. This guy speaks as jesus who has come back to give some common sense advice about the bible, his message, life and death etc. It's a great concept that most people would avoid because of religious extremism; it's blasphemy. A lot of people do or say stupid things in the name of religion that's what this show is about.",1509408000,,459,4.348837209302325
