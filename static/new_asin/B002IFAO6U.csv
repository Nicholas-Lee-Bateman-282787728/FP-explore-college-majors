8370850,5,B002IFAO6U,I am a huge fan of Godzilla and the Heisei era of Godzilla films. This is the third entry and I enjoyed viewing it in its original Japanese format.,1364428800,,147,4.103448275862069
8370851,5,B002IFAO6U,For many years the only way I could see this film was on a double feature with King Ghidorah that was not only dubbed in english Horrifyingly but was also cut to an extent. Like the previous sequel this motion picture had the sound changed and the story changed. At last thanks to plenty of toys and Monsterisland.com this film has been restored to its own Glory. The sound  will place you in the middle of the action and before the film you get the trailor and after the film many scenes on the making of this classic that you will NOT find anywhere else on DVD in America or elsewhere. The ultimate copy and version of this Beloved New Classic. Toho Films Rocks!,1335398400,2,664,4.354838709677419
8370852,5,B002IFAO6U,what i like about this DVD is that it has deleted scenes and the making of the movie. And i think it's cool,1306540800,5,107,3.6956521739130435
