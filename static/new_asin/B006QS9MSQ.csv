8503154,5,B006QS9MSQ,"This is a touching and beautifully done video tribute to Jack Soo, who famously played Det. Sgt. Nick Yemana on the superb _Barney Miller_ television series. True to the video's title, we didn't know Jack!
We had no idea that Jack Soo (whose real name was Goro Suzuki) was such a wonderful singer, entertainer, and actor in his pre-Barney Miller days. What a beautiful voice he had! Among his major accomplishments was the lead in Rogers and Hammerstein's musical _Flower Drum Song_ (both the Broadway and film versions), and he co-stared in the 1960's television comedy _Valentine's Day_.  He was the first non-African American singer to be signed with Motown Records.  Jack refused to play roles that were demeaning to Asian Americans and often spoke out against negative ethnic portrayals.  His movie roles include _Thoroughly Modern Millie_, _The Green Berets_ (with John Wayne), and _Return from Witch Mountain_. He made lots of guests appearances in television shows like _M*A*S*H_, _The Odd Couple_, _The Jack Benny Show_, _The Jimmy Stewart Show_, _Hawaii Five-O_, _Police Story_, and _Ironside_ .  But for us, he'll always be Nick Yemana ... especially in the famous and hilarious ""brownies"" episode (""Hash""), which is ranked as one of the funniest 100 TV sitcom episodes of all time.  Anyway, if you love Barney Miller, this loving video tribute to Jack Soo is an absolute necessity.",1495238400,,1393,5.118942731277533
