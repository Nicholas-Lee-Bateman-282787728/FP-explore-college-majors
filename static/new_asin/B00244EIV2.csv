3843976,3,B00244EIV2,"very good into to this fabulous bird, but there is sooo much more of interest and detail.",1448236800,,89,4.294117647058823
3843977,5,B00244EIV2,A very endearing video! Full of detail and pretty amazing close-up moments. The quality of the recording is rather good totally captivated my 6- and 8-years-olds. One of them is doing a project on loons this semester and is planning to use some of these materials. Thank you for making this available!,1444003200,,301,4.8076923076923075
3843978,5,B00244EIV2,"We knew nothing about the loon, our bird acquaintances mostly limited to macaws and toucans when we lived in Brazil. This film was therefore highly informative for us as well as simply nice to watch. We even liked the music - usually, we hate the scores used in animal documentaries. Very pleasant, calming, a rare pleasure.",1430956800,,324,4.803571428571429
3843979,5,B00244EIV2,"One of my favorite birds, but hard to know, so this is pretty special, thanks George Harrison.",1430438400,,94,4.588235294117647
3843980,5,B00244EIV2,"Very informative piece on wildlife of the Loons. Well done, and generally educational to all ages. Picture quality was top grade,I only wish they used the theme song from the movie,On Golden Pond that would have made the relaxation part more soothing to enjoy.",1390521600,2,260,4.931818181818182
3843981,5,B00244EIV2,"Oh, my GOODNESS --- this nature documentary is one of the loveliest and best productions I've ever seen!!  It starts out with a breathtakingly and serenely beautiful scene of truly golden water (the sunlight is shining on the lake at just the right angle), and ends with the same.  The images of the loons are extremely sharp and clear and detailed (check out the great super-closeup shots!), with vivid and vibrant colors!  And the commentary is clear and informative, and read by a male narrator with a calm pleasant voice that makes this movie all the more of a joy to listen to!
The film is shown twice in succession --- first with the narration included, and then a second time without any talking: you see exactly the same pictorial content as the first time, but with a soundtrack of just the soul-satisfying music, loon calls, and the ""background"" nature sounds like songbirds chirping and water gurgling that were heard in the first, narrated version.  A first-rate job... highly, HIGHLY recommended!  A real treat for youngsters and grownups alike!",1284940800,2,1058,4.888268156424581

8350295,5,B00244EIV2,The photography was beautiful and the audio portion was spectacular. We have loons on our lake in Alabama from November 1 until mid-April so it was most appropriate. We intend to watch it again.,1461024000,,194,4.735294117647059
8350296,4,B00244EIV2,The birds themselves are enchanting I found this documentary well done. The message of threatened species and habitat must be heeded the loss of such beauty is tragic and being part of such ignorance should be unacceptable to every human on the planet,1459209600,,251,4.8604651162790695

8350300,1,B00244EIV2,Picture quality is on par with VHS tape. Looks very grainy on 75 in tv as compared with other DVDs. No landing scenes. Money wasted!,1452384000,,132,4.32
