7545060,5,B018ELUDKS,"I watch a lot of independent horror films, so I'm used to seeing a lot of lighting, sound, and story issues, but this film had none of those and far exceeds the expectation of a practically no-budget horror film. The twists and story are strong and intriguing. The character development is a selling point, and you can tell the writer/director thought through every aspect of the film. I could watch it over and over, and would likely continue to find nuggets of information that help me put the entire puzzle together. Well thought-out, profoundly written, and incredibly well put together. You won't regret this selection!",1457740800,2,624,4.9523809523809526
7545061,3,B018ELUDKS,"Bunni is a entertaining at times yet confusing slasher film. The director tries to mix an 80s nostalgia with a mindset of today. The story is simple enough, the film opens with a husband and wife fighting. It seems that the husband has been cheating on the wife with a stripper named Bunni. All the while these two are fighting, their little kid is listening. After this opening, the film fast forwards to a bunch of teens hanging out drinking. One of the characters notices an abandoned adult novelty store, and the group decide to go inside to check it out. Once inside this store, the kids realize they are not alone. Director Daniel Benedict is clearly a horror fan. There is a scene in the film when a couple is watching a video tape of a girl going torture porn on a guy, and it gets very graphic. The kills we get in the film are also very well done and extremely impressive considering the budget. Now, comes the part about the confusion. This film is really not sure what story it wants to tell. This film is so all over the map, that it was really hard at times to follow along. The pacing in this film really shows the weaknesses of what is in the heart of this film. It feels like the director just let this film go and wished for the best.

The film ends barely at the hour mark, then we fast forward another year to get more of the story that just feels such a convoluted mess. The second ending was such a cheap and wasteful way to think the audience would go along with it. Then, we go to the blooper reel, this is all before the film completely ends. It is like they were stretching to fill in time. My advice, you should have made the final sequence longer before the first ending. It felt so rushed, and just thrown together. The words had zero feeling and even less emotion. The first twist this film gave us, I felt it was smart and I was along with it. After the first kill, I was like,  this film is going to try and outsmart me on what this twist is. To its credit, it delivered a good first twist. The second twist that happens before the last kill, was so weak and just misused. Then, as the year later sequence is happening, we get to see that they had no idea how to use that second twist to its full potential. Again, this film has some great kills and at times a ton of heart. But, it also has a ton of problems and holes in its logic and story. I have to say though, the Bunni character,( while people will say it looks like a rip off of the Blood Work film.) I really dug her and wish she played a more vital part in this film and the way the story came across. I would say, for the kills I could maybe give it a slight recommend. This film though, if you took away the kills, ummmm. I am assuming we can get better as we make more films with more budgets.",1457049600,5,2788,4.142066420664206
7545082,1,B018ELUDKS,"Let me start by saying that I like many B-movies. Sometimes lack of a budget can force creativity... but not in this case. The writing was contrived and amateurish (not as in farcical, just plain bad). The acting was likewise so poor... how shall I put it... it was like a group of aliens who had no concept of how humans really talked and interacted wrote a script, and gave it to a second group of aliens who also had no concept of how humans really talked an interacted to act out. The cinematography was only slightly sub-par for B-movie standards, as were the effects. But the writing and acting were so agonizing, that it was just no fun to watch.",1470528000,,653,4.404958677685951

7545084,4,B018ELUDKS,"Great watch if you're into crazy and upbeat slashers. No one takes their roles too seriously, so it's pretty high-grade B movie grindhouse material, in my opinion.  While B grade movies are VERY hit or miss with me, they're among my favorites.

Dropped a star because the post credit scenario drags out longer than it should have. I'd still like to see the story continued.

Very good junk food movie! Enjoy for Halloween.",1470441600,,422,4.7534246575342465

7545102,1,B018ELUDKS,I was disappointed with the excessive use of motion cameras and extreme closeups. The plot didn't really explain the need for the mother to do the things she did. One star was the best I could give it.,1468281600,,201,4.315789473684211

7545104,1,B018ELUDKS,"This movie was terrible. One of the worst movies I've ever seen. B-movies look like blockbusters compared to this ""film"". Terrible acting, unbelievable premise, stupid characters. There is nothing redeemable about this trash. These actors, director/writer should never appear in any movie again. Acting and directing is not for them. Even if you are in to cheesy movies, this is bottom barrel stuff. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. I don't think I can be clearer.",1467590400,,455,5.08
7545105,3,B018ELUDKS,"Absolutely HORRIBLE.....which, if you're in the mood for bad acting, TERRIBLE effects, and very amateur camera/lighting, is actually HILARIOUS.
Make no mistake, this is BAD. VERY, VERY bad. VERY BAD, I tell you. But as some random ""What the F@CK is this??"" middle of the night discovery, it is a real treasure. It's also VERY short, so just about the time you start reflecting on your bad life decisions, it's over.
My one ACTUAL complaint, is that there was a LOT of REALLY bad dialog before anything interesting happened. -and I REALLY could have used more backstory, and less horrible softcore porn.
Had I not mentioned the weird amateur softcore porn looking ""love scenes?"" Yeah, this is some full on ADULT shlock.",1467590400,,718,4.89344262295082

7545119,1,B018ELUDKS,"This flick very quickly turns into a very silly hide-and-seek in an abandoned factory or some such place. The story's nowhere near plausible, or scary; big plot twist, it's the mom in the mask and Playboy bunny costume.  Mostly, this wound up being silliness in search of a horror gimmick to hang the story on.  This one's hung long enough, kids: cut 'er down.",1466553600,,360,4.609375
7545120,1,B018ELUDKS,"You look at the cover shot and form this expectation:

""Hey, a crappy horror movie that realizes its bad and therefore will have a lot of boobs bouncing around. I'll watch it.""

The reality:

""This movie takes crappy to new depths that have yet to be rivaled.""

You will not see any nudity and 'bunni' does not look at all as the cover depicts in that the actress who portrays her literally has no boobs.

Whoever shot this doesn't seem to understand some basics about the frame rates and shutter speed, so the whole movie appears to be in slow-motion. The acting is a special kind of terrible. It's not even acting, it's just people shouting lines.

DO NOT waste your time. Someone gets paid each time this is watched, and they do not deserve a dime!",1466467200,,751,4.445255474452555

Mercedez Varble was a cleavage tease for much of the film. Mitchell Lee has no business being on screen in a talking role.

1. From frame one you can clearly tell this is an indie movie. I've seen found footage movies that were shot better.
2. characters were either terrible people, stupid, or forgettable.
3. don't let the cover fool you. This isn't good in any way.
4. Tons of things go nowhere or make no sense, ussually both.
5. The character playing (I feel like actor is an innapropriate term here) makes Kristen Stewart look talented.
6. And finally; I predicted every single scene once the story got started. Absolutely nothing surprised me.
I could go on but I don't need to to show you this is crap.
