7927104,5,B00004YA6X,"For those who like Beast Wars/Machines (there must be some of you weirdo's out there), those who enjoyed the Transformers in the 80's, those who would like some good non-anime cartoon action, or for those who simply want something good to watch, these Transformer volumes are what you're looking for.  Like the first nine installments, these episodes get you aquainted with the greats of TF lore, and provide enough familiarity to make watching TF: The Movie the joy it was supposed to be. It's also a lot better than those Beast spin-offs, in case I didn't make that clear.  Transform, and ROLL OUT!",970704000,13,600,4.815533980582524
7927105,5,B00004YA6X,"I am so glad that the series of Transformers episdoes is continuing to be released thru Rhino Entertainment. Here is a brief summary of the episodes contained in this 3-pack.
Volume 10 (Episodes 1 & 2) Megatron's Master Plan - Megatron tricks the people of Earth that the Autobots are evil and banishes them from the planet forever!  Once gone, Megatron takes control of the planet to suck it dry of energy. Can the Autobots return in time to save the planet and defy the odds?
Volume 11 (Episode 1) A Ghost In The Machine - Starscream's ghost returns and this time he takes over Scourge's body.  He seeks the help of Unicron to restore him back to life. But Starscream must first complete several tasks and help Unicron to use Cybertron as a new body!
Volume 11 (Episdoe 2) The Burden Hardest To Bear - This is one of my personal favorites! Rodimus Prime loses the Matrix and becomes Hot Rod once again. Scourge gains control of the Matrix and becomes more powerful than ever. Hot Rod loses faith in himself and doesn't want to be Rodimus again. So he goes off to find himself and determine his true destiny. The Autobots must regain control of the Matrix before Scourge destroys everything in its path.
Volume 12 (Episode 1) Child's Play - A handful of Autobots and Decepticons are sent accidentally through the space bridge to a dimension where everything is big!  To the aliens on this world, the Transformers and the size of a paper clip. The Autobots befriend an alien boy who agrees to aid them in returning to Earth. However, the Decpeticons hope to seize the chance to return to Earth first and strand Optimus Prime and the Autobots permanently on the alien world.
Volume 11 (Episode 2) Microbots - Another personal favorite!  Megatron seizes control of a powerful crystal that makes him invincible. The only way to stop him is for 3 Autobots to be shrunk into microscopic size and enter Megatron's body to disconnect the crystal. Can Perceptor, Brawn, and Bumblebee disconnect the crystal in time before Megatron destroys the Autobots?
That's my review and I'm sticking to it!  See you all later! Til All Are One!",970617600,70,2123,4.680965147453083
