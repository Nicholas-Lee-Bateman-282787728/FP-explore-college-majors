8457817,4,B0055C69HG,This video is presented as a lecture. A man at a podium discuses the differences of evolution and creation theory. The video is done well but some of it was a little confusing for my 10 year old son to follow. It opened up a lot of discussion and served its purpose but it was a little boring and we only watched half of it. I found it intriguing as an adult but we are breaking it up into smaller chunks for my son.,1510790400,,416,3.9642857142857144
8457818,5,B0055C69HG,"We watched this together as a family ages four to 46. It is only an hour and we would pause along the way to discuss and ask questions. Since this adds time to the one hour video, we usually watch in two sittings. We were able to download a free study guide & outline good for all ages. We found it on the Answers in Genesis website. It is kind of hard to find at first. Go to the ""education"" tab and then click on ""study guides"" and then choose ""The Riddle of Origins Series"". It was helpful for me, as a parent to follow along with the study guide during the video and for review before and after watching. We have been using this as a break from a more traditional text book approach. This can serve as a stand alone or as a supplement to a formal science curriculum. YOu can use the video and study guide as a spring board to further research and develop the topic. We also like the Institute for Creation Research (ICR), Apologia, Apologetics Press, Jobe Martin, & Buddy Davis, and some of the other products they carry.",1402790400,3,1025,4.2615384615384615
