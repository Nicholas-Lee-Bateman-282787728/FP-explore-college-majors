2457018,5,B000CCBCCG,"Some sources say that CBS's All In The Family continued as Archie Bunker's Place after the 1978-79 season. Don't you believe that! CBS regularly telecast AITF for the last time on September 16,1979(CBS ran short marathons of AITF in 1991 commemorating the 20th anniversary of the AITF premiere). Then Archie Bunker(the late great Carroll O'Connor) was spun off on ABP. In 1977,Archie purchased Kelsey's Bar in his hometown of Queens,New York from an ailing Tommy Kelsey,portrayed by Bob Hastings. Archie,who previously was a loading dock worker,reopened the pub as Archie Bunker's Place. At the beginning of ABP,he hired a few new employees,a Hispanic young man named Jose(ho zay) and an Irish woman named Veronica Rooney(Anne Meara,wife of Jerry Stiller and mother of Ben Stiller). The once-prejudiced Archie is now an equal opportunity employer. The old Kelsey's gang is still here,one of them being Archie's buddy Barney Hefner(Allen Melvoin). Rounding out the ABP cast is Jason Wingreen as Harry,another one of Kelsey's gang,Danielle Brisebois as niece Stephanie Mills and of course Jean Stapleton as Archie's ""dingbat"" wife Edith who stuck around for one more season(this one). There was very little seen of Edith this season and also for the next three seasons,the Bunkers' home at 704 Hauser Street. Brisebois joined AITF at the beginning of AITF's ninth and final season,filling the vacancy left by Rob Reiner and Sally Struthers who left after the previous season. Stapleton felt that she had exhausted her character and it was written that Edith had suddenly died of a stroke in her sleep. The most memorable highlights from this season are when the Bunkers' ""little goil"" Gloria(Struthers) and her college professor husband Michael ""Meathead"" Stivic(Reiner) come to the Bunkers' home from the Stivics' Santa Barbara,California home for Thanksgiving. Michael was fired from his job for participating in a protest in the nude against nuclear energy(a major issue in 1979). And of course,there was the Stivics' young son Joey in tow. This episode was a sequel to a three-part AITF episode from December 1978 when Archie,Edith and Stephanie travel to the Stivics' home for Christmas. By the Thanksgiving episode,the Stivics were back together after a brief separation(they were separated in the Christmas episode). Also,remember the AITF episode where the late Sammy Davis Jr. guest-starred? Well,Davis comes to Archie's for some dinner(the pub was expanded to a short order restaurant) one day and unfortunately,the meal was so lousy that he required medical attention. The black nurse told Archie,""Are you the honky who served this man a lousy meal?"". Archie says,""That wasn't very nice! Did you hear what she called me?"" In the AITF episode,someone took a picture of Sammy kissing Archie and in this episode,it was the reverse. In 1983,CBS suddenly decided to pull the plug on ABP,which didn't by then have much viewership as another sitcom with a similar setting,NBC's Cheers. O'Connor was so infuriated that he solemnly vowed never to work for CBS again. Following the twelve-year portrayal of Archie Bunker,O'Connor moved on to become the star of the NBC police drama IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT in 1988. O'Connor had creative control of the drama's production for the six years it ran. He also had creative control of ABP,because CBS felt he deserved it,after being nominated for and winning a multitude of Emmys for his portrayal. By the way,during the run of ABP,another spinoff was born. Struthers reprised her AITF role,this time as a veterinarian's assistant. Gloria,now divorced from Michael(he left her unmercifully),is back in New York residentially with Joey. Once again,she's not too far away from her widowed father. GLORIA ran for only one season,in 1982-83. I dedicate this item to the memory of O'Connor(August 2,1924-June 21,2001).",1133827200,54,3857,5.283387622149837

2457020,5,B000CCBCCG,"Archie Bunker's Place ran for 4 seasons from 1979-1983. The first season, though, still had Jean Stapleton playing Edith. It isn't until the second season when she leaves the show and is put into the script that she died in her sleep. (Not in real life, of course.) This first season will bring many people good memories, too. There is the Thanksgiving Reunion Two-part episode that features Gloria, Mike, and Joey coming back for a visit after moving to California.

2457035,3,B000CCBCCG,"First of all, All In The Family is a classic tv show that needs no introduction. After AITF ended in 1979, the show was relaunched as Archie Bunker`s Place. It is considered a spin-off and continuation of AITF. The show aired on CBS (same network that they aired AITF in) and was successful enough to run for 4 seasons from 1979- 1983. Reruns had since been previously aired on TV Land and various TV Affiliates across the nation up until about the mid 2000s. In early 2006, the 1st season finally made its way to DVD. After that, there is currently a long waiting period where the remaining 3 seasons aren't released yet. Mill Creek Entertainment had recently re-released the 1st season on DVD. So, What I think is going on is that Sony Pictures Home Entertainment is too lazy to release these great shows on DVD. But, there is a company to save us all... Shout! Factory. Please Shout! Factory, Get the rights to the show and release the remaining 3 seasons on DVD.",1461024000,,966,4.525714285714286

2457057,5,B000CCBCCG,"I grew up watching ""AITF"" and Archie was always portrayed as a bigot! To me a bigot is a hater and even though Archie said some foolish things,he really didn't know the full weight of what he was saying! I never looked at Archie and saw him as a hater,just someone who was a little afraid of what he didn't know! His episodes with The Jeffersons was proof the Archie wasn't the only bigot! But I felt the same way about George Jefferson! He was a lot of mouth,like Archie. But Archie was scared and George was a little angry! Anyway neither of these two would hurt a fly and that's what made them both so lovable. Archie Bunkers Place,to me,is even better than All In The Family because it shows the other side of bigotry and prejudice. That being,patience and understanding and Archie learned it all and even though he seemed unwilling,at first,he let himself be taken by a Jewish Liberal partner,Murry and had a niece,Stefanie,who was of the Jewish faith and learned how to accept it and deal with it in a most pleasantly unfolding way! Archie has a big heart! How many bar owners would let a customer run his bar tab up to $180.00 and not be hounding him for the money. This spinoff is every bit as good as the original and I enjoy watching Archie go from one scenario to the next as he tries to run Archie's Place! As Archie would say,""I'm up to my keyster in anticipation"" for the release of the rest of the seasons of this really fine top shelf comedy! Nobody could ever replace Edith. That's why they didn't try! You will enjoy this show and the characters are the best! Hey Archie...Shalom!",1434067200,9,1598,4.438775510204081
2457058,5,B000CCBCCG,Love the interaction between the character Stephanie and Archie.  It is the ultimate generations norms that are always so different for any number of reasons.  I love the series because they were not afraid to call Archie out as the equal opportunity bigot.  Nothing was off limits for him and they showed how crazy he was but it was not his fault.  He was an uneducated WWII Vet and the country just got off rationing.  The 60's dichotomy was perfect adding Murray with a great actor in Martin Balsam.

He's still conservative but progresses in being a little more tolerant and controls his grouchiness. I guess it goes both ways though. But it's really hard to compare the original and this series when we're talking two somewhat different eras - 1970s when the closest thing to conservative was Nixon and Archie was looked at as odd versus the 1980s when conservatism was popular with the American people that Archie looked like the norm if not moderately conservative. I didn't get to see all episodes of all 4 seasons of this wonderful show but had a chance to see enough of them to enjoy. Now if only Sony would just get the remaining 3 seasons released on DVD or something so we all can enjoy.

But now that Shout! Factory has put out all of AITF, here's hoping they will get the rights to ABP, and release the rest of the show. This was an iconic character and despite whether there is a lot of call for ABP on DVD, he deserves to have every episode released. Besides, I think any true Archie Bunker fan wants to see them all. Let's hope Shout! or some other company gets the rights to ABP and puts them out. If not, then it means we are missing out on at least one classic episode during those years (""Archie Alone"", which won Carroll O'Connor an Emmy). Anyhow, this was a good show.

Although there are some additional characters, including Murray, Archie's new partner in the bar, and Veronica, the cook with the drinking problem (and the gay nephew, whose tenure as a waiter lasts just one episode--during which Archie tries everything he can think of to make him ""straight""), there is a significant amount of continuity as well. Edith remains a major character, although she doesn't appear in every episode. Stephanie continues as part of the Bunker household, and becomes a more major figure than she was when she first came on the set the previous season. And even Mike, Gloria, and Joey show up for a two-part Thanksgiving special. So, it still has the feel of ""All in the Family,"" and that's part of what makes it such a great show.

Also, Sammy Davis, Jr., who appeared in an episode several years earlier, makes an encore appearance. And the blind Mr. Van Rensaeler becomes a fixture at the bar. All in all, the first year of ""Archie Bunker's Place"" remains as poignant and funny as the last few years of ""All in the Family.""",1375747200,,1153,4.679802955665025

2457089,4,B000CCBCCG,"If you loved former AITF seasons and Season 8, you'll have no trouble with this one.  Actually Edith is in a few episodes and even Mike and Gloria make it back for Thanksgiving in a 2-part episode.  True, the bar and its characters begin to take center stage and with varied results, mostly decent and with a few jems.  Murray, Archie's partner, is kind of a mixed review, but does fairly well for a just introduced character.  The writers however didn't seem to have made up their minds about him.  He feels like the ""responsible one"" in the beginning, but as the season winds on his character makes enough semi-dopey choices to the point where you question your original opinion.

In ""Archie and the Oldest Profession"", Murray starts by suggesting they throw lovable hooker Dottie out of the bar, realizing she's using their place as a pick-up joint.  While Archie is the voice of reason in the beginning, not wanting to get involved, Murray sways him to point of changing his mind.  Then, out of the blue, Murray has a change of heart and doesn't want to interfere, while now there's no stopping Archie.  Weird.  Other times Murray retains his intelligent position as in the time when they deal with the tax department, and likewise with the liquor board as they re-apply for their licence.  Murray shows lame judgement once again when he makes it his business as Barney gets involved with ex-hooker, now waitress, Dottie.  But that doesn't take the cake.  That honor goes to the time Murray decides to fool around with Barney's ex-wife Blanche, thinking its okay as they've now separated.  He schmoozes her up with Barney in plain sight - like any fool knows that'd be asking for trouble.  Apparently not Murray.  And while its a bit of an issue for Archie in the beginning to accept a Jewish partner, and we sympathize and see Murray as the voice of reason on that issue, toward the end of the season we have the same Murray who hasn't spoken to his daughter for 6 years since she married a Latino husband.  No, Murray doesn't prove to be the voice of reason he starts out to be.

Though that doesn't stop the show from being watchable.

And then there are still a few episodes around Edith which is nice.  Stephanie is a light-hearted continuation of Season 8's cast and is also a good balancing element to the guys at the bar, who all get double time as does the new cook and lush, Veronica and her gay waiter nephew.  Some of the episodes are better than others, but even the worst are still watchable, if not a laugh riot.  They still deal with issues of the time and neighborhood and mostly manage to retain the show's original flavor in spite of emphasis on different characters.  A couple of the more memorable episodes for me would be ""The Return of Sammy (Davis Jr)"", and ""Van Ranseleer's (the blind man) Operation"".

Incidentally, seasons 2 only continued to get better.  Murray becomes a more likable and believable character in the 2nd season, so that I was sad to see him go when he did finally at the end of season 2.  This show hadn't completely found its groove in season 1 but by the second season they were coming up with a lot of good stuff and Archie Bunker's Place was a very solid comedy which I liked just as much as AITF.  It wasn't exactly the same, Archie evolved a bit, and just a bit, but it's fun to watch the characters grow as the 80s took hold.  Perhaps in the final two seasons things did start to degrade somewhat with Billie holding the lead female part, and not a strong one at that.  These seasons will get released some day.  Season 2 should definitely get released.  Carroll O'Connor was an incredible actor, and the writing in this show was and still is very powerful.  However season 1, while decent, doesn't reach the heights that it will in following season.",1314748800,2,3806,4.551470588235294

2457091,3,B000CCBCCG,"If you are on this website, you probably already know that this is essentially the sequel to ""All In the Family."" It is especially interesting if you compare the 1st season of AITF to this dvd set of ""Archie's Place.""

Archie is running a bar now. Michael and Gloria have moved to California, and even though Edith has some episodes, her role is being phased out. (By season 2, she will be gone.)

At the start of Archie's journey, Archie has been hateful of almost everyone. He yelled at Edith and called her names; and he was almost always at war with his son in law. To be sure, in the 1st few episdoes of ""Archie's Place,"" he sounds a bit like his old self. But moving on, we see a rather interesting change.

While he clearly disliked Jews, he is now taking care of a little Jewish girl. (Stephanie) He also enters into a partnership with the Jewish Murray Klein, and later in this set becomes good friends with him. In one episdoe he not only allows a Jewish dinner in his house, but he takes part in it.

Archie never much liked gays, but in one episdoe, he is upset when someone calls the waiter who is gay 'a fruit.'

He never much liked his son in law Michael. But in ""The Thanksgiving Reunion"" he hugs Michael and is happy to see him. And when he finds out Michael is out of work he hugs him and says: ""As long as you have me, you're never going to go hungry.""

In an especially touching episdoe, Archie helps reconcile Murray with his estranged daughter. (""You're not turning into a do-gooder on us are you Archie?"") This line kind of embodies the theme of this show.

In some ways, the most touching episode is ""Man of the Year."" Under a plot of making him 'man of the year,' his 'so called friend' robs him blind. (In the area of thousands.) And Archie can only gently forgive him and say: ""It's alright. Let them go. Tonight, I was someone."" He's like an angel in that episdoe.

I'm probably not the biggest authority on this series. But I do feel this dvd set is an important part of the AITF saga. Because we can see how Archie grew and learned to not only accept, but love.",1303516800,5,2091,4.289340101522843

It just disappeared from the airwaves from out of the blue in 1983,along with it's short lived spinoff Gloria. The reason apparently being,by that time the series had evolved into something barely recognizable from it's original format.

ABP's first season was basically still the 70s era. With Edith still alive and well. Even though she only appeared in four episodes. Mike and Gloria were still together too. Though the two part Thanksgiving episode would turn out to be the last time the show's original four main principals would be together. In general the series sustained much of the AITF flavour.

2457113,4,B000CCBCCG,"I have always enjoyed All In The Family and consider it one of the best TV shows ever,in any genre. This series covers the ""continuing adventures of Archie Bunker"".It is definitely not as good as AITF but it is a logical extention of that series,especially in light of the fact that Rob Reiner,Sally Struthers and Jean Stapleton wanted to move on to other things and only Archie would remain (Stapleton was in ABP season 1 but was phasing out of the role).

  I never saw either series in their original run (too young),but I've seen AITF many,many times in reruns and on DVD.I hadn't seen ABP since it was rerun on WLVI Channel 56 in Boston many years ago,and it is great to see it again. My girlfriend had never seen it and is a big Archie fan,and she was thrilled to get it on the day of its release.

  Don't expect to see AITF,but if you are a fan of Archie Bunker you will enjoy this series. The fact that All In The Family ended,the whole cast but Archie basically changed,the show became a spin-off continuation,and it ran for 4 top 20 seasons tells you how powerful a character Archie was.

As usual, Amazon is the best place to buy it from since it's cheaper than the brick and mortar stores and there's free shipping to boot!
