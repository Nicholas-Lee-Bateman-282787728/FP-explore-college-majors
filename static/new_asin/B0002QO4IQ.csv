It's also pretty amazing the sheet of ice used is much smaller than any event I have ever seen and they make it work just fine. Lot's of top skaters make this DVD a must have!!",1362009600,,300,3.9344262295081966

2115810,2,B0002QO4IQ,"I was disappointed in this CD.  I'm a follower of figure skating, having been in competition myself at the time when dinosaurs were still around.  But this movie has some tremendous skating, but for the most part the costume and make up of he skaters are so dark that it's really a distraction. And Nancy Kerrigan does too much talking between scenes, and she's not a very good 'public speaker.",1179446400,6,394,4.614285714285714
2115811,5,B0002QO4IQ,Great DVD to have for your Halloween Season.  My whole family enjoy it.  My parents are not that crazy for Halloween but love ice skating and this DVD delivers it.  Too bad didn't have enought in the Bonus section.,1168300800,5,214,4.435897435897436
2115812,3,B0002QO4IQ,I love to watch Nancy Kerigan and friends skate. In this DVD the skating was good but the overall production doesn't flow between skating sequences. There was too much talking so this one didn't keep my attention.,1168300800,4,213,4.783783783783784
8030695,4,B0002QO4IQ,Bought this for my ice skating Halloween loving daughter. It's definitely fun to watch! I'm only giving it 4 stars because there are pictures on the cover of performances that are not included on DVD. My daughter was disappointed. Wish they made more of these specials available on DVD. We would love to see more!,1522972800,,313,4.709090909090909

8030697,3,B0002QO4IQ,"I love Halloween, so I thought this would be really good.  Unfortunately, it's dated, the skating is the same moves over and over, not much originality.  It's just different music, but the same moves.  Save your money.",1479081600,,218,4.837837837837838
8030698,4,B0002QO4IQ,Not the best routines but OK.,1461888000,,29,4.0
8030699,5,B0002QO4IQ,"I have videotaped these from the 1990's. Nancy did Halloween On Ice for about 3-4 years. This is a compilation of routines taken from all her shows. It is nice to have them on DVD. The picture quality is excellent. I miss the golden days of skating post-Tonya Harding, where lots of skating specials and competitions were shown on TV. Nancy and her husband produced these family-friendly shows, as well as her Christmas On Ice series. If you want to see past skaters in their prime, performing fun or scary Halloween routines, you'll love this DVD.",1433030400,2,548,4.71875

8030702,3,B0002QO4IQ,Super cheesy video but my toddler loves to watch ice skating and I can't find that many videos so this does do the trick.,1397692800,,121,4.083333333333333
8030703,1,B0002QO4IQ,I ordered Halloween On Ice because my granddaughter and I watched it on television and enjoyed it very much.  I was thrilled to see that you had the DVD version of the show.  When I watched it I was extremely dissapointed that it was not the show that we had watched on tv.  Mannheim Streamroller did not provide the music and the production was different as well.,1372291200,2,364,4.402985074626866
