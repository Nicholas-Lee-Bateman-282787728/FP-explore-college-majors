4235367,4,B003ZTQN2C,"This live concert footage of Miranda Lambert was a gem to add to my live music collection. I own a music studio and we are always looking for movies to show our artists for inspiration and performance delivery skills. This did not disappoint. I rated this 4 stars because I wish it had just a little bit more, but overall well worth what I paid for it.",1443312000,,352,4.268656716417911

on any of our CD players.
What do we do now??",1310515200,,116,3.5
4235380,4,B003ZTQN2C,"An awesome few songs and the monologue before each one gave a great insight into each of them.  Would have been great to hear a few more, but nonetheless this performance is one that will stick in your memory for ages.",1301875200,,218,4.317073170731708

4235382,3,B003ZTQN2C,"I bought this DVD on the American amazon website as I am unable to get Miranda Lamberts dvd in Ireland. I love her stuff have all her albums but was a little disappointed.
Its just too short, 6 or 7 tracks , your only getting into it and suddenly its over.
What she does play is quality, but just too short.",1295136000,4,307,4.049180327868853
4235383,5,B003ZTQN2C,"This was an excellent dvd! The sound and setting were simple: Miranda sits on a stool with her pink acoustic guitar and one of her guitar players and her bass player are behind her. The room she's in is small and filled with candles. The lighting and sound were absolutely beautiful. She sings six songs, five of which are from her third album, Revolution (White Liar, Dead Flowers, The House That Built Me, Love Song, and Heart Like Mine). Before she sings each song she talks about the song and what it means to her. The sixth song on the dvd, ""Love Is Looking For You,"" is from her debut album, Kerosene. It was a real treat to hear her sing this because it has always been one of my favorites, and, according to Miranda, it is very special to her.",1292976000,10,751,4.333333333333333
4235384,5,B003ZTQN2C,"I really like Miranda... she is a REAL country singer, knows where she came from, and I beleive she loves her job.  This dvd is a joy to watch.... and hear.  And she ant hard to look at either....",1291852800,3,196,4.0
4235385,3,B003ZTQN2C,I heard she had an acoustic CD out and thought this was it. Not until I received it did I realize it was a DVD. I was not upset except for the fact that there are only 6 songs listed on the back. It's a gift so I haven't actually watched it yet. Hopefully my mom is happy enough with this though.,1291593600,,296,3.7903225806451615
