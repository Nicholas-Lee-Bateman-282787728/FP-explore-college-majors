8630788,5,B00006785H,"This is an excellent set of Bal-swing instructional tapes.  The instruction is clear, precise and fun.  There is plenty of material for the Intermediate to Advanced dancer.  Besides just moves, Marcus & Baerbl/Steve & Denise demonstrate the form and footwork required to make your Balboa look and feel good.  I recommend the entire set to anyone wishing to learn or improve their Bal-Swing.",1035849600,,390,5.142857142857143
8630789,5,B00006785H,"We love this video series.  This may be one of the best one's yet from Marcus and Baerbl's dance videos.  Not only are M&B two of the greatest dancers around, they are also two of the best teachers out there today.  Here's why we highly recommend this video:
1) Marcus and Baerbl, along with Balboa dance champions Steve and Denise, break down the moves and show them from multiple angles for both leads and follows. Their instruction is easy to understand.  You can actually learn to dance from this video.
2) The video is technically well done.  After showing 3-4 moves, they put them together with music showing how the pieces are part of the whole and giving you the opportunity to DANCE!
3) Interspersed inbetween dance instruction segments are interviews with several ""old-timers"" who danced balboa in the 30s and 40s.  These interviews and dance demonstrations are invaluable resources preserving the history of swing.
4) Not only are Marcus and Baerbl great dancers and great teachers, they have a quirky sense of humor that makes watching these videos over and over FUN.",1035676800,,1079,4.868852459016393
