8533175,5,B00906GYOQ,Great Workout and enjoy doing them everyday.,1438560000,,44,5.428571428571429
8533176,2,B00906GYOQ,I bought this because I love kettlebell workouts but many of the dvds are so boring. This looked different then anything I had tried-it looked more fun. There is just something odd about this trainer-maybe it's the odd grunts or facial expressions she does but I just found her kind of weird. Some of her moves also seemed to use bad form-I actually had her earlier Kettlebell dvd which I used once and tweaked a muscle in my shoulder and could not work out for weeks. I read a lot of reviews for that dvd that said her form was awful. I do not think I will buy any more dvds by her-I'm sure she is a great trainer but I just found her strange,1393977600,,643,4.152
8533177,5,B00906GYOQ,"I've never done kettle bell, however, I'm not new to working out. I thought her instruction was great, she talked about form a lot - which is very important. The first time I did the video as it was shown. The 2nd time through I modified a bit for my own levels - which I found easy to do within the video. (Did static bicep holds, instead of holding the weight down. Or held onto the weight all through lunges, instead of setting it down every other one...)
I like that she's not annoying at all, too.  Very important. And the video is broken up in 3 parts. So if I'm in a super hurry I'll just do the cardio - 11 minute part - and I like being able to do that.",1387756800,3,662,3.9774436090225564
8533178,4,B00906GYOQ,"Great work out, easy to follow can feel the calories burning off as you sweat. The second workout falls short, very similar to the first workout.  Did not care for the way the two workouts are spliced together.",1386547200,,210,4.526315789473684
8533179,5,B00906GYOQ,I have always been a fan of Gin Miller and have a number of her work out dvds.  This a good kettle bell work out.,1372204800,,113,3.52
8533180,2,B00906GYOQ,Normally I love her but this one is sooo basic.  Great for those just starting out and out of shape.  Movements are slow as well.,1355875200,2,129,4.12
