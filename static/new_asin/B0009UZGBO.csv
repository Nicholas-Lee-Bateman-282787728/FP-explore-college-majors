8067181,5,B0009UZGBO,Not high quality production but the kids don't notice or care. Helped both transition into their first school experiences. Our daughter had a hard time with drop off until watching this. Instantly had a positive impact-no more tears!,1505001600,,233,5.157894736842105

8067183,4,B0009UZGBO,"My son did like this and it helped him understand what pre-school was about.  I bought this after he started and was having a very hard time with the transition.  I should have bought it before and I think it would have really helped.  The bear is a little weird, but my son didn't seem to care.",1423612800,,295,4.140350877192983

8067186,5,B0009UZGBO,"My son is newly 4 and we had attempted pre-school at 3.  He was so completely unhappy about it, we removed him after a month (of nightmares, tears, and sheer unhappiness).  We signed him up at a different school this time and have our fingers crossed.

But, since getting this DVD, his attitude has COMPLETELY changed about going to school.  I believe it has helped ""erase"" the initial negative experience he had.  In the video, he sees children having a great time and enjoying the day-to-day events that take place at preschool (arts & crafts, storytime, gardening, songs & dancing, dropping off & picking up, good-moring song, puppet/magic show, playground time).

Also, the main character (a short person dressed in a creepy-looking bear costume), and the other children & teachers, discuss the feelings of fear and anticipation that go along with starting preschool.  Although, they don't harp on it.  It's really a perfect introduction... with most of the focus on how GREAT school can be.

I highly recommend this one.  Even though I found it 'low budget', my son LOVES the songs (which are all sung by the same person, who sort of has a Debbie Gibson/Tiffany twang), the setting, the main character, etc.  We watch it EVERYDAY!  And, school starts in just 2 days... and he's so truly excited about it!  :o)",1249257600,,1314,4.838565022421525
8067187,4,B0009UZGBO,this video is helpful and keeps the kids attentive to what is happening I would recommend it,1243468800,,92,4.470588235294118
8067188,5,B0009UZGBO,"At first blush, you might question how effective this DVD will be because the production quality isn't on par with Disney or Nick Jr.  But my son LOVES this DVD.  He always asks to watch ""Bear Go To School"" video, and it has helped him really get familiar with what a preschool is like.  I like that my 2 year old has a video that isn't about elementary school, but preschool.  The songs might drive the adults nuts, but my son loves this movie.",1190505600,,445,4.261904761904762
8067189,4,B0009UZGBO,"I thought the bears were really creepy.  Especially the father bear whose mouth didn't move.  Very cheap video with bad bear costumes.  However, my 3-1/2 year old loved it!  He watches it every day in anticipation of preschool and now can't wait to go.  I gave it 4 stars based on my son's recommendation!",1186617600,,305,4.574074074074074
