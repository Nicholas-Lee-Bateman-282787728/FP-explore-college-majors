8335120,4,B001Q7JM3M,"I have to disagree with the first reviewer, though I can see where they're coming from.  This DVD is specifically designed to take you from scratch.  This is for the person who's new to working out or has certain exercises they can't do like pullups.  It also serves as an alternate workout plan for fitness trainers or people who want to try a total bodyweight workout.  If you're at a intermediate or advanced level of fitness, this may not be for you.  Then again, there are professional builders and muscleheads who can't do some of the moves in this or the advanced DVD!!  I've seen YouTube clips of guys with 230 lbs. of solid muscle, but can only go halfway on their pullups.  This video is about training your body to maneuver your own weight, and getting you ready for the advanced DVD.  This video could stand alone, but I recommend getting both.  That way once you've done the instructional routine, you can shoot for a bigger challenge.",1250553600,15,948,4.595238095238095
8335121,1,B001Q7JM3M,"This DVD was a waste of my money, and this is the first time i bought something that was completely useless to me. Dont be fooled by their fancy videos, there is nothing of the sort on this DVD.  Just exercises that everyone knows already (pullup, pushups, squats, dips) and a little bit of common variations.",1236384000,3,309,4.517857142857143
