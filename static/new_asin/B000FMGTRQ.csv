It is very rare to discover an unknown movie and much rare indeed one that is also good. Well, that happened with Paul Bowles: Halfmoon. It is a beautiful movie that shows a Middle East seen by the eyes of a connaisseur, nor an idealized view neither the more geopolitical and grim view of our days. It is a poetic, sensual and cruel vision of a culture, seen from the inside by a stranger. That's it: the ancient Orient as seen by an occidental man who blended with it and that knew it better than anyone. You can also see this collection of stories as dreams of kief, very beautiful and terrible.",1409616000,,689,4.2272727272727275

Narrated by Bowles himself, wonderful on-location filming will have you mopping jungle sweat from your forehead and Moroccan sand from your eyes. Acting, directing, music all no less brilliant than Bowles enchanting storytelling. I'll list this as one of the top ten best films in the world.",998870400,5,464,5.038961038961039
