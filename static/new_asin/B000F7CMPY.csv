8118555,3,B000F7CMPY,"This little independant film finally saw release on DVD this year, and if you are a fan of the genre or any of the actors involved, it is well worth seeking out. Familiar names in the cast include John Glover, Jill Hennessey, and Paul Sorvino, all who do well with the material and at times elevate the production above its modest budget and aspirations.

A murder has occured late at night outside of a collection agency, and it's up to the police detective, Sam (Glover) to figure out ""whodunnit"" from the motley crew of suspects inside. It's a simple plot but the somewhat unusual setting keeps the viewer interested (how many films about a collection agency can you think of?), as do the name actors. Some scenes fall flat and run long, including many of the attempts at humor focusing on the abrasive character of Frankie (Patricia Scanlon). The film is at its best when focusing on the interesting relationship that develops though the night between Sam and Kate (Hennessey), a single mother working at the agency who--like everyone else involved--has secrets she's desperate to hide.

The DVD itself features director commentary and original trailer, but little else. It is also annoying in that it forces the viewer to watch a number of trailers for other movies before allowing the main menu to come up, and these trailers cannot be skipped over.",1158883200,3,1355,4.836206896551724
8118556,4,B000F7CMPY,Always a pleasure to see Jill Hennessey. And she doesn't disappoint. Perfect film noir. Great fun. Had me going. Haunting choice of music. Good job directing Vilga.,1153353600,3,164,5.111111111111111
