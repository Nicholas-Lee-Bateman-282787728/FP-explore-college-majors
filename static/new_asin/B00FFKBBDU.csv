5990550,5,B00FFKBBDU,"Sometimes power and triumph start as whispers and then become deafening, and so it is with a handful of women who were having the same experience of being sexually harassed and assaulted during the course of their day until one by one they started doing something about it. And their brave action changed legislation in Egypt. Bravo to those who lived this true story, and thank you to those who brought it to film.",1426809600,,415,4.621621621621622
5990551,5,B00FFKBBDU,"Incredible movie. I didn't know what to expect when I watched this on Amazon Prime. It's a powerful tale of how three different women handle the growing sexual harassment in Egypt.

Woman one is harassed on a daily basis, on every bus, on the streets she walks. She dresses as dowdy as possible, covers herself head to toe. Unfortunately Egypt's bus system has men and women crowded extremely close together and some men seem to think it's a sport to grab women standing near them. Some of the men go so far as to unzip their own pants.

We see how her low opinion of the men around her in general begins to affect her marriage.

And then one day, she decides no man is going to touch her and get away with it again...and she becomes a vigilante, stabbing stabbing the perps in the crotch.

Her path crosses with that of two other women. One is a wealthy one who was (I think) raped at a football game. Her husband didn't handle the situation well, so hers is a story about emotional abandonment as well. About how, whether people intend it or not, they can punish us for being assaulted.

The third story is a the first woman in Egypt to file a sexual harassment claim. If she continues the claim, she will lose her fiance.

To avoid spoilers, I'm not going to get into further detail about what they do. The movie follows them, their troubles, their emotions, their families' reactions, their everyday life as well as that of a detective as he tries to track down the vigilante on the buses. I was pleasantly surprised by him and his actions.

Long review short, this is an empowering movie, about the different ways women can take action and seek justice. It's also extremely enlightening about the situation women in Egypt face on a daily basis. Though this occurred (this is based on a true story) in 2009, when you think about it, it wasn't that long ago.",1426032000,3,1861,4.471976401179941
5990552,5,B00FFKBBDU,"I saw this movie in Indianapolis after the awards were presented. Outstanding film about sexual harassment in the new Cairo.  I it reminder me if Death Wish at times in the desire to punish to seek justice and respect. Good acting, original story line, a mix of stories. Well written.  Wish it came to cable or netflix.",1389830400,,319,4.578947368421052
5990554,5,B00FFKBBDU,"Extremely well done. Exposes a serious problem that exists in many places and also explores the main theme, which is  negligence of women in a male dominated society.

5990568,5,B00FFKBBDU,"Great movie! I was surprised to see all women get harassed; it does not matter if they are veiled or not.  This is just sad.  Some men seem to forget they have mothers, daughters, aunts, cousins, and I am sure they would not like anyone touching their women.  Sadly this is happening in other countries as well; in some places it is even worse, like in India.  Movies like this help create consciousness.",1437955200,,404,4.493150684931507

5990570,4,B00FFKBBDU,"This is a powerful and disturbing movie about just how horrible daily life is for women in Egypt. It's takes tremendous courage for women to do the simplest activities in public, where sexual harassment of the most egregious sort is normal and taken for granted as an entitlement by Egyptian men.
Painful to watch but it's important to be a witness-and I speak as a man.",1429660800,,370,4.621212121212121

5990573,5,B00FFKBBDU,"Powerful movie about women in Egypt facing sexual harassment.  I traveled to Egypt with another girl friend in early 2009 as tourists.  When checking into a hotel in Aswan, the guy who brought up our bags lingered in the room refusing to leave.  He then touched my hair and shoulders and I jerked away.  He moved to my friend and did the same to her.  She's got a more docile personality and did not move when he touched her.  He then brushed his hands across her chest.  At that point I started screaming and making a scene.  The hotel owner tried to calm me down by serving me tea.  I threatened to call the embassies and report this hotel.  Looking back, I should have called the tourist police.  At any rate, am glad that we did not stay silent and we ended up moving to another hotel that was a lot more expensive, hoping that the same thing would not happen.  My friend felt very badly and cried.  I should have been more sympathetic to her.  Watching this movie really brought to light the harassment, blame, and social pressure that Egyptian women deal with on a daily basis.  When it comes to sexual crimes, the scrutiny is too often on the victim.  What was she wearing?  What was she doing?  Is she promiscuous?  And the damage, too often than not, falls to the victim and those who are associated with her.  Families need to stand by their loved ones who are victimized.  Men need to support their partners in their time of need.  Most importantly, we, as women, need to stop pointing fingers at each other, drop the blaming and the accusations and the judgments.  Let's stand up together for our right to not be victimized by sexual crimes.",1426896000,5,1653,4.454849498327759

8615293,5,B00FFKBBDU,I love the fact that there is a new light on a very old problem. The fact that women who are victimized are treated like the criminal and the guilt that is compounded on to those emotions do not make the healing process any easier. Thank you for making this video.,1494892800,,264,4.196078431372549
8615294,5,B00FFKBBDU,"Amazing movie about three amazing women who have more courage than a dozen lions. The two men, too, the comedian, and the cop were outstanding in their growing sensitivity.

8615299,4,B00FFKBBDU,great movie; definitely worth watching. Good for them for tackling this subject! Its a big problem handled very well. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it shows one side of the coin; makes you feel like all men are like that even though there is a supportive fiance.,1473465600,,277,4.346153846153846
