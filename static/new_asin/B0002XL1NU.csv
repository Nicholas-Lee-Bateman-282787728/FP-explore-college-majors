2136136,5,B0002XL1NU,"H.H. Holmes was, as said in this this excellent documentary, a monster!  His crimes were incredible even to this day, but few people know of him. That will change soon! This movie is great. Done with care, professionalism and respect for the material.  Several techniques, montages, reinactments, interviews, etc., were used to bring this story to light.  The decision to film in Black & White was good, IMO.  It gave the production a sense of being in another time long ago.

This independent production rivals the documentaries found on A&E and the Discovery Channel, to name a couple.  It could only have been better had old H.H. been there himself!

To those involved . . . please do the Albert Fish story!",1094083200,4,710,4.770491803278689

2136139,5,B0002XL1NU,"The HH Holmes Documentary is very well produced and very interesting.  Not a lot is written about Dr. Holmes, I know him through the Macabre song.  He was a twisted dude, for sure...but very professional in his appearance, the kind of guy that you would never think of doing the horrific, unspeakable things that he done.  The overall atmosphere of the film sets the mood for the time of the story...I really like the way John Borowski done this film.  I was kind of expecting something sort of low-budget, however it's very well produced.  I am very much looking forward to the Albert Fish film that he is working on and would highly recommend this film to anyone who has an interest in serial killers or the criminal mind.",1093996800,2,724,4.5813953488372094

I don't know how they can get away with this proclamation of being the first.

One of the most interesting points raised is that Dr. H.H. Holmes may have been ""Jack the Ripper"". The evidence for this theory is quite compelling...especially, the handwriting evidence. The great grandson of this ""monster"" is the person making the claim. It's quite intriguing.
Personally, I think this deranged doctor was systematically harvesting skeletons and body-parts for medical schools in the 19th century. There was little over-site as to the source of such items. Therefore, the doctor was able to make a profit from his horrific practice.
All of us are caught up in the horror of this psychopathic behavior. Yet, we should learn from it. Holmes used murder to profit in nearly every en devour he undertook. His total lack of empathy for human beings make him an important study.",1417305600,5,917,5.0394736842105265

2136240,3,B0002XL1NU,"(I changed my rating from a 4 to a 3 on 2014-08-28 and explain why.)

I'm currently reading ""The Devil in the White City"" (DITWC) by Erik Larson.  While I am near the end, I can recommend it.  As a matter of fact, I'm prepared to give a BIG recommendation on DITWC already; it is not only an insightful read, but Mr. Larson is surely one of the best storytellers out there, particularly in the true-crime genre.  I'd put him up there with Jack Olsen for sure.

Unfortunately, I don't believe that Mr. Larson is featured as a commentator here, although Harold Schecter is.  I've read a couple of books from the latter author -- ""Deranged"" and ""Deviant"" at least -- books that I can easily recommend.  He does a great job of bringing old stories back to life, mostly through outstanding research and strong writing skills.  Most likely, I will try a few more books from him sometime down the road as he is really good.

Mr. Schecter wrote a book entitled ""Fiend,"" and I did get a good chuckle at one point when he describes H. H. Holmes as being a ""fiend"" in this documentary, although I believe the two ""fiends"" weren't the same guy.  Surely, Mr. Holmes was worse than a ""fiend,"" as he murdered so many people for his own selfish gain.  (I do believe the connotations of the word ""fiend"" have changed over time, however.  I believe the word had far worse implications in the 19th century.)  At any rate, the numbers of Mr. Holmes' murders are so large, and those murders occurred during a time when forensics weren't very good, so no one really knows the number for sure.  Pick one, and it's probably too small.

With regards to this documentary, it is a little cheesy at times, but it's also a little bit of ""fun,"" considering the subject matter.  The reenactments remind me a bit of old Peter Lorre or Vincent Price films, and while they were a little ""melodramatic"" -- as someone else on this site opined in another review -- they were somewhat interesting, and they surprisingly brought a little necessary levity to the tale.

Really, more like a 3.5 or so, but I'll round down today since I am at the end of DITWC, and that is surely stronger.  But after watching I say, ""Surely, H. H. Holmes was worse than a fiend!  I might even call him a 'cad.'""",1408320000,,2253,4.451219512195122

It is tastefully done and makes your mind want to know more about America's first serial killer. Because of this film there are many investigations going on these days regarding Holmes and his evil. There are also talks that Hollywood is looking to make a movie starring a MEGAstar in Hollywood probably because of the work that was done by Borowski.

It is a highly polished independant production that rivals the big studios. Borowski has done his research and takes the viewer on a journey into the dark annals of Chicago in the late-nineteenth century. The eerie black and white re-enactments brings the case to life, with the suspense of the old monster films of the turn of the century. The haunting voice-over by esteemed actor Tony Jay gives the film it's final touch. Look into Borowski's book: The Strange Case of HH Holmes, where he complies three primary source books on the Holmes case into one book.

I look forward to future projects by John Borowski.

I was particularly impressed by Holmes' education level (med school grad), and his architectural knowledge: drawing up his own plans for the ""castle"" in which he lived. This, of course, was also where he terminated most of his victims. The interior was a labyrinth of hidden rooms, false doors, and secret passages. One room was equipped w/ gas pipes for easy, clean executions. Then, it was off to the basement / dungeon, where the bodies were immersed in acid, the flesh dissolved, so that Holmes could sell the skeletons to the local university! Holmes was more than just a serial murderer, in that he was also a master con-man, bigamist, and insurance fraud expert. His only mistake came when he ""forgot"" to pay a promised $500 to a man he met in prison. That error cost Holmes dearly, as it led to the investigation that would be his undoing.

So as not to give too much away, I will say that this man was disgusting in his atrocities to the point of rivaling his better known contemporaries of the present.  It's amazing what a sickly clever mind this guy had and for how long he got away with it.

I have to say this filmmaker's other film Fish was not as well done and was lacking in some areas. I read reviews on Amazon on both films before renting and many liked Fish better. This film[H.H.Holmes} was more professionally done and seems to have a smoother flow to it with the facts in the case. Fish was dragged out a bit[with religious images] and I wasn't crazy about the addition of the commentator that owned a letter belonging to Fish. He was rather creepy and was not an expert on much of anything. I did not get why he was used in the film at all. I personally think the director had to give him a spot because he owned the original letter that finally caught Fish and to fill up space in the film. The book on Fish is much better.

Since it appears that a feature film about Holmes is (finally) in the works, this makes for an excellent stop-gap until its release. Also investigate ""The Strange Case of Dr. H. H. Holmes"" and ""Expo"" as well as ""Devil in the White City"" tours when in Chicago. Enjoy!",1294185600,,506,4.827586206896552
2136316,5,B0002XL1NU,"How angry H. H. Holmes would be if he knew how forgotten he is today.  Here he is, dubbed (inaccurately) ""America's first serial killer,"" a man who may have killed several dozen people (and definitely killed several children), a fiend who built a ""castle"" custom designed to expedite his murderous activities, a medical doctor, a first-rate confidence man, and even quite the ladies' man - and yet few people have ever heard of him today, and he rarely even gets a mention when people start talking about history's most infamous killers.  Frankly, I don't find the man all that interesting - and I'm not entirely sure why.  Given his deeds and my fascination with serial killers, this man should be up there with Ted Bundy, Jack the Ripper, and the Green River Killer for me - but he isn't.  Maybe it's just because he was such a puny, cowardly sort of fellow who wasn't even man enough to do his work up close and personal.  No, this guy relied on gas, poison, and asphyxiation to rob his innocent victims of their lives.  He only grew a pair after the killing was done, chopping up and burning the bodies or, in several cases, stripping them to the bone and selling their skeletons to medical schools.

What should make H. H. Holmes interesting is the fact that he really doesn't fit the profile of your typical serial killer.  For one thing, he was highly educated, having received his medical degree from the University of Michigan.  He didn't exactly fly under the radar, either, as he was quite brazen in terms of conning people out of their money and buying things on credit and never paying for them.  Then there is the ""Murder Castle,"" the three-story, 60-room monstrosity he had built in Chicago.  This was no boy next door, and I daresay you would have had a hard time finding any of his neighbors going on about how shocked they are and what a nice man he was once his true nature was revealed.

This documentary does an excellent job of following Holmes from his birth as Herman Webster Mudgett in 1861 to his death (by hanging) in 1896.  The most interesting part of the story, of course, is the ""Murder Castle,"" and the narrative goes into some detail as to the manner in which he killed his victims - such as by pumping gas into their sealed rooms or locking them (including one of his wives) in a giant steel vault to die a slow death by asphyxiation - and the postmortem liberties he took with their bodies (his basement boasted two giant furnaces, a stretching rack, pits of acid, a variety of poisons, and a bloody dissection table).  The video also helps explain why he was not suspected of murder much sooner.  First and foremost is the fact that these killings took place in the 1890s, long before the advent of modern forensics and several years before fingerprints were used by police.  There's also the design of his ""castle,"" which allowed for quiet killings in soundproof rooms and the quick removal of the bodies down a specially designed chute to the basement.  Then there is the Chicago World's Fair of 1893.  Holmes rented out rooms in his ""castle"" to visitors, some of whom just never returned home.  They were almost perfect victims because their friends and family back home would have no reason to link their disappearances to Holmes.

The documentary takes us through the international news event that was the trial and the defendant's shenanigans in court.  Then we learn how, following the pronouncement of his death sentence, Holmes decided to take credit for all of his crimes and then some, only to recant for the most part on the gallows.  As should be obvious, H. H. Holmes was uniquely diabolical and is thus most worthy of study.  If the evil that men do lives on and on, then we need to understand the most evil of men, and H. H. Holmes definitely fits into that category.",1290988800,3,3819,4.608567208271787
2136317,4,B0002XL1NU,"I was pleasantly surprised by this documentary! I rented it on impulse because I'd nothing better to watch and the subject interested me. It's a fairly good overview of the H.H. Holmes story, from Holmes's early years in New Hampshire right through to his execution. What it is not is a thorough investigation which is why I gave it only 4 stars. There were some details lacking and the film, though extremely polished, seemed to have a low-budget quality to it.

It's great if you're looking to kill (pardon the pun) an hour and don't know much about one of America's worst serial killers. However, those of you familiar with the Holmes story, don't look for any startling revelations or intense detective work.

The format is typical documentary with ""slide shows"" of pictures from that era interspersed with interviews from experts on the subject (although there were only a few of those). The narrator has a stuffy British-y accent which makes the documentary seem more ""official"" somehow. Also there are voice-overs reading some of Holmes's autobiography. There are short dramatizations of Holmes stalking a young frightened woman around a creepy dark house. Again somewhat low-budget but still very entertaining. Be prepared, though, later in the film, there is a dragging part where the narrator is describing Holmes's flights across the country where all you see is a red line bouncing across a map for what seems like 10 minutes.

I would have liked to see more of how Holmes's house of horror was built (more plan details) and more on the subsequent police investigation once Holmes was caught. Again, this is more an overview documentary instead of an in-depth analysis. But it was definitely worth the 1.99 rental fee.

What motivated Dr. Mudgett aka Dr. H. H. Holmes to do what he did were the same anti-social forces that propel modern psychopaths to commit the crimes they do today. His story is timeless. Societal free riders such as Mudgett prey on the general population and get away with whatever they can until they are ultimately punished for their behavior. The psychopath is not in need of our understanding. What he requires is quarantine. They must be isolated and imprisoned. Mudgett's methods both fascinate and disturb us today but they provide an excellent education for those who wish to become familiar with the evil of which some humans are capable.,1280016000,3,824,4.978260869565218

  It consists of a loop of old B&W photos, drawings, and maps.
Fadeing in and out,overlaying most of the other shots, is the same photo on the cover of Holmes.
While the narrator repeatedly points out and reminds you of how ""normal"" Holmes appeared to those around him.

 This is an insult to the audiance, as though by just hearing the story of Holmes horrific crimes was not enough to send shudders of repulsion through anyone, the fact is, he was a prolific serial killer.  Even the most casual observer of popular crime shows today, understands that monsters of this genre know how to blend in, and most likely have above average intelligence.

  It is narrated in a monotone voice, that sounds like a bored newscaster reading an essay aloud.

  The only good part of this film is the occasional flash to a present day phyciatrist who explains why Holmes became the unique freak that he was.

 The production would be so much better if this person was simply telling the tale himself along with his insight; while the occasional photo or news paper clipping was shown.

  The tale of H.H.Holmes is certainly creepy enough without all the very un-special effects distracting attention from the forensic study of his mind.

There is no doubt that there are still hundreds of undetected serial killers in our society which amounts to the thousands of missing children in America that remain at large and are never found! The diabolical nature of these sadistic characters need to be properly profiled in order for law enforcement official to better capture them. The BKT Murders, Son of Sam, Zodiac and others have cleverly defianced authorities with a stream of obvios undetected clues.

2136337,5,B0002XL1NU,"I first became interested in the life of serial killer H.H. Holmes ten years ago when I read ""Depraved"" by Harold Schechter.  He was an incredibly complex man who perfected the art of manipulation and deception and his lust for blood far surpassed that of his English rival Jack The Ripper.  This documentary by John Borowski is a must have for those who are fascinated by and would like to learn more about the now infamous ""Torture Doctor"".  I also highly recommend this movie for fans of ""Devil In The White City"" as it provides invaluable insight into the man who had just as much drive and ambition to destroy as the architects of Chicago's World's Fair had to create.

This film examines the life of Holmes from the start of his life as an abused and tormented child straight through his college years where he pursued his interest in anatomy to his life as a ruthless killer.  John Borowski pays fine attention to every detail to make this film seem as real as possible and to help expose the madness that was Holmes' world.  His passion for film making as well as the film's subject is apparent from the opening sequence.  The narration by the late, great Tony Jay is haunting and the interviews with the before mention Harold Schechter and other experts in the fields of criminology and forensics are compelling and well produced.

All in all, this is a wonderful documentary about a murderous mastermind who held America in a state of shock and fear in the late 1800's.  The story of Holmes' life is well presented, the direction is superb, and this film makes a great addition to a serial killer ""fan's"" collection (as well as a great stocking stuffer for the kiddies come December!)

2136338,2,B0002XL1NU,"When I first came to this page to write a review for this documentary, I thought I was in the wrong place. It had a four-star rating overall, and many five-star ratings. Yet when my roommate and I watched it the other night, we could barely contain our laughter at how corny the information in the documentary was presented.

The documentary didn't have much of a budget, but low-budget films need not appear cheap. This did. It re-used and overused the same photographs of Holmes, Chicago, his ""castle of horror"", to the point where I was wondering why it wasn't simply a radio show. I kept wondering to myself: What was the director trying to show me? They filmed a few dramatizations, and they couldn't have appeared hokier if they had tried. A woman holding a candle in a nightgown, walking around the only hallway they used to depict the inside of the ""castle of horror"", looking disoriented. It was just weird. I certainly didn't get a sense of the horror and terror I think I should have felt.

One of the three experts used in the film ended half of his clauses and 3/4 of his sentences with question marks, and that should have been dealt with. It's extremely annoying to listen to someone talk who makes statements sound like questions, and it should never happen in a documentary. It wouldn't have cost an extra dime for Borowski to have given the expert a few tips.

To be fair, this documentary did put a face on Holmes and his victims. Holmes wasn't a pleasant fellow. He did some pretty gruesome things. Or maybe he didn't.

After being led through gruesome tales (and re-led and re-led), evidence of a torture dungeon in the large ""castle"" Holmes built in Englewood to further his career as a sociopathic killing machine, we're left with a final thought: that Holmes, who at first admitted to several murders, recanted before he died, claiming to have killed only two people. And we'll never know the truth, because it happened too long ago, and just before better technology (like fingerprinting) was used to solve crimes.

One problem I had with the DVD is that it contained neither captions nor subtitles, and I continue to be amazed at the amount of media produced with little or no thought given to the needs of the hearing impaired. This is my own personal crusade, as I'm hearing impaired, and find captions or subtitles helpful. Without them, I need to use these:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TV-Ears/dp/B0002GMDQG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TV Ears</a>.

(This problem has nothing to do with how I rated the documentary.)

More details about finding the Pitezel girls in Canada, the condition of the bodies, etc. since they didn't explain it like they did in one of the books I read which made me despise him even more that he could do that.

I know this is probably ridiculous to ask but a computer generated image of what the castle looked like from the inside to get a better idea of the horrors within.

2136341,1,B0002XL1NU,"That the title states that H.H, Holmes is America's first serial killer indicates the lack of research the film crew did.  I have read the H.H. Holmes book and am very familiar with his case.  His level of deception and ability to move so fluidly and avoid the law is impressive.  His torture chamber is also impressive.  He is a Victorian Ted Bundy/Henry Lucas and Charlie Ng to various degrees.  His success was based on a common thread to most serial killers- they feast on social upheaval and the subsequent displaced.  The rocking 1960's/The Anarchist 70's or the movement of Americans from rural to urban at the turn of the century links all of these killers.  Forgotten in the rush to ""firstdom"" is the Bender family of Cherryvale KS from 1871-1873.  The Benders (Mother, Father, son and lovely daughter the spiritualist Kate) lured eleven men to their deaths for primarily economic gain although more ghastly deeds have been ascribed to them). They ran a modest boarding house to supply the western expansion in the post-civil war era. The Benders may not be the first in American history but they predate HH by more than a quarter century.  They are unique even by modern standards for the fact that a seemingly cohesive family unit fully participated for an extended period of time.  Shades of Sawney Bean in the Flint Hills.

Additionally the state of Kansas has erected a historical marker directing tourists to the Bender's infamy.

2136342,4,B0002XL1NU,"Being a bit of a ""true crime buff,"" it's always nice to see a well-constructed documentary about the life of a serial killer. Although it's impossible to reveal every little detail in a 60 minute film, writer/director John Borowski jam packs this one with tons of thoroughly-researched information.

Wonderfully narrated by Tony Jay and featuring actual photographs, newspaper articles from the time, and re-enactment footage, this docu-film really gives you a sense of the late 1800's (when these crimes took place).

The story unfolds in an engrossing fashion and keeps you intrigued for the entire 64 minutes.

I found it fascinating to learn that there were many similarities in this case to those of more modern serial killers. Sure you've heard of Ted Bundy and Jeffrey Dahmer, but have you heard of HH Holmes?  Maybe not. But Holmes was first and it's great to see Borowski pull Holmes' story from out of the basement and reshare it with the world.

This is a well-made documentary film and a must-see for true crime buffs!",1154649600,,1030,4.930635838150289
2136343,5,B0002XL1NU,"I watched this last night. For a new documentary filmmaker, John Borowski, is somebody to watch out for. This coumentary reminds you of old black and white thriller films but with great narration and commentary by Harold Schechter who wrote depraved about Dr. H. Holmes born Herman Mudgett. The criminal profiler reminds me of a blonde Chris Parnell and the forensics person is quite vague but explains the lack of forensics science during that time. Dr. H. Holmes was a frightening man who killed, slaughtered, dismembered humans and sold their skeletons for profit. He was truly a genius at manipulating poor men like Benjamin Pitezel and his family who were his greatest casualties. He was the first serial killer to become so notorious by the end of one century on par with England's Jack the Ripper.",1154131200,7,804,4.919117647058823
2136344,3,B0002XL1NU,"I read, with great enthusiasm, the book THE DEVIL IN THE WHITE CITY, and afterwards stumbled across the existence of this DVD documentary about H.H. Holmes.  I eagerly rented it, hoping for more tidbits about Holmes.

If you aren't familiar with the story, the main thing to know is that this Holmes character was first a great con artist who constructed, in 1890's Chicago, a huge three story building housing businesses on the first floor, rental rooms on the third, and apparently a maze of ""killing rooms"" and ""torture rooms"" on the 2nd floor, where he may have killed 50-100 people, mostly visitors to the Chicago World's Fair.  This documentary serves a rudimentary introduction to this story...but the book gives far better details.

The documentary has some advantages...mostly the photos:  we see photos of Holmes and some of his assciates and victims.  We see some of the locations where key events took place.

But the disadvantages are pretty huge:  there are lots of cheesy shots of a very poor theatrical set serving as a hallway in the ""murder castle.""  Various actors wander around it looking confused or scared, while underneath the voice of the narrator tells us more about Holmes.  THere are also very tedious shots of a map of the US with a superimposed stock video of a steam locomotive...indicating that Holmes was traveling.  I certainly understand that there isn't a lot of archival footage from 1893, but these poorly conceived substitutes give the whole thing a cheesy feeling and are sometimes laughable.  Also, the documentary does have some commentary from ""experts"" who include a couple of odd-fellows, one of whom wrote a book called ""Depravity"" about Holmes and others.  He is clearly a guy who has no problem stating his opinions about Holmes as fact, and this video in turn lets us take them as fact.  But worst of all, the video also takes some of Holmes' own writings about his childhood as fact...these tidbits are drawn for the autobiography Holmes wrote while in prison...trying to win public sympathy.  He was a proven liar of the first order, and yet the film takes his descriptions as fact, offering no supporting information.  This is dangerous.

I can only recommend the video to someone who is intriqued by Holmes and wants a sketchy idea of who he was in one hour flat. But for a worthwhile study of this man and the times that made his deeds possible...start with THE DEVIL IN THE WHITE CITY...which also beautifully educates about the Chicago World's Fair, one of this country's most amazing accomplishments.

If the subject matter of H.H. Holmes weren't so interesting in and of itself, this video would only rate 2 stars at best.",1143504000,5,2679,4.876379690949228
2136345,3,B0002XL1NU,"H. H. Holmes: America's First Serial Killer (John Borowski, 2004)

John Borowski's first film (as I write this, he's working on his second, about Albert Fish) chronicles the life and dealings of one H. H. Holmes, a cult figure in the serial killer underground whose life story pops up every decade or so-- most recently, Erik Larson's mega-hit The Devil in the White City brought him back into the public consciousness. Borowski capitalized on the renewed popularity of ""America's first serial killer"" (a claim which has been long disproven, though it makes a catchy subtitle) and made this fun little doco.

While there's nothing terribly new here for the serial killer fan, it's certainly got the kind of low-budget charm one expects from, say, a History Channel special on any given subject; Tony Jay's narration is well beyond eerie into over-the-top silliness, and the few special effects to be found (mostly in the form of fog, fog, and more fog) are laid on with a rusty trowel. Borowski balances reenactments of the original events with interviews with criminal researchers (including the everpresent Harold Schechter, the Ann Rule of the serious serial killer fan), coming up with what looks like, well, a History Channel special more than anything. Quite fun, if you're into that sort of thing. ***",1143072000,,1308,5.023041474654378
2136346,4,B0002XL1NU,"I think it's safe to say that we can separate serial killers into two categories--let's call them ""A"" and ""B""--when discussing their name recognition. Ted Bundy, John Wayne Gacy, Richard Speck, Jeffrey Dahmer, Henry Lee Lucas, Jack the Ripper, and Charles Starkweather would definitely fall in the former. Thanks to the media, the public is all too aware of these vicious killers. Numerous books, articles, documentaries, and movies describe their exploits in nauseating detail. The second tier murderers, no less appalling in their capacity to take human lives, would draw mostly blanks if you dropped their names into polite conversation. Albert Fish, Beck and Fernandez, William Bonin, and dozens of others fall into this category. One name that, until recently, also garnered blank stares was Dr. Herman W. Mudgett aka Henry Holmes aka H. H. Holmes. Thanks to a best-selling book entitled ""The Devil in the White City,"" Holmes is finally receiving his due. I haven't read Erik Larson's treatment, but I have read dozens of serial killer compilations over the years. Holmes made the grade in all of them. I decided to reacquaint myself with this monster recently by watching John Borowski's documentary ""H.H. Holmes: America's First Serial Killer.""

Borowski's production, which runs a scant sixty-four minutes, gives the viewer everything they ever wanted to know about this notorious butcher. Holmes grew up in New Hampshire in the 1860s and 1870s, a brilliant but troubled child who eventually attended medical school. After running an insurance scam involving stolen cadavers from school, Holmes disappeared for a number of years before popping up again in Chicago in 1885. Then the nightmares began in earnest. He bounced around the city running numerous scams and running up debts before beginning construction on an enormous mansion across the street from a drugstore he owned. An odd structure indeed, this castle, considering that it boasted close to sixty rooms and a most unusual floor plan. Moreover, Holmes continually hired and then fired workers laboring on the building. One reason was to get out of paying for services rendered. Another reason, and a far more ominous one considering what would soon take place in the mansion, was Holmes's fervent desire that no one but himself would now the ins and outs of the building's design. You see, Dr. Holmes had a specific purpose in mind for his new domicile, a purpose that involved trapdoors, slides, and a murder pit in the basement.

Over the next four years, Holmes lured dozens upon dozens of women to the castle. Some came to rent rooms from the good doctor, others seeking employment. No one really knows how many women H. H. Holmes killed. It is generally acknowledged what he did with the bodies, however. After dispatching a victim, the murderer would send their body down to the basement where pits full of acid and quicklime ensured that all traces of the corpse would vanish--after he sold the victims' skeletons to medical schools across the country, that is. Holmes's murderous career started to unravel after police arrested him for running a con in St. Louis. While in jail there he swindled famed train robber Marion Hedgepeth, a swindle that came back to bite him later on when Holmes reneged on a promise to pay the criminal money for securing legal assistance. Hedgepeth eventually rolled over on the doctor, reporting to the authorities an insurance scam Holmes planned on running once out of jail. The Pinkerton Detective Agency got involved in the case, and the rest, as they say, is history. The horrors of the Chicago mansion soon came to light, and H. H. Holmes eventually went to the gallows for his terrifying crimes.

Whew! Boy, am I leaving a bunch of stuff out! I could go on and on about H.H. Holmes, about his numerous affairs with women, his cons, and his treatment of the Pietzel family. The fact that Borowski managed to stuff this much information about Holmes's activities into sixty minutes is an impressive feat indeed. The documentary looks like something you might see on A&E or the History Channel. It shows us the pictures of places and people central to the story of Holmes, contains interviews with serial killer experts like Harold Schechter, boasts several black and white reenactments of significant events, and even has Tony Jay doing the narration. If you don't know this guy's name, don't worry; you'll certainly recognize his voice. He's one of Hollywood's premier voiceover talents, having worked on dozens upon dozens of shows, movies, and videogames. Definitely a great choice to tell the creepy story of one of America's worst serial killers! My only problem with the picture is the title. Sorry, but H.H. Holmes wasn't America's first serial killer. Jesse Pomeroy killed numerous victims several years before Holmes was born. Moreover, serial killers existed in Europe long before America became a country. Gilles de Rais and Elizabeth Bathory are just two examples.

Extras on the DVD consist of a commentary track with John Borowski, an informative making of featurette, several trailers, and a photo gallery showing how the places involved in Holmes's crimes have changed in the last hundred plus years. Good stuff. So why isn't Holmes as well known as Bundy, Starkweather, Gacy, and the rest? The documentary answers that question indirectly by having to rely on recreations of the crimes. Holmes operated in a time before television and film could capture the crime scene and the trial. Modern Americans need to see the horror, see the killer marching by on their television sets, for it to register. Nonetheless, I think Borowski's documentary does much to elevate Holmes to the ranks of the ""A"" grade serial killers.",1130630400,56,5748,5.060126582278481

I was thoroughly entertained but at the same time wished the film had been 20 minutes longer in order to get deeper into the story.  I wanted to know more about how the Pinkertons tracked down Holmes for starters.

If you're interested in true crime then this is a must see. John Borowski should make more (longer) documentaries like this.  Albert Fish, Peter Kurten and Jesse Pomeroy would all be perfect candidates.",1126828800,4,719,5.067796610169491

He lured strangers and friends alike to his chamber of horrors so he could kill them and sell their bodies to mortuaries and sell their bones for profit.

Borowski has done his research and takes the viewer on a journey into the dark annals of Chicago in the late-nineteenth century.

The eerie black and white re-enactments brings the case to life, with the suspense of the old monster films of the turn of the century. The haunting voice-over by esteemed actor Tony Jay gives the film it's final touch.

I look forward to future projects by John Borowski.

The research he did is an accomplishment in itself, and John just could not have presented the story better, I often felt like I was ""back in time"" while watching, because of his meticulous eye for detail.  The film flowed so well, better than most ""major motion pictures"" playing these days, and stuck to the facts of the story, which shows me just what a master John is in the art of film making, and in staying true to making a documentary.  I know the story backwards & forward and yet, I was literally on the edge of my seat watching the film!  And what can I say about Tony Jay?
