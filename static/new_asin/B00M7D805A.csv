6562743,1,B00M7D805A,One on the worst movies I've seen in a while. Totally absurd story line. There was a lot of swearing (even kids were swearing) for a Christmas Movie.,1415923200,3,149,4.357142857142857
6562744,5,B00M7D805A,"This is one of the very last movie Robin Williams was in before he left us(I think the very last one is the upcoming third Night at the Museum movie). Usually Christmas movies are not the best of movies when it comes to acting, script, and all those things that win movie awards. But the whole point of Christmas movies is to make us feel good, or at least better, and to put a smile on our faces.

So in that spirit, I just wanted to pay a further tribute to Robin and say I enjoyed this movie. I won't write any spoilers, but it's a typical Christmas/redemption story where Joe McHale tries to save Christmas for his son, because when he was a toddler, his own father(Williams) ruined his childhood experience in Christmas. Joe McHale might be the titular main character, but as in any movie that they are in, Robin Williams and Clark Duke steal the show. In this movie, Williams played an old deadbeat, grumpy father/grandfather with a penchant for bourbon and bad French, and Duke plays McHale's younger brother. Other noteworthy actors include Candice Bergen as Williams' not so square wife(I almost mistook her for Martha Stewart, whoops!), and a surprise but hilarious appearance from Oliver Platt.

Just be positive and enjoy one of Robin Williams' last on-screen performances. Happy Holidays, everyone!",1415577600,60,1311,4.79646017699115
6562745,1,B00M7D805A,"This movie is so bad, it's hard to know where to begin. The script stinks, the director stinks, the continuity is horrible. Case in point, the Christmas Eve dinner scene. While Joel McHale eats off his plate, the wide shot shows no other food on anyone's plates.

Most of the characters range from unlikable, rude and downright mean at best, to outright idiots at worst.  That the setting is Chicago/Wisconsin makes little sense, when the general attitude is one of southern good ol' boys. Filming was done near Atlanta, the setting should have been indicated as that region, as well.

Robin Williams, at least, maintains a constant throughout, while the others muddle about aimlessly. He is gruff and sarcastic, and, after realizing he has wronged his offspring, apologizes but doesn't really change. He and the young man who plays Douglas are the only two lights in this foolishness, and even that child suffers from poor direction in the end.",1415577600,6,945,4.930817610062893
6562766,4,B00M7D805A,"This was one of Robin Williams last films and although it isn't the very best of his movies, it is still one of the most heart warming and entertaining that he has done. Joel McHale is gold for me. I think he is one of those way under rated stars that should be getting more to do. He is the uptight son while robin is the eccentric and very odd dad that he hasn't seen for a long time. Well, he and his family are going to dad's for Christmas and he left his son's present at home which sets off the big trip back to retrieve it. It has definite funny moments and I did laugh quite a bit. I would recommend it for some fun viewing.",1481760000,,632,3.9453125

6562774,3,B00M7D805A,"I haven't seen a Robin Williams movie since he died, until this morning. Yes I watched a film in the a.m., I am in moderate-to-severe physical pain today, don't judge me. I was looking through Amazon Primes list of recommended films, which I am oft to do, typically just before I head over to Netflix and actually watch something. I was swiping along, yawning, and I saw his face representing some film I had never heard of, A Merry Friggin Christmasand I just stared at it for a while. I just stared at his face, looking into his eyes for a moment. I knew it was probably a s***ty movie (I looked it up mid-viewing to find the 16% fresh Rotten Tomatoes rating), I still felt compelled to watch it. About halfway through I realized The Family Stone this is not, but I love ensemble films, so I was willing enough to see it through to the end. As a side note, I love ensemble films so much, probably because of The Big Chill (which is one of my favorite films of all time). I also never fully realized how much I loved Robin.

When I was a young adult, Robin was in his prime, having successfully shifted from standup to television, and then from Mork to more promising film roles. Looking back, his performance in a film like Mrs. Doubtfire is a performance I now doubt any other actor could muster. I know it is a relatively unimportant cultural timepiece of a movie, but it is as good an example as any, of Robins ability, natural ability, to flesh out character depth with only the softness, kindness, and pain so visible now behind his eyes. Maybe I see their depth clearer now because I am more informed of what a kind man he washow generous he was in so many ways to so many people. Maybe it has something to do with my own mortality. Maybe I just miss the guy. But there is no denying his presence. Robin had depth of presence.

So it is not so sad really, that one of his final films is mostly a junker. It clunks along the well-travelled roads of the home-for-the-holidays films before it, making few if any original pit-stops along the way. Surprising really, if just for the cast, (the film stars an ensemble cast featuring Joel McHale, Lauren Graham, Clark Duke, Oliver Platt, Wendi McLendon-Covey, Tim Heidecker, Candice Bergen and Robin Williams). You cant ask for much better in casting a comedy, they just didn't have the roadmap to work with on this one. I cant recommend A Merry Friggin Christmas in good conscience, but I can offer this caveat: For me, watching this movie felt like getting a s***ty Christmas gift from someone you never knew how much you lovedso you love it tooif only because it was offered alongside those same thoughtful, brilliant, sparkling-blue eyes, that since his death, also serve you a moment of haunting sadness and thankful, somber regret.",1456876800,,2788,4.529761904761905

6562777,2,B00M7D805A,"We LOVE Robin Williams. He did a great job acting in this movie. However, if you are expecting a funny Christmas movie akin to National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (which is what the trailer kind of leads you to believe) it's not that. It's got a great cast but it's a pretty heavy handed tale about growing up with an alcoholic father and how one man overcompensates for his kids. We would probably not recommend this movie.",1454544000,3,426,4.618421052631579

The movie tried to be a little  bit of Bad Santa and Bad Grandpa but could not pull it off. Both Bad Santa and Bad Grandpa are fun movies to watch  Maybe my standards are to high but I thought the script, acting, and directing was was way below a good Christmas Movie.

6562992,4,B00M7D805A,"""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"" ushered in a wave of what I would characterize as anti-Christmas movies.  Films like ""Surviving Christmas"", ""Christmas With the Kranks"", and ""Four Christmases"" for better or for worse illustrated the down side of the holiday usually focusing on dysfunctional families getting together with tension and mayhem ensuing.  Though not as warm and fuzzy as ""A Christmas Story"" I'm hesitant to lump this film with that dubious company.  There's actual poignance regarding the disconnect between the boozing cantankerous father (Robin Williams) and his workaholic hedge fund broker son (Joel McHale).  Fingers aren't pointed with blame allocated equally between the combatants.  Beyond the cynicism demonstrated by Williams' character lies melancholy and regret that he didn't do enough for his brood.  I also liked Candice Bergen's turn as the clan matriarch who dispenses sage advice and TLC along with beer with tomato juice.  I wouldn't label this film a holiday staple but it does offer some food for thought",1419120000,2,1045,5.49375

6562995,2,B00M7D805A,"I was hoping the film would be a fun one, but this was such a downer in so many respects that I am thoroughly disappointed.  The cast, all fine actors, never gel.  I never believed that McHale and Graham were a happy married couple; likewise Candace Bergen seems unable to relate to Robin Williams...and anyone else. The line readings are so flat that there's no spirit in this film, it's as if everyone hired was so bored that they couldn't muster any energy, especially the director.  Sad that this is among Williams' final films as it's not one to savor at all. I love a majority of the cast but the lack of Christmas spirit puts this among the least enjoyable holiday movies ever.",1418947200,6,684,4.5

6563022,5,B00M7D805A,"This move is not for everyone. However, I liked ""A Merry Friggin' Christmas."" Robin Williams as Virgil Mitchler plays the role of an unhappy, bitter, cranky man. This is just a cover for his true feelings. Virgil's life has been nothing spectacular as he has owned his own porta potty business for decades. Virgil lives through the successes of his son. His daughter is married to a sex offender and is in denial. Virgil's grandchildren each have unique, distinct personalities and quirks. If you want to see Robin Williams in a role completely different from comedy, you will enjoy this movie. It is a little heartbreaking as it was released after the death of Robin Williams. The movie is very short. Just over an hour and fifteen minutes.",1418688000,,741,4.796875
6563023,3,B00M7D805A,"Did anyone notice the back of the box... in the recap of the movie... it says ""in a blizzard""? Not to be a spoiler, but there was specifically mentioned, no snow (they talked/joked about ""Global Warming""). What's up with that????

Like so many others, I watched ""A Merry Friggin' Christmas"" as a nod to Robin. I think I saw his own inner sadness peek out of this character's eyes in a couple scenes. Would have loved to have seen him release his comic energy and really let ""Mitch"" go ""Mork"" wild. Perhaps he didn't have the personal energy to give to Mitch. Either way, I hope Robin has found peace now and can feel some of the love he was numb to during his life.",1418601600,,665,4.32

The film has a good plot line and could have really driven home some ""road trip"" humor, but falls flat.  They try to handle too many plot lines which draws away from the best.  Acting was good -- Candice Bergen is exceptional.  If they would have cut the off-the-wall kids sections where the kids go from being asleep to being loud and rambunctious, and put that time on the interaction of the road trip and give some more struggles besides just getting stopped by the same police officer over and over again, the movie could be a 4 star.",1418256000,,611,4.4774774774774775

6563063,3,B00M7D805A,"The only reason I watched this was to see Robin Williams in one of his very last performances. I'm glad I watched it for him because he was the worthwhile part of this movie. Williams was really very physically ill, plus mentally, in this last year+ of his life. His brain was being assaulted on many levels. He had Parkinson's. He had Lewy Bodies on his brain, which is a form of dementia. Plus he had mental illness. Which is why I have to give this movie the three stars just for his performance even though I didn't like the rest of it. To think that someone could be this ill yet have enough talent to manage to make final acting performances ~ it is nothing short of miraculous that he managed it. Not only did he pull it off, he was the best part of the film!

The rest of this film is so predictable. It is about this father who has to drive back home to get his son's gifts while working out his problems with his Dad, Williams. I could barely watch this though when Williams was off camera and we had to go to other scenes. They were poorly written and badly acted. Without Williams I might be one of the many people here to go for one or two stars.

If you really miss Williams, as I do, you will want to see this despite its many other lacks.

6563064,4,B00M7D805A,I enjoyed this film because it was not only funny but had heart and drama. It isn't one of those sappy pappy movies but one where you can just watch it and enjoy it. Lots of big name stars in it.,1417478400,,195,3.7804878048780486

And comments posted by people saying that it had poor acting or a weak story-line, obviously don't know what a good, heart-warming movie is. I come from a household with high christian-moral standards, and most of the time we do not like to watch movies with cussing or drinking, but I bet if my mother saw this she would love it. Not for any vulgarities in it, but for the message about christmas it brings. Robin Williams, and was and still is my childhood hero when it comes to acting. To me this a testament of just that!",1417219200,,646,4.30327868852459

6563099,1,B00M7D805A,"One of the worst movies I've ever seen, especially for a ""holiday"" movie. The acting was generally poor and some of the lines were strange. This movie shows just whats wrong with America today.....dysfunctional families. I found myself aching for the end of this movie. Had I been alone while watching it and not gathered with family for Thanksgiving, I would have gladly shut it off half way through. I personally don't see how anyone could consider this movie to be a good one, but then again seeing how much America has decayed since 2008 or so, it might be a best seller.",1417046400,,575,4.592233009708738

6563104,4,B00M7D805A,I agree with Miranda Thomason; this is a good story about family coming together at Christmas. The cast is great and the laughs are generously written throughout the entire movie... watch & enjoy.,1416787200,,196,4.96969696969697
6563105,3,B00M7D805A,"""Get in the truck Gladys, we've got Christmas to save."" Boyd (McHale) has just learned that he will be spending Christmas with his father Mitch (Williams) and the rest of his family. What should be a happy time becomes stressful for everyone when Boyd realizes that he left his son's presents at home. After his car breaks down Mitch and Boyd set out on a road trip to save Christmas. I've thought of ways to start this review without starting with the obvious but I can't. Robin Williams was my 2nd favorite actor (behind Al Pacino) and I was devastated at the news. That both helps and hurt the movie. I think it helps because (right or wrong) the movie will get more exposure than it probably would have got otherwise. On the other hand it is impossible to watch this without thinking of what happened and that takes you out of the movie. All that said I thought the movie was very funny and I recommend it, but the comedy is hurt knowing that this is one of the last times you will get to see the genius of Robin Williams at work. Seeing him play a crotchety old man paired with the McHale who plays a father trying way to hard is a perfect combination and the chemistry really works. This is one of those movies where things seem to just get worse and worse but at the same time funnier and funnier. Every member of the family adds something different and that makes it very fun to watch. Overall, a movie that is very funny but contains an unintentional tinge of sadness. I give it a B.",1416700800,16,1492,4.332142857142857
6563116,3,B00M7D805A,"As one of the final movies we'll see Robin Williams in, I was eager to watch A Merry Friggin' Christmas. It has quite a cast. Lauren Graham (Parenthood), Candice Bergen (Murphy Brown), Joel McHale (Community), Clark Duke (KIck Ass 2), and many others you may recognize.

If you come into this movie expecting a family comedy for the holidays, you will be greatly disappointed. This is darker with many adult situations and a family that is about as dysfunctional as they get.

Joel McHale and Lauren Graham are a married couple living in Chicago. McHale hasn't returned to his family home in a long time because his dad (Williams) was always a bit of an emotionally abusive jerk. When McHale's brother (Duke) calls to say he's become a father and wants everyone to gather in Wisconsin for the baptism, McHale is trapped. They're going to have to return to the family home for Christmas.

Once in Wisconsin, things don't start off well. There is tension between McHale and Williams, and McHale's mom (Bergen) wants everyone to get along as she hasn't seen her son or grandkids in quite some time. Everyone seems to do their best until it's revealed that McHale and Graham forgot to pack their son's Christmas presents. McHale has the night to race back to Chicago, get the presents, and get back before their son wakes up. Williams ends up joining him on this race against time.

The humor is dark and focuses a lot on the dysfunctional family's past and present. It's the underlying emotion that got to me. Williams has been a lousy father, but there's also a tenderness that presents itself at surprising times.

Graham and Bergen stay behind and bond as well, and it's nice to see two strong actresses paired together for some equally touching scenes.

I won't say this is Williams best role, but it's one that by the end put a tear in my eye.",1416700800,6,1845,4.661538461538462
6563117,5,B00M7D805A,"This was the first movie I've been able to watch since Robins passing and it was well worth seeing. Once again I am astounded by the many characters he played so well and the true depth of his craft. Being immortalized forever in all the movies I grew up watching him in will never be the same.
I am happy with my choice in making this my first since he's moved on. I related as I am sure many others will as well. There were times of sadness, laughter and forgiveness. Pretty much the holidays in general. Merry Christmas in the real world.",1416441600,14,541,4.262135922330097

6563120,1,B00M7D805A,"Too bad there is not an option to rate a movie on the other side of one star e.g., minus one through five stars because this stinker rates a minus five stars at least.  As others have noted, this was a total waste of the cumulative talent(s) of the stars especially Robin Williams.  The title alone was enough to turn me off.  Seems like some groups like to slam the word Christmas and/or anything the word has represented for over two-thousand years at every opportunity.  Go figure.  Don't waste your money on this DVD.  It is pure skunk.",1416355200,4,540,4.459183673469388
6563121,3,B00M7D805A,"Boyd (Joel McHale) runs a successful hedge fund in Chicago. He is on the neat and orderly side, raising his children in a slightly sheltered world. His brother Nelson (Clark Duke) has requested he come home to Wisconsin to be the Godparent to the boy that was left to him by his wife and her Latino ballplayer lover. Nelson also suffers from PTSD he got while he was still in training. The rest of the dysfunctional family includes Dad (Robin Williams) who drinks too much and has a rough exterior. There is also his sister Shauna (Wendi McLendon-Covey) who is married to ""the pervert""  (Tim Heidecker) and blames her mother(Candice Bergen) for her low self esteem. Their kids are unruly too.

The scenes tried to be clever but didn't seem well developed. I would watch something and say, that could be funny, but it really wasn't funny here and now. The film seemed like it was running with a ""check engine"" light.

Not for kids. No sex or nudity. No f-bombs that I recall, but there was a bunch of name calling and swearing and bad ideas to give kids.

Note: Friggin' comes from the goddess Frigg or Friga. It is slang for female masturbation and became a substitute for the F-bomb.",1416182400,3,1184,4.570754716981132

6563123,1,B00M7D805A,"Yikes this movie was awful.  What a waste of Robin Williams, Lauren Graham, Candice Bergen, and Joel McHale's talents. If you want a better dysfunctional family holiday story, try The Fitzgerald's Family Christmas or Home For the Holidays.",1416096000,2,239,5.2894736842105265
6563124,1,B00M7D805A,"This was a waste of time! The movie is a little under an hour and a half long which thankfully is the best and only saving grace of this film.

The storyline was decent, but the execution was poor and the characters had zero chemistry. Joel McHale is a terrible actor, and has zero comedic timing. Robin Williams mailed it in and seemingly only knew how to play an angry bitter man in the roles leading to his unfortunate demise. Honestly, there was no character development (characters were shallow and unrealistic, even for a goofy comedy's standard), the movie had cliched jokes and bits, robbing every holiday movie possible, and the direction was absolutely garbage.

This is a story about a son who had Christmas ruined as a child by his drunken father, and since then is OCD about making his children believe as long as possible so they do not suffer his fate growing up. Things occur that cause him to have Christmas with his parents and siblings, and there in lies the movie. A road trip occurs forcefully which leads to alone time with his father (convenient) and bonding occurs....I think!

Please take my advice, rent Hot Tub Time Machine, Elf, National Lampoons Christmas Vacation, or some movie that is actually funny. Avoid this movie like the plague that it is!
