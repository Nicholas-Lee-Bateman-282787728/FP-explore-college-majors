8026018,5,B0002C9DIG,"As with ""Chariots of Fire"" this is a race film and a race film. It is the old west and Frank Hopkins hides the fact that he is half Native American. His horse, a mustang must live with his not so thoroughbred ancestry exposed. Both have something to prove. They chose an endurance race to prove it.

This follows the formula stories, with challenges, unscrupulous competitors, and a baptism by fire that would make Joseph Campbell proud. We know what will happen including the outcome but it is the journey that we played to watch and it is delivered.

Omar Sharif is at the top of his form and added greatly to the story.",1499040000,,622,4.447368421052632
