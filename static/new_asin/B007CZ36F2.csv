Beautiful Wave is primarily a chick flick, filled with a little action, some heartache, secrets, plenty of drama and beautiful scenery.
Nicole (Aimee Teegarden of Friday Night Lights) reluctantly spends a summer with her grandmother (Patricia Richardson of Home Improvement).
Nicole's father died when she was a young girl by drowning. Since that time she's had a fear of water, even though she is a great swimmer, and spends most of her time wrapped in a book.
She slowly begins to warm to her free spirited grandmother, whose own husband never came back from Vietnam.
On beknown to the two women, the grandfather Jimmy (Lance Henriksen of Pumpkinhead) is alive living far down in Mexico where he and a comrade save sea turtles from pouchers.
The grandmother gives an old 1962 surf van to Nicole, that belonged to the grandfather she never knew. Armed with that, a map that shows surfing locations including one called Beautiful Wave, loads up with three friends and begins an adventure.
The crew includes Kayla (Alicia Ziegler) the surf shop manager, who helps the grandmother, Jeff (Ben Milliken) who has a thing for Nicole and Danny (David Thomas Jenkins), Jeff's best friend and the bad boy of the bunch.
Most guys will find Beautiful Wave boring. Most girls will find it charming. I liked it primarily because of the vintage van, cool scenery and a great soundtrack filled with wispy seldom-heard beach music.",1340150400,4,1472,4.959514170040486
5078873,3,B007CZ36F2,If you watched Soul surfer you will be bored by this as the pace is slow by comparison. If you have not then it will be ok.  Its about a girl living in her past a lot and taking up surfing. Some of the acting is really very good I must say just a pity the story is so slow and the surfing rather beginner level throughout.,1339459200,2,322,3.8059701492537314
5078874,5,B007CZ36F2,"""Beautiful wave"" is a charming indie film.  Gorgeous scenery. Awesome journey in a vintage turquoise van. Great soundtrack. Tender storyline about a girl's facing up to her fears, finding herself, and reconnecting with her family.

If you're expecting an action-packed, slick Hollywood surf film, then you might not get into it. But if you're in the mood for a sweet meander, with heart and a deep sense of place, then I think you'll fall in love with it.",1337299200,2,455,4.82051282051282
5078875,2,B007CZ36F2,"""Life's a lot easier if you let go of whatever is holding you back."" Nicole (Teegarden) is sent by her mom to Santa Cruz for the summer to live with her grandmother. At first she resents the fact that she has to go but soon changes her mind after meeting new friends...and the sport of surfing. After watching ""Soul Surfer"" I was actually more excited to see this then I normally would have been. I knew it wasn't going to be like that but I wasn't looking forward to ""Soul Surfer"" the first time either and that surprised me with how good it was. After 20 minutes I realized how wrong I was in my expectations. For those that have seen the movie ""Surfer, Dude"" this is more comparable to that one then this one. No real plot to speak of, or really surfing for that matter. Again though I know this movie is not made for me so I may be being to hard on it but to me this was boring and seemed to have no point. Although if I was a teenage girl I may feel different about it. Overall, a movie that I thought was boring but also it wasn't made for me. I say C.",1336089600,3,1058,4.042857142857143
5078876,5,B007CZ36F2,Its a very good family type movie. She goes out on a trip with some friends once she saw the van her grandpa use to have and the papers he leaves in the van.,1415923200,,157,3.6470588235294117
5078877,5,B007CZ36F2,"Purchased for my daughter, great movie, very inspirational",1411862400,,58,6.375
5078878,5,B007CZ36F2,Wonderful movie! It's true that Vietnam War changed young men and women after they came home forever haunted and never same again even to this day.  Beautiful Wave is wonderful movie with great surf songs from '60's & '70's,1384300800,2,223,4.717948717948718
5078879,3,B007CZ36F2,"Its the kind of movie that once you start it you have to finish it to see what happens. The story follows the lives of two related parties. The granddaughter and the grandfather. It is hard to take your attention off the movie until you find out how and if their two stories will connect at the end. The ocean scenes are just beautiful though, the waves look like so much fun!",1380499200,,376,4.236111111111111
5078880,2,B007CZ36F2,"In ""Beautiful Wave"" Aimee Teegarden is a 17-year-old New York girl Nicole, who has to spend the summer in Santa Cruz where her estranged grandmother Sue (Patricia Richardson) lives. Sue gives Nicole an old surf van that Sue's boyfriend (and Nicole's grandfather) Jimmy owned. With three newly acquainted friends Jeff (Ben Milliken), Kayla (Alicia Ziegler) and Danny (David Thomas Jenkins), Nicole hits the road looking for the places on the map that she found in the van.

Helen Slater plays Nicole's mother Jane. Prolific veteran Lance Henriksen appears as ""Baja Man,"" a surfer and environmentalist protecting sea turtle eggs from poachers.

""Beautiful Wave"" is part surf movie, part road movie (covering from California to Mexico), part coming-of-age film where the heroine finds herself, and even attempts to be a romance, but fails to truly be any of them. The problem is simple: the script. The story is contrived and implausible. Paper-thin characters make unnatural decisions just to keep the plot going. Heavy-handed direction from David Mueller doesn't help.

The photography is beautiful and the surf scenes are decent if not outstanding, but to make a more emotionally involving drama we need something more than that.",1375401600,,1229,5.292307692307692
5078881,3,B007CZ36F2,"Another actress who is very beautiful and talented.
Would watch any movie she stared in, even one's like this that she produced.",1374192000,,128,4.863636363636363
5078882,1,B007CZ36F2,"Beautiful Wave has flaws all over the place.  It's one major flaw!  It's about a teenage girl who apparently lacks motivation and has low self-esteem.  She has to find a way to spend her precious time, so... she hooks up with a couple surfer guys, takes a trip to the ocean, learns how to ride the waves by herself because the guys are too busy flirting with other girls to really teach her anything, and this results in a large chunk of the storyline being downright boring, miserable and uninteresting.  It's a really awful film.

The only enticing part is when the gang ends up crossing the border and has to deal with a couple barely understandable border patrolmen who'd like nothing more than to arrest a bunch of kids that certainly look like they're up to no good.  Right from the get go you can tell it's a low budget movie because there's an eerie silence in the background in between lines that makes it feel more like a high school play.

So what IS this supposed to be about?  The girl is supposed to travel around with a map to uncover family secrets but trust me, there's NO adventure occurring whatsoever.  At least, not during the first half when practically nothing at all happens.  Beautiful Wave is too bland and doesn't deliver a worthwhile enough storyline to contain any adventure.  A must skip.",1363305600,2,1318,4.56595744680851
5078883,5,B007CZ36F2,You think this is a story about a teenage girl's coming of age. I feel it is a love story across time and I'd highly recommend it! Lance Henriksen is excellent in this!,1355702400,,168,4.121212121212121
