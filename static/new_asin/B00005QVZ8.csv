1649887,4,B00005QVZ8,"This is a movie with a message for young children: ""You can do anything you set your mind to.""
The movie is rated PG which is a good thing because even a PG-13 rating would exclude the target audience, that is children too young to notice how ridicules some of the situations are. However, I enjoyed the movie even though I am way out of the target age range. With a little more thought and work, I think this could have been a great family film, but alas they stuck with the simplistic approach.
I was also disappointed that they did not have closed captions or subtitles for the hearing impaired, although the sound track is fine therefore most people will have no trouble understanding everything said and the target audience is probably still learning to read.
Generally speaking, I would say that if your children are over about nine, you might want to look for a more mature movie.",1402012800,5,887,4.55
1649888,1,B00005QVZ8,"This movie was so horribly filmed and made. The videography was totally grainy. I recommend that you should only watch this movie for the sake of laughing at it's flaws. It seems as if the actors are blind, and cannot see anything eye level. Also, it is violent too! Alas, it is embarrassing to have fallen for the cute preview and actually spend money on it because that was $4 that we regret spending.",1315440000,5,403,4.45945945945946
1649889,5,B00005QVZ8,"This movie is very cute. I wish they had a bigger budget to make it not so cheesy. I love the kid who played Reese! Absolutely ADORABLE! I wish I could've seen him in more things. He played the perfect ""Cool Kid""! Overall pretty cheesy movie but I thought it was cute!",1271116800,6,268,4.173076923076923
1649890,1,B00005QVZ8,"This movie was insulting to viewers of all ages.  It essentially mocked the intelligence of anyone watching it.  The ""writers"" and producers did not even bother trying to cover up the strikingly glaring holes in logic and sequencing.  Our 7 and 9 year old children both concluded quickly that this was ""the dumbest movie"" they had ever seen.  Not only that, it looked as if it was filmed in a city park and the ""action"" was as exciting as watching butter melt on a kitchen counter.  Movies for kids often have a formula to follow but this one just settled for making the outline of the formula and assuming the audience was ignorant enough to go along with them.  Well, it doesn't work that way.  I feel sorry for the adult actors in the movie since their careers would have to be impaired by the greedy ""felony""
now on their resumes.  I strongly advise staying away from this ""film"".  Any family could do better by making their own home movie.",1019520000,4,944,4.5058823529411764

7950958,3,B00005QVZ8,"I will admit that while this is NOT aimed at anyone older than my socks, the
under-9 target-audience will stay awake long enough to get to the end-credits.
If I was to be HONEST, this film doesn't have a major studio LOOK or FEEL
to it, but... its HEART is in the right place. An enjoyable back-shelf addition.",1472515200,,310,4.362068965517241
