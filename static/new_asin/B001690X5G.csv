3154437,5,B001690X5G,"I teach 11th Grade American Literature, and one of our in class novels is ""Their Eyes Were Watching God"".  I've seen every Zora Hurston biography that I could possibly find, and this film is absolutely the BEST.  Unlike the recent PBS American Experience bio, the personal interviews and antecdotes in Zora's Roots paint an engaging, fascinating, and entertaining picture of this famous author.  I highly recommend it to any literature teacher.",1213142400,13,444,5.225352112676056
3154438,4,B001690X5G,"I knew Zora was impressive, but I didn't know she was the first Black student to attend Barnard.  I knew she traveled, but I never knew how much of the North American Black diaspora she'd seen.  The work never uses the term ""anti-classist"" or ""anti-elitist.""  Still, it comes through how much Zora was willing to embrace the have-nots of society.

Having said all that, they do point to questionable matters.  They quote her saying, ""I felt as good as the first time you realize you have pubic hair!""  They do not shy away from her potentially strange disapproval of the 1954 ""Brown v. Bd. of Ed."" decision.  They allude to how all of her romantic relationships seemed to have been terribly short-lived.

Oftentimes, people equate the present with the past to get others interested.  A recent documentary on Walt Whitman showed drawings of New York City in the 1800s and juxtaposed them with video of that city today, for example.  Well, on that note, Zora Neale is a lot like Whoopi Goldberg.  Both women were highly celebrated, but highly controversial.  Both women had some foot-in-mouth concerns.  Both women made statements that seem highly contrary to most Blacks' positions on civil rights and racial justice.

The work has a diverse group of interviewees.  Unlike many documentaries where only one biographer is seen, it felt like every ZNH biographer was seen here.  Too, they showed living people who knew the author, so you get the sense of what she would have looked like had she lived longer.  The reenactments done here weren't so cheesy as to be grating on yuh nerves.  They chose a dark-skinned actor to portray Langston Hughes.  I love when Black actors of any hue can get work.  However, LH prided himself on being part-Native American.  He was noticeably light-skinned.  I think that's why biracial Daniel Sunjata was chosen to play him in ""Brother to Brother.""  So this documentary does skew actual history to a small extent.

I think this work does say ZNH was buried in an unmarked grave.  However, I always got the sense that she died penniless and unknown.  This work suggests that she died as a retired teacher who was not poverty-stricken.  It showed a man who knew that keeping her paperwork around was important.

This might be a perfect tool for encouraging young, Black girls who want to be writers or work for the stage.  It's also an ideal viewing tool for Black History Month.",1212537600,9,2409,4.793187347931873

8261661,5,B001690X5G,"This film was fantastic. It truly does capture the life and time of Zora N. Hurston. I highly recommend it to any educator of History, English, or Folklore Studies/ Anthropology",1356998400,,177,4.933333333333334
8261662,5,B001690X5G,This documantary enhanced the love I have had for Ms. Hurston.  I learned this about her that has never been presented in most of the books about her life.  There were a couple of minor mistakes but overall very informative.,1317859200,,224,4.575
8261663,3,B001690X5G,"This is a PBS documentary about Zora Neale Hurston.  I found it a bit dry, factual but lacking references or footage about some of her very interesting work, collecting folk tales, dances & songs.  The movie (Hollywood style) My Name is Zora, provides better visibility into that part of her life.",1270080000,,297,4.803921568627451
8261664,2,B001690X5G,"I was disappointed.  The documentary is superficial, slow paced, boring, and the facts it covers could have been handed out on a piece of paper--the visuals don't add much at all. No exciting clips from the movie version of Their Eyes were Watching God--just an outline of her biography.  Uninspired to the max.  Compared to other documentaries on African American authors, like _Ralph Ellison: An American Journey_ and _Richard Wright: Black Boy_, this one wasn't worth the time to watch.",1240617600,2,489,5.0875
8261665,5,B001690X5G,"Well-written Documentary describing the stages of Zora Neale Hurston's Life. The director, Tom Lowe, chose 5 women from teen to mature to portray Zora's life. The artistic blending of scenery, music and narration creates a story for all ages.
