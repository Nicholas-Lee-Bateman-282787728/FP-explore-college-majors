681224,5,6303566405,"GERRIT GRAHAM (NATIONAL LAMPOON'S CLASS REUNION) stars in this wacky science fiction horror about a high-tech television satellite that tunes in real-life horror!
Television will never be the same for the Putterman family. Stanley Putterman (GRAHAM) installs a state-of-the-art satellite dish in his backyard. Through a cosmic accident, a wayward monster's energy is beamed across galaxies, into the satellite and onto the Puttermans' television set. The Puttermans don't notice any changes, only better reception and a strange monster continually appearing on the screen. But when the monster leaps off the screen and into the Puttermans' living room-terror erupts. The monster needs to feed on humans for its survival.

681421,4,6303566405,"What a funky film.
I rented this when it first came to vhs and found it kind wired and left me feeling somewhat grimey.
Watching this film 3 decades later, I'm impressed with how well the social tropes and super fades of the 80s were so well lampooned and derided in this movie.
A definite reflection of the decadence and consumption of 80s America showing the fading free-sex and swinger mentality of the 70s against the unspoken fear brought on by the rise of AIDS, the massive embrace of Erotica as art, the ever presence of cable tv and its influence on teenage role models, donning without questioning the why and, finally, the monster of it, the Hungry Beast a creature of curiosity and insatiable appetite.

681555,1,6303566405,"Where to begin, where to begin? This is quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of terrible movies in my day-- I kind of pride myself on owning many 'bad' movies, but this one just goes above and beyond bad, and it's not something I'm proud to have in my Amazon Instant Video collection.

""TerrorVision"" cycles back and forth between family friendly, lighthearted comedy and gory ultraviolence. It's this confused tone that sets the palate for the rest of the movie. It seems to want to be an homage to the cheesy sci-fi movies of the 1950s, but it falls so hard on its face it hurts. It's not funny, the special effects aren't that good, the characters are annoying and unlikable and it uses some sort of set dressing technique that gives the movie this out of place out of body feel that has no place in a movie of its kind. It's just a complete wreck, and not in a good way. If you're looking for cheese or schlock, look elsewhere, because this movie fails at even the most basic of bad movie principles.

For comparison, I saw a movie many years ago that is now largely marketed with this one called ""The Video Dead,"" a little known piece of American-Eurocinema that suffered from a similar set of symptoms that ""TerrorVision"" exhibits, but nowhere near on the same level of ""TerrorVision."" That movie, ""The Video Dead"" featured what I believe to be a largely European cast and crew pretending to be American working off of a script written by people writing what they must have figured life in America was like. ""TerrorVision"" comes at us from a similar angle, and yet the crew here is largely American, featuring American cast members like Diane Franklin (who was awesome in ""Amityville II: The Possession,"") Gerrit Graham, probably best known for his one time role as a member of the Q Continuum on an episode of ""Star Trek Voyager"" and Mary Woronov, aka Calamity Jane from ""Death Race 2000,"" -- two New Yorkers and a Floridian in a movie that's supposed to be about the American suburbs or whatever surrealist take on them this movie misguidedly displays in a script that feels appropriately like it was written by aliens watching 1950s sci-fi movies.

There is no excuse for this movie, absolutely no excuse for its existence. Like I said, the characters are unlikable and annoying and furthermore it suffers from a bipolar tone that makes me feel like it was directed by three people passing it back and forth like a sixth grade game of telling a story by having one person write the beginning, another write the middle and yet another person write the ending. Nothing in this movie makes sense, from its surrealist portrait of upper class suburbanites to its depiction of the American teenager being a stereotypical ""Return of the Living Dead"" punk-- a stereotype that I'm pretty sure was grossly exaggerated even by 1980s standards. And we keep shifting from the family friendly stuff with the kid and his grandfather to the weird, psychedelic stuff like the ""Society"" like scenes of the dead bodies in bed having what can only be assumed to be a mock-orgy.

I wish I could get a refund for this piece of insufferable trash, but unfortunately I bought the ticket and took the ride and now it's a stain on my Amazon Instant Video collection forever. That's something that really irks me, too. Now whenever I scroll through my movies on Amazon Instant Video I'm going to go by THIS, a cringeworthy piece of inexplicably greenlit insufferable trash made by incompetent filmmakers with no sense of why they were making a movie, just knowing that they were going to produce something.

I wish I could give it a zero out of five, avoid it at all costs.",1466553600,,3685,4.654377880184332

682048,4,6303566405,"Talk about the crap coming out of TV!  The garbage that makes its electronic way into the Putterman household via their brand new Do-It-Yourself 100 satellite dish is just that, the refuse of a faraway planet converted to energy and blasted way across interstellar space.  Most unfortunately indeed, the end result is a large, slavering, gooey monster able to electronically jump into and out of all the television sets in the Putterman house.  Little Sherman (Chad Allen) tries to warn his family and get help from the police, but no one believes a kid raving about a monster coming out of the television and eating people.  His parents are particularly uninterested in their son's latest ""episode,"" having just brought a couple of swingers home with them.  Even local late-night horror movie hostess Medusa (Jennifer Richards), who should know more than most about monsters, doesn't believe Sherman when he calls her for help.  Of course, the fact that the monster can quickly regurgitate its recent meals into mostly-human form makes it hard for Sherman to convince anyone that he's telling the truth.  The only other voice of reason is Pluthar, the head sanitation engineer of the alien planet, but everyone just thinks his urgent warning coming over the television is a really boring movie.

Of course, this isn't really a monster movie, as the monster is mostly an excuse for Charles Band and friends to bring together some of the kookiest characters imaginable and just let them do their thing.  You've got Grampa (Bert Rensen), a military survivalist fanatic who has taken it upon himself to spread the word on lizard tail jerky - it's the ultimate survivalist food because you can just keep on eating the tails that the lizards grow back.  Then there's Stanley (Gerrit Graham) and Raquel Putterman (Mary Woronov), who have made their home a veritable erotic pleasure dome for the practice of swinging.  Heck, Sherman's punk rock sister Suzy (Diane Franklin) and her mentally challenged heavy metal boyfriend O.D. (Jonathan Gries) have more going on upstairs than all of the adults - and just wait and see what kinds of crazy things these two do with the monster.  The whole plot is really just too bizarre for me to even try and describe.

This low-budget, thoroughly 1980s horror-comedy extravaganza has attracted quite a devoted following over the years.  I can't say I embrace Terrorvision with quite that level of enthusiasm, but it's definitely good for a number of laughs.  This thing has cult classic written all over it, and you know what that means - you're either going to love it or hate it.",1315872000,,2611,4.929223744292237

682130,4,6303566405,"Since Sid's been on an above average horror B run we figured to keep burning the midnight oil with yet another Charles Band directed flick. Terrorvision is straight out of the 80's, right out the thang, with a nice combination of sleeze/sci-fi & B all wrapped into one. Sure this movie will only apply to a very specific audience, but really what Sid pick is ever designed for the mainstream audience? What's refreshing about the film is it knows that it's horrible and just goes with the flow. Because of that reason, Terrorvision is like a party in your mouth and everyone's invited.

From the start of the movie the 80's is almost too prevalent to where you question what decade your currently in. Naturally if your baked then it really messes with your brain. It's centered around the Putterman family (YOU PUTZ!) as they're riding the technological wave with their shiny new satellite dish. It's not as big as the one behind 7-11 that young Sid used to throw rocks and pine cones at, but it was pretty close. Anyway their feed winds up picking up a signal from a distant planet forcing an alien creature to come through the tv. Yeah it's as awesome as it sounds. As the family tries to battle the man eating blob quite a bit of havoc ensues with more B then most could handle.

Overall Terrorvision delivered more then what was even expected. A nice touch aka a nice mix came from the Putterman parents who were complete sex machines attempting to throw a little swingers party at the house. Their overly perved out behavior was something Sid had a good laugh over, as it reminded us of a buddy we used to make up stories about. For some reason we'd make him out to be a little crazed horndog and the parents brought that all back to us. Terrorvision had to be a movie done by Joe Bob at some portion of his illustrious B viewing career. But if not at least Sid brought it into the library which is just as good as a Joe Bob recommendation.",1298419200,,1945,4.445378151260504
682131,3,6303566405,"A rogue signal from space unleashes monsters and mayhem out of a kooky family's TV set in 1986's TERRORVISION! Charles Band and Empire Pictures deliver this zany Horror Comedy from another dimension, featuring make-up and special effects work by GHOULIES designer John Carl Buechler. Ted Nicolaou uses the film's silly premise to poke fun at 80's pop-culture, playfully ripping on everyone from Cyndi Lauper, E.T., and Elvira while paying homage to Science Fiction classics like the Japanese space epic THE MYSTERIANS and INVADERS FROM MARS. Despite all of the on-screen insanity, a deeper message can be found behind the action and gore that speaks against the destruction of the family unit as a result of television's gripping hold. Each of the characters ham it up as the plot takes one ridiculous turn after another. The giant googly-eyed monster for which the film is most fondly remembered liquidates its victims before slurping them up with its monstrous tongue. TERRORVISION's gooey deaths and off-the-wall humor make it a campy cult-classic that 80's fans are sure to enjoy!

682194,4,6303566405,"If it were possible for a complete parody to be called original, ""Terrorvision"" (1986) would be the first to qualify. This is another cheap Albert and Charles Band (Empire Studios) production, but is not as mindless as something like ""Redneck Zombies"" and even has a bit of lyrical (yet very silly) charm. Everyone involved is obviously having a good time and the creature is much like something Richard Carlson would have encountered in a 1950's sci-fi film, but with much more slime. Not until ""The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra"" would there be a more self-aware genre parody. Although rated ""R"" because of some off-color humor, it would not be worth denying middle schoolers the pleasure of viewing this film because the overall style and effect is best appreciated by that age group.

Sherman Putterman is your standard alien monster film kid who has seen a monster but can't get anyone else to believe him. His grandpa (Bert Remsen in the film's best performance) is a survivalist promoting his lizard tail jerky product (the perfect food because lizards' tails grow back and you can eat it again) and hiding out in his well-stocked fallout shelter.

Sherman's swinging parents are Gerrit Graham (who played superstitious car salesman Jeff in ""Used Cars"") and Mary Woronov (""Eating Raoul"").

1980's teen queen Diane Franklin plays Sherman's sister Suzy and Jon Gries (of ""Pretender"" fame) is her boyfriend ""O.D."" who is really into heavy metal music. Franklin is almost unrecognizable in her mid-1980's ""Girls Just Want to Have Fun"" look.

Although the parody is primarily directed at the excessive cuteness of ""ET"", ""Terrorvision"" also goes after Elvira and Vampira with a similiar late night horror show hostess called Medusa who wears a wig of snakes, has two enormous talents, and manages a host(ess) of semi-explicit puns.

The real star is an alien house pet whose mutation into a hungry beast forced its owners to send its atoms out into space. The film begins on a distant planet where this mutated pet is being processed at the mutated creature facility. A stray planet causes the creatures atoms to deflect through space until it finally is sucked down to earth by Sherman's father's new satellite dish.

By the middle of the film the monster has chewed and sucked its way through most of the family and their friends when Sherman, Suzy, and OD have an ""ET"" moment with it. The monster can mimic anyone it has eaten so the other cast members have a couple of post- demise scenes.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1169424000,2,2536,4.870069605568445

I still can't believe this movie is not out yet on DVD in the US market! If there are US DVD's of ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"" and ""Surf Nazi's Must Die"" out than it is truly unjustified to this movie which is superior to the forementioned. Although this is a typical 1 to 2 star B-rated movie, I always have a 5 star time watching it. The true strength of this movie is the very colorful characters. The Playboy husband, sex crazed wife (who looks like Peggy Bundy), war-monger grandfather, Cindy Lauper want-to-be daughter, clueless heavy metal boyfriend, the swinger couple with the gay Greek, the Elvira want-to-be movie hostess and finally our brave hero, the always misunderstood little boy! Oh yes, there is a goofy monster in the center of it all, but his antics is often overlooked by the rest of the humourous cast that never fails to make me laugh. This is a true, cult classic that must not be overlooked. Please, someone make a US DVD release!

Unfortunately, when they get older, they become monsters which must be destroyed by beaming them into space using the same signals that are received by satellite dishes like the kind installed by Stan Putterman.  Soon the monster is beaming in and out of the Putterman's TV and making life a horror for everybody.

While that says little about the movie, the real plot twist is the Putterman's themselves.  After watching them for a moment, you begin to wonder if the colorful Puttermans are any more of our world than the monster.  Their son and grandpa are militant survivalists; their daughter is dating a metal-head, and they themselves are spouse-swapping swingers - you see why nobody gets out of the house for the entire movie?  The house itself is almost a character - reflecting the Puttermans' outlandish tastes.  (Imagine a cross between a ""B-52's"" video and something directed by John Waters.)
