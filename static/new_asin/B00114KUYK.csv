8240278,3,B00114KUYK,"Silly early 1970's Spanish-language, Mexican-made El Santo sci-fi/adventure.  Santo has to fight two separate villains.  One appears to be from outer space and one is terrestrial.  Both use a biological weapon that creates a ridiculous blob-like creature that leaves icky remains after it feeds.  The effects for the blob is simply a bunch of film crew under a wet beige tarp.  It always seems to catch up to its prey even though it shuffles along slowly and the prey runs at top speed.  Still, typical of most El Santo films of the period and certainly watchable.  I bought the Televisa Home Entertainment / Xenon Pictures DVD release and it is fine quality and worth getting.  Recommended for El Santo fans.",1398038400,,709,4.85
8240279,2,B00114KUYK,"I like Santo. I'm no snob about cheap flicks. But this film is simply a major drag. It moves slowly, has no drama to it, and is filled with dull speeches. The monster is predictably fake, but not in a fun way. I only gave this two stars because the print looks good and the sound is okay. But really, I can't imagine anyone loving this film. The one about Frankenstein's Daughter is much more fun, and watchable in ways this one never is. Avoid at all costs.",1366502400,,458,4.215909090909091
8240280,5,B00114KUYK,"Classic movie from the Golden Age of Mexican Movies.  I was surprised that I enjoyed the humor or maybe it was meant to be serious????? Yes, it was a bit over the top, the but this old movie brought a new experience that you do not enjoy today.  It was fun and enjoyable with a storyline that you can have fun with.",1360972800,,315,4.064516129032258
