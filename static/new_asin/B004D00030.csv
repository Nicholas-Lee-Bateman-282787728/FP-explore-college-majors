4331087,5,B004D00030,"This is one of Columbia/Sony's DVD-R Classics On Demand series.  You have to give the folks at Sony some credit in terms of their eccentric choices in titles.  This one is a brisk 71-minute programmer that takes place in a girl's reformatory, replete with life altering experiments perpetrated by the corrupt doctors on staff.  Great cast includes veterans Victor Jory and Paul Cavanaugh.  In 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen from a mint quality print.",1306281600,6,448,5.180555555555555
8424400,4,B004D00030,"EVIL doctors over two hundred years old seek to retain life by siphoning off the life-force of young women.  It doesnt exactly make them young and beautiful again but it does keep the wretches going, supposedly forever, or until a fresh supply of young women cant be had.  To make certain they have a steady supply of women on hand, these vile creatures take up residence in a reform school.  Who is going to miss a few bad girls?  Unfortunately, their scheme is severely tested by two new employees.  First a social worker (Charlotte Austin) becomes suspicious when a spate of mysterious deaths is brought to her attention.  What are the odds of that many young women dying from heart failure?  This forces the EVIL geezer doctors to alter their routine by making one of the dead girls look like a suicide.  This in turn prompts another doctor (William Hudson) to perform a secret autopsy.
Getting out of there alive suddenly becomes a tricky proposition.

What a nice surprise this movie proved to be.",1498089600,,1003,4.718390804597701
8424401,2,B004D00030,"A dullard of a movie here.  If you are an insomniac, use this movie to put you to sleep instead of Sominex, and sleep, sleep, sleep.",1439164800,,132,4.076923076923077
8424402,5,B004D00030,"Very good late 50's B quality horror film.  A young social worker, working in a minimum security women's prison starts to investigate mysterious deaths there with the help of a psychiatrist.  They discover the wardens running the prison are actually a group of 18th century scientists who use the life force from the women to extend their life spans.  The actors playing the scientists are very good, especially Victor Jory and Ann Doran.  Doran is particularly stony (no pun intended).  Their attitude towards their victims is like scientists towards lab rats.  The quality of the DVD-R is particularly excellent.  Highly recommended.",1434758400,,635,5.227722772277228
8424403,5,B004D00030,get all blu ray classic sci-fi and horror movies before corps start phazing dvds and blu rays out in the near future .,1432857600,,118,4.173913043478261
8424404,3,B004D00030,"Inmates from a detention home for women are being used for sinister purposes and turning up dead. The group who run the home are a cabal with a dreadful secret. Anyone questioning their goings on are shut out or disposed of. The female inmates wear what looks like hospital gowns. Of course, it isn't long before someone starts nosing around and more lives are placed in danger. This is a low budget b&w sci-fi horror flick that's just off beat enough to be fun. Sam Katzman was involved in this so if you're familiar with him you should know what to expect. It's a pretty weird little flick and worth checking out for 50's horror lovers. As others have said, the print is excellent.",1431734400,2,683,4.516129032258065
8424405,5,B004D00030,goes with the thing that couldn't die Victor Jory reminds me of Bud Abbotts serious side! the way he talks this movie is pretty darn good I knew when I saw it on amazon I saw it some where before a long time ago like 1965 long ago and it scared the wits out of me as a six year old boy! goes with the land unknown also goes with dr. RX goes with invasion of the body snatchers too.,1423612800,,381,3.775
8424406,3,B004D00030,"When I was a little girl I had a memory of this movie and it influenced some of my dreams.  It haunted me; I could remember images so vividly and the title, but could never find it.  Eureka!  I found it. It's cheesy like those low budget horror flicks of the '50s, but what a hoot.",1369267200,3,281,3.982142857142857
8424407,4,B004D00030,Had never heard of this film and really enjoyed it. The transfer looks superb and it's an interesting premise which if you like the old B&W horrors you will enjoy this. Can you spot Paul Cavanagh?,1364515200,3,196,4.472222222222222
8424408,3,B004D00030,"One of my favorites all time 50s horror movies. However a bit disapponted that it is presented in widescreen. The original movie was in full screen format. By giving us widescreen, a lot of the movie at the top and bottom of screen has been cropped off. Shame on Sony..",1341705600,5,269,4.4
8424409,4,B004D00030,"Strange goings-on, screams in the night, and mysterious deaths at a girls' reformatory controlled by an odd group of people who seem to be... not of this century.

If you're into the genre, this is a rare and wonderful example of 1950s ""B"" movies. Character actors Victor Jory and Paul Cavanaugh (from such other classics as ""The Four Skulls of Jonathon Drake"") do an excellent job holding up the rather thin premise of the script. Charlotte Austin also does an excellent job of portraying the naive but well-meaning social worker who stumbles into the middle of the secret. And Jean Willes (""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" and countless TV appearances in the 1950s, '60s, and '70s) as Tracy, the hard-as-nails convict with a heart of gold. Great stuff.

The video quality is absolutely beautiful. This is a B&W film, and the contrast is good; there wasn't any excessive graininess and no digital artifacts. Sony did an incredible job remastering this thing. The sound is also very crisp and clear (often a problem with these older films). My only complaint (hence four rather than five stars) is that there's no scene menu on the DVD -- no menu of any kind, in fact. So, pop this in the player and plan to watch it from start to finish...

If you're a collector, this ought to be in your library.",1308096000,10,1298,4.684210526315789
