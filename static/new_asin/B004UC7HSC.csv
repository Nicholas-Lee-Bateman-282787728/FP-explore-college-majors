4466827,1,B004UC7HSC,The dance moves were silly and a little awkward.  Since when is caveman a global dance? I was not a fan of this video.,1346284800,,118,3.9166666666666665
4466828,3,B004UC7HSC,"I have a hard time finding exercise videos I'll like, even after reading reviews, so I'm going to write what I wish I had known before I bought this one. I've been doing dance videos for about 8 years, so I like the ones with a good variety of steps. When I first started out I probably would have liked this one, because the instructions are good, the steps aren't too hard, and you repeat them slowly several times before speeding them up. The Latin section has the biggest variety of steps and includes the mambo and samba, hip rolls, and a shimmy. The other two sections have simpler footwork, and the instructor adds variety with arm movements. You do some steps similar to lunges and quite a bit of stepping forward or to the side, sometimes while bending your knees, and the arm movements add some intensity. The real workout is when you run through the combinations twice in a row without stopping, but they're short so that only takes about 2 minutes in each section. There are 3 sections.
  If you've done lots of dance videos or other dancing, and you like varied footwork, this probably won't appeal; but if you're new to dance you might enjoy it.",1342828800,2,1159,4.514285714285714
4466829,5,B004UC7HSC,The first workout is really challenging to your breathing. What a cardio workout. The second one is moderate and the third one is good for all levels of fitness. A really fun workout with moves never done before in other workout dvd's I've tried.,1337990400,,246,4.613636363636363
4466830,5,B004UC7HSC,"I'm someone who has been buying Crunch DVDs for years, and this one does not disappoint.  Lots of new moves.  It's fast-paced, but can also be done half-time if you need to lower the intensity or keep it low impact.  Good instructor and lots of fun.",1335571200,,249,4.369565217391305
4466831,3,B004UC7HSC,"This video is decent.  Can sometimes be hard to follow, but if you keep at it, it should work for you.  I personally think women are better at leading the routines....just saying.",1332115200,,179,4.5625
4466832,5,B004UC7HSC,I'm a working mom with zero time to join a gym or a dance class. I love Zumba and this instructor has some great moves! He's very thorough with teaching the steps and it's fun with the music. It feels like I'm in a class each time I'm doing it and my husband and baby join me sometimes too because they see how much fun I'm having!!!,1324252800,,333,3.985074626865672
4466833,4,B004UC7HSC,"If you love to dance, this routine gives me fun dance moves in a format that is also a great workout. There are three segments, world rhythms, latin, and lyrical hip hop. The instructor is a little hokey, but explains the moves well. You don't need to be experienced in any of the dance styles to pick up the moves. Each routine is broken up into three moves that are performed slowly, then at tempo. My only criticism is that the instructor reviews the moves at a slow tempo again when they get paired with the second set. It slows down the workout, and isn't necessary. But overall, fun and effective!",1319328000,,603,4.441441441441442
4466834,5,B004UC7HSC,"I enjoy this fitness series.  I used to watch it when I had Insight OnDemand and wanted to continue the routine.  It is fun, easy to learn, and you do work up a good sweat.  I usually do two of the three.  It does make you tired at first, but now I feel refreshed afterwards.  The Crunch classes are great!",1315440000,,306,4.033333333333333
4466835,5,B004UC7HSC,"This dvd really gets the fat burning. He breaks down every move at first and then encourages you to do it uptempo. As soon as I started to get tired, the dance was over!! Great for all levels. My favorite is the global grooves- you get to travel to different countries through dance styles.",1304121600,,290,4.388888888888889

8441385,5,B004UC7HSC,"This is a fun dance work out. I have one of his other dance DVD Rhythmica Dance Cardio Party loved it, that is what led me to this one.",1404086400,,135,3.689655172413793
8441386,5,B004UC7HSC,I like it a lot. Something fun to do when I am at home with the kids. To get us moving. Not my main workout video. If you are just starting out to fitness and you looking to try something lite but fun this is the dvd for you,1370563200,,224,3.5918367346938775
8441387,5,B004UC7HSC,"Ever since I did this workout in the fitness section of my Cable network, I have been trying to find it on DVD.  When I saw it on Amazon, I scooped it up. This workout is a lot of fun to do. The instructor",1366675200,,205,3.659090909090909
8441388,5,B004UC7HSC,"I first learned about Marc Dance Rhythms on Comcast ""On Demand"" and I absolutely loved it! There are 3 routines that I learned which was Global, Latin, and Hip Hop! The routines were easy to learn, fun to do, and very energetic to accomplish my weight loss goals! I recommend this to everyone who enjoys dancing and/or who has considered dancing to lose weight! I'm so happy that I finally found the dvd at amazon.com.",1362355200,,418,4.586666666666667
8441389,1,B004UC7HSC,"The workout DVD is slow paced and the dance moves leave a lot to be desired.  The dance moves are very basic.  If you're completely uncoordinated, have not had any dance training or performed dance workouts, then this might be the workout for you.  I didn't feel like I'd done anything after I did the workout and I found it very boring.  Would not recommend this DVD.",1361059200,,368,4.447761194029851
8441390,5,B004UC7HSC,"I really enjoy working out with this DVD.  If you are looking for a hardcore fitness routine, this workout is not for you.  However, if you want to do something fun when you work up a small sweat, then you should buy this DVD.  For a more lengthy workout I will do a couple of the workouts together.  But the best thing about is how fun Marc makes the movements.  Don't expect to get every move the first time you do it, that would be too easy, so dont' get frustrated.  I will buy more DVD's from Marc.",1357344000,,503,4.081632653061225
8441391,2,B004UC7HSC,"The pacing on this DVD is very slow. Marc's Rhythimica DVD has the same moves but at a much faster pace. Rhythimica, in my opinion, is a better workout. I found this DVD very slow and boring with his slow, prolonged, instructional cadence before going full tempo.",1356739200,,263,4.617021276595745
