5474406,5,B00AQYUY0G,My husband and I love British comedy and Timothy Spall is a great actor. It was as though we were at sea with him and his wife.  We loooooved it !!!!,1385769600,,149,3.806451612903226
5474407,2,B00AQYUY0G,"Maybe I was spoiled by watching Michael Palin's travel series (all of them!), but this just seems so slow-paced and rather dull. The episodes are almost identical in format: Timothy plots a new course, spends the whole episode worrying about it, manages to come through all right, and heaves a big sigh of relief. Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of his acting, but this is much less ""travelogue"" and more ""home video of a couple on vacation."" If you're looking for a video that shows some beautiful scenery without too much dialogue or information, give this a shot. If you want more in-depth looks at all of Britain's ports, I suggest you look elsewhere.",1383523200,2,657,4.6239316239316235
5474408,4,B00AQYUY0G,"Timothy and Shane just getting on with it,  It was comical at times, but also showed series times in their adventure.
Well worth the cost anf time to watch.",1382745600,,156,4.379310344827586
5474409,5,B00AQYUY0G,"This series is a video diary kept by the British actor Timothy Spall of a trip he and his wife Shane took.  They circumnavigated the British Isles, visiting every country, over the course of three years (taking the winters off).  Their boat was a custom made Dutch barge christened The Princess Matilda, after their granddaughter.  The genesis of the trip came during Tim's battle with leukemia.  He resolved that if/when he survived, he and Shane would take to the sea.  That's pretty much all you need to know about the plot.

I am sure Tim Spall is much better known in Britain than the U.S.  I have seen him, as Winston Churchill in The King's Speech, but did not recognize him.  What is striking about Tim Spall the captain of the ship, and Shane Spall his first mate, is their complete lack of affectation.  They are a regular couple in their 50s who are on their dream trip.  It's hard work, often fraught with anxiety and discomfort, and they love it.  And they love each other, even when they bicker.

Tim loves Britain and he knows a lot about the sites they visit.  This program is educational as well as entertaining.  It's not for everyone.  Some will feel no desire to sit through Uncle Tim and Aunt Shane's vacation movies.  Personally, I thought it was wonderful.  One of my favorite parts was Tim doing the accents in the regions that they visited - that was when I realized he was an actor.  The rest of the time he was just a self-trained sailor, studying maps, navigating through rough water, occasionally getting lost.

Another highlight was meeting up with Oliver, a fellow leukemia survivor and Britain circumnavigator - except he was traveling alone in a much smaller boat, going in the opposite direction, and trying to sign up bone marrow donors to save the lives of others as his own life had been saved.  There isn't any heavy drama in this show, but that part was really touching.

My only quibble is that the final segment of the journey was truncated.  The film of their stop in Chatham was quite abbreviated, even though they had lived there and were very sentimental about returning.  Also, for all their talk about being x miles away from London, their final destination, they got there, met up with friends and family, drank champagne...fade to black.

Most of us would never have the chance to do what Timothy and Shane Spall did, so it's nice that they let us come along on their journey.  They are so much fun, with their crikeys and cor-blimeys.  The blurb on the cover calls them ""batty"" - I think that's a bit harsh.  I suspect there are a lot of similar couples throughout Britain.  They are definitely not the Kardashians.

It's a gentle, inspirational and very enjoyable series.  If you think it might be your cup of tea (so to speak) then I urge you to give it a try, it probably is.",1375142400,6,2828,4.564612326043737
5474410,5,B00AQYUY0G,"This is an engaging - if a bit slow paced - series of Timothy Spall and his wife heading around the southern coast of England on their barge. It's a scenic, beautiful show that's a beauty to watch, for the scenery and the bits of history and insight they give.

Timothy and his wife are just normal people that, as he says, enjoy messing about in boats. No snarky comments or rude behavior, and unlike more than a few actors, Timothy is not ""on"" all the time, which can be really tiring after a few minutes. Little bits of his subtle humor come through now and then, but most of the time he's just a regular guy on vacation. A very enjoyable series that more people should see and enjoy.",1371945600,8,687,4.2846153846153845
5474411,5,B00AQYUY0G,"Timothy Spall and his wife Shane are on a mission to go round the British coast, in a flat bottomed boat.

Wrapped up in eccentricity and charm this adventure is also a window into the world of a married couple in their 50s. The bickering, the laughs, the sandwiches, the stress all on camera warts and all.

I could watch this over and over. Also a wonderful lesson in British history.",1369353600,5,386,4.422535211267606

8556729,4,B00AQYUY0G,What a magnificient journey both he and his wife undertook! We will see it many times over the years,1444780800,,100,4.315789473684211
8556730,5,B00AQYUY0G,"I first came across Timothy Spall's marvelous acting in the delightful ""Blandings"" television series. In that series he plays the eccentric and daft Lord Emsworth, but here he is strictly himself sailing around Britain in a Dutch barge named ""The Princess Matilda"". In fact he seems at least as eccentric as the fictional Emsworth, but not the least bit daft. Spall is a completely self-taught mariner sailing a quite large vessel into often small ports. What could possibly go wrong? Plenty as it turns out. He takes along as his First Mate his wife Shane, who is his eccentric equal and their genuine love and affection for each other comes through clearly and is the single element that makes this most worth watching.

""Somewhere at Sea"" was shot in three separate series over six years, and chronicles the sometimes harrowing, often comedy rich, and occasionally touching moments of this grand journey, a trip that Timothy Spall dreamed up as he was recovering from leukemia. I'm so thrilled he had a full recovery and actually made this epic journey he dreamed of when he was so ill. This series is inspiring and thoroughly enjoyable; it's sometimes idyllic, and sometimes exciting (barges and heavy weather are not a great combination it appears), and full of enchanting and scenic ports of call.

I highly recommend ""Somewhere at Sea"".",1441929600,2,1343,4.964444444444444

8556734,3,B00AQYUY0G,This was a fun ONE time video.  We like Timothy Spall but it wasn't really his humorous side but just an open diary about his sailing trip about Britain.  Fun but not one we will re-watch!,1405814400,,188,4.194444444444445
8556735,5,B00AQYUY0G,What bravado the couple had to go out on the ocean and brave it.  It was funny and helped fill a need for people like me who wonder what it would be like.,1398124800,2,154,3.6666666666666665
8556736,3,B00AQYUY0G,"Fun to watch to Timothy Spall guide his Dutch barge around the coast of Britian, but wish they had shown more of the areas where he and his wife docked.  Exploring the coastal towns would have made it a much more interesting travel show.",1385942400,,237,4.386363636363637
