8339623,3,B00019GI24,"This is a brutally honest review and in no way meant to offend any of the participants in the interviews.
The disc starts off with a refreshing King Diamond interview.  The King is always a great interviewee and definitely the highlight of this disc.  We then move onto to George Corpsegrinder....which turns more into subjecting married George to the whims of two ladies in the hopes that he will 'sing' Mary Had a Little Lamb.  Yeah, that's what I said, too.  The Nevermore interview is not visibly watchable.  It is so dark on my TV, you can only hear the audio.  The interview with Peter Steele (RIP) is probably not the way I would prefer to remember him.  It's pretty much a re-hash of the other interviews over the years that Bill did with him.  Sharlee D'Angelo's started off fun, but quickly turned the sexual route a la George Corpsegrinder.  The other interview genre discs have been more fun and less sexual question driven.  I'm not a prude, but the questions are very childish and don't really add anything to the mix.  We kind of lost interest at this point and skimmed the rest.  This is the least entertaining of the various documentaries Bill has done.  It almost seems as though these are leftovers from previous edits, possibly.  For as cheap as it is (currently), you'll have a chuckle and if you're a collector worth picking up.",1347926400,,1350,4.641350210970464
