2895074,5,B000T4T8ZA,"Very entertaining and uplifting story of a young girl's effort to become a star in an acrobatic performance group.  The animation is beautiful, the voice-acting superb, the story well-written and inspirational.  Highly recommennded for everyone, but especially for families with girls ten and older.  I suggest you get the two season box set, or the first season's package and then the second season set, since they follow in a logical sequence (and you'll want to view all 52 episodes, they're that good).",1233360000,2,506,5.146341463414634
2895075,5,B000T4T8ZA,"...then you should also love this series.  We bought the first season after other reviews, and after seeing the first 4 episodes, ordered this one.

The other reviewers have done a great job explaining the series, so all I can add is that it is a much different story than Fruba, but the characters and story arc share some small similarities, and are just as compelling.

This one will be played quite a few more times in our household!

[Edit] - Since this is a comment on the entire series, make sure you buy the first season (""Amazing Collection"") if you are going to try it.",1230768000,,579,4.433962264150943
2895076,3,B000T4T8ZA,"Kaleido Star returns from season one as Sora truly learns what it takes to become a true Kaleido Star in ""Kaleido Star: New Wings."" As Kaleido Star begins to suffer from the loss of Layla Hamilton, famous circus performer Leon Oswald is hired to perform to try to attract more audiences. Sora also receives a new rival, May Wong, who claims that she is the next true Kaleido Star and competes with Sora for main roles and Leon's attention. Does Sora really have what it takes? In this season two box set, you get all 25 episodes of season 2 plus a bonus episode on the last disc. But is it really worth your time and money?

This next season presents itself with stunning animation, exciting acrobatic maneuvers, and excellent acting that surpass the first season. The English dub is also very good if you're a dub watcher. There is very good character development and lots of action that will keep you into watching the season all the way through. With lots of suspense and action, it really keeps you going. By the end, however, if you compare it to the first season, you may be slightly disappointed. The general plot is really weak. It starts off good with the introduction to May and Leon, and in the first 13 episodes is really about Sora struggling to make it big with May landing the lead roles and Leon refusing to acknowledge her as a performer. It's really good. At one point, Sora questions her ability as a performer and is confused about what her dream truly is at Kaleido Stage. However, the next last 12 episodes focuses on constantly suffering to try to perfect the Angel Maneuver, the maneuver that will make you acknowledged as a true star. (Which wasn't isn't as appealing as the Legendary great maneuver, which makes you wonder if her constant suffering was really worth it) All she does is suffer and train for the Great Angel Maneuver which takes her several episodes to accomplish the next step in her ""special training"" to be able to perform the move. Then as soon as she suffers like heck through one step the next task just comes up shortly after to make her suffer even more again for another period of episodes. Nothing happens but training.

Interesting bits about Leon's past and mentioned, which answers a lot of unanswered questions about why Leon has a problem with Sora and May deals with the issue of trying to become a better performer like Sora and learn from her ""what she is missing in her performance"", which make it more entertaining. However, the show also doesn't focus around any of the other characters but Sora, May, and Leon. Mia, Anna, Sarah, Ken, and the rest are now unimportant to the story, unlike before, and they basically are just there to buy time until the episode ends. Nothing really happens in the show except Sora chasing and training for her dream. If you are really into this Show, you might like the way it unfolds and how it turns out at the end, but I don't think it's as good. Unlike the first season, where several obstacles got in the way such as her trying to perfect a role (Or the Legendary Great Manuver), receiving several challenges by the cast (not just one big one), and Kaleido Stage being shut down by Yuri. There were episodes involving all other characters and the combination of this and everything else all seemed to come together that made one amazing first season of Kaleido Stage. That's the main thing missing here: a plot. How is constantly focusing about one situation a plot when nothing else happens? The show is just missing something that the first season had that made it enjoyable.

Overall, I'd give this a C+. It's a decent watch with some drawbacks. Not the best and not the worst. Unless you are a true Kaleido Star fan you shouldn't buy it. RENT BEFORE YOU BUY. I TOTALLY recommend the first season of Kaleido Star much more. It's really amazing and MUCH better than this turned out to be. Totally worth your money.",1218499200,,3916,4.591428571428572
2895077,5,B000T4T8ZA,"The first season of Kaleido Star was probably the third anime series I ever watched. My wife and I both enjoyed it, but it was by no means one of our favorite. Season two changed that. With the addition of New Wings, the whole Kaleido Star story has hands down become one of my favorite shoujo series.

The friends who originally introduced us to anime couldn't wait to show us this second season, and having just finished it, I can see why. It takes an already good storyline and makes it great.

The animation and english dubs were very good in my opinion (despite its raspiness, I think
Cynthia Martinez does a great job with Sora), but I tend to value storyline more and so that's what I'll focus on. Let me summarize what I think makes this story not just noteworthy, but a worthwhile.

First, I love this series because it does an incredible job of recreating the mixture of thrill, adrenaline and sheer terror that assaults a performer before a performance. I have a very competetive background in performing arts, and I also enjoy one-on-one athletics. Watching Sora prepare to go on stage was like reliving those same feelings I experienced before a solo performance. I identified perfectly with the tension and animosity that can exist between rivals. I felt Sora's desire desire to win and understood the personal doubt that one must invariably overcome in order to truly succeed. I loved the ability this series had to draw me in until my heart was pounding and my hands gripped the sides of the sofa.

Second, Sora is a wonderful heroine. If there were such a thing, she'd be my nominee for the Tohru Honda of the Year award. I think Sora is like a super spunky, slightly less clueless Torru; a heart of gold, determined, a little vulnerable and naive on the outside but with an inner strength and moral fiber that rivals Ghandi. And yet, she's very believable, because she suffers, she falters and even gives up for a while.

Which leads me to my third point: this story is probably the most moral anime I've come across so far.

One thing I love about anime (and tend to find fault with in American animation and movies) is that Anime isn't afraid to tackle the hard topics. Loss, regret and suffering are frequently dealt with head-on, where as we largely bypass this in American cartoons, and even most movies. We like to see the end product and tend to short-change the journey. Or we simply present the ridiculous idea that ""wishing on a star"" and ""defeating the evil villain"" is somehow all that stands in the way of our dreams.

Not so with Kaleido Star: New Wings. Sora is the real thing. She struggles to identify what her dream is.

And when she finds her dream, she bleeds for it.

Sweat, tears, discouragement...and above all, hard work. There is a price to pay for every dream, and no one will pay it for you. But in the end, the reward for achieving your dreams far outweighs the sacrifice.

Not only does Sora pay the price for her dream, she inspires others to do the same, and because of the strength she finds through the love of her friends and the desire to bring others together, everyone is lifted to a higher level.

Here's what else I love - Sora had to adapt her dream so that it accommodated reality. I myself had a hard time really believing in Sora's dream. A stage without competition seemed like a silly, impossible, and even impractical ideal. I almost lost faith in the series entirely because I thought it was going to have some lame-o, ""everyone loves each other"" ending. I was thrilled to see that there wasn't purely a ""storybook ending"". Yes, Sora achieved her dream...but at the same time, she also grew up and learned to accept the reality of competition and the place it has in driving people to achieve.

I've gone on long enough with the philosophical rantings. Let's just say, I wouldn't hesitate to buy both seasons. I plan on having this around not only for it's great entertainment value, but to help teach my kids what it means to work for your dreams.

Enjoy!",1212451200,3,4021,4.5680555555555555
2895078,5,B000T4T8ZA,"OK, so it's a bit cheesy.  At times a little bit too after school special (minues the drugs, teen pregnancy or any ""bad kids"").  But, man!  Do I love this series!  The music is great; poppy and catchy.  The animation style is one of my favorites; gorgeous characters, but not too gorgeous.  More like real people, only prettier.

This series and Angelic Layer...for some reason, these stories touch my heart and keep me rooting for the main character.  For anyone looking for an easy to watch, easy to put down (when needed) and then later pick back up series that makes you smile...pick up Kaleido Star.",1210809600,,604,4.632075471698113
2895079,2,B000T4T8ZA,"I will be the first to say that the first season of Kaliedo Star was absolutely amazing. It was a wonderful story and beautiful animation to go along with it. I was thrilled when I heard another season was coming and that she would have a rival. So I am quite sad to say that the second season was a huge let down for me. The animation, acrobatic maneuvers, and voice acting was awesome even better than the first I would say. But the story however made me cringe. The first half of this season is pretty good with the rivalry between Sora and May Wong, a new recruit who earned the highest scores in the exams. But after the Circus Festival the story just went to, for lack of a better word, s***. More than anything what really turned me off is Sora lack of will to fight even to defend herself from May's bullying. I guess I feel that such a weak willed character shouldn't be the star of this show and during the second half I almost wished that they have made May the main character. Seeing how she is more strong willed than Sora. And once again just like the first series most of the roles Sora receives are simply handed to her without any sort of real competition, save for the role of Mina Murray which she lost to May. I would watch this series simply for the aesthetic feel to it. But the story has lost its luster and even the final act, The Angel's Maneuver was a bit disappointing and not nearly as magical as the Legendary Great Maneuver. Just looked like a lot of jumping and really feels like all Sora suffered for (to learn this act) was wasted. It just jumping really high. It's pretty but after watching the second half of the season I found it not to be worth my suffering of watching Sora fail and suffer repeatedly. This series is nice to borrow or watch but I wouldn't waste your money purchasing it. But that's just my opinion.",1204848000,2,1853,4.297142857142857
2895080,5,B000T4T8ZA,"Kaleido Star: New Wings is a great combination of favorite old characters, intriguing new characters, and a fresh plot. The beginning of the series can be a bit trudging, because Sora has a hopeless attitude, Leon's character is  quite flat, and May Wong will annoy you to death. Don't let this put you off though, because all these things will flip by the end of the season in a way that is uplifting and inspirational. You won't regret this purchase, but make sure to watch Kaleido Star (the first season) before New Wings.",1202515200,,525,4.645161290322581
2895081,5,B000T4T8ZA,"I remember when I first saw Kaleido Star. An anime about a circus like Cirque du Soleil? It was like somebody read my mind and decided to give me exactly what I wanted. Acrobatics, sweet animation from the people who worked on Angelic Layer, strong characters, and terrific voice acting made it well worth watching. It was however, not without flaws.

Kaleido Star's biggest problem was the VERY uneven flow of the series, and MASSIVE amounts of filler. You could of course argue that many episodes were just giving you more detail about various characters, but in reality it was just padding out a 13 episode series to 26. Several times I seriously wondered where the show was going, and not in a good way. The show pretty near de-railed when Kaleido Stage was sold and divided, and the whole Masked Star Saga in particular really bored me. What I did love though, were episodes that focused on characters I loved (like the first episode with Rosetta, and Layla's thawing out when she was first forced to work closely with Sora), and anything to do with the Great Maneuver sub-plot. And when the show finally got around to the big finale and all that led up to it, it provided some of the best anime drama I have ever seen (Sora being ready to quit on the special training and then seeing Layla out running and starving herself to lose weight to make it easier for her had me crying, to say nothing of the very end of Kaleido Star's first season when Layla gave up Kaleido Stage and told Sora that she was her dream now).

When I heard about another season (another series?) of Kaleido Star I had mixed feelings. Would it be a light-hearted continuation? Would it be uneven like the first season? I thought about it a long while and then finally got around to renting it. Oh... My... Goodness!

As I said before, Kaleido Star was a good series, but this sequel of a season blows away the first in absolutely every way. First of all, since all the Japanese voice actors from the first season are now quite comfortable in their roles, the acting continues to just get better and better. The animation, while not drastically changed, comes across as less plain, brighter and more colorful. The action sequences and acrobatics are even faster and more fluid then before. And the writing, the story, and the new music are just so GOOD! And to top it off, there is hardly any filler at all. This doesn't feel like a TV show in the traditional sense, but more like a long awesome movie. Only the best anime are able to succeed on this level (shows like Crest of the Stars, Escaflowne, Gundam Wing, and the Big O). And the story is so engrossing that it quickly hooks you, till you are absolutely dying to know what will happen next!

The story of the show picks up right where the first season left off. Layla Hamilton has left Kaleido Stage, and Sora is the star of the show. While some people are very pleased who recognize her potential, the audience in general isn't really interested in seeing her perform, because despite the Great Maneuver, she just isn't that big of a star.

Thus, right from the get-go, Sora's goal is clear. She needs to become a true Kaleido Star like her old partner Layla. To this end she once again has the advice of one Spirit of the Stage, and the support of a loveable cast of characters. If this sounds like the same old story all over again, think again. While there is a series of duel-like challenges in this season similar to those in the past one, these are much more intense, desperate even. From the first episode, a new character named Leon Oswald, (the real star of Kaleido Stage initially), makes it clear that if Kaleido Stage is going to hold together Sora is going to have to step up her game. And when Sora's best isn't good enough her real rival of the new season immediately steps in. May Wong, a prodigy who is determined that SHE is destined to be Leon's true partner is bound and determined to destroy Sora and claim her position as the top star.

The duels are great drama, as they are very well directed, intense, and use music to great effect. But don't think the whole show is going to be like that, because like the first season, they are just there to build relationships and define characters. Sora has a lot of soul-searching to do in this series, and must learn to stand up on her own and stop looking to others for life's answers. She has to figure out what her PERSONAL dream is, and where the path to becoming a True Star lies.

Unlike the first season, instead of a near de-rail when Sora loses her way, Sora's missteps only help her understand her own feelings and what she wants. No one rescues her out of situations anymore. Now every time it seems like all is lost, she finds her own way. And it makes for VERY entertaining viewing.

The real story of the show is about something called the Angel Maneuver, and how perfecting it is the path to becoming a True Star. The road is hard, and could destroy a person, but at the other side of perfecting it comes pure joy and happiness transmitted to the audience. For anyone who has ever had a dream, a hard one, one that could make or break you, I think the Angel Maneuver Saga is deeply inspiring. Because while there is some truly over-the-top drama at times, the heart of the show is always sincere and you can feel it. You WANT to see Sora succeed. You want to see her attain her dreams and bring everyone joy the way that she wants. It's downright infectious.

Another reviewer probably put it better than I ever could describing what makes this show unique. You see, there is a genre of anime that is much neglected. It's what can only be called the Gunbuster/Battle Athletes Genre, as these shows absolutely defined it. Basically in this kind of anime you have an underdog, usually a young girl, who is a total klutz, and is trying to do something very difficult, be it piloting a giant robot or winning the Olympics. Initially she is of course terrible and has to work 10 times as hard as everyone else just to survive. But then, something amazing happens, and she starts to catch up to the top star, a rivalry builds, and in the end the underdog hero saves the day. Now normally that's my favorite type of /movie/series anyway, because any introvert who has ever had had to claw their way to a decent life knows what it feels like and can identify with a hero like that. But the thing is, I don't think I've ever seen an anime that made me feel like THIS.

I admit it, at the end the first season I cried like a baby (seeing sweet, kind, good-natured Sora crying her eyes out over losing the partner she loved got to me), but what that season had occasionally this one has constantly. Even the filler episodes will move you. From the guilt of destroying another person's life, to the drive that makes someone endure the unbearable simply because they refuse to give up, from the search for a purpose in your life to a desire to built a world of peace and love and happiness for everyone, this show transcends its genre and even its medium to reach deep down in the hearts of its viewers.

In a world full where physical violence is glorified and heroes who fight dirty win the day, it's incredibly refreshing to watch a show with a protagonist who in the end refuses to antagonize, and instead wants to help, encourage, and inspire everyone. The end of episode 25 is the defining moment. It reminds me of the end of the movie Strictly Ballroom, or maybe the end of the game Space Channel 5. When you see something truly wonderful that makes you happy, you just can't stand to watch on the sidelines anymore, you want to get involved so you become part of it and it becomes part of you. You want to sing, dance, get up on the stage and perform. Watch the show all the way to the end and see if the ending doesn't make you feel the same way.

The world would be better place if there were more people in it like Sora.",1191888000,10,7935,4.419972640218878
2895082,5,B000T4T8ZA,"Anyone who doesn't own this series is missing out.  While the first half of season 2 starts slow you can feel the dramatic buildup as Sora struggles to find what kind of star she is.  Sora is cheerful and kind and she sees the best in others.  She is optimistic and she sees the world not as it is but as it should be.  If real people were like her this would be a great world to live in.  She cares about others and she wants to create a stage with no competition a stage where people can be the best they can be and bring that greatness alive in others.  Sora undergoes grueling trials and the most awe inspiring training sequence ever animated.  She inspires other characters to greatness and viewers as well!  This anime is the perfect anime to inspire young girls to be great and be the best they can be.  Absolutely no sexual suggestiveness or swearing or graphic violence nonetheless this anime has appeal to all people who love good characters and a good story.  Sora's trials inspired me  I went on a diet and began to exercise, I got some muscle tone now and I am planning a thru hike to the Appalachian trail even as I complete my college degree.  Before I watched this anime I never believed I could finish college, I didn't think I would ever be strong, and I was growing older and wider without a fight.  Sora even though she is animated made me believe in myself and motivated me to make my dreams come true.  I highly recommend this anime to all girls 13 to 80!  I'm 29 years old and this anime is very dear to me because it teaches us to believe in ourselves and do our best and it teaches us to believe in others.  In a world where no one believes in anything anymore, I would say that is quite an accomplishment for a simple cartoon.

Add to that the animation is beautiful and the voice acting wonderful.  If you have a young woman in your life a daughter, a sister, a niece, heck my mom is 50 and she loves this anime!  This beautifully animated inspiring tale is a must.  I want to be like Sora.  I want to believe in myself and the people in this world.  I can make my dreams come true!  Sora showed the way.",1189900800,14,2131,4.207407407407407

- BACKSTORY -

I got this box set because I had originally bought&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kaleido-Star-Amazing-Collection/dp/B000B5IONO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kaleido Star - Amazing Collection</a>&nbsp;a few years back thinking I had a complete collection of the anime when I in fact only had the first season (making that 26th episode ending a real ""WTF?!"" moment). That mistake sent me all over the internet looking for answers. What I found out I've collected here to hopefully save at least one person out there the headache I had tracking down specific info.

- INFO I WISH I'D KNOWN BEFORE -

This True Star Collection contains all 25 episodes of Kaleido Star: New Wings - the second season of the Kaleido Star series - plus a bonus OVA (The Amazing Princess Without a Smile) for a total of 26 episodes. If you're looking for a complete collection or other options, I've listed them at the bottom of this review.

The only real reason you'd buy the True Star Collection is because you've already bought the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kaleido-Star-Amazing-Collection/dp/B000B5IONO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kaleido Star - Amazing Collection</a>&nbsp;and want it to look good on your shelf (*points to self*). You get all 51 episodes of the anime this way + the first OVA. Problem is, there are two OVAs for this anime, and buying these two box sets means you don't get the Layla-centric OVA, ""Legend of Phoenix ~Layla Hamilton Monogatari~"". You also don't get any of the extras included in the individual DVD releases - like interviews with Director Junichi Sato, commentaries with Mike MacRae (Leon) and Illich Guardiola (Yuri), etc. If you want all 51 episodes + both OVAs, you'll want to look into the Funimation releases I've linked at the bottom.

- TRUE STAR PACKAGING -

The season is collected on 5 DVDs individually packaged in thin plastic cases (I believe they're called Thinpaks?). Kinda flimsy, but it looks really good. The box itself has a nice almost matte feel and is made of fairly sturdy cardboard. If you've ever bought a DVD set by ADV Films, you'll know what I mean.

- OTHER NOTES -

A couple of my anime box sets (like this one) come from ADV Films - a now defunct company who's anime assets were taken up by Funimation. In August, Funimation will be releasing the first season in their popular S.A.V.E. format with season 2 coming in October. I've never bought a S.A.V.E. edition of anything, so I can't talk about the packaging for those, but it seems like they're bare bones when it comes to content (i.e. little to no extras). For some people that's fine, but there are those out there that want all the extras and as far as I can tell you only get that with the individual ADV Films DVD releases.

Below I'll list the options you have for owning the Kaleido Star Anime:

This second season is none of these things, rent it or borrow it from someone, but do not buy it.",1280361600,,287,4.142857142857143
8208116,5,B000T4T8ZA,"After coming out of an amazing first season, season 2 starts off pretty badly. First off, you can skip the 2 recap episodes which don't even add anything besides a new edited ending. Furthermore we see the loss of two awesome characters, Layla and Yuri, for the first half and get some pretty bad new character replacements, May Wong and Leon Oswald.

So why did I rate this 5 stars, after all the feelings of animosity towards the newcomer characters, it just makes you more attached to the anime, because of how angry we are getting. So when we finally see Sora able to shine the feelings this anime will produce will be amazing.

We have seen Sora struggle in the first season, but her struggle this season is way greater and we see some big time failures for the first time. For a character to lose so many times, it's refreshing to see. It gets tiring to see the main character always win every battle like in all the shonen animes.

Ultimately, the first half may be a bit slow but if you believe in the build up it builds, then it will be on par with the first season. And a lot of people say this show is for girls, but I think its more for everyone. It has a girlish theme but it plays out very much like a shonen.",1247702400,4,1223,4.240343347639485
