8178964,5,B000NJVZ20,"Well done; very God honoring and focused on God and faith. It is not focused on entertainment and pleasure, but to honor God and tells about how God worked through the life of John Bunyan. It has helped me to better understand the context of John Bunyan's book, Pilgrim's Progress. It is worth watching;
Written from a 4th Grader's perspective.

This is treatment of John Bunyan is enlightening to those that want to know how difficult it was to be a person that wanted to know and decide for himself who God is and help others to know.",1368230400,,264,3.981132075471698
8178966,4,B000NJVZ20,I liked this.  It was long enough and interesting enough to give a good introduction to Bunyan's life.  Would make a good class presentation for high school or junior college level classes.,1358121600,,189,4.875
8178967,5,B000NJVZ20,This is a wonderful video that tells of the life of John Bunyan and many things he went through. By God's grace it will inspire you and warm your heart as it informs your mind. Because of the content I give it five stars and I highly recommend you watch.,1341014400,,254,4.1
8178968,3,B000NJVZ20,"This is very informative of John Bunyan, The background music however overtakes the narrator and it is difficult to hear him over the music.",1340841600,,140,4.875
8178969,5,B000NJVZ20,"Bunyan was persecuted for his faith, which is
a true mark of a believer.

He was strong in his convictions, quite a testimony.

Really informative documentary.

You'll be glad you watched.",1325203200,,188,5.0
