2819513,5,B000PGTPGO,"Finally! It's taken far too long for this series to be released on DVD and now they're not releasing them fast enough! Seriously though, Sabrina is a truly great series especially for the family, since family friendly programming is getting harder to find on TV these days. Sabrina was/is a funny, entertaining & VERY well written show with good morals and over all is just a fun show to watch and who can't relate to being different especially in school! Highly recommended for anyone looking for some fun escapism.",1191888000,2,516,4.808988764044944
2819514,4,B000PGTPGO,"I think that no one in this world could love this show as much as me.  It was the best teenage sitcom that ever came on TV.  I have both the first and the second season and i am eagerly anticipating the third season, does anyone know when it is coming out?  I was very disappointed however that so much was cut out of the second season, I notice a couple places were the songs were changed and little scenes were cut out here and there, why do they do this?  I see no point in taking out things when your are paying so much to have the whole season!  The song change, though disappointing, does not upset me as much as missing part of the episodes, I really hope that the third season is better and they leave everything in it.  And as a bonus some extra features would be nice!  I only give this 4 stars because of the missing pieces, and I hope i can give season 3 5 stars!!  I can't wait for the rest of the seasons!!  I hope they come quickly!!  I love this show!!",1188518400,,968,4.020942408376963
2819515,5,B000PGTPGO,"Sabrina the Teenage Witch TV series is a time-less classic.  It has all the ingredients of a classic family show.  It is very entertaining.  Non-offensive. It is a good-feel show.  And it is a show with simple stories.

Watching the Sabrina dvds now is just as entertaining now as well as when it first aired.  I can't wait for future dvd releases of the TV series other seasons.

It is unfortunate that the star, Melissa Joan Hart, grew up and could no longer continue this teenage series.",1187827200,,490,4.563218390804598
2819516,4,B000PGTPGO,"I eagerly waited for this to come out on DVD and though the show is still great it's a shame that they have included cut version episodes for the DVD. A couple of the episodes don't make as much sense because there seem to be bits cut from them. They have also changed the music on one of the episodes. It's not a huge deal but it does take something away from the overall quality of the collection. The episodes improve more and more towards the end of the DVD where the show seems to get into its stride a bit more. I love the Disneyworld episode. I love Salem...I actually find myself believing he's a real cat! Overall, great. Only gets 4 stars because episodes have been cut and because there are no extras. A behind the scenes look would be nice",1187481600,9,751,4.258741258741258
2819517,3,B000PGTPGO,"I was soo happy to get Sabrina the Teenage witch, I was just super exitied! It was my favorite TV show for so many years...but i was so disapointed with the DVDs! They cut stuff out!!! I recorded them on VHS off the TV so i could watch them way back when it first aired, so i have been re-watching them on VHS for years, and I was mad when the TV station cut stuff out, But to put it onto DVD with the stuff cut out, that is WRONG! I am so MAD! I looked forward to haveing the entire episodes...but I have the TV cuts of it. This sucks. They cut out some of my favorite parts
For example, in Witchs Licance part 2, Hild, Zelda, and Salem go to the other realm to get a lab top. Remember that? And Hilda got into an argument with a kid to push a button that said, 'Don't Push'. So it was hard to get the joke that came next at the house.
You may think that it is so little, but since it was my favorite TV show, it hurts. It majorly sucks. I feel like i got a ripped off copy of it out of a guys jacket in an ally. I am actully about in tears over this. This rediculous!",1186531200,57,1069,3.798206278026906
2819518,5,B000PGTPGO,I own seasons one and two and I would preorder all the seasons if I could. I just wish that they could have kept in the original songs and maybe added some extra features like commentary from MJH or the other cast members.,1186444800,4,222,4.186046511627907
2819519,3,B000PGTPGO,"Why Does This Only Say ""Sabrina,The Teenage Witch - The Second Season"" And NOT ""The Complete Second Season"" ??? They Better Not Have Released CUT Episodes

Just Like ""Ghost Whisperer - The Complete First Season"" Now The Second Season Is Called ""Ghost Whisperer - The Second Season"" I Hope They Dont Butcher Our Shows!!!",1186358400,3,319,4.907407407407407
2819520,5,B000PGTPGO,"I used to watch this show when I was a kid, and I loved it. I bought Season 1 when it came out, and I was very excited to see that Season 2 was on the way. I think that the show is great--it's clever, funny, has lots of positive moral messages (even though they can sometimes be cheesy :)), and the first few seasons are the best ones (In my opinion, during Sabrina's college years, the show goes downhill).

In Season 2, Sabrina's friend, Jenny, seems to have dropped off the face of the earth. Instead, Sabrina makes friends with Valerie. Also joining the regular cast is Martin Mull as Mr. Kraft--hilarious. Additionally, Sabrina is regularly bothered by her Quiz Master as she works towards her Witch's License.

Personally, I find most of my favorite episodes on Season 2!

Season 2 is composed of 4 discs, and is very similar to Season 1 (except with Season 2 material, obviously). There are no special features, nor are there subtitles.

Here are the episodes of Season 2:
Sabrina Gets Her License (Part I)
Sabrina Gets Her License (Part II)
Dummy for Love
Dante's Inferno
A Doll's Story
Sabrina, the Teenage Boy
A River of Candy Corn Runs Through It
Inna Gadda Sabrina
Witch Trash
To Tell a Mortal
Oh What a Tangled Spell She Weaves
Sabrina Claus
Little Big Kraft
Five Easy Pieces of Libby
Finger Lickin' Flu
Sabrina and the Beanstalk
The Equalizer
The Band Episode
When Teens Collide
My Nightmare, the Car
Fear Strikes Up a Conversation
Quiz Show
Disneyworld
Sabrina's Choice
Rumor Mill
Sabrina vs. Magic

2819904,4,B000PGTPGO,"As in Season 1, the episodes of Season 2 are just as enjoyable, and it is evident that the characters are maturing.  Even though this show was (is) primarily intended for the teenage set, we, along with fellow older adults, also find the show entertaining. The wife and I (we're in our early 60's) only started watching this program while it was already nearing the end of its run in 2002, and now we are watching the show's seasons and episodes from the beginning on Amazon Prime. The shows are cleverly scripted and well-acted. Most refreshing is that the episodes are pretty unpredictable, one never knows what will happen in the witch vs. mortal world or what actor will make a comical guest appearance. We've read about future seasons and episodes so we now know that many changes are in store. After all, Melissa Joan Hart couldn't remain a teenager forever, and the program did run for seven seasons. Salem, the (condemned) talking cat never ceases to amuse us. We are looking forward to viewing the next 5 seasons in the coming months.",1466640000,,1043,4.699453551912568

2820653,5,B000PGTPGO,I used to watch this show when I was younger with my mom. Its such a cute show. Salem is so funny and everything is very humorous. It lets you escape from reality a little but also it isn't really dirty or anything like most of whats on TV now.,1416960000,,244,3.9

2820655,4,B000PGTPGO,"""Sabrina"" is silly fun. It has the obligatory life-lesson thrown into each episode, but it's mostly just fun. The leads hit their stride by Season 2, so their performances are more consistent. Some of the supporting characters changed in this season. Most notable is the addition of Martin Mull as Sabrina's nemesis (and Aunt Hilda's love interest), the vice-principal.

I must say, the teen dramas/sitcoms back then are so much ""cleaner"" and great for kids, unlike what we see these days. If I have young kids, I would consider having them watch these instead of the 'full of sexual nuisances and references' dramas we have on tv these days.

Now back to Sabrina. Season 2, the producers and the network tried to clean up the issues they think they have from Season 1. I thought a weirdo Jenny from Season 1 was a nice touch, but she's gone and in come Valerie, which is also fun. However, why does Sabrina only have one girl friend and not more? Budget? Love that this show's not only have Sabrina and Harvey, but a lot of the crazy going ons as a teenage witch.  Still love it.",1409702400,,817,4.264516129032258

2820760,5,B000PGTPGO,"I loved this series when I first saw it in the later 1990's. As I recall, it ran from 1996 to 2003.

It is more than the adventures of a teenage witch in high school (four seasons) and college (three seasons), living with her two aunts because her witch father is stuck in a book of magic, and unable to live with her mother for the first two years of her training due to her mom's mortality interfering somehow with her blossoming, just discovered, powers.

The show is a commentary on how the gifted student often has trouble fitting in at school, the troubles he has getting along with his peers, getting teased by the jocks and cheerleaders, and not having outlets for average recreation with others.

Yes, many of the comedic situations have mainly to do with how people see the results of the witchcraft then try to explain it away. The principal especially provides some comic relief, especially when he dates one, then the other aunt for awhile.

With this review, I am reviewing all seven seasons of Sabrina. The first two seasons were better than the third and fourth, in my humble opinion, then when she got into college and moved into a house with several other students, the plots brightened back up again because there were new situations to be explored.

Seasons 1-2: Five Stars
Seasons 3-4: Four Stars
Season 5: Five Stars
Seasons 6-7: Four Stars

This quality show is superior to Jesse and other more recent teenager shows.,1403913600,,247,3.8627450980392157

2820771,5,B000PGTPGO,"Such a wholesome, witty and hilarious show! I watched this when if first aired in the 90's and came across it when trying to find something appropriate for my daughter to watch that wasn't destructive to her mind like the Disney channel garbage teaching little girls to be pretty and not focused on their education. We both watch it together and literally LOL.",1402704000,,360,4.73015873015873
2820772,4,B000PGTPGO,It's a cute show too bad they don't make them clean like this anymore. We enjoy watching it as a family once in awhile.,1402617600,,119,4.0

It's rather remarkable that a show like this was actually a prime time hit. This show is fun to watch and is a great escape from the drudgery and ugliness of reality. The show is great for people of all ages with a terrific female protagonist who gets herself into hilarious predicaments. Episode 8 is one of my favorite when she travels back to the 1960s and everyone is a hippie.,1402012800,,495,4.166666666666667

2820854,5,B000PGTPGO,"I never tire of watching Sabrina's antics as she tries to grow into her new role as a witch.  It is a nice fantasy 1/2 hour to spend with your child.  Clothing isn't trashy, words aren't vulgar, behaviors don't glamorize self defeating actions.  I don't ever worry about what my daughter is watching.  This was one of her favorite shows when she was early teens.  Every once in a while we still sit and watch an episode together.",1388016000,,429,4.448717948717949

2820871,4,B000PGTPGO,"Was feeling in a Halloween-ish mood browing shows when I saw this and I wondered what type of show this may be so I decided to try it.  I must say this show was funny.  It is very big on being family-orientated and caring for others.  And though it deals with magic and witches, the show is not offensive to or puts down the religious.  Sabrina is a nice, funny show if you enjoy a light hearted, supernatural comedy which I found somewhat similar to my Dad's favorite show when he was a younger, ""Bewitched.""",1381708800,,509,4.326315789473684

Great for nostalgia and great for kids. 90's Nickelodeon wins again!",1381449600,2,286,4.5
2820874,4,B000PGTPGO,"It would be a five but, it does not stream very well.  We have to start the show then pause it for a few minutes to let it buffer.  Very kid friendly.",1381190400,,150,3.65625

2820926,5,B000PGTPGO,"Season two of this show holds a special place in my heart.  It was the season I started watching, so these characters seem like the original cast of the show to me.  Additionally, it still contains some of my favorite episodes.

Sabrina Spellman (Melissa Joan Hart) is turning 17, the year that young witches get their license.  Of course, it isn't that easy.  Over the next year, Sabrina has to pass a series of tests given at random times by her Quizmaster (Alimi Ballard).  She does get some guidance from her aunts Hilda (Caroline Rhea) and Zelda (Beth Broderick).  Rounding out her home life is Salem their talking cat (voiced by Nick Bakay).

And she still has to try to survive high school where she makes a new friend in Valerie (Lindsay Sloan).  Harvey (Nate Richert), Sabrina's sometimes boyfriend, is still around.  Unfortunately, so is head cheerleader Libby (Jenna Leigh Green) who delights in making Sabrina's life as miserable as possible.

This is also the season that Aunt Zelda buys the labtop, a folding chemistry lap that fits right on their table.  And it introduces Vice Principal Kraft (Martin Mull) who has a crush on Aunt Hilda at this point even as he delights in making Sabrina's life miserable.

Over the course of this season, Sabrina dates a witch who hates mortals, is turned into a doll by her spoiled cousin, tries to have a normal Halloween party despite the talking furniture, turns Libby into a puzzle, and grows a giant beanstalk right outside their house.  Meanwhile, the entire cast heads to Disney's new Animal Kingdom theme park in an episode that aired two days after the park opened.

And this season also includes my favorite episode of the series.  Sabrina learns that she can tell one mortal she is a witch on Friday the 13th.  When the day is over, will she be glad that she told Valerie?

This show is pretty silly.  I admit it.  But I enjoy the light humor.  I don't have to do anything but sit back, relax, and laugh.  It's definitely a guilty pleasure.

And what makes it work are the characters.  Oh, sure, they are all over the top.  But the writers and actors do a good job of making us love them (or love to hate them in the case of Kraft and Libby.)

And you can't fault the special effects.  Every episode has plenty of them, and they all work well.

Unfortunately, this set is just the episodes themselves with no bonus features.  Still, with 26 episodes, it is a good deal for fans.

This isn't a show I go around bragging about watching very often, but I sure do enjoy it when I sit down to watch it.",1245801600,6,2560,4.526200873362446

2820940,4,B000PGTPGO,"The second season of SABRINA THE TEENAGE WITCH delivers pretty much the same high standard of witty scripts and imaginative story premises.  Melissa Joan Hart stars as Sabrina Spellman, your average 17-year-old schoolgirl with one magical twist: she's a witch!  As if being a teenager wasn't hard enough, in Season Two of the magical sitcom, Sabrina must juggle her hectic highschool activities with studying for her witches' license.

In Season Two, Sabrina gets a new best friend, Valerie (Lindsay Sloane), and her relationship with Harvey (Nate Richert) starts getting serious.  Still on hand to cause nothing but trouble is snotty teen queen Libby (Jenna Leigh Green); whilst Vice Principal Kraft (Martin Mull) and timid teacher Mrs Quick (Mary Gross) add some new comedy elements to the Westbridge High scenes.  As per usual, all the best lines go to Sabrina's feline offsider Salem (voiced by Nick Bakay), with her two aunts Hilda (Caroline Rhea) and Zelda (Beth Broderick) coming close behind.

2820945,3,B000PGTPGO,"As I sit here watching a rerun of Sabrina on tv, I can't help remembering there was a part two of ""Inna-Gadda-Sabrina"".  As I recall Salem escapes and ends up hitching a ride with a group of Hippie kids to Philadelphia, creating a cliff hanger ending and a potential second episode. Does anyone else remember this?  I hate it when shows do this, they advertise it as a ""complete season"" but they edit the shows like a regular tv rerun. Now the show ends with them commenting on how glad they are that Salem came back, stating that he had missed his ""stories"" for a week and are folding laundry, thus making me think I had a lapse of memory.  I find this very frustrating.

Some new to dvd TV shows have caught on and not only offer the shows as originally aired, but also offer extras, such as bloopers as well as behind the scenes commentary, even tours of the individual sets. (i.e. Friends dvd's offer these things.)  I know Sabrina has these things because I tape Bloopers on my Tivo and they always have some kind of Sabrina blooper in them.  I mean if I am gonna spend a small fortune on purchasing this and the future collection of these dvds perhaps a little more effort should be shown towrd those hardcore fans who watched the show from it's beginings and who still watch it in reruns, to those newer fans who are getting a first look of it through the reruns, by offering us not only the originally aired shows but perhaps putting some extras in. I mean come on they even mention the addition of director commentary in ""Cirque du Sabrina"" perhaps they can live up to it.",1199577600,4,1581,4.397260273972603
