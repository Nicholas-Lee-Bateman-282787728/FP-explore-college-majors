Really glad Funimation decided to come out with these S.A.V.E. editions which saves a lot of money compared to when they are first released.",1364774400,,270,4.76595744680851
5191204,5,B008YRL6SQ,"This is one of those Animes that turns out to be a gem hiding in a lower priced package. The artwork is great and the story is original. The S.A.V.E. series of animes is a genius idea. Normally high priced animes in a cheaper package for a lot less money. Nothing deleted, great quality. The same as the higher priced box set just in a condensed box and a lower price. Best idea I've seen. Me being a anime fan.

This one follows a character killed off accidentally by a mecha only to be brought back to life by that same mecha and mentally linked to him. This allows him to summon it by calling out  ;Linebarrel; and it appears moving him inside it to pilot the vehicle.

Of course, you have the super villains from another dimension  who are trying to take over the earth with their mechas. In fact ;Linebarrel; was designed for them but hi-jacked by the scientist who built it and sent with his daughter to earth.

Besides the original anime ideas, there are enough surprises to keep you entertained for the lengthy anime. If you like anime, you'll love this one and of course there is some fan service so with this and the gore, it's probably a 14 plus age bracket series. You won't be sorry if you get this one.",1364083200,7,1216,4.3392070484581495
5191205,5,B008YRL6SQ,"Kouichi has been picked on his whole life. He's always being rescued by his best friend and the girl he likes. He's in Middle School now, and he's sick of all the crap. One day he's killed by a Mech that falls from the sky. The alien girl piloting it resurrects him and he becomes the new pilot of the Mecha called Linebarrel. Now that he has power, he's turned into a douchebag. He joins the Juda Corporation to fight the evil Kato organization. Kato is led by a man from another dimension, he wants to pave the way for a huge invasion. After many failures and revelations, Kouichi realizes his purpose and becomes a true hero.

This anime really surprised me. There are tons of giant robot animes out there, and most of them are pretty average. This one rises above the average series in the Mech genre. The animation, soundtrack, and voice acting are all great. There are lots of really cool and memorable characters. This anime also has tons of action, drama, comedy, romance, and fanservice. It's not for kids. There is some strong language, nudity, and some suggestive stuff herein. Overall, this anime is great. It reminded me of Gundam Seed Destiny, RahXephon, and Full Metal Panic. I think that if you liked any of those titles, you'll probably like Linebarrels of Iron.",1355702400,10,1279,4.634361233480176

5191220,3,B008YRL6SQ,This show had a lot to offer. But unfortunately it just didn't live up to any of my expectations. The story was okay. Would I recommend this? Not a chance.,1388966400,2,155,4.2

5191222,5,B008YRL6SQ,"To those who've been bullied or picked on in school this anime is for you. It proves that having the courage to fight is what makes you a hero but letting that power go to your head is what makes you a zero! This anime has it all: love, drama, action, comedy and a generous amount of Fan Service to satisfy near anyone. This anime is a buy or rent only because and again once a love story arc introduced the anime as a whole wraps itself around that but in this one it starts off with a love story and adds many more twists to the primary story in addition to that. There are also big surprises in store to add to the drama elements as well. This is worth checking out!",1383004800,,669,4.037593984962406
5191223,5,B008YRL6SQ,"One of the very best Mobile Suit Animes I've watched outside Gundam..An unorthodox hero, with an impressive development base story. Its alittle slow at times, but the action picks up fast, and the comedy in the story isn't half bad. A must see for any anime lover,",1375660800,,264,4.638297872340425
5191224,4,B008YRL6SQ,"I love mecha and was aware of this series for awhile, but didn't get around to it. The mecha are cool, the hairstyles are suitably different, and we get plenty of mysteries about the mecha, the pilots, etc.

But it was hard to keep watching this.

The women are universally endowed, which is downright bizarre, but it's the completely Un-likable main character that gave me a sour taste in the mouth. We get the formulaic wimp getting power (hate this boring junk), but instead of remaining a wimp he becomes a complete ass. Complete. But it is actually a different take on the whole kid gets power thing, so good.

I was not quite sure what the purpose of the series was. Where Gurenn Lagann was a tribute to mecha anime that went for over awing human potential, this one was a tribute of a different kind, of motivation. Women are scattered around with completely disposable personalities, and balanced against the main character, who becomes a jerk... Who grows in as realistic a way as the anime could allow. His growth is the focus, but others grow too.

Interestingly, the series has some real heroes and some real moments put into it, which seem placed specifically to bring more attention to their choices. Bizarre. Until you see how they are playing with the motivations of the characters. Interesting.

But give the series a chance. It dedicates to its core ideas well in attempting to make a different motivating force for the characters. There are plenty of surprises, and some truly satisfying turns. I felt that it was just too short, that if it had had more time the development and focus could have been balanced a bit better. There's so much that could be expanded upon!

By the way, I never did fall in love with the music.

in the end, the series doesn't become a classic, but it's definitely a worthy addition to your mecha anime collection. Because unlike classics like Evangellion, this one has ultimately positive motivations behind some terrible events.",1372636800,,1977,4.746355685131196

8532634,4,B008YRL6SQ,I can say a good anime for fans of the mecha genre.  It was just like in previews of it a robot piloted by someone you'd least expect.,1506902400,,134,3.7857142857142856

8532639,5,B008YRL6SQ,I'm not the greatest mecha fan but I really did enjoy this show and can recommend it to anyone liking the Save the Earth from Invasion scenarios. Well done and not so predictable as one might think. Enough twists to keep it interesting. And I think you are doing well when you want to slap some of the characters up side of the head as they work out what they are going to do.,1488758400,,376,4.094594594594595
