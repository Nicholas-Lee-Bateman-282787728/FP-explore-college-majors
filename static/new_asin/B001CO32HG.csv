3514867,3,B001CO32HG,"I have enjoyed the Lovejoy series since it originally aired in the early 90's. I and the family were stationed in East Anglia in England where most of the Lovejoy episodes were filmed; it was fun to watch the show on BBC then to spend the weekends visiting the historic villages and other places we had seen on Lovejoy.  So as a Lovejoy fan and being homesick for the beauties and wonders of East Anglia the Lovejoy DVD's are a treat loved by the entire family.
Now for the Cons: (Not criticizing the series just the quality and manner it is being released.)
The DVD is not worth the $17.00 + S&H. Come on... It should not have been released as a standalone DVD? The two special episodes should have been left as part of the normal DVD series box sets. It makes no sense to break the timeline of the series in this way.
Now I find that the Complete Season 4 DVD is set to release 4 months from now. Why so long? The Lovejoy series ended over 10 years ago. The entire series has been available for sale in the UK for years. Why stretch out the US release dates to over two years? Is it a marketing ploy to test the waters? If season 3 doesn't sell well will season 4 never be released? And another thing, for the price of each season ($50.00 +) the sound and video should have been re-mastered to modern standards.  The people releasing the DVD's are Visigoths with no feel for a classic bit of BBC television.",1225152000,60,1409,4.273408239700374
3514868,3,B001CO32HG,"The first of these two movie-length features is up to the standards of the Lovejoy series and stars the familiar cast.  It's pleasant and entertaining.  The second, however, is an overly-long piece of TV schlock.  Only two regulars are on hand, and no wonder; the script of ""The Lost Colony"" may have embarassed the others.  Thus it's a mixed bag and, given the price, perhaps better forgotten unless you're into throwing money around.",1223856000,10,435,4.917808219178082
3514869,5,B001CO32HG,"Since most British TV series only produce 6-12 episodes a year, popular TV shows produce special Christmas episodes.  Lovejoy had two special  double length episodes.

The Prague Sun (1992) - Lovejoy is alone for Christmas.  But when a friend is attacked, Lovejoy and Eric are off to Prague on a treasure hunt.  And Lady Jane shows up to help out.  Guest Donald Pleasance and Peter Vaughn.

The Lost Colony (1993) - Lovejoy has relatives from America visit.  But when some Sir Walter Raliegh antiques disappear, Lovejoy has to go to Carolina.  But when he gets into trouble, his new love interest Caroline comes to his rescue. Guests Barbara Barrie, Ken Kercheval and John Gielguld.

Lovejoy was an iconoclastic series in England and had a strong following in America.  The show was uniformly excellent.  The Prague Sun is definitely the better of the two episodes.

The one thing to be careful is that these episodes do not appear on another series DVD set. (i.e. the As Time Goes By retrospect special was released seperately, then released with the Series 7 dvd!)",1222992000,42,1066,4.855555555555555

3514902,2,B001CO32HG,"The first special was not our traditional Lovejoy feel or quality and the second was a total waste of time.  Normally I love Christmas specials but these seemed to be thrown together and the Christmas theme was almost totally missing.  I will keep it and watch the Prague escapade again, but will never suffer through the North Carolina adventures again!  Never, ever, ever ever (ha,!)",1411776000,,385,4.892307692307693
3514903,5,B001CO32HG,"If you enjoy the Lovejoy series then you will most certainly want to grab this wonderful buy of the two Christmas Specials.  I was delighted to find them at such a wonderful price.

These two specials are not usually shown with the regular series and the first one (The Prague Sun) was originally shown between the third and fourth seasons.  The second (The Lost Colony) was shown between the fourth and fifth season.

I had just completed watching the third season on Acorn TV and have now watched The Prague Sun.  I was delighted with the quality of the DVD which came in packaging as shown online. The menu was easy to navigate and the DVD played flawlessly.  The color was superb and the quality as good as what I watch on Acorn TV.

This was one of the last few episodes with the original cast and they interacted very well.  There was a bit of ""Christmas"" feel to the special but could certainly be suitable to watch any time of the year.

FYI I was intrigued about the ""Prague Sun""  monstrance and looked it up and was pleased to find there really is a ""Prague Sun"" monstrance in existance.",1409270400,2,1097,4.44

3514919,3,B001CO32HG,"I adore Ian McShane in most anything (Deadwood, Pillars of the Earth, more too numerous to name)so I took a chance on Lovejoy based on a thread recommendation. There's really nothing wrong with it: it's a ""mystery"" in the TV-series, British cozy way, but it's definitely dated (filmed in the 80's, I believe). Viewers, in the meantime, have become more sophisticated and more demanding of realism (or what passes for realism on TV).

I fell in love with Tom Selleck via Magnum, PI, and Lovejoy is sort of the British version of Magnum. It's a fun show, but, I'm sorry to report, nothing overly special. McShane has won me over by playing deep character roles, and this is definitely not that. So just expect a nice British cozy, and you'll be happy with this video.",1298073600,,765,4.666666666666667

""The Lost Colony"" was a disappointment. More like ""Lovejoy"" meets ""The Dukes Of Hazzard"". Is this really the perception the British have of Americans?

I decided that it would be easier to give one as a gift than to totally confuse the issue by returning it.  I have another DVD pre-order coming out in early January.

8288402,5,B001CO32HG,"""Lovejoy"" was originally issued on DVD in 6 Season Sets, with the two Christmas Specials issued on this DVD separately. The Lovejoy Complete Collection, however, includes these Specials.

This is a great comedic mystery series. I would recommend watching these Christmas specials after viewing at least one full season of ""Lovejoy"". I think it would help you know the characters. These are both great episodes, feature length, for a total of 180 minutes of enjoyable viewing. English subtitles are available. There are no bonus features on the DVD set.

""The Prague Sun""
Originally aired December 1992, ushering in the beginning of Season 4, which began airing in January 1993.
Jane springs an unpleasant surprise on Lovejoy. She is going to spend Christmas with her match-making sister at a ski resort. Lovejoy objects: ""Janey, I can understand in your present semi-detached condition that you might need an impulsive meaningless relationship. I just think it should be with me.""
Fortunately for Lovejoy, a puzzle arises to take his mind of the lovely Jane. An old friend had a WWII wartime romance with a Czech pilot and he was presumed killed in battle. Now he turns up in England, fifty years later and very much alive. He really came back to find a cache of diamonds which had been hidden during the war. A deadly search, it turns out.

""The Lost Colony""
Originally aired December 1993, at the end of Season 5, which ran from September to November 1993.
As Lovejoy has only a daughter, he presumes that the last name will die out with him. Then, by accident he meets Mary-John Lovejoy, a southern belle to the tip of her toes. By a concatenation of events, Lovejoy follows her back to North Carolina to meet the rest of the family. Unfortunately, there are deadly shenanigans going on, and someone is going to die.
This special has some great plotting and more double-crosses than you can shake a stick at. It was produced in 1993, but the American characters feel like a 1970 sitcom. Maybe because this is a view of America from across the pond.
Trivia: There really is a town called Lovejoy in North Carolina (but it's located in Montgomery County).

I love Lovejoy!
