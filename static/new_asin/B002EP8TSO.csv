3918738,5,B002EP8TSO,This was a Christmas gift for my daughter.  I even sat down to watch it.  Wonderful story line.  A good series for any anime fan out there.,1356652800,,139,4.074074074074074
3918739,3,B002EP8TSO,"For the truly discerning anime otaku, don't bother. This is not a classic though it is a venerable series. This is a strange combination of shojou and shounen themes with an action setting, but dealing with more drama than a typical shounen show would. If you enjoy watching improbably fantasy bishounen then this is the anime for you.

The first season is by far the best, with entertaining introduction of characters and villains alike. Exploration of the tragic background of our heros is quite fun. Second season is not as good, requiring more suspension of disbelief to enjoy. But still worth it.

The third season is included in this set, but I would recommend against watching it at all. This thin set verses the original two season is what I purchased because it includes the ova, which was worth watching as well for the character development. Too bad that legal conflict prevented them from keeping character designs the same between seasons and the ova, but that's the animation world for you.",1291593600,12,1004,4.8654970760233915
3918740,5,B002EP8TSO,"I got absolutely into this from the very beginning. Knight Hunters is one of the best anime's I've ever watched. Hott guys, just enough violence, and a fairly good plot, I wasn't dissapointed. Yeah, it could have been better in some aspects; the animtion could be better, it could be more realistic (I mean come on, who gets sliced with a sword and doesn't bleed at all?) but overall, I'd say definately a good buy! I really loved it, it's just one of those good ones that's fun to watch. Oh, and Yoji and Aya being so very sexy definately upped my enjoyment factor! :)

That being said, I definately DID NOT like Knight Hunters Eternity. Thank God it was only 3 discs long. (and I couldn't even get through those) Imagine having a good plot, very wonderful characters, then throwing all that into a high speed blender. That's about how it is. But this is definately worth buying just for the 5 disc set of Knight Hunters itself.",1276992000,6,929,4.497041420118343

They all play to a certain point and then crash and you can't even skip past the bad parts.  Happens with every single one of them.  I was very disappointed.",1489190400,,257,4.08
