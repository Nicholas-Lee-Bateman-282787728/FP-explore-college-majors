5751742,5,B00CXWXF8M,"This is David Tennant as we have not seen him, even in Hamlet or as Barty Crouch.  He gives us man
who is not a hateful guy, but who reacts to adversity in the most immoral way.  Tennant shows us
the tension between admirable and despicable in the anti-hero with precision.",1378512000,3,273,4.333333333333333
5751743,5,B00CXWXF8M,"Extraordinary drama, a gripping and powerful portrayal of politics, power, and political marriages.  David Tennant(Aiden Hoynes) and Emily Watson(Freya Hoynes) are brilliant in this film, in roles that are not typical for either one as their characters are not very nice people. In fact most of the characters in this film are not nice people. Tennant portrays Aiden with a very sinister side but with a touch of humanity. Almost all the really emotional scenes belong to Tennant who portrays them with perfection. Emily Watson is brilliant but could have portrayed more emotion. The performances of all the actors are outstanding.  Ed Stoppard as Bruce Babbish is particularly chilling, with friends like him you don't need any enemies. Be aware that their are some strong sexual references in this film including one violet sex act at the beginning of part two between Tennant and Watson.  Many of the tender moments in this film are between Aiden and his father, and Aiden and his son. A very good look into the seedy side of politics. This is a region 2 DVD so you will need a multi-region DVD player ($40 - $50) or play on your computer. I bought my copy at Amazon.uk.co. This film is well worth buying if you love great drama and great acting.",1371081600,8,1249,4.773148148148148
8587399,4,B00CXWXF8M,"... I have always enjoyed the British political intrigue --  and this series is no exception.  What puzzles me why they must have sexual scenes,  which personally does not do anything for the story.  I wonder why they  (whoever they are) must put these scenes in.  Perhaps it might been someone ""living"" out their fantasies ....",1439164800,,328,4.767857142857143

8587402,1,B00CXWXF8M,"Despite the considerable acting talent involved, this story is  bile choked, inane, depraved, dull, and utterly without merit.  The seedy underbelly of politics is a well tread ground, and many depraved characters manage to build interesting or compelling stories.  However, this drama lacks any real heft or spark.  Upon watching it I felt depressed and deflated at the end, which is not a desirable outcome for viewing.",1423094400,,421,5.2388059701492535
8587403,3,B00CXWXF8M,"Not great by any means, especially pitted against all the marvelous British dramas out there these days (Broadchurch, Happy Valley, even Scott & Bailey). But compelling plot and very good acting pushes aside the many flaws and still allows for an enjoyvable viewing experience. The tone at times is needlessly morose and somber, and why they don't have their son in some sort of professional therapy completely escaped me. David Tennant's main duty is to look intently into the middle distance, and even the charming presence of Emily Watson (who doesn't seem really into the role) can't drive it beyond the mildly interesting assessment. Politics is clearly dirty business, and there are some slimy characters in this show. But some of the scenarios and dialogue simply rubbed me the wrong way. I'd recommend several other shows before this one.",1420588800,,846,5.093525179856115
8587404,4,B00CXWXF8M,"It's entertaining and kept my attention so far, although that I slipped away to write this tells me they are losing me in my irritation with the character development. WHY do the Brits repeatedly have such childishly behaving characters to drive forward the story line? I would LOVE to.see one British (or American for that matter) tv show that had some well developed leads.  All that said, I will head back to watch episode 2. You will enjoy thus depending on your level of tolerance for silly behavior AND the plot is pretty good!",1409184000,,533,4.670212765957447

8587408,5,B00CXWXF8M,If you are a fan of David Tennant you have to see this film. In this fast moving film there are twists and turns in the plot that you don't see coming. You will need a multi-region DVD player if you want to watch it in the USA.,1405468800,,227,3.75
