7671809,4,B01C4D4Z4C,"This film, while not perfect was hilarious, gross and fun. This is one of those films that when it gets going, expect to see something so absurd and creative that you are either going to embrace it, or run to your internet offended to share the latest scripture from the bible. This film is dementedly delicious and creatively insane. Only the mad scientist in training at Wild Eye Releasing would put out a film like this. I would assume the title and the cover sort of tip you off to this film and its nature. The last time I seen a film this brave was when Ryan Nicholson gave us  Gutterballs. Like Nicholsons film, this film does has a message and the way it tells that message is thru rape and murder. The gore in this film was a cross between Troma and Nicholson. Clearly,  Gutterballs has inspired others to try gore porn. The finale was smart, it felt almost like something you would expect from old school Larry Clark. It was a cold and bitter flashback scene that showed this film was looking for any way to throw people off balance. Sorry about the inconsistency, I had to severely edit it out..so see the website for the full review.",1469145600,3,1145,4.447619047619048

8752193,2,B01C4D4Z4C,"While this low budget slasher looks like it might be an insane gore-fest, it tends to be more needless dialogue/hard to watch acting. I love crazy movies, but this one sucked. Slim moments of entertainment are masked by a movie that has nothing without an outrageous subject matter, and buddy acting at best. Overall, it only gets the 2nd star for it's originality, and for the production co having the rocks to release such deliberately horrible, piece of crap cinema. This movie is dung. You want a crazy movie, one that will make you question the sanity of the actors and everyone else involved in it? Watch Singapore Sling. I dare you.",1477526400,,639,4.714285714285714
