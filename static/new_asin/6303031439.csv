7835432,3,6303031439,"This 1979-TV movie dealing with a string of hooker murders in seedy Hollywood is like 1984's ""Angel"" without the sex, violence, and profanity. It also lacks the colorful characters that made ""Angel"" such a trash classic.

While ""The Eleventh Victim"" a.k.a ""The Lakeside Killer"" is not a superior film by any means, anyone who's a fan of Bess Armstrong or Max Gail won't be disappointed.

Bess plays a local news anchorwoman in Iowa, who finds out on-air that her little sister is the latest victim of a serial killer offing prostitutes in Hollywood.

She flies to Tinseltown to uncover the reason for her sister's death, and is aided by vice cop Max Gail (and to a lesser degree, Gail's partner, Harold Gould), and eventually the teenage prostitute who was best friends with the dead sister.

The made-for-TV restrictions prevent this movie from being as gritty as it could have been and the ambiguous ending leaves the viewer feeling a little cheated.

It does however, have a few good points in that it features former Animals' lead singer Eric Burdon as a telephone pimp; it boasts an oh-so-70s funky ""Bad Girls""-type disco soundtrack, great location shots of the seedy Hollywood Boulevard circa 1979 and a couple of notable, suspenseful scenes.

There's a great scene where Bess tries to infiltrate the call-girl operation by passing herself off as a ""working girl"" but the woman interviewing her becomes increasingly suspicious.

Also noteworthy is when Bess gets tarted up to meet porn star ""Red Brady"" at a nightclub. Check out those stilettoes, hot pants and halter top!

The cops eventually use Bess as bait to trap the killer but like I said, it just leads to a very unsatisfying ending.

The violence and sex are basically non-existent. You've seen more on a random episode of ""Charlie's Angels"".

Despite the flaws in the script, the acting is decent and if you are a fan of Max Gail or Bess Armstrong, or kitschy TV-movies from the disco era, check this out.

7835433,4,6303031439,"This movie was also titled the 13th victim, so when I searched for it the name change kinda made it difficult to find.  70's suspense movie.  The guy who played on Barney Miller also plays a cop in this movie. I had seen this movie before and actually liked it.  I don't believe that to be the common census.  So if you are planning on buying this one, maybe try and rent it first, because the acting is kinda poor quality and I am sure it was a low budget job.  That being said, I still love this movie, but I love b-flicks.",1244937600,,525,4.058252427184466
