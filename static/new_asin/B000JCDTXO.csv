If a man can hardly read nor write can be enlightened in 3 years by following simple instructions, so everyone is enlightened being after viewing these teachings.",1197417600,,304,5.1

8149950,5,B000JCDTXO,"I consider this film a rare treasure and it became available on tape in 1997 but in 2006 went to DVD. For me it's a meditation, watching the exotic footage and listening to the personal testimonies of luminaries like Jack Kornfield and Stephen Wolinsky about their intimate experiences with Sri Nisargatta Maharaj. He was a smoke shop operator, a householder, and gave talks in his tiny attic in Bombay soon after attaining enlightenmenent.  A most legendary and enigmatic figure among great masters. This was his first exposure on video.  What gained him initial worldwide fame was the publication of the book ""I Am That"" from 1990 written by a westerner Maurice Frydman.  Now many books and several DVD's are available about the master and Advaita Vedanta.  Maharaj died in 1981 at the age of 84.  This teaching will not appeal to everyone because it dismantles all our notions of existence finally leading to the realization that ""All Is Concept""---- my favorite quote from Sri N. Maharaj.",1187481600,3,992,4.951807228915663
