Those words to an interviewer from Pauline Oliveros--one of the founding mothers of said village-cum-metropolis--work equally well applied to her own part of said scene. Everything she does at this point brings to the table a rich mix of traditions and communities in this maverick discourse of ours. In this DVD, that moveable feast also comes from a few fellow chefs.
It presents a live performance of a multimedia piece of theater in the ancient Greek sense of that word: theo-, a spectacle of gods afoot amid cosmos, the earth, and their mortal foils therein. Dancers, singers, solo and in groups; live musicians improvising, taped electronic and electro-acoustic music improvised and composed; filmed images projected through the three-dimensional sculptural installation serving as stage, to fall on their way to backdrop across real (and big, and heavy) rocks hung from steel cables, and a giant latticework web of taut rope, and metal hoop-swings that rise and fall, on all of which bodies perform--they work together like something Sun Ra, Homer, Mr. and Mrs. Coltrane, Isadora Duncan, Sappho, Katherine Dunham, John Cage, the Art Ensemble of Chicago, and Cheikh Anta Diop might have joined forces to cook up for some good teachers and promising students in the new metropolis.
Oliveros music and sound design comprise recorded material dating from 1966 to the present, some added by collaborators in this project (the fruit of a year-long residency at the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Music). The live orchestra foregrounds post-jazz saxophonics and violinics along with  various Maltese woodwinds. Knowing all that, and feeling it in the sound, we encounter the most vital and least insular of the fields of experimental music both composed and performed from high concert tradition and academia; of womens music and world music (in their unquotable aspects); and of improvised music (Oliveros is one of its handful of contemporary roots, along with Cecil Taylor and Ornette Coleman in their other traditions). The hour heard feels like the four-decade utterance it is.
That music is the water in the pot of a tale told by the equally schooled and seasoned Ione, whose script and direction of its enactment add some deep blues to Oliveros signature deep listening. With Joanna Haigoods (aerial, as well as grounded) choreography, they voice and embody the more afrocentric sides mentioned above. Ione re-tells the ancient Greek myth of Io, the woman Zeus seduced then turned into a calf to hide her from his supposedly jealous wife Hera. Here, the male gods selfish lust and deceit are less the way of the world and more a temporary distraction to work through and defeat; Hera is more the goad to help that process along than her husbands enabling tormentor of his victims. Io winds her way through the lethal wiles of the one and the almost-too-strong medicine of the other to find her own immortality, reborn from Argos in Egypt as the goddess Isis.
One noteworthy part of the production is the intermittent stream of filmed images. They look to have been a powerful part of the spectacle, live: a crazed man-face for Zeus, his saintly counterpart on the other side of his turmoil, a serpent, a slow pan suggesting the Sea of Argos rocky sound, the thousand-eyed monster. On DVD, the effect is more that of a classic silent movies special effects--more prosaic, but as evocative.
Describing her myth as taking place in a primeval, cyclical time as ever-present as it is archaic, Ione imagines the emergence of semantic language itself in the addition of vowels to the percussive, textural palette of a consonant speech predating such sense. In fine mythical tradition, she conflates cosmic and geological creation and destruction with the powers of culture, society, and politics both then and now. Her material comes from the historical template of our own worlds founding myths in the birth and rise of literacy--in Mesopotamia, Egypt (with its early vowel-less writing systems), then Greece--which unfolded through several spikes in that now parochial regions warfare and natural catastrophes, as well as in the arts and energies that would mitigate and survive them.
Pauline Oliveross long and thoughtful cultivation of the balance of yin and yang in both improvisation and composition seems just the vessel to carry such prime complexes, and Iones just the mind and voice to match it.",1385510400,2,4527,5.117567567567567
