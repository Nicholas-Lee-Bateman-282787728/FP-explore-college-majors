793620,4,6304137184,"The ""true story"" behind Jean Genet's classic play ""The  Maids"", and a genuine shocker. Joely Richardson puts in a fantastic  performance as the more obsessive and sexual of the two (and after this,  Disney hired her for ""101 Dalmations""?) Graphic, detailed and  compelling. The only slight quibble is an ""over-the-top"" Julie  Walters as their vulgarian employer. You won't forget this little number.",968112000,,399,5.370967741935484
793621,4,6304137184,"A film of amazing patience, and timing. All the performances are first  rate. The story (a true one nonetheless) is compelling. It's a passionate,  heart breaking and horrifying experience ! This film is one of the  forgotten gems of the 90's. Have you heard of it before ? I didn't think  so. But make sure you see it or get this DVD. The films finale and final  sound (the elder sister screaming her younger sister's name) is harrowing,  and unforgettable. Pretty good for a film that was forgotten by everyone  else.",965865600,12,519,4.637362637362638

There is a good sense of foreboding right from the start, but it doesn't  give the story of these two sisters away too early.  There is something  sinister in the air, and the events are quite shocking.  Well acted,  directed and filmed!  There are moments of extreme tension, eroticism, and  then and ending I didn't see coming.  In the end, it's more than just a  little creepy!

Two sisters who have only each other to depend on find themselves in a bond of work, lust, and maddness. I was moved by the slow breakdown of  ones state mind with paranoia, envy, and desperation.

However, with her performance as the older sister Christine, Ms. Richardson  rises above all of its faults. It's her best work: terrifying, lyrical,  unforgettable.

794165,1,6304137184,"This is one of the most boring movies that I have ever seen.
Even the sex scenes were boring.

We watch two sisters working together, cleaning and cooking.
We watch the two women whom they work for knitting and eating.

The backstory on the two sisters is not explained clearly.
They had a horrible childhood, but we only see glimpses and the story is not clear.
They had an older sister who became a nun, and the story is not clear regarding her.
The story of their parents' divorce, which led to them to living in institutions, is not clear.
It is not explained how they were separated or how they found each other again,
or that they had worked as maids in many houses together before.

The ending, where the double murders happen, is not clear.
We don't understand exactly what happened.
It is not clear that the sisters worked exhausting 14 hour days with only a half-day off each week for abusive employers,
which caused them to have breakdowns.
It is not explained exactly how gruesome the murders were.
It is not explained what happened to the sisters after the murders.

In order to understand this story, I actually had to look it all up on Google.
What is the point of telling a true story if you don't tell the story?

I had seen Sister My Sister on YouTube and knew I had to own a copy. The YouTube upload was low definition, fuzzy, its visual details lacking the sharpness the film intended for them. My greatest disappointment with that version, and the only reason I wanted a DVD of the film, was for Joely Richardson's incomparable blue eyes. The YouTube version displayed her eyes darkly, indistinct. Truly, all of the four characters' eyes were indistinct. Truly for good reason.

Several films and many books have treated the historical events about the Papin sisters, household servants who brutally murdered their employer and her daughter in 1933 in Le Mans, France. I've seen three of the films.

This DVD transfer appears to be indistinguishable from an unprofessional consumer video-to-digital copy. It's a pity, because the intelligent and artful set design and superb cinematography deserve better. The film itself and all of its parts overwhelm the presentation defects, and for me those quality defects disappeared quickly and permanently. The film is a slow and quiet accumulation of innumerable subtleties and details. Metaphors abound instead of symbols; the acting and directorial decisions are frighteningly sublime. Everything is presented as a form or style of naturalism, especially the unmade-up sisters (but who curl their hair and hide its length for a fashion-style tintype portrait); yet the naturalistic artifice is provocative, doubtless intended to make emotions and human natures prevail.

The only special effect I noticed is Joely Richardson's dark contact lenses that obscure her otherwise always arresting and often distracting blue eyes.",1473120000,2,1779,5.365591397849462

There is no dought that the two sisters had a major personal conection to each other and even though the director does not go into detail with this part; the last of the house seems to be quite degrading and maybe specifically toward the older sister.

794387,5,6304137184,"Based on the true story of sisters Christine and La Papin in 1933 France, these two French maids reach a breaking point in response to the abusive and slave-like treatment of their cruel employer and brutally murder Madam Danzard and her daughter Isabelle.  If that wasn't scandalous enough, these two sisters share a wildly dependent and passionate bond that becomes sexual during the course of their intensely stressful servitude.

Not a story for the faint of heart.  And yet it was told here with the utmost degree of class and elegance, and never once delved into gratuitous gore or an exploitation of lesbianism (or incest).  Despite how graphic the murder actually was (eyeballs were found about), nothing graphic will be seen here... yet the palpable intensity around what goes down will make you feel like you were there in the midst of something truly hideous.

And yeah, incest.  Can you believe these two women pull it off without making you gag?  Got sisters?  yep, me too.  But I'd kill 'em before ever boinking them, lol.  Because.  ewww.  ahaha.  And yet Joely Richardson and Jodhi May got away with it here.  Somehow their connection just makes you so sad for them.  They are so emotional and isolated... completely alone in the world and enslaved in this creepy household.  They just withdraw into their own little world and when things slip into the darkly erotic... you won't wanna believe they're sisters, lol.  And it's oh so believable.  Their lustful, needy chemistry is beyond palpable.  Nothing sexually graphic is shown beyond some very passionate kissing and touching.

The acting is just amazing.  Oh the power of top-notch characterizations!!! That alone drove the story and not much else was needed.  The neurotic loon who plays the mother (Julie Walters) puts a whole new layer of crazy on crazy bitch.  Scary.  The only thing worse than working for a bully is to be stuck with one 24/7 in her crazy house. Mother and daughter are just as weirdly dysfunctional and isolated as the maids.  But I couldn't help siding and sympathizing with these two sisters.  The cinematography gave the story such presence.  And considering there is basically only the 4 females composing the whole cast... and the house is almost entirely the only setting... wow.  So atmospheric.  You get the isolated feeling of being trapped in this bleakly pristine home with an employer who has nothing better to do than monitor your every move while viciously criticizing every task at hand... with a white glove, no less...

If you can appreciate a beautifully done story without getting caught up in the taboo subject matter... this 1994 film is definitely worth watching.  Or rewatching.",1397433600,5,2695,4.948660714285714
794388,5,6304137184,"The cinematography and casting of this film is what makes me watch it again and again. It amazes me that four actresses can lead an entire film with only two very very brief appearances with extras. The last time I watched this film I believe I counted only seeing seven people in the entire movie. Besides those four main actresses, I don't recall any of the extras having any lines. The movie almost entirely takes place inside of the house where Christine and Lea work with small glimpses into a photography studio, the house they grew up, the street, and the park. The movie's simplicity wows me.

The story line is also one I'm personally interested. The story of the Papin sisters has always intrigued me. I think this movie is a beautiful version of their story. It's taboo and unexpected and makes for the perfect storyline.

I can say that this is my favorite movie, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for something simple and surprising. For not having amazing special effects, bells and whistles, or big name actresses this movie is more than excellent.",1377302400,2,1072,4.696808510638298

794431,3,6304137184,"Overall, this was an intriguingly good movie, based on a true story. However this is not a family movie, about two sisters.
The story is set in the 1920's in France, and follows two sisters, one newly out of the convent, in their employment for a somewhat tyranical woman and her daughter. Well, things get a little too cozy with the sisters, who are, after all, somewhat emotionaly stunted by unknown traumas in their lives.
I won't give it all away, but to say that it doesn't turn out well for any of the residents of the house. It's an unfortunate story that makes you think about how easily, perhaps, their lives could have turned in an entirely new direction, if only they had made a different decision, here and there.
The story was good, the acting was great, and the eroticism was done very well. You were captivated even though in the back of your mind, you're reminding yourself, ""These are sisters, right?""  Very nicely done little movie that probably will be overlooked by most people.

794436,4,6304137184,"This is the film that served as my belated introduction to France's Papin Sisters, Lea and Christine.  When in their twenties, they viciously murdered their employer and her unfortunate daughter, while monsieur was away.  ""Sister My Sister"", written by one Wendy Kesselman, leaves monsieur out, replaces the relatively unattractive Papins with two photogenic British actresses, and proceeds to be both ominously claustrophobic and extremely erotic--all despite, alas, both girls remaining clothed.  Joely Richardson (daughter of Vanessa Redgrave) and a very young Jodhi May give monumental performances; and the chemistry between the two is quite extraordinary.  Early on in the film, it becomes apparent that this is far from your run-of-the mill sisterly relationship, when, after a quarrel over their despotic and devisive mother, Lea and Christine begin acting conspicuously like lovers.  As their incestuous (not to mention lesbian) romance blossoms, we become aquainted with The Danzards, a pathetic, utterly dysfuntional, co-dependent mother and daughter, who, in comparision, make their servants seem almost normal.  They spend entirely too much time cooped up together in their gloomy, forebidding, rain-drenched home, with nothing better to do than play the piano (badly), engage in meaningless card games(meaningless except for the one intercut with the sisters making love upstairs), and pry into the comings and goings of the increasingly distracted Lea and Christine.

794438,4,6304137184,"There is a saying that damaged people are very dangerous. One extreme case of damage turning people dangerous is the famous case of France's Christine and Lea Papin, who shocked the nation in 1933 by not merely committing murder, but by doing so with such violence that no one could really understand what had happened, ""Sister My Sister"" is a very accurate, fascinating psychological study of four women in le France profound, a small provincial town where class rules, family behavior, Catholic restrictions combined to make life so circumscribed that any sort of freedom was impossible, even in one's own home. This fact is  addressed with light charm in the film ""Chocolat"" where chocolate-eating equals sinning (unthinkable to us!) and being ""different"" is nearly criminal, but to those who lived in these places in the not so distant past, one's life was never unscrutinized by someone, somewhere, and for domestics, the mistress or master of the house could become a genuine tyrant, terrorizing the staff into desperation. For those who could not escape to a loving family, or Paris, or any place but where they were stuck, life had to be lived as best as possible. In fact, the costume designer of ""Chocolat"" pointed out that in the towns they scouted, people were still dressed in clothes from the 1st half of the century; change is slow and progress practically non-existent.

The two sisters, powerfully portrayed by Joely Richardson as the elder Christine, and Jodhi May as the younger, Lea, have only one another for the most part. Their mother,seen abandoning Christine at the start of the film, is an enemy to Christine who, once Lea joins her, encourages Lea to break her ties to her mother immediately. The mother rejected all her daughters, seemingly hating and especially rejecting Christine (see ""The Papin Sisters"" by Rachel Edwards & Keith Reader), placing her in an orphanage at an early age, and later valuing her only for the money she could earn as a maid. Her mother`s contempt, contrasted with her treatment of Lea (who was also placed in an orphanage, but visited and lovingly corresponded with), and who was petted and sometime held, stimulated intense jealousy in Christine, who both loved and loathed her Maman. At the time the story starts, Lea has been rescued from the orphanage, as Christine has contrived to talk the mistress of the house, Madame Lancelin (Danzard in this film), to hire her as a second domestic. Julie Walters as Madame alternates between a sort of genuine joie de vivre that sometimes becomes hysteria, and a controlled cruelty that astonishes and hurts her two maids and even her deeply imperfect daughter (she's chubby and not always perfectly behaved, as young girls are won't to be).

The relationship between the sisters is already fraught with tension, as Christine is always on the edge of an explosion having lived a loveless, empty life of servitude and repeated rejections, and now holds herself in so tightly it's as though she's bound herself up in razor-wire. Richardson communicates this through the intense and  forced stillness of her body. One imagines that by the end of a day's shoot, the actress needed an hour-long shower and long massage just to be able to bend over and touch her toes. Christine is also still holding a raging jealousy in check, furious with Lea for continuing to correspond with their mother and furious with their mother for taking their very hard-earned money. She's even jealous when Lea makes tentative contact with Madame's daughter, Isabelle. Unfortunately, it is quickly apparent that Lea's arrival provides no relaxation, but rather an increased tension as Christine tries to hold her love, both appropriate and inappropriately possessive, in check, until it is released through physical passion. Their incestuous relationship seems born of desperation on Christine's part--the need to possess totally her sister, and on Lea's, the natural need for physical contact and natural emerging sexuality. Christine has filled the years of waiting for Lea by making gorgeous lace clothing for her, a trousseau almost, and when she tries on the first of the lovely garments, her beauty overwhelms Christine, who seems nearly out of her mind with tormented worship of her young sister, while Lea seems merely curious and desirous of pleasure. But there is very little overt sexuality, only intense, tightly held passion, so if you're looking for a voyeuristic lesbian peep-show, you'll be disappointed. But if you're interested in a genuine attempt to unravel this psychological puzzle, ""Sister My Sister"" is the real deal.

The victims, the employer and her late adolescent daughter, Isabelle are the other two women in this man-less world (the girls' father abandoned the family when they were tiny), and M. Lancelin has been left out of this film, though it's never stated that he's dead or divorced--merely not there for any of the scenes we see. In reality, it was he who came home to find his wife and daughter horribly murdered and mutilated, and knowing that makes his absence seem more psychological than physical. The sisters never speak to their employers, who are themselves locked in an intense, controlling relationship, where the daughter has no freedom at the moment, nor any real prospects for marriage--Isabelle seems to have no friends, they have no company, they are alone together all the time--so the claustrophobic sense of the house grows as the four of them seemed locked in, like inmates in an asylum, which is what Director Nancy Meckler makes the home feel like. Between Madame's tendency to hysteria, her daughter's sullenness, Christine's barely reined-in hatred of everyone but Lea, and Lea's constant terror (which started in the lonely orphanage and haunts her with nightmares and a deep fear of punishment by Madame and of Christine`s sudden jealous rages), the disaster at the end of the end of the road seems inevitable.

Class lines keep the girls and their employers inextricably separate. Madame speaks about them in their presence as though they're invisible, yet she never takes her eyes off the two of them. In fact, the theme of omniscience, of the never-ceasing and always critical gaze of Madame and her daughter, the sense that their mother is ""watching"" them from afar, the constant vigilance for sin in the nun-operated orphanage that remains with them well into their adulthood, their  constant fear of always of being judged and always judged ill, creates a tension in the house that builds to breaking point. Even Christine never stops watching and judging herself, disallowing imperfection in even the smallest thing, and alternately scrutinizing Lea, looking for the betrayal she's certain will come and exploding in small furies at her, then watching her for mistakes so that she can cover for Lea to protect her from Madame`s increasingly distressing criticisms. Lea's choice to wear a sweater made for her by Christine causes Madame to become outraged, especially at the good quality of the wool--inappropriate for a mere maid--yet she speaks that outrage to her daughter rather than to the present Lea, saying, ""How dare she wear such a thing? Who does she think she is?"" again reinforcing the boundaries of class. Their uniforms must be perfect, every bit of work they do must be perfect--a speck of dust is cause for serious and seemingly out of proportion anger on the part of Madame; finally a minor (to us) but calamitous (to them) housekeeping disaster breaks the high-wire they're all walking, and the tension breaks into explosive rage. Madame's nearly final words about the maids, as they come in from a Sunday outing and huddle together without speaking to either of the other two women as they pass them, is ""They don't even look like maids any more."" This seems to genuinely offend (and puzzle) Madame. Somehow, the maids have passed out of her knowledge, and by doing so have made her a real enemy, as their mother has been.

Interestingly, it was Madame who instigated the attack, verbally assaulting the girls after having come home to find the house dark after a fuse has burnt out. There is a broken glass in the sink, which enrages her further, and Isabelle's blouse is burnt (the iron had blown the fuse--a constant problem that Madame had refused to spend money on the proper repair of) and realizes the girls are locked in their room. When she demands they come down and out, she really lets Christine have it for these ""crimes"", then, voicing her suspicion, accuses  her  of ""smelling of it,"" and indeed the two had retreated to bed, awaiting Madame's return in terror. All four have lost any sense of proportion about everything--it's inconceivable to us to imagine a murder being set off by burning a blouse--but it's often the littlest thing that brings situations to a head when everyone has taken extreme positions in such a perverse  dynamic.

The murders were so bloody that to learn of  them brings to mind the Manson or Wonderland murders, with one significant difference--eyes. The girls come down, with their hair down, in the nightgowns, clearly at breaking point, and when Madame insults Lea, Christine flies apart and the two girls meet the attack with all their bottled up rage by gouging out, with their fingers, the eyes that have followed them through their every move for months now. This detail is nearly unique in the history of murders, and seems to be the reason so much attention has been given to the puzzle of why they did this. They continue to cut and slice at the bodies until they are unrecognizable, but even that had a point--one of the women`s legs was sliced like a baguette, perfectly, another as carefully prepared meat, as though to prove that the maids knew how to bake bread and cook properly, despite Madame`s increasing criticisms of their formerly highly praised dinners. These bizarre details speak to a specific psychology that keeps people trying to break into these women's minds to get the exact answers they seek.

Though blood runs in rivers down the staircase, most of the attack is off-screen and only by reading the book does one learn all the shocking details beyond the judge`s off-screen description of the horror after the fact, while the camera floats up the stairs to where the girls wait, huddled in their dark bedroom, clutching one another in terror. Having descended so far into madness, they seem unable to conceive an escape.

Fragments of the trial are heard only, off-screen, over the image of the terrified girls. Christine was sentenced to the guillotine, but her sentence was commuted. She begged for Lea once, then never spoke her name again, dying in an asylum a mere four years later, completely broken down in body and mind. Lea served a 20-yr sentence, then went back into service until her death in the early 1982. But still, the case fascinates because of the bizarre details of violence done by two young women.

This same story is told much more straightforwardly in ""Murderous Maids"" but for genuine insight into the psychological situation, `Sister My Sister"" is the better film.  Meckler's direction is as tight and detail-oriented as Madame would have wanted, and by keeping such control, she creates a beautiful film of real depth that helps us to unlock the mystery of this case. It's gorgeous cinematography (looking like a series of Rembrandt paintings), intense performances, claustrophobic set of the stuffy drawing room, the tiny whitewashed space the girls are crammed into in the attic, small details like the never-ending dripping of the faucet in the kitchen or the women playing the piano together but not freely, but to the tick-tock of a metronome to reinforce the need for ""perfection,"" the use of mirrors and double images (the famous photograph of the two is re-created here, with Christine proudly refusing a ""lower-class"" discount from the never seen male photographer; this photograph was inspired when Madame and her daughter had one done), the consistent keeping of men off-screen, making this a very specific women's story (in fact, all four women were menstruating at the time of the murders--another mirror and rather odd detail that makes this even more of a women's story, whether one considers it significant or not). It speaks too of the tragedy that can come from the choice-less, forced into home-bound lives of women in a small-minded community, the limitations of strict class lines, and of course, the damage done to abandoned children. It is an irony of the story that the two pairs of women, while of different classes, both suffer from the same limitations put upon women when they are expected to be in service to the society's expectations, rather than in service to their own internal needs . In my own reading and viewing depictions of this most fascinating case, I've found this to be the closest one can get, perhaps, to understanding these tragically repressed young women and the equally repressed women who were their victims.",1138838400,43,13028,4.990791896869245

794440,5,6304137184,"There is a major player in this extremely fine film who goes all but unmentioned: the work of cinematographer Ashley Rowe is some of the finest on film, creating an atmosphere solely within the confines of a home made dark by lack of light and by brooding madness and murder.  The effect achieved is nothing short of miraculous and further adds to the importance of this under-rated movie.

Based on the infamous Papin sisters' murder of their employer and daughter in 1932 in France, SISTER MY SISTER is based on a play by Wendy Kesselman (who also wrote the mesmerizing screenplay) and is directed by the imaginatively fine Nancy Meckler.  Two sisters - Christine the eldest (Joely Richardson) and Lea (Jodhi May) are shown during the titles in black and white as poor orphans separated to different ends.  As the film begins Christine has introduced her estranged beloved Lea to her employer, the rigid and strange Madame Danzard (Julie Walters) and her wallflower daughter Isabelle (Sophie Thursfield).  Lea is hired by the penny pinching Madame Danzard and the two sisters co-serve as maids to the household.  Christine and Lea view each other as not only sisters but as lovers and it is this latter role that leads Madame Danzard (spying contemptibly on the girls) that is the final straw in Madame's mistreatment of the girls that leads to the rather shocking murder of both Madame Danzard and Isabelle.  We know from the start - both from the infamous case and from the opening sequences where the blood of the deed is seen along the stairwell - what the ending will be: it is the progress to that end that concerns the film.

Each of the actresses is brilliant in their roles, roles that are far cries from the usual types that each actress has played.  Julie Walters manages to ooze vitriol while moments later being oddly comedic in her la-la land of dancing to her Victrola.  Joely Richardson is terrifyingly strange and Jodhi May says more with her facial expressions than legions of actors do with complex scripts.  But again the physical ominous presence of the house of bad things is so magnificently created by Rowe's creative photography that is becomes of equal importance as a character.  The musical score by Stephen Warbeck works solidly to convey the descent into madness of the two sisters.  A brilliant tour de force for all concerned and highly recommended for those who love fine acting and dark thrillers.  Grady Harp, September 05",1126656000,7,2459,4.837708830548926
794501,5,6304137184,"Not everyone will like this film; some will not as its frankness in dealing with the subject matter is daring although it achieves its purpose. I however, loved it for the incredible performances of the four women in its cast and the appropriate darkness with which they made this film work.

Julie Waters as Mdme. Danzard, the miserly pocketed and mean spirited mistress is totally unlike the comedic roles she made famous in Educating Rita and Calendar Girls, Sophie Thursfield as her long suffering, spoiled and myopic daughter bring the notion of burgeois and class struggle to a new level. Joely Richardson as Christine, Jodhi May as her young sister, Lea, make us cry and struggle to believe in them and their deplorable life despite the horrible crime they commit.

Adapted from Wendy Kesselman's play about the very real French Papin sisters, this story should be dark as the common household structure of that period could be and often was tragic for those oppressed by their employers. The disturbing results of the stifling confinement of Christine and Lea can be accepted though not easily understood. This film is about the terrible struggle for two young women when presented with no real life but the humiliating oppression of a hardhearted and demanding mistress.

Look beyond the darkness and oppression however, you will see two fine performances and two exceptional ones. Richardson, of the famous Redgrave clan, creates a Christine as strong as four ply glass but equally as brittle. Stuck with no prospects but the unending toil, she has only her younger sister Lea to turn to for everything else in their limited lives and tiny twin bed living quarters. Lea, played by the then 18 year old May, pre-Oxford, captures the heart of innocence and beauty, reaching out the only way and to the only love she will ever have, her sister.  That love, so delicately and carefully shaped is even more threatened and brittle than Christine's resolve. That it results in such an unconventional love is understandable, the shocking tragedy when that love is threatened is not and remains with one long after the picture is over.",1124409600,4,2136,4.9581005586592175
794502,4,6304137184,"This is a hauntingly beautiful film, with a top-notch cast delivering a highly suspenseful drama. The walls with their almost sterile colours make the setting an almost chokingly uncomfortable one. But that only enhances the main idea of the story, that of recreating one of the most debated true stories in the French criminal legend. The one with the two Papin sisters. The honest portrayals by actresses May, Walters etc give the story an urgent and immediate feel, reminding me of other strong female characterisations in films such as ""Show Me Love"" and ""Heavenly Creatures"". This film is a must see, if you are fond of either one of those two titles.

Did I mention it is a beautiful film? The colours and lighting are quite stunning, mastered in the hands of Ashley Rowe, the director of photography. But why, oh why, did Koch Lorber Films release this in a ""Pan & Scan"" format?! ""Sister My Sister"" is a thought-provoking drama that won't entertain the action-craving public. So maiming the memorable cinematography just for the sake of making it a ""Full Frame"" presentation was rather pointless. The VHS release (1995) by A-Pix Entertainment was a bit more true to the original, leaving most of the sides of the picture while maintaining a small black top-and-bottom border (as seen on a 4:3 format TV screen). I'll stick to that one, for the time being.",1122854400,5,1362,4.84549356223176
794503,2,6304137184,"One of the great pleasures of the ""art film"" lies in the way they are able to present the most prurient aspects of human nature, whilst maintaining that air of ""Emperor's new clothes"" respectability. It's a great way to slow your car down to watch the aftermath of a traffic accident, comfortable in the knowledge that YOU are watching the blood pool on the ground for much higher reasons than the proles in the other lane; which brings me (kicking and screaming), to Sister My Sister.
Based loosely on the actual events of the Papin murder case, Sister My Sister plays out like a Merchant Ivory version of Heavenly Creatures, sans the innovative cinematics, and careful plot and character development. One very quickly gets the impression once the film begins, that the sensational aspects of the Papin case alone were considered to be enough to hold your interest; in my case at least, it wasn't.
As stated several times in other reviews, the performances of the two leads are indeed excellent, and a large part of what keeps you watching. Although the two young women look nothing alike, they somehow manage to convey a very convincing sibling bond, all-the-more praiseworthy in the context of this film, as they certainly got little help from the director, and none at all from the screenplay. Quite simply, the problem with Sister My Sister is plausibility. How can that be when it's based on a true story you ask? Easy. The film offers next-to-no backstory on the the two girls or, for that matter, the ""repressed"" Mother and daughter employers. All we are told, is that the mother of the maids favours the younger girl, and takes a great deal of their wages (a common custom of the era). We are never, for a moment shown or even pointed-to a sensible reason or motive for their impending madness, so that when it ultimately erupts at the end of the film, it comes off as a last-minute afterthought on the part of the script.
The sisters work for a fairly petty and picky aging widow who, at least on screen, is no more opressive or cruel than petty and picky people we have all probably worked-for at one time or another, leaving you with an ending that makes little-to-no sense whatsoever. The victims have done nothing remotely bad enough to rationally explain their brutal murder, leaving only complete madness on the part of the sisters as an explanation; yet unlike in the afore-mentioned Heavenly Creatures, there is practically no view of any descent into madness either. The sisters  become suddenly insane in the last 10 minutes of the picture, making for a highly implausable and unsatisfying ending. It could be that a lot of exposition was edited-out for whatever reason, but what remains seems like 80 minutes of the girls somberly doing chores, having sex, and going for walks, occasionally punctuated by the matron complaining about their dressmaking skills, followed by 5 minutes of confrontation and murder that barely seem to belong in the rest of the film you just watched.
The ""wink-wink"" scenes are indeed strangly erotic, for the one or two of you who are interested, (ok, maybe more than one or two) but you can't help but think, while watching the 3rd or 4th heavy-breathing montage, that the interest of the filmaker was clearly more focused on this aspect than in actually watching these characters develop.
The mother and daughter are merely every matron stereotype you've ever seen, and exist for no other reason other than being the needed antagonists for our incestuous ""heroes"".  By the standard, liberal, conventions of modern film, you are supposed to hate them. They are rich and upper-class and therefore ...er...bad. They sneer at the odd, silent, creepy, almost zombie-like maids who rarely leave their room, and we are supposed to think that's intolerant I suppose. No one I've ever known would let these two creepy, girls sleep under the same roof with them for all the tea in China, but well, that's Hollywood for you.
Sister My Sister is not good storytelling or a good character study, in fact, it barely seems to attempt either. It is a series of prosaic episodes, interspersed with hushed, gauzy love scenes. You never get to know or understand the people in the house, and considering the cameras basically never leave that house, I would certainly call that a failure, but then again, looking at the DVD cover, I doubt this review will stop you ;)",1089849600,7,4400,4.818783068783069
794504,4,6304137184,"Set in the 1930's, in the small town of Le Mans in France, two sisters, Christine, the eldest & Lea, the kyounger, are hired on as cook and chambermaid to an upper middle-class widow & her only daughter, Madame and Madamoiselle Lancelin. Based on France's true crime of the century, Julie Walters as the perfectionistic & haughty, Madame Lancelin & Joely Richardson as the eldest master manipulator sister, Christine Papin turn in EXCEPTIONAL performances & the rest of the cast is well above average in their undertakings also.
In February, 1933, the whole of France was horrified to learn of an unspeakably savage double murder that had taken
place in the town of Le Mans. Two respectable, middle-class women, mother and daughter, had been murdered by their
maids, two sisters who lived in the house. The maids had not simply killed the women, but had gouged their eyes out
with their fingers while they were alive and had then used a hammer and knife to reduce both women to a bloody pulp.
The full force of the attack was directed at the heads and the victims were left literally unrecognizable.
Adding the bizarre to the horrifying, the sisters made no attempt to escape (...) Interesting, no? This naturally added a dimension of scandal and titillation to the case. Were the maids having a sexual relationship? If so, it was both homosexual and incestuous. Overnight, the two sisters, aged 21 and 27, became France's most infamous couples who kill.
This film delves into all the speculation of the case but also has some unexplained parts about the sisters' youth & their obvious mistreatment & abuse.
There are quite a many double entendres & a look into both couples chiefly meaning the two sisters and the mother and daughter Lancelin relationships.  Many similarities occur between Madame Lancelin & Christine as far as their perfectionistic attitudes & control issues.  The Madamoiselle Lancelin & Lea Papin also have commonalities inasmuch they are both trapped, shy and easily influenced by the former...
Highly interesting & thought provoking movie.  Especially since it REALLY HAPPENED!",1081123200,32,2101,5.031609195402299
794505,4,6304137184,"Sister My Sister (Meckler) is a rather tawdry tale of French sister-maids who lived in Le Mans, working for a mother and her daughter in the early 1930s. The sisters were oddly attached to each other, spending every moment either working together, or other, questionable activities.
Already dramatized in Genet's The Maids (which was made into another film, Murderous Maids, the real-life Papin women present a psychological study of how close is too close in sibling adoration.
In Sister My Sister, Joely Richardson and Jodhi May pull off spot-on performances, staying true to the compulsive natures of the women, while the household of the Danzard's is presented as more of a macabre flashback to the emotional abuse suffered by the sisters at the hands of their mother.
This entire film is wonderfully dark in characters, satire, sets, lighting, and subject.
The mother and daughter are quirky, darkly homo-erotic, and without restraint as the sisters scurry about, repressed as hell.
There is double entendre to spare in this brilliant piece.",1077840000,,1046,5.195266272189349

794508,5,6304137184,"While a movie like this is bound to attract a few empty-headed perverts in search of using lesbian titillation for a good time, this movie could only pander to the most inane and pathetic male.
The film is about two strange, but tightly bonded girls who are forced to live as maids due to a lack of income otherwise.  A very twisted love story grows based on the familial love that we all have for our close family members, but for them it extends to an obsessive/possessive/desparate love which fears the departure of the other...  The older sister, Christine, has a particularly hard time of it with her mounting paranoia and mental degeneration from being in a miserable household with an unyieldingly cruel woman whose temperment is cold, controlling and unsympathetic.  The resulting feeling throughout the film is eerie creepiness...and building.  You won't want to sleep alone.",987552000,9,884,4.993197278911564
794509,5,6304137184,"Once, in a great while, a film is released that completely shakes your long held beliefs on morality, the politics of class and justice.  This is just such a film.  Centering on the relationship between two sisters employed as maids in the household of an upper class woman in provincial France, this film is absolutely stunning to behold.  Julie Walters gives a fantastic performance as the arrogant and demanding employer who ruthlessly controls the hired help while simultaneously chipping away at her daughter's sense of self worth.
Jodhi May lends an air of youthful naivete to the film as Lea, the devoted younger sister who is the constant favorite of all who meet her.  But what makes this film truly superb is Joely Richardson's portrayal of the confused and tortured older sister, Christine.  Richardson is able to convey a wealth of emotion with nothing more then a solitary glance and the viewer is left feeling absolutely shattered as they see the gradual physical and psychological disintegration of Richardson's character.
It is no surprise that the film builds to an unbelievable climax of brutality and murder.  Nancy Meckler's use of foreshadowing is skillfully done as she presents a situation that can only end in tragedy for all those involved.  What may be the most shocking aspect of all, is that this film was inspired by actual events.",980035200,11,1360,4.991150442477876

7862978,4,6304137184,"I think the film does an excellent job creating an atmosphere of increasing oppression, ultimately culminating in folie a deux. This often leads to deeply uncomfortable moments throughout, but especially toward the end of the film. The direction is good, the script tight, and the acting superb. The cast is among the smallest I've ever seen in a full-length film, and each brings to life the role they're given. Though never explicitly stated, the film is obviously based upon the story of the Papin sisters. To be honest, I find the true story much more intriguing...So, if you're looking for an atmospheric film with deep psychological overtones, this is a great choice. If you're interested in the Papin sisters, I'd recommend a documentary.",1517011200,,745,5.065040650406504

7862981,5,6304137184,"I just watched on amazon prime Sister My Sister and was totally engrossed. The true story about two servant sisters in a 1930's French town. The sisters work as servants in the household of Julie Waters who runs her house with a iron fist, which leaves the sisters with only themselves to show any amount of compassion towards each other. It's sort of implied that their mother is more of a leech then a true caretaker. The love of the sisters for each other turns into more  of a sexual nature that in the long run turns into violence towards their employer. Joely Richardson and Jodhi May play the sisters with  great intensity. Awesome acting all around by the amazing cast. I been watching may of the different films here on amazon prime and this is one of the better ones.  I'm still thinking of the high intensity of this film a day later. Highly recommended!
