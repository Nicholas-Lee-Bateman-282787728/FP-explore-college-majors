3520253,4,B001CVS6BQ,I read all the 1 stars and 2 stars review. Either they have bad blu-ray players or tv is not quite adjusted right(calibrated). The film is recorded in ultra high definetion. The images are sharp and clear. Colors are vibrant and beautiful. I pop this program in when I'm showing off my 73 inch Mits. DLP. The bad side is the audio tracks. 3 Tracks to choose from. 2 annoying music tracks and 1 sounds like someone is running water in the sink. Over all the picture quality is sweet.,1257206400,2,482,4.366666666666666
3520254,3,B001CVS6BQ,"A very pretty picture but lacks the ""wow factor"" one would expect from 1080p. The audio is fair.",1254355200,2,96,4.388888888888889
3520255,5,B001CVS6BQ,"I really like the Aquarium DVD, it actually looks like your looking into a Large Aquarium right in your Living room. The Colors are so Vibrant and with water moving you feel like you could just reach out and touch the tank.",1252713600,,223,4.333333333333333
3520256,3,B001CVS6BQ,"I expected brighter colors of the fish, more of them and more light in the aquarium. It is relaxing to have on. The high def is just fine.",1247184000,,138,3.9642857142857144
3520257,2,B001CVS6BQ,"Not sure what I was expecting but being I have a 47"" 1080P set I wanted to feel like I had a huge fish tank in the room.  Well it does that, kind of.  It feels like they used a much smaller tank than even my TV.  You can tell the tank seems small and the amount of different fish is defiantly lacking after watching for about 10 minutes you  feel like you watching a loop and not the pure feeling of a real fish tank.  The quality is great and running in full resolution it is the content that is lacking.  I would have loved to have seen some spectacular different tanks and seeing a lot of different fish.

If you can buy this DVD on sale and want something to pop in while you have company over for a cocktail party or get together so you won't have to look a huge black hole of a large TV that is exactly what this is good for.",1245110400,,831,3.9107142857142856
3520258,3,B001CVS6BQ,"I was worried about the video quality after reading a few reviews, but this has lived up to my expectations.  I am using on a 46in Samsung 1080p television, and it looks really sharp.  This is exactly what I wanted for ambiance at parties...where you don't want overly distracting content playing on the TV.  It really is nearly convincing enough to make you believe this could be a real aquarium..  The bubbling sound effects are good, although I plan to play my own music when using this.  The ""spa"" inspired sound tracks are not really my thing.  Also, there are 3 tank scene options, but the only one I really like is the first (default) one...the second one is ok, but the third one is too zoomed to be believable.  It wasn't really clear to me at first that I had to activate the ""popup menu"" via my Sony Blu-Ray remote in order to access scene and sound options...that probably should have been in some form of instruction on the package.",1238025600,15,945,4.491228070175438
3520259,1,B001CVS6BQ,"The worst Blu-ray disc ever made, the quality and scenes are boring, there are a few fishes, nothing more. The bonus are terrible, and the image quality is not compatible with a blu-ray disc.",1235433600,2,191,4.647058823529412
3520260,4,B001CVS6BQ,"This is a very relaxing Blu-ray.  I like the video (3 tanks) and audio (aquarium sounds or 2 relaxing tracks) options accessible from the pop-up menu.  Within each tank, the camera angle changes periodically in such a manner that keeps your interest but doesn't distract you.  The picture quality is also outstanding. 2 thumbs up!",1231718400,,330,4.963636363636364
3520261,2,B001CVS6BQ,They must have filmed a very small aquarium; same 2-3 fish swimming in circles. Also although it claims to be HD it doesn't appear to be even with upconverting.,1231200000,4,160,4.551724137931035
3520262,4,B001CVS6BQ,"This product is exactly what it claims to be - a colorful, mostly high quality blu ray of a couple of aquariums.  Of course it's no substitute for the real thing, but I have my 52"" LCD built into a cabinet and it definitely gives the ambiance of having a built-in aquarium.  It injects a sense of calm into the room while we're sitting around talking or reading.
The shots are all fixed - no panning, no zooming.  Each shot is a portion of an aquarium that stays fixed for a few minutes, then it cuts to another portion of the same aquarium.
It's 1080p so it fills your 16x9 screen with no bars at the top or side.

There are 3 scenes to choose from:
Tank 1 - a colorful tank with various types of coral and a dozen or so tropical fish that make appearances at various times.

Tank 2 - a more natural setting with more muted colors.  There are some flourishes of fish, but mostly the fish population is fairly sparse throughout most of this one.  The camera cuts to a slightly different view after a few minutes showing more of a close up of the large sea anemone but putting the coral in the background pretty out of focus.  It's probably intentional, but a little distracting if you're staring at it - certainly not a scene to use to show off your HDTV. Like the others, after a few more minutes it cuts to another view of the tank with quite a few colorful fish in this one.

Bonus Tank - a closeup on a conch shell in what appears to be Tank 1, with a few Nemo fish hanging out.  It's ok, but I don't see myself using this much, if at all.
I find Tank 1 to be the best - very relaxing with lots of color, and fish on the screen at all times.
It automatically switches from tank 1 to tank 2 with about 5 seconds of black screen between the two, so if you want just one tank, you'll need to set your player to repeat the chapter you want.

As far as audio goes, there are 3 soundtracks available in either 5.1 surround or 2 channel stereo:
Natural - aquarium bubble sounds.  This is for ambience so the sound is mixed way in the background.
Calm - relaxing spa type electronic music.  Ok, except for the drone that enters and exits once a minute or so that sounds like an airplane flying through your media room - strange.
Slow - more spa type new agey music with a synthesizer loosely mimicking air bubbles.
The music is ok, but not my taste.  Fortunately you can set it to natural and just listen to the bubbles or set your receiver or TV to play another music source.

All in all, especially considering the low price, I'm pleased with this one.",1228521600,38,2550,4.186094069529652

3520277,5,B001CVS6BQ,"Very colorful, high-density, relaxing dvd.  Comforting water sounds and enjoy the various coral, plants and fish.  Best buy if you don't live near the ocean or under it!",1396396800,,169,5.0
3520278,4,B001CVS6BQ,"Finally found aquarium Blue ray :)
Pros:  -made well  picture is great.  Recorded at high level.
- nice variety of fish
-two tank views.  One zoomed in and fish are really big or one view with fish smaller.
-can have just natural aquarium sound or music.  Thank goodness.  Listening to the same music over and over would have driven me crazy.  And during natural, hearing the bubbles is relaxing.
Cons:
-the fish can swim out of screen.  This is the only reason I gave it 4 stars.  Think if fish wouldn't be able to swim out of screen the aquarium would seem more real.  Soon as the swim out of screen view my brain says not real.
-think also this is a video in the ocean.  The plants are real .  Wish it would have been fake plants more realistic of a home aquarium.

But great video.  Nice and relaxing with out all the work of cleaning a tank.

You can usually buy video for around $5",1396137600,,887,4.227544910179641

3520284,3,B001CVS6BQ,Well-- Its Ok Just OK My Grandson watched this thing all the way through and kept asking where is the Clownfish (Nemo fish). Soooo I sat through the whole thing with him and guess what ? He was right .The only Clown fish that you see is on the cover. But aside from that it is Ok and somewhat sharp but seems to have a shallow depth of field. What I mean is that fish that are only a few feet behind the main action fish seem to be a little out of focus.,1390694400,,454,3.8404255319148937
3520285,4,B001CVS6BQ,"Bought this here because it was quite inexpensive (Just over $6 and shipped free with Plus) and I needed another choice from the fireplace disc I have had for years.  I probably looked over the reviews for every aquarium or sea-related mood disc on here and for the most part they were rated either very poorly or at 4 stars or so.  I'm giving this a 4-star rating because I wasn't expecting perfection for something so inexpensive and it still came pretty close.

Great looking setting and fish.  Probably from a much larger aquarium than what you're actually seeing though - you can tell this mostly from the current of the water which is pretty strong.  If it were that strong on an aquarium the size of what you see, the fish would noticeably be affected by it I'm sure.  This current, in my opinion, enhances the experience because you can see a little more movement in the scenery.  The fish are beautiful, and are not constantly on screen but they do dart around into the scenery items pretty often.  The bubbles are great, and you can turn that up or down as much as you want so it's neither too loud or too quiet.

Very enjoyable experience - and although it's meant to (in my opinion) be run in the background, we found ourselves quite often being mesmerized by the fish and watching them intently from time to time.  This is very relaxing to do!

3520297,3,B001CVS6BQ,"This blue-ray is very clear and has a great picture. It shipped very fast also.  The reason for the 3 stars is that the camera for the video is to close to the fish.

3520308,3,B001CVS6BQ,"I bought the HD Moods disc to see what the Red Camera can do.  The color is very good, but the detail and shadow noise are just OK.  Yes, they are better than DVD, but I wouldn't say that they are stunning HD.  The 24p motion signature is not right for these fish.  The detail is probably limited by DOF which is not adequate for this scene.  720p60 would have been a better choice with a different camera (Sony EX1). 1080i60 are better for fish.  HD Scapes offers 1080i60, and the motion is what we would expect.

1080p marketing will be our undoing over the next ten years.  Consumers will be demanding 1080p at 30 frames/second and expecting smooth motion.  For some reason, the BluRay spec includes 1080p50 but not 1080p60.  Surely, that will be corrected.

Despite my negative comments, I'd recommend this fish tank for a stunning party background but not for prolonged viewing.  The lack of panning and rapid scene changes provides proper ambience that does not draw excessive attention to itself.",1274400000,2,1003,4.7011494252873565
