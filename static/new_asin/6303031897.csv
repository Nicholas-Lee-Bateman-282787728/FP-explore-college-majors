534957,4,6303031897,i gave this movie four stars because it was pretty good but not excellent.  not as good as the play though ad this is migth be one of the reasons why it was not as popular with hollywood goers than theater goers.  jeremy  irons was good ad it was one of the reasons why this film was saved.,940550400,2,290,3.9655172413793105
534958,2,6303031897,"Simply put, the overall execution was wanting.
The individual elements were good: acting, production, sets, costuming, etc...but they didn't mesh well at all.
This was highly disappointing to me, as I had read the  play.
And although I realize that it was part of the point, the actor in  me really wished that a better casting choice could have been made in place  of Lone.  He's a superb actor but altogether too masculine to be convincing  in any way to the audience.  Again, I realize that it was necessary (i.e.,  only a person who thought of the East as ""effeminate"" could have  fallen for that ""pretty face""), but perhaps a little help for the  audience would have been nice.  Of course, I don't know of any actors who  would have fit the role better, but still...
Anyway, the individual  elements, plus the marvelous construction of the last scenes, save this  film from falling completely flat on its face.",924739200,,915,4.715189873417722
534959,4,6303031897,"David Cronenberg's 11th movie, M BUTTERFLY, is one of his greatest silent achievements (next to FAST COMPANY his 3rd movie). The critics hated it, hollywood hated it, but here's the bottom line: Cronenberg fans will eat up  all the elements of a perfect Cronenberg movie, non-Cronenberg fans will  love it because the story sucks you in right from the beginning. This is  the second time Jeremy Irons worked with Cronenberg (DEAD RINGERS the  other), and what a remarkable job he does. If you liked the Crying Game,  this is the mvie for you. Drama and suspense fans alike, see this movie. It  has one of the most intriguing endings of any Cronenberg film (next to THE  DEAD ZONE)",911260800,3,680,4.711864406779661
535033,5,6303031897,"I thoroughly enjoy watching this movie over and over. I remember seeing the Barbara Walters interview with the real life participants in this story and being able to see the real people(especially their ""son"" as an adult) and hearing their stories helped me become very curious as to how a story like this could unfold. I was completely blown away by John Lone in this portrayal of Song Lilling and think he did an awesome job with what he had to work with. He played the nemesis in the Alec Baldwin movie The Shadow. Watch that movie and then watch this one and tell me the man doesn't have range as an actor! I have shown this movie to several men who have NO IDEA what the movie is about and they are SHOCKED to find out Song Lilling is a man. I find it interesting that most of the reviewers here have been so negative about John's portrayal. He wasn't wearing any padding in the chest to try hard to be a woman. His character in this movie is a MAN who in real life fooled another man into thinking he was a woman because Renee' CHOSE his own reality. Maybe Song Lilling was right in the movie dialogue to her Comerade(paraphrased but never forgotten quotable line from this movie)--Do you know why most of the roles of women in Chinese opera are traditionially played by men? Because only men know how a true woman is supposed to act. --Jeremy Irons and John Lone give incredible and underrated performances in this movie. They believed in the project and it shows. The music is gorgeous, the costumes are very ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" and anyone who is a fan of The Crying Game or any play by Charles Busch should purchase this movie. The music, scenery, and locations alone rate 4 of the stars I have assigned to it.",1168819200,3,1721,4.398119122257054
535034,2,6303031897,"I fail to understand what the true story could have been that the film is supposedly based on. The plot is completely implausible. Leaving aside the basic premise of the film that Gallimard can sleep with a man without noticing this man was in fact a man and not a woman... just one example: does anybody really believe that the French police (perhaps with the exception of Luis de Funes) would transport two suspects together so that they can conveniently discuss a common strategy of hiding their former spying activiites? Preposterous if you ask me. Not to mention that there were absolutely no bumps on the road during the whole scene in the police van... (was that perhaps a hovercraft?) And there are also more improbabilities that the average European or American eyes fail to see but that left my Chinese wife totally flabbergasted... I wonder if David Cronenberg ever bothered to consult experts in the field as is the good practice with movies that involve distant regions, long-gone periods of history or special fields of human activity. Now back to the basic premise of the film, and I am not spoiling the final surprise for anyone because you figure out Butterfly is a man as soon as you have a look at the photographs on the box of the videocasette... my only explanation is that Gallimard was in fact bisexual and because of that decided to play the part of Butterfly himself in this weird relationship... be this a postscript to the dicusssion in the previous reviews as to whether John Lone was sufficiently female to be persuasive... All that having been said, the movie has its good moments and an intensive atmosphere, maybe too theatrical at times, but overall worth watching if you are a fan of things oriental or like to explore sexual ambiguities...",1114387200,3,1774,4.7817589576547235
535035,4,6303031897,"Considering that it was a Cronenberg movie, I found it surprisingly normal and accessible.  I also found it thoroughly engrossing and much more emotionally satisfying than I's expected, given some of the reviews.  Jeremy Irons gave his usual pitch-perfect performance; perhaps this film was something of a warm-up for his playing Humbert Humbert in the similarly themed Lolita.  However, I was blown away even more by John Lone.  He wasn't as convincing as a woman as he might have been, but that really wasn't the point, and when you see his transformation to his true persona at the end of the film, the sheer contrast, and the conviction to both the performances, should prove just how talented he is.
Overall, I found an unexpected treasure here; what from the box could have been a overwraught weepy sex-drama was actually intelligent, emotionally truthful, and well made.",1020816000,6,877,5.027586206896552
535036,3,6303031897,"M. Butterfly was one of David Cronenberg's more poorly received films, but I think it's actually pretty underrated.  It bears mentioning, however, that I felt the same way about his take on William S. Burroughs' Naked Lunch, which also received mixed reviews, but can't have been an easy work to adapt.  M. Butterfly is an adaptation of David Henry Hwang's Tony Award winning play and is based on a true story (Naked Lunch, despite its radical form, was also largely based on events from Burroughs' life -- both real and imagined).
I think the timing of M. Butterfly's release was partly to blame for its lukewarm reception as it touches on some of the same gender, sexual orientation and cultural issues as Farewell My Concubine, which was released around the same time. Chen Kaige's more controversial, but widely praised Chinese epic went on to win the Palme d'Or at Cannes.  M. Butterfly does pale a bit in comparison. Leslie Cheung is more dynamic than The Last Emperor's John Lone in a similar part (as a man specializing in female operatic roles) -- but it's still a worthwhile effort and a change of pace for Mr. Cronenberg from his usual high-tech sci-fi/horror scenarios. And Jeremy Irons can almost always be counted on to give a quality performance (Dungeons and Dragons aside...). Rene Gallimard may represent a less challenging role than that of Dead Ringers' twin gynecologists, but Irons makes this lovesick French diplomat sympathetic and believable even as lets his love for Lilong Song (Lone) blind him to the seemingly obvious truth of the matter -- that the woman he's fallen in love with is really not a woman at all.",981676800,9,1639,4.8464285714285715
535037,5,6303031897,"This 1993 film is based on the true story of French diplomat, Rene Gallimard, who carried on an affair for 18 years with Chinese opera singer Song Liling.  Later, he was arrested when it was discovered he was passing diplomatic secrets to the Chinese government through his lover.  However, there is a twist.  Song Liling was actually a man, not a woman, and supposedly kept this fact from Gallimard through all this time.
Jeremy Irons is cast as Rene Gallimard.  John Lone, who was actually trained in the Beijing opera and who played the title role in The Last Emperor, is cast as Song Liling.  He is not a convincing female but I feel this was the director's intent.  The story is, after all, about Gallimard's blind obsession in his desire for the perfect woman.  Both Irons' and Lone's performances are magnificent.  Both are tragic and sympathetic characters caught up in history.
The theme is  also about the role of men and women as well as Communist China and the cultural revolution.  Great cinematography and setting brings us to the heart of China which is going through its growing pains. Deception and betrayal are everywhere, not just between the two leading characters involved in the romance.
I was unprepared to like the video as much as I did. It did not do well at the box office, I knew the theme in advance and felt it would strain my belief system.  However, I was swept away in the story and the excellent performances and had no trouble overlooking its flaws.  Of course the author took dramatic license and created a ending that played like an opera, but who is to blame him;  the story itself just cried out for theatrics.
Recommended as an interesting departure from the ordinary.",979689600,14,1708,4.691275167785235
535038,5,6303031897,"A bit of a departure for horror/sci-fi director David Cronenberg, but nonetheless one of his best films. Jeremy Irons plays Rene Gallimard, an accountant for the French Embassy in Beijing, who becomes infatuated with a Chinese diva (Song Liling), played by John Lone. After a passionate and scandalous affair, Song leaves Beijing, supposedly pregnant with Gallimard's child. Years later when he is arrested for espionage, Gallimard is forced to confront the fact that not only was his lover a spy for the Chinese ministry, but a man. Some people find John Lone's inability to completely pass as a woman problematic, but as Cronenberg explains: ""I didn't want an unknown who was incredibly female and almost undetectable. I wanted a man. When Gallimard and Song are kissing I wanted it to be two men. I wanted the audience to feel that... M. Butterfly for me is about transformation.."" For me, it's a brilliant exploration of the nature of curiousity and desire that necessarily ends tragically. The devastating notion that you can give up your entire life for something that is not true, that it's possible to fall in love with an idea, an image, a masquerade. Cronenberg abounds in his insights to imperialism, gender performance and the human capcity for transformation. Still, above all is the emotional intensity of this film, his best (in that regard) to date. Beautiful cinematography and exquisite acting, earns five stars for the closing scene alone. Highly recommended.",975715200,26,1478,5.1115702479338845
535039,5,6303031897,"If you love drama, theatres, films, arts, history and all that you know  that this version is a brilliant piece of artistic work, not a historical  work. The scriptwriter is a billiant playwright, very obviously. John Lone  has a Tony, and same as Jeremy, and you have a very talented Director. What  the Director wants to show is that he is doing a very ""new angle""  that history has missed out, and you don't get that unless you watch them  very carefully of how each of the most talented individual in their own  rights is adding a very subtle ""new edge"" about the true story  that has happened in the past. I would rather think the future viewers of  our next generation will get it. Don't write it off yet. It's more than  sci-fi.",966470400,,735,4.417910447761194
535040,5,6303031897,"At first glance, M Butterfly seems predicated upon the classical narrative of white coloniazation, whereby the colonized other is constituted metonymically along the lines of categorical displacements such as  femininity-Asia-otherness-desire. Inverting the premises of this chain of  supplementation seems to be the point of the film. Its ambivalence in  relation to the colonial discourse is contingent on the promise, and the  threat, contained in the letter M: a reference implying Western reference  to gender, yet ultimately betraying any claim to the existence of  epistemological grounds to understanding gender. Inverting the positions of  the subject, and the object, of the colonial discourse, profoundly  questioning the relation between race and sex, the drama still maintains  its traditional end, but adds a non-traditional twist to it.",947203200,,851,5.853658536585366
535041,3,6303031897,"There are two major things to be said about this one.
First off:  Regarding the complaints that John Lone was ""too male"" to pass for a woman.  Well if people were actually listening to what was being  said, they would realize that the point of the film was that Western  preoccupations with stereotypes and the ""Idea"" of an Asian woman,  blind us from the reality of what is actually before us.  John's  ""maleness"" not only is not a detraction from the film, it should  have driven the point home even more strongly.
Which brings us to the  second point.  David Henry Huang had some very specific points to make with  his script and indeed the Screenplay is remarkably faithful to the stage  script.  Unfortunately I think David Cronenberg's interests in filming this  one were very different from Huang's interests in writing it.  What we are  given is two brilliant artists tackling the same material together but with  very different agendas.  These differences unfortunately do not gell and we  are left with neither agenda being adaquately served.  Sadly, a less  visionary director may have served Huang's vision better.",945216000,2,1126,4.9144385026737964

7834544,5,6303031897,"At first I didn't know quiet what to make of this movie. Jeremy Irons sure does have the talent to play ""STRANGE"" beyond words. I don't own the VHS, I have a movie on a CD, but still this is quiet an interesting movie. To love someone for 18 years and NOT know they are man, only proves, ""Love is blind"". After I watched this a couple of times, I grew to appreciate the talent that REALLY went into this movie. ONLY Jeremy Irons and John Lone could have pulled this off. If you are affended by same sex love, don't watch this!!! I cried at the end... I simply LOVE this movie. I have watched it so many times, and each time, I find something I didn't see before. GREAT directing, GREAT actors and just plain a GREAT movie. It's NOT a porn movie!! It's LOVE at it's deepest. When I first saw John Lone singing [don't know if he did his own singing] I was as amazed as Jeremy Irons. It was beautiful. I really thought she was a ""she"". To pull off, having a baby was simply super. It ends so sad, I won't say how, due to some who haven't seen this, but I REALLY did cry. I am not the ""weapy cry baby"" at movies, but this one got to me. I highly recommend this movie. 5 stars aren't enough!",1228003200,,1186,4.051063829787234

This movie takes the stereotypes that Long writes about in his short novel and basically flips them around here.  Here you have the American man, but it is he that is hopelessly inlove with the Asian ""woman"" (using that term lightly).  She is the one that is full of decite and ends up betraying him.  At the end, he has to realize that he, not only was abdoned and betrayed, but it was by a man.

7834547,3,6303031897,"The movie M.Butterfly directed by David Cronenburg is based on a true life story about the French diplomat Rene Gallimard( Jeremy Irons)who falls in love with a Chinese opera singer named Song LiLing in Beijing in the 1960's. Gallimard is very fascinated with the opera singer and they soon begin a long passionate love affair. Gallimard plays this experienced man of the world yet so clumsy and love struck, as he manage to miss a very big detail about his lover. The character in the movie,Gallimard is very apprehensive and an idealist, but the actor Jeremy Irons plays the role outstandingly good. Gallimard will soon realize Song LiLing is not as shy and innocent as she might seem. Song LiLing is blackmailed by the Chinese government to obtain political information from Gallimard, thats when he gets drawn into trouble with his lover. Only in the very end of the movie Gallimard discovers his lover's best kept secrets. Its many moments in the movie when Chinese atmosphere comes alive and the cinematography is good. This movie seems like a normal love story until it takes a drastic turn and make you start thinking of the whole movie more into detail. There is a lot to digest in this scandalous love story that turns into a horror story. The screen play in this movie is from David Henry Hwang's opera play that he deconstructed from John Luther Longs version of Madame Butterfly.

Cronenberg's movie M. Butterfly is full of unexpected twists and turns. The French-American diplomat Rene Gallimard has fallen for a Chinese Opera singer. They embark n a lusty affair that ends in an unprecedented event. Song Liling, the Opera singer, is betraying Rene in more ways then one. She is using him to gain information on American troops in Vietnam. He has no idea that she is using him and he has no idea that she is actually a HE. When Rene ends up in prison, he uses a Madame Butterfly backdrop to commit suicide. This movie was well acted and directed. There were many subtle hints to Liling's masculinity, but there was nothing too bold as to give away the climax. This movie is a surprising take on Madama Butterfly that will linger in mind as a very different and intrguing drama.",1214352000,,815,4.620689655172414
