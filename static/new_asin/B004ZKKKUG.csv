4510021,3,B004ZKKKUG,"Clash is the latest movie by Johnny Tri Nguyen, the star of Force of Five and The Rebel. Or at least it's his latest movie available in the US. Clash has a very different feel than The Rebel, the last Nguyen movie I saw. That movie was a period piece, while this one is a stylish thriller set in the present day.

The plot is pretty straightforward, but the competing interests of the characters and their resulting double crosses of each other lead to enough twists to lift the story in to the better-than-average category for a martial arts movie.

That said, the plot doesn't get in the way much of the action, and the fights are really good. I can't think of any fights that looked like they used wires, which is good given Clash's grittier feel. While there are guns and knives used, the martial arts remain the focus in all the fights. The only downside to the guns is that it's a bit laughable what bad shots the characters must be in order to miss some of their targets!

Nguyen remains a strong performer, with a good deal of screen charisma beyond his skills as a martial artist.  Some of his spinning kicks in this movie are especially impressive. Also, both he and costar Thanh Van Ngo (also from The Rebel) engage in more submission moves than I recall from recent martial arts movies. That was cool.

Downsides? There are two big ones. The romance between Nguyen and Ngo is extremely forced and, since it takes up a good deal of time in the middle third of the film, that's a problem. I didn't feel any sparks that suggested these two characters could overcome the obvious trust issues enough to fall in love. As a result, the love story is a big minus. It slows the movie down too much, despite some of the additional complications it introduces (no spoilers here).

The other downside is that Le Thanh Son's direction ends up spending a bit too much time on shots of his stars smoking, drinking, and otherwise 'looking tough' and this makes them come off a bit like dorky poseurs. The worst example of this is when Nguyen and Ngo tango in a club. The director's (or scriptwriter) is trying to be stylish, but it just seems out of place. Exactly when did a woman who spent her teens in a brothel, was a mother, and then lived as a mercenary find time to learn to tango? Plus, the obvious use of a dancing double for Nguyen who clearly couldn't 'cut a rug' if you gave him scissors makes the whole thing really silly.

While these flaws definitely slow the pace of the movie down in places, especially in the middle, Clash is a great ride. I have yet to see Nguyen give a bad performance or dish out a bad film, so here's hoping his star continues to rise.",1325289600,,2670,4.403651115618661
4510022,5,B004ZKKKUG,"I loved this movie; it was beautifully filmed, directed, and acted.

The fight scenes were VERY exciting and believable (I am shoto-kan belt).

The characters were nicely developed. The bad guy was in his own class. The female fighter looked more competent than most, and I cared about both lead characters.

This is a Viet film, and has a lot that's original about it. Nice and gritty.

Even the sex scene was good and they did not suck face or intertwine their fingers as in in USA films. I usually have to fast forward past USA sex scenes, but this Viet scene was very nice and looked sweet.

Also, they did not ""act"" drinking or eating as in USA films, which I loathe; they drank and ate for real.

I gave it five stars because this film seemed important.",1316217600,3,759,4.424460431654676
4510023,4,B004ZKKKUG,"....I usually don't watch too many movies because i get disappointed most of the time mainly due to high expectations... well anyways this one was an decent movie, honestly i didn't even finish it because it just.. didn't grab me til the end but regardless it's got a lot of good action, very well choreograph fight scenes, the story however isn't too deep, pretty straight forward, the main character girl's daughter got kidnap and she's fighting to get her back. Also the chemistry between the two main character's didn't seem too belivable but i hear they are a couple in real life though. Anyways if your watching it to because you like action movies or martial arts movies, you probably won't be disappointed.",1316217600,2,714,4.813008130081301
4510024,4,B004ZKKKUG,"Clash is a simple low budget action movie with both good weapon scenes and fighting scenes,both martial arts action and takedowns. Also known as Bay Rong

Dont know if the movie is Vietnamese or from Thailand but it is not Korean,Japanese, or from China. It is definitely entertaining and Johny Tri Nguyen and his Girlfriend whose name I cant remember is the lead once again if you have seen the Vietnamese movie the Rebel. It is some of the production company crew that brought you The Rebel and it has very little wire or barely for the action scenes. Better than some DTV releases from Van Damme,Steve Austin and Seagal definitely and probably half the budget of a DTV in America

Johny Tri Nguyen is definitely making a name for himself and with past performances in The Protector,Rebel,Force of Five.",1313020800,6,805,4.742857142857143
4510035,5,B004ZKKKUG,"Excellent movie with a very nice story development and perfect acting. I was actually renting this movie because of Johnny Nguyen whom I heard about first time today in one of the Facebook posts, but oh boy, after seeing the Clash, I wanted to see all movies with Thanh Van Ngo instead! She is amazing, how could possibly such a slim, fragile, beautiful girl kick so tough! I was really sorry about the French gang guys!

Why this movie is different from other martial arts features? For 2 reasons. First, the action choreography, is not just well done, it is impeccable and filmed with fast pace unlike martial action in other  movies, where directors prefer to slow down the moves, thinking that looks best on screen. Yes, it does, but fast fighting moves look much more awesome. Second, the martial arts here is perfectly aligned with a human drama and down to earth human relations (ex. the stunning tango scene), which makes the movie so much interesting to watch. Otherwise, believe me, you would have been bored watching just a non-stop action.",1407715200,3,1051,4.769230769230769
4510036,4,B004ZKKKUG,"These two stars work well together.  The first time I came across them was the martial arts film ""The Rebel."" This was an action pack filled film. A must see for those action junkeys,",1406937600,,183,4.382352941176471
4510037,5,B004ZKKKUG,"I happened to see the title ""CLASH"" with some Vietnamese stars names and read the storyline on the Direct TV Showtime -Normally,I didn't like to watch Vietnamese movies because they kept making some very dull movies about the war or poor taste and boring stuff- Anyway, I recorded movie ""Clash"" and watched it the next day...To my surprice,it turned out to be a very interesting movie,indeed. With the handsome leading man like Johnny Tri Nguyen along with his beautiful leading lady Ngo thanh Van and their awesome material arts kickings would make the movie  worth watching. I love the fact that now they're litterally trying to make a decent movie for ""now-a-day"" viewers. Some of the scenes like Tango dance by Johnny and Van was actually pretty good- not as good as Brad Pitts and Angelina Jolies,of course- but still looked elegant in suit and dress- Overall,I think, Clash is a very entertaining movie and I would highly recommend this movie to everyone...",1378080000,4,963,4.9079754601226995
4510038,3,B004ZKKKUG,"A Vietnamese movie ""Clash"" (""Bay Rong"") is a typical B action flick based on a familiar format: action set-pieces strung together by dramatic parts with a lot of talking. And the talking is not very interesting.

The story is simple. Tranh Van Ngo is Trinh, a leader of professional criminals hired to steal a certain device. She is also a mother of a daughter kidnapped by a crime lord who virtually owns her. This is her final job. Complete it and she will be free with her daughter. Things get complicated when she gets romantically involved with Quan (Johnny Nguyen), who has a secret to hide.

Some viewers know the stars - Johnny Nguyen and Tranh Van Ngo, both previously seen in ""The Rebel."" First-time director Le Thanh Son executes the film's action set-pieces pretty effectively, and the two leads show what they can do in the film's action sequences that are decent if not groundbreaking.

But the film's weak, meandering story gets in the way of these action scenes that are fine but few and far between. Also, sometimes during the action parts, we are not sure who are fighting whom, and for what, and this kind of botched storytelling only makes it hard for us to enjoy the action, no matter how great it is. This is not a complete mess, though I think you will find yourself pressing the fast-forward button pretty often, just like I did.",1372291200,,1353,4.629166666666666
4510039,5,B004ZKKKUG,"This movie is a great watch. I would recommend this movie for anyone, even if you do not like martial arts movies.",1365379200,2,114,4.2272727272727275
4510040,4,B004ZKKKUG,"There are no shortage of Asian crime thrillers out there and, for my dollar, they tend to be more inventive than their American counterparts. This Vietnamese entry into the genre might not be the best but it's a good time and still has enough twists and turns to keep one interested.

Here's the scoop. Phoenix (played by the stunning Thanh Van Ngo) had a twin sister who was murdered by a big time thug. Said thug now has Phoenix's daughter and uses her as leverage to have Phoenix pull off a series of jobs. The final job involves stealing a laptop, from some French dudes, that contains high level satellite info. A guy on her crew, unbeknownst to her, is an undercover cop. Said heist goes south and the doo-doo hits the fan.

This is not a great flick by any means but it moves very steadily and has some good gun play and martial arts fight scenes. Phoenix is one good looking woman and she can fight. During the fight scenes she looks like she knows the time of day. They spend as much camera on her as they do the dudes. Some of the plot points in the earlier part of the flick don't rise above the fray but a few things happen in the third act that spice things up. Much of what is happening in this flick are the two leads. I couldn't take my eyes off Phoenix, but the undercover cop, Quan, is handsome in his own right, and the developing relationship between the two helps keep the viewer involved. A Tango scene, with him in a suit and her in a gorgeous red dress, is worth the price of admission. One of the other guys in her crew is a short, stocky guy put in for comic relief. It sad he gets knocked off when he does. I think that character could have used a lot more screen time.

All that being said, this is a decent watch. Not the best of its ilk but well worth the time to view it.",1358467200,,1802,4.172413793103448
4510041,5,B004ZKKKUG,"A lot of action in this one, the story line is great also. I recommend you see this one. 5 stars, thanks again.",1357603200,2,111,3.869565217391304
4510042,4,B004ZKKKUG,"The story is about about a woman(Trinh) who hires several mercenaries to help complete a series of tasks to save her kidnapped daughter.  This movie is in subtitles and runs an hour forty minutes.  This movie was very fun, and enjoyable to watch.  The movie uses a story line that has been used to death in other movies. This story line being that the main character(This time the character being Trinh) falls for another character and realizes something about him that makes her feelings for him complicated and forces her to take drastic action.  But in saying that, the movie was still really good.  The fight scenes are very well done, the acting is top notch and the pace of the movie is smooth with very, very few bumps.  The movie was fun, and definitely worth a shot.",1350864000,,775,4.579710144927536
4510043,4,B004ZKKKUG,"CLASH (""Bay Rong"") doesn't try to revolutionize martial arts cinema. Restricted to chump change for its budget, it's got no business aspiring to the lush visual aesthetics of HERO or CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON. What it strives to do is to bring the martial arts flick back to the street level, back to its roots. CLASH doesn't engage in camouflaging quick cuts or deceitful CGI, and if there's any wire work done, it is sparse, brother. What we're left with is a lean and gritty, buttkicking Vietnamese action flick. I rate it a better than average 3.5 out of 5 stars.

What drew me to CLASH more than anything is that it reunites&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Rebel/dp/B0018PH3NS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Rebel</a>&nbsp;alums, Johnny Tri Nguyen and Veronica Ngo. They prove that their chemistry in THE REBEL wasn't a fluke. Veronica Ngo (a.k.a. Ngo Thanh Van) plays Trinh, the indentured enforcer of a mob boss nicknamed the Black Dragon. The Black Dragon had abducted Trinh's young daughter and now forces Trinh to carry out the acquisition of a highly coveted laptop which can unlock deep government secrets. Trinh outsources a crew of specialists, numbering among them the mysterious, unflappable Quan (Johnny Tri Nguyen).

CLASH isn't as ambitious as THE REBEL. It's set on a smaller scale. And in its dramatic nuances and plot twists, it won't bowl over any viewer. Of course, not all of Trinh's teammates are on the up and up. Not everyone shares Trinh's motivations. No doubt, there's a bad apple in the bunch just raring to pull a heel turn. This is B-movie filmmaking 101. What distinguishes the movie are the lead actors. And the fight scenes. Johnny Tri Nguyen - who produced and co-wrote the story - deserves credit for attempting to instill heart in the screenplay, except that it's just the same old melodrama (although I did like the climactic five-way stand-off), and the pace is sometimes just off. Still, Nguyen and Veronica Ngo's performances liven things up. There's just enough complexity and emotional depth there that they salvage the storyline. Again, these two are good together. In some tangible way, CLASH acts as a love story between a tragic heroine and a burnt out but still smooth operator.

It's in the action bits that Ngo and Nguyen truly register a vivid presence. The fight choreography is tremendous. I relished the joint fight scenes as the camera frenziedly tracks Ngo and Tri Nguyen as, in several set pieces, they work in concert to dish out punishment on one squad of goons after another. There's a frenziedness to the camera movement, but a clarity as well. The action is easy to follow.

Just how intense is Veronica Ngo? When a thug smashes a beer bottle on the back of her skull, she merely gets irritated. Now, Ngo isn't about to rip the mantle of Most Badarse Female Martial Artist from Jeeja Yanin, but she demonstrates good moves. Johnny Tri Nguyen - who once did stunt work for the SPIDER-MAN film franchise and is a martial arts expert - may not be as explosive as, say, Tony Jaa, but, long-limbed and elegant, he exhibits a smooth flow. His kicks are fluid and whip fast and account for quite a number of his finishing moves. There's one electrifying bit where he leaps in the air and kicks three baddies. He also shows some decent ground work, executing some very nice grappling moves and joint-lock techniques. Naturally, CLASH, being a Vietnamese venture, features the traditional Vovinam discipline. But we also see bits of boxing, Muay Thai, aikido, and jujitsu, all these making for a satisfying eclectic mix. Heck, there's even a bout of tango, an endeavor which - according to Tri Nguyen in the DVD interview - is harder than martial arts.

The DVD's bonus stuff:

- A Conversation (in English) with Johnny Tri Nguyen and Veronica Ngo (00:10:34 minutes)
- Anatomy of a Fight Scene - cast interviews and behind-the-scenes training clips, including the occasional inadvertent bruise and bloodied nose and a side-by-side comparison of a fight rehearsal with the actual film footage (00:05:52 minutes, with English sub-titles)
- Cast of Characters - the actors talk about their roles (00:04:45 minutes, with English sub-titles)
- Music Video: ""Tiec"" by Little Wings (00:05:13 minutes)

4510044,2,B004ZKKKUG,"The first 2/3's of this film was almost exactly the same as John Frankenheimer's 1998 film ""Ronin"", starring Robert De Niro, except for Clash's lack of extremely exciting car chases and Ronin's lack of kung fu action.

You have a female lead (in Ronin it was the sexy Natascha McElhone; in Clash, Ngo Thanh Van) organizing an all male crew (in Ronin headed by De Niro; in Clash, headed by Johnny Tri Nguyen) to steal a package from a bunch of bad guys (in Clash, a group of French men; in Ronin, a bunch of Russians), in order to give it to a bunch of bad guys (in Clash, another Vietnamese guy who is holding Ngo Thanh Van's daughter captive as a bargaining chip; in Ronin, to the Irish Republican Army).

In each film, the first assignment is to approach an unknown group of gun runners to purchase weapons to use against those holding the package. Both fail, although with different results.

Next, both male leads choose to check out the speed and decisiveness of the opposing team's security force. With both the French and the Russians staying at hotels, De Niro and McElhone in Ronin and Nguyen and Thanh Van in Clash each pair up as romantic couples to approach the teams to cause a diversion to see how good they are. Pictures are taken of the melee, examined, and a decision is made how to approach.

When they finally get the package, in each film one of the guys of the group turns traitor and steals the package, running off with it to make his own deal with another rival gang, in Ronin, to sell it back to the Russians, in Clash, to sell it to the Triads.

It is only at this point where the movies finally start to take divergent paths and Clash finally breaks out on its own to end the final third of the film by creating a whole new ending, which is kind of exciting.

As for the martial arts aspect of the film, I was kind of disappointed. I mean, on the whole, it looked OK, but many times it was just too silly, I guess is the word I'm looking for. They would hit each other and not react to the hit. Although sometimes they would get kicked in the chest and fly back 4 or 5 feet, other times a person would get socked in the face and not flinch and then punch the other person right back. One time Ngo Thanh Van got hit over the head with a full bottle of wine and didn't react at all, but just kept fighting. If this was a parody or something like a Jackie Chan movie, I wouldn't even bring this up. But this was a very serious film, and it just seemed like sloppily choreographed duels. Many times a bad guy would be in the process of attacking a good guy and get side-swiped by another guy, and all I kept thinking was, ""Geez, guys, don't you have any peripheral vision?""

I know I am an odd duck here, at least so far as my reviews re: the action sequences are concerned. All I can suggest is, for those who really want to own this film, I would tell them to rent it first from Netflix or Blockbuster or wherever, before buying it outright. Then if you agree with others, at least you know ahead of time how great the film is. If you feel like me, however, you haven't lost that much time or money.",1330732800,,3124,4.231543624161074
