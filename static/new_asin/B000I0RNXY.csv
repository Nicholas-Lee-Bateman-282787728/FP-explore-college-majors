2650701,5,B000I0RNXY,"I had no expectations one way or the other walking into the theater to see D.O.A.  When my friends and I came out, we talked and laughed about it for an hour.  This movie knows its limitations and never takes itself too seriously, but has the interesting flavor of pretending its a serious movie all the way through.  (It turns out there's a big, visible difference between thinking you're a serious low budget movie and playing pretend.)  Ridiculous things will happen with actors and actresses approaching their jobs in character and straight-faced, allow the viewer to indulge in a very pleasant vacation from reality.

While it couldn't successfully translate the actual plot line of the video games to the big screen, D.O.A. is shockingly full of nods to the series.  You can tell that the team actually played and paid attention to the source material.  While Kasumi and Hayabusa have switched roles (Kasumi the serious ninja and Hayabusa a little wide eyed), this was necessary, after all, to keep the Super Ninja from dominating the movie.  All the other characters strongly reference their original characters, with wonderful little surprises throughout for those of us who have played the video game series casually or competitively.  The plot itself is a hybrid of the plot lines of the various games.

Did I mention the martial arts sequences are brilliantly shot and incredibly well choreographed?  They are excellent.  Little more needs to be said.  Fans of martial arts flicks will not be disappointed.

This little gem does everything it can with what it has to work with, showcasing some fantastic action in a smart framework.  D.O.A. is downright fun.",1189468800,2,1669,4.996376811594203
2650702,2,B000I0RNXY,"Theaters should be required to give a free bag of popcorn with each ticket purchase of DOA: Dead Or Alive, because you'll need it. And they should serve it plain because the movie provides plenty of cheese. Though to be honest I found myself laughing along with the lighthearted martial arts flick more often at intentionally funny scenes than unintentional ones. With a generous helping of well-choreographed fights, a healthy dose of humor, and non-stop gratuitous nudity (well, almost), DOA will provide ninety minutes of video game movie fun, though the amount of fun largely depends on one's mindset and willingness to forgive.

No one is watching this movie for the story, which is good, because there really isn't one. Basically, nefarious businessman Donovan (Eric Roberts) gathers several of the best fighters from around the world to battle it out on an island for a ten million dollar prize. The rules are simple: random one-on-one matches, no weapons allowed, and you must fight your scantily clad opponent until she uh...goes down. Where was I? Anyway, everyone has a hidden agenda for entering the competition and the four main heroines (Devon Aoki, Jaime Pressly, Holly Valance, and Sarah Carter) must learn to work together to uncover Donovan's evil scheme and save the day. Or something like that.

If one were to walk into this movie at any given point, they might think they were watching a series of Victoria's Secret commercials. Luckily, bad acting and a plethora of fight scenes would soon correct their assumption. Though to criticize the four main girls' acting abilities would be akin to trashing a stripper's outfit. After a few minutes it doesn't really matter. The girls chosen to portray each classic fighter in the DOA universe neither look like nor act like their video game counterparts, but their costumes and attractiveness help to disguise that minor detail. And while their dialogue may not be easy on the ears, at least the eyes won't have a hard time. Jaime Pressley's performance as Tina Armstrong stands out the most, though it's hard to determine whether she should thank her acting coach, her personal trainer, or the screenwriter for giving her the sassiest lines. It's a toss up for most attractive, and though I'd side with Holly Valance as Christie, having her character shack up with the weasliest guy on the island certainly detracts from her appeal (but then again she does get the slow motion fight in the rain against Sarah Carter).

If the girls don't do it for you, then you're probably watching the wrong movie. The only other feature DOA has to offer are some unexpectedly entertaining martial arts fight sequences that utilize inventive locales, sharp editing, and creative choreography. It's obviously not as good as the real thing (a la early Chan or Li), especially when gravity-defying wuxia is thrown in, but it's still interesting to watch and looks far more stylish than one might imagine.

As with most video game movies, the similarities to its origins don't stop with just the characters. The use of the in-game announcer enthusiastically yelling ""Fight!"" and ""KO!"" ups the cheese factor, but doesn't quite reach the level of absurdity seen in films like House of the Dead, where actual video game footage was spliced into the action. Overused gold DOA logos tire quickly, but fantastic set designs that pay homage to many of the arenas found in the game actually liven up the proceedings. There's even a nod to DOA's spin-off volleyball game when the four main girls compete in a vigorous match, proving director Yuen has a better sense of humor than I gave him credit for.

Chances are that if you want to see this film, you already know what you're getting yourself into. While there's plenty of questionable choices, from Zack's green hair to the ridiculous puzzle vault code, DOA presumes not to take itself too seriously, allowing the audience to more easily enjoy the beautiful girls, the martial arts, and the beautiful girls. Though heavy techno rock music will unabashedly cue you in on when the ""cool"" scenes are occurring, you'll likely know when you find yourself reaching for the video game controller that isn't there.

2650703,4,B000I0RNXY,"Suprisingly a Really Great movie! (as far as ""movies based on video games"" go!.....no, really,  it's pretty GOOD!)....

 Production Values, Stunts, Set Design,....very, very GOOD!!...  ALL Actors seen commited to their roles and do a FINE JOB!!....(was IMPRESSED by JAMIE PRESSLY...one can tell she Worked Out for the role of Tina!)...but in spite of that...the Only REAL Criticism I have with this ""movie""...(again, a movie based on a video game)...is this,.....CASTING and COSTUME DESIGN!!!!
  In my opinion, DOA is ALL ABOUT  strong, attractive, WOMEN!...if they had stayed True to the women and girls of the game, This could have been THE BEST MOVIE...(Based on a VIDEO GAME!!)....

p.s.  one last note on how Good this movie was.....I didn't notice Eric Roberts till the last 20 minutes or so...he didn't ruin it and was....O.K. in his role!!",1188864000,5,847,5.169117647058823
2650704,4,B000I0RNXY,"""D.O.A.: Dead or Alive"" as everyone knows is based on the Video game franchise of the same name. This film was released in mid-2006 in Asia before in the U.S. possibly because of the larger market for video game inspired movies. For this reason, I managed to own the region-3 Asian release (image by S. L. Bledsoe in Amazon) even before the movie hit U.S. theaters. Directed by Corey Yuen (Transporter, So Close) an acclaimed Martial arts choreographer, (although Corey's not as renowned as the legendary Yuen Woo-Ping) D.O.A. looks promising. After all, Jet Li quoted Corey Yuen In Black Belt magazine as ""..if I need something fresh, I go to Corey Yuen.""

A tournament called D.O.A. is being held in a remote Island by a man named Donovan (Eric Roberts). Three beautiful but lethal women are invited to compete. Tina (Jaime Pressley), Kasumi (Devon Aoki), and Christie (Holly Valance). Each of the three female leads have their own motivation and has their own baggage to carry. Once there, they must battle their way up the fighter rankings through a bunch of other seasoned fighters to reach the finals. Once in the final phase, the women uncover a hidden ""sinister"" secret that is the true reason for the competition. Aided by Helena (hottie Sarah Carter) and Hayabusa (Kane Kosuji), they must either join forces or perish...

Since the movie is based on the video game, expect something with a simple plot with scantily-clad women engaging in fisticuffs and, ahem, volleyball (which is a nice touch, there is a game called ""D.O.A. Beach Volleyball""). What can we expect? The game itself is renowned for its hard-hitting fights and titillation factor (""bouncing b--bs"" and skimpy outfits) so the film just exploits those factors.

It is fairly obvious that Corey Yuen has a limited budget to work with. Still, he manages to pull off an accelerated fast-paced action film that is both hard-hitting and visually stylish. While the plot is lacking and with almost no decent character development, Corey goes for the throat with a lot of mano-o-mano fights and as much ""PG-13"" brutality(no blood) he can spare to compensate for the lackluster plot. The extensive fight choreography is the true ""lure"" of the film. The film is based on a video game so reality is out the door.

D.O.A. remains true to its roots (gimmicks), as there is enough tease (but not explicit) to make a male(like me) excited, shots of a few tanned skin and sexy curves to satisfy the raw sex appeal of the games. While it does have its goofy moments, (the nerdy guy is so annoying), there is enough action to divert our attention that it does avoid the screenplay from becoming ""cheesy"" nor ""campy"". Eric Roberts is definitely miscast as the bad guy, he didn't have the ""raw appeal"" for a baddie. Wrestler Kevin Nash even makes an appearance as Tina's wrestler Dad. The film is short, and the ending gives you a little tease of the possibility of a sequel.

Since I am 90% certain that the U.S. release will have the same transfer, I will give you my take on the dvd quality...
VIDEO/AUDIO: Anamorphic widescreen. The PQ is excellent. Colors are vibrant, clean and extremely sharp. Black levels are solid and strong when needed. 5.1 Dolby digital/DTS-ES English track. The DTS track is the way to go if your equipped since it is very powerful and crisp. The 5.1 Dolby isn't too shabby either.
OVERALL:
Corey Yuen made every effort to bring the video game to life. ""D.O.A."" is a hyper-accelerated-kinetic stylish action film that gets the fight sequences (for a Hollywood film) just right and that's the best anyone can hope for given its source material. Its' a video game with hot chicks, what can we expect?
RECOMMENDED! For fans of the game and the action genre, a good rental for everybody else. (3  stars)",1188259200,32,3784,4.79601226993865
2650705,5,B000I0RNXY,"I've read a lot of reviews both good and bad about this movie, but none ever seem to give it the credit it deserves. Yes, it has a single-laced plotline, but being based off a video game of the same nature, that's to be expected. But the fighting sequences were excellent, the one-liner's and side-arm comments were hilarious, and even if you didn't enjoy anything else of the movie, the five main girls who are out-of-this-world gorgeous should have been enough for most [male] viewers to sit back and enjoy. I give this movie five stars because I took it for what it was and knew somewhat of what I was getting into after watching other video game-based movies like ""Super Mario Bros."", both ""Resident Evil""s, ""BloodRayne"", and both ""Laura Croft: Tomb Raider""s movies. I actually got more than I expected, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.",1186185600,18,836,4.732876712328767
2650706,5,B000I0RNXY,"That's what everyone that has seen the movie is saying.  And they are right.  Those same words came out of my mouth.  I'm a fan of Sarah Carter plus I'm familiar with the Dead or Alive games so I was interested in seeing the movie.  And I thought it was great.  The fight scenes were so good I could feel the punches.  I haven't felt like that during fight scenes since The Batman and Superman Anmated Series.  If the movie was 3D I think I would've came out with a black eye.  The hits were unbelievable.  The story was good, it did not drift apart and bore the hell out of you.  I was looking out for the story and I can't complain.  I look forward to seeing this on dvd.",1184198400,2,673,4.061068702290076
2650707,5,B000I0RNXY,"Several contestants have been chosen to fight in the D.O.A. tournament, hosted by megalomanical billionaire doctor Victor Donovan (Eric Roberts). Four of them include ninja princess Kasumi (Devon Aoki), pro wrestler Tina Armstrong (Jamie Pressly), master thief Christie Allen (Holly Valance), and hostess Helena Douglas (Sarah Carter). As they make their way through the rankings, and enjoy some fun in the sun, there's a hidden agenda behind this ""tournament"" - Donovan plans to harvest the nanobots from the four best DOA fighters, creating a technology where the host will be able to predict and adapt to any fighting style and defeat any combatant. With the help of Donovan lackey Weatherby (Steve Howey), the girls must band together and stop those who want to harvest their might for evil.

Maybe I'm a brown-noster, but damned if I didn't enjoy director Corey Yuen's (""The Transporter 2"") B-movie aspirations for the big-screen adaptation of a B-level video game. I haven't played ""DOA: Dead or Alive"", but all I heard is that it became really popular for its titillation factor - hot women wearing small bikinis. It may not be a good factor to feature in a movie, but then again, no director has ever been in Yuen's shoes. ""DOA wears its B-movie heart on its shoulders, and delivers such giddy fun - even for a PG-13 movie - that one's inner pre-teen will want to jump out.

One thing to consider before entering: ""DOA"" is an immensely cheesy film (a rule in B-movie tradition). Featuring superhuman stunts (often in obscene CGI), cornball lines, quick cuts, minimal character development, and a speedy pace to fill up 80-some minutes, I doubt there will be many people who will be taken into it. But ""DOA"" never gets bogged down in excessive subplots, pace-laden drama, or anything else that would ruin a possible guilty pleasure (""Ghost Rider""). Yuen's into making an action-packed, well-choreographed, and goofy film to charm those who love martial arts movies of this nature. And boy, does he!

The action sequences are worthy of mention. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, numerous fights are often filmed in CGI format and feature over-the-top stunts (including flying samurai princesses in a vine-covered forest, a high-flying finale against Donovon inside a shrine). It never hurts, however, that the choreography (as said already) is handled well enough, and the stuntwork is so well (especially from Jaime Pressly), that it enhances the fun factor by a whopper.

The cast even looks to be having fun. This goes for Jaime Pressly, who definitely provides the bulk of energy that her Southern gal character can pack, whether it's fighting off homeboy Zack or spitting catch-phrases for good comic relief. Devon Aoki embraces the B-movie conventions with monotone acting, and while she may not have much charisma as her co-stars, her fight scenes are easily the best out of the bunch. Holly Valance, while sadly saddled with a worthless romantic subplot with Matthew Marsen (he seems rather bored), offers plenty tittilation and charm to boot. These actresses are further complimented with agreeable side work from Sarah Carter, Steve Howey, Eric Roberts (an ideal choice for a cheesy film like this), Kevin Nash (a hoot as Tina's father), and Brian J. White.

I hardly encountered such a fun time at the movies (and I seen ""Grindhouse"" and ""Hot Fuzz""). With Yuen bringing the charms of the video game and embracing them in a B-movie delight like this, DOA is definitely worth a matinee ticket if not less. And for a videogame-based movie, it may pave the way for other directors to inject that same sense of fun to their upcoming projects. It won't set the world on fire, but for those who have been disappointed by action extravaganzas bogged down by excess baggage, this is for them.",1181865600,5,3806,4.996845425867508
2650708,3,B000I0RNXY,"Yes, ""DOA: Dead or Alive"" is a martial arts action film based on video game (by Tecmo) and the film does not try to conceal its origin. As the film starts, we are immediately introduced to Princess Kasumi (Devon Aoki), leader of a ninja clan in Hokkaido, Japan, who flies (literally) to a small isolated island in the East China Sea. There, a martial arts competition is held by a mastermind named Donovan, and the winner gets $ 10 million.

Then you meet the contestants invited to the fight. They include Tina (Jamie Pressly) a pro-wrestler, Christie (Holly Valance) a sexy thief/assassin, Helena (Sarah Carter) daughter of the dead doctor who initiated the institute, and Hayabusa (Kane Kusugi), bodyguard of Princess Kasumi. And Princess herself has her own purpose to be in the island, looking for her missing brother Hayate (Corin Chau, Seraph of two ""Matrix"" sequels"").

The script for the film is written by J. F. Lawton and Adam Gross & Seth Gross. J. F Lawton once directed a cult ninja flick set in Japan named ""The Hunted"" (1995), and his recent works as writer include that of TV series ""V.I.P."" The story of ""DOA"" is a concoction of ""Enter the Dragon"" and any action films based on video games, but I believe you already know that much.

[DECENT ACTIONS] Despite its weak story, the actions of ""DOA"" are decent. Sure, ""DOA"" is no Jackie Chan or Bruce Lee film, but it delivers, and is at least as good as `Charlie's Angels"" (I'm talking about the first one, and I thought that was not bad.) Much of the credit goes to the director and some (if not all) of the actors. ""DOA"" is directed by Corey Yuen whose previous jobs include that of a director/martial arts action choreographer for the first ""Transporter"" and some Hong Kong-made action films like `So Close."" He surely knows how to show good stunts with styles though fans will know that this is not his best.

Among the participants of the competition, Jamie Pressly and Holly Valance are most impressive. I heard they both had practiced martial arts before, and it is obvious they have really been training for long. Corin Chau does his actions expertly again (against Eric Roberts wearing sunglass-like gadget, yes, that's Julia's brother!), but the real find is Kane Kosugi (son of Sho Kosugi, who became famous for starring Grade B ninja flicks in the 1980s). Kane's speedy and nimble movements in one non-stop action sequence are thrilling to see. I'm not saying he is as great as Jet Li or Tony Jaa, but he is surely a talented guy.

""DOA"" is full of actions. Moreover, many ladies show up in bikini without any particular reasons, but please don't take them seriously. Never mind if a ninja (who is definitely Japanese) speaks perfect English. Please forget about the cheesy CGI. You know ""DOA: Dead or Alive"" is silly and corny, made solely for entertainment, and the film also knows it. It is nothing innovating or revolutionary, but is still fun,",1171152000,3,2925,4.727450980392157
2650709,3,B000I0RNXY,"I rented this DVD because a reviewer said that it was ""what Charlie's Angels should have been but wasn't"".  I haven't played the computer game this story was supposedly modelled on so the characters were new to me.  I can understand why the reviewer thought the way he did as it has a similar idea.  Three females with different agendas face huge odds, multiple fight scenes, humerous situations, and still win out at the end.  A bit long-winded in some of the fighting but still a better story than Charlie's Angels.",1167609600,5,517,4.648351648351649

2650713,5,B000I0RNXY,"the movie starts in japan, but it goes other places because , there is a lot of invites that needs to happen
so to get all the fighters in the same place without knowing what for, just how much
apparently, this happens a lot, because they all are aware of this, so what makes this special?
everyone seems to have a specific  way of fighting , like say kungfu, if your invited, your special fighter for a reason,
and the winner collects  wins $10 million!
so everyone ends up in the place  needed and the fights are to begin anytime and at any place
, but the kicker is, no weapons, just there body;s and what they know , they can do  with it.
one of the fighters is a prince in japan and her brother  got killed at the same fight years before
so she decides to give up being a princess and find her brother and get revenge on who ever killed him
everyone , including his girlfriend says he is dead, but  the princess says there is no proof without the body
so she leaves to find him and goes to the doa,-dead or alive fight, she has what it takes to win as you will see
you will see there is more to this fight than thought before hand
and what happens will surprise you  and there is some dating, flirting and lies that take place
lots of action and a new way of fighting starts
 if you ever watched the hunger games , this will give you an idea kind of
enjoy the movie, its well worth watching over and over",1506729600,,1409,4.079710144927536

If you overcome the fan service element, it is an entertaining light movie, like Charlie's Angels but with some cool martial arts.  I loved the direction of photography (very artistic) and the editing (good pace).

I will not say this will be a classic or that it deserves to be in the video library of everyone, so it has 4 stars and not 5.

2650741,1,B000I0RNXY,"Let me start off by saying that this movie is based off the infamous series ""Dead or Alive"" developed by Team Ninja and Tecmo (Koei), and the series is still really great to this very day. The game series in which this movie comes from and is apart of is in no way one of the reasons why I'm giving this a one star rating.

I haven't watched this movie in years, but going off from what I can remember, this movie was not good at all. Like, the cons out weigh the pros which really isn't surprising coming from a movie based off the video game. In the case of DOA: Dead or Alive this factor is especially apparent. There are many reasons why for the most part, this movie didn't do well enough to beckon a sequel much less any further consideration of it. Understandably so. This movie could have stood on it's own as being completely separate from the game series. The only things that the movie and game have in common are the title and it's characters along with very few story elements. it was very clear that the three writers along with the director didn't play the games prior to production for this movie.

Just a bit of a disclaimer though, I know that even if they did look into the source material enough to get an idea of what the series was all about, the movie could have still ended up being just as horrendous as it is presently. What I said is just a observation.

The overall portrayal of the characters in this movie made them seem like completely different people in comparison to their video game counterparts, and the acting was stiff when it came to most of the actors and actresses involved in the movie. But, given I haven't seen any of these actors and actresses in other movies, I can't exactly blame this on their acting talents specifically. So, I would say that the director is at fault for the for-mentioned criticism. The plot was also weak, and kind of went all over the place. Generally, the games plot weren't really well put together either, but unlike DOA: Dead or Alive, at least now it's 10x easier to connect the plot dots that took place in the game in comparison to the  plot for this movie. Only certain scenes and parts of the movie made actual sense really.

Some good things I have to say though for this movie are few, though. One positive aspect of this movie was the way the camera panned in on action sequences, and how well it synced with them. The action scenes were also kind of epic and entertaining to watch which since that was the case, I have to admit that those were done very well. Would I recommend this? Not really. I mean, if you're curious about this movie and want to find out the plot in full detail, I'd say go for it. But if you're going in expecting this to be a adequate based-off-a-videogame movie, you'll be disappointed. I especially wouldn't recommend it to those who are interested in the DOA series as it'd be preferable if this wasn't their introduction into it.",1468627200,,2939,4.405156537753223

If you walk into this movie with ANY expectations beyond seeing beautiful people, cool choreographed karate fights and an interesting slimy bad guy, you're in the wrong theater.  Take it for exactly what it is and you can't help but enjoy it.  I've seen it at least 5 times so far and never get bored watching.  It's a great brainless flick that requires minimal mental interaction and let's face facts - we all need one of those occasionally.  There are only so many Wim Wenders movies you can watch before you want to gouge out your eyes.  Pay particular attention to Christie's scene (Short, blonde hair - 3rd character intro in movie).  Her moves are physically impossible to time and to pull off, BUT they are also the single coolest ""kick the bad guy's ass and grab the gun"" maneuver I think I've ever seen.  James Bond wishes he could be this cool.  In closing, all I can say is that for 8.99, there is NO way you can lose by ordering this movie.  Do it.  Trust me.

2650777,5,B000I0RNXY,"From the director of The Transporter, comes ""The best movie adaptation of a video game so far"" as said by Matthew Turner from View London. Sci-Fi Movie Page says ""It's one martial arts action sequence after the other"". Filled with non-stop action, martial arts, and SEXY women, this is a movie about a group of highly skilled fighters of a wide variety of fighting styles coming to an island for a chance to become the world champion. The leader of the group is played by Jaime Pressly(My Name is Earl) who plays a female pro wrestler similar to Trish Stratus(former WWE Women's Champion). Her dad is played by Kevin ""Diesel"" Nash who looks and dresses like Hulk Hogan in this movie. Her second in command is played by Devon Aoki(Sin City) who plays a female Ninja. However, their host has sinister plans for all of them as they soon find out. Other well known castmembers include Holly Valance, Sarah Carter, Eric Roberts, Natassia Malthe(Skinwalkers, Bloodrayne 2), Matthew Marsden, Steve Howey, Brian White, and Kane Kosugi(the family name is synonymous with Ninjitsu). This is a VERY exciting movie full of action! This film is VERYsimilar to the Mortal Kombat movie series in every way except for one: this film is CLEARLY a guilty pleasure in the ""hottie"" department. Jaime Pressly is smokin' HOT, as always in this film! Combine Charlie's Angels with Mortal Kombat and you have this movie understood. Enjoy the show!",1427068800,6,1423,4.884297520661157

If you're not familiar with the series, but do enjoy a light-hearted action film with a sprinkle of comedic moments while not sacrificing the seriousness of the plot itself, this should also please you, as well!

2650834,5,B000I0RNXY,"DOA has been a popular hardcore hitting video game franchise for a long time now. This film brings the DOA universe what they want. If you loved the game, you are gonna have an even harder time keeping it in your pants!

Story: As the game goes, the best fighter from around the world are chosen to compete in the DOA Dead or alive tournament, and win a cash prize. Jaime Pressley (Tina Armstrong) is a retired wrestler according to the film, and would rather do MMA. She gets an invitation to the DOA tournament, as well as her father Bass Armstrong played by Kevin Nash, who is a wrestler, perfect casting right there if you ask me. Kasumi is out to look for her brother Hayate, who is believed to be dead. Eric Roberts who is the host of this tournament plays Donovan (Not a character from the game).

Characters: I could go on and on about how many characters are in this film. Tina, Bass, Christie, Bayman, Hayate, Zack, Kasumi, Gen fu, Hitomi, Brad wong, Lei fang, Ryu, Ayane, and Helena. That's nearly every character. The actors portayed each other well.

Costumes: The costumes were absolutely great! Especially Ayane's. Bass's outfit was well crafted.

Sexuality: Wow, just wow. Talk about sexy, and no you don't get to see Tina's boobs, sorry guys. Get ready for some beach volleyball!

Acting: The acting was absolutely terrific! Not just the acting itself, but how they portrayed the characters themselves.

Verdict: This is a video game adaptation that you don't want to miss out on. Fans of the game will love this movie. So pick it up when you get a chance.",1356998400,,1573,4.6

The major difference is the increased production, FX, martial arts choreography, and campiness.  It truly is amazing for a movie to be some awesome yet contain so much cheese (the sound effects are atrocious).  The combined ""talents"" of Jaime Pressly, Devon Aoki, Holly Valance, Sarah Carter, and Natassia Malthe blend seamlessly - and sometimes bralessly - with the nonstop action expected from a video-game adaptation.  The fact that Eric Roberts - a man who oozes cheese out of every pore - is the main antagonist only amplifies the direction and feel of the film.

With no blood, no real nudity, and everything mentioned above, this is not much more than a guilty pleasure.  And that's why I loved it!",1350518400,,875,4.878378378378378

2650840,2,B000I0RNXY,"I have seen a lot of good reviews for this movie and checked it out for myself. To be honest I didn't like DOA. It follows the same stigma most video game movie adaptations suffer from and that is it's just not a good movie. While there are some good elements when it all comes down to it DOA is a mindless venture into fan service, and not in a good way. To start off with I didn't go into this film thinking is was going to be serious cinema. The film obviously doesn't take itself seriously either. I get that. However even if a film is intentionally outrageous that means it will have to work a little harder in other aspects in order to make it a good film. DOA lacks much of this.

Lets start with the plot, or what little there is of it. You have a chunk of the characters from the video game DOA get invited to a tournament that ultimately fulfills another nefarious plan by the movie's villain. This whole premise is decidedly weak. Each character gets a tiny introduction on who they are and why they matter, then go from scene to scene with no further development to speak of. The evil plot hatched against the fighters also falls flat and ends up being predictably weak. All the scenes that make up this story feel like they are going through the motions and are nothing more than set pieces for the fight choreography (more on that later). Not only that the movie creates its own plot holes by contradicting its own rules. For instance the rules of the fight are no weapons and you must win by knock out. Both rules are repeatedly broken without anybody batting an eyelash. To summarize there is no story to keep you engaged.

Next you have the obvious fan service without a cause. So DOA the video game got its fame from having sexy girls, and this movie tries hard to really capitalize on that. I wouldn't be surprised if a 1/3 of all the footage in the film was just shots of the girls in various sexy outfits and poses. There is even a totally pointless throwaway scene that has all the girls play volleyball (an obvious nod to the DOA Beach Volleybal VG). The funny thing about all this attention to pretty girls and their pretty body parts is there isn't any daring or overtly sexual content from any of it. While the movie was rated PG-13 when it comes to sexual content (what I would figure most DOA fans would be looking for) the movie fall straight onto PG territory. I have seen more risque content on prime time television.

Now this is a martial arts movie at its core. And I will admit that the fight choreography is a strong saving grace for this movie. I will also admit that the fight choreography is pretty impressive when you take into account a lot of the main stars are not martial artists by trade. The fighting is aggressive and at time quite creative. I see a lot of wirework, but most of it is done really well and feel more grounded in reality (not all mind you). Not all fight scenes are well choreographed with some looking a bit cheesy, and a lot of the sets chosen don't help matters much (nor do the styrofoam walls everybody falls through all the time). The only real problem I have with the fight scenes is I just don't feel engaged in most of the fights. I think this is atributed more to the weak character development than the choreography. It's hard to care if the hero gets a few hits when they are little more than a face on the screen to me. Still the fight scenes do shine and it's not hard to see why some people love this film because of it.

The Blu-Ray itself looks really impressive. The high definition does stand out with the vibrant colors of the film and some of the varying details or themes from the scenes. Visually this disc is all A's. Audio is pretty good, but nothing to really crow about. It takes advantage of the Dolby 5.1 surround, but I didn't notice any particularly impressive clarity. I even had a little annoying experience on some scenes where the dialog was real quiet, but once you queue the music or explosion the audio contrast gets distracting. To be fair this wasn't nearly as prevalent as I heard in other films. The special features are pretty sparse, but better than nothing I suppose. Btw the bonus features are NOT in high definition. Here is the rundown:

East Meets West - It's runs about ten minutes long and is more of a promotional feature than a making of documentary. I only saw a few minutes of it as the whole presentation was screaming ""press kit"".

Deleted Scenes - Mostly filler content with nothing that would have made the film more interesting if it was added. Kinda boring.

Theatrical Trailer - Self explanatory.

DOA: Dead or Alive is purely a movie meant for fans of the video game, and gives little else to the casual fan. The martial arts fan can find something interest in the fights if they don't care about the wafer thin plot. Action movie fans? Well there are a million of these kinds of action with no content movies out there so it depends on what your threshold is. The casual viewer may want to either rent or look elsewhere.",1348531200,,5046,4.395074946466809

Very enjoyable movie. RottenTomatoes.com only gave it a 34% rotten rating which I think is low and my movie tastes usually match with the critics on there.

They have the fitness to be able to rise to the challenge.  What is more important is that they were able to lend to the movie's characters their own personal charisma.  That made what was an absolutely awful story very entertaining to watch unfold.

Here's the scoop. Fighters/assassins are invited to compete in an elimination challenge on a private resort type Island. The winner gets a cool ten million dollars. What they don't know is that the proprietor (an uber-sleazy Eric Roberts) is programming their skills into a gizmo that allows him to create the ultimate army which he can market to other countries. There are other sub-plots but that's pretty much it in a nutshell.

The producers/director make this sort of a James Bond type flick. Over-sized sets, cool devices, a megalomaniac who wants to rule the world (or at least profit from others who want to) and some very 007 type music. There are a lot of well choreographed fight scenes as well. They are well directed and well shot (as is the entire movie). It's all a lot of fun. Everybody involved gets what's going on and plays it as such.

As for the actors: I know Jaime Pressly, Devon Aoki and, of course, Eric Roberts. All the others were new to me but they do a decent enough job to move things along. This is all about the fun and action. It's strictly a beer and pizza kind of flick, but as long as you know that going in you shouldn't be disappointed.

Pardon me, but when ""DOA: Dead or Alive"" teamed up those three girls as the leads, I get the whole ""Charlie's Angels"" vibe, especially when there's fighting going on in an exotic location and frequent eye-candy.  Anyway, the story goes is that a group of fighters have been chosen to participate in a series of one-on-one fights started by Eric Roberts, and whoever wins get all; one joins for revenge, the other for the prize, the host is up to no good, et ceteriha, if you've seen ""Enter the Dragon"", the whole movie's like that except no one dies from brain edema after filming.  Like the franchise's overarching 'plot', it's pretty irrelevant and most would see it for one thing only: the bounce.  Which the film, sadly, doesn't have.

I've played enough DOA games and read enough of its fan porn to fill up an Encyclopedia Britannica set, so I'm well adapt about the material enough that judge this adaptation to be goofy but passable.  Just about all of the DOA3-based characters appear in this film, with the exception of Hitomi who had better things to do in Germany, although most of them are cameos that only appear once and never again.  Again, the most prominent leads in the film are Kazumi (played by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Miho/dp/B00005JNTX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Miho</a>), Tina (played by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Joy-Hickey/dp/B0019CLMW8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Joy Hickey</a>), and Christie (played by that pop star from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Liam-Neeson-s-Torture-Avenger/dp/B002436WJE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Liam Neeson's Torture Avenger)</a>.  The movie does has its supporters: Ayane, an extremely Caucasian ninja assassin who's ordered to kill Kazumi and the film disregarded their half-sibling relationship from the games because that would've been funny; Ryu Hayabusa, who's actor looks laughably nothing like the Ryu Hayabusa in the game (although his skills in ""Ninja Warrior"" isn't anything to joke around); Tina's father Bass who looks more like a steroid Billy Ray Cyrus and making a lousy lesbian joke; and Zack, because every video game movie needs a token wise-cracking fool to get on my nerves, although Zack in the videogames is also like that, so I should give the movie a point for accuracy.  There's also two guys named Max and Weatherby, but they don't appeared in the games and thus aren't worth discussing further.

As far as the casting choices, I'm not too impressed with the girls; I always had trouble finding Devon Aoki attractive, because her face almost looks like the Lady in the Radiator from ""Eraserhead"".  The actresses are even more bland than the original characters they're portraying.  It's rather disappointing for Jamie Pressly, who I would expect to give more spunk to her hot-tempered wrestler like she did as Joy.

The fights are just okay and the CG effects are beyond fake.  Fanservice wise, it's overbearing and obnoxious with one particularly extreme close-up shot of a fighter's rump, but given what this film is based on, I expected this kind of treatment.  For all the flaws it had, ""DOA: Dead or Alive"" does follow the source material to a decent degree.  It could've been much less than what it is.",1275696000,,3535,5.482504604051566

2650862,4,B000I0RNXY,"I know the movie is based on a video game, but that usually isn't a good sign for a film.  But not only did this have good action scenes, but also pretty good characterization and quality acting - at least one that is fitting for this type of film.  Not that the movie is realistic, but my only gripe would be the suspension of belief required for the escape scene.

The movie focuses on four women, and a couple of men who tag along to some undiscovered East Asian island for a fight tournament that has been taking place annually for 21 years. The winner to get 10 million dollars (US dollars, HK dollars, we don't know.

Three of the women, played by Jaime Pressley, Holly Valance, Devon Aoki become friends. Sarah Carter plays the daughter of the man who sponsored the tournament until his untimely death preceding this current one. The current organizer, played by Eric Roberts, turns out to have some devious ideas.

Each of the women have ulterior motives.  Jaimie Pressly plays a women's wrestler and daughter of another wrestler played by Kevin Nash (also invited to the tournament).  She needs to prove to herself that she is also a warrior despite professional wrestling's reputation as a fake sport.  Holly Valance plays a thief who is there to steal the $100 million in the vault, Devon Aoki plays a ninja clan princess there to find her brother who had disappeared at the previous year's tournament - she is being chased by Natassia Malthe, who is sent to assassinate her for leaving the clan.  Meanwhile, she is being guarded by Kane Kosugi (who was also invited to the tournament).

Each actress is into character and does a good job displaying the motivations behind her character. There is a good chemistry between the actresses on screen, and it's very believable that they become friends despite being rivals.  And the chemistry is there among all the cast, between Valance and Matthew Marsden, who plays Valance's partner in crime and romance, and Aoki and Kosugi, who share an unsaid fondness for each other.  The action scenes are fun and varied, some ranging from the comdedic Jackie Chan style and some straight-forward fights.  Male viewers get a bonus of eye candy, escpecially with the women's beach volleyball scene.

The dvd extras deserve special mention with the cast interviews, which complement the film very well. Of course, this is B movie, but one that stands out - not only does it do action well, but characters I cared for, good characterization, good acting all-around anc good direction.",1262995200,2,2529,4.797235023041475

2650868,2,B000I0RNXY,"Whilst watching this movie, I became convinced of a couple of things: the filmmakers obviously wanted to replicate what&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mortal-Kombat/dp/0790729997/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mortal Kombat</a>&nbsp;had done for the adaptation genre ten years ago, and every single one of them had a fixation with breasts that goes beyond the gimmick of the game series. Both of these aspects become obvious throughout the course of this 87-minute debacle that's sure to give critics just another reason to bash on game-based movies.

The story: the best fighters from around the world - including a Japanese princess (Devon Aoki,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sin-City/dp/B00005JNTX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sin City</a>), a pro wrestler (Jaime Presley,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Name-is-Earl/dp/B000G6BL88/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Name is Earl</a>), and a beautiful assassin (Holly Valance,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Taken/dp/B001TODCII/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Taken</a>) - are called to partake in a tournament. Their reasons for joining are diverse - the princess Kasumi is searching for her lost brother Hayate (Collin Chou,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Forbidden-Kingdom/dp/B001BEK8HO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Forbidden Kingdom</a>), Tina the wrestler is desperate to prove to the world that she's not a fake, and the assassin Christie plans to steal the prize money - but when it becomes clear that the tournament is merely a cover for a more sinister operation instigated by organizer Donovan (Eric Roberts,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Best-of-the-Best/dp/B0002O7XUE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Best of the Best</a>), the warriors must cast aside their differences to escape with their lives.

While the film has no shortage of characters from the game series, you'll get to actually know next to none of them because the focus is constantly on the three starring ladies, who are highlighted more for their quirks and sex appeal than for their respective backgrounds or fighting abilities. Characters like Hayate, Hayabusa (Kane Kosugi,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blood-Heat/dp/B00029NM5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blood Heat</a>), and Ayane (Natassia Malthe,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elektra/dp/B0007PBWEQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elektra</a>) are major players in the games, but in the movie, they're presented as little more than afterthoughts in favor of the teasing sensuality, light lesbianism, and partial nudity - all of which are presented as though the viewer is eavesdropping on the classroom daydream of a 15-year-old boy.

What about the action? Ten martial arts showdowns highlight the fighting aspect of the franchise. To run down the list: Tina vs. Zack (Brian White), Hayabusa vs. three guards, and the sword fight involving Helena (Sarah Carter) are good; Kasumi vs. Ayane, Helena vs. Christie, Hayate vs. Donovan, and Donovan vs. the girls are decent; and Leon (Silvio Simac) vs. Kasumi and Tina vs. Bass (Kevin Nash) are in the negative-star range. Max vs. Bayman also takes place, but it's too much of a joke to consider. Though it lacks a proper term, I label the action in DOA as ""pop fighting"" - lots of posing, quick cuts, wire-fu, and the performing of moves that not even suspension of disbelief can make plausible. In particular, the Leon/Kasumi encounter is a study in ridiculousness.

I won't even get into the forsaken acting, the brain-dead dialogue (""I am your servant, but if you leave the compound, I am honor-bound to kill you""), the ridiculous production (overdone sound effects, repetitious transitions), or the fact that Hayabusa walks through the entire movie wearing his headband like an idiot, but rest assured that this is one silly movie. DOA might have been a great film back in 1995, but nowadays, it's thoroughly behind the times in what an action movie can be. The film received only limited promotion in North America, and I'm not surprised. Director Corey Yuen (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Transporter/dp/B00008AOVL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Transporter</a>) really could've done better than this.",1217462400,,4522,6.8591304347826085

The first 15 minutes or so had me thinking the movie would suck because the fighting/intro to the characters seemed really cheesy to me. There were also  a couple other teeth-gratingly cheesy moments in this movie to boot.

As the movie went on, the action actually started to really impress me and it lost that cheesy feeling it gave me near the beginning. I also really liked the women (of course) in the movie to, with my favorite fight being the one between Helena and Christie.

I've never even played any of the DOA games before, much less have any vague knowledge of the plot or characters, so I can't tell you how closely it follows the games, but the direction they go with this film, I just like how upbeat, and non-serious it is.

There's plenty of characterization, plot, and action. Mostly on the female characters, and the characters related to them, have any back story, but at least they have back story, and it's done well.

They go CRAZY with some of the action scenes; while the choreography doesn't really seem all that complex, they do a lot of switching between different fights; one minute, you'll see Bayman Vs. Brad Wong, and then SWITCH! Christie Vs. Jann Lee, then back-and-forth between a number of other fighting scenes. Another case would be, switching between the volleyball scene, and one of the heroes infiltrating the villain's HQ.

But where this movie really goes is with the tongue-in-cheek humor, and the fanservice. Lingerie girl in the elevator. Two girl fighters sharing a bed...lesbian suggestions ensue. Wrestling girl facing off with her wrestling father.

Three gorgeous women - a Japanese princess, a professional wrestler and an assassin/thief - travel to an island to compete in the world's greatest martial arts tournament in ""DOA,"" a dumb-dumb karate-chopping extravaganza (derived from the video game ""Dead or Alive"") that has all the wit, credibility and intellectual heft of a lesser episode of ""Charlie's Angels"" (or the equally lame movies derived there from).

The women are portrayed by Jaime Pressly, Devon Aoki and Holly Valance, three no-talent actresses who do at least manage to kick up a storm in the movie's nonstop fight scenes - though, of course, in the post-""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" style of the day, all the martial arts moves pay little or no heed to even the most rudimentary laws of gravity and physics.

It was fun.
I'm not going to own it, but it was fun and much better than Ultraviolet.

- Fast action.
- Acrobatic martial arts.
- Gorgeous girls all around (so much better looking than the Charlie's Angels trio and they had Sarah Carter who I just loved when I first saw her in the tv show Smallville)
- Eric Roberts as a bad guy on the tv show Heroes and a bad guy here. He's perfect for those types of roles.
- Great sets that get smashed to pieces
- Lots and lots of fighting that is so unrealistic you laugh at the silliness of it, but love it at the same time

If it wasn't for all the scantly clad bodies and sexual themes, this no-blood fight movie would have been rated PG.

Yes, everyone who gets slashed by a sword just falls down with no blood. No effort went into any type of makeup work on the main characters after taking several punches in the face. Oh, well, we like our female leads looking pretty throughout I guess.

It was a movie where you turn your brain off, laugh out loud a couple of times and enjoy the scenery and action.  Pure fun, but not an oscar winner by any stretch of the imagination.

The dialog can drive you nutty, the choreography is fun, and the extras are worth checking out.

Negatives for fans of the following:
If you're a hardcore Ayane fan, sorry, you'll have to wait for a Ninja Gaiden movie because she comes across as an Elecktra knockoff who doesn't have a fight scene to do her justice.
If you're a Ryu fan, he's a pansy with one good fight sequence.
No Ein, but Hayate brings a touch of ""Kiss of the Dragon"" kicked up a notch.
No Hitomi, super brief cameos to Gen Fu, Brad Wong, Lei Fang, Bayman, and Jann Lee.

Positives for fans of the following:
Christie (no longer an assassin, she's a professional thief who has 'loner' lines and is always working with somebody), Tina, and Kasumi are the triple threat heroines of the film. So for fans of these characters you're in for a treat.
Zack, Leon, Donovan, and Bass have well dispersed interactions along with some good fights (bearing in mind the film is about 90 minutes, which is a blessing and curse). Kudos to the roles of Zack and Bass, for me they were just what the movie needed.

Epilogue:
The one thing that bugged me was that with the exception of Kasumi and Tina, there wasn't a whole lot of exposition about why they were there. The game wasn't too deep either, but if this movie was described as a pie, the ending would be the fluffy top part of the pie with the least amount of substance (in the game this was reversed).

As a final side note the movie incorporates a lot of nods to its genre and to the game. It was a blast watching some signature moves make it into the movie and although I would've liked to have seen a lot more it was more than enough to keep me entertained. Was so surprised I ended up watching it twice because I had a hard time believing how much I enjoyed it, but it was still a blast through round 2.",1191369600,2,2121,4.348484848484849

The characters are very much who they were in the game and in some cases thier personalities are richer and much more deeply explored. The game is a kick-@$$ fighting game and this movie is a kick-@$$ movie about fighting... simple as that. Don't look for much more cuz, in truth, this is a somewhat shallow movie.

If you give it the benefit of the doubt, you can say the plot is pretty thin.  Practically non-existent in fact, but then have you ever played the DOA game?  I own one of them.  In fact, I only own one video game and it's DOA Hardcore.

Lots of pretty spectacular unbelievable fighting, and a lot of cute ladies in cool outfits.  Kasumi and her fighting coustume were disapointments, Ayane I liked, Helena was --well, different, Tina was better than I expected, and Christie was far better than I anticipated. And Weatherbee: How could you not love Weatherbee?  While the male fighters in this film were pretty much in it just to play the roles of punching bags for the girls, they seemed to have fun with their parts and were good sports about playing under
achieving characters. I give this film 4 stars for presenting an hour and a half of what you would pretty much expect but no more.  I could have been better but it also could have been much worse.  If you are a fan of any of the games you should at least be able to say you saw it.",1189900800,,1692,4.204968944099379
2650897,5,B000I0RNXY,"You have to admire a movie that admits what it is and who it is for.  Not a lot of movies out there do that.  This is, as another reviewer points out, a true guilty pleasure.  The fight scenes are amazing, beautifully done, and leave you breathless.  And yes, the women are attractive, but would you expect anything else from a movie based upon a video game?  I have to admit, I don't really play fight games.  I tend to enjoy the rpgs.  Still, this is a great movie when you want only to have your brain numbed after a long week of work.  The acting isn't too bad and the characters are wonderful to watch.  I really give this movie a high review because it admits what it is and what it is for.  Watch it.",1189900800,2,707,4.094890510948905
2650898,5,B000I0RNXY,"Before watching this movie, check your brain at the door.

This movie is the best bad movie I have seen in years. It doesn't pretend to be anything other than a bad action movie, and in it's own right it sucks and rocks all at the same time.

If you love a good ""bad"" action movie, this flick is all about it!",1189814400,2,309,3.967741935483871
2650899,3,B000I0RNXY,"This movie is more like a two part ""She Spies"".  Mechanically done fight sequences, cheesy computer graphics (well, at least the computerized video scoring screens are a new idea for a karate movie), and loads of cute girls to stare at are worth the cost of renting the DVD. Tura Satana--where are you when we need you?",1189641600,,319,4.5964912280701755
2650900,3,B000I0RNXY,"I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by this film.  After reading about all the delays, horrid reviews, and the whole week it played in my local theatre, I had to convince myself to rent it.  Now I have to convince myself not to buy it.

If you like movies in the vein of ""Mortal Kombat"", then this is for you.  Minimal plot to keep you busy through the fight scenes, but the plot actually makes sense.  The fight scenes are very well-choreographed.  But I expect no less from Corey Yuen, who is simply brilliant.  The acting was what it was.  Devon Aoki came through better than she did in ""War""; Jamie Pressly was a lot of fun as Tina; Holly Valance did a nice job as Christie, and Sarah Carter was a good Helena.  Natasse Malthe was a bit under-used, and that did disappoint me; the ads and interviews would have you believe she was a main character.

And that really was the problem with this movie, the PR.  The big scene everyone talked about with the five girls taking on 300 warriors?  Nope, not the film at all.  It was hyped the wrong way.  Oh, and it was a bit too short at 87 minutes or so.

As for the DVD, the features are somewhat sparse.  About 10 deleted scenes which shouldn't have been deleted, and a 20 minute ""making of"" sequence.  That's it.  For $25 I expect a bit more.

If you're looking for a good flick to kill some time, go for it.  The next ""Enter the Dragon"" it isn't, but it is well-above the disasters which were ""Bloodrayne"", ""House of 100 Corpses"" and other video-game flicks done by Uwe Boll.",1189641600,4,1531,4.286713286713287
2650901,4,B000I0RNXY,"I used to be a fan of the games, back when I played video games.  So the movie got my attention.  Not enough to see it in the cinema, but upon its DVD release this week I bought it on impluse without even seeing it.  I'm happy with the purchase after watching it yesterday.  I was very worried this was going to be real bad and I be pissed spending full price for it.  But not so.  I'm a 28 y/o guy.  I'm not a teenage boy, and still the movie had enough sex appeal just like the game to keep my intrest.  I found the film entertaining throughout & funny in parts and stupid in others.  They even throw in beach volleyball like the game...clever.  I do agree with other reviewers Christie is very appealing, and same for Helena...I didn't care to much for Tina's character in the film though.
Overall if you like alot of eye candy with cool action sequences, then you'll enjoy the film I think.  They should have made it more violent & sexier with an R rating...my personal thought..",1189641600,2,983,4.2594594594594595
2650902,3,B000I0RNXY,"Video game to film adaptations rarely work as you no doubt already know.  Chances are if you've seen any previews of the Dead or Alive movie, you most likely laughed at how ridiculous it looked.  Well, guess what?  Here it is on DVD, and it's surprisingly not the terrible waste of film that many (including me) thought it would be.  Sure, it's nothing remotely great in the least, and even laughable in some spots, but as a whole, Dead or Alive is a fun and entertaining guilty pleasure that does it's job well.  A martial arts tournament is being held on a remote island, with many of the competitors being in the form of some incredibly hot babes (Holly Valance, Jamie Pressly, Devon Aoki, Sarah Carter, Natassia Malthe), who soon learn that there is more going on than it seems.  The action is good (courtesy of Transporter director Corey Yuen) and the movie delivers plenty of eye candy, no matter how inane or non-sensical the events that unfold turn out to be.  That aside, the film manages to pay some delightful homage to it's source material (volleyball anyone?), and while it's not always faithful to it, it's still a fun ride regardless.  Also featuring Eric Roberts, former wrestling star Kevin Nash, Matthew Marsden, Brian J. White (who looks exactly like Zack from the game) and look for Mortal Kombat star Robin Shou as the Pirate Leader.",1189468800,10,1354,4.7076271186440675

8143025,3,B000I0RNXY,"I'd really like to give this film a higher rating considering I'm a fan of the videogame series, but I can't fully recommend it.

The leads do a good enough job, but the main problem lies in the rampant over editing. Every fight scene is cut to smithereens. And it's a real shame too since the director has done martial arts films before, and judging by the behind the scenes footage, the performers weren't terrible either. In other words, no need to mask absolutely everything.

The film does earn a whole star for stopping the plot to include a gratuitous volleyball scene, just like the infamous spinoff video game.",1517356800,,619,4.669724770642202
