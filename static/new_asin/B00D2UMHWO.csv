5768052,5,B00D2UMHWO,"I have been walking with Leslie for many years now and I liked to vary my tapes. This is probably the most vigorous workout to date. Not that it is so difficult that you can't follow along,but the pace is quicker. I sort of miss that old ones with Mary Kay and the gang. This is good walk and workout that gets you going in a positive way.",1375574400,22,339,4.0

5768079,5,B00D2UMHWO,"Bought this dvd recently and am partaking in the 30 days- I am liking both the 'firm' and 'burn' days.
The only negative thing I found with this dvd is it seems as if the music is a bit too much as far as noise level on the 'burn' section, almost seems like it is overpowering Leslie as she speaks.",1523664000,,298,3.9833333333333334

5768084,4,B00D2UMHWO,While I really loved the idea of doing a 6 day a week challenge I just couldn't keep up.  And those with hip issues may want to just walk during the 'boosted walking' and chacha. I just love Leslie's workouts I have been doing them for years and they are the ones that I can do and keep doing through the years.,1520812800,,311,4.016129032258065
5768085,5,B00D2UMHWO,"Very good, was unable to do my usual walking with Sansone for a few weeks due to surgery. This is getting me back in the groove. I am not able to do the mat portion, but will do an additional walk session on the ""rest"" day.  As a veteran walker i was happy that this is not a soft workout, keeps me hard at it but not exhausted. I'd love her to do more dvd's like this, I have practically everything she's done but this might be my fave at the moment. The group is fine and friendly and fun to workout with. Good purchase.",1520812800,,522,3.9714285714285715

5768122,5,B00D2UMHWO,"Love it! Updated, new crew, new moves but definitely do-able! I've been doing Leslie's 2 mile walk almost every day for the past 5 months and needed something new. This dvd is great. I have to admit tho, I don't really use the track with the weights with lunges and squats, but get such a good workout with the other alone!! Keep 'em comin Leslie!!!",1519344000,,349,4.384615384615385
5768123,1,B00D2UMHWO,DVD- stopped playing- I then hit skip and got it to play- what year is this dvd from?  it should say what year because this dvd seems dated and not the same quality as the walk at home dvds- not to mention the music from what I heard was awful- ( this organ/keyboard ),1518998400,,268,3.962962962962963
5768124,1,B00D2UMHWO,"This video is bad.  Plays for a little bit then drags to the point you cannot even use it.  Very bad quality. Very disappointed, wanted to use this one every morning and the other 3 I ordered would be used in the evenings, alternating them on a daily basis.",1518998400,,257,4.224489795918367
5768125,5,B00D2UMHWO,"This video is 2 30-minute segments--the 1st segment is a cardo focused walk and the 2nd strength with weights. I like to do the weights first and the cardio segment last and feel like this gives me a tremendous all-over workout. I have been working out for years, mostly cycling. This is my favorite video (besides 5 Boosted Miles and Belly Blasting Walk; I have more of her dvds but these 3 are my favorites!). I generally jog or cycle outside but on rainy days or days I'd like to do some cross training, these are the most frequently pulled out dvd's. I feel like I really work all areas of my body and give myself the strength training that is so necessary but usually lacking when I stick to just aerobics. Having plateau'd for literally years, I have lost about 30 pounds with Leslie! I just love her bubbly, happy personality. Her videos are safe and adaptable to various levels of fitness. I highly recommend these dvds!",1518998400,,928,4.529761904761905
5768146,5,B00D2UMHWO,In these winter months it is nice to have someone to walk with and not pay the high cost of gyms. Do your exercise and straight to the shower.,1518652800,,142,3.9310344827586206
5768147,5,B00D2UMHWO,Good circuit walking workout with Leslie & her crew.,1518566400,,52,4.888888888888889
5768148,3,B00D2UMHWO,I like the 30 minute first video.  Having trouble jumping to the second one on my dvr.  I prefer walking with the usual group of people.  Different group this time but still a decent workout.,1518480000,,191,4.4
5768149,5,B00D2UMHWO,"I joined a gym 2 years ago, to get stronger, build muscle, and just improve overall fitness.  I got a late start, I was never an outdoorsy/exercise type for the first 60 years of my life, but a new relationship inspired me to be so.

Short story, I have gotten more out of two weeks/30 minutes/6 days a week with Leslie than two years with the gym. I sweat every time I work out with her (rarely did with a multiple machine 90 minute gym circuit 3x a week) although I worked hard. No, I did not hire a personal trainer--$30 a a 25 minute session was way out of my budget, especially when you had to commit to a minimum of 4 sessions/mo).

I realized that the gym equipment makes you stronger--for using the gym equipment, not everyday practical strength. I could do 3 sets of 25 reps at 70lbs on the lateral press and 3/25 pull/push 145 on hip ad and abductors, but struggled to lift a 40lb bag of softener salt--what good is that on a day to day basis?

I'm saving $35 and eighteen hours/mo (fee and workout time+commute) and getting a LOT more out of it. I'm stonger, more coordinated and my balance has greatly improved--in just two weeks.

Combining this tape with walking my dogs for an hour+ five days a week (weather permitting) and some additional free weight work, I am happy to FINALLY start accomplishing what I set out to do.

Note:  I discovered Leslie at my library, so have gotten this for free (tried several other instructors as well) but will be buying this and other LS dvds.

Impressed and so happy to have found an easy--and EFFECTIVE--work out regimen.",1517529600,,1574,4.422145328719723

5768152,2,B00D2UMHWO,"I was sooo bummed. I really like this work out but the DVD skips. It will stop playing altogether in the middle of the workouts. Its not my DVD player, my other discs are fine. When I turned it over, I noticed a bunch of scratches the first time I was using it. I can't use it because it is so annoying when it's playing.",1516752000,,321,3.953846153846154
5768153,1,B00D2UMHWO,"Liked the program.  The CD worked for 2 days.  Then, it cut out into the first 10 minutes.  Apparently can't return.  Not pleased.",1515456000,,130,4.521739130434782

5768198,5,B00D2UMHWO,"I have been doing 5 miles of Leslie's DVD's every day for a few years now.  The past year and a half  I mainly stuck to her Miracle Miles, but 3 days a week I started doing 1 of her Walk and Firm miles, and then 4 Miracle Miles. I even ordered a stronger version of the Miracle Miles band because I wasn't sweaty after 5 miles. I was getting bored so I asked my husband to get me the Walk Off in 30 days as a gift. Wow! This is the first time I can remember my muscles were actually challenged. Leslie doesn't count miles in the 30 day walk off, but I'm guessing both workouts together are equivalent to 4 miles, but I was challenged by this workout so I didn't feel the need to do the 5th mile. (You are not supposed to do both workouts in the same day, but since I do 5 miles everyday I figured I'd combine them. However I won't be doing this DVD everyday.  I'll stick to the 3 days I had been doing 1 Firm mile and 4 Miracle Miles) There are also no annoying comments from her cast during either of the workouts. My only complaint is that the workouts keep moving quickly, so I couldn't grab a sip of water as often as I do in her other videos. Otherwise this is one my new favorites!",1513123200,,1187,3.9789915966386555
5768199,5,B00D2UMHWO,"This is such a great exercise DVD. I started using it after I had my second C-section (8 weeks post-operation and with my doctors approval). I was heavy and very unfit.

The first time I could hardly do much but because you are walking you can do the exercises that you want or can. At times I stopped walking, but I always felt so much better after finishing it. The idea is to walk it off in 30 days. That was not my intent, I just wanted to tone up and feel better, so I never used the DVD daily as suggested.

As the weeks went by I was able to follow the exercise routine in full, and my legs and tummy area were definitely toning up. A year or two later I decided to join a Taekwondo gym (Because I find it hard to motivate myself to exercise at home and I find it a lot easier to follow a structured class with like minded people, however you will get very fit if you do this DVD daily). Since practicing Taekwondo I have become much fitter, but I still use this DVD. Now I use it as a strong warm up, around 20 minutes, and then I follow up with stretching and some Taekwondo exercises.

That is the best thing of this DVD. It doesnt matter your level of fitness, you can still use it and it is brilliant. I don't walk when I do this DVD anymore, I usually jog gently and I follow the exercises a bit quicker than the instructor.

I own many exercise DVDs and this is by far the best. Highly recommended.",1512950400,2,1412,4.068345323741007
5768200,5,B00D2UMHWO,It's a nice alternating walk and resistance program. Fun and effective.,1512432000,,71,5.545454545454546
5768201,5,B00D2UMHWO,I have a lot of Leslies dvds and this is one of my favorites. I like that I don't have to waste time learning complicated steps. I can just push play and get my heart rate up with a nice brisk walk.  This was a good purchase!,1511654400,,225,3.7872340425531914

5768204,5,B00D2UMHWO,"I love this DVD. This is the second Leslie Sansone DVD I've bought, I also have Tone Every Zone. This one is more challenging, but not too hard that you can't get through it. I love the simplicity, not hard to follow, but very effective. I hate confusing workouts where you're changing moves before you even get the hang of things. This DVD has 2 workouts that you rotate, one with just cardio on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. And another with strength training (weights) that you do on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. Sunday is your day of rest. I bought weighted gloves to use on the cardio day to make it a little more challenging (that's what Leslie does).  I'm trying to get back into shape and I personally think this is an awesome way to do it!",1510704000,10,751,4.442028985507246

5768247,5,B00D2UMHWO,"This is one of Leslie's greatest DVDs because: she doesn't carry on with her walkers with baby talk like other dvds, keeps on the beat correctly, has a diverse bunch of walkers and none of them compete for attention. I only had to roll my eyes a few times. This is one of her most professional dvds. She needs to read these reviews and find out what we viewers like and dislike. I want to exercise and not have to stop because she can't stop laughing about stupid comments.

Leslie, please do another dvd like this to add to my good collection. We love your energy but not the goofy hen cackling.",1508025600,,596,4.321428571428571

I modify the toning section so I don't put added stress on my knees and then I also do from the 5 mega miles DVD the upper body/ lower body sections.  I have lost 8 lbs do far.

It's definitely the most difficult one I've done from her. The Burn portion is quite challenging. Definitely gets the heartrate up. The Firm portion is just OK. Lots and lots of squatting.

5768258,5,B00D2UMHWO,"I LOVE these workouts! There are two 30 min workouts on the DVD; one is strength training, & the other is strictly cardio. Leslie is her usual upbeat, encouraging self. The recommendation is that you alternate the 2 wrkouts 6 days a each week, taking Sunday (or another day of your choosing) as a 'rest' day. This is the 30 day challenge. I can now proudly say that two days ago, I completed the 30 day challenge. I feel it's very ""do-able"" but effective. I can see some lean definition in my arms, & tho I didn't take measurements before beginning challenge, I lost the few extra lbs I'd gained on recent vacation, & can definitely tell a reduction in my waistline. In the 30 min strength wrkout, you start out doing about 5 mins of Leslie's usual ""walk"" moves as warm up, then go right into using hand weights, doing squats & lunges. If you have issues doing squats & lunges, this is probably not the workout for you, lol. You also do bicep curls, & other upper body strengthening repetitions. It ends with about 10 mins on mat doing a few other arm exercises, & ab work. I'm very impressed that so much is covered in just 30 mins. I also like that both wrkouts show an on-screen clock countdown for last 10 mins. These will def be favorite 'go to' workouts for me. ",1502409600,2,1268,4.372881355932203
5768259,5,B00D2UMHWO,"I got this DVD from my mother. I alternate between workouts like this, and Jillian workouts. These are the easy ones. I don't feel that it's as intense as a Jillian workout, but I certainly still feel like I did something after it. I add hand weights and ankle weights to make it a bit more intense.  She is a very encouraging instructor and she makes sure you feel comfortable doing her workouts, even if she does creep me out a little bit. Her eyes.. they're just to big..",1501977600,,474,4.325842696629214

5768268,5,B00D2UMHWO,I have 8 Leslie Sansone DVD's and enjoy everyone of them. This DVD is a walk program with added toning exercises which really get your juices flowing. It is a comprehensive exercise program and I use it for my TOPS group once a month.,1497657600,,234,4.340909090909091
5768269,4,B00D2UMHWO,"I really like this dvd (as well as the belly blast) the burn segment is the walking with some bouncing/mild jumping which is different from the belly blast dvd (was a concern when purchasing). the firm is also different than the floor segments of belly blast (a couple of the exercises are the same but the majority is different) there are more a lot of squats & some lunges, I was surprised how quickly my knees strengthened. moves smoothly into arm exercises/weight lifting that is more challenging as you increase in amt of wt being used. enjoyable to do - I feel as though I've worked out can feel muscles groups strengthening without the stiffness & soreness the next day; but again not a lot of stretching at the end of workout - so you do have to do that on your own for the most part, some may not need it but I definitely do.

5768275,4,B00D2UMHWO,"The first segment of the DVD is similar to the other Leslie Sansone workouts with the same basic steps except that the session is shorter than her other workouts (30 minutes). The second segment, intended for use on alternate days,  emphasizes strength training using weights while standing, doing lunges and squats, and while  lying on a yoga mat.  Although the strength training with weights is not as easy as the walking moves, it adds an important aspect for maintaining  physical health.

I didn't realize the ""firm"" part of the DVD involved so much bending and floor position, so I am unable to do much of that one due to my herniated disc, but I am not disappointment in my purchase. I am enjoying mixing this one with another one of hers, since I bought them for the walking routines.

You can make them higher impact if you boost more and add low hand weights. I have five DVDs now and alternate the walking DVDs with the toning DVDs.,1492214400,,315,4.3559322033898304
5768305,5,B00D2UMHWO,"I've done this video several times and must say by far it is one of her most awesome works to date for the intermediate and advanced crowd.  I own a lot of her videos and some are really tailored for those who are just beginning to workout or would like something low impact and friendly on the joints. I enjoy her videos because there is something for everyone unlike many other fitness videos out there.  For those that are looking for a challenge, this incorporates cardio and strength training.  I find it is not overly exhausting and like that it doesn't leave you wiped out.  It seems to provide a great balance.  I like the alternating schedule between the Burn 30 and Firm 30... gives you a chance to switch it up and not get too bored.

I've lost 45 pounds in the past mainly doing her videos, so i know they work as long as you commit to pressing the play button everyday and put in the work!  I have about 75 more pounds to lose and hoping to reach my goal this year.  This video is just what i needed to ""bump it up a little"" (in Leslie's words lol) along with other activities i regularly do.  Starting to do the 30 day challenge today.

5768315,5,B00D2UMHWO,"I'm female, 5'7 and about 187 pounds, early 30s, mom of one. The higher calorie burn is from the aerobic workout and lower the strength training portion. I'm not a newbie but not advanced, I would say I'm somewhere above beginner. Keep in mind these calorie burns will vary depending on several factors. Now to my review! I discovered Leslie on YouTube. I needed something easier that day and she offered a nice and steady walk. I enjoyed it. I tried others she had on there and some for me were much too easy. Something I would do again if I needed steps or something to just get moving. I decided to check out Amazon to purchase a DVD (I'm also a huge Jessica Smith fan too and own several of her DVDs) and read reviews on a couple different ones. The reviews on this from fans were saying that this was more challenging than other workouts of hers. I have to agree! Hand weights are used in both. Both are a total body workout and one focuses more on cardio and the other strength training. I hate floor work, and the segment was short on the floor part of strength training and I didn't think it was that bad. Some movements I missed reps because my back and neck muscles aren't very strong but I could still do the movement and will get better as I do it more. It wasn't that crazy, and like I said I'm not a fan of floor work. You can make this more or less intense by getting heavier weights, not using weights etc. The cardio especially flew by, I had a good amount of time in peak HR. I was working hard but enjoying it, not doing super crazy moves , it didn't feel like a workout but I got a great workout. In order to have long term success you need to be able to keep up and want to do your workouts or you won't. I feel both Leslie and even Jessica I mentioned previously offer that. I love walking, kickboxing and barre the most and this had a slight feeling of all especially in the cardio portion of the workout. Plus weights used in both so you're toning and getting more of a workout! I would say that's a win win. Highly recommend this DVD and the price point too is great. I usually jump around with all my DVDs but I'm going to try and do this for a solid month and see what my results are using this combined with weight watchers.",1490745600,25,2252,4.179310344827586

5768318,3,B00D2UMHWO,"I'd say 3.5 stars, but she doesn't talk about the importance of breathing with the repetitions in the Firm portion, and it is also lacking in work on the triceps (a problem area for many women).  The floor work, which I usually hate, is manageable, and again, no breathing instruction.  I like it, but I'm already getting bored with it, down to 2 or 3 times a week and need something else to mix it up.  She's positive and upbeat and it's a good option for low impact individuals.",1489881600,,480,4.370786516853933

5768320,5,B00D2UMHWO,"I have been an avid Leslie fan for years but in August of 2016 I decided to really try to lose weight. Through diet moderation and exercising with Leslie at least 3 days a week I have lost 40 pounds and gained a tremendous amount of muscle. My favorite workout of hers is ""Walk Strong."" In that workout you alternate 3 minutes of fast walking with 3 minutes of weight training for 30 minutes. She makes you do an enormous amount of squats and she throws in a few sets of lunges as well. Walk It Off in 30 Days kicked my butt in the weight portion. There are even more squats than Walk Strong and a ton of lunges, as well as upper body work in the lunge position. I would estimate 10-15 minutes of squats and lunges. By the time I finished my butt and legs were trembling. The squats and lunges have really toned and tightened my butt and thighs. I love them when I have finished them. The next day I could feel the changes and new muscles in my butt hurt. The cardio portion made me sweat right away but was doable and fun. Not a beginner walk video for those new to exercise. Long time Leslie fans will love this video. So glad I got it as I am trying to lose another 40 pounds.",1489536000,9,1179,4.108225108225108

Due to inactivity, my energy level was non-existent, but i forged ahead anyway with this Walk it off in 30 days program.  The first 2 times of each set was murder on me, and the first time of each I DID NOT even finish without a break.  I began August 23rd, 2016, with no energy; could not even use ANY hand weights at first, but finally graduated from nothing to 2.5 pounds each, then 5 each, the 8 each.  I weighed in at 165, 5'6"" age 59, size 14 (were tight).  By Thanksgiving 2016, I lost 17 pounds, and for the first time in my life - in a size 10, comfortably.  I was diligent about the 30 day program, then went to alternate days, because I LOVE LOVE LOVE the workout with the weights - the non-walking workout -  until November. I could not believe (still) that I am in a size 10,  and wish I would have measured to know the inches that were lost too.  Don't hesitate.

5768332,4,B00D2UMHWO,"Just finished with the 30 minute walk program.  Good things about this workout are that it went fast, music was okay although in the last two minutes it became strangely out of sync with what was going on.  Notable is more side steps and double side steps, so if on carpet, a little bit challenge.  The cha cha steps also are difficult on carpet but very few of these are done.  The music is okay. Some single and double knee ups, the usual hamstrings, arms up and out a little bit, and a quick sstretch.  Leslie's nervous over the top laughs are minimal.  A very heterogeneous crowd, younger, enthusiastic, with one older lady (grey hair) sometimes looking like a deer caught in the headlights yet a real trooper, and as mentioned in another review, this is the only presence of anyone over 35 (I'm guessing obviously).

5768370,2,B00D2UMHWO,"First, I would like to say that this is the first Leslie DVD that I use. First, the DVD did not work on my multizone DVD player. I had to contact the company who sold me the machine to have them fix the issue. Then few remarks:
- burn section: the heart rate gors really up and down as she mentions it and this is great, and you sweat a lot, however the only 4 repeated moves ata different pace made it a little boring.
-the firm section: it is true that she works all the body segments: lower limbs, upper limbs and abs, but the number of reps ia not enough at all and I did not feel the muscle tone that i usually feel when at thr gym and that for me is the one that defines my muscle shaping. So the exercices are not strong enough. I also compared it to a other certified trainer whose DVDs I purchased . You sweat less with her but you feel the efficacy of your moves.
- her smile and that of the runners behind her are so fake unfortunately
- no timing is on the screen except for the last 5 minutes, ehich makes you wonder how much of the training you did

I will review the 2 other DVDs as well (which by the way did not work at first) in order to be able to give a fair judgment of leslie's workout, as frankly I did not like this DVD. I will continue using it for diversity among the 10 DVDs of home fitness I have, but honestly I could not help myself but comparing this DVD to the other ones I tried before, which were highly satisfying.",1473638400,2,1449,3.979381443298969

It's still wasn't as intense as I'd like, but overall it's a good workout.

5768398,5,B00D2UMHWO,"We have done a couple other Leslie Sansone videos, including Walk-Kick immediately before this.

I've always liked how she gives great, encouraging advice, and doesn't wear the skimpy outfits.  (Like I want my teenage boys seeing that!)  This video is no exception.

The video consists two 30 minute parts designed to be done on alternating days.  ""Burn 30"" is more aerobic and calorie-burning, where ""Burn 30"" is more strength and muscle-building.  (Though she does do a little of the other on each day just to keep things rolling.)

Unfortunately, I made the mistake thinking this was the about same level of intensity as Walk-Kick.  IT IS NOT!  It is actually a lot more advanced.  The first time I did the ""Firm 30"", I was sweating, sure, but I didn't realize how bad it kicked my butt until I had to run downstairs for something.  Three steps down, my legs turned to total Jell-o and I fell down.  You can't say this isn't doing anything to my muscles!  Wow!

For a beginner, I'd definitely recommend one of her easier videos first.  Once you work up to it, however, this will definitely make you stronger and leaner.  (Also, remember Leslie's big thing:  How much you do doesn't matter as much as doing it EVERY DAY.)",1465948800,10,1223,4.666666666666667

I've been doing Leslie Sansone workouts for a year now. The weather has been nice so I've been walking outdoors and have even started jogging lately. I was worried about going back to the videos thinking I wouldn't enjoy them anymore now that I am jogging. This morning, I had only a short bit of time to workout and this was perfect! High energy, low impact in a short 30 minutes. Very excited because the summer heat is creeping up and I have something new to keep me interested in working out.

Update: Just did the FIRM portion and it's great. I was worried about using heavier weights (5 lb) but it wasn't too complicated or too much for my 45 year old arms. Looking forward to getting better at doing this video and seeing results.",1464307200,,995,4.287234042553192

Some of the transitions are a little off, but you get used to it after a while.  I really appreciate the option to use the music only to change things up a bit.  Some of the walkers are sometimes off beat, but hey, it breaks up the monotony, lol.  I like looking at the walkers because they may do the moves a little bit differently, and I like that (at times).  It was nice to see a variety of demographics represented in this video. Oh, the walkers with the sweat on them-I swear that's staged- no one else is sweating like them-granted we all are different, but seriously 3 people pouring sweat in the same area-ha!  Hey, get ready for some strong arms, Ms. Leslie has us doing ""sky reaches"" for about 1.1 minutes.  lol!

If you are hesitating about whether to buy, don't.  I am a witness this video works.  Let it be known, there is truth in the title of this video, but the name is also for marketing purposes.  Do what you can, when you can.  The important thing is to MOVE, yes?!  I started with 2 pound weights, and have finally transitioned to 5 pound weights.

I like this workout a lot, it's a little different than others as it feels a bit higher impact than some (which I like) but it's not crazy aerobics either. It's a nice in between. The steps are really quite easy (and I am hopeless when it comes to any dance-like routine including zumba), I'm serious when I tell you ""if I can do it, you can do it"" and as always if you cannot manage a particular step just walk in place to the music.

I've loved most every Leslie Sansone DVD and this is no exception. Oh and for those that are curious the distance in this video is approximately 2 miles according to my Jawbone UP tracker.

This DVD provides a great free weight challenge especially has you increase the poundage and in only 30 minutes. Wonderful!  The 30 minute cardio workout is a nice combination of slow and fast paced movements. Since I have so many of Leslie's DVD s  I don't follow the plan. I use the firm DVD on the days I also go to Zumba class two days a week and do the cardio followed by the firm session to give a great hour workout session.

Use caution when working out with weights without a trainer to instruct you.  I found out the hard way.",1442620800,2,525,4.542553191489362
5768639,5,B00D2UMHWO,"I have many Leslie Sansone DVD's but I really enjoy this one.  You get 2 30 minute workouts, one is a burn and the other is a firm.  I alternate both of them and I haven't gotten bored yet.  There's lots of Leslie moves but you have the option of using weights which is great.  Her ""troupe"" of exercisers are upbeat and happy and Leslie has lots of energy.  This is a good DVD for a beginner because you have some options.  I started with 3lb weights (dumbbells) and now I'm up to 5lb weights.  You'll need a yoga/exercise mat and if you can, pick up a pair of weight gloves.  They are not expensive and you'll want to protect your hands if you're using weights.  You can also use hand weights.  I would and have recommended this DVD to my friends.",1441756800,,748,4.204225352112676
5768640,5,B00D2UMHWO,"Unlike other reviewers, I like the music and thought it was a lot better than much workout music I've heard. I love working out with Leslie. I have tried workouts with Denise Austin and I feel like her workouts are harder for me to follow along with. I am that person in the aerobics classes who struggles to stay in step with everyone and keep coordinated. The steps for this workout are so simple and Leslie does a great job of instructing you and makes it easy to follow along. That is really a compliment in my book! I love the cardio component of this workout and it is more intense than Leslie Sansone: Walk Away The Pounds: 30 Minute Walk which I do on days where I am a bit more low key. One last note is that there are some squats towards the end that bother my knees, so I just skip those and march instead.

I really struggled with the strength training component and only did that once. I think this DVD is worth the price for the cardio component alone.",1441584000,2,966,4.25

I recently have been trying to get myself back into exercising again after taking some time off.  This is my ""no excuses"" workout.  I can talk myself out of 45 minutes but I can't justify not trying to do at least 30 minutes.  I love that at 15 minutes Leslie informs you that you're halfway through and at 20 minutes into it, they start a countdown clock for the remaining 10 minutes. Great motivators!  After I'm done I feel that I've actually done a proper exercise routine.  What I really love is that you can modify these workouts for your fitness level.  I'm now able to add 3-5 lb. hand weights.  You can jog (fast walk) along with them or you can march in place or just walk and you still reap the benefits.

5768724,4,B00D2UMHWO,"This 30-Day set is a little more challenging that Leslie's usual fare, but it incorporates her classic walking moves and her usual bubbly (or for some people, annoying) personality. She makes me chuckle. The first 30-minute set is her typical walking routine, but a little more super-charged than the earlier videos. The 'extras' are attractive and appealing, and it is fun to watch the move in unison through some quick steps. Some jumps and cha-chas step up the pace. If you use light hand weights, you can also step up the difficulty.

The second 30-minute set is strength training and I have to admit while it seems easy (I was using 5 pound weights) I was plenty sore after doing it. The leg squats and ground work are a little more demanding than just walking.

I intermix this DVD with others in my collection - I especially like Leslie's 4-mile walk when I have the time. I think the strength training is an excellent addition.",1435190400,,935,4.66060606060606

Each workout is only 30 minutes long, including warmup and cool down, and the workouts are vigorous without being exhausting.  I've been steadily losing weight, but the biggest difference is in the toning and shaping of my body.  Her ""cast"" is fun to watch, and she gives plenty of cues and guidance.

I have to say this is a great addition to my collection!  It gets your heart rate up but doesn't over do it like some systems.  I have read some reviews where people have not purchased this video due to the lunges and squats.  I have a bad knee from years of playing field hockey and have been unable to participate in fitness crazes like Insanity.  This was not as hard on my knee as I thought it was going to be.  The only move I modified was the turning lunges.

5768807,5,B00D2UMHWO,"I really like this DVD.  I wanted to add strength training to my workout routine.  This is a great one for beginners.  I don't use the cardio one (""Burn 30"") e/o day like suggested - I do my regular cardio daily and the strength training (""Firm 30"") 3x a week.  The cardio one is a great workout, but I just like to mix it up a bit and love to get outside and walk and run or use some other walking workout dvds.  I have been doing the firming for 2 months and have noticed a big difference in my fitness.  The muscle building carries over to add endurance to my boxing and running workouts.  It was motivating to be able to increase the weights I use and also to realize that my squats, lunges and crunches were getting deeper as the weeks went on.  I use 5 and 8 pound dumbbells.  You will also need a yoga mat for the floor exercises.  All in all, I am very happy with this purchase.  The only thing I do not like - and debated about giving it four stars instead of five, but it is something that is easily corrected when you know about it:  she has you doing ""curls"" instead of ""crunches"" - where you curl your head up as you lift your shoulders.  This is a killer for the neck !!  I have compressed vertebrae in my neck and the curls were excrutiating !!  Instead, I use proper crunch form (relaxed neck, look at a spot on the ceiling - do not curl head up) and can do the ab workout painlessly (well, except for that excellent burn in the abs you want to have !!)",1429833600,7,1469,4.069686411149826

5768852,1,B00D2UMHWO,"I love Leslie but this DVD was so not for me....I guess I'll stick to my old favorites!
Things I loved about Leslie before that are changed in this DVD [or at least the Burn part of it which is what I used it for]:
-An emphasis on easy-to-do cardio moves----this workout included some weird ""skaters,"" more than the usual high impact jogging, bouncing and fist pumping, and not enough of her 4 main moves
-Her realistic group of walkers that look like women I know----I couldn't get past the glamour models in this shoot wearing false eyelashes to work out! These women were all conventionally stunning and though that may work for some, I much preferred Leslie's older videos where the women looked like they were all different shapes and sizes and like they actually did her workouts on their own time (these were clearly hired just for this video)
-A clear cut mileage system for tracking----Leslie doesn't mention miles here at all, so I don't know what my 30 minutes amounted to in terms of her older programs and challenges that are tracked in miles.
-Challenging workout----I also felt that for all its weird moves and ""fast"" pace, this workout was a lot easier than some of her older ones! That or I suddenly got a lot more fit overnight.

HUGE fan of Leslie, not a fan at all of this video. If you loved her old stuff you probably won't like this either. And even though I didn't do the Firm workout, I skimmed through it, and it seemed a little strange. You'd probably be better off doing a couple of heavy squats and deadlifts than doing all those mini moves.",1427241600,21,1570,4.528169014084507

5768856,4,B00D2UMHWO,"I have done some Leslie Sansone workouts throughout the years and while I liked them, I was never crazy about them.  However, this one I like a lot!  I used to be an intermediate exerciser but this past year, a chronic illness has prevented me from doing much of anything.  I really appreciate the simplicity of this workout and how I can feel I accomplished something without killing myself or being over extended.

The ""Burn 30"" (cardio workout) is definitely faster paced than I'm used to with Leslie and she does add some jogging and bouncing, but it's so easy to modify to your own level and pace that this would be just fine for beginners, or someone recovering from illness like me.  She holds light hand weights during this part too but again, that's optional.  You can make the cardio segment as tough or easy as you'd like.  After a brief warm-up you get into the workout which includes her famous side steps, hamstring curls, kicks, marching/jogging and knees up with a few skaters, cha cha's and bouncing in place added to the mix.  At the end, she does some squats and then there is a short stretch.

The ""Firm 30"" workout is more for beginners and slower paced, but a good total body workout.  The workout begins with a short warm up of marches, side to side, kicks and knees up and then it's on to squats!  There are lots of squats (wide legged, narrow legged and plies for the inner thighs), as well as lunges.  While Leslie only does a few actual lunges in place, the rest of the workout for the upper body is done in a lunge position.  For example, you will do back rows, tricep kickbacks, bicep curls, overhead presses, etc., all while in lunge position (she switches which leg is in the lunge for each upper body movement).  I actually like this because the whole workout works your lower half but if you have knee issues or just hate lunges, you can always do the upper body stuff standing.  She finishes the standing segment with some more squats and then it's on to the floor with chest presses/flies, abdominal work, bridge work for the backside and a movement for the lower back (I forget the name but you're on your knees for that one).

As I mentioned above, this has been just what I need for my current health needs.  You get a good workout and can still go on and enjoy your day, not feeling beat up but rather, energized!  I only gave it 4 stars because I felt the cool down in the strength workout was less than sufficient considering all the lower body work.  It's less than a minute of just lying on the floor in a full stretched out position.  There's nothing for the legs or any other part of the body.  I understand she had to fit in a lot in 30 minutes, but a few more stretches would have made this perfect.  I just do them on my own.",1426809600,6,2773,4.375

5768882,5,B00D2UMHWO,"I am overweight,  5'2 and over 253 pounds. I wanted to start working out, eat healthy and shed some of the weight, especially that of late i was starting to feel tired, no energy and very heavy. Being heavy it is sometimes impossible to keep up with some of the exercise DVDs out there, some of them are too difficult and too intense, they make you feel like a complete failure, but not Leslie Sansone's exercises. They might not be designed for those who want 6 packs and buffed muscles, but they definitely work to shape your body and give you the boost you need to start your weight loss program . I own a lot of her walking DVDs. I give this one a 5 star, i did it for 30 days as advised, and i lost 16 pounds. I also started eating healthy. I can feel the changes in my body and I also  feel stronger and fitter. I will take the 30 days challenge for another month and see where it takes me. I recommend this DVD for anyone who wants to start exercising and losing weight.

The DVD offers 2 exercise segments , burn 30 which includes her usual walk at home moves, Leslie uses 2 pounds weights through this exercise.
The second segment is firm 30, which is a combination of body sculpting exercises for upperand lower body using weights 5 - 8 pounds. The last 10 minutes or so are floor work for Abs and back.
You are supposed to alternate between the 2 segments , doing one each day for 6 days with one day off.",1425859200,55,1416,4.17948717948718

5768894,5,B00D2UMHWO,"Okay let me start off by saying I am not a ""fitness person"" I try to eat healthy-somewhat and I only workout when I get uncomfortable in my skin. Well, I'll be 36 years old in June I'm 5'7"" and I weigh 230 pounds! I am pear shaped so my curves look good when they are not disguised under the fat. I searched the internet high and low for a great workout that WAS NOT an hour long, too hard to follow and was jumping all over the place. I have purchased other DVD's by Leslie in the past and they were okay. This one is great! It is 30 minutes including the warmup. I get a good sweat going but I don't feel over exerted and I can still carry a conversation if needed. On Monday, WED, Friday you do cardio with four basic steps, on TUES, THURS, Sat you use weights. I will say you may feel like you aren't getting that ""vigorous workout"" but the next day when you use the restroom your leg muscles tell you differently. I am only on day 4 so I will give an update of the how it is going. If you are looking to get back in your workout routine this is great-if You don't care for the music mute the TV and listen to your own. It is worth a try I feel great and sleep great. I workout each day at 8:00 to 8:30pm using this DVD-and because it is 30 minutes I can squeeze it in.

5768941,5,B00D2UMHWO,"I've been a big fan of Leslie Sansone's Walking DVDs for some time now - they're not complicated, you can get your heart pumping and don't require a bunch of equipment. If you can walk, you can do her workout.

This new DVD is awesome! There are two things I REALLY love about this video:
1.  The 10 minute countdown. On those mornings when I'm not super motivated to exercise, I constantly look at the clock and when I see I've only gone 12 minutes, I'm bummed and have to really push myself to keep going. With this workout, a count down clock pops up at the 10 minute mark, and for sure you know you're on the downhill side. Now when I'm less than motivated, I know I only need to get to this point and I can make it through the entire 30 minutes. Maybe a little silly, but psychologically speaking, it really works for me!

2. You can listen to the work out with Leslie talking or music only. While I love her workouts, Ms. Sansone talks non-stop, and I find it to be a little grating. However, you may like her high-energy motivation, but it you don't you can do the workout to music only. With her other workouts I turn the sound completely off (this is how super manageable her workouts are - you don't need any explanation of complicated maneuvers).

The opposing workouts are a great idea, it makes a big difference to work different muscles each day. Doing the same thing over and over again only makes you more efficient at doing them, not necessarily building strength and stamina.

Lastly, Ms. Sansone has a variety of people doing the work out with her; super fit young women, men and even an older woman so you can model your workout based on your fitness level quite easily.",1421539200,2,1690,4.386581469648562

She also includes other moves such as kick backs and tap outs.  You can choose whether or not you want to use hand weights.  The second workout (Tues., Thurs., and Sat.) is a firming workout using dumbbells.  Leslie herself starts out using 5 pound dumbbells and then moves up to 8, but I chose to stick with 5 pounds.  The first part is arm exercises and then you move down to the floor for abdominal work.  Both workouts are easy to follow, but I found the second workout a little more difficult.

Again, this one does not fit the bill.  The moves are repetitive and boring (the SAME. OLD. MOVES.), the music is always awful and her goofy personality, while somewhat charming, can be annoying.  If you have no history of exercise or you're a senior (say, 65+), you might like it.  I much prefer Jane Fonda's workouts (Lean Routine is a favorite), which are now finally being released on DVD, and which you can adapt to your own fitness level.  Tracy Anderson is also a good choice for a varied and challenging workout that you can adapt to your own fitness level.

5768990,5,B00D2UMHWO,"I have used this dvd for about 2 months now and it is great.  I love the 30 minute workouts and they give you a lot of energy.  My suggestion is to workout early in the morning or day and not wait until after 6:00 to exercise because it gives you so much energy, I was waiting until I got home from work to exercise, normally between 6:30 and 7:30 but it took me a long time to get sleepy.  I don't know how much weight I've lost  but I feel much better and my clothes fit better.",1414800000,3,480,3.86734693877551
5768991,4,B00D2UMHWO,"Leslie's videos are always well done and effective.  However, this one seemed a little low energy.  Some of her videos I walk through feeling like the time has flown.  This one seemed to drag on even though it was only 30 minutes.  I did both sections in one session without a lot of difficulty.  I am 63 years old and exercise regularly but certainly not super athletic.  This was not that difficult.  I will continue using it but not one of her best.  I usually give all of her videos 5 stars but this one a little lacking!",1414800000,,525,4.285714285714286

The moves aren't complicated are hard to do. One part is for cardio, which you can do with or without weights, and the other part is for lean muscle toning, which you do with dumbbell weights. I highly recommend this DVD!",1414195200,,387,4.173333333333333

Monday, Wednesday, Friday...walk, walk, walk, and Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday you use weights along with walking so you get strength training (which we all need).  I bought several as my friends wanted it too and they think it is terrific, gets you walking and it won't be long before outside activities will cease!

I have had heart problems and my doctor wants me to walk daily, but the extreme heat this summer made going outside to exercise impossible. This was just the right amount of exercise to bring my muscle tone back and not make me sick.  I like being able to switch back and forth between the ""burn"" and the""tone"" programs.  The only thing that I don't like is hearing Leslie Sansone's chatter over and over again, but that can be turned off...just wish there was one more choice to have the instructions without the chatter, because I would like to hear the count and the instructions...just don't want to hear the giggles and the talk with the others helping her out--once was enough of that stuff.",1411084800,,802,4.405405405405405

That being said, on the days where i'm supposed to ""burn"" for 30 minutes, I switch to one of her older DVD's.  I don't feel like I get as much as a cardio work out with the burn 30 side of this DVD.  That being said, I love the ""Firm 30"" DVD side.

I have several of her DVDs and I was fine with them until I tried Jane's walking DVD.  I am only 50 so it isn't like I can't handle a tougher workout I just like the whole body incorporated more.  I alternate between them so I get what I need from my workout.  The DVDs that I am using now are the 30 Days and the Belly Blasting.  I will revisit her others to see if the shoulders and back are included more.

Overall, I guess it becomes a matter of taste and body needs.",1407801600,,565,4.090909090909091

I agree with the other reviewer, who stated this tape has great firming exercises but very poor cardio.  I found the same thing.

This workout is well planned out between 3 days of cardio and 3 days of strength training with 1 rest day.  I went out and bought some inexpensive hand weights and dumbbells from walmart.

The ONLY complaint I have about this video is the 30 minute strength training section. Its ok, but its almost TOO much leg work. I would say its almost a borderline bad workout that makes you extremely sore the next day without feeling like you got a good workout (if this makes any sense).

5769072,5,B00D2UMHWO,"I have several of Leslie's DVDs. I especially like this 30 Day Walk it Off because it divides the aerobic-cardio exercise into 3 days per week and the firm-burn the alternate 3 days per week. She has a pleasant voice and manner. She gives an alternate exercises for those who are not yet ready to do the more difficult one in a few of the more advanced exercises. This DVD, as well as her others work for beginners as well as the advanced. Recently restarting my healthy food and exercise program, I really appreciate how Leslie makes it possible to begin at the beginner's level and work up to the advanced level in the same exercise routines.

I did decide that I wanted to so cardio and strength building six days per week, so now use the Belly Blasting Walk DVD and have built up the endurance to finish the 2 Mile Walk plus, on the same DVD the strength-firming .2 sets. The floor exercises will start on their own without having to click on the start button. Handy. I highly recommend this woman's DVD's",1402012800,2,1009,4.454054054054054

5769077,2,B00D2UMHWO,"I was really looking forward to getting this DVD but it's quite a disappointment.

There are 2-30 minute workouts on this DVD with nothing much new added except that the strength training is a lot more in-depth than other DVD's in this series.

Speaking of the strength training component, there is little or no mention of proper breathing technique, while doing these exercises. As a former strength trainer myself, I think this is a big omission. For beginners, they may not be aware that you are suppose to exhale on the exertion part not the other way around. I'm surprised that this was missed, it's such a basic for strength training that IS important and should definitely be mentioned a few times during this kind of workout.

I also REALLY miss Leslie's ""old"" pals not being along for the exercises. Couldn't at least 1 or 2 of her regulars been along for this dvd?  She has the studio filled with ""20 something's"" now and that I think is a big mistake. I disliked the music in this one too.

One of the things I particularly liked about her earlier dvd's, was the emphasis on fitness being for EVERYONE. That she had walkers with her from a range of ages. And given Leslie's own age, I'm surprised and disappointed that she didn't keep this in mind, with this new DVD.

I probably will be passing this one along to our local library.

My fav is still: the Intensity Walk that features 3 workouts that are effective, fun and varied.

And these workout DO feature walkers from 20 year olds all the way to those in their 70's. That's more like it!!!",1401148800,8,1556,4.5321428571428575

5769107,4,B00D2UMHWO,"I purchased this video about a week or so ago. I was impressed as it is a much faster pace cardio compared
to her other videos. I have about 16 videos of hers. I enjoy her videos and Jillian Micheal's. I alternate using Leslie's
for mostly the cardio and JM for the weight training. I consider myself an intermediate exerciser and in decent
shape (5ft 4in, 115lbs) and I am 55 years young. As with all of Leslie's videos you can adjust the intensity to fit
your needs. If you want more intensity of course use the hand weights, but better yet just use larger moves. When she
does the skaters, use a jump motion and when she bounces, bounce longer if you want more intensity. I like the younger
participates she has. This video is a keeper and it does go pretty fast. I sometimes do the burn section two time in a row;
once with hand weights and once without. As far as her firm section. It is OK. I do a lot of weight lifting with Jillian MIcheal's
videos and I do a lot on my own. With Leslie there was no sense of organization. First of all we all know use your bigger
muscles before the smaller muscles. She does chest exercises towards the end after doing the small muscles of your
arm. If she was going to organize this weight lifting segment she would do Chest, Back, Legs, Shoulders, Arms, Abs. Also
it would be nice to give a minute or two instruction part saying what exercises she will be doing and when. Anyway, it is
a good cardio workout and the firm part is still OK.",1397865600,6,1481,4.25531914893617

I think beginners may find it challenging but it is guaranteed to make you work up a sweat.  I like that it targets every part of your body and Leslie is not as chatty and stays focussed on the workout.

I haven't don't the weights workout, just did the walking one this morning. I sweated more with this one than any of the others.

Leslie is her usual bouncy cheerful inspiring self.  I will say this...they use 2 lb hand weights during the Burn DVD which I wish they told at the beginning so I could get some.  Also, the pauses between the different songs bug me, it doesn't just flow from one beat to the next so there's moments of silence when you're walking.  I work up pretty good sweat but it's not overwhelming.  This is more high energy than her other workouts that I've done.  The Firm workout is good too.  There are a lot of squats and pressure on the legs when doing other bent over weight lifting moves for the back and shoulders.  Just go to your level then advance as you get stronger.  The weight lifting moves are very easy for the beginner to pick up.  In the DVD she uses 5 and 8 lbs but she says to lift to your level.  I love her floor exercises too....not just crunches but Pilates moves to work the abdomen and lower back.  I enjoyed this workout and I even bought my 55 yr old mom one and she loves it!

5769134,4,B00D2UMHWO,"I really like this DVD. The music is fresh and the moves are challenging. There are two different workouts on the DVD: the walking program, Burn 30, and the strength program, Firm 30. Leslie suggests doing them on alternating days for 30 days. Let's look at both segments:

Burn 30 is a fast-paced walk featuring several boosts, including hops, the cha-cha, and skaters, which really get the heart rate up, as well as a cool-down and quick stretch. One thing this program does not have that I wish it had are mile markers. I'd guess this walk is close to 2.5 miles, but that's just a guess. (This is one reason for my 4-star rating.) I enjoy the workout and it goes by quickly. After twenty minutes, a timer pops up in the corner counting down the last 10 minutes of the workout.

Firm 30 is the toning portion of the workout and calls for the use of  hand weights (I use 3 pounds). This program calls for a lot of lunges and squats, but you can definitely modify - a lot of the lunges are actually done while working the upper body. I injured my ACL a few years ago, so I have to be very careful with my knees, and this workout has not given me any problems at all. But do be aware of the legwork if you have knee trouble. After the legs and arms, there is about 10 minutes of floor work for the abs, obliques, and back end. Firm 30 is a challenging workout, especially if you're new to that type of exercise.

I do this workout a few times a week (about every other day), and I choose to do the entire DVD at once. I am really glad that Leslie has put out a workout like this that includes strength training. That type of exercise can be redundant, unexciting, and even intimidating, but Leslie makes it accessible and energizing. I do miss seeing some of the regular walkers, though, and I really wish there were mile markers. Overall, a great workout!",1396137600,11,1855,4.306590257879656

I'm a senior and I have to stop the DVD to rest in between a couple of the weight  training sets, and I can't do lunges because of an arthritic toe. And I have to omit a couple of floor exercises because neck problems. But I do what I can and I'm beginning to see results after only 2 weeks.  Thanks to Leslie for this DVD.

5769152,4,B00D2UMHWO,I have to say that I like most of her workouts they are easy to follow and she is not barking at you like Jullian Michaels is she tells you to work your way up to where they are. I have bought two more of her workouts and I have to say after I am done I can fell that i have worked out not over the top but good so I would recomend this workout to all my friends and family,1394755200,2,373,3.5609756097560976

5769155,5,B00D2UMHWO,I love the structure of this DVD and this is week 2 of using it and it works...as long as you are consistent. I like this better than some of her others dvd's as it is more intense and you can still vary your pace. Having the team working along behind her is a nice change as you can determine who's tempo you want to match.,1394668800,,324,3.9242424242424243
5769156,5,B00D2UMHWO,Ive been usually Leslies workout for a couple of years. First discovered her on the cable channels workout system and have been in love with the in home walks ever since. I have recently gained back some extra weight and have a crazy work schedule. I started using this DVD and i LOVE IT!... its a great pace im always sweaty and the frim section of it left me sore the first two days. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a workout that won't kill you but will leave you feeling great.,1394582400,,501,4.229166666666667

5769158,5,B00D2UMHWO,"I purchased this DVD because I like other DVDs by Leslie Sansone. I like this one more than some of the others. I like that you use it 6 days a week, alternating between cardio and strength training. I already had small dumbbells so I didn't need to purchase anything. This is probably not for a beginner/beginner, I would consider myself a beginner/intermediate, and I have been using this for more than a month and it still is a good workout! What's even better? I have lost 6 pounds :)",1394409600,,488,4.433333333333334

I love the change of pace from her other DVD's. It's a bit higher intensity, but any moves are modifiable, just in case. I often pop this in the player while my toddler sleeps, and get in some good exercise!",1394323200,,379,4.277777777777778

5769163,5,B00D2UMHWO,"If you like Leslie Sansone, you will love this DVD. I have used her tapes and eventually the DVD's for years. I don't love exercise in a group setting so her DVD's are great as you can do them at any time of the day at home. You don't need a lot of room either so that is an added bonus. She is easy to follow and her workouts can be adjusted for all age groups. This one is going to be one of my favorites and I plan to follow it for the 30 days as outlined alternating the 2 workouts as she suggests for 6 days a week. Because they are only 30 minutes, it would be easy for most people to work it into their routine. Some people say they don't like her chit chat. I love it as it keeps me motivated but if you don't, you can also do the workout with just the music. I also love her Walk to the Hits Party Songs and the Radio Remixes as the music is motivating and she incorporates HITT training. Those are a little longer workout, about 45 minutes.",1394064000,,950,3.9274611398963732

Now that my tapes are finally giving out, I decided to try a few new DVDS.  I've purchased some of her past weight tapes and they have a similar flair, but she adds a bit of pilates and floor work at the end of this one and she's doing more ""real"" weight lifting.  It's harder yet still easy enough for me to complete it.  Her walkers are very diverse, albeit most young and in shape, but it's nice to see the diversity.  The 30 minutes of just walking was not too hard or too easy and you can bump it up by using heavier weights or higher intensity.  I personally cannot do the bouncing moves, so I just jog lightly in place.  Overall I LOVE this new two-in-one format and it's easy for me to want to do it!!",1393977600,,871,4.052631578947368

5769173,5,B00D2UMHWO,I have walked with Leslie for over 10 years on and off and this is by far the best tape.  I love the moves and that it is not a long drawn out tape where you will get bored.

5769177,4,B00D2UMHWO,"However, whoever did her makeup in this video needs some instruction.

5769181,2,B00D2UMHWO,I am a big fan of Leslie but this is my least favorite workout. I think the cardio needs to be at least 45 minutes,1393113600,3,114,3.6
5769182,5,B00D2UMHWO,Leslie is my favorite.  Easy to follow Walk DVD.  I am always interested in her DVD's.  Recommended for the public interested in staying healthy.,1393113600,,145,4.958333333333333
5769183,5,B00D2UMHWO,"Let me set the stage here - growing up I wasn't into the one video of Leslie's I had tried (Advanced Walk Aerobics when her last name was Tommelleo) in the early 90's.  I was hooked on the Jane Fonda videos, mainly the earlier and more difficult videos like her first, the New Workout and Workout Challenge.  Jane's format stuck with me and it was nearly impossible to persuade me to try another instructor, aside from a few instances of Tae Bo mixed in.

Fast forward to 2014, at a much higher weight (300+ lbs).  Out of shape and need to get in gear.  I opt for the Walk Away the Pounds 1 and 2 Mile Walks.  A nice pace (not slow but not too fast, enough to get me sweating using the weights).  I liked her.  She was cheery, fun to listen to, and I felt accomplished finishing the video.  She provides mile markers to show your progress and it made me proud to have gotten 2, 3, 4 or 5 miles done in one session when I had aching walking on the street weeks prior just walking a few blocks.  I then grabbed three more of her DVDs, including the Ultimate 5 Day Walk Plan.  This was more energetic and faster-paced - a great program to go with that can be customized to almost any mile/toning combo you like.

Then I tried this one out.  And does it give you a heck of a workout.  The DVD has 2 programs - Burn 30 (aerobics) and Firm 30 (toning and sculpting).  The Burn includes the basic moves you have come to expect from her videos, plus some modified versions of side step and ""boosted walking"" - jogging, simply.  Leslie and some of the folks behind her use hand/wrist weights for added intensity.  But you won't feel intimidated - there are various walkers not picking up the pace as much, not using weights, doing less intense side steps/lunges/etc. You will do some squats in Burn 30, and prepare your thighs for quite a few sets of them in the Firm section.  Also - while the exercise 'class' uses a full size studio to do this program, this and many of her videos can be done with minimal space.  If you can't do double side-steps, do single side-steps and take them deeper.  There are days when I do this with the 2x4 space at the foot of my bed with the DVD playing in my laptop.  It's all about how intense you take the steps.  I also live in an apartment with a floor that can't hide much movement, but with the carpeting and wearing shoes, too much of a racket isn't made.

The plan this DVD is structured on is for users to do 'Burn' Mon/Wed/Fri, and Firm is done Tue/Thu/Sat.  I often find I do more of the 'Burn', as I enjoy the aerobics much more, but this is a great cardio/toning combination that will surely work with a sensible eating plan.

The DVD gives you the option to play the program with music & vocals or just music - a great option once you master it, and this program (and Ultimate 5 Day) has some great music to move to.

I've dropped 25+ so far this year using her videos and this is definitely my favorite.  I like the use of the weights in the aerobics, the music is enjoyable and it does make you sweat.  I will keep watch for more of her videos.",1392768000,11,3086,4.211243611584327

This video always warns you when you are about to change movements and I appreciate this.  I am a woman in my 50s and I find that I can do both the walk part and the firm part.  What bugs me? The smiles on the people working out with her.  I would love to see some expression that was more like ""this is hard"" instead of ""I love working out"" robotic smile.

Burn 30 is basically cardio, and it's meant to be done on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. The Firm 30 is meant to be done on Tuesday, Thursday, & Saturday. If you aren't too active, and just looking for some in home exercise you'll like this DVD. You can feel it every where in your body, and I love cardio...the only thing is I purchased another Walk DVD, because I was wanting more of a workout than this. I love doing these DVD's in the winter. This DVD is great if you're wanting to tone your body, and maintain ir lose a little bit of weight.

5769204,5,B00D2UMHWO,"I own a lot of Leslie Sansone's videos but I think this is my favorite. Two workouts, 30 minutes each. The first is cardio and it is not hard. If I can do it, anyone can. I don't like high impact and the highest she goes is a very light jog and it's not consuming in the video, just a minute or two. But don't get me wrong, these easy steps will make you sweat! And workout 2 uses 5lb. weights to do toning and firming. I can honestly say I'm in my 4th week of using this video and I've only lost a few pounds, but I have noticed, (and so had my husband) that I've lost inches. The first day w/ weights I was so sore I could barely sit or stand due to the squats. After that, it was easy and I've gotten a lot out of this workout. I feel stronger in my legs and back and my clothes fit better. I've also noticed that when I started I had a little bit of a hard time w/ the floorwork, (abs, crunches) but now it has gotten easier and my form has much improved. So not only have I lost a few pounds, I've lost inches as well. I will continue to use this DVD 5-6 times a week because I actually do see a difference.",1390867200,4,1112,3.8391304347826085

5769206,3,B00D2UMHWO,"I feel mislead by the other reviews that rave about what a great workout this is and how this workout ""is not for beginners.""  I have to disagree.  I think this would be a good start for someone very overweight that hasn't exerised in years.

I've been working out for only two weeks, using a variety of other workout videos and running on my own.  I found this one to be easiest by far.  As for the Burn 30 segment, I broke a sweat, but it wasn't very challenging. The stretching at the end was a bit pathetic.  As for the Firm  30, there didn't seem to be enough reptitions to make the muscles really feel it.  And the floor mat exercises were almost silly.

Overall, it's lacking the intensity I got from other workouts (like The 30 Day Shred with Jillian Michaels, and Basic Step with Kathy Kaehler). If it doesn't challenge you, it doesn't change you!

For your comparison: I'm 34 years old, weigh 155, trying to get to 130, been working out every day for 2 weeks.

***********UPDATE****************

I started doing the Burn 30 segment with ankle weights and/or while holding 5 pound weights. It was a much better workout.  And I started doing the Firm 30 segment with 10 pound weights, which was more of a challenge for me. And I do other ab exercises that I learned from harder workouts while she is doing the knee-hugging thing.

I've also found this is a good workout to do when I need something easier---e.g., when I have a cold, or it's that time of the month, or I need to recuperate from really high intensity workout done the day before.",1390521600,4,1552,4.438162544169611
5769207,5,B00D2UMHWO,Very good exercise video. I like the extra weight work after the walking. Leslie did a good job with this video. Very good workout and would tell other people it is really worth getting.,1390521600,,186,4.5
5769208,5,B00D2UMHWO,I really enjoyed this workout. I have only done the 30 min cardio session so far and I love it. It was fast paced and a little more challenging than the other Walk at Home dvd's that I have and I thought that was great! I was dripping sweat when I was done with the cardio session. It was also nice to see a variety of NEW and different walkers. I purposely seek out dvd's of hers with other walkers besides herself because it makes me feel like I'm attending a workout class at a gym lol. I'm excited to try the strength session I'm sure it is going to be equally as enjoyable and just as good.,1390262400,,595,4.0508474576271185
5769209,5,B00D2UMHWO,"Leslie has been my hero for the past few years, and this DVD is by far one of her best. It's quickly become my new favorite. In just two weeks, I've lost 5% of my waist size just by following her plan on the DVD and portion control. Crazy, right?? If you're willing to put the time in, which isn't much...30 minutes a day, you won't be sorry. Give it a go, folks! She's the best =)",1390176000,3,381,3.961038961038961
5769210,5,B00D2UMHWO,"I was a little hesitant to buy a walking tape.  I was really looking for a 30-minute strength training workout using light weights, so I bought it because of the Firm 30 segment.  But I was very excited by the Burn 30 workout (walking) segment.  Although she referred to it as walking (which I wasn't all that excited about), to me it was more of a fast-paced low impact aerobics (which I very much enjoyed)!  If it had been just 30 minutes of pure walking, I would have been bored. Since it was 30 minutes of basic low impact aerobics moves, it was definitely not boring and provided me with a great workout. The strength training (Firm 30) segment was basically what I was looking for. However, I would have preferred the abdominal portion to be standing using weights, rather than floor crunches.",1390176000,3,799,4.566433566433567
5769211,5,B00D2UMHWO,"I am enjoying this workout video.  I am beginning my third week, can't say I have lost weight, but I am toning. As Leslie says this is not sissy stuff, it gives a good workout.",1390176000,,176,4.0285714285714285
5769212,5,B00D2UMHWO,"These are fun workouts, they are effective and easy to do. I like them a lot, so I bought some for my friend who doesn't have a lot of free time. Fifteen minute miles - anyone can find the time for that!",1390003200,,203,3.857142857142857
5769213,5,B00D2UMHWO,I have a no. of Leslies DVD 's. I love them all. And above it all I love the peppy and energetic ways of Leslie. She's so motivating and joyful you watch. I have not exercised for a while now and am have made a new year resolution to resume exercise. This DVD is great Becos one can use it for a mere 30 mins if pressed for time. Pretty easy to do but relly gets ur calves burning. Her choreography is as simple and easy to follow as always. This is a nice upbeat one and I really like where she is headed with creating a more aerobics and toning program,1389830400,,554,3.955357142857143

When I don't want as ""intense"" of a workout as Jillian Michael's, this strength training section of this dvd is like a JM modified version.  Leslie hits all the major muscle groups and you do feel like you got a workout.  As I am getting older, my knees are starting to ache from running and doing the ""walk"" section of this dvd is really good - low impact and you can amp it up if you want. Leslie uses handweights and I did too and it was a good walking workout with some light jogging. I would recommend this dvd.",1389744000,3,636,4.146341463414634

5769218,5,B00D2UMHWO,"A lot of people tend to write Leslie off as some kind of lightweight, and for super athletic types, that's probably true. But for the average person who needs some exercise and to drop some pounds, she offers a very accessible, doable, enjoyable and effective alternative to the Jillian Michaels of the world. I know people who have lost lots of weight doing these videos, and unlike the really ""vicious"" workouts out there, you might actually do Leslie's on a regular basis.

As for this particular one, it's great because it's only 1/2 hour. The intensity of the cardio portion is a little higher than many of Leslie's previous workouts, especially if you add hand weights. The weight workout seemed ridiculously easy to me at first, so I used heavier weights...and lo and behold I am totally challenged by it now. It's fun, effective, enjoyable, and CHEAP. What's not to like? If you have knee problems (I have some of that) you can modify anything too bouncy.

Another one that I love is the ""5 Really Big Miles"" workout.",1389398400,12,1025,4.720670391061453
5769219,5,B00D2UMHWO,"I love working out with Leslie Sansone -- she has put out a LOT of low-impact walking workouts, and she makes getting up and exercising easy and unintimidating!

5769221,5,B00D2UMHWO,I've seen other reviews when people are annoyed by Leslie and her energy.  Who cares!  If you want to lose some weight get moving that is the best thing for you.  I lost 25 lbs due to exercising and diet (no diet fads or pills) and Leslie Sansone 1 mile walk.  I like this walk because it only takes 30 minutes for firming or burning. And it's not difficult to follow along.,1388966400,4,374,4.152777777777778
5769222,5,B00D2UMHWO,"Always happy to see a new Leslie Sansone walking tape since that is what most of my exercise consists of. Always happy to see new twists to her regular steps, too.",1388707200,,163,4.290322580645161
5769223,4,B00D2UMHWO,"My husband got me this for Xmas (at my request).  I usually exercise 6 days a week, trying to do 3 days of cardio and 3 days of weights.  I usually do more advanced weight lifting workouts (mostly Cathe Friedrich), but sometimes I like something a little easier.  For cardio, I usually use my elliptical and rowing machine or walk outside, but I like a little variety and have around 10 of Leslie's WATP workouts.

BURN:  This is probably the best Leslie workout I have, it goes quickly and has more moves in it than the usual four.  There was plenty of variety for me, but nothing was too complex.  There is a ""music only"" option, which is great for the times when I am not in the mood for Leslie's chattiness.  There is no counting of miles, but a clock does pop up when there is 10 minutes left (as it does in the FIRM workout).

FIRM:  This was a bit of a mess.  For lower body there are squats, pile squats, bridges and lunges.  She also includes all the upper body muscles, but there is more back, chest and biceps than shoulders and triceps.  My biggest problem is that she doesn't count reps, which is fine when doing squats, but NOT GOOD when doing one arm rows or lunges.  She also does one-arm rows transitioning into tricep kickbacks using the same 5 pound weight, which is crazy to use the same weight for those!  I used 15 pounds for the rows and 7 pounds for the triceps (and I counted myself to keep the reps even).  It ends with some ab work, basic crunches and a few pilates moves.

Overall, I doubt I will do the FIRM again, but I will be using the BURN, it was pretty fun.",1388620800,3,1592,4.235880398671096
5769224,5,B00D2UMHWO,"I think this is one of my favorite of Leslie's workouts. I like the way she has two sections of the dvd at 30 minutes a piece. This enables me to do a short workout when I need it.  What is the best though, is that one of the sections focuses on cardio and you can use weights if you want to. On other days, you can choose the section that focuses solely on strength training. I love this feature because I like that Leslie has added dumbbells to help build strength in the arms, chest, back and lower body. She also does some challenging ab work.  Great dvd!",1388534400,,559,4.1192660550458715
5769225,5,B00D2UMHWO,"I got this expecting a typical Leslie walk it off workout...and in a lot of ways it is...She has a 30 min walking workout and a 30 min firming workout on it. The walking workout is a typical Leslie walking workout...she uses some newer moves like ""The Skater"" and stuff which I really enjoyed. The firming workout is actually alot more intense than I thought it would be...it actually wore me out (in a good way) and usually Leslie's stuff doesn't do that...",1388534400,,458,4.530120481927711

5769230,5,B00D2UMHWO,"I checked out all the exercise DVD's available at my local library and, after watching them,  chose to puchase Leslie Sansone's JUST WALK IT OFF IN 30 DAYS.

I am a 72-year old male, 6'2"", who has lost sixty pounds or more following Dr. Joel Fuhrman's recommendations in his book EAT TO LIVE. I need to lose an additional 20 pounds to reach my ideal Body-Mass-Index weight. I needed to step up my exercise program.

I chose Ms. Leslie's DVD for a number of reasons. One very important reason is that you don't have to sit through ten minutes of advertising before beginning a workout! You just boot the DVD and press ""PLAY."" Another important reason is that you don't have to learn any complicated choreography: the movements are basic. The workout can be more or less vigorous, depending on your current state of fitness; there is room for improvisation; it does not matter if you are ""out of step""; the two half-hour workouts can fit into various niches of your daily routine; the workouts both burn calories and strengthen muscles. Finally, Ms. Leslie's ""students"" are a nice mix of racial types, sex, and age; it is pleasant to exercise at home while beholding this group of beautiful, bright-shining people.",1388188800,23,1212,4.761904761904762

Both are 30 minutes in length, so it's easy to do one session before heading to work. If there's more time, a person could do both workouts back-to-back. I started these workouts a few weeks ago when I can squeeze them in and am feeling stronger and seeing results (i.e. toned arms). The sessions are meant to be alternated, cardio one day and toning the next. I've found all of the moves to be easy enough to accomplish yet challenging enough for my fitness level (I do try to work out about 30 minutes each day).",1387843200,,616,4.3652173913043475

The Firm 30 video does require extra equipment, but it's only hand weights. When I first started using weights in my workouts, I just grabbed a couple one-pound cans out of the kitchen cupboard. I'm sure Leslie would have approved because she's both motivating and forgiving. With Leslie Sansone's videos you will never feel like you're being browbeaten by some Marine drill sergeant. She encourages you to give it your best, and you really can intensify her workouts as much as you want. On the other hand, these are so simple that you can't do it wrong. No unnatural postures or movements, nothing fancy, nothing that can't be varied to suit your own fitness level or mood. And if there's anything you really can't do for whatever reason, do what Leslie says: Just Walk!",1386633600,,949,4.72289156626506

This DVD, like several others I have, has the option of Music Only.  I wish ALL her DVDs have this option because really I get very tired of hearing here ceaseless Chit-Chat while I walk and believe me I do walk with her a lot. The Music is ok, better than some for sure.  Now I like this DVD.  It is 2 segments.  The first is a half hour of walking - no mile breaks-no change of walkers - just 30 minutes of standard Leslie walking.  Its the only DVD I have that just goes 30 minutes straight of walking.  I like that for a change.  The second segment has Free Weights, and I have never had this on one of her DVDs before.  Sure lots of stretchy bands, but this 30 minutes segment features Free Weights and a real muscle workout - with some walking.  I like that a lot.

5769248,5,B00D2UMHWO,"Excellent DVD.

If you're familiar with Leslie's work this is a bit more intense than most of them.  In 30 minutes exactly, you get a significant low impact workout.  One day is burn which has more aerobic content and is done with 2 pound hand weights.  I use 3 pound hand weights and really enjoy it.  The other day is firm 30 which is 30 days of strength training.  What I like about it is she warms us up with some ""boosted walking"" close to the beginning and then does a nice routine for exactly 30 minutes that works all parts of your body.

It's well choreographed, easy to do and is exactly 30 minutes.  It is my favorite dvd of hers ever and I have been a fan for many years.",1385164800,3,683,4.121212121212121

No way could I alternate these workouts daily and do them 6 days a week as suggested. The strength training workout made me so sore I could hardly move for 3 days, much less work out. I'm glad to see Leslie has cranked it up a notch! My suggestion is to start slow with this one.",1384905600,,397,4.102564102564102
5769251,5,B00D2UMHWO,"Walk It Off in 30 Days has two good workouts to get your exercise regimen started.  I would rate these workouts for a beginner who has worked up to walking at least 1 mile with Leslie or has done some light exercises for a period of time.  I used these workouts to restart my workout routine after a few months of a on/off sedentary lifestyle  I regained the confidence and ability to stick to 30 minutes of exercise and it was truly easy because these workouts are fun, easy on the knees and go by so quickly.

I lost 1lb the first week.  I carefully watched my caloric intake (I'm 5'1"", in my 20s) and ate about 1,600 cals a day.  The following weeks I didn't see the scale move anymore but I believe I got a little sloppy with the eating intake so that can account for why the scale didn't move.

The cardio portion is vigorous and you can tell by the group of people working out with her that they are serious about staying fit. You move very quickly through the series of moves she uses in all of her dvds with a new twist on one of them. If you want, which I do, you can use 2 pound hand weights.  Before you know it, the session is over.  I don't alternate days between the cardio and the weights as she suggests.  After I'm done with the cardio, I move on to the weights.  In this section, you use 5 pound free weights. Lots of squats (ugh) and then on to upper body.  Again, the session moves quickly.  I really like this workout, because she gears it for the seasoned viewer.",1384819200,,773,4.1824324324324325

5769254,5,B00D2UMHWO,"Can't say enough about how amazing this DVD is.  It is fast paced and you get the results you are looking for.  I not only bought a copy for me, but I got a copy for some friends as well.  It came in the mail on the same day I was leaving for vacation (I was praying that it would).  So my friends and family used it the entire week that we were on vacation.  We had a blast.  I must say, the first week I used it, I worked muscles I didn't know that existed in my body, which was a good thing and I still use even though the 30 days are up.  You will have so much fun with this one.  She has you doing the Cha Cha and double tap outs and you name it, you do it, and then you have the lean 30.  I didn't think I was going to be able to do it, but I used five pounds weights the entire time and my arms are looking great.  So I encourage you to get this one and Step, Step and Run Run Run with Leslie Sansone and the gang.  It's amazing and it is a great DVD to add to your collection.  If you are looking for something fun and fast paced, this is it.",1384732800,3,1050,3.6591928251121075

5769260,5,B00D2UMHWO,I am in love with this workout. I stumbled upon Leslie via some youtube workouts and loved that they were simple and I could do it inside when the weather was crap. These 2 workouts get it done. I love the variety of people working out. I love the simplicity with option to make bigger movements/burn more. The strength training one gets all the jiggley bits. Love that they are 30 min. and between the 2 get the job done.,1384041600,,422,4.2875
5769261,5,B00D2UMHWO,The walking portion is a great morning workout. I do this at my office before anyone else come to work or I can do it on my lunch.  It's a good afternoon pick me up for people who sit most or all day.  I have not done the weight workout yet but I hope to over the weekends. I have been a fan for a while as these come in handy when you don't have a lot of time or the weather does not permit me to be outside.,1383868800,,409,3.5842696629213484

5769267,5,B00D2UMHWO,"This is a great DVD! It is broken into two sections. The first is a 30 minute aerobic workout that is fast paced and upbeat. Leslie ""tweaks"" some of her classic moves (walking, sidestep, knee-lift and kick). I have gotten a good workout from it. The second section is also 30 minutes but it has a strength training focus using hand weights. She starts this session with an aerobic warm-up and then works into doing strength training - standing. When this is complete she works into strength training on a mat. This too, gave me a good workout. Leslie's recommendation is to do the aerobic sections Monday, Wednesday and Friday and the Strength training, Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, taking Sunday's off.",1383350400,,706,4.8429752066115705

5769276,5,B00D2UMHWO,I have been using Leslie Sansone's work out tapes since they were on VHS. I have many of her workouts but I think this one is my favorite so far.  She packs so much into 30 minutes until it's incredible.  The every other day routines are programmed perfectly.  She even advises about the different weights you should use once you progress.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to get in shape in 30 minutes.,1382486400,,418,4.3896103896103895

The 30 minute walk has some new steps which I like, and some new music which is refreshing. The 30 minute toning is very good.  I didn't realize how out of shape my muscles were!  I felt a little stiff the day after I did this the first time, then the next day..wow, my thigh muscles were SORE! I waited  a week before I did the toning again and that time it felt like I worked my muscles but not nearly as bad as before. Great workout! Keep 'em coming!",1382227200,,542,4.084905660377358

5769281,5,B00D2UMHWO,"I was skeptical about this workout -I generally prefer a 4 mile length, so wasn't sure this would be ""enough"". I was pleasantly surprised. In the Walk portion, the pace is very brisk, the cast is young so pushes me to go bigger in my moves. Most use weights during this portion  & that adds to the intensity. There is an older walker doing very modified versions of the moves, I'm sure to show all fitness levels can do this. The firm section relies heavily on squats. There is also good arm firming, again with weights. There are floor exercises which I tend to modify as crunches etc put too much strain on my neck. I have done the workout as designed, 3times a week each for walking & firming and also as one longer workout. Either way, I am glad to have in my collection!",1381622400,,775,4.308219178082192

5769283,4,B00D2UMHWO,"To be fair, I have not gone through the strength portion of this DVD so I can't comment on that. I was pleasantly surprised by the cardio portion though. Most of Leslie's videos are not intended for advanced exercisers (even for our ""off days""), but the pace for this walk was much quicker than what I have previously experienced. I like her 5 Fat Burning Miles video because it delivered a faster pace throughout the entire video, not just for a mile or so. This is Leslie on Red Bull! I like the faster pace and it made me sweat, even at the much shorter time frame. (I typically use 2 or 3 lb hand weights throughout her walking workouts.) As someone who exercises regularly at much higher intensity levels, this is going to be a very nice addition to my ""off day"" DVD rotation.

UPDATE (10/15/2013): I thought I would update my initial review since I have now completed the ""Firm"" (aka Strength) portion of the DVD. I actually did the Firm segment immediately after the Cardio segment, and I enjoyed it. It didn't tire me out but I definitely felt like I worked out. The exercises are very basic and easy to follow, but they are effective if done properly. That pretty much keeps the philosophy of her walking workouts -- nothing complicated. I liked that she had a brief, but fast paced, cardio warm up at the beginning. There are lots of squats and lunge positions; upper body work  is done from a ""lean-forward"" lunge position. The floor work includes chest and core exercises. Again, simple and traditional moves. All in all, this is my favorite Leslie Sansone DVD (although I only have about 3 others), and I would recommend to anyone looking for a ""more complete"" Leslie Sansone workout.",1381536000,,1697,4.597359735973598
5769284,3,B00D2UMHWO,I loved the first part. But the lifting the weights was too slow for me. It needed to be a little more upbeat.,1381536000,,110,3.8260869565217392
5769285,3,B00D2UMHWO,"I have been a fan of Leslie for about 17 years but many times I need a more intense workout. The cardio segment of this one fit that bill especially on days when I am pressed for time. It is a good, sweaty, heart pumping workout. It is even better using a weighted belt as well as the hand or wrist weights.
However I am a bit disappointed in the weight bearing portion. It was decent but I feel she put too much stress on the hips and shoulders and not enough biceps and triceps. Also the stretch at the end left much to be desired. I will still use it and adapt it to my needs.
I wish I could find one of her original workouts called Firm Up Fast. I did that one frequently for several years a while back but have since lost it and cannot find another copy. It is an excellent basic workout with weights.",1381363200,3,806,4.04375
5769286,3,B00D2UMHWO,"I have been walking with Leslie for about 10 years now on and off, but regularly for the past 4 months in which time I have lost about 30lbs, 2 pant sizes and went down in bra sizes as well...this is not one of my favorite videos from her at all.

Cardio: I do like a few things from it...the double knee lift, the double tap out, the using the weights, and I like the jumping but HATE the fist pump part of the jump...puke.  As for the remainder of the work out to me it is not as intense as some of her other videos, the belly blasting video has me breathing hard after about 5 minutes and sweating in about 10, this one I don't even break a sweat. I basically have to jog the whole time to feel like I am getting decent cardio. The music is horrible.  I think I am going to stick to other videos for the cardio part.

Strength:  I LOVE this portion!!!!  My legs were killing me for days!!!!  I have started out with very light weights, but plan on moving up to higher weights soon so I am sure my arms will kill me when I move up.  I think I sweat more in this portion than I do in the cardio part.",1381363200,40,1101,3.9279279279279278

This is a GREAT workout and I've been working out with Leslie for about 19 years now, but this one is off the hook!!!",1381276800,,295,3.9166666666666665
5769289,5,B00D2UMHWO,I have over 20 of Leslie Sansone videos. I have a lot I love and some I do not care for. I am always looking for something new and challenging from her.  This is it!  There are no miles it is just a 30min workout with some new moves. The con to me is she goes from working out hard to not enough cool down to get my HR down before going to the stretch. So I pause it and walk til my HR comes back down then go the the stretch. The Firm session was awesome made me sweat and brought my HR up. Con here is that you work a lot of muscle and I don't think that there is enough stretching after. Overall I think it is a great Workout and I am so glad I bought it. If you are looking for something new and fun this is totally worth it.,1381190400,,729,3.696774193548387
5769290,5,B00D2UMHWO,I have about 10 Leslie Sansone videos. When I first tried this video I didn't like it because of some of the new moves. Now I LOVE IT! I especially love the skater step. I love the work out with weights. I hope Leslie makes more videos with free weights.,1381190400,11,254,4.1

5769294,5,B00D2UMHWO,"I just started this today - borrowed from library, so I have only done the Burn 30 Workout.  It was fun!  I am sweating!  The music starts out as elevator music but it works for the warm up, and then it goes in to some fun music which you just can't help but ""cha cha cha"" and bounce, bounce, bounce to.  I enjoy the skater slide, felt it in my thighs and will probably feel tomorrow.  I enjoy the cha cha cha and the bounce bounce bounce - they work with this workout.

Leslie is so upbeat and happy to be moving.  There are a variety of ages here and a few men, which is nice to see them sweat to something they may have thought was simple.

The last 10 minutes, a clock appears as a countdown.  At the 3 minute mark she starts doing squats.  Now normally, I won't do these during a high paced walk - but this is during the cool down.  So I did them and I was fine with them.  She maybe only did them twice between slow walking.

One reviewer mentioned an older lady, in back, not being able to keep up.  I don't see it that way.  I see someone who did this low impact and she kept moving even if she didn't do the bouncing or the skater moves, she walked  - she kept moving.  That is what these motivational DVDs are for, to show everyone, no matter their size or condition, to at least - Try.

I'm going to do the Firm 30 next - I have a feeling I'm going to buy this one.  See my other reviews, I'm picky - I pick favorites and compare all others.

There is a water stain on the floor that was bugging me because the camera kept going to it.  LOL!  I kept trying to see if it was a design and what was it.  LOL!",1380844800,,1616,3.919753086419753

- Introduction to the DVD
- Burn 30 Workout (with or without music ) 30 mins
- Firm 30 Workout (with or without music) 30 mins

******Burn 30 Workout******
This consist of high-intensity aerobics. They are NOT miles. This is just a full blunt workout for 30 minutes. The major moves consist of bouncing with a fist pump in the air, jogging, the run-run-run, and a new move called 'skater' where you combine side step with a foot behind the other. You can use hand-weights if you want.

  PROS

- Clock: The clock does show up, but only when 10 minutes remain in the workout and it stays until the end. I guess there's really no need for a clock. We all know how long the workout lasts.

- Key execution movies: Leslie is excellent when executing her moves. She does not surprise you or switch legs

- Music: The music is great. It forces you to be on key becuase the beat is very catchy. When you first do it, it may not seem like the music reaches out to you, but you have to give yourself a chance to get used to it. The music makes me feel young. The last song before the cool down is THE JAM! It makes you feel like you're on this serious mission. :p

- Her Friends: All are like college-based age with one woman being Leslie's age (just guessing) and then a much older woman is in the back. I felt sorry for the older woman in the back. This workout was clearly not within her abilities. She could not keep up entirely. One other thing about them is that to Leslie's left (right side of the screen) are two women that are using weight. These women are like robots! They motivate me to push myself. There was one time I was tired of holding the weights, but when the scene switched to them still carrying it, I picked mines back up.

  CONS

- None

*******Firm 30 Workout*******
This consist if toning your arms, thighs, stomach, and butt. The first part is a warm up with some brief jogging. You get right to work with squats of wide legs and legs close together. There is A LOT of squatting and lunges. I cannot stand lunges. So, I just substitute them with more squats. You'll do some lunge stances in position and then work on the arms. She'll rotate legs, but it gets you tired quick.

I normally do not like floor work, but when it's with Leslie I'm more confident about it. One the floor, she'll start with the weights raised high over your chest and then tell you to bring your elbows out and in. Then she'll do chest raises with the weights. She'll then work hard on the stomach with the little crunches. The stretch is pretty short but involves leaning on one need with the opposite hand pointing out, and the last stretch is on your back with your arms over your head laying FLAT out.

  PROS

- Clock: By the time you get on the floor the clock will appear and remain for the last 10 minutes.

- You'll get a very good workout for the legs, especially when she gets you to lean in the lunge stance while doing the arm workout.

  CONS (VERY minor cons)

- The music for this session is very nice. But the second (and last) song repeats 3 to 4 times in a row. This last song actually makes you feel like you're on a fancy beach somewhere in another country. It's really nice, but it can get old after a while. I usually have a big ear for music.

- As soon as she says that you've finished the standing workout, QUICKLY get out that yoga mat, becuase she does not give you enough time to set that up. So either have already in place or close by.

- I felt like the arm session was not competitive enough, but that could be due to the pounds I had. I only had 2 to 5 pounds. I would upgrade it to 6 or 7 pounds

****OTHER INFO*****
I did the workout as suggested, doing them everyday. For the Burn 30, I burned between 188-205 calories. For Firm 30 I burned 89-92 calories.

Because this workout is set up for 30-day challenge, having it only motivates me to actually do it everyday. That's the plus side of having it.",1380412800,10,3950,4.230666666666667
5769297,5,B00D2UMHWO,"I got my Walk It off dvd last week, and I pre-ordered a set of 2,3,& 5 pound weights which arrived just before the dvd.
I started the work out routine on Monday for the cardio, whew, just made it through!! I had been using the 5 day dvd prior so I was familiar with the moves. Tuesday was very hard with the firm 30, I never did squats or rolls before since the 60's basic training in the Army. On Friday the cardio routine was much better, I think some of it is mental. And this morning (saturday), I did the firm routine for the 3rd time and it was much easier. This soon to be 73 year old man is now a happy camper!!!!!  But although I have 24 days to complete the cycle, I feel good at this juncture.",1380326400,3,704,3.9577464788732395

5769299,4,B00D2UMHWO,"I just started doing the Walk it Off in 30 Days. I got the box set from Walmart. It was about $25 it came with the 30 day video and two other videos Walk 4 mi and Walk 5 mi. It also came with a calender and it lists what video your supposed to do daily. Along with a meal plan for 30 days. I haven't quite started the meal plan yet but I'm on Weight Watchers. I love Leslie Sansone, I have the Really Big 5 mi dvd with the stretch band that I use a lot. So I thought I would try this new one. I do like it. Although, no offense but the cardio section is pretty easy/boring for me but I am going to stick with it. I was excited that it was going to be harder and have new music which it does but in my opinion I think it needs to have like more now a days music. There are some new moves (the fist pump (which I love), the sliders, squats) which do add more of a variety which I like.

Now, the Firm section of this video I absolutely LOVE. It is my favorite part. It works all of your muscles and it was hard. I enjoyed it better then the cardio part. It went pretty fast and I was sore today from it. It does have a lot of squats though, so if you have bad knees you may want to do the easier version of the squats. It was hard for me for all the squats and lunges the standing part of it, but I could feel the burn. Then you go to the floor part of it. I liked all the ab moves.

Overall, it is pretty good. I do think that the 30 Day Cardio version should be a little more harder. But I do workout to Jillian Michaels on my days that I don't do Leslie's DVDs. Lol. But it was pretty good and worth the buy. I'll update in 30 days to see if I have lost anything.:))",1380153600,,1667,3.7329545454545454

First of all I really like that a) it's only a 30 minute workout and b) the use of the weights.  It is as challenging as you want it to be depending on the weight lbs. and the effort you put into it.  I use 2lb hand weights and switch off and on with additional weights during the ""Burn"" section.  And I have progressed quite a bit with the weights for the ""Firm"" section as well.  While I have not lost weight (and I have  probably 50lbs to lose).  I have noticed that I have really firmed up in areas.

5769307,5,B00D2UMHWO,It's nice to have a new workout from Leslie! I love her videos and this one is pretty good I would recommend it,1379721600,,111,3.869565217391304
5769308,5,B00D2UMHWO,"I love the alternating cardio and strength training workouts. I also love that it is packed into 30 minute workouts. Now I have no excuse not to workout! I can always find 30 minutes! I lost 4lbs. and 5 inches in the 30 days, which broke my 4 month long weightloss plateau I was on! I love working out with Leslie!",1379721600,3,314,4.163934426229508

It is fun to do, no complicated dance moves or choreography, yet it's still challenging enough to make me sweat.",1379721600,,264,3.981132075471698
5769310,5,B00D2UMHWO,I like Leslie because the moves in the workout are easy.  This one is energetic and effective and is only 30 minutes.,1379635200,,117,4.318181818181818
5769311,5,B00D2UMHWO,Leslie's walking tapes are always great. We do a wellness break at work which is 30 mins and this tape is perfect for a quick workout that burns calories and builds lean muscle. You get out of the tape what you put in to it meaning you control the burn. I totally recommend for all exercise level!,1379635200,,297,4.228070175438597
5769312,4,B00D2UMHWO,"NOTE:  I received a free copy of this DVD to review for the web site Metapsychology Online Reviews; please see that site for a more detailed version of my review.

In this video, instructor Leslie Sansone adds a strength-training component to her usual aerobic walk.  Walk It Off in 30 Days is designed to be a ""specific plan"" that is used for 30 days.  Sansone suggests using the walk segment of the program on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays and the strength segment section on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays (presumably, Sundays are a rest day).

The Main Menu for this DVD reads as follows:  Introduction to the 30 Day Plan--Burn 30 Workout (Play/Play with Music Only)--Firm 30 Workout (Play/Play with Music Only).  For both workout routines, Sansone teaches live in a large, bright studio with about ten different background exercises.  Dumbbells and a mat are needed for the strength routine.  Each workout is described briefly below.

BURN

This is the cardio workout, and it is fairly typical of most of Sansone's walking routines, if perhaps a bit more upbeat overall.  Sansone and a few of the other background exercisers use 2-pound hand weights throughout.  It begins with a 5-minute warm-up, and as Sansone usually does, she introduces her basic walking moves, including the walk (actually a march), knees up, hamstring curls, side steps, tap outs, front kicks, and the addition of a cha-cha.  Some of the new moves included in this workout are transitioning from the side-to-side step into a skater (adding a small hop if desired) and a bouncing move with fist pump.  At the 25-minute mark, Sansone starts to bring the heart rate back down, and she concludes the routine with approximately 2 minutes of cool-down moves.

FIRM

The strength routine begins with an aerobic-style warm-up.  This includes Sansone's typical walking moves, plus a bit of impact with some light jogs.  Using 5-pound weights for the strength work, Sansone starts with squats, performing each move slowly and deliberately but also doing several different variations, including close stance, wide stance, pli&eacute; squat, and squat with overhead press, followed by a static lunge on both sides.  Moving on to the upper body, Sansone works her way through single arm rows, one-arm tricep kick-backs, double arm rows, reverse flies, bicep curls, overhead presses, and then alternating bicep curls.  She concludes the standing work with a final set of squats.  At the 20-minute mark, Sansone transitions to the floor for chest flies and chest press.  Next comes core work, which includes an abs crunch while holding one dumbbell, additional crunch variations, a short version of the Pilates 100, and then bird-dog on hands and knees.  For a final stretch, Sansone returns to her back and stretches out flat for about 30 seconds--that's it.

Sansone has a friendly, chatty personally that will be immensely appealing to many, but others may be a bit put off, especially during the strength workout, which has frequent pauses between sets to accommodate Sansone's chatter.  However, this video definitely delivers what it promises--i.e., an option to engage in cardio and strength training on alternate days.  For those looking for an easy-to-follow program, this DVD would be ideal; the level of the workouts are easy to modify, making it appropriate for beginners to low intermediate exercisers.",1379635200,,3386,5.153846153846154
5769313,5,B00D2UMHWO,Of course there are the old moves. There are some new moves such as skaters. The first segment was a fast paced 30 minute segment that got my heart rate up and sweating. It was nice to have the walk clock when you were getting close to done. The toning segment did leave me feeling worked out. I just wish the walking was longer and the toning a little less annoying. Leslie says every move you make. There is no reason to say row over and over for what feels like fifty times.,1379635200,,477,4.139784946236559
5769314,5,B00D2UMHWO,"It is a really good workout! Is not for everyone, cause is hard, but doable. Thank you Leslie for all these wonderfull videos.",1379548800,,126,4.521739130434782
5769315,5,B00D2UMHWO,"I own many of Leslie Sansone's DVDs and this is another great walking video that I can actually do. Not too hard, not too easy.",1379548800,,127,4.12
5769316,4,B00D2UMHWO,"I think Leslie is great.  Her classes are safe and sound in every way.  I think she needs some better music and more ab exercises, as most people need them.  I use this cd almost every day.",1379462400,,189,4.054054054054054
5769317,1,B00D2UMHWO,Hello I never got to use the dv as its not suitable for Australia it won't play in my dv recorder,1379376000,,97,3.6666666666666665
5769318,4,B00D2UMHWO,"As other reviewers stated, this workout starts fast and doesn't quit till the very end when you stretch. I was sweating towards the end of the warm up, which I was happy about. I have done Leslie's DVDs on and off for the past 3 years, and this one is quite a departure from her past DVDs. The music and studio are very modern, which I can't decide if I like. Leslie is as perky as ever, but it certainly seems that this workout is aiming for the younger demographic. Not that I'm old - I'm 29. But, one of the things I love about Leslie's other DVDs is her genuine nature and the ""walking with friends"" atmosphere she creates. She always says she just called up her friends to come work out that day, and it really seems that way. This one definitely had a more structured, stylized feel, more Hollywood for lack of a better word. The walkers seemed to be fitness models who were hired specifically for this DVD, instead of the regulars from her past DVDs who were her friends and employees. I am not saying there is anything wrong with this at all, it just was very different from the Leslie DVDs I am used to.

But the workout - the workout was good. As I said, I got very sweaty, and I loved that it was only 30 minutes. It was very easy to squeeze in while my husband was putting the kids to bed. I absolutely plan to do the 30 day plan. I've already lost 15 lbs with Weight Watchers and Leslie DVDs in 12 weeks, so I'm excited to see what happens with this challenge. I will update this review after I do the Firm 30. I'm hoping it's feasible for me, I haven't done any toning work and I'm a bit nervous after seeing how challenging the Burn 30 was. (I could do the steps no problem, but if this had been my first walking DVD, it would have been more difficult.)

EDIT: After doing the suggested routine of MWF Burn and TThSa Firm for 2.5 weeks, I am back to update my review. I have gotten used to the different feel of this DVD, and so far I am actually quite happy with it. My legs absolutely killed for the first week, which I was thrilled with. At first blush, the Firm portion seemed too easy, but then I made sure to carefully watch Leslie and the other ""walkers"" to make sure my form was correct, and sure enough, I was doing most moves incorrectly or without enough energy/focus on the areas each move targeted. I can already see a difference in my arms, and my husband notices too. I can feel myself getting stronger from this DVD, and I still love how easy it is to squeeze the 30 minutes into my day. I am excited to see the results at the end of this challenge!",1379289600,8,2580,4.178714859437751
5769319,5,B00D2UMHWO,I like Lesley's workouts. They get me up and moving without having to get dressed and out of the house. This is more exercise than her other CD's so I really do work up a sweat.,1379289600,,177,3.9444444444444446

5769321,5,B00D2UMHWO,"This DVD is really great! I have been looking for a way to get in strength training and Leslie helps me do it with this DVD. The walk is quick and effective. She even gives you a schedule for when to do each part. I love Leslie DVD's and this one is really good. New steps, very quick and easy to get in each day.",1379289600,,313,3.830769230769231
5769322,5,B00D2UMHWO,Like that it is only 30 mins. and on mornings when I'm running late I can still do cardio or weight training.  Good DVD to throw in and mix things up a little.  Love doing weights again after yrs. of not due to Fibro and osteoarthritis.  This is not too hard nor to easy.,1379289600,,271,3.9814814814814814
5769323,5,B00D2UMHWO,"So far I am at twelve days in a row and still going. Hang in there and keep it up. On the firm day there are lots of squats that I find hard on the knees, so I try to do something else during that time. I really like that it is only 30 minutes a day.
I have used other Leslie video and this and the other 30 minute Walk away the Pounds (walk/jog) are my favorites so far.",1379289600,,371,3.65

5769327,5,B00D2UMHWO,"I have six of Leslie's workouts and this is by far my favorite.  I use it at least 4 times per week and alternate amongst the other five 2 additional days per week so I don't get bored.  It's fun, you know you have worked out when your done, and most of all you feel good about yourself.  I look forward to her next new release to add to my collection.",1379116800,,352,3.9295774647887325
5769328,5,B00D2UMHWO,This is Leslie's best yet! I really enjoyed the 30 minutes of firming and her walk 30 added new variety with a few new moves. But as always with Leslie nothing hard or complicated.,1379116800,,180,4.323529411764706
5769329,5,B00D2UMHWO,"Because of a total hip replacement, I need to keep the strength up in my legs.  In the winter, I can't really walk outside since I don't want to fall on the ice and snow.  Leslie Sansone gives a great workout that you can adjust to your own needs.  I had never worked with a toning band before and really have been enjoying the one that comes with the DVD.",1379030400,,356,4.057142857142857
5769330,5,B00D2UMHWO,"I have maybe 10 different  Leslie Sansone walking DVD's and this one is the best so far. Love the 30 minute walk, it is very fast paced and a great workout. I love the 30 minutes of firming also as you can increase your weights as you progress. You Hit this one out of the park Leslie, keep more like this coming. I am on day 22!",1379030400,,329,3.91044776119403
5769331,5,B00D2UMHWO,I have several of Leslie's DVD's so I'm able to switch up my walking routines.  Hers is the only program I've been able to stick with. I  especially likie this program because you alternate your workout each day,1379030400,,211,4.526315789473684
5769332,4,B00D2UMHWO,This dvd is great!  Leslie does not disappoint as she kicks it up a notch with the routine.  I have always appreciated her positive approach to exercise.  I definitely need it to keep myself inspired.  Looking forward to see what she has coming out next :),1378944000,,256,4.5
5769333,5,B00D2UMHWO,Leslie did her thing with this one! This is the perfect 30 min walk. I love her other videos but this has to be one of my favorites.,1378857600,,132,3.75

5769335,5,B00D2UMHWO,This video is a bit more challenging than some of Leslie's videos.  The walking portion has a few new moves which is a nice change.  The strength training sessions are a little longer than her other videos so a person needs a little more endurance/stamina to complete this portion.,1378771200,,281,4.714285714285714
5769336,4,B00D2UMHWO,"I've wanted this type of video from Leslie, and she delivered!  A vigorous cardio walk one day, followed by no-nonsense exercises to firm and tone all over the body.  I'm glad I purchased it!",1378771200,,191,4.588235294117647
5769337,4,B00D2UMHWO,"I love this workout. I love the new set and the walkers all look nicely coordinated and the new set up is visually appealing to me. I just wish the walking (Burn 30) workout was longer! I get the whole ""30"" theme, but I'd love to see a future version of this with a 45 minute walking option and the same length firming segment. My favorite workouts tend to be 45-60 minutes since that's about all that my schedule permits. I've been doing this entire DVD in one day, a couple of days a week, in rotation with other workouts, instead of alternating burn and firm days.

I highly recommend this one!",1378684800,,597,4.330357142857143

5769347,5,B00D2UMHWO,I have A LOT of Leslie Sansone DVD's.  I love this one because she takes it to a new level.  In this DVD she keeps your heart rate going up & down during the cardio (very good!) and the weight work really works each area.  I used the same dumbbell weight  as she does in the DVD.  I like this that this DVD is to be used to alternate cardio & weights and gets the exercise done in 30 minutes!  Great DVD.  I highly recommend.,1378512000,,425,3.929411764705882
5769348,5,B00D2UMHWO,"This is one of Leslie's best workouts! You get cardio and strength training all within 30 minutes. If you're short on time and stuck in a rut with your workout, then this is for you. I like that it has 2 great workouts for alternating days, one for firming and the other is more of a cardio workout.  In my opinion, this is the only dvd you need.  I definitely SWEAT with both workouts.  You will need wrist weights and 5 pound weights(you can always start with 3lb).",1378425600,,467,4.284090909090909

5769352,4,B00D2UMHWO,"I was somewhat apprehensive about Leslie's newest venture since most of the walkers were younger and her last workout had younger walkers with more complex choreography, but this walk is quite nice.  I haven't tried the weight workout yet, but the aerobic 30 minute workout is quite nice and goes quickly.  Love the 10 minute counter at the end.  And she did add one walker with some age - GO LOUISE!!!",1378339200,,402,4.633802816901408

5769359,4,B00D2UMHWO,"I've only used the walking portions of the video, and they involve mostly standard Leslie moves, with a few of the newer ones (skaters, etc) thrown in. The music is decent, if somewhat abrupt- I still don't understand why, after all these years, Leslie and her people haven't gotten it together musically, to get songs of the right length and the right speed, to make transitioning between portions of the exercises smoother. The cast is a bunch of people I have never seen before- in one way, this is good because they include 2 guys and an older lady, but most of them look like 22-year olds who exercise for a living.  You can tell these exercises are really not that big a deal for them, unlike those of us at home who genuinely need to get into better shape.  I miss Mary Kay, Linda, Carol, and some of the other old-timers, and even the new peppy people (Bri, Nikki, Carrie, etc.).

5769363,5,B00D2UMHWO,"I've been using Leslie's videos for about a year and a half now, and have a dozen or so that I like to cycle through.  This is one of my favorites. If you are new to exercise, this probably isn't the video you want to start with. I can do her 5 mile walks and don't start sweating until mile 3 - this one has me sweating not long after starting the walk.  There are two segments, the first is the Burn 30 workout that you do Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.  The second segment is the Firm 30 workout that you do Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.  The Burn workout uses optional light hand weights and is fast.  Even the warm up is on the fast side, and along with the usual side steps, kicks, knee lifts and kick backs, there are skaters, ""step-step-run, run, runs"", tap outs, double tap outs, moving kick backs, and arms go up, down and out to the sides several times. At one point, Leslie stops doing the arm moves and walks around to talk to the walkers while everyone else keeps moving the arms.  You end with some squats before a brief cool down. There about twelve walkers, mostly women with two guys.  Most of the walkers are on the young side, with two older women near the back.  The older of the two does her darndest to keep up, but also modifies the moves as she goes, and she does not join the Firm workout.  The Firm workout uses dumb bells, and starts with a peppy few minutes of standard walking moves.  The Firm workout is all basic stuff, like squats with feet apart and together, toes turned out, rows, chest presses, lunges, etc.; there is also work on the floor for the abs and buns, along with the weights.  It ends with a full body stretch.  All in all, an excellent workout that is a great addition to my Leslie Library!  If you like Leslie, and are looking for a more challenging walk from her, this is a good one.  You can preview this DVD on YouTube from Collage Video or Anchor Bay Fitness.",1377734400,271,1915,4.268698060941828

5769365,5,B00D2UMHWO,"I've been working with Leslie's DVDs for 8 months.  I get bored easily with the same routines after about a week.  This one was the perfect addition to my collection.  The 30 minutes seems daunting, but really isn't.  It is a lot of the same moves with some new moves for a change of pace.  The time really flies and you know when you're nearing the end when the clock starts ticking down.  I did not try the firm section of this video but previewed part of it for tomorrow's workout.  There are some basic walking moves before she kicks into the weights.  I will try it with 3 pounders to see how it goes.  I hope Leslie keeps coming out with fresh workouts to keep me on my toes.",1377561600,2,681,4.176923076923077
5769366,5,B00D2UMHWO,"I have been doing Leslie's workouts since the beginning of the year and have quite a few of them.  I love them all, but I have to say that this is my new favorite.  It goes by in no time, and in 30 minutes you get a great workout and feel awesome afterwards.  I definitely expect to see awesome results with this workout.",1377388800,2,321,4.063492063492063
5769367,5,B00D2UMHWO,"I'VE BEEN DOING LESLIE SANSOME WORKOUTS FOR ABOUT 5 YEARS AND HAVE RECOMMENDED TO SEVERAL PEOPLE, I'M OVER 70 AND LIKE HER NEW USE OF YOUNGER STUDENTS AND THE EXPANDED USE OF WEIGHTS AND STRENGTH BANDS",1377302400,2,201,4.611111111111111
5769368,3,B00D2UMHWO,This video is just OK.  The work out is only 30 minutes but it is too intense for someone just starting to exercise.  I typically use this only once a week (at most).  I definitely wouldn't want to do it every day for 30 days.  I much prefer the 5 day walk video,1377216000,,262,3.8867924528301887
5769369,3,B00D2UMHWO,"I think the dumbbells option is a great change from the stretchie - I enjoy now having the option of working out with both as strength training options, it keeps the workouts from feeling too repetitive.  I use heavy weights (10 pds bells/ 20lb body bar) and a weighted vest to help keep the firm workouts higher in intensity.

Overall it is a decent set of workouts - I think these are on par with her overall recent workouts; however, for me, I had a soundtrack professionally created (from a studio engineer) that I use when I walk so that I hear what I enjoy - I hear Hip Hop and R&B, some Pop and some Gospel - various uptempo artists, etc.  I have done this for every one of my last 10 walking workouts and I love it - it is so much more fun when I hear the music I enjoy the most.  Without the right music, these would get boring very quick.

Overall, its a 3/maybe 3.5 rating - if it was longer, I would have rated this higher....",1377043200,2,938,4.131868131868132
5769370,5,B00D2UMHWO,One of my favorite workouts by Leslie and I have several of them. I am seeing results in only 2 weeks using this workout. Love it!,1376956800,4,130,4.038461538461538
5769371,5,B00D2UMHWO,"I own about ten of Leslie's DVD's and this one is now my favorite.

The Walk portion is wonderful with new, fun challenging moves....the music....oh, the THE MUSIC is GREAT!! More jazzy and kind of laid back, not frenetic like some other work out music.  The final song brings to mind 'Austin Powers' for some reason, it is delightful.  The cast is terrific, no one annoying which can be a huge distraction.  The one young man, Nick is a treat to watch, he is adorable! Leslie shines the brightest in a large group.

I have only done the Walk portion so far and I am so impressed.  This is a smarter workout because you can opt to use the weights.  I use 2 lbs each arm now and can really feel the difference in the intensity and progress.  I also wear her weight belt from another DVD.  The scale proved it the first week kicking me off a plateau I had been on for a time with another 2.5 loss.  These work outs WORK.  I could not be more pleased while having fun!  Thank you Leslie, you are a God-send.

My other favorite is the 4 Mile Super Challenge in the Walk Away the Pounds Ultimate Collection.",1376956800,4,1102,4.265700483091788
5769372,3,B00D2UMHWO,"I like Leslie Sansone and have several of her videos. I walk with her 6-7 times a week (with NO modification to the exercise).  But ageism is on display in this video:  Clearly, a significant proportion of  people 60+ are in incredibly good shape.  Even if we ignore the super athletes who are 65+ years old, a huge number of older people remain who are in excellent shape.  In this video one older walker is represented (already a misrepresentation of the 65% demographic in the US).  She is clearly a good sport, but is strategically placed alone in the far back where she barely gets a hello as Leslie enthusiastically greets everyone else.  Bottom line: this video gives you a nice workout.  However, for those who are older - beware, you'll have to get past your irritation at the covert suggestion you'll have to modify movements in order to keep up.  Please, Leslie, give us a range of walkers of various ages and levels of fitness, including people 65+ who have no difficulty keeping up with you.",1376870400,15,1004,4.627118644067797
5769373,5,B00D2UMHWO,"DVD consists of new material - two 30 minute workouts, and new faces in the supporting fitness crew. One workout is Cardio focused  and the other is Firming & Toning. Alternate the workouts every other day, 6 days a week - one day off to rest (and in the beginning, you will appreciate the ""rest day"").  I feel the segments are more intermediate than beginner level, but they are not overwhelming workouts (in length or level of difficulty). The firming segment uses lots of squats and lunges, with handweights, and your legs WILL feel it!",1376784000,18,539,4.663157894736842
5769374,4,B00D2UMHWO,I wanted something that was short and gives a fairly decent workout.  This is great.  It isn't the hardest of hers but it's also not the easiest.  If all you have is a half hour this is great.,1376611200,3,192,4.0
5769375,5,B00D2UMHWO,"I have been a fan of Leslie's walking videos for a while.  I have quiet a few.  This workout is definitely a step up (ha!) from the others.  It incorporates a few more moves into the walking portion, and the weight segment is no joke.  There's more young people with her, and it just feels like a fresher version of her older stuff.  I love it!  It's fun, gives a good workout, but isn't so intense that it wears me out.",1376524800,4,420,4.1234567901234565
5769376,5,B00D2UMHWO,"I love Leslie Sansone's walking program.  I finally tried this new workout today and love it!

There are new moves in this video as compared to the other two videos I have (Walk off even more weight and start walking at home).  I also like the addition of strength training and I think she put it together well for people to follow.

I prefer when there is a timer on the screen as in the ""Start walking at home"" dvd, but a timer does show up the last 10 minutes of the workouts, which is helpful.

I recommend this product to anyone who is looking to lose weight or is currently following an exercise regimen.

If you are a beginner, you may want to start with the ""start walking at home"" dvd, it's a bit less intense than this one, but it is still a great workout!

I am very pleased with this dvd so far, and will assess how much weight I lose after 30 sessions and update then:)",1376438400,10,882,4.152941176470589

5769378,5,B00D2UMHWO,This DVD is AMAZING! The energy of Leslie and the cast always keeps me motivated! The moves are simple to do so I can do this EVERYDAY! This workout is unlike anything else! This is MUST-HAVE DVD!,1376179200,3,196,4.324324324324325
5769379,5,B00D2UMHWO,"Warning: this workout is moderate intensity--so if you are restricted to low intensity workouts, this one may not be suitable for you.

I love love love Leslie's workouts, and this one is my new favorite!! It is easy to fit into your schedule & only requires 30 minutes a day. The burn 30 segment contains a lot of her basic moves--which are easy to follow (I'm very uncoordinated); but the 30 minute cardio walk is at a pretty fast pace & you will sweat.  The firm 30 segment is EXCELLENT!!  Works out all your major muscles!  If you're trying to lose weight--I think you WILL see results if you follow the 30 day plan (& eat healthier).

I am not trying to lose weight--just maintain, & I use Leslie's workouts almost everyday.  However, I do need to tone my muscles, so I think I will give the 30 day plan a try!  I did the firm segment today, and I'm feeling a little bit sore--but in a good way (not in an overwhelming way).

Some of my other favorite Leslie workouts are: Burn Body Fat; Belly Blasting Walk; Ultimate 5 Day Walk Plan; and 3 Mega Miles (all of these workouts also include segments of strength training and/or toning segments).

Bottom line: if you are a healthy individual (no physical restrictions) & you simply love Leslie's workouts due to her easy to follow moves, then this DVD is a MUST to add to your collection. Enjoy!",1376092800,25,1347,4.443089430894309

5769381,5,B00D2UMHWO,"Love this workout.  I ordered it just because I have several of Leslie's other workouts.  I have not done them for a while because I always buy new workouts to keep it fresh.  I really did not expect it to be much different from the others except for music and clothing, but it is fantastic.  The 30-minute BURN IT workout uses a lot more of a variety of steps and it goes so much faster than the previous workouts.  The alternate day FIRM IT exercises pass by just as quickly doing all parts of the body with light weights or however heavy you want.  It seems more like 15 minutes than 30.  Great Job Leslie.  Thank you for a powerfully fun workout.",1376006400,39,650,4.270491803278689
5769382,5,B00D2UMHWO,"I am a longtime Leslie walker, owning many of her workouts from the past 15 years. I recently tried to branch out and get a strength training DVD (NOT Leslie) and was hugely disappointed! The day after it arrived I was back on Amazon shopping, Walk it Off came out that day and I was thrilled to see an entire strength training aspect. About the walk, new faces and new music! LOVE it! Very peppy without being too difficult for a middle aged woman. I workout daily but using the 1 lb hand weights (optional) had the sweat rolling off me. The steps are all familiar with a little bit of difference in that the cha-cha has a ""run"" in the middle instead of walk and the tap behind is called a ""Skater"" and is a bit more exaggerated. Easily adaptable for anybody and fitness level. The strength training is a perfect workout. It's a nice 30 min workout that covers the whole body. Leslie mentions a variety of pounds that they are all using for weights. As always, it's a Leslie walk that encourages you to work at your own pace and reminds you of safe body movement. This is my new favorite Leslie workout! Well worth the $, a great value since you get not only a 2 mile walk, but a 30 min strength training session. This one does NOT disappoint! Nice set, great cast, awesome workout and the music is terrific.",1376006400,146,1309,4.346938775510204
5769383,5,B00D2UMHWO,"This is the Leslie I love taken up a notch.

The cardio portion has her typical moves, but with some fun variations like cha-cha's and skaters.  The pace is brisk throughout and I got a good workout.  She changes moves frequently enough that I didn't get bored and the workout was done before I knew it.  My only complaint is that she does a couple of fist pumps, not enough to ruin it for me, but they are so cheesy.

I am so happy about the strength portion.  I've been working out to her videos for years, but always wished there was more of a strength component.  This hits all the major muscle groups and has a nice variety.  I appreciate that she did a nice set of everything without going overboard (for example, the lunges definitely were tough but I didn't feel like I was going to die because they were neverending).  She also does a great job of leading you on the floor exercises so you know when to go in and out of the move without having to stare at the TV ~ made it much easier to keep proper form.

All in all, I am very pleased with this DVD.",1375833600,12,1060,4.151960784313726
5769384,5,B00D2UMHWO,"I tried both workouts. The cardio section is great, with an option for using light hand weights. My guess is that it may be a little more than 2 miles, due to the pace of the music. There is some ""boosting"" - great for the heart rate!

The weights section was definitely different for her and was comprehensive. There are some pauses, but a good strength workout overall.

I won't be doing the 30 day plan, but it is a great idea for someone starting out. If you are starting out, Leslie makes it easy to modify your movements.

I will definitely keep these workouts in my lineup, especially when I only have 30 minutes.",1375833600,6,620,4.373913043478261
5769385,4,B00D2UMHWO,"Leslie's new workout is a nice coordinated pair of 30 minute workouts to alternate--fast paced walking in one workout and strength training in the second workout.  The walking workout is 30 minutes, including a warm up and cool down.  The pace is consistently fast and the moves include Leslie's traditional four walk moves, plus a few add-ons like skaters and cha-chas.  I like the fast pace--it kept my heart rate up.  The set is nice and bright and the music is energetic.  The strength workout includes a cardio warm up and then a complete set of moves for legs, arms, and abs.  She does a fair number of squats and lunges, then moves into work for the arms.  The workout finishes on the floor with some additional moves for arms and chest, and then ab work.

The is a good basic set that includes all you need for a good exercise program.  I like the 30 minute pacing because you can easily fit in one or do both for a longer workout.",1375833600,142,939,4.412790697674419
5769386,5,B00D2UMHWO,"Just got this DVD this afternoon, popped it in and did both parts.  It is a 30 minute walk with no mile markers.  It is just a fast-paced and varied walk.  The second section was the weights/toning section.  I really liked it and this one will be usable for a long while, if one keeps increasing weights as the exercises get easier with repetition and hopefully, increasing strength and fitness.  Kind of wish there were more abs exercises, but never the less it is a good well-rounded workout which hits all the requirements of aerobic exercise and strength training, especially necessary as one gets older.  I'll use this DVD - both sections - on Tues/Thurs/Sat and do the 5-mile walk DVDs on Mon/Wed/Fri. for an hour workout every day.",1375747200,27,738,4.682170542635659

The time flew by and before I knew it it was done. I used hand weights with the walk for a bit of a boost. I have not done the tone portion but will update once I do.,1375747200,3,304,3.621212121212121
5769388,5,B00D2UMHWO,"I love Leslie Sansone.  She saved my life!  Doing her workouts, I have lost forty pounds and have continued to maintain the weight loss.  I have ten, maybe fifteen, of her DVDs.  I was excited to see the writeup on this latest DVD and preordered it through Amazon.  Well, it arrived today and I hit the ground running.

The DVD is in two segments - you are supposed to do segment one on M, W, F - this is the cardio segment with lots of our favorite moves but to a super quick pace.  The music is much improved but it is fast.  Leslie also does some new moves, bounces, skaters (side steps with a toe touch to the back) and a cha cha move.  There are a mix of people with her - none of our old favorites however.  There is also a brief cool down.

The second segment is the weight segment.  You are supposed to do this segment on T, Th, Sat.  (taking Sunday off).  After a brief cardio warmup, you pick up your dumbbells - I used two 5 pounders - and you squat and squat and squat some more - If you don't like squats, you won't like this.  And after squats, you do lunges.  Killer!  Leslie also does some floor exercises with the weights as well.  That's it!

Because it was new and I wanted to write a review, I did both segments.  I did sweat a lot - a real lot - but I was able to get through both segments one after the other.  This is not your normal Leslie DVD, and I thank her for putting out something that is more challenging and mixes things up a bit.  A give it FIVE stars.",1375747200,622,1485,4.013698630136986

Well fast forward to today and I now own about 15 of her DVDs! Ive tried various other workouts over the years and always came back to Leslies. I like the easy, uncomplicated workouts she does. It might sound strange but I like a relaxing workout and Leslie delivers. You don't need the extra equipment if you choose. It really is a great workout. Perfect for all ages. Great for moms or others who cant get outside or to a gym to workout. You don't need a lot of room either. Having these workouts available makes me workout more. No excuses.
