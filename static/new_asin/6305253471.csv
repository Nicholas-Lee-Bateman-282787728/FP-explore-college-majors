The DVD has a bare bones menu of the type I have seen with soft core films",1024963200,,167,4.090909090909091
7886509,1,6305253471,"Stranger By Night - Awful Movie/Good KATT!STRANGER BY NIGHT is an illogical endeavor by all counts, yet it has a spectacular supporting performance by -- of all people -- actor William Katt (who was the title  character in the TV series THE GREATEST AMERICAN HERO). Playing a  libidinous, extroverted detective, Katt gives his scenes some feral kick,  and he actually gives the illusion that you're watching a real movie. (It's  sort of the effect Mickey Rourke elicited in his brief role in 1981's  monotonous BODY HEAT.) However, this movie should be titles ""Movie of  the week"", and be airing weekly on TNT's Dinner and a Movie.
Seventh Floor - This film is very well acted (yes, even the notoriously  bad Brooke Shields pulls off an almost flawless performance), well written,  and has amazingly well done special effects. The whole movie is centered  around Kate (brooke), who recently has become widowed, and is left with the  pain of her loss, and the bills. She does own 1/3 of an advertising firm,  where the other 2/3 pays her out and forces her to leave. She finds the  love of her life, who rents an apartment in the building she was left stuck  with. Well....everything turns upside down....THis movie is a must  see.
**These 2 DVDs were produced when DVD technology first became  available a few years back. The quality of the DVDs is bairly better than  VHS tapes, however, if you are interested in seeing the Seventh Floor, you  might as well pick up this set for 1.00 more than that film is on its own.",964224000,,1519,4.693181818181818
