4977515,4,B00687K9U0,"VOODOO MAN is probably the best William Beaudine movie ever made. The plot, though silly, is at least serviceable. Women are vanishing along a lonely stretch of rural road. A man (Bela Lugosi) is abducting these unsuspecting females, in an attempt to revive his dead wife. Bela employs a group of henchman, including John Carradine and George Zucco to do the dirty work. Of course, voodoo is utilized, zombie women meander around, and Zucco spouts mumbo jumbo, while wearing feathers on his head! This is glorious stuff indeed! You haven't truly lived until you've seen John Carradine banging on a bongo drum like a trained seal!  Soon, black magic and mad science merge, and Bela shifts into high gear. I can watch this movie again and again...",1362268800,4,745,4.866141732283465
8494699,2,B00687K9U0,"I don't hand out stars because famous actors are in a movie. It has to tell a decent story. This is classic B&W schlock horror. The story is average for the period/genre; a far-fetched tale of powerful voodoo magic. This particular brand of ""cheese"" is swiss; being full of holes.

Two elderly white guys, Zucco and Lugosi, skilled in voodoo magic, preserve Lugosi's wife's corpse by kidnapping women and connecting their brains to the wife's via voodoo. Of course, the more beautiful they are, the better it is for the woman's recovery. Mind you, the wife has been dead for a couple of decades. She is preserved somehow, when our story begins.

Lugosi plays Crazy Doctor. Zucco is Voodoo Man, his witch doctor brother. Carradine is one of Lugosi's half-witted henchman. At the start, Crazy Doctor and Voodoo Man own a house and gas station in the center of the town of Nowhere. They have been here for many years, yet only recently have women began disappearing. How was Zombie Wife preserved prior? Why did they have to move here? How do they get food?

So here's the set up. Voodoo Man works the gas station. When a single female stops for gas, he determines if she is suitable, then, via intercom, informs Crazy Doctor. Crazy Doctor sends Henchmen to intercept victim. Victim is mesmerized and hooked up to Zombie Wife via voodoo ritual. [Kinda like jump starting a car.] Zombie Wife comes to life but falls back into zombie stupor. Ritual failed because victim was an inferior subject. [Voodoo gods are very selective]
Victims remain in a zombie like state and are stabled in cells. [This is the extent of the horror; victims are zombified.]

Well, of course, Pretty Miss, the female lead is the perfect subject. Now, it turns out, Voodoo Man can just call victims via the Psychotic Network, put them under a trance and guide them right to their doom. He is somehow able to know precisely when the victim is unattended.  Well, Pretty Miss falls victim to the scheme and is zombified. Zombie Wife ""lives"". Oh my, what's to be done? Dashing Dan, her fiance, was one-punched during his daring rescue and lies dormant on the floor.

Enter Sherrif Calvary, guns blazing. He plugs Crazy Doctor and the party is over. [Too bad he didn't aim for some of the holes in the plot.] Zombie Wife falls dead. All her victims return to their original state of well being. They were just life support units. As long as they were in a zombie state, she could transcend her zombie state and ""be a real girl""?

Voodoo Man dedicated over 20 years of his life helping Crazy Doctor preserve/revitalize Zombie Wife. What was his motivation? This isn't a story of 2 men trying to resurrect an ancient power or a great ruler. It's a far fetched story of a man's obsession with holding on to his wife. Voodoo Man shares this obsession and is subservient to Crazy Doctor. Why?

Carradine's henchman is worth watching. He plays a ""gollum"" type character. Lugosi and Zucco do as well as needed. The story doesn't do anything around building their characters. Viewers just have to accept their positions and powers.",1529107200,,3089,4.707407407407407
8494700,5,B00687K9U0,"The usual sincere performance by Lugosi backed up by Zucco and Carradine along with a nice spooky atmosphere make this a star studded, fun zombie flick.",1527984000,,152,4.884615384615385
8494701,3,B00687K9U0,"The last of the Bela Lugosi Monogram pictures. It's lots of fun and truly bizarre. I mean, George Zucco as a gas station owner? John Carradine as a half wit also makes this flick unique. The quality of the film on streaming is not very good, but the picture is 73 years old. Believe it or not,I can re watch this film for the sheer lunacy of it.",1486684800,,345,4.088235294117647
8494702,3,B00687K9U0,"It's always a delight to see a Bela Lugosi film for the first time. After all these years you'd think I'd seen them all, but this was a new one for me. As usual with Lugosi films, the quality of the film making is dreadful, but, also as usual with Lugosi films, he gives it all he's got. George Zucco must have been drunk. And poor John Carradine! His career certainly took a downward spiral, too. But the movie is good, clean fun. Silly, but fun.",1485216000,,447,4.209302325581396
8494703,4,B00687K9U0,"Awesome B movie from the 1940s!  Part old, dark house story, part brides of Dracula.  Lugosi awesome as usual.  John Carradine gives a mighty fine Igor incarnation.  And how they got George Zucco's rather satanic-looking costume for the big voodoo scene past the censors of the day, I will never know.  Buffs will enjoy this entry from prolific director William Beaudine.

Only minus is that the sound quality is pretty bad in this print.",1481328000,,438,4.851351351351352
