8683540,2,B004CNIZJY,"This is a really good cardio workout. The problem I have is with the audio. Westfall does a live narration during the workout and with all the splashing noise, it's really hard to hear her instructions. She should've done a voice over. Her choice of music isn't the most inspiring either, but a great  improvement over the awful music in a couple of older Westfall DVDs I own.",1529798400,,376,4.529411764705882

8683548,5,B004CNIZJY,"This is a serious workout. Karen keeps up the pace and makes great use of the pool. There is a paddle workout included but I use foam ""weights"" instead and they work great. I feel my strength improving and this has helped my weight loss efforts. I like that this a full hour, complete workout. I am eager for her next workout.",1373673600,21,326,4.274193548387097
