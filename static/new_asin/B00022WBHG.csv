8020971,5,B00022WBHG,"I bought all 4 of the Terrific Trip videos when they first came out 27 years ago when my children were little. Now my grandchildren watch & love them too! I have done home day care for 30 years, and believe it or not, these videos have performed perfectly and entertained many, many children. A Trip To A Hot Air Balloon Festival and A Trip To The Farm are my absolute favorites! These videos are bright & colorful,  musical, and educational as well as entertaining. Fisher Price would use their heads and re-release these classics on DVD!",1411084800,,539,4.556701030927835
