2783869,3,B000NVIGF2,"I found the overall quality (audio and video) to be good with the exception of a couple episodes where the sound and video quality were not that good. On a few of the episodes, the video is very dark. But overall, it's a nice collection of the 'early' years of Ozzie and Harriet Show. Young Ricky Nelson was comical in his role as a typical 13 year old or so with the quick comebacks and answers. I'm glad to have this dvd, especially now that none of the Harriets are with us anymore with David Nelson's recent passing.",1303603200,,520,4.316326530612245

2783871,5,B000NVIGF2,"The thing I like about this compilation is the fact that most of the commercials have been left in. They are as much a walk down memory lane as the show itself. After viewing this 4-DVD set I got the 12-DVD set put out by the same people. (Mill Creek) It has 100 episodes. So I'll be watching a lot of Ozzie & Harriet...and old commercials in the near future.

2783873,5,B000NVIGF2,THIS IS A SUPER FANTASTIC SET OF O&H DVD'S!!  EXCELLENT QUALITY AS WELL..A MUST FOR YOU NELSON COLLECTORS!! NOT TO MENTION THE FEW NEW EPISODES THAT HAVEN'T BEEN RELEASED BEFORE..,1183507200,2,179,4.966666666666667
2783874,4,B000NVIGF2,"Prospective purchasers of this 4-DVD set from Mill Creek Entertainment might want to hold off until October 2007 when Mill Creek will release a massive 12-DVD, 100-episode collection titled ""The Essential Ozzie & Harriet Collection.""  The 38 episodes contained on the set currently being offered by Amazon represent the first 38 episodes that will appear on the 100 episode set that will become widely available in October.  I am sharing this information because I was shipped the larger collection by mistake from another online retailer.  The 100 episode collection is currently a television shopping network exclusive.

If you decide to purchase this 38 episode set, I'd have to say that it's probably the ""cream of the crop"" as far as the various collections of the ""public domain"" episodes of the series are concerned.  The episodes are certainly not restored and really run the spectrum in terms of running times.  Ironically, an episode titled ""Be On Time"" only runs 20 minutes and there are a few other syndicated episodes running in the 22 and a half minute range.  But the good news is that the vast majority of the episodes in this collection are complete, many with original commercials for Listerine, Kodak, Hotpoint (look quickly for Mary Tyler Moore as ""Happy Hotpoint"") and Aunt Jemima Pancakes, among others.  Complete episodes with commercials run over 29 minutes.

The shows are an absolute joy to watch . . . . . this is warm hearted, gentle family humor that's sadly missing from today's television landscape.  All of the episodes in this collection are from the 1950s, and most of the episodes focus on the family before the Nelson boys went off to college and got married.  Although this is not an authorized release through the Nelson Family, it is very much a worthwhile ""supplement"" to the official ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Best-of-the-Adventures-of-Ozzie-and-Harriet/dp/B000MGBSQC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Best of the Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet</a>"" issued by Shout! Factory and which is also available at Amazon.  Sadly, the episodes included on the set from Shout! Factory include 22 minute plus syndicated episodes, but the inclusion of audio commentaries from David Nelson and Sam Nelson (Ricky Nelson's youngest son) and other bonus material make that set a worthwhile purchase for fans of the show.

My recommendation on this collection is to wait for the 100 episode set to be released in October; it will be the largest collection of Ozzie & Harriet episodes available in a single collection.  If you can't wait, or only enjoy the show's earlier years when the boys were younger, this set is a good inexpensive way to sit back and relax with the Nelsons.",1178236800,41,2750,5.234624145785877

2783876,5,B000NVIGF2,Just finished viewing this NEW offering of some great shows from the 1950's early 60's and the best set I have seen to date for the money. Rick sings in some and the quality is good to excellent. Just a great set with some shows featuring the original integrated commercials...good buy.,1176854400,9,286,4.627450980392157
8181639,5,B000NVIGF2,"This is a great collection of episodes gathered from seasons 1-6, or 1952-58! I have the Best Of sets from ""Nelson Family Presents"" by Shout Factory, which left me wanting more episodes from the earlier seasons before Ricky and David got married as well as when Thorny was their neighbor. This was the perfect solution to that! I wish this set was evened out at 40 episodes. ""Ricky's Big Night"" and ""David the Sleuth"" could have been those additions too! But I have no actual complaints with this collection. I've watched almost every episode and have enjoyed every one so far! ""Ozzie's Triple Banana Split Surprise"", ""The Pancake Mix"", ""The Pajama Game"", ""The Reading Room"" and ""Ricky the Drummer"" are some of my favorites.

Admittedly at first I was hesitant to purchase this because I have the Jack Benny set from this series by Mill Creek and the quality of those episodes vary between watchable to poor. However other reviews about this set put me at ease and I agree that the overall quality of the episodes are clear. There are a few (expected) signs of age on certain episodes in places and an occasional episode may be slightly dark or soft but it isn't distracting. I was thrilled that there are original commercials in many of the episodes which is a fun ""bonus"" and great for those seeking unedited episodes. The Kodak commercials featuring the Nelsons themselves are the best!

Being that I was a senior in high school when David Nelson passed away, which is how I discovered the show and Ricky's music, I can't say that the episodes bring back memories of the past. But what I love about Ozzie and Harriet is how the writing/acting creates with likable characters (such as Harriet's quick witted comebacks!) a light hearted humor. And there's something that I find relaxing about that when I take a break from my life to escape into the fun of the day to day adventures of the Nelson family.",1496793600,,1905,4.683582089552239

8181641,5,B000NVIGF2,"I recently bought this selection, with the Post Office delivering it on Monday, June 20, 2016, and I had it in my hands the very next day. I originally thought to save it, but I couldn't. I can't resist watching ""OZZIE & Harriet"" episodes. I began with the fourth disc. Then I went to the second disc. After that one, I put on disc three. And last, but not least, the first disc. Disc one to three has ten episodes each, with the remaining eight on the fourth disc. It is just as the packaging says, except there isn't any mention that the original commercials are laced throughout the episodes. Many of the episodes are very clear. Some, of course, have minor film dingys that didn't interfere with my enjoyment of the episodes. I don't believe that most of The Ozzie & Harriet Show episodes have been remastered. As long as they are clear enough to watch, I'm not going to fuss about it, because I think we, the fans, are fortunate to be getting any of these episodes at all. To date I have bought six collections since last November. What I've been trying to do is buy as many collections as possible without constantly rebuying the same episodes. When I come across a collection I check the episode list to see which ones I already have. Then I count whats left and compare that to the pricing. I am willing to pay no more than a dollar for each episode that I don't have. My idea is: if the collection cost me fifteen dollars, then there has to be no less than fifteen episodes that I don't have, in that collection. So far I have come up with pretty good odds. Like so many fans, though, I am not fond of the ""volumes"", which I won't buy. They are to pricey for what the fans are getting. And besides, all of the episodes are yet to be released, hopefully. If I buy these episodes in volumes I will spend a considerable lot more money. And with this show having Fourteen Seasons, a fan could probably spend a few thousand dollars. I've already learned my lesson after buying ""PERRY MASON"" and ""LAND OF THE GIANTS "" that way. Imagine buying collections and volumes and then turning around and buying them by the season! I'm sure a few fans would be rather upset. Me included, which is another reason why I will not buy this show by the volume.

This collection have every episode that is on the ""OZZIE & HARTIET"" 100 EPISODE COLLECTION, which I won't buy now because I have most of what is on that collection, unless I buy a good used copy. There are episodes in that collection that I still do not have. In this collection, most of the  episodes were from when David and Ricky were younger. Only on disc four is David over Twenty - One. Also in this collection, ""WALLY PLUMSTEAD"", SKIP YOUNG, appears only once, in the episode: ""THE CHRISTMAS TREE LOT"". SKIP YOUNG was born in 1930, putting him at a few years older than David, Ricky, and all of their friends. ""JUNE BLAIR"", David's wife, was three years younger than SKIP. And three years older than DAVID. Ricky was at the height of his cute appeal in these episodes. I know that a lot of ""OZZIE & HARRIET"" fans liked David and Ricky when they were younger, but l prefer them after they had grown up. I think it is because, at that time on television, there were alot of Child Actors, but only David and Ricky grew up before our eyes. Of course their situations changed too. They were given more adult situations, like College, girls, and marriage storylines. I won't list the episodes because someone else has done that.

  There are about ten episodes in this collection that I really enjoyed. They are:

  1.  ""DAVID'S 17TH BIRTHDAY""
  2.  ""THE PAJAMA GAME""
  3.  ""MUSIC APPRECIATION""
  4.  ""DAVID PICKS UP THE TAB""
  5.  ""THE DUENNA""
  6.  ""THE EDITOR""
  7.  ""OZZIE'S TRIPLE BANANA SURPRISE""
  8.  ""TUTTI - FRUTTI ICE CREAM""
  9.  ""THE CHRISTMAS TREE LOT""
  10. ""THE BACHELOR""

I gave this Collection five stars for: print quality, liner artwork, the price, episode selections, and speedy shipping. I might add that I bought this selection from a Seller. I don't usually break my stars down that way to rate a product, but I felt that that was the only way I could rate this selection. And besides, what can I say about ""OZZIE & HARRIET"" that probably has not been said before! IT IS AND WAS A FANTASTIC SHOW. I'm also very pleased with the artwork on the Cover Liner. It is so beautiful. When I was looking at this on ""AMAZON"" I thought the artwork had more gray in the background. I'm happy to say that it doesn't. There is even a blue sky and trees that I didn't notice when I was ordering this selection. The spine on the cover is Forest Green, and the back is Mint Green. I don't usually rave about covers, but I had to discuss the one on this collection. The discs all have the same portrait of the ""Nelsons"". Inside of the cover each disc is inside of a clear window envelope. They sitting on two plastic hooks with a molded piece at the top to keep them in place, so that they won't jiggle around, instead of them being held on plastic holders, like in most cases. One last thing, does anyone else besides me think that the word: ""Frutti"", should be spelled ""Fruitti""? After all, the word ""Fruit"" does have an ""i"" in it. I won't deduct a star for that.",1466726400,,5222,4.403125

8181643,5,B000NVIGF2,"If you enjoy ""Old School"" you will be entertained by the Nelson family.  The show is a vintage 1950's sitcom reflective of values and times neither of which ever existed.  But America wanted those Nelson values to exist and embraced this adult cartoon with passion.  On the show Ozzie was depicted as bumbling and helpless in the face of most day to day problems.  Harriet was always nudging him in the right direction.  In real life Ozzie Nelson was rather a brutish, tyrannical genius with regards to both his family and the show.  The show is fun but I keep reminding myself it was built on a myth by a con man.",1418083200,,614,4.4375

8181647,4,B000NVIGF2,"These black and white shows, dating mostly from the early '50s, rank among the most delightful TV I've seen in a long time. The price right now is nearly free for 38 episodes on 4 discs. Mill Creek has packaged the discs safely and economically in little paper sleeves that stack in the DVD case. The writing is simply wonderful. Witty, low-key, never snarkey. Devoid in every way of the elements that writers today feel are required in a sitcom, and which this show shows are not. Don DeFore is Oz's next door neighbor in the earlier shows, and he's a ball of fire. Many know about Rick Nelson's singing career, but David holds his own in the show quite well, and Harriet gets a lot of good lines and deadpan refrains. Since Ozzie was a bandleader, there's lots of music worked into the shows. Why not five stars? It could be five stars, simply based on entertainment value and enjoyment quotient, but these discs have not been remastered. Most shows are quite watchable, with only a few print problems. Shows also include commercials. The worst are for Listerine. The best are for Kodak (the later shows on disc four). Anyone who ever saw an episode will enjoy having this set, and some younger viewers may find themselves also drawn to the convivial Nelsons and the inviting Land of Oz.",1362441600,,1289,4.608695652173913
