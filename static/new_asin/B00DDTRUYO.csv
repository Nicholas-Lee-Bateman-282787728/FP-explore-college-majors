5793545,5,B00DDTRUYO,I have all the episodes and have enjoyed this series tremendously from the very beginning. The whole team of actors are superb and work beautifully together - good chemistry in casting. The stories are intriguing and absorbing. Hope to see more episodes in the future. Also an extra bonus has been the fact that I am picking up the Swedish language.,1391299200,2,349,4.737704918032787
5793546,1,B00DDTRUYO,"pathetic acting and unrealistic jujitsu fight scenes makes little credible the series.
Action scenes are borderline ridiculous. Direction has been pretty careless. Story very boring and full of inconsistencies.",1384387200,,210,6.275862068965517
5793547,5,B00DDTRUYO,Angela Kovacs is perfect in the role of Inspector Huss. The entire series is outstanding! All of the characters are likeable.,1382918400,,125,5.0
5793548,5,B00DDTRUYO,You notice I did not put the great lady detective and there was a good reason for that . She does not need to act nor be treated any differently because she is a female. She takes on all the duties and grizzly crimes as well as any man. She is proof it can be done by someone who was once viewed as only being able to dance backwards while wearing high heels. She shows a totally soft side to her when dealing with her gorgeous husband and beautiful twin daughters. She not only has a tough job but she also has a wonderful demanding family. She has earned every bit of respect her colleges show her.,1380412800,,600,4.136752136752137
5793549,5,B00DDTRUYO,"The story lines of virtually all Scandanavian police mysteries are surely dark and not for the faint hearted. Yet, the beautiful live scenes from Sweden and the incredible gifted performances by Mrs. Kovacs warrant total praise.",1378080000,,228,5.361111111111111
8592322,5,B00DDTRUYO,"I am always on the lookout for a police/procedural/mystery series, and if it is found in Europe, all the better. I came across the 'Irene Huss' series by chance, and it is a winner!

Taken from the writings of Helene Tursten, this crime thriller series lends its way to film very well. Set in Gotenberg, Sweden, gritty seaside port city, the crimes are varied and some quite unusual. The star of this series is Angela Kovacs, who plays Irene Huss. A more natural actor you will not find. She lends herself to the simplicity of intelligent thought and careful mastery of detective work. She is a wife, mother of twin daughters, and a full time detective. From the get go, we can tell she is the go to detective of her department. The others are all intelligent, but have some sort of personality quirk. Irene is quick to pick up clues, quick to win trust of the victims and quick to go off on her own into unsettled and violent areas. However, with her quick wit and physical acuity she is able to sidestep most of the problems she runs into. We are privy to her family life with her chef husband and teenage daughters. Irene is a real person, a real woman with wants, desires and the ability to manipulate her environment. Angela Kovacs is this series, and it is apparent to everyone.

I have not read any of Helene Tursten's books, but I will be on the lookout for them. This is a series of an intelligent and attractive woman, and often that is an enigma.

Highly Recommended. prisrob 03-12-17",1489276800,,1495,4.488970588235294

8592327,4,B00DDTRUYO,"Thought that the show improved with time.
Episodes show more quality work.",1430870400,,74,5.25
8592328,3,B00DDTRUYO,"The first three sets are much better than this one - Episodes 10-12 didn't have the style and substance from the earlier ones. There is also no fights in 10 and 11 and only one fight in 12 that lasted 2 seconds. I'm not complaining, but the hand to hand fighting is one way to reveal Irene character and how determined she is to win at all costs. Episode 11, which I will not spoil for you, also has Irene doing something so against her character that I was stunned by it - as you will be when you watch it.

Overall Episodes 10-12 are much bleaker and create a feeling of helplessness which is not dispelled at the end. This series ends on a note that doesn't ring true, not after what we just watched. Add this to your collection, but watch the first three sets first to see the real, intelligent and complex detective of Irene Huss.",1420243200,,835,4.251572327044025
8592329,5,B00DDTRUYO,Tiring of American detective TV my husband and I have discovered the wonderful world of Scandaniavian detectives.  IRENE HUSS never fails to entertain!,1400284800,,151,5.565217391304348
8592330,5,B00DDTRUYO,Irene Huss is an excellent mystery cop show. She is tuff and rather cute. She has a normal personal life and the personal does not overshadow the  police work or the mystery. Also most of the endings are quite exciting. It is better than most American shows.,1392508800,,258,4.48936170212766
8592331,5,B00DDTRUYO,"This is the latest in a series that does not get boring or illogical. The story lines and characters are by and large plausible, and is more than another episode in a good ongoing drama.",1391558400,,186,4.3428571428571425
