8743381,4,B018YGVMLW,"Two reasonably good representations of 70's hard core, complete with story and passably good, sometime quite good acting.  Paul Thomas in Robin's Nest beats the not-bad performance by Eric Edwards.  The girls are attractive if not among the more well know actresses from that era.  If you like 70's porn you'll like this.",1485043200,,321,5.018867924528302
