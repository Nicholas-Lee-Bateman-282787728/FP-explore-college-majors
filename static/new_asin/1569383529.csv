187424,5,1569383529,"Lord Peter Wimsey's hobby is solving mysteries and here he is called into service to help ascertain the death of a ""member of the Bellona Club.""  Initially, foul play is not suspected, but Lord Peter's eye  for detail immediately helps him discover inconsistencies about the death  of old General Fentiman that can't be explained.  From this point on Wimsey  and his servant Bunter begin an investigation which leads to the solution  of the mystery of the ""Unpleasantness of the Bellona Club.""  Few  TV films can match the Lord Peter Wimsey mystery series for quality and  care in the production of these programs which are genuinely entertaining  for a literate adult audience.  Let's hope that all the Wimsey mysteries  are released soon.  Some, like ""The Nine Tailors,"" are true  classics.",959385600,4,792,5.038759689922481
187425,5,1569383529,"As many of us that were eternally grateful to Acorn Media for reissuing after too many decades the Lord Peter Wismey ""Clouds of Witness,"" just so many and perhaps more can welcome back <The Unpleasantness at  the Bellona Club> with the incomparable Ian Carmichael whose idea it was  to film the series in the first place and who almost did not get the  part!
  Like the other four in this series, this is a low budget, shot  mostly in the studio, affair; but it is impeccably ""period"" in  dcor, dress, and even idiom. The plot involves at first not a ""who  done it?"" but a ""when was it done?"" Since the vast  inheritance depends on the timing of the deaths of an elderly brother and  sister, the hour if not the very minute of the former's demise is the Big  Question. Surprisingly, that mystery is revealed half way through the  story; but by then we have a murderer to find and...well, I will not spoil  things for you and urge you to see for yourself.
  Carmichael's Wimsey  is ever the aristocrat, here ready to quote W.S. Gilbert and W. Shakespeare  (though not nearly as frequently as Rumpole will quote his favorite poets),  even though he must apologize now and then for being over the heads of some  of his less well-educated acquaintances. In this story the grinding poverty  of one of the interested parties is shown in striking contrast to Wimsey's  luxurious accommodations and ability to be very generous with his money  (which after all was never earned by any workaday sweat of his brow exept  when he posed as an employee of an advertizing agency).
  As with all  of this series, the minor characters are extremely well drawn, right down  to a patron of a tea shop who becomes all flustered in meeting ""a  lord."" While the two opposing lawyers might border on the Dickensian,  they are both shown to be intelligent and honestly working for the good of  their clients. And even the villain is basically a very Good Person in all  other respects! But such is the universe created by Dorothy Sayers and it  is treated with respect and intelligence in this fine series.
  Now we  can only hope that Acorn Media will accelerate the releases of ""Murder  Must Advertise,"" ""Five Red Herrings,"" and ""The Nine  Tailors.""
  Oh by the way, they are releasing at the same time  some of the Poirots that have been butchered by A&E to make room for  their insultingly frequent and overlong piggyback commercials. See the  webpages for those. And by the way again, a comparison of Poirot and Wimsey  would make a fascinating study.",949881600,72,2532,4.6207674943566595
187476,5,1569383529,Went on a spree and collected all the early Wimsey BBCs.  This one is excellent and in great shape for a video to DVD transfer.  Happily lapping up all the flapper antics.,1328054400,,171,4.3125
187477,5,1569383529,"The late Ian Carmichael's (1920-2010) portrayal of Dorothy Sayers Lord Peter Wimsey, is a hallmark in the period of British TV series focused on quality of characterization by first rate performers rather than innovations in the style of film-making or gritty, brutal, reality-oriented portrayals of crime. That is, perhaps, one of the reasons why each such series is better than any individual representation and why the character emerges as far superior to any of the particular episodes in his or her adventures. So it is that Lord Peter is memorable while no particular title equals him, Hercule Poirot, Miss Marple, as well as the creations of Margery Allingham, Ngaio Marsh, P.D. James and Colin Dexter, among others, continue to entertain us in reruns that remind us of the qualities of their protagonists.
In The Unpleasantness at the Bellona Club, the creative staff and Ian Carmichael, did not take advantage of the possibilities already well established, when Sayers wrote the book, by P. G. Wodehouse, for the humor in the archetypal British Men's Club, beyond allowing the surface absurdities to show a contrast to some grim realities, the unpleasantness at the Club. Wimesy is rather more sombre than is some other outings but still a master at gentlemanly sleuthing, his brother-in-law, Bunter-his man servant, and the Lady who may have done it, are particularly well done in necessarily subdued roles, while the portrayal of the shell-shocked suspect, who must indulge in some hysterical sequences, still manages to contain these within the bounds of his characterization.
All in all, a fine digital reproduction of the original 1973 four episode TV series, with sharp colors and colorful actors. A most enjoyable time will be had by all who prize this style of performance.",1270857600,,1790,5.175862068965517
187478,4,1569383529,"This series really holds up, thanks to the solid source material and Carmichael's sensational star turn.  His Peter Wimsey is all ""g"" droppin' mannerism and he crisply rattles off reams of dialogue with an effortless charm that brings to mind Johnny Carson who he resembles a bit.  Yet, he's also a thoroughly believable character played with deft naturalism.  It's a performance that should be held in the same regard as Guinness' Smiley and Leo McKern's Rumpole.

The mystery here is involving, but kind of quaint, that is until we get to the final scene, which is a knockout.",1234569600,2,578,4.86734693877551
187479,5,1569383529,"I have the entire collection of the Carmichael Wimseys, and although I agree with the reviewer who said the actor doesn't meet my image of the character, I also have to say that he does grow on one with each succeeding play--and, because of it's vintage (970's), the series is in fact more like filmed theater, which makes it all the more enjoyable.

Sayers Mysteries (The Lord Peter Wimsey-Harriet Vane Collection - Strong Poison / Have His Carcass / Gaudy Night)</a>was also difficult to engage with, but his version was also very good.  Perhaps the character is so much a creature of mind that there is no definitive Wimsey except that in ones head.

The sets are marvelous, the costumes impressive, and the music enjoyable.  Everything about the play is what a reader of the older genre, the classic who-done-it, expects the period and the ""English"" to be. It's like a visit to a past that probably never existed but that is enjoyable nonetheless.  Anyone who enjoyed the books will definitely enjoy the plays.

Wonderful series.",1205193600,,1659,6.509090909090909
187480,2,1569383529,"Well, this isn't something I'd watch multi-times if I had it at home.  Like all BBC productions from 70s, it is cheaply made, though probably exact on the details, but stagebound, in that it's all set in rooms, the set decor really nice, but somewhat claustrophic.  Cheap/regular video rather than film.  Makes it look sketchy on screen instead of precise.  I don't find the lead character to be that interesting.  Though it is still a cozy mystery (takes place betw the two World Wars) it is excessively talky, the actors physically plain, sometimes irritating, and lacking in charm.  Makes it more REAL that way, but less FUN.  It's nice to see something NEW, but at the same time, if given a choice between seeing again my least favorite Midsomer ep or any Miss Marple or Poirot or one of the lesser-known sleuths,  or watching one of these Wimsey's, I wouldn't be grabbing for Lord Peter.",1200268800,2,892,4.709677419354839
187481,5,1569383529,"I've read this series. I held off watching this because, frankly, Ian Carmichal doesn't fit my mental picture of Peter Wimsey. Now I'm glad I got it! It's four episodes on two DVD's. Ian Carmichal is terrific! He may not have the face or the figure I pictured (for some reason I think Peter is blondish, misplacing his hair in front, and much-much leaner) but he has the character down perfect. He's an extremely skilled actor and it's a delight to watch him. These are quite funny, the characters are all very individual, and I'mm looking at getting all the others in the series.",1044921600,4,580,4.586538461538462

187483,4,1569383529,"An excellent entry in the Peter Whimsey series with all of the clever dialogue, twists and turns on expects from a Sayers yarn. I only knock off a star because the sound is a bit dodgy in places and I had to keep the remote at hand to continually adjust the volume up and down. It's also a bit pricey for the lenght; it could just as easily have been fit on to two videos instead of four and sold for half the price.",997747200,5,416,3.9642857142857144
187484,5,1569383529,"Okay these are tapes, and I prefer DVDs and usually I will not give a VHS recording five stars but THE UNPLEASANTNESS AT THE BALLONA CLUB is excellent. I read the book and enjoyed it enormously and was pleased to see this dramatization.
Dorothy Sayer's plot is clever and the characters well developed and the actors and staging are surpurb. This BBC film version was made in the ""olden days"" (early 1970s) when live tv was more the norm than not and shown on PBS Mystery series. I have an idea the original enactment was recorded before a live audience.
Ian Carmichael plays Lord Peter Wimsey, Sayers upper crust sleuth, graduate of Oxford and friend of copper ""Parkerbird"" who works for Scotland Yard. But Wimsey is no lightweight Bertie Wooster (not that I don't love Bertie too!!). He's a returned veteran from WWI, as are several of the other characters in this story. Bunter, Wimsey's man-servent was his sergeant during the war, and many of the members of the Bellona club are ex-military, some of whom experienced years in the trenches and madness. General Fentiman, found dead in his favorite easy chair by the fire place, is also a war veteran, though his war was the Boer War.
When George Fentimen, the hapless grandson of the deceased goes ""bonkers"" after the General is found dead, Wimsey understands. He too had a nervous breakdown and Bunter nursed him back to health. Wimsey knows George spent many nights and days living in the trenches and saw his best friend hung up on  barbwire and mowed down by the enemy. George is not unlike the sad veteran in another tale about life in England after WWI--MRS DALLOWAY.
A major clue to the events surrounding the General's death (was it murder?) is tied to the day the General's body is discovered, Armistice Day 1922. Many old timers will ""get"" this clue, but some younger folks may not ""have a clue"" about its significance. Never mind, this is a great way to learn more about ""war to end all wars.""  The film is a wonderful period piece and if you love faithfully recreated history like BRAMWELL (with a tad more sophisticated humor) you will enjoy this film.
Emma Thompson fans will get a special treat.  Emma's mother Phillida Law plays Wimsey's special female friend (he had not yet met Harriet Vane in this book).  You may recall that an older Phillida played Emma's mother in THE WINTER GUEST.",982627200,14,2358,4.702179176755448
187485,4,1569383529,"This is a good one. A bit pricy since they chose to put it on 4 tapes instead of 2. Still it's hard to beat.

7797053,5,1569383529,"""He's been dead for two days...""

We are introduced to the Bellona club were young Captain George Fentiman (John Quentin) and Lord Peter Wimsey (Ian Carmichael) two war survivors are talking a little too loud about General Fentiman (Ralph Truman), Georges grandfather. General Fentiman is not responding and for good reason he is dead. Upon further investigation we find that the general's sister Lady Dormer has also died the very same day. Poor George will only inherit 2000 pounds. However who gets the lion's share of the estate all hinges on who died first. Lord peter as a friend and a snoopy armature sleuth must ascertain the answer and if there is foul play the perpetrator. In any case this is a most unpleasantness at the Bellona Club.

I think sometime these programs are made for those that have already read the book because you can not put everything from the book into the series the highlights and major information is all there but some of the how they got to the information is missing in obvious gaps. Still the essence is captures quite well.",1505952000,,1063,4.7405405405405405

7797055,3,1569383529,"I found the mystery of a murder at the exclusive male club, ""The Bellona Club, to be boring at first. Ian Carmichael plays the title character with charm and reverence. This is my first of the Lord Peter Wimsey mini-series based on the mystery novel by Dorothy L. Sayers. I enjoyed watching actors like Mark Eden, Anna Cropper, Terence Alexander, and of course Phyllida Law as Margery Phelps. If you don't know, Phyllida Law is Emma and Sophia Thompson's mother. By watching this series, you can see the resemblance of her mother in the early seventies.

I do not understand why they couldn't put the entire mini-series on one or two tapes. VHS tapes take up a lot of room and the four cassettes in the beautifully designed box reminds me of the hey day of the VHS tapes. The plot surrounds two separate murders and a vast inheritance. Like most British murder mysteries, the crimes lack the violence and gore. Their murder mysteries are more about the suspects, motives and psychology behind the crimes.

If you enjoyed Lord Peter Wimsey on PBS or BBC, you will definitely enjoy this murder mystery mini-series with a sterling cast of impeccable British actors.",1471132800,,1162,4.776119402985074

7797062,5,1569383529,"Since Sayers was not as prolific as Christie or for whatever other reason, her works have not been as widely dramatized at all.  I think it is most fortunate that this series was offered and that it is such a quality one.  It is one of those stagey kind of things, but as someone here called them plays, I think that's a good enough description.  I have had the ""Nine Tailors"" for a while and just got around to looking at some others.  I think I like this one better.  The thing I most enjoyed about it was the sense of well, peacefulness about it.  Wimsey is so laid back, taking things so well in stride, being such a decent sort all the while that one just relaxes and enjoys it all.  It really is rather striking that more adaptations have not been attempted, but perhaps that's as well.  It seems, unfortunately, that some of the modern repeats of Christie's Marple especially have turned them into a circus.  Again, very thankful for this interpretation of Sayer's detective, who remains an affable, competent and reliable protagonist, along with a well rounded quality presentation and casting.
