8609278,5,B002PMVPOG,"I enjoyed this episode of BATTLEFIELD DETECTIVES as much as I have enjoyed the others in this series. I am disappointed that I cannot purchase more of the back episodes, however. For example I would really like to order the Battle of COWPENS episode from our War of Independence as well as a few of the others that I missed when the series was being regularly presented on the History Channel. I believe that this series is timeless and I wish that the whole production of around 30 episodes would be more accessible for I think that this series is one of the best things to ever come out of the History Channel.",1469145600,,612,4.424778761061947
8609279,5,B002PMVPOG,"Battlefield Detectives:  Monmouth is an analytical portrayal of the archaeology from the battle of Monmouth, New Jersey in 1778 during the American Revolution.  This battle was the first major engagement after the Continental Army's winter at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania.  The video points out the explanations for the American victory at Monmouth.  First, partially unexploded projectiles from British howitzers indicate late-firing and ineffective fuses.  Second, woolen uniforms worn by British soldiers on a hot day led to more heat casualties on the British side (American soldiers took their coats off before the battle).  Third, a new sense of unity and spirit coupled with Baron Friedrich von Steuben's drill and discipline at Valley Forge fostered the growth of morale and confidence in the Continental Army.  Though the British army was able to evacuate to New York the Americans were able to claim a small victory.  This is a well-made documentary and is a unique way to learn about American history.  In fact, I use this video during my American Revolution unit and have found it to be an effective teaching tool.",1452211200,,1124,5.23463687150838
