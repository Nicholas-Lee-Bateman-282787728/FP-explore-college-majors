8762097,5,B01G24WQOU,I love the films of director Richard Mansfield. This new feature is creepy and I Think his best movie to date. I guess you could put this in the found footage category of film style. I love the low budget feel as it really helps make the film feel like you are looking in on some tragic and horrid found footage. I can't wait for the next feature from the mansfield duo.,1494288000,,370,4.152777777777778
8762098,1,B01G24WQOU,"I don't know what makes this a ""special edition"" other than being a marketing gimmick; speaking of which, this flick is nothing more than a terrible ""The Ring"" series wannabe.",1485302400,,175,4.866666666666666
8762099,2,B01G24WQOU,"It had a creepy vibe (the creepy voice for example) and potential, which is why I watched the whole thing - hoping it would actually get to a satisfactory conclusion. But a lot of it was slow and some of it just didn't make any sense and I was very disappointed. I had no connection to the characters and like one of them said, I just wanted it to be over already. I really think I missed something in the last scene. I agree with the other reviewer that some parts of the deleted scenes actually should have been kept in the movie to help the plot make more sense and maybe cut out other scenes - such as the bad ones with the video tape stalking people (reminded me of Attack of the Killer Tomatoes).

And just when it is started to be explained who the ""killer"" is (i.e. imaginary friend) it kind of falls flat from there. Why wait until now to go after these people?",1484611200,,870,4.178571428571429

I really hope someone from the production company reads these reviews.  As a huge fan of the horror genre, I think this movie has a lot of potential.  You guys have a cool story idea and a creepy childhood imaginary friend coming back to haunt people.  However, I think there's something missing that keeps the story line going.  Many of the deleted scenes are actually helpful in figuring out the plot.  The idea of an online forum discussing the video tapes and their content is fantastic and could really help the viewer understand that this imaginary friend is coming back to kill all the kids it knew as a child.

Two things that, for me, really killed the sense of impending doom.  First, the cartoons reminded me too much of South Park, where you wait to see how Kenny is going to die in each episode. I expected to hear ""Oh my god, they killed Kenny!  You b****rd"" each time a cartoon kid died.  And the scenes where the ribbon of video tape stalks and attacks the victims -- it really made me laugh.  It kind of kills the building spooky vibe you had going on.

I mean my comments sincerely and I'm not trying to play ""armchair director"" or anything.  With a little editing and adding back some of the deleted scenes I think you would have a really fantastic movie.  I hope to see more movies from you in the future.",1478390400,,1340,4.416326530612245
