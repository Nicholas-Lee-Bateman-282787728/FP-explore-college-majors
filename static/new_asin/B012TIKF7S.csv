8726617,5,B012TIKF7S,"Totally killer 3-movie set that no one who has ever called themselves a film lover should be without.

Bought this for ""Trick Baby"" (1973), a completely absorbing tale of 2 lovable con men that I will keep close to my DVD player until the day I peel off. I had heard about this movie long before anyone was even chronicling these masterpieces. Now that I have seen it I can only recommend that you do too.

""Willie Dynamite"" is a non-stop exploitation/entertainment-fest that came as an extreme bonus (considering that I would've paid full price for ""Trick Baby"" alone), and features a theme that I still can't get out of my head (nor do I want to).

""That Man Bolt"" stars Fred Williamson. If that hasn't caused you to place this in your shopping cart, do not pass go. Go directly to jail.",1507507200,4,789,4.503496503496503
