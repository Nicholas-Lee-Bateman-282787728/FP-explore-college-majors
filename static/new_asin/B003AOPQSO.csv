8393093,1,B003AOPQSO,"I watched this film on PBS. One thing that stood out was the complete omission of any mention of Jewish Poles. Poland had the largest population of Jews in all of Europe prior to WWII. Many Polish immigrants to the United States were Jews. This film discusses Poles as if they are all Catholic, not a single mention of Poland's Jewish population. I found that very disturbing.",1481587200,,376,4.626865671641791
8393094,5,B003AOPQSO,"This is an excellent program, however, there is more footage after the credits roll! Everyone in my Polish language class has watched and enjoyed it.",1466121600,,149,5.0
8393095,5,B003AOPQSO,Very interesting.  Held my interest. Narrated by Stephanie Powers and several prominent Polish Americans.  Highly recommended.,1458864000,,126,6.8125
8393096,5,B003AOPQSO,"This is great! If you like it, you should also consider another DVD: ""The Fourth Partition ""Czwarta Dzielnica"" Festival Edition DVD"" There could be more said and done on a documentary for this subject, but this was pretty good. It is a start, as there aren't many Polish, Polish - American movies or documentaries out there as compared to some other nationalities.

If you are Polish decent and have elderly family members, buy this for them and watch it together!",1452556800,,464,4.8
8393097,5,B003AOPQSO,Excellent documentary. I love it.,1407369600,2,33,5.8
8393098,1,B003AOPQSO,"As a Polish Australian I don't care much for peasant culture crap this program highlights as the hallmark of Polish Americana.  Apparently, there was a Pole, serving as a crew member on Columbus's first voyage, who was killed by the natives in Cuba.  Others settled in early Dutch New York and, of course, there were the Jamestown Polish craftsmen brought in to help the early English settlers who were largely gentlemen farmers.  Perhaps, one day, there will be a program of the history of Polish settlement and contribution in America.  This was not it.",1389830400,5,555,4.872340425531915
8393099,5,B003AOPQSO,"My mother and aunts grew up in Chicago speaking Polish until they went to school. My grandmother lived with us when I was small and was my ""babysitter"" she did not speak much English and I did not speak much Polish (My father is 100% Irish) but we got along famously. She and her husband came to America at age 16 so it has been valuable to learn of my heritage",1344211200,4,361,4.098591549295775
