7910961,4,B00000INHA,"The premise behind this video is that a maid of honor has given her bride-to-be friend the gift of a professional makeup application on her wedding day.  The makeup artist thoroughly explains each step she takes to transfer the blond, blue-eyed bride, from applying base and concealer, creating contour, and adding color from the eyes down.  Occasionally, summaries of what the artist has said appear on the screen, but these are somewhat unnecessary given that her explanations are already so lengthy.  By the end of the makeover, the bride has been given an extremely natural but radiant and beautiful look for her wedding day.  The artist then goes on to illustrate how to enhance the look for nighttime.  After the bride's look is complete, the artist works on the friend, who is black and thus has much different coloring.  This makeover goes faster, with less time spent in explanations.  Finally, at the end of the tape, two different upswept hairstyles are briefly described.  Overall, I found that this video does offer some uniquely useful ideas, such as using mascara for both your eyebrows and your eyeliner.  Although I fast-forwarded through the slow parts, I still learned some great tips.",1043452800,,1204,5.010050251256281
