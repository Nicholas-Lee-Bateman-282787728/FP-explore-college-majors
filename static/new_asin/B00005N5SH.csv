1628624,4,B00005N5SH,"The French Connection has never seemed to generate as much buzz as other Best Picture Winners, and is likely to be overlooked yet again in its DVD release, coming so close to the Godfather Trilogy and Citizen Kane.  The exception is the chase, of course, long celebrated as perhaps the best ever captured on film.  In addition to the action elements, however, there are other reasons to add this to your collection, including Gene Hackman's fine, Oscar-winning turn as Popeye Doyle and William Friedkin's energetic direction.  French Connection II suffers somewhat by comparison - Hackman is still great, but the movie seems to lack cohesion, as if the writers patched the story together scene by scene, rather than knowing their destination.  It is not a bad movie by any means, but certainly not the classic its predecessor is.  The bonus materials are nicely presented and pretty interesting, for the most part - a solid, if not particularly spectacular, package.",1002672000,8,966,5.050314465408805
1628625,5,B00005N5SH,"Although William Friedkin was unhappy with the casting of the key characters (according to the BBC documentary), it turns out to be inspired. Hackman as the fiery, impulsive lead. Scheider as the long-suffering partner who acts as go-between during Popeye Doyle's many disputes. Fernando Rey, a Spaniard apparently couldn't speak any French, but his accent is ideal for the Marseilles drugs syndicate boss, Charnier. His beard and felt hat add to his genial and inscrutable manner.
Friedkin brilliantly contrasts the luxury, 5 star existence of the drugs boss and his henchman in New York, with the poor, seedy existence of the cops. In one scene, the camera focuses on the criminals enjoying a fabulous lunch in a downtown restaurant. Then it focuses on Doyle and Cloudy freezing in a shop doorway across the street, eating takeaway pizza.
While Doyle is chasing Charnier on foot through the streets of New York, all we see are two pairs of legs: Charnier striding effortlessly and confidently along, Doyle running and stumbling to keep up. Every time we see a glimpse of Charnier's silver-topped umbrella, there is a clang in the music score. The editing and direction here, as elsewhere are superb.",1001462400,,1201,5.070707070707071
1628626,5,B00005N5SH,"It has been a long time since I have watched this movie. But I could not forget it. I have never seen a more dramatic action movie in my life. Gene plays Popeye Doyle a very highly motivated & tough New York cop who tries to crack a foreign drug ring. Doyle's tough, rule breaking & take no prisoners policeman who blurs the line between cop and criminal. The fact that this mean, brutal cop is somehow sympathetic is a testament to Hackman's great skills as an actor.
One of my favorite scene is the film's famous car chase. As a drug smuggler races by above on an elevated train, Hackman speeds along in a car on the street below.
Director William Friedkin's ""The French Connection"" is an exciting, jam packed cop action fest. Friedkin won the best directing award. You have to have it in your collection.",994723200,5,807,4.45945945945946

1628671,4,B00005N5SH,"There really aren't enough stars available to rate FC1 fairly.  This is an incredible film, launching seemingly mediocre acting careers into stardom and providing a very entertaining collage of NYC street scenes from the early 1970s. I'm sure that everyone has a favorite scene -- the car vs. subway chase is a classic and a game-changer in the film industry.  (My favorite is the chemist's analysis/evaluation of the ""product"".  Good housekeeping seal of approval!)
My opinion of FC2 accounts for the overall 4-star rating of this package.  Rated separately, I'd give FC2 only one (1) star.  It's obvious that it was made only to exploit the popularity of FC1 and I cannot recommend it.  On the other hand, for a price that's less than others sell FC1 alone, why not buy the package?  Maybe your opinion of FC2 won't be as harsh as mine.  Or you can hang the FC2 disk from your persimmon tree to scare the birds away.",1385337600,,918,4.69375
1628672,4,B00005N5SH,French Connection 1 is of course a true classic. No r is really a stinker and I need to watch it to its end to build a little bit og enthusism. Nice to have both as a collection,1377820800,,177,3.6842105263157894
1628673,3,B00005N5SH,"This two disc set by MGM packs both French Connection(released Oct/71) and French Connection Two(released May/75) into one set. MGM has released alot of these two and four pack movies in this same style of holder,without giving us the specs of the movies we're watching(see below).This is just plain sloppy and cheap packaging,and puts off those with even a modicum of savvy from buying them;never a good PR strategy. This set is a good buy considering what you get,though. The first film of course is the one you want to have,with FC2 coming in a sorry second.
The French Connection stars,among others,Gene Hackman,Fernando Rey,Roy Scheider,Tony Lo Bianco and Marcel Bozzuffi. The film,directed by William(the Exorcist)Friedkin,finds Hackman as Popeye Doyle,with Scheider as his sidekick,both New York city detectives. The scenario bounces back and forth between Marseilles,France and New York City. In France a drug lord is preparing to ship a huge amount of heroine to New York. In the big apple,stake outs and take downs have revealed that the criminal element there are preparing to receive the shipment. In particular,a couple with a record who run a luncheonette but have far more expensive tastes,are the two Doyle and his partner lean towards receiving it. The Frenchman arrives in New York with his Lincoln Continental in tow. Doyle and his partner,with the help of other cops,tail the Frenchman,whom he calls Frog#1. In the beginning Doyle and his cohorts manage to keep a safe distance but when Doyle plays musical subways with the Frenchman and loses,he knows,they know about the tails and who the tail-er is. Soon after an assassination attempt is made on Doyle,but fails. Doyle tries to apprehend the shooter and a long chase ensues,with Doyle in a car following the EL the man is in. The chase ends when the EL reaches the end of the line and Doyle shoots the man dead on the stairs of the subway entrance.
After this Doyle and company find the Frenchman's Lincoln parked on a street and stake it out. They catch a car full of people,but it turns out they were just car thieves. They impound the car and tear it apart looking for drugs. They find nothing. Scheider asks the weight of the car when it was first brought in. It seems the car is slightly overweight,even in pieces. So they look again and finally find the drugs in the rocker panels. They put the car back together and the guy who drove it originally,and reported it stolen,comes to retrieve it. He takes the car and drives it to Wards Island where the transaction of drugs takes place. The place is suddenly surrounded and a shoot out occurs. The Frenchman runs into an abandoned building where the film ends,as Doyle enters a room out of camera range and fires a shot,presumably killing the Frenchman.
The film doesn't quite have the same punch as it did back in the early 70s,and in fact has a kind of stop and go feel to it. The tough and politically incorrect language will have some newer viewers blanching. However the big thing here is the famous car chase. Not since Harold Lloyd took the ride of his life on a careening horse drawn street car through New York's streets under the EL tracks,has there been such a nail biting chase. More than once Hackman comes close to piling up his ride,but somehow manages to squeak through and get the bad guy. This film is in its original w/s a/r of 1:85:1. It is clear enough,but it certainly needs a new print struck and/or remastering,as it gets quite grainy in spots. There is commentary by the director and Hackman and the trailer. 3 1/2-4 stars.
The French Connection Two stars,among others,Gene Hackman and Fernando Rey. The scene is set in Marseilles,where Hackman has been sent to get the Frenchman. It seems he got away in the first one. Doyle and the police force don't quite see eye to eye and tensions mount between the two. Hackman languishes for the longest time,wanting leads which the police won't give him. At one point Hackman is coincidentally spotted by the Frenchman. Hackman is captured and for several weeks is forced to take heroin. When the Frenchman realizes Hackman has nothing on him he lets him go. Back with the police he is dried out,which again takes much time. Finally back on his feet Hackman returns to the hotel he was taken to and burns it down. Next he and the police make a raid on the Frenmchman's hide out but he gets away. A long foot chase ensues as Hackman tries to catch up to his yacht which he is attempting to escape on. He finally is able to get close enough to get a bead on the Frenchman and shoots him dead. Fade to black.
The ending is the real killer here. After all of what we witnessed,the film suddenly cuts to black as the Frenchman unceremoniously falls over dead on his yacht. Another detriment to this film is Hackman's capture and nightmare time on heroin. It is a long and grueling watch and gets quite tiring....fast. This movie did well at the box office but not near as well as the first one,running on the first one's coat tails. And of course we had a different director at the helm this time around. The film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and this one looks much better than the first. Extras include commentary and trailer. 2 1/2-3 stars.
All in all The French Connection is the one you want to see,while the second is a cheap runner up and at times arduous in its pace and watch-ability.",1376524800,,5382,4.660357518401683

1628684,5,B00005N5SH,"Films from the 1970s have a unique quality that will, in all likelihood, never be replicated. The French Connection certainly has the qualities that make it one of my all time favorites. Footage throughout the film of New York City are obviously authentic from run down tenement housing right down to dirty dank streets. Gene Hackman plays ""Popeye"" Doyle as the cop hell bent on tracking down Alain Charnier,  the largest heroin supplier to North America. There are no computer generated images in this film and the few special effects there are will keep you at the edge of your seat, including the famous car chase. The film stands out by simply being what it is not; antiseptic, politically correct, apologetic and pretentious.  The French Connection II is not as technically challenging as the first film. Gene Hackman is the man of the hour here, and parts of the film seem to drag on. The end of the film is quite dramatic as the Frenchman finally gets his comeuppance.",1295568000,12,975,4.763313609467455

Roy Scheider is not too shabby either.  Fernando Rey and Tony LoBianco are also standouts.  French Connection II, other than being a Hackman tour-de-force, is reasonable entertainment.  But the plot is contrived and not easy to swallow.  The intentional discomfort level from the first film follows into the second, which helps the film's ability to maintain attention.  The first film is five stars only because it is the maximum allowable.  The second merits only three stars, and maybe another half for Hackman's performance.

1628690,5,B00005N5SH,"This box set includes The French Connection I & II.  The original is of course the most well known of the two.  The movie is based off the true events of the biggest heroin bust in history.
The story follows two of NYPD's narcotics detectives as they stumble onto a hunch which turns into a huge multi-jurisdictional case.  Detective Doyle who is played by Gene Hackman, was one of the NYPD's most decorated officers when he retired.  The two detectives build their case and eventually narrow their search of suspects before finally getting the approval of the upper brass to make an arrest.  This is a great crime drama which follows the original novel and the true story really well.
Part II of the set picks up where part I ends.  What most people don't know is that part II did not actually happen.  Part II is complete fiction while part I is a true story.  Great film!",1205107200,2,874,4.487341772151899
1628691,4,B00005N5SH,"I don't know that I can offer much more to what has already been said, but to me this boxed set is superb.

Another reviewer stated that the picture ,sound and lighting was poor - one assumes that he/she was watching a very worn out VHS copy or his/her equipment was faulty - as both the DVD's in this set are perfect in terms of picture & sound quality.

French Connection 1 was,to me,certainly the better of the two and the gritty realism was excellently portrayed. Lets make no bones about it though - Popeye Doyle was not the most likeable hero - although he did seem to get results. The car chase is legendary, but to me, my favourite scene is when the camera is on Alan Charnier eating in a plush restaurant - and then pans through across the street to Popeye Doyle in a shop doorway, in the cold, eating a burger. A masterful piece of cinematography.

French Connection 2 was okay,and Gene Hackmans' performance,particularly in the rehab sequence,was absolutely brilliant. But the overall scenario was a bit hard to swallow.

First, we are asked to believe that the New York Police have sent Popeye Doyle over to Marseilles to track down a criminal to whom he is known to bear a grudge - on his own - without speaking a word of French - and,knowing that his attitude problems would aggravate the French,in whose country he was in - err, no - that is stretching credulity a bit too far! Because of this, the whole film was downgraded somewhat to pure nonsense.

French Connection 1 was believable. French Connection 2 was not.",1153094400,4,1532,4.536231884057971
1628692,5,B00005N5SH,"I highly recommend this set to anyone who appreciates classic action films. Gene Hackman delivers excellent performances in both films. I believe French Connection II is a wonderful sequel and can only be acquired in DVD format by purchasing this set. The original is already highly acclaimed based on the true story line of the film. Marseille and New York are prominently featured as the primary locations and the camera work is well done. Fast paced and well casted, this is a good way to spend a rainy afternoon.",1142553600,3,516,4.808988764044944
1628693,5,B00005N5SH,"""The French Connection"" set the vanguard for cop dramas. Gritty, intelligent and action packed, it set a standard that only a few films could live up to. Its 1975 sequel wasn't one of them, however, it was good in its own right. Now, we can finally both of these films together in one affordable boxed set put out by the good people at Fox.

""The French Connection"" (1971, R) Hard bitten New York cop ""Popeye"" Doyle (Gene Hackman in an Oscar winning role) and

his partner Buddy Russo (Roy Schneider, aka the sherrif from ""Jaws"") are a drug ring operating somewhere in the city. It starts off as a routine investigation, but when one of the drug lords tries to kill Doyle, the two cops take it personal, resulting in all out war to crack the French connection and kill drug cartel Alain Charnier (Fernando Rey) that includes one of the greatest car chases ever put on film.

This film is a true masterpiece. Hackman has never been better, and the supporting cast of Schneider and Rey adds extra kick. William Friedkin did his best film with this. The extras are excellent. I really think this is a true classic 5/5

""The French Connection"" (1975, R) Four years after the first film, Gene Hackman plays ""Popeye"" Doyle once more in this sequel. In this one, Doyle has been kidnapped by drug lord, Alain Chartier (Fernanod Rey), who he failed to catch in the last one. Doyle is forced to become a junkie himself, and hits rock bottom. When he is finally released, he vows to stop at nothing to destroy Chartier.

Not as good as the first, this film is still good in its own right. The commentary is interesting, and there aren't really any other great extras. Overall, a 4/5

These two films come highly recommended. The first one is a classic, and the seconde on is above average. These films belong in any dvd collection.",1122681600,5,1820,4.5504587155963305
1628694,4,B00005N5SH,"This package includes both The French Connection and its sequel, and movies don't get any better than this. Here, you get to see two great directors handle the character of Popeye Doyle and the cinematic presentation of the film(s) in two completely different ways.
Friedkin created more of an off-beat cop thriller that made people think. Instead of the shoot-em-up approach that the second one made, the original takes a more logical step to the action. Some of the action isn't even shooting; it's mainly verbal. Friedkin's setting for the movie is dark, gritty, and perfect for the movie. There are no lush sets; only the cold and pain of the city, which creates an unbeatable realistic tone for the whole film. The movie grabbed 5 oscars, most notably best actor for Gene Hackman. His performance is legendary, testing the difference between cop and crook and how much it takes to cross the line. His partner, acted out by Roy Scheider, is great, too. He plays more of the cautionary cop, holding back Doyle when he's about to explode.
The sequel, I thought, is even better. Gene Hackman's performance is stepped up considerably, and Marseille is just as good as a setting as New York was in the original. The set pieces fit in perfectly, creating many memorable scenes. In one scene, Doyle is randomly pooring gasoline all over an urban apartment building, yelling ""The exterminator is here!"" He soon sets it on fire, killing two of his many enemies. Other great scenes consist of Doyle relentlessly trying to make commuication wih the french and him trying to get hooked off of heroin. The action is this movie is a lot less subtle than the first; director Frankenheimer creates grisly shootouts in shipyards and heroin processing plants, all of which add as much to the film as the chase did in the first.
Make no mistake, both of these films are winners. Buy this as watch how two greatly talented directors handled a great character and series.
French Connection: 1971; 104 minutes; Rated R for strong language and a few scenes of violence.
French Connection 2: 1975; 119 minutes; Rated R for strong language, a few scenes of violence, and drug use.",1017273600,42,2159,4.806451612903226

The French conversations are so crucial to the enjoyment of the movie, that I feel the left out translations as subtitles are a major mistake for a so-called ""Collector's Edition"".
Too bad. I wish I hadn't purchased this disk set.

1628696,5,B00005N5SH,"The first time I saw ""The French Connection"" was on cable several years ago (as well as its sequel, available only in this box set), and despite being edited for television, it was an incredible ride.  It's a movie that would be next to impossible to make today.  You have a bigoted, brash police detective (Gene Hackman) as your lead, little to no explanation why he's the way he is, and an ending that is by no means a happy one.  As much as that may be a turn-off to some, it's the obsessive nature of our main character that fuels this movie.  It goes to such a high pitch that even an accidental shooting doesn't give him less than a moment's pause while pursuing his nemesis, heroin kingpin Charnier (Fernando Rey).  This obsession fuels also the sequel, ""French Connection 2"" (a rather underrated flick, in my opinion), which takes place in France.  Despite being a tad too long, the sequel manages to be quite impressive, culminating in a final chase which ends the film on a note that's almost as striking as its predecessor.  Both movies have audio commentaries from their directors (William Friedkin on 1, and John Frankenheimer on 2), deletd scenes (on 1 only) and ""French Connection"" fans will get their fill with the two documentaries on the first film and the true story that inspired these two rather solid action films.  While ""classic"" can't be really said about the sequel, ""The French Connection"" is a brillant, classic thriller that isn't afraid to leave it's viewers hanging.",1003017600,5,1497,4.730769230769231
