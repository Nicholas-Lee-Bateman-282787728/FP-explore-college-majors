2783623,5,B000NVI2BK,"The whole series is a ""study"" in Jungian Psychology.  Check out even the names:  Peter & his 1/2 brother Simon.
All the characters in ""Kingdom"" represent Peter's collective growth toward wholeness, individaution.  The series is fantastic.",1329955200,2,238,5.555555555555555
2783624,1,B000NVI2BK,"This series seems to be in the mold of Doc Martin (an excellent series, by the way), about a small town professional surrounded by eccentric locals. But instead of being charming, the secondary characters are incredibly self-centered, troublesome, and unpleasant to behold. The main character, a solicitor, is a door mat continually getting them out of trouble, smiling at their foibles, and singing the praises of family, although his is self serving and oblivious to his affection. A young man of about 11 is basically a thug in the making, breaking windows and stealing, but of course they smile and shake their heads at his youthful indiscretions, and he suffers no consequences. I would hope the tolerance for thuggery and rudeness portrayed in this series is not typical of British society.",1323648000,8,796,5.083969465648855
2783625,5,B000NVI2BK,"""Kingdom Season One"" Is a tour of the wonderful, creative and charming actor Stephen Fry at his best. Set in a mid size contemporary English town, Stephen is the local solicitor (Lawyer) who takes on a fresh up start (I'm smarter than you) junior partner and proceeds to have us come aboard his classic 1965 Alvis TE21 Drophead Coupe and follow his adventures as he assists business owners, wives, shop keepers and a few occasional loonies in town. The writers must have had Stephen in mind for this series, it lets him display his unique charm, and whimsical wit. After viewing the first DVD I immediately ordered Season Two and Three and sit by my computer in hopes of season four.",1282867200,3,683,4.652892561983471
2783626,4,B000NVI2BK,"Worth the price, however, where is season 1 for US viewers?  It's a wee bit confusing when one hasn't seen the first 6 episodes.",1251936000,16,128,4.333333333333333
2783627,5,B000NVI2BK,"I was immediately drawn in by the brilliant actors, quirky characters, and great stories of this British legal series.  You can find the first year's episodes on Hulu (as of Sept 1, 2009), and they are a delight!

Stephen Fry is terrific as the series anchor, with Karl Davies, Celia Imrie, Hermione Norris, Tony Slattery, and Phyllida Law rounding out the amazing cast. There's chemistry here!  I don't really care about the underlying mystery that starts the series, but the small dramas that trouble the residents of the town are intriguing, and the solutions are satisfying.

I watched series one on Hulu, and invested in series two.  Both are delightful, and I hope there's more coming.",1251849600,19,691,4.922413793103448
2783628,5,B000NVI2BK,This series is amazing.  It captures a lot of different human qualities and manages to combine intrigue with cultural idosynchrocies in an amusing and interesting way.  I've just finished Season 1 and I want more!  Really a great series.,1227398400,7,237,5.0256410256410255
2783649,5,B000NVI2BK,"Had never heard anything about this series and took a chance as it had Stephen Fry and was filmed close to my former home in Norfolk. Absolutely wonderful ! An old school piece of great television great writing, good plot line, good acting and to cap it all beautiful scenery. Highly recommend and cannot wait to watch the rest of the Seasons. Lose yourself in the characters and setting and you won't regret a moment.",1419811200,3,418,4.586666666666667
2783650,5,B000NVI2BK,Stephen Frye is a brilliant entertainer. I am sorry that the series ended.,1419724800,2,74,4.769230769230769
2783651,4,B000NVI2BK,"I cannot tell you why I like the show.  It wasn't anything wonderful, good acting and story line.",1419724800,2,97,4.388888888888889
2783652,5,B000NVI2BK,"A marvelous show that takes you away and makes you forget about all your troubles.
You're with family watching Peter Kingdom working patiently and diligently for the colorful people of Market Shipborough.
  Kingdom is one of the oddest early cancellations in history running only three seasons.  It was not cancelled due to bad ratings. It had strong ratings. It was not incompetent network programming directors who cancelled it either.  The company that made the show simply ran out of money to keep making it. Like Joss Whedon's Firefly, I was left a tear in my eye when my new friends came, filled my life with joy and were gone all too soon. A hole was left that can't be filled with any other show on television. But dare to feel sad.  Watch and be happy for the great and fond memories you will have forever.  That's just how life goes.",1416441600,3,843,4.586666666666667
2783653,5,B000NVI2BK,Finally!  Season One is available.  Loved this show!!!,1409788800,,54,5.625
2783654,5,B000NVI2BK,"It IS, of course, a quirky British comedy--but one that also carries a lot of important messages--about the value of family, love of community and friends (often despite their, well, quirkiness) and about one's own integrity.  The actors do a lovely job of getting these messages across.  This series will both entertain and edify you.",1393632000,2,335,5.072727272727272
2783655,5,B000NVI2BK,"Awesome Awesome Awesome is one of my favorite series and wish he would film more of it.
They show you the scenery of Norfolk that Anglophiles like me LOVE IT.
I didn't make it there , only to Sandringham and back to Lincs",1371427200,2,221,4.162790697674419
2783656,5,B000NVI2BK,Always loved Stephen Fry in everything..especially Black Adder with Rowan Atkinson..but this series was so good..and the end bittersweet because you didn't get to know who his father was...I so wish there were more..,1366675200,,216,5.382352941176471
2783657,5,B000NVI2BK,"The spouse and I recently finished watching Doc Martin through Season 5.  I in particular found myself going through serious withdrawal.  Kingdom is a pretty great antidote.  Better than DM in some ways.  Stephen Fry as Peter Kingdom is dry, real, and remarkably free of quirks.  There's a backstory there which unfolds at a leisurely pace.  The setting owes more than a little to Doc Martin's Port Isaac - is there a whole subgenre of professional types escaping the big city and returning to the quirky English village?  At any rate, Market Shipborough is quite scenic and also most satisfactorily populated by a plethora of wacky but adorable citizens.  Then there are a couple who are not quite so wacky - Peter's secretary Gloria, and his indomitable Aunt Auriel.  The young assistant Lyle seems to be evolving from wet behind the ears to cocky and annoying, but Peter is pretty unflappable and has him under control.  Peter's sister Beatrice, definitely a catastrophe waiting to happen.  It's pure entertainment and we are really enjoying it.  Definitely recommended, especially if you enjoy Doc Martin, All Creatures, and other series of that ilk (there must be others!)",1362960000,5,1177,5.010309278350515
2783658,2,B000NVI2BK,"I had high hopes for this series based upon recommendations and the comparison to Doc Martin.  I was so disappointed.  Good characters, weak plots.

Heavy emphasis on Leftist philosophy.  If I had known it was going to be so propagandized, I would never have purchased it.",1361145600,3,272,4.8478260869565215
2783679,5,B000NVI2BK,Stephen Fry is at his best in this superb British Dramady. Witty and fun this show captures the small town feel beautifully.,1359158400,2,124,4.681818181818182

2783681,5,B000NVI2BK,"A gentile series about a small town lawyer in coastal England. It's a role for Stephen Fry that one would not have expected given his past roles, like Black Adder and Jeeves and Wooster. It's most enjoyable!",1356652800,3,207,4.621621621621622
2783682,5,B000NVI2BK,"We already have Season 2 and 3 and really enjoyed these seasons.  I know we will enjoy Season 1 and have been waiting for it to come out for quite some time.  Now we will watch them in order beginning with Season 1 and working out way to Seasdon 3.  Very well done series, very enjoyable.  Have also enjoyed Stephen Fry in ""Bones"" as Agent Booth's Psychiatrist.",1356048000,,361,4.343283582089552

2783684,5,B000NVI2BK,"I WISH THEY HAD MORE OF THESE SEASONS! WHY DID THEY STOP AT SEASON 3! ANYWAY, I WATCHED THEM ON NETFLIX AND FELL IN LOVE. I JUST BOUGHT THE FIRST ONE AND HOPE TO GET THE OTHER TWO WHEN I CAN. I RECOMMEND THIS SHORT SERIES TO ANYONE WHO LOVES BRITISH TV!",1354665600,2,253,3.8846153846153846
2783685,3,B000NVI2BK,"Reasonably well done production about a village solicitor and the antics he, his family and staff get into. Set in a marvelous seaside village which serves as a backdrop for the series. Average dialog and acting. More like, but not as good as Doc Martin. Not in the same class as Mapp and Lucia or All Creatures, though. An Easy going series making it easy to watch and easy to take.",1353542400,,383,4.408450704225352
2783686,5,B000NVI2BK,"This series is a witty, complex, and lighthearted concoction of tales of a law office in a small Norfolk town of Market Shipborough (Swaffham, I'm from there in real life haha). Being that Stephen Fry has a house in Middleton (close to the filming location of Swaffham), his recommendation of the filming location is GREAT! Market Shipborough is a mutated fictional town comprised of Swaffham and Wells (a coastal town). The reason why I mention the location so much is because it truly gives that authentic Norfolk feel. The actors are very suited for this show and are very witty. I love how the barman in the pub get the Norfolk accent down to the T! Brilliant!!",1342915200,2,665,4.6923076923076925
2783687,5,B000NVI2BK,"I have seen all three seasons on Netflix, and wanted to purchase the series for my parents. However, it appears that Season 1 is only available for Region 2, while the other 2 seasons are available for Region 1.

Please, please, convince the powers to be to release Season 1 for Region 1. Thanks.",1335916800,2,296,4.481481481481482
2783688,5,B000NVI2BK,"this series is available through Series 3 disk 3 episodes 5 and 6 on Netflix.  BUT, that last story has a shocking conclusion and I am anxious to see the next episodes.  I hope they are in process.",1330473600,,197,4.157894736842105
