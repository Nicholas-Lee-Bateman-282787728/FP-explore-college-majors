But a ''feature film'' shot with a hand held cam-corder.  N0!  Not to mention the pi$$ poor lighting, as many scenes are shot in complete darkness.  ls this to emphasize the horror aspect, or does the director not know his a$$ from a hole in the wall?

Despite these irritating flaws, Rosie Gore (hmmm, ironic name) puts on a performance that makes you forget the way this film was poorly shot.  She takes you into her personal horror and puts you on the edge of your seat as the black rose killer is on her (and your) trail.",1217376000,,652,4.209677419354839
