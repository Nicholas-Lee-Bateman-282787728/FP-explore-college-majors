1742131,5,B00006CY4R,"I was a little leary of Trashy Town. But it is charming, and my son (age 3) loves it. And the Pete Seeger Foolish Frog makes him giggle uncontrollably. This is the third in the Scholastic series that I've purchased, and, as much as everyone in the family loves Wild Things and Harold, this is better.",1077062400,5,300,4.375
1742132,5,B00006CY4R,"What a fun collection of cute stories! ""Chicka Chicka Boom Boom"" has little kid letters (lower case letters) climbing up a coconut tree and then falling out of it & getting hurt (of course, the upper-case adults come to their rescue!) is such a fun way for kids to learn the alphabet! I actually had this particular story on auto-repeat for the longest time. The song is cute and the story fun & sweet. My 3-year old daughter also loves ""The Foolish Frog"" which is about a man who makes up a song about a show-off frog who in the end, literally blows himself up with pride. This story, like ""Chicka Chicka Boom Boom,"" is fun & has a catchy tune), ""Trashy Town"" which is about two mice who go along for a ride in a trashman's truck for the day and narrate his activities is also a fun story. There are a few other stories on this DVD which my daughter could watch & listen to all day if we let her. If you have a toddler, this is a must-have video!
Even though it's been mentioned a couple times in other reviews already, I'll mention it again: the songs on this DVD won't grate on your nerves so it's grown-up-friendly.",1073001600,17,1119,4.283018867924528
1742133,5,B00006CY4R,"We rented this video from the library while on vacation and had to go back every two days to renew it five times.  Finally, I bought our own.  Even more than the great stories, my daughter, who is almost four, loves the music.  I still can't get the Trashy Town song out of my head - and I don't mind!",1061769600,10,301,3.9833333333333334
1742134,5,B00006CY4R,"My 3 year old son watches this DVD more than any other. The stories are presented in such a nice sing-song way, and the animations are really cute. This is not one of those DVD's that will wear on your nerves over time!",1052524800,9,219,4.116279069767442

1742173,5,B00006CY4R,"We borrowed this DVD from our library, and both our daughter (then 3.5) and we (parents) LOVE watching it.  We don't mind watching it repeatedly.  We kept it as long as we could from the library, to the point that our daughter had the entire book memorized and could ""read"" it to herself.  We then ordered it used (like new) for her birthday.  It's not just the title book that we love -we also enjoy the other great books featured on the DVD.  As a sidenote, I recommend any of the Scholastic books on DVD.  Rather than substituting for reading books, they bring great picture books (including their illustrations and excellent narrators and music) to life, and they've introduced us to some excellent books we hadn't heard of.",1372032000,,728,4.6484375

1742198,5,B00006CY4R,"The kids LOVE this DVD!! It's got 4 main stories, plus 3 extras, and when you ""play all"", all 7 play right after each other. The only complaint is that, sometimes, the DVD will get stuck in the ""extras"" menu, and it seems like you can't navigate out of it. You just have to stop the DVD, then press play to get back to the main menu. Not a big deal. I lost track of the number of times we've watched this, not to mention how many times I've caught myself whistling the ""Foolish Frog"" song! ;)",1363392000,,492,4.082474226804123

1742202,5,B00006CY4R,"My 3-year-old boy LOVES this DVD. He loves the book Chica Chica Boom-Boom, too, but this DVD is a lovely adaptation. My son's 2nd favorite is ""The Foolish Frog"" which is a 1970's-era vintage film that's pretty surreal.",1302825600,,218,4.7631578947368425
1742203,5,B00006CY4R,"All three of my kids just loved this DVD. Of course the main title was the reason for buying it, since the Chicka Chicka Boom Boom song had been a hit that began in Kindergarten. However, a big plus was that all the other cartoons/songs on the DVD quickly became favourites as well.",1213833600,,282,4.339622641509434
1742204,5,B00006CY4R,"Hooray for Scholastic for bundling these fabulous videos in an affordable format for home viewing!  The quality of these Weston Woods/Scholastic videos of children's books is unparalleled: the production value is great, the original music and songs are infectious, and they are very true to the books on which they're based.  Each of the videos included on this collection is destined to become a favorite with your preschooler, and I'd recommend other collections in the Scholastic video library as well.  My daughter loves them so much, I decided to give them as gifts this Christmas.",1197417600,,586,5.147368421052631

1742206,4,B00006CY4R,"My kids are 6 and 2, and this is one video they will both watch together.  Chicka chicka boom boom is so catchy, I find myself singing along with it.  We all like it a lot.  My son also loves Trashy Town, which is about a garbage man driving around picking up trash in his garbage truck.  The other stories are entertaining as well, but the first two are my kids' favorites.  I like some of the Scholastic videos a lot, and this is one of my two favorites (along with Good Night Gorilla).  I recommend it to anyone with young children.  Also, Chicka Chicka Boom Boom helps younger children learn the alphabet as well.",1191024000,,617,4.3130434782608695
1742217,5,B00006CY4R,"The music, songs and stories on this DVD are enjoyed by my 3 and 5 year olds.  They sing along and anticipate the next story.  The high degree of interest by the children provide an excellent opportunity to discuss the content and extend the learning.",1190764800,,251,4.555555555555555
1742218,5,B00006CY4R,My students always love this book.  I have a tape also with Ray Charles reading the story.  The kids loved this DVD and asked to watch it over and over.  The video really makes the story come alive.  The kids had the story language memorized!,1189814400,,242,4.311111111111111

1742220,5,B00006CY4R,My 3yr old absolutely loves this DVD.  He now knows the words to the songs and sings along.  He is learning to recognize letters with the help of this cute and catchy production.,1182988800,,178,4.363636363636363
1742221,5,B00006CY4R,"This is one of the first DVDs we let our son watch (after only Baby Einsteins). We bought it because he loves the Chicka Chicka Boom Boom book. This disk did not disappoint, and all the stories were a big hit. Chicka Chicka is done as a musical video, with an added verse not in the book that is a great addition. The baby letters race up a coconut tree which eventually can't hold all of them (hence the 'boom boom'). The grown-up letters rush to the rescue and the little ones go home for the night, but mischievious little 'a' sneaks back out for a very cute ending.

Rosie's Walk is my personal favorite. An unflappable chicken takes a walk, unaware of the unlucky fox who tries to sneak up on her. Great music and quite funny.

The Caterpillar and the Pollywog is a great story, and the pollywog/frog is irristable in his enthusiasm.

The Foolish Frog is a classic. Pete Seeger is a master storyteller, and the story is a lot of fun and hilarious.

Joey Runs Away is very funny and sweet. Great narration!

Changes was one we didn't take to right away, but after giving it a chance it is endearing and fun in it's own right.

I would recommend this DVD highly to anyone with children 18 months to 4 or 5 years old. My 2 year old still asks for it on a regular basis (and we've watched it many many many many times!). It's one you as an adult will enjoy as well, and not get too sick of as time goes on.

Edited to add: I forgot to mention ""Trashy Town""! Although at first I found it a little irritating, it has grown on me. My child LOVES this one so we watch it a lot. I now enjoy watching too. Good story for little ones, and quite humorous!",1176336000,3,1648,4.17981072555205
1742222,5,B00006CY4R,"I have had to buy 2 more cd s of it because my nephew 1 1/2 yrs loved the

1742223,4,B00006CY4R,"This DVD is great. My kids both love the Chicka Chicka Boom Boom story and song. The only problem is that I wish it had a repeat feature like some other DVDs (Baby Einstein, etc.) since each segment is only a few minutes long, and they really just want the Chicka Chicka Boom Boom segment mostly. But it's a great alternative to some of the other kids' videos out there.",1174521600,,370,4.3
1742224,5,B00006CY4R,I'm a special ed teacher for K-1 and my students love these videos.  They add a visual depth to these classic stories.  Don't forget to view the extras and you can also have the words displayed as well.  I find them invaluable for illuminating literature.  Most stories are no more than 7-10 minutes long and so are great for getting students involved quickly. Well worth the price.  Students ask for them over and over again. Get the books too and students begin to engage with the books and get excited keeping up with the video.,1172361600,2,531,4.5473684210526315
1742225,5,B00006CY4R,"This is a terrific collection of 'books brought to life' with catchy songs and fun animation.  Our two year old likes just about every one of the segments.  Even when he says he just wants to watch ""Trashy Town"" over and over, if we let the next segment begin he's all over it.  A must for anyone in the ankle biter demographic.  Highly recommended.",1170547200,,349,4.40625

I just purchased it for my 2 1/2 year old son after we bought the ""Good Night Gorilla"" DVD collection for Christmas (which we loved), and I had the same expectations for this one.  Unfortunately, the only story my son & I really liked was ""Trashy Town"".  The Chicka Chicka Boom Boom segment wasn't nearly as good as a cassette tape version, done by Bill Martin, Jr., that my daughter had brought home from preschool several years ago.  It was also done by Scholastic and was FABULOUS.  This DVD version was just not nearly as good.",1170115200,,580,4.538461538461538

1742250,5,B00006CY4R,"This was one of the first DVD's scholastic released in this series of animated stories of classic children's books.  It is great, to say the least.  It is very watchable for kids and parents alike.  The title story and ""Rosie's Walk"" are my kids favorites.",1141948800,8,256,4.644444444444445
1742251,5,B00006CY4R,"Love it, love it, love it!!! My almost 2 1/2 year old daughter is a bit of a Chicka Chicka Boom Boom fanatic, and this DVD is perfect for her (and us)! She has memorized the entire song, and even acts out the parts of the letters when they get hurt.  I find the beat fairly entertaining myself, and even catch myself singing it under my breath at work. The other stories on this DVD aren't too bad either.  She loves The Caterpillar and the Polliwog (or as she calls it, the pollihog), and our entire family finds The Foolish Frog pretty dang funny. I would definately recommend this DVD!",1140998400,2,588,4.336363636363636
1742252,5,B00006CY4R,"My 2 1/2 year old daughter loves the bonus stories even more than the other stories.  Pete Seger supplies the folk music & narration for the frog story, which she sings to.  Although some of the footage may be 30 years old, the animation is clever & interesting.  This video is going on vacation with us, she loves it that much & it's not annoying me to watch.",1139443200,3,360,4.264705882352941
1742253,3,B00006CY4R,"This is a great alternative to Dora; however, it does not replace story time with my child.  I found this book for my 3-year-old last year and we loved singing the song before bedtime.  When we found this online, we thought it would be a great addition to her DVD collection. The video sets the book to music, but the words do not match the book at all times.  My child enjoyed dancing to the music and watching the animation, but at the end of the day, we enjoy reading and singing the book together before bedtime.",1138147200,2,516,4.298969072164948

1742267,5,B00006CY4R,I read this book to my nephew when he was 4.  I was not impressed.  Then I found out the sentences were actually lyrics to an adorable song.  I recommend this DVD so that you can hear the song and sing along with your kids.  It's a great way to sing the ABC's and the animation is cute.  The other stories are entertaining as well.,1125273600,,331,4.030769230769231
1742268,4,B00006CY4R,This is one of my new finds! I would highly recommend locating the best collection and buying all of them.  These are not just any stories but award winning ones.

1742269,2,B00006CY4R,"I guess the fact my 21 month old seems to like the Chicka Chicka Boom Boom video should be enough.  I keep trying to like it because the idea of it sounds so cute. I originally bought a set with book and cassette tape.  My son likes to listen to me read the ""Chicka Chicka Boom Boom"" rhyme but seems to find the drawings in the book uninteresting. I thought the drawings and rhyme in the book might improve with some snappy video animation and music--but the animation on this video is poor quality, cheap, and slow.  My husband calls the video, especially the music, ""odious."" So far, my 21 month old likes the first 2 cartoons on the video (Chicka Chicka Boom Boom and Trashy Town) but he won't sit through the final two (I can't blame him).  If you want some videos your toddler should really like, I recommend Richard Scarry's ""Best ABC"" and ""Best Counting Videos Ever""",1113004800,6,873,4.4375
1742270,5,B00006CY4R,"My kids (boy and girl; 3 and 5) and I really like this DVD and the really funny thing is that we like the `additional' material even more than we like the main attraction which is not read but sung to a Caribbean beat.

Besides CCBB the other stories are:

Trashy Town

Rosie's Walk

The Caterpillar and the Polliwog

The Foolish Frog (by Pete Seeger)

Joey Runs Away

Changes Changes

In Trashy Town two cute rats follow the work of Mr. Gilly as he roams around Trashy Town cleaning it up with the help of his garbage truck.  We were not familiar with this story before but the lyrics and topic are marvelously catchy.

""Dump it in... Smash it down... Drive around the trashy town.""

Rosie's Walk is about a chicken that goes about her business in absolute ignorance of the pursuing fox and his travails.  The artwork is marvelous and reminds me of colonial stitchwork.

The Caterpillar and the Polliwog and the Foolish Frog are in an older animation style, think early Sesame Street, but the stories are very good and Pete Seeger can really put out a fine toe-tapping tune.

Joey Runs Away is a story about how a young kangaroo runs away to find a `room' he won't have to clean up.  All the other animals want to `rent' the pouch from Joey's mom, but of course she refuses.  Joey and mom are reunited when Joey realizes that there is no place like home and hearth, and besides his room wasn't *that* messy.

Changes Changes is the wordless story of two little block people who make and remake their world each time out of the same set of blocks.  Through adversity and hardship they persevere with love and creativity to form a family.

Simply a great collection of stories.  We highly recommend this DVD.",1111536000,25,1707,4.498371335504886
1742271,5,B00006CY4R,"This is a great video for the two-year-old I nanny for. He was already familiar with Chicka Chicka Boom Boom because he has the book, but currently his favorite segment on the DVD is Trashy Town. It has fun music that keeps it interesting and actually keeps his attention the whole time, which is hard for an active little guy with a very short attention span!

Chicka Chicka Boom Boom book is one of their favorites and with the help of this DVD they learned the alphabet in two days! They want to watch the whole thing again and again which is very unusual cause they don't stand still too much! I know which gift am I going to buy for my friends' children now.

We love these songs and half the time I can't get Chicka Chicka Boom Boom or Trashy Town out of my head for hours. I'm writing this review in large part because of the comment from one of the other reviewers saying that the singer had an abrasive voice on Chicka Chicka Boom Boom...I absolutely disagree! I guess everyone has their own tastes. We love it and since I'm thinking about it now, I'm going to have trouble getting it out of my head again and I don't mind a bit.",1102550400,2,659,4.076923076923077

I read this book and played the tape with my daughter when she was little and it calmed her down so I thought the dvd would be a nice addition but the way they sang it was totally different. She had no interest in it. The other stories are old in production also. Wish it would have been better.,1099785600,2,420,4.011904761904762

1742276,5,B00006CY4R,"I bought this after reading all the positive reviews on the Amazon site, but this video really surpassed all my expectations. The music is catchy, and the way they bring the books to life is wonderful.  My three-and-a half year old son and I go around singing ""Chicka Chicka Boom Boom"" at odd moments, and when we clean up the house we keep referring to ""Trashy Town.""  Yesterday in the bookstore we found ""Rosie's Walk"" and he immediately wanted to buy it and bring it home.  This is the first time my car/truck/cement mixer-obsessed son has been really excited about buying a book, so naturally I am extremely pleased.
Even though the content of the four books themselves is educational, I think the real lesson learned here is how exciting and rich a book can be.",1078358400,5,766,4.617647058823529

7967193,3,B00006CY4R,"Chicka Chicka boom boom is a great video however, I previously had a video similar to this when I taught Kindergarten but it had different additional stories that were better. When I read the reviews for this it said it had Trashy Town & the other stories that I had before so I thought that was what I was getting. Unfortunately not and the additional stories in this one were not as animated & entertaining. Disappointed that the description & reviews mislead me.",1421971200,,465,4.614457831325301
