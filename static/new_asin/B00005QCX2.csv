7950387,4,B00005QCX2,"I like this DVD for relaxing or using as background while I work at my computer.  The music is very soothing for background and if I should relax in a lounge chair, the visuals are so soothing that I go to sleep easily.
This is my first DVD from Medwyn Goodall and I do plan to purchase another as a gift to a our daughter-in-law who just gave birth to her second son yesterday.
