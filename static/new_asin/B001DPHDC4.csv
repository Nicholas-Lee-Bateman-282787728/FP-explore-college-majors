3535948,4,B001DPHDC4,"This collection  finishes the parade of Donald's starring cartoons. I just read the bonus features and here is what they have to offer.

""Donald Goes To Press"", ""The Unseen Donald Duck:Trouble Shooters"",Two Audio Commentary's. 'Working For Peanuts' and 'Grand Canyonscope' both with Leonard Maltin and Jerry Beck and Mousework Cartoons.

I was hoping the three Chip and Dale cartoons would be released in this collection, but I guess the people at the marketing department had other ideas. These bonus features sound nice although I'm a little disappointed that what I requested is not being put on, but, as I mentioned before, beggers can't be choosers. Besides, there's always next year. This set was not bad, but it could of been better. I noticed in 'Bee on Guard' the finale scene where the guard bee winks his eye after the second hip hip hooray (after he's been welcomed back after he win a battle with Donald and saves his colony) was deleted. Also (but not surprisingly) we have another From the Vault with an intro from Leonard that can not be skipped. I doubt Songs of the South will be on DVD without an intro from him.",1224460800,2,1131,4.760204081632653

It would have been nicer to get a seperate complete series set of these and include the three solo Chip n' Dale cartoons here instead.

The two 'accident' cartoons were previously released on VHS, edited together as one cartoon, on the Wonderful World of Disney show tapes.  They do play well as one 15 minute cartoon.  Those show tapes are interesting as they have new, exclusive to the TV show, animation not on these theatrical releases.

Hopefully those TV shows will get a DVD release some day.

The two other 2008 Disney Treasures releases are:

Audubon Woodlore, Humphrey Bear, etc., will thrill in the addition of these great cameos on top of the rest of the Donald Duck shorts.  These are the shorts that I mostly think of when talking about vintage Disney shorts.  I sure hope that Disney remembers to release the 3 solo shorts by Chip and Dale w/o Donald.  Also, in the future, I hope they will release the educational Jiminy Cricket shorts that we all loved growing up in elementary school and watching the old Disney Channel of the mid-80's, before it was messed up by the powers that be.  ""I'm No Fool"" and ""You and Your [Eyes, Ears, Nose, Mouth, etc.].""  What about ""Donald in Math Magic Land""?  Will it be on this Treasure?

3535953,5,B001DPHDC4,"The first release of Walt Disney Treasures Wave 8 gives us the forth and final volume of Donald Duck. After four complete volumes dedicated to the studios most popular character, we finally see a release that looks more like the sets we saw in the first few waves of the Treasures line. Clocking in at just under 6 hours of goodies on this set, despite these not being maybe the best shorts of Donald's illustrious career, they are presented here in beautiful restored fashion. It should be noted that there is a change in packaging on this Wave with both discs being stacked overlap style with any hinged spindle. This is certainly not a change for the better, but every change to the packaging since the series started was a step in the wrong direction, so it is just par for the course.

The first disc holds 13 Donald Duck cartoons, plus two more selections From The Vault, which are always my favorites. Of course we have to listen to Leonard's intro on why these cartoons should be taken seriously, but who cares?, I'm glad they are here uncut and I'll listen to anything he has to say if they release the shorts unedited. There are two short features, one talking about Donald's transition from screen to paper in comic books and newspapers and the other a look at the original storyboard for a cartoon never produced. Both features are 10 to 13 minutes long, but interesting. The last bonus is a commentary for one of the shorts. I would like to point out that the short Bee On Guard was released with an edit by mistake, but if you call Disney at 1800 477 2811, they will replace the disc. It's a minor annoyance, but the cartoon ends abruptly and cuts out a few seconds of the ending. I'm picky. so I requested the corrected disc.

The second disc has 15 Donald shorts and 3 more From The Vault selections. Two of the shorts are very long clocking in a 28 minutes and 18 minutes. 10 shorts from Mickey Mouse Works series featuring Donald are the main extras on this disc and while it is nice to see I didn't even know existed, I would have rather had the two missing pieces to the Donald Puzzle 'Steel In America' and 'Donald's Fire Survival Plan' included instead. The new shorts only act as a reminder that they just don't make them like they used to. Another commentary rounds out the second disc.

This is one of the finest releases in the Treasure series and is a no brainer for animation and Disney buffs. While not Donald's best the sheer abundance of quality shorts here is enough to make this an essential purchase for fans of the series.",1378339200,,2557,4.471092077087794

3535959,4,B001DPHDC4,"And here we are at the final collection of Donald Duck shorts.  The majority of the content here spans the decade between 1951 and 1961.  We've got 29 shorts and 2 longer, educational pieces.  Finally, the set closes out with 10 short adventures from the Mickey Mouseworks show.

Donald was still in top form when the set starts.  He's got some classic battles with Chip 'n' Dale like ""Test Pilot Donald,"" ""Out of Scale,"" and ""Donald Applecore.""  His nephews team up with Witch Hazel in the classic ""Trick or Treat.""  The pratfalls are fast and furious and the laughs are plentiful.

This set also includes ""Working for Peanuts,"" which was originally released in 3-D, and ""Grand Canyonscope,"" originally released in CinemaScope.  While the first one is now in 2-D, the second is shown in widescreen.  Both include commentary from series host Leonard Maltin and animation historian Jerry Beck.  And both of those tracks are interesting as they talk about the changes in cinema for that time.

The problem with the set comes in the second disc.  As Donald has done to Mickey before him, other characters start one upping Donald.  Here, it's mostly Humphrey the Bear who is the true star of ""Bearly Asleep"" and ""Beezy Bear.""  Both cartoons are amusing, but Donald is hardly in them, much less losing his temper.

Then there are the educational programs.  ""Donald in Mathmagic Land"" and ""Donald and the Wheel"" might hold memories for some, but I found them rather boring.  Then there's The Litterbug"" which is really nothing but a chance to preach at us.

The special features on these discs are great.  We get to glimpse what might have been in the storyboards for a short that never actually got animated.  ""Donald Goes to Press"" talk about the worldwide comic books starring our hero.  And those Mouseworks shorts I mentioned are quite funny.

All told, there is some good stuff here for Donald's fans, but it doesn't have quite as many classics as previous collections did.",1257120000,3,1973,4.823880597014925

Donald was the first thing i ever remember seeing at the cinema when I was 4 years old in a short called ""Up a Tree"". So i was pleased to see that this cartoon was included in the last of the ""Chronological Donald"" Treasures completing all of his long frustrating adventures on DVD. I have been a fan of Donald for 54 years now, and unlike some people who say they can't understand what he says (or squawks), it's never bothered me if I can't decipher every word in his tantrums. Anyway, the DVD has got subtitles for those who wish to understand the tempestuous duck. There are a lot of generous extras on the 2 discs, including some very rare cartoons that belong to educational subjects but are still funny. See how Donald copes with the invention of the wheel or tries to understand mathematics! A great bonus is some Donald shorts in full Cinemascope and stereo sound to preserve how they were first shown.

3535974,5,B001DPHDC4,"For anyone wondering what is so special about these tin sets known as Walt Disney Treasures, allow me. They offer the complete series of cartoons and the menu screens offer chronological and alphabetical order. Want to own ever Donal Duck cartoon ever made? Buy all four tin sets and you're done! This volume is the fourth and final volume and completes the series. Again, bonus mini documentaries, optional audio commentary for a couple and wow! Bonus features worth the purchase price.

I would to point out two important factors for those collecting these tin sets.
1. There is a hidden Easter Egg on each disc for each set. If you don't know what an Easter Egg is on a DVD, do a google search. I have managed to find an Easter Egg on each disc. Bonus includes rare footage and rare bonus goodies.
2. This is every Donald Duck starring cartoon. Remember that Donald crossed over into Mickey Mouse cartoons and you will not find those in these tin sets. Why? Because Disney didn't want you to buy duplicates of what you already have in a different tin set. Remember the Mickey Mouse cartoon where Donald and Goofy are chasing ghosts? Do you really want that same cartoon on three different DVD releases? Of course not.

What the studio did was offer every Mickey Mouse cartoon on four tin sets. Followed by every Donald Duck cartoon except for the few that Donald crossed over into a Mickey Mouse cartoon. (Difference between Donald and Mickey 'toons is the opening head shot in the beginning of each cartoon.) The Goofy set contains every Goofy cartoon not found in any Mickey Mouse or Donald Duck DVD release. So... buy all four Mickey Mouse tins sets, all four Donald Duck tin sets, both Pluto and the one Goofy and you have 'em all!!!

Oh, someone asked about there not being a Chip and Dale collection. Chip and Dale never had their own cartoon that I know of. They appeared in Pluto and Donald and Mickey cartoons so if you have these sets, you have all the Chip and Dales.

Quality is remastered and gorgeous. You cannot ask for better.",1228003200,,2045,4.594520547945206

3535976,5,B001DPHDC4,"Even if you didn't get the first three volumes of The Chronological Donald, there's a good reason to get this last one. Along with thirty other cartoons from 1951-1961 is what's universally regarded as the best educational cartoon ever made, ""Donald in Mathmagic Land"" (1959). In this featurette animated by Hamilton Luske and other Disney animators, the Spirit of Adventure leads Donald to discover mathmatical wonders of music, the Golden Section, the secret of billiards, and other intriguing ideas against lush backgrounds of '50s era Disney at its modernist best. To their credit, the animators don't modernize Donald, who's his irrascible, impetuous self on this mystery tour far from Duckburg.

As Amid Amidi details in his book, Cartoon Modern,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cartoon-Modern-Style-and-Design-in-1950s-Animation/dp/0811847314/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cartoon Modern: Style and Design in 1950s Animation</a>, the '50s marked a high point in animation design, with the Disney studio borrowing some of the stark, modern look of UPA. Some of the other cartoons in this collection rank among Donald's best: the most memorable Chip and Dale 'toons, including ""Out of Scale"" (1951) and ""Donald Applecore"" (1952). Some of the best of the duck's nephews are also included: ""Lucky Number"" (1951) and Don's Fountain of Youth (1953). As Leonard Maltin notes in his audio commentary, most theatrical cartoons had been discontinued due to mounting costs, but Walt still insisted on full-quality Donald cartoons for theaters throughout the '50s. ""Chips Ahoy"" (1956) was the last theatrical feature, after which Walt moved to TV, beginning with the Disneyland TV show.

Speaking of Maltin, his intros on the Disney treasures usually consist of short disclaimers as to the politically incorrect nature of some cartoons, usually listed separately as ""From the Vault"". Here, however, he gives longer, engaging introductions, perhaps because he's as much a Donald fan as we are, and there's also commentary from animation historian Jerry Beck, making this set an animation fan's delight. ""Donald in Mathmagic Land"" originally aired on The Wonderful World of Color with an intro by Ludwig Von Drake about light and color in which he continually notes that viewers with black and white sets will have to imagine what he's talking about, as they can't experience ""living color"". This was clearly propaganda to sell TV sets (as was the show's title), but which is very interesting in retrospect. Hopefully it makes it out in a Ludwig Von Drake collection.

Reviewers have been suggesting that the quality of the packaging of the Disney Treasures sets is falling, and this one is no exception. The Chronological Donald Vol. Two had a swing out flap for one of the two discs. On Vol. Four, the discs are merely snapped, one overlapping the other, on the inside back of the case, and there's barely room to do that. This is one time when registering for the Disney disc replacement program might come in handy. Another annoying feature that has not gone away is a schlocky Disney ad that opens the disc. It really is unwatchable, but there's a booklet slipped in the case about Blu-ray, what it is, why you should get it, and, it follows, go get all the Disney Blu-ray releases, that is actually helpful. All in all. The Chronological Donald Vol. Four easily lives up to the name ""Disney Treasure"".",1226966400,5,3440,5.319852941176471
3535977,5,B001DPHDC4,"The fourth and final entry in this series allows us to live in a wondrous era in which we can own a comprehensive Donald Duck short cartoon collection. Ain't life grand?

We must instill the love of fine things in our youth.

These cartoons might be the most familiar of all, since they are the ones most often shown on Disney TV shows, but you didn't always get to see the titles. I discovered that many great Disney music masters composed for these shorts when I assumed most of them came from Oliver Wallace.

The Chronological Donald Volume 4 includes Walt Disney's first animation for CinemaScope, ""Grand Canyonscope,"" which predates ""Lady and the Tramp."" You have to see this just to marvel at the Eyvind Earle art direction that would later grace Sleeping Beauty. Also, there is the final -- and perhaps funniest -- Daisy and Donald theatrical cartoon, ""Donald Diary,"" in which the Duck dreams he marries his fair love and sees what she looks like first thing in the morning (""What'sa maddah?"").

When the cartoon shorts run out, the educational shorts and two-reelers kick in, beginning with the landmark ""Donald in Mathemagic Land,"" narrated by the great Paul Frees and boasting a credits list that easily matches that of a Disney feature-length film.

Less triumphant but nonetheless fascinating is ""Donald and the Wheel,"" which labors under a wincingly silly set of ""spirits"" and a dated attempt at hipness, but benefits from vocal work from the MelloMen and a delightfully kitschy sequence featuring Donald and a live action dancing girl on a whirling phonograph record (did this inspire Woody and Jesse's similar moment in Toy Story 2?) Fans of the TV series ""Mad Men"" with surely be pleased to see that this comely young dancer, who like that show's Joan Holloway, captures the far more healthy standard of female plentitude of the early 60's than in today's pipe-cleaner pop culture icons.

""The Litterbug"" rounds out this trio and is especially notable for the uncredited narration of John Dehner, one of those character actors who appeared in almost everything in the 60's and 70's but is perhaps best remembered as Doris Day's TV boss (""Yee-ello?"") and the radio ""Paladin."" He also started his career as a Disney animator! Another narrator heard in some of the shorts in this set is radio and Capitol children's record announcer Art Gilmore.

Leonard Maltin is on hand, as on all the Walt Disney Treasures sets, to instruct, enthuse and enlighten, as well as provide a buffer to the shorts which have, for one reason or another, been considered inappropriate for the mainstream. They are in a separate category called ""From the Vault.""

One of the most notable of these is ""No Hunting,"" likely relegated to the vault for gunplay and violence -- but such a searing satire of recreational hunting, it makes its point as clearly anti-gun and anti-hunting. It also is one of the few, if any, Disney cartoons from Walt's era that nod slyly to a revered animated feature: as loads of garbage flow down a stream and the sound of guns are heard, Bambi's mother says to her fawn, ""Man in in the forest...let's dig out."" Take that, Stitch-meets-Beauty and the Beast commercials!",1226707200,12,3335,4.871252204585538
3535978,5,B001DPHDC4,"""The Chronological Donald, Volume Four"" (one of 3 Disney Treasure tin sets being released) stars everyone's favorite irascible duck, Donald Duck, in 31 films from 1951-961 and presented for the first time on DVD in the original widescreen format (where appropriate). The shorts look fantastic; bright, crisp, and colorful.

Disc 1 contains:

(1951) Dude Duck, Corn chips, Test Pilot Donald, Lucky Number, Out Of Scale, Bee On Guard

(1952) Donald Applecore, Let's Stick Together, Trick or Treat

(1953) Don's Fountain of Youth, The New Neighbor, Working For Peanus (Donald's 1954 3D short, which was shown at Disneyland for years in The Fantasyland Theater), Canvas Back Duck

From The Vault: This is what Disney calls the section where they put cartoons that have some content that viewers today may find objectionable. For both discs, there is the same Leonard Maltin intro that does not go into specficis (which is what some other Disney sets have done), but rather just asks the viewer to watch remembering that these were filmed in a different time and not to be judgmental. The 2 shorts on disc one ""Uncle Donald's Ants"" (1952) and ""Rugged Bear"" (1953). ""Ants"" is most likely in this section because the ants are based on a stereotypical african-american. ""Rugged Bear"" had me baffled; unless I missed something, the only reason I could figure out why it would be here is because it shows animals being hunted.

Bonus Material on Disc 1:

* Donald Goes To Press - A retrospective look at Donald's career in comic books.

* ""The Unseen Donald Duck: Trouble Shooters"": Storyboards for an unproduced Donald Duck cartoon pitched by famed Disney animator, Eric Goldberg. This is fascinating to watch, as Goldberg acts out the cartoon, using all the different voices. One can only imagine Walt doing this.

* Audio Commentary by Leonard Maltin and Jerry Beck for ""Working for Peanuts."" With all their talk about this 3D short and how great it looks, makes one wish that it had been put on this disc in a 3D version with the glasses!

Disc 2 contains:

(1954) Donald's Diary, Dragon Around, Grin & Bear It, The Flying Squirrel, Grand Canyonscope

(1955) Bearly Asleep, Beezy Bear, Up A Tree

(1956) Chips Ahoy, How To Have An Acident In The Home

(1959) Donald In Mathmagic Land

(1961) Donald And The Wheel, The Litterbug

Bonus Material for Disc 2:

* Audo commentary by Leonard Maltin & Jerry Beck for ""Grand Canyonscope.""

* Mouseworks Cartoons is a 10 cartoons from 1998, with surprisingly good animation, that were created in an attempt to look like their vintage predecessors.

* From the Vault: includes ""Spare the Rod"" (1954), ""No Hunting"" (1955), and ""How To Have An Accident At Work"" (1959)

Set contains a Certificate of Authenticity (set is limited to 39,500), a postcard size reproduction of the original movie poster for ""Grin and Bear It"" (1954), as well as the mini-booklet featuring a little background and the table of contents for this tin. Hopefully these sets will keep on!",1226016000,30,2994,4.914512922465208
3535979,5,B001DPHDC4,"For quite awhile I've been waiting for this DVD.  I'm surprised that two other Donald Duck shorts weren't included. These were educational shorts. The first, ""Steel And America"" was produced for US Steel in 1965 - it's a pretty funny short with Donald about how steel is made.  The second short from 1965 as well called, 'Donald's Fire Survival Plan'. Actually, 'Donald's Fire Survival Plan' is available but only through Disney's educational store as well as the Freewayphobia shorts.  Maybe they do intend to release these two shorts but include them as Easter eggs - hopefully... Either way, I'll definitely be buying this.",1225238400,7,626,5.058252427184466
3535980,5,B001DPHDC4,"For some unknown reason amazon has mixed up Donald and Annette and while I have nothing against Annette I do not want her DVD I want the Duck. I have written several emails to amazon re this mixup and received several in return all contending the issue has been resolved which, as you can see, it has not, and the last email I received reasured me not to worry I would be getting Annette!!! Needless to say I am a wee bit frustrated at the lack of communication and therefore have ordered this DVD from Walmart to ensure I get Donald Duck and NOT Annette.
Frankly I am surprised this is such a problem for amazon, I actually thought my first email would have been enough to ensure the graphics and info matched; alas, it was not to be.
So if you don't care which one you get, by all means order from amazon but if you want Donald Duck you need to order from somewhere else to be on the safe side.",1224806400,9,896,4.184971098265896
