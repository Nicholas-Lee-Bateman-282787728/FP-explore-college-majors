While it can be a bit over the top and downright vulgar at times, it still is one of those fun cinematic ventures that makes you think about the world at the same time. If you want something family-friendly, this is NOT the movie to see. Still, for adults that like exploring and reflecting over Bombay's changing socioeconomic landscape - in a fictional, filmy sort of a way - this is your ""time-pass.""

Why did this movie NOT get five stars? There are way better films out there that I recommend you watch first, such as ""Lagaan,"" which will help to give you a context for most of the songs - which are actually parodies. If you are the kind of man who gets a thrill out of item numbers ""Mujhe Iss Pyaar Hai"" will be a pleasure. In my opinion, this is much better than the item numbers of this decade. Of course, I do not find this movie is not sexist in the least. It actually takes a rather pro-feminist stance that you will understand only by seeing the plot advance.

The movie is far better than most of the slop that passes for cinema nowadays, but with the kind of macro-perspective I am trying to take, it cannot get a perfect score. I am merely a dilettante at commenting on products, but I sincerely hope this review helps you decide to invest your two and a a quarter hours on this somewhat indie flick from India.",1489795200,,1389,4.318007662835249
