8209719,5,B000TJBNNK,"Lennie Tristano, whose music I only recently became acquainted with, is a virtuoso jazz musician.  I love this DVD, not only because of his great genius at jazz, but because I can watch his hands crawling over the keyboard like spiders piecing together an amazing web.  You will not regret buying this DVD.",1461888000,,306,4.754716981132075

8209721,5,B000TJBNNK,Lennie Tristano's Copenhagen Concert DVD is a testimonial to the man's improvisational genius. A tour de force in imagination.,1438214400,,126,5.684210526315789
8209722,5,B000TJBNNK,"For the music alone this is priceless, but the icing on the cake for me is getting to watch Lennie's hands while he's playing.",1308268800,,126,4.291666666666667
8209723,5,B000TJBNNK,"The night I first watched this I could have watched it all night. Solo jazz piano playing this swinging and creative is hard to come by. As in the CD The New Tristano, he plays the entire keyboard, with a galloping bass line with his left hand and madman-like improviseing with his right. He covers some standards that have densely hidden melodies and other pieces that are creations of his own. This 1965 concert is a rare opportunity to hear a man that rarely recorded or appeared in public. Thanks to [...]for making this and some of his best recordings available.",1201392000,4,567,4.623762376237623
