Bear Smith understands young horses better than anyone we've encountered, and she shares a lot of these insights in this video - highly recommended!

Full disclosure - we are a customer of Bear Smith's; we had our yearling filly DUCS MISS POISED NTRU (Genie) in training with her for 4 months in 2010, and my wife then showed her at the 2010 APHA World Show - and placed in the top-10 in Open In-Hand Trail.  Thanks Bear!
