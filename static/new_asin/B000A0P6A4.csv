2348303,5,B000A0P6A4,This DVD is just what the title says it is!!  It's wonderful!!  I am a VERY visual person and I just couldn't get the purl stitch from the book.  After watching the DVD I got it!!  I am so proud!!  If you are wanting to learn to knit buy this video you won't be sorry!!,1124928000,15,269,3.8181818181818183
2348304,5,B000A0P6A4,"I love this DVD.  I'm a self taught knitter and the pictures in books (especially the ones that are drawn) do not explain things very clearly.

This DVD is hand holding but at your own pace.  The DVD incorporates pauses (""push play to continue"") for you to catch up.  There are also stills (images are freeze framed) so you can compare what you're doing to what is being done.  The camera angles are great, the sharpness is superb and the contrasting colors are well thought out (white background, bright blue yarn, dark brown needles).

They explanations are very clear and precise - the booklet in the dvd provides an excellent guide and they end of every section shows you examples of what you just learned on different yarns, colors, and patterns.

The next DVD is coming out before December 2005!!!  I can not wait!",1123459200,29,820,4.645833333333333
2348305,5,B000A0P6A4,"I just read reviews of other knitting dvds, and I have to say that this one is amazing!  It's so clear and perfect in its instruction.  It does exactly what it says it will do: TEACH YOU TO KNIT!  The camera shots are so close up that I see the teacher's fingerprints!  You can see exactly what to do, there's no straining, no mystery.  It's great!

A friend had given me another knitting DVD (which, to be kind, I won't mention the name), and it was a nightmare.  I almost gave up wanting to knit, but I loved the previews of this one (you can see them at their own website), and I bought it.  I'M SO HAPPY!  I can actually knit now.

I highly recommend this DVD!  Even if you already have one, or have knitting books, get this one too!",1122681600,23,737,4.119718309859155
2348306,5,B000A0P6A4,"This is one of the clearest, best quality and most attractive ""how-to"" products I  have ever seen. I am excited about future dvd's and what they can teach me. Nici has a great future in this business. Betty Laevey",1120694400,13,213,4.461538461538462
2348307,5,B000A0P6A4,"My knitting group and I have a few knitting dvds that we watch each week, and this one has no equal.  The video is so close-up that you can see exactly what the teacher is doing.  The video quality is so good and professional, and the lessons are short and spaced out so you can watch only a few minutes at a time if you want to.

Other dvds, the sound quality is sometimes bad, or you can't really see what the instructor is doing, or the dvd is loaded with so much stuff you don't need.  This one is great.  There are a few knitters in our group who proudly called themselves ""The Knitting Handicapped"".  After we bought this dvd, they can't say that anymore!  Even they learned how to purl correctly, decrease, and fix their mistakes from the ""First Aid Kit"", and they're much more relaxed now!!

And there are two ways you can choose to knit, which is nice to have the option.

I e-mailed the owners of the dvd, and they said that two more are coming later this year.  I'll be the first to order them!",1119484800,22,1005,4.214659685863874
2348326,5,B000A0P6A4,"I can't say enough good things about this DVD. I bought it for my 11 year old who already has the basic idea of knitting, I was a little concerned that maybe it would be a little too advanced for her. No! This DVD is perfect. It gives a starter list of what the best materials to use when first learning to knit. Each lesson in the video is very detailed and clear, and allows you to go at your own pace. The best part of this DVD is that after each lesson it automatically pauses for you to decide if you want to continue with the lesson or do it over. I would recommend this to all beginners!",1484524800,5,594,4.0
2348327,5,B000A0P6A4,"I ordered this video back in 2007 and it's the main reason I am a knitter to this day.  Absolutely spot on with very easy to follow instructions and gentle support and encouragement.  The ""FIrst Aid"" kit is especially helpful.  In today's world it is very easy to go straight to youtube to ""learn how"" to do almost anything but I highly encourage a raw rank beginner to purchase this dvd.",1484179200,4,388,4.436619718309859

2348368,5,B000A0P6A4,"The color, lighting and general production work is excellent. Everything you need to know to start knitting is there.
Remember however, this is a very rudimentary set of lessons for the BEGINNER only. The price is right also.
So, get some WHITE #4 medium acrylic yarn; one ""h"" crochet hook; a darning needle; a pair of #10 bamboo
knitting needles and set aside a day to learn to knit, with no distractions.",1428710400,,406,4.652777777777778

2348371,5,B000A0P6A4,"This is a very straightforward and clear teaching DVD.  You can't help but learn how to knit with this.  I've lent this out to others because it's so good.  The person teaching gives very clear instructions.  She uses large needles and thick yarn so you can see exactly what she is doing.  She not only teaches the different basic stitches, but also how to pick up a dropped stitch (a nightmare if you don't know how).  She is very pleasant to listen to and watch.  She was supposed to make a second video with more techniques, but I don't think it ever came out.  If it did, I would love to know.  I would definitely recommend this video for beginners.  She also teaches how to knit English Style and Continental Style.  I have always done English Style (holding the yarn in the right hand, so Continental style is very awkward for me though it's supposed to be faster, at least with straight knitting.  Pearliing may be a bit slower.  Great video.  Recommended.",1426377600,5,963,4.523255813953488

I started doing the Combo Scarf after practicing the basic stitches for 3 hours.  The instructor speaks clearly and has a good diction, which made the learning process easy because English is not my first language.

Now in Spanish: Me encanta este video y pienso que un nio de 10 aos aprendera a tejer con dos agujas el mismo da que empieza a verlo.  La instructora habla con claridad y tiene buena diccin, lo que facilit el aprendizaje porque el ingls no es mi lengua materna.",1416182400,3,624,4.344827586206897

2348383,5,B000A0P6A4,Awesome. I've always wanted to learn to knit and even had my mom try to teach me when I was 10 did not work. This did though is god send. I don't have time to be driving to classes especially with a 2 year old in tow. Love how there are pauses to make sure you got down the step before you move on to the next. This is a must if you want to learn to knit but don't have time to be driving to and from classes or don't have anywhere local to learn from.,1413763200,2,452,3.670103092783505
2348384,5,B000A0P6A4,"I was amazed by how quickly I was able to finally learn how to knit by watching this DVD!! I have had several people attempt to teach me but, for some reason, it just wasn't clicking. With this DVD, I was able to see exactly how I should be holding my needles and yarn thanks to it being filmed from the knitter's POV. It pauses automatically after each step so that you do not feel rushed to keep up with the instructor. She gives very clear directions and explains each thing she is doing with her hands. By the end of the video, I was well on my way to making my first scarf!

 Whenever a friend asks me to teach them to knit, I just hand them this DVD :)",1412812800,,658,4.015267175572519

2348389,5,B000A0P6A4,I loved this DVD and Nici Beason's clear and easy instructions. I am just learning to knit and her teaching method is easily understood and her style is easy-going. I have learned the basic stitches and her section on correcting mistakes is great. The DVD is set up in chapters with directions for Continental and English style as well as an option in each chapter that allows you to watch a segment again if you need to. She also gives pauses that allow for time for you to work on a row till you are ready to join up with her again. I would definitely suggest this DVD for anyone beginning knitting or anyone who has tried and quit due to dropped stitches and other problems that cause frustration with the craft of knitting.,1406505600,2,727,4.432835820895522
2348390,5,B000A0P6A4,"I bought this DVD as a beginning knitter and am very happy with it. The instructor is young, the lessons are paced slow and easy-to-follow.  I like the fact that at the end of every lesson, the DVD gives you the opportunity to ""replay"" that portion of the lesson until you feel comfortable enough to proceed to the next lesson.  The DVD is broken down into chapters; if you want to watch the knit-stitch or purl-stitch, the DVD allows you to go straight to the section you want without having to listen through the casting-on lesson (which you've most likely already completed by the time you're knitting or purling).  In summary, I was able to follow the lessons on this DVD much easier than trying to learn from a book.  I highly recommend this DVD.  Five stars!",1405468800,3,764,4.547445255474453

2348395,5,B000A0P6A4,"I originally borrowed this from my local public library thru interlibrary loan to fulfill a New Year's resolution - to learn how to knit.  I renewed it so many times while I was learning that they eventually hinted (rather strongly) that I ought to buy a copy.  So I did.

This is the best instructional video I've seen for knitting.  Lessons are short, easy to follow, and taught for both European (Continental) and American styles. Highly recommended.",1398643200,2,453,4.8441558441558445

I didn't have that problem with this DVD.  And best of all, it teaches both methods of english and continental.  Personally, continental is so much quicker and easier on the joints in your hands but it does take some getting used to.  I'm anxiously waiting for her DVD called: Beyond the Basics.",1392249600,,443,4.475

The only reason I wish for subtitles is because I'm deaf and hard of hearing so I can't always catch every single word without lipreading. But, it does show excellent demonstrations! I like it. I would give it 4 and 1/2 stars because of no subtitles.",1388966400,,417,4.291139240506329

The lay out of the DVD is very well thought out and it's easy to repeat the scenes.
-Each segment is short and not overwhelming at all. On the screen, there is a small time scale so you can see how much further you have left of the segment.
-The stitches are separated into their own segments so you never have to take time to find where a certain task is.
-I love how Nici shares the beginner pit falls. How to tell if you just knitted or purled--it's easy with the information she gives!
-The binding sections makes is so simple.. I think that was my biggest fear.
-She allows you to chose English style or Conventional so you don't have to bother watching the one that doesn't suit you. I would suggest trying them both.

This DVD is just super fun.  NOTHING is stopping you from knitting except the belief that you can't.  You really CAN if you want to.  This is a great DVD to use if you really want to make something handmade for yourself or a friend.",1383609600,8,1176,4.251121076233184

Nici is clear, concise, patient, and encouraging.  I am easily frustrated with new concepts, and this is just so well explained that there is no frustration.  Everything is thought out so clearly.  She pauses the video to allow you time to do things, then you restart when you're ready - no quickly grasping for the remote to pause, rewind, stop, etc.  It's really well thought threw.  I will be ordering the next video as soon as it's available.  She definitely has the heart of a teacher and a real thoughtfulness in the preparation of the video.

This DVD is an excellent point of reference for any level of Knitting!  This is now my ""go to"" dvd for the things I forget how to do...  for example:
1. Adding a new color of yarn *without cutting any yarn to do it*
2. Increasing or decreasing

and a lot more!

With this easy video I was able to get ""it""  in just a few tries, easy to back up and review and goes thru every thing step by step.  I tried to learn to knit many years ago, and couldn't.  So happy and looking forward to learning even more!!",1353974400,3,404,4.0
2348438,5,B000A0P6A4,"When I quit smoking I decided to learn how to knit to keep my hands busy. But I seem to have three left thumbs and all the rest are toes and so by age 55 I figured it was impossible for me to learn this mysterious craft. At first the video seems too elementary, but I actually needed every bit of her instructions. The video is very clear and concise, and the angle of the camera catches the needles, the yarn, and the stitches perfectly. Nici covers everything you need to know, like English and Continental ways to knit, gauges, increasing, decreasing, binding off, adding yarn, OMG, just everything a new knitter needs to know. I especially like ( and need) the ""First Aid"" section, which covers all possible mistakes that can be made, and not only how to recognize and identify which mistake you just made, but how to go back and fix it, with close ups of the yarn and positions of the needles and the stitches. It is not as scary as you might think!!

Though I haven't actually made anything yet since I bought this video ( about 2 weeks), I have been having fun practicing different things with different size needles and yarn, like gauges, and some actual stitch patterns, getting braver and braver. I think I might be ready to try a beginner or easy pattern to make an actual thing.  If I make a mistake or drop a stitch ( worst case scenario) I know how to fix it.

If you're just starting out in knitting, and you hold your needles like chop sticks, and your ""projects"" end up as wads of knots, try this video! Knitting is not only a fun pastime, but also a practical one, and if you don't know how to do it and want to learn, this video can show you how.
Update 19 April 2017:  You might not believe this but now I am a qualified spiffy knitter!  I have made projects using cable stitches, entrelac, fair isle, lace stitches, and every other difficult level  stitches I can find, and all because this dvd showed me that knitting is not the mysterious and difficult craft that I originally thought. ( thanks Nici !!). If there's anyone else out there ( besides me) who has seen beautifully knitted items and fantasized about being able to do it, thinking only nimble fingered rocket scientists could do it, please get this video. Knitting has proven to be the most pleasant pastime, and as an extra bonus, in addition to meeting many other really talented knitters in a knitters group, it also helped ( and continues to help) me quit smoking.",1352073600,7,2452,4.437777777777778
2348439,5,B000A0P6A4,"The DVD itself is very user friendly - anticipates where the learner will need to pause.  The instructor's voice and instruction are clear and concise with slow step by step instructions.  The type of needles/ thread and the camera angles were perfect for actually seeing what the instructor was demonstrating.  She also explains potential trouble spots for the new knitter.  It would have been helpful to me if the instructor would have walked me through reading patterns commonly found in magazines or on websites. Even the ""Easy"" patterns can be alittle confusing to me. The included booklet is helpful but only has the simplest of patterns.  Perhaps this will be included on future DVDs.

I bought this DVD on a whim and I am SO GLAD THAT I DID!  The gal who narrates the video is lovely, she speaks clearly and gives you lots of encouragement - as if you were in the same room.  There are opportunities in each chapter to ""watch again"" without having to rewind and try and figure out where you got lost.  I LOVE this DVD.  After a few days of watching it I had the confidence to sign up for a lesson and knew that I would already have the basics down and get the most from my private lesson without the instructor having to go slowly through the basics.

I wanted to start learning how to knit, but wasn't certain where to start or how to obtain the correct needles.  This book shows the different types of yarn and needles.

All of the items are clearly demonstrated, and the knitter is to knit along with the teacher to apply what is learned. The video is clearly and consisely demonstrated, the new knitter cannot go wrong with this resource. The author takes a relaxed friendly pace to ensure a full understanding of each demonstration.

It is not nearly as good as Nenah Galati's DVD or Point, Click, Knit! and I even don't find Ms. Galati's personality as winsome as she portrays herself to be in the DVD. I tried to ask her a question once and re-worded the question over and over trying to satisfy her need for exactitude to no avail. She sent me back these curt, brusque, and ultimately rude replies. I was kind of shocked but no more so than upon reading how GREAT this DVD is....?
Nici McNally has provided a basic instructional DVD that serves its purpose - to get her paid. Sure, you'll learn to knit, but you could do the same with any Lucy Neatby, Nenah Galati, Leslye Solomon, Teen Knit Cafe, Knitting in Motion, Point Click Knit! or The Art of Knitting DVDs.
Furthermore, Nici McNally was supposed to do a follow-up DVD and lots of people pre-ordered it and pre-paid and then a year later she was still earning interest on their money and never delivered the DVDs! To my knowledge, the second DVD still doesn't exist and I mean at least 5 years have elapsed. She did ultimately refund the money after aeons of time had passed but what a scam!
So yeah, you'll learn to knit but don't expect a stellar product. The others I listed are all adequate as well and some are cheaper.",1338422400,11,1332,4.396761133603239

Within 15 minutes I was able to knit stitch. I haven't gone through all of the material on the dvd but it seems like it is missing some things I would have liked to learn such as explanation of pattern symbols and what a slip stitch is. I think for the price it could have had a lot more topics on it. I still need to get some other material to teach me the things I need if I want to do anything beyond the most basic patterns. If you are having trouble learning I would highly recommend this. After a little research though I could have learned the same things from you tube videos.,1326240000,11,749,3.966887417218543

2348456,5,B000A0P6A4,"The Complete Beginner's Guide to Knitting by Nici McNally is really great.  This is not a poorly lit YouTube video on DVD with background noise.  This is a professionally shot DVD with excellent production values.  Nici is a warm and energetic teacher, and you pretty much feel like she is in the room with you the whole time.  The video includes narrative pieces, where Nici faces the audience and explains the concepts, and the type of over-the-shoulder/detailed hand shots which make you feel as though you are watching your own hands (if you were that good!).

The best technical feature of the DVD is that it automatically pauses after a new concept is taught and there is an option for replaying or moving to the next chapter.  The chapters include:
Cast on
Knit & Purl (English & Continental)
Bind Off
Add Yarn (which also demonstrates simple color changes)
Increases & Decreases
Ribbing
Gauge
Finishing
How to Fix Mistakes! (my favorite!)

The DVD includes 7 simple scarf patterns printed inside, and a ""secret code"" to get access to more patterns on Nici's website.  I give this DVD 5 out of 5 stars as a beginner knitting resource.",1318377600,4,1141,4.785714285714286

But this instructional video was so easy to follow and use I believe I'll be knitting like a pro in no time.  I could not be happier with this purchase and highly recommend this DVD to anyone!

I spent over a week with three other books (Maran illustrated, Stitch n Bitch, Knitting for dummies) and couldn't get past the third row before ripping it out and starting over. By following Nici's advice of switching to 11 needles and chunky wool instead of worsted and then addressing that sloppy loop at the end of the row right away (instead of in Chap 3), I had immediate success. Now I can go back to the books and say, ""of course!""

The production is more polished than I expected and she is likeable. I just want to reach in and hug her!  The auto-pause is brilliant. I have not seen that in any other instruction DVD's.",1316131200,4,648,4.428571428571429

2348464,5,B000A0P6A4,"OMG! Using this DVD really helped my knitting take off! I am a complete beginner, who was at first intimidated by knitting, but this DVD is very clear, easy, and helpful beyond belief. It wasn't hard at all to follow along with each new step, and it would pause automatically after certain steps to let you catch up (working at your own pace), then you could continue when you were ready for the next step. DVD is also very easy to navigate and find different chapters to learn from. It showed different ways to cast on, how to hold your needles, knit and purl stitches, working with continental or english methods, introducing new yarn/color, binding off/casting off, etc. The instructor is very sweet and personable, and made it feel like I had my very own personal teacher helping me along in a friendly, fun, and very encouraging manner. I worked my first sample with cast on, knit and purl stitches, yarn color change, then cast off. It's not perfect, but it looks nice and I'm so proud of myself for making it, because to be honest, I didn't think I could even do as much as I did on my first try! I will keep using this DVD to practice and improve, and along with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kids-Learn-to-Knit-by-Lucinda-Guy/dp/1570763356/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kids Learn to Knit by Lucinda Guy</a>&nbsp;(which had a much easier way to cast on for me to learn), I am finally entering the wonderful world of knitting and enjoying it.

2348471,5,B000A0P6A4,"Thanks to Nici McNally's DVD I am fulfilling a lifelong desire to learn to knit.  I have tried knitting and crochet books on and off in my life, and it just didn't work for me to learn from diagrams!  Nici's DVD is well done and better than expected production quality.  At times, her enthusiasm gets a tad silly, but it's just her exuberant style and she clearly loves her craft.  The lessons plans are laid out well.  This is not a comprehensive introduction to knitting, but it's quite adequate to get you started.  Actually, it's a positive thing that it's not too overwhelming or ""too much information.""  It's just enough to get you started on beginner projects and to help you handle the challenges you will run into.  The main thing a new knitter needs is practice, and Nici doesn't want the student to get too hung up on perfection, but to just get into the knitting process and practice and learn to be comfortable and enjoy it.  There is a small reference booklet and a password to her website included.  Both are helpful extras.  One thing I strongly recommend is that you use her specific suggestions for materials for your first project.  I went to the local needlework shop to be told the knitting expert only worked when I was at work and the person waiting on me sold me an elegant yarn that was a bloody stinker to work with, so I spent most of my time tearing out my stitches that were split or other problems developed.  When I purchased (online) the materials Nici recommended, things went MUCH BETTER!  When in doubt, follow directions?  :)  I have since bought a few other reference books that are excellent reference, but I give five stars to Nici's DVD and highly recommend it if you are like me and don't feel that books help you learn basic knitting, and you want to have personal, in-home knitting lessons at your own speed and convenience.  Classes would be ideal, but not everyone has access to that.  An onsite instructor could help you figure out some of your bloopers, but Nici assures you that ripping out some of your knitting is part of the process, so you get any aversion to that out of the way right off!  Her troubleshooting section helps you to recognize and fix pitfalls.  Unlike some of the other reviewers, I didn't feel I was knitting in an hour or two.  I was flubbing around with stitches pretty quickly, but I felt for a while that I was ""de-knitting"" more than knitting as I ripped out problems and tried to figure out where my extra stitches were coming from, but the answers were in the DVD.  But I am finishing my first scarf now and my knitting is starting to feel relaxing and enjoyable.  I'm really quite pleased how well this simple first project is turning out and dreaming about my future projects.  I am convinced that the key is to start with simple patterns and progress with more challenges, rather than frustrate oneself with something so complicated that you can't get the stitches right or figure out what the pattern is calling for next.  Nici provides enough patterns to keep you practicing for quite a while on safe footing until you feel ready to take on more complex projects.  Her follow-on DVD is supposed to be coming, though I have read that there seem to be some serious problems with the release.  I have enjoyed good success with my beginner DVD, and I would not hesitate to purchase DVDs containing more advanced instruction by Nici McNally should it become available.",1296000000,4,3445,4.586601307189542
2348472,5,B000A0P6A4,"I thought it was time to learn to knit, since I was going to be laid up for a while at home.
The video is great.  The clear and precise videos of every step are exactly what I needed.  I love the close-ups of the stitches and the way the video pauses at key points.  I like that the differences between continental and english are explained and shown in every step as well.
Her voice is very smooth & calming.
The chapters are good, and love the first aid section at the end.  I'm keeping the video around to reference later on in my knitting career.  Because of this video, I'm now addicted to knitting.  In the month since I started knitting, I've made 5 scarves and 3 pairs of mittens.",1295827200,2,688,4.213740458015267

Then the next day, I watched the video again and concentrated on the purl stitch. Imagine my surprise when I picked that stitch up easily, as well.  I have to say....Nici McNally is the DVD I recommend to anybody and everybody that asks me if knitting is hard to learn.  Ms. McNally has a great voice and a great way to show you how to complete various stitches.  She also sits in front of some beautiful yarn and is very encouraging throughout the video, making you believe you can actually learn the stitches.

I feel after watching it and practicing i have learned better skills to make my knitting look alot better.  I also feel the tips she gives are great.  I learned to knit from a friend however never really mastered the skill. This is great for a beginner as well as an intermediate knitter.  At first i was having issues with the remote.  However i simply put in fresh batteries in my remote and it worked excellent.  I would suggest putting new batteries in if your having issues with the remote.

I found the most helpful part is that the demonstrations are filmed ""from Nici's view"", so what you're looking at on the screen is exactly what you're looking at in your hands, no need to reverse or translate what you're seeing into what you're doing (this is what made it easier to learn from the dvd than from my grandmother!)

2348486,5,B000A0P6A4,"I've always gone to the craft store and gazed upon the rows and rows of gorgeous, colorful, sparkly yarns, and wished that I could do something with them other than admire them.
I never thought that I could learn how to knit. All the other ways I've tried didn't work--like looking in books and trying to follow illustrations. Knitting has always been so intimidating to me. There's even a whole new language you have to learn.
I am so thankful that this DVD exists. Nici McNally is SO super sweet and she knits really slowly so you can follow all of the strange twists and turns associated with knitting. She repeats things over and over again so that you can actually learn techniques. She understands how awkward it is for the first-time knitter and she is quite sympathetic to the person who might still be confused--even after she has shown you something. Also, it is filmed really well, over the shoulder so that you can see what she's doing and follow along. The colors of the background don't interfere with the color of the yarn, she uses a bulky yarn so that you can see every movement. Also, it is packed with visually stunning imagery--piles of gorgeous yarn balls in the background,and vivid,candy-colored items. It's really pretty to watch.
I absolutely love this DVD. For me, knitting is still really challenging and difficult at times and I even get a little frustrated,but I consult the DVD whenever I have further questions. Despite this, in two days I knitted my first project and I can't wait to create another one! If you're a beginning knitter, keep at it. You'll ""get it"" and it will click. You will be so happy that you stuck with it and practiced. It is very rewarding and can even build self-esteem.
I would recommend this DVD to anyone who has always been afraid of learning how to knit. Teens and children would also benefit from this instructional video as well. It would be an excellent starting point.
This DVD is truly worth every dime.

She starts off teaching you how to use your remote.  Don't say ""OMG,"" because, to my great surprise, I actually learned a couple things.  Then she moves on to how to make a slip knot.  The next words out of my mother's mouth were, ""Oh, good, I've always wanted to know how to make a slip knot.""  I confess, I did say ""OMG.""  You will appreciate her simplistic method of teaching when you try to learn techniques you don't know.  Best of all, everything is compartmentalized, so you only watch specifically what you need.  By the way, I put my mother's knowledge of and ability to sew right up there next to Martha Pullen, so she is not without her talents.

It wasn't as easy as watching it once and being able to immediately knit.  The set up of the DVD was great in that you could easily go back and watch each step as many times as needed.  It was broken down into small enough sections that I didn't have to sit through a bunch of steps I already knew.  I could watch exactly the step I needed until I learned how to do it.

Another important feature was that all the steps were available in both Continental and English style.  I absolutely hated English style so without both I probably would have given up on knitting right away.

This DVD is limited to the basics.  You won't find advanced techniques here but that's not the purpose of this DVD.  I learned the basics well enough that I can pick up some knitting books and actually understand them.  I wish there was a sequel with more advanced techniques as I have yet to find something that explains these as clearly as the basics where explained here.

With someone who is so thoughtful you know you're getting a thorough and patient teacher and she is all of those things and more. I was happy to see that all of the video's of actual knitting were very close up and with yarn that was bulky enough to see each individual stitch. The DVD menu is set up just right into categories that are easy to understand and navigate. I don't have any complaints. She was definitely new to the camera, but that's what made me feel at ease and fall in love with the process itself.

That same day I was able to speed up and begin a scarf and when I dropped a stitch, I was able to go right to Nici's first-aid kit and learn how to pick it up.

What was harder to learn in person, because the teacher(s) either went too fast and I was unable to see exactly what was happening, or too embarassed to ask a 2nd or 3rd time, was easy with this dvd.  I could pause it, look at all the particulars, such as where the yarn should be hanging, imitate it and repeat it if necessary. You don't even have to manually rewind - she includes a ""show me again"" option at the end of every step. She even covers common mistakes and pitfalls before you have a chance to make them. Excellent!

This particular DVD is uniquely excellent in that it pauses itself for about 3 seconds after it shows you something tricky, giving you enough time to regroup, then restarts itself and continues.  Additionally, at the end of logical sections, it pauses indefinitely until you manually unpause it to go to the next section.  This is invaluable.  This DVD production uses all the strengths of the DVD format to its advantage.

I'd tried free internet videos and while they were excellent, the inability to pause or slow motion hindered me.  Also, the video is superior to the American Knitter series (which is also pretty good) in terms of the cleanness of production.  The backgrouds are all white, close-up and the hostess is very wholesome looking, as opposed to the American Knitter hostess sitting in a darker room with less than optimum colored yarn and very long fingernails that seem to distract and upset a lot of reviewers!  I was able to learn from her despite those objections, but the difference between the two is like using a dictionary for reference like this DVD, or using targeted paragraphs of fiction with words in context, yet not as reference-like - like the American Knitter program. The American Knitter multi disc does go farther in depth, but this DVD here is the cleanness, easiest way to learn to knit properly that I've ever seen!  Thanks.",1232496000,4,2170,4.711640211640212

I'm terrible at learning from a book where there's still photos or drawings on how the hand should lay n such.  I learn by real action.  I love how I also get to view the work from a top-sided view.  That's so different and gives a close view that I can't make a mistake.  The playback function works great compared with other DVDs which requires me to go through a non-user friendly menu screen.  By the time I press each function, I'm finally at the play back option, but I'm already frustrated and just turn off the DVD.  Of course, not this DVD.  I already recommended this one to my friend's young teenage daughter.  She has her needles and yarn.  She's just waiting for that DVD to arrive.",1232323200,,762,4.449275362318841

Over the years I've tried on my own, and always gave up. Now that I'm about to be a grandmother I decided I had to learn and bought this dvd. I've cast on, I've knit about 30 inches of the blanket, I've even corrected several mistakes.

What good is it if you knit something and you can't fix your mistakes. Why bother trying right? She only shows 1 version of ""correcting your mistakes"" when there are many ways to make a certain mistake. It all depends on what stitch your trying to correct, it might be in the front, back, middle etc.  I think you really need to have an actual person to show you how to knit. It took me a solid week to figure out how to do the knit stitch because you can't see what's behind her hands on a TV and she doesn't address where the yarn is supposed to be when you start. I was also counting on the ""Tips and Advise"" section of the DVD....guess what it was only 45 seconds long.

When she made this DVD she should have gone to a beginner knitting and ask her what questions that person has and put THAT in the DVD. I have to find another DVD that explains everything to me.

Nici is such an enthusiastic and patient teacher, and the pacing of the DVD is just perfect.  Moves are introduced very slowly, with extremely helpful words and demonstrations.  Within minutes, I was knitting!  Wahoo!  I especially enjoy her First Aid Kit chapter, where she teaches you to spot your mistakes and unknit.

2348533,5,B000A0P6A4,"This is a wonderful, highly-recommended DVD for beginning knitters!!

I began knitting about a year ago and have been slowly building my skills.  I first learned from a book and was confused by the various written instructions: ""put your needle through the front of the stitch,"" ""loop the yarn around the needle,"" etc.  What, exactly, is the front of the stitch?  Loop the yarn from left to right or from right to left around the needle?  The accompanying photographs helped little. I did finally learn, through trial and error (mostly error) and feel that I've come a long way, although I'm still at the so-called ""scarf stage.""  I wanted to expand my skills and learn how to make more than long rectangles, and I also wanted some help with problems I was having (picking up dropped stitches, knitting with consistent tension, etc.), so I put a few basic knitting books on my Amazon wish list. Luckily, I received none of the books I wanted and instead was gifted Nici's DVD.

This is by far the best ""learn to knit"" guide I have come upon. Having an actual video of basic knitting is such a great way to learn (and, in my case, re-learn the basics). I have only watched the first three chapters, but already I am in LOVE with the DVD and Nici's style of teaching.  It is like being in a one-on-one class, but even better since you get such patient but enthusiastic instruction from Nici and can watch segments as many times as you like.

The close-ups of the actual knitting segments are fantastic: the dark wood needles with light-colored yarn against a stark white background make for excellent visibility, and the tight shots that accompany the instructions of what NOT to do (knit through the middle, through the row below, etc.) make it very clear what is meant by ""put your needle through the front of the stitch.""  She even highlights in yellow what exactly is the 'front' of the stitch and what is the 'back'!  It may sound silly, but it really did help me to visualize the different parts of the stitch. She specifically instructs to wrap the yarn counter-clockwise around the needle and cautions that the last stitch of the row is always loose (another pitfall I could have avoided - by _not_ trying to tighten up that last stitch!)  Nici has a natural, casual way of instructing; you can tell she is a pro at it.  She does not dryly read from a script, but rather instructs like she is standing right in front of you and talking from her years of experience.

If I had had this DVD a year ago, my first creations wouldn't have mysteriously increased (I fell prey to the ""Beginner's Boobytrap"" many times!) and my stitches would not have sometimes looked funny (because I was knitting through the middle).  Even though I have been knitting for a while, I have finally learned how to perfect the basic knit and purl, and I am looking forward to learning the right way to increase, decrease, tie new yarn on and finish. I was planning on taking a class at my local knitting store, but now I don't need to since Nici covers everything I was confused about.

If I had a friend who wanted to learn how to knit, I would purchase them this DVD without hesitation.  And, I can't wait for Nici's ""Beyond the Basics"" DVD to come out!",1199059200,2,3235,4.540447504302926

But I was able to follow the clear, and simple instructions presented in this DVD!  I loved sitting in front of the TV with my DVD remote by my side, knitting needles in my hands and yarn hanging from my fingers!  I was knitting in just a few minutes and am absolutely hooked on it!  That was two weeks ago and now I want to try new things and wish that I could find a DVD format for some more advance techniques.

I most appreciated the way the DVD is set up and the personality of the teacher.  She is very pleasant, talks slowly enough to be easily understood without being annoying or condescending.  I felt like I was learning from an aquaintance . . . one with a lot of patience!  The DVD stops at just the right moments and you can easily repeat sections as many times as you need to or jump to whatever interests you.  There is an ""emergency"" secion that is invaluable!  I was adding stitches like mad until she showed me exactly where I went wrong -- turns out it is a common mistake and very easy to correct once you see her clear explanation and video.

Just a terrific resource that I will probably be coming back to frequently.  I am not a big 'scarf' person and that is the only project included in the little booklet included with the video.  But she teaches the basics of knitting and purling which is all it takes to create various patterns (garter, stockinette, seed, basket weave, etc.).  Rather than full-fledges scarves, I made short ""scarves"" using cotton yarn and called them dish clothes.  I also tried various patterns and combinations on with other types of yarn we had around the house and my daughter has happily employed these as blankets for her hundreds of beanie babies.  There is a LOT you can do with a simple scarf pattern even if you're not a scarf person!

There is even a first aid

every step of the way, in a friendly and easy to understand way.
This dvd has close ups of the knitting so you can see what she
is doing very easily.

I also do not have to pay someone to show me something that takes a couple of seconds to get.  I don't understand why Yarn store owners don't give of their time.  If you buy yarn in their store, they should give you help with the project without cost.  Wouldn't they be busier if they did this?

Anyway, Nici has solved this problem.  Now if only she would get the more advanced DVD out I could make something more than a scarf!  Keep up the good work Nici.",1189468800,,615,4.024793388429752

You will learn all the basics in this DVD including how to repair and prevent mistakes!  The DVD is set up so that you can easily follow along.  At key points, the DVD pauses so that you can catch up or replay as needed.  You also get access to free patterns on her website.

The only drawback I had with this is that the original DVD I ordered was defective.  It was quickly replaced, though, and I am happy as can be with it!  I can't wait for her next DVD to become available!!",1185408000,,624,4.228813559322034

Camera angles are very close and sharp for all stitches.  Excellent sections on finishing (mattress stitch) and increasing and decreasing. Not just quick demo's, but full and complete instructions.  Also excellent are the instructions for both English and continental knitting styles.  Cannot wait for her next DVD (Beyond the Basics) to hit the market.",1183593600,2,527,5.0813953488372094

I also bought some books, took some out of the library on loan, but books just don't help a raw beginner.  With the DVD, you can go back to the section over and over and you can pause it, and knit right along with Nici.  She's so cute and perky.  This is VERY basic, but it gets you going and it comes with instructions for making scarves, which is usually the first item a knitter learns to make.  I would even recommend it for a child.",1181520000,4,562,4.0636363636363635

Nici's clear demonstrations, instructions and hints + being able to ""see it again"" was much more conducive to my learning style.  I also liked not having music playing in the background while she was instructing.  I have watched other knitting DVDs' that had music during instruction and I found it rather distracting.  I have made several projects using this DVD; I have watched the entire DVD several times in the 6 weeks since I bought it.  I know I will use it again to review and to keep improving my skills.

Instead of showing the person doing the knitting they only show the hands doing the technique, which makes following along very easy. My 4 year old would look at the TV and then to me to see if I was doing it properly. You can pause during the instruction or replay it easily. The instruction is broken down into easy segments, including how to make a slip knot. I am amazed how easy this makes learning to knit ( I tried Knitting for Dummies with little success).

2348576,5,B000A0P6A4,"I LOVE this DVD!  I've looked at books, online instruction, and even had a family member try to teach me.  None of those methods worked for me.  The way Nici goes about teaching is like having a friend come over to give instructions.  She is very clear and goes slowly.  The DVD pauses in places so you can go ahead and then press play when you are ready. She teaches two methods, English and Continental.  We chose Continental.  I found out why my family member could not teach me.......she does English, and I'm all thumbs that way.  So having both shown gives you the ability to select which works best for you.  The only thing for a beginner that I found difficult was casting on.  The DVD shows 3 ways of slip knotting to start, but does not show where the tail should go....front or back?  My mom came over to show us - after casting on the tail goes in the front.  This is where you will be using the yarn from the cast on your first 10 loops.....when you turn the needle around as you switch hands, your tail will be in the back where it needs to be.  I know that sounds simple, but for a beginner it was a conundrum!! If the tail is in the front, you run out of yarn!  Other than that tiny detail....every detail for knitting and purling is covered well!! There are close up angles and it is show ""over the shoulder"" so you are not watching her knit and then try to reverse it.  If you want to learn to knit......buy this DVD...within a short while you'll be knitting away!
Nici covers the following:
Casting on - how to get started
the knit stitch - continental or english
The purl stitch - continental or english
add yarn - if you run out or want to add a color etc..
binding off - how to end
ribbing - how to knit and purl on the same row
increasing - adding stitches
decreasing - taking away stitches
gauge - how many stitches per inch to get the right size
finishing - sewing pieces together
first aid kit - HELP for mistakes
tips and advice - tips and advice :)

Nici McNally is extremely patient and teaches very clearly. I'm a visual learner so I needed someone to painlessly teach me over and over again through repetition before I get it. After watching the DVD for 10 minutes, I was able to start doing continental knitting and started my scarf project in no time!

I'm so impressed.... with this dvd!  If she can do that, anyone can.  And so, I did.  I had almost given up trying to learn from dvd's because I bought a couple of others from here on Amazon (my mother taught me that if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all, so I won't name them!) and they were so bad I threw them in the trash.

Everything is so clear and easy on this dvd and the lessons are perfect. My daughter is knitting herself a ""blanket"" for our Yorkie (really just a big square, but she's happy!), and I've started a scarf.  We're both knitting along great, and there seems to be a lot more on this dvd waiting for us to learn, and I can't wait until we get there!

I'M KNITTING!!!!!  I can't believe it!  I didn't think i could do it.  The instruction is so great and it paused to wait for me at different spots.  It's so clear and close-up that I could see everything the teacher was doing and follow along.  The buttons are clear and simple and the teacher explains everything perfectly.  And she's so encouraging!

I started the baby blanket and it looks way better than one of my coworkers first projects (she took a class). I showed her the dvd and she said that the class she took didn't teach as well as this dvd.  The teacher on the dvd shows you mistakes to watch for, how to hold the needles correctly, how to get comfortable with the yarn and hold it your own way if you like.  I've learned how to knit, purl, and I can cast on.  And I fixed my own mistake!  I did what they call ""drop a sittch"" and I fixed it without starting over!  That alone is worth the whole dvd!  There's more on this dvd that I scanned through and it looks super great, but I'll get to it on my next project.  A baby sweater!!

I can't wait to fnish my blanket.  I'm so happy to be making something for my sister's baby!!!  What a great dvd, I recommend it to everybody who wants to knit!!  And I can't wait for their second one to come out!!",1160784000,8,1427,4.123636363636364
2348582,5,B000A0P6A4,"After several attempts to teach myself knitting through books, I came across this DVD on eBay and purchased it from her directly, based on the excellent feeback she has received for this.  My first disc was defective, but when I contacted Nici, she responded immediately, and I had a new replacement DVD within a few days!

She mentioned that one of the batches of discs had been defective, but that the problem discs have since been eliminated.  It may be that Amazon still has some of these defective discs mixed in to their stock - I do not think it is fair to criticize Nici for these damaged discs, as she went out of her way to make sure I had a working DVD and was happy.  I think she's a great professional with regard to her business, and purchasing this DVD has been a very positive experience!

The video is extremely well done and very easy to follow!  Nici is an excellent teacher, and explains things in very simple-to-understand terms.  The knitting demonstrations are done from your point of view - slow and clear, with just enough repetition to allow you to understand what is going on.  The pause feature that is built in, along with a feature that allows you to repeat directions is awesome!

I was literally casting on and doing the knit stitch in only 5 minutes!  As an avid crocheter who never thought I'd actually be able to learn how to knit, I'm just thrilled to find an instructor who has made knitting so easy!  I will be purchasing her follow-up DVD when it comes out next month.

Absolutely worth the money and highly recommended!",1159228800,7,1559,4.5285714285714285

Reluctantly she showed me how and I just knew in her mind she was thinking I would never learn.  So behind her back I bought this DVD and learned the basics. On a recent trip with her, my fingers were flying as I was casting on and she was amazed.  I wasn't doing it they way she had taught me. She said she didn't teach me that way because she thought it would be too complicated for me!  HA! Ye of little faith...Now when my daughters are older they too can learn how to knit and I will have something to pass on to them.  I look forward to buying the next DVD!

I've pre ordered two, one for me and one for my local library. If you want to learn from scratch or are in between beginner and intermediate you can't go wrong having this in your library of knitting instructions.

She covers all the basics.  You really can knit, purl, fix mistakes and join seams after viewing.  She demonstrates both Continental and English styles.

I learned a better cast-on technique, learned proper names for stitches, and it demystified all those abbreviations.  After going through it once I found I could follow simple patterns and cranked out three sweaters in three weeks.  I feel more confident now about my abilities and each project teaches me something and turns out better then the last.  I am able to hide mistakes, tweak the pattern for a better fit and have recommended the DVD to another friend.

I thought the DVD was simple to use and moving through the chapters was very easy.  In fact after taking a break for several months,  I realized I had forgotten how to cast-on and got out the DVD - in a matter of minutes I was back on track.

My girlfriend purchased this DVD for me for my B-day and I can honestly state that I have not only learned how to do basic knitting, but I have already moved on to more advanced knitting projects.  I love the fact that you truly learn at your own pace just with the touch of the remote you can review anything over and over again.

I went to different websites for instruction but they were never clear. Then I happened on this video and am so happy I ordered it.

She is a great teacher and it shows exactly how she is doing it and you can pause and play back as often as you need to. All you have to do is keep the remote handy and get comfortable and get ready to learn.

I would highly recommend this video to anyone who has forgotten or never learned how to knit.  Thanks so much, Nici!! Great job!

2348614,5,B000A0P6A4,"1. This is a LEARNING TO KNIT DVD. It's basic, simple, with crisp clear video, vibrant colors for contrasting yarn and needles. When you learn to knit, it can be daunting. This video shows you everything you need to get started: how to knit continental vs english, how to guage, how to knit and purl, how to combine various knitting and purling stitches, what the reverse

of each piece looks like, and even how to seam a sweater.

2. Unlike Stitches in Motion, this dvd is NOT a collection of various stitch patterns from cables to lace... that's in Nici's second DVD - the more advanced one. Besides, just like there are a zillion different stitch pattern books - no one dvd can encompass them all.

3. I have seen other DVDs - this one is easy to understand, allows you to control the pace at which you learn, has chapters set up so you don't have to rewatch the entire dvd to get back to a certain point, and even has places where she says ""You can pause here to compare your work to mine, or to catch up"" and when you pause there's a crisp image of the work on screen.

4. the QUALITY of the video is amazing. I can not express enough how important the clarity and the color of yarn and needles is. She uses wooden needles so there's no reflection from the lights in the studio (something that would happen if she used metallics). She uses large yarns and needles to provide a very clear representation of work. When you think about it, if

you knit on very tiny needles - the product is basically the same as if you knit on large ones. So, she knits on large ones because you can see better what the stitches will look like and what she's doing.

5. the HIGHLIGHTS of the work... she puts in a contrasting highlight (orange) over the yarn, to show you exactly what she's talking about. THis is much better than the ""let me point with me needle"" method. If you're new to knitting, you're not going to be able to see what someone who's been knitting for 14 years sees.

ANYONE CAN LEARN TO KNIT FROM THIS DVD!

2348615,5,B000A0P6A4,"High Marks for this DVD.  This DVD is professionally filmed compared to other DVD's I have viewed. As a matter of fact, it is the most professional I have viewed to date. This DVD is one of the better ones out there. Most, but not all, are very poor in content, filming and appearance. Some have long lapses of time without instruction or discussions. I even came across one DVD production with outrageous errors, I have since returned that one for a refund.

Nici's DVD demonstrates, and discusses in detail all the knitting steps needed to make your item, it is done with great clarity, instruction and filming, the camera is steady and the voice is pleasing to hear.

Nici is pleasant to watch, she comes across very concerned that you understand what is being taught.  It's as if she is right with you while you are learning.  I had a question about a separate project, and surprisingly I received an answer quickly, and I was able to go on with my project.  Mind you, this wasn't even connected to the DVD.  That in itself is outstanding customer service.  I recommend this DVD very highly, it is worth every penny spent.  I have ordered the upcoming 2nd DVD due out very soon because of the quality and content of the first one.  I can't wait for it to come out.  I do not have any association with this DVD or it's production.

My library contains a lot of Knitting AND Crocheting DVD's, this is one of the better ones.  My mom said, if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything.  As you can see, this is my only review.

On a separate issue, to learn various stitches, I highly recommend the Knitting Glossary DVD by Elizabeth Zimmermann.  It is not a learn to knit DVD, but absolutely a must in any knitter's library to follow along and learn the many stitches that can be applied to various projects.  After you learn to knit, then try to obtain this copy from the master of knitting.

Thank you Nici, for offering a great knitting DVD.  In my opinion, this is one of the best out there.",1156204800,15,2011,4.430517711171662
2348616,5,B000A0P6A4,"I have taught myself how to sew, quilt, weave baskets, make candles, paint and to make dolls, but knitting was one craft I simply could not figure out. That is until I bought this product. It was very informative and well thought out. I truly appreciate Nici sharing her knowledge and experience with those of us who want to learn.

I have a local knitting shop in my area, but have never felt very comfortable trying to learn in a group or class environment. This way I was able to learn in the privacy of my own home and at my own pace. Thank you for such a wonderful prodcut!",1156204800,12,578,4.254545454545455

I was twice as frustrated being a lefty. But as soon as I watched Nici do it I could too!! Why would you want the pattern on the screen? I want to see her knit, not read a pattern!  I've pre-ordered her 2nd DVD and can't wait for it to arrive.  I'm also leaving this review because she and her team are concerned about the one bad review. Wow, now that's service!",1156204800,10,515,4.23469387755102
2348618,5,B000A0P6A4,"I made this purchase and had NO trouble at all!  The DVD is fun to watch and is VERY informative!

Nici speaks very well and explains everything very well.  I have also found that if I did have a question, she is only an e-mail away and very helpful and detailed in her responses!

You are not TAKING A CHANCE purchasing this DVD...it is the best way to learn, or in my case, re-learn the art of knitting!

I have been more than satisfied with is buying experience and very much look forward for the second DVD to come out!  :-)

5 STARS ALL THE WAY!!!!",1156204800,10,553,4.160377358490566
2348619,5,B000A0P6A4,"I purchased this DVD having taught myself to knit 20 years ago from illustrations in a book. After taking a rather lengthy break from the craft, I have a renewed interest and wanted to make sure I was knitting the right way. I thought it would be great to see knitting in action. I am extremely pleased with this DVD. I feel like Nici is a friend sitting in the room with me. While I am not a true beginner, Nici's instructions are so thorough that I can easily see a beginner being able to pick right up on it. You can review the process at your own pace (pause and rewind, if necessary) and mirror her actions with your own hands. I will definitely be purchasing her new, more advanced DVD when it becomes available! I highly recommend this DVD!",1156204800,11,747,4.304964539007092
2348620,5,B000A0P6A4,"I purchased this DVD having no knitting experience at all and it was been a wonderful guide that so far has allowed me to finish 3 beautiful sweaters in only 8 weeks.  Nici McNally really explains the steps and stitches in a simple way that a beginner can easily understand and the close-ups of the techniques make learning them a piece of cake!  I frequently turn on the DVD when I'm stuck on a particular part of a pattern or just need to refresh on finishing techniques, etc.  It's easy to just pause while you practice and continue when you're ready-so learning is very much at your own pace.  I had no problems at all playing the DVD.  As for the reviewer who complained about pattern instructions not being on the screen--I disagree completely.  I would much prefer the pattern instructions in a booklet so I can take it with me when I knit on the go.  I have numerous knitting ""how-to"" books, but always prefer to use the DVD instead because seeing someone actually knit is much easier than reading about it.  And for the record--I Do Not work for Nici McNally and I doubt the other reviewers do either!",1156204800,10,1110,4.487562189054726
2348621,5,B000A0P6A4,"I first purchased this DVD in December 2005 and learned to knit immediately.  I was able to knit 3 scarves for Christmas gifts just within a week after learning through this DVD.  However, the first copy I received did not play properly.  I contacted Nici and immediately got a response and a new DVD.  That one worked just fine until my husband scratched it (he claims he didn't, and liked to point out the first one was faulty) and the player was unable to read it.  And BTW, my husband has commented on Nici's style, saying, ""How'd she get so good at teaching when she looks so young?"" but he refuses to knit. oh well. So I am on my third copy, and I would continue to replace it if needed because the instruction is so clear, Nici is so personable that you'd think she was right there knitting with you, and the Chapter set up is great.  The DVD automatically pauses after showing you a new technique, and then when you are ready you press play.  So you never fall behind like in a class!  There's a first aid kit chapter to help you figure out your mistakes and how to fix them. My third copy had an updated version of the booklet, with more detailed instruction patterns.  I found the first edition of the booklet a bit vague for a beginner, but the new version is just right.  I look forward to the sequel in the fall!",1156204800,127,1325,4.285140562248996
2348622,5,B000A0P6A4,"I live in a rural area and have no where to go to learn to knit.

So tried to learn to knit by reading books, but it didn't work.

It's hard to hold the book, needles, knit, and read the book at the same time. So I bought The Complete Beginner's Guide to Knitting. And I just finish making the Basketweave Scarf for my daughter, and I also had no problems with the pattern booklet.

And I have knitted 2 sweaters for my Dog's. I think it's a great DVD and can't wait for the next one to come out. You can't go wrong with this DVD if you buy it. And I love that she shows you English and Continental styles.

Good job and thanks for teaching me how to knit finally.",1156204800,10,664,3.969924812030075
2348623,5,B000A0P6A4,I have recommended this DVD over and over again to other people for both children and adults.  I found the teaching style for beginning knitting to be clear and concise.  You do need the written form as part of the learning style.  It helps you translate what you have learned from the DVD and allows you to apply it to other patterns.  I bought this DVD because of the video snippets found at the author's website and I wanted something that taught both the english/american and the continental style.  It covered what I thought I needed and so much more.,1156204800,11,556,4.52
2348624,5,B000A0P6A4,"Yes, I too had difficulty playing the DVD on my PC and on my DVD player.  I wrote to Ms. McNally and promptly received a new DVD that worked perfectly on my PC and DVD player.

Now, as far as other reviewers being 'truthful', I do notice that they did receive another copy that worked, and that they also raved about the content and presentation.  Like them, I am a real knitter and had/have nothing to do with the creation of the DVD, nor do I even know the people behind the DVD.  Furthermore, I would not make presumptions that because a product has many good reviews it must all be rigged by the authors of the product.

I also have copies of the Art of Knitting and Lori Knits.  While they are interesting and good, they are not of the quality of the Complete Beginner's Guide to Knitting.  First, the 'filmed' quality is superior and the close-up shots are clear.  Also she covered many of the weird mistakes that can happen for a beginning knitter.  I love that she shows how these mistakes occur so the beginner can be on the lookout for them.  Finally, I have no problems with the pattern booklet.  Why have them on the screen instead of in a booklet? I can take the booklet with me, but not the DVD!",1156204800,12,1209,4.3053097345132745

I was knitting 15 minutes after receiving the dvd in the mail! Nici takes you through step by step at a nice pace. I did not have any problems at all. In fact she even covers alot of the mistakes I had made in the past which helped me to understand what I had been doing wrong! Thanks to this dvd I can proudly say I am now a knitter! I can't wait for the next dvd! And no, I am not a representative of the dvd. Just a very satisfied customer!",1156204800,11,580,4.008620689655173
2348626,5,B000A0P6A4,"This DVD was a huge help in taking my knitting from novice to advanced beginner and beyond.  I am one of those people who can't make heads or tails of the knitting diagrams in otherwise great books.  But if I can watch someone demonstrate the technique, I can get it. I have watched several of the DVD's out there, and this is the best in terms of clarity, organization, and sequence of instructions. I also liked the ""Learn to Knit"" series, but find this one a bit easier to follow and to have more content. I noticed that one reviewer criticized the fact that the DVD comes with a written pattern booklet, rather than displaying the patterns on screen.  I feel just the opposite, as I needed to look back at the pattern after I was done with the DVD. I wouldn't want to have to turn the DVD on every time I needed to look back at the pattern!

2348627,5,B000A0P6A4,"I have previously tried to learn to knit, only to give up in frustration.  Despite a comment from a previous reviewer, I am not a front for the manufacturer.

I took a class last fall offered through my parks and rec department.  I was having a lot of trouble casting on, and finally the instructor came over, took it out of my hands and cast on for me.  I obviously learned nothing from this experience.  I quit the class, got a refund and searched online.

I found Nici's website and was able to learn the purl stitch simply by watching her preview of the video.  I bought the video and have now made several scarves, hats, and one afghan.

I have advance-ordered the next dvd and eagerly await its arrival.

As for reading the pattern online vs. from a booklet, I found the patterns quite easy to follow and the pattern can come with me in my knitting bag.

Lastly, what compelled me to write this review was an email I received from Nici asking for input in response to the one negative review posted previously on Amazon.  How's that for customer service?!!!!!!",1156204800,14,1066,4.471502590673575

The visuals are clear and close-up for easy viewing. She has a pleasant and relaxed approach that makes the first time knitter feel comfortable and confident.  Nici has perfected a ""no fail"" system of instruction.

I am a seasoned knitter and found this DVD to be helpful in understanding gauges and finishing techniques. It is a great refresher course.  I am looking forward to purchasing more of her videos.

Videos like this will surely help to increase the knitting population.  Thank you, Nici, for a job well done.",1153267200,12,696,4.766666666666667

I now know how to apply emergency first aid to a swatch, how to block, increasing and other little things that you need on your journey to becoming a knitter.  Also as a bonus, some of the knitting terms, SSK and K2tog are explained.

You can't go wrong with this DVD.  She shows you English and Continental styles and the best part--she encourages you and tells you it's okay to hold your needle a certain way or knit loosely.

At first I thought that I am way too young to be knitting, but then after browsing the video I found that the instructor, Nici, is young and hip. So I gave it a try, and now I'm addicted and really pretty good. The DVD is easy to follow, and I can learn when it's convenient for me. Now I have a beautiful wrap to show for my long waits.

The movements and instruction are so perfectly clear, and it's broken down to each step. I tried to learn from a friend, then took a lesson (the class was 75 dollars and over-crowded), and I was still haveing trouble. After just fifteen minutes with this dvd, I was knitting better! I just can't believe how easy it really is. You just need the right teacher.

The quality of this dvd is great. The visuals are so appealling and pleasing to watch, and I like the free patterns I can download from their website.

You can stop, pause, and the DVD pauses automatically at certain spots so you can go as slow as you want and it waits for you.  I love that.  Nici McNally is so nice and encouraging, I really enjoyed learning from her.  I can't wait for the next DVDs!  I also love how perfectly clear the demonstrations are, they're very very very close-up and you can see exactly what she's doing, this isn't so with other dvds....

I sent an e-mail to the seller and had a new DVD in about a week.  I put it in and it was great.  You get wonderful close-ups for knitting and purling as well as casting on.  Unfortunately, when the DVD got to Chapter 4, it froze up and went back to the main menu.  I clicked on Chapter 4 again, got a blank screen and then back to the main menu again.  This DVD is excellent, if you get one that works.  I told my sister about it, she ordered it, and the DVD that she received doesn't work.
Then, much to my surprise, without even asking, I received a third DVD a few days ago that works great.  Of the three knitting DVD's that I have, this is definitely the best.  Nici goes slowly and lets you catch up before going on to the next step.  The camera close-ups are excellent and the instructions are very clear.  I think that anyone who wants to learn to knit should get this DVD because they'll be knitting and purling very quickly.

This is just excellent and the instructor is very pleasant. The stop-and-start-whenever-you-want feature is also perfect for the beginning knitter, who needs to finish a row, or practice for several rows before moving on. It's also very easy to play a section again as often as you like through a menu that comes up on the screen after each new lesson. I originally bought it because I wanted to compare continental and english knitting, which is another real plus of this dvd and the way it is structured.

There are frequent opportunities to be shown steps again (Over and over!).
It is easy to fast forward through steps to get a quick visual demonstration.
