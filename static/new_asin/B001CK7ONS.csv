3513880,5,B001CK7ONS,"What a great, fun movie! I enjoyed this Veggie Tales movie so much & so did my 5 yr. old daughter.  It has lots of ""jokes for the grown ups"" as I call them, especially at the end - B52's fans prepare to dance!  This movie also manages to work in a spiritual message at the end, but does it so subtly that non-believers won't feel preached at in the least.  The spiritual aspect is what I like most about Veggie Tales in general, as a teaching tool for my child, and even my atheist spouse gets some laughs out of most of the shows.  This movie is one that will appeal to all types of parents and kids.",1222646400,7,601,4.025210084033613

3513915,2,B001CK7ONS,"Incredibly disappointing. When I saw Jonah, I was excited to see VeggieTales coming to theaters in full-length movies. When I heard they were making this, we made plans to see it in theaters. We regretted our decision. VeggieTales hasn't made another full-length movie, and this is the reason why. Almost no humor, the story line was too mature for children to understand, and it dragged. Jonah had lots of fun songs that we could leave remembering, and I went with a group of adults to see it again. If there are any songs in this, I don't remember them, except the parody of a B52's song.

The movie is about some guys who work at a Medieval Times style restaurant, but for various reasons are disappointed in their job and themselves. Good luck explaining this to a four year old. Other VeggieTale subjects that my four year old understands: lying, being mean, being nice, standing up for what's right. Dissatisfaction with a job? Feeling like a disappointment to grandchildren? Not so much. The only reason I own it is because it was a gift.",1482019200,,1045,4.679347826086956

3513930,5,B001CK7ONS,This is a favorite in our house!  Great movie with wonderfully catchy music numbers.  The Main Pirates theme song is quite catchy.  I find myself singing it randomly!  There's a Jamaican-themed song that really is quite clever!  Very cute!  And I LOVE the messages!  The King sends a Help Seeker to help the Princess find her brother the Prince.  The lowly cabin boys are sent to help and find that they overcome their own insecurities by helping others.  Oh and watch for the rock monsters.  Too cute!,1464998400,,502,4.666666666666667
3513931,3,B001CK7ONS,"I don't like it as well as I did when the original people did it. I loved the Bible stories that went with the story before.

3513933,1,B001CK7ONS,"We just started watching the various Veggie Tales shows and movies with our kids. We really loved the older stuff despite the quality of the renderings/sound, etc. But, this one with the big ""Universal"" marquee at the beginning seems like it must have also gained a whole slew of new cooks in the kitchen who definitely ruined the soup. This movie was conspicuously lacking God or any biblical moral, and it didn't even retain the charm of the Veggie Tales series such as the clever side comments and generous song breakouts. It almost seems like someone bought the franchise just to sink by turning it into expensive drivel that no one could justify maintaining.",1463875200,10,663,4.824561403508772

3514077,3,B001CK7ONS,"To all the die-hard VeggieTales fans, this movie may be different from what you'd be expecting. This movie is pretty detached from the original VeggieTales formula, there aren't many elaborate musical numbers, no witty satire of biblical stories, there aren't even any religious references, like, at all. A very glaring detachment from what I expected.

These changes seem to show Big Idea's effort to market the VeggieTales franchise to the mainstream theatrical audience. It very much shows in this regard, this is easily one of the more visually striking VeggieTales productions. The lighting effects, the cinematic angles, and the animations are all very aesthetically pleasing. Those looking for a religious movie for their children should looks elsewhere, there is none of that in this film.

Unfortunately, the writing isn't as impressive as the movie's visuals or previous installments of the franchise. The movie stars the Pirates who don't do anything, a trio of insecure cabin boys who find themselves as unlikely heroes on an adventure; trying to overcome their doubts of their own self worth in the process. It's a story you've heard many times before; however, the story does beg to be mildly heartwarming at times thanks to the plight of the central Pirate(Who is NOT Larry by the way).

I very much liked the Jonah movie better. That movie at least knew it's audience and what would please them and made it's movie accordingly,  so, while no masterpiece, jonah made for a much more memorable film.

But with all it's shortcomings, I can't bring myself to hate this film. So, in the end, Pirates who don't do anything may be a forgettable movie, but it's a harmless one. It's a cute movie to watch with your kids if they are VeggieTales fanatics.",1389052800,,1761,4.976190476190476

We almost turned it off a couple of times, but decided to keep going, hoping it would redeem itself.  All three of our kids were scared to the point of covering their eyes or ears at various times.  Whether it was the pirates themselves, the scary storms and ocean scenery, the attacking cheese curls, the giant walking rocks, the dragon, the dungeon scenes, etc., there was plenty of scary stuff in here and little other content to make this a movie I can recommend.  If your kids don't scare easily and really love pirates and all that they are about, you might like this movie, but it seems to me as if the creators had a hit song and forced it into a movie.

I bought this DVD, so he could watch the music video for it any time he wanted. We were very surprised and disappointed to find that this DVD does not have the main song! I really don't understand it... I noticed they play an instrumental version sporadically throughout the movie, but never once do they sing the actual song as seen on the ""Silly Songs"" DVD. Also, it did not allow us to go to the DVD menu at any point during the movie. Very annoying.

I thought it would be meant more for children but was surprised to find that I enjoyed it just as much as they did.  Maybe even more!  There were a lot of references to things adults would remember: tv shows, etc...  This is one of my favorite films!

To me, it was a really pleasant and positive movie, and the attack of the killer cheese puffs really cracked me up.
The dvd extras include how to draw some of the characters, some fun and games as well as a great activity to try with your family, and an alternate ending which I thought was pretty cute.
Oh yeah, there is a song called ""rock monster"" which is a parody of the song ""rock lobster"" by the b-52's. I really loved that part and had that song stuck in my head for the next day or so.

When I saw this one we took a chance since we had never seen a Veggie Tale movie before.  Such a lucky find!  It is funny (for kids and adults watching with them) and has a good over all message about trying your best.  The song at the end ""Rock Monster"" is a play on the B-52's Rock Lobster and it always has us all laughing.  It is just the right balance of swash buckling thrills and fun for this age set.

This one was so different... it lacked the humorous flavor and clear message we were so accustomed to with ""Veggie Tales""... Didnt seem ""authentic"" Veggie Tales!  Didnt really have too much of a point, like usual.

I gave it three stars... which means ""It was OK""..  I guess little kids would love anything with Bob and Larry...

For those of us who have enjoyed Veggie Tales for alot of years.. who have supported them, bought their movies for the great values and biblical message and awesome humor...you will probably see that something is lacking with this one.

3. Fun for kids and adults.
4. The story is long enough but not too long. Just perfect.
5. Great for everyone, not just Christians (there are no Christian themes in DVD if you don't count ""the values"" part that is applicable to most religions

Three vegetables that in their own enviroment are seen as losers because they don't have great jobs, are seen as pushovers or scared of everything, are thrown by accident in and adventure where the are called to be heroes. Now they think it's a mistake, but they try to do their best and in the end understand that there was no mistake. To be a hero you don't need to be beautiful, have money, etc., you just need to do the right thing regardless of the consecuences.
In a time in which the world reveres looks, power and money, and looks down on moral values, I find this movies to be a real treasure.

3514202,5,B001CK7ONS,"This is the first Veggie Tales that I have ever seen since my early days at Sunday school. I am currently a freshman in high school, and I absolutely adored this movie. It was great fun to watch with my family and we had a memorable time following the adventures of Elliot, Sedgewick, and George, (also known as Larry, Mr. Lunt, and Pa Grape.)

This movie feautres quirky humor, an interesting kid-appealing storyline, and the unique and colorful (literally and figurately) cast of Veggie Tales. Of course, The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything is chockful with a whimsical variety of cheery and boppy sing-along songs.

The story revolves around Elliot, Sedgewick and George, who are ""cabin boys"" at a restaurant. They find a mysterious orb that was sent out by a desperate princess and are transported out of their environment to save her, regardless of their inabilities and faults. Along the quest, the trio conquers their weaknesses (Cowardice, laziness, and timidness,) and have an adventure that changes them for the better.

The only drawback is that unlike other Veggie Tales movies which are very biblical, (as informed by my friend, who is also a fan,) this one lacks scarcely any Christian motivation behind it. Only at the very end, is the message ""God gives help to those who ask for it,"" delivered, and it is ambiguously stated, only comprehensible to little ones if their mother pauses the video and explains it.

I highly recommend this swashbuckling veggie pirate adventure. You can't go wrong with this movie. Have fun!",1231372800,6,1534,4.934108527131783

Pirates is a story about three reluctant heroes who discover their courage and strength through stick-to-itiveness. Not only do the save the day, but they prove themselves capable by overcoming their fears and doing what has to be done.
The highlights for my 4 year old son were the Rock Monsters and the Attack of the Cheese Curls, during which he clung to my side. My highlight was the Rock Monster video at the end of the movie done to the B-52's Rock Lobster. Great song and it'll get stuck in your head for days.",1231200000,,738,4.355072463768116

Santa brough my son a wooden sword (which I'm still not sure was a great idea) so he helps during some tense scenes and tried to get those bad guys. For some reason I find the ""Evil Cheese"" to be absolutely hilarious. I'm not sure why but it just cracks me up.

I also LOVE the fact that there is a video included in the special feature for ""Rock Monster"". Since I'm a HUGE B-52's fan I loved it from the second I heard it. My son loves it - even though at this point he has only had the movie 1 day he already has the ""Rock Monster"" song memorized. My little cheesy music genius.

3514212,5,B001CK7ONS,"Several years ago when Big Idea Productions hadn't gone bankrupt and Phil Vischer was still the man who everyone thought was running the company, he wrote a script for a motion picture that featured characters from the Big Idea universe, but in a non-Biblical story. The movie was about the Pirates Who Don't Do Anything and was written several years before production even started on PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN. Unfortunately, Big Idea went bankrupt and the movie was forgotten and could have been a lost relic. But thank goodness it wasn't and Vischer and Big Idea came together once again for THE PIRATES WHO DON'T DO ANYTHING.

The movie begins aboard a ship under attack by pirates in the 17th Century. Led by Robert the Terrible, the banished brother of the King, the pirates capture Prince Alexander. Robert is furious at his brother and intends to use the Prince as a pawn to win the King's throne. Alexander's sister, the Princess Eloise, and their butler Willory escape from the pirates and use a device the King has created (a nod to THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA hear) to call for help.

Meanwhile in the present day, Elliot (Larry the Cucumber), Sedgwick (Mr. Lunt), and George (Pa Grape) are servers at the Pieces of Ate Dinner Theater. The place is a popular entertainment destination for families and the trio all dream of eventually working not serving food, but as starring members of the cast in the show. Taking a cue from THE WIZARD OF OZ, the three friends each have different issues that they struggle with. None of the three are exactly where they would like to be in life and things seem headed downhill for them, especially when they mess up an audition for the cast.

But then the mysterious device sent from the King selects these three to help. Very rapidly the trio finds themselves traveling through time, fighting evil pirates, dodging flesh-eating cheese curls, and running from gigantic rock monsters. It's one dangerous adventure after another and Elliot, Sedgwick, and George each have their face their own internal struggles and work as a team in order to rescue the Princess, defend the King, and save the Kingdom.

THE PIRATES WHO DON'T DO ANYTHING is a highly entertaining movie. It is from Big Idea and features VeggieTales characters, but it is unlike any VeggieTale production to date. For starters, the VeggieTales characters aren't actual characters in the movie. Instead, they play characters other than themselves. For instance, normally Larry the Cucumber portrays all kinds of other different characters in a story, but everyone knows it's just Larry playing the parts, especially with the winks and nods to the 4th wall. That doesn't happen in THE PIRATES WHO DON'T DO ANYTHING. Instead, Larry plays Elliot and it is Elliot who is one of the heroes of the story. It's basically what most actors do in each project they take on, but in this case it's the characters of VeggieTales who are the actors acting in a film that's not about them. Larry, Mr. Lunt, and Pa Grape portray the major characters, but most of the cast of VeggieTales can be seen in the film in supporting roles or cameos.

The movie is also significant because it is one of the least overtly Christian/Biblical of all the Veggie Tales shorts, DVDs, and movies so far. The film is full of allegorical elements that are taken from Biblical scripture and Christianity, but the story is not a Bible story and never takes on a preachy tone.

There are some that say the animation is good, but not amazing. That's not accurate. Historically, Big Idea was making thirty minute shorts a couple years before Pixar came to the forefront. The company was at one time on the cutting edge of CGI animation and was one of the first to break through the ""new frontier"" that is now so commonplace. However, Big Idea is a very different company than Pixar and once their universe was created and the characters were established, there was no huge need to advance more rapidly. Pixar and other animation studios like them continually push the envelope of CGI animation to make their features look more and more lifelike. In the Big Idea universe, that's not necessarily. Yet, for the universe it is, THE PIRATES WHO DON'T DO ANYTHING pushes at the boundaries of that universe, with extremely bright and vibrant colors, and has the characters doing all sorts of things they have never done before, e.g. sword fighting.

The first half of the movie does move a bit slow, but once the trio travel back through time the pace quickens and doesn't stop until the end. Also, true to VeggieTale humor there are all kinds of sight gags, one-liners, and allusions that are sure to make children laugh and their parents and other adults smile.",1224979200,,4725,4.7901840490797545
3514213,5,B001CK7ONS,"It always cracks me up to read the serious reviews of cartoons!  The bottom line is......the kids love it!  As for not feeling for any of the characters............even I choke up where the creators intended viewers to do so.  The take off on the B52's Rock Lobster (Rock Monster) sends my whole household into a dance.  This DVD is worth every penny.

As for the doctrinal/Christian aspect of Veggie tales, we go to church on Sunday for those lessons........these shows are good clean fun.",1224633600,,490,4.785714285714286
3514214,5,B001CK7ONS,"Pirates was the first movie that my young son watched entirely in the movie theatre. He loves those silly vegetables and so do I. While he watches he does not even realize the important values he is learning, but I am gladened to know he is exposed to wonderful teaching moments.

The story follows three pitiful veggie friends who are called to perform the most impossible task. They must overcome self-doubt, laziness, and unrealistic fears if they are to succeed. And that is probably something all of us fight at one time or another.

Another great feature is the extended ending. Very funny scene which had my wife and I laughing at loud in the car as we sat at the Sonic Drive-In. Pick up a copy of this and I promise your family will not be disappointed. You will end up being the hero, just like our favorite veggie friends.",1224288000,5,832,4.503311258278146
3514215,5,B001CK7ONS,"Actually, we watched the movie trailer about nine thousand times before the movie even hit the theaters, so we've been fans even longer. When my 6 and 4 year old kids were introduced to VeggieTales as toddlers, I was leery of the shows, thinking they would be preachy or annoying, but they are in fact, sweet, funny, witty, clever, very well done and very entertaining. Even for grownups!  I'd take Silly Songs with Larry any day over The Wiggles or -gasp- Barney.

The well-written stories, some bible inspired, some not (Pirates is not) teach kids how to act and react to things they will encounter in their lives (greed, lying, bullies, new siblings, etc.) with entertaining examples and lots of silliness.

BUT back to the Pirates. Several wonderful messages are wrapped nicely in a fun story everyone will love. The main theme: you don't have to be the biggest, the strongest, or the best looking to be a hero; you just have to do what is right, even when it's tough to so so. Even a cabin boy can do what's right. Even a princess can do what's right. Anyone can be ""a hero"". What a wonderful message to send our kids, and ourselves.

Even those not familiar with the characters will be able to enjoy this full-length movie. There's a new ""alternate ending"" that we have watched about ninety-two times since buying the DVD last Saturday (very cute). They even edited out the one little line I didn't like on the big screen (Mr. Lunt's character, Sedgewick, had in a fit of anger said he ""hated"" his friend Eliot [Larry], which seemed too mean and out of character-- hooray, that word I don't like my kids to say has magically vanished!). Fun, Fun, and very well done. While you're at it, buy Lord of the Beans. If you've seen the trilogy the show's based on, you'll get plenty of inside references that go over the kids' heads. Buy all the VeggieTales shows, they're great!",1224201600,3,1878,4.597014925373134
3514216,4,B001CK7ONS,"Imagine a world where vegetables sail the seven seas and the most fearsome pirate is the one with arms and legs, albeit mechanical arms and legs.  That's the world of the new VeggieTales release.  And it's a full length film.

The movie opens in the 17th century.  We are on a ship that is being captured by pirates.  While brave Prince Alexander tries to fight them off, he is ultimate captured.  Unfortunately, the pirates are being led by Robert the Terrible.  Not only is he the king's banished brother, but he has also used mechanics to create arms and legs (well, one leg and one peg leg), making him the most fearsome pirate around.  The one thing he wants most is his brother's throne, and he intends to use the prince and princess to get it.

Unfortunately for him, Princess Eloise and the butler Willory (Archibald Asparagus) have escaped capture.  And they use a contraption the King has created to send a plea for help.

Fast forward to the present day.  At the Pieces of Ate Dinner Theater we meet Elliot, Sedgwick, and George (Larry the Cucumber, Mr. Lunt, and Pa Grape.)  They work as Cabin Boys (waiters), but long to be in the show.  Unfortunately, Elliot has a list of things he is afraid of, Sedgwick is just plain lazy, and George lacks self-confidence.

And these three misfits are the ones the plea for help finds.  Before they really know what is happening, they find themselves on board the ship with Willory and Princess Eloise on a quest to rescue Prince Alexander.  Can they become heroes to complete the quest?  Or will their flaws spell doom for everyone?

Aside from the characters I mentioned, most of the main characters are new.  But keep an eye open for blink and you'll miss then cameos from many of the regulars, including Bob the Tomato.  Also look for the appearance of the Grape family.  I guess they aren't gone for good.

This movie really is a tale of two halves.  I found the first half slow and predictable as it set things up.  While the second half was still predictable, this is where the fun really started.  The jokes came much faster and really hit their target.

This is also the least overt Christian film from the Veggies.  There is still a clear moral about what it takes to be a hero and there is a strong allegory to things (although don't take it too far or you'll wind up with very, very bad theology.)

As you would expect, this move is 100% kid friendly.  The fearsome pirates drink Root Beer and Ginger Ale.  Their sword fights never produce a single wound.  Frankly, I got quite a kick out of this.

In keeping with the Veggie's roots, this isn't the top notch animation you would normally see.  But it is keeping with their last few efforts, so long time fans will know what to expect.

This is not the best effort from VeggieTales, but it is fun and the franchise's many fans will certainly enjoy it.",1224201600,15,2864,4.505836575875486
3514217,4,B001CK7ONS,"Avast ye maties! This be a tale of pirates, but it isn't the one you're thinking of. That ones over for now. No, this one is about three vegetables who defy all odds to become heroes. In ""The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything: A VeggieTales Movie.""

George, Sedgewick (both Phil Vischer) and Elliot (Mike Nawrocki) were simple cabin boys working at a pirate-themed restaurant when they find a ball that sends them back in time to the 16th century. While there, they are told by a princess that they must save her brother from an evil pirate. Though they know they're not heroes, they accept and end up on an adventure of nutritious proportions.

In this day of incredible computer-aided animation and scripts written to keep audiences laughing, it is easy to get caught up in the quality of the production and the non-stop barrage of jokes while losing sight of another objective that a good movie for kids might--or even should--attempt to achieve: communicating the value of virtues. It is rare that a movie can pull off all three, and I have to believe that effectively communicating values (without preaching) is the most difficult of the three.

The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything comes close on all three counts. The animation is good, but it does not amaze. The story has moments of laughter and emotion, but you don't end up caring about many of the characters. And it makes it clear that doing the right thing and being willing to make sacrifices for others is important and worth the effort. In the end, kids will have been entertained while having important principles reinforced. This is truly a movie for kids from start to finish, rather than a cute story with mature humor thrown in from time to time to keep things interesting for parents who might not be able set their prurient interests aside for a couple of hours.

Now if I could just get those freaky cheese curls off my mind...",1223683200,35,1895,4.664670658682635
