3049079,5,B0010IOALG,"This 2 DVD set clocks in at 4 and a half hours. The first DVD features the best moments from the last twenty years of Comic Relief. There are not enough superlatives for this release. If there is a comic you like, that comic is here:

Comedians featured on DVD 1 of Comic Relief The Greatest and The Latest: Gary Shandling, Gilda Radner, Harold Ramis, Catherine O'Hara and Martin Short, Jon Lovitz, Carl Reiner, George Carlin, Eugene Levy and John Candy as the Polka brothers, Michael Davis, Dennis Miller, Bobcat Goldthwait, Elayne Boosler, Peter Cook and Dudley Moore, Richard Lewis, Arsenio Hall, Penn & Teller, Roseanne Barr, Steven Wright, Steve Allen, Bill Dana, Tom Poston, Don Knotts, Marsha Warfield, Paul Reiser, Jim Varney, Robin Duke, Woody Harrelson and Shelley Long, Joan Rivers, Dana Carvey, Rosie O'Donnell, Don Rickles, Jake Johanssen, Jim Carrey, Bret Butler, Alan King, Dave Chappelle, Carlos Mencia, Bill Maher, Rick Overton,  Dan Aykroyd with Jim Belushi and John Goodman as the Blues Brothers, Richard Belzer and Gilbert Gottfried, Dane Cook, Margaret Cho, Chris Rock, Louie Anderson, Ronert Klein, Louie Anderson, Bobby Slayton, Jon Stewart, Jeff Wayne, Sinbad, Craig Shoemaker, Drew Carey, Queen Latifah, Richard Jeni, Milton Berle, Paul Rodriguez, Caroline Rhea, Kathy Griffin, David Cross, Bob Odenkirk,.

Stand-up comic appearing with on DVD 2 (and not already listed above): Ray Romano, Bob Zmuda, Stephen Colbert, Susie Essman, D.L. Hughley, Jimmy Kimmel, Howie Mandel, Sarah Silverman, Lewis Black, Fred Willard with Jennifer Coolidge and Catherine O'Hara, Mike Epps, Louis C.K. Katt Williams, Wayne Brady.

DVD 2 is the 2006 show from Vegas to raise funds after Katrina. This is a saltier show than the usual fare so caveat emptor if you are of a sensitive nature --though why you would buy a comedy DVD if you are a sensitive soul is beyond me.

Personal favorite moments include the crew from Star Trek The Next Generation flogging the t-shirt and sweatshirt, Dana Carvey's rock star, and Billy Crystal's salute to New Orleans in the DVD 2 extra features.

If you know someone who likes stand-up, this is a guaranteed great gift.",1203897600,26,2162,5.127840909090909

3049088,3,B0010IOALG,"Disappointing, and it didn't have to be. Collecting some of the best acts from previous years of Comic Relief should have been done on four or five discs, instead of one. What we get here are little sound bites of comedians in performance, where in fact such performances are best seen as a full set. Otherwise it just comes across as a highlight reel, with punchline after punchline. This doesn't serve standup comedy particularly well. On the other hand, of course, at least if you don't care for a specific act, it doesn't take long until the next clip is running. The second disc runs the complete Comic Relief show after Hurricane Katrina. Some of the acts are very good- Lewis Black gives by far the best performance of the lot- and others, not so good. It depends on the personal preference of the viewer. Two general observations though: Ray Romano on the second disc falls completely flat in his routine; I could never understand why anyone found him amusing. And Whoopi Goldberg isn't as funny as she seems to think she is, particularly these days.",1357862400,4,1058,4.693548387096774
