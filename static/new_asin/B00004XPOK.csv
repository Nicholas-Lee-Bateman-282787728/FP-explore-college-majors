1368324,5,B00004XPOK,"It's funny reading all these long-winded, important sounding words expressing opinions for and against... The important fact- is that the movies are STILL controversial to this day! All of these labels and tired arguments being bounced back and forth.... The funniest ones are those who say the films are dated, embarrassing, cliche.... that's only the myopic preception of a straight-jacketed mind having gulped down one too many ""bushisms"" lately. Billy Jack's ultimate message is ANTI-WAR, and the fact that he has violent tendencies (don't we all!) and struggles to control them, only makes the crowd who conceptualize in black and white a little nervous... you see, Billy Jack's story is one of spiritual and personal growth.... ah, but who has time for that stuff nowadays, huh....",1113436800,9,787,5.253968253968254
1368325,5,B00004XPOK,I THINK THESE BILLY JACK MOVIES WERE GREAT WHEN I WAS A TEEN ME & MY FRIENDS WENT TO THE MOVIES TO SEE THESE ALL OF US GIRLS CRIED AT THE END . I CAN'T BELIEVE THE OTHER REVIEWS THAT I READ ON THIS MOVIE MAYBE IT WAS TO DEEP FOR THEM TO UNDERSTAND THE MEANING  THESE MOVIES WERE ABOUT PEOPLE TRYING TO BE THEMSEVES NOT A SEX NOT A COLORTHAT SOCIETY COULDN'T EXCEPT AND BILLY WAS TRYING TO STAND UP FOR THEIR RIGHTS BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T BECAUSE THEY STOOD FOR NON VIOLENCE SO PEOPLE WATCH IT AND PAY ATTENTION TO THE REAL MEANING AND YOU WOULD ENJOY IT AS MUCH AS ALL THE PEOPLE I KNOW.

1368326,5,B00004XPOK,"First, I will say that Billy Jack fans of all ages will love this collection...... and it's worth ever penny!  They will also be elated over the quality and the special features.  You can watch the movie, or you can activate the narration track.  With the narration track, the entire movie is then narrated point-by-awesome-point by Tom Laughlin and Deloris Taylor.  Every scene, every character, every piece of history is covered in detail.  The viewer actually feels like the Laughlins are sitting in the living room talking to you..... it's that personal, it's that interesting, it's that good.  The other aspect of the narrated track is just how much the Laughlins admire and care for each other.  They are indeed a unique and special couple.  Even the casual fan of Tom Laughlin's work will be mesmerized by the quality of the DVD and the personal narration.  Hardcore fans will watch these over and over again........ after 30 years the stories, the experiences, and the theme are priceless and these DVD's feel like a gift from the Laughlins.  They are a bargain at any price.  Thank you, Thank you, Thank you.... and God Bless Tom Laughlin and Deloris Taylor!",973123200,9,1167,4.843434343434343

1368385,4,B00004XPOK,"When I picked up this collection, I hadn't seen a Billy Jack movie in over 40 years. I will not go into great detail about the plots but will instead make some comments about each movie.

For anybody who doesn't know, Billy Jack in an ex-marine who is part Native American and has it in for the white man who trample on Indian lands. Tom Laughlin wrote the story of Billy Jack more than a decade before the first movie but could not get it made. He settled for having the character star in a 'biker gang' movie, which were popular at the time in the late 60's. After the commercial success of 'The Born Losers' he was able to get 'Billy Jack' made. After that it was easy to get 'The Trial of Billy Jack' made but 'Billy Jack goes To Washington' was basically black listed by Washington politicians and could not get a significant release. Laughlin was never able to get another Billy Jack movie made though he tried throughout the rest of his life.

COMMENTS/THOUGHTS: Surprisingly, I enjoyed the first and the last, 'The Born Losers' and 'Billy Jack goes To Washington' the most even though the middle two were the most commercially successful.

THE BORN LOSERS was my favorite of the 'Billy Jack' movies. It was poorly acted, poorly directed and had poor production values. That aside it was easily the most fun to watch. It was the least politically motivated though it was based on a real life event in California. It has the most 'Billy Jack' marital arts action. With each successive movie there would be less and less fighting.
The acting was stupendously bad in spots. Tom Laughlin was good enough. He is an average actor with limited range but he conveyed 'Billy Jack's' anger any cynicism well. The gang leader was OK. Everybody else was below average or worse and sometimes much worse. What was up with Jane Russell in this movie? She was terrible and I'm sure they hired her for a few hours just for star power. I don't know if she needed the money or just happened to be in the area for an easy paycheck. But she was terrible in a terrible role. I didn't bother to research the reason.
The plot was over the top but I was never bored and was always entertained.
Billy Jack was almost like supporting actor at times in this movie. There are many scenes in which he is not involved. The story focuses on a biker gang that is raping and abducting girls in a California town. The movie can be a bit inconsistent at times. For example, the sheriff goes from ultra tough to wimpy and the gang itself goes from ultra tough to wimpy at times. But as I said, this movie despite it's many flaws is fun to watch.

BILLY JACK is a decent enough movie. It was commercially very successful. In this movie, Billy Jack is at odds with local townsfolk over a school for children that are taught in an unorthodox manner. It is basically a school that teaches 'hippie' ideals. Billy Jack also does not like the locals hunting on Indian grounds. There are numerous incidents with the locals and the school and Billy Jack sees violence as the only way to defend the school and it's children. His girlfriend, real life wife, Dolores Taylor, does not see eye to eye with him on this. It was great to see 50's science fiction star Kenneth Tobey (The Thing, It Came from Beneath the Sea,) albeit, in a supporting role and as a bad guy.

I did not like THE TRIAL OF BILLY JACK all that much. This was my least favorite of the quarttette. I saw this as a pre-teen. I remember seeing the commercial on TV of reporters interviewing patrons and people running down the street to stand on line to see the movie. The only memory I have of the movie is that of Billy Jack removing his boots and kicking. I also have some memories of cartoon images of the movies from Mad Magazine! I have an image stuck in my head of people holding their noses and passing out when Billy Jack removes his boots! LOL
I was surprised to see that the trial of Billy Jack was essentially non-existent and over in the first few minutes. As I was watching the movie I was saying to myself ""Why the hell did they call this movie 'The Trial of Billy Jack' if there really isn't a trial. Ok I get it..if anybody is reading this, I think I figured it out, you can correct me if I'm wrong....the trial was for Billy Jack's spirit or soul. Native American culture and/or mysticism is not my strong point.
I thought the ending was way over the top. I know that at the time there had been incidents with students and the military but this carried it a bit too far. I can see a few soldiers screwing up. In this movie they send the military after a school of pre-college students and gun many of them down.

Surprisingly, I enjoyed BILLY JACK GOES TO WASHINGTON. I did not think I would like it but I did. Billy Jack becomes a State Senator through manipulation by government bigwigs and money men. Billy Jack being senator is preposterous (or is it?) There is only one scene in the movie in which Senator Billy Jack!!! gets into a brawl. This movie also had by far the best acting. It had a lot of recognizable character actors.
In this day and age I don't like politics and morality lessons in movies but somehow this movie strikes a chord. Amazingly enough, they way the story unfolds, liberals and conservatives alike could probably both relate to Billy Jack in this movie. The ultra liberal Billy Jack is pushing a liberal agenda in Congress and yet one of the main things he is pushing is something that Trump supporters have been pushing for ever since he entered the race for President. Believe it or not....Billy Jack wants to...get this... DRAIN THE SWAMP!!!!..Billy Jack has had enough of politicians who are bought by Billionaires..does this make Trump a liberal?....have liberals and conservatives changed sides in the past 40 years?..are liberals and conservatives closer together than they think at least on some points?...am I completely clueless and reading way too much into a f'in movie???

OK, enough about politics. I have broken one of my rules by talking about it.

CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the movies themselves are pretty good but not great. I felt that the acting was below average in most of the movies. Easily the best acted was 'Billy Jack Goes To Washington.' Easily the most entertaining was 'The Born Losers' but by far the worst acted.  There are some excellent commentary tracks and the overall package is a very good value. If you don't like political correctness, like myself, you can still enjoy these movies. These movies make a point but they don't spend the whole movie trying to shove that point down your throat and preaching. Billy Jack is a flawed individual. He is very liberal but has violent tendencies.

RECOMMENDATIONS: I would have given this release 5 stars but there were a few problems. The main problem is that the picture quality is not all the great for BLU-RAY quality. There is definitely room for improvement here. The extra's are very good but could have included a few other things. I would have liked to have seen some of those commercials I talked about in my comments about 'The Trial of Billy Jack.' They had historical significance as they changed the way movies were advertised (For more info, search in Google.) Maybe a few making of video's or interviews would have helped. However, the commentaries were very good and informative. I did not listen to all of them or any of them completely but I did listen to parts and they were very good. Overall, I still think it's a good value. You get 4 movies for basically $25 upon release. So let's call it 4 1/2 stars!",1505865600,,7576,4.523357664233576

1368429,2,B00004XPOK,"Yikes! Yet again, Shout Factory has produced a very sub-par Blu-ray, in this case, a sub-par 4-disc set, just as poor as are so many of their Blu-rays and DVDs. These are people who simply don't know how to do anywhere near as good a job as the major studios do at remastering and producing the best possible Blu-rays and DVDs, and they reveal repeatedly that they do not have access to the best film prints to start with (as to ""The Trial of Billy Jack"" and ""Born Losers""). I should have known this would be another bad Shout Factory experience, especially when I opened the sealed package and saw that one of the four discs was missing! (A friend who lives nearby, who also pre-ordered this set, loaned me that last disc so that I could view it, thus I reviewed that one here along with the others.)

** My review will be a somewhat detailed discussion of the technical aspects of the Blu-ray 4-disc set's picture quality, audio, and extras (or lack thereof), but not addressing the content or story of the four films, which I think has been addressed in great detail by other reviewers over the years. **

First of all, I will compare the new Shout! Factory blu-ray of 1971's ""Billy Jack"" in this 4-disc set with the previous blu-ray of a few years back from Image Entertainment. And the latter is superior in nearly all ways to this new Shout! Factory version. In this newer version, at the beginning of the closing credits, they suddenly repeat the audio section of ""One Tin Soldier"" that had been played as the movie was concluding, including the police sirens, yes, even the police sirens are repeated in the closing credits. The problem is, there shouldn't be ANY music in the closing credits, as all previous versions, incl. VHS, show-- just silence. This was somebody's dumb attempt to throw in some more of the famous theme song, but as it doesn't belong, not even one note, in the always-silent closing credits, it makes no sense at all; AND, it also starts abruptly, not at the beginning of the song or at some sensible intermediate point, as if some 4th-grader threw it on there mid-stream . . . it's just ridiculous.

The new version-- the Shout! Factory version-- is about 27 seconds shorter in running time, and this is mostly due to the fact that the earlier Blu-ray had the Motion Picture Association rating at the end for a few seconds, as on the original print, whereas that was omitted in this new version and some graphic like ""BillyJackRights.com"" was thrown on there instead in this new one, thus not being faithful to the original print.

And, the most important point to me-- the picture quality-- while solidly good, is simply not quite as good on this newest version, because the color is oversaturated in many places, making faces sometimes oversaturated, and occasionally there are slightly wrongly-tinted fleshtones. Also, somebody decided to retain-- or add in-- additional grain into this version, making the picture granier and less desirable (to me) than the cleaner-looking previous blu-ray version. Some movie aficionados think older movies should show grain even on blu-rays, which, in a blu-ray, I simply cannot understand, as I am looking for the best, sharpest, most hi-def picture quality-- not the worst.

The one improvement in the new Shout! Factory blu-ray version of ""Billy Jack"" is that it contains English subtitles, while the previous Blu-ray version by Image Entertainment has no subtitles. The newer version also has a significantly louder volume to the audio. But, it completely omits any documentaries or trailers, only has a radio spot, whereas the earlier version has TWO different filmmaker commentary tracks, plus a mini-documentary about the making of the movie, as well as several 1973 re-release TV commercials. Even the menu on the earlier Blu-ray is superior, vastly superior, to the menu on the new one. The new menu contains audio of ""One Tin Soldier"" while the old one only has an irritating drum beat, but the earlier one does have a number of huge still photos from the movie that zoom in and out a bit for a few seconds each, then the photos change. Whereas on the new discs, there is a still artistic rendering of Tom Laughlin as Billy Jack that doesn't change at all (on ALL FOUR discs in this set).

All in all, the Shout! Factory version of ""Billy Jack"" is inferior on all counts to the prior Image Entertainment version except for its louder volume and its inclusion of English subtitles.

The new ""Born Losers"" blu-ray cannot be said to be any sharper than the most recent DVD release, which I also own. Interestingly, it has some grain removed, so it looks like a sort of smoother picture, but it is not sharper than the DVD at all, though I think most people would agree that it is somehow prettier. The problem is, every single defect, artifact, and piece of dirt showing in the DVD's picture exists here in the Blu-ray as well. Nothing was cleaned up. The picture actually jitters mildly in some spots, it's a very slight thing but one can detect it, and in this way, it is identical to the most recent DVD, which, as I recall, was an upgrade in quality compared with previous DVDs of the same film. I would say that the ""Born Losers"" Blu-ray is a definite disappointment, though it does have this somehow smoother look to it than the DVD and thus is an improvement, however minor. It also contains English subtitles. Oh yeah, at 1m38s into the movie, as Vicky narrates the opening and says that, ""All I knew was his name. Billy Jack,"" the English subtitles show ""Bill Jack.""  Seriously.

I don't like (and never have liked) the other two movies, ""The Trial of Billy Jack"" and ""Billy Jack Goes to Washington,"" so I will leave discussions of possible missing segments and music to two of the previous Blu-ray set reviewers, ""kidglov3s"" and ""blood simple.""

I CAN say that the new ""The Trial of Billy Jack"" blu-ray print looks beaten-up, is also a bit unfocused, and shows all kinds of white streaks and artifacts, resulting in a VERY weak-looking, old-looking Blu-ray picture. Really, it's of below-average DVD or VHS quality, even for a 1974 film, and I have lots of DVDs and VHS tapes OF OLDER-THAN-1974 movies whose picture looks better on my high-definition TV set than does this Blu-ray. A very poor job. They obviously started with a weak master print and then decided not to improve it. Wow.

""Billy Jack Goes to Washington"" is the only one of the four films not shown in 16x9; it is presented in letterbox, at a 2.35:1 aspect ratio. This means there are black bars above and below the picture, not my favorite thing but something which movie aficionados seem to love, because it generally means that the film is being presented the way the director intended, with a very wide screen that includes everything, from left to right, that the director wants to include. Anyway, the picture quality is excellent. Not amazing or gorgeous, but of solid Blu-ray quality for a 1977 film. With fine color and sharpness. I don't see anything to complain about on that front. The other two reviewers I mentioned above complained of ""stutters,"" whose meaning I don't know. But I only noticed any picture jitters, if THAT is the definition, in the brief scenes obviously shot from a moving helicopter, mostly at the opening of the movie, and I wouldn't call that a jitter, anyway; it is no different from other movies which have scenes shot from a moving helicopter. Apart from these scenes, I didn't notice any jitter or instability at all in this BR film, whereas that certainly does exist in the new Blu-ray version in this set of ""Born Losers"" as I previously noted. Now, I did not watch every scene of ""Billy Jack Goes to Washington,"" nor remember it (or ""Trial"") much from my theater viewings 40 years ago, so I cannot properly discuss whether any scenes or music were edited out of this film, a complaint of the two reviewers I mentioned above. I have no doubt that they are accurate in their descriptions, however.

Overall, this set is a huge disappointment. I well recall that Shout! Factory absolutely butchered Season 7 of the seminal TV show, ""All in the Family,"" after Sony had done a beautiful job on the first six seasons-- Shout! Factory used the wrong video speed (in frames per second), or something like that, and EVERY episode had weird, faulty-looking, film-like video with out-of-sync audio. When I brought this to Shout! Factory's attention via direct communication with them (as did some other Amazon reviewers), and asked them if they were going to correct this and replace the set, they said that they absolutely were not going to do that. THAT is representative of the ACTUAL so-called ""love and attention they deserve"" that Shout! Factory claims to give their releases. I think they simply do not have the skills, nor desire, nor access to the best film prints, nor perhaps the budget, to make truly excellent Blu-rays and DVDs. Their release of the TV show, ""Room 222,"" has to be one of the worst butcher-jobs ever, as Shout! Factory admittedly didn't have good master prints to work with  (they so warn us on the outer packages of the two DVD seasons they offered, and some episodes look like 3rd-generation VHS recordings!).

This Billy Jack four-disc Blu-ray set is just VERY DISAPPOINTING overall, if not plain poor, and I cannot recommend this purchase as any sort of upgrade unless English subtitles are crucial to the buyer. Only if a potential buyer has never owned any of these films could I possibly recommend purchase of this Blu-ray set, which, in fairness, would be better than nothing.

*** Here's a little tidbit for Billy Jack fans: when I viewed the 1958 Rodgers & Hammerstein film musical SOUTH PACIFIC on blu-ray a few weeks ago, I was shocked to see Tom Laughlin in the opening scene (and a couple of other scenes) as a jaded pilot smoking a cigar. Indeed, he is up in the plane flying the first time we see him. Good for him, I say, but I'd bet he never advertised that when he was a youth-inspiring, anti-establishment rebel in BORN LOSERS, BILLY JACK, etc.  I can see the film trailer now: ""Billy Jack, starring Tom Laughlin, whom you may remember from the charming Rodgers and Hammerstein musical, South Pacific . . . "" NOT!!  I saw him on TV a week later in another 1950s film, 1957's THE DELINQUENTS, and a quick trip subsequently to Wikipedia enlightened me as to his film career pre-Born Losers. Interesting stuff. ***",1501372800,6,10448,4.72243554580362
1368430,1,B00004XPOK,"I am a huge fan of the BILLY JACK series and was excited to see the generally reliable Shout Select announce a blu ray set. Unfortunately, this set has been botched on multiple levels:

THE TRIAL OF BILLY JACK is presented in a pan-and-scan 1.78 aspect ratio, despite the film being shot in 2.35:1, as presented on the Image DVD.

BILLY JACK GOES TO WASHINGTON suffers from frame skipping due to a poor encode.

 Laughlin was known for being a passionate defender of his work and hopefully Shout will correct these mistakes in deference to him. Until then, I'll just stick with my Image dvd set.",1501372800,,595,4.584905660377358

1368432,1,B00004XPOK,"I totally agree with kidglov3s 7-27-17 review of this Billy Jack collection on Blu-ray.  The Blu-ray jacket proclaims ""Experience The Legend Like Never Before!"" and watching The Trial of Billy Jack chopped and cropped is certainly a new experience.  I had reconciled myself to still buying this collection in spite of the cropped version of The Trial of Billy Jack, the crown jewel of the collection.  What I wasn't prepared for was the removal of the emotional climax of the movie, over 3 minutes (near the end) in the church with everyone singing Give Peace a Chance.  I guess a song written by John Lennon was just too expensive for Shout! Factory to clear the rights on.  Or maybe it was a legal entanglement.  Either way, the consumer should be informed about what they are buying.  It would have been better to not release the Blu-ray collection at all, and Amazon should remove it from their website as it will save everyone a lot of trouble in excess returns.

Collateral damage from the 3-minute ""Give Peace a Chance"" scene removal includes disruption of the dual audio commentaries.  With regard to Billy Jack Goes to Washington, the motion stuttering is so pervasive it has rendered the film unwatchable and made the few action scenes laughable.  Releasing a collection in this condition on Blu-ray is unimaginable and unforgivable.  I cannot wait to return this travesty.",1501286400,9,1383,4.8927038626609445
1368433,1,B00004XPOK,"I've been anticipating this release since its announcement last year and through its many delays, only to find myself extremely disappointed that Trial of Billy Jack is cropped from its original widescreen aspect ratio and Billy Jack Goes to Washington is affected by stuttering that renders it unwatchable. The first two films are reasonably well-presented, and it is nice to have Born Losers on Blu-ray, but the star attraction for me was the bizarre delirious fever dream epic that is Trial of Billy Jack. It is the Billy Jack movie that stood the most to gain from a Blu-ray upgrade (with Billy Jack already having a perfectly acceptable Blu-ray on the market), and this release drops the ball so thoroughly that the DVD from almost a decade ago remains preferable for presenting the movie with the widescreen composition intact despite its edge enhancement, low-resolution, visible compression artifiacts and lossy audio. And the same goes for Billy Jack Goes to Washington, which is not cropped but suffers from a very distracting stuttering issue which renders the movie unwatchable (well, more unwatchable, it is Billy Jack Goes to Washington).

I am returning my set, this is the worst Shout! Factory Blu-ray release that I have seen between the issues on TRIAL and WASHINGTON, and I own Body Bags.",1501113600,7,1307,5.050925925925926

These films, along with the Kung Fu TV series, analyze the plight of those who practiced non-violence/ ahimsa in a violent world. While the films are overly long and some of the material incites snickers, they are wonderfully wrought, entertaining, and very sincere. The landscape of New Mexico is beautifully presented. The bad guys are slimy. And Tom Laughlin brings so much depth to the character of Billy Jack, defender of those who have been brutalized and marginalized.

Love seeing Trial of Billy Jack and Billy Jack Goes to Washington in their proper 2.35 aspect ratios (being anamorphic helps tremendously!). This is a killer box set for us fans of independent filmmaking before we even knew there was such a thing. Low budget, yes. But these four films have an impact on us or we wouldn't be wanting them today. Great price for a great set of movies! Each movie gets its own disc for better picture quality. If you are wanting a Billy Jack collection then get ""The Complete Billy Jack Collection"" set from Image Entertainment. You won't be disappointed!

1368614,5,B00004XPOK,"I have an old boyfriend who moved across the country.  We talk about the Billy Jack movies often.  The series influenced both of us a great deal growing up.  This set is the whole series, and it looks and plays beautifully on my blue-ray player.  The movies definitely spoke to both of us, and encouraged us both in our life-long study of shooting and martial arts.  My first husband loved Billy Jack as well, and the movies had the same place in his growing up.  Before Billy Jack went to Viet Nam, he had trained horses.  He came back changed, having gone through special forces training and the experience of war, to a country that had changed as well.  There was little work for a horse trainer, but his needs were modest, and he did his best to get along and just live his life, hurting no one.  But the world is full of bad people, and Billy Jack seemed to run into a lot of them, and that's what these movies are all about.  One day, not very long ago, my old boyfriend called and told me that Tom Laughlin had died.  That was the day a legend died.  Tom Laughlin was a football star, who studied martial arts.  He decided to use his earnings to make his first Billy Jack movie, then went on to make three more.  The movies are dated, and the hippy scene is a bit funny, but the message they contain is still powerful, and through them Tom Laughlin will live on, forever young.",1433894400,9,1384,4.273076923076923

1368625,3,B00004XPOK,"Complete Billy Jack Collection, 4 DVD

These are the four movies that feature the Billy Jack character created by and for Tom Loughlin that illustrated his martial arts skills and his philosophical outlook. Billy Jack is a lone man who often acts to protect people from repression and injustice by powerful interests (like the Lone Ranger or various cowboys in many of the old Western movies). Remember stories about Robin Hood? This medieval outlaw was later turned into a fighter for popular rights centuries later. In the late 19th century Jesse James became another example (he robbed banks and express companies). Billy Jack himself is not an outlaw but skirts the law to provide justice. Laws are created to produce justice, the law should always be subservient to justice. For detailed comments on each of these movies read the individual reviews.

Born Losers [1967] takes place in a California resort town. A biker gang is there {to sell drugs to tourists). The people are afraid of them, the authorities protect them. What can be done to help the people? Who will do it?

Billy Jack [1971] takes place in the southwest. Wild mustangs on Indian lands are being illegally harvested for dog food. Who can stop this? Are there inter-generational conflicts? Who can protect the Freedom School at the reservation? The shocking dramatic scenes made it a big hit at the time.

The Trial of Billy Jack [1974] is the next chapter in this series. The Freedom School continues on an abandoned military base; they start a local TV station. There are references to this era. Billy goes to prison for his self-defense. There are many dramatic scenes that extend its running time. There is more action, some of it echoes actual events.

Billy Jack Goes to Washington [1977] is the last of this series, it was censored by the corporate theater syndicates. It is an updated version of the 1939 movie (Mr. Smith ...) which I found better and more relevant. It called for a National Initiative to allow the people to override the laws passed by and for our corporate ruling class. This would do nothing about the corporate media that controls or influences the thinking of most people, and, can negate the hopes and purpose of an National Initiative. Creating a new media system would result in a New Class to control or influence people. Or am I wrong?",1431561600,,2343,4.818407960199005

1368686,4,B00004XPOK,"I purchased this as a Christmas gift, so haven't opened it yet. Since I have the same set in a larger boxed-set and enjoy it, I'll do my best to compare the two. Each of these disks come in a thin plastic case that is 1/2 the width of a normal DVD case, making it easier to find room for on the shelf.

The slight downside is that these cases are not as durable, and have a smaller spindle to rest the disk on since they are thinner. You'll want to keep the cover around to protect them. I have a different set that uses these cases, and the disks are secure once you make sure they're on the spindle and the case is closed, but the disk may become detached if you're not careful opening them.

Each of the four movies takes on political problems head-on, and challenges viewers about their thoughts, opinions, and actions when injustice pops up. These are very good movies when viewed in the right light. They were made during a time when civil liberties were limited by everything from race and gender to personal choices and beliefs. I watched the first 2 movies many, many times as a child and loved them for more reasons than I can explain. They had a profound impact, and helped shape the person I became.

The movies though, unfortunately, don't depict the TRUE nature of being a ""half-breed"". Not truly one nor the other and accepted by neither. It was TABOO for my Great Grandmother to run off and marry my Great Grandfather to begin with, being the Spiritual leaders DAUGHTER just made things that much worse. They ran back to England but could never escape the ""curse"" of my GG Grandfather. She gave birth to 2 sons, and it was only years later, when she ""felt"" her fathers death was imminent, that they returned to our native British Columbia to seek peace with all. The teaching is, that if you allow the soul to go to the grave with unrest, your Spirit Guide will be forever lost, which means that so too will your soul. Forever bound in purgatory.  It's been told that in the end they were forgiven and my Great Grandfather was accepted as equal, but even today, being of mixed blood has certainly caused my own strife and turmoil.

I began having doubts about...""hippie veracity"" (if that ain't as great an oxymoron as ""politically correct,"" I defy you to show me a better example) very early in 1972 when, after having partaken a little too...""liberally"" (WHOOPS! poor choice of adverb!) of the ""culture,"" I wound up going thru ""rehab,"" ""detox,"" whatever, and listening to some hippie burn-out redundantly play that vapid Steppenwolf song, ""G**D*** The Pusherman."" I remember thinking, ""Hey man, nobody held you - OR me - down and said, ""I'm gonna get ya strung out."" Nope, doesn't work that way: ""existentialism time,"" ol' burn-out and I made our own ""choice,"" we neither were forced. And then, one weekend home on ""leave"" from detox, my cherished Baby Sister wanted to go see a movie - ""Billy Jack."" ""UH...oh,"" I thought. We went, and thank goodness it was at an el-cheapo movie place. And about half an hour into the thing, all the cliches of the culture, the horrid ""music"" (however, ""Exile On Main St"" just could NOT have been released at a better time; thank you, Mick & Keef!), and the loathsome hippie hypocrisy...all reached the ""nuclear"" point in my brain - and a not-so-inaudible explosion resulted. I grabbed my sister by her hand, we stood up and I yelled ""Lt. Calley's being burnt for YOUR sins!,"" and we exited. Furious, I was stopped by the ""manager"" of the theater, who lisped, ""What's the matter, Sir, is there something wrong with the...projection?"" ""Yeah,"" i yelled at him, ""Don't you realize the 'message' of this crap that you're 'projecting' to a lot of young minds who have not had the opportunity to correctly assuage the hypocrisy of the 'hippie culture'?"" Regretfully, I never had the opportunity to play ""wounded liberal"" (there's that word again! this time it's a noun!) and demand the refund of the $3 to which my sister & I were entitled. (In truth, she was about the color of a ripe apple, and was pulling on my arm, ""C'MON, you've made your point, let's get outa here before he calls th' cops!""

To show how bad they were, I fast forwarded several times in both sequels in hopes of finding a better part.

My advise is to buy only the billy jack movie in a stand alone copy, don't bother buying the rest.  The only way you'll like them is if you fall asleep.

I found this set for such a small price and ordered all 4 together. Amazingly, the 4th movie, Billy Jack Goes to Washington, was the best of the 4, and was never released in the theaters!

Most everyone remembers the cheesy little original movie that as teenagers we all loved, but it's nice to watch them all together and see how the story unfolds. In the fourth, again the ""establishment"" is after Indian land, this time for a nuclear plant, and Billy Jack is tricked into being appointed a senator by an old friend of his father's. Anyone who thinks he is going to lay down and roll over when his beloved Native Americans and Jean's school are in danger, doesn't know Billy Jack.  This was some of Laughlin's best work.

The package arrived almost immediately and in good shape, so kudos to the seller too!  I recommend all ex-hippies and young wannabes to take advantage of this great deal in a movie set.",1373673600,4,1080,4.523076923076923
1368867,4,B00004XPOK,"""The Complete Billy Jack Collection"" is suitable for inclusion in a time capsule of pop cultural artifacts from the decade of the 1970s. The Billy Jack films helped to capture and define the zeitgeist of that remarkable decade in American history. And, as movie-watching experiences, the films (mostly) work on a certain, B-movie level. At times the acting and camerawork can border on the amateurish, but for Billy Jack fans that is part of their charm. Tom Laughlin always valued the sincere over the slick, which kept him well out of the Hollywood mainstream. The irony is that in his way he was a filmmaker in the truest myth-making Hollywood tradition.

This collection contains all four Billy jack films, beginning with ""Born Losers,"" a 1967 AIP release with a typical storyline about anti-social yet sexually alluring motorcycle gang members and the groovy mixed-up chicks who love them.  What elevates ""Born Losers"" is Laughlin's performance as Billy Jack, a Vietnam vet trying to readjust to a society that is in the throes of generational and political meltdown. Laughlin here begins establishing himself as a cinematic persona to be reckoned with, placing himself in the great movie tradition of stolid, mostly silent leading men, the type of hero who is a step or two outside of the general community and is slow to anger , but once he does get going not a bad guy is left standing. In essence, Laughlin is trying to create a  Gary Cooper/John Wayne-style  hero for the growing counter-culture.

The second film, ""Billy Jack,"" is where Laughlin hit the commercial jackpot, winning the hearts of young people everywhere looking for a hero the Establishment couldn't kill, imprison, or buy out. In ""Billy Jack"" Laughlin turns the Western genre on its head, both subverting it while paying homage at the same time. Unlike the traditional western, where the hero protects the townspeople from the ""Others"" living on the outskirts, threatening all that is good and holy in American civilization, this time the hero is defending the ""Others"" (the multi-racial students at the special school being run on an Indian reservation) from the townspeople. The movie's conclusion is one of the most memorable film endings  since ""Spartacus.""

""Billy Jack"" had two sequels, also included here, ""The Trial of Billy Jack"" (1974) and ""Billy Jack Goes to Washington"" (1977). ""Trial"" is in many ways the most ambitious of the Billy Jack films, clocking in at close to three hours (but it never really drags) and focusing on the question of violence so prevalent in American society. The trial here is not so much Billy jack's  legal one (which only occupies the first 15 minutes or so of the movie)  as Billy Jack's spiritual trial as he struggles to overcome his own violent demons, set against a backdrop of government-sanctioned massacres ranging from Vietnamese villages to American campuses. A ""vision quest"" sequence in the desert, in which Billy Jack sees how various types of people respond to  violence, contains the most important message you'll ever see in a movie.

""Washington"" is a real curiosity. The movie never had a commercial release, but a series of screenings seems to have earned it status as a  1977 feature film. While ""Washington"" is in many ways the most technically competent film in the series, and features such mainstream performers such as E.G. Marshall and Sam Wanamaker, it suffers from heavy cutting and re-editing (the Leonard Maltin Guide gives it a running time of 155 minutes, the version in this collection clocks in at 114 minutes). A storyline concerning a shadowy conspiracy involving a nuclear power industry scandal which dominates much of the first half of the film is virtually absent in the film's second hour. Indeed, much of the last half of the film is about a filibuster staged by Billy Jack, now a senator. This was back in the day when a filibuster was a historic, stop-the-presses event, not the routine everyday Senate way of conducting (or not conducting) business that it is today. The film is interesting in how it parallels the journey America took from the late 1960s, the age of Johnson & Nixon, to the late 1970s, with the Bicentennial and the election of Jimmy Carter. Most Americans were still willing to believe the country was good at heart, and its governing institutions could still work, if only the voice of the people could be heard, and the public good would overcome the special interests and back-room deal makers. Americans would never be so innocent again.

 have always believed that Laughlin was under-rated as a filmmaker, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Complete-Billy-Jack-Collection-Born-Losers-Billy-Jack-The-Trial-of-Billy-Jack-Billy-Jack-Goes-to-Washington/dp/B0029Z8K7O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Complete Billy Jack Collection (Born Losers/Billy Jack/The Trial of Billy Jack/Billy Jack Goes to Washington)</a>&nbsp;confirms it. Critics have tended to focus on what they see as Laughlin's simplistic utopianism politics or perceived hypocrisy in preaching peace while delivering  plenty of karate chops and martial arts action.

Close viewing of this movies, however, reveals that Laughlin was more nuanced that critics gave him credit for. In ""Billy Jack"", for example, the main villain is a young man about the same age as the target audience. The film's main authority figure, the town sheriff, is depicted as a basically decent man, trying to hold the center together. Neither side in the generational conflict, Laughlin is saying, has a monopoly on good and evil. In the Kent State-style massacre that concludes ""Trial,"" the National Guardsmen are depicted as nervous kids, placed in a high stress situation by powerful forces beyond their control, a metaphor for soldiers in any war any where.

As for the charges of hypocrisy, Laughlin the filmmaker knows that movies have to work on an emotional level, and yes, for many in the audience seeing bigoted rednecks or CIA assassins getting karate kicks to the head can be a cathartic  experience. And the movies do wrestle with the ethical question of the role of violence in effecting social change, a dilemma  many were struggling with in the wake of the riots and assassinations of the late 1960s. I believe Laughlin deserves credit for facing these type of issues head-on, instead of just ducking them.

The movies in ""The Complete Billy jack Collection"" have excellent sight and sound quality, and include audio commentary by the filmmakers.

""Billy Jack"" alone is probably an essential must-have for any movie collector who wants a representative sample of movies that defined the 1970s. This ""Complete Collection"" gives you four movies essentially for the price of one. You may not always agree with Laughlin's politics or you may at times roll your eyes at some of the bad production values and acting (check out Elizabeth James' performance in ""Born Losers"" which is a clinic in out of this world line readings) but you won't find many other movies released in the past 40 years that are anything like them.",1372982400,10,7103,5.196850393700787

1368909,4,B00004XPOK,"The first Billy Jack film, ""Born Losers"" is something that in it's day was new and interesting. One thing about ""Billy Jack"" films, they decline in government confidence with each movie on. It is a very immature set of bully films where evil landowners,and especially big daddy government, rape and kill innocent passive minded liberals and Indians in particular. They are period pieces, centered in the 70s. The Trial of Billy Jack places him in Vietnam when Lt. William Caley gives the order to kill a bunch of innocent civilians with Jack refusing to participate and subsequently placed in custody and that is the positive part! The last film IS Mr. Smith Goes to Washington almost to a ""T"", which is probably the reason it was never released. The Government is really bad, post-Watergate and Nixon and uses everything at it's disposal to cheat honest men and women. Well, who would have thought that Billy Jack films would be somewhat prophetic in this day and age! As we enter an age where Government resembles something out of an Orwell novel, even Billy Jack can't Karate the technology laden evil that pervades modern society. This leads us to consider what would a Billy Jack character do about the situation today? He'd probably be an ""Oath Keeper"", appear on ""Coast to Coast"", join Chuck Norris in a political strategy and be the new spokesman for the NRA....and be a victim of a remote missile fired from a drone flying over Indian territory in Arizona.",1362268800,,1465,4.817460317460317

On a broader scale racisn, sexism, corruption and greed all are addressed.  Before the critiques come, if u are looking for Olivier or Helen Mirren league of acting -don't.  The acting varies although I thought Tom laughlin did do a few scenes that went beyond action hero and were well done...I especially like the end of Billy Jack goes to Washington.

1368960,5,B00004XPOK,"I just wanted to let you know how much I enjoyed seeing these old favorites again. They are, of course, aged or dated, but the message or theme of these movies is just as relevant now as they always were. And I might enjoy these as much as I do because I am part indian and was raised in that way. One of our great Holy men, John Rolling Thunder Pope was in a couple of scenes in The Trial of Billy Jack. Including the sunrise ceremony at the beginning of the movie. What some people might not know is that some of the content of these movies were based in reality. There was a great deal of racism against the Indian people in those days. And of course there was also violence. Rolling Thunder's family was touched by that racism and fear in a very bad way. Rolling Thunder, or RT as many people called him, was a very good and kind man. He would, and did, help anyone who came to him and asked for his help. He was a true servant to the medicine. And he would help people of every race with his healing gift. He believed that we are all the children of the same Creator. And he almost never passed up the opportunity to help educate people of every race as to our sacred relationship with our Mother, If anyone is interested, there are a couple of books about Rolling Thunder. The one I liked best was simply called Rolling Thunder, by Doug Boyd. It is a real classic. And the same author wrote an equally good book called Mad Bear.",1334102400,10,1434,4.180505415162455

That being said, I always try to review a video that is rated way to high or low.  This video deserves a ""minus 5"" for many reasons. First the sound quality was totally lacking with cracking, popping and with horrible volume fluctuations and listening to the low budget ""fireside"" songs were pure torture. The student composition and reason for being of the unbelievably ridiculous school charter, and actions of the townspeople was totally amateurish. The combination of terrible wrting and directing even for T. C. Frank made it worse. This low budget video obviously used unskilled actors with a weak story line and plagued with time filling ""skits"". Even the ""kung Fu"" actions shots were obviously choreographed in slow motion, and played back at high speed. This 40 year old film was re-released with the promotional catch phrase of ""A box-office success with an attractive plot for modern-day youth' while clever, it lacked any realistic basis. Even the amateurish acting was over done or totally lacking and the long songs to fill up the almost 2 hours of film was embarrassingly high school quality. I am sorry, but this is the worst movie/video and story line since  ""John De Bello's Attack of the killer tomatoes"", and as a cult favorite spoof I actually liked it enough to buy it.",1332374400,2,1402,4.813278008298755

Lucky for me I was able to fake illness and stay in our parked car while my parents shopped, right across from a drive-in theater. Seriously, the first time I saw the film was the silent first 1/2. When the VHS era dawned I finally saw it complete as a ""talkie"" uncut. I loved it. Next I saw ""Born Losers"" and was hooked. These are not movies to be appreciated on their own merit. Trying that is like watching Pink Floyd's ""The Wall"" straight, you probably won't appreciate it. These movies are time capsules that speak to the part of us that would love to take our foot and....well you get it. They stir memories, they may make you sad when you realize how little time changes, they will make you do a 1/4 head turn at most of the dialogue but they do entertain. Billy Jack IMO deserves a new chapter. Today almost demands it. Sadly if Hollywood 2012 tried it would likely be an Apatow dick/fart/smoke weed farce.

There is one scen in the first movie, ""Born Loser's"" where Billy Jack walks over to this black box hanging on the wall and had a hand set attached by a cord.  he put a coin in this machine and started to twist this rotary dial thing on the front.  My Granddaughters marveled at this item (they had never seen a Pay Phone before), one girl remarked he should have just used his cell phone.

The movies were well reproduced and the picture quality was as good or better than what was shown on Big Screen back in the 70's.  Sound quality was well reprodeuced also.

1368991,4,B00004XPOK,"I bought this boxed set for my wife several years ago. We've watched it repeatedly since then, and Tom Laughlin never fails to entertain us. I didn't realize there were four movies until I read about it on Laughlin's web-site, but my wife's favorite move was The Trial of Billy Jack since she was a little kid. I would say ""Born Losers"" is when Laughlin was figuring out how to make a movie. It follows a little different plot line from the rest. ""Billy Jack"" is a good movie for what it is. The acting is bad, but it has many great lines and the subject matter is solid. It just has bad acting similar to a lot of late-sixties movies. ""The Trial of Billy Jack"" is probably the best movie of the collection. It has the best acting and some really good film work. ""Billy Jack Goes to Washington"" is a bit over the top for my taste.

It's probably good to get the entire collection and judge for yourself. They're not masterpieces, but I find them entertaining. The set also includes quite a few extras that tell about the making of the movies. Those are very interesting if you're a Billy Jack fan.

On top of that he was a half-breed Indian/White mix who lived on the reservation and was its policeman.  All of these facts helped to make the films great (in particular, Billy Jack).  They get into Native American Mysticism and draw a clear line in the sand between right and wrong.  They may not have the best scripts, nor the best acting, but they are definitely among the best B-movies ever made.  Additionally, Billy Jack had the best theme song ever.  ""One Tin Soldier"" by Coven was even banned from the radio for a time.  The message of the song and the movie definitely go hand and hand.  Whether or not you have seen any of the films, this is a great buy and I know I'll enjoy mine with my grandchildren for years and years.

1368994,5,B00004XPOK,"Some reviewers want to rate these movies by today's standards and that is a little unfair to this set of B-movies.  The movie ""Billy Jack"" was one of the most popular movies of it's time.  It was released and re-released dozens of times in theaters and drive-ins back in the day.  A movie that led to films like ""Walking Tall"", ""Macon County Line"" and more.  These movies are very dated, but fun to watch.  ""Billy Jack Goes To Washington"" was a victim of it's own ideals when the right to film in areas of Washington, D.C. was yanked upon hearing of it's plot line.  If the Billy Jack films were released today, with today's technology and multiple media outlets, there probably would have been more films and might have led to a TV series, as well.  These films aren't just about going up against 'the man', they are also about the injustice and mistreatment of the American Indian back in the day.  Tom Laughlin is now in his 70's and won't be making any more Billy Jack films.  Enjoy these for the time that they were in and the memories they bring back.

As soon as it arrived, I put The Trial of Billy Jack in my DVD player and sat for nearly three hours in front of my T.V.  When it was over, I nearly cried.  The movie that I had spent a big part of my life waiting in anticipation to watch was a piece of garbage.  First, it is way too long.  It should have been cut down to about a two hour run time.  It is overly preachy.  I became very agitated with Delores Taylor's constant sermoninzing about society's ills.  But, my biggest complaint is Billy Jack's journey into the Cave of the Dead.  Billy Jack meets his spirit guide, who looks like a member of the Blue Man Group.  The film Billy Jack, in my opinion, is a 70's masterpiece.  How Tom Laughlin and Delores Taylor dropped the ball with this sequel will remain a great mystery to me.  My only other complaint about this collection is the audio.  They have remastered it for 5.1 surround and it is an atrocious mix.

1369003,3,B00004XPOK,"""Born Losers"" is very good. One of those classic B-movies that lasts the test of time. Not perfect, but very good.

""Billy Jack,"" the highest-grossing of the four movies, is surprisingly kind of boring. It needs some serious editing. It's about 115 minutes long, but would be better at 80 or 85 minutes. There's a lot of scenes with kids and teens singing folk songs, but the songs aren't that good. And there's some scenes where kids/teens are doing some theater, and these are really, mind-numbingly boring. It would have been better if the teens had more dialog and character development.

""The Trial of Billy Jack"" is an atrocious mess of a movie. More theater and singing and lots of forced political speeches. The acting is horrendously painful to watch at some points. And Billy Jack goes through a seemingly drug-induced (or rattlesnake poison-induced) metaphysical transition from normal human to Indian spirit person, or something like that. Really bizarre scenes, and really boring. No offense to Native Americans, but the scenes are just not done very well. The movie is just under three hours and I had to fast forward through a lot of it--it became unbearable.

I wasn't expecting much with ""Billy Jack Goes to Washington,"" but it was actually pretty good. There's better actors in this one and the story is interesting. After the awful third movie, ""Billy Jack Goes to Washington"" could have won an Academy Award.

All in all, I think just about anyone could find something to like about ""Born Losers,"" but the other three require a lot more patience, especially the middle two where the plots are just not very well constructed and the pacing is way too slow.",1291507200,11,1675,4.866666666666666

Tom Laughlin managed to create a mythic character from that 60's anti-establishment nonsense that we thought would change the world.  We did.  We made it worse.  I remember watching this movie in New York City on a triple bill with Let It Be and Gumshoe with Albert Finney.  Later on, I found out that it was really a test screening by Tom Laughlin.  We made him very, very happy that night.  The audience went crazy.  This film is firmly rooted in the idealism of the 60s, and that's exactly why it endures.  Some of the dialog sounds goofy, but that's only because idealism is a joke today.  And the joke is on us.  There are no more ideas people are willing to live and die for.

I can watch The Born Losers and Billy Jack, but I find The Trial of Billy Jack to be too long (even though I saw it multiple times in the theater when it was originally released), and Billy Jack Goes to Washington is a horrible remake of the classic Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.

Unfortunately, this set goes down hill from there (and it goes down fast).  I have just finished watching the third in the series (The Trial ... ).  I don't know if I can stand much more.  Almost everything about these movies are rediculous: writing, acting, editing, music (other than Born Losers), etc.  Sound is so bad as to be unintelligible during much of ""The Trial ...""

Thanks to Image Entertainment fans of Tom Laughlin can once again experience the world of ""Billy Jack"" in this incredible 4 disc boxed set. Image Entertainment states that all 4 films feature a new spectacular high-definition digital transfer for unsurpassed film quality! While the films have been cleaned up considerably for this DVD release, the transfers still suffer from little blemishes here and there but nothing to detract from the overall viewing experience. These new video transfers are better than any previous versions I've ever seen and the new 5.1 surround sound is a definite improvement in my opinion.

This fantastic 4 disc set from Image Entertainment is well done and any ""Billy Jack"" fan would be happy to own it. The disc packaging is great. Each disc comes in a nicely decorated slim case with slip cover and disc artwork. Each film contains two Audio Commentaries from the filmmakers and I personally found them very interesting. Tom Laughlin fans can now rejoice ""Billy Jack"" is here to stay!

I bought it because I'd seen the first 3 films when I was a kid and wanted to see them again out of nostalgia. I also wanted to see the 4th film - now that I have I can see why it never really got released. It's easily the worst of the lot.

It's funny to see hippies and wannabe flower children praising this dreck. Laughlin's message of pacificity and non-violence is laughable when the moments everyone watches these films for are the ones where Billy takes off his boots and delivers a whooping to ""The Man"". Doesn't anyone see the hypocrisy in this?

Look how the ""Freedom School"" students behave. They come across as pretty angry in the second film, and the violence in the third film is totally their fault. What about the ""peace"" and ""love"" they keep harping about? The evil townspeople are more reasonable than the supposedly peaceful hippie kids!

Also, Laughlin should have learned the fine art of the edit. There are line flubs that were just left in the film, and as tortuously long as these films are, you have to get the feeling that he put everything he shot into the finished product. Boring speeches, tedious dialogue and horrid folk songs abound! And don't get me started on all of the street-theater and rap-session junk.

Look - Tom Laughlin made a few movies that were wildly successful and made himself a ton of money, that can't be disputed. The first movie is actually not that bad, and the Billy Jack character is at least reasonable in that film. But it all went to hell in a handbasket after that - the last 3 films were pretty horrid.

To all of you who are lauding this stuff, really watch these movies and see what message Laughlin was trying to send - really tune in to his worldview at the time. He saw this country as a hate-filled, ugly nation, and the paranoia represented is over the top. Here's where the grandiosity complex comes in. Who can save us all but someone like Billy Jack? Even though he's the biggest hypocrite of the lot (but I don't think we're supposed to notice that), he's represented as a force of ""good"". That's highly debatable if you really look at Billy Jack's actions. Look at the stuff Laughlin has written since these films - it's almost like he thinks he really is this movie antihero he's made up.

Laughlin tapped into the counterculture psyche and made a fortune's worth of that filthy green money that hippies so despised. Ironic, hm?

I gave this collection 2 stars only because if you want to torture yourself or a loved one or few, $15 for the set is a good deal. If you aren't a hippie or don't hate yourself, you may want to pass. Peace!",1275350400,6,2678,4.453061224489796

1369041,4,B00004XPOK,"I watched the original ""Billy Jack"" many times and dreamed about being a part of this whole counter culture group. To me it wasn't funny garbage, but a very appealing way to live. I'm glad Amazon is offering the whole set of Billy Jack movies at an affordable price. The reason I gave it a four instead of a five star review is the fact that I now realize that as appealing as this lifestyle was to me as a teen from an alcoholic home, it may not be all that living in a fantasy world, I made it out to be. As a child and especially as a teen, I very much wanted to escape from the miserable reality of my horrid family situation. Having said that ""Billy Jack"" is a very enjoyable move.",1268006400,,686,4.088888888888889

1369044,5,B00004XPOK,This series really exemplfies the conflict of the sixties and seventies.  Not just the racial tention of the time but also how some veiwed the returning Vietnam Vets.  Billy Jack is a man at war with himself as much as protecting the people around him.  While some of the action may be lost on those who did not see the bigotry of the era none of the heart can be missed.  Tom Laughlin gives an outstanding performance with all the toughness and tenderness one human can give another.,1258156800,2,484,4.465909090909091
1369045,5,B00004XPOK,Billy Jack is a one of a kind movie and story. The kind of a guy that everyone would like to be. The Robin Hood of our time. Filmed differently from other movies. The difference made the movie what it is. Great!!,1255478400,5,212,4.071428571428571
1369046,5,B00004XPOK,"We live in troubled times. It appears we no longer have any heroes. Who can we look up to? No one....but luckily 1970s icon Billy Jack is back to give us all hope.

We've been suppressed by ""The Man"" for too long. ""The Man"" is both Democrat and Republican. ""The Man"" is whoever is in power over the decent, hard working common folk.

Billy Jack takes on ""The Man"" in this great DVD collection. Billy Jack is a half-breed Indian, West Point grad, and Vietnam vet, who although trys to remain true to his pacifist beliefs, will take on the ""The Man"" when ""The Man"" hurts the little guy. Better watch out when Billy Jack takes off his boots!

Billy Jack is not some mindless machine of violence. He usually ends up in a debate with Jean, the woman he loves, over the use of violence as a problem solving tactic.

By today's standards, these movies are kinda slow, full of dialog and debate over civil rights, government corruption, and being hassled by ""The Man."" Oh, and these films feature long stretches of girls with long blonde hair, parted down the middle, singing earnest [ie. out of tune] folks songs.

This collection is fantastic. We get wonderful widescreen transfers of the 4 classic Billy Jack movies.

Highly recommended.",1254268800,85,1232,4.628440366972477

If you are a Billy Jack fan, you wish there was another after Billy Jack goes to Washington (a Mr Smith goes to Washington clone).Tom Laughlin playing Billy Jack makes these films work so well. The question is why isn't he involved in films today?

On the whole this is  good small 1970-80 filmmaking is about. thirty years later, these small films are still watrchable and enjoyable
