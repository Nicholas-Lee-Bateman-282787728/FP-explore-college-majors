7986598,5,B00008RH1F,"Very funny Angela Mao vehicle. (from 1976 not 1980 also known as ""Wu Quan"") She plays a character named Fei Fei who is seeking vengeance for the deaths of some friends she just met, as well as trying to help two older kung-fu masters decide who is the better fighter. Much comedy is provided by these two men. One is a drunk with a prominent red nose and the other is smoking something that causes hilariously goofy music to play whenever he takes a hit off his pipe. Angela is very funny, mixing in a good deal of slapstick with straight fighting, in the various combat scenes. Also funny are nods to both Clint Eastwood's man with no name and Henry Mancini's Pink Panther theme. Recommended to those looking for a more light hearted martial arts flick. Jackie Chan is the martial arts director in this movie (opening credit states ""Sing Lung"" which is Jackie's Chinese name).",1524441600,,877,4.592356687898089

7986600,2,B00008RH1F,Not as good as I thought it would be. The action is slow and the final fight is too long and boring. If the fighting was exciting I wouldn't care how long the final fight was.,1314921600,,175,3.888888888888889
7986601,3,B00008RH1F,"A friend of mine gave me this movie since he found it on the streets. I know the band Wu-tang clan and I appreciate kung fu movies, so I was delighted to see that some rap band had something to do with a random Hong Kong action movie.
The fights where fantastic, and i learned afterwards that jackie chan was the choreographer of all those very long lasting scenes. Everything seems to be like a comic dance.",1301788800,,408,4.311688311688312
7986602,5,B00008RH1F,"Superstar Jackie Chan action directs this kung fu classic, starring Lady Kung Fu herself, Angela Mao Ying. The long braid Mantis King is out to destroy the Beggar Clan once and for all. It's up to the Beggar Queen to stop the kung fu holocaust from happenning. Jackie Chan was at the top of his game when he took on this epic project. Top flight hand techniques and skills are the trademark of this classic. Do not miss this.",1255910400,2,425,4.3924050632911396
7986603,4,B00008RH1F,"I enjoyed this Flicc alot, angela does her thing in this one. she plays a guy but sounds like a woman, kinda weird. but ive seen weirder. its actually a three star movie but i gave it a extra star for the extras ground zero included. the quality is pretty good considering it came from ground zero but its a vhs transfer. im happy to have it in my collection..",1228694400,,360,4.1571428571428575
7986604,3,B00008RH1F,"This flick was directed by Jackie Chan.  ""Dance Of Death"" could have been a 4 star easily.  I though this flick was just o.k,,,,I'm a big fan of the ""crazy horse kung fu"", which is very rare in kung fu movies. This movie highlighted that kung fu style very nicely I though,,,however, I felt it went over-board in the final fight scene, which resulted the fight became extremely boaring,,,I swear,,this went on for approximately 20 mins. That is why I ended up giving this film a 3 star.  However, the choreography was nicely done.",1149465600,,530,4.617021276595745
7986605,3,B00008RH1F,"First things first: ""Hand of Death"" is packed to the gills with fight scenes. I don't think five minutes go by without there being a fight. The fights (choreographed by none other than Jackie Chan) are well-done, too, and they usually go on for extended periods of time. With that out of the way, I might as well say that the plot (about a woman, yawn, avenging someone's death) is weak and the comedy regrettable, but, really, who cares? Lots of people get kicked in the head. If you can find this for $4, like I did, you'll have fun.
The DVD from Ground Zero's Wu-Tang Clan line has the image in the 1.33:1 aspect ratio, severely cropped from its probable 2.35:1 aspect ratio. The image is scratchy and faded - not a surprise for something found in the bargain bin. The audio is dubbed, which sort of adds to the movie's campy charm.
There are surprisingly quite a few extras, the best of which are a bunch of bonus fight scenes from other Ground Zero releases. There's also a featurette called ""Secrets of the Young Master"" (basically, a guy showing some kung-fu moves), a Wu-Tang Clan music video, and a few Ground Zero trailers.",1121212800,6,1133,4.53170731707317
