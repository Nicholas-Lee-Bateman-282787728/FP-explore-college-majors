8414464,5,B00439GWQA,"A very good and well deserved documentary about the late and great comedienne. Those who saw her (especially during the UnCabaret days) know how great she was. And for those who haven't heard of her, this doc is  a highly recommended. If you like Kathy Griffin (who was friends with Judy and is in the film), you'll love Judy Toll. In fact, Kathy is/was clearly influenced by Toll, who helped push her to start doing stand-up. A great portrait of an extremely funny, complicated and under-appreciated talent.",1432598400,,508,4.839080459770115

8414467,4,B00439GWQA,"I grew up in the house Directly across from the Toll home.  Judy taught me to walk along a curb so I could do balance beam on the cheerleader squad one day...Judy could also to cartwheels, backbends, and back handsprings, and I was the pesky little girl from across the street  Judy was always kind to everyone.  We missed her greatly when she moved out to California!  And we are still missing her today.  I am about to buy the DVD about her life.
God Bless",1388793600,2,458,4.27906976744186
8414468,5,B00439GWQA,"This movie documents the life of a very funny woman, Judy Toll. I knew Judy in college and she was hilarious then and continued to be throughout her unfortunately brief life. She was as funny as Gilda Radner and just as fearless. I think that even people who never knew Judy would appreciate this movie for how it documents just how difficult it is to gain fame as a standup comedian. You have to have talent, but you also need a little bit of luck. I really enjoyed the movie and I encourage anyone who has had a friend or loved one die from cancer to buy this, as all the proceeds go to the John Wayne Cancer Foundation.",1294531200,4,622,4.235294117647059
