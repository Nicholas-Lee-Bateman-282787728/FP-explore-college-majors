7945804,3,B00005MM6J,"Released only about a year after the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Snakeeater/dp/B00005MM6I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Snakeeater</a>, its sequel continues the over-the-top adventures of Lorenzo Lamas' first action hero character. People who didn't enjoy the first one aren't going to do much better with this, and conversely, fans of the first shouldn't be too apprehensive to pick this up. Personally, however, I consider this a minor step down, if only for the reduced amount of action.

The story: sent to an asylum for murdering drug dealers responsible for the death of children, Soldier (Lamas) continues his personal war on drugs by sneaking out of captivity by night to take the fight to the pushers and suppliers.

The devastation of addictive drugs is a common theme in action movies, but Lamas goes after it with a gusto that would impress Steven Seagal. It's not even a personal situation for Soldier - the principle victim is the sister of his eventual sidekick (Larry Scott,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Space-Camp/dp/B00015HVM4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Space Camp</a>) - yet he dives right into the fight. Some might argue this is simply poorly-conceived character motivation, but I don't mind. If you can't deal with illogical and crazy situations, you've come to the wrong film, `cause it's full of `em. The institution he's sent to (after his weirdo lawyer pleads insanity) is so poorly run that the patients regularly converge on the rooftop to play wheelchair sumo; Soldier later devises death traps for his dealer-victims that include an impaling machine and a toilet bomb; and somehow a relatively small fire results in a full-body burning. (SPOILER) I don't want to give away too much, but the way Soldier eventually does away with the amassed drug lords is simultaneously the most grisly and apt means I can think of. Plainly, this film's as nuts as its predecessor, and that's its main attraction.

Dramatic performances are a bit laid back, by comparison. Lamas plays this one low-key, and while there are some nutsy characters to be seen here, they're almost exclusively found in the institution, away from the action. Larry Scott adds his name to the list of many performers whose considerable charisma is directed to a role that's too hammy and immature to be taken seriously, but he's still fun to watch. Disappointingly, when it comes to the action content, there's not much to watch: some shooting here and there, the wheelchair duel, plus a single fistfight compose the totality of genuine adrenaline pieces. The first movie wasn't exactly overflowing with action either, but it supplied a bit more than the minimum to keep things exciting. ""The Drug Buster"" is teetering on that minimum, and that's its major falling point. A couple more brawls and a more coordinated shootout would have boosted this one's rating up an extra star, but as an action movie above all, I can't justify more than three.

For fans of Lamas' B-movies, this one's worth picking up at a decent price. Fans of cinematic cheese will be pleased with what this happens. Action fans in general can do better, and anyone who prides himself a respectable connoisseur need not apply at all. Know yourself before purchasing.",1362960000,,3327,5.380038387715931
7945805,4,B00005MM6J,"""Snakeeater"" was such compelling cinema, that I had to turn around and watch ""Snakeeater II: The Drug Buster"" the very same day! Of course this cheesy series was made in Canada and goes so far as to feature a tribute to the glories of Canadian cinema (ponder) in the extras, but imagine my surprise when the credits were entirely in French, although some of the translations are questionable. After some gospel music that seems out of place and the credits for ""L' Indomptable II,"" we open in an urban dance class of some sort with some truly hilarious dancing. All of which raises the question: why is Lorenzo Lamas (""Soldier Kelly"") there? The answer is he's a juvenile parole counselor or some such, because he cares so much about the urban youth. If you guessed that an urban youth couldn't get past the first scene without dying on the dance floor of rat poison-infused drugs, you're right! You could have a career in Canadian screenwriting!

Soldier takes an imaginative urban teen, Speedboat (Larry B. Scott) under his tutelage, and they begin a ""Dirty Harry""-esque campaign of ridding the world of drug pushers with the assistance of Speedboat's sister, who is a high-ranking prostitute to the mob. Because he acknowledges killing four pushers, Soldier is sent to a plush psychiatric hospital for evaluation by the sexy Dr. Pierce (Michele Scarabelli,) who for some reason is also providing him with legal advice. This asylum diverges significantly from reality: prisoners can have sharp utensils, light fires, order pizza delivery, and leave essentially at will. They also have very nice rooms. The asylum is, sadly, also the residence of the most annoying character in the film, ""Torchy"" the arsonist played by Arnold Horshack himself, Ron Palillo. (At least he doesn't say ""Ooh-ooh-ooh!"" at any time.) It's also where a contest is played with wheelchairs and a flagpole on a rooftop. Sure it's the stupidest game ever, but adds a lot to the running time, and cranks the cheese factor up to eleven.

After failing to fall from the roof of the asylum, Soldier figures out how to escape at will so he and Speedboat can continue their murderous revenge on the drug dealers. To do this they adopt an array of disguises, such as fire extinguisher replacement technicians (really,) health inspectors (linguini sauce laxative spiking jokes never fail to please), and plumbers (in a truck reading ""You Dump, We Pump"" on the side; there are graphic scenes of toilet maintenance as an added bonus.) If all this sounds like a jumbled mess so far, it may help if you think of this as a mutant combination of ""MacGyver,"" ""Dirty Harry,"" and ""Body Rock."" Eventually, as you may have correctly guessed, there's a huge meeting of all the chief mobsters in charge of the drug trade. The plot resolution is truly something to behold: there is no end of unrealistic gunplay and fisticuffs, a subplot about using the same rat poison the bad guys use to cut the drugs on the hoodlums in a sealed vault, and even a fish tank electrocution ploy!

How could this movie get any cheesier? Well, since you asked, Speedboat gets arrested and is sent to the asylum to live in comfort, while Soldier is found not guilty by reason of insanity of 22 murders, and is remanded into the custody of the hot doctor for mental discipline and rehabilitation! If that doesn't leave you breathless, perhaps the closing credits (in French, of course) accompanied by more gospel music will send you over the edge into bad movie delirium. This is a truly dreadful movie when viewed in a conventional manner, but as a B-movie of laughably epic proportions, it is in a league with few other giants.",1282435200,,3661,4.826433121019108
7945806,3,B00005MM6J,"It's hard not to give five stars to a movie that features a wheelchair fight on the roof of an insane asylum.  Hard to do, but I'm going to be strong...

Snakeeater 2, a.k.a. ""Snake Eater 2"" varies wildly from the original Snakeeater movie that allowed Lorenzo Lamas to step out of the giant shadow cast by his father, the late, great Fernando (insert Abba joke here). Lamas is back as Soldier, with a LAST NAME this time, so now he's called Soldier Kelly. Seems Soldier is so gosh-darned crazy and in-your face (again) to his wimpy cop bosses (this was filmed in Canada, remember) that he ends up with the choice of either jail-time or an insane asylum for his ways. CAN'T YOU JUST ACCEPT HIM FOR WHO HE IS??? Anyway, Soldier ends up at the local nut-house, populated by some colorful characters who all just happen to be bad actors. Horshack from ""Welcome Back..."" makes a return appearance. Also, there's a Jim Baker televangelist clone in there. So, Soldier keeps breaking out to do his version of justice: rigging cowardly traps, killing people in cold blood, blowing up bathroom stalls, etc. AND this time he has a cool, urban sidekick named Speedboat (Larry B. Scott); a dude that looks like he got lost on the way to a Bell, Biv, DeVoe concert and ended up in this movie. Oh, that Speedboat, what with his witty lines and all.

Anyway, this movie is nowhere near as violent as the first and there's no nudity, so if you are hoping to see Speedboat's hot sister starkers, forget it. There are two reasons to see this: 1.) the afore-mentioned wheelchair fight on the roof of the nut-house and 2.) the way they kill the drug-runners...OK, and 3.) Speedboat's sister. That's about it. Harmless and somewhat fun drivel; great for watching at 3am while loaded.

DVD features are minimal; can be watched in both English and dubbed in French.  Also has a small documentary of the Canadian production house that made the ""Snakeeater Trilogy.""  Pretty cool opening menus with a neat motorcycle sound.  VRRROOOM!",1105401600,2,2009,4.690340909090909
