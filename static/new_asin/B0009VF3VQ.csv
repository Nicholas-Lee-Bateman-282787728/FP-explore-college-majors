2325096,5,B0009VF3VQ,"I am a beginner learning line dances and I bought this CD to get myself started. The lessons are taught step-by-step and are easy to follow since the instructor shows you a few moves at a time and shows them from different angles. You build on previous moves and before you know it, you're dancing! I have already applied some of the dances at a local club, and I was so proud that I was able to do them! I completely recommend this to anyone, beginner or not, if you want to learn the dances on this CD. I never floundered, never got lost and practiced a few times and had it down pat. The instructor really knows how to teach.",1138492800,43,628,4.198347107438017
2325097,5,B0009VF3VQ,"I own many dance instuction tapes and DVD's, but they're all collecting dust. Not, Shawn Trautman's. I have 4 of his now. This is the best instuctor out there. Anyone, and I mean anyone can learn to dance with his DVD's.",1132272000,23,220,4.390243902439025
2325098,5,B0009VF3VQ,"I had fun learning to do these dances.  The 10 step is my favorite (I know it's easy, but I have fun doing it often).  I enjoyed learning and practicing.  I'm even getting my boyfriend into it. Thanks",1132099200,17,200,4.2105263157894735
2325099,5,B0009VF3VQ,"One of the things I like most about this dvd
is the way Shawn spends time on the basic dance
and then introduces variations that make doing
the dance even more fun. If you go to a live dance
you are ready to spice things up for a more enjoyable
time with your friends.",1312848000,2,268,3.9814814814814814
2325100,5,B0009VF3VQ,"Strong recommendation if you are looking for some fun line dances. I have three of his line dance video's and each is well done. Shawn is an excellent instructor and really makes it easy to learn from. I have told several friends of mine about Shawn's video's and will continue spreading the word!

2325101,5,B0009VF3VQ,"I just completed this video and Party Line Dances and really liked it. It moves faster than Line Dance 101 and this time I was ready for it. Shawn is such a great instructor and I highly recommend him. The only thing I wish was different is the music; I wish it was to the actual songs, but i understand why he didn't use them (still wish they were different though).",1221091200,,367,4.183098591549296
2325102,2,B0009VF3VQ,"This video is nice because it shows you many different camera angles, so if you're a person who has a tough time catching on, that is helpful.  However, the dances aren't even taught to good country music and it's hard to adapt the dances to real life.  This is a good video if you just want to learn to do them at your own house and dance to the video to get a little exercise.",1220400000,6,378,4.026666666666666
2325103,5,B0009VF3VQ,Taken line dancing?  Throw away all you learned and do it the easy way with Shawn Trautman.  I keep buying a couple of volumes at a time and amenjoying every minute. I can't understand why anyone wants to make this seem complicated.,1191283200,3,232,4.5
2325104,5,B0009VF3VQ,Great DVD. Shawn's DVD make learning to line dance easy and fun. His methods of instruction get an A+ from this teacher.,1178236800,5,120,4.5
2325105,5,B0009VF3VQ,I have several of the Shawn Trautman collection - they are all very professionally done. I think this is my favorite so far!,1166227200,8,124,4.434782608695652
2325106,5,B0009VF3VQ,"So you know a few line dance steps and you want to get out on the dance floor. Essential Line Dances (Vol 1) is for you!

Shawn Trautman introduces the beginner/intermediate dancer to several popular line dances in this volume.  If you already know the basics of line dancing it will be easy for you to follow along the first time  through as Shawn breaks the dances down step by step.

Even if you haven't danced before, each step is explained in detail and can be learned after a couple viewings (and with practice, of course!)

In addition to teaching the basic steps, Shawn offers alternative steps depending on your dancing level. There's something for everyone!",1165968000,8,667,4.7155172413793105
2325107,5,B0009VF3VQ,"Just like Line Dance 101, this DVD was very well received. My wife and I both loved it. It was a little faster paced than 101, but we felt prepared and could keep up. The dances are fun and presented very well. We like the way Shawn breaks down the dances and then has you learn with him. We liked Essential Line Dances Volume 2 for the same reasons.",1162684800,9,350,4.086956521739131
2325108,5,B0009VF3VQ,"I've been looking for a way, other than the treadmill, to get some exercise indoors and I remembered what fun and what great exercise line dancing was.  A long time ago I used to go to a country line dancing bar and I had so much fun there.  I searched the internet for a Learn to Line Dance DVD and decided to get this one because I knew if I liked it, there were more in the series.

I've gone through the DVD two times now and I feel like I can do the dances to ""real"" music already.  The dances are broken down in a way that make them very easy to learn.  You can also get a play list of suggested music on Shawn Trautman's website to practice the dances with.

I do have to admit, I feel a little ridiculous line dancing all by myself in the living room.  But who cares, right?  Now that I have the play list I'll just turn the music up loud enough so that I won't hear the neighbors laughing at me when they drive by and see me through the windows.",1151452800,19,954,3.9581151832460733

8067456,3,B0009VF3VQ,The dances are broken down in easy to follow steps but it almost gets boring.  The music stinks....and the instructor seems bored.,1392076800,,130,4.909090909090909
8067457,5,B0009VF3VQ,Easy to follow steps in this DVD.  Shawn is an excellent instructor for beginners.  My group loves the dance moves Shawn has on this video..,1382313600,,140,4.56
8067458,5,B0009VF3VQ,"Now, I've taken a few of line dancing classes in my day, and always missed a step or two because it always seems like instructors rush through the hard parts and dawdle through the easy parts of a dance, so I never learn anything and I keep my two left feet, never gaining a right.

I had no luck with youtube.com instructors for the same reason--bad pacing. I NEARLY gave up but then I gave this guy a try.

Amazing. Even a screw-up klutz like me can dance to this stuff. He went through all the moves relentlessly until I could memorize them enough that I was actually practicing by myself and doing it *right*. My only regret is that I didn't find him until this year. It's pricey, but it's worth it to have good instruction for once. I'll be buying more of his videos in the future, for sure!",1367539200,2,796,4.264900662251655
8067459,3,B0009VF3VQ,"I was very disappointed in this video because it was VERY advanced.  Because it was ""Essential"" and Volume 1, It was assumed that it would be basic.  However, it was WAY out of the ball park for me and my group.  I would recommend it to seasoned line dancers.  So, I ordered another video that stated BEGINNERS  in big letters.  Hopefully, we will get good enough to pick up Shawn's at a later date.",1364428800,,399,4.324324324324325

8067462,3,B0009VF3VQ,"who is this guy?  i mean, i understand production costs---but this totally wasn't worth the money. I received another volume in this series and haven't even opened it yet.  He's a good teacher and all---it just not very interactive.",1329955200,,232,4.923076923076923
