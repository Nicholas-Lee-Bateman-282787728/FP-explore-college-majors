8755269,2,B01D9T0CT2,"I haven't watched the original show to this but it has to be better than this rather dry remake of the original show which also had a similar story to Robocop but pre-dated Robocop by decades. This show doesn't pre-date Robocop and rips off Robocop in setting and tone.
In this version 8 man is a private detective when in the original he was a police detective, but similarly he is killed by ruthless criminals and turned into a cyborg. Certain references are thrown out about the original 8 man having been around previously and disappeared and his old love interest being still around for fanservice benefit I'm guessing. Mostly the anime OVA is really aping Robocop constantly.  The music theme to the OVA is ear splittingly awful, probably one of the worst anime themes I've ever heard. It being an rendition of the original theme to the show but sounds so awful and cheap. The characters are mostly bland and the bad guys aren't too creative or even interesting enough. The voice acting seems rather bland on both sides of the language aisle.

The weirdly strange parts of the show is rather how American at times it feels, from the animation to the fact that American Football is featured as a part of the show at one point. It almost feels like the show was meant for overseas distribution more than anything.  It's also one of the few anime I have seen with African American major supporting characters in it.  There's a certain mixture of Japanese and American cultures in the show that seem rather bizarre.  Whatever setting they want to convey at times feels like the Detroit of Robocop's world and less Japan.  But sadly it's all rather bland and uninteresting upside the rebooting of someone like Casshern/Casshan or Babel II which occurred at the same time.  The dubbed version is of course  the classic Streamline dub from the olden days of VHS anime, produced by Carl Macek. No doubt this anime will bring some nostalgia for some but for me it was rather boring and bland. Even the  action scenes and the violence is rather tame to me in this.",1536624000,,2060,4.652892561983471
