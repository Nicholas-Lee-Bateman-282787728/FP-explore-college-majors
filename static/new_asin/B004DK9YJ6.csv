4332639,5,B004DK9YJ6,"I ordered Ryan Hall's Back Attack and Deep Half Guard DVD's as a combo pack through Amazon, which I would encourage everyone to do if you intend on buying both eventually, which I would recommend.  While I've watched more than half of the deep half set, I won't review it here.  However,  I have completed the Back Attacks DVD.

The first DVD deals with principles of control when on the back, including grips, hand fighting, chair sit, hooks, etc.  Like his deep half DVD, he goes into a lot of detail about how to position your body, how to maintain the back, and mistakes to avoid.

The second DVD focuses primarily on submissions from the back, including the rear naked choke, arm bar, ezekiel, etc.  While someone with several years of experience will know the submissions immediately, the major benefit of this DVD is he goes into a lot of detail, building off of the first DVD, about how to maintain the position.  As he notes during the DVD, anyone can learn a submission but pulling it off, especially on experienced opponents, is quite difficult without proper control and mechanics.

The third DVD focuses primarily on the crotch and roll back attack, which if you saw his Superfight with Hermes Franca, is amazing to see pulled off.  Almost the entire DVD focuses on various ways to get there, mistakes to avoid, various positioning, and the like.

Ryan presents the material as if he is teaching you how to go against very skilled competition, not just going through the motions of various moves you can easily find on YouTube.  For what it's worth, my ability to maintain the back increased within days, I pulled off the crotch and roll several times now, and have had more success with rear naked chokes.  Admittedly, I still absolutely suck getting armbars from the back.

In addition, it's not boring to watch the DVD's.  The setting is great, camera moves fluidly through each presentation, Ryan is both entertaining and a great teacher.  Seph Smith is also fun to watch because he just sort of stares blankly at the screen.  I felt like I was waiting for him to smile or laugh at some point but he never does.

Overall, I would highly recommend this set.  I would also recommend you support people like Ryan and actually buy it.",1306281600,7,2247,4.67175572519084
4332640,5,B004DK9YJ6,"As soon as I saw the preview clips for this set on YouTube I knew that I had to get it...the 'Principles of Control' dvd is by itself worth the cost of this set.  If you've ever seen Ryan Hall fight you know that he is an expert at transitioning, and he covers this area of competition better than any other set I've seen (and I've seen quite a few).  There are dozens of little details that can be implemented immediately without extensive drilling, and the techniques that do require drilling will be VERY worth the effort.  As well, his dialogue is informative and entertaining--if you are the type of person who appreciates verbal/theoretical understanding of jiu-jitsu concepts, this set is for you.",1299283200,3,704,4.7073170731707314

Some of the techniques changes my game overnight and other people have commented about it.",1439164800,,232,4.658536585365853
8425477,5,B004DK9YJ6,"Hey guys, been doing Jiu Jitsu on and off for around 15 years. Needed something to get me inspired to learn again. I have used Marcello Garcia's disks, in fact have all of them. No body teaches / breaks the positions down like Ryan Hall. This is the first series I bought and I am going to buy the Deep 1/2 series when I am done with this. I am not a Ryan Hall affiliate, but am a big advocate of his DVD's. I have not found a person who really chains moves together with concepts like Ryan does. Shout out to Hall for having a positive impact on the Jiu-Jitsu world and putting together good material. I don't normally post stuff, but this is worthy material to have.",1415232000,2,668,4.186046511627907
8425478,5,B004DK9YJ6,"Awesome stuff,Ryan gives you more than a bunch of techniques he gives you a better understanding of positional control in theory so you can reevaluate your game and make the adjustments",1395187200,,185,5.0
8425479,5,B004DK9YJ6,"Because of this video set, I can now easily take the back from side control. My entire philosophy about side control has changed, now that I see how easily it is to allow your opponent to freely turn away.  Before, I used to always fight against the guy to hold him down.  Now I effortlessly just transition to back control.

In addition, I've added the rolling back to my game and I can pull it off even at the higher levels.  Ryan is a very intellectual grappler and he has the ability to explain the details of these complex moves in a way that allows you to understand what exactly is going on to make the move effective.

I highly recommend this DVD set.",1364342400,5,659,4.282258064516129
8425480,5,B004DK9YJ6,I recommend this DVD if your back attack is weak like mine. The principles of back control that Ryan explained have improved my back attacks.,1350345600,,141,4.68
8425481,5,B004DK9YJ6,"I seldomly write reviews anymore as it has become quiet difficult to impress me these days. Lots of info is already out there on the basics of BJJ or MMA. And a hundred different variations on an armlock of choke doesn't do for me anymore. This DVD set is definetly WORLDS APART from that. I could first of all totally relate to Ryan Hall's way of explaining things. He is like the smart kid who just came out of his university class on ""The Genius of BJJ"" so to speak. But that is exactly what I expect from a quality instructional. Instead of just showing you ""This cool move"" or ""that favourite competition technique"" he explains to you in great detail the important aspects of maintaining not only back control but control in general in BJJ grappling and how those mechanics are all linkedwith each other. Most of this stuff is applicable to gi as well as no gi. In fact his take on the control and pressure concepts is that thorough that it took my game off the charts almost after watching it and just putting a little bit of that into practice. A lot of tiny details that you never thought about or never noticed even after some years of rolling regularly. This DVD set has fixed many of them. The concepts explained by Ryan will help you with both putting pressure on your opponent as well as even setting up your own escapes. And that is just the first DVD in this set. I own several DVD instructionals, some of the classics and all time greats among those, but this one has after a long time impressed me enough to write a review on amazon. Highly recommend this one.",1342915200,2,1577,4.404109589041096
8425482,5,B004DK9YJ6,"Ryan Hall is an amazing instructor. Not only is his instruction technically the best (I have a lot of videos) but he has some of the best analogies. For example, ""If I live in a castle and you wanna kill me,storming the gates is probably not the best idea. You'ed do a lot better hitting me in the head with a brick when I come out to get the mail!"" I laughed so hard! Ryan breaks down back control and gives it to you straight. His techniques and teaching method shows you what you need to do to compete at a high level. Thanks Ryan!",1322611200,5,534,4.095238095238095
