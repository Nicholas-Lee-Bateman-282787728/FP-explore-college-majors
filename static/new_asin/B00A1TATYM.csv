8546093,3,B00A1TATYM,"Being a Melville and Belmondo fan, but having never seen this in its original release, I was curious. It turned out to be not the usual underworld action film that one expects from this director or its star. It is quite talky and the premise is an excuse for a buddy flik.

Briefly, a shady financier (Charles Vanel) flees France with a newly hired ex-boxer as bodyguard (Belmondo). They pick up a pile of loot in N.Y. and flee to the American south. Along the way, they pick up a hitch-hiker (a dubbed in English Stefania Sandrelli), who tries to make off with the loot. After they dump her, they end up in the New Orleans area. A father-son relationship develops. Belmondo eventually leaves taking the money, but decides to return with the it (thus explaining the ""honorable"" part of its American title). The film offers a rather bleak picture of the U.S. and with the slow pace, it just might try a few viewers' patience.

Michele Mercier, she of the Angelique 60's film series, makes a cameo appearance as a hooker who has an affair with Belmondo. The widescreen film (2:35:1 aspect ratio) is offered in a color saturated and sharp print. It is Letterboxed and not Anamorphic, for those of you who are interested. I would recommend it only to diehard fans of Belmondo and director Melville. I have to add that the Video Dimensions price is not bad for what it offers.",1400976000,9,1371,4.591836734693878
