2678399,3,B000JQSHUK,"For the price I paid for these, I expected a nice set of DVD's in nice durable cases. Most of the cases arrived broken. You can hear the little pieces of plastic rattling in the box.  The seasons are individually cased, therefore, I had no idea which were broken until I opened each case.

The Pilot movie is missing and I feel it is a very important part of the series. Be sure to order it separately.

I love Little House on the Prairie so I kept the set despite the cheap, broken cases and the cut off movies.",1325721600,21,512,4.151515151515151
2678400,5,B000JQSHUK,"""Little House on the Prairie"" premiered in 1974 as a movie (sometimes called the ""pilot movie"" or the ""premiere movie""). The series then ran for a total of 8 full seasons, from 1974 until 1982, and an extra season (the 9th) from 1982 until 1983 by the title ""Little House: A New Beginning."" It concluded with 3 TV movies during 1983-1984 (these are sometimes called ""season 10"" and have since been repackaged as part of the ""Little House: A New Beginning"" series). During the run of the series there were many extended eps that ran as 2-partners or double long programs and some shows that were 90 minutes in length. There was also a Thanksgiving retrospective special movie titled ""The Little House Years"" from 1979 (although this is not part of season 6, this 3-part program thas been broken up into 3 eps and in syndication it pops up in this season, although it is not included on the DVDs).

Michael Landon (may he rest in peace) was the star, executive producer, director and in some cases even writer of LHOTP. As Charles Ingalls he was also the voice of compassion and the voice of forgiveness and redemption. I can't think of another TV character that is more loved and more known for being a good man and a good father than Charles Ingalls and that's because of Michael Landon. Michael Landon gave life to a man that most of us never knew before. He gave him a heart. But most of all, Michael Landon's best work was done in the back of the house, not on camera. Because he wasn't some big-shot who needed to be seen and who needed to be some big star, he was just happy producing quality television. And that's really the cusp of LHOTP: quality. Because of Mr. Landon, the series resonates with just about everyone. I cannot think of another person who is or was ever able to accomplish such a behemoth task. He set a standard of excellence that no one has ever been able to match, before or since.

What I loved the most about Charles Ingalls was that he was just a regular man. He didn't have any super powers, he didn't fly through the air, he wasn't rich and he wasn't worldly. But you know what? That didn't matter because Michael Landon gave him such a warm spirit. Perhaps this was the first time on TV that it was OK for a man to cry because Charles Ingalls was very sensitive. For kids to see this was exceptional because it told them that it was OK to share their feelings and it was fine to be afraid. I am reminded of a statement from the series (Fight Team Fight!/Season 7), ""hurting someone doesn't make you a man, it's learning to love them.""

But that doesn't mean that Charles was a pushover in the slightest bit. He had a nice right-hook, especially concerning the well-being of his family. I love the time when Charles went up against those 2 men who made a lewd comment about Mary (""that's a mighty good looking blind girl you got"") and Charles beat them silly. Like Mr. Kenny Rogers said, ""sometimes you gotta fight when you're a man.""

BTW there is a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/special-edition-boxed-set/dp/B001EL6ECM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">special edition boxed set</a>&nbsp;that will be out in November. This includes the entire series, as well as bonuses and lots of extras.

Over the years the cast changed rapidly and readily, but that didn't matter to the viewers. Because even though Michael Landon wasn't on every ep, he could still be heard. His voice came though loud and clear. These are some of the main cast of characters on LHOTP during its entire run:
Michael Landon / Charles Ingalls (pilot movie, seasons 1-8, season 9 2 eps and in 2 of the final TV movies)
Alison Arngrim / Nellie Oleson (seasons 1-7, 1 ep during season 8 and in 1 of the final TV movies, playing a different role)
Karen Grassle / Caroline Ingalls (pilot movie, seasons 1-8 and in 1 of the final TV movies)
Victor French / Mr. Edwards (pilot movie, seasons 1-3, recurring briefly in some seasons afterward, season 9 and in some of the final TV movies)
Melissa Sue Anderson / Mary Ingalls (pilot movie, seasons 1-7 and season 8 2 eps)
Merlin Olsen / Jonathan Garvey (seasons 4-8 recurring)
Matthew Laborteaux / Albert Ingalls (in 1 ep during seasons 2 & 4, season 5 recurring, seasons 6-8, season 9 1 ep and in 1 of the TV movies)
Karl Swenson / Lars (seasons 1-4 recurring and in 1 ep during season 5)
Hersha Parady / Alice Garvey (seasons 4-6 recurring)
Ketty Lester / Hester-Sue Terhune (seasons 5-9 recurring and in some of the final TV movies)
Shannen Doherty / Jenny Wilder (season 9 and in some of the final TV movies)
Ruth Foster / Miss Melinda Foster (pilot movie-uncredited role, seasons 1-9 recurring)
Katherine MacGregor / Mrs. Harriet Oleson (seasons 1-9 recurring)
Richard Bull / Nelsen Oleson (seasons 1-9 recurring and in the final TV movies)
Jonathan Gilbert / Willie Oleson (seasons 1-9 recurring and in the final TV movies)
Kevin Hagen / Dr. Hiram Baker (seasons 1-9 recurring and in the final TV movies)
Dabbs Greer / Reverend Alden (seasons 1-9 recurring and in the final TV movies)
Lindsay & Sydney Greenbush / Caroline Ingalls (pilot movie and seasons 1-8)
Wendi and Brenda Turnbaugh / Grace Ingalls (seasons 4-8 recurring)
Melissa Gilbert / Laura Ingalls (pilot movie, seasons 1-9 and in the final 3 TV movies)

As someone who has grown up watching LHOTP I can tell you with all honesty and certainty that every single ep is excellent because each one has a value all its own. There is a lesson to each and every episode of LHOTP but it's never hokey or preachy and it's always different. However the one message that I always got out of the series was to have compassion. And, perhaps the second most learned lesson that I took from the series was to have trust because in the end we are all in essence good people.

These are some of my favorite eps:
If I Should Wake Before I Die (season 1)
With the help of Charles and Caroline, Miss Amy brings her entire family together to celebrate her life.

For The Love Of Blanche (season 9)

The show was based on the series of children's books by Laura Ingalls Wilder (later by Rose Wilder Lane). However, after the third season rather than relying as heavily on the books, the writers and the producers took more poetic license. IMO these are some of the best eps because they are all so creative and life-affirming, not to mention wholesome and articulate. If you want to see a quality series then I strongly recommend getting ""Little House on the Prairie: The Complete Television Series.""",1216771200,37,11832,4.656909788867562

2678407,1,B000JQSHUK,I now wish I had never purchased this set :(  My wife really really loves Little House and she once owned the exact same set but due to financial problems ended up selling the set to her sister. She was devastated so I decided to come on here and purchase the set for her for Christmas. I used mainly Gift Cards that I saved up and only came out of pocket for about 20 bucks but I still regret wasting even the gift cards. Seasons 1 - 8 were packaged so cheaply with the dvd holders inside the boxes that I now have to order a DVD case to put them all in. Seasons 2 and 3 there were 2-3 discs in both seasons that will not even play due to apparent scratches...took out of box and straight into player by putting finger through the center hole so as not to touch the dvd itself. (This is how I do all my dvd's and cd's) We are only on season 6 right now but we have opened all boxes and they are all packaged in the cheap plastic that is unable to hold the dvd's. Season 9 and special edition 10 are packaged in good quality packaging and holders. I was extremely disappointed and my wife was devastated especially since there are at least 4 dvd's within 2 seasons that won't even play at all. If you truly want the complete set then your best bet is to get it from somewhere else and not waste your money/giftcards on these.,1454803200,11,1325,4.096153846153846

It is our nightly tradition (as it was for many families when I was a child) to sit around after dinner and catch an episode or two before going to bed. I love their focus on the family unit. The stories may seem like a ""fairy tale"", but one must understand that these stories were told through the eyes of the child, LAURA INGALLS WILDER, who had a stable home life which helped her be emotionally stable inside and give her such an optimistic view of everyone in ""her world""... including NELLIE OLSEN, which is saying A LOT!
