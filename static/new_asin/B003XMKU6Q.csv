8451051,2,B003XMKU6Q,"Man, was this a disappointment, but as a longtime fan, there really isn't another way to check out this period on video.  The first part is simply the studio versions of tracks with live footage mixed in, and the rest is concerts that were poorly recorded.  Audio and video is 3rd rate.  As I said, for fans only - Uli plays so well, as usual, but this is not the kind of quality release I expected.",1299196800,2,399,4.223684210526316
