8670899,5,B0011U40FO,"I ordered this Ivan Lins DVD because I already had the CD and loved it. I am familiar with jam sessions, practice sessions, etc. and this seemed to be the final take session from which the CD evolved.  The DVD is just mesmorizing, as well as being very well filmed.  Each of what appears to be the regular musicians is covered extensively, as are the guest performers, during each song.  It really is like being in the studio with them.  They speak very little english, but that doesn't diminish the quality of the music or the performances.  You won't be sorry you ordered it!",1245715200,,577,4.509615384615385
