350862,4,6301762924,"This is another classic from Claymation.  Appropriate for those who enjoy good Claymation animation.  Very funny little skits of the California Raisins as they rise to fame and fortune, and even includes some funny ""commercials"".  This tape has great old '60's music to accompany the animation.  If you enjoy the Raisins doing Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer in the classic a Claymation Christmas, then you'll probably enjoy this tape.",1263772800,,434,5.246376811594203
350863,4,6301762924,"Just another reason why I'm keeping my dusty old VHS player. Funny how VHS and Blu-ray are my favorites now. I never thought I'd find this California Raisins classic from my childhood, but here it is, street-fighting broccoli and all! If you didn't see this as a kid you might think it's lame and I'm crazy, but you're the one missing out. Great music. In fact, I'm going to go watch this again.",1244332800,,395,4.424657534246576
350864,5,6301762924,"The songs and the ""history"" of the ""California Raisins"" are shown in this half-hour video....and it is very funny and entertaining. The California Raisins are claymation characters that it made it big with commercials on television.

This ""documentary"" is the ""story"" of the animated group - some fake history of these likable raisin characters. The ""history"" shows how the group was formed and played '60s and '70s R&B songs, then becoming famous, as mentioned with a few television commercials in the 1980s.

What's great about this are two things: the music and the humor. It takes a number of viewings to catch most of the funny visuals and hear all the puns in this short tape. It's presented more as a regular TV program would be, with commercials interrupting it, news bulletins, promotions, etc. It's very clever material.

I remember all these old rock 'n roll classics, and they sound even better with these ""guys"" doing it!  It's been 20 years since this first came out on VHS - where is the DVD?",1237507200,,1007,4.803468208092486
350865,5,6301762924,"I'd usually give it a 4 star rating...but due to it's ""underdog"" status it won't hurt to bolster it a little.  Besides, the 1-star reduction was only considering that not everyone who watches this will have the same nostalgia as me and the other reviewers seem to keep with us.

BUT all that out of the way, the animation quality really is superb, Vinton Studios is best with it's medium...and speaking of Vinton Studios...here's a little surprise for those wishing to buy this movie new:

350866,5,6301762924,"My sister and I grew up watching this show, but we haven't been able to find the movie anywhere. This is the last place I can possibly think of to get the movie, but for some reason its not in stock. This is a great movie and if they made it available to the customers they could make a lot of money.",1036195200,,300,3.8548387096774195
350867,5,6301762924,This was the funniest movie. The music wasn't bad either. If anyone know where this movie can be gotten please let us know.,957484800,2,123,4.391304347826087
350868,5,6301762924,"This movie was the greatest! I watched it over at my friend's house, we were expecting it to be dumb, but after about five minutes we could NOT stop laughing! The characters are soooooooooooo hilarious! This is a must  see movie!",957139200,3,229,4.585365853658536

350870,5,6301762924,"This is one of the best claymation videos--ahead of technology, it was created way before its time. Please get some!",954979200,5,116,4.85
7814614,5,6301762924,"I was so excited to find this in Amazon! This is a childhood classic which I am thrilled to share with my family. It's exactly as I remember, probably because it's on VHS. LOL",1462838400,,175,4.176470588235294
7814615,5,6301762924,Product was as described and I am very happy with it.  We had this growing up and watched it all the time but it went missing so I was very happy to find it so I can share it with my kids.,1366243200,,188,3.4761904761904763
7814616,5,6301762924,It was fun to watch this movie again. it did have some where and tear but the vhs itself worked really good.,1362700800,,108,3.9545454545454546
7814617,3,6301762924,"First off, this didn't come with a doll as it's title says. That aside, it was useless, it can't be viewed. The video looks worst than those old 1960s educational videos - static, lines, skipping, totally unwatchable and useless. Too cheap to bother returning it so they got their money and I got screwed.

I had this same video years ago when it first came out and, as for the storyline, music, etc., it's great, but this particular company's copies are unviewable therefore useless and, while I would recommend this video, I wouldn't recommend buying from them.",1329264000,,563,4.804123711340206
7814618,5,6301762924,"This movie has been missing  from our collection for about 15 years, so because it was so funny for all ages I ordered it and have shared it with many. So-o-o enjoyable with the old 80s hits sung by these funny ""guys"" in their escapades of making it famous. Remember ""I heard it thru the grapevine?""...",1310947200,,302,4.392857142857143
7814619,4,6301762924,"the vhs tape was in excellent condition, good quality for an older tape. This movie is very funny, you have to watch it many times to catch all of the puns in it. The claymation is amazing when you know what they have to do to capture this.",1293926400,,240,4.020833333333333
7814620,5,6301762924,"This video alone makes me want to get the VHS player out of storage.  Oy, where is the DVD?!??!?  I watched this tape over and over and over in the late 80s/early 90s, and it made me laugh every time... last time I watched it a couple years ago, same thing all over again.  Other reviews have commented on the claymation & how awesome it is, and yes, it is!  But the thing that grabbed me is how fantastic their musicians are!  Talk about some super talent!  It may be wrong, but I prefer listening to THESE songs over most of the originals.  Loved the commercials, the production, the characters, all of it.  I really wish it were on DVD... sigh.",1287878400,,647,4.289256198347108
7814621,5,6301762924,The movie was in excellent condition and it was here three days sooner than I expected.,1286064000,,87,4.5
7814622,4,6301762924,"My son watched this with his class in Kindergarten several times and loved the music, so I decided to get it for home (so I could watch it too).  I could not find it on DVD and I even tried to just purchase the soundtrack with no luck, so I had to settle for the VHS Tape.  Great music and animation that reminded me of the old Davy and Goliath shows.",1281571200,,351,3.9295774647887325
