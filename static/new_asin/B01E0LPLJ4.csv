While the title is 4k, it does not feature HDR but there is really no need for it. The colors and contacted scenes just pop on the screen and the 4k brings so many details. The music and sound are well rendered in this 5.0 audio release. The performance matches the technical quality of the disc. This is a long opera but the plot and the staging will make you forget you've just spent 3 and a half hours watching an opera. I highly recommend this 4k blurays.",1502496000,,560,4.242990654205608

8757516,4,B01E0LPLJ4,"Sven-Eric Bechtolf's stagings of the Mozart/da Ponte operas in Salzburg concluded in 2015 with Le nozze di Figaro. I think it's the most successful of the three. Bechtolf's strengths lie in detailed direction of the action rather than bold conceptual statements and Nozze is probably the least in need of, and the least amenable to, the big Konzept. There aren't any real dramaturgical problems to solve. It just works as written. I don't think that's so true for Don Giovanni or Cos.

What we get is a pretty straightforward staging set in an English country house in the 1920s. Mostly this works pretty well as a setting but I do wish designers and directors would get the details right when they choose such settings. Obviously an English aristocrat of this periodcouldn't have""owned"" a regiment that he can pack a troublesome youth off to but if he did it would probably be a British one, so why put Cherubino in a cod French uniform? You can actually pretty much play continuity card bingo with this production. That's essentially nit picking though and there is plenty to like between the face palms.

For the first three acts the production uses a multi room set on two levels. Only in Act IV does the whole stage get used as a whole; as a sort of greenhouse as it happens. This device of course allows for acting by characters who otherwise wouldn't be on stage; like Sussana locked in the closet or the Count and Antonio crawling through the cellars looking for Cherubino. There are also some typically Bechtolf embellishments. Cherubino has a portfolio of drawings of the ladies of the house in various states of undress. The Count and Countess fool around dangerously with a shotgun(*). The disguises in Act IV are actually quite convincing. The one bit I didn't ""get"" is the characterization of Barbarina who is weirdly tomboyish.

The casting is very apt. Everyone looks, feels and sounds right. The Figaro, Adam Platchetka, maybe looks slightly older than one expects nowadays but he's a very fine singer and actor and, ultimately is very convincing. His Susanna is Martina Jankov who sings well and creates a persona that hovers between deferential and familiar in an interesting way. Luca Pisaroni and Annett Frtisch play the Almavivas. Again they feel right as the characters. In particular, Fritsch conveys an air of quiet, aristocratic, suppressed desperation somewhat reminiscent of Schwarzkopf. Her Dove sono is heartbreaking and we see itagainright at the end. There is no sense of triumph in her snaring of her husband. She doesn't smile even as she takes centre stage during the final ensemble. In fact, as the other characters start the wedding party she walks slowly and sadly away. Only when her husband comes after her and escorts her to the festivities does some small sign that she believes in the possibility of happiness emerge. This, I think, is the kind of thing Bechtolf does best.

The other roles are all fine. Margarita Gritskova is rather a likeable and quite masculine Cherubino. Ann Murray, 65 when this was recorded, is a very characterful Marcellina (though her aria is cut) and is well matched by Carlos Chausson's quite refined Bartolo. Christina Gansch sings well as Barbarina and I guess she's doing what she's supposed to even if it feels a bit odd. Tristan Pisaroni makes a brief cameo in Act 1 probably becoming the first dog to be credited in a Nozze production. Dan Ettinger conducts from the forte pianowith the Wiener Philharmoniker. Sometimes his tempi seemed a bit slow to me; in Voi che sapete and in the finale for instance but the recording comes in at a standard 190 minutes which is 10 minutes faster than the Harnoncourt/Guth version and, anyway, the slow tempo at the end is quite beautiful.

Tiziano Mancini does a very decent job with the video direction which is always tricky with a multi-room set. The technical quality on Blu-ray is first class. The surround sound is very good and the picture holds up even in the rather dark final act. There's an interesting extra on the disk. Besides surtitles one can select explanatory pop ups which appear at appropriate times to clarify a plot or production point. This feature is available in English, German and Chinese. I found I didn't use it much but it might be handy for someone less familiar with the piece. The booklet contains a track listing and an essay by Katrin Haase which doesn't cast much light on the production, and maybe there isn't much to be cast. Subtitle options are English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Chinese and Korean.

There's a lot to like in this performance and it's well captured on disk. I think it joins Guth's classic Salzburg production as one I could see myself revisiting.

Did I find any common threads running through Bechtolf's versions of the three operas? Not really, though there is a common attention to detailed characterization and a liking for carefully composed stage pictures. There's certainly less to unite the three works than in Guth's cycle.

(*)To anyone brought up in rural England the cavalier way that firearms are handled will appear as shocking as if the count and countess had decided to fight a duel with crucifixes",1490054400,3,5196,4.863276836158192

8757518,4,B01E0LPLJ4,"Blu-ray - My copy of this disc is 'All regions'

The first thing to notice about this performance of the opera concerns the pacing, articulation and sound of the overture. At once it becomes apparent that this is taken at a pace that allows for very crisp and precise orchestral articulation. This is achieved by adopting tempi which are slow enough to deliver this but fast enough to keep things sufficiently on the move. The sound is excellently projected with good spacial spread. The time and place of the recording was July 2015 at the Mozart House, Salzburg.

This approach is sustained throughout and is perfectly consistent with the casting of Susanna and Figaro who are clearly older, or more mature, than those normally cast in these roles. The setting has been brought forward to the early 20th century and the venue is shown to be a mansion with an array of rooms open to view as in a dolls house with the front opened. As the action progresses so the staging changes to reveal differing rooms as appropriate to the unfolding plot. The dialogue has also been adjusted to suit the situation so there are no obvious anomalies of script which might jar.

This set of production decisions enables the viewer to be either distracted or involved by actions occurring at the same time as the main focus at any one time. Generally they are not a distraction but unify the whole plot in an unusually interesting manner. In summary, this device of a dolls house opening to real changing scenarios seems to work very well as a concept and makes for a convincingly viable alternative setting to traditional productions.

There is one major proviso with this staging which is totally avoidable however. Surely there is an unbelievable lack of proprietary with Figaros and Cherubinos access to the Countesss bedroom in Act 2 especially as the Countess is in night attire? She is even still in bed while Figaro in in her room and later she is seen getting dressed in Cherubinos presence. There is simply too much sexual innuendo here and this far exceeds the likely bounds of the Countesss safety.

Returning to casting decisions, all but one of the main and subsidiary characters are of believable age or maturity given the values of this production. The one exception must be that of Cherubino who is clearly too old to be the innocent child that he is purported to be. However, the actual delivery of the role is excellently done and is youthful enough to be acceptable despite outward appearances. That leads this review to an assessment of the musical and acting capabilities of the cast either individually or as a complete unit.

This is a very strong cast both in terms of musical and dramatic delivery. Long gone are the days of stand and deliver singing and here we witness a persuasive level of acting as well as high quality singing. There is not a single weakness in these regards and it would be invidious in the circumstances to single out individual members of the cast for special praise beyond their colleagues. Nevertheless, it must be conceded that Martina Jankova delivers a sprightly and youthful Susanna with a vocal timbre to match which is vital to the plot in terms of making her attractive to the Count. Additionally, as Anett Fritsch offers such an attractive Countess one must question the Counts judgement in this matter. Her singing is also second to none!

As mentioned in the opening paragraph, the recording offers excellent sound. The camera work is of a high calibre as is the imaging despite a few isolated incidents of movement judder. This should not be sufficient to call into question a warm welcome to this thoughtful modern re-thinking of the time and place of the plot.

In conclusion this is an enjoyable modern production that deserved its warm critical reception from the press at the time of performing. It is strong enough to withstand repeated viewing as a recorded experience and offers a viable alternative to traditional productions. That would be particularly true when considered as an extra version to add to the superb Glyndebourne McVicar presentation from 2009 for example.",1476144000,9,4129,4.838526912181303
