3053751,4,B0010X8NMS,"I always find this season to be the most funniest season of the series. why you may ask, because Krillin gets a girlfriend and then brakes up with her over a lesson learned from a pearl and schools of fish. does anyone remember Garlic Jr? if you do he's back from the dead zone and Gohon, Krillin, and Piccolo have to stop him from turning all the people of the world into mind less fighting machines. this season we are also introduced to Trunks a young man from  the future, who has come back to save the world from being destroyed by two killer androids. how, step one: tell Goku the day and time that these androids arrive. step two: give Goku meds from the future that will save his life from a heart virus. and step three: tell Goku that you are the son of Vigeta and Bulma, then watch reaction. yes I know step three has nothing to do with saving the world it's just funny. ow and one of the more funnier parts of this season is that Chichi makes Goku get a drivers license and Goku drags Piccolo along to get one too.",1511568000,,1025,4.2030456852791875

3053807,5,B0010X8NMS,"Loved it . Action packed and exciting. So great catch up on all the episodes i missed. You can put the dvd on marathon mode and let it roll and sit back and see episode after episode without any interruptions . You miss all the beginning songs and credits , they only show them once in opening  and once at end . Amazon let me catch up on so many episodes i have missed and i plan on buy all the dbz dvd's i can . ( Regular episodes through dbz kia, gt , resurrection , and god saga  -I haven't  seen any of those -only seasons 3 and 4 and varied stuff on tv .) Amazon is giving me the opportunity to see them at very good prices . Hurray !  And the sets are all like 17-18 bucks , how can u beat that , whats that like 3 bucks a dvd , how can u beat that !",1477094400,,757,3.6832298136645965

3053826,4,B0010X8NMS,"Don't get me wrong, this season is fantastic. From the time Frieza enters the earths atmosphere to the time trunks finds Cells time capsule, this is a 5 star season. However, the first 7-9 episodes are literally 100% filler. The garlic jr saga should not be considered canon. Especially since the movie ""dead zone"" isn't canon. It's stupid, and it makes the Z fighters look super weak. Including gohan. Skip past all over that junk please",1466467200,,438,4.776315789473684

3053844,5,B0010X8NMS,Awesome season. There are problems such as weird cropping and on some of the funimation remastered box sets have multiple voices for characters which does kinda get under your skin but for the price and if you want this amazing series this is a very affordable option.,1462924800,,268,4.723404255319149
3053845,3,B0010X8NMS,"Love this season and it came in perfect condition. My problem with it is that it was voiced over again, for whatever reason. It probably doesnt bother most but i just couldn't help but notice how many of the voices of the characters were slightly different and the lip movements were more off than normal. At first it didn't really bother me too much but the more i watch i notice that they changed a lot of words that i know for a FACT were different, and were much more realistic in the original. They also put less episodes on each disk so the season doesnt actually go all the way through, leaving you with a cliffhanger ending forcing you to buy the next season. It almost seems like a rip off at this point.",1461801600,,713,4.288888888888889

The only negative thing I have to say is that it, and the others,  didn't come with the episode guide. I know this may seem like a minor detail, but I use to as an easy way to satisfy exactly what episodes I need to watch if I want to see a certain parts of the series.",1461628800,,439,3.932584269662921

I highly recommend you watch the DBZ movie ""Dead Zone"" before starting to watch this season, as events in that movie lead into the events dealing with Garlic Jr.  As with the other sets I've bought, this one didn't come with a booklet, but for the price, I have no complaints.",1452556800,,341,4.396825396825397

3053879,5,B0010X8NMS,"My favorite saga in the entire series. Nothing beats the trunks/android/cell saga!
The reason I love this season is because it had a different atmosphere than the other seasons. It was slightly more dark and suspenseful...and the plot was pretty interesting. I've watched all seasons of DBZ but this one stands out to me the most and I can always go back and watch it over and over; It never gets old.",1438560000,,401,4.583333333333333

3053901,4,B0010X8NMS,"This season is broken into two parts.  1st is the Garlic Jr. Saga and the 2nd is the Android Saga.  These sagas are completely unrelated and have no decent transition.  The Garlic Jr. Saga was terrible with the main antagonist having recovered from a fate worse than death that resulted from when he opened a portal in a previous saga.  The story line was predictable and without much growth.  This season leaves the Android saga incomplete ending on cliff hangers, which means I have to buy season 5 to know what happens next.  Since the series has redundant flashbacks and I really just wanted the Android saga, I should have just bought season 5.",1431388800,,649,4.649122807017544

However with the Blu-rays being cropped too and the Dragon Box sets being expensive as hell, this is your best bet having DBZ in English on DVD. I can point out a handful of times in each episode where the heads are cut off from the cropping but the picture is remastered in comparison to the old VHS releases. This set is perfect except for the cropping. Get past that and you got DBZ!",1389916800,,551,4.158878504672897

Let this be learned to NEVER buy from them.",1388361600,,359,4.454545454545454

3054140,5,B0010X8NMS,As usual another great DBZ collection... I really enjoyed watching some of my favorite episodes again... Would highly recommend it.,1354147200,,131,5.6
3054151,3,B0010X8NMS,"The item was great but the way it was sent and the way I got wasn't great. I like to have my dvds/blurays and the cases they come in perfect or mint condition, but it wasn't!! I know it is a small issue but the tabs that holds the discs in the case were broken on two of them and this is a six discs set. So when I hold up the case, the two dvds gets bounced around and sometimes falls out of the case. This was my first time buying a season dvd/bluray on-line, and probably my last. I would rather search and buy it from a store than have this happen to me again. Don't get me wrong... I love Amazon but when it comes to buying items with multiple discs on-line, I'm going to pass.",1353110400,,682,3.9136690647482015
3054152,5,B0010X8NMS,"This is my lesat favorite DBZ box set. It covers the boring Garlic Jr. saga, the Trunks saga and the Android saga. Although this is my least favorite DBZ, it's still great. Everyone likes the Trunks and Android sagas. I'm personally not a fan of the Garlic Jr. saga and the filler episodes that follow. It's still great though. My favorite feature of this box set is the marathon feature option. This allows you to watch all the episodes on each disc w/o any previews or opening/closing songs. It makes everything flow so much smoother. The video and audio quality is also very good in this collection. It is presented in 5.1 dolby digital. The dialogue has also been revised. It's a great addition to any DBZ fans collection.",1351123200,,726,4.635658914728682

3054154,5,B0010X8NMS,"I love DragonBall Z since I was little. To have this collection in my procession is amazing to me because for a long time I couldn't find the shows for DBZ. Now that technology has changed since the 90s, a lot of remakes are being made. This version is from the original Japanese intro and outros. I grew up on the 90s version of the intro and outros(definitely not the same and the 90s version was in English) so for this one I was a bit surprised but the picture is clear as it can be. Also, it is NOT like the Toonami version that the US was given. It is the original Japanese version of the show. The shows are in English, clear, precise, no commercials, just a small 10 second cut away, in each episode. I can sit an watched these all day because as you know back on TV the commercials was so annoying so to have no commercials and you transition well between shows, it is a TREAT. Go get your popcorn, and relax cause you will be officially apart of the show.
Its a WONDERFUL collection. I just love it. If you are a DBZ fan, you must get it!!!!!",1332633600,,1052,4.136585365853659

3054175,5,B0010X8NMS,"This season of Drangon Ball Z is great. Not only do they step up the action, but the story itself is also getting better. With cliff hangars that will leave you wanting to buy season 5 and beyond this is a must have. Unlike the previous seasons this one moves a lot faster. You don't spend hours watching all of the talking scenes mixed in with a little action, but instead have a healthy balance in season 4. This is a must have for any Dragon Ball Z fan!",1279670400,,456,4.134831460674158
3054176,5,B0010X8NMS,"Dragon Ball Z Season 4, most of this set is really more of the same. Presented in wide-screen format, the screen crops off some of the top and bottom picture, while revealing more of the sides. It fits perfectly on a widescreen television, and even looks decent on a standard television. The film transfer itself is very good. The original framerate has been restored so the animation looks a lot more fluid. The difference is definitely noticeable. The colors have been restored and while the grain has been cut back considerably, it still isn't perfect.

The biggest flaws in all these sets are the vulnerability of the packaging. It isn't too uncommon for discs to get scratched or for the box to come apart and the damages done are sometime irrevocable. When releasing a series as popular as this, Funimation really should've been smarter with the packaging. As usual there are no extras to speak of, some textless songs and trailers.

Storywise season 4 is a transitional stage. It starts with the filler saga about the return of Garlic Jr. an immortal villain from the first DBZ movie. It's actually a pretty good saga that has some nice fight scenes and overall does a good job at filling in the space until the next major event. It's the first step in showing how Gohan inevitably has to step up to take his father's place as leader of the Z-Fighters.

After that is about two episodes that encompass the `Trunks Saga'. Rather short for a self-titled story arc no? Anyways Freiza survived his fight with Goku and comes to Earth rebuilt as a cyborg along with his father King Kold. The Z-Fighters panic to assemble a team to resist the icy tyrant but they are beaten to the punch by a mysterious teenage Super Saiyan. I can't say I like the way Frieza and his father are beaten so easily by this young new character. They should've put up a better fight, but alas. The new character dispatches the alien invaders and invites the other Z-fighters to accompany him to meet Goku upon his landing planet side.

After the main character finally returns, Goku and the new Super Saiyan have a one-on-one conversation. We learn that the young boy is a fighter from the future named Trunks, the son of Bulma and Vegeta. He travels to the past because in his time the world is destroyed by the Androids, artificial beings created by the maniacal Dr. Gero. With this startling revelation Trunks gives Goku some medicine to make sure he doesn't die of a radical new heart virus that will strike him before the Androids arrive, so that Goku can help in the battle. The Z-fighters each begin their own special training to prepare for the appearance of the androids.

Three filler episodes are all that separates the Trunks Saga from the beginning of the Android Saga. Three years pass and the Z-Fighters assemble to battle the androids. Goku's heart virus takes him out of the action early, and Vegeta arrives just in time to save him. Revealing that he has finally become a Super Saiyan as well, Vegeta makes short work of the first android. After a lengthy and `suspenseful' chase scene, the second android is cornered and defeated rather soundly by Piccolo. However Trunks arrives and announces that the androids they are fighting aren't the same as the androids from his time. Bulma adds to the revelations by announcing the android who escaped Piccolo is actually Dr. Gero. Another race sequence begins as the Z-Fighters search out Gero's lab, while the evil doctor himself does the same.

Inevitably Gero activates his other two androids, but 17 and 18 quickly turn against and kill the doctor. They proceed to activate another android that even Trunks did not know about, 16. Vegeta proceeds to challenge the androids himself and has a spectacular fight with 18 but in the end the Saiyan Prince falls, along with all the other Z-Fighters. Only Krillin stays out of the fight, but surprisingly the Androids don't kill any of them. Instead they continue with their primary mission of assassinating Goku, who's still recovering from his heart virus.

Before the Z-Fighters can figure out what to do about androids 17 and 18, another menace arises. That struggle will begin in the next season.",1272931200,,4189,4.761707988980716

3054178,5,B0010X8NMS,"If you're a DBZ fan, you'll want this in your collection. It was so painful to wait for these episode to come on TV & restart countless times. I'm so glad I can watch these back-to-back when I get a DBZ itch now =).",1266019200,,215,3.909090909090909
3054179,5,B0010X8NMS,"Dragonball Z is famous across the globe, most noted for being one of the all time most popular anime series ever created.  The show does an excellent job of staying true to the mangas, with few name changes and plot adjustments.  This collection happens to be my personal favorite collection of all of the available ones to choose from.  Why?  It's because of the interesting sagas that it contains.

The Garlic Jr Saga is a great series of episodes that is highly overlooked.  Garlic has returned from his ""Dead Zone"" imprisonment.  He now seeks revenge on the earthlings, and will stop at nothing to continue his attack on Piccolo and Kami for the death of his father.  Armed with new henchmen and still gifted with immortality, it seems as if Garlic Jr is unstoppable.  The fight between Gohan, Krillin, Piccolo and Garlic Jr is one of the most action packed ones ever placed within the anime.  The plot is great, and the show does a great job of keeping the viewer enticed and engaged through the many surprising twists hidden within this saga.

The second Saga that this collection contains is one of the most popular sagas of the show, the Trunks Saga.  The Trunks Saga marks the arrival of Trunks and the announcement of the impending doom of the entire planet.  The addition of this saga marked a new chapter in the Dragonball Z universe.  It was once viewed ""impossible"" to become a Super Saiyan, but as this saga proves, Super Saiyan is no longer a feet unachievable by Saiyans.  With the introduction of this saga, power levels increase and enemies once viewed as formidable are no longer so.  Once viewed as the strongest being in the universe, Frieza arrives on Earth seeking revenge for his near-death experience that was handed to him on Namek by Goku.  Frieza knows that Goku is going to arrive late, so he intends to have some fun with the planet's inhabitants before Goku arrives.  Little did he know that another Super Saiyan exists.  Trunks quickly dispatches the villain and his father in a matter of seconds.  He then goes on to reveal the future that will come to pass, a future where everyone on Earth has been killed by a pair of diabolical androids/cyborgs.

This is a nice little DVD collection.  It comes in a nicely sized box with a folding DVD case.  The collection pack comes with six DVDs containing remastered footage from the anime.  The quality of the images has been touched up, but it also contains image cropping.  The sound is better, a much sharper, cleaner quality, but the volume level could use some work, seeing as the actual episodes are more quiet than the rest of the DVD contents.  This collection is simply amazing in every way conceivable.  A perfect season to purchase if you're a DBZ fan.",1264377600,,2740,4.665970772442589
3054180,5,B0010X8NMS,"Season four of the dragon ball z series countinues with action. I am not a huge fan of the garlic jr. saga, or even the dead zone movie, but once you get past garlic jr. it is filled with mystery, suspense and gives you the anticipation to buy season five, not my favorite seasons, but is a part of a masterpeice, dragon ball z as a whole was the best action show while i was growing up, the music and dub were the same as when i was watching when i was growing up and watching trunks conquer what i thought goku had takes me back to the days.",1264032000,,543,3.9908256880733943
3054191,3,B0010X8NMS,"The Dragon Ball Z Season Four DVD box set includes six DVDs that contain thirty-two episodes.  The first three discs contain six episodes, discs four and five contain five episodes, and the sixth disc contains four episodes and the DVD extras.

One of my favorite things about this DVD set is the marathon feature.  This feature allows you to watch all of the episodes back-to-back, but you only see the opening credits once; the ending credits are not shown when watching with the marathon feature.  This feature really helps when you're trying to watch all the episodes on a single disc in one sitting.  Luckily, none of the story arcs on this set were dragged out for a ridiculous amount of time.

Unfortunately, there isn't much in the way of special features.  All you get are the textless versions of the opening and ending credits (this feature was already included on the first three DVD box sets), and trailers.  Unfortunately, these features aren't very ""special.""

Another problem with this set is the audio mastering levels.  FUNimation's opening splash screen and the trailer at the beginning of each DVD were mastered at a high audio level, but the menu and the actual episodes were mastered with a rather soft audio level.  It's frustrating to have to sharply turn the volume down when you put the DVD into the player, and then having to turn the volume back up considerably in order to hear the audio for the episodes.

While I was disappointed with the audio levels and the lack of special features, this set is still a ""must get"" for any Dragon Ball Z fan that wants all the episodes on DVD.",1260230400,,1609,4.686832740213523
3054192,5,B0010X8NMS,"I've watched the entire DBZ series various times through. I've been a fan since I was a kid and will, probably, always be. This season sets up the framework for the Cell series to come. Although it's not one of the most exciting seasons, it still holds its own. Patience is needed throughout this season because no major fights happen, but many interesting things begin to develop. Overall, I would obviously recommend it to any anime fan.",1252108800,,439,4.714285714285714
3054193,5,B0010X8NMS,"I've been a diehard ""DragonBall Z"", ""DragonBall GT"", and ""DragonBall"" fan ever since I was six years old and I love this DVD boxset! All of the storylines/sagas are way too long to explain everything that happened in them, but, basically, while all of the good guys think that Frieza is gone for good, a whole bunch of other villains show up and try to rule the world/universe, such as Garlic Jr., who appeared in the ""DBZ"" movie: The Dead Zone,and his new henchmen, the Spice Boys, Salt, Mustard, and the rest, first appear, then later on, Frieza and his father, King Cold, then, even later, Dr. Gero/Android 20, Android 19, and Androids 16, 17, and 18. Almost all of those villains are some of my favorite villains from the show. Also, Trunks, Vegeta and Bulma's son, shows up in his saga, so there's a new good guy, too. You get all of the episodes in Season Four(The Garlic Jr., Trunks, and Android Sagas combined), such as the one where Garlic Jr. gets and then poisons almost all of the good guys with the Black Water Mist, the one where Trunks appears and kills Frieza and King Cold, ""Goku's Ordeal"", a hilarious episode, where, before the Androids appear, Chi-Chi, Goku's wife, forces him and Piccolo to get driving lessons; Piccolo drives well, but Goku can't drive at all and almost kills his driving instructor by driving way too fast and almost crashing into other cars! There's also another funny episode where Krillin tries to date Marron, and there's the Android Saga as well. The only things that I miss in this boxset are that there's no scene selection feature and that the American music that Bruce Faulconer made isn't there, but the show is still amazing! I love this boxset and I can't wait to get it and the rest of the ""DragonBall Z"", ""DragonBall GT"", and ""DragonBall"" boxsets that I don't have yet!",1247529600,,1823,4.62962962962963
3054194,5,B0010X8NMS,"Let me start off by saying this...If you are worried about buying this set because of the well known ""cropping-issue"" don't be. It's not nearly as bad as most people make it out to be. I finished watching it and there was not one instance where I could point out that it had in fact been cropped from the original episodes. I had to go online and find the comparisons to even notice. So yes there is cropping but in my opinion it in no way took away from the amazing experience of watching DBZ.

These episodes remastered are almost perfect.  The only problem I have with them (and with all the sets thereafter) is the fact that the voice acting in the remastered version has been changed.  In season 1 and 2 this was the best feature being as when these episodes originally aired it was with a different set of voice actors then Freiza saga on.  Having the audio done over was amazing.  There are instances, however in Season 3 onward where they have redone the voice acting in certain parts and it doesn't feel quite the same.  For example there are several instances where Gohan and Vegetas voice doesn't sound right.  Kinda like the voice actor couldn't get the voice to sound like it had years ago when these episodes were first dubbed.  All in all it doesn't change much of the experience.  Just kinda a nuisance for hardcore fans.

All in all if you are a DBZ fanatic do not hesitate to buy!!",1244073600,,1399,4.408560311284047

Fortunately, I stopped getting the rip-off dvds (aka the ones they released at 15bucks a piece for THREE EPISODES...which at the time were still edited despite the claim to be otherwise). Anyways...on to the point...DBZ is and ALWAYS will be my favorite anime (or one of at least)...[not to say I dislike DB OR DBGT, but due to lionsgate's annoying and asinine behavior, I STILL have not seen Dragon Ball aside from some old VHS tapes I still have). So,  simply put: if you love or just like DBZ enough to want or are merely curious about weather or not this would be a wise purchase...IT IS! Trust me, the ONLY THING bad is the damn subtitles not being true to the actual translations...which is more of a occasional thing (in other words...it basically censors the ""profane language"" by ""interpreting the words differently"")",1228608000,,996,4.790697674418604

3054216,5,B0010X8NMS,"With each DVD season box set release of ""DRAGON BALL Z"", as a hardcore fan of the series, it's just incredible to get over 30 episodes for almost the same price or less than most American television box sets.

Season 4 is definitely going to excite some fans as one of the more popular characters, Future Trunks is featured on the box cover.

The season starts off with the Garlic Jr. arc that I wasn't too caring for, while the fate of Goku is still unknown after the battle with Frieza, everyone else gets accustomed to their own lives as Gohan is stuck at home studying for school exams and his mother Chi Chi is very striict with him. Piccolo continues to train and Krillyn dates a beautiful, busty woman named Maron.

But eventually everyone reunites to take on the latest threat to their world when Garlic Jr. unleashes the black water mist upon the world and everyone turns evil with the exception of Piccolo, Krillyn, Gohan, Maron and Master Roshi.  With the help of Kame and Mr. Popo, the group take on Garlic Jr. and must save the world from the black water myst.

The next chapter features the return of Frieza and his father Cooler.  After Goku's battle with Frieza, it is learned that Frieza's father saved his son and made him even more powerful by taking his body parts and creating a cyborg.  Of course, Frieza now back, wants revenge on Goku and friends.

As everyone prepares to battle against Frieza and Cooler, a mysterious guy from the future makes an appearance.

The unknown warrior defeats Frieza and Cooler with ease and everyone realizes that he is a Saiyajin.  But the warrior tells everyone that Goku should be arriving that day and everyone is shocked to find out that Goku will be coming back.

Upon Goku's return, the future warrior reveals to Goku that he is Trunks, the son of Vegita and Bulma and warns him of upcoming danger as his world has been destroyed by the Androids.  He comes to the past to warn Goku to get him and his friends prepared for their battle because he can defeat the androids but he must take medication to help eliminate a virus that he is going to have soon.  According to Trunks, everyone except Gohan is killed but Goku dies due to a virus.  But by giving him an antidote, Goku can survive the virus once he gets sick.

So, for the next few years, Goku, Picollo and everyone must train for this major threat from dr. Jiro and the androids.

AUDIO:

This is where I'm so happy with these Funimation releases.  The fact that you can watch the series in both Japanese or English dubs but can listen to the English dub with the new digital music or the original Japanese music.

Having watched the series in its original Japanese language when it was first released, this time around, I have been watching the series in dub format and its one of the best English voice acting as Goku, Picollo, Gohan, Krillyn, every character...the voice acting is just well done.  There is not one character where I felt the voice acting was off or didn't fit.  Voice acting is well done!

VIDEO:

The video looks great on DVD and for those of us who have multi-generation fansubs or fading VHS tapes, just having these episodes on DVD and everything looking great.  I know some people have a problem with the show receiving some cropping but for me it's quite miniscule.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

Special features include trailers and open and ending themes.  If there was one thing lacking, it's the fact that there are really nothing in terms of special features.

As of this review, the latest Season 6 was released and I have started on season 5.  But I was quite pleased with Season 4, the whole android saga was great to watch when it first came out and to see future Trunks, Super Saiyan Vegita and everyone all together, fighting together once again.  It's just an all out great, mega-brawl and it's one of the reasons why ""Dragon Ball Z"" has become my favorite action anime series of all time.

I do have to say that the android saga leaves off with a cliff-hanger and continues in Season 5.  So, you're definitely going to want to pick up Season 5 as it leads into another major threat that relates to the android-saga.

Again, for the price of over 30 episode....it's a great deal!  I just hope that Funimation sets the trend of other companies considering their anime DVD releases via box set for a similar price.  But nevertheless, if you are a ""Dragon Ball Z"" fan, you can't go wrong with this series.  Cool characters that you care about, storylines that capture your attention and a series that is just action-packed.

Another season of ""Dragon Ball Z"" worth owning!",1224460800,,4617,4.559466019417476

3054232,4,B0010X8NMS,"I've been watching this series over & over for about 10 years now, and must say that this is the beginning of the BEST story line in the series. Once Cell enters into the series, you'll know what I mean.

VIDEO QUALITY - Ignore the bad reviews. You won't even miss anything that was cropped out of the original print. Only the top & bottom 5% portions were cut, so NOTHING VITAL IS MISSING. I would have preferred they left the frames intact, but the original copy was too badly damaged to get a better digital quality from those sections. The reviewers who say otherwise are just not understanding the procedures needed to take to transfer film to DVD code (in layman's terms).The image is MUCH better than the previous video releases (U.S. OR Japanese).

SOUND QUALITY - While the claim to keeping the original Japanese audio overlayed with the English voice cast is true, I think they could have / should have kept the same Opening track in Japanese as well (known as ""Cha-La-Head-Cha-La""). Instead they replaced it with a guitar track that doesn't really keep the timing well with the opening sequence. Otherwise, the sound has been cleaned up and sounds much smoother than previous releases did.

SPECIAL FEATURES - The marathon feature is great, being able to watch every episode on each disc right after one another, without the credits or opening sequences. Being able to watch it in Japanese with (badly translated) English Subtitles is nice as well. However, that's about it. I think Funimation could do a LOT better with the features, like adding in interviews with the Voicing cast, some studio outtakes, etc. There are only previews of other Funimation releases to look at, nothing else.

OVERALL - Great if you are only interested in the series, and looking for better video and sound. If you want cool special features, you'll have to get Japanese release DVD's (which also means a DVD player that supports that Region Code for DVDs), which is also a crap-shoot.",1216425600,,1977,4.788856304985337
3054233,5,B0010X8NMS,"The first thing I thought when I saw the box for this dvd was, Who the heck is Garlic Jr?  I have read all the manga books and I never saw him once.  So far this series had given us much filler, scenes that were slighlty longer than need to be but this is an entire saga of filler.  Not only that but it creates some weird backstory about how Gohan and Goku defeated Garlic Jr. and sealed him in the dead zone.  Did I miss something?  When did this happen?  I have seen all the Dvd sets up to now  I have tried to think of a time period it could have happened but I am stumped.  Gohan and Goku were never together long enough to fight anything except on Namek and this epic fight occured on earth.  Did Trunks mysterious time travelling create yet another timeline?  Eh, I won't lose sleep over it.

  Once I opened up the dvd and looked at the episode liner notes I had my second though; the spice boys?  Really?  Is this some sort of reference to the spice girls.  It can't be since this show was around way before the spice girls were around so maybe it is just a big coincidence but if it isn't then that might just be the lamest joke in the history of the series.  The boys actually aren't that bad(they are a lot more reserved than the goofy Ginyu force)but at the end of the day they have to walk inside their house look into the mirror and realize they are called the friggin' Spice boys.

  My third thought as I was watching the series unfold was; man, these androids are annoying.  The things that made Frieza such a great villain are personified in the beings of #17 and #18 who look like a couple of spoiled punk kids hanging out at the mall and they can get anythingthey want without any effort.  Frieza was a great villain because he was so insufferable he made you feel sorry for Vegeta for having to serve under him.  And when Vegeta gets beat down by a smirking, big forehead having android after having worked so hard top finally become a super saiyan then you feel for him as well.  What's a spiky haired, constipated alien to do?  Seriuosly though, Vegeta is one of my favorite Anime characters and i don't like seeing him get crushed.  Though in a way that makes me like him more.  His Saiyan pride and his constant feelings of inferiority to Goku(Kakarooot!) are what makes him such a great character.

  Anyway, even though I was tempted to take off a star for having to endure a nonsensical saga that was quite literally crammed into the storyline by means of dark magic and/or time travel but in the end I enjoyed making fun of the spice boys so much it was worth the time spent.  With that in mind  let me present the spice boys rap; ""We're the spice boys and we're here to say*/we're a bunch of crappy filler villains so you better get ouuta the way/we'll punch and kick you and do things real gay/so you'd better savekamitravelundergroundspreadmagicwaterthroughoughtheworldtobreakthementalcontrolyadayad  and save the day.  Peace out...we suck.""

*P.s. I am aware that this is the starting line of almost every crap rap of the eighties.  I couldn't help it.

P.p.s.  By now I am aware of how Garlic jr. was in the dead zone movie.  Seriously, a movie?  If they couldn't put this idiot in season 1,2 or 3 he has no business being in season 4.  Garlic Jr.  Worst Villain ever:(",1214697600,,3304,4.375617792421746

I just got this set at Best Buy for 19.99 and 2 days later Amazon decides to FINALLY drop the price to 19.99. WHAT ARE THE ODDS? I was waiting and waiting 4 Amazon 2 drop the price cause all their other DBZ box sets were purchased by me at 19.99. Anyways I'm so glad i can finally experience the 4th season because Frieza was really dragging on. And the fact he was voiced by a WOMAN was even more annoying. Ever since these box sets came out i have become a fan for life because i couldn't enjoy this show when it aired as i started watching when it was so deep in the episode count that i didn't bother to catch up. Anyways the series is great and as i was watching the Frieza saga i realized how great the picture clarity was and it almost didn't seem like this was a cartoon animated in the late 80's early 90's. Just beautifully drawn. But when i started watching season 4 i noticed all the SLOPPY artwork and just bad drawings. I was sooo repulsed by what i saw, absolutely SLOPPY!!!! I only caught like 3 episodes but hopefully the entire series won't be this way. It says digitally remastered and restored footage and from what i saw i thought it was a cartoon from the 1970's. This didn't exist in the first 3 box sets so i was shocked it was on this one. I cant wait for season 5.

what i've figured out. correct me if i'm wrong.

season 1 television saiyan saga 26 episodes
season 1 dvd set saiyan saga 39 episodes
season 1 television / episode 26: the batte ends
season 1 dvd set / episode 39:friends or foes?
but episode 39 on the television series is actually season 2: stay away from frieza.

season 2 television namek & ginyu sagas 27 episodes
season 2 dvd set namek & ginyu saga 35 episodes
episode 60 on television: captain ginyu the frog
episode 60 on dvd set: bulma's big day
but episode 74 on television is actually season 4: frieza's boost & frieza's boost on dvd set is episode 89

season 3 on dvd set 33 episodes that adds up to 107 episodes
on television series episode 107 is ( mysterious youth )of the trunks saga
on dvd set episode 107 is ( goku's alive ) from the frieza saga

season 4 on dvd set 32 episodes that adds up to 139 episodes
on television series episode 139 ( saiyans emerge ) from the cell saga
on dvd set episode 139 is ( unwelcome discovery ) the beginning of the cell saga which is season 8 on television.

so are we getting the full 291 episodes? of the series

The new dubbing isn't bad, just unnessasary. Sabat re did some of Vegetas lines, which were good, but not really needed. Marrons new voice is horrible though, her old voice suited her perfectly, but her new one is awful. and Some of the Spice Boys have been re dubbed as well. something else i noticed as i was comparing this new version with my older dvds, is that even with the new widescreen, i didn't notice any cropped picture. I was looking really hard, and pauseing, ect, it doesent looked cropped at all. and i even noticed on one particular scene, there was more footage on the top then in the full screen dvd i had. i was really suprised by that. and the footage you gain on the sides is really worth noting. overall i would reccomend this dvd set. don't let my 4 star rating stop you from buying this phenomenal boxset.",1203984000,,978,4.3497267759562845
3054258,4,B0010X8NMS,"With Goku still not back from Namek it is time for evil doers to run rampant all over Earth. The only thing they didn't count on was that fact that there are others out there just as strong as Goku. In Dragon Ball Z season 4 we witness the calm before the next big storm. It is up to Krillin, Piccolo, Vegita and Goku's son Gohan to stop the badies such as Garlic Jr. and the Spice Boys from taking over Kame's lookout tower. It is up to a strange new commer Trunks to welcome the suriving Frieza and his Dad and to prevent them from destroying the Earth.

Now there is a bigger threat looming in the shaddows and now with Goku on his way home Earths special forces are going to need to train long and hard so when the next menace arrives they will be ready.

I agree with all the other people that have reviewed this season. These three sagas following the Frieza saga are just fillers for a break in the action from the next big menacing force, but if you think about it that's how it has been since season 1! First came Vegita then a break then Frieza and now another break. So whenever this new menace comes around (I know who it is but I would rather be respectable to all the first time watchers of DBZ)there will obviously be another break in the action once the next major villian is put to rest.",1203984000,,1304,4.170634920634921
3054259,4,B0010X8NMS,"I'm a bit disappointed with these releases. Not by the widescreen, but the dubbing and the music.

First off, the characters of Muron and Android 19 had their voices dubbed much differently, which was a bit shocking to me. I also disagree with the continuing lack of Bruce Faulconer's famous soundtrack that plays a greater role when Trunks and the Androids appear. I'm sure many fans could agree with me so far.

I'd also like to point out that season 5 will have only 26 episodes! That's twenty seven episodes short of ending the Cell saga off including Trunk's departure to his own time. I guess Season six will be the Cell Games Saga. I'm pretty sure they will only allow 27 episodes and save Season 7, 8 and possibly 9 for the Saiyaman and Buu Sagas. Unbelievable. The only reason I will continue to buy these sets is because I have gone along this far. So sorry fans, but I'm just as angry as you are.",1203724800,,907,4.425149700598802

Everyone can agree with me when I say that the original aired version of DBZ had great color quality. The whole show had beautiful color schemes combined with the variety of movement. It was absolutely perfect. However... the newly remastered sets have a dull and somewhat lifeless color pattern. It's just not the same!!!

3054269,5,B0010X8NMS,"This has not been released yet so my review will be based on previous viewings of the episodes.

This is when things start to get really powerfull! DBZ has been called ""The greatest action cartoon ever made!"" I agree 100%. That being said this was/is the greatest season ever made. It's starts most likely with the Blackwater mist saga an auspicious begining. The only thing the B-W-M saga does is waste/fill time. Then we have the Trunks saga. This saga really shows how the power level has risen. With the eminant return of Frieza, Goku still missing, and a new frieghtfully powerfull young man, the drama is there. After everything settles down a bit The Z fighters find out about a new threat even greater than Frieza. Enter the Android saga. An enemy from Goku's past comes back to haunt him and his friends. A really dramatic action packed saga where Krilin falls for an attractive but vollatile advesary.

I really hope the original score is available for this season. There were some fantastic techno beats in this saga that I would love to hear in Dolby 5.1. I do find the original score is kinda fitting for the action in the first 3 seasons. So I won't be too disapointed if not.

If the first 3 realeses are any indication of quality expect a few chopped/cropped shots instead of actual widescreen. I know they had some real hard repair work to do on the original film, but don't sell me a mule and call it horse.

All in all a fantastic purchase for the DBZ fan or any fan of anime. Of course you should start at season one, but if you want to jump in without seeing every episode from the begining this is the season to do it.",1197417600,,1640,4.438538205980066

You can put the dvd on marathon mode and let it roll and sit back and see episode after episode without any interruptions . You miss all the beginning songs and credits , they only show them once in opening  and once at end . Amazon let me catch up on so many episodes i have missed and i plan on buy all the dbz dvd's i can . ( Regular episodes through dbz kia, gt , resurrection , and god saga  -I haven't  seen any of those -only seasons 3 and 4 and varied stuff on tv .) Amazon is giving me the opportunity to see them at very good prices . Hurray !

3288323,4,B0010X8NMS,"Don't get me wrong, this season is fantastic. From the time Frieza enters the earths atmosphere to the time trunks finds Cells time capsule, this is a 5 star season. However, the first 7-9 episodes are literally 100% filler. The garlic jr saga should not be considered canon. Especially since the movie ""dead zone"" isn't canon. It's stupid, and it makes the Z fighters look super weak. Including gohan. Skip past all over that junk please",1466467200,,438,4.776315789473684

3288341,5,B0010X8NMS,Awesome season.

3288342,3,B0010X8NMS,"Love this season and it came in perfect condition. My problem with it is that it was voiced over again, for whatever reason. It probably doesnt bother most but i just couldn't help but notice how many of the voices of the characters were slightly different and the lip movements were more off than normal. At first it didn't really bother me too much but the more i watch i notice that they changed a lot of words that i know for a FACT were different, and were much more realistic in the original. They also put less episodes on each disk so the season doesnt actually go all the way through, leaving you with a cliffhanger ending forcing you to buy the next season. It almost seems like a rip off at this point.",1461801600,,713,4.288888888888889

The only negative thing I have to say is that it, and the others,  didn't come with the episode guide. I know this may seem like a minor detail, but I use to as an easy way to satisfy exactly what episodes I need to watch if I want to see a certain parts of the series.",1461628800,,439,3.932584269662921

3288376,5,B0010X8NMS,"My favorite saga in the entire series. Nothing beats the trunks/android/cell saga!
The reason I love this season is because it had a different atmosphere than the other seasons. It was slightly more dark and suspenseful...and the plot was pretty interesting.

3288398,4,B0010X8NMS,"This season is broken into two parts.  1st is the Garlic Jr. Saga and the 2nd is the Android Saga.  These sagas are completely unrelated and have no decent transition.  The Garlic Jr. Saga was terrible with the main antagonist having recovered from a fate worse than death that resulted from when he opened a portal in a previous saga.  The story line was predictable and without much growth.  This season leaves the Android saga incomplete ending on cliff hangers, which means I have to buy season 5 to know what happens next.  Since the series has redundant flashbacks and I really just wanted the Android saga, I should have just bought season 5.",1431388800,,649,4.649122807017544

3288528,5,B0010X8NMS,"I know a lot of people don't like the orange bricks since the series is cropped in 16:9 instead of being 4:3. Trust me, I know your pain losing some of the picture. However with the Blu-rays being cropped too and the Dragon Box sets being expensive as hell, this is your best bet having DBZ in English on DVD. I can point out a handful of times in each episode where the heads are cut off from the cropping but the picture is remastered in comparison to the old VHS releases. This set is perfect except for the cropping. Get past that and you got DBZ!",1389916800,,551,4.158878504672897

Let this be learned to NEVER buy from them.",1388361600,,359,4.454545454545454

I know it is a small issue but the tabs that holds the discs in the case were broken on two of them and this is a six discs set. So when I hold up the case, the two dvds gets bounced around and sometimes falls out of the case. This was my first time buying a season dvd/bluray on-line, and probably my last. I would rather search and buy it from a store than have this happen to me again. Don't get me wrong...

My favorite feature of this box set is the marathon feature option. This allows you to watch all the episodes on each disc w/o any previews or opening/closing songs.

Now that technology has changed since the 90s, a lot of remakes are being made. This version is from the original Japanese intro and outros. I grew up on the 90s version of the intro and outros(definitely not the same and the 90s version was in English) so for this one I was a bit surprised but the picture is clear as it can be. Also, it is NOT like the Toonami version that the US was given. It is the original Japanese version of the show. The shows are in English, clear, precise, no commercials, just a small 10 second cut away, in each episode. I can sit an watched these all day because as you know back on TV the commercials was so annoying so to have no commercials and you transition well between shows, it is a TREAT. Go get your popcorn, and relax cause you will be officially apart of the show.

You don't spend hours watching all of the talking scenes mixed in with a little action, but instead have a healthy balance in season 4. This is a must have for any Dragon Ball Z fan!",1279670400,,456,4.134831460674158
3288673,5,B0010X8NMS,"Dragon Ball Z Season 4, most of this set is really more of the same. Presented in wide-screen format, the screen crops off some of the top and bottom picture, while revealing more of the sides. It fits perfectly on a widescreen television, and even looks decent on a standard television. The film transfer itself is very good. The original framerate has been restored so the animation looks a lot more fluid. The difference is definitely noticeable. The colors have been restored and while the grain has been cut back considerably, it still isn't perfect.

The biggest flaws in all these sets are the vulnerability of the packaging. It isn't too uncommon for discs to get scratched or for the box to come apart and the damages done are sometime irrevocable. When releasing a series as popular as this, Funimation really should've been smarter with the packaging. As usual there are no extras to speak of, some textless songs and trailers.

Storywise season 4 is a transitional stage. It starts with the filler saga about the return of Garlic Jr. an immortal villain from the first DBZ movie. It's actually a pretty good saga that has some nice fight scenes and overall does a good job at filling in the space until the next major event. It's the first step in showing how Gohan inevitably has to step up to take his father's place as leader of the Z-Fighters.

After that is about two episodes that encompass the `Trunks Saga'. Rather short for a self-titled story arc no? Anyways Freiza survived his fight with Goku and comes to Earth rebuilt as a cyborg along with his father King Kold. The Z-Fighters panic to assemble a team to resist the icy tyrant but they are beaten to the punch by a mysterious teenage Super Saiyan. I can't say I like the way Frieza and his father are beaten so easily by this young new character. They should've put up a better fight, but alas. The new character dispatches the alien invaders and invites the other Z-fighters to accompany him to meet Goku upon his landing planet side.

After the main character finally returns, Goku and the new Super Saiyan have a one-on-one conversation. We learn that the young boy is a fighter from the future named Trunks, the son of Bulma and Vegeta. He travels to the past because in his time the world is destroyed by the Androids, artificial beings created by the maniacal Dr. Gero. With this startling revelation Trunks gives Goku some medicine to make sure he doesn't die of a radical new heart virus that will strike him before the Androids arrive, so that Goku can help in the battle. The Z-fighters each begin their own special training to prepare for the appearance of the androids.

Three filler episodes are all that separates the Trunks Saga from the beginning of the Android Saga. Three years pass and the Z-Fighters assemble to battle the androids. Goku's heart virus takes him out of the action early, and Vegeta arrives just in time to save him. Revealing that he has finally become a Super Saiyan as well, Vegeta makes short work of the first android. After a lengthy and `suspenseful' chase scene, the second android is cornered and defeated rather soundly by Piccolo. However Trunks arrives and announces that the androids they are fighting aren't the same as the androids from his time. Bulma adds to the revelations by announcing the android who escaped Piccolo is actually Dr. Gero. Another race sequence begins as the Z-Fighters search out Gero's lab, while the evil doctor himself does the same.

Inevitably Gero activates his other two androids, but 17 and 18 quickly turn against and kill the doctor. They proceed to activate another android that even Trunks did not know about, 16. Vegeta proceeds to challenge the androids himself and has a spectacular fight with 18 but in the end the Saiyan Prince falls, along with all the other Z-Fighters. Only Krillin stays out of the fight, but surprisingly the Androids don't kill any of them. Instead they continue with their primary mission of assassinating Goku, who's still recovering from his heart virus.

Before the Z-Fighters can figure out what to do about androids 17 and 18, another menace arises. That struggle will begin in the next season.",1272931200,,4189,4.761707988980716

3288676,5,B0010X8NMS,"Dragonball Z is famous across the globe, most noted for being one of the all time most popular anime series ever created.  The show does an excellent job of staying true to the mangas, with few name changes and plot adjustments.  This collection happens to be my personal favorite collection of all of the available ones to choose from.  Why?  It's because of the interesting sagas that it contains.

The Garlic Jr Saga is a great series of episodes that is highly overlooked.  Garlic has returned from his ""Dead Zone"" imprisonment.  He now seeks revenge on the earthlings, and will stop at nothing to continue his attack on Piccolo and Kami for the death of his father.  Armed with new henchmen and still gifted with immortality, it seems as if Garlic Jr is unstoppable.  The fight between Gohan, Krillin, Piccolo and Garlic Jr is one of the most action packed ones ever placed within the anime.  The plot is great, and the show does a great job of keeping the viewer enticed and engaged through the many surprising twists hidden within this saga.

The second Saga that this collection contains is one of the most popular sagas of the show, the Trunks Saga.  The Trunks Saga marks the arrival of Trunks and the announcement of the impending doom of the entire planet.  The addition of this saga marked a new chapter in the Dragonball Z universe.  It was once viewed ""impossible"" to become a Super Saiyan, but as this saga proves, Super Saiyan is no longer a feet unachievable by Saiyans.  With the introduction of this saga, power levels increase and enemies once viewed as formidable are no longer so.  Once viewed as the strongest being in the universe, Frieza arrives on Earth seeking revenge for his near-death experience that was handed to him on Namek by Goku.  Frieza knows that Goku is going to arrive late, so he intends to have some fun with the planet's inhabitants before Goku arrives.  Little did he know that another Super Saiyan exists.  Trunks quickly dispatches the villain and his father in a matter of seconds.  He then goes on to reveal the future that will come to pass, a future where everyone on Earth has been killed by a pair of diabolical androids/cyborgs.

This is a nice little DVD collection.  It comes in a nicely sized box with a folding DVD case.  The collection pack comes with six DVDs containing remastered footage from the anime.  The quality of the images has been touched up, but it also contains image cropping.  The sound is better, a much sharper, cleaner quality, but the volume level could use some work, seeing as the actual episodes are more quiet than the rest of the DVD contents.  This collection is simply amazing in every way conceivable.  A perfect season to purchase if you're a DBZ fan.",1264377600,,2740,4.665970772442589

3288688,3,B0010X8NMS,"The Dragon Ball Z Season Four DVD box set includes six DVDs that contain thirty-two episodes.  The first three discs contain six episodes, discs four and five contain five episodes, and the sixth disc contains four episodes and the DVD extras.

One of my favorite things about this DVD set is the marathon feature.  This feature allows you to watch all of the episodes back-to-back, but you only see the opening credits once; the ending credits are not shown when watching with the marathon feature.  This feature really helps when you're trying to watch all the episodes on a single disc in one sitting.  Luckily, none of the story arcs on this set were dragged out for a ridiculous amount of time.

Unfortunately, there isn't much in the way of special features.  All you get are the textless versions of the opening and ending credits (this feature was already included on the first three DVD box sets), and trailers.  Unfortunately, these features aren't very ""special.""

Another problem with this set is the audio mastering levels.  FUNimation's opening splash screen and the trailer at the beginning of each DVD were mastered at a high audio level, but the menu and the actual episodes were mastered with a rather soft audio level.  It's frustrating to have to sharply turn the volume down when you put the DVD into the player, and then having to turn the volume back up considerably in order to hear the audio for the episodes.

While I was disappointed with the audio levels and the lack of special features, this set is still a ""must get"" for any Dragon Ball Z fan that wants all the episodes on DVD.",1260230400,,1609,4.686832740213523

Patience is needed throughout this season because no major fights happen, but many interesting things begin to develop. Overall, I would obviously recommend it to any anime fan.",1252108800,,439,4.714285714285714
3288690,5,B0010X8NMS,"I've been a diehard ""DragonBall Z"", ""DragonBall GT"", and ""DragonBall"" fan ever since I was six years old and I love this DVD boxset! All of the storylines/sagas are way too long to explain everything that happened in them, but, basically, while all of the good guys think that Frieza is gone for good, a whole bunch of other villains show up and try to rule the world/universe, such as Garlic Jr., who appeared in the ""DBZ"" movie: The Dead Zone,and his new henchmen, the Spice Boys, Salt, Mustard, and the rest, first appear, then later on, Frieza and his father, King Cold, then, even later, Dr. Gero/Android 20, Android 19, and Androids 16, 17, and 18. Almost all of those villains are some of my favorite villains from the show. Also, Trunks, Vegeta and Bulma's son, shows up in his saga, so there's a new good guy, too. You get all of the episodes in Season Four(The Garlic Jr., Trunks, and Android Sagas combined), such as the one where Garlic Jr. gets and then poisons almost all of the good guys with the Black Water Mist, the one where Trunks appears and kills Frieza and King Cold, ""Goku's Ordeal"", a hilarious episode, where, before the Androids appear, Chi-Chi, Goku's wife, forces him and Piccolo to get driving lessons; Piccolo drives well, but Goku can't drive at all and almost kills his driving instructor by driving way too fast and almost crashing into other cars! There's also another funny episode where Krillin tries to date Marron, and there's the Android Saga as well. The only things that I miss in this boxset are that there's no scene selection feature and that the American music that Bruce Faulconer made isn't there, but the show is still amazing! I love this boxset and I can't wait to get it and the rest of the ""DragonBall Z"", ""DragonBall GT"", and ""DragonBall"" boxsets that I don't have yet!",1247529600,,1823,4.62962962962963
3288691,5,B0010X8NMS,"Let me start off by saying this...If you are worried about buying this set because of the well known ""cropping-issue"" don't be. It's not nearly as bad as most people make it out to be. I finished watching it and there was not one instance where I could point out that it had in fact been cropped from the original episodes. I had to go online and find the comparisons to even notice. So yes there is cropping but in my opinion it in no way took away from the amazing experience of watching DBZ.

These episodes remastered are almost perfect.  The only problem I have with them (and with all the sets thereafter) is the fact that the voice acting in the remastered version has been changed.  In season 1 and 2 this was the best feature being as when these episodes originally aired it was with a different set of voice actors then Freiza saga on.  Having the audio done over was amazing.  There are instances, however in Season 3 onward where they have redone the voice acting in certain parts and it doesn't feel quite the same.  For example there are several instances where Gohan and Vegetas voice doesn't sound right.  Kinda like the voice actor couldn't get the voice to sound like it had years ago when these episodes were first dubbed.  All in all it doesn't change much of the experience.  Just kinda a nuisance for hardcore fans.

Anyways...on to the point...DBZ is and ALWAYS will be my favorite anime (or one of at least)...[not to say I dislike DB OR DBGT, but due to lionsgate's annoying and asinine behavior, I STILL have not seen Dragon Ball aside from some old VHS tapes I still have). So,  simply put: if you love or just like DBZ enough to want or are merely curious about weather or not this would be a wise purchase...IT IS!

Season 4 is definitely going to excite some fans as one of the more popular characters, Future Trunks is featured on the box cover.

The season starts off with the Garlic Jr. arc that I wasn't too caring for, while the fate of Goku is still unknown after the battle with Frieza, everyone else gets accustomed to their own lives as Gohan is stuck at home studying for school exams and his mother Chi Chi is very striict with him. Piccolo continues to train and Krillyn dates a beautiful, busty woman named Maron.

But eventually everyone reunites to take on the latest threat to their world when Garlic Jr. unleashes the black water mist upon the world and everyone turns evil with the exception of Piccolo, Krillyn, Gohan, Maron and Master Roshi.  With the help of Kame and Mr. Popo, the group take on Garlic Jr. and must save the world from the black water myst.

The next chapter features the return of Frieza and his father Cooler.  After Goku's battle with Frieza, it is learned that Frieza's father saved his son and made him even more powerful by taking his body parts and creating a cyborg.  Of course, Frieza now back, wants revenge on Goku and friends.

As everyone prepares to battle against Frieza and Cooler, a mysterious guy from the future makes an appearance.

The unknown warrior defeats Frieza and Cooler with ease and everyone realizes that he is a Saiyajin.  But the warrior tells everyone that Goku should be arriving that day and everyone is shocked to find out that Goku will be coming back.

Upon Goku's return, the future warrior reveals to Goku that he is Trunks, the son of Vegita and Bulma and warns him of upcoming danger as his world has been destroyed by the Androids.  He comes to the past to warn Goku to get him and his friends prepared for their battle because he can defeat the androids but he must take medication to help eliminate a virus that he is going to have soon.  According to Trunks, everyone except Gohan is killed but Goku dies due to a virus.  But by giving him an antidote, Goku can survive the virus once he gets sick.

So, for the next few years, Goku, Picollo and everyone must train for this major threat from dr. Jiro and the androids.

AUDIO:

This is where I'm so happy with these Funimation releases.  The fact that you can watch the series in both Japanese or English dubs but can listen to the English dub with the new digital music or the original Japanese music.

Having watched the series in its original Japanese language when it was first released, this time around, I have been watching the series in dub format and its one of the best English voice acting as Goku, Picollo, Gohan, Krillyn, every character...the voice acting is just well done.  There is not one character where I felt the voice acting was off or didn't fit.  Voice acting is well done!

VIDEO:

The video looks great on DVD and for those of us who have multi-generation fansubs or fading VHS tapes, just having these episodes on DVD and everything looking great.  I know some people have a problem with the show receiving some cropping but for me it's quite miniscule.

Special features include trailers and open and ending themes.  If there was one thing lacking, it's the fact that there are really nothing in terms of special features.

As of this review, the latest Season 6 was released and I have started on season 5.  But I was quite pleased with Season 4, the whole android saga was great to watch when it first came out and to see future Trunks, Super Saiyan Vegita and everyone all together, fighting together once again.  It's just an all out great, mega-brawl and it's one of the reasons why ""Dragon Ball Z"" has become my favorite action anime series of all time.

I do have to say that the android saga leaves off with a cliff-hanger and continues in Season 5.  So, you're definitely going to want to pick up Season 5 as it leads into another major threat that relates to the android-saga.

Again, for the price of over 30 episode....it's a great deal!  I just hope that Funimation sets the trend of other companies considering their anime DVD releases via box set for a similar price.  But nevertheless, if you are a ""Dragon Ball Z"" fan, you can't go wrong with this series.  Cool characters that you care about, storylines that capture your attention and a series that is just action-packed.

Another season of ""Dragon Ball Z"" worth owning!",1224460800,,4617,4.559466019417476

3288728,4,B0010X8NMS,I loved this season also. But it got 4 stars and not 5 cause when i receive this season in the mail the 5th disc was just laying around int he package with a few scratches and found that the clasp to hold the dvd in was broken so i need to be careful so that it doesn't get messed up any more that it is. But i recommend that if your a fan of DBZ to get all the seasons and watch them all in order. It will prolly bring back memories.,1216857600,,434,3.6774193548387095
3288729,4,B0010X8NMS,"I've been watching this series over & over for about 10 years now, and must say that this is the beginning of the BEST story line in the series. Once Cell enters into the series, you'll know what I mean.

VIDEO QUALITY - Ignore the bad reviews. You won't even miss anything that was cropped out of the original print. Only the top & bottom 5% portions were cut, so NOTHING VITAL IS MISSING. I would have preferred they left the frames intact, but the original copy was too badly damaged to get a better digital quality from those sections. The reviewers who say otherwise are just not understanding the procedures needed to take to transfer film to DVD code (in layman's terms).The image is MUCH better than the previous video releases (U.S. OR Japanese).

SOUND QUALITY - While the claim to keeping the original Japanese audio overlayed with the English voice cast is true, I think they could have / should have kept the same Opening track in Japanese as well (known as ""Cha-La-Head-Cha-La""). Instead they replaced it with a guitar track that doesn't really keep the timing well with the opening sequence. Otherwise, the sound has been cleaned up and sounds much smoother than previous releases did.

SPECIAL FEATURES - The marathon feature is great, being able to watch every episode on each disc right after one another, without the credits or opening sequences. Being able to watch it in Japanese with (badly translated) English Subtitles is nice as well. However, that's about it. I think Funimation could do a LOT better with the features, like adding in interviews with the Voicing cast, some studio outtakes, etc. There are only previews of other Funimation releases to look at, nothing else.

OVERALL - Great if you are only interested in the series, and looking for better video and sound. If you want cool special features, you'll have to get Japanese release DVD's (which also means a DVD player that supports that Region Code for DVDs), which is also a crap-shoot.",1216425600,,1977,4.788856304985337
3288730,5,B0010X8NMS,"The first thing I thought when I saw the box for this dvd was, Who the heck is Garlic Jr?  I have read all the manga books and I never saw him once.  So far this series had given us much filler, scenes that were slighlty longer than need to be but this is an entire saga of filler.  Not only that but it creates some weird backstory about how Gohan and Goku defeated Garlic Jr. and sealed him in the dead zone.  Did I miss something?  When did this happen?  I have seen all the Dvd sets up to now  I have tried to think of a time period it could have happened but I am stumped.  Gohan and Goku were never together long enough to fight anything except on Namek and this epic fight occured on earth.  Did Trunks mysterious time travelling create yet another timeline?  Eh, I won't lose sleep over it.

  Once I opened up the dvd and looked at the episode liner notes I had my second though; the spice boys?  Really?  Is this some sort of reference to the spice girls.  It can't be since this show was around way before the spice girls were around so maybe it is just a big coincidence but if it isn't then that might just be the lamest joke in the history of the series.  The boys actually aren't that bad(they are a lot more reserved than the goofy Ginyu force)but at the end of the day they have to walk inside their house look into the mirror and realize they are called the friggin' Spice boys.

  My third thought as I was watching the series unfold was; man, these androids are annoying.  The things that made Frieza such a great villain are personified in the beings of #17 and #18 who look like a couple of spoiled punk kids hanging out at the mall and they can get anythingthey want without any effort.  Frieza was a great villain because he was so insufferable he made you feel sorry for Vegeta for having to serve under him.  And when Vegeta gets beat down by a smirking, big forehead having android after having worked so hard top finally become a super saiyan then you feel for him as well.  What's a spiky haired, constipated alien to do?  Seriuosly though, Vegeta is one of my favorite Anime characters and i don't like seeing him get crushed.  Though in a way that makes me like him more.  His Saiyan pride and his constant feelings of inferiority to Goku(Kakarooot!) are what makes him such a great character.

  Anyway, even though I was tempted to take off a star for having to endure a nonsensical saga that was quite literally crammed into the storyline by means of dark magic and/or time travel but in the end I enjoyed making fun of the spice boys so much it was worth the time spent.  With that in mind  let me present the spice boys rap; ""We're the spice boys and we're here to say*/we're a bunch of crappy filler villains so you better get ouuta the way/we'll punch and kick you and do things real gay/so you'd better savekamitravelundergroundspreadmagicwaterthroughoughtheworldtobreakthementalcontrolyadayad  and save the day.  Peace out...we suck.""

*P.s. I am aware that this is the starting line of almost every crap rap of the eighties.  I couldn't help it.

P.p.s.  By now I am aware of how Garlic jr. was in the dead zone movie.  Seriously, a movie?  If they couldn't put this idiot in season 1,2 or 3 he has no business being in season 4.  Garlic Jr.  Worst Villain ever:(",1214697600,,3304,4.375617792421746

I just got this set at Best Buy for 19.99 and 2 days later Amazon decides to FINALLY drop the price to 19.99. WHAT ARE THE ODDS? I was waiting and waiting 4 Amazon 2 drop the price cause all their other DBZ box sets were purchased by me at 19.99. Anyways I'm so glad i can finally experience the 4th season because Frieza was really dragging on. And the fact he was voiced by a WOMAN was even more annoying. Ever since these box sets came out i have become a fan for life because i couldn't enjoy this show when it aired as i started watching when it was so deep in the episode count that i didn't bother to catch up. Anyways the series is great and as i was watching the Frieza saga i realized how great the picture clarity was and it almost didn't seem like this was a cartoon animated in the late 80's early 90's. Just beautifully drawn. But when i started watching season 4 i noticed all the SLOPPY artwork and just bad drawings. I was sooo repulsed by what i saw, absolutely SLOPPY!!!! I only caught like 3 episodes but hopefully the entire series won't be this way. It says digitally remastered and restored footage and from what i saw i thought it was a cartoon from the 1970's. This didn't exist in the first 3 box sets so i was shocked it was on this one. I cant wait for season 5.

season 1 television saiyan saga 26 episodes
season 1 dvd set saiyan saga 39 episodes
season 1 television / episode 26: the batte ends
season 1 dvd set / episode 39:friends or foes?
but episode 39 on the television series is actually season 2: stay away from frieza.

season 2 dvd set namek & ginyu saga 35 episodes
episode 60 on television: captain ginyu the frog
episode 60 on dvd set: bulma's big day
but episode 74 on television is actually season 4: frieza's boost & frieza's boost on dvd set is episode 89

season 3 on dvd set 33 episodes that adds up to 107 episodes
on television series episode 107 is ( mysterious youth )of the trunks saga
on dvd set episode 107 is ( goku's alive ) from the frieza saga

season 4 on dvd set 32 episodes that adds up to 139 episodes
on television series episode 139 ( saiyans emerge ) from the cell saga
on dvd set episode 139 is ( unwelcome discovery ) the beginning of the cell saga which is season 8 on television.

The new dubbing isn't bad, just unnessasary. Sabat re did some of Vegetas lines, which were good, but not really needed. Marrons new voice is horrible though, her old voice suited her perfectly, but her new one is awful. and Some of the Spice Boys have been re dubbed as well. something else i noticed as i was comparing this new version with my older dvds, is that even with the new widescreen, i didn't notice any cropped picture. I was looking really hard, and pauseing, ect, it doesent looked cropped at all. and i even noticed on one particular scene, there was more footage on the top then in the full screen dvd i had. i was really suprised by that. and the footage you gain on the sides is really worth noting. overall i would reccomend this dvd set. don't let my 4 star rating stop you from buying this phenomenal boxset.",1203984000,,978,4.3497267759562845
3288755,4,B0010X8NMS,"With Goku still not back from Namek it is time for evil doers to run rampant all over Earth. The only thing they didn't count on was that fact that there are others out there just as strong as Goku. In Dragon Ball Z season 4 we witness the calm before the next big storm. It is up to Krillin, Piccolo, Vegita and Goku's son Gohan to stop the badies such as Garlic Jr. and the Spice Boys from taking over Kame's lookout tower. It is up to a strange new commer Trunks to welcome the suriving Frieza and his Dad and to prevent them from destroying the Earth.

Now there is a bigger threat looming in the shaddows and now with Goku on his way home Earths special forces are going to need to train long and hard so when the next menace arrives they will be ready.

I agree with all the other people that have reviewed this season. These three sagas following the Frieza saga are just fillers for a break in the action from the next big menacing force, but if you think about it that's how it has been since season 1! First came Vegita then a break then Frieza and now another break. So whenever this new menace comes around (I know who it is but I would rather be respectable to all the first time watchers of DBZ)there will obviously be another break in the action once the next major villian is put to rest.",1203984000,,1304,4.170634920634921
3288756,4,B0010X8NMS,"I'm a bit disappointed with these releases. Not by the widescreen, but the dubbing and the music.

First off, the characters of Muron and Android 19 had their voices dubbed much differently, which was a bit shocking to me. I also disagree with the continuing lack of Bruce Faulconer's famous soundtrack that plays a greater role when Trunks and the Androids appear. I'm sure many fans could agree with me so far.

I'd also like to point out that season 5 will have only 26 episodes! That's twenty seven episodes short of ending the Cell saga off including Trunk's departure to his own time. I guess Season six will be the Cell Games Saga. I'm pretty sure they will only allow 27 episodes and save Season 7, 8 and possibly 9 for the Saiyaman and Buu Sagas. Unbelievable. The only reason I will continue to buy these sets is because I have gone along this far. So sorry fans, but I'm just as angry as you are.",1203724800,,907,4.425149700598802

Everyone can agree with me when I say that the original aired version of DBZ had great color quality. The whole show had beautiful color schemes combined with the variety of movement. It was absolutely perfect. However... the newly remastered sets have a dull and somewhat lifeless color pattern. It's just not the same!!!

3288766,5,B0010X8NMS,"This has not been released yet so my review will be based on previous viewings of the episodes.

This is when things start to get really powerfull! DBZ has been called ""The greatest action cartoon ever made!"" I agree 100%. That being said this was/is the greatest season ever made. It's starts most likely with the Blackwater mist saga an auspicious begining. The only thing the B-W-M saga does is waste/fill time. Then we have the Trunks saga. This saga really shows how the power level has risen. With the eminant return of Frieza, Goku still missing, and a new frieghtfully powerfull young man, the drama is there. After everything settles down a bit The Z fighters find out about a new threat even greater than Frieza. Enter the Android saga. An enemy from Goku's past comes back to haunt him and his friends. A really dramatic action packed saga where Krilin falls for an attractive but vollatile advesary.

I really hope the original score is available for this season. There were some fantastic techno beats in this saga that I would love to hear in Dolby 5.1. I do find the original score is kinda fitting for the action in the first 3 seasons. So I won't be too disapointed if not.

If the first 3 realeses are any indication of quality expect a few chopped/cropped shots instead of actual widescreen. I know they had some real hard repair work to do on the original film, but don't sell me a mule and call it horse.

All in all a fantastic purchase for the DBZ fan or any fan of anime. Of course you should start at season one, but if you want to jump in without seeing every episode from the begining this is the season to do it.",1197417600,,1640,4.438538205980066

8239175,5,B0010X8NMS,"I have this season, but I didn't order it from Amazon.  I got it years ago at Walmart in a box together with Season 3, The Frieza Saga.  Season 4 ends after the Frieza Saga and starts with Garlic Jr. Saga.  While a lot of us don't really care for the Garlic Jr. Saga which is non-canon, I have to say I like it.  Why, because it seems like a simpler saga not based on Super Saiyan transformations.  While it doesn't include Goku or Vegeta fighting, I think  it's cool to see Vegeta traveling through outer space with the desire to find Goku and become a Super Saiyan.  It's cool because we see a side fight with the next main characters before Gohan was Super Saiyan.  Gohan, Krillin, and Piccolo against Garlic Jr..  It's nice to see the non-saiyan characters as useful.  Garlic Jr. was also a cool underrated villain that can't die, took over Kami's lookout and how he spreads his evil to Earth.  I also ought to mention, all of us that watch D.B.Z. know it takes numerous episodes to defeat the main villain, but the Garlic Jr. Saga is a short simple fight.

What else makes this season great is Krillin's girlfriend, Maron.  Krillin would later have a daughter with the same name spelled differently.  I have to say, of all the females we get to know in the DragonBall series, and I've seen this on a DragonBall video discussion, Maron would have to be the hottest one.  She was a main character in the Garlic Jr. Saga.  We also see her in this season at Master Roshi's during the Androids Saga.  I have to say, one of the best ever D.B.Z. scenes that isn't an action scene which we remember the show for would have to be in episode 128, ""Double Trouble For Goku.""  Maron returning to the Kame House saying how she misses Krillin and turns on a lamp saying ""Come Back"" while the lamp moves and a heart is reflected.  That scene is too cool showing how hot Maron is.

We have the Trunks Saga, and Androids Saga.  Trunks beginning appearance was so cool, when becoming a Super Saiyan was a big deal.  We have cool fights with the Androids.  But, I will say even when I saw these episodes years ago on Toonami, I noticed it had bad direction and writing leading up to the Cell Saga, even though it had cool fights.  I mean we have different androids that Trunks didn't even know about Android 20 19 and 16.  We get introduced to new villains when we wonder when the main fight will start, if the androids in Future Trunks's timeline took over.  The power levels keep getting really high, and we see huge increases in power all of a sudden that doesn't always seem consistent with the series, and creations from earth more powerful than Frieza.  The episodes in this season end right before we meet Cell.  I read years later the reason for the bad direction during this Saga, while not a bad saga noticeably bad direction was because Toriyama wrote in the androids two different times, and one of his editors didn't like them either time.  So, he brought in Cell and wrote his way into the storyline.

Thanks for reading this.  One other thing I ought to mention is I feel like the action gets toned down after the Frieza Saga where the characters are able to hold their own more so against the villains.",1519603200,,3204,4.407155025553663
