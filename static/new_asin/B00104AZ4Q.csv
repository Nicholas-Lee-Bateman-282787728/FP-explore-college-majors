8236896,5,B00104AZ4Q,"Being an avid collector of Sting/Police material, when I noticed there was a DVD of this show, I quickly ordered one. I had an audio CD which I purchased way back when, so it was nice to see the original show. The footage looks to be from a televison broadcast, but it's shot well enough and the sound is actually pretty darn good. Sting has a quite a good time during this concert. WARNING : the songs he did with The Police are drastically altered for this ""jazz"" fest. If you are expecting to hear them like The Police played them, then do not buy this disc. If however, you are open to interpretation, you might get a kick out of this show. Branford Marsalis plays a few particularly great solos throughout.",1221609600,2,711,4.393939393939394
