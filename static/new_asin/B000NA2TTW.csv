2763031,4,B000NA2TTW,"With societies, as with individuals, it is often much easier for us to examine the mistakes of others than it is to take an honest look at our own. In both cases, however, honest examination is essential to making genuine progress. Aftershock succeeds in providing us with details on a topic of which most Gone-With-the-Wind-watching Americans are unaware: the atrocious violence and frequent chaos that followed Lee's surrender.

Anyone who has actually studied slavery and the slave trade as they existed in America (as opposed to simply treating them as unavoidable footnotes in U.S. history) is well-aware that it is difficult to fathom the cost of those institutions in human life, considering the shortened life spans, high morbidity rates, high infant mortality rates, etc., of those affected. On the other hand, we are aware of the literally millions who perished (some through intentional killings) in the Middle Passage and the 620 thousand Americans who died in the Civil War.

With all of the above in mind, we might be tempted to minimize the significance of the bloodshed that occurred during the Reconstruction era and the entire century of strife that followed the war; Aftershock, however, does an outstanding job of illustrating the former. This film tells the stories of a variety of individuals and organizations, including the Arkansas National Guard; ex-Confederate soldiers; state officials; African American troops; displaced Southern civilians; and one of our nation's oldest homegrown terrorist groups, the Ku Klux Klan. It also devotes a few (though not enough) moments to the often overlooked role of Native Americans in the post-war years. It even touches on the frustration that some government officials felt with Andrew Johnson's calamitous approach to the nation's troubles.

This is one of the few documentaries on the years immediately following the war that I would consider incorporating into a larger class project.",1189468800,101,1953,5.334415584415584
2763032,4,B000NA2TTW,"""Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward all men, except a few hell-born and hell-bound rebels in Knoxville.""

Union sympathizer and future Tennessee Governor William ""Parson"" Brownlow.  Quoted in Shelby Foote's ""The Civil War,"" Volume One.

""Swallow the dog"" - Confederates taking the oath of allegiance to the United States, which included renouncing all allegiance to the Confederacy.

As I write this, Iraq is on the verge of civil war, and there is great controversy over whether American forces are wanted or needed there.  Many of us assumed wrongly that when they were liberated from tyranny, everything would be sunshine and roses.  Instead, in some ways, things are even worse than before Saddam Hussein fell.  While the people are more free, they are slow to learn that freedom is never free.  Aftershocks are all too common in every conflict, as this aptly named special from A&E shows.  It contains violence and racial epithets that were all too common at the time and reveals how similar the current violence in Iraq is to the violence throughout the former Confederacy.

Part of my fascination with history is that it repeats itself, and this assures me that there are patterns to everything and that storms will always pass.  Reading or viewing programs about our own Civil War makes almost any other conflict seem like just a bad day at the office.  And this outstanding special from The History Channel shows that the years following the civil war were even worse than the war years themselves in some ways.  Officially, the war ended in April of 1865 with Lee's surrender, but actual fighting did continue, and when soldiers returned home, they returned to find their beloved lands destroyed, their economy obliterated, and the newly freed slaves were in some ways even worse off than before.  Violence was a daily occurrence in almost every southern city of any size, and our own reign of terror broke out.

Historians interviewed for this program elaborate on how important the slave trade was to the South, being a $4 billion dollar industry, about $30 billion in today's dollars.  And of course it artificially propped up the cotton economy with it, and when it all went away, the Federal Government under President Andrew Johnson did very little to help anyone.  Programs to reconstruct the south were instituted, but underfunded and barely managed in any way.  With Abe Lincoln gone, his hopes to rebuild the nation died with him.  Johnson unfortunately was like many northerners in that he hated slavery mainly because it gave so much power to the plantation owner elites.  When slavery went away, he felt little sympathy for the people themselves.  And of course southern whites, who had lost so many lives, property, and most of all Southern pride, took all of their frustrations out on their new brethren.  At least when slaves were valuable property, there was motivation to discipline them but not to kill them unnecessarily.  With that motivation gone, and with radical Republicans being shot on sight, it was as if the war never ended and was fought for nothing.  The unrest gave rise to our own home-grown terrorist organization, the KKK, who inflicted wounds into America from which she may never heal.  They were the terrorists of the day, the Al Qaeda of the American South.

One of the best analogies applied to the Civil War in this special is that while 9/11/01 involved terrorism and death on Wall Street, the market itself was only dented, not destroyed.  In the former Confederacy, one-fourth of all able-bodied males were dead, and the agrarian economy was obliterated.  Reconstruction in some ways was never finished.

The program shows a re-enactment of a sort you won't see staged anywhere.  Governor Brownlow in Tennessee takes voting rights away from former Confederates but gives it to blacks.  He threatens to shoot legislators when they refuse to come in to vote. When Federal soldiers order a southern woman to display mourning for President Lincoln, she refuses on the grounds that she lost her husband and son to the war.  When they insist, she goes inside to retrieve her widow's garments, but instead of putting them on, she ties them above her porch and the other end into a loop.  Before anyone can stop her, she hung herself.  Much like Mr. Brownlow above, this incident showed that the Civil War was about pride and the right to self-determination. And in Tennessee, Governor Brownlow and KKK Grand Wizard Nathan Bedford Forrest prepare for an in-state civil war.  In Arkansas, a war did break out.

It is always a catastrophe when proud people turn against each other, whether in Paris, Charleston, or Baghdad.",1182384000,18,4698,4.932569974554707

All confederate leaders should have been hanged (including your beloved Robert E Lee and especially the despicable coward Nathan Forrest...he should have been burned alive at the stake).

The Civil Rights Movement and on Reverend King, Jr., didn't help. I felt that they misrepresented him and made him look flawed. That is just my opinion, maybe it's different for other individuals. In this one, it had too much fictional acting, and not enough photographic evidence. I have seen PBS in American Experience and in other organizations and for me, they've done a good job. The History Channel is more dramatic and subjective, from how I look at it. I did want to see the details of the human rights violations during that time period and throughout the twentieth century; I wanted to understand their suffering and feel the compassion that is in need for them. However, I could not with this film. Hopefully, there is something that will talk less of just mentioning slavery and show the detailed evidence and stories of the descendants, the poems, the letters, expressing how they felt, the individuals that had lived through that time period, especially the enslaved, and those that had been victims of the human rights violations up until the culmination of the Civil Rights Movement.

If this is your only source for the history around reconstruction then every Southern ""white"" owned or strived to own slaves, and then brutalized and murdered them. Also in their spare time Confederate soldiers ran around in the woods murdering indians. It wasn't enough to destroy Southern property, the economy, families, and culture, apparently every Southerner should have been executed without trial.

So many educational leftists are trying to infiltrate their revisionists history into our own American History books through their leftist political legislatures, and show ""Whitey"" as horrible and evil people.  Don't believe me ?  Look at many of the new history books being distributed throughout American schools today - - they show George Washington as a slave owner first, and the 1st President a distant second.  What is talked about the most ?  His slave-owning ways, damn his significance in the wars he fought in and country he led thereafter.  Harriet Tubman has 14 pages dedicated to her and what she did.  Thomas Jefferson has one - - - and he also is written about as having illigitamate Black children.

This fricken country is being sold down the river, people !  Wake up !  It's unconstitutional to say and advertise ""Christmas"" or talk about Christ or Jesus...that is classified today as being ""evil, hatred, non-inclusive, non-tolerant, spiteful""....yet in Detroit now, there are more Muslim mosques that do their load-speaker ""prayers"" each morning, and nobody even flinches anymore - - and is perfectly fine !

Trust me...there will be another ""Civil War"" in America once again !  People who are God-fearing Americans who LOVE THIS COUNTRY...and ""imports"" from the past 20-years CHANGING THE USA into a wimpering, limp-wristed & pathetic coward, allowing all radical groups to continue to enter this country !  Why ???  Ask Obama how many illegal aliens are allowed in, get federal benefits just so long as they vote ""Democrat"" !

Take it to the bank folks...our country will NEVER be like it was when we were growing up, the children of the ""Greatest Generation"" who gave their lives for this magnificent country in WW II.

2763061,4,B000NA2TTW,"A fairly nice overview of the Reconstruction Period after the American Civil War.  Old Hollywood films focused on the poor South after the war and how the carpetbaggers took advantage of them.  This focuses on some of the bad people who tried to keep White Supremacy lingering after they lost the war.  Interesting focuses on the Massacre of New Orleans, the land given to the freed slaves and, of course, the Klu Klux Klan.  There are some extreme bouts of violence for a Historical piece so I'd watch it with the kids.  In addition, some will argue that this piece paints the CSA in too much of a negative light.

Finally someone got it right.  The Reconstruction was as bloody as the war itself, both Northerns and Southerns were guility and everyone was involved.

A book or real historians would have to cite sources, apparently being a video gives Padrusch license to make things up.  This film mixes fact, and fiction with an obvious agenda to make southerners and the South look like evil, racists who violate blacks and Indians.  Zero ballance, huge generalizations - for example mentions ""thousands of blacks starved to death while conveniently  forgetting the fact thousands of white southerners also starved and it was the North that starved them both.  There is almost no mention of, or real examination, about outrages committed by the Federals or Radical Republicans.  It makes up dialog of historic figures like N.B. Forrest and fabricates his role in a ""KKK war"".  One point they show the well known photo (but they blur it) of a civil war soldier executed by the Federals as a black hung by the KKK.  They stage silly reenactments, like one where a real figure, General Daniel Phillips Upham, in completely fabricated hand to hand fight pulls the horn off a KKK man's hood and kills him by jabbing the horn in the KKK mans eye.
