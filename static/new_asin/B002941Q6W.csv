8357490,4,B002941Q6W,"This is a great DVD. It is good both for the saved and unsaved. It gives you a lot to think about. There would be nothing worse than to go through life believing that you are saved, only to discover that was not true and end up in the lake of fire. I recommend this DVD for all. I believe everyone should see it. Ray Comfort and Kirk Cameron have done well and I recommend other books and DVDs they have produced.",1397174400,2,413,4.048780487804878
