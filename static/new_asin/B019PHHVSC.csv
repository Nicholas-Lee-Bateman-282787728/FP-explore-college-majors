7578768,2,B019PHHVSC,"Mill Creek screws up again. You just never know what you're going to get from them. PERFECT was a 2:35 film, but Mill Creek has cropped it to 1:78 for unknown reasons. I had purchased this for PERFECT only...I didn't care about the other movies. I had a DVD import of PERFECT in its correct 2:35 aspect ratio and wanted to upgrade. Too bad Mill Creek did this...I'll just toss the blu ray now, write it up as ANOTHER waste of money on a Mill Creek blu ray, and keep the DVD. It looks better all around.",1458000000,3,502,4.185567010309279
7578769,4,B019PHHVSC,"This is a good value release from Mill Creek -- unless the only reason you want the disc is the John Travolta flop PERFECT. The transfer on the Blu-Ray is 1.78, cropped from the movie's wide 2.35 Panavision frame. Yes, it's even panned-and-scanned in several places. What's worse, the transfer is not HD. That's right, it looks like a standard-definition upscale. Perhaps Sony provided a standard-def broadcast master to Mill Creek, which is about the only thing that could explain it, but look closely and you will be able to tell this is not a genuine high-definition presentation.

The other 3 titles, though, look fabulous with lots of HD detail. Sound is plain Dolby Digital but seeing as PRIVATE RESORT, HARDBODIES and SPRING BREAK are mono, it's not a big deal.

Overall a real nice package under $10, but it's too bad PERFECT is anything but in terms of its transfer and source material.",1456963200,19,895,4.805194805194805
7578770,5,B019PHHVSC,"This set is meant to be the sleazy late night Rated R teen sex comedies of the 1980's
Mill Creek went the ""safe"" route with this set title
It should be Sun, Sand and Sex 4 movie Set Blu Ray (But, that might not look good selling at a Wal Mart or Target)
But, I'm pretty sure both those stores sell 50 Shades of Grey (the book)
Two of these films I've never seen  Private Resort and Perfect

Perfect is known for having a very young Jamie Lee Curtis looking amazing playing a aerobics instructor  (That in of itself makes me want to check it out)

But,  Spring Break is a above average film for this time period
the big draw for anyone growing up in the 80's is Hardbodies

Hardbodies is this strange skinamax type film (It's as though the director wanted to film a 1980's adult film but, was pressured into cutting back
It's a shallow and silly 1980's films that's a bit paper thin but, still super enjoyable
They really don't make films like this anymore which is a massive shame
I really love Hardbodies just for what it is (My review of the film is also on Amazon)
The price on this blu-ray set is also a real steal since Anchor Bay/Starz Hardbodies dvd  combo set is now out of print and super expensive
This Set is a must have for any children of the 80's  10/10",1453593600,10,1267,4.228215767634855
7578771,1,B019PHHVSC,"'80's camp-classic ""Perfect"", finally comes to Hi-Def!?  John Travolta and Jamie Lee Curtis sweat it out, in the gym and in the bedroom, against the neon lights of the 1980's aerobics craze! A manic pop-Soundtrack, swingers in spandex, big hair, and bad dialogue make this underrated gem a must-own for fans of bad cinema!  Unfortunately, ""Perfect"" arrives in a horrible cropped fuzzy transfer!  Keep your DVD, until someone has the balls to Remaster this (Widescreen) 80's masterpiece!",1452902400,6,486,5.285714285714286

7578782,4,B019PHHVSC,"This is a fun collection of some early to mid 80s Teen comedies. Before buying the set I had only seen Hardbodies.

Hardbodies-This was a huge cult hit thanks to HBO and other channels showing it fairly often. Filled with lots of hot women and comedy.

Private Resort-In the 5 days I have owned this set I have watched this movie 3 times. A young Johnny Depp and Rob Morrow get into all kinds of Hijinks. If you are a fan of Leslie Easterbrook,of Police Academy fame,you must see this film.

Spring Break-Directed by Sean Cunningham,director of Friday the 13th,this is another 80s film that was inspired by Porkys.

Perfect-The only bad film in the set. Watch a manish looking Jamie Lee Curtis prance around. While Travolta shows once again that what acting talent he once had ,disappeared in season 2 of Welcome Back Kotter.

None of the films have any extras. But you are getting 4 films on Blu ray for about 2 bucks a film. So you get your money's worth.",1460419200,9,957,4.508670520231214

7578787,5,B019PHHVSC,It's about time these great 80's movies get a blu-Ray release. I never seen perfect but the other 3 look great on blu-Ray. Spring break is my favorite movie on the disc. Hardbodies and private resort are good as well. They always would show these back in the great decade of the 80's all the time in the summer on Cinemax I remember watching spring break all the time back then. I hope hamburger the motion picture will get released on blu-Ray.,1459036800,3,444,4.426829268292683
8745657,3,B019PHHVSC,"Spring Break
Nelson and Adam, two shmoes arrive in FL for spring break and are teamed with a couple of NY party animals, Stu and O.T. and have their lives changed for the better as they battle sobriety, virginity and Nelson's father-in-law Senator wannabe and hotel stealer. Lots of nostalgic partying from 1983 along w/ the Penthouse Pet of the year Corinne Alphen 'singing' up a storm.  Nostalgia factor high as it was the first snuck-into R rated movie.

Hardbodies
Scotty and Rag bring their brand fo scam to the mix when they agree to teach three mid-lifers how to dialogue the hardbodies offering them BBDs on the beach in CA to disasterous results. Average sex comedy of the mid 80s.

Perfect
A slight step up from Private Resort, this movie is as shallow as the scene it purports to report on with Travolta heading west to CA to do an expose on health clubs as the new singles scenes.  Jamie Lee Curtis prances around awkwardly (she gets slightly better in True Lies eventually, laugh) as the lead aerobics instructor with Marilu Henner and Laraine Newman of all people as groupies.  Tough to get through.

Private Resort
Wow, missed this the first time around in the 80s but here is Johnny Depp and Rob Morrow trying to score on the weekend at a resort location and finding hijinks with diamond thieves, cultists and Andrew Dice Clay.  Makes Hardbodies look like Oscar material.  Bleargh!",1533772800,,1397,4.720164609053498

8745666,4,B019PHHVSC,"Good set for 4 films on two discs.  The picture is cleaned up pretty nicely.  I don't know why Perfect is in this collection.  It has nothing to do with the supposed theme of the other three flicks which is summer, beaches, nudity, sex, comedy.  So, of the three beach movies, Private Resort is the best.  No extras included for any of the films.",1467417600,2,346,4.34375
