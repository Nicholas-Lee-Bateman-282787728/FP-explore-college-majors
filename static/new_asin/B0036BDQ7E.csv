4075969,3,B0036BDQ7E,"Not bad, but get TCM Greatest Classic Films Collection: World War II - Battlefront Europe (Kelly's Heroes / Where Eagles Dare / The Dirty Dozen / Battleground) (2009)instead.  For the price, it is still a bargain, but I don't think any of the movies are outstanding except for Gunga Din. If you like Gunga Din, get this and consider the other movies as a bonus.",1313366400,3,361,4.553846153846154

These 4 movies were great (The Battle of the Dawn Gunga Pacific) was the best in the four pack. The orderly had to change my underwear 6 times during the episode and I loved every minute of it and the movie too. Please buy these movies and think of me when you watch them.",1307750400,2,486,4.072916666666667
4075972,5,B0036BDQ7E,"I have been an old classic movie fan for years.  One of my favorite genres is World War 2 movies.  And I have to say is that Operation Pacific is the best combination of World War 2 action, drama and combined love story of all the war movies I have seen.  This movie is so good that I have actually worn out the first copy I ordered from Amazon.com and am now waiting for the arrival of my second copy.  Believe you me, within 15 minutes of the package arriving to my home, I will have the movie playing.  And while Amazon does have the movie on a single dvd, the best bet is to buy as part of a set such as the one link I have attached. As well as the set I have taken the movie from.  All of the movies included are great and worth adding to any true classic movie collector's library!!

4075993,3,B0036BDQ7E,"These are great movies and the DVDs are well made. My issue is with the packaging.

The insert for the case describes two double-sided discs and tells which side which movie is on. Based on other reviews, this may have been true at one time. My case had four single-sided discs stacked on one post. Unless the discs are blank, I don't like stacked discs. I'm not a fan of double-sided discs either. Both can increase the chances of scratching the disc or getting smudges on the disc which can cause the disc to freeze during playback. All of these non-standard cases have created playback issues for me. A simple 4-disc case with individual spots for each DVD would have reduced the chances of these problems. With the current design, you have to touch the other discs too much. You might have to handle all four discs if the movie you want to watch is at the bottom of the stack - stack 3 discs off to the side as you handle the 4th disc you plan to play then put the 3 other discs back on the post/spindle.

I enjoyed all four movies with Gunga Din being my favorite. These bad case designs make it difficult to recommend this collection. However, if you're careful, you may be OK. Also invest in normal cases. I'm ordering some 4-disc cases for this and another set that gave me problems. Some players may also handle disc scratches and smudges better than others.",1435881600,2,1367,4.464

4075997,5,B0036BDQ7E,4 great movies on DVD for $8.  Product arrived quickly and DVD's are fine.,1431907200,,74,4.285714285714286
4075998,5,B0036BDQ7E,"All four discs in this set have good image & audio quality. The only quibble I have is that the four films are on two double-sided DVD's (one film per side), which I dislike because double-sided discs make it too easy to get my fingerprints all over them - I just like keeping my discs' data surfaces pristine.

'Gunga Din' is an all-time top notch classic that will never lose its pride of place in every list of cinema greats.

'The Dawn Patrol' is also a classic, albeit arguably just a shade under the high caliber of 'Gunga Din.' The script is rather dated, but I expect it will always be lovely just to see onscreen Errol Flynn and David Niven together in their youthful prime.

'The Battle Of The Bulge,' is a widescreen (filmed in the Cinerama process) epic that veers far from the actual history of the battle by using fictional characters in fictional narratives woven into and around the unfolding of the actual battle, yet it's quiet watchable for its own suspense and action flair.

'Operation Pacific,' a WWII U.S. Navy submarine tale, is not one of John Wayne's best movies, but it's not one of his worst either.

At least three of these discs have the enjoyable extra features of 'Warner Night At The Movies' to put you into Hollywood Golden Age mood.

In sum, if you find this set's price to be right, you'll get plenty of bang for your buck.",1428278400,3,1359,4.504065040650406

4076010,5,B0036BDQ7E,These are four great movies. I particularty love Gunga Din. A great Kipling tale. The Battle of the Bulge does an admirable job of portraying some of the many historical intricacies of this crucial WWII battle.,1392681600,,210,4.861111111111111

4076012,5,B0036BDQ7E,There were two films I wanted in this set GUNGA DIN /DAWN PATROL and I wasn't disappointed. Good transfers and good sound  and the other two were a bonus. Although I would like to get these sometime in the future on blu ray which gives a picture 5 times clearer than dvd they still get enhanced through a blu ray player.making them that much clearer than a dvd player will show them.,1389830400,3,383,4.319444444444445
4076013,5,B0036BDQ7E,it was a good look at re-actments of history as it unfolded in hollywoods action packed cinematographic points of view.,1389139200,,119,5.0
4076014,5,B0036BDQ7E,"I bought this for Gunga Din.  The other TCM films I own have great quality picture and sound and I wanted Gunga Din in a good copy.  This one is EXCELLENT and it is the FULL film, no cuts.  It is not really a ""war"" picture but a great action/adventure picture in the old Hollywood tradition.  The commentary is also excellent and gives lots of information about the film, actors and crew, this is the only film with a commentary track.  At this price the other 3 pictures are a wonderful bonus.  Battle of the Bulge is a beautiful print in ""Ultra-Panavision"" (2.55:1)and it is the only one in widescreen and color, the rest are the original B&W and standard format.  It is a Hollywood ""history"" picture in the tradition of ""The Longest Day"", very well done.  ""The Dawn Patrol"" is a good WWI RAF picture with a very good script.  ""Operation Pacific"" is a formula Hollywood WWII submarine picture, done in 1951, but it has sub-plots from a half-dozen WWII pictures and great production values AND, of course, John Wayne so it is a WWII picture worth having, too bad it does not have a commentary track.
All the prints are good picture an good sound and the price is right.  The packaging mine came in shows 2 double-sided DVDs but the package contained 4 single sided DVDs with labels.",1375574400,19,1283,4.515151515151516
