1900065,5,B0000A02YD,"In pop star Mr Spooner finally gets to star.  Having been demoted to lift attendant after supposedly non performance it turns out that a record company has spotted him at the work gig and now wants to sign him up on lucrative record contact.  His backing group was of course the rest of the cast, so the big question is are they also going to get a contract?  This is the last episode after 13 years of shows, the last customer, the last look and quip at the camera by Mr Humphries, the last stoush between Mrs Slocombe and Captain Peacock.  The episode ends with Mr Spooner(Mike Berry) singing as a pop star as he was in real life in the sixties with hits such as ""Tribute to Buddy Holly"".  The backing consists of Mrs Slocombe, Mr Humphries and Miss Brahams with Wendy Richards herself having a hit in the sixties with Mike Sarne and many great songs including ""Come Outside"", Will I What"" and ""Hello, Lover Boy"".  The final moments show the trio sing away and fading into the background and who would have thought that they would all pass away over a short period 2007 to 2009.  Like all classic shows ""Are You Being Served"" can be watched again and again.",1290470400,7,1159,4.413145539906103

1900067,3,B0000A02YD,"Mr. Grainger and Mr. Lucas are absent in this volume. The guy they got to replace Mr. Lucas just isn't that great.

These episodes are still funny and in keeping with the spirit of the show.

I loved Friends and Neighbors -- the employees are given the opprotunity to live in some apartments above the store.

The Night Club -- the staff are allowed to run a night club in the store after hours. Grace Brothers really is a crazy place. I found it hard to imagine having a night club in the middle of a clothing department where all the merchandise was out. Other than that, it was too funny. Especially when they make their own commercial and play it in a theater with audio only!

The Pop Star -- the Mr. Lucas wanna-be (Mr. Spooner) gets an opprotunity to be a singer. This is the final episode of the series and although funny there's a lot more singing than anything else (the singing is silly though).",1197417600,2,906,4.375
1900068,5,B0000A02YD,"This was one of their funniest shows recorded.  It was good to see how age had treated ""Captain Peacock, Miss Brahms, Mrs, Solcolmm and Mr. Humphries!  I own all but Vol 2 and 14 of Are you being served.  Love every one of them! LHM",1142294400,,232,4.111111111111111

1900073,5,B0000A02YD,"Are You Being Served? Vol 13 is yet another winner in my book.  There's only one episode in here that's ""less good"" (note I didn't say bad) than the others.  After all those years the cast still feels as though they're enjoying their work instead of having been forced to go to work.

Are You Being Served? was a definite winner in the BBC line up of the 70s and 80s.  PBS has done a great job interesting the 'Cousins across the Atlantic' and BBC Home Entertainment has made the series accessible.",1405036800,,498,4.380434782608695

1900077,5,B0000A02YD,"This volume is another addition to my collection. Vol. 13 continues the antics of the Employees at Grace Brothers department store. One of the funniest on this DVD is the episode entitled, ""The Night Club"" and includes the series finale episode, ""The Pop Star.""

If you are a fan of British comedy, then you definitely have to get this DVD, as well as the whole series.",1359849600,,369,4.590909090909091

7994880,1,B0000A02YD,Just got the product last week. It was over a month. The sellers name is in my mind because when I reached out they wanted me to pay for a search. Now that I received it; it makes me think it was never initially sent when ordered.,1468972800,,230,3.9148936170212765

7994885,5,B0000A02YD,"I enjoyed all these episodes.  In Gambling Fever, the audience is treated to a look at Miss Belfridge's bodacious body when she tries on a red sequined bikini - unbelievable!!  In The Pop Star, Mr. Spooner looks handsome dressed as a rock star and has a voice to match.  One of the best episodes.",1421366400,,296,4.444444444444445
