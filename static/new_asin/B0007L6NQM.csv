2216253,5,B0007L6NQM,This is an amazing documentation of dissociative disorders. It will have a powerful impact on every viewer.,1139443200,,107,5.352941176470588
2216254,5,B0007L6NQM,This item is going to be released on a 2 Disc DVD 30th Anniversary Edition on May 23rd according to TVShowsonDVD.Com. I absolutely can not wait for this!,1138752000,5,153,4.5
2216255,1,B0007L6NQM,"I saw this movie on VHS about 2 years ago and I had no idea what I was in for.  I don't understand how someone could watch it more than once, or own a copy of it.  This movie kept me up for two weeks.  The images of the atrocious things Sybil's mother did to her haunted my mind and consumed my thoughts nightly.  I wouldn't go to bed 'til the sun came up.  Forget the psychological aspect og the film, forget the great performances (although the woman that played Sybil's mother is the scariest woman I have ever seen!)  My focus was on the unspeakable torturous things that the mother did to her innocent little girl.  What bothered me most (aside from the ""green room"" aka. kitchen scene), was the simple fact that this was a MOTHER doing these things to her own daughter!  This was not some serial killer, or rapist, or crazy man/woman, but a MOTHER.  That was just sickening to me.  The most sacred bond/relationship is between parent and child and the fact that even THAT can be corrupt, scared the crap out of me.  Where are children safe, if not in the loving arms of their parents?  Where is God while all these awful things are happening to children AND animals????  I just don't understand.  My warning to those of you that are considering watching this movie or reading the book (which for some stupid obsessive reason I did and believe me the movie pales in comparison to the book, in the book there is more detail of the acts Sybil's mother performed on her, but also on neighborhood children she was babysitting.)  Anyone with an overwhelming sensitivity to crimes against children or animals, DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM, OR READ THE BOOK!!!  It's worse than The Exorcist and that was originally the first most disturbing movie on my list.",1128124800,12,1750,4.507936507936508
2216256,5,B0007L6NQM,"I've had the VHS version in my collection for years and just went online and found a reasonably priced copy of the uncut 196 minute version.  The different, to put it mildly, is night and day.  It's almost another movie (and I'll never understand how the reconcilation of selves scene at the end was cut from the VHS version - isn't that the whole point?)  I've always found this movie inspiring and terrifying, but the original version communicates the horror that Sybil experiences in her head in an eloquent, fascinating way.  Now finally, scenes in the cut version make sense because the scenes that were removed before or after them are included (Dr. Wilbur's concern that she's pushed Sybil too far, Sybil's affection for her neighbor/boyfriend who reminds her of a childhood friend, the conversation between Dr. Wilbur and Sybil's father, and on and on.) It is a crime that this hasn't been given a real DVD release when I think of the junk that is taking up space at the store.  This is a tour de force from Sally Field, but I have to say I really love Joanne Woodward's work here.  Her Dr. Wilbur is absolutely convincing and you understand why this woman could help Sybil heal.",1124755200,17,1187,4.655502392344498
2216257,5,B0007L6NQM,"WHAT IS WRONG WITH CBS/FOX FOR NOT PUTTING THIS OUT ON DVD YET?!?!?!? IT NEEDS TO BE ON DVD, FULLY RESTORED FOOTAGE, DIRECTOR COMMENTARY WITH SALLY FIELD... NOOOOOOOW!! I CHECK AMAZON ALMOST EVERYDAY TO SEE IF IT HAS HAPPENED YET!! THIS TV MOVIE IS AMAZING & AHEAD OF ITS TIME FOR ITS 1977 RELEASE! SALLY FIELD SHOULD HAVE WON 10 OSCAR'S FOR HER PREFOMANCE!! I THINK I'M GOING TO WRITE CBS/FOX EVERY 10 MINUTES UNTIL THEY PUT IT OUT ON DVD!!",1123718400,39,441,4.45679012345679
2216258,5,B0007L6NQM,"when i firsted watch this movie when it came out , i had mixed feelings about the film, but when i whatched the movie now, wow! the performances are just awesome!! sally field performance is just super. the film is very touching and emotional. it's a film to keep and watch on occasion!",1123718400,7,286,4.415094339622642
2216259,3,B0007L6NQM,"I orignally saw this superb television movie in 1976.  It was a two-parter, as TV movies often were in the 70's.  Now, in it's un-edited state, I would have given SYBIL 5 STARS.  Sally Field is unbelievable, and had this been a theatrical release, she surely would have won her 1st Oscar for this film.  Joann Woodward, as the psychiatrist, is also profoundly moving and excellent in her role.  This movie is quite disturbing, and extremely difficult to take at times, especially the scenes where Sybil's hateful mother is torturing her.  However, it is important, psychologically and socially, and ought to be viewed by any student studying the subject.  SYBIL is a frightened young woman who loses time, sometimes up to 2 years of it.  Her psyciatrist discovers that Sybil has 16 personalities, all of whom are operating on a daily basis w/o Sybil's knowledge.  These personalities guide her through each tumultuous day of her life.  This film is powerful and shocking, and it is a crying shame that the VHS version has been chopped into pieces!  More than one hour of the original telecast has been deleted, leaving some headscratching moments when there should be significant drama and understanding on the viewer's part.  I once taped this film in its entirety off TBS; omitting the commercials, so I have the original film and will not watch the hacked-to-pieces VHS version.  So beware!  Don't pay $20 for the VHS, you'll be sorry!  Hopefully, in this day and age of the release of seemingly EVERYTHING EVER RECORDED, this film will be restored, and released in it's original version on DVD.  This excellent movie deserves such treatment.",1119398400,76,1645,4.927272727272728
2216260,4,B0007L6NQM,"I remember seeing this movie in my High School Psychology class,and write a report. I love Sally Field and was thinking I was going to be entertained by her acting. This movie is alarming/shocking/and educational.
About 10 years ago or so I read the book. It went into much more detail about her mother and what the strange and nasty thaings she would do, not only to Sybil, but to others as well!! However, it is a movie that has a happy ending, telling the stoy of a young lady taking control of her life. The acting is superb by Field. The movie is a roller coaster of emotions that will leave you breathless and aware.
I ran across this movie in an old rental store that was going out of business. I paid about $3.00 for it. I cannot watch it all the time because of the subject matter, but I do watch it every now and then. I remember seeing it on I think Lifetime one day. I was flipping through the channels and came across the scene in Wilber's office by the piano.  It had a lot more footage that was not in my VHS copy. I hope when the DVD is released, it will have the complete movie as it was ment to be seen!! A then and now collection of Sally Field would be awsome!! The ""then"" would have titles like ""Sybil"", ""Murphy's Romance"", and ""Norma Rae"". The ""now"" collection would have titles like ""An Eye for an Eye', ""Steel Magnolias"", and ""Mrs. Doubtfire"". Keep your fingers crossed all you Field fans.......

Update
according to digital bits this movie will see DVD daylight on 05/23/2006............FINALLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1117843200,7,1535,4.478571428571429
2216261,3,B0007L6NQM,"This version has has omitted some very powerful and crucial scenes, from 196 minutes to 122 minutes, which leaves out more than an hour of the original movie. The ending was particularly disappointing because it had originally been so beautifully and creatively done, and was the culmination was eleven years of grueling work to integrate the personalities. Why on earth anyone would choose to remove this scene is beyond me. Other scenes had been omitted or cut to the point they weren't fully explained, so while it was still a good movie for someone who's never seen the original, I feel that the high prices on this severely edited version are not warranted.",1111622400,123,662,4.867256637168142
2216262,4,B0007L6NQM,"I first watched thios movie in my Psychology class, and found it very disturbing. but it is still very good if you are interested in people with multiple personalities. sally field did an amazing job acting out the part of sybil. but good luck trying to find this movie to actually watch it. i havn't found it anywhere except e-bay for high prices.

-victoria

p.s- we also watched ""the three faces of eve"" which is also a good movie if you are interested in multiple personalities.",1108512000,7,482,4.593023255813954
2216263,5,B0007L6NQM,"Superb acting, script kept to the book fairly well considering such intense and detail oriented writing. Child abuse by a paranoid schizophrenic mother or authority figure from earliest memories literally can break a person but her ability to divide the pain to protect ""herself"" is unprecedented. Even if she was indeed separating feelings and then naming them instead of disassociating, that still proves the power of the brain to protect itself. The real person's IQ was high genius level. This case was the groundbreaking theory in the field of psychiatry meeting tremendous resistance at first. Believe in it or not, this film is more than worth watching just for the incredible performances",1510099200,,696,5.223214285714286

2216269,5,B0007L6NQM,"This movie showcases Sally Field's exceptional ability to act.  The small subtle nuance's in her voice, facial expressions and mannerisms is flawless.  Joanne Woodward as the Psychiatrist is perfect.  There has been much written since this movie came out as to the validity of the content----which is passed off as a true story.  Nevertheless, it is both fascinating and pathetic to watch and will dredge up many emotions for the viewer.  It is the story of a severe case of child abuse (which is challenged by truth-seekers now) with the devastating results of multiple personalities (which is actually very, very hard to prove and even discredited by many in the medical field today).  The road to recovery and the bond between Fields and her doctor is gripping and heart-wrenching.  No matter the truth of the actual story, both the troubled patient and doctor did exist and remained close throughout their lives, though the doctor was under fire for allegedly ""suggesting"" all these atrocities to her disturbed patient with the interest of writing a best-seller.  it's a ""good"" movie, very well acted, that will keep you awake to the emotional end.  Keep your hanky close.",1505952000,,1176,5.020618556701031

I couldn't get past the fact this was based on a true story. Do not watch this before bed, I couldn't fall asleep until 4am. I have to actually say I wish I hadn't watched it, because it's been two weeks since I saw it and it's still bothering me.",1501632000,,395,4.142857142857143

2216283,5,B0007L6NQM,Though I rarely like made for tv movies this one was well made.  Sally Fields does a great job of portraying Sybil a woman suffering from multiple personality disorder.  It flashes back at times to show the disorder was a byproduct of child abuse induced by Sybil's mother (Martine Bartlett) who really appears to be schizophrenic.  Though not overly graphic the movie gets the point across how sadistic Sybil's mother was and how each one of the personalities saved Sybil allowing her to function despite all the horrible things she suffered.,1494028800,,543,4.945054945054945
2216284,5,B0007L6NQM,The story and acting is very good but varies a lot from the book.  Also it has been proven to probably be a hoax but still a good movie.,1493942400,,136,3.689655172413793
2216285,5,B0007L6NQM,So good to have this on DVD.  The set comes with all Sybil's available artwork on the extra disc.  A must for psychology students.  Most interesting movie for anyone to watch.  Very tastefully done given the sensitive nature of Sybil's problems.  Enjoy!,1493856000,2,253,4.928571428571429

2216292,4,B0007L6NQM,"I originally saw this movie when I was young, and I was amazed at the concept of multiple personalities. After seeing it again, I am impressed with Sally Field's acting ability in all of the characters, but I'm less than impressed at how long it takes for the story to evolve. It even skirted with the admission that her ailments were manufactured, which has also been suggested in the media. I didn't remember that from my childhood. If this is the case, I would believe they could have done a far better job. If it's based on fact, though, it was interesting. Video quality was fine.",1491350400,,585,4.528301886792453

Yes, some mothers do abuse their children; but, to this level? When Sybil's alter egos gain more confidence, Sybil's life becomes more complex. As a dedicated psychiatrist, Dr. Wilbur visits Sybil's pediatrician, and the home where she grew up, both provided answers to Dr. Wilbur's questions about Sybil's childhood.",1480464000,,473,5.32

2216333,5,B0007L6NQM,"Growing up I remember distinctly seeing the previews for this movie with Sally Fields, a declamatory piano accompanying her character's relentless torment.  A better psych movie than ""Magic"" with Anthony Hopkins by a mile, though it would have been interesting to see Sybil interact with Fats.

The surface story of this is classic pop 70's psych.  Sybil's Mommy and Daddy did her wrong, especially her Mommy (the list of traumas inflicted by her on young Sybil are so numerous and detailed in brutality--one included forcing her to have an enema while listening to her mother complete Beethoven's 9th symphony on the piano) that each one would take a movie in itself to capture the horror of it.  Her shrink, Dr. Cornelia Wilbur, is portrayed by --- Woodward.  She is the strong one, the compassionate psychiatrist willing to push any boundaries to help first Vicky, then Peggy Lou, Peggy Ann.

One must really admire Sally Fields here.  Sybil is a five alarm fire, trapezing on NYC rooftops and nearly drowning herself in Central Park because she seems a woman resembling Mommy.  She proves, all on her own, that multiple personality disorder exists, numbering 16 people by the end.
Juuustt when her psychiatrist is about to break big with her new novelty patient and receive accolades everywhere for her heroism, Sibyl drops the stitch that she's been faking everything the entire time.  This is rationalized in the film's narrative as more disturbed lies from a sick person and as the unwillingness of an overly feminine woman to become the ""fully realized self"" Mrs Wilbur needed.

That was the only bit of any of this story that was true.  Dr. Wilbur had been had dosing out Sybil (who had the real name of Shirley and who grew up hardcore Seventh Day Adventist) with demerol and jacking her up into the state of having ""multiple personality disorder"".  Turns out Mrs. Wilbur wanted a MPD case for sometime.  Shirley Mason had always been what one would call eccentric, suffering from lots of issues since childhood.
What a mess.

This is, really, a cautionary tale about psychiatry and the ""new findings"" they make which can be highly subjective.  Could this happen now?  Probably not, but the human capacity for self delusion is infinite.  Indeed, this makes Thomas Szasz look good.  This has the feeling of a 70's horror arthouse movie, and at times Sally Fields transcends Linda Blair's performance in ""The Exorcist"" without any makeup.  Recommended for anyone interested in abnormal psych or just great acting, with the caveat that the actual story is bullish*t.",1468022400,2,2573,4.9557109557109555
2216334,5,B0007L6NQM,I enjoyed seeing Sally Field again in this dramatic roll. It has been years since I saw it last so I thought there were perhaps other scenes but I guess my memory of it wasn't totally correct. Still a great movie.,1466812800,,213,4.219512195121951

2216339,5,B0007L6NQM,"I need to make an immediate distinction. If you can find the uncut version of this, it is a 5 star film. If you cannot, the stars start falling for every cut made to this production. However, I have to believe that with streaming growing the way it is, that the uncut will soon be available.

This is the tv film which moved Sally Field from being a teenage tv star whom no one took seriously to an actress whom everyone took seriously. No one doubted she was a major talent after this and everyone mostly forgot her Gidget and Flying Nun series. It was a huge surprise to most people. After this she scored major roles and started winning major film awards.

The film itself is about a psychiatric patient named Sybil who has multiple personality disorder. This is the disorder in which the patient houses many different personalities within her and different ones emerge while others disappear. Field rotates all of these personalities in and out of Sybil. You believe every single one of them. Each of them is a completely different person.

One difference between when this movie was shown decades ago and nowadays is that the disease itself came under attack. When this film was made and an earlier one, THE 3 FACES OF EVE, psychiatry believed in multiple personality disorder. It later came under considerable attack as to whether it truly existed as a disorder.

SYBIL is based upon a book of the same title, which was equally fascinating.",1464134400,2,1446,4.681102362204724

And again as I watched it this time, I still did enjoy someone taking on the subject matter in this way.  The aspects of the movie that I felt were best had to do with the memories depicted between the Sybil child and her mother, and of the recovered validations from the analyst and Sybil's Dr. These help accurately portray and depict the subject matter. However, I would love to see the movie redone. I guess, this time around, the analysis, the analyst's process, as portrayed by  Dr Webber/Joanne Woodward felt disapointing. I am a psychologist and was trained in both counseling and depth contemporary analysis, and that I worked with this population for many years. I would like that aspect of the movie to be far more delineated and I could see it being done in such a way that would add a fresh riveting perspective and depth dimension to the film.",1429747200,,956,4.488505747126437

This is the true story of the famous case of ""Sybil"". A tortured young,brilliant girl with a whole lot going on she has no real knowledge of. It is the story in part,of her dedicated therapist  who believes she discovered a woman who has because of unmentionable childhood abuse by a schizophrenic  mother and weak distant father, split into many other personalities to protect herself from the horror.

Few stories are told with this intensity,because of Ms. Fields explosive portrayal of how this troubled girl becomes an integrated woman.  It should not be missed. The story,the writing,the preformances especially Ms. Fields is something that will stick with you for a long time.

2216521,5,B0007L6NQM,"Besides the ASTONISHING performances and compelling story, this film stands for me as profound or important in several other ways.  For one, it's a stellar adaptation of a great book.  Although the screenwriters invented entirely new scenes, e.g., adding a romantic interest, the street performance scenes, etc., and set the story in modern-day New York, they perfectly embodied the book's vision and purpose, subsuming several threads/themes into pithy, powerful scenes, actually improving on the book, wonderful.

Though the story of Sybil is a controversial one (the real Sybil had mixed feelings about her treatment and ""cure"", as did the real ""Eve"" of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Three-Faces-Of-Eve/dp/B000VYHSUA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Three Faces Of Eve</a>), this film succeeds on multiple levels, not only as powerful film-making but as a psychological narrative, one of the most important ever made.  As a clinician and educator, for me it resounds with many important issues.  For one thing it demonstrates the field of psychiatry as it USED to be, that is, attentive to patients' personal realities, rather than merely prescribing them meds and then showing them the door.  Dr. Wilbur takes the time to unravel the mystery of Sybil, she's committed to her patient and to the resolution of her problems.  Towards that end she employs diverse methods, combining psychoactive drugs with hypnosis, dream analysis, intensive psychotherapy, generosity, and LOVE (as did Milton Erickson, for example, as many psycho/hypnotherapists out there may know.  Sadly, practitioners of this ilk are rare, practically nonexistent today).

Most of all, few films or books better express, offer more powerful metaphors for the effects of trauma and its resolution (two other movies that do also are&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ordinary-People/dp/B0012B1C3A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ordinary People</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lars-and-the-Real-Girl/dp/B0014D5RBE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lars and the Real Girl</a>, both wonderful in general). Human beings are symbolizing creatures, extraordinarily creative in transposing their pain into baffling symbols, internal and external, thru largely unconscious, protective mechanisms, in an attempt to disguise or bury traumatic memories and their attendant pain (as just one potent example, look at what we do with FOOD, symbolically, resulting in a whole host of eating disorders).

In Sybil's case, purple crayons, panes of glass, the color white, classical music, and a baffling array of other things came to represent her crippling woe, ripe for decoding and rendering inert, harmless.  And BTW, for those who claim either that Sybil was faking multiple personalities, or that Dr. Wilbur was mistaken in her diagnosis, it scarcely matters.  The task is still the same, to decipher the meanings and function of Sybil's delusions and behavior, get to their source, exorcise the pain of the original trauma, and replace old strategies and behaviors with new, adaptive ones.

This film teases it all apart, and the ending is iconic, the BEST depiction ever of a person ultimately assuming responsibility for themselves, for their own psychological health, leaving the therapist behind (with her blessing).  The final scene is profound, powerful, and very moving.  MUST viewing for anyone who seeks to understand the psyche and the inner and outer dynamics related to psychological processes and healing, and a GREAT, fascinating movie to boot.",1385769600,2,3651,6.117416829745597

2216541,5,B0007L6NQM,Sally Fields is a great actress and this movie showcases her talent and JoAnn Woodward is an added bonus!! A great addition to my DVD library,1379462400,,141,4.461538461538462
2216542,4,B0007L6NQM,"This movie scared me and freaked me out when it first came out and I watched it.  It hasn't lost any of its award-winning power since...

Sally Field does an absolutely spectacular job as ""Sybil,"" a shy unassuming girl who lived her life in between blanking out when other personalities apparently took over.  The movie revolves around her and her doctor discovering all of these alternative personalities--including some who are more messed up than Sybil is and some who are more dominant and even charming--and, eventually, uncover the horrific childhood reasons for why they came into being.

One small issue is the way that the movie was filmed looks a tiny bit dated by now.  This is not as much of a problem as the issues that have more recently come to light regarding the veracity of the events portrayed in the movie (btw, the movie also took some creative license in comparison to the book).  Now that I watch it, I have a more difficult time getting into the movie purely on its own basis, because I now know that some of the ""truth"" in this story is pretty suspect and some is decidedly false.

I also didn't know back in the days when I first saw this movie what the professional relationship should be between a psychiatrist and her patient, and apparently neither did the actual psychiatrist who saw the real patient...and this also comes across a bit in the film.  This now also bothers me a bit, especially since I know from other sources that the real relationship between the doctor and ""Sybil"" was inappropriate even back in the day.

Even so, I actually prefer the movie to the book, a rare thing, because it is much more intensely focussed, which is hardly surprising since taking a book to the screen often requires cutting out extraneous details.  The movie portrays the most pivotal event in the life of ""Sybil,"" as her history plays out within the confines of the doctor office.  The interaction between the two female characters as they undergo this journey together is perfect and I can see why there was so much acclaim given to the actors.  They both did a great job with what must have been some of the most intense scenes of their lives.

After all of these years, this movie is still hard to watch.  NOT a movie for kids IN THE LEAST.  Also, any adult who is bothered by scenes of child abuse and neglect should likely avoid this movie.

4 stars because this movie is GOOD, but 1 star less because it might be too much for some and because of the issues with it actually being a ""true story.""

For a more modern take on the idea of having alternative personalities, you might want to check out the great series, ""The United States of Tara.""",1379030400,,2673,4.558577405857741

A good bit of the scary tortures Sybil was subjected to as a young child was eliminated in this DVD.

2216568,5,B0007L6NQM,"According to the extras on the second disc Sally Field was pretty much the last choice to play the character of Sybil. Hard to imagine considering her performance is one of the most magnificent ever put on film. She was clearly completely consumed by this character. She plays this real life schizophrenic girl so believably that its pretty much beyond jaw dropping. Sally Field gives one of the greatest performances I have ever seen by any actor, be it in a TV or big screen drama. She was just amazing in this role. Joan Woodward easily rises to occasion as Sybil's Psychiatrist, and she does an admirable job. But its Field who truly astonishes with the performance of a lifetime. If you want to see some seriously great acting you really need to see her play this character. I cant say enough good things about her performace. Beyond this point I have clearly beat into the ground, the film delivers a stark and realistic image of a tormented human being with multiple personalities. One of my relatives has worked in a mental ward for 18 years, and I have visited the place numerous times, and I can tell you for certain the mental disorder centralized here in the film is genuinely accurate within Sally Fields performance.",1367884800,,1230,4.699074074074074

2216570,4,B0007L6NQM,"Sybil the TV movie was seen by 1/5 of the US population the week it aired in November 1976. After that, the diagnosis of Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD) exploded in the US and eventually in other English speaking countries. But within a couple of decades MPD would come under harsh scrutiny, as dissident mental health professionals, and former MPD patients themselves, began claiming the illness was largely caused by therapist suggestion and malpractice.

As criticism has grown, others, attempting to salvage the diagnosis, have referred to ""Sybil"" the book and especially ""Sybil"" the movie. They say both are true stories, and that the movie in particular is incredibly powerful. Who can argue with Sybil's dad admitting on film that his wife was a schizophrenic? Who can dispute the elderly family doctor pulling out Sybil's childhood medical records and apologizing to her psychiatrist for knowing all about the sexual abuse years ago, yet doing nothing about it?

But both of these scenes are pure fiction. The mother was never diagnosed as psychotic. And the psychiatrist never met the family doctor--he'd been dead for years before she came in contact with the real women who was Sybil ( by then there were no surviving medical records).

It is doubtful that Shirley Mason, the real woman who was Sybil, had multiple personalities before she came under the treatment sway of her psychiatrist, the woman played by Joanne Woodward. Unreported in the book or movie is that this doctor was very interested in MPD long before she met Mason. Wittingly and unwittingly, she seems to have resorted to malpractice to come up with a case--a case in Shirley Mason.

All this is not to say that Sybil isn't an awesome movie. How could it not be? The screenwriter was Stewart Stern, brilliant author of the Rebel Without a Cause script. And of course, there's Sally Field.

But if you'd like to compare the highly fictional movie (and book) to the documented reality of the Sybil case, read my bestselling book.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sybil-Exposed-The-Extraordinary-Story-Behind-the-Famous-Multiple-Personality-Case/dp/1439168288/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sybil Exposed: The Extraordinary Story Behind the Famous Multiple Personality Case</a>&nbsp;It will give you a whole new perspective on this intriguing and unforgettable movie.",1367280000,5,2386,5.580110497237569

2216597,5,B0007L6NQM,"When SYBIL hit the network TV airwaves in the mid 70s, nothing like it had ever aired before. So disturbing was its content, that I remember the astonishment / disgust on viewers' faces to this day. The idea of ""multiple personalities"" caused by horrific, childhood abuse / torture at the hands of one's own mother was quite unthinkable. Of course, therein lies the controversy. Was it true? Did any of it actually happen? Much like the stir caused after THE AMITYVILLE HORROR was debunked, SYBIL has come to the same questionable end (a little research on GOOGLE will help anyone to bring the whole debate into perspective). To be honest, I felt a little duped at first. I mean, I had taken the story at face value, allowing it to be etched in my head as absolute fact (yes, I realize that the film is only ""based"" on ""true"" events). Still, the TV-movie itself is a milestone in broadcast history. Many taboos were shattered, and new ground was covered (in a medium not exactly known for taking big risks). As it stands, SYBIL works well, whether as fact or fiction. The unsettling subject matter, brought to unforgettable life by Sally Field, is a powerful reminder of television's (mostly unused) potential to do far more than simply entertain or titillate. Today, after watching / reading countless news stories about child abuse, I am convinced of one thing for sure. Even if SYBIL's (not her real name) tale was imaginary, her mother, or at least legions of her ilk, do indeed exist. That, to me is terrifying...",1358985600,2,1518,4.7320754716981135

A public display brings her to t he attention of a pychiatrist, played ironically by Joanne Woodward, who many years before had starred in another movie, The Three Faces of Eve, in which Ms. Woodward's character, Eve White, Eve Black and, eventually another woman who also had experienced traumatic episodes inflicted upon her by her mother, very shortly after the death of an aunt.
These two main characters were extremely compelling, in their combined efforts to give Ms. Dorsett her life back.  In getting her to 'remember', thru hypnosis and numerous other methods, Ms. Dorsett finally discovers the roots and causes of her traumatic break, and learns to 'embrace' all aspects of her 'split' personalities, including the two boys.

2216625,4,B0007L6NQM,"I read the book a long time ago, but never got to see this made-for-TV movie until now. Sally Field did a brilliant job of portraying Sybil Dorsett, a young woman who developed more than a dozen personalities as a result of horrific child abuse. Joanne Woodwrd plays Dr. Cornelia Wilber, who helped her ""pull herself together,"" as Sybil put it. Brad Davis plays the kindly neighbor who eventually fled when he discovered she was rather more than he had bargained for.

Early on, we discover that a significant element of the abuse she suffered as a child was related to her parents' fundamentalist religion. When she goes to her father to discuss his helping her pay for therapy, he spouts BS about psychiatrists being demonic. Of course he was heavily in denial about the abuse she had suffered.

The memories of her childhood, and the scenes from one disturbing dream she keeps coming back to, are enough to give the audience a taste, but it is pretty grim. Still, her willingness to keep working with her psychiatrist and her psychiatrist's determination not to lock her away in a hospital give the audience some hope.

I know there's a school of psychiatry that declares there's no such thing as multiple personalities. The people are just acting. Right. If you are sure this is the case, then this movie is not for you. It might disturb your preconceived notions.",1336694400,2,1368,4.739495798319328

2216627,5,B0007L6NQM,"what a great movie - in a very disturbing way. Though in truth, Shirley Ardell Mason (the real person Sybil is based on), is said not to really have had multiple personalities, its a fascinating story. i'd like to see the 2007 remake and compare them",1318464000,2,250,4.456521739130435
2216628,5,B0007L6NQM,"It's not a mere casualty to find that - during the late sixties and late seventies - the interest for scrutinizing the human psyche had seen so explored. The avidness for searching what's beneath the last boundaries of the human brain had a huge repercusion in these ten remarkable pictures. ""Seconds, Persona, The clockwork orange,The demons, Cries and whispers, Scarecrow, Carrie, Equus, Altered states and Sybil"" of course.

That decade covered convulted years. Vietnam's final years and Watergate affair redirected many screenwriters to carve in relief aspects related with this anormal condition.

After Persona and Cries and whispers, Sybil was - without a doubt - the third most compelling film of the previous list. Danny Petrie as director could portrait with febrile inspiration thanks to the presence of Sally Field who gave to my mind her most extraordinary performance on screen until this date as Sybil, a controversial woman who had an awful upbringing product of a mother who suffered of paranoic schizophrenia. As product of these traumatic and painful events along her childhood her brain adopted as evasion mechanism to adopt seventeen diferent personalities of her own. These broken pieces appear and miss through the film.

2216637,5,B0007L6NQM,"Published in 1973, the book SYBIL arose through the combined efforts of journalist Flora Rheta Schreiber (1918-1988), psychiatrist Dr. Cornelia B. Wilbur (1908-1992), and patient Shirley Ardell Mason (1923-1998), whose name was given as Sybil Isabell Dorsett.  The book told of a young woman, Sybil, whose repeated blackouts led her into treatment with Dr. Wilbur, who ultimately diagnosed, treated, and cured Sybil of a condition popularly known as split or multiple personality.  This had arisen in Sybil, according to Dr. Wilbur, largely due to extreme physical, sexual, and psychological abuse at the hands of a schizophrenic mother.  The book was a major success.  From the moment of its publication, however, SYBIL attracted a number of criticisms from the psychiatric community.  These tended to center on Dr. Wilbur's methodology, and it is presently the opinion of the psychiatric community that Shirley Mason's case history was ""touched up"" by Wilbur and Schreiber in order create a financially lucrative bestseller.

In spite of this, like THE THREE FACES OF EVE before it, SYBIL fascinated American readers and quickly went before the camera as a made-for-television drama.  Joanne Woodward, who had won an Oscar for her performance of a woman suffering from the same condition in the 1957 THE THREE FACES OF EVE, was approached to play the title role.  She declined, but she expressed a strong interest in the role of Dr. Wilbur, and was quickly signed to the project.  Contenders for the role of Sybil included Audrey Hepburn, Patti Duke, and Natalie Wood; in the end, however, it went to an actress who was almost exclusively known as the likeable star of such goody-goody-gumdrops television series as GIDGET, THE FLYING NUN, and THE GIRL WITH SOMETHING EXTRA.  Absolutely nothing in her previous work indicated that Sally Field would be capable of playing such a complex dramatic role, and her casting was controversial, but it proved a turning point in her career: after winning an Emmy for SYBIL, Field would grow into a major dramatic star, winning two Academy Awards as Best Actress.

Originally aired over the course of two nights, SYBIL runs 187 minutes, or a little over three hours.  As a made-for-television movie, SYBIL lacks the budget of a major Hollywood release.  Both things work in favor of the film: the movie has time for both story and characters to develop and a simplicity of production value that focuses viewers on the performances.  The result is uniquely powerful.  As the film begins, Sybil is a substitute teacher who is working with children in New York's Central Park.  She is distracted by a squeaking swing--and after experiencing disturbing images she suddenly finds herself standing in water, her students staring at her, the supervising teacher astonished and concerned.  A slightly later episode is even more extreme: Sybil comes to herself as she breaks a window in her apartment and cuts her arm.  At the hospital she is seen by Dr. Wilbur, who is quickly aware that Sybil suffers from mental illness.  But what is this strange illness?  And how can it be treated?  The cast, which includes Brad Davis (best known for the film MIDNIGHT EXPRESS) and Martine Bartlett, is exceptional, and the ensemble plays in a low-key, extremely realistic style; there is no bravado, no ""look at me, I'm acting"" about it.  But ultimately, the success of the film rests on whether or not Sally Field is actually believable in the role of a woman whose identity has fragmented into no fewer than sixteen separate and distinguishable personalities.  Simply stated, she is.  From the moment the film begins to the its last moments, Field is entirely believable, and as a result SYBIL is every bit as fascinating, shocking, and powerful as you think it ought it be.

SYBIL was previously available in a ""condensed form"" on a hard-to-find VHS.  The DVD release not only restores the previously cut material, it is virtually pristine in terms of photograph and sound.  Unfortunately, second disk bonuses seem slight; interviews with Fields, Woodward, and others are interesting, as are Mason's art work, but the rest is fairly trivial--and no, they do not include any direct recordings of Mason's therapy sessions as advertising implies.  The question of how accurate SYBIL is will likely remain with us forever.  Although both Dr. Wilbur and Shirley Ardell Mason are dead, Wilbur's files have remained sealed, and it seems unlikely that other evaluating psychiatrists will have access to them any time soon.  But fact or fiction, SYBIL is an amazing film.  Recommended.

2216639,4,B0007L6NQM,"Sally Field totally impressed me with her role as Sybil. Sally is so tiny! It's easy to have her appear as a little girl, but she did a good job with her expressions. She freaked me out sometimes. I have to say the scene where Sybil as a little girl and young dancing Danny is so cute. A lot of the scenes were indeed long and dramatic. I was thinking, ""Wow, she must have had a lot of energy"". It made me tired just to watch Sybil during her episodes. Also, it made me wonder how someone with a multiple personality disorder functions in society. Sybil loses her job and boyfriend. I wondered how far Richard would last. He was so funny and kind, but he really had no idea what he was in for. Sybil tries to find the meaning of love. Her mom was so skitzo and psychotic that she mistreated poor Sybil to the point of being unable to feel love. She was so scared and trapped with all the pain from the physical abuse. When I saw her mother stick out her foot on the steps I was puzzled with horror. I was just shocked. I have yet to see The Three Faces of Eve. I'd like to check that one out and watch to see Joanne Woodward's performance. Sybil gives one a sense of what it's like to live day by day as someone else. The difficulties in figuring what you did with who and when is immensely difficult. All in all, Sybil is a great film to learn more about multiple personality disorder.",1284681600,3,1386,4.156133828996283

The DVD I bought has interviews and Sybil's art work.  There is also a lot more footage in the DVD version than in VHS.  If you are interested in using this movie with students it is very valuable in many ways.  It shows the psychoanalytic approach to therapy.  It demonstrates repression, denial and other defense mechanisms.  It illustrates the cathartic method.  Of course, it is a story of triumph over the effects of one of the most severe cases of child abuse you'll ever encounter.  Woodward and Field both turn in stellar performances.

2216641,4,B0007L6NQM,"I first saw Sybil when it was shown as a t.v. movie many many years ago. It was shocking for it's time to be on television and the extended DVD version that I purchased still packed the same punch as before. An outstanding performance by Sally Field was gut wrenching and still to this day amazes me for the sheer terror and pain it brings out not only in her character but to the viewer! At times very uncomfortable to watch, it non the less makes it near impossible to look away as she transforms from one character to the next. The final horrific scenes of what happened to the young girl to send her into this crazy spiral of multi-personalities is just as shocking and disturbing to watch today even though many films have much more gore and violence...this one makes you weep for humanity. Joanne Woodward is excellent as her ""savior"" and Brad Davis is heartbreaking as the love interest who is both accepting but unable to cope.

2216642,5,B0007L6NQM,"This is a kind of movie that is likeable, but not one to watch everyday in general. Sally Field gives a stellar performance as the title character, and won an Emmy for it. Joanne Woodward also does a terrific job of portraying Dr. Cornelia Wilbur, the psychiatrist whom Sybil sees. During the movie, Sybil goes from one personality to another, while us viewers are also intrigued by the story. We learn of her troubled past, living with a mother who tormented her physically in a religious manner (if you think Mrs. White was such a bitch in the movie Carrie, Mrs. Dorsett, Sybil's mother, is far worse). Brad Davis also gives a nice performance as the neighbor whom Sybil sees occasionally. This movie is very odd, and is not a comedy at all. When watching this movie, you can't help but feel a great deal of sympathy for Sybil because of her negative past. The abuse scenes that involve her mother are so sad, and they make you wonder why she would be so cruel. The special features are excellent to see. My mom had seen it back in 1976, and thought it was okay, but weird, and I do agree with that. I heard that there was a remake in 2007, but I hope it doesn't make it to DVD.

2216651,5,B0007L6NQM,"I recently viewed ""Sybil"" starring Joanne Woodward and Sally Field and have to testify that this is the best piece of television work that has ever been produced. Although made in 1976 the film holds up remarkably well due to the excellent script and acting by its leads. This movie is still used today in psychology classes in colleges throughout the country because of its excellent portrayal of multiple personality disorder and the problems of the human mind.
 Field broke away from her TV good-girl image with this film and stars as the real-life Sybil who suffered from sixteen different personalities when she became an adult. The movie delves into the reason Sybil suffered as she did; she had a very abusive mother who suffered from a severe case of schizophrenia and edured Sybil with constant emotional and physical abuse when she was a little girl. The film dramatizes how a doctor, played superbly by Woodward, tries to help Sybil cope with her mental disorder. Never before or since has a TV movie been so honest and blunt with social issues such as child abuse and mental disorders. The fact that this film was actually shown on network television in 1976 is amazing in itself as the film is one of the most graphic and horrifying in dealing with the hell that a young child went through.
 ""Sybil"" was released many years ago on VHS in an edited version, but this ""30th Anniversary DVD Edition"" is outstanding as it comes in a two disc set. Disc one features the film in its entirty, uncut, and cleaned from the original studio print and it looks impeccable. Disc two has a ton of bonuses featuring informative interviews with Field, Woodward, and Stewart Stern who wrote the script based on the book by Flora Rheta Schreiber. An intersting tidbit to ""Sybil""; the network, NBC, wanted a known star to portray the lead character. NBC wanted Natalie Wood, but the writer and producer of the piece wanted an unknown actress to star in the piece.
 Sally Field would win her first Emmy award for ""Sybil"" and the movie would propel her to superstar status as being one of the best actresses in Hollywood. Joanne Woodward won an Oscar as Best Actress back in the 1950's in ""The Three Faces of Eve', playing a woman suffering from multiple personality disorder. Brad Davis, of ""Midnight Express"" fame, played Sybil's boyfriend.
 On a final note Martine Bartlett, who played Sybil's evil mother Haitti Dorsett, gives one of the most chilling and horrifying portrayals of a demented mother ever put on screen. Her performance will haunt you for days upon viewing ""Sybil"".
 In 2007 a remake of ""Sybil"" aired on CBS starring Tammy Blanchard and Jessica Lange and it too is an amazing film. Not as excellent as the original, the 2007 remake features a wonderful cast and a great script. That version has yet to be put on DVD.",1246406400,,2827,4.737804878048781

This is not the kind of illness I normally work with but many years back I did, at times, work with people like this. I felt for their pain but the disease utterly fascinated me!

The presentation of the illness interested me to some degree in Sybil. However, I was more intrigued by what happened to Sybil to cause her personality to fracture into an entire group within her. What horrendous load was put upon her that this was her reponse? And I was blown away by Sally Fields' ability to do this role! The energy and emotion involved must have wiped her out. I was truly impressed with her acting skills. This role was work!

2216667,5,B0007L6NQM,"Out of all the films I have, SYBIL is the ONLY DVD or VHS tape that I ever felt I HAD to own. I preregistered one year in advance in order to finally obtain the totally restored 4 hour version of this 1978 EMMY-Winning mini-drama. Up until then,all that was available was the ""hatchet-job"" vhs print,severely edited,incomprehensible and with over one hour of important scenes deleted. THIS FILM,I CONSIDER ESSENTIAL VIEWING FOR ALL FILM LOVERS AND EDUCATORS!!!

SYBIL is the true story of a woman's arduous journey to be integrated as a whole from 16 multiple personalities. The story is painful and quite graphic. Parents should view this before deciding what their kids may see. The abuse that Sybil endured at the hands of her mother is pretty frightening. Sally Field and Joanne Woodward won Emmy's for their portrayals of Sybil Dorsett and her psychiatrist Dr. Connie Wilbur. The acting still remains unparalled in my opinion, and the screenplay is expertly drawn from the novel SYBIL plus the 60+ hours of recorded therapy sessions. The film is a fascinating and in depth look at psychotherapy and a look at how a person so abused can develop multiple personalities that become ""keepers of information"" in order to protect and to help maintain function for the original personality.
The DVD is MAGNIFICENT! All of the graininess that was in the vhs print is gone;all of the original color and sound is crisp and clean in the restoration. Because SYBIL was made for television viewing, there are still the fade outs where the network would have allowed for commercials. This is good so that the viewer can also take a break and stretch or pee (or cry!),and then get right back into it. This film is SO absorbing that it is like reading a novel where every page turn means that you must move on to find out what happens next!
The DVD extras include extensive interviews with the screenwriter,producer,stars as well as the paintings done by Sybil and all of her alternate personalities. These paintings are now on exhibition.
Other than the novel SYBIL,there are two other suggested books on multiple personality disorder,""When Rabbit Howls"" (which was made into a 6 hour mini-drama entitled ""Voices Within""), and ""Lisa: Bright and Dark"".

Tales of gross child abuse play out.  When the ""doctor"" gets in deeper, you find out why Sybil has so many personaities.  Having a mother with Schizophrnia, and a father who didn't care for her.

Woodward is also splendid as the dedicated, compassionate therapist who suffers a nervous breakdown trying to cure her patient.

It certainly held my attention throuhgout.

As a movie, it made me think again at how nice it used to be when movies were the vehicles though which to tell deep stories. Today, we have amazing technology, great visual effects, but so often the stories told are so poorly thought out and generally mediocre, that I have almost stopped renting contemporary movies all together.

As far as the story told, it was interesting to see the journey of healing through the re-peicing together of old traumatic events, a painstaking  and lengthy process that , in our modern days of drug induced quick fixes and short term counseling, seems to have almost gone out of fashion. The baby was definitely tossed out with the bath water, when psychoanalytical approaches to mental health took a back seat.

Joanne Woodward as the psychiatrist and Sally Field as Sybil are wonderfully cast. I think psychiatry has progressed a great deal since Sybil's time.

This 2-disc set not only shows off the miniseries itself at its best, but fleshes out the characters with insight from the scriptwriter, producer, main actressess, and the wife of the director (who has passed away) on the writing, casting, and creation of the project.  Most meaningful, however, is the commentary of a woman who was a student of the real Sybil and who tells the ""afterward""--how Sybil went on to live a happy, healthy, fulfilling life.  To support that portrait, the owners of a large collection of the real Sybil's artwork allowed the paintings to be shown on this DVD for the first time in their entirety.  Everyone interviewed here is very careful to avoid revealing Sybil's real name, although it can be found with a simple Internet search; their reticence is a mark of the respect they all held for her as both an artist and a person who survived the terrible childhood retold in the miniseries.",1163116800,2,1150,4.822335025380711
2216692,5,B0007L6NQM,"SYBIL is a movie that was long overdue for an uncut release to the public. The performances by Sally Field and Joanne Woodward are impeccable and gave the subject matter (child abuse) and enormous amount of exposure at a time when it went largely unnoticed. Wharever disputes may have arisen since over techniques, both the book and the movie became musts for students of Abnormal Psychology at that time and for decades afterwards.

Joanne Woodward reverses her roles from ""The Three Faces Of Eve"" to portray Dr. Cornelia Wilbur with consummate skill, while Sally Field's performance as Sybil is awesome and breathtaking as she dissolves from one self into another (the movie works with thirteen of the Book's sixteen personalities).  Without being overtly graphic, the movie conveys all of the horrors of Sybil's childhood with an incredible impact.

The rest of the cast is excellent, with Martine Bartlett's ""Hattie"", Sybil's mother, in the chilling forefront and Natasha Ryan as Little Sybil close behind.

The real Sybil, unaware that Sally Field had just been chosen to play her based on her trial reading with Joanne Woodward, let it be known that she wanted Stewart Stern and Daniel Petrie to try and get Sally for her part. {From the Extras Bonus Disk)

2216696,5,B0007L6NQM,"Sally Field delivers such a powerfully convincing performance as Sybil Dorsett that many scenes are disturbing to watch. Persons with a fragile emotional state please stay away! Most people have different moods. However, it is quite unusual when each mood, talent, and fear is a complete personality -- a distinctly named individual. Like watching a horrifying thriller, viewers remain on pins and needles anticipating a revelation of the next personality and its connection to Sybil's sordid past. Some of these characters have repeat performances so, by paying attention, they become recognizable and can be called by name based on their voice, actions, or demeanor.

Something every viewer can take away is the fact that disturbing events of the past are usually suppressed or forgotten in order to feel good about oneself  in the present. For SYBIL, disinfectant, hooks, flashlights, ceiling lamps, water, dishtowels, cats, music, hands and more all become triggers for recollection of sadistic childhood abuses. The source of such tragedies is someone she was supposed to love. The distortion of emotions placed her in denial so there was a transference of seamy past events to others. Unfortunately, in later life, she had to live with all 13 of them!

As a vehicle for demonstrating acting ability, SYBIL is legendary. Actors' agents may have glossy still photographs of smiles and frowns to give directors and producers an idea of their client's ability. But for Field to seamlessly traverse so many diverse characters on screen in real time is a testimony of pure talent! Joanne Woodward is given top billing for her role as a compassionate doctor donating years of her time to put Sybil back together. But make no mistake about it, Sally Field is the real star that equates one word, SYBIL, with so much intense abuse and emotional trauma.

Every once in a while I think back to the haunting story and how well Sally Field and Joanne Woodward played their parts of Sybil and Dr. Wilbur.  And of course, the freaky white-haired woman who was Sybil's schizo mother.  After watching it on DVD for the first time in 6 years, it's even more powerful than it was before.  Sally Field is amazing as Sybil Dorsett, and she and Joanne Woodward's Dr. Wilbur make a completely believable pair in their roles as doctor and patient, later becoming more like daughter and mother.

The flashbacks are creepy and disturbing as hell, and guaranteed to remain in your mind for a long time to come.  But to see Field's Sybil  fight her way through the debilitating effects of her mother's abuse, with the help of a doctor turned friend, makes the film an incredible journey.

I must respond to lewis jackman's rather odd review (scroll down for that).  I agree, I have had the same thoughts about the seemingly unchanging time periods in the movie (an oversight?), and yes, there are those who have raised questions about the veracity of the story itself.  That said, Jackman ERRONEOUSLY states that this is an ""edited-down version of the TV movie that originally aired at three-plus hours.""  This DVD IS, in fact, three-plus hours, and is the restored, unedited version of the film with clear picture and sound quality.  Jackman obsesses over the time period of the button hook, which he says is presented by a shoe-salesman, totally missing the fact that it was Sybil's FATHER who was fastening her shoes and being hoodwinked by his wife Hattie Dorsett.  Strangest of all, Jackman somehow managed to watch (or not watch!) the entire documentary about the making of Sybil without noticing Sally Field was there commenting throughout.  Mr. Jackman, exactly what DVD were you watching?",1157328000,6,1263,5.097087378640777
2216699,5,B0007L6NQM,"I first saw glimpses of this movie when it was first on TV in `76 and I was just a kid.  I remember walking through the room and seeing parts of it on my way through.  Those short glimpses had freaked me out for years.  From what I saw then it was a horror movie.  I suppose it still is.  When I finally saw it years later, I was able to watch it for what it was: the story of a tragic childhood and how it had produced the women named Sybil, Peggy, Vicky, and thirteen others.

I never could understand why this movie was never available in its full length when every part of it is important to the story.  I was able to make my own choppy copy, cutting out commercials, that I watched countless times.  To put this new full length version in my DVD player and watch it was like watching a whole different movie.  The color in itself made it stand out to make it seem like I was watching it for the first time.

I'm not a critic.  I love movies.  This is a true story.  I've read the book.  If you have any interest in the workings of the mind and the way the lack of nurturing and abuse can cripple a person into adulthood, this is the movie to watch.  It may scare you, but that's a good thing.  This stuff is real, and though multiple personalities is a rare illness, there are tons of adults around us that are shunned because they are different, when in fact they are lost and lonely because of tragic childhoods.  There are children all around us that will grow up lost and lonely and will thus be shunned also.  With mental illness on the back burner a greater understanding of it needs too brought to the foreground if we are ever to anything about it.  If we never stop to help the adults that come out of childhood, we will never stop the abuse and neglect of children.  It will continue to be a senseless cycle.",1156896000,11,1823,4.139601139601139

Some people in our class had to leave the room when the teacher warned about some of the things Sybil's sick mother was going to do to her in the kitchen. I searched everywhere to buy my own copy but only found a poor quality VHS copy on eBay. Also read the book by Flora Rheta Schrieber (which has eerie drawings by Sybil, including a christmas card for Dr Wilbur where the tree ornament is cracked in half).

Sally Field is extraordinary. Wow. I almost start crying when she sings the ""Easter Bonnet"" song at Dr Wilbur's apartment, and she's in tears because she wants to sing it just right.

So much stuff in this movie creeps me out - the buttonhook, the whole kitchen scene, her mother tripping her down the stairs and cruelly saying, ""Have a nice trip, see you next fall!"", the dream with all those evil cats (she awakens climbing the bookcase), the purple crayon in the trunk, banging windows so hard that she breaks them, and when she would look in a mirror but see one of her young personalities staring back.

Some of the music is quite haunting...the high voices of children singing is what I remember the most.

Even after watching this, I can hardly imagine a tenth of all the trauma Sybil had to endure at the sadistic hands of her schizophrenic mother. Her mother needed to be committed and the father should have stepped up and noticed some things. It would have been better if the dr across the street had adopted her. And it's a miracle that she didn't kill herself - Dr. Wilbur really helped her a lot, but I don't think Joanne Woodward (Dr. Wilbur) should have been nominated for an Emmy.

2216708,3,B0007L6NQM,". . .that although Sybil was in therapy under Dr. Wilbur for over ten years, the movie (except for childhood flashbacks) apparently takes place entirely in the mid-Seventies? Neither of these two characters ages a bit and all the cars, hairstyles, fashions, etc. are right out of 1976. Furthermore, although Sybil is said to be 30 years old (putting her birthdate somewhere in the late Thirties-early Forties), the childhood flashbacks all appear to be set in the 1920's or earlier. At one point, the young Sybil recoils in horror when her father uses a button hook on her shoes--a device for a shoe style that was an antique even by the early Thirties.

That said, terrific performances in a fascinating--if, knowing what we do today--highly suspect story. (Recent revelations suggest that Wilbur probably encouraged Sybil to fantasize many of her personalities and that the book's author embellished the more sensational aspects of Sybil's tale to maximize sales. Everyone--author, doctor, even Sybil--stood to earn more money if the book was a bestseller.)

A ""making-of"" featurette, including comments by Joanne Woodward and the director, often raises more questions than it answers. (We're told that both Natalie Wood and Audrey Hepburn were briefly connected with the project but playing whom? Sybil or the doctor?).

There are a few small aspects to the transference and theraputic relationship between Sybil and her doctor that are more probably reflective of my place in history and hers than a flaw in movie making.

If you're a fan of movies that explore the mind, that showcase remarkable acting talent (OMG Sally Fields!!  there are no superlatives expressive enough of that woman.  one word, OSCAR!!), and that cause you to rethink things you thought you understood.  This is a great movie to see.

They won! As the emotionally ravaged and fragile school teacher afflicted with multiple personality disorder, Field unleashes a tour de force that earned her an Emmy in 1977 and set her on the path to film stardom. Based on a true life case, Sybil Dorsett had her psyche blown apart by a mother whose terrorist tactics were so sadistic that they qualified as torture, not mere abuse. By the time Sybil made it - miraculously - to adulthood, though, she had been so devastated as to manifest 16 separate personalities, each of them a ""protector"" of a specific facet of Sybil's total psyche. It's a painful watch to watch Sybil as a child endure the torture of a sadistic and brutal mother and its consequential and devastating damage Sybil carries into her adulthood. It is only with the compassion and soothing guidance of her psychiatrist, Dr. Cornelia Wilbur (Joanne Woodward) and her own strength to come to terms that Sybil manages to meld her multiple personalities into one. And making a point of bringing Sybil's various personalities together as opposed to ""exorcising"" them is a compliment to the ethical basis of director Daniel Petrie's vision. The telepic for Field is cited as her career-making performance, and justifiably so. In 1980, only three years after nailing the Emmy for her first starring dramatic role, Field took the first of her two Oscars for ""Norma Rae."" For Woodward, her role as Sybil's psychiatrist was full circle: interestling, nearly 20 years earlier, Woodward won an Oscar for her role as a woman with the same psychiatric condition in ""The three Faces of Eve."" Though 30 years old, ""Sybil"" retains a timelessness if for no other reason than multiple personality disorder remains a psychiatric phenomenon. But the power of Field's acting carries the film, and it remains among the best in her entire body of work.",1154736000,3,2121,4.861878453038674

Sally Field is simply superb as Sybil Dorsett, a young lady who would eventually reveal 11 personalities as a result of the horrible abuse from her paranoid schizophrenic mother.  Field is mesmerizing, totally convincing in her portrayal and she won a deserved Emmy for this sometimes brutally uncomfortable performance.  On this release, also notice the brilliant support from Oscar winner Joanne Woodward as Dr. Cornelia Wilbur, the dedicated and deeply understanding therapist who spent 11 years helping Sybil assimilate her personalities--she is extremely powerful and shares and surrenders her scenes with Field; the late Brad Davis as the handsome neighbor who befriends one of Sybil's other personalities; and Martine Bartlett as Sybil's cruel mother---her performance is chilling.  Under Daniel Petrie's assured direction, SYBIL remains one of the most powerful movies made for TV and a study of just how powerful--and fragile--the mind can be.",1154476800,3,1049,5.45679012345679

The flashback scenes with her monstrous demented mother are scarier and harder to watch than any horror movie in recent memory. It is astounding that this film was made in 1976. I remember how frightening it was to this 15 year old back then, and it is just as unsettling now. Excellent work from Joanne Woodward and Sally Field. Ms. Fields acting will never be equaled in this unforgettable and riveting ""drama-thriller.""",1154217600,2,510,4.941860465116279
2216715,5,B0007L6NQM,"I was stunned in the most literal sense of the word when I saw Sybil the first time. Even given the subsequent horrors some parents have perpetrated on their children (Darlie Routier, Susan Smith, Andrea Yates, etc) this story is on a level all its own.

I have no idea, despite seeing the moive more than once and reading the book, what prompted Sybil's mother to torture her daughter the way she did, nor do I have any comprehension HOW Sybil survived as well as she has. Not too many of us could have adjusted and gone on with our lives under similar circumstances; this was a house of Hades for sure. The splitting of her own persona into sixteen different personalities as a survival mechanism is not only fascinating, but touching as well. The worst aspect of all this, to me, was the total indifference and denial the father/husband was guilty of, and the incompetence and reluctance of Sybil's own doctor to do anything to help her. Her mother was a very sick, deeply disturbed woman, but her father and her doctor knew of the atrocities and abuse and stood by and did nothing.

Fields's acting skills were never questioned after this performance, my God she was extraordinary, a performance of a lifetime.

She was brilliant, but imagine how deeply this role must have affected her. I hope she got to meet the woman whose life she portrayed so well, and I also pray the real Sybil is thriving in her life now.

Very difficult to watch, yet impossible to stop, Sybil will stand as a testament not only to the most horrific behaviors a parent can perpetrate on a child, but also serve as a story of the human spirit and its ability to adapt and survive situations most of us could not.

The loneliness, the sadness and the dreadful fears that paralyzed Sybil throughout her life, until her release from all her demons, is a journey out of the darkness, and how happy we are that she came through intact, finally!

Dear Sybil:

God Bless and keep you always safe from harm and happy in your life...you are admired and loved all over the world and all who read and see your remarkable story will come away with the same feelings...",1154217600,5,2136,4.546875
2216716,5,B0007L6NQM,"Rather than repeat what has already been written about the brilliance of this TV movie and the performances - I will add a couple of things:

1) It is so great to see a movie made back in the time when a New York City location was actually a New York City location. The actors really were on the streets of Big Apple and with filming costs so low up north in Canada, it's a rare thing.

2) I don't know that the extras contained really warranted a second disc. All this wasted space that could easily be saved with a double sided disc.

3) MOST HORRENDOUS IS THE MISLEADING BOX COPY FOR THE EXTRAS. On the box and in advertisements, it clearly states that one of the extras is ""Sybil Therapy Session"" leading one to believe that we will be privy to either videotape or audio tape of the actual Sybil in session or perhaps a deleted scene from the film. Not so. Not so at all. All it is is a few minutes of the screenwriter sitting in a chair talking about how he heard a few of the tapes and how amazing they were and how it helped in the writing of the script. That's it. It's practically just a sound bite culled from the larger interview they did with the writer and given its own title page. Just know there is absolutely no audio or video tape on this release of the actual ""Sybil"". SHAME ON THE STUDIO FOR FALSE ADVERTISING AND VERY DELIBERATE DECEPTION.

It's a great film and the transfer is wonderful but this anniversary release is in my opinion, almost ruined by this deception. What is the point of it? The movie and the actors deserved better.",1154131200,7,1556,4.282312925170068

2216718,5,B0007L6NQM,"Sybil is the classic psychological drama that finally brought a face to multiple personality disorder.  It originally aired in 1976 after Jimmy Carter's election and has a staying power in the psychological community that's hard to forget.  When I was studying psychology in college, I had a professor who was so upset she couldn't get this film on DVD when we were studying personality disorders because it paints the most vivid and true-to-life picture of the disorder.

Sally Field earned an Emmy for her portrayal of a 29-year-old woman so torn apart by the events of her childhood that she developed more than sixteen different personalities of different ages and genders. Some of the more common ones were: Peggy, a frightened 9-year-old who holds the key to unlock Sybil's childhood traumas; Vanessa, who at 13 holds onto Sybil's musical past; Marcia, whose constant suicidal ideation threatens Sybil's livelihood; and Vicky, whose poise and grace step in when Sybil cannot handle a difficult situation.  This movie is based on a true story and the real Sybil was revealed to be Shirley Ardell Mason, an art teacher who died in 1998.

This is a film that will touch your heart and I highly recommend viewing it in this two disc special edition.  There's another chopped down and ridiculously edited version on VHS that doesn't even do the story justice. For psych majors, those interested in emotional drama, and anyone who has any depth of emotion at all, this film is hard to forget and definitely worth watching.",1153699200,8,1522,4.949019607843137
2216719,5,B0007L6NQM,"Wow, what and eye opener. I remember I had to write a report in this movie in High School in my Psychology class. I was not real happy about seeing the movie, but when I heard Sally Field was going to be in it was all over it! I love a lot of Field's work. I got an A on the report. Wooo hoo
Anyway, up until now all I had to see was the VHS copy. I never knew any stuff was cut out until I was flipping through the channels one day and came across this move and parts I NEVER seen before. I tell you they cut out a lot of parts on the VHS copy. I would never understand why they did that. I guess because it was almost 4 hours long and they did not have the space. If a movie is that long then put it on another tape right??? That way two tapes can hold all the move instead of chopping it up.
Well the DVD is here and all its glory. I watched all of both discs yesterday. I was amazed on how Field prepared for this role. She really had to do her homework as well. The move was not going to get maid at first. They had a change of directors after about 3 weeks of shooting the movie. Permission had to be granted with Dr. Wilber and Sybil alike. Sybil (Shirley Mason her real name) was remembered by the crew and cast as calling the real Dr. Wilber and suggesting Sally Field for the part. They wanted Lily Tomlin for the role at first. I guess I could see her in the lead but I am glad it worked out the way it did.
Just FYI, the scene where Field (Sybil) is having a ""episode"" where she is singing Easter Bonnet and they run under the piano. That shot was all in one take! Not only was it moving and shocking, but during filming, all the crew was in tears. I mean at the time people were questioning Field, formally the Flying Nun, playing a very serious role. During the auditions, Woodward wanted to take part of all the screenings of women to the lead role. After Field came in and they had the chance to see her perform, Woodward wanted her to be cast. She said ""I am not going to do it unless Field is doing it"". Now Woodward was not the first choice for Dr. W. They were looking at persons like Natalie Wood. The studio wanted at least one star they can promote the move with. Woodward was not known for her works on the big screen but for her work on TV. The studio agreed with going for Woodward. Keep in mind Field being pretty new to the spotlight.
The DVD is presented here in FULL version. It was like seeing this movie for the first time. For whatever reason, many key scenes were taken out of the movie. Like the conversation Dr. Wilber had with Sybil's father. I never knew that scene was shot until the DVD. Of course I read the book in the early 90's and it went into much much more graphic detail about the mother. It is hard to imagine a woman wanting to do what she did to a small child. It is hard for me to watch movies like this over and over again. Moves where one is abusing another like ""What's Love got to do with IT"". Which is a remarkable film but cannot watch it that often? Sybil gives the viewer an emotional roller coaster, leaving you gasping for breath. However, it is about a person who wins victory over a terrible affair that happened in ones life. Like in ""What's Love..."" , Tina Turner (Bassett), had the courage to survive and win the battle over an abusive situation.
Sybil the same way. It is a bitter sweet move that, bottom line, ends in a person having triumph and courage to stand up for the greater good of oneself. To overcome obstacles that holds one back from doing want they want to do, in Sybil's case, wanting to teach art. She had the courage and strength to fight for what she believes in, and want to live her goals and dreams. This story inspires me to cherish life, and be thankful for having grown up in non abusive surroundings, that sadly Sybil was forced to endure the abusive ones.......

2216720,5,B0007L6NQM,"If the name Sally Field appeared on a nationwide (better yet a human race wide) word association test, we would be all divided in thirds.  One third would remember sitcoms of the 60s and 70s like ""Gidget"", ""The Flying Nun"" and ""The Girl With Something Extra"".  The Second Third would remember her wonderful appearances on the big screen since 80s (maybe the 70s too) in ""Places In The Heart"", ""Norma Rae"", ""The Smokey And The Bandit Trilogy"", ""Steel Magnolias"", ""Forrest Gump"", and others.  The Final Third would be right on the border between the 2 groups.  How soon we forget her appearance in the fall of 1976 in an Emmy winning performance in the 2 part tv movie ""Sybil"".  Based on the true novel by Flora Rheta Schreiber, Field plays a young substitute teacher/art student whose battered childhood (thanks to a schizophrenic mother and a henpecked father) shattered her so that she grew to adulthood with 16 distinct personalities (all children) although for the tv film they imply 13 (based on the writing on the back of the box and the ending credits of the film).  The film also stars Joanne Woodward (aka Mrs. Paul Newman) as Cornelia B. Wilbur, the psychiatrist determined to help Sybil pull her self (or selves if you will) together (the real Dr. Wilbur served as a consultant to the film).  Other stars include bit part actors William Prince as her father Willard Dorsett (in present scenes he is remarried to a ""normal"" woman), Martine Bartlett (in flashbacks) as Hattie Dorsett, the schizoid mother, veteran bit part actor Charles Lane as Dr. Quinones, the hometown M.D. who in the present helps shed some light on her case to Dr. Wilbur, and a young unknown named Brad Davis as neighbor Richard Loomis, a young widower with a young son Matthew (both of whom become ""fond"" of Sybil before realizing her ""condition"").  The film won 4 Emmys including a tie for best Dramatic Special and as I stated above Best Actress in a Dramatic Special (for Field).  The film originally ran on NBC in 2 parts (at 2 hours with commericals) each.  Most stations nowadays if they run it, show it all at one time.  When it was released on prerecorded VHS, it was cut from the 3 hours and change (without commercials) by an hour probably because very few movies over 2 hours hit videotape (except as 2 tape sets).  Why it was never re-released is beyond me, but now it has hit DVD with the entire film restored to its full length with a second disc of interesting extras.  Whether you are a psychology major or not, you will enjoy this film.  It is as the box claims, the role that would launch Sally Field on the way to being the great dramatic actress she is now (she does comedy well too).",1153353600,54,2686,4.60377358490566

I have yet to watch the movie but I do have a comment or two about the DVD case and the Special Features... on the back of the case it says ""One Woman. 13 Personalities. The Electrifying True Story."" Did Sybil not have 16 personalities?

I have yet to watch the movie (I am waiting to put a couple hours aside to watch it in one sitting) but I did watch the Special Features (Disc 2). There isn't much there. Personally, I would have enjoyed hearing more about the real 'Sybil'. The interviews with Sally Field and Joanne Woodward were good. The interview with Stewart Stern was a bit much though. He goes on and on about the silliest details and spends most of the interview talking about himself or name-dropping. The producer, Peter Dunne, gives a fairly nice history of the making of the movie includng the change in Director early on in the film. The Extras also include some of Sybil's artwork and an interview (very short) with a former student/friend.

Why mess with perfection?",1153180800,3,270,4.254901960784314
2216723,5,B0007L6NQM,"It's a real pleasure to see the full length version of Sybil finally out on DVD. The film stands up amazingly well for a drama made for TV some 30 years ago. Having just watched it again, I can honestly say this powerful story has not been diminished at all. Sally Field plays Sybil Dorsett, a troubled and secretive young woman who has a lot of trouble keeping friends, jobs and self confidence due to her constant blackouts and memory losses. When one of these episodes leads to a hand injury she comes under the scrutiny of a psychiatrist, Dr Wilbur (Joanne Woodward), who soon realises that something far more complex than a cut hand is wrong with her patient. Dr Wilbur manages to convince Sybil to return for more treatment, and the true nature of Sybil's illness starts to come to light...she has suffered such a terrible trauma at some point in her life that her only way to protect herself from insanity was to involve into what was eventually documented as 16 multiple personalities.

If it wasn't for Sally Fields' stunning performance, the film would just be a curiosity piece about the sinister truth behind a schizophrenic woman's story. But thanks to her thoroughly convincing work, in a role that would surely be beyond many so-called stars of today, the film become a rivetting experience to watch. It's almost impossible to take your eyes of Sybil every time she is on screen. Sally Field manages to convey the woman within, even though she is hiding behind several distinct personalities. While its not unusual for one actor to play multiple roles within one film, it's very rare to find one who can play different characters and keep them all identifiable as facets of one, deeper personality. When Sybil comes to Dr Wilbur's office as her most confident hidden ""self"", Vicky, it's clear that we are watching a very different person from the timid Sybil. But as Dr Wilbur questions her, she's able to crack the outer personailty of ""Vicky"" slightly with probing questions, and it's fascinating to watch as Vicky breifly flickers back to being Sybil a few times before recovering herself. To do this once is clever acting, but there are many more personalities living within Sybil, and as the film progresses, Sally Field takes us on a tour of a whole range of ""selves"" that live within the character.

Joanne Woodwards performance as the caring and professional Dr Wilbur is as impressive as Sally Field is as Sybil. I don't know how real psychiatric doctors handle patients with multiple personalities, but if they are anything like as supportive as Dr Wilbur, I applaud them all. I really felt as though I was watching real therapy sessions in some scenes as Woodwards sounds so authentic delivering her lines. Brad Davis (from ""Midnight Express"") makes good use of a small role as one of Sybil's neighbours who takes an interest in her, only to find, sadly, that the shocking extent of her mental illness is too much for him. Sadly the role of ""little Sybil"" (in the flashback sequences that show what went on in Sybil's childhood) is played rather awkwardly by the young Natasha Ryan, but then she is a very young child. Although some of her scenes are quite good, her plight in these scenes is made most effective by...her mother. My god, I hated that woman! As this is a true story, the horrific and upsetting truth behind Sybil's childhood abuse never fails to leave me feeling shocked and angry. The actress who plays Sybil's mother in the flashback sequences nails her as an insane bully, and her terrifying performance makes you want to reach into the screen and do something, especially in the final 15 minutes of the movie when Sybil's deepest, most hurtful memories of the abuse are revealed.

I don;t know how many liberties were taken with the real story, but the events, explanations, Sybil's dreams and phobias as depicted in this film stand out as well formed and convincing enough for me to believe that most of the events in the film really did happen as documented. There aren't many things that let the film down. I would have liked Sybil's dream of the headless cat to have been better realised than it was, because it was hard to share her terror when the so-called ""chase"" in her dream was depicted by a few shots of a very obviously inanimate stuffed cat. But that's a tiny quibble in a film of this length when, for so much of the time I was totally fascinated. In fact, I would have happily watched another hour's worth of story, as even the full length version of the film cannot help but take short-cuts over some of the material. I would certainly recommend seeing it all in one sitting, although the build up is great (that horrible flashback right at the start of young Sybil on the hook), and the climax to ""part one"", where Dr Wilbur realises that Sybil's mother must have done something very seriously bad, makes for an effective pause in the film if you want to take it in as two feature length chunks rather than one marathon.

""Sybil"" (the movie) is breathtakingly effective and it's depiction of abuse is still horrible even today. For a child's whole life to be shattered in such a way, and at the hands of her own mother, makes for unsettling viewing. But the over-riding story is one of treatment and recovery, and there is indeed a welcome breakthrough as the movie comes to an end. I can only hope that the real ""Sybil"" was helped and guided back to something resembling happiness in a similar way that her movie counterpart was.",1152835200,6,5494,4.684265010351967

2216725,5,B0007L6NQM,"SYBIL is most definately one of the most engrossing and thrilling masterpieces in the Made-for-TV movie genre. A stiringly haunting energetic Emmy Award winning performance by Sally Field (who at the time we only knew as ""Gidget"" and ""The Flying Nun"" which only made her performance here all that much more enthralling), as a troubled young woman trying to cope with a life full of blackouts and sometimes lengthy periods of lost time.

This is the story of their struggle toward bringing Sybil together as a whole person again.

  The only reservations I have about this movie, is the fact that it so totally vears away from the story as told in the book that it could lead one to believe the movie writers must have just taken a few names from the book and wrote their own story.

Sally Field, as others have said really is the gold standard when it comes to actresses, sadly she doesn't seem to get the credit she richly deserves. The mother was such a viscious monster (FIVE star performance) it is sometimes difficult to watch what is done to young Sybil but in the end strength prevails. I would give this 5 stars but parts of the Joanne Woodward performances just never rang true to me. Though it is worth the mention, the soundtrack is AMAZING!

--

Update here, upon actual purchase.

This movie in many ways is hard to watch. It's exhausting. I often well up when I see Sybil going through so much torment. As a viewer I feel such pity. Much pity. That's why Joanne just doesn't seem to grasp this part for me. She is just too clinical, almost inhuman. I realize ""in part"" she must be this way because of ""professionalism""... but c'mon, this is a fellow HUMAN BEING being put through a living hell, some tears now and then would be nice. Even if she would have to leave the room and come to grips with what she had witnessed. ""Ok Sybil, you are bound, gagged, and mutilated sexually... where are you?"" Sheesh.... I couldn't just sit there! Ack!

I can't say I was wowed by the extras. It is nice to see Sally Field take part in them but it seems the writer who transcribed the book to a script gets top billing. He seems to go on adnausium. Joanne also takes part as does the wife of the second director. As a whole it is nice to see them but just about the only thing I took away and took to heart is the fact that the ""boyfriend"" within the movie was not part of the book. Which brings to light just about the only thing in the movie I have never liked. It's very awkward having the love interest have a child and it seems now it's more for shock value when the child exclaims ""That's not Sybil, she stayed home!""

I can say the extras hammered home how hard Sally worked on this picture but then again I could have guessed that much, the product is proof. Sadly, I did not hear one word about the soundtrack which is haunting and in many ways ""crafts"" what is seen on screen, much like in the Amityville Horror and any great soundtrack.

Lastly, I was a bit aghast to learn how against Sally the writer seemed to be (at the beginning). Surely those in the know, know enough to not type cast or pigeon-hole any capable actor. Could they not figure out that Sally Field could play more than the Flying Nun? That's why it's called ACTING!!",1145491200,17,2702,4.298624754420432

Woodward is so natural as her smart , capable, compassionate doctor that it's easy to forget she's only ""playing one on tv"".  And Martine Bartlett as Sybil's beastly, schizophrenic mother  -- a thankless role to the 10th power --  is insanely brilliant.  Under the fine, ginger hand of director Daniel Pietre, who had the rare sense to know when to move out of the way and let  his actors work, was born a masterpiece.  The bar he set back in 1976 remains the gold standard.",1140739200,13,789,4.6521739130434785
2216732,5,B0007L6NQM,"My mom told me about this movie many years ago, but did not have a copy for me to see, mostly because it's been out of print for ages.  She eventually found a VHS copy on ebay and snatched it up. I must admit, the hype she created was deserving.

""Sybil"" is the story of a late-20-year-old school teacher who has developed multiple personalities, most likely led on by the sexual abuse she encountered from her mother in her youth. She ends up meeting Dr. Cornelia Wilbur, who is trying to aid Sybil with her illnesses. Sybil is portrayed by Sally Field, which is one of her best performances (up there with ""Forrest Gump""). The movie is a bit freaky at times, but you also are very sympathetic towards Sybil after you see what her life has been like.

Absolutely gripping story.",1140307200,9,779,4.471830985915493
2216733,5,B0007L6NQM,"The film that set into motion Sally Field's long acting career, ""Sybil"" was an emotional tornado of multiple personalities, child abuse, and modern psychology. Set in a now distant New York, the mini-series settled down upon an introverted young woman by the name of Sybil Dorsett. Living in constant fear of social situations, she struggles to understand what is happening within herself. But when things steadily worsen, she must seek the help of a psychiatrist: Dr. Wilbur.

 The two women soon become one in each other; Sybil depends on Wilbur to help get her out of this mental mess while Wilbur depends on Sybil for the knowledge of the unknown world of multiple personalities. However, as the answers to Sybil's illness creep closer, they both suffer emotional breakdowns, whilst Sybil begins to understand the Knifes, the Glass, and the Green Kitchen.

 A horrific yet beautiful series, Sybil stands alone as one of the best made for television movies of all time.

 And now, it is finally being released, uncut, on this special DVD.

 Originally released in a condensed volume on VHS, fans of the film have been dying to get their hands on a more complete edition for years. But the long wait was all worth it.

 This DVD includes the following special features: a look at the real Sybil's drawings, an actual therapy session between the real Sybil and Psychiatrist, a featurette with cast interviews and more, along with the original 3 hour long broadcast version. And *though not confirmed* there is word of possible commentaries included in this 2 DVD set as well.

 May 23rd: year one.",1140220800,112,1598,4.899628252788104
