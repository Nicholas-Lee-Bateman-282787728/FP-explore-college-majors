8407279,4,B003W5VDVK,"As a practicioner of Toyama Ryu Iaido, it was very exciting to be able to obtain a dvd format to add to historical and practical application.  As this was made in 2010, and is purely Japanese (English subtitles), I am sure there are reasons for subtle differences in what is shown, and what we learn in our local (American) classroom.  That being said, there are many similarities, and this dvd does offer great history, practice, and tameshigiri (mat-cutting) to coincide with our learning.
The quality is somewhat clinical, yet clear and easy to follow.
There is a lack of detail in explanation of individual techniques, as what I was hoping to see, however, as a supplement to practice, it is sufficient.
As for value for the price, authenticity is there, but it could have offered a bit more in detail.
It does, however, provide a great introduction/ cross-reference to anyone exploring iaido art options.",1366416000,,909,4.896103896103896
8407280,4,B003W5VDVK,"This DVD provides an excellent overview of Toyama Ryu Iaido.  It does have some short falls, but these deficiencies are regarding the production value and not the actual content.  As a Iaido practitioner for about a year, I found this video very helpful.

First, the information this DVD contains is solid; it would be most valuable to beginners and intermediate students (but I think even people at the ""dan"" level could appreciate the information in this video).  The video contains the following: an explanation of Toyama Ryu's history and foundation; the seven original kata; explanation of Toyama Ryu's philosophy and concepts; the eight modern kata variations, including the application of these kata (bunkai); the six Toyama Ryu kumidachi; and various tameshigiri exercises.  The explanations of history and philosophy/concept are brief and could have had a little more elaboration.  My school does not teach the original seven kata; depending on your school, this section may, or may not be, helpful.  As for the modern kata and kumidachi, these are great refreshers before a first kyu test or just when you've forgotten a step.  Finally, the tameshigiri (mat cutting) section could have had a few more practice pointers: it was mostly a demonstration of the cutting patterns (basically, kata for tameshigiri).

Second, as mentioned above, the production value isn't the greatest.  But, in this video's defense, I have never seen a martial art's instructional DVD with high production value.  As a matter of fact, it is better than most.  I just had higher expectations because this video does come from Japan.  By the way, the video is entirely in Japanese, but does have English subtitles.

All in all, depending on your school, this could serve as an excellent study supplement which brings the student from beginner to shodan (black belt).  Even an expert could gain something from the video, i.e. use it as a teaching aid, use it as a refresher, use it to learn new kata if from another style, or just to add to your DVD library.",1294704000,,2042,5.017804154302671
