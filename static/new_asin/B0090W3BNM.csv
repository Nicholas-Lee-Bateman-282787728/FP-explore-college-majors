5229069,4,B0090W3BNM,"Many would say the show started to get worse after the movie. While I agree with that this season is actually pretty good, along with 4. This season has much better stories and humor than season 4, it seems like the writers got more creative with the plots. Episodes like Roller Cowards and SpongeBob vs. the Patty Gadget are amazing and are up there with some of the series' finest. This season also has 4 and 7 minute episodes which are a nice change of pace compared to the others and are really creative. The flaw with this season is that more bad episodes start popping up which kind of sucks but they aren't as bad as the ones from seasons 6-8.

5229174,5,B0090W3BNM,"The 5th season of SpongeBob debuted in February of 2007, and didn't conclude until July 2009 during his 10th anniversary bash. This was also the year I graduated from Swannanoa, NC's Community High School; and making history by being its first Autistic student to go there AND graduate from it! Just like with season 4, the whole season 5 set is another 2-in-1 reissue of its half-season sets, bonuses and all. Unfortunately, it doesn't have shorts for Pest of the West, WhoBob WhatPants (nor its special theme song), or the show's very first TV movie Atlantis SquarePantis (the only one made in SD-Fullscreen, Standard-Definition Fullscreen), that's what bugs me about this set AND the half-season sets. The year 2007 was also a big year for Digimon, for its own 5th season, Data Squad, came to the USA when SpongeBob's was over halfway aired! But by 2009, the Rugrats shebang was finally over with the last episodes of All Grown Up and the very-short-lived Preschool Daze series, just as the original show ended in 2004. But I digress, this season of SpongeBob's famous for 3-episodes-in-1-show formulas that haven't been attempted since the trio of pilot episodes, and haven't been done again after this season, as of 2014. This marvel of a set contains the first Mermaidman & Barnacleboy chapters that aren't numbered, Mr. Krabs and Plankton's history as BFFs (hosted by Patchy and Potty), Jim being the original Krusty Krab fry cook (who sounds remarkably like Remy from Ratatouille, and it's really him too, if you know what I mean!), SpongeBob falls in love with the ""perfect Krabby Patty"", Squidward being the happiest guy in town from an electric fence shock, the aforementioned specials and TV movie, Patrick's famous silly song that drove Bikini Bottom literally mad, Plankton's Goo Goo Gas fiasco, SpongeBob's dream about Jack M. Crazyfish turning out all-too-real, SpongeBob & Le Schnook trading restaurants for a short time, SpongeBob and Patrick thinking they're at camp and being inadvertent jailbirds at the same time, SpongeBob's cousin Blackjack being released from jail, and the show's 100th episode (in the show's production order) comprised of Krabby Patties being banned by T.U.O.O.F.A.T.T.A.F.A.D., and SpongeBob's other cousin Stanley trying to find his calling. Many of the episodes in the last half of this set are out-of-production-order, but were corrected in the First 100 Episodes set. And this is the final season to be made up of just 20 shows. Season 6 and onward have 26 each, including Truth Or Square being a 2-parter, uncut or otherwise. The bonuses are made up of Retromercials of mostly-bygone Nick shows plus SpongeBob DVDs, and one of his video games, as well as 3 shorts related to Friend or Foe, pop-up trivia in a similar manner to that of season 3, and several karaoke music videos with AND without the words being sung! Don't miss out on this set if you're a long-running fan of SpongeBob! ""So remember kids, always remember to follow your dreams. Unless you're Patchy, then just stay in bed!"" If you already have it, either as a single case, the half-season sets, or the First 100 Episodes set, please don't disregard this review!",1392854400,6,3178,4.99811320754717

The only problem is that Le Big Switch, and Goo Goo Gas are both two paired episodes, but are out of order. Finally, Nickelodeon is finally putting the episodes all together in one season. So much better than the split volumes.
