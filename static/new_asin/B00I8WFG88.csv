6254046,1,B00I8WFG88,was not the PBS version which showed scenes from Poland!,1428451200,,56,4.7
6254047,4,B00I8WFG88,"Very informative.  My grandparents emigrated to the USA and settled in Chicago, and in Wisconsin.  Sausage makers and cheesemakers.  My mom's dad fought in WWI.",1425945600,,160,5.32
6254048,4,B00I8WFG88,"I found the Fourth Partition quite interesting, especially from the perspective of someone who grew up in the Chicago area.  As a first generation American, my father was born in northeastern Poland and through a long chain of events, including his familys deportation to Siberia ended up living in Gary, Indiana and working for US Steel.  My maternal grandfather also emigrated from Poland with his family around 1901, first arriving in the Pittsburg area and then moving to Gary working in open hearth furnaces at the huge US Steel complex.  When I grew up in the sixties, the Polish language in our communities had faded and we only attended Polish language classes for a few hours on Saturdays.  By the sixties, assimilation into American culture overtook the spirit of the Polish community.  My relatives in Poland still long to come to the US as the opportunities for a better life are much still better in the US.
Chicago was the city with the largest Polish population, but many Poles (and other European immigrants) lived and worked in the steel industry and related mills in East Chicago, Hammond, Burns Harbor & Gary corridor.
The real punchline comes at the end of the movie; the first generation of Poles in America leveraged their hard work for their families.  Their children became educated and benefited greatly from the immigrants hard work and sacrifice.
I have traveled to Poland a number of times and the country is still heavily agrarian.  Yes, there are industrial areas in the southern cities (mainly in Silesia) but in general, farming is still done on smaller farms.  Small farms (say 40 hectares in size) still dot the countryside.  One can only imagine the adaptation necessary for those immigrants of the early 1900s; switching from hard farm work to manual labor in the mills.  If you haven't worked in a steel mill, one would find that the work is dirty, dangerous, and grueling and for that on shift work, exhausting, not to mention the immense heat of the processes that draws constant perspiration.  There are times at an ambient temperature of 100 F, stepping outside causes one to shiver, because the heat inside is so intense.
A pretty good movie, I only wish the movie was longer.  The story of the Polish community in America continued to evolve although as the years passed from the movie benchmark, Poles still immigrate to America.",1425427200,2,2373,4.875621890547263
6254049,5,B00I8WFG88,"I liked it so well that I bought a copy for my niece.  Gave a good understanding of how Polish immigrants in Chicago helped Poland to be a free country after WWI.  Over 400,000 Poles came to the US between 1870's and 1920's.",1421280000,7,224,4.186046511627907
6254050,5,B00I8WFG88,"This is excellent.  I have two and they are both loaned out.  Churches and libraries are now showing it.  If you have any Polish blood or live in the Chicago area or are interested in history, order this dvd.",1417392000,3,208,4.282051282051282
6254051,5,B00I8WFG88,"A must see for all Polish Americans.  A true and well presented view, which gives us a clear connection to our value as Poles and Americans.  I went to see St Michaels Catholic Church in the Bush and St John Cantius on a recent trip to Chicago. Had so much more respect and awe for what our ancestors built because of this DVD.",1408406400,7,327,4.174603174603175
6254052,5,B00I8WFG88,"I must say, I was quite impressed with this film.  Through my research, there really isn't anything like this film out there, and generally there is little in video and film about Polish American history.  The film, while mostly concentrating on Chicago's Polonia, starts with the arrival of the first Poles in America in 1608, and takes us on a quick historical journey until the late 19th Century, when Poles start to arrive in mass numbers.  The film discusses different neighborhoods,  South Chicago Steel, U.S. Steel. The Union Stock Yards, as well as other neighborhoods.  It brings to life daily lives of these immigrant workers, their communities, dangerous working conditions, and their hard work to establish unity in the midst of not having their own country in Europe.  Overall, a very touching film that shines the light on the hard work and labor poor immigrants endured during America's Industrial  Boom, as well as their hard fight and aid to Free Poland.

This film is great for not just Poles, but anyone who has had immigrant ancestry in their family, it's a story any immigrant can relate to.",1401753600,11,1112,4.909090909090909
8639940,5,B00I8WFG88,Good video for people of Polish heritage living in Chicago to watch.,1530835200,,68,4.75
8639941,5,B00I8WFG88,Good Documentary,1493769600,,16,7.5
8639942,5,B00I8WFG88,"I will definitely be purchasing more copies (as gifts) for family members. I think that if you come from a Polish immigrant family, as I do, and you grew up in Chicago you should definitely see this movie, it is very well done. I think it's important to know your history, where your ancestors came from, the struggles that they went through. Again, the movie is very well done, great quality, especially in terms of content, interviews, historical facts/information. I think most of us will learn something that we didn't already know - I know I certainly did.",1492387200,,561,4.73469387755102
8639943,5,B00I8WFG88,"What a fascinating documentary--highly recommended.  Came on time, in good shape.",1489276800,,81,6.363636363636363
8639944,5,B00I8WFG88,"This film was such a pleasure to watch. It was truly educational as well as interesting to see how Polish Americans first settled in the United States, more specifically in Chicago. It was very eye opening to see how much of an impact my fellow Poles had on shaping and defining the United States and the cities within. So many impressive facts were included about our ancestors which helped me realized how much hard labor went into establishing such a wonderful city- Chicago. This film includes many interviews, clips, pictures, and data which all aid in a better understanding of our past. It is clear that the creators of this film put a lot of work, time, passion, and research into this creation. I would recommend this film to everyone- whether they are of Polish descent or not because it is important to know and understand that this country was built on hard labor of citizens of the United States as well as immigrants.",1472774400,,931,4.682926829268292
8639945,5,B00I8WFG88,I gave it as a present and my son-in-law liked it as I did when I saw  it on channel eleven.,1462579200,,92,3.380952380952381
8639946,5,B00I8WFG88,"This was a good documentary on Polish Americans, concentrating on Chicago, Illinois. There are some neighborhoods missing, including suburbs like Cicero, IL and others that had many Polish immigrants at one time. However, it was done up well and is a start to something as rare as a documentary done on Polish immigrants settling in America. If you like this, consider the DVD ""The Polish Americans.""

Share this with family and friends so they learn their history or our history.",1452556800,2,480,5.0
8639947,5,B00I8WFG88,Great movie especially if you are from the Chicago area.,1442188800,,56,4.7
8639948,5,B00I8WFG88,"Being a grandchild of Polish immigrants to Chicago, this documentary is very important and validating to our family.  We recently viewed it during our family reunion. It was a hit. It tells the story, almost lost, because these family members passed away so long ago. 'Thank you"" to the film makers. I would only suggest, if there is a sequel, that the film makers include the stories of Galician immigrants who ultimately settled in Lake County Illinois; specifically North Chicago and Waukegan. As it is, it is a wonderful film.",1435622400,,530,4.888888888888889
8639949,5,B00I8WFG88,Wonderful. What every kid of Polish heritage should know about their ancestors.,1432857600,,79,5.666666666666667
