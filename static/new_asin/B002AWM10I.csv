3892639,2,B002AWM10I,"I thought that this DVD by Reality films would be much better. It is little more than a re-hash of the documentary ""911 - In Plane Sight"" with a section on the UK based organisation ""Common Purpose"". Nowhere in this DVD is the subject of the Illuminati even discussed, so why is it so prominent in the title?

This sort of ""documentary"" with more time, money, proper research and educational standards, could be very valid, and interesting, but as it stands it really is just a long advertisement for ""911 - In Plane Sight"" and ""NASA Faked The Moon Landings"" (?)

The section on ""Common Purpose"" was interesting though, but it seems little more than than a ""positive thinking"" and leadership course run by a UK Author, named Julia Middleton. The suggestion that ""The Illuminati"" is involved here does seem a bit OTT, and with not a scrap of evidence, highly unlikely?

The Moon Landings and NASA section, possibly being faked, is however quite interesting and I will try to follow up on this and purchase this DVD.

As it stands this is just a zero budget collection of talking heads, with some snippets being shown of the other DVD's. I could not give this one more than 2 stars.",1302739200,3,1180,4.604761904761904
3892640,3,B002AWM10I,I have to confess that when it comes to conspiracy theories I am definitely more of a skeptic than a believer. This film however left me grappling with some real questions as to whether there is any truth to all the conspiracy theories I have heard about. It certainly raised some doubt about 911 and how much of what the public knows is actual fact. I didn't actually buy everything presented in the film - particularly the bit about the moon landing being a hoax - but I do think there might be some legitimacy presented in this documentary. Conspiracy theorists will definitely want to check out this film.,1294272000,5,609,4.5963302752293576
3892641,5,B002AWM10I,"I really love conspiracy theory films and I watch quite a few of them.  Usually I'll watch a film while doing my work or cleaning house.  I have to admit though that The Conspiracy To Rule The World was so intruiging I stopped what I was doing and stayed glued to the TV screen the whole time.  Although I've heard a lot of information on what may or may not have ""really"" happened during 9/11, this film delves deeply into the proof behind it.  With interviews and photos, we are shown why many people believe our own US government staged this horrible event which included kidnappings and uranium poisoning to keep eyewitnesses and insiders quiet.  Why would we kill our own people?  Simple, it's a way to instill fear and obedience into the general public.  To take away our rights and freedom.

Anyone who's been through airport security since 9/11 knows the ridiculous screenings we go through.  (I don't even want to think about the full body scanners they'll soon be using.)  Is this really necessary?  Or simply a way to force us into more and more submission over time until they have complete control?  Think about it, the Holocaust didn't happen over night.  Instead, peoples rights were slowly taken away until...well, we know the end result.  Okay, maybe that's a stark comparison, but after watching this film it reminds me to think for myself and keep an open mind.",1288483200,8,1380,4.695833333333334
3892642,3,B002AWM10I,"The way the World Trade Center towers actually fell seems so obviously one of those controlled demolitions, and where were the traces of the Boeing 757 in the Pentagon crash?  And how did a 757 fit into such a small hole in the Pentagon in the first place?  If you haven't heard these questions before, you need to see this film.  It's disturbing, and will shake your world to the foundation.

Now whether the ""Common Purpose"" group is behind this and all sorts of things, I don't know.  And claiming the moon landing was also a hoax seems like over-reaching as well.  But the first half of this DVD is certainly worth viewing.",1275609600,2,627,4.504424778761062

The references to the Common Purpose group were so intriguing that it led me to research the Common Purpose on my own after the movie!  On the surface, creating leadership who will instigate peace and prosperity in our world is the goal but if the movie contents have any truth to them, a larger plan is in place.

3892651,5,B002AWM10I,"You think it isn't happening.... It's happening. And it's happening right under our noses. Question is what can we do about it? If you watched the ""Making of a Murderer"" the story of Steven Avery and IF you believe there MIGHT HAVE BEEN even one possibility of a conspiracy to plant evidence or to railroad this man, then you need to watch this.  It's about US, it's about our future, your children's future, and your grandchildren's future. Steven Avery is just a fruit fly, buzzing around the heads of those trying to protect themselves against a 36 million dollar lawsuit. These guys are talking billions and they are more than willing to take US on. Follow the money - war pays their ""wages"", oil pays their ""wages"" and more specifically, their greatest asset is ""Your labor"" - their greatest resource.  Only four times in the history of Social Security has the SS not provided some increase. I have experienced 3 of those 4 times. When I did get an increase it ranged from $5 to $14 per month. Why, because THEY tell us there is NO inflation. I can only imagine the impact those decisions have on the retirees who get half the amount I receive.  I can also imagine the same excuse is used as to the amount of increase to the working class is used to keep your salary from keeping up.

We waited 60 years to find out why JFK and Bobby Kennedy were killed. Why Ted Kennedy's political career went in the toilet. Look up the story on Martin Luther King. Study Lincoln and Garfield and why and how they were killed. FYI, the Vice President, Chester Arthur had a connection to the assassin, Charles Guiteau, and and even closer relationship to the man (I can't remember his name) who ""supported Garfield's election and therefore expected"" to be given control of the Customs House in NYC where the largest source of revenue and taxes in the world were generated. After Garfield was assassinated, and Arthur became President, he refused his ""friend"" the assignment to the NYC Customs house. WHY? Perhaps he thought he went too far.

Hopefully, if you investigate all this you may finally conclude it is the same organizations passing down to their generations on how they intend to ""Rule the World"" - ""One World Order"". Watch ""Dark Legacy"" and ""Dark Legacy II"". This was not a ""Kennedy Curse"" these were all planned assassinations. And it all traces back to the Illuminati, the Freemasons and the Skull and Bones. They are all the same organization, just different levels of secrets. I don't have to name names, just look at the Fortune 500 companies - that's where they live.

Are you curious as to how and why the Bush family supported Hitler during the early years of Hitler's regime. Do you know that Preston Bush (father to George and grandfather to GW) had his bank taken away from him because Hoover said it was a Communist bank?  Did you know that he loaned money to Hitler to buy tanks and vehicles (made by the Ford Company) and war equipment from our own US companies? All orchestrated by Preston Bush. Are you curious as to why George Bush was such close friends with Al Qaeda and why GW Bush went after Saddam Hussain instead of Al Qaeda after 9/11. And does it not just scare the schit out of you that Jed Bush is in the running for PRESIDENT. Do you not wonder WHY? with the Bush family history, this man (Jed) can even show his face in public. Do you wonder WHY his opponents are not dragging the Bush name out into the public and creating a political assassination of the Bush name? It's because no matter who we elect, THEY have control. Should we ever elect another Lincoln, Garfield, Kennedy (they pretty much eliminated that possibility with the death of John John) you can bet that the Vice President will be of their choice, and we can expect a repeat of our own history. Study secret societies and see for yourself how they operate. If the glove fits....it must be so. And so it is!

IMO, the best starting point is ""Dark Legacy"" followed by ""Dark Legacy II"". By the time you get to this one, you should have a pretty good idea of what is really going on.",1454976000,6,4077,4.537414965986395

3892670,4,B002AWM10I,"Although this deals largely with Great Britain's concerns and perspective on U.S. issues; mainly 9/11, it is a better documentary for it, I think. We rarely see what other countries have done in terms of studying 9/11 and their more objective approaches at trying to figure out how it all happened is so intriguing! Looking at the evidence provided by French, Spanish, G.Britain, and other countries certainly bolsters the true events that took place and I, for one, am glad they are concerned, because we must stick together if there is to be a ""New World Order,"" which is the only way to stop it. I'm surprised they didn't show Bush at the Grammer school as he was told we were under attack. When I saw that footage on 9/11 and the way the buildings very neatly detonated, I KNEW on 9/11 it was an inside ""Bush"" job (the comment about psychopaths in power positions incapable of empathy sounds crazy, but I have never seen empathy from G.W.Bush, or his closest cronies..?) Also, the pentagon was hit at the only part of the building that had been cleared out due to renovations, where only a few people were, but all the info they needed gone. As an attorney I was horrified to see the The Patriot Act had been clearly written PRIOR to 9/11, which further showed it was a planned attack on the American people by our own government to take away our last few constitutional rights and freedoms, and to wage war on whichever enemy they cared to blame. This is a great documentary due to the perspectives of countries/citizens outside of the U.S., it's impact upon them, showing it is truly a Global concern and crisis.",1414627200,4,1618,4.602076124567474

8360521,1,B002AWM10I,"Rarely do I review or comment on products of any kind. After watching this piece of drivel, though, I have no choice. It is such a poorly produced documentary that I hardly know where to start. Perhaps with the premise of the piece: there is some nefarious organization that has developed to ""control the world."" Elements of that organization are referred to in the documentary, but their role in carrying out the larger objective is never really made clear. There is reference to ""evidence"" of their involvement in various conflicts throughout history and in installing world leaders, but no such evidence is ever offered. The narrators worry about ""control,"" but never develop the concept fully. (Let me just say that it is abundantly clear that there are forces at work attempting to ""control"" the masses: the most obvious we call ""marketing."" Whole schools are devoted to the idea of manipulating a person's behavior by packaging or presenting a product or a concept in such a way as to make it appealing. Does this ""prove"" that some larger organization is at play? Hardly.) They insinuate that this behind-the-scenes organization is essentially responsible for all the world leaders that we currently see in power. Let me ask this: How do they explain Brexit or Donald Trump. Both of these were proclaimed essentially impossible by the news networks that are supposedly in collaboration with the ""Illuminati"" or whatever, and yet the voice of the people spoke. Are we to believe that both of these phenomena were really the desire of the ""Illuminati"" and we were ""tricked"" into voting for these outcomes, against our awareness. If so, we can conclude that no reasonable effort on the part of the masses to overthrow the ""real rulers"" can ever be successful, because every such victory can be distortedly viewed through the lens of conspiracy and we can assume that every outcome was preconceived by some higher power.

I question the agenda of the people appearing in the film. What sort of world do they envision? The last word in ""New Wold Order"" is order. You may not wish to have a single world government (I don't) but these people seem to assert that the only important element in society is the self. I don't believe that at all. If every person acted only in accordance with his own base desired, not tempered by some rule of society, whether it be imposed by government, religion, or even just peer associations, there would be no society and there would be only chaos. No thanks.

I find it peculiar that every ""authority"" appearing in the documentary is labeled ""researcher,"" ""author,"" or ""journalist,"" without any real credentials. I find it interesting (and not in a good way) that they repeatedly speak about being ""aware,"" ""conscious,"" or ""awake,"" as if such awareness must come entirely from within the person's own consciousness. This is absurd. Every thought, every decision that we have or make is influenced by the experiences that we have and the information that we gather/learn. One can not arrive at ""enlightenment"" by pretending that the real world we live in is a complete fabrication . . . unless exploring that real world paradoxically leads one to that conclusion. In the absence of resources (not provided in the film) to individually complete that exploration, how is the viewer supposed to arrive at the same nutty conclusions that the people in the film present?

Finally, if the overarching power that rules the world really exists, why would they allow such dissension to be disseminated?
