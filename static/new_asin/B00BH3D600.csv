5620984,5,B00BH3D600,I can tell they are working very hard to bring a great quality video to the fan base.  With volume two they add on to the moves from volume one.  Also the pausing and explaining some moves helps really understand the moves better.  I have started following them on Facebook so I can keep up to date on all the moves they are trying out. May the Gods allow my children to become students some day!,1364169600,3,396,4.184210526315789
