For an old film, the sound quality was good even if the action was not.  Tarzan as played by Johnny Weissmuller was much better.",1453939200,,297,3.9

It led me to assume the movie would star Gordon Scott.  WRONG.  WRONG.  WRONG.  The picture was very fuzzy and the acting was terrible.  I could only watch about ten minutes of the film before turning it off.  I was extremely disappointed, with an emphasis on ""dis"".",1357776000,,416,4.298701298701299
2699396,2,B00083B94U,"Tarzan's Revenge, 1938 film

This movie begins with a view of the African continent. A steamboat sails up a river. Mr. Potter tests his rifle on a crocodile. ""How'd you know?"" The King enjoys his music, he went to Oxford and has immense wealth as a big landowner with many serfs. He sends a ring to Eleanor, but it is refused. ""Who do you think you are?"" A rich American wants to collect rare animals for a zoo. [Note the society of that era.] The King schemes with a guide. Word of this group comes to Tarzan, and he swings on ropes. His howl is heard by the expedition bearers. Elephants bathe in the river. Tarzan swims in the river and observes this group. Eleanor falls into the water, David leaves for help. She is rescued by Tarzan, but falls back in! Two lion cubs are acquired. The others don't believe Eleanor's story. The lioness hunts for he babies at night.

The guide meets a co-conspirator and receives poison darts. The guide suggests traveling to a new location. The lioness finds her cubs, and a fight with Tarzan. The group puts that monkey into a cage. Tarzan returns the cubs to the lioness, then frees the monkey. ""The animals are gone!"" ""Why did I ever leave home?"" Tarzan carries Eleanor away! Tarzan's yell drives the animals away. Tarzan dives into the river, so does Eleanor. They swim, then rest, together. The Reed Group must move on. The King gives orders to his warriors: ""bring the girl here"". Tarzan treats a wounded deer. One man wants to warn Mr. Reed, but a poison dart stops him. ""Come back, Eleanor!"" She escapes the water to be captured on land. The men rush to rescue her. David knows a trick. Tarzan shows up to rescue the group. Tarzan is hunted, but escapes. The King watches his dancers. Then Eleanor is brought to him. ""Welcome.""

Tarzan invades the King's palace to search for Eleanor and rescue her from unwanted attention. Tarzan destroys the rope bridge so their pursuers fall into the river below and swim with the crocodiles. The Reed Group has caged animals. David shoots at an animal in the bushes and misses Tarzan! Tarzan shows his disgust. The whistle on the steam boat sounds, it is time to leave. The last scene tells how it ends. ""I wonder what the folks back in Evansville will say?""

Note the emphasis on capturing rather than killing wild animals, an early form of environmentalism. Yet it is still an example of colonial exploitation of African resources.",1336521600,,2418,4.603248259860789
2699397,5,B00083B94U,"""Actually, I'm a diehard Johnny Weissmueller fan myself, but Glenn Morris is outstanding as Tarzan in `Tarzan's Revenge'. He does for the Jungle Lord what Roger Moore did for James Bond - he outdoes his predecessor. Two thumbs up to A2ZCDS for a riotous jungle adventure with all the mandatory predatory trimmings.""",1146441600,,315,5.076923076923077
2699398,5,B00083B94U,"Tarzan Films rock. Either you get them or you don't - and you know who you are!

These is one of the campiest and cheesiest versions of Tarzan I've ever seen. But, it works because you can sit back and laugh at it while the Ape Man swings through the jungle.

This is a clear low budget depression era popcorn film - and was not made to be high art.

I laughed very, very hard at the jungle scenes and the dialoge.

It's a hoot!",1146441600,,428,4.0
2699399,2,B00083B94U,"""Tarzan's Revenge"" is a minor 1938 Tarzan feature that would have been a major footnote in the cinematic career of the Ape-Man if producer Sol Lesser had gone with his original idea of casting New York Yankees baseball immortal Lou Gehrig as Tarzan. But apparently the Iron Horse's legs were not as imposing as his upper torso, and the role went instead to Glenn Morris, who was the fourth Olympic athlete to play Tarzan (following Johnny Weismuller, Buster Crabbe, and Herman Brix). Morris was the 1936 Olympic champion in the decathlon and won the Sullivan Award as the outstanding amateur athelete of the year (beating out Jesse Owens, which immediately begs the question when did an African-American athlete finally win the Sullivan Award? Answer: middle distance runner Mal Whitfield in 1954). Lester cast Morris for this tarzan film filmed on the back lots of Twentieth Century-Fox with lots of stock footage of wild animals thrown into the mix.
In terms of Tarzan adventures ""Tarzan's Revenge"" is pretty much in keeping with the novels of Edgar Rice Burroughs, which is a way of saying that it is not based on any particular one but has elements that often pop up. Lovely Eleanor Reed (Eleanor Holm) is on a safari with her parents (George Barbier and Hedda Hopper) and her spineless fiance, Nev Potter (George Meeker). When Eleanor gets the attention of the evil Ben Alleu Bey (C. Henry Gordon), who wants to add her to his harem, it is up to Tarzan to rescue her. Furthermore, Tarzan is clearly single and able to respond to be looking for a little romance. This particular heresy aside, if you want to know how bad this 70 minute film is, the only thing you need to know is that the reviews were so bad that Morris never made another film. When the female lead upstages Tarzan, you know that is not a good sign. Watching ""Tarzan's Revenge"" will only make you admire Weismuller's limited acting ability. This one is only for the Tarzan fan who wants to say they have seen everything that is out there.",1069718400,,2010,4.713068181818182

2699401,5,B00083B94U,"I,like my brother Ace have always like Tarzan movies, We watched them on AMC until those fools took them off the air. I hope they'll bring them back on soon because I like taping the so I can watch them over and over again. My favorites are Tarzan and his Mate(very romantic and errotic) Tarzan the Fearless(I love Buster Grabbe) and the other Johnny Weismuller movies, like Tarzan and Huntress, Tarzan and the Amazons, and Tarzan Triumphs(That Johnny Sheffield is so cute in his spedo-like lioncloth). And then theres this one Tarzan's Revenge. Where this Tarzan (Glen Morris)saves his new lover Elanor from an wicked rich african leader. It's sort of like Tarzan the Ape Man except his loves an Elanor and he saves her from that leader instead of killer pygmies, but it's still good.",1014163200,,785,4.779411764705882
