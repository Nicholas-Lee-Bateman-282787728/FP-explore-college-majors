3857005,4,B0026RX2VE,"I liked this movie because it gave a ""bird's-eye"" view of culture. Few fiction writers give insight into the culture and delves into relationships of the Orthodox Jewish faith, except for the movie ""A Stranger Among Us"" and Faye Kellerman's fictional characters, Rina Lazurus and Peter Decker. It is rare that storylines deal with the culture (woman with shaved hair, ""sheitel"" headcovering) This movie mildly mentions a few areas which aroused curiosity as to the reason behind some of the customs. The movie is refreshing, not long, but has a balanced amount of romance and thought-provoking concepts and culture that makes it pleasantly worthwhile viewing.  It is a well-done Hallmark movie.",1248220800,34,694,5.252252252252252
3857006,5,B0026RX2VE,"I really have to say that this is the best hallmark movie to date.  The movie tells the story of a Jewish woman who loses her husband in death and according to the law has to marry the brother of her husband.  They decide to go thru with it even though the brother is not a practicing Jew.  I thought the movie was really well made.  Very sweet and you cant help falling in love right along with the characters.  If you are looking for a cute romantic clean movie, check this one out!",1244592000,13,484,4.1063829787234045
3857007,5,B0026RX2VE,"I missed the very beginning of this movie when it was on TV but what I saw, I loved and got the DVD when it was released in April of this year. I watched it again with my parents and they enjoyed it also. It kind of reminds me of ""Crossing Delancy"", the movie with Amy Irving in it that was released in the late 1980's. Like that movie, the characters are likable and you begin to really care for them. I say get this movie, it's one that I know I'll be watching again and again over the years.",1244505600,14,494,3.95
3857008,5,B0026RX2VE,"I have enjoyed this movie so much, I've watched it about a dozen times.

Best line: ""She will make my life a living h*ll. She can do that. She's a professional!""

Second best line: ""A mother is only as happy as her saddest child.""

3857009,4,B0026RX2VE,"This movie demonstrated, in a very interesting and well-acted film, the unusual custom, amoung orthodox Jews, of marriage between a man and the widow of his brother, in order to keep the name and family going.  Being Hallmark, it was a little sappy, but quite enjoyable as the ""couple"" out of mutual respect, learn to really care about each other and see their lives differently as a result of this unusual arrangement.

I would love to buy this DVD, but the price is much too exhorbitant for a single movie.",1242432000,84,508,4.633333333333334
3857010,5,B0026RX2VE,I love this movie.  There are so few movies out today that you can actually watch with your family. I recorded Loving Leah on my dvd recorder and have watched it at least five times since I first saw it.  I am waiting for this movie to be availble on dvd. I was told it will be in Hallmark stores soon.  Don't miss it.,1240617600,9,318,3.9375

3857023,5,B0026RX2VE,"This is a touching, wonderful movie. I was not sure how well I would enjoy it given the kind of complicated nature of the story line, but I felt like it was done in a respectful fashion to the faith in question and the characters were just splendid. I just wish that there were more movies like this out there that leave you feeling happy to have expereinced the story.

I watched this in a streaming version and the sound lost timing with the visual. This could have ruined everything, but the story was so good that I still have it 5 stars. This is a keeper!",1521417600,,560,4.233644859813084

3857028,5,B0026RX2VE,"Absolutely outstanding from the storyline, to the actors and an enjoyable thread of a plot.

Lauren Ambrose has been blessed with opportunities to show her ability of playing a remarkable range of very different characters.  I remember especially playing a special needs girl on ""Law & Order"" as well as other parts.  Acting wise, she falls, in my humble opinion, as a younger Meryl Streep.  She can play many different roles with entirely different mannerisms, voice register, where the actor is totally the character to the point that you forget who the actress is.  I have seen very few actors who can pull that off.

Adam Kaufman is entirely appealing as the brother in law who chooses to marry Leah for the 3 month period (I do not know enough by any means of the conservative Hasidic Jewish custom/laws etc....)  as a requirement for his brother's name.

This opportunity gives Leah the freedom she thrives to go to college and break out beyond the walls of the very conservative Hasidic type of Judaism.  She studies for the SAT, she and Jake (Adam Kauffman) also create a very appealing loving chemistry.

The other aspect I liked for a change is that the girlfriend/fiance who encourages him to learn more about his brother and honestly is very understanding about bringing Leah back for three months.  She is not a shrew or hateful or mean spirited.  It seems that Jake mentions something about he really wasn't interested in marrying her anyway (Just kind of a one-liner to explain his view).  She sees Leah only once and is gracious.  Mercedes Ruehl plays Jake's mother and shows up at the beginning and at the end--a much smaller part than Susie Essman as Leah's mother.  Yes, she plays many of the Jewish mother stereotypes but there is a richer depth to her character as the movie progresses.

Many of the ""Hallmark Hall of Fame Gold Crown"" productions have been extremely well done.  They have high production values and appealing stories that do not always follow the Hallmark cookie cutter movies they show on Saturday and Sundays.",1518220800,4,2049,4.808571428571429
3857029,5,B0026RX2VE,"This is a wonderful movie. The only  problem was that I was not able to open the special features section, and not able to see  how the movie was made etc. The movie itself ran great, but I wanted to see the sections that showed how the movie was made. I reached out to the initial
Amazon seller I got the DVD from, but got no answers except to reach out to Hallmark. I then bought the DVD on Ebay, thinking that the first one may have been pirated. But same problem!!  I called Hallmark, and was not given any answers as well.. I then reached out to another seller on Amazon, who was kind enough to test her DVD. She figured it out!!!!. THIS DVD PLAYS PERFECTLY IN ALL AREAS WHEN USING A DVD PLAYER AND A TV. BUT IT DOES NOT DO SO WHEN USING A PC COMPUTER OR LAPTOP.  IF YOU USE EITHER OF THOSE, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO OPEN UP THE SPECIAL FEATURES SECTION. YOU WILL ONLY BE ABLE TO WATCH THE MOVIE.  PLEASE BE AWARE OF THIS.",1517702400,4,926,4.010869565217392

3857074,4,B0026RX2VE,"It has potential to be a sweet movie, but I think it gives non-Jews a wrong idea on Jewish people. I am Jewish and I have never heard of this law of marrying your brother-in-law if your Husband Passes away. Perhaps it is a old traditional law still practiced in some small sect of Hasidic Jews? I don't know, but I think it is odd none the less. In the times of Moses, this probably was a good idea, but not in 2017.  Other than that, the movie is sweet and a good story.",1497398400,,471,4.01063829787234

3857084,5,B0026RX2VE,"This movie is one that I watched over and over on Hallmark. Not as formulaic as others on the channel.

HIGHLY recommend this and about 6 others that Hallmark has done are some of my top 30 movies that I've ever watched. I'm 70. So that's a LONG list, since during my life, the earlier part of it anyway, there were MANY great movies. But this movie stayed with me and resonates with me still today.

I love this movie and think Lauren Ambrose, who is a brilliant actress, magnificently captured Leah's character, especially Leah's ""softening"" as love comes into her life.

3857203,5,B0026RX2VE,"For a review of the film (which I love) feel free to read any of the wonderful reviews online. This is specific to this DVD release. For the record, Hallmark mislabeled this release as fullscreen and, consequently, so did Amazon. This is, fortunately for us fans, the actual honest-to-goodness, original, widescreen version. For some reason, even the Hallmark official store has this labeled as ""fullscreen"" and it is labeled pretty much everywhere online as 4:3 fullscreen. I checked the images at select moments (though it was obvious on first viewing that it is widescreen) against the clips of the program found in the special features on the DVD, which are in fullscreen, as well as the version I taped off TV back in the day, which was widescreen but slightly zoomed and cropped by the network on airing, and this version has more visual data (more hair on top of the head at the top of the screen or height in buildings that are cut off at the second floor and more arm at the lower part or leg or, for that matter, whatever people are carrying down at the bottom of the screen). This added footage gives the film a more cinematic feel as it was beautifully shot in widescreen (full widescreen television-sized widescreen, 1:78:1, not theatrical 2:35:1 with black bars at the top and bottom). The resolution is standard for DVD but the transfer is of good quality with good color and grain, not the low quality you get from highly compressed EchoBridge style releases or multi-film single-DVD releases. This is a lovely little film in widescreen on a high quality DVD. Good luck in making your choice and enjoy.",1429142400,6,1618,4.74113475177305

3857213,1,B0026RX2VE,"I have never written a bad review in my life, but I bought this DVD at what I consider a ridiculous price to keep from fast forwarding through tons of commercials on a taped copy.  Unlike other complaints, the DVD showed up in one piece and, as expected, all the commercials had been removed. What wasn't expected was an important section of the movie had been cut out as well.

As a result, the story not only lost a lot of it's quiet charm, but left a hole in the story line that will probably leave first time viewers trying to figure out what just happened and repeat viewers feeling cheated. To me, the DVD is totally worthless and might as well be thrown away since it's far easier to keep fast forwarding through commercials and enjoy the ""whole"" movie than get angry watching the butchered version. To say I feel robbed is an understatement and I will never buy anything from Hallmark again.",1425081600,8,899,4.475609756097561

It has been painful, boring, lonely, depressing.
Loving Leah came on television, so without anything else to do, I watched it.
And I have watched it 6 times in the past two weeks.
Just what I needed! I loved the story, the characters, the ending.
It was such an Awwww story.
I don't know much about Jewish customs and Hasidic Jews.
For all those who say this could never happen, no Hasidic Jewish woman
would ever visit a Reform Jewish community or swim or change her way
of dress or shake hands with a man, etc. This movie isn't making light
of a religion or Jewish customs or beliefs. As Leah said, ""The way you live your
life is between you and Him"". But don't rain on my parade! The intent of the movie
Was never to insult or to ridicule or belittle Judaism. It's a LOVE STORY!! And I
so LOVED IT! It lifts my mood, especially at this time, makes my smile, brightens my
day and so entertains me.",1421193600,4,974,4.27027027027027
3857226,5,B0026RX2VE,"I'm a very religious Reform Jew, and I thought this movie was awesome. They got every detail right, from not making the Hasidic Jews creepy or off-putting or rude to the more secular Jews in the story (because this happens way too often--they are portrayed as caricatures rather than real people,) to tiny things like when she lights the shabbat candles she doesn't blow the match out, the stools were perfect when they were sitting shiva, etc. As a Jew, it was so neat to see a movie that reflects my culture and faith done right.

The story was also great, very engaging, and sweet. I thought that while a lot of Orthodox Jews might not appreciate the move of Leah from what I saw as Hasidic to probably a more Modern Orthodox observance, it was very realistic and done very tastefully. Just a great movie. I'll watch it again.

The ONLY thing that stuck out to me was that when her mom discovered her nightgown in the bedroom, really this shouldn't have raised a flag to her. As Orthodox Jews, Leah and Daniel would very surely be practicing taharath hamishpacha (rules of family purity,) so she would be sleeping in a different bed for half of every month anyway. This was kind of a ""mistake"" in the story, but otherwise I found nothing else to be inaccurate.  :-)",1420934400,4,1268,4.528384279475983

3857269,1,B0026RX2VE,"Loving Leah is a wonderful movie. I watched it twice on the Hallmark Channel, which is why I bought the DVD. Unfortunately the disc they sent me is defective. It freezes, skips, and pixilates so much as to make it unwatchable. It came wrapped and sealed in its original packaging, so it has to be a manufacturing problem.",1402185600,7,321,4.551724137931035

3857273,5,B0026RX2VE,"Leah became newly widowed at the beginning of this movie. To a non-orthodox Jew this would not seem complicated. She was young and would probably be able to remarry. COMPLICATIONS! In the Othodox world, a leverite marriage could be required! In the ceremony to refuse the marriage his brother would have to deny that his brother had not existed.",1401062400,,345,4.864406779661017
3857274,5,B0026RX2VE,"Tender love story appropriate for all ages.

3857278,5,B0026RX2VE,I love these movie the first time I saw the movie.  I had to have the movie for my collection.  This is like how my husband and I were when we met.,1397433600,,147,3.5625
3857279,5,B0026RX2VE,"I could watch this movie over and over again because it tells a beautiful story of love and of religion...and honoring a husband's death.  You get the history of a Jewish family and their rituals along with the modern day love.  It is a story I want everyone who is curious about the Jewish faith and their laws in modern day New York.  I love the actors, who carry the story out very well.",1396915200,,390,4.243243243243243
3857280,5,B0026RX2VE,"Good story, well told. I'm not knowledgeable on the Jewish religion, I hope anyone of that faith thought it was good as well. I appreciated the moral of the story, dealing with a death in family and dealing with your faith in a modern world. My 11 year old niece loved the movie so I got her a copy. I just wish it was wide screen. It is widescreen when it airs on the hallmark channel so not sure why the DVD movie isn't. I seen a review where they statd things on tv weren't in the DVD. On the movie Smooch (widescreen, I think the description may not say that but it is), another good story, there were scenes in the DVD that weren't on TV, so I'll have to check that out for Loving Leah, may be since it is not widescreen that they cropped it for time also. In the end if they release the movie again only this time in widescreen, I'd buy it again, it's that good. Hallmark most often have their movies priced too high. This one I got around $20 which is a little high but in the ok range because of how good the movie is, I would still get it again.",1396051200,2,1054,4.023809523809524

3857284,5,B0026RX2VE,This is a story about how people who don't intend for something wonderful to happen stumble into it.  My wife loves this movie and watches it over and over.  Its very interesting and also informative.  It brings up old Jewish tradition and by watching you learn about something that happened thousands of years ago.  Very strong story line with a loving theme.  Great movie.,1394064000,,374,4.78125

3857287,4,B0026RX2VE,It is a great movie about two different people who find middle ground. But it is too expensive for the movie. Unfortunately I could not find it anywhere else.,1392595200,,158,4.482758620689655
3857288,5,B0026RX2VE,This is one of my favorite films from Hallmark. Faith is bound up with love and the right partner. I found that in looking up the actrices that the mother figure for Leah in real life is rather harsh in joking around. She is a good actor and believable in the film but looking her up on line ruined her image. I still love this film.,1392508800,,333,4.0606060606060606
3857289,5,B0026RX2VE,I have watched this movie countless times.  I love the simplicity of the story. The actors are great.  It is not a Jewish movie.  It is a love story with Jewish characters.  I'm Catholic and totally relate!,1392249600,,206,4.486486486486487
3857290,5,B0026RX2VE,"I loved this movie when I saw it on Hallmark.  I couldn't wait to purchase it and was so excited when I saw that  it was available on DVD..  However, when I watched the first one, it had five places where the DVD hesitated for several seconds.  Nor a tragedy, but inconvenient.  When I watched it the second time, it froze close to the end, and I could not get it to eject, go forward, backward, or move at all.  After a number of tries, I finally managed to get it to eject.  I returned it and ordered another.  I have now watched it three times, and so far, I have had no problems at the end.  However, this DVD, like the first, hesitates in five separate places.  I'm not happy about that, but I don't want to go through the trouble of returning another DVD and I don't think it's fare for Amazon to have to go through all that again.  The five places don't detract enough froml this absolutely delightful movie.  I love every moment of it.",1391731200,2,943,4.206703910614525
3857291,5,B0026RX2VE,I love this movie...It is so Jewish...The old blending with the new ways. Orthodox with more modern observant. Leah is so pure. You can see how easy it would be to fall in love with her.,1390521600,,186,4.194444444444445

3857293,4,B0026RX2VE,"Loving Leah is a funny and sometimes serious story that leaves you feeling good at the end. Sure, it may be predictable, but the story line was very interesting with the amount of Jewish culture and traditions that most of us are not exposed to. Overall, a Great Movie for the whole family.",1390176000,2,290,4.490566037735849
3857294,5,B0026RX2VE,"Too often these days movies focus on foul language, graphic sex scenes, and anti-religious views to attract audiences. ""Loving Leah"" uses none of these devices and it doesn't have to: it tells a beautiful love story, funny yet at the same time deeply spiritual. I have watched the movie five times and have recommended it to many, many friends.",1388707200,2,344,4.8474576271186445
3857295,5,B0026RX2VE,"I really enjoyed the movie. It was a good escapist romance and I quite enjoyed the characters and overall plot. Lauren Ambrose was very sweet and touching as Leah, and her character development was quite entertaining. It was very pleasant watching Leah adapt to her 'new' surroundings and situation, and gradually fall in love with Jake, her nominal husband, in spite of their differences.

There were some things that I find unbelievable however. The levirate marriage tradition (yibbum) is now largely obsolete even among the Orthodox community. The purpose of the levirate marriage was to produce an heir for the deceased brother, so for the surviving brother to propose a 'show marriage' in name only, while he continued a relationship with his girlfriend, would not fulfill the biblical mandate, and would not be likely to be accepted by an observant Orthodox widow. And the widow has the right to reject the proposed marriage. I also question whether the Beit Din of Orthodox Rabbis would not have delved into Jake's motives for marrying the widow, since levirate marriage is now virtually unheard of. European Jewish Rabbis essentially banned yibbum, since the few men who went forward with it did so only either if the widow was particularly beautiful, or the brother left a large estate - both unacceptable. And Jake would only have to renounce his obligation to provide an heir for his brother - not renounce the brother himself.

I seriously doubt whether Leah would have doffed her wig for the formal party Jake invited her to, after Jake and his girlfriend broke up. Orthodox women only show their hair to their spouse and immediate family. While she might have let Jake see her hair at that point, I really doubt she'd have gone out in public that way. In one sense, letting Jake see her natural hair would be a way of saying Leah recognized him as a true husband, not a 'show' husband - which was sweet and touching - though Jake's character might not have realized the implications. And don't get me started on Jake and Leah sharing a bed, at the point they did - even with pillows between them.

Still the movie and emotions were very touching, sweet, and pleasant, and it was fun watching Leah and Jake slowly realize they were falling in love with each other.",1388534400,,2278,4.791348600508906
3857296,5,B0026RX2VE,"I couldn't be more pleased with this movie!  It gave me insight into a culture and religion I didn't know much about.  The story was beautiful.  You could feel the emotions underlying the evolving relationship between Leah and Jake.  I loved that there could be a romantic movie without bad language, nudity or crude situations.  The secondary characters (Leah's mother and sister and Jake's mother) added so much to the story.  I can't wait to watch it again and again.",1388275200,3,470,4.8125
3857297,5,B0026RX2VE,It is well written and we'll acted. I really like this movie.  The story is sweet and had a great ending.,1388188800,,105,4.0
3857298,5,B0026RX2VE,"Really enjoyed this, good entertainment, great chick flick, happy ending.  Take your mind off your worries and watch a young woman standing strong in her beliefs be blessed with the desire of her heart.",1388016000,2,202,4.9411764705882355
3857299,5,B0026RX2VE,"As someone of non-Jewish faith (for any religious faith for that matter), I found this movie extremely interesting just from an ""educational"" point of view. I know a lot about many different faiths, and know the basis for this story well (Levirate marriage).
At first thought, you might think- eww, marry her brother-in-law?! But honestly the story develops so very sweetly. Jake rediscovers his heritage/culture through Leah and Leah is free to explore her dreams with Jake.
The conflict that Jake has with himself in loving Leah and feeling that he's betraying his brother's memory by doing so was very well acted. Leah came into her own, without losing her principals, and I loved that. In a lot of movies where you see the awkward girl come out of her shell, she ends up turning into a bit of a wild child for a bit, but this kept things very balanced to allow for them to develop honestly into a love between them both.
You felt the true devotion that Jake had to his brother from the start of the film, not wanting to deny his existence.

This movie is one you might need tissues at hand, as it gets very emotional. Lauren Ambrose is so sweet and plays her part as Leah very well. She's sweet, demure, but stubborn and determined. Adam Kaufman is wonderful. He emoted so much just in his eyes before he even spoke that at some points of the movie dialog wasn't even needed, you could read it in his face. Perfectly cast!! Very heartwarming.

I loved the touches here and there of humor as well. Leah's mother and sister Esther, Jake's friend at work, and even a much more minor character (but unforgettably funny) an Orthodox elderly woman who talks a bit too loudly at the funeral of Leah's husband. I recorded this movie off the Hallmark Channel and have had it on my DVR for months, I have decided I *need* this on DVD! Absolutely give this movie a look, it's great.",1386288000,2,1875,4.528023598820059

Now, I know everything that is going to happen and what the characters are going to say....but I don't care.  I JUST LOVE ""Loving Leah"".  All the actors are spot on in their particular roles.

  It has a wonderful cast and I would love to see handsom Adam Kaufman in more romantic movies.
  The whole cast was wonderful.

  I thought the purchase price for the DVD was expensive but I wanted the movie.  Almost bought it
  from Hallmark but their promotion included $500 gift certificate from Rival Entertainment and that turned
  me off.  I dislike those gimmicks.  Patricia Rubenstein Pincus, Philadelphia, Pa. 19114",1373587200,,638,4.526785714285714

She accomplished with a facial expression more than most seasoned actors can. To be honest, most of her performance was based on facial and vocal expressions!

Another significant part was left completely out. The movie depicts her placing (forgive me) something to kiss upon the door facing. She explained why she put it there, etc. These parts were totally nixed.

Even on a 2l inch screen the lumps stick out a mile and on my 60 inch screen you can't seem to see anything else.

3857372,5,B0026RX2VE,"Loving Leah is EXCELLENT! It is one of the Hallmark Hall of Fame movies that I have watched over again! It is a wonderfvul family film or just when you want to relax and watch a wonderful film! Loving Leah is a beautifully acted and excellently directed story that moves quickly and shows a couple growing in their Love through Faith beginning with Responsibility and developed by Romance. The BEST thing about this movie (for me) is that the actors are expressing their lines through their facial expressions. Watching the movie is watching it unfold in their eyes and faces. It is absolutely wonderful! This is a love story that truly capture you with sensitivity that is both deeply feminine and completely masculine from the perspective of both the husband and wife and family. The plot combines the Biblical Jewish religious tradition of a childless wife who becomes a widow being married by the closest next of kin who is to give her children to raise up an heir for the deceased relative. The two Jewish brothers are best friends and when the elder brother leaves for school and becomes a traditional, conservative rabbi, he gives he and his younger brother duplicate special religious medallions that each of them will keep to protect them and to keep them close in heart. They pray together that they will be there for each other ""no matter what."" The younger brother becomes a gifted medical surgeon who is not at all religious, living in Washington DC, and who is dating a beautiful doctor who is planning their marriage. The elder brother, married and a rabbi in Bronx, NY, dies leaving a childess wife. The younger brother attends the funeral and is informed that the tradition of the next of kin marrying a childless wife is not enforced and that if he and the widow wish they can be released from this practice by going through a Jewish ceremony. As they are completing the releasing ceremony the final step is to state that in the eyes of the man his brother never existed, because his btoher has left no child to carry on his name and his name will cease to exist with his death. The man notices the widow is wearing the medallion of his brother that he also has. He remembers his deep love and devotion to his brother and their pledge to be there for each other ""no matter what"" and he cannot deny the existence of his deeply loved brother. He offers to marry the widow and they can lead separate lives. He will continue with his medical career and marriage. She can go to school and live in the city with him. They plan to later annul the marriage. The widow agrees, and they marry. As the story unfolds with the man and the woman, there is a delicate and yet profoundly deep love that begins to grow in their hearts for each other as they try to pursue their lives separately. The wife pursues her faith and home and worships God in a nearby synagogue while following her dream of her education. The husband pursues his cardio-surgical medical career. The man (who is a masculine real man) and the woman (who is a truly feminine real woman) realize their love for each other when the woman's mother arrives unplanned for a visit and they work together to present a picture of a true marriage and not separate lives. The sensitive and yet powerful facial expressions are beautiful as their love blossoms, grows and ultimately brings their marriage ""in name only"" into the beauty of a true love and full marriage of two hearts and souls. The story ends wonderfully and is believable and delightful throughout. Absolutely wonderful movie of Love, Faith, Romance, Responsibility! Highly recommended.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Loving-Leah-Hallmark-Hall-of-Fame-Gold-Crown-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B0026RX2VE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Loving Leah: Hallmark Hall of Fame Gold Crown Collector's Edition</a>",1326585600,2,3866,4.9583975346687215

3857374,5,B0026RX2VE,"This is a contemporary movie about a Jewish cardiologist from D.C. Jake whose brother Benjamin, an orthodox rabbi from New York dies leaving behind a childless widow.  According to Deuteronomy 25:5-10 the deceased's nearest relative is to take the widow and raise a seed to him.  This law, which is called the levirate law of marriage is also a foundation for the biblical story of Ruth.

Jake is not a religious Jew and does not really have a clue about Jewish law, ceremonies or traditions.  So when he's approached by the rabbis about either marrying his sister-in-law Leah or denouncing his brother's existence, he's rather caught off guard.  But in any case he's not ready to denounce the existence of his older brother who was his childhood hero growing up and to whom Jake looked up to so much until Benjamin moved out.  He just can't do it.  So despite the fact that he's about to get engaged to someone else, he agrees to ""marry"" his brother's widow Leah.  The agreement Jake and Leah strike is to have her live with him in D.C. as if they were married.  He figures once they're away they'll figure it out and she can then live on her own and do whatever she'd like.  So to the surprise of everyone, they ask the rabbis to marry them and get on their way.

Back in D.C. Jake sets up room for Leah in his apartment and then tries to explain it to his girlfriend, who's obviously not very understanding.  However, Jake goes on living his busy life of a single cardiologist, being hardly home at all.  Leah in the mean time, as a good orthodox Jewish wife tries to make the apartment a good and welcoming home -- even though she understands that Jake has a life of his own and a girlfriend, she tries to cook and clean up, looking forward to have Jake come home for dinner and a chat and enjoy her cooking.  But he never shows up.  So she starts exploring the neighborhood to kill some time during the day and finds a Reformed synagogue with a female rabbi where she finds friendship and comfort despite the fact that the reformed Jews are the polar opposite of orthodox Jews.

Leah's discussions with the female rabbi bring up an interesting and humorous flop that the movie producers obviously did not catch.  After hearing Leah's story the lady rabbi (played by a Christian actress) tries to relate to Leah and tells her that when she was young she frequently broke the Sabbath by ""going to the movies on Sundays."" Oops.

Anyway, by and by Leah and Jake starting to like each other and after a visit by Leah mother and several confrontations between Jake and his girlfriend, Leah and Jake fall in love.

It's a nice and touching story and a rare find these days.  Lauren Ambrose, actress playing Leah does a fantastic job!  Her performance is one of those terrific ones deserving serious credit.  Besides her performance, I like the fact that the story focuses on keeping one's faith despite adverse circumstances.  Even when away from her orthodox community, Leah continues to hold on to her faith and traditions and tries to awaken it in Jake.  In many movies today, the believer often abandons his or her faith to be ""happy"" with someone else on the outside, which is a wrong message in my opinion.  So I applaud the fact that this movie sends the right message.

The thing that I think is weak about the movie is Jake's character.  He seems to be so ambivalent and shallow about his emotions.  Instead of being torn he simply likes Leah when he's with her and then likes his girlfriend when she's around....  There does not seem to be any internal tension one would expect.  Anyway, I think that this is where the story could have been developed better and would have added to the overall quality.  But I would still highly recommend the movie to anyone as it is a very nice, touching and enjoyable story.",1313020800,3,3818,4.538011695906433

3857377,5,B0026RX2VE,"Lauren Ambrose delivers a poignant, letter-perfect performance in the absorbing, if sometimes sentimental, Hallmark film, ""Loving Leah"". The film boasts all around fine acting, but it is Ambrose who truly shines.

She dives into her character of a recently widowed, orthodox Jewish woman and, like Streep, becomes her- body and soul. Leah is looking for love and personal fulfillment, but she is out of her element, away from her family and community and far from the familiar. Via Ambrose's subtle yet effective movements, expressions, and body language, she creates a multi-layered, complex character that could have been a cardboard cliche. Instead, we feel her loneliness, her awkwardness, her pain and finally, her joy.

Ambrose is given strong support by Susie Essman, playing her overbearing, yet sympathetic mother and Mercedes Ruehl, who makes a large impression even in a small role. Adam Kaufman is also fine as her reluctant ""husband"" and he and Ambrose have wonderful on screen chemistry.

""Loving Leah"", although steeped in a particular culture and milieu, has enormous universal appeal. The story concerns a woman's search for identity and her place in the world. You need not be Jewish to relate to this theme. The superb cast make ""Loving Leah"" a memorable film.",1294185600,5,1279,5.229268292682927

3857379,3,B0026RX2VE,"I saw part of this movie on television (Hallmark Hall of Fame special), which has great family entertainment.  So, I decided to purchase it for my collection of Jewish or Israeli films.  First the price was ridiculously high ($57); so I waited, and waited.  Loving Leah is a good family movie--appropriate for all ages and genders.  It is a nice romantic story, with a great ending.  It is informative to those who are not familiar with Judaism or Orthodox Judaism, specifically the ancient Levirate custom of a childless widow marrying her late husband's unmarried brother to raise up a child in the dead husband's name.  It did a great job of showing that not all Jews are religious or observant; and it showed the disdain many religious Jews have for the non-religious/non-observant.  However, it lacks good drama and high emotional content, that would seemingly accompany such a story line. I realize it is closer to a romantic comedy than drama, and is easy to digest, but it doesn't come close to some other movies I own--Left Luggage, Ushpizin, The Chosen, Fiddler, to name a few with both high drama and comedic relief. Jews are emotional.  This doesn't show the deep hurt, grief, pain, anger, joy that would exist in real life.  In my opinion, it was a bit bland.  Though filmed in NYC, with beautiful and classic Washington, D.C. scenes shown, I would have preferred a larger focus on the drama this movie could have had rather than on the cinematography.

Overall, I was somewhat disappointed, but I would recommend purchasing it.",1288051200,7,1541,4.843511450381679

opposites. After that you root for Leah. It mightn't be sociologically
or even logically kosher but neither is it masquerading as rocket
science. Entertainment makes its own rules. Some fine performances -
especially the wonderful Lauren Ambrose. Guaranteed uplift on a rainy
Tuesday afternoon.",1254787200,6,429,5.515151515151516

3857388,5,B0026RX2VE,"Here we have the age-old theme of a marriage of convenience, and we all know what happens to those in most fictional settings. But the twists and turns this story takes along the way make it an entertaining journey. The characters are colorful and interesting, from the stereotypical Jewish mother, to the outspoken housekeeper that befriends Leah. It is fun to see Leah find herself as she moves away from the Orthodox community, but that in and of itself may present a problem for some viewers. The idea that she has to compromise the teachings of her faith to find happiness may not set well with everyone, though her own mother does appear to eventually come to terms with it.
But the story isn't all smooth sailing. The handsome young doctor marries his sister-in-law because otherwise he would have had to participate in a ceremony that would have denied the existence of his brother, whom he had loved deeply as a child, but hadn't found common ground with as an adult before he died. His fiancee is not too happy with the new arrangement and issues an ultimatum. He promises to tell Leah that she needs to move out, but can't seem to find the right moment. When he finally realizes he loves Leah he struggles with feelings that he is somehow betraying his brother by doing so. That is when Leah decides to leave him.
*Spoiler Alert*
When you see the picture on the cover it seems that is spoiler enough, but in case that didn't give it away for you, they do eventually work out their issues and get back together for real. So if you would enjoy a story where a sweet, unassuming, but sometimes feisty young woman wins the affection of a successful and attractive young doctor, then this may be right up your alley.
Pretty much family friendly--there are a couple of kissing scenes that lean toward the passionate side. They do share a bed in one scene when they are trying to convince Leah's mother that they are ""really married"", but they are fully pajama-clad, have pillows as a barrier between them--and, after all, they are married. When they do finally realize they love each other you see them in the kitchen doorway in a passionate embrace one minute and the next thing you see is Leah coming out of his bedroom in her nightie the next morning as he is fixing her breakfast. The implication is clear that now they are ""really married.""
An earlier reviewer quoted some favorite lines--I'll add another one.
""Dude, it was so much easier when you dated non-relatives.""",1251417600,46,2480,4.638636363636364
3857389,5,B0026RX2VE,"My husband and I love this movie. When I fiest heard about this Hallmark TV movie my husband said that he would record it for me, but he would not watch it. So, I watched it when he was out of the house. However, when he came home I was watching the end of it and he started to watch it.  He got interested in it.  After dinner on that day I watched it again with him. He loved it, too.  Since then I decided to purchase it.  we shared it this weekend with our grown son who laughted much. It is funny and has a good message. It is a jewel of a movie. I wish that there was more movies like this one.",1251072000,22,600,3.776

8353581,5,B0026RX2VE,"I have loved this movie from the first time that I saw it years ago.  Lauren Ambrose is radiant and convincing as an Orthodox Jewish Women who, after the premature death of her Rabbi husband wants to explore the world beyond the relatively closed life that her faith has demanded.  In accordance with an ancient Jewish custom, she and her brother-in-law (Adam Kaufman) are joined in what they see as a marriage of convenience but of course that transitions into something much more.  Their journey is not without obstacles and stumbles but as in most fairy tales, love triumphs.  Susie Essman and the great Mercedes Ruehl provide excellent support as the respective mothers of the couple.  Even though the product description says that the video is presented in a full-screen 1.33:1 aspect ratio, it is actually a wide screen 1.78:1 image that will completely fill a modern 16x9 wide screen TV.",1523404800,,894,4.894039735099338
