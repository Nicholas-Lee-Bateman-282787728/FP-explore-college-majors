8000833,1,B0000DFZZS,"Just when you thought ""Samurai Deeper Kyo"" was taking a much-needed upturn in quality, the fourth volume takes an artistic nosedive right into the depths of schlock. Once again, it feels like the writers are pulling random snatches of the manga and pasting them together with the alcohol-fueled nightmares of a third-rate fantasy writer who hasn't taken his Ritalin in the last week. In case you guessed, I didn't like it.

Anyway, His Majesty's identity has finally been revealed -- historical punching-boy Nobunaga Oda, who has been resurrected in a temporary body and now wants to conquer the world. Of course, he ends up fighting against Kyo, revealing that he's also immune to Kyo's ultimate sword technique.  Meanwhile, Yuya is marched through a field of hallucinogenic flowers (they're fun!) to where Kyo's body is hidden, Okuni's secret identity is revealed, and Yukimura fights against the expert archer Basara while the forest burns.

Oh, and Benitora decides to suicidally take on Nobunaga -- leading to another epic fight between Nobunaga and Kyo, which is unexpectedly interrupted by a character we haven't seen all season. But Akira has also turned against his former allies, and Yuya might end up dead as a result of his weird obsession with Kyo.

I'm starting to think that the people behind ""Samurai Deeper Kyo"" were just making stuff up at random by this point -- we've got tree monsters, evil porn nurses, dramatic flashbacks that instantly get forgotten, forest fires that start and stop at random, and the most anticlimactic man-versus-monster fight in the history of anime. It feels like the writers were just trying to end the stupid arc as fast as possible.

In fact, the entire first episode is so fractured and hyperactive that it's hard to even figure out what's going on -- and even after that, nothing makes much sense. The fight scenes have gotten kind of ridiculous (one of the Junishinsho just STANDS THERE while Yukimura sprints several yards and stabs him!), random stuff happens all the time (random fireballs from the sky!), and major plot developments get shoved to the side. Okuni turns out to be untrustworthy? Eh, Kyo just sort of ignores that, 'cause she's sorry now.

The most insanely silly scene has to be when poor Yuya gets locked inside a block of ice, and just sits there FROZEN for about half an hour while Sakura natters on for no real reason. Seriously, how about unfreezing the heroine and THEN talking to her, huh?

And all the characters seem to be doing stuff totally at random. Let's see -- Benitora is suddenly going on suicide missions, Yukimura is  LETTING himself get shot because suddenly he thinks he's a ""bad guy,"" NOBODY cares about Okuni's treachery, Akira reveals that he has an obsessive gay crush on Kyo (another one?!), and Yuya finally figures out who killed her brother... and promptly stops caring about getting revenge. The only good character development is for Kyoshiro, who finally reveals his true power (and a very muscular chest -- topless assassins rule!).

The one upside: the bloopers are brilliant, especially the ones from the guys playing Nobunaga (""Your manly ways have really swept me off my feet... sure, I'll go to the prom with you"") and Benitora (""Lost my... contact lens... life... not... worth... living!"").

It seemed to be getting better for awhile, ""Samurai Deeper Kyo Volume 4"" pretty much crashes and burns like the random fireballs from the sky.",1271462400,,3444,4.953206239168111
8000834,5,B0000DFZZS,"This anime has moved to the top three in my list of favorite animes. I love Berserk, Cowboy Bebop, Trigun, Big O, Armitage (all of them), Escaflowne, Rocord Of Lodoss, & many more. Demon Eyes Kyo is now tied at second place with Cowboy Bebop.
I absolutely loved each of the main characters. They had great humor and complete loyalty to one another.
I purchased the complete collection because of some happy reviews that I read. I had no idea what to expect and I fell in love with the series ten minutes into the first episode. It felt, somewhat, like watching the FOX TV series '24' in the fact that you just couldn't get enough and had to keep watching to see what was going to happen next.
To me, it was completely worth every dollar spent. I wear my new 'Samuri Deeper Kyo' t-shirt with extreme pride!",1089763200,,805,4.409395973154362
8000835,4,B0000DFZZS,"The battle of Sekigahara was, from the viewpoint of Japanese history, an apocalyptic struggle.  Traditional weapons faced guns and mortars on an inconceivable scale for the first time, and an old form of government was washed away with the uniting of Japan under one sword, that of the Tokugawa Shogunate.  While many things did happen during the battle, Samurai Deeper Kyo adds one more - a swordfight between two of Japan's greatest fighters Mibu Kyoshira and Demon Eyes Kyo.  Kyo lost, but not by very much, and the fight ended when a meteor struck the combatants and sealed their spirits into one body.  Kyoshiro left the battlefield, his memory in tatters, to take up life as a wandering apothecary.
As any viewer would know, temporary truces like this never last, and a series of traumatic events brings Kyo back into consciousness - determined to regain his own body and take vengeance on the only man to beat him.  The first part of this series follows Kyo on his quest, as he gathers his own followers about him and confronts another who seeks the use of Kyo's body - Oda Nobunaga, who preceded Ieyasu Tokugawa down the path to Japan's control.  This DVD documents this confrontation, Kyo's struggle for his own consciousness, and an unexpected challenge from someone he trusted.
If you aren't familiar with Japanese history and are wondering, this series only has a tenuous relationship to the actual facts.  It is a story of demonic possession and magical ninjas with an occasional fact thrown in to make it ring true to its audience.  For an American, watching the series for the first time, the wild meandering of the story and an ever-changing cast of characters can be overwhelming.  Despite its scope though, Samurai Deeper Kyo makes a strong effort to develop the stories of all the core players.  The maintains a much needed sense of continuity.
Character development and story aside, this is a fight film - one of high caliber.  While I will never get used to the combatants shouting out the titles of their moves, choreography and concept are interesting, and the visual metaphors are easy to work out.  While it is still impossible to decide who of Kyoshiro and Kyo is the hero and who the villain, the action whirls around them constantly.  The quality of the series is reminiscent of Rerouni Kenshin (which is set at the opposite end of the Shogunate period.  If you enjoyed the one, you will most likely enjoy this as well.",1075593600,9,2447,4.781472684085511
8000836,5,B0000DFZZS,"Samurai Deeper Kyo started out as an average samurai-switch-body anime, but after watching these last volumes, I must say that it has become both truly confusing...and truly compelling. Look, if you enjoyed the last DVD, then you'll really have fun with this one. I am not one to elaborate too much, but trust me. Nobunaga...what he does...you never see coming. Definitely something any Kyo fan should buy.",1069891200,4,406,5.074626865671642
