8561327,5,B002P8KOP6,"If you enjoy pinball and want to learn more. Get this DVD. Keith Elwin is the best pinball player to ever play the game and he is good enough to share some basic, intermediate, advanced and how the f#&k did he do that techniques. That and it looks like he had fun creating this production as well.

Ever thought of pinball Opera, yeah... they did that too.

If you want to play pinball and play better, check this package out. You can be just like Billy too!",1421280000,,458,4.252873563218391
8561328,3,B002P8KOP6,From the other reviews I thought I'd be a pinball pro from this video. It was ok but the very  long opera spoof segment was too much for me and most comedy skits were kind of lame. I wish it would have had focused on game variety more then video editing skills. Giving it 3 because did learn a few tricks was hoping for more games to be shown.,1383350400,,343,3.971014492753623
8561329,5,B002P8KOP6,"very informative dvd....If you like pinball, you will love this dvd....after a few viewings of it my game has already improved. I would def buy from this seller again",1370304000,,166,4.758620689655173
8561330,5,B002P8KOP6,"An old guy told me, ""You *will* play better after watching this."". Didn't believe him - pinball is completely random, but what the hey, it's cheap and I could learn a little something - why not?

Watched it, was very skeptical.  Intentionally cheesy, but very informative. Looked too easy. But thought - why not try? So I pulled out Epic Pinball on my PC and... I did the moves.  They worked.  And thought - might as well try on a real table.  Went to an arcade and got a replay my second try on Transformers.

Just got second place at a competition last night, and I've only been playing two months. Missed first because the final round was on a 1970s EM table which I had little time to practice on, and the DVD covers newer SS machines mostly.  99% of the machines in arcades and bars are the newer SS type.

Be careful... You may get hooked.",1338768000,8,845,4.30379746835443
8561331,4,B002P8KOP6,"This video is an outstanding guide to pinball play... but not worth nearly the price that collectors ask for used copies of the original DVD (!). The video has been convented into an iPhone app that's now available for only a few dollars. It contains all of the same content, and is actually even easier to navigate than the DVD. Watch this, but do it on a friend's iPhone, and save about $198.",1314144000,2,394,4.410958904109589
8561332,5,B002P8KOP6,"Buy it if you like pinball.
Buy it if you think you like pinball.
Buy it for someone who thinks they like pinball.
Buy it for your kids -- they'll learn how to play better than you!",1275782400,5,181,3.918918918918919
