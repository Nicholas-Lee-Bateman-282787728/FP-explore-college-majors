7987836,5,B00008XS0S,"This is an absolutely fantastic product. There are so many quality factors I don't know where to start. The intriguing style and perspective of the drawings in this animation make it constantly fun to watch. The teachings and philosophy of the ""Wolf Clan"" has actually inspired me to be a better person. I'm going to stop writing this review so I can go watch it again rite now.",1218758400,,378,4.573529411764706
7987837,4,B00008XS0S,"Okay wow, I never thought that I would find Machine Robo.  It's never been released here in the United States, however I did rent this weekly through the Japanese rental stores in Japantown.  So anyway, it was ironic that I could go into the stores and buy Machine Robo mecha toys under the brand name ""GoBots"". Yes this was the era that Transformers, GoBots, and Robotech dominated the airwaves.  So what is Machine Robo?  It's the actual anime that was made for the GoBot toys.

Ironically Cy-Kill is not a main character, and either is Leader-1.  However, Jet and Drill are part of the main characters.  They both speak and feel like Gobots, but definity this has more depth and story.  The story takes place in a cybernetic world.  Humans are actually droids and transforming Robots co-exist.  The enemy actually is probably a different set of toys that never were released under GoBots brandname.  But this is a low production television cartoon which took place during Macross or Voltron?  hehe.  So don't expect 3D graphics.  Don't expect high quality japanese animation.  Think back and expect Voltron or Shogun Warriors quality.  But with the following of Robotech.  I'm sure quality cannot replace the storyline or plots of these original Machine Robo classics.

The DVD is more or less subtitled, nothing more.  The translations aren't as great as today's standards.  You'll find words like ""metal laster""  in the second or third episode.  Unforunately if you're Japanese you'll realize that the true translation is ""metal  luster"" a oiled product that protects the robots from rust.  Yes!  The robots rust in this series.  It's great!  The DVD oddly also has sketches of Cy-Kill's mecha.  They are exactly the same as the toy.

If you enjoy GoBots, Transformers, you'll love Machine Robo.  Watch this DVD and watch the Machine Robo protect planet Cronos from the evil robots!",1092528000,5,1887,4.955128205128205
