8236281,5,B000ZPGJUA,"The process of familiar disintegration, break of affective ties and the violent surroundings shape the hostile attitude of a teenager who observes the existence as part - in lesser or greater extent - an urban jungle.

He tries but he just can't escape from this brutal stage of free violence; which eventually will carry him to insert as part of this ambiance.

Well acted and keeping in mind all the predators that surround them, mother and son will have to face with it.

In many ways, this story keeps a narrow influence of the Italian Neo Realism where the existential desperation and hopeless dictate the rules.

Absolutely recommended.",1375401600,,642,4.916666666666667
8236282,4,B000ZPGJUA,"This German film is by Detlev Buck, who sad to say I don't know anything about. It stars David Kross in his first film role; he plays the 15 year old son of a woman who seems to be a live in lover. She upsets her current meal ticket for 'no longer giving him a hard on' and becoming over weight and is unceremoniously evicted.

She then takes her son to a slum hole in the nasty end of town and he has to go to the local state school, where it is obvious that education runs second on the curriculum to staying in one piece. He has to learn the new rules pretty quick and with the help of two neer do wells makes a start and then soon the pupil becomes the teacher. As he becomes more emboldened he gets ever deeper into the murkier side of Berlin life and things just spiral. I don't want to spoil the plot but this runs for 98 minutes and it is a rollercoaster in that you think it is over far too soon.

This is a fast paced loud and sometimes disturbing film. The soundtrack is pretty good too including Gang of Four and Beck amongst others, I always find it strange that foreign films have so much English sung music in them but it seems to work, there is quite a bit of German punk influenced material too.

It is original extremely well acted and deals with modern life issues in an honest way. I am a fan of foreign films and as I speak conversational German always appreciate a bit of Teutonic cinema. This offering from Buck will only add to my enthusiasm and I want to hear more from him.",1302566400,2,1499,4.109215017064846
