7772088,3,B01H2G0LX0,"Bought it for my mom.  As a guy, all I could think of was how annoying Susan Sarandon's character was, and I kind of got hung up on that.  My mom liked it though, which is what was important...",1473724800,,193,3.923076923076923
7772089,5,B01H2G0LX0,I've seen it twice. Susan Sarandon will make you laugh out loud in this heartwarming story (and ode to Los Angeles) about a widow and meddling mother starting her new life in California. I hope to see her and Rose Byrne nominated for their work in this fine film. JK Simmons shows a softer side in an outstanding turn as Sarandon's new friend and love interest and the rest of the supporting cast does an equally good job. I especially like the scene when Marnie accidentally becomes a film extra. For anyone thats worked in film and TV you will get an extra kick out of the sequence.,1473638400,5,584,4.416666666666667
7772090,5,B01H2G0LX0,"Sarandon is so incredibly funny and heartbreaking in this. It must be in her top performances (which is saying a lot, but really believe it).

7772093,3,B01H2G0LX0,"""I think it's time we set some boundaries."" Lori (Byrne) as been dumped by her boyfriend and is struggling with getting through the day to day grind of life. Things get worse when her overbearing and constantly there mother Marnie (Sarandon) shows up and tries to help. Eventually Lori needs a break and when she goes to New York for a job she tells her mother to stay. Without Lori to take care of Marnie finds ways to help others and, more importantly, herself. This, like many reviews, should be taken with a grain of salt. Mainly because I am a guy and this movie was not geared toward me at all. That said I didn't think the movie was that bad, but it was just nothing I could totally get invested in. Some of the scenes were funny, but Sarandon played the part in a way where it made me feel sorry for her more than anything. That may have been the intention but that is what I got out of it. Also, the movie is not what I expected. I was expecting something along the lines of a more serious Guilt Trip type movie, and this is more about Marnie finding what makes her happy. Overall, not a bad movie at all but, again, the movie isn't made for me. If you liked Hello, My Name is Doris you will like this as well. I give this a B.",1473120000,2,1236,4.132780082987552
7772094,4,B01H2G0LX0,"A very pleasant, low-key movie about a mother and daughter. They could have easily made the mom a cartoonish, overbearing character and had tiresome fights between the mother and daughter, but the movie was much more subtle than that. Very light comedic touches with some strong emotional scenes too. Susan Sarandon is excellent; it's not one of those big, dramatic roles that actresses typically get award nominations for, but she deserves it.",1473033600,3,444,5.180555555555555

7772097,4,B01H2G0LX0,"Do you have a mother? If so, there might be something in this little comedy that you recognize...

Writer/director Lorene Scafaria (""Seeking a Friend For the End of the World"") seems to be in familiar territory. From the trailers, I was afraid this would be waaaay overdone, but to my relief, even though this mother has some boundary problems, she isn't as bad as advertised. And she DOES have a good heart.

Scafaria assembled this sterling cast:
  * Susan Sarandon (""Tammy"") Marnie is still mourning the death of her husband in Brooklyn two years ago but she's getting a bad feeling about her daughter in L.A.
  * Rose Byrne (""Spy"") TV scriptwriter Lori is mourning the betrayal of her lover a few months ago AND the death of her father. Now she has to go to NYC to shoot a pilot. (Try telling THAT to the guy at the airport!)
  * Jason Ritter (""Gravity Falls"") Jacob is the one who got away from Lori.
  * Jerrod Carmichael (""Neighbors"") Freddie shows Marnie how to make her iPod work.
  * Jo Jordan (""The Last Resort"") The old woman in the hospital keeps making those peculiar motions with her hand.
  * J.K. Simmons (""Whiplash"") Zipper does NOT have a motorcycle, he has a Harley! (Is that Simmons doing his own singing? Wow!)
  * Michael McKean (""Better Call Saul"") Mark is mistaken for a serial killer. Yowch!
  * Cecily Strong (""The Boss"") Jillian gets a dream wedding to the woman of her dreams.

This is PG-13, so expect little or no profanity but our gal DOES eat some marijuana to hide it from a traffic cop. This is refreshingly free of Computer Generated Imaging and blowie uppie stuff. Furthermore, I didn't even SEE a gun! Wow!

This won't win any awards, but it's entertaining and Sarandon has found a comfortable niche for her considerable talents.",1466726400,12,1767,4.620578778135048

7772106,5,B01H2G0LX0,"Susan Sarandon is an American (heck, and international!) treasure. She's absolutely perfect in this role. The odd thing is you look at the DVD cover and think it's going to be a daughter vs. mother war and would get so annoying after awhile. In fact the title is not realy accurate. Sarandon's character is hardly a meddler but more a nurturer and someone who genuinely helps people without being annoying at all.

Also, oddly, her daughter played by Rose Byrne suddenly disappears from the movie for the middle third. It's basically about Sarandon finding her way after the death of her husband. If anything JK Simmons is in this movie more as is the newcomer Jerrod Carmichael.

There are so many great poignant, funny, sexy and joyous moments in this. The cast is terrific in each and every role (well, maybe bar Rose Byrne's boyfriend in New York who just seems way too over the top).

The extras feature a commentary track, superb gag reel, a look at the real mom this story was based on and a Making Of.",1493337600,,1009,4.594444444444444

7772113,3,B01H2G0LX0,"Lorene Scafarias second feature film (after Seeking a Friend for the End of the World) stars Susan Sarandon as Marnie Minervini.  Marnie, a New Jersey native and a recent widow has moved to Los Angeles to be near her daughter Lori (Rose Byrne), a television screenwriter.  Marnie is well healed after her husbands death and likes to spread the money around generously.  She becomes friendly with an Apple Store salesman (Jerrod Carmichael) and buys and gifts iPads and iPhones away like cookies.  Note a major plug for Apple throughout the movie.

Marnie, likely unwilling to face her own loneliness, becomes a little too involved in Loris personal life.  Lori has recently broken up with her boyfriend and actor, Jacob (Jason Ritter).  He even has a nice new girlfriend (Megalyn Echikunwoke), but that doesnt stop Marnie from asking him to give her daughter another chance.  Lori is quite distraught over the breakup but this is what her mom does these days.  Meddle.  An appropriate word but a silly movie title.

While visiting Lori on the California set, Marnie stumbles into a retired cop doing some security work for the production.  Zipper (J. K. Simmons) takes a shine to Marnie, flirts a little and gives her his business card.  It comes in handy later when Marnie is tossed into the pokey for spreading her late husbands ashes in the ocean.  They have a flirtatious but chaste on-and-off relationship.  Clearly Marnie is still stung by her hubbys death.  As is Lori which Marnie sometimes fails to recognize.

Although there are some dramatic moments centered on this familial loss, the film is mostly a lighthearted comedy worthy of many smiles.  Sarandon, especially, shows a range of emotions and has a good grasp on comedy.  Cecily Strong from Saturday Night Live is also very good as a lesbian friend of Lori and the recipient of a big wedding thanks to Marnies generosity.  The story isn't necessarily new and sometimes seems like a good TV series, but it is fun and charming and worthy of a look.",1486339200,,2013,4.847507331378299

One of the best parts is when Sarandon's character meets Zipper, J.K.Simmons. Whose honest funny personality is just what she needs. And the dialogue is charming and heartfelt. Love the part where he plays Dolly Parton for his chickens!!-this movie is chock full of life and really lifts you up.

Rose Byrne is funny and real. The loss of her father and Sarandon's husband resonates completely.

Sarandon is a true Diamond. Beautiful Acting, love the Brooklyn accent! Mucho Brava!! Thank you for making a movie so many people who've lost an important family member can relate to.",1485043200,,822,4.899280575539568

7772125,3,B01H2G0LX0,"Lorene Scafaria both wrote and directed this little film that surveys a significant issue  how do we deal with the death of a spouse?  and unfortunately turns it into a rather tepid and at times annoying diatribe of dealing with loss by meddling in others affairs while attempting to come to grips with personal issues of loss. Were it not for the presence of Susan Sarandon the film would likely have lost the following it has. Nice idea for a story but far too overstated.

The synopsis most pertinent to the story is as follows: With a new iPhone, an apartment near the Grove, and a comfortable bank account left to her by her beloved late husband, Marnie Minervini (Susan Sarandon) has happily relocated from New Jersey to Los Angeles to be near her daughter Lori (Rose Byrne), a successful but still single screenwriter, and smother her with motherly love. But when the dozens of texts, unexpected visits, and conversations dominated by unsolicited advice force Lori to draw strict personal boundaries, Marnie finds ways to channel her eternal optimism and forceful generosity to change the lives of others - as well as her own - and find a new purpose in life  in the form of Zipper (J.K. Simmons).

Marnie meddles in so many other peoples lives  all with good intentions and purchasing friendships with money and gifts and favors  that it dazzles the viewer. So many topical issues are covered  same sex marriage, current pop singers, peeks into Black Matters issues, social media hookups, fear by widows of starting partnerships with older men, Vaping, etc  that Marnie encounters and tries to manage by using her estate. It does get overbearing. But then the ending is so well sculpted that the tiresome first 90 minutes can be forgiven. Grady Harp, December 16",1480982400,,1770,4.8344370860927155

7772146,5,B01H2G0LX0,"Engrossing character piece about Marnie (Susan Sarandon), a good natured recent widow, whose generosity knows no bounds much to the chagrin of her daughter Lori (Rose Byrne) who is not only grieving the loss of her father but rebounding from a particularly messy breakup.  Marnie's largesse is much appreciated but is she somehow overcompensating?  Are these large gifts a way to somehow attain love and affection?  The film intricately charts Marnie's evolution.  The changes in Marnie through the course of the film are so subtle as to hardly notice.  This is essentially a drama with comedic moments to leaven the heavier bits.  One memorably amusing scene concerns the reading of one of Lori's home pregnancy tests.  Sarandon imbues Marnie with strength, dignity, and conviction that make the changes in her character believable.  One could also say sexy because at the ripe old age of seventy Sarandon's still got it.  It's interesting that this year Sarandon, Sally Field (""Hello My Name is Doris""), Meryl Streep (""Florence Foster Jenkins""), and Helen Mirren (""Eye in the Sky"") gave career performances at the age when most collect Social Security.  On a note of trivia this is the second film this year, ""Deadpool"" being the other"", that featured Merrilee Rush's ""Angel of the Morning"" on the soundtrack.",1473811200,8,1311,5.1415094339622645
