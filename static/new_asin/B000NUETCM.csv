I highly recommend for anyone who enjoys racing, doing research, etc.  I have purchased other 'old' footage books and videos, and this is the best one.  Unfortuanately, it came out in 2006, and has not be re-released, so hard to find.",1238457600,3,268,4.911111111111111
8181417,5,B000NUETCM,"For anyone with an interest in the history of NASCAR, this compilation is simply awesome. I can't understand why this dvd set hasn't gotten more attention, because it truly deserves it. If you're tired of the old clips that you see on every NASCAR video, you will be riveted to this one. Great footage of how NASCAR got started, and the people that started it, with great narration.  Seen enough of the sponsor driven, politically correct drivers of today? This dvd highlights the colorful drivers & owners that made NASCAR great. Awesome tributes to Curtis Turner & the struggles of Wendell Scott.  Great stuff!!!",1177200000,6,614,4.894230769230769
