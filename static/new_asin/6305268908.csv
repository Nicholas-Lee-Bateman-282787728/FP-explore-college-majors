998229,5,6305268908,"Veggie Tales- A Very Silly Sing-Along
There are so many wonderful things to say about this movie.  I first began watching it during nursery at our church- it easliy captured the children's attention.  It is a wonderful, imaginative series with a religious twist.  While watching with the children, I could also hear myself singing right along with them.  It was great!  The songs are silly, true to the title.  But they are also fun and entertaining- a real recommendation!",1031356800,,473,4.924050632911392
998230,3,6305268908,"I love ""Silly Songs with Larry"" and bought this tape hoping for a compilation of those songs. While it did have some of the songs from ""Silly Songs"", it also had many of the songs from the main part of the Christian video show ""Veggie Tales"" itself. I don't have any objections per se to religious songs from the show: it is, after all, a religious series, and most of the episodes are nice little moral messages. However, this what not what I was hoping to get. In addition, the songs that aren't from the ""Silly Songs"" segment aren't quite as silly, and some of them (when taken out of the context of the story in which they appeared) may be a little hard to follow. If you watch the Veggie Tales series and want a collection of sing-along songs from that show, this is a great video. If you are specifically looking for just the silly songs, however, the video you want to get is ""VeggieTales - The Ultimate Silly Song Countdown"".",1019001600,13,933,4.398843930635838
998231,5,6305268908,"I couldn't believe it, but even my 9 month old loves this video!  She sits in her exersaucer and bounces along with the songs.  Definately a must-buy for your kids.",1014249600,3,164,4.433333333333334
998232,5,6305268908,"My daughter's Godparents bought her this video. And it has a great message about character and morals that I feel is important for children. She loves it, laughing out-loud at some parts. It is a welcomed break from Barney whom I was growing extremely tired of.",1002585600,2,261,4.695652173913044
998233,5,6305268908,"Got a favorite? Not yet? Must be because you are holding out, waiting to buy this truly sing-along classic.
Hmmm.... a classic? OK, not yet... in a few years. Too new to be a classic.
I need to give the ""I Love My Lips"" song its due, but my person favorite is the ""Bunny Song."" Find out the tragedy of eating that chocolate bunny!
Buy this, crank up the TV and dance about in complete Veggie Tale abandon.
I fully recommend this video.",999820800,3,435,4.253012048192771
998234,5,6305268908,Our 3 year old son loves Veggie Tales!! My wife and I love Veggie Tales because they teach real values. It's a breath of fresh air seeing animation that isn't centered on violence and rude behavior. Veggie Tales are a must for any parent who is very discriminating about their child's choice of veiwing material- you cannot go wrong with any Veggie Tale video!! Your kids will love them!!,996192000,2,388,4.63768115942029
998235,5,6305268908,"Finally the artists at Big Idea Productions made a compilation of all the funny songs that our veggie friends could muster. Now I, I mean my kid, can sing along with Larry and Bob in some of their funniest songs ever. My favorite song is ""The Bunny Song"". Yes, I know we are not supposed to sing this song, but Big Idea has tweeked it a little. You will have to buy the video to find out how. If you have children, and even if you don't, make an investment in good wholesome fun. You will find your health become just a little better. :)",992995200,,537,4.123809523809523
998236,5,6305268908,"I've seen examples of most of the various types of Christian children's videos over the last 20 years, and frankly, most of them stink!  Veggie Tales is something different and something special.
This particular offering reprises many of the ""Silly Songs"" found in the early Veggie Tales videos, as well as some of the other featured music.  Kids of all ages will love the songs and adults will also enjoy the mild poking fun at TV infomercials.
My favorites?
""Love My Lips""
""The Hairbrush Song""
""Oh, No""
Watch this video with your child (age 2 or 22) and laugh yourself silly!",992908800,3,577,4.702970297029703
998237,5,6305268908,"This silly Veggie Tales' video is loved by both my 8 & 10 year old sons. Its been two years since they first saw it, and my 10 year old still enjoys it thoroughly. Its fun for me, as his parent, to hear him sing along and have so much fun with good, quality entertainment! If you have a 7-9 year old at home, I'd suggest you get it soon.",981072000,,337,3.8285714285714287
998361,5,6305268908,"We adore this video - our whole family sings along and dances around to these incredibly silly songs.  This is VeggieTales Magic at its best.  I think the folks at Big Idea are geniuses - these songs are so clever and hysterical!  These videos appeal to everyone from our two year old to her Granny.  We enjoy them so much.  This is such an awesome combination - truly funny and enjoyable entertainment packed with a heaping helping of God's Truth.  And talk about a mood lifter - I dare anyone who's having a bad day to watch this ""Silly Songs"" video, sing along, and still feel bad after finishing - I think it would be impossible!",975196800,6,633,4.413793103448276
998362,5,6305268908,"The Veggie Tale series quickly caught hold of our family.  My children love them, and so do I.  They are very cute and entertaining.  Larry Boy is our favorite, especially my sons.  The movies teach children good values!  The songs are wonderful, I find myself singing these songs all the time.  We cant wait for a new one!",974764800,2,323,4.482758620689655
998363,5,6305268908,"We received the two silly songs videos (this one and the second one) for my daughter's 1st birthday. I was hesitant at first, but ""Bob"" has quickly become a must-have in our household.
The silly songs videos are great 1st videos in the Veggie Tales series, particularly for young kids. The reason is that all the songs are from the other stories in all the other videos. So if your kids learn these songs, they will be like the other videos since they already know most of the songs. Plus, my 15 month old doesn't sit still for the story-based videos, but absolutely loves these song-based ones.
AND as everyone else said - they are even entertaining for adults! I seriously think we're going to need a 12-step program to get ourselves off of ""Bob""... :-) But that's not a bad thing, given the excellent morals taught in these videos. I love that everything isn't ""politically correct"" like in some Saturday morning cartoons. People (and veggies) aren't perfect - they do make mistakes, but these videos teach that God forgives you, while also explaining why you shouldn't do those things (like lying, etc.)
I highly recommend the Veggie Tales videos, and especially the sing-a-longs as starters.",972864000,5,1196,4.810679611650485
998364,5,6305268908,"This movie was an inspiration to my brand new niece. She clapped and sung along to the variety of all the different silly songs! She even had a favorite song,""Love my Lips,"" a song by Larry the cucumber. The  playful characters would take quite the imagination, but the songs are just  amazing for your kids to play and learn with about the stories of God,  love, and just plain having fun. I rate it 5 stars for an amazing video!",962236800,3,430,4.35
998365,5,6305268908,"We love these--they are contagious and fun for adults as well as kids.  My 5 and almost 8 year olds watch this one and the other Veggie Tales we have, and we're working on using a couple of these tunes to sing at church with  the Sunday school kids.  (I actually think the adults would have fun  singing them as well, really.) Music is a great way to learn and remember  stories.",955238400,,379,4.208333333333333
998366,5,6305268908,Finally!  It is a wonderfully scripted and tuned video.  The folk at Big Ideas have a huge hit on their hands!  My 5 and 3 year old boys love it.  We have even replaced other mindnumbing videos with all the other Veggie  Tales.  Safe videos!,954720000,,241,4.2444444444444445
998367,5,6305268908,"My kids, ages 5, 10, and 18, all love the Veggie Tales movies!  The tunes are so catchy, you find yourself humming them!  And the moral messages these videos give are great - we need more family entertainment like this!",949104000,6,219,4.45
998368,5,6305268908,The adults and children in our home love this video.  Larry's silly songs are incredibly fun.  So much fun that I find myself humming them in the grocery store checkout line.,943401600,2,174,4.580645161290323
998369,5,6305268908,"I teach both in a Catholic school and Sunday school, so I am constantly on the lookout for anything that is educational, entertaining, and appealing to as many age groups as possible.  When I first saw Veggie Tales, I  laughed so hard I cried!  My students have asked for them again and again,  and I  bought a set of tapes for my four children (aged 5-12).  They are  frequently watched (even when the kids aren't home)!  My favorite is The  Hairbrush Song! This particular tape is the newest to our collection, and  will soon be worn out, too!",942451200,12,545,4.469387755102041

7886244,5,6305268908,"We don't normally put on shows trying to get our daughter to watch tv. Besides, most of the time she loses interest in minutes. She loves music though, so I bought her this tape. It really holds her attention and she dances a lot! The songs are very kid friendly and have great values. Yes, Veggie Tales is a Christian program. However, it is not shoving it down your throat. Many of the songs just have good values and are not God related, for those with concerns. I am confident that she will love this tape for years to come. And I am very happy that I bought it with the message it sends! My husband and I daily (literally daily) have Veggie Tales songs stuck in our head. But we both say its ok and a good thing. The songs are much, much better than some of today's other children programing. I have since bought my daughter Veggie Tales Live DVD and Veggie Tales Sunday Morning Songs Cd. She likes both of them and dances to them all. I am disappointed with my Veggie Tales Live purchase, it is not what I expected and my daughter likes it the least. If your child likes music, you can't go wrong with this purchase!",1332806400,,1122,4.272300469483568
7886245,5,6305268908,This has great songs and is fun to listen to. I used to love Veggie Tales but now I like Godzilla. (I don't know why I said that but ok.),1120435200,,137,3.6
7886246,5,6305268908,"If you do not love this video you have a cold heart. It is entertaining for the whole family.  Being that the VHS tape is bright green my son always can find it on the shelf.  He can watch it over and over again.  Which gets the songs stuck in your head.  You'll be singing ""I Ate the Bunny"" in the shower, but it will be FUN!!!",1073433600,,328,3.8507462686567164
7886247,5,6305268908,"I was getting REALLY tired of the Baby Mozart video, so we purchased this video for my 1 year old daughter.  She pays attention through the whole video, and she claps and bounces to the rhythm of the music.  While she probably doesn't understand the themes yet, she certainly enjoys the animation and music.  We plan to use it for awhile, then bring it out again when she's older and can understand the moral lessons.",1032739200,3,417,4.533333333333333
