7955095,5,B00005UQ83,This was a gift for my 99 year old uncle and he LOVED it!!,1516060800,,58,3.2142857142857144

7955097,1,B00005UQ83,"This is not really a DVD on Bryce and Zion. First of all, there is no menu. You have to play from beginning to end. The beginning is a long, boring description of the Grand Canyon with the worst looking video I have seen on a commercial DVD. Fuzzy, out of focus, washed out--it looks like it was taken with an old 8mm film camera and poorly converted to digital. Finally.....you get to Bryce Canyon, with more ugly video. Oh...and did I mention the bizarre background music? If you can call it music at all. Then some more ugly footage of Zion. Then a long, boring section on Glen Canyon...and by that time I dozed off. Needless to say, I returned it.",1386892800,,651,4.344262295081967
7955098,4,B00005UQ83,"I was surprised that the footage seems to be tinted making the amazing rocks and landscapes appear over exposed and losing their detail. I found it amusing that the roads are almost as red as the painted rock. I realize this DVD is not HD and so they may have been trying to spruce up the colors but after adjusting my TV color settings I found that because of the tinting no matter if I choose even the cool temperature settings the rocks will be just as glaring red and lacking in definition as a result. However, I still gave it 4 starts because nothing can really take too much away from some of the most gorgeous spots in the world and as I mentioned before the price is right if you do not have HD this might just work out for you. It certainly has given me some vacation ideas.",1354924800,,784,4.198675496688741
7955099,5,B00005UQ83,"Like the other national parks dvd's by Image Works, these beautiful dvd's with wonderful music and no narration are the best I've ever seen. A+++++",1103500800,5,147,4.92
7955100,4,B00005UQ83,"I liked it.  But I would appreciate the ability to mute the music and just hear the sounds of nature.  Also, in general, they move too quickly for my taste from one scene to the next.  I freely admit however that this is a personal preference and my preference changes from scene to scene.  Some scenes I like and wish they would have dwelled on, others they couldn't change the scene fast enough for me.  However, I think that in general they move a little too quickly from one scene to another.
I also picked up Glacier National Park DVD as well, by the same people and the same comments apply to it.  As I have found (on Amaazon anyway) no alternative to these DVDs, I appreciate that they exist and they are definitely of good quality.  But, as the title says, they could be better, in my humble opinion.",1082160000,8,808,4.346666666666667
