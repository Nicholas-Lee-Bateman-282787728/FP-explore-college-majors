8283114,5,B001BFN1EK,This is an excellent Christian based series for preschoolers.  It combines the letter and number of the day with a biblical name and concept.  For example: A is for Abraham and Abraham was the friend of God.  We can be the friend of God too.  I wish more letters were available.  They are hard to find.,1421020800,,302,4.321428571428571
