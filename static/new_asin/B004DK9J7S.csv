8425513,2,B004DK9J7S,"""The Secret Bride"" is a fast moving Warner's film released in 1934, running at only 63 minutes. Typical of these Warner's programmers, it starts quite well but deteriorates into a talk-fest, ending with exposition to resolve the plot instead of filming, as if the budget had been reached and wrap up was required in the cheapest possible manner. Starring Warren William as a District Attorney, it is a tale of political intrigue involving blackmail and murder.  The leading lady is Barbara Stanwyck, nicely made up and photographed sympathetically but proving Bette Davis was not the only powerful actress who toiled in Warner's programmers. Stanwyck's part could have been played by any contract player and uses none of her unique talents.  William Diertele directs and keeps the camera moving striving for effect with some unusual camera angles but it does not add up to much. One ""effect"" is rather funny.  Diertele puts the camera above the set of an office and as Grant Mitchell rushes between rooms, frenzied as if in a maze, we see him open and shut doors and rush almost in a circle.  While some of his frenzy is conveyed, the overall effect is hilarious because with no ceilings, the sound stage set is exposed. By the way, Mitchell gives an unusually charged performance, the best in the  film.

The film has been released in the Warner Archive Series which means it is an unrestored print with no extras. The release could surely only be an attempt to cash in on the reputation of Stanwyck. The print is adequate.",1455840000,,1524,4.819923371647509

8425517,4,B004DK9J7S,"It's always nice when you view a film that exceeds your expectations. In John Stangeland's generally excellent biography of Warren,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WARREN-WILLIAM-Magnificent-Scoundrel-Of-Pre-Code-Hollywood/dp/B0066B7P0K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WARREN WILLIAM: Magnificent Scoundrel Of Pre-Code Hollywood</a>, the author considers the film ""a forgettable programmer,"" ""mere product"" and ""a waste of (the) two stars.""  His main complaint seems to revolve around the plot, although many will find it's themes quite contemporary.  Warren plays an Attorney General who marries Barbara Stanwyck, the daughter of his boss, the governor.  Before they can break the news to daddy, a scandal erupts accusing the governor of selling a pardon to a convicted financier, who soon afterwards commits suicide. Barbara convinces new hubby Warren to keep the marriage secret since as Attorney General he has no choice but to investigate the accusations, and news of their marriage would compromise the situation. I found the story to be quite enjoyable and even after viewing hundreds of mysteries the film kept me baffled as to who was behind all the shenanigans, especially when the character who I figured was the obvious suspect was....well, I'm not going to ruin it for you!  Youngsters will be surprised to find that political corruption, shady financiers and sensational journalism wasn't invented on their watch. The supporting cast of Warner Brothers regulars (Glenda Farrell, Grant Mitchell, Henry O'Neill, Douglas Dumbrille) were all great in their roles, and I was impressed by the innovative direction of prolific William Dieterle.  Be on the lookout for a great shot filmed through the back of a radio! Although it's probably true that Warren, Barbara and Dieterle weren't fond of their assignments, you'd never guess it by the excellent character portrayals and direction. Running a snappy 64 minutes, THE SECRET BRIDE is a good example of the truth to the old cliche ""they don't make 'em like they used to.""  Anyone fond of '30's movies, the actors, the director, or mystery films will not be disappointed......(3 and 1/2 stars)
