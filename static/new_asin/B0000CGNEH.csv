1919299,5,B0000CGNEH,"Wow!  This is a documentary that is more than just your regular ol' National Geographic/TLC/Discovery Channel film.  It practically gets into the psyche of these feathered creatures.
You'll laugh.  You'll cry.  You'll feel like you are flying right there with the birds.  This is truly a unique film.  There is nothing like it out there.
You owe it to yourself AND your family and friends to see this and take them along!  This film is taking America by storm!  It is slowly growing bigger by word-of-mouth.  GO see it now!",1057017600,4,523,4.722222222222222
1919300,5,B0000CGNEH,"""Winged Migration"" is the story of migrating birds told with beautiful imagery. This film places the audience inside flocks of birds are they travel thousands of miles twice every year in search of food and a place to breed. To say that the images are extraordinary and breathtaking is somehow an understatement. We see over 40 species of migrating bird -geese, ducks, cranes, storks, terns, penguins, pelicans, swans, and more- up close as they face the challenges of their long journeys. We also observe the birds as they breed, care for their young, search for food, and interact among themselves. There are several species of non-migratory birds who reside alongside the migrators featured as well.
""Winged Migration"" was conceived and directed by Jacques Perrin and was filmed on 7 continents by 5 film crews over the course of 3 years. The filmmakers employed traditional gliders, remote-controlled gliders, helicopter-style gliders, helicopters, a Delta plane, an ultra-light motorized aircraft, hot air balloons, and even a bicycle to get these spectacular images. It is the Delta plane that was able to infiltrate the flocks and get the amazing in-flight close-ups that you see in the film. ""Winged Migration"" has very little narration, and what it does have is a little awkward. There is the occasional subtitle to tell you what species you are looking at and how far it migrates. And there is the occasional voice-over narration by Jacques Perrin. I am giving the film 5 stars in spite of its spotty written-then-spoken-then-written narration because the stunning images and the opportunity for the audience to see this extraordinary phenomenon up-close, as no human has been able to do before, more than makes up for the narration problems. And the narration does address the basic  ""What is that?"" and ""What is it doing?"" questions that would otherwise go unanswered. But the story of ""Winged Migration"" is told primarily with spectacular images accompanied by a musical score by Bruno Coulais.
""Winged Migration"" is a Must-See for bird lovers and for anyone who loves beautiful images. It is about 90 minutes long, and watching birds fly can seem repetitive after a while. But it seems that whenever the audience might tire of looking at these lovely creatures in flight, the birds -or the filmmakers- show us something new and interesting to revive our interest.",1056758400,6,2377,5.126288659793815
1919301,4,B0000CGNEH,"What others say about how beautiful, surprising and moving the images of this film are is all true. But there are several rather irritating and problematic aspects of the film that are worth thinking about. First, it is announced at the beginning of the film that no special effects were used, and yet the credits at the end specifically give a long list of names under the title ""special effects."" Several shots are obviously computer generated (as when you see birds flying over a globe, as though looking at the world from space). Are all the special effects just for these few moments of the film? The contradiction between the announcement at the beginning and the credits at the end invites speculation about this, and raises the possibility of a large grey area of enhanced effects. My guess is that virtually all the sounds of the film are 'special effects', since we never hear the planes, wind, water, camera etc. (And that's in addition to the pretty awful music.) There are many scenes that are clearly staged, again blurring the lines between documentary and well, what? Fiction? Perhaps it's best to call the film creative non-fiction, but I found its reliance on goofy narratives, staged scenes, enhanced images, and who knows what else to be distracting and annoying. Why not just let the great images they got through sheer hard work and inventiveness (in the field) speak for themselves?

1919302,5,B0000CGNEH,"My lovely bride and I were fortunate to see this at the Seattle Film Festival, and were very impressed by the scope and achievement of this work. Seeing it on DVD would be nice, but I can't imagine it would compare at all to the experience of seeing it on the big screen.
The filmmakers spent three years collecting their amazing images of all types of birds migrating north to south and back again (the Wall Street Journal had an article about how they did it; I seem to recall it involved a lot of graduate students). What they've put together is a wonderful example of what the cinematographic art can do when not encumbered by special effects, computer animation, or even much of a narrative line. The timeless, God-ordained patterns of migration are enough of a plot to drive 90 minutes of great visuals. There's a surprising mix here of drama, humor, choreography, some danger, some death, and mesmerizing images of huge flocks swooping and diving as one.
An hour and a half of bird pictures might sound pretty snooze-inducing to a lot of people, but don't compare this to run-of-the-mill nature documentaries on TV. It's something quite different, and even folks who aren't particularly into birds or nature films should probably give this a chance. You might find it, as I did, surprisingly rewarding.",1056067200,2,1309,4.79646017699115
1919303,5,B0000CGNEH,"I don't believe I have every seen such an incredible nature film!  This is truly cinematography as an art form.  With probably no more than a dozen lines of spoken material, the film managed to convey a whole host of emotions in the viewer and makes one aware of the beauty of these amazing birds and their interations with each other, us, and the rest of nature.  A truly memorable experience. Not to be missed!",1054252800,20,412,4.466666666666667
1919304,5,B0000CGNEH,"This 2001 award-winning documentary by Jacques Perrin certainly is unique.  It's a full 99 minutes of exquisite cinematography of migrating birds, some species flying as far as 12,500 miles each year.  There are a few captions, which tell the name of the bird and the amount of mileage they fly in order to migrate.  There's also some light background music as well as natural sounds, and a few sentences, spoken by the director.  Other than that, it's only the birds, whose migratory patterns were followed for three years.
At the beginning of the film there's a disclaimer informing the audience that there were no special effects were used. And so I sat there in wonder of how they were able to achieve all their shots.  There's the beauty of birds flying in formation, close up shots of them feeding their young, competing with each other, stopping to rest.  And there's one magnificent shot of fleeing an avalanche.
There are different species filmed in different areas of the world.  We see the Artic Circle, the American Southwest, the industrial areas of Eastern Europe, the vast oceans, the skyline of cities and even a shot as they fly past the World Trade Center and the Statue of Liberty. We also see hunters whose gunfire brings sudden death as well as a bird with a broken wing who is attacked and devoured by crabs.
Here is nature, in all its power and glory.  I sat there wide-eyed, taking it all in.  And somehow, the petty concerns of my daily life seemed to fall into perspective.
Some people might find this film boring and I doubt if it will get wide distribution in theaters.  It's only playing in one theater in New York and, even in this densely populated city, there was a very sparse audience.  I'm glad I was one of the people in that audience though because I loved every moment of the film would definitely see it again on DVD, especially if it had special features to describe how the cinematography was done.
Highly recommended.",1054252800,169,1959,4.665697674418604
1919305,5,B0000CGNEH,"You're flying in formation among the geese, cranes, and ducks, seeing neighboring birds work those wings and instead of feeling exhausted you're wondering why they're rolling their eyes at you.  The reason is that you're some nosey parker in a towed glider or ultralight plane, peeking at them through an amazingly steady telefoto lens.  There is little voice-over to this montage of cool footage about flocks of birds flying north and south; titles or voice-over identify the kind of bird, location and length of migration.  Occasionally the short films comprising the montage have a small plot and sometimes this is humorous.  Although flightless birds and insectivorous birds have walk-on parts and there is some irresistible footage of non-migratory birds, the documentary focuses on the charismatic V-formations of stately birds and their wintering and nesting activities.  There are some Asian birds, but most are European and American and there are some great images of pelagic bird and penguin nesting colonies, replete with skuas.  There is some poignant footage of migration through polluted industrial areas in Eastern Europe and during hunting season in North America.  There are almost no people in the film (the few who appear are clearly scripted, but they are very nice), though there's some splendid footage of migrating birds on the East River in New York and the Seine in Paris (I think).  I found myself getting anxious, worrying about whether this amazing evolutionary phenomenon of migrating birds would continue to decrease as people destroy stopover habitat.  Waterfowl, of course, have it better than insectivorous birds because hunters have helped to preserve migratory habitat since the early 20th century.  I kept breaking away from the beautiful footage to wonder whether there'd be a heavy conservation message; in retrospect, I think I brought that anxiety into the film with me rather than finding it there.  This movie is not like Microcosmos; the birds are really ""in nature"" and we are voyeurs.",1054080000,11,2029,5.270186335403727
1919306,5,B0000CGNEH,"I was awed and inspired by the poetic beauty of the film, that captured the charming innocence of baby birds, of the birds in majestic flight and of the beauty of the landscapes as seen in the eyes of the beholder. The rich color of the film made it possible to believe the magic of our amazing planet in our lifetime. It also captures the challenges of the different species of birds to survive both in natural and man-made disasters, including their defense against predators. Created by Jacques Perrin and expertly directed by both Michel Debats and Jacques Cluzaud, they had spent their hard earned efforts to create and direct a documentary about birds that can amaze us with their combined intelligence, beauty and their struggles, through triumph and tragedy in their everlasting conquest to survive. Better bring your box of kleenex just in case, some of the scenes can prove to be truly horrific.",1053907200,5,905,4.84516129032258
1919307,5,B0000CGNEH,"[The following review is based on the version released in Japan, which runs 99 minutes.]
Director of this Oscar-nominated documentary ""The Travelling Birds"" aka ""Winged Migration"" is Jacque Perrin, perhaps best remembered for his role in ""Cinema Paradisso"" (as adult Salvatore), but he is also a producer whose works include ""Himalaya"" and ""Microcomos,"" and he now again delivers an astonishing film about the migratory birds.  If you like beautiful photography, don't miss it.
The film, shot over the time of three years, is about the migratory birds -- cranes, swans, and so on, even penguins (yes, some of them travel more than 500 miles) -- but do not be mistaken.  The narration is limited to the minimum amount, and the film does not tell much about the birds' habits, or reasons for or the ways of traveling.  The strength of the film solely lies in its visuals, which, as other reviewer says, would make you wonder ""How did they do it?""
Yes, the camera follows as close as possible to the FLYING birds, very near to their side, or even to their tails, so you can watch the wings beating the air or the slight movements of feathers.  The camera work is simply incredible, tracing the birds over the stormy sea or the snow-covered wilderness, and it captures the lively features of these birds that fly so powerfully and gracefully.
But some parts of the film, though not explicitly, shows the perils of their long travel that ranges more than thousand miles.  The film reveals plights of birds, sometimes deaths, in a very understated way.  The beauty of the film does not hide the reality of their travel, which are in fact very dangerous.
According to the material I bought at a multiplex in Japan, the  camera crew too had to fly to chase the flying birds, using the light-weight plane to get closer to them.  If you have seen Anna Paquin's 1996 film ""Fly Away Home,"" you may remember a small airplane she rode, with a triangular wing over the saddle and a propeller at the back of it.  So, the filmmakers were also risking their lives.
Beautiful as the film is, you may feel a little weary after seeing many shots of these birds, for the film intentionally avoids introducing a story in it.  Instead of that, the film let the birds show their lives as much as they can.  Sometimes they are humorous, sometime painful, but always beautiful, and that is the greatest merit of the film.",1050710400,24,2394,4.6761904761904765
1919308,5,B0000CGNEH,"WINGED MIGRATION is filmmaker Jacques Perrin's stunning documentary study of bird migration. My wife and I left the special studio screening exclaiming, ""How'd they do that!?""
The film begins along a minor waterway in Europe as a flock of geese begins its annual migration north to its summer breeding ground. It then cuts to other locales around the world as other species of large birds - usually cranes, swans, and storks, but also gannets, loons and others - begin their respective journeys. In all cases, the captioning identifies the species, their start points and destinations, and the miles between the two.  Occasionally, Perrin makes the point more spectacularly by superimposing the flying flock on an image of the Earth taken from near-orbit. Voice overs are kept to a minimum.
Except for New York (with the WTC still standing), Paris, and a dismal industrial wasteland in eastern Europe, the flocks are shown flying through unpopulated landscapes both varied and magnificent: beaches, ice fields, Monument Valley, northern tundra, open oceans, snow-covered mountains, Asian farmlands, forest-enclosed lakes, deserts, and tropical rainforests. The sunset and weather (blizzards, fog, thunderstorms) provide dramatic backdrops. Then, at journey's end, the birds are shown in their summer habitats - usually steep, dramatic cliffs or rock-strewn shores with sea-ravaged margins.
But certainly the most eye-popping camera work is with the bird formations on the wing. The apparent vantage point of the lens is among the flock, with individual birds only an arm or hand-length away above, below, or to the side. I mean, you're RIGHT THERE! You'd think they'd have to be computer animated models. But a disclaimer at the film's beginning states that no special effects were used in the filming of the birds.
While Perrin emphasizes the round trip to, and the stay in, the breeding grounds, he doesn't gloss over the dangers. The viewer watches as individual birds fall victim to animal predators, human hunters and poachers, and industrial pollution. Some circumstances are heartrending, as when a disabled bird is surrounded and overcome by predatory crabs on an African beach.
Before concluding back at the same waterway and with the same flock of geese which began his documentary, the filmmaker makes a digression at first seemingly inconsistent with the title, i.e. with flightless Emperor penguins in the southern hemisphere. Of course, they use their wings to swim a couple hundred miles.
WINGED MIGRATION is a film to remind us that the real world can be just as spectacular and amazing as any one of the mega-budget, FX-laden, mindless thrillers dished out to the masses. It's wonderful.",1048723200,64,2704,5.288372093023256

With the sparest narrative, you see 90 minutes of spectacular footage of birds in flight, the landscapes they cross, and the trials they face. Penguins even make a brief appearance! What's not to love?

There are one or two cheesy digitized moments where the camera is supposedly sweeping in from an out-of-atmosphere shot, beneath the clouds, and then back to tracking the birds.

1919602,5,B0000CGNEH,"This is a movie I bought in DVD and it was so beautiful I had to have it in Blu-Ray and here it is.  I loved it and watched it again today.  As others abundantly point out, not much talking, a bit of on-screen titles so you know what kind of bird is being featured and where (usually) it is, and gentle but emotional music -- mostly the same theme throughout but played with different tempo and instruments to convey difference sense of urgency.

This movie succeeds in large measure to convey what it feels like to fly over beautiful land, stormy sea, frozen wastes, high mountains and at times human dangers -- bright lights of a city and a ""factory"" that is actually a steel mill in Dunkirk, France (51 2.848'N 2 18.928'E).  Having recently learned about blast furnaces I recognized at least two of modern design adjacent to a shipyard.  The music is more urgent and ""industrial"" at this point.  It doesn't accuse humans or modern society; but illustrates that they do pose yet another obstacle to migrating birds.

Beautiful scenes include Iceland, Vietnam (probably the spectacular Ha Long bay area), France, Monument Valley and Lake Powell in Arizona.  Some writers complain about penguins and parrots, but I am very happy to have penguins and parrots added to the movie for a bit of color and to include the South American continent.

The ""how it was made"" special is as interesting as the movie itself.  The energy and determination needed to make this movie is one-of-a-kind.",1384560000,,1484,4.717054263565892

1919604,2,B0000CGNEH,"While the photography and the featured flight of the many birds is superb, there is one scene where a bird has been caught by a steel trap.  The trap is closed on the bird's leg and the bird is using its bill to try to get the trap off of itself.

This part of the program spoiled the entire presentation for me.  If the birds' flight is so great, why include one that is trapped so that it cannot be free and join the flight?

The limited narration and the limited subtitles also were a distraction to me  Why not include a narrative that talks about the flight of the birds as the presentation goes on?

As you can tell, I am very disappointed with this DVD.

(where you scarcely knew from one moment to the next whether the flock would return to its handlers or take off into the wild, never to be seen again)  Amazing!",1378252800,,564,4.833333333333333

1919626,5,B0000CGNEH,"I do not regularly watch shows about nature, but this documentary on bird migration is fantastic.  The moviemakers flew in ultralights alongside various birds of the world, oftentimes over exotic locations.  The result is images so stunning that it is hard to believe they are not enhanced by CGI.  While there is no storyline per se, I found myself laughing throughout the movie at the antics of the birds.  The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary (sadly, it lost to a vastly inferior film--Michael Moore's Bowling for Columbine).

This is the kind of film where you want the best possible resolution, and this blu-ray transfer does not disappoint.  The level of detail is stunning in most scenes, particularly those shot in direct sunlight.  Color saturation is strong.  At times it felt like you were right there with the birds.  Some scenes shot in lowlight or overcast conditions have film grain, but it is soft, not gritty.  I can live with that.  The sound was fine, I suppose, although my eyes were so absorbed in the visuals that I did not pay too much attention to the audio.

Parental Advisory: This movie is rated G.  It is suitable for even young children.  There are a few scenes that show birds being killed by predators, but they are mostly bloodless.

I highly recommend this movie.  You do not need to be ornithologist to appreciate it.  It is a ""must see.""",1365292800,5,1400,4.7190082644628095

The DVD resolution on my plasma TV isn't as clear or detailed as when I watched the broadcast in HD, and with a show that is so majestic both with scenery and detail of the birds' feathers and eyes, it is a big loss.  You have to suspend belief for a few of the scenes (like with the horses, or the car in the desert) because they are clearly ""set-up"" by the filmmakers, but these are probably less than 10 percent of the show and the rest seems authentic.",1358553600,,626,4.370689655172414

YES, YES, YES!! Guess I should have done a little more homework! Well, I'll have to retract some of this information I gave to my 5 year old.

1919654,3,B0000CGNEH,"""Winged Migration"", is a DVD by Jacques Perrin.  My copy is the ""Special Edition"" which includes a ""Making of..."" feature which is more than half the value of the DVD.
The chief value of the movie proper is its' very, very beautiful and creative photography.
But that has a drawback too as it is an overload of scenes of birds flying.
  Much of the flying footage is of various Geese species - no doubt because Geese are easy to ""imprint"" and thus unafraid of humans, camera and flying. Virtually all the birds photographed are larger species - Geese, Swans, pelagic birds, a couple land-oriented species (e.g. Western Grebes, Cranes, and Sage Grouse).

The story is simple yet if you watch it with your heart one can see the beautiful grand design the creator has in nature herself. Awesome movie for all ages.,1306195200,,350,4.161764705882353

1919712,2,B0000CGNEH,"Maybe my expectations were too high, but this film just doesn't compare to today's standards for nature documentaries.  Also, the little narration it has is hard to understand.  It sounds like the guy is talking through a tin can or something.  The movie consists mostly of birds flying, which sounds cool but lacks depth as gets kind of repetitive.  I do appreciate the effort it took to make this film, but it's for bird watchers only.  A rental at best.",1299715200,,456,4.65
1919713,1,B0000CGNEH,"When I watched this program on TV I was impressed with the stunning shots and ""poetic rendition"". No, I do not mind the long stretches without narration; in fact, I like the music ...

Then I found out how they made this film -- as you probably also have heard. The filmmakers hatched and trained some of the birds, they took blue-screen shots and cut-and-pasted them on top of scenery pictures, they transported birds to unnatural habitats, and on more than one occasion they faked some events, such as putting birds in fake ""oil"" to mimic industrial pollution ..

Come on, pretty pictures are good to look at, but there ought to be a higher law. One of Gandhi's Seven Sins is ""Science without Humanity"". What the filmmakers did was no science, and they did it with little compassion for their subject. By exploiting and harassing birds they concocted a series of pretty pictures, but what is the point? We are supposed to admire the beauty and freedom of these birds, we are supposed to learn to appreciate the diversity of life and how progress has destroyed natural habitats, and (if I can infer a little further) reflect how we can adapt a more sustainable lifestyle so as to leave some space for our fellow species.

There are a few scenes filmed in cloudy conditions that were not crystal sharp, but is  expected in that setting and adds to the effect - like the industrial complex scene.

The work is fascinating, covering bird migrations (mostly ducks, geese and cranes) from Europe to Asia to Africa to the US and South America. A few scenes are not for children, such as an attack by crabs on a wounded bird. There is almost no political preaching, for or against the interaction of birds with humans. This is a solid couple of hours of intelligent and instructive entertainment. The price is ridiculously low for the value one receives (much less than an evening at the movies), especially the parts where the filming and ""parent-fixating"" is explained.

This is an amazing ""story"" of the journeys, hazards and adventures of some beautiful creatures.  There are a few quite shocking moments - but they are explainable to young viewers.

1919872,5,B0000CGNEH,"Breathtaking!  Beautiful!  There are so many positive things that one can say about ""Winged Migration"", the popular 2001 documentary film/natural tale that captured the attention of audiences around the world with its ambitious plan to showcase a birds migration during the Winter and its return back.  Ambitious because it would involve a large crew and a global filmmaking effort plus cinematography never before seen at that time.

With a crew of 450 people, 17 pilots and 14 cinematographers, an ambitious documentary directed by three individuals Jacques Cluzaud, Michel Debas and Jacques Perrin with their goal to  show people about birds who migrate and travel the globe.

Many people know that birds migrate once the Winter comes but where do they go? What do they do?  This natural tale, which the directors prefer to use than calling it a ""documentary"" is all about watching dozens upon dozens of different birds from all seven continents and what they do.  Quite literally, the cycle of life amongst the birds and captured on film.

What is most amazing about ""Winged Migration"" is that you are right there.  It's like having a front row seat as you are very close to the actual birds flying nearby.  From India to New York, to Africa and then to the rain forests of South America Peru, to Japan, Vietnam, Australia, the arctic North and South Pole, over 40 countries and filming in all seven countries during the Summer and the immense cold, this was among the most ambitious films that I have ever seen.

What is most striking about the film is its beautiful cinematography.  As mentioned, birds are close by, so close that you feel you can touch them.  And then seeing the camera focusing on the flock of birds as it flies right by the rainforests, the desert, the arctic, the ocean with castles and old architecture right below them.  There are also awesome shots overhead.  Showing the scope of the landscape or how many birds have flocked to an area.  It's just amazing cinematography.

The film uses nearly 590 miles of film to create an 89 minute documentary.  For example, in the scene in the arctic, one reel of film is 4-minutes long.  With film being so expensive, the filmmakers had challenges of wondering when to make good use of the film while sitting in the frigid arctic for hours filming.  When do you shoot?  Do they wait for something to happen?  Definitely a risky and difficult filming task but they pulled it off.

""Winged Migration"" is a film that does its best to showcase the life of these birds as they migrate thousands of miles and then return back to where they come from.  Some going from Africa to Europe, others from the North Pole all the way to the South Pole.  The fact that the filmmakers covered so many birds and followed them so far around the planet.  A feat so ambitious, so difficult, so challenging and so risky but something not done before in the sake of filmmaking, what we are able to get is one of the most beautiful and breathtaking films ever created.

The goal of the filmmaker was to create a film that would be a symphony of nature.  So, while you watch the film which is occasionally narrated and features occasional subtitles when introducing a bird or region and how far it has traveled, it's all about what you see on video, the beauty of them flying and traveling thousands of miles around the planet.  And then in conjunction with the beautiful visuals comes the beautiful music of Bruno Coulais and the Bulgarian choir.  Again, everything comes together perfectly!

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Winged Migration"" is featured for the first time in High-Definition ala 1080p with an aspect ration of 1:85:1.  All shots are outdoors, different types of weather depending on the continent.  Near the desert, near the snow, near lush green backdrops of grass and trees and the ocean.  The different types of birds and their own different colors.  ""Winged Migration"" is all about its vibrant colors.  And the beautiful cinematography showcases that vibrancy and sure, it was beautiful on DVD but on high definition, a film like ""Winged Migration"" is just breathtaking and knowing that this film is not utilizing CG in the filming of the birds, that the beauty we see on screen.

As for the audio, audio is presented in English, Portuguese and Spanish in Dolby True HD 5.1.  There is occasional narrative but the film is all about its music.  And the symphony-based music by Bruno Coulais and the vocal groups from Bulgaria and the music overall was just fantastic to listen to.  There are scenes where you will hear the birds singing and chirping and that what you hear all around your entire home theater surround.  Music and ambient sound of the birds play a big part in this film.

As for subtitles, ""Winged Migration""is subtitled in Danish, English (UK), English (US), Finnish, Hindi, Norwegian, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish (Latin Am) and Swedish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

The special features of ""Winged Migration"" is probably one of the most important to watch because you get to learn if the crew saved any of the birds that were in harms way or just shot as nature intended it to be:

  * Full Length Director's Commentary - Despite the thick French accent, the commentary track is very important to listen to because you get good insight of the filmmaking process.  Of what was actually shot live and what was created to make a point.  For example, there is a scene with the birds flying through industries and showcase a storyline about pollution.  The scene shows birds walking through, what looks like oil and one getting trapped in it.  All birds escape but one.  One is stuck.  It makes you wonder, did the bird die in the oil or did the crew save it?  You realize through the commentary that the oil is not oil but black milk, so the bird was not harmed.  The scene was shot as it is to make a point about pollution.  So, there are many commentary segments that are just informative.  You also learn more through the various featurettes on disc.
  * ""Making of Winged Migration""- A 52-minute featurette on the making of the film.  You realize that a good number of the birds have been imprinted.  Meaning, when they were born, the first thing they saw was a human and thus, they were attached to the humans and taught how to migrate.  Similar to the 1996 film ""Fly away Home"", ""Winged Migration"" showcases various birds that were imprinted and thus, how various filming through the ground, oceans and sky were done.  You learn of the challenges of filming in New York and Paris but also all over the world and the risky challenges faced by the crew.  The film was shot in 48 countries, all seven continents and the challenges include shipping cranes to Senegal to film a scene but weather wasn't cooperating and the birds got sick.  So, the film crew had to face certain situations such as making sure the birds were taken care of.  With so many film crews, it was very important that filming was done right.  You learn how difficult, risky and challenging it was to do this film but so many people around the world took part in working on ""Winged Migration"" to make the film possible and to make it happen.
  * ""Creating the Music"" Featurette - With the film focusing so much on the music, a 17-minute featurette was made to showcase the music of Bruno Coulais and the use of a Bulgarian orchestra that Jacques Perrin recommended and then having Nick Cave sing the ending theme.
  * About the Film - This nine minute featurette is about ""imprinting"".  How many of these birds are raised and trained to obey their imprinter, the sounds of a vehicle, human or horn and for their migration.
  * Further comments - This 14 minute featurette is possibly the most informative piece for those who were wondering about certain segments.  In one scene in Africa, a bird with a broken wing is shown walking.  While all these crabs pursue it.  You are then left with a shot with the crabs all on top of what appears to possibly be the bird that was injured.  But it is revealed that the crew stepped in and actually saved the bird.  One of the few scenes where the film crew decided to save a bird instead of filming the actual and natural killing of the birds.  Another scene was of the cuckoo and how the bird was eliminating all eggs from a nest and wanting to be the sole bird to be raised by another bird (part of its instinct).  The bird would then grow older, migrate to a country like France, find a mate and then the eggs would then be brought to a nest of the bird that raised it.  Also, explanation of the filming of the Rockhopper penguins and how a certain bird would go and kill and eat the sick penguin babies or the babies that lost its parents.  Very informative segment.
  * Photo Gallery with Filmmaker Commentary - A 13-minute featurette showcasing photos of birds in flight and the various types of birds featured on the film.

The Blu-ray is also BD-Live enabled.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Winged Migration"" was a rare film to come out in 2001.  The enormity of following birds as it traveled the globe and having film crews document them migrating in all continents and 48 countries is just amazing.  And watching it on film and seeing the behind-the-scenes makes you appreciate the film much more because what was an ambitious idea became reality.

So, you ask yourself the question.  Would you enjoy a film like ""Winged Migration""?  There is no major plot, it's a straightforward nature film about the many birds who migrate.  So, it depends on how you feel about nature and if you can watch a film about birds traveling around the world.  Many have been in awe of beautiful cinematography and the accompanying music. It's definitely a special and unique film and if you want to watch beauty in action, beauty from all continents captured on film, you really can't go wrong with ""Winged Migration"".  Highly recommended!",1239062400,7,9892,4.671685002895194
1919873,4,B0000CGNEH,"Here is a beautifully-filmed documentary on the migration of birds. This movie took four years to make, and one can see why. You cannot get much closer, I would think, to the flying birds than what you see here. Cameras were literally attached to some of them so you, the viewer, are up there in the sky right with these (mainly) geese as they migrant thousands of miles.

The colors are beautiful and the sound is good. However, be warned there is no dialog so it can be tough viewing the whole 90 minutes in one sitting. Also, I found the best and most interesting footage at the beginning.

Nevertheless, this is a good addition to anyone's collection if or no other reason than the magnificent photography and the effort filmmakers put out to make this wildlife documentary. It also is interesting how they show different species every few minutes, where they go each year, how many miles they travel, the exact route, etc.

1919875,5,B0000CGNEH,"An amazing piece of work, obviously requiring indescribable patience.

Since this movie is educational, I mention something that some educators might want to note.  The narrator says, ""The summer is short-lived,"" but uses the common mispronunciation of ""short-lived.""  This word derives more directly from the noun ""life"" than from the verb ""live.""  The summer has a short life, and is therefore short-lived, rhyming with ""jived,"" with the long-i sound of ""life.""  The word follows the pattern of ""heavy-handed"" (having a heavy hand) or ""light-headed"" (having a light head).  ""Short-lived"" means ""having a short life.""  The narrator's native language is obviously not English, and so he cannot be blamed.  Both pronunciations appear in dictionaries, but ""short-"" or ""long-lived"" with ""lived"" pronounced like the verb form makes little sense.",1233792000,,841,5.566929133858268

1919877,5,B0000CGNEH,"Who amongst us has not dreamt of flying under our own power? Despite a century of airplanes there is still nothing akin to winging off into the blue, crannying through small openings in trees, scaling sheer cliff faces. Never before has the idea of real bird-like flight been so perfectly expressed on film as it has in director Jacques Perrin's masterful documentary film Winged Migration. Naysayers have decried the film is not a documentary because many of the birds were raised from birth, then trained to obey humans, bonded to them for they were the 1st things the birds saw after birth, called imprinting), so they're not `really' wild animals. Another objection is that the film, on several occasions, intersperses computer graphics with the `authentic' documentary sequences.
  These objections are bushwah- this film is 1 of the most unique & exhilarating pieces of film- documentary or not- ever made. It goes & we see them interact in ways never not just seen before, but not really imagined. Yet, despite how informative it is the film is really about how birds live, in an interior sense. Most people watching this film will have ideas that birds migrate, are sensitive to earth's electromagnetic fields, & acutely aware of the seemingly most trivial landmarks, but it's when the film focuses in on a species or flock that we realize that all the birds are individual. Unlike the Alfred Hitchcock film, The Birds, these creatures are not mindless automata. Because they are not as sophisticated as humans does not mean they do not possess a high degree of sophistication, & 1 might even argue bird culture. Mating dances, flight patterns, hunting routines, are all delineated in detail, & we see the travails & triumphs of groups, even as some individuals fall prey to death in its myriad forms- human hunters, industrial waste, other birds, & in a particularly chilling scene a bird with a broken wing who is pursued on a beach by a horde of voracious sand crabs.
  Of course, being a documentary there is not a real plot, we just follow the different flocks through the course of a year. What intrigues is how the footage got so close to the birds? Some was taken while flying in ultra-light aircrafts, the noise of which the birds were made accustomed to while still in their eggs. Other footage was culled from hot air balloons & some from ground vehicles. Regardless of its provenance the visuals dazzle far more than any cyberworld can. Take your faraway worlds & galactic rides- give me this earth, this view, this way! Thankfully, there is very little narration- just enough to inform of a plight, but not enough to drone on irrelevantly.",1222214400,,2660,4.852422907488987
1919878,3,B0000CGNEH,"9/12/08  Having started with ""selections"" (e.g. #21 ""The Amazon""), I had an opportunity to see many bird species I'd not seen before..the DVD's Promotion Jacket of ""Winged Migrations"" was its selling point for me..I was a little disappointed, when viewing the DVD, that it differed so much from any other cinematography video, I've seen. I'm guessing that Perrin just had so many sights and sounds that he & crew wanted to present, especially for ""seasoned bird watchers"" ,that it was not possible to be ""all things to all people"".Narrations can truly enhance documentaries..however, ""Winged Migration"" does have ""an extra"",: an insert in with the DVD,listing the (1-24)scenes,giving the average uninformed bird watching viewer, a hint that it best be viewed via selections (e.g. #9[Bald Eagle]..#10[Canada Goose] vs ""see it all at one time"" really lengthy viewing of approx. 89 minutes "". 9/12/2008 abj",1221177600,,903,5.314685314685315

1919880,4,B0000CGNEH,"I wasn't sure what to expect of this film, recommended by a friend. It started slowly and at first I thought it was going to be slow and a low budget also ran. But it quickly got into its main theme, the migration of birds worldwide. Although the film hasn't got the power of some documentaries, the delight for me was the amazing filming. You are literally flying with the birds over the most stunning countryside, wing beat by wing beat. How this was done without the noise of helicopters or of planes flying alongside I don't know. But you can hear the whistle of wind and the sound of the wings beating the air.

So if being able to observe living creatures in this way awakes wonder in you, this is a film to watch.",1218844800,,720,4.294117647058823
1919881,5,B0000CGNEH,"Jacques Perrin's filmmaking team spent four years creating a masterpiece out of one of the most basic elements of our natural world - the seasonal migration of birds.  The result is nothing short of a riveting film.

Cynics might ask how anyone can be spellbound by watching the simple act of birds flying from one place to another.  The answer is that sometimes the simplest, most basic art is the most enjoyable.  Just as a great artist or sculptor can make a masterpiece out of the basic human form, a film can become great just by focusing on what we see everyday and making us appreciate it in an entirely new way.

Suffice it to say that any viewer of this movie will never look at birds the same way again.

Tracking various species of migratory birds across each continent, ""Winged Migration"" uses revolutionary camera work and understated narration/exposition to achieve wondrous effects.  If you've ever wondered what it would be like to fly in formation with migrating geese, go fishing like a pelican, or soar with bald eagles, ""WM"" will give you the answer.  Using a self-invented flying contraption, the cameramen were able to get right into birds flying in formation in dizzying shots.  This is tremendous work.

With ""March of the Penguins"" and ""Planet Earth,"" we are in a golden age of nature-documentaries. ""Winged Migration"" belongs in the top-tier of this fascinating genre.

Full disclosure - a couple of scenes will be tough for kids (e.g., crabs hunting down a bird with a broken wing, a baby penguin getting munched by other birds, etc.).  These scenes are handled tastefully, but might require some comforting of the youngsters.",1218844800,,1653,4.885304659498208

This film documents birds that are rarely documented for any real length of time.  It also covers them in some strange places.  Watching the birds fly over the autumn trees was beautiful.  Seeing birds fly into downtown while the city is lit up is awe inspiring.  I loved seeing the bald eagle footage.  I saw some birds I never saw before.

No special effects were used in the making of this film; but again and again you wonder at the  incredible footage used.

Here are what I think makes it superb:

1) Video footage. The scenery and bird footage is soul-stirring, bringing up a full range of emotions - from awe, to laughter, to sadness.

2) Video editing. Though there is little narration (a plus in this case) the editing was done in such a way that the various subjects flow together and the story flows smoothly.

3) Music. The music was developed specifically for this film. Though this in itself is not unusual, the music is a fine example of what music should do for a film - contribute to the emotions stirred by the video.

Second, the version I saw was dubbed in a very strongly accented english, which was distractive. Third (and perhaps more seriously), some of the sequences are obviously staged (for example, a parrot escaping from a cage in the Amazon): for a movie that purports to be a documentary, seeing something to be staged is an obvious disappointment.

1919991,5,B0000CGNEH,"""Winged Migration"" was shown on PBS not long ago. I set my VCR to tape it. Not having the time to check the length of the program, I had the VCR record it for one hour. As the tape played, I became totally enthralled by the majesty, strength, and beauty of the birds, the gorgeous photography, and perfectly accompanying music.

Then the taping cut off. The program had been one and one-half hours. I was missing the last half hour.

Far from being disappointed, however, it was a blessing in disguise. For this film is so extraordinary that a mere taping from cable doesn't do it justice and I decided to buy the DVD if available. I searched PBS; they didn't offer it. Next stop: Amazon. Sure enough, they had it, and it arrived two days ago.

The DVD is so magical I can't stop watching it. Plus my purchase helps support these wonderful people who created this tribute to the wonderful birds.

I have now returned to Amazon to buy *five* more as gifts. I know I will be giving family and friends a wonderful experience when I give them a DVD of ""Winged Migration.""

It does get a bit ""preachy"" in showing birds being shot by hunters, birds getting stuck in oily muck near refineries, oil rigs, etc. implying how birds are suffering because of humans.  I would have liked to have seen a PG-13 rating on this DVD, because of the actual death often portrayed (you see the birds get shot/fallin several times, or they show other birds killing smaller birds, eating etc...)

This has led to a rise in the number of nature movies that make it big dollar-wise.  The most recent example is probably this 1.5 hour film on migrating birds.  Filmed and narrated by Europeans, this movie looks at the yearly life of migratory birds in the Northern Hemispher.  The footage revolves around two migrations, the one north to the Arctic during spring and summer, and the one south to the equator during fall and winter.  Both migrations thin the ranks, but both are done for survival; one to reach feeding grounds and the other to reach nesting grounds.  The movie shows multiple species big and small both in N. America and Eurasia.  The footage is quite exquisite with numerous shots of birds in the air, sleeping on mountain slopes, nesting on beachside cliffs, landing on hot desert dunes and getting stuck in mud, garbage, swamps and other traps natural and manmade.  The cinematography is top notch, and the dialogue is kept to a minimum.  The one drawback is the music; it is average, and could have been much better, especially for a movie emphasizing flight and its marvels.

When I found out that the DVD version includes a ""making of the movie"" I didn't even think twice before clicking the buy button.

It turns out that the director was not a magician, they are just bunch of hard working people with lots of patient, and possibly a big fat budget.

It's a great family movie. But the dad / mom better do a little research on bird names, habitats, wet lands and other stuff because you kids are gonna have a lot of questions for you. (there's not a much narrative provided by the movie)

Often shot from the bird's perspective, you get the feeling of what it's like to actually be one of the birds flying right in their flock. One of the most remarkable aspects is the complete lack of sound of any craft tracking the birds. Coupled with the music, this is one highly inspirational film.

1920015,5,B0000CGNEH,"*Winged Migration* was a beautiful scenic film of birds migrating from the North to the South and back.  Admittedly, it wasn't as majestic as *March of the Penguins* but it was still breathtaking to see all that was captured.

This film featured ducks, geese, cranes, storks, gulls, gannets, penguins and several other species of migratory birds.  It is just amazing to see the miles they fly over long periods of time.  It's amazing to see that they don't tire mid-flight and just skydive to the ground.  They persevere.

The film opens with the migratory birds migrating to the Artic where it is warm.  Upon arrival, they break away from the group and begin to mate.  It's beautiful to see different mating rituals, including some of the most fascinating and graceful dances.  Of course, we see the chicks.  These little fluffballs are just adorable!

However, soon it's ""sink or swim"" for the youngs as the birds need to migrate back to north.  Summers in the Artic is short-lived.

Not everything is pretty in this film.  You'll see a small bird with a broken wing, devoured by a group of crabs.  You'll see ducks and geese being shot down mid-flight by hunters.  You'll see a duck stuck in a mud of oil.  You'll see a duck entwined with a piece of netting around one of her feet.  You'll see larger birds preying on the other birds.  But that is part of the cycle of life.

The sceneries are just beautiful.  The ocean.  The desert.  The mountains.  The Artic.  It just makes you wonder just how these filmmakers were able to capture all of these, including the birds in flight.  Just simply enthralling!

It was no surprise to see that this movie, made from 4 years of filming, was an Academy Award nominee.  I certainly look forward to more films by Jacques Perrin.",1167955200,2,1772,4.629032258064516

""Winged Migration"" does for migratory birds what ""March of the Penguins"" did for, well, penguins. The roughly hour and a half of video is simply spellbinding (and both my cats liked it as well as I did). The ""how we did it"" special features were all the more interesting after seeing the accomplishment.

On reflection, I did reduce my rating to four stars from five, entirely due to two scenes where migrating geese are shot by ""hunters"", and one (although more natural) scene at the seashore where crabs are pursuing a wounded bird - with the implication that they succeeded. While these are very real threats that face the birds, the scenes are unnecessary and destroy the mood which has been established.

If the Blu-Ray disc is as good as the Discovery broadcast (and it should be better) then this will be a title to pull out for friends.  You almost feel as though you are flying along with the animals.

Some of the ""reality"" checks showing hunters and trappers are less fun to watch, but thankfully they are short and few.  I have an absolutely new level of respect for our feathered friends after watching this.  I am anxiously awaiting the Blu-Ray release.

The settings are amazing, and the film could have been animated.  Scenes of Canadian geese flying near Gotham, white geese flying down the Seine to the Eiffel Tower, cranes roosting at sunset on an ancient temple, are almost too artistic to be believed.

But this film is not all sleep-inducing, relaxing scenes of avians winging their way over mystical scenery.  At some point, you connect emotionally with the birds on their odyssey.  Some of the footage is genuinely heartbreaking.  A few birds meet terrible dooms that made me feel sick with horror.  The camera films unrelentlessly and turns away only at the moment of actual death, but sometimes turns back after.  This film is rated G, but sensitive children could do with some parental guidance.

In a documentary I would expect a lot more information about the birds and the hows/whys of migration, complemented by the video everyone is raving about. Instead, the film is focused on simply watching the birds fly (mostly geese) while providing little if any information about them.

1920031,5,B0000CGNEH,"""Winged Migration"" is a literally globe-spanning series of tales, focusing on numerous species of birds including macaws, penguins, terns, ducks, and seemingly every other kind of feathered friend that shares the trait of migration.  A superb documentary that also seves as one of the greatest stories of adventure ever filmed; though the birds's migrations are the focal point we see numerous aspects of the lives of these fascinating creatures.  Their travels are often over tremendous distances and against incredible dangers - as with the emperor penguins in the magnificent ""March Of The Penguins"", it's just amazing what these winged beings overcome on an annual basis.  The hardships faced aren't the only aspect of ""Winged Migration"": the beauty, incredible cuteness, personalities and majesty of the movie's subjects are often front and center.

  The cinematography capturing all this is phenomenal, often filmed high up in the sky, apparantly using hang-gliders, hot-air balloons and the like.  It's rare that a visual record of this scale has ever been attempted in capturing one of the world's greatest real-life wonders.  Imagine a film in which, scene after scene, every shot is like the best photos in National Geographic or the best nature 'coffee table' type books, and you've got the idea of what ""Winged Migration"" captures.  Everything that's been said about the impact of this movie, and more, is proven true as soon as one starts watching this.

  ""Winged Migration"" is rated G, but one might want to make sure that younger children watch it with an older person.  The challenges faced by the birds are tremendous, and not all of their stories meet with happy endings, sometimes obviously and other times with situations that can only be surmised as being unlikely to end well.  Although it's shown as non-graphically as it can be while still faithfully recording the events - and while obviously made with an eye towards heightening awareness of the unnecessary dangers faced by the birds due to human factors [i.e. the now polluted and despoiled areas travelled through by some of the migrators] - some of the footage can be difficult to take, and can make you wish someone had lent a helping hand.

It rapturously speaks of God who is creative beyond comprehension. As the unsurpassed make-up artist, He applied the ideal hues and lines to highlight every eye and face.  And what person can out perform His choreography--the graceful precise synchronized ballets performed in stunning, multi-tasked, water-resistant costumes?

The musical score was absolutely flawless. The choir of lofty children's voices--faultless. How I would cherish owning a CD of such splendidly pure repertoire!

It is more about visual art and appreciation of the beauty of the birds than it is about education.  Together, the music and stunning flight sequences are mesmerizing in a kind of new age way.  If you love birds, be sure to see this movie, but think of it more as a multimedia art museum than as a lesson in how birds migrate. This is not March of the Penguins.

The movie is made up of a series staged scenes that place birds in carefully chosen locations.  The captive birds filmed in the movie have been turned into unwitting actors through imprinting on human trainers (who do not appear in the movie.) This technique has offended some people who have seen the movie as being impure. But again, this is an artistic project, the in-flight images the movie makers were able to capture through the use of imprinted birds are breath-taking and would have been impossible without the technique. Although at times the scenes are contrived and sometimes Questionable, for example, Canada Geese and a Bald Eagle descending into the Arizona Desert. (Forgive the moviemakers, they are French.)

If you enjoy birdwatching, and especially if you enjoy just watching birds being birds, get this movie.  If you need a tight story line or maybe even a point to a movie beyond just imagery, this may not be the movie for you.",1141862400,6,1436,4.607843137254902
1920037,5,B0000CGNEH,"Jacques Perrin and his dedicated crew are to be loudly applauded for this visually stunning examination of the migratory habits of countless species of birds.  You feel like you're right up there with these magnificent creatures in their instinctive journeys in the spring and fall.  With sumptous photography, a marvelous musical score, and deft camerawork, WINGED MIGRATION is a stunning experience the whole family should enjoy.  The film uses little narration but does include subtitles to pass on information on the various species.  There are some disturbing scenes where predators prevent some birds from making their journey, but as a part of our natural plan, these scenes are testimony to the survival of the fittest.  Deservedly nominated for a Best Documentary Oscar, WINGED MIGRATION is a marvelous cinematic experience.",1139529600,4,833,5.426356589147287
1920038,1,B0000CGNEH,"If you like birds and the annoying noises they make, then this movie is for you! If hearing hours of bird noises doesn't sound like a fin time to you then DO NOT see this movie.

1920039,2,B0000CGNEH,"400 people spent four years working on this movie and one guy with a big ego ruined the whole project. That's how I felt after watching this otherwise beautiful, serene and sometimes heartbreaking depiction of birds in flight.

One of the principles of movie making is continuity. Winged Migration doesn't have it. One of the principles of documentaries is that one provides at least rudimentary background info on the subject being covered; Winged Migration is inconsistent. Whereas March of the Penguins had (for me) just one moment where I felt the editing had missed something, Winged Migration could have been a thousand times better than what is presented here. No frame of reference; some footage of birds that apparently don't migrate; awkward subtitles introducing the name of a bird and where they begin and end their migration; not a single bird's voyage covered from beginning to end.

To make matters worse, the entire project is not made with birds at large, rather, it's all staged. I understand from the behind the scenes footage that it was necessary to raise the birds from egg to adulthood together with humans so that the birds would be adjusted to human presence, facilitating film making, but why then is it necessary to include footage of birds being killed on a hunt and birds dying while traversing difficult (industrial) terrain? Isn't the average viewer already aware of the difficulties birds face? If this type of footage is so important, why leave out commentary that could describe the setting, the motivation, and the result of human environmental intervention on bird populations chances of survival, for example?

What bothered me most though was the lack of continuity and the hopping around from one continent to another and back. With regard to the sparse commentary, it sounds like the director decided he would provide the commentary himself rather than a trained actor or voice-over specialist.

All in all, this movie doesn't do credit to the effort of the many humans and birds involved in its making. I hope that someone will be allowed to rescue the remaining many miles of footage and create a better product. I'm sure there's a more interesting story in it somewhere.",1139011200,11,2213,5.005434782608695
1920040,5,B0000CGNEH,"In one of the special features, you learn that the filmmakers actually hatched the birds they filmed flying at close range and trained them so they take off and return on command -- most of the time. Then they took their birds to the parts of the world where they would live and migrate in the wild and filmed them in flight. The birds had learned to get use to the sight and sound of what looks like a bicycle with wings on which the videographer and a pilot rode along with them. This special feature of the making of the movie was actually more interesting than the movie.

Be prepared for occasionally seeing a bird get killed or sadly left behind, or....shot by hunters!! Bad hunters!",1138579200,3,689,4.425196850393701
1920041,5,B0000CGNEH,"Now, I can't say I have listened to this movie with it's audio, ever.  I've rented the movie on two occasions and turn on my own preferred music, usually progressive/new age/chanting to set the pace for the cinematography.  The footage is outstanding, amazing at the least.

Such a wide variety of birds shown flying the sky, at jaw-dropping camera angles.  I'm disappointed at fellow reviews, but they seemed to be more interested in facts than imagery.  This is not a movie for learned content, it is purely a film for wonderful footage of wonderful creatures flying the wonderous flies.

I recommend the viewing, especially under an intoxicated state.",1136419200,,654,5.0092592592592595

When I ordered Winged Migration, I was worried that the repackaged edition wouldn't have the same features as the original release - the Special Features information for this release was not available anywhere online.  Thankfully, I took a chance and my fears were assuaged upon arrival.

This repackaged version with the 3-picture-band cover appears to have the same special features as the original release, such as the 'Making-of' documentary featurette, the full-length Director's Commentary, a featurette on 'Creating the Music', a 'Photo Gallery with Filmmaker Commentary', Interviews, Bonus Trailers, Animated Menus, Scene Selections, and Weblink.  The only difference, as best I can tell, is the cover/packaging... and the reduced price.",1135296000,35,1015,5.445859872611465
1920043,2,B0000CGNEH,"What a total disappointment. I am shocked at all the wonderful reviews I see here on Amazon. Nominated for best documentary? I'd hate to see what it was up against. I learned nothing from this film... Oh wait, let me correct myself.. I learned how far different species of birds fly. Big deal. I can get that information out of an encyclopedia. The only reason I gave this 2 stars, was simply because of the cinematography. It was awesome, but thats all it had to it.

As stated in another review, the narration is not only barely existent (I would have liked to know what the birds were doing such as when they ""walked on water""... Mating call? Male supremacy? Just having fun?).. I'll never know, because we are never told anything. The little narration that there is, is from a mono toned, boring, unenthusiastic man. YAAAAWN. The soundtrack was pathetic. Since when did a high pitched 12 year old boy singing in french become enjoyable to listen to? Who wants to hear that?

Without a doubt, you will learn more and get a lot more out of watching a migration of birds on the Discovery Channel or Animal Planet FOR FREE. This is BARELY worth rental fees, unless you want to see nice camera work.

BOTTOM LINE: BORING!! Do yourself a favor and get ""March of the Penguins""... Now thats one kick a** bird Documentary!",1134518400,3,1317,4.572033898305085
1920044,1,B0000CGNEH,"Are you kidding me? How can so many people give this such a high rating? The ""uplifting"" music constantly detracted from the sounds of nature. If you are going to have a narrator speak English, have him speak English. This French guy with marbles in his mouth was not an enhancement to the film.(If you think I'm biased against French people , I gave five stars to MicroCosmos).

  Even if they fixed the above problems it wouldn't take away from the fact that the whole damn thing was staged. Trained birds do not a nature documentary make. Just watch the ""making of"" featurette on the dvd and you will see how they set up all of their shots. They also constantly harrassed the birds. They would be kicked out of most Wildlife Refuges and National Parks for doing half of what they did.

  Excellent cinematography though.",1133395200,22,823,4.602739726027397

1920046,5,B0000CGNEH,"The photography is spectacular -- When you watch this movie, you feel as though you're flying with the birds above and through the clouds on their incredibly long migrations.  This is indeed a work of art. I gained a new appreciation for the beauty, strength and endurance of these creatures.  There is also a sadness, when you realize that, through the mindless, senseless pursuit of power and riches, our government is engaged in destroying the habitats that sustain these and all other wild creatures.

1920048,4,B0000CGNEH,"I gave this great piece of work 4 stars instead of 5, as I felt

the producer and director had an agenda of their own in making this film, rather than documenting the true migrational patterns of the birds.  True migrations have been natures way of sending all species, indicators of seasonal change and harmony on this earth.  The films photography was excellent, but much of it was staged for sensational effect.",1125792000,,414,4.722222222222222
1920049,3,B0000CGNEH,"In the spirit of March of the Penguins, I rented Winged Migration, last year's much talked about bird documentary. While I will agree there are some truly amazing shots in Winged Migration, some of which have apparently never been caught on film before, the sound track is great, and you get to see shots from all around the world. Geese flying by the Twin Towers, sea gulls migrating in such large formations they look like a giant thunderstorm cloud, and birds I have never heard of narrowly escaping a snowslide. However, there is basically no narration. in the 1.5hour movie, there is maybe a total of 15 min of narration. While I totally understand the desire to let the birds actions speak for themselves, there are several instances when a little explaination would have been great. One particularly amusing scene shows this weird giant-quail looking thing making a very strange thumping noise. What were they doing? I don't know, because no explaination was given. This was the case for several scenes. So ingeneral, it's a pretty amazing movie, but at times i had to really struggle to keep my attention on it.",1123459200,5,1119,4.833333333333333
1920050,5,B0000CGNEH,"I saw a documentary that came along with the european edition of winged migration -- they made this documentary by training birds and flying behind them with a movie camera in a silent helicopter-like rig.

They also filmed on a freighter, in larger cities, in industrial eastern europe, in rural areas, etc.

The project took years to do; it was, yes, a highly planned, scripted, and expensive film to make. It took a lot of teamwork and expertise.

The cast and crew endured extreme climates and altitudes, ranging from arctic to desert. They filmed in heavy rain, mountains and valleys, marshes, etc.

The viewer can come to appreciate the bird's survival instinct, and their adaptation to conditions that range from inhospitable to lethal, to people.

Artificial? Yes, very. The traditional approach, of a naturalist roughing it can not feature migratory animals. They are stationary in one geographical zone, for example, the rainforest in central america, and usually in one season, such as spring. They can observe the behavior of toucans and parrots in spring, in their habitat in the panama canal region.

I fully recommend ''winged migration.'' They fulfilled the title's promise; it showcases the conditions that birds endure when they fly across continents. The explanations are given in written captions, which identify the species, and its migratory path.

The film quality is superb, and the documentary relies on the landscape and the birds' journey, to explain the conditions that the species at large, faces.

It is beautiful, and to be honest, it made me cry.",1122163200,6,1578,5.13671875
1920051,5,B0000CGNEH,"What a tremendous film.  ""Winged Migration"" takes the viewer to sights and heights not possible for man - along migratory paths with several species of birds.  During their 2000-, 3000- or even 4000-mile journies, we are witnesses to the trials, hazards and obstacles they face.  It's hard to imagine these creatures enduring this journey twice a year, every year, especially when one considers the multiple dangers at every turn.  Yet they do.

Environmental hazards, predators, weather, and of course, the worst hazard of all - man himself.  It was particularly upsetting to view the ""hunting scene"" in this film.  Imagine  flying 1000 miles or more to get to your breeding ground, only to get shot out of the sky by some Saturday-morning hunter.  Nice.  Viewers beware - although this film has great beauty, there are some equally disturbing scenes.

Some reviewers have complained that parts of the film were not real, or ""staged"" with ""bird actors.""  These people are missing the point.  In order to tell the story of these birds, to get close enough to them, the producers had to use birds that were comfortable with their presence.  The birds used for these scenes were raised by humans.  This should in no way take away from the power of the film.  In fact, it enhances it, because we are able to get closer to them than would be possible if the producers tried to use wild birds.

In closing, I can't recommend this film enough.  Those who are able to appreciate these awesome animals and the hardships they face may be moved to tears.  That's how good this film is.

Five stars.",1120867200,3,1588,4.747252747252747
1920052,5,B0000CGNEH,"This is without a doubt the most beautiful film I have ever seen. It is not only astonishingly beautiful, but it is also quite interesting. The birds themselves tell the story with a bare minimum of intrusion by subtitles or voice-overs.

I suppose if you are looking for a detailed scientific study, this might not be your kettle of fish. But I am just astonished at how beautiful and interesting it is. A Sunday afternoon well spent! I'll be sure to watch it again.",1119139200,4,467,4.559523809523809
1920053,5,B0000CGNEH,"Four years of film footage were edited to make this incredible film on the yearly migrations of birds, mostly the large water fowl, from the Arctic Circle to Antarctica, with North America, the Amazon and Africa in between. Facts about the flight patterns are briefly put on the screen, the longest journey followed is that of the Arctic tern, flying 12,500 miles. The panoramic scenery is spectacular, with a scene of an Arctic avalanche being very memorable. Yes, much of the film is manipulated, but the beauty of it is undeniable, and it's educational in the sense of seeing these birds in action, in their living and mating, and the miracle of their migrations.

Not all of them make it, and it shows how some journeys are cut short by predators, whether shot down, or eaten by a larger creature, or in the case of a tern with a broken wing, getting attacked and devoured by a hoard of crabs. Some of these depictions are devised to tug on our heart strings, and might not be suitable for young children, like the unfortunate goose that gets stuck in urban sludge, and another bird whose nest is in the path of a threshing machine. The filmmakers state that the tern and goose were rescued after the scenes was shot, and one assumes that the thresher was hopefully stopped in time.

The pelicans in Africa, brilliantly colored parrots in the Amazon region, and penguins in Antarctica are unforgettable. The greater sage grouse, with spiked tail in all his glory strutting his stuff in Idaho, and the Northern gannet diving into the Arctic sea, looking more like a missile than a bird are also images that stay in one's mind. This film was directed by Jacques Perrin and Jacques Cluzaud, with a crew of fifteen cinematographers, among them Thierry Machado, and it has a lovely peaceful score by Bruno Coulais. Both Machado and Coulais were part of the creative force behind the mesmerizing 1996 ""Microcosmos."" Narrated by Philippe Labro, ""Winged Migration"" has won many awards, and was nominated for a Best Documentary Oscar. Total running time is 98 minutes.",1119139200,3,2063,4.792134831460674

The watcher is inmerced in a world both alien and familar as the lives of these birds are pertrayed in a most human way.  Each bird has its own story to tell about the joys and hardships of its ever going struggle for life.  The music choices for the film are exquistly matched with each scene insuring both happy and sad tears to gently fall from the watcher's eyes.  This film portrays the most basic human emotions through the eyes of its feathered souls.

To do so, it leverages some great music to serve as a musical background to the photography of some of the world's most extraordinary landscapes.

Though I personally don't care as much about whether the birds were staged or not, I did find the movie to fall short in one respect. Many times throughout it, you wonder what you're looking at. What country are the birds overflying? Whether they were or not the same birds you saw before, etc. However, if you put that aside, this is a great nature film.",1116720000,8,673,4.608333333333333
1920056,2,B0000CGNEH,"A number of reviews, including one of Amazon's spotlight reviews calls ""Winged Migration"" a documentary.  IT IS NOT A DOCUMENTARY.  All of the birds shown ""migrating"" were imprinted as chicks, to accept humans (and ultralight aircraft) as companions, and then the birds were shipped in containers to various locations around the world for the film's ""migration"" shots.

The fact is, NONE of the footage in this film is of migrating birds.  It's all staged.  A few scenes are even abusive, such as having birds drink from a rusted automobile radiator.

""Winged Migration"" left my family with the same question as other Amazon reviewers, namely, ""What was the point of this film?""  No information is given about the birds, other than their species names and the distances they travel every year, so even as an educational video it serves little purpose.

Even with all these qualifiers we gave this film 2 stars instead of 1, because it has several scenes of incredible landscape beauty, along with a shot of gannets diving into the ocean to fish that's simply amazing.  But please don't confuse ""Winged Migration"" with non-fiction or with documentary.  It is neither.",1115856000,20,1166,5.026041666666667
1920057,5,B0000CGNEH,"Winged Migration, by Jacques Cluzaud is an amazing film. The cinema-photography is breath-taking. If you have the chance to watch this on a wide-screen HDTV you will be even more captivated.  The film is a documentary based on the life, habits and migration of several species of birds. The film takes you on a world-wide journey, across many lands from the beginning of the migration to their final destination. You as the viewer are flying with the birds in their perspective and point of view. You get to experience this amazing journey first hand and also the trials and tribulations associated with this instinctual, annual ritual. The film is only slightly sprinkled with narration when necessary to educate the viewer or describe scenes.  It's peaceful, relaxing and captivating entertainment that will leave you with a deeper understanding and appreciation of our wildlife. This film is educational as much as it is entertaining. Despite the subject matter, you might assume it to be dry and boring. Don't be deceived by this. Although it's a documentary, this film is in a league of it's own.  You will like this film if you: enjoy nature-documentary style films, or enjoy great cinema-photography and story telling, or in the mood for watching something totally different than traditional hollywood style films. This is an excellent movie I highly recommend it.

1920058,4,B0000CGNEH,"All these gloating reviews are right on the nose, what an intimate tribute to our fine-feathered friends!

And it's not merely your generic National Geographic visual of glorious flora and fauna from round the globe. If you savour a well-made film, or if you are an aspiring documentary producer, this one's a must-watch. I hesitate to call it a documentary, it's so riveting it's nearly a silent film with a cast of thousands.

The production values are stunning and make you frequently wonder How They Did That. The answer to which is a combination of gliders, balloons, helicopters and a special type of aircraft known as the Ultra Light Motorized craft that had a camera tied to it. It took 2 years to film this hour and a half. If I may, the 'screenplay' is fantastic.

Then there's the creative employment of sound. Often the only background score is the fluttering of wings; the cameras get so close we can see the birds' muscles straining as they thump the air.

Nature's rhythm is so balanced one cannot help but wonder how magnificent its choreographer must be. One species of cranes does a sort of dance, almost ballet-like. At least until one of them tumbles over. There's something strangely elegant in the way a flock of predator birds swipe at other birds in the air, or do synchronized swimming on the surface of a lake. Even a relatively grotesque scene with crabs chasing down an injured bird carries along with it a struggle to survive on both ends.

It isn't all pretty pictures though, the film has a subtle undercurrent against man's tinkering with nature. The freedom of flight is suddenly interrupted by hunting, and the score abruptly ends as a gun is fired and a goose falls struggling from the sky. One shot somehow makes a duck decoy in the water scary. Agricultural machinery invades the nest of a hatchling. In another scene, a company rests in an industrial plant, avoiding many obstacles but finding danger in an oily mess.

The beauty of the film lies in how it achieves a sense of natural endurance. Birds have been doing this for as long as they have existed, but a juxtaposed shot of the World Trade Center reminds us how all of our technological and architectural wonders are, in the wider scheme of things, trivial and fleeting.

I do have a minor gripe. The seasonal migration of birds is still quite a mystery (birds fly the same exact route, often thousands of miles, year after year) but the narrative provides little insight into its secrets, content instead in naming the different species and the distances they fly. This was perhaps a directorial decision, there's a lot in the film that needs no language, but still one that I shall deduct a star for.

Treat yourself to it at least once, you'll be struck with awe and envy for those wings in the sky. And what an impeccable gift this DVD should make for your discerning friends.",1106265600,11,2876,4.681188118811881
1920059,5,B0000CGNEH,"Winged Migration is by far the most visually stunning documentary I have ever seen, and it stars some of the most beautiful birds of this continent. I actually saw it twice in the theatre, and I was so mesmerized to see what an amazing journey the birds endured during migration season.

Aside from the impeccable cinematography when capturing the birds on film, it was also quite educational to learn how the birds survive the weather, finding food, and guiding the younger generation. The birds migrate in a group, and sometimes they may not make it to the final destination, because they get shot by the hunters in the wild. I was very disturbed to see that scene. There are some comical moments when the some of the birds have a peculiar behaviours, such as the way they dance or swim or sing. It really showed the characteristics of individual kind of birds.

The soundtrack is very enjoyable, because it is well coordinated with the birds movements. The ""making of"" in the dvd's special feature is worth watching, because they show you all the behind the scenes and the complicated preparation and training of some the birds including the Canada Geese. It was kind of like Anna Paquin's Fly Away Home.",1105401600,4,1207,4.742857142857143

Many times throughout the film I was moved to tears at the beauty that was unfolding before me, and with the addition of the exceptional score, I felt that I was being transported into the sky to fly among the graceful creatures. This is by far a brilliant piece of art!

The supplemental feature included on the DVD that explained exactly how the film was made takes away nothing from the film itself, though I suggest that this be viewed only after watching the main feature.

The crew put two years into developing the idea of the film, putting together all the camera equipment; training the birds and crew, and plotting the course the birds will follow. The Film is hands down the most beautiful thing you will ever see. The angles that they shoot these birds at make you feel like you are flying right with the birds. You will sit there and wonder how they did it and then you can play the special features and they will tell you. Don't let this slip by you.

1920063,4,B0000CGNEH,"I saw this in the theatres and found it to be a stunning film.  I like birds but am not a bird lover.  I am a fan of films such as Baraka and the 'qatsi trilogy so this one seemed like a film I'd enjoy.  And I did.  I went in with no expectation which was probably a good thing.  It was a visual treat.

The amazing thing about it is that there is no trick photography used.  You'll fly with a bird's eye view through miles and miles of country, city, industry, farms and amazing vistas that are a treat to watch.

I bought the DVD and have yet to watch it again in one sitting.  I put it on the other morning because I find the music and even the very brief narration found throughout the film to be peaceful and meditative.  Yet about half way through it I found myself sitting on the couch in peaceful repose just watching.  And it was quite hypnotic and relaxing. There are a few moments that shatter the stillness but never enough to ruin the overall impact of the film.

If you find yourself easily distracted or are looking for a documentary in the typical sense, this may not be the film for you.  But if you've got some time and want a little quiet time with some stunning photography, give this one a try.  It's really pretty cool.",1100476800,5,1241,4.159663865546219

It is like watching one of those tv specials where all the magic tricks are explained. Interesting, but you never look at them the same way. The doc will explain how it was all done. It took A LOT of the mystery away for me. They're well done, but I now regret knowing HOW this film was done. I dock it 1 star for its cheesy music - it SUCKS.",1099612800,7,634,4.120967741935484

1920066,4,B0000CGNEH,"A film by Jacques Perrin

What we have here is a documentary about birds in flight.  This is a simplistic description, but an accurate one.  This documentary film follows the life of migratory birds from the beginning of their flight all the way through to the end, which is really just the return to where they started.  What makes ""Winged Migration"" different, interesting, and beautiful is the level of video photography in the film.  I have no idea how it was done (I didn't watch any of the bonus features on the DVD), but the camera was right next to the birds in flight, so the viewer has the closest approximation of being in flight as is possible while watching a movie.  The close ups of the birds in flight are absolutely amazing.

Visually, ""Winged Migration"" is a stunning film.  The narration, however, is very brief so we are left with mostly just the images of the birds.  An example of the narration is these sentences, ""For many birds in Europe the journey's end is Africa.  But many will fall by the wayside.""  These two sentences comprised the entire narration for at least a ten to fifteen minute sequence.  Narration is hardly needed for this film to be captivating.  We see the hazards of migration: the weather, natural predators, hunters, farmers, and the environmental impact of man.  We see incredibly beautiful landscapes from a bird's eye view (in this case, literally).

""Winged Migration"" is a visual film.  This is the appeal of it.  It is really the best National Geographic film that has ever been made, except that it wasn't made by the good people at National Geographic.  But, that is the style of ""Winged Migration"".  Knowing what style of documentary this is should help you decide if this is a movie you want to see.  It is visually stunning, but there is very little narration.  You are watching birds in flight.  I thought it was beautiful.

1920067,4,B0000CGNEH,"""Winged Migration"" (2001) deserved its Oscar nomination for the remarkable depiction of birds in flight. French filmmaker Jacques Perrin has created a beautiful work of visual poetry, with its landmark cinematography and judicious editing. Perrin occasionally goes overboard in terms of the musical accompaniment (he should have deleted the forgettable song that plays during the credits). However, these are minor flaws in light of the documentary's numerous strengths. If possible, try to see ""Winged Migration"" on the big screen.",1099008000,7,532,5.746835443037975

This, fundamentally, is the gist of the most tiresomely tedious, hiney-numbing excuse for a movie I have ever seen. Yes, the camera work is extraordinary -- both in execution and in raw beauty. Yes, the birds are beautiful and majestic and all that. Yes, the birds fly a long way on their migratory routes. But, oh my glory, have mercy on my aching rump!

So earnestly deadly is this movie that in a scene where a batallion of crabs stalk a wounded bird -- a scene intended to depict the dark side of the majestic Circle of Life and the sad, lonely end of a difficult-yet-noble journey -- my family was rooting for the crabs. The narration is bizarre. After what seems like hours without it, some Frenchman comes on to announce in somber tones how ""Ze winter snows, zay bring disaster to zeeze hardy travelers."" Jacques Cousteau is dead, so who *is* this guy?

The worst part about this movie is that most viewers love it - or at least *claim* to. We have yet to find anyone who hates it as much as we do. 'Fess up, people!

""Winged Migration"" makes you want to pave the wilderness and poison all the helpless creatures therein. The movie has become a household joke -- the gift we threaten to buy each other at birthdays and Christmas.

Whether you love birds or not, you will walk away from a viewing of this film with a renewed appreciation for birds and a greater understanding of their lives. It captures the beauty of these creatures in a rare way that not many other films have been able to do.

One thing I especially loved about this film was its music, so much so that it put me on a search for more work of the same composer (Bruno Coulais).

But the rest of us can become totally immersed in the lives of these birds in a way that is not possible with typical documentaries. It is emotionally enthralling and is a visual masterpiece. By ""tagging along"" with the different species as they migrate we enjoy breathtaking views of geography and gain a whole new compassion for the bird's ability to endure vastly different weather conditions. Now as I gaze above when birds pass over, I have a whole new appreciation for their lives.

1920071,2,B0000CGNEH,"I fully agree with the other reviewers, but I didn't take as kindly to the movie as a whole.  a few points:

1.  There should DEFINITELY be some sort of dialogue a la PBS nature shows, so you actually LEARN something while watching the nice shots.  This movie was killing my brain after a while.

2.  This movie is the ""Faces of Death"" of wildlife.  Not in the good way, but rather watching the whole thing only to find out most of the movie was staged with captive-raised birds flown in different locations, instead of a real look at migrating birds.

3.  I'm almost certain the description on the DVD case claims the movie is about the migration of a flock of birds, and the journeys they take to do it.  Turns out, it wasn't even close to that, but rather different shots of different birds, and almost all the shots were just staged (see 2).

Overall, the movie was just too long and shallow.  They made a few scenes to keep your interest (crabs, traps, and hunters), but without a real story, narraration, or ANY form of useful information, it doesn't sit well as a movie OR a documentary (I certainly wouldn't call staged flights with pet birds a documentary)

It's a real shame, they could have done so much more with the footage.  All it's really good for now is cutting it down to a 1/2 hour and showing it at an I-MAX theater.",1092873600,11,1336,4.378048780487805

I am rating this film 4 stars for the beauty but will never get the image of a chick taken from their parents and eaten right in front of them. Too bad that is what I will remember the most from this film. Call me a ""whoose"" but I don't know why death had to be included in this film, we all know it happens, but was it necessary?

1920074,5,B0000CGNEH,"Numerous times in numerous reviews you will read reviewers condemning this film for its lack of the basic principles of documentary filmmaking.  I cannot state enough that the directors of this film never intended it to be viewed as a documentary, even going to the point to state clearly that their work was NOT such a film.  So why would reviewers argue a point from which the directors themselves wished to distance themselves?  Maybe ignorance, maybe selective memory; who knows, but a documentary this movie clearly is not.  I have also heard several reviewers complain about the film's message.  I thought as a political tool this film was extremely muted.  It portrayed the realities of migratory species and the increasing difficulties that they face in an increasingly developed world.  This is reality, not politics.
Much has also been said that the directors `cheated' by imprinting birds to the camera crew to make those memorable camera shots.  While this is not a revolutionary concept (Bill Lishman performed a similar task leading a flock of geese from Ontario to Virginia a few years earlier; his exploits were the loose basis for the film Fly Away Home), it is I believe the first time it has been used at this magnitude.  Research is also being done to determine if this technique can be used efficiently in guiding new migration routes to help protect endangered migratory species such as the whooping crane and trumpeter swan.  While it is less than ideal and certainly not natural, the process may be necessary to ensure that these animals can survive extinction.  And taken in the context of this film, I believe this procedure is permissible given the principle of the film (whether intended or not).  What Winged Migration instills most in the viewer, after its visual beauty is digested, is to promote awareness about not only the magnificence of these creatures, but their plight and the increasing difficulties that accompany seasonal migration.
For more information on specifics of the film, there is a good review at documentaryfilms.net
(On a side note, a few reviewers have questioned what happened to the birds after filming.  In an interview with Perrin, he stated many of the birds stayed with their imprinted parents in Normandy, while others were taken to nature preserves of which the filmmakers developed a relationship with during filming.)
There is no doubt that this film will not appeal to everyone.  It is over an hour of footage with little or no dialogue, and I think the pace of the film may be a problem for some.  But Winged Migration is undoubtedly visually stunning; of that you can be assured.  I would encourage anyone, even those who would normally be turned off by its subject matter or its message, to see the film regardless, for it is a visual delight and is well worth the time.",1087776000,15,2837,4.903765690376569
1920075,4,B0000CGNEH,"I've seen many a great nature film, but this one goes straight into the next dimension! Only a few minutes into the film and I knew I was hooked! I was astonished at the way that Mr. Perrin was able to capture these birds, all backdropped by some of the most magnificent vistas seen! The film's realism was such that I was constantly trying to figure-out how Perrin did it! Was a small camera strapped to one bird from each flock, just before their migration? I felt somewhat stupified by the wonder of it, perhaps in the way that a chicken would look at a card trick. Imagine flying alongside these creatures as they go from place to place, getting ""A REAL BIRDS-EYE VIEW""! I've never seen anything like it!
As great as it was, I didn't care much for the intro speak at the beginning of the film. Why it is that the ""Lords of Most Nature Films"" seem hell-bent on stating that the beginnings of life started some 400-million years ago is beyond me.

1920077,4,B0000CGNEH,"First of all, let me say that I very much enjoyed Winged Migration, and that it has captivated the many people I've shown it to.  Why have I shown it to so many people?  Because our 2-year-old son loves it, and people happen to be around when we watch it.  We've watched it at home with friends and family.  We've watched it while visiting my parents on their TV.  We've watched it on my laptop in airports.  He loves watching anything about animals, fish and birds, but he especially loves Winged Migration.  I suspect it's something about the lack of narration, the way the birds move with the music, and some of the incredible closeups.
That brings me to my only criticism of this film, if you could call it that.  We purchased this movie under the assumption that it was a nature documentary.  Though it is spectacular and very enjoyable, I find it somewhat misleading to call it a documentary.  Other than the odd snipet of information about the individual species and how far they fly, it really isn't much more than a beautifully filmed music video.  OK, they fly far.  Got it.  Our household watches a lot of David Attenborough nature documentaries on DVD, and we love them both for the visuals and their educational value.  That said, it's hard to categorize Winged Migration as the same type of film.  It's much about art than it is about learning.",1086134400,4,1358,4.576763485477178

I've always wondered how these birds can migrate so far and through such often-harsh weather, to get here.
Now, because of this excellent movie, we know a lot more about this incredible annual process.
The movie lets the birds tell their own story to a great extent, and it is so carefully put together, my wife and I and even our Greenland Husky Nuna, watched the video with our mouths open.
This is not a happy time Disney-type movie ---sometimes the birds run into hunters or urbanization as they make their long journeys. But the overall spirit of the movie comes through --we get to literally fly along with the birds, an experience which seems unreal to those of us limited to jet planes, vehicles, trains, etc.
Maybe mountain biking through a bitter Arctic storm might be a little closer to the bird's experience. But they get here, and we are so glad to see them. And we watch them all through the brief Arctic summer, and then they are on their way back south again, some all the way to the South Pole.

It could have been a great documentary but instead they made a mediocre artsy film out of it.  They say no special effects are used, so I guess editing out the motor and other noises from the soundtrack is not considered a special effect.  The narration is very sparse and sometimes you would like just a little more explanation of what you are seeing.  The photography is fascinating but after a while my feeble American mind could stand no more French subtlety (if that is what it was) and I fell asleep.  I thought the music was just dreadful.  I give the DVD four stars for the great photography and the much more interesting ""Making of"" featurette, for which I did stay awake because it does have a comprehensible storyline and informative narration.",1084147200,2,873,4.666666666666667

And then there's the glorious shot of a wounded bird (not in the US) that gets devoured by flesh-eating crabs.  A wonderful bit of 'verite', that, but one that reeks of a 'setup' to me.

I also question some of the editing decisions that were made.  For a movie focusing on the wonders of migration, the only images locked in my mind a month after my viewing are a damaged bird falling victim to a swarm of crabs (an almost nightmare-inducing scene), gulls feasting on a baby penguin and geese being shot by hunters.  I don't think was the 'take away' the filmmakers wanted to imprint on its viewers.
For those who say these scenes depict the dangers and realities of migration, look at the ""Making Of..."" extra on the DVD.  This is not a documentary, it's (esentially) a piece of nature art staged by the filmmakers.  In fact, seeing how they filmed these scenes will really make you re-think this entire movie and see it in a new light.  No doubt, it's a brilliant technical achievement by the crew.

It is not fake and it certainly is not boring. Anyone who claimed boredom needs to have his/her intelligence tested just to confirm everyone's suspicions and stick to TV sitcoms in the future.
Because the film makers revealed their huge investments of time with animal experts to imprint, raise and train the birds who would be their ""stars,"" they are blasted by some as not being true to their art. Some of the reviewers must have been embarrassed that they thought they have been ""fooled."" I found the ""Making of"" more interesting than the documentary. Indeed, it was a documentary within a documentary.
I would have been appalled had the film makers subjected untrained birds to the intrusive shock of being filmed. Until I watched the ""Making of"" I thought perhaps computer graphics had been used. Even though the birds in the film were imprinted, there was no telling if the birds would fly off into the wild blue yonder, never to return. My heart is always with the subjects of these ""filmed in the wilds"" movies, but my fears were unbased. I felt reassured that the birds had been well cared for prior to and during the filming. Anyone who has ever owned or worked with birds will understand this film represented a monumental undertaking in creative ability, technical skill and expertise.
This is an outstanding film. I recommend it to anyone, not just birders. Natural flight is intriquing to all earth-bound humans.

Then there were some disturbing scenes started being sprinkled in. The first one ended happily enough with the goose free and with his comrades. Then a few scenes started ending not so happily. Oh, well. Not all is sweetness and light in nature. Then a couple of the scenes were positively grim. I stopped enjoying the film at this point so I stopped watching and skipped to the Making Of.
During this segment I found out how they did it and was appalled. The birds were raised by and imprinted on humans. They were accustomed to interacting with people, airplanes, and cameras from the time they were hatched. The film makes then put them in crates, shipped them to remote parts of the world, and filmed them. The images, though wonderful, are of pets performing tricks. Nothing more, and nothing less.

""Winged Migration"" - adhering to the proposition that a picture is indeed worth a thousand words - offers a soaring, visually astonishing tribute to all the cranes, geese, swans and assorted other birds that have, since time immemorial, made long and dangerous airborne treks from one corner of the globe to another.  Like no nature special you've ever seen, directors Jacques Cluzaud, Michel Debats and Jacques Perrin and no fewer than fifteen credited cinematographers create a visual poem to these feathered marvels by taking us right into the thick of the action, somehow managing to get their cameras to fly, in beautifully coordinated fashion, right alongside the birds at amazing speeds and altitudes.  Seeing is believing in the case of this film, and even after seeing it, you still may not believe it.  That's how eye-popping and visually dazzling an experience this film is.
With only minimal narration (some of it spoken and some of it subtitled), the filmmakers provide some helpful information regarding the particular species we are seeing and its migratory patterns.  But the film is far more of an aesthetic visual experience than an educational one. For long stretches of the movie, the birds merely fly along in majestic silence or backed up by haunting symphonic mood music (much of it reminiscent of the work in ""Koyaanisqatsi"").
In addition to the birds themselves and their amazing feats, the cinematography captures, with blindingly crystal clarity, the awesome beauty of the various landscapes through which these extraordinary creatures travel (there's even a shot of the birds flying past the Twin Towers).

How touching was the juxtaposition of the caged fowl communicating with the free and worldly birds flying overhead? Moving does not even begin to describe the editorial genius.
Perrin(our narrator) was also nice enough to leave his ego out of the film. Barely introducing every 30 minutes or so, and using subtitles as unobtrusively as possible, we are allowed to join this vast community and soar along the coasts of this globe.
One is grateful for the disclaimer that opens this piece: that no special effects were used to present the flying creatures we see. When we are shown such photographic brilliance as geese flying below a starry night, we know one day, if one is fortunate and perseveres, that vista is tangible.

This is not a movie, nor is it really a documentary, it is more art and the splendor of birds, their migrating behaviors/patterns shot from many different locations all around the world.

1920094,4,B0000CGNEH,"There are undoubtedly, magical moments in this film. The opening is quite entrancing ...showing the bird-flock at ground-level living, in a Belgian(?) village river engulfed by mist.
Another scene is drifting majestically, when all of a sudden ...a gunshot and a falling bird. This contrast was  jolting and deeply sadening.
Another scene, a caged bird is photographed in close-up, as he views his kin-species flying off to a far away land. Knowing just how much scenery these birds had covered (hi-lighting their freedom to do the journey) really makes seeing the caged bird's response, especially emotional.
Alot of beautiful scenery is captured. But, there isn't much variety in the birdly activities covered. Alot of flapping wings, but not much detail on their interactions with each other, and their environment. Any of their reactions to things, are from afar.(They're all 'large' migrating birds).And more atmosphere could've been given had there been some attention focused on the landscapes, villages and cities involved thru-out their journeys.
The narration was minimal, but really well done. His voice is very soft, so very appropriate. The soundtrack contains unusual choices. Some do work, but some don't. An aquired taste.
In all, it is a pleasure to see a documentary based on the 'feel' of the subject, rather than the 'facts and figures' approach. So, I hope it has set up a precedent for this under-utilized approach to documentary-making. But, I certainly believe that it was ""too ambient"" to be a 'outright' success. This would need to be adressed if they are to make an outright classic. But the 'seeds' for a masterpiece are definetely 'sown' here. There is a love for nature in this film which is truly infectious.",1077667200,2,1739,5.144876325088339

It did almost nothing to compliment the film in any way.

Perhaps to pose another question: How would you like to fly among, indeed next to migratory birds of various species and do so as if you were one of them? After seeing this film, it is obvious why producing it required five directors, hundreds of crew associates, and three years of immensely complicated effort. The result is difficult to categorize. It is a documentary, yes, but one whose primary purpose is not to explain but to reveal, indeed celebrate its migratory subjects. It is a travelogue, yes, but even while enabling the viewer to complete a transcontinental journey, the film focuses most of its attention on the birds themselves rather than on the lands and waters over which they soar.

""Winged Migration"" doesn't seek to tell a story but does so unintentionally.  It is the story of a million birds answering the pull of nature, heeding the call of instinctual collective unconscious stamping, by soaring and flapping their way over forty countries, all the continents, season by season.  And what do you know, we have it all captured on film for our enjoyment in our very own dens and enclosed sheltered spaces of the human world.
French director Jacques Perrin and his worldly film crew went through some considerable effort and even danger to bring this work of art to you and me.  Through Pavlovian bonding Perrin and Crew have raised flocks of birds to accept their ultra-lites, balloons, flying machines, cameras, as one of their own allowing these up close shots of the rhythm and rhyme of bird flight.  The end effect is stunning.
What you will realize if you should so choose to purchase these DVD is that you are getting two films for the price of one.  The ""Making of..."" portion of the extra offerings on the ""Winged Migration,"" is ever bit as fascinating as the streaming eye-candy scenes of birds and landscape and cityscape that flow by in the main attraction.  This DVD played in our house as ambient background and center stage viewing for one lost weekend.  It was peaceful.  It made an unusual connection to nature for humans sometimes relegated to the safety behind four walls.  Beware it may have a Pink Floyd ""Wall-esque"" effect so don't watch while inebriated or under other influences too terribly much at risk of addiction.  It is that mesmerizing.

1920100,4,B0000CGNEH,"I originally reviewed this when it came out in the theaters, and now that I've experienced the DVD, I'm even more concerned.  As many reviewers here have noted (to their peril!), this is not a National Geographic documentary.  It is not agenda free.  This vehicle is freighted with all kinds of ""messages,"" so much so that the beauty of the birds gets caught in the net of earnestness.
No one can deny that the visual images presented to us in ""Winged Migration"" are breathtaking and unforgettable. What is forgettable is the narration that Perrin forces upon the images. In an apparent attempt to give the film some kind of symmetry or narrative arc, Perrin tries to tie it all together with insightful commentary.
There is literally nothing interesting in the narration nor is there any information offered that any high school science student couldn't offer as well.  What's worse, there seems to be a ""birds good, people bad"" message underlying all of this.
Another annoyance is the effort to unite all these species of birds in the concept of migration. Honestly, can you honestly compare penguins and parrots with geese and finches? They may all be birds, but their stories and journeys are remarkably different.
The computer animation seems out of place as well, feeling like another attempt by the filmmakers to make the footage fit together. So much of it seems like an after-thought.  The selection of which birds to include seems haphazard.  Sure, they all look good on film, but is there truly anything unifying beyond, ""They're all birds and they move from place to place.""
The images don't need much commentary at all. The graphics tell us what bird is being featured and how far it travels. The commentary misses the most interesting aspects of the footage, namely the community of birds that we witness on the screen.  Why try to extract a unifying theme at all.  Lose the narrator and the ""story"" and just let the birds fly (or swim).
See this film for the beautiful images of birds in flight, but you'll have to forgive the awkward and contrived human element.",1076025600,,2078,4.817415730337078
1920101,5,B0000CGNEH,"Stunning. Five minutes into the movie Winged Migration my jaw hit the floor and stayed there for the next 84 minutes. If you appreciate amazing cinematography, the kind that has you saying ""how did they do that?"", you need to see this movie. It looks impossible. To look into the eyes of the Canada Goose as he soars high above Monument Valley. The Bar Headed Goose flying over the Central Asian Steppes. The synchronous dance of the Red-Crowned Cranes. The Swooper Swan, frolicking, tipping one anothers wings over green Asian fields. The Bald Eagle, making us proud, swooping down to land seemingly on top of the camera. It took my breath away, literally. It's 89 minutes of sublime, resplendent natural images. There is little narrative, and no human dialog, but the soundtrack is excellent. Making good use of all 5.1 channels, surrounding you with the wind and calls of the birds.  I loved the music, although some say it's a bit bombastic. There's an excellent ""making of"" documentary that explains how they got so close to the birds that's almost as amazing as the movie itself. It's also astonishing that no special effects were used in filming the birds.
A warning: If you have absolutely no interest in nature, especially birds, you may lose interest once the novelty wares off. Also, there are hunting scenes that some will find disturbing. Most people will love it though. The most amazing meditation on nature I've ever seen.",1076025600,4,1438,4.869387755102041

1920107,1,B0000CGNEH,"Though there are stunning shots of migrating birds, along with a few interesting views of other bird behaviors, these hardly compensate for the appalling narration and inane score. One wonders how this film could possibly have been made -- and how it got any awards. The raw footage is some of the best ever taken of birds in the wild but it is trapped in one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time.
If you loved this film in the theaters though, renting or owning it might be worth your while. If you do you will discover some things on the ""making of"" extra that may change your mind. Among other things, the geese used in the seemingly remarkable scene of landing on the ship at sea are, in fact, tame and were brought there by the film makers[!] the pelicans, also tame, were crated and shipped to Africa to be filmed there. While nature documentaries often use clever editing of footage taken at different times to tell a story, this is going to far!
What's even more frustrating about this fill is that excellent and visually stunning documentaries about birds have existed for some time. (The BBC's 'Life of Birds', ASIN B000069HXL, is outstanding.)",1074643200,22,1162,4.591346153846154
1920108,5,B0000CGNEH,"One fellow reviewer found some scenes in ""Winged Migration"" to be ""bizarrely orchestrated"". If Mr. ""One-Star"" had bothered to listen to the director's commentary, he would have heard Jacques Perrin state: ""This film is neither fiction, nor a documentary."" This breathtaking nature tale no more pretends to be a ""documentary"" than ""The Bear"", ""Never Cry Wolf"", or even ""Walking With Dinosaurs"", ever did. Closer in spirit to visual tone poems like ""Koyaanisqatsi"" or ""Baraka"", ""Winged Migration"" is best enjoyed as a purely sensual, almost meditative experience (no -I'm not a New Age looney, just a fan of pure CINEMA). Many memorable scenes; a segment with graceful white swans landing on snow is one of the most transcendent movie moments in recent memory. For once, the ubiquitous DVD ""Making Of..."" featurette is not the usual self-stroking ego-fest, but as fascinating as the film itself. It turns out that our principal ""stars"" ARE in fact, ""actors"", who have been raised from hatching by members of the film crew, who have developed a remarkable communication with the birds through this imprinting process. When you learn that several hundred people risked thier lives daily for over four years, travelling the globe to produce this amazing 85 minutes for our entertainment, it reveals the ""It's just a bunch of boring birds flying around!"" reviewers to be even more clueless than we already suspected. Unique, mesmerizing music score features vocals from 80's Goth-meister Nick Cave (a Wim Wenders regular) and venerable prog-rock fixture Robert Wyatt (ex-Soft Machine).",1074643200,7,1579,5.294820717131474
1920109,4,B0000CGNEH,"I saw this wonderous film about 48 hours after having sat through the extreme tedium of ""Russian Ark"" and as you have probably guessed by now, I have never seen two more contrasting films in quick succession than these two.
""Russian Ark"" is a film essentially about death. It is cold and frozen, a sepulchre to forgotten history filmed in a moribund intellectual vaccuum that sucked all life and colour from the screen. Even people I know who enjoyed it fell asleep in it.
""Winged Migration (or Travelling Birds as it was screened in Australia)"" could not have been more different. Full of life and energy and colour, film experiences like this only come along rarely.
The viewers are carried aloft on the wings of birds and we fly with them on great voyages. The birds become characters we want to travel with (and are at least alive - which is more than can be said for Russian Ark). Not that it is all plain sailing - the natural world is full of dangers and threat (and actuality) of sudden - and not so sudden - death does rear its ugly head.
Everything is displayed in magnificent colour, with wonderful cinematography and a sensitive soundtrack. The only thing really wrong with this film was the slightly irritating voice over - but the Nick Cave song at the end made up for that!!!

1920111,5,B0000CGNEH,"By now there should be no question about the visual beauty of this much-acclaimed film that captures, not only birds in flight, but breeding, feeding and in countless surroundings, not only natural but man-made as well. Filmmaker Jacques Perrin spent years of production, thousands of miles in traveling and countless man-hours in training, not only the birds, but the intrepid team of naturalists and film crewmembers that were in large part responsible for the well-being of their subjects. No matter how you slice it, it's a towering achievement of documentary cinema.
Or is it? The fascinating extra feature details how the flocks of geese et al that are seen in the film were trained from hatching to ""imprint"" on humans, so that they would stick close to people and filming them in flight would be possible. There are vivid accounts of the numerous difficulties the production crew encountered in shipping their charges to remote locations, releasing them, following them in dangerously fragile-looking flying machines (especially invented for the film), and hoping the birds would do their bidding.
Ultimately, the troubling question that was raised in my mind was: to what extent can this be called a ""documentary"" when so many scenes were in effect staged for the camera? Certainly watching the feature alone, with its laconic titles giving facts about various species, their flight paths and distances traveled gives no clue of the immense preparation involved. Also, what happened to the birds once filming was finished? One doubts they were simply released into the wild to live normal lives.
All this is not to take away from the astonishing visuals that resulted, but to suggest that the viewer needs to know more about the exact nature of this film than is evident from simply seeing the finished product. To this end this is a DVD whose extra features are truly of value.",1073952000,3,1887,5.051282051282051
1920112,3,B0000CGNEH,"If you are awaiting the documentary reincarnation of Robert Flaherty, you will be disappointed.  While the film unconsciously shows us what birds do, it never succeeds in imparting a broader understanding of the great Winged Migrations of its title.  After a while, all the birds started to look the same (most weren't very colorful).  Most of the film focuses on the movement of birds in the Northern hemisphere, and only touches on the Southern hemisphere birds hurriedly towards the end of the film.  Do the Southern hemisphere birds also migrate Southward?  Northward?  Why or why not?  It mentions others who migrate in different directions, but quickly and without direction.
This was a beautiful and enjoyable film.  I did not feel at all bad about watching it for two hours.  I would buy it (on sale).  But it fails to be truly enlightening and its not going to make my top ten list for 2002, let alone the decade.",1073865600,2,922,4.7784810126582276

1920115,5,B0000CGNEH,"I got this film expecting to watch for a half hour or so.  I'd been amazed at short clips I'd seen, but thought -- How interesting can it be to watch birds flying?  Well, I wound up watching the complete 90 minutes -- so did my husband, so did our children -- and then I watched all the extra dvd features as well, because once you see the film you'll HAVE to know how they got the footage, and that is almost as fascinating.

Some people will be upset to know that the action is largely ""staged"".  I was at first.  But as I began to comprehend the enormous effort and commitment involved by all the participants, who imprinted the hatchlings and then spent hundreds of hours with them, I began to appreciate that it was quite an impressive project.  Same with the inclusion of several people in the film -- at first it was jarring, but then I decided I was glad to see a few positive interactions between the avian and human world.  Filming takes place all over the world and with many different species, including grebes, storks, pelicans, parrots, penguins and several species of geese.  While the filming is spectacular in general, occasionally there are shots that will take your breath away.  Caveat: There are also a few scenes that will take explaining (or distraction, if you're alert) for the youngest viewers -- hunting, an injured bird eaten by crabs and a quail nesting in the path of farm equipment -- otherwise of inspirational beauty for the whole family.  After we watched, we talked about birds, read stories about birds, drew some pictures of birds and then went back and watched our favorite scenes again!

The dvd extras are a must!  In addition to director's commentary, there is a 52-minute featurette show the imprinting and bonding process and the use of scaffolds, ultralight planes, gliders, ships and hot air balloons for filming, as well as the many problems (and their solutions) encountered during filming.  Another featurette depicts the composition and recording of the soundtrack (17 min).  There are also interesting and informative filmmaker interviews (25 minutes), a trailer and narrated stills.  Minimal narration is in English, and subtitles are available in English, Hindi, Portuguese and Spanish.

I was glad to hear that the birds are now living in Normandy under the supervision of 7 caretakers, with hopes of turning the area into an educational reserve.

1920118,3,B0000CGNEH,"Ahhh... Now it is clear to me why, despite having adored this film when I saw it on the big screen last spring, I was unable to write a review of it, until now.  The reason is, sadly, that the film is a fake.  A skillful, mesmerizing fraud, but a fraud nonetheless.  In the theatre, we all thought, ""oh! how did they get that shot!"" and ""wow -- I never knew birds did that!""  But watching the DVD -- or, more precisely, the behind-the-scenes featurette that we all knew would be on the DVD -- it all becomes apparent why the birds were so strangely accessible to director Jacques Perrin and his French film crew.  The reason is that the majority of the birds seen in the film -- the Canadian snow geese in the Southwestern desert, the stately pelicans on the coast of Senegal, the elegant cranes perched astride one another atop Saharan sand dunes -- were all hatched, imprinted, conditioned and trained to perform as ""actors"" by Perrin and his crew.  These birds didn't migrate to these picturesque locales; they were shipped there in cages and posed amid various props and scenarios.  Their handlers whizzed before them, in jeeps and ultralight planes, honking bicycle horns and shouting ""Allez! Allez!"" (the sounds the birds had been trained to respond to) as the somewhat befuddled birds tried to please their bipedal, Gallic surrogate parents.
Setting aside the issues involved in presenting these carefully engineered scenes as representative of ""instinctive migration"" (I'm sure that *real* nature documentarians are fuming about this film...), this is also disturbing because the filmmakers never fully disclose the results of their inter-species machinations.  Does this mean that the scenes in which birds die were also engineered by the director?  When, for example, some adorable ducks waddle into a toxic waste pit in Eastern Europe, seemingly of their own innocent accord, is it actually because they were plopped there by a cynical and callous film crew, sacrificial lambs to the aesthetic and political sensibilities of their human ""friends""?  When a goose is felled by a hunter's bullet, were the hunters trucked onto the set as well?  Did Perrin and his grad student scientific cohorts feel any affection for or responsibility towards the animals they had raised, or were the birds mere props?  And what happened to the dozens of avian actors, once the filming was over?  Did they continue on as a research project at some university somewhere, or did Perrin and his crew have  celebratory dinner of roast fowl and liver pate afterwards?  The DVD, neither the feature film or the ""making of"" featurette, doesn't deal with any of the ethical implications of their work, and though I thought the film itself was a work of jaw-dropping beauty and amazing technical wizardry, learning the real story behind its production left a bad taste in my mouth.
( Initially, I would have given this a 5+ rating; then, based on what I learned about the production itself, I leaned towards a ""wish-I-could-give-it-a-zero"" 1... So, let's split the difference, and call it a ""three."" )",1073174400,116,3085,4.940038684719536

It had all of us gasping for breath and choking back tears from the sheer grace and beauty of the birds and of our world.  I never before have wished so much to be reincarnated as a bird.  Gorgeous!
The hunting and trapping scenes in this film are appropriate and neccessary, not just to pull at our heartstrings, but to emphasise the pure danger in the migration - from *all* angles.  It might make you sad to see the geese fall from the sky - and it is part of the circle of life - and it gives me more respect for the work they do twice a year.  Amazing!
I am a fan of Jacques Perrin, from his previous film, Microcosmos (I highly recommend it) and had no idea this was also one of his, until about 30 seconds into the film.  He is gifted and inspired.

Perrin uses minimal commentary, and instead concentrates of showing a slice from the life of many different breeds of birds.  He and his crew put forth immense time and effort to incorporate themselves directly in the lives of the birds they filmed.  They were able to travel closely with these birds without disrupting their normal routines.
Most of the scenes are presented directly from a bird's point of view, close to the birds themselves.  I found the scenes with the Eurasian cranes and greylag geese especially enchanting.
What some of these birds can endure, and prove capable of, may surprise you.
If you love birds (especially waterbirds) as I do, this movie is a must-have.  Even if you don't ordinarily care about birds, the soaring freedom, agonizing effort and eventual triumph of their twice-yearly journey will reach you. You will find yourself really pulling for them!
The film is helped along greatly by Bruno Coulais' haunting and evocative soundtrack. Although it doesn't really seem to tie in directly with anything at any particular time, it nonetheless seems to follow the emotional current of what's on the screen.
Winged Migration is both inspired and inspirational.  I can honestly say I've never been more deeply moved by a film.  Do yourself a favor and get a copy of this movie!",1072915200,5,1522,5.015873015873016
1920124,3,B0000CGNEH,"The birds are shown up close and personal in gorgeous natural settings.  For the most part, the film will take you places and show you scenery that most people are unlikely to see in their lifetimes.  It's relaxing, tranquil, and occasionally dramatic from the human elements thrown in.  You may have new appreciation for the aesthetic details mother nature has given many of her feathered creatures and for nature in general.
The only problem:  this is not a nature film!  After watching the extras I felt defrauded by this movie.  This is not a film shot by naturalists observing wildlife with their cameras.  It's a film that was completely scripted and staged using birds that have been trained since birth to perform their various acting roles in this theatrical masterpiece that maybe should instead be named:  Cirque Du Soaring.
At the beginning of the film a title proudly announces that ""No special effects were used in the filming of the birds.""  Maybe so, in the strictest interpretation of ""special effects"", but to me, you are not watching nature, you are watching trained animals perform tricks on staged sets.  Bird handlers release birds from cages at the right moment to achieve some dramatic cinematic effect.  Film crews create rustic sets and stage scenes that look great ... but none of this should be confused with the term ""documentary"".
Again, this is a beautiful film, but don't be taken for a ride:  it's not a film about nature.  Knowing this will prevent ""dramatic"" disappointment.",1072915200,6,1509,4.940476190476191

I'd almost recommend first time viewers to watch the making of the film before watching the actual movie as it explains a lot of things like the fact they imprinted the birds as hatchlings (the reason why the movie favours geese) and that it is neither a documentary nor a fiction. You take it as a quasi documentary with beautiful scenery and moving music.
The film itself was powerful but I felt that the behind-the-scenes featurette enabled me to fall in love with the movie from a different point of view.

The cinematography really does beggar belief. I kept asking myself ""how could they have gotten this shot?"". The answer is provided in the must-see 'making-of' featurette supplied with the DVD. The crazed ambition and commitment of the director and crew left me feeling great about humanity: this film is about much more than migratory birds. It is about doing something so thoroughly and so well that the result draws in people who normally wouldn't care for your subject... and makes them care too.",1072396800,5,747,5.032258064516129
1920127,3,B0000CGNEH,"While the photography is superb, considering it's all low level, meaning it's well under the normal ceiling of migrating birds which normally migrate well above the 100 feet normally shown in this ""documentary"".  Anyone that has studied the migration of waterfowl, would know this DVD does not document or tell the story of the true migration that takes place.  Where are the shots of geese flying at 15,000 feet in flocks of 100's??  Where are the skies filled with v's of geese and ducks as far as the eye can see??..
This is all low level stuff that can be filmed on most marshes, reserves and bayous in the US and Europe.
I'm offended by the hunting scenes, farming scenes where the ""poor"" hard working birds are ""preyed"" upon.  Give me a break!..  Do you expect knowledgeable people to really fall for this?  Obviously you do, or you wouldn't have put it into the film, but it really doesn't do justice to the rest of the work that should have been showcased.
Sadly, there are many other great films documenting migration without the dumb heart string tugging inclusions. Perhaps we should have a documentary about the poor fish being slaughter by the beautiful hard working migrating birds??  You seem to show a LOT of this....
Watch the movie for the low level photography, but as a documentary, it's quite poor and doesn't begin to scratch the surface of the ""winged migration"".

1920128,1,B0000CGNEH,"Viewer beware: the filmmakers have an Agenda. It is not to bring the viewer spectacular footage of birds in flight, although that is the vehicle they use to suck the viewer in so that the Agenda may be passed on.
The Agenda is anti-industy, anti-hunter, anti-technology, anti-companion pet, and anti-mechanized farming, just off the top of this reviewer's head.  This means that in the course of your viewing experience you will be subjected to *staged* images of mechanized farm eqipment seemingly running over and shredding a baby bird in its nest, a prejudicial depiction of goose hunting, a goose being kept in a pen while wild geese fly by (privately keeping migratory birds is illegal in this country), images of another goose covered in oil in a polluted stream, geese drinking presumably coolant-contaminated water presumably leaking from an ancient-looking rusty pickup truck that is staged to look as if it has been left sitting at the side of a scenic highway for decades, a scene of a wounded bird being attacked and devoured by crabs on a beach, and a staged escape of a presumably wild-caught Hyacinth macaw (which the director acknowledges is not a migratory bird, but he wished to make a curious statement about animal ownership) from a ""trapper's"" boat.
In fact, more is staged than not.  Most of the groups of birds are captive-raised, human-imprinted birds, which makes the director's lament about animal and specifically bird ownership even more curious. The crew did not, as advertised, follow wild migratory birds along their natural routes for any of the scenes depicted, they instead brought their own birds to the locations and carefully staged the flight routes and sequences and camera shots.  This is quite a feat, but it is not what was advertised, and there is certainly no mention on the box cover that the viewer will be subject to manipulation towards the director's biases on hunting, pets, technology, and the like.
The flight photography is magnificent, though not entirely authentic or necessarily realistic. One would not find Canada Geese flying over a desert highway at an altitude of ten feet, for example, but that's what one gets when leading one's own flock in a motor vehicle.
Recommendation: view it on cable for the pretty pictures, but keep in mind that you're going to run a gauntlet of disturbing images calculated to manipulate your opinions, but don't buy it and finance any more of this kind of bait-and-switch agenda-mongering.",1072396800,29,2481,5.031630170316301

Being a big 'animal' person I eagerly took my like-minded girlfriend to see this after hearing only little about it. We were in awe for 90 minutes of it, and HORRIFIED for 15. After the 1st scene of one of the birds dying, I felt like I couldn't enjoy the movie anywhere near as much from that point as you never know when, out of the blue, something terrible would happen. Reading the other reviews here, I am shocked that others didn't have the same reaction- it seems so 'front and center' to me.
I know it is a documentary, not a 'pro-bird' film- I understand why you would want to show nature as it is- beautiful and savage. But I think the director/s made a horrible decision to leave in some absolutely heartbreaking and terrifying footage of the animals being killed or hurt.

The movie has stunning images and it's at its best when showing animal behavior. Unfortunately there are too many 'birds in distress' scenes, with the distress usually coming by way of humans, which take us out of the world of the birds and into the world of a 'message' movie.
Spoiler: distress scenes like hunting, drowing in oil, caged for market, about to be run over by a combine.
If these scenes were fewer and shown in matter-of-fact manner, maybe I'd have liked the film better. But the reaction shots of the birds were obviously picked for their emotive quality, and the music played during these scenes is overly leading, so that the effect tends toward smugness.
I wished the filmakers would have stuck to showing the incredible alien beauty of birds and their behavior in a more straightforward manner. The 'story elements' of death and distress worked against what they should have been going for.",1071014400,11,928,4.879746835443038

1920139,5,B0000CGNEH,"Winged Migration (Jacques Chazaud, Michael Debats, and Jacques Perrin, 2002)
That Winged Migration was robbed of the Best Documentary academy award drives the final nail into the coffin that holds what few shreds of legitimacy the Academy still had. Chazaud, Debats, and Perrin have created here not only a work of great beauty, but something that may (if there is any justice in the world) change the way documentaries are made.
An aside to some of the reviewers who obviously didn't get it: this isn't about characters, plot, and theme. It's about flying birds. If you want characters, plot, and theme, go watch the nauseating piece of tripe that stole the best documentary Oscar without even being a documentary. When you want a real film, give this another try.
Winged Migration is, quite simply, ninety-five minutes of stunning cinematography. No more, no less. With a bare minimum of subtitles (the bird and its migratory path is given for each set of birds the filmmakers tracked) and only slightly more narration by Perrin, the veteran actor of the trio (recently seen in Brotherhood of the Wolf, but no doubt best known for Cinema Paradiso), Winged Migration forces the viewer to concentrate on the birds, the places past which the birds fly, and the various hardships the birds have to endure, both natural and man-made.
The true brilliance of the film's mostly silent take on things can be seen repeatedly, but perhaps never so well as a scene about thirty minutes into the film, while the filmmakers are tracking Canadian geese through the American west. One goose gets separated from the flock by a mustang stampede, of all things. The others take off before the lone goose can see them again, and by the time the dust settles, they're out of sight. The lone goose honks a few times, then wanders, for all the world looking dejected, behind a tumbleweed. It is as powerful a snippet of film as has been seen in any fictional drama. And the movie is full of little pieces like this.
Winged Migration was criminally neglected in theaters, only seeing limited American release even after its Academy Award nomination. You were cheated of seeing it on the big screen, most likely (and one can only imagine after renting it how much more powerful it would have been when thirty feet wide), but don't cheat yourself out of it altogether.

1920141,4,B0000CGNEH,"Twice a year, birds make long pilgrimages -- migrations -- to find food and to raise their young.  Some of these migrations are merely hundreds of miles; others longer than 2500 miles, crossing continents and oceans.
Directors Jacques Perrin, Jacques Cluzaud, and Michel Debats and their team spent four years and crossed seven continents to capture these wonderful creatures in their migratory patterns,  With stunning cinematography and breathtaking scenery, they put the viewer both above the birds, giving a view of the world as seen from the skies, and at eye level with the birds, flying and gliding alongside them, making the viewer feel as if he/she were part of the flock.
Interspersed with some narration and music, they rely much on visuals to show how and why the birds migrate, to show the hardships they must face, such as weather and natural predators, and to display how mankind is making an impact of them through hunting and pollution.

1920145,5,B0000CGNEH,"Footnote: Actual Official Review: **** 1/2 stars (four star and a half rating)
Unbeknownst to the prevailing abiding aristocratic cinematic world mood of obliviousness to all things natural except in the most fervent degree of mindless environmental ferocity, nature apparently seems to only exclusively receive mention through the one-dimensional prism of vapid unspecifics. These trite simplifications of lushly boundless fact into chronically simplistic fiction is quite common throughout the film industry: exploitation of nature for political ulterior intentions, the general absenteeism of nature from view unless it's scripted to instantly underscore some usually cheap deadpan emotional resonance from audiences, or it's inbred invisibility as background unless previously fashioned as scapegoat for narrative laziness appears relentlessly in an incommunicable number of films over the years. This constant oversight has been the preceding extent for how corporate film pseudo-sophistication has afforded the natural world in the frighteningly shallow cinematic landscape that is modern film today. It takes the miraculous discovery of something so undisputedly priceless to once again allow one to swell in unrestrained awe at what still is dazzlingly unexplainable in the real natural world.
Winged Migration (2001, French original title: Peuple migrateur, Le) lavished upon all the cinema going multitudes of 2002 a unprecedented and wholly unanticipated bountifully fertile untarnished tapestry of the untamed physical world with the infinitely ambiguous wonderment and dizzyingly uncontrolled amazement that effortlessly made pale all the Burly Brawls, digital interstate car chases, and animatronics robotic sophistication that you're ever likely to see from going to the movies this year or last. Co-directed by Jacques Cluzaud, Michel Debats (assistant director on Himalaya (1999)), and Jacques Perrin (also the film's ""lively"" narrator and financial producer), Winged Migration was an improbably painstaking four-year documentary film project that in truly bewilderingly epic form gallantly attempts and conclusively unnaturally accomplishes unnaturally to crowingly focus on the spring and fall migrations of over a dozen species of birds around the globe , as they unflinchingly travel across the unending countryside, transcontinental oceanic divides, and the brutal violations of the archaically blind elements to reach their summer and winter resting places before the treacherous immovable progression of the seasons finally catches up with them. It's an astronomical biological race against time as the lives of untold flocks of pelicans, albatrosses, south Atlantic king penguins, bald eagles, geese of all denominations, and the levitating dominion of flying birds everywhere encroachingly invade upon the inarticulate inexpressible promised lands of their own birth where millions expire along the way and millions more are breathed into existence. This premise may sound very absurd to those weaned on the technologically vacuous bins of mindlessly ridiculous entertainment that obstinately gag the imagination of tomorrow's adults (yes please, can we watch See Spot Run, Good Boy, Cat in the Hat, or Scooby Doo, can we Mom, can we, can we?). Increasingly though the dramatic life and death results of Winged Migration's pristinely rendered families of birds on the run from nature's densely unforgiving clock is so much more moving, in all the absolute concrete conviction of that word.
Bewitchingly hearkening wordless grandeur, gliding on the adamantly unspecified unlimited fringes of mystic atmosphere over pressurized sky, these mystic weightless ambassadors of expeditious flight have agelessly inspired numerous laments on the immeasurable vastness of nature, here is another mercilessly inspiring flabbergasting ode to the incalculable wonders that lay beyond human identification. Riding the bottomless untold expanses of furiously relentless sky and unyieldingly lasting longer than recorded time itself, birds remain to some an eternal bridge to the unconscious will of cosmic inception. These fluttering endlessly ascending vessels of peerless clandestine design aerodynamically master the inconceivably unfathomable and morally unwitting every single day of their essentially anonymous lives. Yet there is no hesitation no lapsing of fundamental responsibility to live on, to carry the seed of antiquity to the next generation, and inscribe the craft of memory to the physically monogamous allegiances of the future. The congenital disposition and abstinent resolve to pass down what once was to what will be remains agelessly stupefying no matter how many times you experience it.
These thousand, multi-thousand, and hundreds of miles of globetrotting that compose those grasping strides for life are splendorous and astonishing in of themselves, and yet they invariably take place equally in the ethereal pressurized envelope of space just as judiciously and fatefully as below beneath the shadow of gusting air as life's numerous channels of providence and circumstance work themselves through to their inevitable conclusions. Waiting there in the camera's lens by their side, you encounter and witness the unwontedly uncognitive wilderness of causality as what must be done is ultimately achieved given the will of nature's equilibrium. The randomness of slaughter as an undefended baby penguin chick is left vulnerable for the submissively compliant lunges of gratification, the biological terrorism of removing the fruits of one breed and remorselessly replacing them with another, the instinctive deployment of problem solving skills desperately needed to emancipate one from captivity, and the elastic charismatic expanding of nature to fill all of those little problems that may just have palpable answers beyond the enclosure of understanding allows, including the contorting of a fish to invariably go down one's throat more effortlessly. For these birds, existence remains the attainable only through the incomprehensible of the never-ending. As you attentively witness the perceived balladic ballet of weightless enveloping masses of birds breathlessly cascading across the endless mammoth body of insurmountable sky throughout this incredibly accomplished film, you view the intangible all-encompassing purity of nature unviolated and unblemished by man's sometimes sanctimoniously shallow and peripherally narcissistic viewing of her.
As for the DVD edition of Winged Migration, it includes an impressive 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen presentation, a ravishing Dolby Digital 5.1 audio track, director's commentary, documentary supplements, and so much more.

What? Geese, swans, storks, ducks, etc., etc.
Where? From Canada to the Himalayas to South America to Manhattan. You name it.

Birds are much more close to humans in behavior than we could imagine in our wildest dreams. There are feelings for every taste: familiar relations, jealousy, envy --there are two birds that seem to be 'fighting' which has the more beautiful tail--, love and an incredible taste for ballet. Yes, if you don't believe me, go and see the movie.
It comes with no surprise that such delicate work was produced, written and directed by Jacques Perrin, the same man behind the documentary 'MicroCosmos'. 'Winged' received a deserved nomination for the Oscar. But it is not the main reason to watch this movie. If you think your life is hard, think again. A bird's life can be even worse-- and more beautiful too.",1067990400,9,1357,4.803418803418803
1920149,3,B0000CGNEH,"There's no doubt: there are many beautiful scenes in Winged Migration.  You've never seen anything quite like this, and I commend the filmmakers for being able to ""fly with the birds"" the way they did.  When the Canada Geese fly through the snowstorm, or when you see the baby bird jump off the cliff and fly for the first time, your jaw just drops at how amazing it is.  It will be nice to see the ""Making of"" section of the DVD.
That's the good.  This is the bad:
1. No information.  None.  The movie will tell you which birds you're following, how far they need to fly, and then you're on your own.  What do these birds eat?  How often do they stop?  When do they mate?  You will receive no answers.  Occasionally the film will show you some birds ""dancing,"" or in the case of the grouses, making amazing noises with sacs in their chests.  I can only assume it's part of some mating ritual, because there was nothing in the film to tell me.  This irritated me.
2.  There were parts of this film that were obviously staged, and usually that's ok.  But I take issue with how it was done here.  I believe the filmmakers were trying to show how humans pose a danger to migrating birds.  In order to do this, they proceeded to film some hunters who were obviously aware they were being filmed (and probably hired by the filmmakers), shooting and killing birds, as we watch them fall from the sky.  I know hunting birds is legal, but in a movie where the whole idea is to show the wonder and grandeur of these birds, this message and the blunt way it was delivered was out of place.  There are other examples of this, as when the combines rush towards the baby bird in the wheat field, with appropriately scary music accompanying it.  Just not in the spirit of the film.
3.  The length.  I could be very wrong, but I kind of feel like these French filmmakers were trying to outdo the BBC and Discovery Channel, both well known for their nature documentaries.  If this film would dish out some helpful info once and a while, I could have comfortably sat for an hour and a half.  But as it is, it gets old fast, even with the great filmmaking.
I would say, rent it, watch it once, and then go to PBS and Discovery to actually LEARN something about these birds.  The BBC made a great series a while ago called The Life Of Birds, which I highly recommend over this film.",1067990400,17,2363,4.303854875283447
1920150,4,B0000CGNEH,"For anyone who can appreciate a good nature documentary (think National Geographic special, or IMAX nature film), Winged Migration is a must see.  The many shots of birds in flight, taken from a camera that is cruising along with the flock, just feet away, create a visceral feeling of what a bird's-eye view must really be like (and as the rest of the film shows, the view while flying is probably the best part of being a bird).  The geographic settings are spectacular (they include the Arctic and Antarctic, the American Southwest, the Sahara Desert, the Amazon, and just two cities, New York and Paris), and show that much of this planet, including the most stunning regions, is outside the scope of normal human experience.  However, man and birds do interact, and the scenes in which they do are thought provoking and carry an obvious message.  The musical score is well matched to the scenes, and the very minimal narration, which just serves to state the obvious, isn't needed at all.
Now, the young kid's eye view:
I took three girls to see this film, aged 8, 7, and 3.  The 3 year-old's favorite scenes were the cute baby birds interacting with their parents.  She enjoyed the flying scenes a little, but quickly tired, and once she had eaten her fill of popcorn and candy, she was ready to move onto something more exciting.  The older girls initially liked the flying scenes, but since they don't know enough about the geography of the planet to appreciate all the different settings (they did recognize New York and Paris on their own, but that's about it), they got bored.  They also liked the cute animal scenes, including the rock hopper penguins, but there weren't enough of these to hold their interest.  The scenes of birds meeting their demise didn't appear to affect them (and after all, the death of Bambi's mother is much more traumatic), but this also means that they didn't get the message that the filmmaker was communicating.  All in all, I would definitely not recommend Winged Migration for young kids.  Now, could the filmmakers have made a film that would have succeeded in appealing to all ages?  Yes, but it would of necessity have had to lose the subtlety and unobtrusive style that undoubtedly makes it appealing to many adults.",1067817600,17,2264,4.7621483375959075
1920151,5,B0000CGNEH,BEAUTIFUL! FASCINATING! HEARTWARMING! I never realized what great lengths these wonderful creatures go through to migrate.  I have such tremendous respect for them.

1920152,5,B0000CGNEH,"Unparalleled cinematography allows the viewer to soar with so many types of birds (primarily geese and ducks), many times at eye-level with the birds. You see, hear and feel the effort that goes into every stroke of their wings as the birds make their way from migratory start to finish. And there are spectacular  moments of serendipity, such as the decoy scene. All these elements equal outstanding filmmaking. The movie stirs the conscience and conscious, too, helping us realize we MUST care for our environment and the creatures with whom we share this planet, without beating us over the head with a zealous ecological message.
  The soundtrack at times lifts you with the birds, and at times is little more than repetetive Euro-pop trash; however, the images on-screen draw your attention more than the music. The narration is sparse and not overdrawn. The concluding song has a haunting beauty that makes me mist over even as I recall it.
  The specs and features listed promise an excellent DVD product. I could watch this film over and over again, and I look forward to owning it on an excellent medium. If you love our earth and the winged marvels with whom we share it, you will love this movie. Guaranteed. If it fails to win for best cinematography at the Oscars, I will be disgusted. It's arguably the best documentary of a season of many fine documentaries.",1066262400,13,1373,4.8008474576271185

1920154,4,B0000CGNEH,"No one can deny that the visual images presented to us in ""Winged Migration"" are breathtaking and unforgettable.  What is forgettable is the narration that Perrin forces upon the images.  In an apparent attempt to give the film some kind of symmetry or narrative arc, Perrin tries to tie it all together with insightful commentary.
There is literally nothing interesting in the narration nor is there any information offered that any high school science student couldn't offer as well.
Another annoyance is the effort to unite all these species of birds in the concept of migration.  Honestly, can you honestly compare penguins and parrots with geese and finches?  They may all be birds, but their stories and journeys are remarkably different.
The computer animation seems out of place as well, feeling like another attempt by the filmmakers to make the footage fit together.  So much of it seems like an after-thought.
The images don't need much commentary at all.  The graphics tell us what bird is being featured and how far it travels.  The commentary misses the most interesting aspects of the footage, namely the community of birds that we witness on the screen.
See this film for the beautiful images of birds in flight, but you'll have to forgive the awkward human element.",1065398400,5,1282,4.962616822429907

What strikes me most of all, however, is the way I felt about what we humans must do to better care for our earth so that the cycles of life (vividly and empathetically revealed here) may continue. I thank the filmmakers for allowing the painful scenes to last just long enough to make their points and let us stay focused on the empathy side. What a wonderful world we could have if those in control of the news media and governments would take the same approach and homan beings could live lives focused on the creative work at hand, alert, yet unafraid of ambiguous situations, and well-prepared to raise future generations in the same way.

1920157,5,B0000CGNEH,"This is one of the most beautifully shot films I have ever seen.  There's no plot, there's hardly any narration.  The focus of this film is the birds as they travel thousands of miles with the changing seasons.
I must admit, this is not the type of movie I would ordinarily see.  Nature films don't usually hold much interest for me.  However, I had heard there were a couple of beautiful shots of the birds flying past the World Trade Center, which happens to be in my neighborhood.  I knew this might be my last chance to see the Twin Towers on the big screen, and that was what originally prompted me to see this film.  And while that was the most beautiful part of the movie for me, the entire show was visually stunning.  As someone who loves to travel I thoroughly enjoyed the shots of the birds in their various environments, from Siberia to the Amazon to the American Southwest.  The scenery is breathtaking, and the aerial shots of the birds in flight were simply gorgeous.

The photography is breathtaking, with views taken from hot air balloons, ultralight aircraft and even satellites.  Again and again I found myself wondering ""How did they do that?""  The musical score is wonderful, never intrusive, and is complemented by a very spare narrative and occasional subtitles giving the names of the birds pictured and the distances they migrate.
There are glimpses of the hazards faced by the migrating
flocks--hunters, trappers, ecological damage, other predators--but these are not overwhelming or manipulative. Scenes of avian family life, mating ""dances"" and rituals are delightful and create a real bond with the audience.  Above all, one is left with a sense of awe at the mysterious forces that draw these beautiful creatures on their seasonal flights.

1920163,5,B0000CGNEH,"My ex-wife could never understand why I (the original couch potato) could never get enough of nature shows on TV.  It was rather difficult to explain how fascinating I found the natural world, especially from the comfort of my own living room.  And admittedly, some of those WILD KINGDOM episodes were kind of hokey.  (I remember how betrayed I felt when I found out that Jim and Marlin had staged most of the good scenes and hadn't actually ventured to the wilds of Africa or the Amazon.  Maybe they were just couch potatoes at heart too.)
But French filmmaker, Jacques Perrin and crew are certainly the real deal.  This breathtaking documentary is one that I would unqualifiedly recommend--to just about anyone.  Even my ""ex"" called recently to let me know that this film had left her in tears.  I found it equally moving, and plainly I wasn't alone.  In fact, when I saw it the whole theater burst into applause at the end.
As others have noted, the camera work on this film is awe inspiring.  I have seen a few television docs with this kind of upclose footage before (I think maybe the EYEWITNESS series?), but none have sustained the effect for very long, and most don't pack the emotional wallop of this film.
Between this film and the recent SPELLBOUND, I can see an expanding market for documentaries--at least the more unique and captivating ones. A great film for family viewing, although younger children may be upset by the depiction of some of nature's (and mankind's) harsher realities.

Winged Migration takes us on the migrations path of several species of migratory birds all over the world including Antarctica.  But it doesn't just stop there, we actually spend some time with each group watching them rest, eating and raising a family.  In fact, one of the most wonderful shots is of a group of geese coming in for a landing on a French Naval vessel and resting after an exhausting trip.  They basically just land, explor a bit and then have a bit of snooze on a war ship traveling full steam.
This is a film for everyone, not just those of us that like watching nature television.  There is a narrator, but he is kept to a minimum and we are left completely immersed in the environment listening to the sounds around us.

1920168,4,B0000CGNEH,"I've seen a lot of bird migration documentaries on PBS and Cable TV and I was concerned this film would be merely a big screen adaptation of those same films, but this is something more, much more. It's a superlative documentary about bird migration boasting the most fantastic aerial camera work of birds in flight ever seen. A minimal amount of narration allows the wonder of bird flight to be seen as if from a child's viewpoint of awe inspiring images so startling one is filled with momentary disbelief. The naked camera eye watches as a bird beats it's wings in flight with such physical endurance, one can't help but almost feel it's heart beating to the rhythm of it's effort. I believe it was a flock of colorful Rose-Breasted Geese that the camera documented flying through a bleak industrial European city  like an other wordly beauty against a Fritz Lang 'Metropolis' urban landscape. I loved the soundtrack music, some of it co-written by rock icon Nick Cave. It was just weird enough to offset the intensity of the natural science of migration. Only quibble, why not humor us and save that poor broken-winged shore bird eaten alive be gigantic sand crabs? I know this isn't Disney but it's also not your run of the mill cold nature film.

Gorgeously filmed, realistic, historic (lots of famous sites) and instructional all the while being thoroughly uplifting for the viewer.  Yet, it does not sugarcoat nature's process.  Anyone who sees this film and it does not stir the environmentalist that may be buried inside needs a viability test to see if they are really a live human being!  I have to own it for my own collection.......Just start engraving the Oscar right now!",1057708800,3,602,4.75
1920170,4,B0000CGNEH,"This is a work of art that took director and co-producer Jacques Perrin four years to film. Amazingly, the five crews involved used no special effects to film the birds, but instead used a huge variety of equipment including gliders, balloons and helicopters to track the various birds on their long distance migratory journeys on routes that encompassed as many as 12,000 miles. In fact, a special aircraft was developed specifically for use in this film. (See FILM JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL for more detail.) And the effect is in many ways a tour de force. Many of the sequences are thrilling, on occasion you actually get the sensation of flying with the birds.
This is more than just a film with spectacular footage of birds in flight; it is also a nature film that illustrates the harshness of life and the difficulty of survival for these creatures. Of course, there is the arduous nature of the migration itself, but also the difficulty of gathering sufficient food, the danger of predators (especially of the injured and the young), and even spectacular footage of a natural disaster (an Himalayan avalanche). There are also shots of the harm inflicted by humans - birds caught in industrial pollution, birds trapped for sale, and birds in flight shot by hunters as their formations pass overhead. Thus, despite its beauty this is not a film for the sqeamish. ( Interestingly, man's influence is also shown to be beneficial at times, as when a freighter is used as a resting place for some exhausted birds far from land during their migration to the Antarctic summer. )
There is occasional narration by Perrin (in English but heavily accented) and some brief descriptive subtitles regarding the species being viewed and their migratory routes, but the film is almost entirely a visual experience broken only by the sounds of the birds and the noises of their habitat. It is very moving, and the beginning and final scenes have a wonderful symmetry. To fully appreciate the artistry of this film and feel at one with the birds you preferably should see it in a theater on a large screen or at least in a totally darkened room with no distractions on a very large screen TV. This is not a movie to be watched casually while involved in other activities.
With such glowing words of praise, why not an unreservedly enthusiastic five star rating? For several reasons - first, I felt that the film would have benefitted greatly if more information concerning what we were watching had been presented to the viewers. The use of more extensive subtitles could have done this very unobtrusively. Second, to the extent posssible it would have been more interesting if it contained a better balance between examples of the larger birds which dominated the film and other species. (Maybe they found this too technically challenging.) Third,it would have been very educational without detracting from the exoerience if there had been some explanation of the techiques used and a chance for the theatergoers to actually see some of the equipment used. (I.e., let us go watch some of the filming itself. Of course, this could be included on a DVD, but this is a documentary and if presented at the start of the film would have enhanced our experience while viewing it.) It would have also addressed my final observation - that paradoxically I felt that the film was both too long and too short. It is approximately ninety minutes in length; after about an hour some of the footage started to seem repetitive. And yet when it concluded I felt that I wanted to know more and there were aspects of this incredible endeavor that were left uncovered. Thus, an introductory background which included some of the footage seen later in the film would have relieved some of the monotony which I began to experience near the conclusion. Also, my personal criteria for a five star rating include a desire to see the film multiple times and probably own the DVD, and those criteria are not met in this case. So, if the subject matter appeals to you, I highly recommend this film but it is definitely for a limited audience.",1057449600,6,4100,4.817021276595745

7999432,5,B0000CGNEH,"How does it feel to be a wing man, flying with fellow birds in a flock through 40 countries and on all 7 continents? Watch this BluRay to find out. As a viewer, I felt like I was a fellow bird amongst the flock(s) when the birds were airborne. These scenes were effortlessly filmed and edited without disturbing the flow in the flock. The filming and editing experts used their technical know-how to give us this incredible experience. And it was filmed 17 years ago!

Winged Migration is a gorgeous 2009 BluRay transfer of the original 2001 DVD. This film is in 1080P, and the audio is 5.1 SurroundSound. A few artifacts remain, but they are inconsequential. The colors are strong and spellbinding, especially when the birds feathers are shown in contrast to each other and to some of the landscapes. The sound has great clarity and depth because of adroit sound mixing, especially in certain channels.

In fact, this film was so good that it won awards for The Best Music, The Best Editing, and the Best Debut at the 27th Cesar. It was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature in 2003.

A major part of the film showed how the birds learned to take off, land, stay in formation, etc. for the film crews to capture what birds do naturally. Some baby birds were actually learning when  and how - to do these activities by following a trainer because these birds were going to be filmed. In many ways, this film looked like a Psych. 100 chapter activity. The film showcased this learning segment, and this was one of the most interesting and endearing parts of the film. One of the saddest was when the crew stopped filming the birds, and they left their trainer behind. However, creatures learn from other creatures (usually a parent) and then leave when they are mature enough to make it on their own but are usually within the same flock. This is part of nature, but as a viewer, it was very emotional to watch.

This is the best bird migration film that I have ever seen. Many friends of mine agree. The film captures the birds flying or coping with all types of weather, all the while continuing to go forward to make the migration and continue their cycle of life.

What this film so brilliantly does is capture nature  birds in their natural setting  showing viewers ever dangerous situations that they encounter. With such an intimate relationship to the rest of the birds (via the camera lens) WITHIN the flocks, viewers vicariously want to avoid danger when they see it coming, and they want to help protect the other members of their flock. Of course, we cant do this, but the cinematographer, editor, and director did such a nice job in producing this film that they made me think that we could! This is good story-telling.

What do buyers get when they purchase this BluRay? They get 1 film plus 5 extras:
1. The film: 89 minutes
2. Directors Commentary: 15 minutes
3. The Making of Winged Migration: (52 minutes)
4. Creating the Music (17 minutes)
5. Filmmaker Interviews (24 minutes)
6. Photo Gallery (13 minutes)
TOTAL MINUTES: 210 (which is 3 1.2 hours)

This instructive BluRay should be in every bird/ nature-lovers home film library. It should also be a part of every school districts science curricula and in every public library.
