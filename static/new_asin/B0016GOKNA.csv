8344298,3,B0016GOKNA,This is one of Govindas best film and I am quite shocked it did not win any awards because it well deserved it. The songs were good and the title song was the best. Rani Mukherji was good and better than she was in pyaar deewana hota hai and so was Johnny Lever. Nearly all of Johnny Levers films are funny and this film really shows this. I thought this movie was well put together and the acting was great.,1301961600,,408,4.1125
