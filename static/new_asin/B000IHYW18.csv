2656326,5,B000IHYW18,"This dvd is fantastic.  You will not be bored.  You can choose between two 20-minute workouts or do both together with only one warm-up and one cool-down with no fast-forwarding required.  I am very fit person, but I found this video challenging and fun.  Not only will you become more toned, you will lose weight with this video provided that you are working with intensity.",1175731200,20,375,4.723076923076923
2656327,4,B000IHYW18,This was a pretty good workout.  The 2nd workout was much more strenuous.,1174694400,4,73,4.615384615384615
2656328,5,B000IHYW18,"This is a great workout!  It really gets your heart in the zone!  If you are limited on time and can only do 30 minutes, this is great.  Chris Freytag is a great instructor and keeps you moving!  I have gotten real results with this one.",1174435200,2,237,4.086956521739131
2656329,5,B000IHYW18,"I love this DVD the workouts are short, but I am definitely sweating when I am done and I feel like I had a great workout. I like all of the Prevention DVDs and have never been disappointed. Chris Freytag is a great instructor.",1174348800,,227,4.181818181818182
2656330,5,B000IHYW18,"I don't do workout videos as a rule.  I am making an exception in trying to get in shape after having a baby in the freezing Midwest winter.  This is a great workout for the beginner that I now must consider myself.  It takes a few times through to get all the moves down just perfect, but once you get the moves and keep up it's a good workout to get you into the fat burning heart rate range.

Also, I agree with other reviewers in that Chris Freytag is not annoying like some of the other workout video people.  And I like that the set is simple and not some pretentious island view overlooking the beach.  I'm here to workout, not pretend I'm on vacation.

This is not meant to be a cardio workout so don't buy it for that.  It's for mid-range heart rate, fat-burning.",1171152000,7,772,4.204081632653061
2656331,4,B000IHYW18,"I always enjoy the workouts that Prevention puts together - there's so much variety that you will certainly not get bored. Your heartrate will be up, but I was never gasping for breath (which is good!) Chris definitely has a cheerful personality that isn't overwhelming. She's encoraging, motivating, and makes you hit all the areas of your body. If your looking something that really intense, this video isn't it, but I still feel it's a decent workout. And it's broken up into seperate segments, so if you are crunched for time you can just do what your in the mood for.",1170201600,9,572,4.673267326732673
2656332,4,B000IHYW18,"I would have loved to give this 5 stars. There are two workouts, a warm-up, cool-down, a strength training appendix, and even a section where they break down the moves. The only thing they could have added that, in my opinion, would have made this the one of the best out there is a thorough stretch segment. Considering how much squatting and lunging you do (which really works the quadriceps) I would have appreciated some kind of quad stretch in the warm-up, if not an entire segment devoted to stretches. So a word of warning - before you start, stretch those calves and thighs!",1169683200,38,582,4.605769230769231
2656333,4,B000IHYW18,"I like the Prevention workouts and Chris Freytag.  She's a great instructor who is motivating and fun.  She's like Denise Austin only not annoying.  She is encouraging and makes this fun to do.

To make it effective and to use variety, there are two workouts here.  Both are fat burning - good old fashioned cardio and then interval cardio.  If you do them together then you'll get about 50 minutes worth of exercise; or you can do them separately (so that's good to know for busy days or when you can't be bothered).  While it's intense, it's easy to follow along to (she's a great cuer).  I've done it a couple of times already and find it enjoyable while still getting my heart rate up and before you know it, it's done and trust me - you'll sweat a lot.  I'd say it's more for intermediate levels, but even I found it good and it's nice to have variation in your routines, so even if you are advanced, you'll benefit from it too - and if you are a beginner, you'll give yourself something to work toward.  I really like this.",1167523200,81,1029,4.340314136125654

I've exercised on and off since college, but have had trouble sticking to a regimen. I decided to do videos at home (it's very hot where I live in the summer and I wanted to exercise indoors).

Furthermore, Chris Freytag is a pleasant and totally watchable instructor who is clear in her explanations.  She is accompanied by two other exercisers, one of whom shows a lower impact modification throughout. The workout is divided into two roughly 20 minute segments plus a short warmup and cool down.  I always do the whole thing and it takes about 49 minutes--in fact, I did this video today!  I would think an average exerciser would enjoy it very much.  I haven't had it for very long, but it is on my short list of new favorites.",1401840000,4,706,4.653225806451613

You will work up a sweat with this workout, and there are many modifications throughout the dvd that make it very simple for people who want to begin exercising.  There is also a weight training segment on the main menu in which Chris Freytag outlines simple toning exercises for you to complete.  This dvd is very effective and I would highly recommend it to any exerciser.",1326758400,2,572,4.588235294117647

2656495,2,B000IHYW18,"If you're a professional dancer/trainer, or if you just like watching the results of weeks of rehearsal, get this video. However, if you actually want to DO a video workout, I'd steer clear of this one. The verbal ""heads up"" for step changes nearly always come after the move has commenced, and while a step is repeated 4-8 times the first go-round, the instructor quickly moves on to a lengthy combination of 8-10 steps that will leave all but the most dedicated fitness fanatic in the dust. Beginners and intermediates need not waste their time...unless they prefer their fitness videos for entertainment value only.  This production will take many run throughs before you can even begin to keep up, and by then you'll be regretting having doled out the cash for it.",1268265600,3,768,4.818181818181818
2656496,4,B000IHYW18,"This is a great DVD and workout. I did both 20 minute routines together plus the warm up and cool down and really worked up a sweat and got my heart rate up. I have used other Prevention DVD's featuring Chris Freytag and this one is one of my favorites. Chris Freytag is great, she is one of the few instructors on a fitness DVD that I can tolerate. She keeps you motivated without being over the top, she knows what she's doing and her queing is excellent. As far as I can figure you can burn around 400 calories if you do the whole thing, which is pretty good. I do this DVD twice a week and do other other DVD's and exercises in between so I don't get burned out doing it over and over and it works out well. If you are trying to find a good fun way to do around an hour of cardio this will do the trick, hope this helps.",1247097600,5,824,3.940119760479042
2656497,3,B000IHYW18,"exercise DVD I would not say her cues are on the money. The warm up is OK I will agree that more attention should be put on warming up the legs. The two workout themselves are a very good calorie burn and it does go by fast. This is choreographed to build the routines, which is very nice.
My biggest complaint is her cool down it has to be one of the worst I have ever done. I just do my own to get every muscle group I just worked with her.",1243468800,3,442,3.8152173913043477
2656498,5,B000IHYW18,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this dvd! I always watch my dvds all the way thru first; sometimes several times so that I have an idea of what to expect. I generally do the part that I start with twice to reinforce the moves the first time that I try it. So far, I've only done the warm up twice (back to back) and then the first 20 min workout twice. And I love it! Once you're comfortable with the moves, you can put more effort into your workout and really get your heart rate up! Sometimes I tack on the upper body workout from Get Movin' afterwards. Get Movin' may seem too simple for some, but you can always double or triple up on a particular section. My first Prevention dvd was Fight Cellulite Fast - which I also LOVE!  Turns out this may be the most difficult one but you feel really pumped when you are done. When I want to switch up to something else, I pop in my 3-2-1.  Chris Freytag is a great instructor and I am looking forward to her creating more workouts!!!",1233273600,3,965,4.127659574468085
2656499,5,B000IHYW18,"This DVD has 2 30 minute cardio workouts.  They are both fantastic!  They get your heart rate up and tone your legs, since both workouts use a lot of squats and lunges.

The fat-burning workout is more traditional aerobics, and the metabolism-boosting workout uses fast-paced intervals to get your heart pumping.  I love Chris Freytag, and she is a great instructor, easy to follow.  There are also low-impact modifications if you need them.

This is a great fitness DVD, one of my favorites I go to again and again. I highly recommend it!",1233014400,5,539,4.741935483870968
2656500,5,B000IHYW18,"As a former Firmie, I have come to be a big fan of the Prevention workouts. Chris Freytag is, using her favorite term, awesome! She is a motivating instructor who provides excellent cuing. Whether you are a beginner or advanced in terms of your workout ability, the Prevention workouts are a must.
Drop It in 30 is the latest addition to my Prevention collection and I must say that I loved it! The warm-up is four to five minutes in length, followed by two different workouts -- a fat blasting workout and a metabolism energizing workout -- and there is a cooldown at the end. If you are looking for a good 30 minute workout, you can do the warm-up, one of the two workouts and the cooldown. I did the warm-up, both workouts and the cooldown, burning 470 calories in less than an hour. I like that Freytag breaks things up into a few movements and offers easy to follow instructions, then repeats them so that a newbie gets used to the entire routine.
Add Drop It in 30 to your collection. It's a keeper!",1222992000,6,1005,4.408602150537634
2656501,5,B000IHYW18,This DVD is great.  It took me a few viewings before I got the rhythm.  Once I learned the steps I really liked the pace of it and I appreciate that there are alternative 'lesser impact' moves.,1217635200,4,193,4.1891891891891895
2656502,5,B000IHYW18,"Chris Freytag is a great aerobics instructor. She's encouraging without being too cheesy (you've got to expect a slight level of cheesiness when it comes to any aerobics video). What I like best about her is that she takes time to explain the moves in parts before jumping right into them, and she is great at cues. I never miss a beat because she reminds me what is coming up.

The first 20 minute aerobics segment is pretty fun, and not too challenging after you get the hang of it. I've started adding in a few more jumps/running in place to make it a little more high impact. The second 20 minute segment is much more challenging, and will really make you sweat! But again, it's fun.",1215216000,4,687,4.409448818897638
2656503,5,B000IHYW18,Wow!!!! What a killer workout. If you are not in good shape this is a tough one but once you are able to get through it you will know you have done yourself a favor.,1208563200,2,165,3.742857142857143
2656524,5,B000IHYW18,"I read the reviews at this site before I buy and there weren't many about this one when I bought it. But, I know Chris Freytag (she cues well and is just the ""right"" amount of perky), and have nearly all of her videos. It was a good purchase. It takes a couple of times through to get all the moves right, but they're repeated often enough within the workouts, so it's not a problem. At some point, I'll perhaps need to do both of them to be super-challenged, but one is plenty to keep your heart pumping and your body sweating. Warning! There are A LOT of lunges in these workouts, and for folks with tender knees, this could be a problem. I'll be 60 in a few months, but I've NEVER been in better shape--tight and toned--and almost back to Wedding Day weight 35 years later! Thanks, Prevention!",1208304000,23,796,4.3133333333333335

2656527,5,B000IHYW18,"This has been one of my favorite workout DVDs.  The first segment is easy but she still works your legs and gets the heart pumping.  I personally think that this first workout is more for beginners or maybe a long warm-up for the advanced.  The second segment starts off more difficult then gets a bit easier towards the end.  There is a lot of jumping and squats involved which seems to give great results.  I think Chris is a great instructor.  I usually do the entire DVD for a great, tiring workout.",1201305600,3,503,4.413043478260869

I really liked this workout's high energy routines. The main part of the workout is 20 minutes. That is VERY easy to squeeze into a day. Like some of the reviewers mentioned, there are numerous twists and turns. There is no floor workouts in the DVD.
I have numerous Freytag workouts. I did find this ones timing to be not as clear as her other workouts. (thus the four starts) That being said, it is still a very complete short burst workout.
I will purchase more of her workouts in the future.",1201046400,15,666,4.379032258064516
2656529,3,B000IHYW18,"I am really on the fence about this DVD, because while I think the workout is probably effective at keeping you in shape if you do it regularly, and some of the moves are really fun and enjoyable, I didn't lose any weight at all during the month that I did it three times a week. Also, the first time I did the first workout, it was agony to climb stairs for almost a week, because more than half of the workout is squats or lunges or quadricep work of some kind. I couldn't even complete the second workout, I was so out of breath. (I am not out of shape; I tried this workout after a few months of aerobics three or four times a week.) Further, I have to disagree with other reviewers and say that I really loathed Chris Freytag as an instructor. Her cueing was poor and sometimes confusing, and her ""encouragement"" was hollow and irritating. The music was annoying and the visual setup seemed strangely empty and bare. Like I said, though, some of the moves were really fun, especially the lower-impact moves in the second workout, and I certainly built up some leg muscle while I was doing this workout. I also liked the yoga-inspired cooldown, which is truly the best cooldown I've ever used.

Still, give me Kathy Smith any day.",1200182400,11,1234,4.412280701754386

I am in very good shape and I highly recommend this tape for all levels of fitness.  It is so fun and has lots of variety.",1195516800,2,399,3.7710843373493974
2656531,4,B000IHYW18,"This is a straight-up cardio workout that offers the choice of either two 30-minute workouts, or one 50-minute workout by combining the two 20 minute cardio segments, in addition to the 5-minute warm-up and the 5-minute cool down.

The first cardio segment, Fat-Blasting, is a heart-pumping calorie-burning aerobic workout.  The second cardio segment, Metabolism Boosting, is spiced-up with high-energy athletic drills.  You will get your heart rate up with both of these workouts.  As with all Prevention workouts, there is a participant offering a modified version of the routines and Chris Freytag's cuing is flawless.

One of the things I appreciate about the Prevention workouts are the Smart Ways To Live Well bonus sections.  In Break It Down, Chris helps you to understand the moves that might give a bit more trouble.  In Maximize Your Workout, Chris offers advice on how get the most out of your workouts.  Finally, in 4 Moves To Firm Up Fast, Chris demonstrates four exercises designed to round out your workout: the the Curl & Press Squat; the Row & Lunge; the Tricep Bridge; the Bicycle Press.

This is really easy to follow, with no confusing or rushed instruction. I have such a problem with the videos with too complicated choreography, and this suited me perfectly. I'm a normal person, not some super fit exercise elitist and can tell you that this video fits the bill for an efficient and effective workout. You don't always want to spend mind blowing effort and mental energy doing detailed dance steps, and this is a functional and fun change of pace from the more complex videos out there. This gets a thumbs up from me!",1191888000,2,659,4.689655172413793

2656555,4,B000IHYW18,"I just got back into working out after almost a whole year of not working out because of having a baby.  I've been a customer of Prevention Magazine for quite awhile and thought I'd give one of Chris' DVDs a try to do in the privacy of my home before returning to the gym.  I really like this one because it really does you a workout, especially if are doing all of Chris' moves and not the lower impact version.  I especially like the metabolism-boosting workout because combines some athletic moves into the routine without overdoing it.  After a month of doing it, a friend I hadn't seen in a month said my legs looked really muscular.  Well, that would be thanks to a lot of lunges and squats that are incorporated into this workout.  One review said the movements are awkward and not flowing but I have taken enough aerobics over the last 15 years to comment that is not true at all.  If you have a brain and have some knowledge of how aerobics go, the movements all work to achieve a good workout and make sense.  You have to pay attention to the DVD and even if you are new to aerobics, you should be able to get it after a couple tries.  Really it's not that hard.  Also, if some of the moves are causing you injury, then either you are doing them wrong or they are too much for you at that point and you should ease into them.  I have an old knee injury from college and  was weary about squats and lunges but I eased into her moves w/ no problems or injuries.  You just have you use your fitness smarts.  In the month of doing this workout I have lost 5 pounds.  Because I liked this workout so much I decided to try her Abs DVD to get my post-partum tummy in shape.",1188950400,4,1676,4.177570093457944
2656556,4,B000IHYW18,"I bought this video because I needed a change from my Reebok step tapes, and I'm impressed! I never would have believed that I would burn as many calories ""on the ground"" as on my step. Plus, it's easier on the knees.

I am 62 and have been doing aerobics for years. I also use hand weights and an exertube. Recently I read that it was more efficient to work out alternating between hard and easier periods, which my old tapes didn't utilize.

I wear a heart-rate monitor and stay within my fat-burning range and this DVD works great. Some reviewers said it was too hard in some places, but it's easy enough to follow the low impact person on screen. You have to taylor this stuff to your needs. The monitor really helps with that and I'd recommend it to anyone beginning an aerobic program so they can stay in their range. It's more efficient. The music could be better, but hey, can't have everything!",1188172800,2,903,4.433734939759036
2656557,3,B000IHYW18,"I bought this video because I'm out of shape.  She moved entirely too fast giving very little time to really understand a new step.  They do have an option where you can push a button on your remote and it'll go to an in-detail explanation of that particular move but you have to stop working out to watch it and I just don't like it.  If it was just slightly slower, I'd get more out of it.",1188172800,,391,4.0519480519480515
2656558,5,B000IHYW18,I love doing the entire DVD!  This work out is also great for those who are already very fit.  Squat lower.  Jump higher.  Make your movements bigger.  It made me sweat bullets!!!  Chris Freytag is one serious fitness role model.,1186617600,,229,4.6
2656559,3,B000IHYW18,"When I first tried this out, I started with the first workout only. I got bored pretty easily because she kept repeating the same moves over and over. Recently, I finally decided to try the second workout.  I loved it!  And doing both workouts together is a great cardio workout.  I still wish she had changed up some of the moves in the first workout, but the second workout is an interval based one with athletic drills to keep your heartrate up, and then fast paced drills to burn the calories.  And she only repeated each series once, so I always felt like we were moving on to something else.  Really, really like the second workout here.  I also really like that you can choose to do a short 30 minute workout, or play all series together for a 50 minute workout.",1186358400,4,769,4.380281690140845
2656560,1,B000IHYW18,The routine is strange and does not flow.  There are lunges with twisting which caused me to injure my knee.  Her moves are not flowing and very awkward.  I did not like this at all.,1183161600,20,182,4.142857142857143
2656561,5,B000IHYW18,This is a great workout! I absolutely love it! I have wasted my money on several different workout dvds in the past month and I have finally found the one! Chris Freytag keeps you motivated to the end. I can't wait to get her other workouts. I expect they will be as wonderful as this one!,1180828800,2,289,4.178571428571429
2656562,5,B000IHYW18,This is a FANTASTIC workout. It is very well organized and I do two segments of the cardio for one long 41 minute workout.  The first one is a little more dancey style while the second is segmented into 6 fun sections.  Whenever I do this I know I will be intensely sweating at the end of the second workout but with a big smile on my face because it was so fun!  I would recommend this one.  IT is worth its weight in gold!,1177718400,6,424,3.9529411764705884
2656563,2,B000IHYW18,"This is really a very basic beginner workout but it has design flaws. The instructor's energy is great but cuing is late, and doesn't often include anything about your form until later in the program. Almost all her cues are about breathing. No cuing about protecting your knees or back and reminders for people exercising on carpet...home video no-no. The moves are basic and nice because they are dance alternatives to the standard aerobic moves BUT she puts them together wrong. The sequence causes you to go from a moderate intensity move to a series of very low-intensity moves for awhile and back. You never break a sweat and the jumps in intensity don't make sense. Very disappointing program.",1175990400,16,700,4.890756302521009
8145458,5,B000IHYW18,"Great workout gives you a warm up, 2 workouts, and a cool down.  Easy to follow and also provides low impact options for the knees.  After you finish you really feel like you've accomplished something.  I  this video and highly recommend.",1502064000,,238,4.7317073170731705

8145460,1,B000IHYW18,"I have other Prevention DVDs that I love but this one is so repetetive. It has two 20 minute cardio workouts (not two 30 minutes like the jacket describes) and first one went through the same moves over and over. I hate that! The second workout went through the same moves twice, which still stinks but at least it's not as mind- numbing as the first. The moves were fine but I would've liked more variations.",1485129600,,409,4.394736842105263

8145462,3,B000IHYW18,"This is definitely a beginner's workout. One of the two workouts doesn't even get my heart rate up. The interval one is a little better. But these workouts are definitely not for people who already have a decent level of fitness. They just aren't challenging enough. That said, I love Chris Fretag and her enthusiasm and I find her workouts to be fun. I do this workout on rare occasions when I'm really very tired and want to workout but don't have the energy for a high intensity workout.",1477958400,,490,4.51685393258427
