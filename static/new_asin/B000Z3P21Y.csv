""Yoga Two-gether"" creates a bond between partners that facilitates strength, flexibility, intimacy, and trust!  It's such a fun way to experience exercise (especially for people like me who don't like hanging out at the gym!)",1260144000,10,363,4.838709677419355
3037815,5,B000Z3P21Y,"This is my go to video for partner yoga.  I have shared it with my friends and we enjoy doing it two-gether as well!

Jacob has a calming way of teaching and makes partner yoga easy.  His style inspires me to want to learn more.",1258848000,9,228,4.022222222222222

8234708,5,B000Z3P21Y,Love this dvd! Prefect poses for a couple. A bit challenging for beginners but we learned as we went.,1521244800,,101,4.368421052631579
8234709,4,B000Z3P21Y,"Worth getting, but I would say it is for intermediate Yoga students  - nicely put together video, and clear explanation.",1513641600,,120,5.0
8234710,4,B000Z3P21Y,"On your PC the video selection is a white button on a white background.  You have to look carefully as you move the mouse to the left of the titles.  Took me about 5 minutes to figure that out.

Short of that minor niggle, this was fun.  We will do this regularly.  Maybe there is more to it than I found, but it was only about a half hour, which is fine for a weekend wakeup routine for two.  This might take a while for us to master.",1511740800,,435,3.8863636363636362
8234711,2,B000Z3P21Y,Instructors a little creapy but I am not used to male instructors,1508112000,,65,4.5
8234712,5,B000Z3P21Y,This was a gift to my Cousin-in-law(?). Her and her fiance wanted to get into shape and practice yoga. They got this as a gift and love it. They say it is easy enough to follow along with and they feel great doing it.,1483574400,,217,3.9545454545454546
8234713,4,B000Z3P21Y,Worked well for my hubby and I. We had never yoga'd before. Some moves were a challenge.,1457740800,,88,4.235294117647059
8234714,4,B000Z3P21Y,Good exercise.,1423612800,,14,6.5
8234715,5,B000Z3P21Y,I enjoyed this flow sequence very much. I did not have much experience with partner yoga before and I now feel like I have a decent foundation.,1379548800,2,143,4.333333333333333
8234716,5,B000Z3P21Y,Jacob is a wonderful teacher and this is one of the best yoga DVDs I own. More importantly I love the way he conceptualizes and reinvents traditional yoga asanas for couples (although in all farness it's nothing compared to an actual 'Yoga Two-gether classes')...  Check it out!,1330041600,,278,4.914893617021277
8234717,2,B000Z3P21Y,"Poor production value you can hear the low tone of the vcr tape spinning the whole time, quite distracting. It is hard to follow because the instructor is not great at descibing the actions, and since you have to keep an eye on the screen at all times. Not for beginers because he does not descibe well. It is probably great for experienced yoga praticioners but not beginers as stated. And just a note I will not be bullied into removing this post by the people who made this video like he did to the last person that gave it a negative review, good day.",1328572800,10,555,4.295238095238095
