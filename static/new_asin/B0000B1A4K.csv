1909725,5,B0000B1A4K,"This is my absolute favorite movie of all time. I am also a huge fan of S Club. This movie has tons of dancing, and makes you want to get up and do the moves with them. If you are an S Club fan then you'll love this movie.
It's about an evil scientist who clones S Club and they spend the whole movie trying to get their life back. Hannah does a really funny scene with puppets, and they are dancing a lot. They perform to Don't Stop Movin, Dance, Never Had A Dream Come True, Who Do You Think You Are?, and a few more. If you haven't seen this movie yet, go and see it!",1080345600,2,570,3.8389830508474576

1909730,5,B0000B1A4K,"I have been searching for this movie for months, and I was pleased to discover it, let alone at a discounted rate.  My movie was shipped promptly, and delivered with no problems.  The movie was even in original wrapping.  I was 100% satisfied, and would consider ordering from here again.",1300060800,,288,4.72
1909731,5,B0000B1A4K,I was happily surprised to like this movie as much as I did. Not just because I got to see Jon Lee glisten. The music..... S Club! A definate for any S Club fanatic.,1183161600,,165,3.8823529411764706
1909732,5,B0000B1A4K,S Club's Seeing Double was extremely well played out and thought through.  Great music and dance as well!!,1142985600,3,106,4.888888888888889
1909733,5,B0000B1A4K,"Although Paul is not in this movie, it is still good. The music is wicked and the story line makes it funny. If you want 90 or so minutes of pure entertainment, here it is! Perfect for any S Club fan!",1125964800,3,200,3.902439024390244
1909734,5,B0000B1A4K,"If you want to watch a movie, than just watch this. It has music, comedy, drama, etc., etc.

The movie is about the band S Club. They wake up one morning to see that their tour has left without them! Never worry, S Club decides to just hang low... I mean, their tour will come back for them... right?

Unfortunatley, the gang runs out of money, and see themselves performing live on TV. But... S Club was right there, it couldn't be live... but it is and was.

A guy has cloned S Club, and the clones were running the tour, and fooling everyone in sight! It's up to S Club to make things right, but with a lot of laughs and music.

The DVD comes with extras you'll be happy to have. Interviews, games, info about the band members, all you want and more.

The movie is appropriate for ages 10+. There's nothing exactly 'unappropriate' about the movie. You see the gang in the shower, from the chest up. The gang also says the word 'boob'. It's nothing you should be to cautious over.

Overall, this is a great movie, and I highly recommend it!",1116028800,9,1042,4.290816326530612
1909735,4,B0000B1A4K,"Seeing Double, is not your average children's movie. It's not your average chick-flick... Let's face it, it's not very average at all. The story line of the brit pop band's head to stardom is meet with a conflict of the band being cloned. Sounds like a lame storyline. But Seeing Double pulls it off... And well.

The film is filled with innocent laughs for children, but also has some jokes that are aimed at adults. Both add a lot of fun to the movie. The show is well recieve thanks to the aid of Primo-uber actors (and singers) Hannah Spearitt and the beautiful Jon Lee. While this movie will never win an Oscar, it is one of the better children's movies to date boardering Shrek stardom.

Simply put, Seeing Double is a modern day, live action, Disney movie: Musical numbers and all.",1100044800,2,788,4.542253521126761
1909736,5,B0000B1A4K,"If you are a fan of S Club than this dvd is for you.  This dvd is about a scientist cloning the members of S Club and S Club trying to figure out how they can be in 2 places at once.

S Club gives their manager grief about not having a day off so when they are suppose to catch a flight to LA and they miss thier flight, S Club figures that their manager is giving them time off. Much to their dissmay, their manager was actual kidnapped and cloned along with S Club. When they see themselves on tv Live in LA when they really are still in Spain they know something is wrong. Still left with their hotel bill, the band tries to sneak out of the hotel and get to LA. They get thrown in jail for not paying the hotel bill. They finally get to LA after a few setbacks and kidnap 3 of the clones. S Club and their clones end up working together to get the evil scientist thrown in jail and then S Club and their clones get back to promoting their album in LA.

This dvd is way better than Spice World. It has a better story line. This dvd has some great bonus features and it has some great music. If you have not seen this movie yet, be sure you either go and rent it or you buy it.",1097539200,,1179,3.883817427385892
1909737,5,B0000B1A4K,"The first time I saw it, I totally fall in love with that movie! This movie is really funny and has a really good story. It's a MUST SEE for any S Club fan! BUY IT NOW!",1092096000,3,168,3.5675675675675675
1909738,5,B0000B1A4K,"I love S Club , and I always will, I was very upset when they broke up last year, but this movie basically sums up all of their series into one movie. Oh my god this movie is soooo cool.  I just wish it was in theatres here! Oh and I highly recommend S Club Party Live, especially if you've always wished to see them in concert.",1091232000,2,328,3.8955223880597014
7997996,5,B0000B1A4K,"Chronologically following their ""mirrored"" real life TV show (which is also great!) Seeing Double provides that quirk of Miami 7 (lightning bolt when they put their hands in together) with the more mature developments in their music as a band started to write more material and take direction of a more mature sound. The plot is cheesy- it's pop- like Spiceworld. It isn't mean to be something that blows your mind or creates a piece of fine art; it's a feel good movie with a ton of laughs that aren't bubblegum influenced. It dips into science fiction but ultimately highlights what S Club was about: fun, music, dancing, and friendship. It features songs off the album of the same name, but the musical highlights are:

- Do It Till We Drop
- Whole Lotta Nothin'
- Don't Stop Movin'
- Love Ain't Gonna Wait For You
- Dance
- Never Had A Dream Come True
- Who Do You Think You Are?

Not only do the members pull of acting the parts- their genuine characters make it great and the dynamic they display between each individual to another is great for a short movie. You get their personalities even if you aren't familiar. Hannah, Rachel, Jon, Bradley, Tina and Jo really put on a great movie for only having 3 weeks to film on top of other band commitments.

 The only downfall to the NTSC version is that it's fullscreen. The only widescreen edition that's been released is the PAL version (you can get it here cheap as well which is what I recommend.)",1506556800,,1454,4.496212121212121

7998004,4,B0000B1A4K,"This is not high-class filmmaking by any measure; it's more like a revisiting of my younger years, with a lot of campy fun mixed with music montages from a ""manufactured television music group."" And there's nothing wrong with that!

I explained to my wife that it was like a more modern version of the Monkees. Silly plots with holes big enough to drive a semi through, but it was good natured fun. Shut off your brain and enjoy the pop music!",1364860800,,443,4.469135802469136
7998005,5,B0000B1A4K,"This movie came out a while ago and I still watch it! This movie should have come out in America, I think it would have been greatly appreciated. S Club bring a fun variety to the film with each one getting up to their own kind of mischief. And low and behold, the S Club encounter clones of themselves! Some of today's movies for the younger crowd are horrible but this one is fun, good music and interesting throughout! I love this movie and will continue to watch it on those 'Need a Pick-Me-Up' days!",1323561600,,504,4.315789473684211
