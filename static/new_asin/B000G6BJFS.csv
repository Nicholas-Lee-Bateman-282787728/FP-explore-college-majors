Dave Stotts has done an excellant job making history come alive, as well as make sense. I've always appreciated history, but never in my 60 plus years of life, enjoyed learning it, until the Drive Thru History Programs. I stumbled across his program, when he first started on TV. His narrative made learning history fun for me, as well as connected history together, which may be the biggest difference. History text books did much to dry up my interest in History, where the DTH series woke up my desire for learning & understanding history. Great Job Dave & your fantastic team! Thanks for also providing a school program that will stimulate children (and adults) to understand our world's past. We have ALL the DTH DVDs and have purchased many as gifts.
Drive Thru History DVD's have always been appreciated gifts...All Programs/Episodes/Series are winners!!",1265414400,3,978,4.969512195121951
2600341,4,B000G6BJFS,"This 4th disk in the series focuses on Turkey and the land of Asia Minor's role as a point of convergence between Eastern and Western civilizations. While it is as entertaining as the first two disks in the series (I have not seen the third yet), it is a bit weak as a finish to the series.

One of the signs that a series has ""jumped the shark"" or is running out of ideas is when there is a ""best of"" show tacked on, as there is in this disk. For those of you who are not grumpy middle-aged men or do not watch ""TV Land"", there was a '70s TV show called Happy Days, with Ron Howard, who is now a famous movie director. A favorite character of many fans of the show was a biker named ""Fonzie"", played by Henry Winkler. When the show ran out of good ideas, the producers moved the fictional location of the show from Milwaukee to Los Angeles, and in one of the later episodes Fonzie jumped over a shark - I don't remember whether it was on water skis or on his motorcycle. At that point it was clear that the show was running out of ideas.",1170547200,3,1038,4.0634146341463415
