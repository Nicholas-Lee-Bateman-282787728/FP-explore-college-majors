8000394,1,B0000DBJCP,"While I had problems with the yoga portion of this tape (too short, required props), those wouldn't bother everyone.  For me, the real issue was that the guided relaxation is actually stressful --  the narrator speaks  quickly, warning about all the things that we *shouldn't* think about (finances, problems at work, marital issues, etc.).  It actually made me tense!  Finally, I thought that the health/meal planning advice was absurdly basic: eat organic, eat whole grains, avoid alcohol and coffee.  In short, I am selling this to my used book store and looking for another tape.",1219622400,4,583,5.08421052631579
