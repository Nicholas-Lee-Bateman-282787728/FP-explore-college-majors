8093451,5,B000BW5FAM,"Truly one of Hawaii's top ventriloquists and America's for that matter, Freddie Morris was the best!  I got the chance to see him on his first comeback show at the Banana Patch Lounge in Waikiki.  What a truly amazing show!  I wish that I could've video taped it.  We laughed so hard during the show and afterwards, met Freddie, and got several pictures with him.  I also bought the personally autographed video of the ""Hawaii's Comedy All Stars Tribute to Freddie Morris.""  Great comedians and local talent that really put their best foot forward to raise money for the ill Freddie Morris.

If you love the local culture and have spent some time in Hawaii, you will really, really enjoy this.  Heck, you'll enjoy this either way! I would put a PG-13 (maybe a R rating on some of the comedians) rating on it for some strong language and adult themes.

Great buy, highly recommended.",1248998400,,882,4.638709677419355
