8008997,3,B0001A79P8,"Coleman's work is quite good.  I'd like to see him render some positive things about life; since, as he notes, kindness has as much a place in our lives as cruelty.  Actually, most people probably experience much more kindness throughout their lives than horror.  Coleman, and people who obsess on the negative would probably be less anxious and wouldn't experience such paranoia while smoking pot if they were to look a little more at the beauty of the world.  He mentions how his Catholicism influenced his world view, maybe studying Buddhism would help him work through the muck he excavates and reveals in his work.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Art-of-Happiness-A-Handbook-for-Living/dp/1573221112/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Art of Happiness: A Handbook for Living</a>&nbsp;Corruption of the body isn't always as bad as it seems.

The dialogue between Coleman and Jarmusch could've been edited out of the DVD.  As another reviewer notes, it was lame.
Also, I don't agree with Coleman's assessment that ""nature wants us to hate.""  He feels it's in mother nature's self-interest for the ""cancer"" of humanity to war against itself so there aren't so many of us harming the world.  He claims there is more hatred now in our culture than ever, and sees hatred between races, sexes and classes as serving the same purpose.  I think the hatred he sees is actually being cultivate by the  usual culprits - warmongering elites.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/War-Made-Easy-How-Presidents-and-Pundits-Keep-Spinning-Us-to-Death/dp/047179001X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">War Made Easy: How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death</a>

Coleman's political views could use a little refinement.  He makes a valid point when he says that when we focus our judgment of evil upon characters like Charles Manson, that it deflects our attention from the evil of characters like Bush and Clinton (actually, their administrations), who have been involved in killing many more people; such as the sanctions on Iraq that killed hundreds of thousands of people and the imposition of trade policies that have imposed brutal poverty upon hundreds of millions of people.

8008998,4,B0001A79P8,"Rest in Pieces: A Portrait of Joe Coleman (Robert Adrian Pejo, 1997)

Joe Coleman. You probably haven't heard of him. (Well, okay, if you're reading this review on Amazon, you probably searched on his name, and you probably do know who he is, so ignore that.) You should have. Coleman is what is commonly known these days as an outsider artist, the kind of guy whose stuff you'll rarely, if ever, see hanging in galleries. But you should.

Pejo's documentary follows Coleman around, interviews friends and supporters (including filmmaker Jim Jarmusch), and generally gets Coleman's take on life. That take is not pretty. It is, however, fascinating (and, depending on your point of view, accurate). Coleman is a charismatic character, whatever you feel about the man's art, and he comes across well here. Persuasive, well, that's up to you, but I don't think he cares one way or the other; he's got a point to make, and he makes it, and who cares whether anyone agrees?

In the end, it does what a documentary is supposed to do: illuminate its subject. I liked it. *** ",1185926400,,1069,4.762162162162162

It's obvious the director was hewing a little close to the ""Crumb"" line when this was made, but SO WHAT? It's awesomely funny, cool, insightful and yes, it has a cast of the weirdos surrounding Joe Coleman (similar to ""Crumb"" I mean to say). With Hasil Adkins, Jim Jarmusch and extras with foxy mama Asia Aregento. I loved this DVD, it's excellent quality, too, you can really see his paintings. Shot on 35mm for a high class package all around.",1085616000,12,544,4.561224489795919
