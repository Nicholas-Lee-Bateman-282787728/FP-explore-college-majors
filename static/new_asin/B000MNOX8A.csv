2737637,4,B000MNOX8A,"I had wondered what this film was - and I was impressed with it to a small degree. The production is that of a school play, with the strength of the film majorly on the good characters, especially Amber Benson's character.

I was rather removed from the idea of the villain and his cronies - Nobody on the opposing side seemed believable, until they tried to thrawt the heroes, usually right in front of  them. The major character of the story, the mystical gryphon, doesn't feel really like it belongs in the film - it's not alive in the scene, it looks like it was animated and composed into the scene without a touch of realism.

Condering the production was produced for the SCIFI Channel, the film is low-budget. However, I didn't consider the film ""bad"", but ""cheesy"", and it does deserve some attention. My best advice - Be an Amber fan, that way you won't be offended, and throw twenty dollars down the drain.",1182038400,15,917,4.545454545454546
2737638,3,B000MNOX8A,"I enjoy fantasy movies, and dragons, or gryphons in this movie, are always of interest, epsecially when their presence in the story is central to the action. I guess I've got used to the high quality Hollywood or British FX seen in so many movies recently, that this one came as a real disappointment. From the end credits I believe an east european company were responsible, although I could be wrong. Whoever they are, or wherever they are based, I'm sorry to write that their efforts marred what was otherwise a well thought out story. I am particularly sorry because this movie cast Amber Benson, an actress whose work I always admire, in an action hero role, and she was particularly good at the cut and thrust of the sword and sorcery story. I was pleased that she had this opportunity to shine, just sorry that the FX marred the end result.",1179187200,13,847,4.578947368421052
2737639,1,B000MNOX8A,"Where to start.  It was nice to see Jonathan LaPaglia (Frank Parker from ""7 Days."") Other than that, the movie was horrible.  The acting and dialog was very nearly painful to endure, and as for the special effects...I think the Teletubbies had more cutting edge effects than ""Attack of the Gryphon.""",1176768000,5,299,4.8431372549019605

2737651,3,B000MNOX8A,"I've been hot for Amber Benson ever since her stint on Buffy as a lesbian witch.  That said, they really didn't give her a lot of good lines in this painfully period piece (as compared to later fare mixing current language and behavior with olden-tyme themes).  Still, it was okay, but the obvious scrimping on special effects (hey, it was a SyFy production, after all) took some of the fun out of it.",1386460800,,401,4.47945205479452
2737652,1,B000MNOX8A,"A perfect example of a very low computer budget. the special effects stunk. if you're going to make a movie of this type, have the money to do it right. did some grade school students make this?",1337385600,,194,4.27027027027027
2737653,3,B000MNOX8A,"This film is typical swords and sorcery fare, centuries before the start of the movie the conflict between a king's two sons split a nation into two and they have been at war since. At the start of the movie one of those nations is set to be annihilated by the other, in desperation the king have his court sorcerer summon the nation's old defender, a Gryphon, things however go downhill from there when the sorcerer uses his new pet monster to try to conquer both the nations and unite them under his rule. What follows is a fetch quest where the prince from one of the nations and the princess from the other have to join forces to try to destroy the sorcerer.

This movie is one big fetch quest, but there is enough interesting characters and plot twists to keep it fun, this is a movie that do not stray from it's genre at all, but it do what it do fairly well. I had allot of fun watching the movie. Now if you are expecting Lord of the Rings then you will not get that here, however as a fun little flick to provide a hour and a half of entertainment then Attack of the Gryphon works well.

My biggest problem with this movie is the special effects, the title character the Gryphon looks like it comes straight out of a Playstation 2 game, the computer graphics really is terrible. Now this usually can be excused as long as the story is good, however here the CG is so horrible it is really disturbing, especially when actors have to interact with their sprite monster. There is a scene where the sorcerer is petting the Gryphon on the beak, and seriously the actor's hand is 10 cm over the beak as not only have they made a bag CG creature they have integrated it into the film poorly to. I will say however that the creators of this movie have been smart enough to know their limitations, the Gryphon is not in that many scenes so the problem of the bad CG is limited.

The acting of this film is so so, the actors overplay allot and the acting can be a bit uneven, but considering the type of movie we are talking about this can be forgiven. Attack of the Gryphon is a cheap swords and sorcery fantasy flick, but it works and a B movies go it is rather good.",1309219200,,2168,4.231884057971015
2737654,1,B000MNOX8A,"We're only about 15 minutes into this movie and I'm already thinking, ""I'm glad I didn't pay for this."" (I Tivo'd it from cable.)  Other reviewers have called it ""cheesy"" which is an understatement. We're all for a good, cheesy sci-fi flick, but this is astonishingly bad.  To be fair, it does have entertainment value - we're cracking ourselves up making fun of just how bad it is! No continuity of accents (hilarious), horrible graphics (loved the plasti-head decapitation), and expecting a ""wardrobe malfunction"" any moment now... the characters with the most depth are the horses...",1292025600,,586,5.09375

2737657,2,B000MNOX8A,"In terms of concept and plot, this movie is basically Saturday morning kids fare, with a cartoonish portrayal of the gryphon, a villain who belongs in a drag burlesque review, and a simple story line that will intrigue the kiddies, but is altogether predictable.  Admittedly the story improves a bit as it progresses.  And there are a couple of pg-13 scenes (gore, heroes about to make love).  Overall, this is light-weight entertainment, and when approached as such, is enjoyable.",1243296000,2,481,5.063291139240507

8170357,4,B000MNOX8A,"Well, I've been a Jonathan LaPaglia fan from way back. He was quite believable... they could have done without the dueling brothers. Starting a film with a fight doesn't give one time to care one way or another about who is who and what is what.

As others said, the gryphon is more like a painting done by someone who knows nothing about shading and shadows so it looked like it was pasted on the film awkwardly. However, the actors did a great job making you believe they really saw it and were trying to kill it. Never saw Amber Benson before. She did an okay job, but they should have given her a much lighter sword.

The story was pretty good, had all the right elements, but the suspense wasn't masterful. There were a lot of things touched on that could have been developed a bit more, but then there is that nasty b-word--Budget. The story could have been better thought out in order to suspend disbelief. For fantasy, the story has to have more than a token villain although I did like that he has some frailties.  Overall, it kept me entertained, and I didn't cut it off in the middle like I've done with so many others.",1501718400,,1130,4.371428571428571
