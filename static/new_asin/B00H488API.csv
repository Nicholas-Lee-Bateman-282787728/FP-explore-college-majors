8629735,5,B00H488API,"I had this film on VHS, but gave it away when I got a dvd. I actually missed the wonderful scenes of Master chef Chu preparing savory and delectable dishes and watching his daughters grow in their personal lives. As Roger Ebert said in his review of this film, ""Don't watch it on an empty stomach.""",1530662400,,298,4.339285714285714
