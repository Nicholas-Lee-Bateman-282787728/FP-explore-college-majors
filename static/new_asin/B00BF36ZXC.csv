5613293,5,B00BF36ZXC,"Being a fan of Buster Keaton, I've always wanted to delve further into the genre of silent comedy.  Imagine my delight in finding  Johnny Hines.  This film is a wonderful example of things that may have slipped past the filter of time and popularity, but should be re-examined and truly appreciated.  While I've never read the comparison, I'd be shocked if Woody Allen wasn't a fan, since this could be considered a Great-great Grandfather to ""Bananas.  ""

Hines is truly engaging, and exhibits the skills of a Keaton or Lloyd with truly impressive stuns coupled with a winning delivery.  Technically speaking, the transfer looks wonderful.  And the score is fantastic.  There's underlying themes that draw you in and act as subtext, and the performance is flawless, while never getting in the way of the story.

Three cheers for The Crackerjack!",1362355200,4,846,4.978571428571429
5613294,5,B00BF36ZXC,"""The Crackerjack"" is a very entertaining and cleverly executed comedy. As one who has been studying silent film for over 40 years, I am always fascinated when something like this becomes available. I'm embarrassed to admit that until now I had never heard of the film's star, Johnny Hines.

Hines plays an energetic go-getter, much in the Harold Lloyd vein. His optimism reflects quite well the general mood of the Roaring Twenties. The film starts off with him performing his job as a pancake cook, and of course he is quite good at it. As the plot develops, he is involved in political intrigue in a fictitious Latin-American country, heads south to help save his uncle's failing pickle business, and eventually gets asked to put a stop to a revolution. There is an awful lot packed into the one-hour running time of this film! The marketing and advertising strategies that he employs to promote his uncles' pickles are particularly original and amusing. When he attempts to put down the revolution, there is more fun as he engages in some impersonation that is reminiscent in some ways of what Chaplin would do in ""The Great Dictator"" some 15 years later.

Johnny Hines was a charming actor and an engaging comedian. His physical and athletic abilities are in glorious evidence here, and he runs almost as fast as Buster Keaton did! There are also several instances of comic transposition in this film, in the tradition of the other great silent clowns. Most of the comic touches are perfectly performed, and none of the scenes go on too long (except perhaps for a rather drawn out sword fight).

As another reviewer noted here, the intertitles are witty and cleverly written. This is a definite plus, as many intertitles during the silent era were heavily laced with corn.

On the technical side, this DVD is mastered from a 16mm print that is in very good shape. There are a few scratches but they do not interfere with one's enjoyment of the film. The contrast is good in most scenes, with just a few instances where the film is a little bit on the dark side. Ben Model's original Dolby Digital piano score complements the mood of each scene perfectly, without ever becoming overbearing. Model is one of the few accompanists currently playing for silent films who understands that the film should always be the star of the show.

I'm looking forward to viewing similarly ""lost"" releases in the ""Accidentally Preserved"" series, which is forthcoming from the same Undercrank Productions that brought this film to DVD. This rarity is a great opportunity to see the kind of fare that was keeping audiences laughing and entertained 90 years ago. The fact that we can now enjoy it is more proof of the permanence and everlasting quality of art - even if that permanence is sometimes ""accidental.""",1362268800,4,2796,4.816666666666666
5613295,5,B00BF36ZXC,"I've seen a handful of Johnny Hines' breezy, energetic comedy features, and they're a lot of fun.  Hines is due for a resurgence in notoriety they way other second-tier comedians like Lloyd Hamilton, Charley Chase and Raymond Griffith have. ""The Crackerjack"" does not seem to circulate in 35mm, and the 16mm print this DVD was transferred from seems to be one of the better ones around.  The film is a non-stop parade of clever gag sequences, and Hines' cheery demeanor has just enough 1920s ""gee whiz"" to be endearing without being off-putting.  The film is well-produced and well-directed, and has a great supporting cast.  Nice to see a Florida-made silent feature available on DVD.  Good piano score, too.  If you're a fan of silent comedy films, do give this one a try!",1361836800,2,774,4.825757575757576
5613296,5,B00BF36ZXC,"If they could capture Johnny Hines' energy and put it in a bottle, we'd be able to pack 30 hours of fun into every 24 hour day.

Hines' character is the perennial go getter; he's like the Warner Bros. Tasmanian Devil - just a blur of activity. With a grin that seemingly stretches from ear to ear, he maneuvers his way through adventures that test the limits of our imagination.

In ""The Crackerjack"", Johnny plays a pickle salesman who gets involved in a corrupt South American revolution, saves the day, and gets the girl by means of...well, don't ask. It basically defies description. Rest assured that this is a real crowd pleaser that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The gags are inventive and non stop. Even the subtitles which, though hardly subtle, more than make up for it with their innovation and cleverness.

The print from which this DVD derives may not be perfect, but it is much better than some of the others I have seen which have been released by other distributors. Up until now, most of the copies which I have viewed are somewhat muddy and lacking contrast. This DVD corrects most of these issues, and delivers the goods in more ways than one.

The musical score deserves special recognition. It has been composed to match the film precisely, and the motifs it employs complement the visuals brilliantly. Pay special attention to the themes which accompany the 'south of the border' portion of the story, and you'll hear what I'm talking about.

Johnny Hines never reached the pinnacle of success that the top silent comedians attained. However, it's very unfair to impose those comparisons upon him. He was, nevertheless, very good at what he did. If you're looking for a fun way to pass 70 minutes, give him a chance, and take a look at ""The Crackerjack"". You won't regret it.",1361750400,5,1807,4.669811320754717
5613297,5,B00BF36ZXC,"You could make an arguement for Johnny Hines, who plays a pancake chef who gets involved is South (or Central or ?) American politics, intrigue and munitions smuggling. The plot is fun nonsense, but if you like early Doug, like ""The Matrimaniac"", ""His Picture in the Papers"" or ""Wild and Wooly"" there's a good chance you'll enjoy this.

The DVD is a very nice transfer of a somewhat worn but completely servicable 16mm print. Way better than average score for this silent is played by composer/pianist Ben Model - I would call it a ""traditional"" style job of silent scoring that compliments the action on screen and doesn't have you sitting there and wondering when the Martians will land!",1361318400,3,689,4.7899159663865545
8567576,4,B00BF36ZXC,Organist Ben Model presents another rare film rebursished from his nice collection of movies. The results are quite entertaining. I really enjoyed it.,1383782400,,150,5.565217391304348
8567577,4,B00BF36ZXC,"Ok.  As a devout Laurel and Hardy, Buster Keaton, Chaplin and Lloyd fan... I never heard of Johnny Hines.  I've been watching these films for over 40 years but never looked beyond the group I mentioned.  I am really glad this found me!  I am not sure I would classify it as a silent comedy though.  There is plenty of drama.  But don't let that deter you from getting this.  Johnny Hines has touches of Chaplin, Keaton and Lloyd but also a touch of Fairbanks at the end of the film.  What truly brings this all together is the musical score!  Absolutely brilliant.  It somehow makes the different elements of drama, comedy and action come together.  I am truly impressed that this music felt like it was played as a single hour long piece.  I think Ben Model should release a silent movie music CD if he hasn't already.  It gets 4 stars from me.  A 5 star review in my opinion is left for the best of the best.  Safety Last, The Gold Rush, The General.  You get what I mean.  But this is terrific and I will be hunting down more of Johnny Hines.  Great stuff!",1367193600,2,1059,4.262626262626263
8567578,5,B00BF36ZXC,"Tommy ""Crackerjack"" Perkins, played by the likeable Johnny Hines, works his way through college making pancakes in a busy diner.  When his uncle asks him to help save his faltering pickle business in Florida, Tommy revitalizes the company with product enhancements and creative advertising.  When Tommy completes a business deal to expand sales into Latin American country Esquasado, he unexpectedly becomes involved in a political revolution.  This comedy has plenty of sight gags and is action packed.  Perfectly enhanced by Ben Model's engaging original musical score, this overlooked film should delight anyone who enjoys silent film comedy.",1365897600,2,645,5.618556701030927
8567579,5,B00BF36ZXC,"While I had heard his name before, this is the first film starring Johnny Hines that I have ever seen. Knowing so little about him I wasn't sure what to expect, but I ended up quite impressed with Hines and this film in particular. Based on the role that Hines plays in this film there are obvious similarities to Harold Lloyd's glasses character. Surprisingly, for an almost forgotten silent comedian, Hines holds up well in the comparison to Lloyd.  He was charismatic and his high energy level kept me interested in the character throughout the film. While some silent comedies have gags that go on for too long and have very corny titles, this film wasn't guilty of either offense. The pacing was excellent and the comedy wasn't over the top.

The DVD case stated the film was transferred from a vintage 16mm print that may be missing a scene or two, but there didn't seem to be any gaps in the story to me. The quality of the print was much better than I expected. There were a few spots with obvious issues, but I thought the vast majority of the film looked great.

The piano score by Ben Model was excellent as always. I have heard Ben play live at Cinefest in the past and he has always impressed me. Nothing beats watching a silent film in a theater with live accompaniment, but I really enjoy having a film like this on DVD since I am able to watch it multiple times. When watching a film in a theater it can be difficult to give the music the attention it deserves. Since I have The Crackerjack on DVD I was able to watch it a second time so I could concentrate on the music. As other reviewers have mentioned, Ben is very good at not over-powering a film with the score. In a film like this, with a lot of action, it can be difficult for some composers to keep the musical momentum going but Ben has just the right touch.

After watching The Crackerjack I will definitely be looking for more of Hines' films. I am also looking forward Ben Model's future releases of other silent films with lesser-known stars.

Please note: This review is for The Crackerjack released by Undercrank Productions in the case with the blue background.",1365465600,5,2144,4.459183673469388
8567580,5,B00BF36ZXC,"How can you not love a movie in which stuffed pickles play such an essential part?  So glad this lost silent film made it to DVD, thanks to Ben Model, who created and plays the score.  It joins its rightful place alongside the works of Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy and so many more great performances of the era!",1365465600,3,309,4.310344827586207
8567581,5,B00BF36ZXC,"As a long-time silent film buff, I thought I knew everything there was to know about the great comics of the silent era. I was wrong. Johnny Hines, completely unknown to me, has all the great gifts of athleticism, daring, timing, and romantic grace one associates with Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, and Charlie Chaplin, and adds his own considerable charisma and cocksure American enthusiasm to the mix. The plot revolves around Hines going to Florida to save his family pickle business. As he touts his new product, the stuffed pickle, he inadvertently becomes involved in a South American revolution. Silly stuff, of course, but executed with conviction and verve that had me laughing heartily. Ben Model is a well-known musician whose compositions and accompaniment enliven every silent film he's worked on. He has generously dipped into his own collection to resurrect the reputation of Hines and restore a truly funny film to the public. Thanks, Ben! Keep 'em coming.",1365033600,4,971,5.113207547169812
8567582,5,B00BF36ZXC,"This was the first Johnny Hines movie I'd ever seen. He's very brash and confident, much like Harold Lloyd. Some great stunts and funnny situations as Hines, who's selling stuffed pickles, becomes entangled in a South American revolution.

The print used here was not the best, but it is a very rare film and this could be the only chance to see it. That said, it appears that there was some digital cleanup work done and it plays great, with no holes in the plot.

The music score is excellent. Not overbearing, it hit's just the right note and the quality of the recording is so good it feels like there's somebody in the room playing live.

If you're a fan of silent comedy, this is a must have for your collection!",1364342400,3,718,4.424242424242424
8567583,5,B00BF36ZXC,"I've enjoyed many films from cinema's silent era, but had never heard of Johnny Hines before this. What I found was a fun film that kept me entertained for the 67 minute run time. The plot is over the top, frankly pretty ridiculous but in a very funny way.  Political intrigue, pickles (literal & figurative), revolutionaries... pretty crazy but it works in this.  The comedy is incredibly well preformed with  gags I hadn't seen before such as a ""so long"" pancake.  This surprised me since I would have assumed that a film like this and a performer like Hines wouldn't have been nearly lost to the ages.

The print is a bit worn, with scratches and a few dark spots and some of the inter-titles replaced where missing but the transfer is very good and the DVD showcases the best quality you could expect from a lost and basically abandoned old film. A wonderful addition and the real reason for the release is the new score. I've attended a few silent film screenings in the past that showcased live accompaniment and this really gave me that feeling again.

This is certainly worth look for fans of silent cinema and the music that accompanies them.  Be sure to get the disc with the blue cover art which has the new score and not some alternative release.",1363046400,4,1258,4.564444444444445
8567584,5,B00BF36ZXC,"I never heard of Johnny Hines until I got a hold of this home video.

As usual, all because a performer is lesser known does not mean this is a mediocre, unfunny film.  It is just the opposite with ""The Crackerjack.""

I've seen a lot of silent movies and was surprised how good this was. Why haven't I heard of Hines before now?? Most of the gags work well and the story moves along with only a few bumps in the plot.

This edition was produced by Ben Model who did an excellent job scoring and authoring it for home video.

The transfer quality is pretty darn good, too.

Apparently, this only survives in 16mm show-at-home rental prints.  The majority of this particular type of rental feature film were edited down to fit on 6 reels, which in some cases is a good thing.

Although a few minutes are missing I didn't notice them except for one scene which is adequately explained in a title card.

I highly recommend this video for silent film and comedy fans or for someone who is thinking of getting into that era of cinema.

""The Crackerjack"" is one of the good ones.",1362355200,4,1072,4.3686868686868685
8567585,5,B00BF36ZXC,"THE CRACKERJACK (1925) is an energetic and fast-paced comedy starring Johnny Hines as Tommy Perkins, newly graduated from college, who decides to help run his father's pickle business. However, a revolutionary from the fictional Latin American country Esquasado (""where they elect a guy president on Monday and bury him Wednesday"") is planning to smuggle ammunition across the border concealed in shipments of the pickles. When Tommy learns of these plans, he heads to Esquasado to put an end to the revolution himself.

Directed by Johnny Hines' brother Charles, THE CRACKERJACK is a delightful comedy that also contains some excellent stuntwork, exciting chase sequences, and even some swordfighting reminiscent of Douglas Fairbanks' THE MARK OF ZORRO. I had only seen one Hines comedy prior to this, and while he's not as well-remembered as some of silent comedy's other luminaries, his work demonstrates a real energy and inventiveness that holds up well almost 90 years later. As a silent comedy buff, finally having the chance to own one of Johnny Hines' films on DVD is a real treat. This DVD edition from Undercrank Productions is mastered from a 16mm print and features a score by Ben Model that perfectly compliments the comedy.",1362355200,6,1238,5.19
