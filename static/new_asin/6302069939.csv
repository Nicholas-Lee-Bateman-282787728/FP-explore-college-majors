from the incredible 1916 album and tour Motorhead was running on all cylinders!
I saw them in Irvine Meadows on the Metal Tour with Alice Cooper, Judas Priest
and other mtv friendly metal bands at the time who sucked! Motorhead blew them
all away! Why this isn't released on dvd? I just came across this and saw nobody
gave a review so I had to! If your a metal or motorhead fan get this now who cares
if it's vhs! come one it's not that bad to watch a vhs! oh your too cool? NOT!",1318118400,3,555,4.054545454545455
