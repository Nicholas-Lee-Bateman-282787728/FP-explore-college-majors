3943884,5,B002KSA4F6,"This documentary is simply fantastic. There is no other similar to it. Worth buy it, because all episodes are so informative and beautiful in the same time, especially the episode about plants. The episodes about birds and insects are very beautiful too. I have learned a lot about animals and plants with this fascinating ten-episodes documentary. Believe me, if you buy this, you will never regret it.",1266883200,3,403,5.029850746268656
3943885,5,B002KSA4F6,"As a frequent watcher of nature programs over the last 30 years, I have to say that this is one of the all time greats.  Attenborough docs are always solid and there's no shortage of the usual charm, but the filming techniques have really come to the fore on this effort.  There are utterly spectacular moments in each of the episodes.  Yes, the overview episode is redundant, but there's very little else to be critical about.  One for the ages, this.",1265328000,128,452,4.54320987654321
3943886,5,B002KSA4F6,"Zev Toledano has provided a detailed and accurate information about this series of documentary from the BBC, which aired in the UK BBC HD Channel. I am lucky enough to record and have just finish watching the first episode tonight. You have to give credit to the quality of this production and I fully appreciate the effort the BBC crew went through during the 3 years shooting for this production. Life  revels some of the world's first filmed footages and is filled with thrills and surprises. I have always preferred BBC productions over Discovery or National Geographic mainly due to the coherence of the program without annoying commercial inserts and time wasting recaps, original scores and music and master editing skills that is easy to follow and understand, and there is also Sir David Attenborough, whose narrative skill is the perfect match for the science and nature genre. I cannot wait for its Blu-Ray release and put this into my personal BBC collection.",1264377600,4,971,4.957055214723926
3943887,5,B002KSA4F6,"Over the past two decades, the BBC Natural History Unit has become a prolific documentary factory of the highest order, with ever-improving skills and increasing dedication. Some of their productions are relatively minor, but this is one of their flagships, and you can tell this because they use David Attenborough as the narrator (who is still in top form).

The theme for this 10-part series is the challenges of life and how various animals and plants solve them. This includes unusual and extreme food gathering techniques, hunting strategies, surprising evolutionary weapons and defenses, adaptations to harsh environments, mating rituals, and the lengths they go to in order to pick the right breeding partners.

Each episode covers this vast topic in specific areas: The first episode is an overview and top-20 hit parade of the upcoming episodes. Each of the ensuing episodes then cover a branch of the animal kingdom, including reptiles, insects, mammals, plants, birds, fish, with additional specialized episodes covering hunting, sea-life and primates.

This will obviously overlap with many of their previous releases, especially The Trials of Life, Attenborough's series covering the animal kingdom, and even The Living Planet and Planet Earth. But their approach here is interestingly well-chosen: Previously covered footage and educational information is usually summarized, before continuing with the more obscure, the upgraded, and the exciting new details.

For example, The Private Life of Plants is obviously much more comprehensive and educational, but this show's episode on plants features things like a 60-second time-lapse shot of growing life in the woodlands that took two years to create, new information on the strange shape of the Dragon's Blood tree, and more footage on the Venus Flytrap, this time its dual use of insects complete with tiny sound recordings.

Now, I have a pet peeve about repetition. This show's annoyingly useless overview episode, and the fact that much of the information and footage lacks freshness and has been covered before, all tempt me to rate this show lower. But the combination of nicely summarized educational information, a good theme and structure, new amazing cinematography that uses the latest skills and technology, and some new exciting footage that I don't think I have ever seen before, compels me to give this top marks. This is a much better release than Planet Earth.

In addition, while many nature documentaries have elements of drama and laughs, this show has more than usual, and you will find yourself frequently touched, horrified or very amused by all of the amazing behaviour on screen, all obviously very real.

The BBC also continue their recent trend that devotes the last 10 minutes of each episode to a 'making of' featurette. These are usually just as interesting as the footage and you can always stop watching if you aren't interested, so I suppose I can't complain. But keep in mind that if you subtract the overview episode and diary scenes, you are actually getting 450 minutes instead of 600.

In summary: If you are relatively new to BBC documentaries, this will amaze you to no end AND provide a nice informative summary of life on earth. If you are a seasoned watcher of Attenborough's series, you can still enjoy this series as a combination of educational summary, a provider of new, complementary and upgraded information with some of the most beautiful, rare and amazing footage ever recorded, and even as a highly entertaining natural drama and comedy, or 'nature dramedy', if I may coin a phrase.

However, if you place emphasis on educational and more comprehensive information, Attenborough's previous Life series still reign supreme and will probably remain unequalled for a long, long time.",1262908800,453,3800,5.226600985221675
3943888,5,B002KSA4F6,"Like any nature show, scenes that are both breathtaking and traumatizing can be seen simultaneously.  This show takes that and kicks it up several notches! With 4 years to research and plan, and filmed entirely in HD, the Life crew took amazing risks and were rewarded with footage that soars above all other nature shows.  In some cases, the Life crew captured actions and moments that had never been seen or heard of before. The narration by David Attenborough is perfect.  I'm not looking forward to the US version with a different narrator.. as with all things BBC, their version is far superior.  The show does lean heavily on evolution at times so creationists will have to ignore those statements as the show overall is worth your time and money.  (I skipped episode 6 on Insects, because, well I hate them, and the other shows were so incredible I didn't think I could handle that one.  I'll watch it eventually!)

If you love nature shows, this one is a can't miss.  If you don't love nature shows, watch this one anyway!",1261526400,25,1030,4.651933701657459

What I did not remember was how often the same footage was reused throughout the DVDs. I was really disappointed that they used the same footage for so many different parts of the series.
On the other hand, my two year old seems to love it-but then again she would be willing to watch one movie over and over again all day long.
There is some really amazing footage and information in each part of the series but if I remember correctly, when some of the information was repeated.
Bottom line:
There is no way I would be willing to pay full price for this DVD set.",1452729600,11,717,4.398496240601504

You can feel his passion for the subjects and years of experience expressed in every line. Discovery Channel must be commended for broadcasting the series to a broader audience but the alterations take away from experience. I highly recommend getting this BBC version. With the breathtaking camera work, narration, and score, this is a perfect companion to the Planet Earth series and should be part of any Blu-Ray collection.",1450051200,,599,5.315789473684211

3944043,1,B002KSA4F6,"Note: I could not watch this, as it did not work in my Blu-Ray player.  The copyright/intro BBC Earth video plays, and then kicks back to the blu-ray player menu.  Upon further investigation, the videos are apparently encoded in 1080i50, not 1080p as claimed, and thus are incompatible with many blu-ray players sold in the US, including Sony branded players, playstation, etc.  Apparently some Samsung and LG players will work with these, but buyer beware, you may not find out if your blu-ray player will work with these until you have them in hand!

These are indeed ""region-free,"" so their unplayability is not related to a region restriction, but a seemingly odd video encoding decision.

I'm guessing that the US version with Oprah is encoded as 1080p, but like most people I have zero interest in purchasing that version.",1449705600,11,828,4.928057553956834

3944047,5,B002KSA4F6,Interesting that the DVD set of Life narrated by David Attenborough is selling for roughly 4 times the cost of the one narrated by Oprah.

I hope the government do not slash the BBC's budget and re-route the BBC to Americanized crap standard documentaries.

3944054,5,B002KSA4F6,"On a slow, snowy night, I imagine there is little else more cozy than making a cup of tea/cider/mulled wine, curling up in a blanket, and listening to David Attenborough talk us through the amazing visuals of the world around us.  This documentary, yet another great one from the BBC, is one of the most beautifully shot nature shows I have ever had the pleasure of watching.  In addition to the immense dedication it takes to even find some of these creatures, the creativity of the angles and sequences is particularly rich (I recall one shot of a basilisk lizard that was taken from BELOW.  Amazing!)

I feel that the editing of the series is not too contrived as well.  Often, nature shows seem to create too much of a personified narrative that fills the animals with ""problems"" that they may or may not have actually had.  I feel that the pacing of this show was relatively natural and allowed the beautifully-shot environments and creatures to speak for themselves.  The tasteful use of slow-motion is also revealing of processes and details that I've never encountered before (wait till you see what chameleon tongues look like).

Finally, the behind-the-scenes extras at the end of every episode give credit to the dedicated men and women who did the legwork of catching the footage.  Major props to the poor guy who sat in a hide for something like three months to catch the display behaviors of birds of paradise, and the absolutely crazy divers who went beneath several feet of arctic ice to film penguins (and have given me drowning-nightmare fodder for the next week).  Highly recommended, very enjoyable.",1448668800,,1619,4.833333333333333

3944090,3,B002KSA4F6,"In spite of all the wonderful, exciting and beautiful scenes included, ""Life"" seems to me the most boring and disappointing of al BBC Nature Specials. It is too repetitive and prolongs disagreeable or uninteresting scenes for too much time. There is too much human intervention to be watched. Although one must be very thankful to these people for their courage and endurance in filmg these scenes, too much time is dedicated to their activities and relations on board. Personally, I do not like to see humans in Nature programs. The On Location sections at the end of each episode is unnecessary and forces one to see again repulsive and disgusting scenes as the Komodo dragons attack on the water buffalo. One feels pity for the poor buffalo and I even wished that the photographers could have done something to prevent this real case of animal brutality. One wonders why was the buffalo so passive and why it did not try to escape. Did humans interfered some way in order to present a real fact of life? The Jewel of the Crown was the beautiful scene of the coupling of the two dragons of the sea (sea horses). To be honest, these are my impressions after  watching only the first two discs. I have lost interest in the series now but will certainly return to it some time later.",1438128000,,1282,4.62280701754386

Every video we are in awe at some of the shots they get with the camera on some of the animals. Absolutely breath taking.
Since this series does go into more detail there are some parts that can be a bit heart renching. Also there are parts that show the animal mating ritual. May make for some interesting questions in kids.

As much as I like Oprah (and as much as my wife absolutely adores her), it was a mistake to have her narrate this. She reads it as if she's a primary school instructor reading a story to second graders. I don't know why she did it this way. Was she directed to do so or was it her choice? I know she is capable of far better than this. Why didn't they just use the original David Attenborough narration? The man IS the voice of nature! He talk TO you, not DOWN to you. If they were selling the Attenborough version, I wouldn't be able to rate it highly enough. With Oprah narrating, the only folks I can recommend it to are those who are absolutely flummoxed by any kind of English accent, even one as mild and easily understandable as Attenborough's.",1431907200,2,910,4.455089820359281

But... to those at the Discovery Channel,  what N Planet Earth were you thinking in releasing this with Oprah as the narrator in the US release?  I've seen only the first few minutes of the Discovery Channel version before I was insulted by the condescension; enough to know that whoever decided her narration was better suited for a US audience is completely out of touch with the US audience!
Who thinks that being talked to like a second grader is a good idea for ANY audience save second graders?  Let alone,  being talked to in such a manner by someone who holds no knowledge of the subject matter whatsoever. (that'd be you,  Oprah).
Look,  Discovery buffoons,  we as Americans do not need to be spoon fed dumbed down narration,  nor have our scenes of nature cut down to eliminate much of what actually takes place in nature, nor have music re-recorded to appeal to us. We can actually understand the man who wrote the original narration,  and spoke the original narration,  just fine. You're not raking in extra $ by virtue of your inane choice of Oprah,  you're losing credibility and $ instead. Gee,  what a great decision they made,  if avoiding profits or second grade science was their goal, that is.
Stay smart,  those who purchase this incredible collection,  and stick with the original BBC version. It's longer,  with more content,  it's scored in its original and perfectly orchestrated musical finery,  and it's narrated by the man who wrote the original narration and who has been involved with the subject matter not just this go round,  but for decades. (The narration was rewritten for Oprah,  so as to ""appeal"" to an American audience -  which is an epic fail).

A few days ago in shopping for a birthday gift for my brother, I saw this title, with narration by Oprah.  Not a big fan of her style and also after reading some reviews, I decided  to pay double to get the one with Sir Richard Attenborough narrating. (Oprah's was $10; Sir Richard's was $20.)  This morning the same item is NOW $30!  Basically, the expression ""you get what you pay for"" is majorly flawed. Charging ""whatever the market will allow"" appears to more appropriate.  Regular customer of Amazon, but at least today, they lost a sale (not that they would lose any sleep over it).

The discs include a short ""making of"" documentary of each episode, which is even more astonishing than the content.  The months, sometimes years (!) spent setting up particular shots or scenes, the incredible danger and inhospitable environments, the luck both bad- and good- endured by the crews.

David Attenborough narrates.  Unlike many documentaries, he is perfectly understandable (on headphones) without subtitles (though they are available).

The music is varied and tasteful and contributes.  Sound design -- added bubbles or rustling noises or animal cries -- are appropriate and nicely dubbed in stereo. Even subtle humor sometimes is snuck in: the segment on Venus Flytraps has tiny burps dubbed in as the flowers reopen after a kill.

Extensive use of time lapse photography and slow motion photography illuminate trends and action impossible to discern in normal time.

Pacing is fast, almost too fast sometimes, with interesting shots and story lines rushing by as fast as you can absorb them.

3944247,4,B002KSA4F6,"The camera work was totally amazing.
Mind and heart blowing stuff indeed!
The evolution sermon from Davey was the usual sermon; all about misapplying human thoughts and behaviours onto the animals. (At one point David tells us that a male Bird of Paradise is actually ""feeling dejected"" because he has been rejected by a female he was hoping to woo - I mean really? If that bird could talk to us would he ask us for directions to the nearest psychologist's office so as he could rest his weary wee wings, lie down on a leather sofa and chirp on and on about how hard it was cracking his way out of the egg because that must surely be the beginning of his low-wing-self-esteem).
Davey boy does that a lot throughout all his sermons, applies human thought and behaviour reasoning onto animals.
The other thing slightly annoying about Davey boy is he seems always to be telling us that this is what these creatures do whenever they are alone and once again ignores his contamination of the experiment created by the presence of humans and machines onto or into the environment being examined.
For all we know, herds of wildebeests are sitting about with their hooves up, reading the New York Post, drinking cappuccinos with lookouts up on every hill until suddenly one of the lookouts yells, ""Quick! It's Davey"" as the leader hides his newspaper, skulls his coffee and orders the herd, ""Alright now 90% of you chaps onto all fours and moo a lot; 5% of you have a quick fight and scratch your arses on a tree or something and the rest of you start humping"" And when Davey's crew are gone, they're are all back to boiling eggs, straining noodles and playing back-gammon, smoking freshly packed pipes and swirling their martinis with an antler.
My point is we don't know what animals do when we are not around because they do it when we are not around; we do, however have a little bit of a clue as to what some animals do when we are around huffing and puffing our way through the dense underbrush, lugging cameras and microphones and tents and whatnot, or hovering overhead in some noisy, pollution spewing helicopter - these creatures have rather good senses after all, and if I can hear a helicopter 5000 feet up in the sky, guess what!
The sermon based on the religion known as Evolution loses this program one star.
Personally I find it amazing that anyone could witness what we are witnessing on these Blu rays and not believe in the One who created all things seen and unseen; for me, it is yet another reason to be filled with awe at what God can do; the heavens themselves declare His Glory, as the Bible would rightfully tell us.
The four stars are for the sheer beauty of the camera work.
Jaw dropping!!!
Absolutely...
Hang on! One of the lookouts just yelled that Davey-boy is coming back.

I wasn't staying the night so I didn't get to see the whole thing, but what I did see was *Amazing*.

This is definitely a 5-star or higher production.  I did sort of wish I could make prints from the disks.  (There may be a way, probably is, I just don't know it.

For those of you stuck with the Oprah narration, check to see if narrator is a selection.  I'd like to know myself, because this is where I purchased it and what we saw definitely wasn't narrated by dope-rah.

For those of you who are wondering if it's worth it... yes, yes, a thousand times yes.  Just make sure you get or can choose the Attenborough narration.",1390780800,,1131,4.253521126760563
3944260,5,B002KSA4F6,"This 4-disc series on the broad subject of ""Life"" is one more beautiful nature documentary in the BBC's long line of wonderful documentaries.  Their photographers have achieved yet another great ""tour de force"" in filming a sampling of nearly all life forms on the planet (except microbes), often at great risk to their own lives.  They traveled to all corners of the Earth to produce these natural histories, and the photography is as creative as it is stunning.  Scenes are short, one each on a given species, or pair of species (hunters and the hunted, or symbiotic relationships) - mostly about animals, but one episode on plant life.  The treatments are not the slightest bit academic.  They cover the basics without going into scientific technicalities or terminology.

There are two different versions of ""Life"", one narrated by David Attenborough and the other by Oprah Winfrey.  Supposedly, the episodes are otherwise the same for both versions.  I opted for the Winfrey version, as it was much less expensive.  Indeed, Oprah's narrations are very different from those of David's, and for that matter, most other narrators of nature films, something which may take a bit of time to get used to.  Her intonations are more - shall we say - theatrical, as one would expect from a professional, broadcast journalist.  No humdrum monotones for Oprah.  However, this is not to say they are inferior in any way, as some reviewers have suggested.

""Life"" is intended not just for adults.  These short scenes and episodes would also be ideal for children (or adults with short attention spans) as well, and a great way to inspire young people to consider a career in biology.  The episodes are also perfect for classroom use.  I have to believe that this was one of the reasons why the BBC produced the series.  Indeed, Oprah's readings may very well be more appreciated by children.

When I was growing up, TV and radio ads were performed only by men, for at the time, women weren't considered believable or trustworthy (or whatever).  Today, women's voices are heard equally as often, if not more so.  So, one more vote for Oprah.

The only thing that I find missing in this series, is at least a mention of life itself.  That is, what is life?  After all, that's the title of the documentary.  One would think that the BBC could have made at least a couple passing comments about the nature of life in general.  But then again, doing so would have been ""academic"", ""philosophical"" or offensive to some religious beliefs.",1390003200,2,2523,4.825174825174825

Her inflections are forced, her emphases are on the wrong words and it is all very distracting - annoying, even.

What? So as opposed to what the product description has on here (Amazon.com) that it is region free, if I got a David Attenborough-Narrated Version that is region 1 (USA and CANADA), what are those other reviewers talking about?

I found Amazon to be a great way to get the things I wanted, and the price wasn't too bad either..... that was, until I made this purchase. Firstly, the product came late, but more importantly, it never actually showed up at my house at all! I received a notice from the post office in the mail saying that the product was waiting for me at the local post office branch (About 25 miles from my home) and I could pick it up during regular business hours, after paying a $15.00 COD. I sent an email to customer service, and the response back was to credit my account for the $15.00, and in their minds that was all well and good! Well, it's not! I don't have the time during the day to go pick up this package, and if I did, I would have gone to the Walmart  that is much closer to my home and bought the product there. I refuse to jump through hoops to get this product anymore, and asked for my money back...... I have never received it!

David Attenborough is great but Oprah also does a very fine job narrating.  Because Oprah is so well-known in North America, I think it will attract many more Americans to watch this series, particularly those who wouldn't ordinarily watch a documentary.  I think Attenborough is of course a better naturalist, but I think Oprah would be easier for young children to listen to...if we can get more people, especially children, to see these masterful documentaries, the world will be a better place!

The style of documentary is also more approachable for children and for those who don't ordinarily watch nature documentaries:  each segment is short, and can be watched in brief segments.  \

3944325,5,B002KSA4F6,"""Life"" David Attenborough Version, Bluray:

This one is truly amazing, a masterpiece. People always compare between ""Planet Earth"" (which also has close to a 5 star rating) and ""Life"". It is actually difficult to compare between ""Planet Earth"" and this one, but my vote goes to ""Life"". Planet Earth is also an excellent series but it moves too fast between one continent to another without going into the details. To sum up ""Planet Earth is Jack of all Trades but Master of None"". But, then again it is my personal opinion. I have both the series and they both are truly amazing. Great work from BBC.

Coming back to ""Life"", please please buy the David Attenborough version. Trust me I have both versions and it is a total different experience listening to Attenborough version. Oprah narration is not very bad, but it is meant for kids- they will love it and it is cheaper too. If you don't want it for your kids and are seriously looking for some knowledge, go for the Attenborough version. It is deep and totally worth the extra money. I don't hate Oprah, but then I never expected anything great from her. It is totally Discovery's fault. Discovery already has spoiled many such series with narration from actors. I bet USA has a lot of good naturalist and scientists, why not use them. ""Please Discovery, leave science for scientists"".
Also, Attenborough version is about 100 min longer and is entirely in 1080p (even the special features are in high definition) whereas the Discovery-Oprah version is in 1080i and no high definition for special features.

Another thing, Life by David Attenborough is much cheaper in United Kingdom (at least when I first wrote the review), but do not buy it from there. I already did this mistake but amazon.uk was kind enough to refund my money. It has nothing to do with the region coding, but the UK version is coded in 50i or 50Hz which will not play in most of the US bluray players (US players need 60Hz coding). This thing is not mentioned anywhere on the product but their are 2 ways to know it without opening the bluray package- First, US version has a thicker book case as compared to blue plastic case for the UK version. Second, US version has a picture of Flamingos in the back cover and the UK version has a red frog.

Enjoy Life :)",1360195200,14,2287,4.598039215686274

However, when I first watched this series as it came to television, I ENJOYED how she narrated it.  She does not make anyone feel stupid or childish.  If some of you feel that way, that is your problem.  I am not stupid, have never felt stupid, and in no way, shape, or form, ever felt as if Oprah was talking down to me.  If you do have these types of problems, and if for some ""strange reason,"" other people just insult you out of the blue more so than others, then I guess you may need to buy the other version and spend more money.

I mean come on, what in the he** is she supposed to do, accentuate as if she is selling an action packed fairy tale to children before they fall asleep at night?  Bull!

This series not only taught me about life around the planet but also some extraordinary animals and plants I barely knew anything about.  The photography is stunning and in bluray was brilliant.  The narration by David Attenborough was clear and easily understood.  I did have to wonder at times as I heard the British pronunciation of some words but it didn't prevent my comprehension, it broadened my knowledge of how we differ, just another part of life!  I really enjoyed the series and learned a lot.  My memories of chimps, Komodo Dragons and water buffalos are still with me.  After each episode, a 10 minute short explains how the most difficult sequences were filmed.  A very valuable exercise which made me wish I was there to do it too.

And the hi-def audio included is quite impressive as well.
The only thing that is (slightly) lacking are the assortment of bonus features. But as I purchased this product for the program itself, it is only a slight dip for me.

There are some typical scenes of big cats chasing prey, lemurs moving-moving, and sardines being bullied into forming a ball, that you, most certainly, have seen before. But what made me buy this series is the new material, if not a new perspective on things familiar.

""Life"" is an incredible series and I highly recommend to everyone, but the version narrated by David Attenborough.  I was born and raised in the U.S. but the Americanized versions of the BBC Earth documentaries (for the most part) are terrible due to the choice of narrator.  They typically are not knowledgeable about the material, and make the video almost unbearable (e.g., Oprah, Alex Baldwin in Frozen Planet, Mike Rowe in Human Planet, etc.).  The actual video content is truly incredible and anyone interested in life on Earth should purchase Life narrated by David Attenborough.  This goes for every BBC Earth documentary.  If possible (exception is Human Planet narrated by John Hurt who does a good job) get the version narrated by David Attenborough.",1336694400,,872,5.062937062937063

The filming is just above any expectations, and in blueray just awesome.  But I hesitate to understand why replacing Oprah Winfrey with Sir D.Attenborough. Sir A's voice is way past his prime, sometimes difficult to understand, and an irritating to the ear (it was so in previous installments of these magnificent BBC productions). Ms. Winfrey, on the other hand, communicates so well the marvels, with clarity and gusto. I am definitely not supporting this over Winfrey's original.

I was so excited when I first inserted the first Blu-Ray disc. The majesty of nature in full High-Definition in my living room. It was magnificent in it's full 1080p glory, until the narration commenced. It sounded like Oprah so I looked at the case and indeed it was her. I said to myself maybe she'll be good at it since she did have a very successful talk show where all she did was talk. Oh no, oh no, oh no, no, no, no, no. She should have kept her day job. It's ruined. I wouldn't dare donate it to Goodwill and make someone experience the same deceptive expectation.

I hate it so much that I made this emphatic and overly dramatic review for the very first time, in hopes to nudge would-be expecting consumers.

Producers of other programs should take note of the Life series to see how it should be done. The Life series is not for attention deficit people like most junk out there now. It slows the scenes down enough for the viewer to enjoy the beautiful photography and the fantastic high definition. It's not flashy, with 6 scenes per second like the recent American History ""Story of Us"" which is dizzying and awful.

I have nothing against oprah winfrey narrating but, once again, because I'm use to David, I'm going to stick to the original.

You won't be disappointed if you're a fan of planet earth or other documentaries.  It is well made, very creative in their story telling.  It'll make you laugh, sad, and maybe for some make their stomach turn, and other times it captures the ""wow"" factor!",1332201600,,666,4.546218487394958

3944401,5,B002KSA4F6,"Must watch series! Amazing!

And my personal opinion (like it or not):

Thanks to Oprah's narration for bringing this used/like new Blu-ray 4-disc set to a reasonable price (11 bucks): 3 times less expensive than version with David Attenborough's voice, who was the only drawback for me on the amazing ""Planet Earth"" series, BTW. Sorry, he is too old now to enjoy his pronunciation despite of his knowledge and enthusiasm, I'd prefer Matt Damon's voice on the ""Planet Earth"" and ""Life"". Oprah Winfrey is not not the best narrator, indeed, but it's OK. With this stunning cinematography the narration is secondary for me, for information only. Thanks to set editors for the option to switch to music only mode without voice. If I need to know geographical location or animal/bird/etc name I can briefly turn subtitles on. Most of things on the set are quite clear and understandable just watching them without detailed explanation and/or human voice intervention.

I have actually only made it through the first two hours of the first DVD, but I am already so excited about this set.  The video and graphics are amazing and I have learned so many new things already just from the first two hours.  I really like how at the end of each hour (actually 45-50 minute) sessions they have a 10-15 minute blip from the videographers about there time filming those particular shots.  I will have to say though, that unlike Planet Earth where animals attacking and eating other animals was implied, these video's actually show it.  Some of it is rather gruesome and sad, but it IS the Circle of Life.  My 6 year old and 3 year old actually love watching this with us to and it definately gets them asking a bunch of questions especially during the hunting scenes but we just explain that if they didn't hunt whatever it is they were hunting then they would die because they have to eat too.  There have also been some mating scenes that I was worried about my 6 year old seeing, but he doesn't seem to get it yet so we don't shield his eyes from it (it's not visually apparent what's happening), however in a scene with snakes mating he made the comment, ""EWWW, they're stuck together"" and we just left it at that.  So even though I haven't seen more then two hours, I already am in love with this set and am so relieved that it doesn't have the same video as Planet Earth (at least so far) and that my kids can and do enjoy watching it and they have already learned things from it as well.",1329350400,4,1606,4.2947019867549665

David Attenborough is ""Biology""! (Summary for Teachers)

Teachers speak of teaching biology before and after David Attenborough in the United Kingdom. This is based on the impact of his earlier ""Life on Earth"" and ""Living Planet"" series. A younger David sat down among wild gorillas and personally dove in the Alvin into the abyssal ocean depths. Students held their breath as they came to hear biology in Attenborough's voice. The mere presentation of an animal's or plant's life has little story line.  Attenborough's personal involvement became the story line.  Several generations of students who saw life through his eyes shared his wonder.

He has continued to be involved in additional nature series. He still appeared in scenes in ""First Life"" (bought by the Discovery Channel and not available in the USA).  But the release of ""Life"" and ""Planet Earth"" has ensured that biology will continue to be mentally pictured through Attenborough's seasoned voice, just as many generations of Americans viewed world news through the intonations of Walter Cronkite.

Two audiences will perceive this high quality footage differently.  For viewers with significant outdoors experience, these smoothly transitioning segments are jaw-dropping. But for those electronics-addicted and nature-deprived youngsters, many of these scenes will lack ""awesomeness"" since the animation world has no constraint of being anchored to reality.

Attenborough is no longer seen on-screen but his voice holds these ten programs together. The  photography is high-definition quality. New technologies, including gyro vibration-damped helicopter cameras, now make available perspectives that were not possible a decade ago.  From satellite to microscopic imagery, it is difficult to imagine how biology will ever move to a time ""beyond Attenborough.""

Even if Attenborough is not ""in the picture,"" segments called ""On Location"" at the end of each of the 10 programs provide a story line of the camera men and women's adventure that should grip even the electronics-addicted students.

While some teacher editions in catalogs are ""teacher-proofed"" for undertrained biology teachers, the following outline is provided for the professional biology teacher who merely needs to excerpt a segment relevant to their biology coursework.

3944422,1,B002KSA4F6,"Like many other reviewers are also saying, while Life is an amazing BBC documentary this version definitely is not.  Why on God's green Earth anyone thought to replace Sir David Attenboroughs unrivaled commentary for Oprah Winfrey moronic babbling for the narraration defies explination. In addition to the unmatched narraration of Sir Attenborough it contains contains several hours of footage not included in the Oprah Winfrey version in addition to higher quality 1080 P video instead of the 1080 i that the Oprah Winfrey version has.  I assume they must of deleted of few hours of footage from the Winfrey version to make it easier for her extremely limited intillect to narrate.  During the Shallow Seas episdoe Oprah enthralls the viewer with informative commentary such as fish tend to live in the water and they like to swim.  Her moronic babble is mind numbing and is just plain embarassing to our country.  I shudder to think that the rest of the world thinks that Attenborough's excellent narration was replaced by Winfrey's because Americans demanded it or wanted it because based on the overwheling majority of the reviews out there we clearly don't.  I hope someone at BBC or Discovery channel reads these reviews and never does anything like this every again.  The fact David Attenborough has been knighted for his excellent career as a narrarator is proof that he is unrivaled in the field and his excellent body of work is something I have greatly enjoyed since I was a small child in the early 80s watching the Nature series on PBS.  Don't make the mistake I did and accidently buy the infinitely inferior Oprah Winfrey version first and have the rebuy this item to get the Attenborough version.

What a privilege it is to see wild animals undisturbed in their natural environments and no one accomplishes that like the crew of BBC and the talented, dedicated and educated David Attenborough... I wish David lots of health since he truly is indispensable... No better way of watching a nature documentary than having David as the narrator with his own unique accent and personality. Simply Bravo.

3944430,4,B002KSA4F6,"This 4 disc Blu-ray set contains some of  the most astonishingly defined cinematography I believe I've yet seen from a Blu-ray disc.  There are many shots that give the impression of being a 3D image and  I was glad that it contains David Attenborough's narration.

My one minor quibble is that I couldn't fight off the impression that the narrative content seemed to be aimed at children.  Very little was said about the evolutionary aspects of living things, which is what survival of life is really about.  I don't know if Sir David decided or was advised to soft-pedal this subject which, unbelievably, is still controversial, especially in the U.S.  If so, I feel very sorry for us, as a country, being left behind in the realm of scientific thought.",1318896000,2,755,4.7615384615384615
3944431,5,B002KSA4F6,"This DVD truly captures an animal's ""Life.""  It is a perfect DVD to watch in blu-ray format.  Oprah's voice is an added incentive.  We loved it!",1318809600,,144,4.461538461538462
3944432,2,B002KSA4F6,"I will first offer background on myself. Due to the controversy among reviewers, I think this context is important. I am a student of physical anthropology and evolutionary biology, as well as a naturalist and holistic healer. I appreciate both the technical aspects of the life sciences, as well as the more integrative, right-brained, and artistic perspectives on nature and the living world. Over the last year (due to an injury that left be bedridden and later still severely limits my ability to leave the house), I've watched documentaries on nature, biology, ecology, paleontology and physical anthropology frequently - about 1 - 3 episodes or films a week, usually on Netflix streaming, sometimes on Netflix DVD. My preference is for those that have both stunning visuals and well-informed but clearly understandable scientific narration. That said, I have eagerly watched nature shows geared towards the non-scientific audience, as well as those made for children. I'm not picky, and will watch just about anything except for stuff purporting 'intelligent design' as a scientific theory (although I am a religious person, ID is essentially creationism masked as science and the films, which amount to political & religious propaganda, do not belong in the category of biology/nature documentary...I'm offended netflix even puts them there). But that's another review. I say it only to say, they are the only shows about the living world that I have ever turned off (after being tricked by the synopsis). Until now.

I am familiar with David Attenborough's work, but when I saw Life offered on DVD, I did not know about his version. I think Oprah is an admirable woman in general, and did not think anything wrong with her being the narrator. I even thought she might provide a fresh perspective that was less dry than usual, which I would not have minded at all. And I did expect to see her face, and looked forward to her engagement with the subject. I am a committed anti-racist, and go out of my way to watch films where people of color are given the opportunity to play lead or heroic roles (which are usually given to white people without even considering equally talented people of color). So I was excited to finally see a woman of color narrating a scientific documentary (if you know of any others, do tell) and I popped the disc in with an open mind, a positive expectation, and significant enthusiasm.

The cinematography is wonderful. Some reviewers have complained about much of it being in slow motion. I loved this, as it illustrates many things you cannot otherwise observe in such detail - For instance, in a scene where a lizard chases a elephant mouse, you can study the difference between the limb arrangements and mobility of reptile vs mammal quadrapeds (reptiles legs attach out to the sides making them scuttle, mammals have a more vertical stance with their limbs directly under their bodies, which offers less stability but more agility...another tribute to evolutionary variation). Life includes some of the best shots I have ever seen.

However, the epic failure in Oprah's narration floored me. Disappointment is not strong enough a word. She is reading from a terrible script. I don't know who wrote it. If it wasn't her, I can only blame her for not discarding it, as she is probably the most powerful woman in the entertainment world and could have influenced such a decision. Ultimately, I must blame the production company for allowing this to be released in such a sorry state. The script she is reading is so dumbed-down, lacking in educational information, and devoid of any references to natural selection - the very basis of undertsanding the animal world, nevermind genetics-  that I would be embarrassed to even show it at an elementary school. It is at the cognitive level of Sesame Street.

However, it is far less engaging and educational than Sesame Street. Imagine Maria, off camera, doing mystery science theater 2000, audibly struggling to read from a script. Something along the lines of  ""Oooh Big-Bird. Look, at. that biiig bug...looks, like, it's going to, get-eaten! Big bugs don't sur-vive long in. the wild, Big Bird. They have, veeerrrry short. lifespans."" This is really my impression, I am trying to be truthful and not derogatory toward Ms. Winfrey. The script  is more the sort of vacuous commentary unintelligent people offer regarding commercials (wheres the beef, dude?), or, at best, the sort of patronizing explanation a kindergarten teacher gives to her charges (Apples can be red or green). It is extremely subpar for the narration of a semi-scientific, family-friendly odyssey about the life in our world, and how organisms survive and reproduce.

That would be bad enough, but for some inexplicable reason, Oprah offers none of the insight, wisdom, or intelligence that has propelled her thus far. Nor does her voice offer the rich sense of rhythm and engagement I have previously come to associate with it. It is obvious she is reading a script from a page, and she reads it in low monotone, with the occasional, I-know-better-than-you patronizing tone. This is not only baffling, as you might expect. It is absolutely jarring when juxtaposed against the epic work of the cinematographers, and after a few minutes, it became very distracting. I expected an explanation of what was going on visually, by a friendly but well-informed narrator. This was not only the absence of what I felt had been promised, it was much worse. It was the relentless presence of something that felt so distinctly *off*, fake, and at odds with the filming, that I could not make myself ignore it enough to enjoy the amazing visuals I was seeing. I hate to say it, I did not want it to be true, but I found Life to be  truly unwatchable. After about 10-15 minutes of optimistic struggling, the narration became such an impediment, I turned it off.

Though to my knowledge, this was not obviously advertised as a children's show, I believe that very young children would enjoy it. Even some grade school children. For that, and for the cinematography, it gets 1 star. It gets another star for just existing and offering a black, female narrator. I think that is important.  I considered giving 3 stars because of this, but ultimately did not feel that reflected the truth, considering my general tolerance for variation in nature films, and my inability to watch one episode of this one straight through.

Who really suffers as a result of this mismanagement? It doesn't do any wonders for Oprah's reputation, but she can afford not to care. I imagine many families of color would purchase this for their children, because the phenomenon of a black woman narrating a big-budget Nature documentary series is a seminal achievement in America (sadly this is still true in our day and age). But those kids, though they will benefit from knowing she achieved this role, and will enjoy watching the animals, will have to go somewhere else to get educational info about biology, ecology, or zoology.  And they deserve both representation and education at the same time. Considering the competition in science-realted professions, their rise in the global market, and the failures of the american public school system, particularly when in reference to children of color, it behooves any role model to provide American children with scientific information to bridge the educational gap that is created by underfunding, discrimination, poverty, and the general ""dumbing-down"" of America that targets the lowest common denominator.  Life should have been the antithesis of such dumbing-down, but instead it is a prime example.

Nevermind how the veritable trashing of Life by the scholarly will effect these kids, for whom Oprah represents a significant example of success, intelligence, and triumph over obstacles. Are there no scientists of color they could have casted? I suppose they thought Americans would only care about a black narrator who was ""famous"". This might well be sadly true, but she could have partnered with one, interviewing such a person throughout the film, asking them questions and drawing information out of them. That is, in fact, what Oprah does professionally.

Unfortunately, the American version of ""Life"" amounts to little more than a lot of pretty pictures and a wasted opportunity. Hopefully all involved in it's production will learn something from this mistake, even if the audience doesn't.",1318723200,8,8473,5.037116345467523

3944435,4,B002KSA4F6,"BBC Life documentary is great, cinematography is really fantastic. The american version is narrated by Oprah Winfrey, and while she does a good job, she fades in comparison to David Attenborough who narrated the British version. I am not sure why they've changed the narration in the American version, but having watched the American version, and several minutes of the British version, I got the impression that the American narration was simplified, and the evolution was de-emphasized, maybe to make the series appeal to a broader audience.
Great documentary overall, highly recommended to anyone interested in life sciences.",1317254400,2,628,5.418367346938775
3944436,1,B002KSA4F6,"I bought this by accident on another website not realizing it was the Oprah version. I didn't even know it existed. Oprah's narration is not only bothersome, it is dumbed down to the point that it is absolutely false. For example in the fish episode she talks about the mud skippers filling their lungs with air. They don't have lungs. ""They breathe gaseous air using a mechanism called cutaneous respiration, where the capillary rich lining of the mouth and throat acts as an oxygen absorbing membrane. They will gulp air and hold it in their mouths. They do maintain water in the gill chamber to keep the gills wet and will mix this water to enhance oxygen mixing in that water, but they have to have gaseous air to survive.""-quoted from a web source. But when she talks about their lungs it gets confusing as to what you are watching.
  She also says ""We know what happens next"" to refer to an animal mating or killing it's prey...basically anything that would take any depth to describe or anything that doesn't need description. She also uses's idioms such as an animal living the ""life of Riley."" Or that a place is a ""Goby Shangri la."" And she says things like that a hippo is ""Trailed by a school of fish just waiting for breakfast."" Her narration is really distracting from what is going on in the film. Worst of all she throws in words that she picked out of a thesaurus to sound authoritative, but they make her come across as condescending to the viewer. I enjoy it better with the narration turned off which is an option on the blu ray, but sadly the Attenborough narration is not an option. The way she says things may be nice for a kid, or an old person, or someone who has a mild mental retardation.
  Bottom line...if you want information or documentation from your documentary then get the Attenborough version. Haven't seen it yet, but have seen all his others, always a wealth of information. If you want to show your kids, then get this but your kids will grow up to be misinformed. They will probably end up like the water boy and think alligators are angry because they have all those teeth and no tooth brush.
  The camera work, and soundtrack in the movie are second to none. That being said he original version is apparently 1080p vs. the Oprah version I've seen in 1080i. Still looks stunning, but I have no idea why they would reduce the quality. Still absolutely amazing and beautiful. The ""making of"" sections of the disc are great...and feature original Attenborough narration.
  Also, I understand the British English of the original can be boring for some, but at least there is depth that makes it captivating. They should have had someone like Mike Roe do the American version.
  If this is what people in the UK think American's want then I feel really offended, and if American's decided to make it this why...maybe we really are just idiots.",1316908800,25,2879,4.594541910331384

3944440,5,B002KSA4F6,"Reading the other reviews, I see disagreement about which is better, Planet Earth, or Life. Planet Earth is the more comprehensive, but Life takes the opportunity to zero in on some especially fascinating examples of the animal kingdom. This is quite simply the most gripping and spectacular nature series I have ever seen. If you must choose between Planet Earth and Life, your decision could very well hinge on how big you would like your nature library to be. If you don't care whether or not you get the most complete coverage of all wildlife, and are happy to get the most intense thrills with the least number of discs, Life could be your better choice.

The videography knocks your socks off. I've never seen CGI or special effects as spectacular as what the film crew has been able to catch from real life. One sequence of crabs walking on the ocean floor reminded me of the huge machines on stilts from The Empire Strikes Back--I half expected the John Williams score to enter; but I guess that would have been too obvious.

The musical soundtrack, ominous to whimsical, goes beyond the routine to become a treat in itself.

Attenborough's writing and narration hit just the right tone, darkly dramatic to humorous. The facts dazzle in their own right: did you know that coral, yes the stuff of which the reefs are made, actually come to life and fight (eat) each other at night?

And, as if the programs themselves weren't amazing enough, the ""On Location,"" behind-the-scenes bonus material left me in absolute awe.

It is true that there is, in a general sort of way, some redundancy between Life & Planet Earth; however, almost all the actual footage is different in Life; and I believe that those who own, or have seen, Planet Earth, will find enough new in Life to make it worthwhile, and indeed almost essential.",1315008000,2,1827,4.714733542319749

However, when watching the discs I found that the discs were skipping sequences from my DVD player. I carefully observed the discs. I found there were long black marks on the disc due to over use of the player. Except one of the discs, that had a delicate scratch.

I was a faithful admirer of BBC documentaries ever since I was a child, and nothing has changed so far. Being a biologist, watching new documentaries with my kids is both business and pleasure.
This one is marvellous, with many scenes taken for the first time. There are a lot of familiar facts, but filmed in completely new way and that is what makes this series exciting to watch. All that, followed by the familiar voice of one and only David Attenborough, it will leave anyone in a bewildered owe!

Oprah sounds sub-par, and she was not the best choice to narrate Life. I've always known this, but I decided to blind myself to the truth. My change of heart came January 12th 2013 as I was reading other reviews of Life by Oprah, and that's when I came across a review by Rick. Rick says he is a naturalist, a student of physical anthropology, evolutionary biology, and a holistic healer. This guy is a true nature enthusiast, and it was the way he politely introduced himself first, that commanded my attention. And he has pointed out in a nice and gentle way, the absolute truth of just how dumb Oprah sounds, as if she's reading from an obvious terrible script. I had to be honest with myself and agree, that Oprah does indeed sound illiterate. I had bought Oprah version first, and I had no idea that another version was far superior. I read all the negative comments about Oprah's version, but I still refused to believe at first that it was not about racism. I tried to take the high road by defending Oprah, even with all the loud commotion being made regarding her voice. Now I've taken an even higher road by getting off the, Oprah can do no wrong band-wagon.

3944457,5,B002KSA4F6,"I bought ""Planet Earth: The Complete BBC Series"" and the ""Life"" series both narrated by David Attenborough on blu-ray.

The pictures are just stunning in quality.  Watching these in HD is the only way to go, and I highly recommend them both.

However, one thing I noticed after watching both sets of discs, is that there are a few bits of footage that are reused multiple times.  Its not a big deal, and even though I was close to dinging the product by 1-star for it, but if you go for a marathon viewing session, you will have very distinct moments of deja vu.

Even so, I still recommend both series.  These videos take you to places that are hard to imagine actually exist here on Earth - places where most people would not normally have an opportunity to visit.  Well worth the money, even if you have to sit through the Antarctica penguin scenes three or four times.

BTW, I noticed a few negative reviews regarding freezing or unplayable discs.  I am using a (relatively new) PS3 in the US, and playback has been 100% flawless...",1308528000,,1036,4.497326203208556

3944463,4,B002KSA4F6,"Pros: Absolutely amazing footage.  Narration turns each section into a story.  Appeals to multiple ages.  Runs the gamut from unbelievably cute (baby seals) to rather gruesome (baby seals being eaten).  My kids (10-22) tell their friends about it.
Cons: Focuses almost entirely on vertebrates (although, to be fair, one whole episode is insects, and an octopus makes a showing), and it makes not the slightest attempt to survey the classes and orders on which it does focus.  I took away a whole star simply because I wanted it to be 5x or 10x longer.  If you think that's grossly unfair, then consider this a 5-star item.

Summary: Don't use this as a substitute for studying your biology textbook!  It's not intended for that.  But it succeeds wonderfully at presenting vignettes (sometimes jaw-dropping) of the kinds of creatures most people think of when they hear ""Life.""

It was breathtaking and comprehensive.  So, I was a bit hesitant about ordering Life, thinking it would be redundant (as another reviewer suggested).  However, I found it to be a fantastic complement to that series.  There was a bit of overlap, but Life went into more details on, well, life.  I actually enjoyed this program more because it focused more on animals.  The BBC puts all other nature programming to shame with these two outstanding series.  The film/photography is literally stunning, and the footage they managed to captures comes close to being a miracle. The extras often go into detail on how long they had to film to catch particular segments (sometimes weeks for a minute or two of footage).  That was often as interesting as the show itself.

This is a wonderful program for the entire family. I was lucky to snag this for $20 during the lightning deals at Christmas, but I would not hesitate to pay full price. It is that good and the running time more than makes the cost reasonable. This program is worth watching again and again. These shows are so good, they make me worry about Britain's budget crisis because I would hate to see BBC funding get cut!  Highly recommended.",1307404800,4,1402,5.394495412844036
3944465,5,B002KSA4F6,"Shot entirely in HD over four years, ""Life"" is a must have for a blu-ray collection. Since I have a large collection of DVDs, I've been selective in the blu-rays I purchase. Usually, I only purchase films that I consider to be classics (Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, Full Metal Jacket, etc.) I understand none of those were shot in HD, but I've seen some that were. ""Life"" simply blows anything you've seen in HD away. I'm glad I strayed away from just sticking to classics. The expedition crews were able to capture footage never before seen. You will be amazed at what they were able to get on film with the super high-speed cameras. The cover shows a 'Jesus Christ' lizard running on water, and while that's an amazing sequence, it's only one of several standout segments in ""Life."" The humpback whale heat run and oak woodland timelapse segments come to mind as well.
David Attenborough is perfect throughout too. I'd advise against the Oprah version and stick with the original. You'll be amazed at this blu-ray set and will learn something as well. ""Life"" took four years to make and it shows in the quality of this set. It was four years well spent by the expedition crews.

3944468,5,B002KSA4F6,"As someone who climbed a mountain or two and dived into some unspeakably beautiful oceanic worlds, watched dolphins at play in their own habitat and spent a few days walking through what we used to call 'jungles' I know that no television experience can possibly replace actually being there. I also know that no human on Earth can possibly be to all the places the BBC crews covered in these series. And, thanks to their hard work, passion and BBC's equipping with the latest in HD gear, what came out is as close to 'being there' as today's technology allows it.

'Life' kept me and the rest of the family captivated often in awe for the four days we spent watching the series, limiting ourselves to one disc per evening to allow ourselves sufficient time to talk about what we were watching and to go back from time to time and replay some of the more stunning takes. I'm not going to say what 'Life' is about because it's not a story. The series was produced by a number of BBC crews who went all over the world to capture so that they could show the rest of us some of the more extreme, more beautiful, more striking and lesser known ways life forms on our Earth act in order to survive as individuals or as species, raise and take care of their offspring, hunt for prey, hide from predators, fight and sometimes cooperate in order to stay alive.

Except for the first episode which is a summary of what the rest of the series is about to present, each individual episode of 'Life' covers one specific theme, usually a broad class of life forms - birds, mammals - showing their specific characteristic, adaptations, some of their lesser known forms and behaviors and so forth. The last few minutes of each episode breaks the spell to some degree by showing us what the crew had to do in order to be able to show us the beautiful images we just watched.

This is what 'Life' presents:

DISC ONE:
- Challenges of Life
- Reptiles and Amphibians
- Mammals

DISC TWO:
- Fish
- Birds

DISC THREE
- Insects
- Hunters and Hunted

DISC FOUR
- Creatures of the Deep
- Plants
- Primates

'Life' does not cover everything but what is presented is beautiful and brilliant and it is so because the crews sometimes spent weeks and sometimes expose themselves to great risks just to capture some extraordinary few minutes and sometimes few seconds of 'never seen before' footage. Try to imagine diving without oxygen tanks in the middle of several 40-ton male whales engaged engaged in fight to the death for the right to mate, or spending three weeks following half a dozen hungry Komodo Dragons following a buffalo they've poisoned and waiting for it to die, or covering a lions vs. hyenas war. It's all awesome and informative.

Children will learn from watching this but I suggest that the younger ones don't watch it alone because life keeps itself going through an endless cycle of feeding which necessarily involves death. Yes, in many instances we see how well adapted organisms escape their predators but everyone needs to eat and not all the actors in these series are vegetarians. It would probably help if parents were around when seals feast on penguins or when the lovely killer whales are trying to turn a frightened seal into lunch.

Life shows extraordinary adaptations, the length to which some parents sacrifice to ensure that their offspring have a chance at their own life and the extreme risks the young adults take for a chance of becoming parents themselves. It's about feeding, surviving, seeking the next meal, taking care of the young and sometimes relaxing and having a little fun. It's fascinating, colorful, action-packed, incredibly beautiful and it's for almost everyone.

Time and again I have watched the ""Cosmos"" series narrated by Carl Sagan and couldn't help but feel my visual and auditory journey through the shores of the Cosmic ocean just felt...well...too intellectual. It was as if I was expected to take interest in the world outside of my daily psychological diet of biased newscasts and consumerist media and entertainment. I simply felt my world view and preconceived notions were too challenged. Seeing that there is a willingness to change the narration of scientific documentaries to make them more appealing to American audiences, I was elated that this precedent may continue not only going forward, but backwards as well and I wondered if there was a possibility of replacing the ""Cosmos"" narration with one rewritten to be more American in its perspective and perhaps read by Kim Kardashian or possibly the minister Rick Warren?

If you have an HD TV that can view video in the 1080p format (as most new ones do) you can definitely see the difference between the two.

3944517,5,B002KSA4F6,"This has to be one of the most spectacular documentaries ever filmed, and I would recommend this to anyone! There are ten total episodes, and they pretty much cover the gamut of ""life"" issues. The battle for a mate, the battle for food, and the battle to survive are the three primary aspects of focus, and all three are equally fascinating.

The first episode is kind of a generic overview of the premise of ""Life"" (and life itself). It's a great intro and, in fact, it was this episode I was able to see on a plane that gave me the desire to see the entire show. That said, because it's a generic overview, there is quite a lot of overlap with later episodes that deal with specific.

Episodes 2-6 deal with reptiles/amphibians, mammals, fish, birds, and insects--the bulk of the show's ""substance."" Several episodes have sequences that have never been filmed before, but EVERY episode has something that is jaw-dropping. I really don't want to spoil this for anyone, so let me just say it's completely mind-blowing to see some of the instinctual reactions of these various families of animals. Again and again and again I was amazed and astounded. (Really, I know I'm using a lot of hyperbole, but if you watch it you'll know what I'm talking about!)

Hunters and Hunted is episode 7--a variation on the theme of having episodes on different orders of animals. Nothing specific to call out on this episode, but if you're a big fan of seeing bigger animals *try* to eat smaller animals, this episode is for you!

The last three episodes go back to the former structure and cover creatures of the deep, plants, and primates. I've seen good documentaries on deep sea creatures before, so this was a little lackluster to me, but it still had fascinating stuff. The plant episode actually surprised me. They had to cheat quite a bit to get the filming of this episode, but I couldn't believe how interesting plant life really is--and how plants, without brains, have similar instinctual reactions to animals. The primate episode was like the grand finale, making the inevitable comparisons to humans, etc. (Personal view here--I don't believe humans are animals.) I will say this, the acts of kindness done by certain of the primates was quite touching!

Overall, this is really a priceless show, and I'm so impressed. I'm also anxious to see if some of the other BBC documentaries are as good as this. Feel free to let me know if you've seen them!",1295913600,,2446,4.7189695550351285
3944518,5,B002KSA4F6,"As an owner of several BBC documentary video titles, I can say that this presentation ranks near the top in the echelon of BBC's video offerings.  The four disk series is sub divided into two or three episodes per disk which is generally divided by biological order (i.e. fish, bird, reptile, mammal, etc.).  Each episode is then followed by a ""how they filmed it"" section describing the challenges the film crews went through to get the amazing footage; very similar to what is featured on the Planet Earth series.  The general theme of the series is the idea of how life constantly adapts to it's environment for survival and the results that natural selection plays in each biological order over time.  The presentation does not bog down into the scientific intricacies of the process or the explanation, but rather focuses on key, general topics that illustrate the point graphically.  Each episode is narrated by David Attenborough with just enough dialogue to explain what you are seeing but the incredible footage provides the detail.

The video quality of this series is absolutely superb.  I do not exaggerate when I say the high definition footage is astounding.  The clarity of the shots and the incredible action captured in the footage is worth the price of the series alone.  This is some of the best blu ray video quality I have seen and it easily surpasses the video quality level of the Planet Earth series in my opinion.  With a DTS sound track the audio is equally impressive to accompany the spectacular video imagery.  This series ranks high in being a title that you will want to re-watch; not only for the content of the narrative, but for the amazing presentation quality of video and sound that is sure to keep any audience in  quiet submission through each episode.

In my research I found that Life was consistently recommended by enthusiasts, and so decided to purchase it.

Not only was I blown away by the beautiful color and sound, but I found it to be positively the best nature series I have ever seen.  Life goes far beyond the usual nature show lion/zebra chase, in to the closed off and intimate lives of these animals as you've never seen it before.

And as a tech junkie, I found the making-of featurettes at the end of each episode very interesting as well.

3944556,5,B002KSA4F6,"As a regular British customer of Amazon I sometimes get my .com's confused with my .co.uk's, and end up on the American website instead.  So I sometimes find myself reading the comments of American reviewers when I am expecting to read the domestic varieties.  In recent times it has become a revelation to discover how even the most obscure productions from British television broadcasters have such an appreciative audience across the pond.
The apparent popularity of Sir David Attenborough over there is equally surprising as he has a reputation of being more of a professional zoologist, a scientist and an educator over here.  For all his virtues Sir David could never be described as being glamorous.  Our TV newsreaders for example, are universally plain, or even pug-ugly so as not to distract the audience from news broadcasts that have to be taken seriously. To those who prefer a `cuddly' and sentimental  view of Mother Nature, Sir David's commentaries might come across as rather too academic and a bit too serious to be taken in large doses.  Those of us who prefer to view nature ""Red in Tooth and Claw"" in all its raw, bloody cruelty, and are not put off in the slightest by the commentary sounding more like a lecture; and do not feel the need to be spoon-fed `Factoids' instead- then Sir David Attenborough is the man to front such a show.  He is a wildly popular media star in Britain. A `national treasure' that I think helps to explain why he tends to spend almost as much time in front of the camera as the flora and fauna he is describing.  I think most British viewers like it this way because we simply can't get enough of him.
My bookshelves are lined with BBC/Attenborough productions in DVD, and I thought that that would be that.  And then along came Blu-ray!  Wondering what all the fuss was about, I purchased this edition of `Life' in this new format as a kind of experiment.  There is no doubt that the images and sound are something of a revelation.  Although this production is a sort of condensed version of stuff that has already been published and I've seen most of it before, I am so glad I bought this.  Now I'm faced with the alarming prospect of having to gradually replace my whole Attenborough collection with these new Blu-ray versions when they are eventually released.  There is an alternative version of `Life' available narrated by Oprah Winfrey that is suitable for children, and grown-ups with short attention spans.",1292544000,5,2467,4.733644859813084

I was thrilled to find this version, narrated by David Attenborough, who I learned about animals from many specials growing up.  He just seems more natural to me and more of an authority whereas the Oprah version, which costs more by the way, seemed to me the ""dumbed down"" version -- no offense intended to Oprah fans.

The photography and imagery of this set is truly a sight to behold, absolutely amazing, breathtaking views.  In Challenges of Life on the first disc, we learn how many species have intelligently evolved their hunting techniques, from the cheetahs -- usually lone hunters, these three brothers found strength in numbers by hunting together, they can take down larger prey -- to the bottle-nosed dolphins off the Florida coast who have developed the mud-ring technique, all are incredibly filmed.

The set also includes behind the scenes footage.  Throughout the series, you explore all types of animal species from amphibians and reptiles, to birds, mammals, and fish.  Witness the arctic tundra as a lone seal plays cat and mouse with the ravenous orca.  It is eat or be eaten in the circle of Life, and I find myself rooting for both predator and prey.

Beautifully filmed, I cannot say enough about the photography.  Suitable for most ages, may want to warn some younger viewers as there is a particularly gruesome scene between a sea lion and a great white shark in which the sea lion loses, but most scenes are not so bloody.

Educational and exciting, a comedy, drama, action, and even romance all wrapped in one great package.  Nature is so amazing, you just can't make this stuff up.",1290988800,3,1739,4.818181818181818

3944578,5,B002KSA4F6,"I usually never write reviews but am making an exception for this one. Because I have to ask the other reviewers. Seriously guys what really is all the fuss about.

Let me put the record straight here. Life narrated by David Attenborough is retailing for 42 dollars at amazon.com whereas this version narrated by Oprah is retailing for 17 dollars. The box set contains 4 discs and about 11 hours of high definition stuff making it the cheapest blu-ray at amazon.com. Also for the 25 dollars you save by ordering this version; you can buy 2001 space odyssey, master and commander and Dark Knight. So I ask again, Guys what is the fuss all about???

The narration of Oprah Winfrey is just different to David. In my opinion, David while being a terrific narrator puts my children to sleep whereas Oprah has a more of a story telling aura to her. I could never make my child watch Planet Earth (narrated by David) however he gladly watches Life with Oprah narrating. Plus, Oprah is not quarter as bad for adults as people have penned down here.

To sum it up David's voice might be better for adults but Life at 17 dollar a pop with oprah's voice is just a steel. So go ahead order this version and with the money you save order some other terrific blu-rays out there. My recommendations for cheap blu-rays for terrific audio and video quality include:

1. Master and Commander
2. The Dark Knight
3. 2001 a space odyssey
4. Day after tomorrow
5. Bolt
6. Casino Royale
7. Live Free or Die Hard
8. Spider Man 3
9. Black Hawk Down
10. Iron Man.",1290038400,12,1537,4.459074733096085

I literally had to turn it off because I was feeling suicidal.  Is this what British people think Americans want?  I immediately went to Amazon and ordered the Attenborough version of Life, which is well worth it.  I'm just pissed I overlooked the fine print saying which version of Life was in the set...

Dave Attenborough on the other hand is probably The Expert in the world about the subject. I own most of his nature DVDs. His knowledge, skills, and passion are infectious. I am glad that I now can buy his version, the original ""Life"".",1287273600,5,723,4.4772727272727275

Much better than Discovery's version narrated by Oprah Winfrey.  I have seen both and Attenborough just has that classic coolness and excitement about him.  Plus, he actually deals with animals so he understands and knows what he is saying, where as Oprah is just more for trying to Americanize and already great series!",1287187200,2,439,5.228571428571429
3944594,1,B002KSA4F6,WOW!  I got this last week without reading any reviews.  Brought it home and immediately started watching with the family.  We could not make it through the first episode.  The narration is the worst I have ever heard in a documentary!  It sounded as if Oprah was reading a bedtime story to 4 year olds!  Who-ever it was at the BBC that decided it would be a good idea to get Oprah to replace the original narrator should be fired immediately!  I will be getting the original BBC version!,1286928000,5,488,4.415730337078652

My friend wanted to show me Life and I was very excited because I loved Planet Earth.  I didn't know who the narrator even was at the time, but it took less than a few minutes to realize it was absolutely terrible narration.  I also guessed that it was Oprah and decided that I no longer am indifferent towards her after watching just a single episode of Life with her voice.  Just like what everyone else has said, she is condescending and I am literally embarrassed to be listening to her narration while I am around other people because if I enjoyed it, then I am an idiot.  At least, that's how she makes me feel with this piece of work.  Do yourself a favor and enjoy Life the way it was meant to be experienced...watch the original BBC version.  I'm not even a big fan of Sir David, but I've grown a new-found respect for his work as I realize that not anybody can just grab a microphone and walk you through the absolutely stunning video.",1286841600,5,1110,4.252380952380952

David Attenborough has been making and narrating natural history videos since the 1950s.  The BBC has the best track record of any natural history unit on the planet.  Most of the ""groundbreaking"" specials on Discovery of National Geographic you see are re-makes of BBC originals.  The same is true of ""Life"".  And there is no reason for this.  The originals far surpass any remakes.  Find out for yourself.  Skip out on this version, cause you already saw it on the Discovery Channel already.

3944607,5,B002KSA4F6,"As it should be, the enjoyment factor and quality of this documentary is on par with Planet Earth, A1!  The same company from the BBC produced this series and it SHOWS!  I agree with most reviewers here that David Attenborough breathes life and passion into this documentary and would shy totally away from the U.S. version narrated by Oprah Winfrey!  I saw a little of the U.S. version with Winfrey, at a friends house, and knew right then that I would wait to get the BBC version.  Oprah's dialog is more monotone and not nearly as engaging, as Attenborough's! He is , IMHO, along with Morgan Freeman, the most interesting and colorful narrator out there for documentaries. If you loved watching Planet Earth, you will love LIFE!  It is also well worth purchasing the Blu-ray, if you have the components to watch it on!
  FYI...I just ordered ""Wonders of the Solar System"" on Blu-ray, just recently released, but have not received it yet!  It is also produced by the BBC and narrated by Brian Cox, who I have never heard (I believe)narrate,  It will be interesting to see how good Cox is at narrating documentaries.  The Blu-ray is still rated by customers at 5 stars, so I am almost sure it will be just as engaging!",1285027200,,1219,4.601851851851852

3944609,5,B002KSA4F6,"Life is sort of a semi-sequel; you might call it, to Planet Earth. Again, it takes you all over the planet looking at various things, but this time instead of focusing on different climates and geographical regions of the Earth, it displays the living creatures that inhabit it. It is also, a condensed version of the 9 ""Life"" series by Sir David Attenborough. If you have not seen any of those, this would be a good introduction as it is narrated by David as well.

On that note, make sure you pick up this (the BBC) version and not the Discovery Channel title, which was narrated (atrociously) by Oprah Winfrey. In addition to substituting David's narration with Winfrey's, they have also re-written most of the original narration, the music has been redone, and the episode structure has been reformatted to better appeal to ""an American audience"". They were able to keep Mr. Attenborough's narration and George Fenton's music intact for the Discovery Channel broadcast of ""The Blue Planet"", (which was very successful) but for some reason, they think that Americans will no longer accept this. Why? I don't know. Let's forget about the stupid decisions of the Discovery Channel though, and move on to the program which is spectacular!

The episodes are arranged as follows...

Disc 1:

Challenges of Life

Reptiles and Amphibians

Mammals

Disc 2:

Fish

Birds

Disc 3:

Insects

Hunters and Hunted

Disc 4:

Creatures of the Deep

Plants

Primates

From the first sequence you are immediately hooked, while watching from a fantastic aerial viewpoint, a bunch of dolphins corralling a group of fish in a circle of mud. This behavior has been filmed before, but not quite this well before, and this applies to many moments in this series, you may have seen it before, but you'll be seeing it in a new light or from a different point of view. The whole program has a very fresh feel about it; it does not feel like a watered-down retread of previous programs at all.

There are also many, many completely new behavioral segments filmed for the first time in this series. The box says 54, and there were definitely at least that many. Over and over, I was saying, ""Why didn't I know that?"" and ""How have I not heard about this before?"" or ""What the?!? No way!"" I have never seen cheetah's hunt an ostrich before, or a pebble toad escape a giant spider, or knew that a mudskipper keeps its young under the mud and has to keep refueling their oxygen supply by gulping in some air, swimming through his underground chamber and  then ex-hailing on the eggs! I could go on, and on.

As you would expect from the BBC Natural History unit, the footage is absolutely jaw-dropping and filmed in crystal-clear perfect quality. The close-up footage of chameleons, time-lapse footage of plants, and fantastic aerial views from a lamergheir's eye view are incredible and rich with detail. And I'm only talking about the DVD here; I can only imagine how spectacular the Blu-ray looks!

The sound is also full and very clear and there is a perfect balance between narrator and music, David is never drowned out. It's a shame that there will be no soundtrack as there was for ""The Blue Planet"" and ""Planet Earth"". The music George Fenton composed was as good as ever and I would have loved to hear it separately from the program.

Occasionally, sound effects are used that are obviously not natural that I know some people didn't like in past programs such as ""Blue Planet"". A good example of this is the Venus Fly-Trap sequence, when a fly's leg hit's a hair-like trigger on the plant and a ticking bomb sound is heard until the plant crunches down. There is even a burp when the plant opens up again, it's subtle but I think they may have gone just a tad bit too far with that one. I think that it can be easily overlooked though, and throughout the series, it's never really very distracting.

Again, this program continues the tradition of ending each episode with a 10 minute making-of feature, and I really hope they continue this for a long time to come. In these, ""Life on Location"" segments you see how they constructed a 2-year woodland plant-growth time-lapse shot (that only lasts about 45 seconds) and the work that went into it is just mind-blowing. You also get to see how they achieved the shots of monarch butterflies flying high above the ground at their wintering migration site. These are only a couple examples of the lengths that went into the making of this program, and they are easily as fascinating, and incredible as the program itself.

Overall, this is a wonderful documentary that I think, lives up to ""Planet Earth"" in every way. It's informative, and has some of the most spectacular wildlife imagery ever filmed. Really, with the BBC and David Attenborough on the box, this whole review wasn't even necessary. If you don't already own it, get it now, highly recommended!",1284336000,6,4888,4.723529411764706

Having viewed portions of the US version as ""dictated"" by an often smug and slurring Winfrey, I quickly ordered the real deal.

They even provide a short ""Making of"" section after each episode explaining how they were able to get those amazing images on film in the first place. Its educational, exciting and something the whole family will enjoy watching together.",1284249600,,467,5.24
3944624,5,B002KSA4F6,"We purchased this for our 4 year old son, who is nature-obsessed! We had found that a lot of documentaries were too gory or distressing for him. This one really fits the bill. Obviously animals get killed, but on the whole they get killed off camera!

I am constantly amazed at HOW they got these films and WHERE was the photographer was to be able to film the scenes. (the photographers went through a LOT to get these scenes.) Our whole family has been interested in this, down to the grandchildren, and they are interesting to see over and over.  The unusual scenes really do hold your interest - even the kids.

He asks to watch it again and again. The narration is written to draw the viewer into the drama of what they are seeing, and though they are sometimes ""dumbed down"" or made into cutesey allegories with small words even children can understand, this actually works quite well for young children. The few times I have sat down with him, it's been entertaining viewing for me too. Though I can understand that serious naturalists should perhaps look elsewhere, the visuals are stunning and overall make for a good way to introduce my kids to the wonders of the natural world.

IF Oprah did it from the beginning and they changed it to the other guy, they would be complaining about him.  She speaks clearly and personally it's sounds better than a low monotone male voice, that usual puts people to sleep.

With all the ""Life"" that there is in the world, it seems completely absurd that they show the same animals performing the same behaviors in different episodes.  Additionally, some of the shots are computer generated.  Again, we're supposed to be seeing Life here, not a representation of it.  It definitely did not live up to the extremely high bar that Planet Earth set, and I would recommend waiting until this is really cheap to buy on DVD - and definitely the David Attenborough version!",1280793600,5,717,4.796747967479675

Sure, this series is a great tool for showing off how awesome your $3,000 TV is, but it's much more than that.  When I watched the first scene, where dolphins would trick fish into jumping into their hungry mouths, I knew I'd be in for a treat.  The writing, combined with David Attenborough's narration, make for a very interesting documentary that can be enjoyed by the whole family.  It's simple enough for everyone to enjoy, but sophisticated enough that you don't feel like you're being read a bedtime story (unlike Oprah's narrated version).

I'm going to assume that you already know this is awesome, so I won't talk about that part at all, and I'll mention the things that suck about this.

First and foremost, as mentioned above, make sure you get the real version and not the one with Opera.  Secondly, the foley work in this is terrible.  There are all kinds of loud distinct noises that just don't sound like they go with with action on the screen.

Instead of the organic instruments they have used in the past, it now sounds like a mutated version of Toy Story.  The whole thing would be totally awesome if I were seven again, but I need more.  The info is lacking, the narrating is unbelievable and uninspired, the sound effects are obnoxious...a true disappointment, but not nearly as disappointing as it is for all the photographers who slaved and provided stunning visuals, the only reason this got any stars at all.

3944803,1,B002KSA4F6,"I am a loyal BBC fan, and own many of their previous Attenborough-narrated series.  Usually, the cinematography is fabulous, the subject matter remarkably fascinating, the narration inspiring, and overall the result is brilliant.  They're educational movies that you absolutely love seeing.  Not with this series however, thanks to the incredibly indefensible choice of Oprah as a narrator.  Whoever came up with the genius idea of using her voice instead of Attenborough should at the very least be fired, if not sued for ear injury.  I'd give this zero stars if Amazon allowed it.

After having endured the first few episodes and finally given up on watching the rest,  I can honestly say I am a fool for spending the money without knowing the original Attenborough narration is also available.  Sadly, turning off the pathetic narrated audio and leaving the subtitles still distracts from the brilliant visual material.  This version is totally unwatchable for anyone who actually uses the English language to communicate.  It lacks both the usual BBC depth of content, and any attention to the spoken word itself.  Regardless of who is at fault for the corny modified dialogue (as it's clear from the narration that Oprah had no concern for the subject matter), she cannot manage to pronounce even the apparently dumbed-down material.  As an example, she regularly alternates between ""shpecies"" and ""species"" and cannot manage to pronounce ""Antarctica"" after numerous random tries.  She's a frickin zillionaire, could she maybe pay a voice coach?  Regardless, the end result here is utter misery.  Definitely not one I thought I would ever see/hear on a proper BBC series.

May I suggest perhaps that Oprah have a special show, where they give away the original version of the series to guests, after refunding to them the money they've spent on this load of dung?  I've just re-ordered the original Attenborough-narrated version, and if I could return this garbage I would; Oprah's ""Life"" will be going to the refuse bin instead.",1279497600,5,2034,5.133738601823708

3944807,5,B002KSA4F6,"""Life"" DVD is one of the most remarkable documentary movies I've ever seen. It is created by the BBC Earth team who released similar works, such as the ""Planet Earth - as you've never seen it before"" and the ""Nature's Most Amazing Events"". All these movies share a similar structure describing our beautiful and bizarre planet with their inhabitants, as well as few descriptions of a challenging event, such as filming in the water with prey and predators, waiting many days for an expected event to happen, and so on. The BBC Earth team spent three years of continuous efforts to produce this marvelous piece of work.
Although similar with the above mentioned documentary movies, ""Life"" has a slightly different structure. The first episode of disc one, ""Challenges of Life"" describes a summary of how many species of animals and plants live on Earth followed by few short sequences that most of us didn't get the chance to see. For instance, this introductive episode describes the hunting technique of dolphins, the band of brother cheetahs hunting an ostrich, the chameleon hunting insects, the surviving of a sea lion from an orca attack, the flying fish away from the predators, the feeding technique of capuchins, the Venus Flytrap plant, the stalk-eye insect, the fighting hippo for mate, the grebes courtship ritual, the octopus ultimate sacrifice for brood, the poison arrow frog motherhood, the chinstrap penguin survival, the orangutan motherhood. The most challenging episode was filming in Antarctica.
The following episodes contain a description of the previous events as well as others in more details and in a larger context. These are: ""Reptiles and Amphibians"", ""Mammals"", ""Fish"", ""Birds"", ""Insects"", ""Hunters and Hunted"", ""Creatures of the Deep"", ""Plants"", and ""Primates"". All episodes contain astonishing events, but perhaps the most amazing one is about the ""Jesus Christ Lizard"" able to walk on water to run from its predators.
I wish I could have these films when I was a student in middle and high schools. My children are luckier as they've already got the chance to see these educational movies. I strongly recommend you to get the chance to see these films.",1279411200,,2185,5.106145251396648

Like Planet Earth, rather than get the Sigourney Weaver narration, I had to wait for the David Attenborough narrated version.

These BBC documentaries are awesome and highly enjoyable.  From the ambient sounds to the crystal clear high quality video, I learn while I watch.  I get to see nature very candidly as the producers and camera crews were meticulously detailed in capturing nature.

Until I read these reviews I didn't even know that Attenborough first narrated Life, and I can certainly see where his expertise would make him perfect for this. But to be honest, having just watched this series, I found Oprah to be quite tertiary to the entire experience. I focused easily on the splendid cinematography and symphonic score and barely noticed the narration, and when I did it was never as horrific as many here make it out to be. Why all the hating? Put on yours stereo instead!

So let's focus on what's great about Life, which is almost everything: phenomenally gorgeous images from around the globe, above and below water, of so many different life forms, doing their mating dances and other wacky rituals that make one realize how very similar all creatures on our big blue ball really are, homo sap included (though most of these critters aren't stupid enough to foul their own habitat over and over until they have to move elsewhere; wish I could say the same for one species I know). The slow-mo shots are especially sweet, the water frozen in the air in endless states as its gift--life--flows on all around.

The pictures do all the talking here, and narration is mostly an afterthought and hardly integral to understanding and glorying in what one sees. If Oprah is so tough on your ears, simply turn off the volume and put on some Debussy or Beethoven or Sibelius and enjoy the many synchronicities bound to occur between sound and sight.

This has some pretty raw moments of animal-on-animal ""violence"", but I'd still heartily recommend this for families and schools, if perhaps not the youngest of kiddos. But there's not a gun to be found, just natural life doing what it does, so do your kids a favor and show them these fine films in lieu of yet another Hollywood ad for gunpower. In fact, Oprah might be more up your kids' alley than Attenborough, so turn that supposed negative into a positive!

And whatever you do, don't let the many nay-sayers here dissuade you from seeing this extraordinary panorama of life, in supremely crisp blu-ray quality. I'd watch it again with Attenborough in a second, which is to say, it's worth watching with any narrator, even Rocky and Bullwinkle.",1279152000,2,2229,4.734536082474227

For those of you who care - definitely make sure you pick up the BBC version (narrated by Sir David Attenborough).  Otherwise, you're going to be very disappointed by the US version that's narrated by Oprah.  (yes, Oprah)

The best improvement here over the Planet Earth blu-ray set is that the little ""making-of"" vignettes are included at the end of each episode.

I buy most of my things through [...]..he let's me know what/when/where/price..he does all the research for you..and you get his newsletter once a day with the deals..not many..the most would be 15 /day to look at..so sign up..I have made at least 25 purchases through his research...and this DVD was an example of one buy...I loved the Discovery series,got a Sony Bluray & LG Flatscreen(from Brads)...and my FIRST bluray DVD was this series. I was so HAPPY to find out that someone other than Oprah was narrating it & somewhat surprised cause I know she is super picky about projects. I guess for the American audience they did her voice & for everyone else David's voice as it is BBC's production. I did get a bit tired of hearing Oprah's voice around hour #5...I never tire of Davids voice..it has always calmed me and I always relate his voice to anything to do with nature. As a kid, way before any of these specials, I was fascinating by anything to do with nature. I could spend hours looking at an ant farm in my back yard..How the heck did they know where to go and find their way BACK home?? those were my thoughts at 7/8/9 years old..not to mention the butterflies and how the heck did they come out of the worm thing???...always fascinated me and as an adult, it takes me further & more interested now more than ever about our environment. If you have ANY joy at looking at nature films, this bluray series is just FOUR discs and about 16 hours of breathtaking capture of nature at it's BEST!.They spared not a penny or PATIENCE from the naturists in waiting for the SHOT!!..they have the making after each hour..you will see how long these people waited to get that ONE shot of flying fish or that white shark/whale? taking a chance in getting a meal to beach himself for that baby seal..some people can not watch this BUT they will eat a whole piece of steak!!..that is what amazes me also..I am in the medical field..I didn't choose it, it chose me and all for a living..but it made me happy to be on this Earth and to respect EVERY living creature(I TRY very Hard living in NYC) to do that..from humans, right down to the rats/mice I see sometimes..you gain a respect  and somehow know there's a meaning to living side by side to these amazing creatures. I was blessed to visit The Great Barrier Reef, the largest living creature on this planet viewable from space..you get there,I swear..you feel like you are NOTHING compared to what is going on around you..your life is minuscule, compared to what is happening around you...so pay attention when you walk in your local gardens,forests,gardens..there's a whole community happening down there...party WITH THEM!!

Nothing against Oprah; I just happen to enjoy my nature documentaries narrated by Sir David.  And he is head-and-shoulders above Oprah when it comes to this type of thing!!  The elegance of the blu-ray cinematography (which is truly stunning, by the way) seems to deserve the eloquence of Attenborough's crisp, British delivery.  They complement one another so well!!  And the bonus clips that show how the film's producers achieved some of the more stunning shots might be some of the most amazing portions of the entire series.

BBC has made a serious mistake by encoding this new Life series using VC1, or rather WVC1, a modified codec that only Windows uses. That said, the obvious effect when played back by any common Bluray player is Oprah's voice is drown out in the background music, making it impossible to play it softly at night.
Second and deadly flawed is there's no software media player currently available that would play this nearly abandoned VC1 format, not even MS Windows Media Player. That's it.
They goofed up seriously. The previous series from BBC that I own including Planet Earth were encoded by H.264 that turn out to be beautiful and current and relevant. I wonder why they changed it?

I've grown up on these things and have watched them evolve from hours upon hours of sharks and crocodiles to the cinematics and photographic technology of Life and Planet Earth.  I was truly looking forward to Life; as I thought Planet Earth was one of the greatest, informative and intriguing series I had seen.  Life, however, completely fell short.  They champion following over 200 species through life and death and survival; from my personal perspective, I thought it completely GLAZED over informative opportunities and that the disconnect in transitions didn't deepen my engagement but allowed me to wander off in thought and activity.

That being said, although I am sure the Attenborough narration is excellent and in many ways superior to Oprah Winfrey's version, think about the audience. Many reviewers have stated that the Winfrey version is suitable only for children. I don't think that is such a bad thing. If you are an adult, and are interested in the ""unabridged"" version, then certainly buy the Attenborough version. If, however, your audience is younger, less educated, an English Language Learner or just someone new to the idea of documentaries, the Winfrey version is perfectly suitable. I don't feel she came off as ""snarky"" at all. She was measured, calm, and made the content easy to follow and understand. Her rhythmic,almost melodic pace matches the beautiful scoring. Contrary to comments made by others, English accents, even one as beautiful and concise as David Attenborough's, are sometimes hard to understand for those who are uninitiated. There are students in middle and high school who simply don't have the exposure to British English to listen to it effectively, and some or much of the content would be lost.

First the lumping together of Reptiles and Amphibians, where reptiles are closer to birds in the animal family tree.
Second the complete omission of turtles in that episode, and the dwelling on the slow and tedious komodo dragons hunting.
Third the Deep sea creatures episode, where very little of it was deep sea and most of it was mollusks, why not call it mollusks and their kin?
Fourth the Hunter and Hunted episode, what family group is that?
And lastly the monkeys and apes episode. what haven't we seen of monkeys and apes?  why dedicate a whole episode to them when entire family groups are totally ignored?
The plant episode was very well done I must admit, and the komodo dragons were interesting but too much airtime was given to the slow killing of the ox.

3944869,1,B002KSA4F6,"I have been a long time fan of nature documentaries. I have seen just about every major and minor series out there, so I can safely say that I am not unfamiliar with what makes or brakes a good nature program. Film quality, editing, narration and subject matter all have their parts to play. Some will be a bit stronger in one area over another, but rarely will there be such a glaringly negative portion of a show/series present, which makes it unwatchable. This is one of those shows. The narration work done by none other than queen bee Oprah Winfrey is quite simply ATROCIOUS. She has a bad sense of timing. It seems like she is reading a script for the first time as she speaks. It makes the audience feel as though she is speaking to a five year old. Her grasp of the subject matter is clearly lacking.(Very little background in anything nature related.) And the worst part is that this is all very distracting, and takes a lot away from the overall experience. Basically, if I want to watch some of it, I pretty much have to mute the sound. Luckily, you can now get this series with the original BBC David Attenborough narration. I can not presently comment on his work in this, because I have not seen that version. I am confident that he does is usual great work though.
  As for the other facets of the series. Very well done, overall. Much of it is a rehash of a lot of work previously done in Blue Planet, Nature, The Wild series, Planet Earth etc. etc. but there are some nice new interesting tidbits here. As expected the film quality is very good, especially in HD.  If you want a more original,new(ish) series,with much better narration. I highly recommend the Wild series. Wild Pacific and Wild Russia are top notch.

Steer clear of the Discovery Oprah version. Get the BBC Attenborough version.

Also it has a lot of repeat material.  Like an overview and then a a recap of the overview with a lot of stuff.  So it felt as if you were watching a greater majority of the material twice.  Although it comes in 4 disks it could have been done in 2 to 3.

It follows much of the same format as The Planet Earth series in the intro, story, and how it was filmed.  It is good stuff, but if you have not watched the Planet Earth Series yet I cannot say enough about how good it really is.

Despite many reviews stating the contrary, I actually enjoy listening to Oprah narrating to me as each scene plays out in the background. Her voice did not sound ""motherly"" nor did it sound like she was talking down on the viewers as if we were pre-adolescents.  After having listened to her continuously throughout the first 2 discs and still couldn't understand what all the fuss was about, I decided to take out my Planet Earth blu-ray to hear it for myself once again what Mr. David Attenborough sounded like.  Sure, he was a great narrator, and I""m sure he did just as wonderful of a job narrating the BBC version of LIFE as he had done with Planet Earth, I just honestly didn't think Ms. Winfrey was as bad as I was falsely led to believe from all the negative reviews on the internet.  I'm glad I got this Discovery version, because the pacing of the program was excellently arranged in ways that never bored me for a minute.  The newly crafted music that Discovery had gone out of its way to compose exclusively for this version was truly beautiful.  I thought it was very convenient that viewers were also given the option to watch the program with just the music playing in the background (there is also another option to turn the subtitle on so this way viewers can read about what's actually happening in each scene if they so prefer to not listen to the featured audio narration work done by Oprah).  Overall, LIFE is a gorgeous visual feast (1080i? didn't even notice.  I thought it looked even better than most blu-ray movies that were allegedly produced in 1080p).  And don't hate me for my personal humble opinion of Ms. Winfrey.....I thought she was excellent.  She sounded like she had a lot of fun working on this film and it also seemed like she truly enjoyed watching it.  All of this was evident by the lightness and enthusiasm in her voice.",1276732800,24,1987,4.553370786516854

After looking through the store availability online and calling a few different stores, it became apparent that this large chain store DOES NOT carry the British version in its stores (just online).  It is insulting enough that Americans need a ""special"" version, but even more infuriating that it isn't even available in-store; thus leaving me stuck with an inferior piece of garbage that I cannot return or exchange or even sell as used because, frankly, anyone interested in documentaries would be sure to avoid this version like the plague.

More likely, Oprah demanded the position as narrator. She's an admitted fan of the Planet Earth series, and now has partnered with Discovery Networks to have her own channel. We all know she's a narcissist. She always puts herself on the cover of her own magazine every month, which she named after herself and her TV show, which is also named after herself.

Oprah's voice is abrasively post-menopausal, and she speaks condescendingly, with an irritating monotone, as though she's addressing an audience of unruly children.

Just like the narration, the writing has been hideously dumbed down for the dumbed down masses that Discovery Networks believe Americans to be.

Before watching Life, I was neutral about Oprah. But now, I hold nothing but contempt for the snarky, condescending witch that would have ruined the series if weren't for the availability of the BBC version. I finally understand why so many people hated Oprah for so long.

I don't know about anyone else, but the notion that Americans are too stupid to understand a well-spoken Brit is foolish, and quite offensive to Americans and English alike.

Much of the footage is as good as Planet Earth, but you don't feel like you are watching planet earth over again. Every episode has several clips that will glue you to the screen.

I went on to tell Discovery... that Oprah is a lovely woman. Does a great job with her talk show... but.... She ""talked-down"" to the audience as though we were 2 years old or nit-wits.

But, this person never told me there was a BBC version, narrated by the very talented David Attenborough.

Was it Oprah's idea to talk to the audience as though she were reading a bed time story to a small child. (Her ""animated"" sound effects were very irritating).

While Planet Earth was amazing and offered more than just that, it was material that gets old watching again and again.  'Life' offers a four-disc set with a wide array of material as Oprah Winfrey takes the helm as narrator.

While I prefer David Attenborough in this role, Oprah does quite a good job.  There has been a lot of banter on the reviews here criticizing her work.  There is nothing wrong with it.  I will admit, I was not crazy about the idea of her narrating at first.  However, after a few minutes into the program, I was almost instantly drawn in.  If you want an example of a bad celebrity narrator, refer to one of the oceanic Imax discs with Jim Carrey doing the talking.

Choosing the right narrator is of utmost importance for an educational series about science, and I'm sorry but her voice does not have an authoritative quality for scientific programming.  Let's face it, Oprah is known for her daytime talk show so her voice naturally will make the listener think of that.  Just a horrendous choice to narrate this wonderful series.  What's next?

I thought that the music was poor and repetitive, with the same distinctly ""poignant"" piece played in every episode, and the episode wrap ups were not very well done. Also, scenes were unnecessarily repeated, like the not-particularly-interesting ibex scene. Enough has been said about the Oprah-Attenborough issue. However, I was still excited to buy the BBC release when it came out.

What I got was an entirely different product. The score was completely different and of the quality found of Planet Earth and Nature's Most Amazing Events. Also, there are some scenes which were not included on the American broadcast, most notably a scene in the first episode of leopard seals hunting penguin chicks. I think this scene was removed from the American version because it was too graphic (and it is up there), and thus was replaced by the repeated ibex scene. There were others that I hadn't seen before, though I haven't seen the Oprah version in a while so I don't remember all of them. The scenes were shown in different sequences as well.

Then on disc 3, the scene is repeated again, but with Oprah providing different narrative. There is another segment on disc 1 of three cheetahs hunting an ostrich successfully. Again, on disc 3, the same scene of the cheetahs hunting the ostrich is repeated, but with Oprah providing different narrative. Jeers to the producer, editor, and to Oprah for knowingly releasing such a poor documentary yet charging such an expensive price to an unsuspecting public expecting quality.

Additionally, apparently neither the scriptwriter nor Oprah know how to speak proper English grammar. For example, Oprah begins a sentence in one of her narratives with the words ""It's got...."". I am not an expert in journalism or in English usage, but even I know that the proper way of beginning the sentence should have been with ""It has...."". Come on!

Simply put, this series is about the struggle for life on planet Earth and the marvelous strategies that animals and plants have developed to survive, procreate, and pass on their genes. It features some of the most lavish and amazing nature shots ever filmed.

I watch a lot of nature documentaries and I am continuously amazed, surprised, and impressed by what the BBC cinematographers manage to do, the rare and beautiful sights they are able to capture, and the artistry, dedication, and attention they devote to their work. I loved&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Planet-Earth-The-Complete-BBC-Series/dp/B000MRAAJM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Planet Earth: The Complete BBC Series</a>, but I think I love Life even more because it spends more time with a smaller number of subject so you get to see more footage of their behavior. Whereas Planet Earth went for breadth, Life goes for depth. For example, each subject gets 5 minutes of screen time or more devoted to it.

I would say what also separates this series from Planet Earth is that Life gets up close and personal, using a lot of macro shots and slow-motion photography whereas Planet Earth shows a lot of aerials, wide-shots, and panoramic vistas. Very often in Life is an extreme closeup, either in slow-motion, high-speed photography, or sped up in time-lapse, with the action all set to a perfectly orchestrated soundtrack. Within the first few minutes of Episode 1 (series overview/synopsis episode), you'll see the style of cinematography that runs through the series. For example, we see a chameleon in a tree stalking praying mantises and slow motion photography of its tongue shooting out to grab its prey. In another scene, we see a slow-motion hippo fight with gaping mouths and water artfully splashing around, set to dramatic music. In yet another scene (this time from Malaysia), we see another close-up of a strange insect swallowing in air and then forcing the bubbles up into its head to inflate its eyes like a balloon! This is the stalk-eyed fly, and I've never seen one in a nature show before. This is what characterizes Life: a continual parade of amazing photography and rare and beautiful sights, many of which have never been filmed before. It is also about the industriousness of animals and what they must do to ensure the survival of their young. The mudskipper, for example, is an extraordinary amphibious fish that digs a U-shaped tunnel to hatch its eggs. It gulps in air and brings it back to the eggs until they hatch, repeating the task thousands of times a day.

Each episode is devoted into a particular subject matter:

1. ""Challenges of Life""
2. ""Reptiles and Amphibians""
3. ""Mammals""
4. ""Fish""
5. ""Birds""
6. ""Insects""
7. ""Hunters and Hunted""
8. ""Creatures of the Deep""
9. ""Plants""
10. ""Primates""

There's so much to see and love here that no review can sum up the sheer joy of watching it all. ""Fish"", ""Creatures of the Deep"" and ""Plants"" are my personal favorites, but there's so much to love in every episode. Some of the subjects, however, may be a bit repetitive, especially if you've seen other BBC/nature films. For example, I've seen plenty of the ""common"", ordinary animals like cheetahs, hippos, and elephants from countless other documentaries, and they're in Life too. The lammergeier (also known as the bearded vulture) I've seen on Planet Earth. In Life, they're back and in more detail, in particular, how they drop bones onto rocks from great heights to crack them open for the nourishing marrow fat. There's also narration that makes references to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nature-s-Most-Amazing-Events-Blu-ray/dp/B001W79MQS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nature's Most Amazing Events [Blu-ray</a>].

At the end of each episode is an On Location featurette that takes you behind the scenes and shows you how some of the shots in this series were accomplished. It also shows you the great lengths that the film crew go to and all hard work that goes into bringing you these wonderful shots, as well as some of the innovative filming techniques they used. For example, one camera man hid in a hut for 28 days just to get the mating ritual of the Vogelkop bowerbird of Papua, New Guinea, a shot that is maybe 2 minutes long. In another, we see how the crew measures out a portion of English woodland and recreate the entire scene in their studio for a time-lapsed pullback shot of plants growing that took 2 years to complete.

In summary, GET THIS BLU-RAY SET!! It is fantastic, and in my opinion, every bit as good as Planet Earth, if not better. If you don't come away from this series with a new appreciation of nature's ingenuity and the wonderful and fascinating creatures that inhabit our planet, you never will.

I am sure 'Life' is excellent and worth getting but don't overpay-  if enough people hold off on getting it for the time being, maybe Amazon will lower it back to the $48.99 price for weeks before its release on 6/1.",1275609600,23,627,4.362068965517241

I saw the David Attenborough narrated version on the discovery channel a month ago and loved it, however I thought Oprah would have potential to do a good narration job. Well, lookie lookie, she instead raped it. She reads the whole thing as if she's reading a kid's storybook. ""Such creatures can NOT SURVIVE in this cold of temperatures!!!"" Ugh. Gimme a break. Stay away from this at all costs and buy the DA version. I gave up after three episodes it's that bad.

How the BBC NHU gets footage like this is beyond me, but trust me, your jaw will be dropping a lot as you watch this series.  It is not just about amazing images of wildlife and the struggle for survival though, it is also about telling a story, which with the wonderfully wise and knowledgable narration of Sir David Attenborough this series accomplishes in sparkling fashion.  I can not recommend this series enough, though it may not be suitable for young children as some of the images can be a little intense and graphic (a mostly eaten Chinstrap penguin corpse comes to mind.)

I was wondering why they didn't have the normal guy narrating the movie, he definitely does a good job, but I also didn't think Oprah did a bad job either.  In fact I think she sounds okay.  I am definitely not a fan of Oprah but I can say that the other people rating Oprah bad are just being haters. I believe that it is the same footage on either version. If you hate Oprah or think that her voice is terrible then I wouldn't recommend this version because you have already decided that you don't like it.

The cinematography in Life is just as incredible as the work done on Earth. The picture is seems like a window and it feels like I have been transported to the locations I am witnessing.
However, Oprah is speciesist, horribly horribly speciesist. Oprah says time and again that mammals are the only animals that care for each other and live in social groupings even though on other discs we see amphibians and reptiles, insects and fish exhibiting behavior that ""only mammals"" are capable of.

In all fairness to her she probably had little to do with the script and she was certainly directed as to how to read it. A few have suggested that the negative criticism of her narration is some kind of Oprah bashing. If you have seen this version you know that is simply not the case.

Although I am not a fan of Oprah, I feel I didn't hate the series simply because it was Oprah narrating it, I hated it because she does a lousy job.  This really isn't for her.  I was so disappointed watching this on TV.  I really did give it a chance, but eventually was forced to press the mute button.

No, we are not yet to that point, although we may soon arrive at that desolate crossroads if we don't start using our brains a bit more.

Attenborough has been with us nature lovers for decades (I can remember him from The Living Planet series) and he's still going strong! One can tell that this man really knows his stuff and is indeed fascinated by the material, not just as a passing whim, but a life long passion. He is a true naturalist in an age in which that is a dying profession, and his enthusiasm for the wonder and complexity of life on earth is really made apparent with his narration.

3944951,1,B002KSA4F6,"I agree completely with most of the other 1-star reviewers. However, let me emphasize that my single star is for the narration, not the photography. Like Planet Earth, the photography is breathtaking and some of the best HDTV material you will ever find.

I'm disgusted that the Discovery Channel has wasted money in re-narrating this Life series, just as they did with the Planet Earth series. And they must have wasted quite a bit of money to get Oprah Winfrey. They paid for ""one of the most influential voices of our time"", but actually got an inferior narration track for their money. And I'm not just talking about the tone of Oprah's voice or the odd rhythm of her sentences. The narration is Americanized and ""dumbed down"" so that as some reviewers noted, it seems like it is aimed at children. The children they are targeting would be much better off listening to Attenborough and stretching their vocabulary a bit. Actually, about the only slightly unfamiliar terms in the British version are those of the metric system, which is part of the language of science; all of us Americans would do well to finally become familiar with metric terms, and if you want to be a scientist or understand science, you must.

I also agree with others that the Discovery Channel's re-narration is an insult to Sir Attenborough who personifies this genre. It is difficult to put my finger on exactly what is so good about his narration, but it adds another dimension to the experience, while Oprah's distracts. And there is also the matter of the authenticity of the narrator: compare Sir Attenborough's 50+ years of experience as a naturalist to Oprah's shameless promotion of the paranormal, psychics, spiritualism, quack celebrity diets, past life regression and the poppycock of ""The Secret"".

I must say that while the photography of this new Life series is wonderful, I do prefer the organization and flow of the Planet Earth series. Furthermore, the Life series relies too much on slow motion photography; many scenes are shot ONLY in slow motion, so the viewer really has no idea what the behavior looks like in real time. In many cases it would be better to show a real-time sequence followed by a slow motion one in order to fully appreciate what the slo-mo shot reveals.

 Still, I can't get enough of this type of material and have not been able to resist WATCHING it on the Discovery Channel. I suggest you do what I'm doing: turn down Oprah, put on ""Dark Side of the Moon"", and enjoy the Life visuals now. Then, watch it all again when the BBC version is released; it won't hurt you a bit to watch this stuff twice. If you don't get the Discovery Channel, by all means wait and purchase the BBC blu-ray version.",1271894400,10,2718,4.713684210526316

3944954,1,B002KSA4F6,"The ""Life"" special is fantastic, and it's so good that I recommend you run out and get a copy now- a proper copy, narrated by Sir David Attenborough. Not this Oprah-narrated atrocity.

Simply put, the international and aired version of the ""Life"" special is narrated by a man who's dedicated his life to wildlife and conservation. Attenborough is a seasoned veteran in the field, whose years of experience and worldwide known calm voice lend to some of the most amazing narratives that pair with amazing visuals to create perfect viewing experiences.

This version, however, is narrated by Oprah. Instead of insightful comments from someone's who's been in the field and participated in the project, you get random comments that have nothing to do with the project from someone who has very little idea what's going on. The script seems like it was written for children, or illiterate adults who can't watch these beautiful images without someone yelling ""OH NO!"" to keep them awake.

The visuals are still beautiful, but buying and watching this version is saying that you have no problem being told that you are stupid. Marketing execs decided you were too dumb to understand a British accent, and that having Oprah's name on this would sell more copies than having the name of the man most associated with these projects worldwide. Stand up, demand the Attenborough version, and in the process demand that the movie industry treat you as an intelligent being.",1271894400,14,1462,4.983606557377049
3944955,1,B002KSA4F6,"Maybe this is a preview or an opinion as it hasn't been released yet, and people have already talked about Oprah's narration. But another and just as important point to me - look at the running time. Then look at the Attenborough version. 440 minutes versus 550?

I know which one I'll be getting. I felt ripped off last time - on the American Planet Earth release we did get Attenborough, but got 4 discs instead of 5 on the U.K. version. I knew there was no chance at a refund, but I bought the U.K. one as well anyway when I found out after waiting for a special. Thankfully this time around I won't be caught out.

I don't understand why now that everything's digital and there's no PAL and NTSC any more or different resolutions, why we can't just have the same releases throughout the different territories. And when Americans have no problem with many of the latest blockbusters having an ostensibly all - English (or at least British sounding accents - the Pirates movies, Lord of the Rings, Narnia, Harry Potter and so on) cast why we have this patronising stuff. Back to the days of Mad Max 2/Road Warrior and dubbing Mel Gibson eh?! Different masters can be good though to show us when things break down. I was bitterly disappointed in the Good the Bad and the Ugly quality, especially after seeing how amazing the European version is. And I'm still cranky about no refund on the appalling first release of Gangs of New York on Blu.

The stunning visuals are stiffled by the queen of daytime's insufferable voice over, which sounds more appropriate for a copororate video on company sexual harrassment policy, or a supermarket's instructions on how employees should lift heavy boxes without injuring their backs. Winfery predicatbly elongates vowel sounds so that the fox's ""long""journey home becomes the foxes ""lo-o-o-ng"" journey home, reducing what could have truly been a television event to a predictably tame, star driven, and, I hate to say it, dull wildlife program.

I will wait for the BBC version with David Attenborough as Narrator.

I think they are just choosing someone that Americans are familiar with.

With that said, I loved the Sigourney Weaver version of Planet Earth! In fact, I exchanged my BBC David Attenborough version for the Discovery Sigourney Weaver version. Why?

Not even a dull narration can take away from the amazing footage in this series, and I don't feel it's a waste of my time to watch it on my DVR. It is still interesting, and I don't think Oprah takes away from the fascinating scenes that are unfolding on the screen. Personally, I think the footage is so amazing that nothing can really detract TOO much from it. However, having said that, she definitely comes across as being slightly bored with her subject matter, which makes it slightly boring for people to listen to, especially in contrast with Sigourney Weaver's version of Planet Earth, which I thought was quite excellent. I won't waste my money actually BUYING this version of the series.

If you want the BEST version of any of the Discovery Channel documentaries, David Attenborough's versions definitely enhance everything he narrates and is head and shoulders above anything else, especially in this case, since they also altered the narration for Oprah's sake. I agree with all the people who said they don't understand why they feel the need to recruit an American narrator for these shows, when David Attenborough is so thoroughly beloved by American audiences as well as British. In the case of Planet Earth, it worked and was pretty wonderful with either narrator. But in the case of Life, the narration is definitely not as smart and well-done as it could be, and I would highly recommend purchasing the Attenborough version over this one. I'm not an Oprah fan, but I believe in giving credit where it's due, and she does an adequate job here. The problem is that there is an EXCELLENT alternative for comparison, and this one doesn't hold up when stacked against it.

Just a note for those buying it from Amazon.uk: the blu-ray is recorded on 50hz (PAL) and that won't run on a US PS3 or some BD players that don't support 50Hz (instead of the standard US 60Hz NTSC).

How and why the fratboy marketing majors at Discovery Communications got the bright idea to overdub naturalist David Attenborough with Oprah baffles the mind.  Perhaps they hoped her name would bring her built-in audience.  Some have theorized they wanted to avoid alienating the creationist fringe in America by erasing naturalist Attenborough's presence.  Whatever the case, her monotone cadence is just awful, totally devoid of any emotion or care.  It's really like you're taking in two different, competing things that are clashing rather than meshing with each other - amazing videography and then an obtrusive lady babbling and you just don't care what she's saying.  It's clear she came into the recording studio, started reading from the paper in front of her and put absolutely ZERO heart into it.

I have watched both versions for comparison.  First the BBC version narrated by David Attenborough (spectacular), and then the Oprah version overdubbed and broadcast by Discovery on TV.

Funny how Discovery also does not mention the format - recall that the Discovery version of Planet Earth was only in 1080i whereas the BBC used the higher quality 1080p.  I happen to have both versions of Planet Earth and in several scenes the difference in video quality and definition is very obvious. The Discovery version also has fewer scenes than BBC due to more commercials in U.S. causing them to cut the run time although the Discovery version of Planet Earth did have more special features presumably to fill the time on Discovery HD Theatre which did not attract as many advertisers.

I was unable to listen to Oprah's readings during the first episode.  I decided to buy the original series from amazon.co.uk instead to watch in my region free player.

I guess I understand the theory. Maybe putting Oprah's voice on it will make the lonely lower class housewives watch it and learn a little bit about the environment. Plus I'm sure they're getting tons of free advertising on Oprah's show. But how is Oprah qualified to talk about conservation and nature? She flies around on a private jet and wastes her money on a brand new wardrobe while she makes her fans bid on her hand-me-downs to raise money for her charity. At least Sigourney Weaver has some connection to the environment and is an intelligent college-educated woman. Oprah is just good at manipulating people. That does not make her a good nature documentary narrator. In fact, I thought she was awful and made the televised Life almost unwatchable.

So buy the David Attenborough version. They come out on the same day and are the same price but his narration is just at a far higher level than that of Oprah Winfrey.",1270252800,5,1198,4.839024390243902

If they are trying to attract more black people into these ""Earth"" shows and they think it has to be narrated by a black person, WHY Oprah? We know if Oprah was outside and saw a bug, she would start screaming and drop her wig while flailing her arms running in circles.

Why could they not get Morgan Freeman or the great James Earl Jones to narrate Life?? Sigourney did the Planet Earth and she did a very good job but not as good as Attenborough-the version I purchased. At least Sigourney Weaver has become an activist and honorary chair of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International and fights for animal rights.

I cannot in any way, understand how anyone thought Oprah's persona and voice fits this type of series. (Did they hire someone from NBC to make that decision?) I see that Attenborough narrated a British version. Maybe I can find Attenborough's Life version here in the states. I will not buy ""Life"" with Oprah's narration, even for 1$.  If I cannot get Attenborough's version, then they can keep it. Hey. that's Life..

While there is a general idea (at least among American anti-intellectuals) that scientists are boring, uptight, fuddy-duddies, the truth is that the well-educated  populizers of science, such as Attenborough, still hold a very dear place in the hearts of a very large group of people in America who have not yet gone bat guano crazy.  The reason why a man like Sir David Attenborough is so well esteemed among enthusiasts of nature documentary, whereas Oprah Winfrey is not, is because when one devotes their entire life to the understanding of a certain topic they are able to bring a wonder-filled enthusiasm, backed by a substantial knowledge, to that topic.  Most of us are not looking for a ""Wow...Look...nature is cool!"" sort of commentary.  We already understand that.  We wish for someone to fill us with the wonder of understanding.  The only thing that separates humankind from the animals in these documentaries is that we are truly *thinking* about them.

I could not wait for the June 1 release in the USA, so I bought from Amazon.co.uk. I am very satisfied with this purchase, especially that the British pound has dropped in value so much that it even cost less than if I ordered from Amazon.com.

Perhaps Amazon could confirm to all its customers about the Region code of the UK set.

BTW, people who love BBC nature documentaries would love the UK Attenborough set. Diehard Oprah fans who love her in ANY kind of program may wish to wait for the June release.

Even Sigourney Weaver's narration for Planet Earth was MUCH better than Oprah Winfrey's for Life. Weaver had a way of bringing gravity to situations, and her voice at least sounded smooth, and good; very complementary. Oprah's voice is slightly scratchy, abrasive, and she sort of sounds like a frustrated nun. Off of that, the way she speaks to you sounds like she's talking down to you; like a self-absorbed kindergarten teacher, who can't wait for the day to end. She doesn't even seem to have any passion or insight. I cannot stress enough how terrible her narrative for this show is. I was physiologically incapable of sitting through an hour of her grinding drivel.

Oprah should really stick to daytime TV and as a women's talk show host. I like what she does, as far as charity (although not so much how she publicizes it), etc. (?), but she has got to be such a money hog. Just because she was a helping hand for Planet Earth doesn't mean she should showboat all of its sequels.

In short, if you're thinking about purchasing the series, you should absolutely buy the blu ray version. It looks and sounds at least as good as Planet Earth (in blu ray). The picture is most of the times crystal clear, very detailed and rich in all the colours of the natural world. It is basically demo material to show off your HDTV to your disgruntled and jealous parents (in my case). Furthermore, I was also pleasantly surprised by the sound: it is very clear, and it sounds like you are within inches of the events displayed on your screen even when it is about miniature animals such as frogs of 1 cm or something.

After every episode, there is a short making of about the crew and how they did some of the shots in the episode you just witnessed and some more insights about the animals.

I also recommend to get the version of the BBC that is narrated by David Attenborough.

Oprah sounds like she's giving a lecture to 6 year olds (my mom teaches kindergarten, so I should know).",1269475200,17,271,4.510204081632653
3945036,5,B002KSA4F6,"I had watched the original British airing of this, and it simply takes my breath away. Planet Earth was, to me, a revolutionary documentary experience, and Life brings it up a notch. It astounds me how some of the images are able to be caught on film in such a masterful way, it almost seems as if they train the animals for the camera with how well it's captured. It is simply awe-inspiring.

I cannot wait to see how much more beautiful it looks in pristine High Definition.

One thing has me confused - why is Amazon showing the runtime as 144 minutes? These are ten 50 minute episodes, each with a 10 minute ""behind the scenes"" extra. So it should be around 600 minutes...",1269475200,6,676,4.4
3945037,1,B002KSA4F6,"OK, I am a Brit (English) currently living in the USA, and do not get me wrong by what I say in the following review, it is my choice and I love it - or so my wife tells me. She hails from MD and lived in the UK for a number of years. If I had even suggested to her that I buy the Sigourney Weaver narrated version of Planet Earth, I would have been severely beaten around the head. Whilst she does have issues with Ms. Weaver (something to do with a previous male friend having some form of fascination for white female underwear (Alien) - I see no problem with that) but her belief is that the definitive version is narrated by David Attenborough. I am also in full agreement with that view - David Attenborough, as has been quoted by many previous viewers, is the definitive voice of natural history.

Having said all that, I have not yet seen ""Life"" and of course when I do I will be watching it on Blu-ray, narrated by David Attenborough, there is no question about it. Many TV programmes from the UK have made it across ""the pond"" and have been extremely successful in their original form as well as the version modified for the US market - take ""The Office"" as an example. However, for the BBC Natural History series, who actually needs/wants a US English version? No doubt time will tell if the actual sales figures are made available.

However, once Oprah started talking you could tell she was reading off a script. Her voice sounded so monotone that within 20 mins I actually fell asleep. The visuals were stunning but I could not stay awake through her narration, it was like a sleeping pill. I'll be picking up Attenborough's version and hopefully it'll be more exciting.",1269302400,90,454,4.7594936708860756
3945042,5,B002KSA4F6,"Even though many reviewers are giving this product negative review because of Oprah's narration, I think that it is time that someone wrote an honest review about the product.  After watching the first two episodes last night, I must say that this series is simply AMAZING!  The footage was entertaining and educational at the same time.  This is the same reason that Planet Earth has been so successful as well.  When I show the Planet Earth series in the class the kids actually cannot wait to watch it.  They always ask when we are watching it again.  Like Planet Earth, Life tells a great story in every episode and we get to see things that often times we have never seen before.

All those complaining about Oprah being the narrator are missing something.  When my students are watching a series like this, a narrator they can identify with helps them relate to the subject matter even more.  You should see the kids when they realize that the narrator from Planet Earth is from Avatar.  They make the connection, and they can relate to the narrator.  David Attenborough may have more a ""scientific"" background than Oprah Winfrey, but my students and many other non-science folk cannot relate to him.  If he were the narrator of this series on Discovery, many might quickly view this as ""too scientific"" and move on.  If you don't like her narration, buy the other version.  I'm buying this version to show my students because her voice makes this interesting educational series even more appealing to them.

If you like a great story with great characters, then you need to check out this series.  Words cannot describe how awesome it was to see a ""Jesus Christ Lizard"" running across the water, monkeys using rocks as tools, a toad that tenses up its muscles to become ""pebble-like"" and roll down a mountain to get away from a predator, or three cheetahs working together to take down an ostrich!  Another fantastic series from BBC and Discovery!!",1269216000,22,1955,4.753709198813056
3945043,1,B002KSA4F6,"After having viewed most of the UK version and the first two episodes of this documentary on Discovery, I agree
with the negative reviews this is getting. To summarize, here's the pros and cons of the US version:

Cons:
- The script was re-written for the US. The narration sounds like it's directed toward an 8 year old instead of a
  general audience. At times it feels like you're being talked down to.
- You can tell Oprah is reading instead of narrating; she sounds like she's telling a bed time story.
- Oprah mispronounces several times fairly common words and sometimes drops her voice tone too quickly at the end
  of her sentences. Can get a bit annoying.
- The editing is all over the place. It does not flow as well as the original as some segments are shown before
  others so continuity is broken.
- The commercial breaks are placed in really bad spots during the broadcast. Kills the excitement for the next
  segment.

Pros:
- It's finally available for viewing in the US for all those waiting for this series. (The mute button works
  wonders)
- Makes you appreciate even more the great job Sir David Attenborough did narrating this excellent series in the
  UK broadcast of this show.

By the way, you may see the UK version already available for purchase on Amazon.uk. Please do not commit the same
mistake I did and purchase that version for a US PS3 blu-ray player. Although the discs are region-free, the
content is encoded with a mixture of 50Hz and 60Hz signals. So although the US PS3 can view 60Hz content fine,
it just shows a black screen on the 50Hz content. Unfortunately the main menu and the credits at the end of each
chapter are encoded in 50Hz so the PS3 would just go to a black screen and stay there (it can't skip it). Hence I
could not get past the main menu. Other US blu-ray players are able to play/bypass 50Hz signals, but the US PS3
cannot. So now I patiently wait for the US version of the UK broadcast...",1269216000,27,1950,4.453521126760563

I know it's clich&eacute; to say that a wildlife documentary shows you nature like you've never seen it before, but with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Life/dp/B002UXRGM0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Life</a>&nbsp;I actually think it's true.

At some points, I literally couldn't believe my eyes. I found myself rewinding every once in a while just to make sure I wasn't hallucinating. For example, in the first episode, there is a scene with a Malaysian fly emerging from its pupa. That was pretty cool, but I admit I was kind of wondering whether this little insect deserved its 5-minutes of fame. What happened next shows that it did. Right in front of the camera, the little bug extended its eyestalks, blowing them up like a balloon, until they stretched ridiculously far from his body!

Each episode focuses on a different class of animals. Here is the list of episodes:

1) ""Challenges of Life""
2) ""Reptiles and Amphibians""
3) ""Mammals""
4) ""Fish""
5) ""Birds""
6) ""Insects""
7) ""Hunters and Hunted""
8) ""Creatures of the Deep""

The video and soundtrack music were both fantastic but the narration by Oprah Winfrey was surprisingly juvenile.  I did not appreciate being talked down to and given blatant mispronunciations.  Apparently, DISCOVERY missed the target with her narration.  They can learn much from the BBC version with David Attenborough (that's the version I will be ordering).  This isn't a problem for Amazon since they will be selling both versions and will profit either way.  The fault lies with DISCOVERY...and I watch everything on DISCOVERY.  No other well-known series attempts to talk down to its audience...example:  Mike Rowe from ""Dirty Jobs"" is always intelligent and informative.  DISCOVERY forgot that we are smarter than they think we are. They tried the same ""stuff"" with the Weaver version of ""Planet Earth""...she did an adequate job and was not insulting as Oprah is but most people I know, including myself, purchased the Attenborough version.

I couldn't quite put my finger on why it was so off-putting until I read some of the other reviews here on amazon, and they're right, it's because she sounds like a kindergarten teacher when she narrates. Its way too simplified and made me feel like an idiot while I was watching it (I rolled my eyes many times).

I don't understand why she's even narrating this in the first place, David Attenborough already did. Why attempt to replace the irreplaceable? It's odd that they left his narration on the Discovery Channel original broadcast of Blue Planet, (which was immensely successful) but then replaced him with Weaver for Planet Earth.

He's been narrating nature documentaries for decades now, and he's not getting any younger. Discovery should be ecstatic that the legendary David Attenborough is still alive and well and willing to work, not replace him with a talk show host. It's disgraceful, and when you can buy the original Attenborough narrated version right here on amazon, I see no reason to buy this inferior (putting it very mildly) product.",1269216000,17,1223,4.875

I didn't learn anything new with Oprah narrating - she lacks the passion and knowledge of David Attenborough.

I will definitely be going with the David Attenborough version of the series - from the few clips I've seen, it appears to be an entirely different show. The footage is basically the same, but there are HUGE differences in editing that really impact the way the story is told. And Attenborough has a gift for bringing excitement and life into whatever he is narrating.

Whenever Planet Earth was rerun on the Discovery Channel or HD Theater, I always enjoyed watching (even though I owned the blu rays). I personally thought Sigourney Weaver was decent. She was no David Attenborough, but at the same time, she didn't bug me. Not so with OW.

Simply put, Oprah is an awful narrator. There's something about her that's just, well, condescending. You'd have to watch the series on Discovery (and I don't recommend that), to see what I'm talking about. The best way to describe it is that this seems like it was narrated for a PBS documentary... aimed at kids. I mean really. The inflections in her voice sound like she's talking down to a five year old. It's so bad that after the 90 minutes I've given I refuse to watch again. I'm waiting for the BBC blu rays.

As for Life itself, it lives up to the hype and I think the camera work is just as amazing as with Planet Earth. It's definitely a buy, but just not the OW version.",1269129600,27,1254,4.41991341991342

Next, she pronounced ""ecosystem"" as ""echo"" system - again, it hit the ear as just really WRONG.  Would take Signorney Weaver over Oprah any time.  Signorney did a much better narration for Planet Earth.  Oprah's voice lacks depth and character, and often she drops her voice so you can't hear what she's saying.  She's not clear and crisp.

First Harry Potter and now this. What a shameful way to undermine language for the sake of a couple of bucks?

I have various BBC Documentaries - I LOVE them, and despite the fact that I am not British I understand everything, and David Attenborough's voice in much more credible, isn't this what he does professionally?

Oprah would probably be more suitable for bedtime story recordings for sleepy youngsters.

David Attenborough is an excellent narrator.  I'm not sure what the deal is with releasing other versions (with different narrators).

Now they are even going a step further and airing the Oprah version on launch, at least with Planet Earth they aired the David Attenborough version first.

A lot of people that liked Planet Earth mistakenly ordered the DVDs with Sigourney...so this is just a warning to make sure you check which version you are ordering and be sure you are getting the one you want.

Let them know you want quality narration and vote with your $$$.

Update: Tried to watch the first two eps on TV and it was horrid.  At least Sigourney wasn't terrible (she just wasn't as good as David Attenborough). Oprah = FAIL or to put it another way ""a big bag of hurt"".",1269043200,101,988,4.605714285714286

I saw Oprah's show where she said that after seeing the series, she ""asked"" Discovery if she could narrate their version.

Firstly, the fact that they even chose to take David Attenborough's narration out is insulting to one of the greatest naturalists ever. The fact that they could possibly imagine eliminating the man that basically MADE this genre of documentaries is just plain stupid and offensive and undermines Mr. Attenborough's lifelong work, which is especially terrible! Secondly, it makes us Americans look like simpletons who just want big hollywood names (that have nothing to do with anything relevant to this!) possibly in an effort to make us feel special or something!? Another possibility is that perhaps the marketing experts feel Americans are too stupid to understand British English or would be as closed minded to not purchase it because it is not good old ""American"". This is absolutely stupid. Everyone PLEASE just heed these warnings and buy the Attenborough versions also available and make the sales figures for the ""American"" version so miserable that Discovery finally gets the idea that we are tired of this crap!",1268956800,146,1172,5.306451612903226

Both contain loads of never-before-seen sequences and amazing photography and music and are organized along the same lines.  We felt that in our networked world, there was no point in our trying to pick a single version for this marketplace.

Why does this have to be one of those things where it is just here in the U.S. that we can't let something be good and leave it at that?  Oprah is good at making my mom cry doing shows that are the TV equivalent of People magazine updates (well, mostly), and balancing out with useful outreach fundraisers, etc.  BBC does it right.

He also happens to be a brilliant speaker who actually understands what he's talking about, having written dozens of book on the subjects about which he speaks when he narrates films such as Planet Earth, Blue Planet, and Life.  Discovery decided to redub Planet Earth with Sigourney Weaver and now is embarking upon similar folly by having Oprah butcher Life.  I won't watch it on Discovery and I won't buy this junk DVD.  I'll be waiting until I can get the real version, just like I did with Planet Earth.  I can't understand this desire to unnecessarily replace the great with the awful.

Why in the hell American producers thought... let's take out the narration track of a veteran and much more respected personality, like David Attenborough and replace it with Oprah, goes way beyond stupidity!  If they needed someone to replace David, there is a catalog of people who have the voice for this sort of work...

James Earl Jones
Morgan Freeman
Patrick Stewart
Leonard Nemoy
Anthony Head
Majel Barrett
and even President Obama

Though, my choices, are mostly men, I personally feel, men fit this profile better.  There are many many talented female voices out there, and I'm sure I am just forgetting them, at the moment.  But, my point is, there were much better and certainly more qualified candidates for this gig than Oprah!

Seriously people, although the cover for the Oprah version is more colourful and attractive... the content it is the same with Attenboroghs.  So, do yourself a favor, buy the ORIGINAL Attenborough version.  He is the same voice you are very familiar with from Planet Eart and Blue Planet.

American producers basically wasted their money by changing the narration to Oprah from someone alot more qualified and certainly more pleasant to listen to speak!

Oh and if you don't want to wait for America to show you the Oprah-fied version and then for the release in June... goto Amazon.co.uk and buy the PAL version!  Then go out and buy a 29.99 cheap DVD player from Target or Walmart, search Google for your model number and the word ""region free crack"" or something thereof, and you have yourself an international DVD player without having to pay the price for one.  Then you don't have to wait on America to get the programs you wanted last year!!!  That's what I do!  And the picture quality is always better, in my opinion, on the PAL discs!  I stopped buying American DVD's a while ago.  Even with the exchange rate as it is... you will still pay far less than getting it when Amazon.com gets it!",1268438400,32,2170,4.850543478260869

The cinematography is exhilarating - extraordinary close-ups, gliding aerial/panoramic shots, slow motion photography, underwater sequences and some occasional time-lapse photography. British naturalist and broadcaster David Attenborough brings his gentle authority and understated wit to the narration. The music score complements the visual scenes; it is never intrusive, and it allows for a balance between music and natural sounds.

The programme's creative input and production values are unmistakably those of the BBC Natural History Unit - it is both entertaining and educational. 'Life' is more focused/structured than 'Planet Earth', and its presentation adopts a more sober approach to the subject matter (but this is not a criticism). It was 4 years in the making, and was shot using high definition technology throughout. There are 10 episodes each an hour long including, at the end, a 10 to 15 minute 'on location' review which draws attention the various challenges presented to the film crews, researchers and producers - and although there is some duplication of scenes already presented in the main body of the episode, they are given a different slant. Menu options provide for episode selection plus 6 scene selections from each episode.

There are innumerable sequences which will enthral the viewer - some never captured on film before; below I give just a few examples (one from each episode) to convey an idea of what is in store :

Disc 1 : Challenges of Life, Reptiles & Amphibians, Mammals

The courtship dance of grebes (Oregon); A pair of Komodo dragons fighting  (Indonesia); A clan of hyenas forcing a pride of lions to retreat from feeding on their prey (East Africa).

Disc 2 : Fish, Birds

The interaction of barbel fish and hippos (Kenya); Lammergeiers exploiting thermal air currents (Ethiopia).

Disc 3 : Insects, Hunters and Hunters

Male Dawson bees fighting to the death (Australia); Bottlenose dolphins working as a team to corral fish (Florida Bay).

Disc 4 : Creatures of the Deep, Plants, Primates

Giant Australian cuttlefish mating; Bristlecone pines (the oldest living thing on Earth)/bamboo (the fastest growing plant on Earth) - both featuring time-lapse photography; The social pecking order of Macaque monkeys relaxing in the warmth of a thermal spa (Japan).

'Life' is a top drawer natural history documentary from the BBC, and one which should not be overlooked - there is little with which I could find fault.",1267920000,7,2616,5.384803921568627
