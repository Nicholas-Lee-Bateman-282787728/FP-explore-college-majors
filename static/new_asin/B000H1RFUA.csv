8135940,5,B000H1RFUA,"Beautifully animated, with some of the most striking designs I've seen in fifty years of anime. Really beautiful musical score. Some fairly sophisticated kinks in the story along with the normal simplistic and lightweight material make it a decently rounded piece of work with seeing several times. The physics is handled very well for an anime, and is no more bizarre and counterintuitive than a careful read of quantum mechanics, so just sit back and enjoy.",1480982400,,459,5.052631578947368

8135944,4,B000H1RFUA,"I have the whole series, but so far I've just seen this first disc.  It's pretty good so far.

The normal story: Haruka is the 12-year-old daughter of a divorcee who writes manga nobody buys.  Her best friend is Yuu, son of a divorcee who is pushing him to study for cram school so he can get into a school in Tokyo.  The pressure is getting to him, he thinks he's going crazy.  Haruka and her friends Ai and Miho chatter over which boys they like (Haruka insists she's ""just friends"" with Yuu, but both sporty Ai and nerdy/spacy Miho want him.  Or, if not him, this other dude.)  The kids think they are seeing ghosts, but these ghosts are actually

The cool story: Black-cloaked beings from the alternate world of La'cryma enter our world seeking the Dragon Torque, who just happens to be Haruka.  These guys fight amongst themselves (with many pyrotechnics and mutations) over whether they should bring Haruka back to their world, or just kill her.

Since so much time is spent on the ""normal"" story, it's taking time for the ""cool"" story to develop.  Ratings wise, I guess the violence puts at at PG-13.  (Haruka is shown in a bath-tub a couple of times.  Don't worry, you don't see anything.  I don't understand why anime does things like this.  Call me a prudish American if you want, but I just don't get it.)",1367625600,,1316,4.493670886075949
8135945,5,B000H1RFUA,"In the future a war is raging between inhabitants of alternate dimensions. Haruka and Yuu are middle school friends. The war spills over into their dimension. Soldiers tell Haruka that she has the power to end the war. The soldier that tells her this is the future version of Yuu. Dimensions are crossed and alternate versions of the characters are encountered. Can these children avoid their tragic future and change their destiny. Or will they be victims of a tragic fate.

My god this anime is good. The animation is great, the soundtrack is cool, and the characters are very compelling. Noein has a very complicated plot. Sometimes it's a little heavy, but it's great and brilliantly written. There may be a few plot holes, but it's kinda hard to pinpoint because of the story's complexity. This anime also has a lot of good drama in it. The drama keeps you interested and gives you a reprieve from the heavy and complex story.

Don't be intimidated by all the physics and theoretical supposition in this anime. Just enjoy the beautifully crafted love story. I definitely recommend Noein to any anime fan. It's amazing and a steal for the price.",1354752000,,1149,4.768844221105527
8135946,4,B000H1RFUA,"Anime has just about anything you can imagine -- and then some -- but elementary schoolers tackling quantum physics and a forthcoming apocalypse?

Surprisingly, it works. In fact, ""Noein"" succeeds in having both the kiddie storylines and the eerie other-dimensiony stuff, without seeming contrived. And the first five episodes are mostly about foreshadowing and setup, but they do that pretty brilliantly.

It opens with a strange ship blasting a city to rubble, and two strange black-cloaked men attacking the ship. One of them, Karasu, blows up the ship and vanishes. In modern Japan, Haruka looks up at a church spire to see Karasu staring at her.

Several months later, Haruka agrees to go with her friends -- including the troubled Yuu -- on a ghost hunt. But the ghost hunt goes awry when two strange men -- Karasu and the nutty Atori -- appear in the graveyard and duke it out, after identifying Haruka as the ""Dragon Torc,"" who has the power to bend space and time. Soon the town is swarming with cloaked Dragon Knights from another dimension, along with some suspicious quantum scientists.

The psychotic Atori catches up to Yuu and Haruka on a mountaintop observatory, with Karasu just behind to rescue them. But then the Dragon Knights are attacked themseles, by a strange masked energy being named Noein. The Knights are growing increasingly desperate to capture Haruka, but Karasu -- whose past is linked to hers -- is  hell-bent on protecting her, even to the point of attacking his own fellow knights... and whisking Haruka into his own world.

""Noein"" is pretty dense on plot -- the first five episodes introduce the villain, heroes, future sorrows, rivalries, quantum physicists, and the kids in the middle of it all. There's plenty more to come -- lots of flashbacks, hints and foreshadowing indicate that the storyline is going to get even more complex in future.

And the writers do a pretty brilliant job interweaving all of this, revealing enough to let you draw your own conclusions rather than just TELLING viewers what is going on. And despite the dark, angsty storyline, they sprinkle it with moments of comedy like Isami babbling that a ghost is ""impossible!"", or Miho wearing the ""aura glasses.""

It also balances out action and potential romance (they are only twelve, after all) well. One episode will be concerned with Ai's hidden crush on Isami, and how it leads to a slapfight with Haruka. But it's set right right after a kinetic battle between Atori and Karasu, involving a falling lift car, giant electrical blasts, and some holes in the universe. Nice.

The main stumbling block is the animation, which isn't so much BAD as inconsistent. The creators spun up some beautiful CGI for the Dragon Torc, spaceships and so on, but the hand-drawn characters are incredibly simple-looking. And in the first few episodes, the animators seemed to be having a little trouble figuring out exactly how certain people should look -- see Atori's teeny-weeny feet and legs.

Most of the characters are given little moments to shine, but the main trio takes center stage. Haruka and Yuu make great preteen protagonists: one is upbeat and kindly, and the other is miserable because his mother's obsessions are wrecking his life. And Karasu is an absolutely stunning, angsty anti-hero, whose dark personality is even more striking when you realize that he's a future version of Yuu.

As for the dub, almost all the actors are excellent, and Crispin Freeman is nothing short of phenomenal as the tortured Karasu -- rough, anguished, and sometimes a wee bit tender. The only weak spots, really, are a hammy Bryce Papenbrook and Cindy Robinson with a Southern accent so strong you could smash cinder blocks with it.

The first volume of ""Noein"" hits a few stumbling blocks -- mainly animated -- but introduces a deliciously complex plot and realistic characters. And that's only the first five episodes of the series.",1185062400,9,3932,4.949924127465858
8135947,5,B000H1RFUA,"At first, I had a second thought in whether I should watch this anime because from the cover, it did not look quite attractive to me. Luckily, I bought it and continue to watch the latest release of more volumns. This is a great story. I do not want to tell much about the story. The identities of the characters are one of myteries that every viewer wants to know. What happened in the past which can cause the so-called the destruction of their world is an attractive question too.",1173657600,3,483,4.377777777777778
8135948,5,B000H1RFUA,"The series has superb animation with an impressive score plus it doesn't dumb down the complex sci-fi story.  Like FLCL or Paranoia Agent, this anime strikes a balance between intense fighting and character development all the while assuming the viewer doesn't need to be spoon-fed the plot. I like Bleach & Naruto but they tend to follow the DBZ meets Inuyasha formula where battles last 4-5 episodes.  Fans of ShojoBeat and ROD will enjoy as well.",1161043200,19,449,4.894736842105263
