8652596,4,B00JOE7FUG,"Made and directed by Danis Tanovic who brought us `No Mans Land' and `Triage' starring Colin Farrell , this is a semi documentary type tale of the plight of one family. Nazif is a scrap metal seller, he scratches an existence by breaking up old cars and anything to sell the base metal for a few Marks. He has to use very basic tools too and this was filmed during what looked like a very nasty winter.

His wife, Senada, keeps house making his meagre earnings stretch as far as possible to feed them and their two daughters. She is also pregnant and then gets taken ill. Once at the hospital it becomes obvious that they have no health insurance and so are turned away. She is in great danger and so Nazif begins his efforts to get her the treatment.

This was filmed on a very small budget and apparently the people in the film (not real actors) are re- enacting what happened to them - this makes the whole thing even more poignant. They are Roma and only they can understand how and why they are treated so badly. This won The Grand Jury Prize at the Berlin Film Festival and Nazif was awarded the Silver Bear. So this has already had an impact.

I was moved by this and you would be made of stone not to be. It will not appeal to everyone as the story and style is docudrama and at times very little appears to be happening and that is because it doesn't in real life - you are made to wait ages etc. The language is Bosnian and Romany and the sub titles are all good - it runs to around 74 minutes. Tanovic has made a film with a strong message loaded with social comment and I hope it gets a much wider audience.",1446249600,,1619,4.1826923076923075
