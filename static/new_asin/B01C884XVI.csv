7673264,3,B01C884XVI,"Well although the movie appeared grainy in the beginning I got over it and got into the story. Calvin Lockhart can do no wrong with me. The movie clarity again was grainy- but I enjoyed watching and glad I got it from a suggestion from a person connected with the movie.-Thanks to ""Alvin Jones""",1241740800,5,294,4.462962962962963
7673265,2,B01C884XVI,"This movie has a fictional character portraying real life radio icon Frankie Crocker. For those of you who didn't live in NYC in thee late 60's and 70's Frankie Crocker owned NY radio and put WABC Music radio 77 out of business and spawned thee growth of FM radio. Frankie was all that Frankie Parker in the movie wasn't, smooth, hip, smart with a great voice, and always well dressed. In the movie Calvin Lockhart attempts to capture the essence that was the Cheif Rocker (Frankie Crocker) and falls way, way short. His portrayal was too frenetic, and lacked real hipness and sort of did a disservice to the real Frankie. Lockhart does resemble Crocker somewhat but that was as close as this movie comes to anything. As I watched this movie it reminded me of by Robert Townsend depicting formally trained actors trying to portray tough guys, some of the lines Lockhart delivers were LoL. Lockhart was much better later on in his career (see Uptown Saturday Nite).  This movie would have been better served delving more into the radio business and the influence stars like Frani=kie, Jocko and Hal Jackson had on the black communitty at the time. If it wasn't for Melinda played by Vonetta McGeee who was our beauty of that time and Rosiland Cash who was the quintessential actress who once again put it down this move would be unbearable to watch. Unfortunately this gets labled Blaxploitation because of the fake tough guy acts from the white syndicate dudes to the football player, non of the so called tough guys in this movie are believeable, and isn't what these movies where supposed to be about? Anyway if you are a fan of Rosiland Cash or Vonetta McGee get this movie",1215043200,11,1676,4.68135593220339
7673266,4,B01C884XVI,"WHEN I FIRST SAW THIS MOVIE, I WAS AMAZED ABOUT IT. I CAN TELL IT WAS NOT DIGITALLY REMASTERED OR NOTHING LIKE THAT, BUT IT IS A VERY GOOD MOVIE.THE LATE CALVIN LOCKHART & THE LATE ROSALIND CASH WERE VERY GREAT ACTORS AS WELL  AS THE OTHER CAST MEMBERS. IF YOUR INTO 70'S MOVIES, ADD THIS ONE TO YOUR COLLECTION.",1195689600,11,312,4.2
7673267,3,B01C884XVI,"I SAW THIS FILM IN THE 70'S WHEN IT WAS FIRST RELEASED I WAS DYING TO SEE IT AGAIN, FILM QUALITY WAS CHOPPY AT BEST, IT SEEMED LIKE A COPY OF A COPY, IT WAS GREAT TO SEE THE LATE CALVIN LOCKHART IN A STARRING ROLE AGAIN, BUT THE STORY LINE WAS RETARDED. STILL I AM GLAD TO FIND A COPY OF THIS FILM AS IT IS RARE, SO I AM GLAD I ORDERED IT, A MUST FOR COLLECTORS OF THE GENRE. I GAVE IT 3 STARS MOSTLY FOR THE RARENESS OF THE PEICE",1195257600,2,430,3.5851063829787235

7673272,5,B01C884XVI,Classic! I had a copy before and it was not a good copy re quality. This is much better. Thanx Warner Bros.,1458777600,2,107,3.909090909090909
7673273,5,B01C884XVI,"First of all, this is a pre release review, because I haven't seen the dvd yet. However, seeing as how most of the movies Warner has been releasing over the last 2 years through their Warner Archive Collection have had great picture quality(as opposed to most of their releases from years earlier which had mediocre to bad picture quality) I'm sure the picture on this release will look fabulous! As for the movie itself, this flick has been at the very top of my most wanted dvd list almost since the first time dvds came out. Behind Shaft and Superfly, this was my 3rd favorite blaxploitation movie of all time. For quite some time I never thought it would see an official dvd release (A bootleg copy was released and quickly disappeared years ago) But when I found out that Warner owned virtually all of MGM's back catalouge titles, I kinda figured it would be just a matter of time before Warner finally got around to this one.  The last time I saw this movie was about 25 years ago- my local ABC network here in chicago televised a heavily edited version of the movie around 3am on a Friday night. I had managed to videotape it, but I somehow lost the tape in the course of moving a few years later. Despite the fact that it was somewhat of a failure at the box office (It only played her for a little over 3 1/2 weeks at theaters) it is in fact a very entertaining (If somewhat excessively violent) movie. The highly underrated Calvin Lockhart gives what is his most flambouyantly entertaining acting roles as an egotistical LA dj, and the doe eyed Vonetta Mcgee is simply drop dead gorgeous!!! I'm a baby boomer old school film fanatic, so as you can figure, I can't wait to get my copy in the mail. Now, it would be really nice if Warner would drop their ban on the blaxploitation horror movie ""Abby"", so that it too can see an official dvd release. And I would REALLY appreciate it if whoever owns the film rights to ""I Was A Teenage Werewolf"" & ""I Was A Teenage Frankenstein"" would allow these 2 films to be released, preferably on a double bill. Then my extensive dvd collection would be pretty much complete!",1458000000,4,2120,4.4498714652956295
7673274,5,B01C884XVI,"This is one of the best blaxploitation movies of all time. Calvin Lockhart gives a tremendous performance, and Rosalind Cash steals the movies. An underrated and forgotten classic from the past.",1457740800,,194,5.290322580645161
7673275,1,B01C884XVI,The quality of the CD was as though someone copied a poor copy. The price should have been less than five dollars.  I saw this movie when I was a pre-teen and did not remember it being so boring.  Most of the movie was so dark that I couldn't make out the characters.  Don't buy.,1313107200,,279,4.036363636363636
7673276,5,B01C884XVI,"Once again, Melinda was one of several excellent movies written,directed,and produced movies for back in the day.  Movie producers had great visions when it came to filming and I looked forward to different movies every weekend.  What I would love to see is a film festival of all the black exploitation movie written and have it shown all over the world and complalations of films in which everyone could purchase them.  I would like to help out getting this film festival started and I feel very much apart of it.  Anytakers from Hollywood?",1273536000,3,542,4.795698924731183
7673277,1,B01C884XVI,"the quality of this dvd is very very very poor, if it had not cost almost as much as the purchase of the dvd, i would have shipped it back in a flash.  this dvd should not be for sale of this quality.  thank you",1272672000,2,211,3.6666666666666665
7673278,3,B01C884XVI,This was a groovy movie to watch with someone that can understand this type of movie. I enjoyed viewing this movie because I am a fan of these actors.  I know I saw it when I was a pre-teen. My friend suggested ordering it because he has not seen it in 20-30yrs.  Even today you can learn some lessons from this movie and only you know what lessons they could be.  ENJOY!(^_^),1254441600,4,376,4.194444444444445
