8030222,5,B0002PQZ8E,Gave as a gift and was very appreciated. I don't think you can go wrong with Sesame Street!,1437609600,,91,4.111111111111111
8030223,5,B0002PQZ8E,Excellent.  I have purchased many copies over the years.  Now my daughter plays the mellow jazzy music on the English/Spanish selection screen for background music and just lets it repeat while she does another activity and must hear it to go to sleep by.,1431216000,,255,4.7727272727272725
8030224,5,B0002PQZ8E,GREAT PRODUCT AND GREAT SERVICE...MY TWO YEAR OLD SON JUST LOVES THIS. (A LITTLE ANNOYING TO ME AFTER THE 100 TH TIME),1356048000,,118,4.409090909090909
8030225,4,B0002PQZ8E,"I guess I was expecting a little more out of this DVD (lengthwise).  At any rate, it is cute and a good addition to my son's DVD collection, as we are a bilingual household.",1303776000,,173,4.088235294117647
8030226,5,B0002PQZ8E,"We had this movie on VHS when my son was little and now we have the DVD version.  It's a great movie for young children.  My daughter is only 2, so obviously we don't encourage tv watching.  And, luckily, she isn't really interested (unlike her 8 year old brother).  This is the only program that she watches.  This is by her own choice and by us not encouraging television.  She even sings along and does some of the motions.  I like that the program is quite short and has some educational value.  It also includes the Spanish version of the same program on the same DVD, which is also great.",1238112000,3,594,4.336363636363636
