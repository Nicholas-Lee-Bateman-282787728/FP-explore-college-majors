This is what true independent filmmaking is all about -- low budget, intelligent script, amazing actors (watch for Jeffrey DeMunn's cameo). Loren Paul Caplin made this film a few years ago yet he seemed to have access to today's newspapers and magazines. On the surface it's about fame & tabloid journalism, but it's really about a spiritual quest to make some sense of it all. As a bonus, there's a wonderful short by Caplin and some of his music. This guy has been around -- music, poetry, film -- and he knows how to tell us what he's seen and heard and felt.",1204070400,6,656,4.341463414634147
