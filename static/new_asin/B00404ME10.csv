4237955,5,B00404ME10,"I remember the first time I saw Orny at the Improv in Hollywood. I saw his name on the list of comics for the show and wondered if he would be any good as I'd heard about him in a documentary I'd seen a while ago that painted him as kind of bad. And what a surprise. He was effing hilarious. I'm not lying, I had that pain in my cheeks from laughing so much. His stuff is fricking genius. Totally recommend for people who can't get to see him live.",1282867200,4,448,3.934065934065934

4237959,2,B00404ME10,"Orny has some pretty funny material.  However, the presentation is repetitive and sometimes grating.  He's almost like a younger Lewis Black, only not quite as funny and not as endearing.  He should try to not be so angry and repetitive during his routine.

As another reviewer stated, this comedy special isn't nearly as funny as the overall rating and number of 5 star reviews would seem to indicate.",1356480000,6,402,4.867647058823529

across this dvd, we decided to buy it.  The dvd does not disappoint.

4237964,5,B00404ME10,"I would definitely recommend that any fans of Orny Adams buy this DVD if you haven't already. And if you've only just recently learned of Orny Adams, it is a MUST have. Very enthusiastic in portraying his jokes and pulls off a perfect deadpan look upon delivery with a hint of a smirk to keep it 'light-hearted'. I hope to see him perform live someday soon, he's such a talented comedian.",1330387200,2,388,4.47887323943662
4237974,5,B00404ME10,"Amazon Prime is such a beautiful thing...unlimited TV, movies, free books...2-day shipping...and ""Orny Adams Takes the Third""

The Third ""what"", you might ask. We discover the reference to the DVD's title about two thirds of the way through, when Orny goes off on a tangent and ""takes the Third"" in order to confuse law enforcement (instead of taking the Fifth). He is, of course, referring to the Third Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which states that the government cannot force the public to house or quarter its troops during peacetime.

I came across Orny Adams' comedy video while exploring the wonders of Amazon Prime on my Kindle Fire. I'd never heard of him before, but most of the other ""free"" stand-up comedy shows were comedians I'd either seen or heard of. I figured since it was a Free video it couldn't hurt to try it out and see if he was any good.

Boy, Howdy!!!

Yeah. I happened to watch this video late one night while the wife was sleeping beside me. I had headphones on, but apparently I snorted, chuckled, guffawed, stifled laughter, such that I woke my wife up from a sound sleep. She moved to another bedroom while I finsihed watching (in silent laughter).

Orny (Adam Orenstein) is a laugh-a-minute comedian, an hilarious story-teller who can riff on mundane topics and make them funny and interesting. He looks like a cross between Robert Downey, Jr. and Raul Julia (come to think of it, some friends of mine used to say that about me, too). Cut from the same cloth as Lewis Black, albeit a different pattern (cleaner language, more upbeat tone while ranting) - he doesn't tell one-liner jokes; he doesn't do impersonations or impressions; he doesn't insult the audience; and for the most part, his stand-up routine is relatively ""clean"" (unlike most comedians who drop the F-bomb almost as a form of breathing) and can be viewed by children ages 10 and up. Story after story come pouring out of him, and somehow he manages to tie them together like we tie shoelaces together to prank our friends.

I have watched this video probably 5 times now, and I still laugh out loud.

You gotta see this. Really!",1329782400,2,2151,4.72
4237975,2,B00404ME10,"Many of us first saw Orny in Seinfeld's Comedian documentary.  This isn't bad, it just isn't nearly as good as the many Orny fans watching it think it is. If you've got Netflix in addition to Amazon Instant Videos, you may want  to see where it falls on your recommendations there.  If it's highly recommended, have a look.  (It's nice to have additional options in instant video, but Amazon unfortunately doesn't yet provide a rating system tailored to individual tastes the way the former service does.)  Even though Orny was a little narcissistic and angry in the documentary, we really liked him none the less, and I followed his stand-up for several years afterwards.

In any case, the beauty of unlimited instant access is that, hey, if you don't like this as much as the Orny sycophants, you won't feel obligated to watch the whole thing, which we didn't.

[If you like your comedy angry, you may want to try Lewis Black, George Carlin, or Louis CK.  If you're up for something a little lighter we enjoyed Demetri Martin (particularly the charts), Steven Wright, or Steve Martin.]",1325289600,3,1087,4.775401069518717

He is a laugh-out-loud funny man with relevant topics that are right on the money. I love that he's so funny without being prolifically profane or obnoxiously offensive (well, unless you are an overeating fat kid). He's also quite fit and fine for the eyes to gaze upon. Just wish he would come to San Francisco some time soon so I can see him in person. So many comedians just aren't all that entertaining - but this one rocks.

4237978,5,B00404ME10,"I got a 30 day free Amazon Prime with my new Kindle Fire and one of the things I watched was this Orny Adams special. I could barely catch my breath! He jumped from topic to topic so seamlessly and with such pointed punchlines and commentaries - it was some of the funniest standup I've seen. And I've seen tons of it. My husband is a standup. And No, he is not Orny Adams. Orny took everyday modern life and tore it to bits! From the iPhone to modern, rubber trash cans, there is nothing I don't want to hear Orny's commentary about after watching this.",1321660800,,554,4.235849056603773
4237979,4,B00404ME10,"Orny Adams was a struggling comedian who made an appearance in the 2002 documentary ""Comedian"" that centered on Jerry Seinfeld's return to standup comedy.  At that time, Orny was hungry, poor, cocky, insecure, neurotic and just getting discovered.  His performance was promising but uneven.  In the special features of that film, he left the East Coast and became a faceless comedy writer in Los Angeles.  It is a wonderful bookend to see him reemerge as a standup comedian - but this time his performance is tighter, the pacing is impeccable, his delivery is edgy and his comfort on the stage is palpable.  At one point in his performance, he flubs one of his lines - multiple times - and laughs it off and turns it into a joke.  Physically, he looks better than he did in 2002, which should be of some comfort to those of us fearing the encroaching years.  His observations are timely on everything from fat kids to store receipts, cat food and citing the 3rd Amendment. The 3rd Amendment?  After watching this film, I actually practiced the line: ""You're infringing on my Third Amendment rights."" Don't be a nerd and google it. Just watch the video.",1320451200,,1152,4.725

It was more than funny enough, so I kept going.  His delivery is perfect.  His material is great.  His originality might get 4 out of 5, but he is truly a master of the craft.  Overall, he deserves a 5 out of 5.  The one star reviewers are probably waiters who failed to convince him to order the sea bass appetizers for his cat ""fluffy""; or spiteful pricks who own those marsupial baby slings.",1319932800,,532,4.3232323232323235

Orny is a master of delivery and timing,his humour is pure observational everyday experiences and as such as universal appeal. But its the delivery of the material is what seperates Orny Adams from the rest.

To give an example there is a anecdote about ""Onstar"", here in England we don't have that, yet I still found it mind blowingly funny due to the expert delivery and timing!

He has honed his craft and genuinely strives to be at his best. When you finish watching his special you find yourself referencing the things he talked about and still laughing about them later. He brings up topics that one may not have considered funny before, but you will now. You can throw this special on whenever you want guaranteed laughs and even after several times its very funny. Still, above all of that, if you just want a solid stand-up experience at home, you are assured that Orny Adams can deliver. The great thing about Orny Adams is that while youll enjoy his comedy thoroughly, you'll find yourself enjoying him, too. Hes just a very likeable guy.

Orny Adams is far and above one of the best comedians I have seen in a long time. I am a stand-up fanatic so I've seen a lot of the same jokes being tossed around. Orny was topical, brutally honest, edgy and all the other adjectives you hear applied to comedians. He has a very Lewis Black/Bill Burr angry enthusiam/social commentary vibe about him and he pulls it off wonderfully. Kids, obesity, technology, American waste, relationships, customer service, and a few dozen other topics all pop up in his skit and all of them are funny. The first five minutes are a little slow because he is establishing his persona but then he explodes from there. I highly recommend this video! All the five star reviews are here for a reason!

Keep a look out for this guy, too.  If he comes to your town, SEE HIS SHOW.  His live stand-up routine, again, is a MUST SEE.  Find him on the internet.  He has several different, HILARIOUS websites.  One is simply called ornyadams.com, and from there, I believe you can find his 'brain noise' website, which is priceless.
