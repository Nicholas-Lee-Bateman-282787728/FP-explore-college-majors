6426818,3,B00KH57U60,"I really didn't care for Beware the Batman too much, however it was starting to grow on me and they cancelled it.  That is fine, I guess, I understand if the ratings are not there and toys are not selling however what made me mad is the fact that they made about another 10-15 episodes and never aired them or released them.  Would have been nice to get the whole season released so we could watch them to see if the show got even better.

I also think all shows deserve at least 1 complete season before taking off the air.",1408924800,3,524,4.1683168316831685
6426819,5,B00KH57U60,"Yes Batman TAS is superb. Superman TAS was great too imo. Let's talk about now. Beware the Batman took a chance and won me over. Instead of relying on The Joker, Penguin, Riddler, etc...already been done. They went for new villains and went for the long pay off and the League of Assasins and the big villain which so far (have not finished the series) has paid off. It has been an exciting and enjoyable series.  Not sure why CN pulled the plug. Surely you have to give a series more than one season to have a chance.",1408492800,19,518,4.285714285714286
6426820,5,B00KH57U60,"despite what anyone says, this is a good show simply because it goes outside the a-list villain list, Batman is actually a detective and not simply brawn here and changes it up a bit. I wish it wasn't killed off so soon, I wish they made more toys for it because I would love for it to be a part of my collection. they are currently airing the full season {part 1 & 2} show on cartoon networks toonami which is awesome. they show had incredible potential but it is what it is",1408233600,12,475,4.118279569892473

6426822,1,B00KH57U60,"This show is terrible and deserved to be cancelled. It should have never aired. Sure, the first minute was cool, but then every second after that just kept getting worse.

6426823,2,B00KH57U60,"I am sorry to anyone who likes this show, but this show was not good and easily one of the worst additions not only to the DC animated universe, but the Batman continuity in general. As a very devoted fan of most things Batman, I tried with great intensity to enjoy this show, but ultimately gave up. There is a reason Cartoon Network only aired about 5-6 of these episodes before pulling it off it's schedule entirely (did not even give it the courtesy of airing the last few eps after a loooong hiatus).

First off, the animation seems a tad out of place. They are clearly trying to go the route of recent successful kids shows like Star Wars: The Clone Wars, but it just seems ill suited to for a Batman in this case. The result was a very lackluster looking palette, with a hollow background, that while rendered in 3-D seems oddly 2 dimensional. For context, the old Batman the Animated Series program featured scenes almost exclusively at night to ease the burden on it's 90's animators, but the environment seemed much more in depth and less of a backdrop, with a full city alive and thriving (in a manner of speaking). BTB makes Gotham city just feels more like a general setting rather than a real(-ish) metropolis, teeming with life, and activity. The animation style makes the characters look awkward and clunky. At some points it feels that times when the show tries to be more ""adult"" its decidedly juvenile animation style quickly dragged you back to ""Y7"" reality.

The design of Batman was cool, but ultimately seemed stuck somewhere between trying to create it's own version of the character and paying homage to existing depictions. I did enjoy the hybrid look of the 90's Keaton suit and the The Dark Knight trilogy armor, but it still left a bit to be desired. Again it just felt like sort of a tired rehashing of a few existing suits rather than any attempt to capture this characters persona on it's own. The Batmobile design was excessive and just seemed again aimed at adding more lights and missiles for children's toy sales rather than serving any unique purpose.

The stories seemed exceptionally trivial and juvenile especially considering where Batman has gone over the last 30 years, and even what is out there on most other ""children's"" cartoons. I read prior to it's release that they had intentions of making the show a bit more realistic and dark, but scrapped that notion in the wake of recent violence. This notion can be observed in viewing. The show seemed to be caught somewhere between trying to look slick and cool for a slightly older audience, but still seemingly to wanting to simplify the world for sake of telling a children's story. And the inclusion of characters like Professor Pyg, who's monstrous depiction in the comics is more in line with something on True Detective than perhaps a Saturday morning cartoon, highlights this notion. After having Batman track down the likes of serial killers, drug peddlers, a absolutely crazed and homicidal Joker, etc., (the list goes on) over the last few decades, it seems highly disingenuous to see him running around fighting guys with laser guns in 2014. While understanding this is aimed at a younger audience, at least other shows like Young Justice or even the older Justice Leage and Unltd series has interesting enough material to warrant the more ""kid friendly"" subject matter. Certainly when compared to the offerings in the DC animated universe, (with the likes of Batman: Year One, The Dark Knight Returns, Under The Red Hood, Gotham Knight or any number of the justice league and related films) it is hard to view this as a just depiction.

The story decides to eschew the traditional telling in favor of slightly revamped roles for the principle cast. As someone who has seen dozens of varying interpretations, this idea is not lost on me and was a tad exciting. However again it ultimately falls short in execution. Alfred rather than being the reserved, voice of reason most non-comics fans have grown accustomed to, here Alfred is a hard-nosed, grizzled former MI6 agent who takes on the responsibility of protecting Mr. Wayne, in addition to providing aid for his masked counterpart. While this is nothing new to the DC universe an a mildly exciting prospect to anticipate, this depiction of Alfred in BTB just seems stodgy, stiff and very predictable if not bordering stereotypical. Just sort of a Jason Statham-esque, British action clone who is there to swoop in at the last minute and spout cool one-liners rather than offer anything useful to the story. Sure it is exciting to see a gun toting Alfred, but without the temperance and demeanor of the wise caretaker we know and love it to ground this idea, it seems out of place.

Additionally, the story, early on, introduces us to Katana, a recent mainstay of the DC universe who has rarely been shown outside of the comics. In perhaps the only truly interesting and unique spin on the shows mythos, Katana after some corralling (which to anyone who has ever read any comic or anything of this sort will find redundantly familiar) she becomes Batman's ""side-kick"" so to speak. Again while cool sounding on the forefront the actual depiction of the character was lacking. As a former MI6 agent, who one would assume is seemingly intelligent to have even endeavored such an existence, let alone survived and flourished in it, she really makes some dumb decisions and tends to come off as more of an annoying 2nd fiddle rather than a warrior or stalwart. As a result the inspection into her origins (what little was offered) was very uninteresting.

As for the Batman himself, he was thankfully his typical single-minded, brooding self, but they never gave the character anything to become fully aware or challenge him early on. While much of this is the result of the short airing schedule, I think a few episodes in is plenty of time to start forming a relationship with your main character and sadly it never came to fruition.
The voice-over work was great and the chosen voice for Batman/Bruce Wayne was excellent, but that's about where it ended.

The most frustrating part was that a far superior show in Young Justice and a less appealing, but still better than Beware the Batman show in Green Lantern were scrapped in favor of this. If kids were not buying Young Justice toys I can tell you right now NO kid is bugging his parents to rush out and get Beware the Batman action figures and gear.

Again overall I really, really tried to like this show. You can basically slap a Batman sticker on a garbage dumpster and I will watch it, but this was not by any means what I would call a welcome addition to the Batman realm. I would rank this and The Bat-Man (originally airing on the WB in the early to mid-2000's) as the worst entry into the batman continuity. While there may be one or two hardcore fans of this show, I can all but assure you most people will NOT like this.",1407196800,9,6941,4.716405605935696
6426824,5,B00KH57U60,"This is a great take on the classic Batman series. It is daring in reinventing Alfred's background and character, and also in having new villains, far from the regular villains seen all too often in Batman movies and series. And new villains work very well, and I believe should become a regular feature of all Batman comics. This is a great series. A must watch!",1406505600,24,363,4.6

6426831,5,B00KH57U60,"As a long time Batman fan, I went into this series with a critical attitude. I did not want anyone messing with the Bat or his mythology. This series is a wonderful breath of fresh air that has totally won me over.

This take on the Dark Knight has quite a bit of divergence from the previous Batman tales and backstory. Instead of Alfred being a fairly helpless and weak background character, he is recast as a former secret agent with quite an interesting story arc of his own, which is constantly informing the story lines. He is also much younger and very active as a butt-kicking member of the revised Team Bat.

Interestingly enough, it looks like there is no Robin or other of the extended sidekick and ex-sidekick universe in this version of Batman. In place of Robin we have Katana , another former secret agent trained to the level of the League of Assassins and a great colleague for Batman as opposed to just another juvenile sidekick, and I dare say way more pleasant than Damien, the professional smart-ass version of Robin that we are afflicted with in The New 52 comics. Katana and Batman have an excellent relationship that is hard core professional.

The series also does an amazing and unexpected change to Batman by not using the usual canon of Bat-villains. The villains that show up in this series are known in the Batman comic universe, but are brought into sharp focus in the foreground of these stories. All of them - Professor Pyg and Toad, Mockingbird, Humpty Dumpty, and Anarchy to name a few - bring a whole new flavor to the Batman universe. Where are the Joker, Clayface, Poison Ivy, the Penguin, and Tow-Face? Who cares? I did not miss them.

I think the plot lines in this series are outstanding. I found myself really surprised and almost shocked at some of the twists and turns in the stories as they unfolded. The series did a lot of what the The New 52 is doing now in the comics: anything is fair game from the past, just bring it in with a new take or a twist on the old character or situation. So we see the Outsiders, Harvey Dent, Commissioner Gordon, Barbara Gordon, and many others in ways we have not seen them before. All this is at first disconcerting, but the way I resolved all of this is by thinking of the whole series as an Earth 4 or 5 variation on what we are familiar with - like a big Elseworlds story. Which, I would argue, is the only way that the second Batman movie trilogy works - but that's another discussion!

Kudos to Glen Murakami and his team for coming up with something that is really unique, interesting, and just a lot of fun. As a hardcore Batman and comics fan, I regard myself as a pretty good authority on the subject, and you can rest assures that I am VERY happy with this series and its impact and effect on the DC universe. It is too bad this series didn't run longer as the plot lines were extraordinarily interesting and would have been very interesting to see as they unfolded. And I want to tell you - that ""Beware the Bat"" theme is outrageously cool! It made me want to go check out the album and the band!  I hope that Glen Murakami and his cohorts have another shot at an animated series because they deserve it and it will be amazingly excellent!",1461974400,11,3232,4.423529411764706

6426836,5,B00KH57U60,"WB wouldn't know a good Batman show if it hit them with multiple Batarangs. This was, by far, the best animated take on the Batman since TAS. The darkness pays good homage to the ""real"" world of Batman. The origins and the story flow well, and it includes the well-written scenarios that put Batman in situations where he actually has to critically think and use his detective skills rather than just sneak up and beat up bad guys in a halloween costume.  Sad that this is getting cancelled. It should have had more time to breathe. The end of this season, and sadly the series as a whole, was absolutely fantastic and would have opened a door for the best animated Batman yet. This wasn't as good as TAS, but by God, compared to what's being aired these days and what has aired in the honor of Batman, this has been the most faithful to the elements that made TAS what it was.",1455926400,3,877,4.380368098159509
