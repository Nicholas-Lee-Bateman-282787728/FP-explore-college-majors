4188539,4,B003SLEDL0,"Augenblick Studios has a pretty great reputation for putting out wonderful stuff. They animated cartoons for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wonder-Showzen/dp/B000CSUNMK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wonder Showzen</a>&nbsp;& created the bizarre & entertaining&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Superjail/dp/B002VWNIDQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Superjail!</a>. They have a real talent for animation & an even greater talent for satire.

Ugly Americans focuses on Mark Lilly, a New York social worker in a world where every supernatural & otherwordly creature not only exists but lives side by side with ""normal"" people. It's Mark's job to help these creatures adapt to life in the United States as well as try to stay in one piece. Remaining unmutilated & uneaten is a pretty difficult task when you've got a zombie roommate intent on devouring your flesh & a demon girlfriend intent on possibly eating your soul.

The great part about this is how wonderfully it parodies horror icons & tales as well as the idea of cultural misunderstandings & New York City itself. The animation is wonderful, occasionally reminding me a little of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Hole/dp/0375714723/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Hole</a>&nbsp;at times.  I couldn't help but love the Twilight/vampire parody episode & how vampires are supposed to be ""created"" in this universe. (If you were curious, it's very bureaucratic & not at all as fun as doing it ""au natural"".)

The only downside is that the humor in this is occasionally a little overly goofy & some of the jokes are sort of hit & miss. You'll either like this series or you'll hate it. As far as the DVD goes, I'm a little disappointed that the DVD isn't uncensored in some places. (One of the scenes has a Harry Potter clone flicking off Mark, which is censored.)

I don't really think it has the wide appeal that some of Augenblick's other stuff, but it's still worth looking at.",1287273600,7,2060,5.969491525423729

4188541,3,B003SLEDL0,"7 Episodes on 1 DVD Disc, released October 5, 2010

""Ugly Americans"" is a cartoon on Comedy Central that brings monsters and mythical creatures along with humans together in a society trying to find a way to get along. This DVD set is for Volume 1 which contains 7 episodes and Volume 2 will be starting on October 6th. Mark Lilly who is voiced by Matt Oberg is a social worker at the Department of Integration where he tries to help vampires, werewolves, and more integrate into society in New York along with the challenges that come with having a zombie roommate and a demon girlfriend.

Mark's zombie roommate, Randall is voiced by Kurt Metzger and his character is often having to fight the urge to eat his roommate and body parts coming off is often an issue. Demon girlfriend, Callie, voiced by Natasha Leggero, is a very demanding partner in the bedroom with intense hormone swings and wants to bring Mark down to hell to meet the family. Mark never gets a day off because the only other person who works in his department is an aging drunken wizard, Leonard voiced by Randy Pearlstein. Demon boss, Twayne voiced by Michael-Leon Wooley is interested in Callie who is repulsed by him and he takes it out on the department by piling the work on Mark.

It's an amusing multi-verse type situation combing wizards, demons, vampires, werewolves, the blob, fornicating trees, and Kong trying to distract himself with cleaning products. It's hard to tell how long it will last or whether these characters will really worm their way into the hearts of Comedy Central fans, but for the time being it has some laughs.

Bonus Features:

There is commentary on all episodes from series developer and executive producer David M. Stern, series creator Devin Clark, and executive producer Daniel Powell where they talk about guest stars and ad libs and how the series came about. There are also art galleries, a sneak peak of an episode for next season, and 5 webisodes covering everything from robots opinions of immigration to wizards talking about the obscenity of hip hop. The best part of this is the ""Official publication from the Department of Integration"" booklet that explains how to assist a zombie with flesh cravings, how to undergo proper vampire conversion, how to dispatch hellspawn back to the nether realm, what to do if attacked by a werewolf, how to peacefully end a Kong zoning violation, and how to handle a wizard labor dispute.",1286582400,4,2442,4.790973871733967

I pulled the DVD out of the player and noticed there was an object on the DVD (it looked like yellow styrofoam). I removed the debris, and the DVD played, but it still skipped; just not as bad, this time. I didn't have to turn the DVD-player off and on again to retrieve the DVD.

This type of humor/violence is right up my alley. This is not a kids cartoon! There is mystery, intrigue, violence, sex, and lots of cool creatures. It does remind me a little of Superjail (which I love) so that is probably why I am drawn to this show.

A cartoon with a good feel to it, with a mature,
but not too mature, story, with a hint of politics.

It's great to see that 2D animation is still used.
Not that I don't like CGI, but I grew up in the 80's,
and really like 2D animation. The same goes for older
action movies. CGI is good, but I really like
the olde school pyrotechnics.

8404468,5,B003SLEDL0,For anyone who loves great dark adult humor type cartoons this is the best discovery you could ever find on a Saturday night at 1 AM. This show is genius as brilliant writing an exceptionally funny characters with terrific voice acting and I was instantly hooked after watching one episode. Any fan knows series is terrific and was cut short and its unfortunate but at least release the rest of the series on DVD or give us a box set of the complete series in some kind of format. The fans would really love a complete set and who knows if its sold well enough people may want to be bringing or talk about bringing This show back to life.,1515456000,,638,4.325
