8088165,5,B000BKVS50,"I have a large assemblage of dvds produced for fingerstyle guitarists wanting to learn new material.  On a cranky day I would say that maybe half of them are mostly failures.  The reasons are often that many of the songs are written by the artist, are unimaginative or just plain awful, or that the artist is not a good teacher and poorly or incompletely explains the construction of the music.  I avoided this one for quite some time because while I have seen that Mr. Grossman is an excellent teacher, I was suspicious of the titles (of which there are 4) all being written by him.

It turns out that this is some of the best acoustic fingerstyle blues available on DVD.  While he can sometimes be hazy on the elements of the progressions (likely my weakness rather than his), there is nothing that he misses. Where necessary he explains the the unusual fingering for a particular chord and why, different elements and sources for many of the riffs comprising the songs, and importantly, the decorations (as he calls them) that give additional life to the music.  Additionally, in my opinion Mr. Grossman has the best overall techniques of anyone appearing in these kind of dvds, and offers a real learning experience in just teaching, without attempting to, things that distinguish a superb musician from the rest of the pack.

Even if you don't think you are ready for advanced lessons, get this dvd because it will teach you masterful techniques and familiarize you with songs you will aspire to play.  I am truly delighted with it.",1302566400,5,1537,4.730337078651686
8088166,5,B000BKVS50,"The DVD is another useful and better effort from Mr. Grossman, hence the five stars. But the title clearly suggests that it is geared toward ""advanced"" students. I'm still on the ""Fingerpicking Guitar Techniques"" right now. I'd save this DVD in the meantime after a month or so.",1216944000,2,278,4.8125
