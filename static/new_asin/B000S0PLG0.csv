2878237,5,B000S0PLG0,"OK, what can I say but here is the DVD you want for the holidays!  It has ""The Year Without a Santa Claus"" and with the Mr. Cold Miser (My Favorite) and Mr. Heat Miser acts, plus Dr. Seuss and others listed!  Boy do I love the Cold and Heat Miser songs!

Play this while you're putting up decorations, to help get into the Christmas mood!  Buy it so you don't have to keep looking through the TV Listings to see when it'll be on to watch/record.

It's sad they don't make this type of Christmas shows anymore.",1196294400,23,509,4.153061224489796
2878238,4,B000S0PLG0,"I was led to believe by others that this set contains more than just the four titles listed.  I haven't purchased the item, personally, and perhaps I shouldn't be reviewing it... but I thought it might be helpful to post some information I found about this set.  Columbia House has the description of this item as follows: ""It's a stocking stuffed full of animated gifts, 7 in all, to get you in a holly-jolly mood for the season! First up is the Rankin-Bass classic, Nestor the Long-Eared Christmas Donkey, an enchanting version of the favorite fable about the kind, little burro, ridiculed for his ears, who took a special ride to Bethlehem. And, when the coming of New Year's Day is threatened, who else can be called upon to save the holiday but the ever-reliable, red-nosed reindeer, in Rudolph's Shiny New Year? The 4-disc set also includes a double-helping of Dr. Seuss with How the Grinch Stole Christmas and Horton Hears a Who! plus more Rankin-Bass magic with The Year Without a Santa Claus, Twas the Night Before Christmas, Frosty's Winter Wonderland and Rudolph and Frosty's Christmas in July.""

This makes me wonder if the other reviewers actually watched the movies since they mentioned nothing of the other titles.  Or... Columbia House could be way off.  If anyone else has this set please post a review to clarify.  I am sure other buyers would be interested.  I know I am!",1194912000,12,1390,4.766666666666667
2878239,5,B000S0PLG0,"Finally, the long forgotten Christmas specials which are much of the Christmas specials as A Charlie Brown Christmas, Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer, Santa Claus is Coming to Town, Frosty the Snowman.  Always loved The Year Without a Santa, Shirley Booth was the perfect voice as Mrs. Claus and the toe tapping songs of Heatmiser and Coldmeiser.  Big Bad Voodoo Daddy did a cover version a few years back and I had to have a copy and glad I did.  So if for some odd reason you're tired of the previous listed holiday specials this is a nice alternative or a wonderful way of introducing them to a new generation.",1194566400,3,611,4.536363636363636
2878240,3,B000S0PLG0,"Warner Bros owns the rights to so many Rankin/Bass specials that have not been released since the days of VHS or not released at all. So why do they continually re-release the same specials over and over again? All of these specials have been released in single-discs over the years so I guess if you have not purchased them in the past then it is a good set. But why not stick on ""Pinochhio's Christmas"", ""The Life & Adventures of Santa Claus"", ""Little Drummer Boy Book 2"", ""The Leprechauns's Christmas Gold"" or one of the other non-DVD released specials? Also, while I do enjoy the ""Grinch"" special, it seems a little out of place on this box set as all the rest are Rankin/Bass and just that one is not. Maybe next year Warner Brothers will release a complete Rankin/Bass box set...they truly deserve it.",1190419200,25,807,4.572413793103448

2878253,1,B000S0PLG0,"A friend sent me this but failed to keep the gift receipt, so I'm stuck with it, but I'm not the only person on the 'net complaining about this and getting no help.  In fact, this is the second Warner Brothers DVD I've either bought or was gifted in the past few years that had this problem (the other was Batman)--and no, it's not my player since it does it on every player I've tried and on my computer.  Just a warning, don't expect all of your disks to work and don't expect a positive response from Warner Brothers over it, either.  We bought the Batman one and every disk in the store had this problem.  We even had problems with disk errors on a few recent games, too.  Manufacturers are getting cheap and crappy about this, so keep your receipts and be persistent!  All of the disks played on mine except for the Dr. Seuss one that had the Grinch and Horton Hears a Who.  Every player would try to play, but then give up after a bit and say ""disk read error"".  The most I was able to get it to play was up to the dahoo-doray song at the beginning and then it just froze and that was it.  It was new, no scratches, no blemishes, no fingerprints, no dust, no nothing.",1356566400,,1173,4.177777777777778
2878254,5,B000S0PLG0,These are great.  Video quality is not that awesome but the stories are still great.  It's more and more difficult to find these on TV each year so it's nice to have them on DVD's.,1348876800,2,180,4.114285714285714

So ""Christmasey"" and nostalgic, I play these discs on Christmas Eve while helping my mom with the finishing touches of cooking and cleaning.  My nieces and nephews also enjoy watching these toons.  If anyone grew up watching the classic Rankin/Bass toons, and really enjoyed them (as my siblings and I do/did), I recommend buying this set!

Like Rudolph, Nestor is picked on for a characteristic that ends up allowing him to save Christmas.  I remember all the other shows on this set from childhood and I'm glad to have them all together in a nice package.",1228867200,3,391,4.388888888888889
2878288,3,B000S0PLG0,This was a pretty good set of shows.  I liked the grinch because it was something that I was used to.  The other shows were a little weird in my opinion.  I think it is because I had never seen them before.  I am always willing to give new things a sporting chance.  Still worth the money,1227484800,,288,3.982456140350877

2878302,4,B000S0PLG0,"We got this pack to complete our set of Christmas shows - we had the Original Christmas Classics bundle but were missing The Year Without a Santa Clause, one my daughter loved. (Heat-miser, etc.) This was on there, along with the Grinch and Nestor the long-eared donkey and some other stuff.  Great material.  Between the two packs you should never lack for good holiday video.",1202860800,,377,4.7846153846153845

2878305,5,B000S0PLG0,"So if you were born after 1964, you will undoubtedly have already purchased the 1st ""Christmas TV Classics"" boxset that contained Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer, Frosty the Snowman, Santa Claus Is Coming To Town, Little Drummer Boy and Frosty Returns.

Now here is all you will need to complete your Christmas nostalgia memories to pass it on to your kids. Not only did the makers manage to pull together the remaining classic Rankin Bass holiday cartoons (including The Year Without A santa Claus, the woefully grim Nestor The Long Eared Christmas Donkey, Twas The Night Before Christmas, the Frosty's Winter Wonderland that SHOULD have been in the previous set instead of that execrable Frosty Returns, and the feature-length Rudolph's & Frosty's Christmas In July), but somehow also added How The Grinch Stole Christmas---all in one pretty blue box for under $20.

All of the discs contain the features that would also be included if they were bought seperately, such as the featurettes and bonus cartoon of Horton Hears A Who! What more could animation/Christmas junkies need?!",1200614400,9,1081,5.101694915254237

2878310,5,B000S0PLG0,"I can't recommend this one enough. If you want a more thorough collection, buy The Original Christmas Classics along with this one. I think that between the two collections, they have just about every Christmas special that I remember from childhood. These stories are great too. They make a whole world out of Santa Claus and friends and show how good must continually struggle to deal with the less kind energies of the universe. When you see them for the first time, you never know exactly how the stories will turn out. Once you see them, you'll want to watch them every Christmas!",1200182400,2,585,4.689320388349515

2878350,5,B000S0PLG0,"These where among my childhood favorites; as much part of the Christmas traditions as our tree, cookies, fudge, and caroling. As I grew into adulthood, I feared these treasures would be lost all because a few on the religious right started their War on Santa complaining that shows like these weren't biblical and not 'Christian'. The networks buckled and fewer and fewer of these shows were broadcast. But thank goodness for DVDs and the wonders of American Capitalism. Turns out there are plenty of adults like me who grew up with these shows, now buy them on DVD to share with our children, continuing the tradition. I love these shows for their innocence and simplicity. Perhaps they're not biblical, but who cares. The message of love, giving, and fellowship is stronger here than the often hatefilled messages emanating from those who tried to bury these shows.",1196640000,3,867,4.945205479452055
2878351,5,B000S0PLG0,"This serviceable DVD set contains the exceptional (Chuck Jones, Boris Karloff) ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" along with seven Rankin/Bass Christmas shows -- the '70s sequels to Rudolph and Frosty.

The true joy of this disk is the Grinch, which my kids watch over and over - much more than the (pretty good) Jim Carey movie.

8203599,5,B000S0PLG0,"Back in the fall of 2007, this set was actually cheaper than getting How The Grinch Stole Christmas, The Year Without A Santa Claus, Frosty's Winter Wonderland, & Rudolph and Frosty's Christmas in July as separate DVDs. In 2008, this set was redone as the Classic Christmas Favorites Collection, dropping Horton & adding 3 more Rankin/Bass Christmas classics; The Stingiest Man In Town, Pinocchio's Christmas, and The Leprechauns' Christmas Gold. Lucky for me I just own the set I'm reviewing, because those 3 specials were re-released with The Little Drummer Boy Book 2 on 1 Warner Archive DVD in 2012. I'm sure other people who own the 2007 set will be relieved to see and read this. The original MGM classics How The Grinch Stole Christmas & Horton Hears A Who (respectively made in 1966 and 1970 from Chuck Jones and Dr. Seuss themselves), were made by the same animation team responsible for many classic Looney Tunes shorts AND all the Tom & Jerry shorts from 1963 to '67; too bad my father doesn't realize that fact, as much as he hates the Grinch. But both have been beloved classics for tons of other folks worldwide to this very day, especially the Grinch. Horton being the only non-holiday special of the bunch has always proved the old Seussian saying, ""A person's a person, no matter how small"", even before getting its own Remastered Edition collection in 2008. The Year Without A Santa Claus (from 1974) stars Mickey Rooney as Santa, especially since this was one of the sequels to Santa Claus is Comin' To Town. But here, it was the Miser Brothers, Heat and Snow, who stole the show, ending up in countless fan-fiction stories & its own sequel in 2008, A Miser Brothers' Christmas. Also included are 5 more beloved Rankin/Bass Christmas Treasures; Rudolph's Shiny New Year (1976, featuring Eon the Terrible, Father Time and Happy the Baby New Year), Nestor, the Long-Eared Christmas Donkey (1977, which was later re-released with The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus, from 1985, from the Warner Archive, and narrated by Roger Miller as Speiltote, who also played Allanadale the minstrel rooster, from Disney's Robin Hood only 4 years earlier), Frosty's Winter Wonderland (1976, featuring Jack Frost and Frosty's snow-wife Crystal) 'Twas The Night Before Christmas (1974, made in a similar manner to 1968's The Mouse on The Mayflower, of mice and humans being together that is), and the longest one of the bunch, Rudolph and Frosty's Christmas in July (1979), which debuted on the big screen in the summertime in many countries, but not in the USA where it was only televised. This one has yet to be remastered, since it actually looks and sounds older than the other 7 specials in this set, with the picture and sound slightly off-kilter to boot. Nevertheless, it's a beloved feature-length crossover of Rudolph, Frosty and his family, and Santa, and it also features Big Ben from Rudolph's Shiny New Year and Jack Frost, who'd have his own special during the holiday season of 1979, and especially the dreaded Winterbolt, & Lady Borealis, who had a huge part in Rudolph's life, via his nose. If you haven't already, add this Christmassy treasure trove to your collection today, unless you have the 2008 set and feel gypped about hearing what's in the 2012 Warner Archive release. By the way, 2 of the discs have definitely-worthwhile bonus features, including behind-the-scenes shorts!",1401235200,,3404,4.93205574912892
