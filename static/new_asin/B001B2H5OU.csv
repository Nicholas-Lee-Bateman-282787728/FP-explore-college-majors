8281499,5,B001B2H5OU,I learn much from Sammy in this video.  He is a great coach and seems like a nice person.,1496707200,,89,3.6842105263157894
8281500,1,B001B2H5OU,"Wow, should have known. Don't expect anything great here. In fact this is terrible. I'd like a refund. This guy just stands still in front of the double end bag and throws single handed strikes, in a repetitive monotonous motion. There is zero emphasis on striking with an unpredictable rhythm; zero emphasis on moving around the bag; and zero emphasis on moving the head. They have a section called ""advanced"" but it's below basic level. The most impressive combo he shows is the 1-2-3, or-- jab, cross, lead hook; all while standing totally still, not shifting, nor moving the feet or the head; and not moving around the bag. Your skills will not improve with this video. Standing still like this and throwing strikes at this predictable rhythm will get you KO'd quick. These guys seriously don't know how to use the double end bag. It's as if they pulled it out of the box, hung it up, and started filming; after playing with it for the first time. Buyer Beware.",1487030400,,965,4.649122807017544
8281501,1,B001B2H5OU,"I was highly unimpressed..  This video is basically grown men flexing infront of a camera.  The thing I gained from wactching this, is knowing that just because someone makes a DVD-doesn't mean there's value in watching it.",1436659200,,223,5.0

8281503,5,B001B2H5OU,"Most of us who are purchasing training DVD's are at least a little experienced/knowledgeable with the equipment used and need to advance with additional training techniques, etc. This is the next level of quality training as well as real world techniques to use in your own double end bag routine.
Bravo!",1365379200,2,304,4.980392156862745
8281504,5,B001B2H5OU,I watched this and really liked the workout and instruction. I had got a double bag and found this very useful. Seemed a bit spendy at first but when I look at what I got from it - found it worthwhile and professional.,1352246400,2,218,4.093023255813954
