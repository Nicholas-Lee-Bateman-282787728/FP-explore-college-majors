5008126,4,B006NO1ST4,"I share much with my fellow reviewers already. The first thing that caught my attention was the energy of the orchestra and brilliant conducting. Later on I questioned some temps that seemed a little slow during Lady M's aria and the drinking song.  I'm not sure if this was the soprano's choice or the conductor's, but I found it distracting and labored in a few places.  The chorus is exquist and the other lead voices are very fine and not pushed.  Lady M and M were beautifully sung by very well produced voices.  This is the only production that I have heard where the two leads' voices were not overly huge and produced.  They were lighter than I have heard previously, but sang on the breath and never pushed or barked at each other like some of the heavier voices do.  I questioned some blocking issues that had Lady M wandering back and forth against the back wall in her first aria where I would have liked her further down stage.  Although Macbeth's acting was very good, I felt more of a one demention to Lady M who could only seem to produce one sinister look throughout the opera.  I felt she held back emotionally and I would have liked to have seen more sparks between the two leads.  The set was sparse, but it worked with the ever-smooth lucid blockiing of the fantastic chorus.  Sometimes I was wondering why the witches were in certain scenes not originally called for, but I soon got the message of the stage director and went with it.  One of the many good things about this production were the lack of cuts.  It is the first time I have heard Macbeth's lines after he was slain.  Normally, the opera is cut after he is slain and everyone's happy and the peseants rejoice.  I noticed more music than I hadn't heard before and I found that a very nice surprise.  I really like the production, but I was not thrilled.  However, if you are looking for a new production that will keep your interest, sung exceptionally beautiful, this is a very fine production.",1350000000,4,1979,4.4860335195530725
5008127,3,B006NO1ST4,"Opera is both a visual and an auditory experience. This is a brilliant Macbeth to listen to - all the singers were excellent -- but visually I would have thrown rotten tomatoes at the director if I had been in the audience --- In short visually it is just plain terrible and ugly.

The witches are all costumed like Tuareg Camel drivers -- I tended to think of them as the Camel Caravan. Lady Macbeth's attendants looked like they escaped from a Benedictine Priory. They were not costumed like ladies in Waiting. The male chorus, including Macbeth, by the end of the opera were dressed as if they worked for a moving & storage company as they were wearing the wide belts associated with heavy lifting. I doubt if this director has a clue what was worn in 11th century Scotland. And apparently he was too lazy to even find out.  When he put some armor on the chracters in the first act - they all looked like Cortez or Pizarro.

The Carousel horses were ludicrous in their flowing skits. The main stage prop for the end of the opera is large metal box made of bars. I suppose one was suppose to see some inner meaning it, but frankly it didn't do anything for me and I had no idea why it was there.

Also the costume for Lady MacBeth was distinctly unflatteringly. It used to be that those in charge of costumes made every effort for a flattering appearance even when the soprano was of generous propotions, as this soprano is. The white clinging costume she wore was downright ugly and unflattering. If I had been she I would have refused to wear it.

This was the now favored unitary stage with sliding pieces -- no effort made to use the stage machinery provided to really stage the opera. We just slide some pieces up and down and get the camel caravan to push some of the props on stage. I am beginning to think that productions like these will discourage a whole generation of opera goers who will have no idea what is happening since the staging bears no realationship to the libretto. In fact the compose would have a hard time recognizing this as his opera.

I have one final complaint. When did conductors dress like slobs?  You would think this was a dress rehearsal. I prefer to see my conductors in white tie and tails - I like the formality that a generation of conductor like von. Karajan brought to the podium. I suppose if you can't conduct like him there is no point in trying to dress like him - you might as well dress like a slob as this conductor did.",1346544000,10,2472,4.384279475982533
5008128,5,B006NO1ST4,"Let me add my voice to the chorus of accolades for this Macbeth. This is perhaps the most moving and involving performance of the opera I've ever experienced. M. Keenlyside took awhile to warm into the part; most of Act 1 and part of Act 2 he seemed to be doing Hamlet again. However he then became the MAN - bloody Macbeth! and by the last act was singing and acting better than I've ever heard or seen him. A WOW expericence! Lady Macbeth (L. Monastyrska) led off quietly at first and then started to become fully the character in ""La luce langue"". She then grew into the role so that she was completely deranged by the time of ""Una macchia"". I've heard fifty years of Macbeths but I've never heard any performance so utterly frightening as Lludmyla gave. Her stained, strange voice would have pleased Verdi himself. The other roles were very well done as well and all did a creditable job. Most of the production, sets, costumes were all good to seviceable. Phyllida Loyd for the most part kept things going but as most tinkering directors do overdid a few spots. The children business was just too much; especially the ones coming in for the Macbeths. A little of this would have done nicely for suggestive realism but not a whole kindergarten class. Antonio Pappano led the Royal Opera House in a stunning performance; he is one of the greatest opera conductors of the day.",1343779200,9,1378,4.582995951417004
5008129,5,B006NO1ST4,"What a pleasure to see a traditional but my no means old-fashioned ""Macbeth"". It does not have modern women with pocketbooks figuring as witches like the one from the Met but rather a very pleasant and very lively array of these creatures. The principals and the scenery could belong to any time but, along with the costumes, they are totally believable wherever you want to place them.
Keenlyside is superb and so is Monastyrska. I have never heard her before and notice that she will be singing ""Aida"" at the Met this coming season. Although ""Aida"" is not my favorite opera, I definitely will not want to miss Monastyrska.
I now own four different ""Macbeth""s. So far, my favorite ""Macbeth"" was the one with Kostas Paskalis and Josephine Barstow but I now would be hard put to decide which one of these two would go to the top of my list. Fortunately, as I now have both, it's a decision I don't have to make.

5008130,5,B006NO1ST4,"I must admit that whenever I see Simon Keenlyside's name associated with an operatic production based on Shakespeare I immediately have high expectations.  And this production does not disappoint in the slightest.

Everyone is familiar with the story of Macbeth, but Mr. Keenlyside brings a true-seeming broodiness to the title role - at first reluctant, then willing to commit murder at the urging of his wife (played masterfully by Liudmyla Monastryska), then expecting to triumph over the dictates of fate and finding that what the coven of witches revealed to him is becoming all too true.  It is a testament to Mr. Keenlyside's performance that you feel both sad for his character and glad to see him get what is coming to him all at the same time.  The imagery of the crown being kept in a golden cage fits perfectly.

As for Lady Macbeth, Ms. Monastryska is captivating, initially greedy and cunning, but subtle and driving at the same time, simultaneously evoking feelings of sadness and just desserts as the deeds that she and her husband have done drive her sleepwalking - and the blood that has been shed preys on her subconscious.  Verdi demands vocal gymnastics from his leading lady, and she delivers with room to spare.  Simply marvelous.

As for the overall production itself, it is well staged, not too much set and not too minimalist, with just the right amount of blood evidenced for this viewer.  Antonio Pappano does a good job with the orchestra, supporting the production and not distracting from it, while at the same time responding to the nuances of his cast.  And the coven of witches (lots of them!) all in scarlet turbans is a nice touch.  I enjoyed this immensely.  Highly recommended!",1340582400,19,1715,4.855670103092783
5008131,5,B006NO1ST4,"Shakespeare's irony filled tragedy of the Scottish warrior and governor (or Thane) whose ambition drives him to murder always makes for great stage and screen. Verdi's librettist, Francesco Piave, sets the Shakespearean English into singer-ready common Italian and compacts the play into a fairly concise - and very compelling - two hours plus. It is also very interesting to watch and listen to how the essential roles are written. Macbeth and his conniving wife are written very chromatically and with some wonderfully threatening parts. King Duncan, his son Malcolm and Macduff, the general of the forces loyal to Malcolm, are given more ""pure"", higher and less sinuous vocals as if to draw sharp contrast between good and evil. This is some of Verdi's best music and among his most dramatic - and violent - stories, as is befitting the dark original play. This production. originally presented in 2002 at the Royal Opera, presents a visually stunning look and feel by director Phyllida Lloyd and designer Anthony Ward.  Heavy on symbolism, there is the gilded cage that the murdered king's crown sits in until it is taken by Macbeth, seeming to symbolize the unattainable - or the not rightfully obtained. The poles of wood carried by the rebel army from Birnam Wood visually echo the sticks used by the cadre of red turbaned witches, with their fairly creepy ""unibrow"" appearance. The physical set is spare, minimalist with bursts of red - bloody and matching the turbans and the bright gold of the king's horsemen is echoed almost in parody by the armor worn by Macbeth and Lady Macbeth. This particular performance is of the 2011 revival and the performances are fantastic as well. Simon Keenlyside is a lean, warrior looking man who portrays his character with a nervous energy and a paranoia that grows as he realizes how accurate the witches' coven seems to be in forecasting his doom.  I thought Liudmyla Monastyrska as Lady Macbeth presented perfectly as the conniving, self serving and - eventually - deranged and paranoid individual who wanted wealth and royalty by using her vain husband. Excellent performances are also given by Steven Ebel as Malcolm and Dimitri Pittas as Macduff. The orchestra and chorus of the Royal Opera House under maestro Antonio Pappano perform very well. Pappano's pacing is spot on and his use of exactly the right blend of punctuated brass and lithe string textures is exactly what is needed in Verdi. The chorus of warriors and courtiers was superbly trained by Renato Balsadonna. I enjoyed this production throughly as the first ""Macbeth"" I had seen (have only heard it before). This beautifully packaged DVD with excellent sound and crisp visuals makes a strong addition for any opera collection. It would even be a very compelling experience for someone just getting into opera. Well worth your time!",1335139200,24,2849,5.021141649048626
5008132,5,B006NO1ST4,"This new release of Verdi's Macbeth from ROH is both a very satisfying and exciting performance. It is highly recommendable. I initially intended to just watch a few minutes of the set, but almost immediately I found myself auditiing the entire performance.

Simon Keenlyside has been indited for not being an Italian baritone. This criticism has been leveled at Thomas Hampson and Fischer-Dieskau. All three include this role in their repertoire. DFD made only a studio performance with Elena Suliotis as his Lady. The baritone was subbing for Tito Gobbi; it was performance that has been highly criticized and praised though the latter less so. Hampson's performance came from Zurich in a production which is easy to critcize for its ambiguity, but the baritone delivers a performance of great integrity and with his personal charisma he triumphs over any vocal chortcoming perccived or imagined. Keenlyside is also similarly gifted and triumphs as well. It is clearly a performance to which the singer has devoted both thought and imagination. He brings his considerable vocal gifts to the performance and while they may not include the robust column of sound that Taddei or Gobbi (or Warren or the underrated Robert Weede)had at their disposal his talent as a lieder singer is invoked at every turn; I don't think I have ever heard the text  delivered with such clarity and meaning. There is no attempt to darking and enlarge the sound that is naturally his. His Lady is a Ukranian soprano, Liudmyla Monastyrska. Vocally it is a thrilling performance, fearlessly delivered. Dramatically it has been criticized as immature. At times it does border on the ""hammy"" side, lacking in subtlety. In the house this is probably less of a problem; the camera, alas, captures more than one would like. It is wonderful to hear a big voice deliver the ""small"" notes and not fudge the fioritura; strangely at two points she sings a passage staccato rather than legato. I do not have a score so I have no way of knowing whether or not this is an option or just the caprice of a prima donna! An American, Raymond Acetim sings Banquo. He delivers his aria with requisite gravity and beautiful legato. On additional  musical matters mention must be made of the excellent choral work and the orchestra under Pappano. ROH is very lucky to have this conductor who brings both energy and great talent to his job, one that he loves very much. I don't know whether or not it was Pappano or Keenlyside, but the decision to include the Mal per me from the 1847 score was an excellent decision. It is Macbeth's last utterance and now having heard it I feel that is inclusion is justified and appropriate.

At this point I feel I must mention the very first Macbeth that made it to DVD, a performance from Glyndebourne from 1972. The conductor is the late John Pritchard, an artist one would not associate with this music. Even so he is a musician of talent and integrity, perhaps even energized by his superb cast. The young Josephine Barstow is a Lady of one's dreams. No, it is not an Italian voice, but a full blooded spinto who has the full measure of the role. Opposite her is the great Greek baritone who recently died., Kostas Paskalis. For those for whom only an Italian baritone will suffice, look no further. He is the real thing, blessed with musianship and artistry. The Banquo is the very young James Morris.

The production is effective and imaginative and while not literal it does an excellent job of evoking medieval Scotland. The costumes are not period appropriate but not a grab bag mixture of period styles, rather simply ""period"". The Witches all wear orange colored turbans and have been given ""uni"" brows. They are utilized in ways that are interesting, e.g., Macbeth's letter is delivered to his Lady  by one of the witches and Banquo's son is saved by a witch.

In short a performance of distinction to set along side the Glyndebourne performance",1333324800,13,3949,4.807069219440353
8501453,5,B006NO1ST4,Terrific performance.  Keenlyside is good; supporting cast too.  Production values excellent.  Engaging performance all around for what is usually a rather static opera.,1480982400,,169,6.260869565217392

8501455,3,B006NO1ST4,"I. Certainly agree with the positive comments about the orchestra, the principalw and chorus.  The production is ok, but I found it difficult to follow because of the terrible camera work.  Too much of it was extreme closeups, realyy close when there were arias or duets being sung.  Even with witches, there were closeups on faces.  Why?????  I finally shut down my TV and just listened to the performance",1460332800,,406,4.826086956521739
8501456,4,B006NO1ST4,"It's good. I should have gone for Blu-ray. Didn't know it was available. The famous ""Una Macchia"" aria towards the end of the opera, the high point of it really, is performed competently, even if not as brilliantly as you can hear on the famous recording by Maria Callas (which you can listen to on YouTube).",1444176000,,308,4.517857142857143
8501457,5,B006NO1ST4,"Some of the transitions were clever, e.g., Macbeth's writing the letter in one scene that is transported by the witches to Lady Macbeth in the next scene. Re the witches,  they should have slumped and pulled some black material over themselves at ""Vanito!"" rather than sit upright plainly visible holding their sticks.  Monastryska made some ugly piggy-faces that seemed unnecessary. There was a puzzling interlude during which a lot of children joined Macbeth and Lady Macbeth on a bed (undoubtedly to point up that King Macbeth's MAIN problem was his and his queen's childlessness) . But those are quibbles. There was an aria by Macbeth at the end, when he is usually already dead, that I had never heard before.
All in all, I enjoyed it and recommend it.

PS. I wholeheartedly agree with DDD's comments about the great Paskalis-Barstow ""Macbeth"" DVD from their performance at Glyndbourne in 1972. It is my all-time favorite that I never tire of watching.",1432339200,,957,4.96875

8501459,1,B006NO1ST4,"The singing was very good.  Didn't have a problem with the staging; though some reviews have complained about too many witches or too many children and this may have been over done, but I'm no expert.  I also have very little Italian and this production has at best 25% of what is normally supplied in subtitles. It is by far the stingiest in subtitles of the 50+ opera DVD's I own.  Of course, subtitles can never be a complete translation, but this production supplied barely enough to vaguely follow the action and is silent about much of what the characters are emoting.  Don't understand the reason for this stingy choice, but it really affected the pleasure in the performance for me and forces me to look for another DVD version of Macbeth.

P.S.  Bought another version of this opera, Macbeth, with Leo Nucci and what a difference! Singing is every bit as good, but does have at least 4 times the subtitles, so now I can really feel the emotion of what they're singing because I understand.  It's as simple as that.  I would really avoid this Royal Opera House version unless you have descent Italian or are some kind of opera expert.",1402185600,4,1142,4.5911330049261085

8501462,5,B006NO1ST4,"As a retired executive director of an opera company I have seen very many opera productions and performances. Macbeth is an opera which is seldom performed so I have not seen as many performances of it as one might expect. However, I have never seen a satisfying performance live of this opera. This DVD from Covent Garden is the best performance of Macbeth I have ever seen, and I suspect that I would be saying this even had I actually seen many performances. The cast is outstanding. Simon Keenlyside is one of my favorite baritones and a brilliant Hamlet in the Covent Garden performance on DVD with Natalie Dessay. His performance as Macbeth is equally excellent both vocally and dramatically. I had never heard Liudmyla Monastyrska before, therefore, her Lady Macbeth was a stunning surprise. She is imperious and menacing and yet subtle and complex. Her performance is riveting. The production - all black, red, cream and gold - by Phyllida Lloyd - is gratifying in its clean lines and use of symbols in place of the usual ""hordes"" of on-stage extras. I can recommend this DVD highly.",1370649600,5,1091,4.808510638297872
