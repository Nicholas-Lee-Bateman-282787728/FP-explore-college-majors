7071744,3,B00UVQQ336,"Ordered this video, to help give me some additional training as I was going thru truck driving school. There are 3 dvd's - Pre-trip, backing, and driving. I found the pre-trip and backing video's most helpful. On the driving portion, I would have liked to see more on  ""double clutching"", but overall not a bad purchase. Must have helped as I passed all my CDL test on the first try.",1447459200,9,383,4.4714285714285715
7071745,3,B00UVQQ336,THE PRETRIP INSPECTION WAS USEFUL BUT THE REST WAS NOT VERY USEFUL. IT ALSO HAS NO INFO ON THE WRITTEN PORTION OF THE EXAM,1436745600,2,122,4.125

8708539,4,B00UVQQ336,Adequate. A little short and material is dated. Use this with your state manual and you will be good.  Presented fairly well.,1476230400,,125,4.681818181818182

8708541,5,B00UVQQ336,I bought these for my husband. He is a farmer worker and was thinking it might be a good idea if got his CDL class A. He already had class B. Anyways he watched them once or twice so far but hasn't done much past that I'm assuming that it was good information and that if and when he does take the test it would have been very helpful in him learning what he needs to know to pass it. I received this at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review.,1468800000,2,455,3.903225806451613
