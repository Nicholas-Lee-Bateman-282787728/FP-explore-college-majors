3777581,1,B001RP976A,"Although this is on Blu-Ray, it's not in HD.  The entire thing is standard def with black bars.  The cartoons are funny, but you may as well just buy the DVD and save some money.",1242172800,8,178,4.057142857142857
3777582,3,B001RP976A,"First off, I must say that this DVD is much better then the Family Guy episodes lately. For me, a lot of the jokes fell flat though. I was never grossed out or offended. I just felt that some of the jokes were so blunt, that they weren't as funny they could of been being a little more subtle. The frog scene is a good example of this. If you like Family Guy but don't like some of the raunchier stuff in the show, then this isn't for you. If I said there was nothing great about this DVD I would be lying though, because some of the sketches are pretty funny. One of the memorable scenes for me was the Wiley Coyote scene.

This is a good DVD for fans to rent for a one time watch. What keeps me from giving this 4 or 5 stars is the fact that most of it is just 50 minutes of thoughts that should of been kept in Seth's head or used in Family Guy episodes as filler instead of a country song.",1242172800,21,893,3.9065934065934065
3777583,4,B001RP976A,"I love Seth Mcfarlane and his writing team's sense of humor.  He's got a dirty mind and his opinions(social, pop culture, political) are all worn on his sleeve.  I love him for this.  Plus, he's made a show, Family Guy, that speaks to people my age.  All the references require one to be at least 25 years old to get.  Though, it amazes me to find even younger folks loving the show too.  Wonder what they think is so funny about it?

Well, this is basically 54 minutes of shorts with nothing but dirty thoughts on its mind.  Each segement runs under a minute with a few exceptions.  Most are really funny.  Some are mildly funny.  And some are just not funny at all(the Quentin Tarantino segment pops into mind, the second segment with the Scottish man yelling at the screen does too).  It seems the Mcfarlane's writing stlye is just a stream of conciousness that bounces from the years of pop culture cultivated in his brain.  This dvd works on the same level.  It's got the Family Guy tone but it seems to want to go to places that were too abstract or too racey for broadcast television.  Hell, some of the bits seem like things they couldn't put on Family Guy.

Is it funny? Sure, I thought it was funny enough for the price I paid to own it.  If you like Family Guy, then you most likely will enjoy it.  It's missing the familiar characters from that show, which helps in its humor, but it hits its targets more then it misses.

Personal favorite segments are The Frog Prince, The Cats in a Board Meeting, the Sex With...segments, and the Sheep Shearing segment was hysterical.  Good luck.  Have fun.  Lighten up.  Remember, humor, not matter clean or dirty, can't really hurt you.",1242172800,8,1687,4.459016393442623
3777584,2,B001RP976A,"It's a shame this cost 15 dollars. Its running-length is less than an hour, and there really are no special features to make up for it, other than a look at the premiere, which, of course, is about as thrilling as it sounds. What the creators really should have done was added the ""cavalcade"" in as an extra, then went back and made something that's actually good, and worth spending 15-20 bucks on, for the feature.

3777603,5,B001RP976A,"Have you ever watched Family Guy and thought ""these jokes don't drag on long enough"" or ""this isn't offensive enough"" or ""why aren't there gratuitous nipples on this broadcast TV show"" or ""I wish they would let Seth Green just improvise an entire sketch""?

Then DEFINITELY get this.

If not, you're pretty normal and might be slightly irked by some of those things. I personally felt that Seth improvising a REALLY long sketch about Matthew McConaughey being eaten alive by a shipwreck survivor was delightful. You might not.

Some of the sketches are clear winners and made me snort my drink. That'll teach me to watch this while drinking strong spirits! Others were a little weak in implementation. But all in all well worth the purchase price.",1456876800,,746,4.858267716535433

I recently purchased it and I know that I will be able to watch it again down the road when I really need a good laugh. The skits are so random, well done, and just plain funny. I laughed so hard. Macfarlane, his writers, and fellow producers did a great job with this project, in my opinion, and I hope that they decide to release more of these in the future.

They are what you might expect, rude and lewd, but sadly a lot of them do fall flat. There are a few hilarious ones, in particular the sheep shearing one, but by and large it's an Okay product. What is unfortunate is that there are only some 50  skits and the total run time is very short, about an hour. The dvd isn't expensive and is likely to remain a curiosity purchase for Family Guy fans who can't wait for the next dvd release of the series. Take it or leave it.",1424304000,,636,4.129032258064516

This compilation seems like it was a series of rejected Family Guy cutaways.  Rejected because they were too long or maybe the final product didn't quite have the right punch.  There is an inherently unfinished quality about these clips.

3777635,3,B001RP976A,"This DVD felt like all the jokes Fox wouldn't let on the air for being too weird, sexual or otherwise inappropriate. There def were some that were rather funny and clever (if you like Seth MacFarlane of course). But a good portion of them were just gross, annoying, or kind of stupid. And while it goes along with the territory sometimes the lack of variety in his cartoons' voices gets a bit annoying. I mean, for one guy he's got a pretty good range...but even then the voices tend to repeat a lot. It did get some good laughs, but it's def not worth $15.

-someone hanging from a cliff takes a dump and it lands on a couple getting married, who take it as an omnious sign -END JOKE-
-Quentin Tarantino curses about his problems while slicing off a babies foreskin with a samurai sword
-a frog asking for oral sex
-Seth McFarlane's thinly veiled jealousy of Entourage's success is shown through a skit where the two main characters argue and make up in like 10 seconds, then you see cartoon boobs
-someone shoots a piece of poop with horse legs out of their nose (THAT'S DA JOKE xD)
-a man in a glass house has a turret on top and says f*** a lot
-everyone says f*** a lot (WOW SUCH AN EDGY/COOL/HIP/TOTALLY-NOT-A-TRYHARD-DOUCHEBAG MOVE THERE SETH)
-a man yells at his tv (BUT IN A SCOTTISH ACCENT xD!!1!)
-and my favorite skit of all, the one where a once beloved talented man shamelessly rips off the fans that gave him a career in the first place

I forgot the rest mercifully but if any of these sound funny just look them up on youtube to see how horribly horribly wrong you are. The premiere is probably the funniest thing because you can see Seth's army of brown nosers forcing laughter in some truly oscar award-calibar acting, while the reporters just have a sober and bored face on, much like the audience at home.

Watch CCC if you're interested to see how a Seth McJewland's bloated ego shamelessly sells out at the expense of his fans. How the mighty have fallen, complete amateurs could've done a  better job than this shameless pathetic cash grab.",1332892800,,1685,4.478827361563518

I love Family Guy and American Dad, but this is just random juvinile humor with no plot at all. 50 random crass cartoon comedy shorts that each last anywhere from 10 seconds to 2 minutes. You know how Family Guy has random inserts such as Peter Griffen saying... that's like a lizard riding a money's back while a clown throws up in a corner and then they show it? This is random like that. A lot of it is just crass for the sake of being crass like name that animal penis where then the contestant needs to call his father for phone-a-friend and describe it to him. A lot of swearing and randomness like a man throwing stones with a glass house... that happens to have a machine gun on top of it!!! Or a scottsman watching a movie and talking through it like 'don't open the door, he's behind it! Oh you opened the door now run away!' After watching this I was thankful Fox and television have censors and standards, because I fear what Family Guy would be with Seth MacFarlane's brain unleashed.

Ultimately, this DVD will only appeal to hard-core fans of Seth MacFarlane. What you get is a series of shorts that barely approach an hour long and are mostly lacking in the ""comedy"" portion of the product's title. Many reviewers have noted that the format follows that of the cutaways of a typical Family Guy episode, but these aren't really Family Guy material (and you really shouldn't be expecting Family Guy-esque humor from this set of shorts - this set is a different sort of beast). Most of these shorts rely on lazy writing and the shock value of being uncensored which somehow excuses the shorts from actually having to be funny. Admittedly, there's about 5 or 6 amusing bits, but realistically, it's not like you can't find those on YouTube and the likelihood that you'll rewatch this entire DVD to get to the 5 or 6 amusing bits is slim to none. Overall, it's a bad return on investment unless you're the sort who feels that Seth can do no wrong. To be honest, I would recommend renting this if you feel you HAVE to see this. If you still feel it's the funniest thing you've ever seen, then go ahead and buy it, otherwise you'll feel cheated no matter what price they put on this thing.

The Cavalcade is similar to Robot Chicken in that everything is a series of shorts. Most attempt (and I stress attempt) to use vulgarity, sex, (you get the point) in order to get a quick laugh. The bad part is nothing is funny or well done. I'm ok with toilet humor, heck that is what I was hoping for in this DVD. What I got was the toilet without the humor. I can sum up most of the shorts as simply showing two animated characters having sex, something vulgar (but not funny) is said and then on to the next similar and still not funny short.

And Jeebus H. Krist on a vibrating pogo stick--this thing is awful, just absolutely, completely, every stinking bit, head-shakingly bad.

My only guess as to how a series of 30-odd ""comedy"" vignettes this repetitive, derivative, scatological and just plain stupid actually can get produced and distributed is that Seth MacFarlane's ego and more importantly his wallet are so big and powerful that literally no one can stop him now.  It started with that not quite equally bad (but close) ""Family Guy Presents Seth & Alex's Almost Live Comedy Show"" on Fox.  I mean,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Family-Guy/dp/B000083C6V/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Family Guy</a>&nbsp;is really funny, yeah, but who in the name of Grandma's famous basted turkey breast wants to hear MacFarlane croon ""Edelweiss?""  That's not ironically funny, or even funnily ironic; it's just base indulgence, and we all suffer for it.  Apparently no one has the courage to tell MacFarlane that this ""comedy"" emperor has no clothes.

This show is not a Family Guy spin-off; there is no relationship whatsoever.  There are more than enough characters who've got the stock, Brian-like voice, and there's one very, very stupid sketch in which a massively overweight Jesus looks exactly like Peter Griffin, but that's about it.

Man, does Seth MacFarlane have a thing for feces.  From the very first bit, and sprinkled liberally throughout the show, you get quite a bit of it.  And MacFarlane digs Fred&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flintstone/dp/B0001CNQUS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flintstone</a>, too, and unfortunately Fred and feces come together in one of the worst sketches of this collection, a scatological eternity waiting for a punch line that never comes.

More than anything, this show is just raw, without being funny.  Now, raw can be funny; witness the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jackass/dp/B000GBEWHK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jackass</a>&nbsp;offerings.  You get a lot of profanity in this show, as if just having cartoons uttering goofy strings of hard-core obscenities in itself is something funny.  Not quite.  Now, the delicately inserted obscenity, even if really filthy, with the right timing, in the right comedic environment, by the right character, can be really funny--most recently&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Step-Brothers/dp/B001G5T6GC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Step Brothers</a>&nbsp;gave us quite a few of those, not least Mary Steenbergen dropping the F-bomb.  But here, the profanity is forced and awkward, as if someone had given the writing direction, ""Okay, let's put lots of swear words in here so, you know, it'll be really dirty and funny and stuff.""

The special features consist only of a poorly produced, ultra-lame ""documentary"" of the ""gala premiere"" of this video.  It's McFarlane and his fellow ""actors"" responsible for this thing larfing it up and being smug and wacky at some West Hollywood bar (Seth Green shows up, and with a full beard and hat pulled way down tight, looking strangely like Woody Allen's Castro persona from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bananas/dp/0792846060/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bananas</a>).  Lame.  The only other special feature is a series of stills from the show, which actually aren't quite bad, and are more or less presentable in public.  The only value these could have would be for a computer desktop.

Bottom line: If you're a Family Guy fan, don't bother, as this thing has nothing to do with the show, other than its production paternity.  If you dig really low-brow toilet humor, and obscenity-laced doody gags that go on interminably, then this is the one for you.",1265328000,3,4281,6.328743545611015

Well, chances are that there is a good handful of these scenes that will make you laugh until you wet your pants, but there are also scenes that are either pointless or to the point of gut-wrenchingly awful. This DVD is a bunch of sketches that Seth MacFarlane did when he needed to focus away from Family Guy and American Dad! (and most recently, The Cleveland Show), and to be honest, most of them are really pointless and unfunny.

Notice how I said ""most"". Not all of them are throwaways, heck, I still get a kick from ""Fred Flintstone Takes a S**t"", and that's just a still image with some noises in the background. A few other keepers were the ""sex with _______"", mostly because they were short and to the point. However, that's probably only about less than 5 minutes of enjoyment I'd turn back to, as watching this thing seemed to be a chore and I've forgotten about half of the stuff included on here.

I can literally not believe how disgusted I was while watching this. First off, I am a huge fan of offensive humor. A lot of the jokes I make are quite offensive and rude, I have a twisted and vulgar sense of humor. And secondly, I love MacFarlane. He one of the funniest cartoon shows ever. Of the entire 55 minutes, two of the skits were only chuckle-raising: Things You Never Hear and the My Gal's P**** is the Smallest in Town song. The rest is FAIL.

This is basically what would happened if a bunch of outtakes from the worst episodes of Family guy and American Dad were piled into a 54 minute short. The jokes are just plain offensive- Gay jokes, pedophilia jokes, AIDs jokes, racist jokes etc. I'm far from prudish/homophobic and those were just appallingly tasteless. Overall, I would not recommend this movie to ANYONE, not even my worst enemy, and the blu-ray will forever sit on my shelf and collect dust as time goes by.

3777712,2,B001RP976A,"You may walk quickly past this DVD in the store and do a double-take, thinking to yourself, gee, that looks like the style of animation you would see in ""Family Guy"".  Could it be made by the same people?  You lean in closer and pick it up from the rack to discover, yes, it is indeed Seth MacFarlane's work.  You want to take this barely-hyped-about yet oddly over-priced hidden gem to the register, happily hand over your hard-earned money and bring home your own personal copy of greatness.

Don't do it.

If you want to give this a watch, I'd strongly suggest for you to sample some of the clips on Youtube.com first.  Most of them are bland and just not all that funny.  Each skit averages about 2 minutes each in duration, if that.  There are certain skits that are more watchable than others, such as skits involving Super Mario and the Legend of Zelda.  But that does not excuse the high price that you will normally see this going for, anywhere from $[...] on Amazon.com to $[...].

Certain skits like the Scotsman who yells at the TV shows he's watching, or Bob Marley's confession are barely even worth a suppressed chuckle.  This has been toted as a collection of clips you can't see on TV no matter how hard you try.  It's easy to understand why.  It has also been boosted up for its unabashed, uncensored material.  You can see the same lack of censoring on later seasons of ""Family Guy"" on DVD.  These all seem like skits that were all compiled together as out-takes from all of the crappier episodes of ""Family Guy"".  Hopefully, no one out there has their first brush with MacFarlane from this DVD or we have just lost  a potential ""Family Guy"" fan.",1249516800,3,1665,4.496666666666667

3777714,1,B001RP976A,"I had high hopes for this DVD - The Family Guy creator without the restrictions of network TV. The DVD consists of a bunch of short ""skits"". A few are very funny, most are boring, and a few are downright stupid. For example, there is a skit of a Scotsman watching movies and commenting on them - it gets old after the first movie, and then they come back to it later in the DVD for more yawns. There are a lot of infantile sex scenes, which would not necessarily be bad if they could be done with the genius twist that Seth usually has. Unfortunately they come off as being written by a 12 year old, and probably only a 12 year old would find them amusing. I now have the feeling that Seth is more funny when he is trying to get around the TV censors than when he is not restricted at all. I hope he got this out of his system so he can try to get Family Guy back on track at last.

3777738,2,B001RP976A,"Seth MacFarlane has become and industry into himself, just as Matt Groening did when he brought the world THE SIMPSONS. MacFarlane has ingratiated himself into the world of television fandom with his series FAMILY GUY. In an attempt to not limit himself to one thing, he's decided to make something new, a skit based direct to DVD release called SETH MACFARLANE'S CAVALCADE OF CARTOON COMEDY.

With a title like that it's hard not to go in expecting the funniest thing since...well what ever you think of as the funniest thing. I mean some laugh at jokes while others laugh at skateboarders breaking an arm. For MacFarlane this release is just like his series in that it gives some tremendous laughs at times and some jokes that start off as unfunny and turn into items that are dragged out far too long. Not only that, his penchant for attempting to offend someone somewhere along the line is blatantly obvious in more than one skit.

Each skit is offered with black screen title cards letting you know what is coming. And given the chance to break free of the bonds of television censors, MacFarlane does just that in spades. A sample would be a skit that revolves around a group of animals in the forest who have had it with the most obnoxious creature there they know, the bad boy of the woods, the beaver. After arguing with one and calling him out on several issues of bad behavior, they call him a vagina. And afterwards decide that yes, using his name to represent the other seems fit. If you don't get the reference don't ask. You will be one of those people who don't get offended but at the same time doesn't get most dirty jokes when told.

Skits involving the act of sex with various celebrities or people are some of the funnier moments found. Again, they might be a bit more than most youngsters should see let alone understand, but for adults you'll get a laugh out of them. Most notable are ""Sex with Mr. Sulu"", ""Sex with Optimus Prime"" and ""Sex with a Tube of Toothpaste"".

Jokes involving excrement, 5 foot nipples, horny frogs and more are offered here. And while some are actually funny, most run the usual level of grade school humor that we all laughed about when young but hate to admit to these days. Still, a few can bring a chuckle now and then.

Among the good is a piece where Wile E. Coyote actually catches the road runner. What happens after answers a question few have ever considered. Among the bad is a Scotsman who feels the need to comment on every movie he watches, the far too long piece referred to earlier.

For those who are truly easily offended, watch out for the skit involving fat Jesus which has an obese Jesus to busy discussing his gastrointestinal problems to heal a dying man brought before him. As I said, to me it seemed that MacFarlane was taking aim at what he considers easy targets with the hope of offending as opposed to offering a bit higher level of humor than usual.

While I love FAMILY GUY, even when it tosses in those questionable moments, this one offers fewer laughs per minute than the series does. Just because the opportunity to break free of the reins of limited censorship arise doesn't mean that you can make something funny without the restrictions. Offensive or insulting don't always make humor. And preaching to folks with similar opinions doesn't mean the jokes are funny. It's like making your friends laugh at a personal joke. You and your friends might get it, but the rest of the world won't.

Strange as it may seem from these statements I can still find humor in this release to DVD. My only problem is that I think there is something better, something funnier, still to be mined from the brain of Seth MacFarlane. My wish is that he attempt to take that route rather than the easy one next time.",1244332800,7,3781,4.55

3777744,2,B001RP976A,"What do you get when ""Family Guy"" creator Seth MacFarlane is uncensored?  You get ""CAVALCADE OF CARTOON COMEDY"", featuring mini animated shorts with unrelated characters that pushes the envelope of animated comedy that goes into sex, racism, bestiality and anything he and the writers could think of that would be crazy and offensive.  What these shorts come down to is how amusing and hilarious the story comes down to for the viewer.  Otherwise if one is easily offended, this is not for you.

The shorts are featured on YouTube.com via SethComedy and is one of the most watched YouTube channels each week.  Featuring possibly over 50 or more animated shorts (some last anywhere between a minute to three-minutes long), you can expect to see the following:

  * Super Mario Rescues the Princess - Have you ever wondered what happens after Mario saves the princess from Bowser?  Well, in this segment, all Mario wants is a kiss for all the hard work but what happens when the princess doesn't want to?
  * Mountain Climber - What happens when a mountain climber needs to take a dump while climbing a mountain?
  * The Gay Knight - What happens when a gay knight doesn't want to fight a killer dragon?
  * Dracula Meets Magic Johnson - What happens when Dracula decides to go after Magic Johnson and sucks the blood from his neck?
  * Small Talk with Aunt Helen - A story about a guy who talks to his aunt about what he did with the frozen wedding cake he and his wife stored in the freezer.
  * Fred Flinstone - What kind of bodily sounds does Fred Flinstone make when he's taking a dump?
  * Die, Sweet Roadrunner, Die - What happens to Wiley Coyote after he succeeds in catching the roadrunner?
  * Name that Animal Penis! - Animals stick their penises inside a hole and contestants must know what animal the penis belongs to.
  * The Frog Prince - When the Princess believes that she should kiss the frog to turn into a prince, what request will this certain frog make the princess do?

These are just among the few several animated shorts in ""SETH MACFARLANE'S CAVALCADE OF CARTOON COMEDY - UNCENSORED!"" with dozens more included on the DVD and Blu-ray release.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""SETH MACFARLANE'S CAVALCADE OF CARTOON COMEDY - UNCENSORED!"" is featured in Full Screen (1:33:1) and for those with 16:9 TV's, you will see the black bars on the side.  The video is featured in AVC @ 35 MBPS.  Because the videos were designed for the web, it's not exactly what one would expect to see on High Definition. If anything, it's quite normal and truthfully, there may not be much of a huge difference between the Blu-ray and DVD release.

Colors are not necessarily vibrant for this release but knowing that the intention was not for home viewing but more for online viewing through YouTube, I was not expecting much when it comes to detail for the character designs and animation.

The goal of these shorts were to entertain people online and the goal in mind was not to produce high quality animation but animation in the Seth McFarlane style but humor that is much more over the top.  So, don't expect hyper-detail, a lot of shadowing or anything like that with this release.

As for audio, audio is featured in 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio.  Similar to the video, these shorts were produced strictly for online.  So, you're not going to hear an immersive soundtrack.  In fact, it's front channel, dialogue-based animation.  So, audio is clear and understandable but this is not an animated release to expect immersive audio.

As for subtitles, you get the English SDH, Spanish and French subtitles.

SPECIAL FEATURES

""SETH MACFARLANE'S CAVALCADE OF CARTOON COMEDY - UNCENSORED!"" comes with a free download code for people to download the first episode of ""Family Guy"", ""American Dad"" and ""Futurama"".  As for the special features on the Blu-ray disc, the following is included:

JUDGMENT CALL:

""SETH MACFARLANE'S CAVALCADE OF CARTOON COMEDY - UNCENSORED!"" is definitely hit or miss.

Some will find some shorts hilarious and some will find them absolutely stupid.  For me, I found some shorts to be quite hilarious but I found it much more easier to watch them in short bursts and not watch all one after the other in one sitting.  Otherwise, the humor can get it old.

I watched this with a few friends and some found it absolutely disgusting and some shorts to be hilarious but they couldn't watch it completely and felt it was too overboard for them that it was more disgusting and crude than funny.

So, I think people who are familiar with Seth MacFarlane's animated series and are familiar with these shorts, will enjoy watching how far he will go in making people laugh or raise an eyebrow.  It all comes down to one's sense of humor and if you can laugh it out, that's good but otherwise, if you are serious minded, some shorts may be quite offensive.  You can read the YouTube,com comments of the shorts that you will see people on both sides who feel his ""Cavalcade"" works are enjoyable and the other side who feel otherwise.

As for Blu-ray or DVD?  Personally, this is one of those releases where the Blu-ray is not far off compared to the DVD.  Aside from a 1080p transfer and DTS-HD Master Audio, ""SETH MACFARLANE'S CAVALCADE OF CARTOON COMEDY - UNCENSORED!"" is not exactly a release that takes full advantage of High Definition.  If you are a Seth MacFarlane fan and you can get the Blu-ray at a low price then go for it!  Otherwise, if the DVD is much cheaper, go for the DVD.

So, this release is definitely for those who found these shorts enjoyable.  I found them hilarious but then again, I'm more open to this type of lewd and naughty type of humor.  For those who are a least bit curious and enjoy ""Family Guy"" and ""American Dad"" and are debating if they should purchase this release, my best advice is for you to check out the videos first on YouTube.com and if you enjoyed them, then this release is definitely for you.",1243468800,3,6496,4.702127659574468

(2)It's not wide screen, it's 4:3.  (3) It's encoded with 7.1 DTS MA.  Guess what, it's realy only stereo.  Now to the cartoon shorts.  Not even a chuckle.  I kept advancing chapters hoping to find something funny.  Nada.  So save your money and let Amazon keep this disk on thier shelves. Shame on you Seth for turning this out with the ""From the creator of Family Guy & American Dad"" as a selling point.  Even the Fox network wouldn't want this.",1243296000,,601,4.184210526315789

3777748,1,B001RP976A,"Summary: They packaged up the Family Guy skits that did not make the grade, and added the F-word. Seth MacFarlane...you owe me ten bucks.

I love Family Guy, and think American Dad is still worth a laugh or two, but these five SHORT episodes were a staggering disappointment. At best, there was enough good material for one episode. The rest of the time, I found myself anticipating the next bit in hopes that it would be more entertaining. For those who think this will be Seth type humor without the constraints of network language and content limitations, be warned, hearing the F word used is not enough to carry an unfunny sketch. And, that's the problem with these episodes. They are just not funny.

My favorite aspect of Family Guy is seeing how far Seth pushes the envelope of bad taste and killer humor. Here we simply get explicit language and situations, but without any intelligent writing or clever jokes. An example, Fred Flintstone trying to get into a modern night club, but getting barred at the door....the premise is not particularly interesting, and the execution fails. Or, a Scottish guy talking to the characters on a TV screen....the equivalent of someone shouting at a character on a movie screen. Seen it before, and adding a Scottish accent does not make it funny. We watched most of the show stone faced, disappointed, and bored.

3777749,4,B001RP976A,"Everybody's complaining about how this wasn't anything like Family Guy, but it isn't supposed to be Family Guy, so buy something else if that's what you're looking for.

The dvd is a collection of funny shorts (54 minutes as the product details says) made by Seth and his crew, most of them quite good in my opinion, and most of them a lot more vulgar and (mildly) shocking than the usual Family Guy episodes.

If you like the edgy parts of Family Guy or animation series like ""Drawn Together"", I'm quite sure you'll enjoy this dvd as well!",1243036800,,540,4.5

I have been a fan of Seth MacFarlane for years, but this DVD is crap! I don't know what he was thinking, but he was out of his mind to release these cartoons.

Out of all the mini-cartoons included, I only ""lightly"" laughed at a few. Most are not funny and have to do with sick and twisted humor about bestiality or inbreed families. I don't know how Seth could think his work included is funny. If I were him, I'd be embarrassed.",1242950400,4,564,4.081081081081081

After about 10 minutes of unfunny, poorly written, timewasting vignettes, I knew I had wasted my money, but forced myself to watch the whole thing so I could write a proper review.

It won't take long to write because it won't take long to describe what's on this DVD: nothing funny or interesting, or even close to the quality of Family Guy or American Dad or the Stewie DVD that came out a few years ago.

This DVD is sparsely populated with what seem like extras that they found on the cutting room floor and decided to put together and put Seth's name on it and trick people into buying it based on his prior reputation.

Well, Seth, I will definitely think twice before I buy any more DVD's that you have attached yourself to in any way.  I literally would feel less stupid if I deposited money into a random bank account and waited for that exiled Nigerian prince to give me the $20 million promised me in an email.",1242864000,55,1072,4.36180904522613

Just the saddest, lamest jokes you can imagine. All the standard subjects that only preteens and frat guys find funny; gay jokes, poop jokes, racism jokes, farting, AIDS, the list goes on and on. This came from the mind of the man who created two of the funniest shows on television? One thing is clear: either someone else actually wrote this, or Seth has almost nothing to do with the writing of Family Guy and American Dad. Oh and the swearing adds absolutely nothing; it's totally forced (as forced as the ""humor"" of the entire video) and feels like they tried to cram as much in there as possible, even when it didn't fit at all. I guess the mind that things anything gay is funny is the same mind that thinks the F word is hilarious. All in all just sad, lame stuff. I really hope Seth just loaned his name and voice to this (and that he got a pile of cash for doing so) because if he wrote this- he's really, truly, completely untalented.",1242777600,8,1096,4.299516908212561

If you love Seth MacFarlane then you will love this.  If you're a prude and can't take a joke about sex, drugs, racism, religion or homosexuality, it's not for you.

The only difference with this compared to Seth MacFarlane's other shows is the amount of vulgarity in this (which I personally thought was hilarious).

To me, watching this reminded me of all of the scenes in Family Guy that cutaway from the main plot for a flashback. If you enjoy those scenes (where a character in Family Guy usually says, ""Remember that time when..."") then you will most likely love this DVD as much as I did.

The only thing is that I wished it was longer (run time is only 54 minutes). In addition I admit some of the scenes are stupid, but there are those that are hilarious so it balances out.

Who cares, its a cartoon anyways right? But in fullscreen format?! Black gaps on the left and right side?! Come on, coulda saved a few bucks and got the DVD! That being said, i watched it. Waited to laugh, and waited, and waited, then chuckled a bit on the Super Mario scene, waited some more, and it ended! To be honest with you i was in awe! I was expecting to cry from laughing, maybe spit out my drink due to the hilarious'ness. Look at it like this, throw a bunch of mediocre skits, throw the F Bomb in it, call it ""uncensored"" take people's 20 dollars with the economy the way it is!

It wasn't funny the first eight times you tried it in Family Guy, it still isn't funny now that you've run out of ideas on Family Guy and repeat these same jokes every episode, (wH , bumped knee, Conway Twitty, really?) but to try and pawn the same material which has already worn itself out in syndication as  'new' product to be sold is offensive to consumers.

The shorts are truly hit or miss.  You're either going to find them funny or you won't.  I got a few good laughs in, but maybe about 45% of the DVD.  If you're a fan of Family Guy or American Dad I would exercise caution before purchasing only because this doesn't trump the two shows, just adds an extension to the legacy Seth MacFarlane has created.  Family Guy fans in particular will notice some of the shorts featured are [uncut] flashback scenes (like the $25000 Pyramid short with the man and the dog, Wily E. Coyote finally killing Roadrunner, and Fred and Barney trying to get into La Deaux nightclub).  I purchased because some of the shorts were featured on the Expedia Internet ads months ago and were pretty funny (like the mad cow short), but I could've honestly borrowed or burned this from someone else or NetFlix.

I expected the same type of zingy high-cultural context humor you get from the little snippet scenes from Family Guy, but this fell short in a big way.  There were many shorts on here that ended with me saying ""huh? Why was that even close to funny??"". I would say of the 50 or so shorts, I thought maybe 5 at the most were pretty funny.  The rest were just either too gross to be funny (and trust me, I love gross humor if it's done...humorously), lazy, or bland.  And why would anybody get a blu-ray disc of this?? They are just simple cartoons! Plus, I couldn't find any hidden easter eggs on here and the extras were really dumb: a still gallery and a short of his red carpet premiere of this release. Hey, I really wonder how the actors at the red carpet reacted to some of this humor? Anyways, I will stay a true Family Guy fan and buy every season DVD release, but I really wish I had rented this one and saved my $15.

I sat through the entire DVD (about 100 or so clips/jokes) and can't recall *one* clip that was truly funny.  It's a mess of a DVD that was apparently made to cash in on Family Guy's popularity.

There are no words to describe how utterly atrocious this thing truly is. Let me get the elephant out of the room; I absolutely HATE, no, LOATHE Seth's abomination known as ""Family Guy."" I think it's as just as ugly and juvenile as adult cartoons can get. This piece of crap is no exception. ""Cavalcade"" is, if not, worse than ""Ted."" I'm not even kidding. I was curious to see what it was about, so, after watching a review of it on YouTube, I decided to see it for myself.

How this man is still working in Hollywood is beyond me. He has the maturity, intelligence and humor of Adam Sandler, who is even worse. All ""Cavalcade"" is, is a mashup of violent, inappropriate and crude jokes to try to get a cheap laugh out of the audience. For example, one of the shorts is a still image of the classic character, Fred Flinstone sitting in a bathroom stall and relieving himself. I'm convinced that Sethy Seth has the mind of a twelve year old. Only college dropouts would find this revolting garbage funny. I only saw a few of these and refused to go through all of them.

Most of the jokes in this mash up consist of, ""Ha, ha! A human's kissing a monkey! Gays are cowards! A mountain climber relieving himself on a wedding! Cannibalism is funny! Scottish accents are funny! Laugh at this! LAUGH AT ALL OF THIS, MORONIC VIEWERS! WE WANT YOU TO LAUGH AT OUR PATHETIC ATTEMPTS AT COMEDY!"" This is exactly the same thing as Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer's horrible comedy movie franchise, and it fails miserably. To think this guy used to work for Cartoon Network...

People, if you had a choice between watching ""Cavalcade of Cartoon Comedy"" and looking at paint drying on the walls, go with the paint. This is, without a doubt, the worst and most abysmal of Seth MacFarlane's creations, yet. The animation sucks, the voice acting is atrocious and the comedy? What comedy? That's all I have to say.
