The Animation seems even more well done than most of the rest of the series and the plot ends in satisfying conclusion. Id prefer not to say any spoilers. But if your a fan at all, i mean ..come on its the end =). But the collecters box is very nice, its made pretty well its not flimsy material in anyway. Im curious what the *limited edition* offered but the box is definately worth it for collectors. Either way..buy this..right now.",1153958400,,507,4.237113402061856
2524386,5,B000ENUKYO,"Volume 7 concludes the spectacular Samurai 7 tv series.

It goes without saying that if you haven't seen the show from the beginning, this isn't the place to start.  Go back and watch this show from the beginning.  I wrote a pretty in-depth review for the first disc if you're interested.

If you've been collecting the show, there's no reason not to get this disc.  However, another version of this dvd exists that comes with a box to fit all 7 volumes.  As a collector who likes his DVDs to look as good on the shelf as on the TV, I would strongly recommend the version with the box as opposed to the version without.",1148947200,8,619,4.339130434782609
8111730,4,B000ENUKYO,"A solid series that allows for the development of each samurai's character and arc, as opposed to Kurasawa's original film that was limited by its medium. The animation is fantastic, with the exception of the CGI, which looked outdated when the show was released. I am sure there is a box set of these now. If you like anime and Akira Kurosawa, buy these.",1384905600,,355,4.5625
8111731,5,B000ENUKYO,"Instead of being ""Disc 7 with collectors box"" I received 7 discs with a collectors box. I don't know if all the sellers are selling the ENTIRE series, I was just looking for the last disc.... No complaints here though! I ended up selling my first 6, haha. 5/5 stars though, everything was in grand condition.",1376179200,,308,4.517857142857143
8111732,4,B000ENUKYO,"The item arrived new in the plactic as expected, but it has a damaged corner that looks as if it was dropped at one point. Still it want damaged to th point that i would have returned it",1348790400,,186,3.9210526315789473
8111733,5,B000ENUKYO,"Based on the original Seven Samurai by Akira Kurosawa, this remarkable series has a great story that builds on each of the characters.  Similar to the original story, the seven are hired by a poor village (with only rice for payment) to defend against barbaric forces.  The people pay the barbarians their produce to keep them from destroying their village.  The Samurai accept their offer but accept only the millet (rice byproduct that the villagers eat) and nobly defend their village.  Everyone must see this fantastic epic.",1217030400,,528,5.0344827586206895
8111734,5,B000ENUKYO,"Not everything about this series was perfect and I never claimed that it was. In the end, I can't say that I was completely happy with how the stories were ended. In particular is one story resolution that the audience is completely robbed from seeing. In the grand scheme of things though, the primary story is wrapped up very well though it does leave the audience with a serious desire to find out what happens next. Universally praised, this is a series that every anime fan will want to see at some point in their lives and one that I would gladly recommend to anyone else looking for something good to watch.",1214092800,,614,4.491071428571429
8111735,4,B000ENUKYO,"I found the Samurai 7 series to be quite the interesting story. The 7th and final disc of this series did not dissapoint. Not only was the story good, but the collectors box it is packaged with makes it a beautiful addition to a collector's shelf.",1168473600,,247,4.391304347826087
8111736,4,B000ENUKYO,"In the final volume of Samurai 7, an anime that had been wandering in soap opera melodrama and Phantom Menace politics, regains the sense of seriousness, risk, and action that made it great. Katsushiro, disgusted with Kambei for backing down from the new Emperor when he had the chance to kill him, has taken it upon himself to protect Kanna Village from the rapidly approaching Capital. As a measure of how his strength and skill has increased, he deflects a bolt of energy from the ship's main cannon...with his sword! Meanwhile, the cavalry is on the way as the other remaining samurai are making their way as fast as they can back to Kanna for a final battle with the always treacherous Ukyo and his now lobotomized Bandit army.

This final volume of Samurai 7 really pulled out all the stops and added an element of risk that had been missing since the big battle against the Bandits at Kanna Village. You just have this intuition that not all of the samurai are going to make it out alive. The human emotions on display here are not of the melodramatic sort that have plagued the last two volumes, but the reflections of honest human souls, whether it's the relationships between Komachi and Kikuchiyo or Kirara and Kambei. The action at times can seem like a big Hollywood production, but with a beauty and meaningfulness that it can never touch. All in all, a tragic and fitting end to a inconsistent but great show.",1158969600,,1424,4.628458498023716
8111737,5,B000ENUKYO,"I have been slowly building my anime collection and there is nothing nicer than fitting all of the volumes into one original-artwork covered box. Having an entire series together feels great, so what better way to show it off than with the collector's box.",1156723200,,256,4.840909090909091
8111738,5,B000ENUKYO,"Samurai 7 has been a wonderful ride. The story has been engaging the whole way and I haven't been disappointed with a single volume. This dvd was no exception. I won't offer any spoilers except to say that the last episode seemed to fall a little flat to me, but not enough to detract from the series as a whole, and it stayed true to  Akira Kurosawa's original 7 Samurai.",1156636800,2,372,4.314285714285714
8111739,5,B000ENUKYO,"I noticed anime shows tend to be categorized within 4 categories: one's that are so popular that even non-anime fans seem to know about it(Sailor Moon, Dragon Ball Z, Evangelion); ones that are popular but mainly in anime fan land(Elfen Lied, Vision of Escaflowne, Hellsing); ones that aren't that popular but do have their fans (Tactics, Gungrave, Texhnolyze) while others are just simply awful and nobody should ever watch them (fill in whatever terrible show you can think of). Samurai 7 to me is a popular show but it's maybe not as massive(or well-liked at times).

Here we are: the final battle. Ukyo has sent the Capital, a massive airship and hundreds of bandits against Kanna Village, leaving Kikuchiyo, Katsushiro, Kanbei, Kyuzo, Heihachi and Shichiroji as well as the village itself to fight and win. Not everybody will make it back home though.

Watching the ending to Samurai 7, I got the feeling that the show wasn't a mistake to start watching, yet at the same you're like ""well, wasn't as good as I thought it would."" The last volume that was really great was volume 4 which now remains my favorite after watching this one. Keep in mind this is the finale so everything is over-the top. Samurai take down huge Nobuseri with one swipe(or about 10) and jump to the next one so you kind of feel like ""as if"". However it is great action and the CGI really comes into its own here.

It's slight but where it falls flat is where it handles the characters. Throughout the entire show, the samurai never really got any development. Kanbei's the grump, Kyuzo is the silent bad***, Kikuchiyo's the big loud one and that's it. The only one that really gets the slightest development is Katsushiro. Maybe it's the character or maybe I'm a sucker for them but I quite liked Komachi, the high-pitched sister of Kirara.

Another disappoint was one particular character's death. While the order might've changed, the same 4 I believe don't survive the final battle and while 2 have pretty good deaths, one of them was so cheap and bad it was like ""they killed them off that way? That's so stupid!"" It was incredibly disappointing, especially the way they handle the resolution of the character's main focus throughout the whole series.

The series is definately worth a watch and maybe it's just me but it probably won't be held in high regard like other shows but maybe you'll like it, who knows.",1154304000,2,2397,4.72488038277512
