8707231,5,B00UKO5ER0,"Never knew. The host of the prime time game show ""Boom"" did stand up comedy! He's a talented guy and this really shows it! Funny as hell for a pretty cheap price! Cheaper than you can download it from. ITunes! And you get the disk! Would highly recommend!!! All Day Long!!!",1445904000,2,273,4.372549019607843
8707232,2,B00UKO5ER0,"Not great Papa. Looks like an old show unearthed. Showgirls adds nice, smarmy touch. Newer stuff is probably funnier. Can't tell you why someone of his comedy caliber is hosting Boom!, however.",1436918400,,193,5.0625
8707233,5,B00UKO5ER0,This guy is a pleasure to watch and listen to.  He knows his stuff and commands the stage with confidence and grace.  His humor is tight and real.  He is not mean or crass...And that is rare in comedy today.  He is a grown-up and acts like one.  I will buy his acts to share with family and friends.  I love giving DVD s like this one to people who need some funny in their lives.....better than a dumb greeting card.  I wish this comic a long and successful career.  It would really be cool to see tom papa work with Jim gaffigan.....in any  venue.......that would be cool.,1429228800,4,574,4.2407407407407405
