7337426,5,B011MHBHPG,"This may just be my favorite Bond movie, and with my favorite portrayal of the character.  This is a well-paced spy movie, with plenty of action and a nice music score by the late Michael Kamen (Lethal Weapon 1 - 4, Die Hard 1 - 3, The Iron Giant).  The acting is nice, and the characters are all interesting.  Bond's main love interest, Pam Bovier (Carey Lowell), is one of the most capable Bond Girls I've ever seen, especially since she rescues Bond (Timothy Dalton) from danger more times than he rescues her!  The movie's villain, Franz Sanchez , played by Robert Davi, is excellent and intimidating, with him being a Colombian drug lord adding a sense of authenticity that is missing from a lot of other villains in the franchise.

The Blu-Ray itself has an excellent video transfer, with near-flawless audio, and a wealth of bonus features, including audio commentaries, behind-the-scenes featurettes and a 30-minute documentary on the film, as well as trailers, dossiers on the characters, image galleries, and so on.  It really is the ultimate edition of the film, and what's better is that the cut of the film on the disc is the original cut that had originally been rated R by the MPAA, although by today's standard's the film is rather tame and really only warrants the PG-13 rating that it received after being resubmitted, despite the gruesome nature of the more violent deaths in the film, i.e. explosive decompression and death by industrial shredder.

All in all, Licence To Kill is one of the better Bond movies, and this Blu-Ray is an excellent addition to any fan's collection.",1473206400,,1597,4.806569343065694
7337427,4,B011MHBHPG,"No James Bond movie will qualify as great art, but Timothy Dalton's rendition of the master spy is humanizing and appealing.  If you're a Sean Connery die-hard, you may hate this; otherwise, it's no worse than any other version of the series.",1465689600,,242,4.761904761904762

8724648,5,B011MHBHPG,"When Dalton first came on the scene he made 2 of the most underrated Bond films. He wasn't Moore and everyone wanted Pierce, myself included. But this film, you get an edgier Bond, still with the one liners but darker. His portrayal is a precursor to the Daniel Craig bond. I can't even watch any of the Brosnan Bond films anymore, they are all so campy. Get this and The Living Daylights, which also has a great theme song by A-ha. Also this movie was released the summer of 1989 which was a huge year for movies, you had Batman, the third Raiders, the final Back to the Future, a lot of competition to helped stall the franchise for 6 years.",1502150400,,643,4.322314049586777

8724651,4,B011MHBHPG,"Until recently, I had never seen a 1980s...and thus, Timolthy Dalton James Bond film. Hence, I had always thought of Pierce Brosnan as the 'quintessential James Bond.' I now believe that Timothy Dalton is instead the 'quintessential' James Bond -exactly what James Bond should look like and talk like, etc. It's too bad he only starred in two Bond films. He probably was just starting to either find...or better yet had fully found his 'niche' as James Bond. Dalton doesn't seem nearly as 'talkative' as Brosnan or having much of a sense of humor...but he does seem to have a more true, sincere silent sincerity, more dangerous perhaps and confident...and more intelligent as well.

The first Timothy Dalton Bond movie I didn't finish watching -it was too uninteresting and Christopher Walken and his black female sidekick were very pathetic and unimpressive villains.
This 2nd and last Dalton flic -Licence to Kill- seemed a lot more plausible -though perhaps somewhat too long, and somewhat uninteresting/unintelligible at times. Also, there doesn't seem to much as much 'imagination' and 'techno-gadget-wizardry' and inventions in the Bonds movies of the late 80s compared to the '70s. However, a number of action sequences and stunts were very good -esp. towards the end of the movie.

4 out of 5 stars.",1481673600,,1307,5.102803738317757
