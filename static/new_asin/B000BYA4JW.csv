54. Mama's Baby, Carlton's Maybe

Philip refuses to believe that the baby is his grandchild until a blood test proves it; Vivian reprimands Cindy for not coming to them for advice. Will, however, suspects that the inexperienced Carlton never had a chance to father a baby. Determined to accept his responsibility, Carlton elopes with Cindy to a small-town chapel. While waiting for the preacher to marry them, they realize that they're too young and too incompatible to spend the rest of their lives together. When Will arrives at the chapel to stop the ceremony, he learns that Cindy has confessed that Carlton wasn't the baby's father and called her parents to take her home, leaving Carlton bewildered and heartbroken. Carlton meekly confesses to Will that he's still a virgin, but was willing to marry Cindy, hoping that someday she'd learn to love him in return.

Will's mother tells Will that she's broken her engagement to Robert and eagerly awaits her son's graduation so they can return to Philadelphia together.

Chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool
And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school

2446059,5,B000BYA4JW,"This Third Season of ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"" finds Will getting off on the wrong foot with Phil & Vivian in the season opener ""How I Spent My Summer Vacation"". Will's returned from his summer vacation in Philly with a new look & demeanor that doesn't bode well with Uncle Phil. In ""Here Comes The Judge"", Will gets arrested for getting numerous outstanding parking tickets, & Phil hires an ex-convict under Will's recommendation in ""Robbing The Banks"", & soon comes to regret it. Will & Carlton have a run-in with guest-star Riddick Bowe in ""You Bet Your Life"" when their car breaks down en route to Las Vegas, while Carlton is depressed about not getting accepted into Princeton, so his guardian angel in the form of guest-star Tom Jones shows up in the episode ""The Alma Matter"". Will & Carlton play a prank on Geoffrey via a fake lottery ticket in ""Winner Takes Off"", & Vivian has a baby in ""Bundle of Joy"" - where everyone seems to be delighted except Ashley. Carlton's former girlfriend visits him with a surprise, a baby daughter, in ""Mama's Baby Carlton's Maybe"" - featuring guest-star Lark Voorhies (""Saved by the Bell""). A girl at school showers Will with expensive gifts in ""P.S., I Love You"". Phil goes up against his former mentor Judge Robertson (played by Sherman Hemsley) in the same episode. The Bankses are invited to appear on the Oprah Winfrey Show in ""A Night At The Oprah"" - except Will that is. Phil loses to Judge Robertson in the election in ""Asses To Ashes"". As you can see, there are plenty of hilarious & dramatic moments during this Third Season of ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"". There would be one major cast change after this season - Janet Hubert-Whitten would leave at season's end & was replaced by Daphne Maxwell-Reid in the role of Vivian the following season.

2446085,5,B000BYA4JW,"Season 3 marks the end of an era for The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air.  After three solid years as a main cast member, Janet Hubert-Whitten takes her final bow as Vivian Banks before show business politics overruled, resulting in her being sadly let go from her role by the producers.  That unfortunate reality aside, Season 3 provides just as much humor, warmth, positivity, seriousness, and family values as Seasons 1 and 2.  All the characters maintain their charm and wit from the first to the last episode.

Highlights of this season include ""A Night At The Oprah"" (that episode will have you howling with the laughter from the opening fade-in to the closing blooper reel); ""Mommy Nearest"" (the quote by Will's aunt on his mom's side of the family upon seeing her other sister and her Caucasian brother-in-law getting on so well as a married couple, 'That's it, I'm gettin' me a White man!' is worth the full 23 minutes alone); ""Winner Takes Off"" (Geoffrey wins the lottery and sticks it to the spoiled Banks Family under whom he works [Geoffrey's character gets more sarcastic during Season 3--increasing his/Joseph Marcell's comedic grace]); ""The Baby Comes Out"" (probably the most intensely dramatic episode in the entire series [Janet Hubert-Whitten's real-life pregnancy during the filming of Season 3 was an underlying premise for the show that year]); ""The Alma Matter"" (Will exercises his academic expertise [a la Bel-Air Prep Academy] to unwittingly gain acceptance into Princeton University, much to Carlton's dismay--as he doesn't even get his foot in the door, literally).

Quite honestly, there are too many great episodes to describe here.  But the aforementioned definitely rank among the Top 10!  And Season 3 ranks among the best years of The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air.  As Will and Carlton look ahead to their academic future, Uncle Phil runs for Superior Court Judge, Hilary gets a new job as a weather reporter and meets her soon-to-be ill-fated fiancee, Trevor, Ashley dives deeper into the world of adolescence, Vivian gives birth to her fourth child on the show, Jeffrey makes due with his lackluster life, the Banks household falls nowhere short of hilarity, pleasure, and depth.  If you're looking for more of the classic era of The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air, be sure to check out Season 3.  Thou shalt not be disappointed!!!!!!!!",1339891200,,2351,5.020565552699229
2446086,5,B000BYA4JW,"Season three marks the midway point for all six season of the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air run on television.  Three seasons down and the Uncle Phil fat jokes still aren't old!  This season focuses heavily on the kids of the family.  Hilary, Carlton, Ashley, and of course Will.  Will and Carlton are seniors in high school and thinking about where they are going to head off to college.  Bel-Air Prep has gone co-ed meaning that Ashley is now amongst the boys and striving not only to get noticed by her female peers, but by her male ones as well.  Hilary is urged to move out and to find a job.  All of them are struggling to find themselves and to figure out what they want in life.

Although the focus is on the kids, there is still a heavy influence of humor coming from familial struggles and the ever-present social views of African Americans in our society.  Even though this was written and performed in the 90s, most of the material is still relevant to today's adults, teenagers, and the families they come from.

My one dislike are two episodes farther on in this season that are nearly on top of each other that are basically filler segments with many flashbacks.  To have one per season is fine, but to have two is overdoing it just a little.  Other than that, the humor is fantastic, the issues are relevant to today's world, and it's a joy to watch.",1331078400,,1360,4.439516129032258

Disc 1, 2 & 3 were scratched up so bad it looked like someone took a knife & slashed them up! Disc 4 skipped the whole way through and only showed the episodes The way we were and Six Degrees of Graduation. I was so angry that this seller claimed the dvds were brand new. No way!

Will makes you laugh, he makes you cry, and he makes you think. His counterparts only add to the greatness of the show. That's right, the entire cast has talent and it is seen! This season, Will makes a girl thinks he has married her, just so he will sleep with her, Hilary becomes a television personality and her ego gets even bigger, Aunt Vivian is pregnant and Carolton does drugs at the prom. This season is memorable, as is the entire series of ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"". Everyone will enjoy this DVD, whether you are alone or with a room full of people.

2446154,5,B000BYA4JW,"Hi there! I just finished watching the third season of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air and was very pleased. The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air made its debut in the early 90's and it's easy to see how times have changed since then, yet many of the issues and jokes in the show are still funny and fresh(how convenient). Without ruining the season for you, the highlights of this season include Philip Banks's run for political office, Hilary's finding of a job(for longer than a day!), and Vivian's pregnancy. The season is full of funny moments; no less than the previous seasons, and there are also many familiar faces that show up as guests, including ""Mr. Jefferson"", Oprah Winfrey, and D. L. Hughley. The most amazing thing about these season DVDs are that they have a great price (I bought mine at Best Buy for $21 plus tax, and the price on Amazon is around that too); not like DVD sets like Friends or CSI (still great shows though!). If you were pleased with the first two seasons this will not disappoint, and for those who have never watched the Fresh Prince it's such a good show that it's not hard to catch on even if you don't watch the seasons in numerical order.

The only thing I am not impressed with is this season's (or last season's) special features. The special features include a ""documentary"" kind of thing with some tidbits on the actors/guests as highlights from all three seasons are shown, and a blooper reel. Some of the bloopers on the reel are really funny, yet the only problem with it is that it shows the SAME bloopers that are shown during the credits of many of the episodes. Chances are that you will watch the special features after watching most of the episodes, and have already seen the bloopers. I suppose it makes for a nice way to get a laugh at the bloopers in one sitting (most of the individual bloopers last for less than half a minute and most of the episodes had an individual blooper during the credits), but it would be nice if you could see some bloopers that were never previously shown instead of getting a second laugh at the same bloopers.

Overall, great season but less than mediocre special features.

5/5 Season overall

2/5 Special Features.

Stay Fresh!",1140393600,6,2207,4.563131313131313
2446155,5,B000BYA4JW,"NBC's The Fresh Prince Of Bel Air began its third season in September 1992. Fans of NBC sitcoms no longer had The Cosby Show to watch except on independent stations that syndicate it. They also had one more season of Cheers to watch also. They also at least saw the premiere episode of Mad About You. And of course,they had TFPOBA. TFPOBA star Will Smith just finished filming the Warner Bros. comedy MADE IN AMERICA(his debut) with Cheers star Ted Danson and Whoopi Goldberg. Smith,also a rapper,continued recording albums throughout the series with his partner ""D.J. Jazzy Jeff"" Townes. After this season,TFPOBA continued for three more seasons and then,Smith personally pulled the plug on the series to concentrate on his film career which is still going strong today. Also,there would be no more schedule conflict amongst the series and the films. Some of the episodes were directed by Debbie Allen. Allen,a singer and actress also,previously worked for NBC,starring on the drama Fame,inspired by the 1980 MGM/UA musical film which she also appeared in.

8094081,4,B000BYA4JW,"I went to Barnes and Nobles, and I saw this 3rd season of Fresh Prince of Bel-Air on the DVD set for $10.00, so I bought it. And I even bought it as a birthday gift, because my birthday is next month in February on the 26th and I bought it as a gift to myself, so I know I'll enjoy watching it. I also bought the first two seasons of Fresh Prince of Bel-Air on both DVD sets off the ebay website as an early birthday gift to myself, so now I'll even have three seasons to watch all together.

This 3rd season of Fresh Prince of Bel-Air is the last season with Janet Hubert playing the original (Aunt Vivian). I noticed that this show Fresh Prince of Bel-Air came out with six seasons, but I would let this 3rd season be the last season I would watch, because this 3rd season and the first two seasons are the only seasons that has Janet Hubert-Whitten playing the original (Aunt Vivian). I read something on the internet saying that Janet Hubert-Whitten was fired from the show, because her and Will Smith had difficulties working together, which means they didn't get along on the show. The 4th, 5th, and 6th season of Fresh Prince of Bel-Air then had Daphne Maxwell-Reid playing (Aunt Vivian), and I don't think that I would want to see her play (Aunt Vivian). I really don't like when they replace characters on a show when the original character leaves, because the new character may not act the same or be as good as the original, especially a new character with a different facial feature. And Daphne Maxwell-Reid looks nothing like Janet Hubert-Whitten. That's also what happened on the show Family Matters, another good show that's my all-time favorite with actor Jaleel White playing (Steve Urkel). That show right there came out with nine seasons, and the 9th season of that show then had a new and different actress playing the mom as (Harriette). Out of 22 episodes from the 9th season of that show, the first set of episodes did have the original actress playing the mom as (Harriette), and then she left from being on that show. And the last nine episodes out of 22 from the 9th season of that show then had a new actress playing the mom as (Harriette), but was not as good as the original. And I don't like to watch the 9th season of that show for that reason, because I like the original mom as (Harriette) alot better, and she was in all the nine seasons. The original mom as (Harriette) from all the nine seasons of that show Family Matters is Jo Marie Payton, and the new actress as (Harriette) in the last nine episodes from the 9th season out of 22 is Judyann Elder. And I did not like Judyann Elder as (Harriette) on that show. Jo Marie Payton was the better the mom as (Harriette) and had more character on that show, and I would watch that show Family Matters just from seasons 1-8 with not only Jo Marie Payton, but also with Jaleel White and all the other main characters, out of all the nine seasons. And Jo Marie Payton is one of my favorite characters on that show. That's also another good show I even have on the DVD sets, but only the first eight seasons, and the 9th season is the very last season I don't have and would do without watching.

So the same way I feel about watching that show Family Matters just from seasons 1-8 with Jo Marie Payton playing the original the mom as (Harriette), same way I feel about watching this show Fresh Prince of Bel-Air just from the first two seasons and from this 3rd season with Janet Hubert-Whitten playing the original (Aunt Vivian). And I think that it would be good enough for me to just have and watch the first two seasons and this 3rd season of Fresh Prince of Bel-Air on the DVD sets, and it's OK if I don't see or watch any episodes from the 4th, 5th, or 6th season that I wouldn't have to watch. And those last three seasons right there is what I would do without watching, so I wouldn't buy or get them to watch on the DVD sets. Fresh Prince of Bel-Air is not really my favorite show anyway, but I still like the show with Will Smith as the main character, though. And I'll still watch the show just from the first two seasons and from this 3rd season with Janet Hubert-Whitten playing the original (Aunt Vivian), so to always know and remember her as the better (Aunt Vivian), even though she was fired from the show.

I was also reading something on the internet about which (Aunt Vivian) was better on this show Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, and it said that Janet Hubert-Whitten was the better (Aunt Vivian) than Daphne Maxwell-Reid was. And I think that it's good to know that Janet Hubert-Whitten was the better (Aunt Vivian) on the show. And again I still do like Will Smith as the main character of the whole show, though.

Now let me just say that this show Fresh Prince of Bel-Air is a good show with Will Smith. I remember back when was I was a kid, I started to see this show come on the TV channel, and I thought it was a good show with Will Smith. And I do find Will Smith is a good actor from this show, and in rated movies to. But with me reading something on the internet about Daphne Maxwell-Reid playing the 2nd (Aunt Vivian), it doesn't sound like I would enjoy watching the 4th, 5th, or 6th season of Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. So the first two seasons and this 3rd season is what I'll just have and stick with watching on the DVD sets. And I think that instead of having a new character on a show when the original character leaves, it's better to just write them out or maybe just talk about them like they still exist on the show.",1515196800,,5533,4.337837837837838

Seeing Will Smith that young took me back to my childhood and once i was there id forgotten how much laughter id had at the expense of Carlton dancing to Tom Jones and Uncle Phil scolding the boys. I love it. the first 4 seasons are the shows heart and soul i think.,1495238400,,290,4.105263157894737
