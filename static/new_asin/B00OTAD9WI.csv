6760231,5,B00OTAD9WI,"Michael Shayne is an Irish wise-cracking private detective created by Brett Halliday and played by Lloyd Nolan in a series of movies from the 30's/40's era. There is a good murder mystery, some good detecting and usually some good co-stars. This one, besides Nolan, stars Marjorie Weaver, a familiar B-list heroine who plays (what else) a newspaper reporter, and Phil Silvers, who became an A-list comedian on television in the  'golden age' of funny men. For those of us who hate the darkness of 'film noir' comes a mystery with more humor and common sense than the depression and navel-gazing of the post-war era. Other Shayne DVD's  are the Michael Shayne Collection (Vol. 1) and Dressed to Kill which has the added attractions of Mary Beth Hughes and William Demarest.",1422576000,10,772,4.930769230769231

6760233,5,B00OTAD9WI,"I had all of the other Michael Shayne movies with Lloyd Nolan, but not this one.  I was thrilled to be able to purchase it from Amazon.  As usual, Lloyd Nolan playing the part of a private detective has many things happen to him while he is solving a murder mystery.  I enjoy all of the older movies and would recommend it to anyone else who also does.",1420243200,10,352,4.147058823529412
6760234,5,B00OTAD9WI,Very good if you like the genre. Nolan is the best Shayne period. Very good transfer with sterling B&W detail and very good sound.,1420070400,6,130,4.458333333333333
6760235,5,B00OTAD9WI,I really like Lloyd Noland as the Private Eye.  His series are very enjoyable.  I like the lightness he brings to mysteries.  Nothing scarey here.  Just enjoyment,1419552000,5,162,4.888888888888889
6760236,3,B00OTAD9WI,"One of several Michael Shayne movies available on dvd.  This one has sub-standard picture quality--very grainy in places.  No dvd exras.  Recorded in dvd-r format.  In my opinion, it's the weakest plot of the Lloyd Nolan ""Michael Shayne"" series.",1452297600,,245,5.205128205128205
6760237,4,B00OTAD9WI,"In Just Off Broadway , Private Detective Michael Shayne is serving on a jury. He becomes convinced the defendant is innocent, so he votes not guilty and debates it in the jury room.

Actually, thats what he would do in a rational world. Instead, Shayne conceals evidence from the police, gets a sleeping draft from the sheriff, and uses it to drug his roommate so he can escape a hotel room where he is sequestered with the rest of the jury and sets off on a madcap night of investigation to find the real killer.

The story works well as a Comedy Mystery, particularly as its an early film for Phil Silvers, who the first television generation would come to know as Sergeant Bilko. His role is relatively small but he plays it to the hilt. Nolans Shayne is very fun and charming. Majorie Weaver is solid if not outstanding as the female lead.

The quality of the restoration is very nice and probably better than most films in the series that have released, and the physical disk itself has a very elegant look. However, this comes at a cost. It is more than a bit expensive for a sixty-five minute B-movie even with the better quality.

It is far from the best movie in the series, but its still an enjoyable hour despite the fact that Shayne isn't given a shred of motivation for his illegal actions. However, I liked the end, which, after so much absurdity, offers a realistic ending in a very funny way.",1449792000,2,1408,4.466926070038911

6760240,5,B00OTAD9WI,"Who doesn't love these Classic movies.  Very crisp and clear copy... just like you'd see it in the movie theater.  Lloyd Nolan is fantastic and carries the film very well.... all the way through.  You can't beat the plots and the ""edge-of-your-seat"" action scenes.",1442620800,2,264,4.954545454545454

6760243,5,B00OTAD9WI,"An extremely entertaining, fast-paced comedy/mystery, with Lloyd Nolan appearing for the sixth time as private eye Mike Shayne.  Nolan, who always turned in good performances, is perfect as the not-quite hard-boiled detective who gets bored being a juror in a murder trial and decides to solve the crime himself.

Forget about whether the plotline is farfetched.  Don't look for pretentious messages.  Just sit back and enjoy a fine little B-movie.",1435536000,,448,5.357142857142857
6760244,5,B00OTAD9WI,Fun Mike Shayne flick.  Quick delivery,1433116800,,38,5.333333333333333
6760245,4,B00OTAD9WI,"Lloyd Nolan sure didn't have them typical Hollywood leading man looks. But he had a quiet swagger about him whenever he played the role of B-movie crime solver Michael Shayne, to the tune of seven pictures, courtesy of Twentieth Centure Fox. Of these, Just Off Broadway (1942) is the sixth. Ain't so much to separate Michael Shayne from them other tough-as-nails gumshoes on cinema. Like Bulldog Drummond, like the Saint and the Falcon, Boston Blackie, and even Perry Mason, Shayne is a loose cannon who plays by his own rules. Often, he elects to thumb his nose at the local constabulary who are typically these clueless bumbleheads. It's all clichd stuff, and yet Nolan, deadpan and cocksure, makes it work.

Just Off Broadway threw a curve with its plot resolution, and that surprised me. I was anticipating a mundane, routine, by-the-numbers murder mystery. It opens with professional keyhole snooper, Michael Shayne, caught in an unexpected sitch: He's on jury duty, his panel having been convened for the trial of a society girl accused of dusting off her fianc. The past two weeks of jury duty have dragged for Shayne, so imagine his perking up when a key witness, mid-testimony, is slain sensationally in the courtroom. So there's Shayne, percolating and deciding to take matters into his own hands. That very night, he escapes the sequestered confines of his hotel room. And he's off, chasing leads, getting into sped-up brawls, reluctantly partnering up with a nosy gal reporter (Marjorie Weaver), and trying awfully hard to avoid getting his photo into the paper. There's no end of suspects; lots are harboring a secret. The blonde canary at the Dolphin Club? The exotic vaudeville knife thrower? The shady club owner? The butler who may've faked an alibi? Well, no, scratch the butler...

Running time is just a smidge over an hour, so it moves fast. It isn't shy with the comic touches, with Phil Silver's freelance photog as the least droll element. But I smiled at everything else, because Shayne and his cute reporter do get into some funny scrapes. One of the best bits is the elevator sequence as Shayne scrambles to get back to his room before the fast approaching cop detective can conduct a bed check. Nolan effortlessly pulls off the deadpan humor. I even got a kick that Shayne relentlessly mooches off his annoyed girlfriend. The movie plays fast and loose with courtroom decorum. Even back in the day, I'm pretty sure you can't just get up from the jury and take over the presenting of evidence and the grilling of witnesses on the stand. I guess, in the end, it all works out okay. The crime is solved, the perpetrator is nabbed, and Michael Shayne, jury member who snuck out during the night, gets what's coming to him. The ending had me belly laughing. 3.5 out of 5 stars for this quick, fun diversion.",1432425600,3,2830,4.820987654320987

8684741,5,B00OTAD9WI,"If you like these old B-movies, especially detective movies, don't miss this one. Lloyd Nolan as Michael Shayne is not the hard-boiled type, but rather the wise-cracking type of detective. This movie is in pristine condition but the DVD does not include any extras. It is one of seven Michael Shayne movies with Nolan.
The plot in this one is pretty novel as a witness is murdered IN COURT and Shayne is a sequestered juror who nonetheless dives into the case. Like all the Shayne movies, this one is a lot of fun.",1519257600,,514,4.537634408602151

8684743,5,B00OTAD9WI,Great move. Fun to watch,1484697600,,24,4.0
8684744,4,B00OTAD9WI,"""Just off Broadway"" clocks in at one hour and five minutes.  So the plot moves along quickly... which is good.  Nolan's performance as detective Shayne is always fun to watch.  The plot gets a bit convoluted and some of the story is improbable even if not impossible.  But it's all in good fun and if the purpose is entertainment (which it is), then there's no real cause for complaint.  No regrets here; I'm happy with the purchase.",1475020800,,433,4.571428571428571
8684745,5,B00OTAD9WI,"I have a fantasy where the major studios take great care to release their old movies on DVD (even B-Movies).
The dream started to come true back in 2007 when Fox Home Video released the ""Michael Shayne Mystery Collection, Volume One"".
But it was not to be.
There never was a Volume Two.
Instead Fox released the remaining three films starring Lloyd Nolan in dribs and drabs.
The situation is even worse with the five Hugh Beaumont films - only one is available on DVD.

LLOYD NOLAN AS MICHAEL SHAYNE:
1940: Michael Shayne, Private Detective *
1941: Sleepers West *
1941: Dressed to Kill **
1942: Blue, White and Perfect *
1942: The Man Who Wouldn't Die *
1942: Just Off Broadway ***
1942: Time to Kill ****

Back in 2007, four of the seven films were packaged in a two DVD boxed set.
All films had subtitles, and the box included several interesting featurettes about Michael Shayne.
I have been patiently waiting for Volume Two, but it is not to be.
Instead we have had to buy individual DVDs of:

not to be confused with the 1946 Sherlock Holmes movie of the same title
*** ""Just Off Broadway"" (DVD-R, no subtitles) REVIEWED ON THIS PAGE

**** ""Time to Kill"" has not been released yet, though Amazon has assigned a stock index number to it:
ASIN: B005QCH5MI
Apparently it will be a DVD-R without subtitles.
Under ""DVDs & Movies"", type ""Time to Kill 1942"" on the  Amazon search bar.
""Time to Kill"" may be the most interesting film in the series.
It was adapted from a Raymond Chandler Philip Marlowe novel (""The High Window""), two years before Marlowe debuted on film under his own name (in ""Murder My Sweet"", 1944)
Hard to believe, but in the 1940s, author Brett Halliday outsold Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett as a writer of detective fiction.
Wise-cracking Private Eye Michael Shayne was featured in 69 novels published between 1939 and 1977.

The seven Lloyd Nolan movies were produced by Twentieth Century Fox's B-Movie division
The Fox series ended in 1942, but four years later it was revived by PRC (Producers Releasing Corporation) for a series of five films with Hugh Beaumont (better known as Beaver Cleaver's father).
PRC was strictly Poverty Row.
Even Monogram looked down on PRC.
The Lloyd Nolan movies are great fun, and even the Hugh Beaumont PRC films are not without their charms.
You just have to like B-Movies.

8684748,5,B00OTAD9WI,"Lloyd Nolan was the best ""Michael Shayne"" in the movies. Time really does tell, as so many of the ""B"" movies from the late 1930's to early 1950's have worn a LOT better than the award-winning ""A"" list from the same period of time. The reasons for this I see are that the ""B"" detective mysteries had good writing with snappy dialogue, great casting and direction, and just plainly more FUN to watch.
