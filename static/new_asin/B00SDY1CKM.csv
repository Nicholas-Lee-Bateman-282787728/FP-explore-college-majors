8698199,2,B00SDY1CKM,"I'm in my late 60's and beginning to notice I'm not as steady on my feet as previously.  I thought a few exercises would help.  I put in this DVD and was surprised that the exercises started off using a ball, then an exercise band and finally some kind of wand (stick).  I had none of those things and didn't know it was required.  Now I will need to purchase those items if I want to do the video as recommended.  Secondly, it's very short.  I don't feel it's worth the money I paid.  Very disappointed.",1469664000,,504,4.1875
