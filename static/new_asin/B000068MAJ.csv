1725273,3,B000068MAJ,"I bought this video after reading an article about yoga.  As a beginner, this video was just too boring for me.  Instead, I highly recommend Bryan Kest Power Yoga Box Set.",1045612800,,171,4.483870967741935
1725274,5,B000068MAJ,"I take Yoga classes and sometimes find myself wondering if I'm practicing the proper form when I try the techniques at home. This video was very helpful in covering the basic postures and it carefully details the appropriate alignment of the body. There are 2 instructors working together (one demonstrates the technique while the other explains it a little more).  It's not very long and involved so it's perfect if you want a quick warm-up or a quick, simple refresher.",985737600,11,471,4.8875
1725275,5,B000068MAJ,"This video is great for yoga beginners. I have been interested in yoga for years but never acted on it, and when my fiance bought this and we popped it in the VCR, we were hooked!
It has two 20 minute sessions which is a great time frame to squeeze in before work and before going to bed. We now do it everyday and can really tell a difference in our increased flexibility and calmer frame of mind. I found myself sitting up straighter, walking taller, and bending in a safer way. Yoga makes you very aware of your body and what you can do, and this tape is a great way to embark on that journey.",982108800,23,596,4.102564102564102

7964258,4,B000068MAJ,"I'm a fan of the Yoga Zone DVDs in general.  This particular one is appropriately named ""Yoga Basics.""  This is an excellent DVD for someone entirely new to DVD or someone new and wanting to be more thoroughly grounded in the basics (down dog, up dog, cat/cow, mountain pose, cobra, and a few others).

It contains two 20-minute practices, one led on a beach by Michelle, and one led in a garden by Al. Both instructors are in each segment. Both instructors walk the viewer through everything.  An experienced yogi might get bored with all the talk, but someone new to yoga will find it very helpful.

Although I'm an intermediate yoga practitioner, I like the Yoga Zone DVDs because 1) the outdoor scenery 2) the excellent cuing 3) the practices are nicely sequenced 4) 20-minute segments 5) no dread factor

What surprised me about this DVD is how loose my body got after just a 20-minute practice. The sequencing and holds are really well done.

The first segment has a two-minute savasana. The second segment ends with a sitting pose and a mudra.  The first segment includes an emphasis on how to do Ujjayi breathing, which is often overlooked in so many DVDs.  For a beginner, proper breathing is so important.  The second segment focuses more on the mind-body connection. However, both segments emphasize that the viewer listen to his/her body - that yoga isn't about being aggressive or a competition.

Music is important to me, and the music in both segments is light,unobtrusive and very nice.  This was filmed in Jamaica, and I could hear the steel drums in one of the segments, and they added a nice touch.

The Yoga Zone DVDs are wonderful for a home practice, for someone new to yoga, for someone returning to yoga after an injury, someone short on time or someone seeking to try yoga for the first time.",1384128000,2,1817,4.676100628930818
7964259,5,B000068MAJ,"I've been on a yoga hunt...

I really enjoy two things in the realm of exercise: yoga and tennis (I almost forgot pilates reformer).

My local studio has some of the best yoga instructors, all different personalities, all different strengths, all different insights.  The only thing is that I am not always available or always a devoted enough yogi to drive myself to this awesome studio.  So I decided it was time to find some yoga DVDs that will inspire me and work me out like my favorite studio does.  I think I've been on a more than 3 year search.  The DVDs I've tried:

Seanne Corn
Shiva Rhea
Gurmuk
Denise Austin (Fat Blastin Yoga and her other Yoga DVD)
Trudie (Sting's wife)
CoreFusion
Booty Ballet Yoga
Anna and Ravi
(sorry if I mutilated names)

The list goes on.  All of the instructors have their pros and cons but in general I find that a lot of them do not do the appropriate poses for warming up the body... with the exception of Anna and Ravi and Gurmuk (both Kundalini yoga).

Then, after having two auto accidents my back/neck said ""no way"" to Denise Austin and even to Kundalini yoga as there's a lot of spinal twists involved.  Which was a downer because Kundalini, I find to be an amazing practice with some great results physiologically and with physique.  Yoga Zone tops them all (all of the ones that I've listed).  I actually ordered a few box set of Yoga Zone DVDs, but I am only going to review each individual DVD in the set instead.

Yoga Zone has a few beginner DVDs and I while being impatient waiting for my order to arrive, I had bought Yoga Zone's For Beginners Only that is an Introduction and Meditation set.  I found this to be a great intro into yoga but everything is a little bit on the slow side.  It goes into the breathing a little more indepth and because you're holding the poses/asanas for a long time.. it can be fatiguing to not only watch but do.  However, the Meditation DVD to this is unbelievable.  I at times suffer from insomnia and the meditation I did with the DVD had clonked me out. Its all about deep breathing.

Anyway, I prefer the Yoga Basics over the For Beginners only Introduction and Meditation for a daily workout as its only 20 minutes long for each of the two segments that come on this DVD and you're not holding the poses for eternity.

Other reviewers have complained about the first instructors instructions.  Compare to all of the other yoga DVDs that I've listed (minus the Kundalini yoga DVDs that tend to in general offer better guidance) she's a very effective instructor in explaining the basics.  Both instructors on this DVD are wonderful.

The beauty about Yoga Zone DVDs is that they teach you about proper yoga breathing which many classes and DVDs will not.  Just learning the proper breathing has significantly helped by:

1) Reducing pain during the session and after the session
2) Allowing for me to adequately get more involved and deeper into the movements
3) I've noticed better results (abs, legs, etc.)
4) The breathing has taught me how to keep my body engaged at all times during the exercise, and even all times of the day... so its helping to reduce back pain.
5) They go through the poses one-by-one, inch-by-inch, breath-by-breath so that you are in proper form and won't injure yourself more. So its a great reference guide for advance yogis who need reminding on how to make their moves simple and graceful

I LOVE this series of DVDs.  Its truly one of the best yoga DVDs out there.  I would recommend this series for people who have chronic pain (even fibromyalgia or MS) as even though its deceptively gentle, you will see results because they are smart with the procession of posses in making them work and not crazy redic.  These are realistic poses.  I just wished I had discovered them like $90 of DVDs ago.",1377993600,,3818,4.555718475073314
7964260,2,B000068MAJ,Being new to yoga this video was more for someone who has already some experience.  Its ok. Looking for basic who never study.,1365465600,,126,4.478260869565218
7964261,5,B000068MAJ,"I've taken yoga in the past at an excellent studio but wanted the convenience of doing yoga at home when it fit into my schedule.  There are two 20 minute yoga routines.  Michelle and Al do an excellent job of explaining how to do each pose.  On busy days I do one routine and if I have time I do both for a really good stretch.  Now that I've been working on the basics, I plan to buy some additional DVDs for more variety.  I felt my purchase was worth the money.",1295049600,,465,4.010869565217392
7964262,4,B000068MAJ,"I've been using this DVD off and on for a couple of years now.  It provides a great stretch before a workout, or can stand alone as a light workout.  You work the core; and the first segment with Michelle provides an amazing stretch through the back and legs.  However, the next segment with Al Bingham annoys the crap out of me.  Al comes off as being preachy and judgmental IMHO; explaining to me that I'm not in a race or trying to ""win yoga"".  I don't need a lecture; I want to learn some poses.  And I definitely don't want to be lectured in the middle of a pose!  I've never been able to work through the second part of the DVD with good ol' Al.  His condescending prattle shatters the zen-like state I'm trying to achieve.",1248652800,,729,4.231884057971015
7964263,4,B000068MAJ,"To me, the title ""Yoga Basics for Beginers"" indicates a methodical lesson, during which tons of poses are introduced and explained. What I got was 20 beginers workout, with some explinations thrown in. I like what I got. The first session is taught by Michelle and demonstrated Al Bingham, reversed in the second session. Al is a far superior instructor. Michelle doesn't do a great job of explaining poses. Overall, the second workout is better, and I'd recomend starting with it because its poses ""flow"" more logically. And because we all love lists, I've decided to tell you what I thought was good and bad about this (my very first) yoga DVD and let you decide.

GOOD

-Al is my fave yogazone instructor

-Lovely settings

-Hard for a novice at first, but you'll get through it on try 5 and you'll feel accomplished

-Can do 20 minute workouts seperately or together

-Will introduce you to yoga

BAD

-First downward dog in second session is too long

-Sometimes they have you do the poses without giving the name

-Both sessions are relatively similar; if they weren't, we could have been introduced to more poses.",1128384000,17,1120,4.756476683937824
7964264,2,B000068MAJ,"I've done yoga a few times in classes, but I'm fairly inflexible and don't consider myself an expert by any means. I was looking for a DVD that would give some simple poses to do and could help me relax.

Well, this DVD oversimplified it. If you've never done yoga before, this might be a good place to start, otherwise, your money is better spent elsewhere. There was no flow between poses, and each one was held for a very long time as one of the instructors explained it. I had a strong dislike for both instructors by the end of the first segment.

The production value of this DVD was also pretty poor. It seemed slightly out of focus for the first segment. The instructor would talk almost constantly, and would sometimes look right at the camera, but not always at the right camera. The music was barely audible and really didn't add anything. Leaves fell through the shot. People walked through the background. I was unable to find a sense of focus and relaxation because of all this.

Overall, this DVD might give good instruction to someone who had never done yoga before and wanted to learn about a few poses. If you've done some yoga before, no matter how little, I would advise to skip this DVD.",1107734400,25,1208,4.4818181818181815
7964265,3,B000068MAJ,"I've done yoga off and on for a little over a year. I don't consider myself advanced by any means and I know I'm very weak in the upper body, overweight, and not very flexible. However, with yoga and walking I have improved a lot. I love yogazone's programs, and really enjoy most of the dvds with 2 20 minute workouts on them like this one. But, I feel a beginner beginner, esp to exercise, should start with one that's more instructional, like in the other series yoga zone puts out...I didn't start with the beginner one with the yellow cover, but did flexibility and tone and while it's hard, the instruction was there. the main problem I had with 'basics' being a beginner workout is the amount of time spent in downdog. it's a lot! If I had to recommend a 20 minute yoga zone for an absolute beginner, I would suggest total body conditioning, esp the 1st workout, because she goes fairly slow and explains enough to do the pose and does a nice variety of standing and seated poses..and no downward facing dog! I also love stretching for flexibility 1st part(sheholds down dog a long time but is very encouraging and a nice stretch espif you're already warmed up) and strong and healthy back is nice too,esp the 2nd program..the 1st  has a lot of twists and is also nice but requres a lot more flexibility imo!",1090713600,15,1315,4.479166666666667
