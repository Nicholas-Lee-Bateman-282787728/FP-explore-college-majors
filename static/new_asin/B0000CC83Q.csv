7998806,5,B0000CC83Q,"This DVD preserves some of the inspirational music, sung from the heart and not from any church. This is direct spiritual communication by God and by Man.

There is something for everyone somewhere in this collection -- something that will become unforgettable. For me, there are two selections I have never forgotten and will never forget: Kate Smith's absolutely sincere power in ""The Lord's Prayer,"" and what is probably the greatest Bible reading-performance of all time by the incomparable Charles Laughton, who included it regularly in his worldwide solo stage performances. Record collectors treasure Laughton's readings, and pay extremely high prices to acquire good disks. Here, as if for the first time, you SEE the magnificent actor at the peak of his art -- performed with that great dramatic skill and intensity that was the hallmark of the finest English Classical acting. Olivier's and Heston's Bible readings are candles compared with this pillar of fire.

If you love McKellen's Gandalf, you will be blown away by Laughton.",1211241600,3,1040,5.221556886227545
