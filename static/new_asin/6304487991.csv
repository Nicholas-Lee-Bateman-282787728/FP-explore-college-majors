7873775,5,6304487991,"I don't usually give anything such a high rating, but DragonSlayer was the first adventure anime I saw that actually held my attention.  The only thing that might bother people is one character calling men ""pig""  or ""pervert"" almost all through it.  It hardly distracted from my  enjoyment, as that's only this character's personality, there is also a  scene of someone being impaled,an a few monsters being sliced up.  In all,  this movie is pretty safe, but I still wouldn't show it to young children.  The music is pleasant, the humor will keep you smiling, and the adventure  is enough to keep you involved. My only dissapoint was that the movie ends  so suddenly, it leaves you wondering.  It's also a little vague.  I would  reccomend this movie to anyone who enjoys humor and medievil type  adventures. Oh yeah, did I mention there are two dragons, an evil king, and  demons?",943488000,8,882,4.748344370860927
