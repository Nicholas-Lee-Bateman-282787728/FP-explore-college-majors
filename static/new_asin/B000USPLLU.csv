8214613,2,B000USPLLU,You may be disappointed as well.  This is a DVD-R and so was not professionally manufactured. It was probably dubbed from a VHS tape.,1519257600,,133,4.541666666666667

8214616,5,B000USPLLU,"""Monty Python: Live At The Hollywood Bowl"" was released in 1982.  The members of Monty Python's Flying Circus include Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Carol Cleveland, Eric Idle, Neil Innes, Terry Jones, and Michael Palin.  Graham Chapman, who died in 1989, gets things started on an absurd note as Colin ""Bomber"" Harris, a professional wrestler who wrestles himself.  Before the Australian Bruces launch into ""The Philosopher's Song,"" Eric Idle (Bruce) declares: ""They're a typical Hollywood audience.  All the kids are on drugs, and all the adults are on roller skates!""  Classic skits, such as ""The Wizzo Chocolate Company (a/k/a Crunchy Frog),"" ""Nudge, Nudge,"" ""The Argument Clinic,"" and ""The Travel Agency,"" are interspersed with new sketches, and filmed segments from Monty Python's German episode.  Neil Innes provides the musical interludes with the songs ""Urban Spaceman"" and ""How Sweet To Be An Idiot.""  Speaking of music, the concert concludes with Eric Idle taking the lead on the classic ""Lumberjack Song.""  Monty Python's Flying Circus was near the peak of its popularity in America in 1982, and the crowd responds enthusiastically to everything they do.  The video quality of the show is much better than the old VHS video I had, but still not great.",1405641600,,1261,5.233830845771144
8214617,5,B000USPLLU,"""Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl,"" which first appeared on the wide screen in 1982, is a compilation of sketches that they performed during their stint at the Hollywood Bowl. Although most of these sketches were originally performed in one or another of the episodes of MP's Flying Circus, these are arguably some of the best. A few of the sketches are: ""World Forum"" (in which Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin, Mao, and Che Guevera attempt to answer questions on British pop culture), the Australian philosophers sketch, all of whom are named ""Bruce"" (culminating in the Philosophers' Drinking Song), the Whizzo Chocolate Company sketch, and, of course, the Lumberjack sketch (what compilation of sketches would be complete with this most famous of all the MP sketches?). Although much of this material can also be found in ""And Now For Something Completely Different,"" the Hollywood Bowl movie has about as good a selection of MP sketches as are available in a single movie. I highly recommend it for an enjoyable evening of laughs (and, if you've been a long-time MP fan, nostalgia).",1386720000,4,1087,5.011049723756906
8214618,5,B000USPLLU,"Loved it, from the opening credits to the final words this entertained. I appreciate that this kind of humor isn't for everyone, but I found it first rate.",1372636800,,155,4.571428571428571
8214619,4,B000USPLLU,"In an A&E documentary on the Pythons John Cleese recalls that night at the Hollywood Bowl as one that had ""an air of freedom."" Having viewed this comedy concert several times I am in total agreement with the Minister of Silly Walks. Enjoy the air, people!",1318377600,2,255,4.565217391304348
