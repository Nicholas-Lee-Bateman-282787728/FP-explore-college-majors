7827238,5,6302541662,"This VHS tape was classic Rocky and Bullwinkle. The humor is was clean and truly funny. It's a tape that all ages can enjoy. It's the kind of tape that won't shock you with violence, blood and gore, and strange cult innuendoes. It's not bizarre and never gets old with its crazy humor. It was at a great price and a real classic to share with friends of all ages.",1420156800,,363,4.2
7827239,5,6302541662,"This came factory wrapped and in mint condition. Even the BVHV engravement on the cassette was untouched. This completed my entire collection of the Buena Vista Rocky and Bullwinkle Compilations. I prefer them because of their format, in contrast to the series (which I also have)",1414195200,,280,5.108695652173913
7827240,5,6302541662,"classic rocky and bullwinkle. funny as usual. didn't remember seeing this one as a kid, so it was nice to watch this one with my son.",1357171200,,133,4.153846153846154
7827241,5,6302541662,"After the 3rd season the ""Rocky and Bullwinkle & Friends"" moved to another network with a different name, ""The Bullwinkle Show.""  There should be two seasons of ""The Bullwinkle Show"", as the cartoon ran for 3 on one network and 2 on another. (The format also changed a little but still the same great show.)

I own the first three seasons and can only hope that the remaining two are released soon so my set can be completed!!",1148515200,11,426,4.448717948717949
7827242,5,6302541662,"Sadly, this is the last in the set, but thankfully, it is just as funny as the first 11.
A great story of Bullwinkle swallowing the recipe for the silent explosive ""hush-a-boom,"" Mr. Peabody & Sherman use the  Way Back machine to visit the ""Bonnie"" Prince Charles, Mr.  Know-It-All tries to make friends, Bullwinkle's Corner deals in daffodils,  Fractured Fairy Tales presents the story of a 24-carat goose, Aesop &  Son add a fable, and Dudley and Snidely go at it as only they  can!
Hopefully you have more tapes from this hilarious series so when  this one is finished, you can just start watching them all over again, and  again, and again...",964569600,3,646,4.663716814159292
7827243,5,6302541662,"What can I say, I think the whole set is great!
This one has R&B fighting a people-eating plant from conquering the world, (yes, it is a bit of a nod to The Little Shop of Horrors in a way. A Rockie and Bullwinkle  way.) Also included, Dudley goes recruiting, Bullwinkle's Corner takes a  cut at Morrie's Little Lamb, Mr. Peabody & Sherman meet Lawrence of  Arabia, Fractured Fairy Tales deals with a red-haired duke, and Mr.  Know-It-All shows you how NOT to sell vacuum cleaners.",964569600,4,481,4.558139534883721
7827244,5,6302541662,"Out of all of the Rocky and Bullwinkle videos, ""Banana Formula ""  is my favorite.  The story is: Fearless Leader tells Boris and Natasha to  steal any formula.  So they steel the formula for Hush- A-Boom, a silent  explosive.  After Boris gets the formula, he sees Rocky and Bullwinkle  coming down the street towards him.  In a hurry to hide the formula, Boris  writes the formula on a banana from a nearby fruit stand.  As Bullwinkle  walks by, he is attracted to the fruit stand, and the bananas.  So  Bullwinkle buys the banana containing the 1 million dollar formula.  The  problem is that Bullwinkle can remember everything he has ever eaten!  For  the rest of the video Boris and Natasha are after Bullwinkle to get the  formula from him. This is truly one of the greatest Rocky and Bullwinkle  episodes!  Also included in this video are the shorts ""Mr.  Know-It-All"", ""Aesop and Son"", ""Sherman and  Peabody"", ""Fractured Fairy Tales"", ""Dudley  Do-Right"", and ""Bullwinkle's Corner""!!!  This is a laugh  packed video for all ages! You will not be disappointed with this one!!!!!",959558400,2,1083,4.850828729281768
