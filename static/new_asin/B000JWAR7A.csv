8153483,1,B000JWAR7A,"This volume of Stargate SG-1 (Season 8, Vol. 5) is almost as defective as my original boxed copy. It will not play on my TV (all other volumes and movies do) but this one plays with fewer mistakeson my computer than my original copy that came with the boxed set. However, I would far prefer to play it on my TV what with the better audiio sound and picture. I have heard numerous complaints about this particular DVD and I am apprehensive about buying the 9th and 10th season because of this issue.

I have no idea how to get a copy of this DVD that works. I would strongly consider steering away from this and just hope you see it on TV and can record it from there yourselves.

This particlar DVD is the lemon of the century. Fortunately, all the previous DVD's of Stargate SG-1 play just fine.",1196985600,2,796,4.3
