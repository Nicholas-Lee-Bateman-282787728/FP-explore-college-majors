7879830,1,6304925204,"I rented this movie because of Michael Caine, of course.  I thought he could carry any spy thriller off because he is such a fantastic actor.  But I was wrong.  Faced with a lame script, terrible co-stars, and a vapid plot, Caine grimaces his way through it as if it were a trip to the dentist's office.  Consider yourself warned!",1206144000,,330,4.45
7879831,1,6304925204,"I bought this thinking that M. Caine could do not wrong.  I was wrong!  The film is terrible.  Nothing redeeming... the photography is bad - stilted [looks like home video], the dialogue is trite, the actor walk thru the parts and even St. Petersburg is not covered until the finishing credits... if you last that long.... really bad... save your money and if you want to see a good film of this genre buy The Ipcress File or any other M. Caine film....",1150243200,,453,4.433734939759036
7879832,1,6304925204,"There are no words to describe how AWFUL (!!!) this ""movie"" was from beginning to end, but let me try anyway so as to give people a fair chance to avoid it and thus try and prevent their day/evening from being ruined: the film deals with a shipment of plutonium that goes missing in the early post-soviet era.  Michael Caine's character heads a private investigating office in Moscow and sets off for Saint Petersburg after his employee informs him of his girlfriend being stalked by thugs...

The plot, the dialogues, and the music are way beyond ""below average.""

The acting-oh my- the acting is beyond words...

School plays (and pre-school for that matter) have better actors!  It is truly sad...

The only positive aspect of the ""movie"" is the setting/location, which really is Russia; the scenery is great-Saint Petersburg is beautiful!

Everything else, and I mean EVERYTHING else is horrendous!

Rent or buy at your own risk.  You have been warned!",1136851200,4,956,4.888198757763975
7879833,4,6304925204,"Harry Palmer has matured into a mellower, more laid-back ""secret agent"" than the wiseacre we saw in the ""Ipcress File.""  But he's still on top of goings-on in the modern, mafia-dominated Russian  underworld.  Michael Caine is fun to watch because his approach to this  sort of role, and I suspect his offscreen personality, expresses the gentle  irony that Len Deighton brings to his spy stories.  This film has some  routine doings about paintings stolen from the Hermitage museum being  swapped for a-bomb material, plus the usual lineup of devious characters  trying to one-up everybody.  I enjoyed this flick mostly for its  atmospheric locations - St. Petersburg or not, they were plenty European -  and for the European supporting cast most of whom I'd not seen before.  Michael Gambon, the excellent English character actor, is underutilized in  a brief, stereotyped role, but Jason Connery comes off well, and there was  a fair amount of motoring through city streets in beatup old vehicles  unidentifiable to American eyes, which always makes things seem more  exotic.  This film goes good with popcorn, too.",960940800,42,1117,5.145251396648045
