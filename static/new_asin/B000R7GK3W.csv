8199410,1,B000R7GK3W,"I am a big fan of Mark Nesbit's Books and I thought the ""Ghosts of Gettysburg"" Videos one and two were narrarated and put together very well. The commentaries of Professesor Simmons were a great addition.  So when I bought this..I was expecting something Grand.  Unfortunately, The video was filmed way to close and lacked and real editing. The overall investigation was lacking any real scientific method or equipment. As a Founder of a well known paranormal group in Tampa...I feel I have a good perspective on what a good solid investigation should be. I would have loved to go there with the Haunted Hunters and took EMF & Ion Readings...Infra red film as well cover other areas of the  light Spectrym. I am sure we would have come up with some real good evidence. Mark was a forerunner in documenting ghosts and I remeber going to Gettysburg and doing investigations before the term ""Ghost Hunter "" came about.  Back then it was big boom boxes for EVP's , Digital scanners to check various frequencies, and the advent of infra red camcorders. The only equipment used here were dowsing Rods and a handheld recorder.
Overall, the investigation itself needed alot more content and much better filming.
Hopefully upcoming ones will be more in line with either his original stroy telling in ""ghosts of Gettysburg"" or more of a scientific investigation.",1203033600,3,1352,4.8652173913043475
