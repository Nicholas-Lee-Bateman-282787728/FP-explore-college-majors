5886527,1,B00E1Y60AA,"I saw a very short version of this program on a pledge drive by my local PBS station, and was I ever chomping to get my hands on this dvd! However, the same PBS station showed as much of the program as they usually do on pledge drives again, and I'm so glad they did. They saved me $20 for what I would have immediately thrown in the trash! While I have no problems with the program, I do question the decision to perform this program in a cathedral in which the acoustics and the orchestra completely overwhelm the singers! On many songs, you could only hear the singers if they were singing at the top of their lungs. Whoever engineered this dvd needs to go back to school. A totally good program wasted on either very bad engineering or a very bad venue. Don't waste your money--I'm glad I caught this program in time to save myself some coin.",1284595200,3,846,4.29375
5886528,5,B00E1Y60AA,"I attended the live production and taping of Hallelujah Broadway this year on a cold February night in Prague.  The warmth of the church with this awe inspiring cast made all forget about the bitter cold outside.  The lights, the orchestra, the chorus and of course the fantastic soloists gave me as well as the entire audience an unforgettable night that can now be cherished on CD and DVD.  This DVD and CD soundtrack is a must for any musical theater enthusiast!  Keith from Dallas",1284336000,9,484,4.658823529411765
5886529,5,B00E1Y60AA,"Think about inspirational, uplifting songs from Broadway musicals, and what comes to mind? Jesus Christ Superstar?  Godspell?  Yentl? Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat? Maybe Fiddler on the Roof or The Sound of Music?

Have you ever emerged from a Broadway theater feeling you had a religious experience, whether the play dealt with spiritual themes or not? The man who produced The Irish Tenors, Bill Hughes, has put together a spectacular show that includes numbers from ""Godspell, Oklahoma!, West Side Story, Sound of Music, Billy Elliot, Rent, and Wicked among others!"" EMI/Manhattan Records will release Hallelujah Broadway on CD and DVD September 14. It is an amazing production.

Filmed and recorded in Prague at the Church of St. Simon and St. Judah in February 2010, Hallelujah Broadway features three soloists: Rodrick Dixon (tenor),  Alfreda Burke (soprano, Chicago Symphony), and Anthony Kearns (Irish tenor). Also featured is Broadway veteran, Linda Eder. They are accompanied by  the Prague Filmharmonic Orchestra and Choir.

Although Hallelujah Broadway begins with ""Prepare Ye the Way of the Lord"" from Godspell, the emphasis is not on religious songs, but on songs that are inspiring, rousing, and stirring. ""I'll Be Seeing You,"" a song that has inspired lovers for oh-so-many years, is a good example of a secular song with strong emotional content; here it is beautifully, powerfully rendered by Anthony Kearns.

Dixon, Burke, Kearns, and Eder provide incredible vocals, elevating such well known songs as ""Oh What a Beautiful Mornin',"" ""What I Did for Love,""  ""Climb Every Mountain,"" and ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" (Burke's exceptional performance, backed by the Choir). Dixon's interpretation of ""Somewhere"" imparts new importance to this West Side Story classic.
There are over 20 songs performed on the DVD, and the quality of the production is impressive.

While many live performances lose something when recorded, Hallelujah Broadway is a gem. Seeing the show live must have, indeed, been an extraordinary experience. This is not just ""show tunes,"" Hallelujah Broadway is an experience to which fans of serious music, as well as Broadway classics, must treat themselves.

Bottom Line: Would I buy/rent/stream Hallelujah Broadway? Buy, for sure. The real question is, ""Am I willing to let it out of my sight?"" Sorry, friends, no borrowing this one; buy your own.

5886530,5,B00E1Y60AA,"I saw ""Hallelujah Broadway!"" on our local PBS station as part of pledge break.  Since I am already a member of the station, I did not want to pay the big bucks to get the DVD as a ""premium.""  This DVD will knock you out of your seats, it's so good.  They have collected some ""unknown"" but fantastic singers, along with a great orchestra in a knockout setting, and they give you some of the best of Broadway show music.  It's absolutely a ""don't miss.""  You won't be able to leave your seat until the very end!",1280620800,18,509,4.206185567010309
5886531,5,B00E1Y60AA,"The music on this DVD is so beautiful.  I especially liked the GODSPELL medley.  They selected the perfect singers to sing some of the most beautiful and spiritual songs on Broadway.  I have really enjoyed the DVD.

5886532,4,B00E1Y60AA,"We had seen this production of ""Hallelujah Broadway"" on our PBS channel and was sorry that we didn't get a chance to view the entire program.  I decided to get the DVD for my husband for Christmas.....Upon receiving this gem - he was very disappointed to find that the part of ""Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat"" sequence was NOT on this DVD....can you explain why or find out from the company who produced this?  I believe, according to my husband, this was one of the 'highlights' of the program.  We have been a fan of Roderick Dixon since seeing him with the group 3 Mo'e Tenors....which was outstanding! (Sorry they have since disbanded).  Thank you for your continual good service - your promptness in all of my orders made Christmas giving a relaxing pleasure.",1294099200,,778,4.7407407407407405
5886533,5,B00E1Y60AA,"Such fabulous voices!  Beautiful songs and arrangements!  A live performance, regardless of what one reviewer says.  If you're a fan of beautiful broadway songs, then I believe you'll enjoy this dvd.  I certainly did!",1288483200,2,217,5.294117647058823
5886534,1,B00E1Y60AA,"Pretty awful...with the exception of Linda Eder.  Poor songs choices...and not a live concert, which the cover implies it would be.
Voices don't match the material at all!",1288224000,3,171,5.107142857142857
5886535,1,B00E1Y60AA,"Stay away from this atrocity.  It is a complete waste of money and time.  Why on earth didn't the producer hire actual BROADWAY professionals (with the exception of Eder)?  Yes, the performers have good voices, but they are not equipped with the musicianship, acting ability or vocal technique required for broadway music.  Epic fail.",1288137600,,334,5.12962962962963
5886536,5,B00E1Y60AA,"As noted re: the CD of this show, anything Anthony Kearns is sought after in this household.  This is the DVD of the same, and seeing him perform is a delight.  The others give a good performance also.  One more AK item to add to my collection!",1287187200,,244,4.148936170212766
5886537,5,B00E1Y60AA,"This is truly one of the most spectacular performances I have seen in a long time. I often feel that when watching shows on TV or DVD it's difficult to engage completely - you're distracted by your surroundings, you don't quite feel the energy the audience seems to be feeling - but this couldn't be farther from the truth in this case.

The setting in a church in Prague is breathtakingly beautiful, the lighting enhances what is already a spectacular setting and the intimacy of the venue creates a wonderful sense that this really is something special. I was glued to my screen from start until finish.

What was remarkable about the stars was the raw energy that just flowed from them. The passion they gave to every song was not superficial, they really were pouring heart and soul into every word. The CD offers an excellent selection but I would highly recommend getting the DVD as well. To see these stars in action is just something else.",1286668800,3,947,4.630952380952381
5886538,5,B00E1Y60AA,"I first saw Hallelujah Broadway in all it's splendour on our national station in Ireland (RTE) at Easter time and I was blown away. Having just received my DVD copy of it, I was delighed to see even MORE beautiful and uplifting Broadway songs sung with power and emotion from four singers clearly at the top of their game. It's a truly moving piece of work.

Alfreda Burke's ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" from Carousel is a musical triumph sung with all her heart. Rodrick Dixon's medley from Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dream Coat, in particular ""Any Dream Will Do,"" is resplendent.

Anthony Kearns can't help but inspire with his soaring voice on songs like ""Bring Him Home"", while Broadway star Linda Eder would bring a grown man to tears with songs like ""What I Did For Love"" from A Chorus Line.

Musical director Gavin Murphy, the FilmHarmonic Orchestra and the Choir of Prague combine to get the very best out of these talented vocalists. The show is so elegantly produced with amazing lighting in the stunning church setting in Prague, Czech Republic.

I cannot recommend this DVD highly enough - I know what several of my family and friends will be receiving for Christmas this year!",1286323200,2,1194,4.753623188405797
5886539,3,B00E1Y60AA,"I missed this show on PBS this summer so am only commenting on the DVD being issued this fall. The concert was performed in Prague in February 2010 in a small church. (If you've ever been to Prague you know that the churches are the venues for concerts, dance and even theatre.

The cast consists of three main singers - an Irish tenor, an African American bass and an African American soprano. I am not familiar with any of these performers and not sure that they have Broadway credentials. But they do sing well. The known performer is ""special guest"" Linda Eder, best known for her role in Jekyll & Hyde and The Scarlet Pimpernel, both written by her husband Frank Wildhorn. The ""orchestra"" is the Prague Filharmonic (note the spelling of the name!). They are adequate.

The theme of the concert program is ""uplifting songs"" from Broadway. The few  ""religious type"" songs (a medley from Stephen Schwartz' first musical Godspell) are mixed with the obvious ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" (Carousel) and ""Anthem"" ( a rarely performed song from Tim Rice's Chess). Excellent choices are also ""Seasons of Love"" (Rent) and ""Sunday"" (from Sunday in the Park With George). It was an interesting creative choice to have the two male singers duet on ""For Good"" (from Schwartz's mega-hit Wicked), a number usually preformed by the two witches in the show.

Eder has the most star power and she does get to sing one song she originated on Broadway. It's ""Someone Like You"" from J&H. The producers commissioned for the show (though I can't imagine why) a song called ""Hallelujah Broadway"". It's a throwaway and I doubt that you will ever hear it again outside this concert.

I mentioned the lighting in the title caption to this review. Except when the camera focuses in on the face or upper body of the singers the lighting is dark. And the brilliant lighting designer placed stage lights on the floor behind the singers facing the camera so for any of the long shots you will find yourself shielding your eyes from the bright yellow lights. Obviously someone must have noticed this when reviewing the tape.

So, I did enjoy watching this DVD once but I'm not sure I'll return to it.

There is a companion CD but - even though the whole DVD concert is only 77 minutes (so the music, with edits for introductions, would easily fit on a single CD - quite a few songs (including everything from Godspell!) do not appear on the CD.

5886540,4,B00E1Y60AA,"Simply put, most performances on this 77-minute-long DVD are stunning. You'll be moved, inspired, thrilled, and immensely entertained throughout -- and if you're not feeling good afterwards, I suggest that you watch it again. As a longtime fan of the magnicent Anthony Kearns of the Irish Tenors, and a lifelong fan of musical theatre, I was anxious to get my copy of Hallelujah Broadway. I already own some music by Linda Eder but had never heard of Rodrick Dixon and was only vaguely aware of Alfreda Burke. I've since learned Dixon is one of the 3 Mo' Tenors group, though I'd never listened to them before.

After watching/listening to Rodrick Dixon in particular, I'll be scouring the internet for all his music. What a performer! His rendition of ""Somewhere"" will send chills up your spine. Linda Eder is lovely and her voice is perfect for these songs (not exactly a surprise).

Alfreda Burke was okay, but I don't think her voice is suitable for this type of music-- don't get me wrong, I love opera, but frankly, Ms. Burke sounds shrill at times. When she blends in with her co-stars, she does better. Thus, I believe the title song, ""Hallelujah Broadway"" featuring the trio of Kearns, Burke, and Dixon is worth the price of the DVD alone. You will love this performance. Additonally, the orchestral arrangements beautifully complement the singing.

And as I knew would be true, Anthony Kearns was brilliant on every song he sang. ""I'll Be Seeing You"" is sung with such feeling and you could see the nostalgia he evoked on every face in the audience. The highlight of the individual performances for me is a tie between Dixon with ""Somewhere"" and Kearns with his breathtakingly poignant version of ""Bring Him Home.""

Worth watching for Dixon, Eder, and especially, Kearns.",1284854400,4,1781,4.867986798679868
8600283,5,B00E1Y60AA,"To be honest, the other reviewers on this page are far more knowledgeable about this DVD and its performers.  I bought it only to see (and hear) one of my all-time favorite singers, LINDA EDER.  Her most recent Broadway performance was in ""Phantom Of The Opera"".

Once you hear Linda's voice, you'll be enchanted and become a lifelong fan of this beautiful lady.  Her remarkable voice ranks right up there with Barbra Streisand, Celine Dion, and Sarah Brightman.  In this album she performs with an ensemble, so the magic of her voice was mostly blended with the others.  However, because of her presence, this DVD is a valued part of my collection.

8600291,5,B00E1Y60AA,I have had the pleasure of hearing Rodrick & Alfreda before and this video lives up to their awesomeness.  Only criticism--would have liked Rod to sing two or three more songs and would have liked a few more of the older Broadway classics.  Otherwise great!!!!,1326153600,,260,4.7555555555555555
8600292,5,B00E1Y60AA,"I discovered this program when it was broadcast on PBS during fundraising.  I was very excited to find it on Amazon.  I still can't understand why this musical presentation was filmed in a magnificent church in Poland completly in English but I am glad it was.  The singers are Alfreda Burke, Rodrick Dixon, Anthony Kearns and Linda Eder.  Eder is more of a lounge singer but, when they sing together and alone, each is more terrific than the other.  The beginning finds each entering from a different direction leading the opening  outstanding performance.  Their voices are perfect - not a sour note ever.  Each singer has one or two featured songs and each one tops the previous.  Any lover of classical, opera, broadway, top-40, you name it - it is in this program.

Amazon allows reviewers to add OR change a review.  I don't want to change anything.  I just want to restate how marcelous this DVD is.  I had guests recently and listened again (severl times).  It is even better than my first 4 times listening to it.  I had six guests and they raved about the numbers, the voices the sound.  Don't worry if you have never heard of the singers (I only knew one when I bought it).  Each is outstanding....GREAT!!!",1320710400,2,1217,4.61214953271028
