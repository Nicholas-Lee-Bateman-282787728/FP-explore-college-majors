Director Jeremy Podeswa does an amazing job in his attempt to captivate viewers by peering into the minds of these rich characters.  Stephen Dillane, who plays Jakob, is his usual brilliant self and offers us a superior glimpse at profound acting at its best. I also found Ayelet Zurer, (Michala), a breath of fresh air.  The film also inspired me to seek out more of Rade Sherbedgia who plays an important role opposite Stephen Dillane.  He is engaging to watch with both Dillane and the younger actor who plays Dillane's character as a child.  I'm looking forward to reading Anne Michael's book which the film is based upon, although the reviews I've read here on Amazon seem to relay a complex narrative/story structure.  It's unfortunate the film's release was limited to Canada and a minimum number of cities in the US. I must recommend this film to everyone, especially Dillane fans and those who appreciate intelligent, poignant and provocative dialogue.",1236124800,19,1010,4.91764705882353
8339041,5,B001RVKGBO,Very heartwarming story of Trumatic loss and have to witness it. No one who witnesses  A loss like this comes out the same. A kindness of a man who risk everything to take him in with hatred everywhere just  just because of what he is.  Living in fear even after the end of the war. Haunting memories as he said that gets underneath  his skin.  To sum it up a story of loss being found then saved and then trying to come to terms  With it throught his writing to later finding a love that brings everything together.,1499558400,,516,4.214285714285714

8339044,5,B001RVKGBO,"This movie is rewarding on so many levels and it is hard for me to critique it. The story is mesmerizing, albeit disturbing and so uplifting. The relationship of the two main characters is beautiful as Athos attempts to relieve the anxiety of young Jakob. The tenderness each shows the other as they age and the role reversal is moving. The addition of the extended family and the relationship between Jakob and the young neighbor boy added so much dimension to the story. The movie haunted me for days but I am ready to watch it again. Some may think the ending is trite but I was delighted with the conclusion. Stephen Dillane is brilliant as he portrays each phase of Jakob's life. This movie is a jewel.",1385510400,2,707,4.53125

This is an extraordinary gem that I feel lucky to have found.  A boy witnesses the destruction of his family, but escapes with the help of a great man who happens to find him and smuggle him from an archaeological site in Poland all the way to Greece.  Traumatized and deeply scarred, the boy grows up in the shadow of the war on a remote island, the man mentoring him in life and languages, surviving  and deeply involved with the community of the villageat great danger to himself.

At the close of the war, they move to Canada, where they restart their lives.  Just down the hall, the boy meets some other yiddish-speaking holocaust survivors and together they all form a kind of family.  Though there are plenty of good holocaust films, nowhere have I seen its aftermath so well portrayed.

As he grows into an adult, the boy works hard to develop his talents as a writer, but he is tied to the past with an obsession with death, particularly that of his sister, who was dragged off by the Nazis.  In his state of withdrawal, he allows a marriage (sadly a mismatch) to an exuberant beauty to wither and die, though it inspires him to return to Greece and begin a new phase of creative expression in memory and art.  Nothing seems to overcome his introspective melancholy, until he is introduced to someone else and a new phase of his life begins, looking forward rather than backward.  The beauty of this interior journey is a unique achievement.

Warmly recommended.  This is art that approaches the complexity of life.",1288742400,7,1545,4.636029411764706

8339050,5,B001RVKGBO,"Beautifully filmed, seamlessly directed.  Extraordinary performances by the entire cast.  A tremendously moving, powerful story that is both very sad but with great things to say as to the resilience of humanity, the power of goodness and hope, the importance of honesty and truth, and the need for courage and tenacity in the face of tragedy and war. This film to me was faultless, majestic, and yet proceeded with a lightness of touch that is rarely matched. One of the great films and one of the most wonderful films I have no doubt I will see in a long, long time.",1252454400,3,568,4.6138613861386135
