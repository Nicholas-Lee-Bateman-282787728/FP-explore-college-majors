7851038,5,6303593399,Atom Egoyan is a master director. This first Egoyan film was the beginning of what was to come from a director like no other! The affection and sincerity expressed in NEXT OF KIN will hold your attention throughout like only few films can. Egoyan's films are truly unique in the way they can be watched again and again. If you've never seen an Egoyan film then this is the perfect one to start with. NEXT OF KIN is sure to make you an instant Atom Egoyan fan!!!,1324771200,,461,4.310344827586207
7851039,4,6303593399,"I first saw ""Next of Kin"" at UT-Austin around 1990. I was  amused, but thought it was derivative of Steven Soderberg who had recently  won the Palm D'Or for ""Sex, Lies, and Videotape.""
THEN...I saw  the copyright was 1985--and nearly fell out of my seat!!! I'm convinced the  ""derivation"" was the other way 'round.
Since then I've followed  his career with admiration and affection. No one else deals with desire as  intelligently as he does. No one insists on placing their characters in a  web of familial relationships (*without it necessarily being the main  theme*) the way he does.
Sometimes puzzling (as in ""The  Adjuster"") Sometimes dazzling (as in ""The Sweet Hereafter"")  ALWAYS engaging.
This early work will make you feel *good* with an ending  that is happy without being cheap.
It *may* make you never want to visit  the ""erotic thriller"" section of your video store AGAIN!!! :-)",968371200,2,892,4.912751677852349
7851040,5,6303593399,"wonderful look at family life through the eyes of a curious man, Peter who takes on the life of Pedros, the son given up by two Armenian parents. increadible opening sequences with long shots of baggage carousels.  perfect acting and long shots, not too many edits. nice to see atom in some  parts too, and the polaroids add the perfect touch, plus the final image.  there is an annoying fly pestering me. thank you atom.  see it on 16mm at  Moviate.org",926380800,5,453,4.54320987654321
