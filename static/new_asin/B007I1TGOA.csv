5088539,5,B007I1TGOA,"One of the best Harem-fan service comedies arrives in American territory, KANOKON is not your typical ""pervy"" anime it could be THE best ECCHI anime ever made, ""Xebec""( To Love-Ru, Love Hina ) made this series as enjoyable as possible, meaning you won't be bored with all the mischief going on in each episode, the characters, backgrounds, the superb and well rendered animation, light and shadow effects are as detail as something that I've ever seen before specially for this type of anime, if you are into Harem-anime then you already know that most of them have bad quality and animation.

Kanokon's story revolves around Kouta , a young first-year high school student. On his first day at his new school, a beautiful second-year female student named Chizuru (long black hair) asks him to meet her alone in the music room. When he arrives, she reveals that she is in fact a fox deity and from that day on the two hang out together. Nozomu ( blonde short hair) is a first year female student at Kouta's school, she is a wolf deity in love with Kouta, and a rival of Chizuru for Kouta's affections.

The story and plot lovers will be disappointed because there's barely a story here, then again this is a HAREM COMEDY, what makes this types of shows is not about the stories is all about fan service, and this anime has lots of it BUT I'm not talking of just panty shots, this anime goes beyond any innuendo ever imagined.

PROS
- Price
- All 12 episodes.
- OVA shorts.
- English and Japanese audio.
- Vivid colors, fluent and beautiful animation that I'll describe it not as eye candy but as eye protein.
- Each character has a unique charm ( specially the squirrel girls).
- Nozomu.
- The opening and ending songs fit perfectly for the series, the opening is as if it says ""wake Up"" and the ending ""go to sleep"".
- surprisingly funny.
- Lots of innuendo.

Cons
- Plot holes.
- The final episode felt flat in its conclusion, because it feels more like one of those bland Drama-Slice of life anime rather than a comedy ( so if you don't want to be disappointed at the very end DON'T watch episode 12 ).

If you're into Ninja Nonsense, To Love-Ru and Girls Bravo then by all means buy it you won't be disappointed.",1302739200,56,2215,4.4727722772277225
5088540,3,B007I1TGOA,"This is fanservic plain and simple. From episode one to episode twelve you will watch your heroine fling her body at our hero time and time again thankfully it doesn't get into H-catagory staying squarly in ecchi territory.. Not only that but the sub character declares herself his mistress. The animation is very high quality, the japanese voice acting is right on, and the music is very good.

Now I might sound a little harsh, and I did like the show to a degree, but it just goes overboard at times with thrusting flesh at the screen. And as you might notice on the box art, your hero is just one big spaz the whole time. Despite daily bust shows, panty showings, and other flirtatious actions he freaks out nearly every single time. He is a very two dimensional character with little growth. The two heroins however do get some good development. And a lot of the side-characters are in realty very interesting, but don't get enough screen time.

This bundle is FAR superior than the idea of buying multiple single DVDs. In a nutshell the show was alright, a lot better shows out there, but if you like heavy fan service, like girls with animal ears (fox and wolf mostly) then you'll enjoy this. Just don't expect something akin to Shakespeare, want a good laugh (taking the male lead with a grain of salt), and don't mind naughty bits then you'll get your money out of this.",1302652800,4,1379,4.556451612903226

5088559,5,B007I1TGOA,"Kanokon is an anime based on a manga and light novel series of the same name. The story involves a boy who transfers to a new high school, only to fall in love with a girl who's also a supernatural being (fox spirit)! Sounds familiar doesn't it?

Despite its cliches, it is pretty funny and  has its heart-felt moments. It's a romantic comedy that filled with ecchi humor and has relationship obstacles  that the main characters have to overcome.

The anime follows the manga rather well. There's plenty of memorable moments and characters that you would remember from the original story. The anime has its own unique moments, while also honoring the most memorable events from the manga/light novel. The animation is pretty good for this kind of anime, and the music is both fitting and AWESOME!

The OVA collection is FAN SERVICE, FAN SERVICE, FAN SERVICE!! You either love it or hate it!

I first saw this anime on CrunchyRoll and I enjoyed it right away. I would highly recommend it to any fans of supernatural/ecchi anime. If you liked Rosario+Vampire, High School DXD and Sekirei, then you will definitely like this anime!

My only disappointment is that there was some potential for a second season but there was never a follow-up on that idea. The manga is now finished, and I also recommend the manga, especially if you like this anime.

Why is she saying kouta will be only hers when he is devoted to chizuru completely. The second question i ask myself ""Is kouta a full human or is also a youki fox that thanks to chizuru has been awakened"" i guess you will have to be the judge of that.

Okay, let me summarize: Big breasted fox demon who tries to have sex with the shot boy every day, even in public. Flat-chested monotone-speaking wolf-demon who is equally flirtatious and closer to his age who is okay with being the one he ends up cheating on her for in the future. Tons of panties, breasts, cleavage, and also... there is a photo gallery. The photo gallery is amazingly ecchi! This anime is very sexy and fun to watch. Also, I laughed very hard many times while watching it. The ending could have been done better, but I won't rate it any less than five stars.

5088588,2,B007I1TGOA,"Japanese anime mixes humor with sexiness very often, which I like a lot a bit often. ""Kanokon"" is one more of these series about  a beautiful girl(s) in crazy love of total wimp, to the point of willing to become his servant(s). Kanokon is quite comic at the beginning with the girls teasing and chasing this wimp, Kouta. However it also gets serious shortly after the first chapters when his main chaser, Chizuru, gets quite stressed and miserable because of Kouta's confusing attitudes: he recognizes Chizuru's love at times and at others he's dismissive in his typically infuriating nice ways covered-up with his smile. For example, he rejects to introduce whichever relatives of his to Chizuru. But the very worst is rejecting Chizuru's love-making offers like if they were pure poison, you couldn't believe how repulsively feminine he cried when covering Chizuru's vagina while shocked in terror.

Besides making me laugh, the show left me thinking. To start with, Kouta -like any man- had as much right as any woman to refuse any proposal, regardless of how hurt his prospects get and likewise she must be incarcerated if she forced him. However many men may well disagree with me.

At least what is clear to me is that while ""pervert"" is mentioned all the time in this type of anime when a man simply likes women (a totally natural thing) the real perversion in these Japanese programs is righteous guys rejecting forbidden love, sex & simple company that normal people want; righteous guys who somehow do accept their prospects services, like their food offering. At the end, the biggest perversion is this whole fantasy of getting someone highly  desirable begging to a worthless wimp, just to be rejected by this wimp being so righteous when in fact the very reason he (or she as well) rejects is because of: (A) being a wimp,(B) crazy, (C) stupid or all of the above. In any case I think Kanokon stands out above the rest in these traits, with the truly nice exception that the ""nice"" guy doesn't keep yelling the whole time, but that's due to his outstanding wimpness.

Finally, if you want to see sex skip these programs and instead go to some porn rental shop. Ironically anime seems to have more sane options in porn than in these types that I don't even know how to classify. The only 3 porn anime shows that I chose to rent showed healthy relations that either continued `til marriage or finished their deal, nobody insanely after some moron. There weren't comic though.",1365465600,3,2487,4.787878787878788

5088620,3,B007I1TGOA,"Figured I should start the review with this disclaimer/warning, so that you know exactly what you're getting with this show. Definitely not a show to recommend to kids.

Warning, this show is very HEAVY on ecchi content (think girls wearing very revealing outfits, if anything at all), with a lot of allusion towards sexual content (though it never happens, although the included OVA does get really close to it). In fact, the main heroine, Chizuru, constantly tries to force the main hero, Kouta, into doing naughty things with her almost once an episode, but he largely resists it. If you're not into that type of stuff, this show may not be for you. There is a lot of comedy in this show as well, but if you don't want to deal with the ecchi elements, you may want to try another anime.

Story-wise, this is a show about a boy, Kouta, who is attending a high school where some youkai (Japanese word for demons) also attend, mainly to learn about human life and culture so they can adapt and live in a world dominated by humans. He runs into Chizuru almost immediately, and she becomes obsessed with him almost instantly. He later finds out that she's actually a 400 year old kitsune (Japanese for ""fox""). Throughout the series, he learns to handle her antics, as well as those around him, including a second girl also attempting to get into his pants, Nozumu, who forms the other part of the love triangle in this show.

Aside from the previously mentioned ecchi, this show is mostly slice-of-life, which shows the character's everyday lives and how they go about it, along with lots of fantasy and comedy thrown into it. Some battles do take place, but most of the violence is largely cartoonish and mostly meant to be funny. Overall, it's not too the greatest nor most memorable anime ever, but if you like ecchi material, this show delivers it in spades.",1347235200,6,1860,4.64741641337386

5088622,3,B007I1TGOA,"So while searching for some new anime to keep me occupied while in Afghanistan on deployment I came across this and almost jumped out of my bunk. After falling in love with Spice and Wolf, I had high hopes that this would be similar. The moment I saw her fox ears/tail I melted like an ice cube in this 110F heat. However, the cost ($75?!) for a single season kept me at bay. A friend offered me a look at it via a download(Bad, I know, but that's not the issue here.) and I have to say I am very glad I did not drop the cash on this.

Pros
The animation quality is amazing.
It has more ecchi than ANY anime I've EVER watched (including Girl's Bravo...) and sexual banter(there is no innuendo ""gently knocking"", they kick down the door) but still manages to be adorable.
When Chizuru goes ""Fox""(which is FAR too rarely imho) it is an instant ""squee"" moment. You want to squeeze her forever. She is adorable.
Nozomu is the definition of cute. She is similar to Primula from Shuffle!(if you don't know her, you should get that series!) in that she is very quiet and speaks matter-of-factly all the time.
The side-cast of characters are amusing and enjoyable.
The story (from what I've seen in 7/12 episodes) is pretty good. I find little to complain about in that department.
The comedy in this is great; I've laughed almost every episode which is such a nice feeling over here.

Cons
As mentioned before, the ecchi is almost overwhelming. At times it's fine but it gets tiresome occasionally and you find yourself asking ""Really?"". There's just too much desperation and while EVERYTHING about this anime is fictional, this is the least believable.
The main character, Kouta, looks like a 9year old. He also acts like a 9year old. Sometimes I want him to get struck by a vehicle.
Chizuru is a little TOO pushy sexually. In ever anime I've watched so far, even the most bizarre characters were believable; she is not.
Dubs. Usually I watch all anime dubbed (back home I watch on my TV while working/writing/playing a game on my laptop. Can't JUST watch a show and here in Afghanistan I find I'm just not in the mood to read while trying to watch). I watch it a second time in Japanese to get the whole feel but never the first time if possible. However I am finding it horrible I don't have a Japanese version because the voices are UNBEARABLE! I almost quit the series in the first 10 minutes because I felt the urge to ram glass pipes in my ears and shatter them to avoid the noises these characters make. The voices are TERRIBLY done in EVERY way! They are either nasally, overly high-pitched, sound like a man talking for a woman or a woman for a man, don't fit the person, or just sound flat and boring. I pray the Japanese voices are better but these English ones are a monstrosity I'd be ashamed to associate with.

Plot 7/10 (this seems low, but that's really good considering the only 10 I'd give is to Angel Beats! and Clannad)
Animation: 8/10 (a little too many of the sketch-faces, the term eludes me, for my taste but the coloring and shading is beautiful)
Characters: 6/10 (against high standards, still not bad)
Voice Acting: 0/10 (English. I can't even give it a 1. Japanese I do not know)
Overall: 5/10 (funny enough it even adds that way through averaging! but that is a coincidence. The show is good, not amazing, but definitely one to be enjoyed at least once)",1339977600,,3377,4.487804878048781

5088637,5,B007I1TGOA,"I love the series. The show kind of reminds me of the Negima! series and how it has the two female twins of comedy. I thought that it was going to be a bad series at first but, as i watched it the results showed that it turned out not to be as bad as I thought. My top 3 favorite episodes of the series are (1)"" Eat Deliciously."",2) ""Can you feel it?"", and (3)""We can finally do it."" because of the way it shows the love triangle plot between two girls fighting over the boy they love and finally in the end of how they compromise in sharing him in order to make their relationship work. I wish that the show had more episodes to continue of what happens after words but, its just the way it is. I love Mona Marshall and her work as an anime actress in her roles as young male characters in anime series like Izzy from the Digimon Digital Monsters series. The one question that I have about the Kanokon OVA episode specials is that does it continue where the final episode left off or, does it go off in a completely different direction? I hope that the filmmakers that made the anime series make a second season for the show if they did that would be great. I don't recommend this show for young children under 16.",1327536000,,1215,4.174468085106383

5088644,5,B007I1TGOA,"The quality and humor from the series are back in this two ""EXTRA"" episodes, the same characters, the same quality in animation, same innuendo, and same questionable humor.  Something that is very notable in these episodes is its narrative style, which makes it completely different from the original series, it's very random but it's also enjoyable and there's nothing to hate about it, we also get to see the lovable Nozomu in her Eve's costume, Yuki's weird obsessions, the ninja hunting skills and in the second episode we learn that Kouta is just a boy trapped in a closed (because he is unable to satisfy Chizuru).

Pros:
- English and Japanese audio.
- Opening and ending themes.
- same Top-notch animation.
- Same lovable characters.
- Better ending than the final episode from the series.
- OVA shorts.

Cons:
- Not enough Nozomu.

If you love the series then of course you'll enjoy these two extra episodes and its shorts, after all it is a very rare gem in the world of what's known as ecchi, however if you are not into ecchi anime DO NOT WATCH IT because is not for everybody, and sadly that's it, only two episodes of what could be the beginning of a new season, BUT there are no plans for a second one yet, so I think these episodes work more as closure to the series.  5 out 5",1308182400,23,1292,4.480851063829787
5088645,3,B007I1TGOA,"First let me say that the description says only Japanese language, but the copy I got had duel language with english in there also.

The other descriptions that were in here I agree with to so no sense in doubling up the same story's.

another thing to add is during the show, I think that they made too drastic of changes at times to the actions of the characters and the way that they did things. to give an example, Kota in one episode is still shy and is still complaining about chizuru shoving his head into her breasts, then the next episode he does not mind it and is asking for it and most of the shyness that he has shown through the show was gone. It does the same thing later on when chizuru goes from not caring about anybody seeing her affection for kota in public and constantly grabbing at him all the sudden the aggressiveness stops and they are suddenly boyfriend and girlfriend. I think that they should have made the transitions over several episodes and not as sudden.

One thing that I think that the series does need is a second season. At the end, they left a lot of questions not answered. Like there was this girl that was after kota, and she called him big brother, but they never really said if she was actually related or not. This girl also never really met face to face with kota in the show either. also, kota showed signs of intense power at the end that came from him, and the girl said soemthing about him being awakened, but there was no description about any of that either. there was just too any unanswered questions at the end that I think that they should have made a second season to answer them. The best way i can explain the way that it ended is if you ever watched Tenchi Muyo OVA series, it left unanswered questions about the same as this show. Just looking at the original 13 of tenchi that is. I have not seen the ova's yet so maybe they are answered in there. I don't know but will find out when they finally release the OVA's in a little over a month.

Overall, it was a decent show and definitely worth watching. It would even be worth re-watching a second time, just don't expect a show that answers all questions because the show leaves a lot of questions at the end.",1304812800,,2221,4.293556085918855
5088646,4,B007I1TGOA,"I am not going to go over what has been said before.  I thought the story was a good premise, yokai (spirit creatures) living in our world and mostly blending in.  The story of a young man being pursued by a sexy fox girl and a young wolf lass and being exposed to that world, and all the dangers and rewards that go with them (the insults and banter between Chizuru and Nazomu always livens things up).

This is a HIGH level Ecchii series, so not for younger kids.  It does toe the line between Ecchi and light Hentai, and a couple of times might put a toe or two over (disc three Girls Channel about Chizuru's mother and the snow girl is a prime example)but never crosses it which is a good thing.  Now I would not call it a real harem comedy (Tenchii, Dual, and Kampfer being prime examples), since there are only 2 girls pursuing our hapless lad (well three if you count one who appears near the end but never reveals herself to him so i do not think she counts.  But the characters are full of life and actually interact well together, both mundanes and yokai (my favorite is the little frog girl).  There are some holes in the story and the ending could have been better, but overall I loved it and will keep it in my collection and watch it again if there is ever a hole in releases ,or need to have something to watch while I am on the treadmill.  The only bad thing was when i got it, the disk holder was broken and the disks were lose (but none were damaged, thankfully).
