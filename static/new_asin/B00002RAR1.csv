7916137,5,B00002RAR1,"That Girl (ABC 1966-71) is fun to watch.  Ann Marie (Marlo Thomas) is beautiful and she is smart. She is an aspiring actress in New York City who has a decent relationship with her boyfriend, Donald Hollinger (Ted Bessell). Her uptight father (Lew Parker) gets upset with his grown daughter, but he just wants what is best for his girl. her mother (Rosemary DeCamp) tries to smooth things over. Bernie Kopell and Ruth Buzzi appeared as neighbors.  The series is okay for children to watch too. You never see Ann and Donald in bed togther.  Donald and Ann are friends we would have liked to have had.  You will dig the 1960's mod clothes. Very fashionable.
  According to a book, Marlo Thomas and Ted Bessell were in early talks of doing a That Girl tv-movie reunion before Bessell had died unexpectedly, October 6, 1996 of an aortic aneurysm. He was also going to direct a ""Bewitched"" motion picture (his version never happened).

7916138,5,B00002RAR1,"I just loved this video! It was my first time seeing this series since I only got TV Land in 2000. First of all, these videos were in marvelous condition, uncut and all! I never once encountered shaky video or bad sound. Hands off to Anchor Bay Entertainment!
The three episodes in this volume (""Among My Souvenirs"", ""A Tenor's Loving Care"", & ""The Mating Game"") were all fabolous! And Marlo Thomas has that famous flip hair style....which made the female audience flip over the style! And in the second episode on this tape, we get to see the late Carroll O'Conner in a pre-Archie Bunker role, as an Italian tenor.",1008720000,,615,4.6
