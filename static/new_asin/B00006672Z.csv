7961710,5,B00006672Z,"I recommend buying from this seller.
I am glad to see that the 4:3 or original version of DBZ is still sold.
Here the english voices are not re-dubbed ( they re-dubbed the voices of majin buu in the orange brick version which is cropped, etc), and the disc offers the original japanese cast.",1392940800,,291,4.407407407407407

7961713,5,B00006672Z,"On this DVD feature, you have a whole lot of fihgting. It starts off with Vegeta getting his ass kicked like the dumbass that he is, as if. If he were to fight Cell while he was still in his second stage, none of this would have happened. While Vegeta was busy getting his retarded ass kicked, Trunks started to power up and save his father from death. In the middle, we learn a lot about Trunks and Cell and from the worlds that they've came from. After that, Trunks was starting to look good while he was fighting Cell, until he started to power up so much that it makes it hard for him to gain any sorts of speed as Cell said. then, Cell announced that he would revive the World Martial Arts tournament called the Cell Games. who has the [guts] to step up to the plate. Can Goku and Gohan, who just turned super saiyan, make a difference in Vegeta's mistake? Watch the beginning of the Cell Games Saga to find that one out!!!",1055462400,2,928,4.219101123595506
7961714,5,B00006672Z,"This is an exciting DVD that contains the last 4 episodes in the Perfect Cell Saga. You should get this! Get this DVD if you are a fan of Trunks or Cell, because these episodes are centered around their great fight. This has Future Trunks' best fight in my opinion. You can watch all the episodes in Japanese w/ English subs if you want. Here are the episodes:
Trunks Ascends
Cell first uses his power, Vegeta getting a beating he deserves so Trunks has to step in against Cell, and hmmm...Goku lighting his hair on fire.
Saving Throw
Trunks has to save his Dad's life and try to defeat Cell at the same time by himself.
Ghosts From Tomorrow
Trunks doesn't want the future to be as bad as it is in his time, so he tells more about what the future was like before Trunks went back in the past, and we learn more about Cell's origin. After that, Trunks and Cell face off.
The Cell Games
Trunks is stronger than Vegeta, but There is one weakness that Trunks has and Cell exploits it. Cell gives Trunks a second chance and will start a tournament called the Cell Games.",1043798400,,1065,4.33
