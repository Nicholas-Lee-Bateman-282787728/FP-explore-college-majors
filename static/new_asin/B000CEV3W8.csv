2460406,5,B000CEV3W8,"this is going to be an awesome dvd with daniels ultimate x challenge and hopefully some of his best title defenses hopefully it will show his wars with amw and a couple of his other ulitimate x matches than this dvd would be perfect this is going to be a must have tna dvd it might even be better than the a.j dvd if they do this dvd right.

so in closing just get this dvd i know i am.",1133395200,,386,3.825
2460422,4,B000CEV3W8,I cant believe that they gave the Falling Angel only one disc!!! This is a shame!!! Also why do we have to pay as much for a single disc as for 2 discs!!! I don't understand why TNA would cut the matches and Amazon wrote that the DVD is 240 minutes long!!! is that true!!! Also the cover make you believe that it's a double disc DVD!!!!,1138233600,,336,4.029850746268656
2460423,4,B000CEV3W8,"This is a reply to that review that said that TNA sucks and that it's a place for guys that couldn't make it in the WWE. Well no, it's not only for wrestlers...that were wasted in the WWE, it's for wrestlers that are also too good for the WWE. Christophers Danials  had short stays in both the WWE and WCW and he wasn't used properly in either one. He was on the WCW roster for many months without being used and when he was used, the match got interfered in and he got beat up. In the WWE, he had one match on one Jakked Metal episode where he was just used as a jobber in a tag match. I think Kurt Angle actually wanted him in the WWE and put in a good word after Christoper Danials impressed him in a none WWE match the two took part on. The WWE only knows how to use talented wrestlers if they can either work the mic or they fit in angle they have planned.

  Look at how RVD and Chris Beniot are used, they are 2 of the most talented people there and they get booked to lose more matches than they win. Beniot breaks his ass every week to put on a great match and is it appreciated ? No. They rather push John Cena who they just use because they wanna reach fans that like rap and not because he can actually wrestle. As for Batista, he runs out of things to say, so he just throws out Eddie's good name when he needs a pop and it's pathetic. Beniot knew Eddie a hell of a lot more and he barely ever gets to even talk about him. In TNA, wrestlers get pops by actually wrestling and putting on a good show. In another words, TNA is a place where guys like Beniot and RVD would actually get appreciated and used properly. In TNA Beniot would be pushed and get to talk about Eddie on tv as much as Rey and Batista get time to talk about Eddie.

  I mean look how Christian is being pushed now. In the WWE, he was upset that he wasn't getting pushed anymore. He went to talk to Vince about it and Vince derespected him after all the hard work he put into the company. Christian then left and went to TNA...wisely and in his debut he called the WWE tired and old and he's right. Vince gloats on camera but he's making all the mistakes that WCW made before it went off the air. That mistake is that he's too confident and he doesn't resepect all the hard work the wrestlers put into his show. Christian and Matt Hardy are proof of that. If they cared about their workers, the whole Lita/Edge thing wouldn't have became angle.

  The WWE has tried to get wrestlers before TNA could. They heard they were interested in Samoa Joe...so they tried to get him. Joe chose TNA over the WWE which could give him more money. It was a wise choice too because I'd hate to see how much he'd be wasted there. Probably as much as Tajiri was wasted. Anyway Christopher Danials may not have the great shape of Batista but he puts on way way better matches. Just check out his Iron Man match with A.J. Styles for instance or any other match on this dvd. He's a big star in the WWE he'd just be used as a jobber, not because he's not good enough to make it there but because he's too good for the WWE. A.J. Styles would probably be used so badly that he'd have to become a commentator eventually like Tazz lol. Plus, no one in TNA has to marry the bosses daughter  just so they can push themselves to be champ more times than Ric Flair. They earn their spot by putting on good shows and being appreciated for all the hard work. If only the WWE was still like that....if it ever was. Vince did screw Bret after all his hard work after all....",1138147200,3,3523,4.1061046511627906
2460424,5,B000CEV3W8,"First off I just want to say that people who simply just go onto this website only to write a negative review of TNA and even those who do the same with WWE ones need to get a life! This is wrestling, why cant we just be a fan of it all? And respect what these people do when they get in there and wrestle. If you have nothing better to do than to come onto a review of a DVD and trash TNA then you need to seek some help. Anyways, onto the DVD now, this was a great showing of one of the best wrestlers in the industry today, ""The Fallen Angel""Christopher Daniels, he has what it takes in the ring, on the mic, and just looks like a star every time he steps in that ring or makes his entrance. That isn't a threat, or a promise, not even a fact, that is the Gospel, according to The Fallen Angel!

2460425,5,B000CEV3W8,"I got this last night and have already watched it. I will say that I am a little upset that it is only one disc and the matches are clipped(except the Ironman Match), but it reminded me of the old school Best Of Videos that showed the featured person's career in the company. All of his best are on here. It truly highlights Chris Daniels as MR.TNA. Just wish it would have been a double disc so all the matches could be complete. But it is worth buying. Truly a must have and one of the best TNA DVD's created.",1136678400,2,511,4.12
2460426,4,B000CEV3W8,"If I were Christopher Daniels, I would be a little upset that TNA gave Jeff Hardy a two-disc DVD but I only got one. The match selection is excellent (although I do wish they'd included the three way with AJ Styles and Samoa Joe at Unbreakable) but cramming it all one one disc means they have to cut and edit which is very annoying.

That especially comes up with the two biggest XXX/AMW cage matchs, even the Turning Point 04 classic. I don't understand why TNA would choose to push all this on only one disc as with two, you could have had the matches in their entirety. A shame as Daniels definitely deserves it with the awesome work he does. At least we see him hosting the program which is very good.",1136592000,,706,4.30827067669173
2460427,3,B000CEV3W8,"I pre-ordered the DVD, and I'm just curious if all the matches on the dvd are clipped. It would a real shame, because Daniels has had and continues to have some amazing matches. Thanks.",1136592000,,185,4.470588235294118
2460428,4,B000CEV3W8,"This is a great DVD that i found today in Best Buy because its not supposed to ship out to stores till tuesday but I have it 4 days earlier. Good DVD good matches but the matches are cut short so that sucks. And no Samoa Joe Vs. AJ Styles Vs Chris Daniels at Unbreakable the greatest match ever so that sucks. One DVD not 2 DVD set so that sucks the rest is pretty good.

How about a Samoa Joe DVD eh? That would be the day.",1136505600,,424,3.8181818181818183
2460429,3,B000CEV3W8,"First off, I would like to say that Christopher Daniels is one of my all time fav wrestlers.  I have followed his career since he was a developmental WWE wrestler.

The DVD, unlike other recent TNA best of's, is a one disc set.  There are loads of matches on the DVD, but all of them are clipped.  For instance, the match with Shocker at Hard Justice is only 6 minutes long.  The main thing that I dislike about the DVD is they clip the matches, but leave the entrances and the ring introductions in.  If you would have clipped them out, you could have shown more of the match.  Or, better yet, make it a two disc set like you did Raven, AJ, and Jeff Hardy.",1136419200,2,657,4.166666666666667
2460430,5,B000CEV3W8,"Having been a TNA Wrestling fan for some time, I've seen most of these matches on this DVD. If you have the Best of AJ Styles or the Best of the X-Division, this one will beat them both. Christopher Daniels had some of the best matches in TNA history, and they'll be on display here. I'm hard pressed to say which match is the best one, because all the matches here are just awesome. Don't believe me? See for yourself!",1134950400,,419,4.25

8098247,4,B000CEV3W8,like it because im a huge fan of tna plus the fallen angel christopher daniels. he is so awesome to watch in the ring and  even awesome to meet in person!!,1357084800,,155,4.0
8098248,4,B000CEV3W8,"This is a solid dvd. Christopher Daniels is a really great wrestler and this dvd has some of his best matches at that time in TNA. I really wish TNA didn't stop releasing two disc sets because there could have been more matches on this disc. They also could have used some of his stuff from Japan. Also, some of the matches aren't shown in entirety. Even though this doesn't have the things I just complained about it's still a great dvd and I would recommend it to any TNA or wrestling fan in general.",1205280000,,502,4.294736842105263
8098249,3,B000CEV3W8,"Daniels is an awesome wrestler but this DVD is far from it, here are my reasons

1. the matches are not even whole they are highlights and clips

2. it should of been a 2-desc set

the matches are still good and its worth picking up but they messed up on this one",1145404800,3,263,3.9245283018867925
8098250,4,B000CEV3W8,"I wasn't disappointed with this DVD, but I think so much more could be added. Daniels is one of the best guys I've ever watched in wrestling period. The team of Triple X was nothing short of amazing (And it documents the wars between them and AMW very well). But, I would hope to see a better Daniels DVD in the future. But still, this is good.

I'd also recommend The Best of A.J. Styles, and TNA Anthology: The Epic Set",1142726400,4,421,4.197530864197531
8098251,3,B000CEV3W8,"Don't get me wrong: I absolutely love Daniels. From his INCREDIBLE matches from ROH with Low-ki, American Dragon, Austin Aries, and others to his recent MOTYCs with A.J. Styles and Samoa Joe, he has to be one of my 5 current favourite wrestlers in the world. The matches on this dvd are good and worth the money... but they are not all complete, as noted by other reviewers. Now why on Earth would a worthless bump taker like Jeff Hardy get two discs and an incredible WRESTLER like Daniels only get one disc? Baffles me.

 Oh, and let me throw my 2 cents into the whole TNA vs. WWE B.S. that is plaguing this website's TNA reviews: It doesn't matter. They both do things better than one another on different levels. So in my opinion, currently, Tna and WWE are on the same wavelength. Even though I like WWE more, historically. And please.

 STOP USING THIS SPACE TO ARGUE, USE INCORRECT GRAMMAR, AND MAKE YOURSELVES LOOK LIKE TOTAL TOOLS. Because there are REAL wrestling fans, like myself, who come here to read REVIEWS.",1142121600,7,1023,4.573770491803279
8098252,4,B000CEV3W8,"Daniels, reputation does not due him justice. The man is filled with talent, I was very happy when my dvd came. What I was not happy about was how he was jipped. The Fallen Angel should have been given a two to three disk set. It would have been well worth the money.

 I would have liked to have seen more of Daniels.  The matchs with AJ are great and I loved watching them.  Low Ki and Skipper were brillant as well.

  Dispite my problems with it, I'm still happy I got it.  Would have waited however if I had known so many matches were cut short.  long time Chris Daniel fans will want to own a copy of this, because of the fact Daniels does intros on it.

 However if your looking for a real best of Christopher Daniels, head over to ringofhonor.com and you will find what your looking for.  No lies, stright up it's what you want.  If you want to watch Chris Daniels doing as only he can.  Head over and buy his dvds, on ringofhonor.com",1139097600,2,942,4.161111111111111
8098253,2,B000CEV3W8,"Before I get started, everyone writing about the whole ""it's one disc while Hardy gets two"" agrument should know that this 1 disc is around 4 hours long...the same length as all of TNA 2 disc DVD releases.

Now I see this DVD as a complete disapointment...it's almost a throwback to the older WWF Home Video's they would have on their wrestlers with the longer matches being clipped & the non-important short matches being shown in full.  Other DVD's such as Jeff Hardy's were filled with a bunch of filler matches from Impact while Christopher Daniels is one disc full of actual matches worth paying $$$ for and they're all clipped or real short except for the Ironman Match with Styles from Against All Odds & the Ultimate X match with him & Styles from the next month.  But that's not saying much since you can get that match & the entire Ulitimate X match (they cut out the elimation parts with Primetime & Killings beforehand) off two other TNA DVD's (Against All Odds [Ironman], Destination X [Ultimate X] & The Best Of The X Division [Both Matches]).

The only thing I can say positive about this is that the timeline format they had for this DVD was well done (his first TNA match to the union of Triple X to the wars with AMW to his domination of the X division).  And they went all the way back to the start of TNA in Nashville & not just start to their move to Flordia like they've done with alot of their DVD's recently but they really should have had more matches that weren't clipped complete.

Hope this isn't the future plan for other TNA releases.

BTW: Here are all the matches on the DVD since nobody else put them up.
