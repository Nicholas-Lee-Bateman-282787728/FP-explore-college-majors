8530656,4,B008UYM41G,"I can honestly say that I don't regret buying this. It's great to start a couple if friends on this series. I would say my biggest complant is at time the subs are horrible an make no sense! So I would have to pause the DVD and explain what was going on.
Other than that I was happy with this purchase! If you haven't seen Bleach yet for whatever reason, I would highly recommend watching it :)",1365379200,,394,4.12987012987013
