2829381,5,B000Q35RWW,"This is a great series, and my wife and I really enjoy it.

I've seen comments about people knowing that more seasons are available over in the UK, but Brit DVD's are Region 2 PLUS they're in PAL video/audio format, while here in the US we are on NTSC (basically, the width and separation of the video and audio signals differ, making it impossible to play PAL on an NTSC system and vice versa).

BUT...if you do a Google search for ""region free DVD"" you can find some stores which will sell you DVD players which don't care about the Region, allowing you to play Region 2 on an American system. Additionally if you look for machines with built-in tuners, you can get one that will convert the PAL output of a British DVD to NTSC, allowing you to view it on your American TV with no problem. I currently own two such machines, and my daughter has one as well (she did a college semester in the UK, and there are a lot of Brit shows she likes to see, in the original, as it were; i.e. ""Being Human"").

I currently have more than 40 movies and TV series sets of British TV shows and movies, which are Region 2 PAL, and I watch them anytime I like, with no problems! Just watch for the players with built-in video converter, and ensure the description says it will play on any TV. I just did a search, and they have a Phillips DVD-3980 Region-free, HDMI up-conversion to 1080p, for $48.88.

If you need more info, feel free to ask!",1294704000,5,1428,4.297397769516729
2829382,5,B000Q35RWW,"A VERY LAUGH-OUT-LOUD set of stories. This show began in 2003 and has been on an upward spiral winning direction since. Season 4 is no exception. The show is based on a female cop DS Sandra Pullman (Amanda Redman-`At Home with the Braithwaithes' 'Little Dorrit`) who runs the unsolved cases department from the basement due to a bad situation of her past. With no backup or budget, she recruits 3 ex-cops out of retirement. Pullman is blond, aggressive, a good-looker, likes cheap wine, with a wild private life, and bound to get the job done, one way or another. The 4 combine to solve the cold cases, but in such a funny way. Character study is magnificent in the writing of this show. It only gets better and better. It is still in production as of 2011. Will it last as long as Midsomer Murders, also yet continuing? It's as good.

The other quirky cops:
Brian Lane (Alun Armstrong-'Garrow's Law' 'Little Dorrit' 'Braveheart`) is over medicated with a great memory, and married to Esther (Susan Jameson-'When the Boat Comes In' & reader for many Catherine Cookson audio novels).
Gerry Standing (Dennis Waterman-`The Sweeney' 'Stay Lucky`) is a womanizer divorced 3 times, is this a problem? Yes
Jack Halford (James Bolam-`Beiderbecke' 'Born & Bred' 'End of the Affair`) lost his wife and now talks to her regularly at the memorial in his back yard. She yet brings him comfort and investigative success.

Subtitles. Shows typically have a great guest star. British Brilliance in Murder Mystery Crime Catching.

2829383,5,B000Q35RWW,"Series 4 is on pre-order here at Amazon for US release; I have the UK version. They're baaaack and as comical as ever. The series does a great job of balancing serious cold cases with the detectives' comedic antics, and viewers become involved in their personal lives. Each member of the unit has his/her own idiosynchrosies, but they work well together and care for one another. They make viewers care about them and the mysteries they're solving. Every case is solved in a unique way - not much predictability in any New Tricks series so far. Highly recommend for the great acting, writing and directing.",1279670400,5,606,4.780952380952381
2829384,5,B000Q35RWW,"On the cover, this group of detectives looks pretty hardcore. Yes, they are veteran detectives and take their jobs seriously, but you'd never guess the joking around that goes on behind those very serious faces. The crimes are serious, and the viewer is kept in suspense until the crime is solved, but we get to laugh along the way at all of their idiosynchrosies, the pranks, and the hard time they give each other. Every crime is a cold case, and they're all solved in a unique way - no boredom here. In fact, they use some imaginative techniques to get access to information. I'm in my thirties and highly prefer this program to The Closer and Law & Order, which can be very predictable. I've grown to really care about these characters, loving the top-notch writing and acting along the way. Can't wait until Season 7 is put onto DVD in the UK.",1279324800,38,848,4.512987012987013
2829385,5,B000Q35RWW,"Detective Superintendent Sandra Pullman heads UCOS, solving previously unsolved crimes from the past. Her team consists of three ex-policemen who for various reasons all opted for early retirement.

If you enjoy ""Midsommer Murders"", ""Pie in the Sky"", ""Foyle's War"", or ""A Touch of Frost"", you'll enjoy these clever mysteries with a minimum of violence, almost no gore and no sex scenes. The rapport between the characters is exceptional and their ages allow them to bring a fresh perspective to their work.

In the fourth series, the team tries to prevent Jack from making the biggest mistake of his life, with near disastrous consequences for all of them, and Sandra discovers that her colleagues have been less than truthful about important details of her father's career.

Series 4 consists of 8 episodes on 3 disks. This series is currently not available in the U. S. in a Region 1 NTSC version. These are REGION 2 PAL DISKS.

I am getting these DVDS through my public library here in Minnesota, but I recommend buying them to any readers of this review.  This show is the most fun program I have seen in a very long time.  Three older former cops work with a younger woman detective superintendant to solve cold cases.  Each of the characters on this show is extremely well-developed and, well, just a joy to watch in action.  I am more interested in watching this series than anything currently on TV here in the USA.  My favorite character is Brian Lane, a former alcoholic with a wonderful memory.  He also has to be on psychiatric drugs because of a chemical imbalance in his brain and some OCD tendencies.  The actor does a terrific job, making Brian's situation respectfully amusing at times and sad at others.  Well, this character is truly one of the all time best on TV.

Each character is quirky, flawed, and appealing.  The group investigates cold murder cases.  As a person of a certain age myself, it is refreshing to see seasoned grownups at work.

The shows manage to be serious, and comedic.  Lots of fun to watch.

This series has run on PBS.  It is well-produced, the sound quality and images are clean, and the stories do not insult the viewers intelligence.

2829457,5,B000Q35RWW,"My husband and I have watched all four seasons of New Tricks and find that the series only gets better and better. The characters continue to be fleshed out and the plots are quite good. This is a good series to use to break yourself into watching British detective series. While this is not hard edged as many of the other detective shows can be, it nevertheless never fails to entertain.  A must see.",1308787200,,402,4.4324324324324325
2829458,5,B000Q35RWW,"This may be the best TV series ever - in my opinion. If you have watched the prior three ""series"" of this show on DVD, then you know what I'm talking about and will immediately run out and get this set. Thanks to Acorn Media in the US, this volume (Series Four) is available in the US as NTSC format - it was released this month (June 2011). These were the episodes aired in the UK in 2008 but they don't seem dated at all.

If you found this set - and this review - without watching the earlier series, I highly recommend that you start with Series One and move forward. But you will catch up quickly. These episodes are like potato chips, you can't stop devouring them once you have started. (But these shows are healthier for you than those chips - or ""crisps"" if you are in the UK). Series One will get you started on the characters - Jack, Brian, Jerry and Sandra. They are the only ones you need to know and each has their own personality trait that makes them endearing to the viewer.

Now if you are a regular New Tricks junkie (like me) I'll make a few comments about this volume. I will not go into the plots of the episodes - they are detailed elsewhere, though I highly recommend that you don't read them in advance. Even when watching I skip the ""plot outline"" shown at the beginning. It's more fun to ""let it happen"".

While a few of the plots in this volume get a bit too confusing - I find it makes me play them again to see how the crime - usually a murder - took place. But these crimes are only there for the four lead actors to use their own unique personalities and expertise to work together. If there is an underlying theme here it is ""teamwork works!:.

One highlight - I won't say which one it is - has Jack and Jerry working together as a team and they do a terrific musical number! (Regular fans - or those who stay for the end credits - will know that Dennis Waterman (Jerry) sings the closing song of each episode (""It's All right""). Another great musical moment comes in the episode re: a woman devoured by her own cats. Listen closely for the famous pop hit by Tom Jones in the background. THIS is why the show is such a gem!

This volume ends with a fairly emotional episode that will stick with you for days after watching it. It's a cliffhanger. And I found myself saying out out: ""It's not fair"" for it to end here. But since the show is already into Series Eight on British TV, Acorn should be releasing Series Five soon. (I'm waiting for a date and will share when I know).

So keep on buying this series so that Acorn will keep releasing them. And ""Thank you Acorn"" for giving us in the US a chance to see one of the best shows on TV.

UPDATE! (6/29/11): Just got the word from Acorn that Series 5 due in September 2011 and Series 6 due in June 2012)

2829461,5,B000Q35RWW,"Season four (4) of this great BBC murder/mystery series has, once again, brought immense viewing pleasure to my life.  Season four (4) is simply superb.  Once again our not giving a damn about the rules team of retired detectives that are lead by a youngish looking Sandra Pullman (wonderfully played by Amanda Redman who appeared in ""Little Dorit""), solve some horrendous ""cold cases"" splendidly.  In addition to being a very good murder/mystery series, there is loads of humor to enjoy.  I just, very comfortably, sat back in my ""easy chair"" watching these older guys solve long-ago crimes wonderfully in Season four (4).

Let me emphasize that I adore this series and really look forward to future releases.

(Please note that the episode titled ""Nine Lives"" is really good.  It's all about cats eating their owner's corpse and greedy relatives--marvelous detective work and filled with humor, I loved it.)",1307750400,,909,5.101351351351352
2829462,5,B000Q35RWW,"One of the funniest and most eccentric new police dramas I've ever experienced; because one does not just view this series, it is an experience.  The actors protray characters that are so believable and full of life, while the directing is impeccable.  The drama is interwoven with such unexpected and brillant comedy as to mirror real life.  I have been sharing the DVDs with our neighbors who also find the series very special entertainment.  Thanks to the producers for bringing this wonderful series to all of us.  The series receives our highest recommendation, without any reservation.",1304899200,3,591,5.114583333333333
2829463,5,B000Q35RWW,This is an excellent series.  I've already ordered Series 5 and look forward to receiving it.  The cast is very tight and the interaction between characters is quite credible.  This installment introduces more complexity to the characters as we get to know them better.,1303948800,,269,5.068181818181818
2829464,4,B000Q35RWW,"Tone of show is enjoyable and doesn't take itself too seriously. For those looking for a cop show that is edgy or tries to be realistic (See e.g., American shows like NCIS, Criminal Minds)this series is not for you. Plots themselves are nothing to write home about. Also, the female leader is just barely an average actress, at least in this series. The actor (Alun Armstrong,) who plays the quirky ""genius"" with beguiling eccentricity and charisma (not too much) is excellent. When he is on the screen, the quality of the show is really enhanced (5-9 on a 10 point scale). Also, the lady's man detective is usually good. the third wheel is an experienced Brit actor, but his role is flat--as his acting.

I hate to be even moderately critical of New Tricks (t.v. or movie) that is better than 95% of the garbage that pollutes our televisions and movie screens. In the mystery/detective genre, a viewer might want to compare this show with Frost (in my opinion, a real stinker) or Inspector Lynley and Dalziel and Pascoe shows, both of which are mediocre at best. Actually, Lynely is just plain awful.  New Tricks makes the viewer feel better for having watched it.

Just for the record (so you can see where I am coming from), the shows in the detective/mystery genre that I enjoy and recommend are Pie in the Sky, The Shield, Midsomer Murders, House (sort of a detective show, but still by far best American t.v. show, except for The Wonder Years, which ended years ago), Cadfael, Morse, Rumpole (75% of Rumpole shows are good to excellent, whereas Midsomer is in the 90% range of good to excellent), Foyle's War (almost 100% high quality shows), the brief serieses-- Almost Strangers and Brtish Traffic (not American version with m. douglas), Due South, The Last Detective, a few DAvis SUchet Poirot episodes, Wire in the Blood, Enemy at the Door, the truly great Jonathan Creek shows, The Sandbaggers, (House of Eliot, the Duchess of duke street, Ballykissangel, Flickers, and the Canadian masterpiece Slings and Arrows the old american show Dobie Gillis, not detective oriented, but can't pass a chance to recommend these shows).

Finally, Veronica Mars, American series, which will not be everyone's cup of tea, but give it a chance, Kristen Bell is fabulous--charismatic--sassy, intelligent, awesomely beautiful (her father is very good but can't recall his name) (Yes, I admit to be poltically incorrect when it comes to gorgeous actress who can also act at a very high level). Again,finally, the 60's series Maverick with James Garner and Jack Kelly as low-key criminals who end up doing good deeds. And just recalled, the early Colombos with the fantastic actor, Peter Falk.",1303516800,,2684,4.905286343612334

Great acting, all the actors not only can act, they have timing so that the humor is truly humorous - you don't need a laugh track to tip you off that something was said that is supposed to be funny. The writing is exceptional - I hate that so many U.S. shows (and now more and more U.K. programs corrupted by us) have simply godawful writing - hoping that talented actors can pull something out of a hat - you need both good writing and acting and if you want both, see each and every episode of New Tricks.
