This has a great picture because Red Sun simply copied the HK DVD of IVL in Hong Kong after Celestial spent millions of dollars remastering these films. The DVD has poor NTSC conversion (meaning, it will look BAD on higher end TVs) because you can't do proper conversions of dvds from HK without the original materials. And bootleggars of course don't have original materials. If you want to support boots, and make sure that the U.S. continues to get very few quality kung fu releases, buy the DVD. IF you want to see the films, and not ruin their chances of being picked up here so all the US can see them properly, just get a region free player and buy the actual discs these guys copy. You can get the real dvds they make copies for the SAME price, so why not support actual people the work on these releases?",1161561600,4,890,4.4
