After an initial viewing, I've been waiting to purchase the Instant Video of this movie but after a few years I could wait no more and settle for the DVD.
(This being said, this movie is not for everyone.  My wife did not seem to be equally satisfied.)",1485907200,,379,4.463768115942029

8295843,5,B001E0PGIG,"I saw this almost a year ago on VOD, COMCAST cable was showing it. It was a remarkable funny film about a Young Man losing himself after his wife died from a accident in Rome as I recall.

It is very entertaining and I am looking forward to seeing this film coming out on DVD. I give it all stars for both originality and entertaining.

Bravo!",1222041600,,343,4.181818181818182
