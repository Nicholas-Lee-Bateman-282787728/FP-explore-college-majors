7445141,5,B015NLGXA6,Just saw the premiere and this is an amazing documentary.  Lots of live footage and interviews with Bootsy Collins and close friends of Jaco.  Very in-depth!  Worth the purchase.,1448236800,14,178,5.068965517241379
7445142,4,B015NLGXA6,"Much effort and work put into this. Enjoyed the interviews, especially Mike Stern. For Jaco fans some good insights and some never seen before vids. We know the sad story of the demise. Hope this will be fascinating for new, younger viewers. Can't help but feel that the interviews were incomplete until Pat Metheny himself chimes in. Conspicuous by Metheny's absence. Don't know his reasons, but I'm sure part of it may be the exhaustive rehashing the emotional story of this long lost friend. It seems a large chapter has been left out because of it, but Bob Moses helps some there. So my personal feel is to recommend it, although incomplete. Another lost genius. RIP JP.",1448150400,24,674,4.769230769230769

7445144,5,B015NLGXA6,"In 1987 a musician by the name of Jaco Pastorius died, having been beaten to death by a bouncer after a Santana concert.  He was only 35 year old but as we see in this documentary, left a legacy of musicianship, especially for those close to the industry.  The film is primarily the brainchild of Robert Trujillo who many will recognize as the bass player for Metallica.  He co-wrote the movie with Paul Marchand who is also co-director with Stephen Kijak.

The documentary follows Jaco (John Francis Anthony Pastorius III) from his childhood, chronologically from the mid-1950s to the time of his death.  There are plenty of home movies that provide a glimpse of his upbringing.  He was the son of a musician and a housewife.  The father was rarely home, so most of the credit goes to his mother.  He enjoyed music at an early age, at first with drums then other instruments before settling on the bass guitar.  We get some detail as to why he liked the bass, but the standup bass, not so much.

There are performance clips and interviews with artists he performed with such as Joni Mitchell, Wayne Cochran, Wayne Shorter, and others.  There are even more with some of his contemporaries and those that followed including Flea, Sting, Santana, Herbie Hancock, Bobby Colomby, Bootsy Collins, Geddy Lee and many others.  His children with 2 different wives are also interviewed.

Sadly, Jaco became addicted to drugs and alcohol in the early 80s which precipitated his downfall.  He was eventually diagnosed with a bipolar disorder and admitted to Belleview Hospital in New York for a few months.  Toward the end of the movie, Paco is asked if he had any advice for younger musicians starting out.  He said to keep an open mind, explore all kinds of music.  He joked he once even played for a country band.  He says he learned a lot and it was a great experience.  Highly recommended.",1499212800,,1883,4.703363914373089

7445149,4,B015NLGXA6,"I would like to say that a documentary on the best electric  bass player in world is long overdue. Should have been done over 20 years ago by the music industry. But the music industry stinks. I give it a B+ and not an A+ because it should have been better. In some of Jaco's last words (from the book), ""remember the good times."" It seems as though, more positive things could have been discussed in the documentary in the end. I was also disappointed at the fact that no Pat Metheny and ""Bright Size Life"" was not included in the documentary. I mean that album is in the Smithsonian now. I did enjoy looking at many of the home videos. The documentary does give a little more insights into his musical upbringing (listening to Cuban music on the radio while going to sleep in Florida). They seem to have another Weather Report concert flying around out there in the industry from a 1977 show, they show near the end of the documentary while the credits are rolling. They also seem to have the master tapes of the Havana Jam gig. I would love for CBS Sony to release the live show or DVD one day, but we know that will take another twenty years. They also have the master tapes of a 1983 Word of Mouth show that they briefly show. I wish they would have discussed more about his compositions and the hard work and dedication it took to reach the goal of him becoming the World's Greatest Bass Player. Also more rare videos would have been nice instead of what the usual Jaco fan has had for years and now you can find all over the tube. To correct Robert Trujillo who produced the documentary, who said, ""Jaco is punk rock"", Jaco was music (Afro-Cuban, bebop, rock, symphonic, classical, R&B) all rolled into one influence.",1491350400,,1724,4.421383647798742

7445153,5,B015NLGXA6,"Jaco tackles the life story of one of music's most famed and misunderstood geniuses. From his humble beginnings in Florida, to playing in predominately black clubs as a 14 year old, to being considered one of the greatest bass players of all time. The film is excellently done and scored mostly with music written by Jaco himself. Numerous enlightening interviews with music greats like Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock and Bootsy Collins. The editing of the film is very excellently done, allowing for music to play a crucial role in scene transitioning. It often uses cool elements such as super imposing different bits of old archival footage of jaco to create a cool sense of mystery and very visually appealing scene. Produced by Robert Trujillo, the bass player for Metallica, he brings a musicians touch to the film creating and filling the void of questions many musicians would like answered. Well it certainly focuses on Jaco's life, it also pays special attention to his musical genius and his playing techniques, with in depth review of his equipment and finger style. Truly a documentary that would be enjoyed by wide audience. A must see for music lovers and jazz aficionados a like!",1481587200,,1194,4.975

If you're not a fan, this may not be for you due to the lengthy details and a DEEP look into his psyche. However, there are interviews of friends and well known musicians alike who knew him. His life, studio experiences and behind the scenes are discussed here as well as never before seen photos and video.

7445221,5,B015NLGXA6,"At the time Jaco Pastorius was hitting his stride I was a Rock head listening to the likes of Gentle Giant, Genesis, King Crimson and similar ""Prog Rock"" bands so my head simply wasn't there. After seeing this documentary I realize I'd missed someone equally (if not more) important.

Here's the scoop. This film documents the life, career, and tragic demise of one of music's greatest (if not THE greatest) bass player and artist.

I was blown away by this. Partly because I entirely overlooked a true musical genius, but also because I saw him on at least one occasion (a TV appearance with Joni Mitchell) and didn't know who he was. This nearly 2 hour film is replete with all kind of footage. There are home movies of him beginning at a very early age as well as a lot of concert and studio footage. To say he was amazing is an understatement. I've seen some great bass players in my time but Jaco was unreal. Yes. He was fast on the fretboard, but he put a feeling in his playing I've never witnessed in any other bass player. And he had an fine tuned and subtle ear. He DID reinvent the instrument and turned it into much more than a rhythm, backup piece. You sense a frustrayion in him that he had ideas about his art that he simply could not realize.

There are all manner of talking heads here as well. His friends, family, fellow musicians and other bass players (Flea, Sting, Stanley Clark et al) who looked to Jaco as an inspiration.

If you are a serious music hound this documentary is for you. It's a great story containing some of the greatest music you will ever hear.",1466035200,,1585,4.417808219178082

7445224,5,B015NLGXA6,"A deep and heartfelt thank you to Robert and everyone at Passion for seeing this through. Jaco'S genius really shines through. Musical genius is difficult to understand, sometimes even for musicians and the folks who work with them. The music industry was in transition during the late 70s and early 80s from one driven and directed by artists to one hijacked by corporate greed. There is no better example of the challenge to creativity this type of environment fueled by commercial success can pose. Thanks to Robert and those responsible for this documentary for memorializing Jaco'S story. It will stand as a lesson to any aspiring artist of how difficult that road was during this period. Metallica and otherS who weathered that period stand in spite and in opposition to those unfortunate forces that destroyed the music industry during this period. BeyonD that, the message contained here and the secret known amongst artists and entertainers alike that although there is no substitute for talent,  it is no guaranty of success, is sad but true. The new digital music medium is thankfully helping greatly to change this. Thank you, stars!  =)",1465689600,,1149,5.042105263157895

7445226,2,B015NLGXA6,I absolutley love broadening my horizons musically & otherwise. There's really nothing better than getting tuned into something completely off my radar. It is with this enthusiasim I went into Jaco ready to have my mind blown & sadly by the end while I found his story tragic I didn't see or rather hear the genius everyone raved about through every moment of this doc. I believe his influence most certainly impacted a whole generation of up and coming bassists I just don't know why. This is just one of those times where I am sadly out of my league. This documentary is strictly for fans which is kind of alienating to outsiders but hey it's great that fans of Jaco finally have something to call their own.,1465084800,,710,4.5546875

However, it is worthy for any Jaco enthusiast because the bonus disc does supply a good dose of vignettes from musicians that knew and performed with him. Although I love the effort that Robert Trujillo gives to make Jaco's name significant in the 21st century, I would recommend Bob Bobbing's aural retrospective entitled 'Jaco Pastorius Portrait of Jaco: The Early Years 1968-1978.' Other than that, go and listen to the recordings he graced during his time on earth to get the essence of what this genius was all about...I just wish someone would release recordings of his work when performing with Wayne Cochran and the C.C.

7445248,5,B015NLGXA6,"I enjoyed this documentary very much. It has something for everyone as it contains at least some things you didn't know, nor have seen, regardless of who you are. My family moved to Fort Lauderdale Florida in 1955, a few years before the Pastorius Family.  Although Fort Lauderdale/Oakland Park and the rest of Broward County is pretty spacious, believe it or not, in the 50's and 60's it wasn't heavily populated. As such, you would run into people all the time. My first memories of Jaco are related to the outdoors as that is what you did back then. I remember Little League games at Holiday Park when we were about 8 or 9 and the basketball courts on the south end of  Fort Lauderdale Beach where all of the families used to cook out. We were not in the same circle of friends as he grew up on the east side of town, Oakland Park, and I grew up in Lauderdale Manors, about a mile from WRBD, which Jaco's brother Gregory refers in the documentary to as The Hood. Somehow, someone, had the insight (or at least the bread) to record some of this footage of life in South Florida back then. Even his first wife Tracy seemed to now something was coming and preserved Family Life at the beach swimming and playing Frisbee. This is some of my favorite footage as the young Jaco I knew was pretty quiet  and shy, not the Wildman some people think of. Peter Erskine, Peter Graves, Ira Sullivan, and others try to emphasize the difference between the Man and the Performer. The documentary actually has a lot of really funny content which is nice as I think everyone was expecting it to be sad due to his early demise. As far as concert footage, if you are a devoted follower, you undoubtedly will have seen at least some of these performances,
 but even I had not seen all of them. There is much video of Jaco on stage with full-length performances, this is a documentary of his life peppered with enough snippets to lure in even those who are only interested in his music. Which could include Jaco as he makes it clear that his primary concern was where he was playing next. It certainly wasn't on money management or business dealings, which contributed greatly to his problems. He knew what he wanted in his music (even if the Industry refused to listen) but he had 2 wives and 4 kids to support. One night I was at Musicians Exchange Cafe talking with Jaco's brother Gregory and Jaco walked in. He just kept saying ""what do they want from me?. Do they expect me to invent the electric bass, again?"" Less that 10 years before, people were sitting there with their mouths hanging open in awe, and now they sat with their arms crossed saying ""impress me"" The ""downfall"" portion, if you want to call it that, is sad, but he accomplished/contributed more in his time on Earth than the rest of us will do if we live to be 100. Jaco was a deeply spiritual and even religious sole. ( he was an altar boy at St Clemens in Wilton Manors)  The Bobby Thomas footage is very revealing regarding it being time to go. He started in Holiday Park and ended in Holiday Park. It would have been nice to have more in the documentary regarding the later days after the Twins, Felix and Julius (both very good musicians themselves) were born and the Jaco Pastorius Park which we helped bring to fruition just a few blocks from where Jaco grew up, but hey, it is still a great documentary of a simple yet very complex man who is still missed by many, including me.",1462320000,8,3440,4.419558359621451

I think I went into this movie wanting to see a movie about one of the most influential bassists; someone who stood the world of music on its ear. Unfortunately when making a movie about Jaco you cannot have a movie about his musical greatness without trudging deep into the world of his mental disorder. Whenever you discuss mental disorders you are trying to rationalize something that isn't rational, the pieces don't fit and I find it frustrating.

7445319,4,B015NLGXA6,"This was a labor of love by Metallica bassist Robert Trujillo on the life an career of Jaco Pastorius: ""The Greatest Bass Player In The World."" I enjoyed the film's making use of Jaco's voice for parts of the narrative, and t5he extensive interviews with those who knew, loved and asdmired the man.

Close friends of Jaco and his brothers I think provided the most insight into the man and his art; how he bacame who he was; his way of playing and his turning the electric bass into an instrument that could fully stand on its own was amazing. Jaco was a very complex character, and I felt that while some of the mythology was shed, sadly he was capable and would have brought us so much more had he not been shunned by corporate music and brutally murdered.

This film shows how the industry did NOT look out for their artists at the time (even now, actually), and bipolar disorder was still a relatively undiscovered illness. The interview with Jaco's eldest son is completely heartbreaking, and you see many people who are naturally  still very deeply affected by the death of a very talented, and tortured artist.

I removed a star from this because for the person first learning about Jaco, I honestly think listeing is the only way to go, and I had hoped for more concert footage of Jaco at length, and not from the instructional video he made with fellow bassist Jerry Jemmott, Kenwood Dennard and John Scofield...people can see that separately; if this is because a record company refused to release the material, SHAME ON THEM as they abandoned the man when alive.

Watch, enjoy, but LISTEN FIRST, read Bill Milkowski's book, THEN WATCH AGAIN if you don't know Jaco's incredible musical life force. Thanks Rob!!!",1453248000,,1721,4.685430463576159

7445326,4,B015NLGXA6,"If its nothing else, Jaco, a passion project from perhaps the worlds biggest Jaco Pastorius fan, Metallica bassist Robert Trujillo, is honest. Its an honest account because, not only does it chronicle the meteoric rise of bassist virtuoso Pastorius, it also accounts for his decline (he was diagnosed with bi-polar disorder and living on the streets of New York City and Ft. Lauderdale and even spending time in Bellevue Mental Hospital, before his death from a massive brain hemorrhage in 1987). At its core, Jaco is your prototypical biopic - directors Paul Marchand and Stephen Kijak offer up previously unseen home movie footage and rare family photos of Pastorius, and through these an intimate relationship between the bass legend and the viewers is quickly built. There are also numerous talking heads the likes of frequent collaborator Joni Mitchell as well as Joe Zawinul, Wayne Shorter, Pete Erskine, Carlos Santana, Herbie Hancock, Geddy Lee and Flea, who, as friends and fellow musicians, provide an insight into Jaco the man  especially todays well-known bass players, which is a nice touch. There's also plenty of decent footage of Jaco performing on stage and a bonus second disc in the package contains numerous 'outtakes, anecdotes and stories' to help cement the legacy of Jaco Pastorius, as if it truly needed to be. Its easy to tell that this is a true passion project and nothing is really glossed over or even missed for that matter when telling this story. This is a must for fans of Pastorius, a must for bass players and a must for all fans of music really. One thing is for sure  Jaco is not a fluff piece.",1451260800,,1632,4.866906474820144

7445341,3,B015NLGXA6,"The greatest bass player in the world deserves the greatest film production/documentary possible. This a collage of interviews and film clips of Jaco. Not a documentary.

No Pat Metheny, or a discussion of their collaboration on ""Bright Size Life"" the highly acclaimed jazz album that ranks with the all time greatest jazz recordings. No discussion of his days as a music instructor at Miami. No narration! Need I go on? If you're a die hard Jaco fan then it's a 5. If you pay 20 bucks for a high quality Blue Ray like I did and you get at best freshman college level film then it's a 2. If you are a Ken Burns Docu fan then it's a 1. More effort was spent on the cover art than thinking this film through. Look at professionally made films like the ""Wrecking Crew"" or  Glen Campbell's ""I'll Be Me"" or Pete Seeger's The Power of Song."" These are few examples of high quality work.

7445343,3,B015NLGXA6,"Being a long time fan of Jaco I was really looking forward to the release of this film. Unfortunately it was a disappointment and left more to be desired (Or at least in my opinion). I would like to say that without Rob Trujillo a film like this would of probably never come out. I have to give the man respect for putting so much time and $ into it. I want to make that clear.

The main issue with this film? It is just a little boring to be honest. Maybe its because there is very little video content on Jaco that is of high quality and as a result the creator pieced together what was available, I am not sure... Most of the film (excluding the home personal videos) are just excerpts from you tube videos posted by fans online that almost every Jaco fan has seen dozens of times. As a result of the lack of content, the film tries to tell stories related to NYC of Florida but with footage from present day. It comes off a bit cheap.

Second, the interviews. While there some very notable people being interviewed, it is very repetitive as they film makers mostly focus on the quotes related to ""How great Jaco Was"", without any real in depth or insight into his character. Again this is my opinion and I am sure many will disagree. It just seemed like the editing of the interviews in the film only focused on this single point and it just became boring. Why did the film makers spend so much time just trying to justify that he was the ""Greatest Ever"", I think that was a bit silly.

Lastly, there was very little in terms of his actual work at times. Since Jaco had a rather small body of work I would of thought there would of been more time to focus on the Weather Report years for example... Again it just seemed that so much of the film focused on what people thought of Jaco rather than his actual work.

One last note, although I have a lot of respect for Rob Trujillo in putting out this film, the final scene where he is playing the bass of doom with Metallica is just odd and out of place. I have no comments on Metallica or their music as although I am not a fan they are obviously very successful for a reason. With that said, the solo itself is just bad and a bit foolish. I am sorry but have to mention that. Why not take those precious minutes from the film and allow more time for the twins?",1450483200,41,2314,4.181614349775785

From the opening credits, to the perfectly edited home video footage straight from the Pastorius family, to the ending credits, it's all here for both the casual and devout Jaco fan to soak in and enjoy.  Although it may not have the story may not have a happy ending, this documentary offers the viewer a chance to celebrate Jaco's life and appreciate the great influence Jaco had on music.

Then, you also get a very well-made film the covers a lot of ground. The only thing that wasn't mentioned, however, that I feel is important, was that the common thread between weather report, RTF, and Mahavishnu  was Miles . Miles is really not mentioned much in the entire video. And I think it's a mistake to think fit any of this music could've existed without bitches brew, because so many of these major players Who are interviewed came out of that era before Jaco arrived on the scene.  Still, a beautiful job and Mr. Trujillo deserves much praise. It was a little hard to hear metal music coming out of Jaco's magical base now that he owns it, but at least it is being played, loved, and respected.",1450051200,13,853,4.642384105960265

7445350,5,B015NLGXA6,"The movie is very well made and very interesting to watch. Basically a biopic with lots of interviews with great musicians who have first hand accounts of the life and times of Pastorius. The movie features lots and lots of private mostly unseen footage. It's a movie about a very gifted and talented, but mentally flawed musician.

Yet, there are things that simply out of respect should not be in this movie.

You'll grimace traveling through Jaco's Jazz-fusion pioneering life admiring his dedication to music and getting to the point where you have to watch bob trujillo playing Jaco's original bass live with that silly metallica band, this is sort of an insult to Pastorius and all other musicians. Either that or bob is trying to prove that a vintage fretless Fender Jazz bass can be used to play whatever kind of music.

Trujillo deserves lots of praise for investing the money he made with metallica into the production of a biopic about his idol. But he should have remained a commentator, a number one fan and the producer. Looking stupid on stage repeating a basic riff 99 times as if it were a bass solo, and featuring said footage in the movie simply because he had the money to buy Jaco's bass and HAD TO plug his current band in the movie was really not a respectful tribute. Made as much sense as watching the brass section of an indie ska band playing with Miles Davis' trumpet and John Coltrane's saxophone.",1449619200,6,1426,4.650793650793651
7445351,5,B015NLGXA6,"What do the following musicians or musical groups have in common? Miles Davis, Metallica, Weather Report, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and Joni Mitchell.  Answer: They all recorded albums with - or were DIRECTLY influenced by -  bassist Jaco Pastorious, a musical genius (a word rightfully used when discussing him) who died (for a bar fight) in 1987 at age 35.

His story and his music are expertly captured in this new documentary  that played a lot of film festivals and is now on DVD. Even if you saw the film, youll want the DVD for the bonus interviews that more than double time of footage.

Produced by Bassist Robert Trujillo (from Metallica ) and co-directed by Stephen Kijak and Mr. Paul Marchand (why the Mr.?) the film uses lots of rare footage of Jaco at home provided by the Pastorious family members. These are mixed with lengthy interviews by the above mrentioned celebrities quite a few of who get emotional when talking about Jaco  who had emotional issues later diagnosed as bipolar disorder. I won't tell you much more here as it will weaken your enjoyment of the film. Its beautifully laid out in chronological order.

As I said at the beginning, there are bonus interviews and outtakes with everyone from Joni Mitchell to drummer Peter Erskine.  They are on a second disc in the package and this runs 100 minutes. The film itself is 107 minutes.  The 5.1 sound design is by Weather Reports Brian Risner.
You know how many people were involved I n this production  and how much music is featured when the final credits roll. They last almost seven minutes!

Anyone interested in jazz or rock will definitely want this DVD set. Or if you just want to see how a genius can take the bass guitar, remove the frets, and play complete melody lines solo, you need to see this. Yes, Jimi Hendrix was a genius too but his playing was one style, rock (and loud!). Jaco did it all.

Can I give this DVD ten stars? (I would if I could)

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

We do hear from Tracy, and Jaco's children.

7445353,3,B015NLGXA6,"It's unlikely any documentary, no matter how well intentioned, will fully deliver on bassist Jaco Pastorius's actual and potential musical talent, with the emphasis on the latter.  How much greater would Charlie Parker have been on sax if he lived into his forties or fifties?  Speculation or wishful projection ignores reality. The record of achievement is what it is, and it should be judged solely on its own merits rather than on a posthumous extrapolation.  With all due respect to Jaco's record of achievement, calling him the greatest bass player based on it is, frankly, silly when you consider the records of achievement by Charles Mingus, Ray Brown, Paul Chambers, Ron Carter, and Charlie Haden.  The hard-luck last years and violent death (at age 35) of Jaco should not cloud a proper appreciation of those five other bassists.  Like it or not, they were/are his superiors.  That said, Jaco was indisputably brilliant at his peak, and any further light, short of arrant hyperbole, that's cast on his peak music is welcome.",1449014400,5,1033,5.011695906432749

7445356,5,B015NLGXA6,"FINALLY, a documentary about probably the greatest electric bass player ever, the late/great Jaco Pastorius. The hour-and-a-half long doc 'Jaco' takes you from his earliest years to throughout his musical career, and ultimately, his untimely and tragic death in 1987. But along the way, the viewer is treated to absolutely breathtaking classic performance footage of Jaco playing with Weather Report and with Joni Mitchell. Also featured are revealing interviews with people who knew him best (his youngest brother and members of bands he played with), as well as such renowned bassists as Sting, Flea, and the gentleman who produced this doc, Metallica's Robert Trujillo. And what makes the DVD version of 'Jaco' a must-buy is that it is a 2-disc set, with the first disc being the doc, and the second disc comprised of outtakes and interviews that didn't make the cut. Some have called Jaco Pastorius ""The Jimi Hendrix of the Bass."" After viewing the exceptional documentary, 'Jaco,' I now see their point. Highly recommended.",1448755200,19,1028,5.198795180722891

8734083,4,B015NLGXA6,"Jaco reveals the man, his immense talent, and his pathetic demise. The deftly film mixes interviews, concert footage, and other biographical elements, such as home movies and photos. The interviews with the bass player for Red Hot Chili Peppers was unneeded, since this foul-mouthed, gap-toothed, and blue-haired character had nothing to contribute that the others didn't say better. Have mercy.

Jaco was a genius, who died young, and left an indelible mark on music. He played a fretless bass; used harmonics as never before on the instrument, and was both a virtuoso and a showman. He likewise wrote memorable music. He failed in marriage twice, was institutionalized for extreme bi-polar disorder, and neither his friends nor his family could save him. Some of the later videos are painful to watch, because Jaco is high and strung out. According to a good friend, he had a premonition that he would die at age 34, which he did.

Like many talented musicians, his life was a boiling mixture of greatness and misery, as Blaise Pascal put it. We have his music as a gift. We lost the man in a tragedy.",1518739200,,1103,4.830687830687831

8734085,2,B015NLGXA6,"Fans will love the home movie footage of Jaco in his younger days (some of him as a grade-schooler) and John and Mary (cute!).
Unfortunately, the style of this ""film"" is very sensationalistic, like a VH1 Behind the Music thing. Peter Erskine's comments make it seem like there was strife between Joe Zawinul and Jaco, and there really wasn't. They were good friends. Some footage of the Modern Electric Bass video is edited to make it seem like Jaco was lost and looking guilty (those who seen that video know what I'm talking about). Photos are also used out of the context of what is being said in the dialog (really stupid video effects are used on some of the photos to make things dramatic), overly dramatic musical accents, and key events went unmentioned (like Jaco falling off a balcony while on tour in Italy with Word of Mouth-- had some hemorrhaging in his head and this may have accelerated the bizarre behavior, which came after).
This thing spent way too much time on the negativity and hardly anytime on Jaco's music. Bill Milkowski can go F himself.
I wish this was done the way the Early Years audio documentary was presented.
I liked the home movie footage and the scores of music personalities that had such good things to say (like Sting, Bootsy and Herbie Hancock), but it was overproduced for dramatic effect. I mean, tell what happened, but tell the people of the real reason Jaco was given to us.
For someone whod never heard of Jaco Pastorius, viewing this thing makes it look as if he was just some failed dope addict jazz musician, and it certainly wasn't the case.
To properly show what Jaco was all about, I recommend the Trilogue and Weather Report: Live at Montreux 76 videos and listen to the aforementioned Jaco: The Early Years CD and all of that great music he played with Pat Metheny, Joni Mitchell, Weather Report, et al!",1515369600,,1858,4.633333333333334

8734087,5,B015NLGXA6,"Robert Trujillo did such a beautiful job of bringing to life the amazing and tragic story of Jaco Pastorius. My son picked up the electric bass for the first time a couple years ago as a 12 year old and also started learning about John Entwistle, John Deacon, and John Paul Jones. Now that my son started playing with jazz bands his interest has expanded and John Francis Pastorius III and his music is on the radar. I have shared this video with a couple other musicians and like me it brought them to tears at the end. The interviews on the bonus disc are truly a bonus and gave us some more bass players to follow, listen to and learn about",1508112000,,643,4.278688524590164
