6500112,5,B00LR1EC14,"I am a retired university professor. At 71 years of age and because I am also an athlete who has a regular training regimen and who continues to push myself physically, I have tried many things to offset muscle strain, aches and pains, and to maintain flexibility and strength, particularly as I age. In recent months have personally experienced many Hanna Somatic sessions and, after years of traditional chiropractic and various massage and yoga techniques, I found this method to be surprisingly effective and long lasting. I came to HS after Alissa initially worked on my thoroughbred gelding over two years ago.  He had a lame front leg that did not respond to any medication or exercise regimens and his previous owner was about to euthanize him because she was told he would not be able to be ridden. After the first HS session, his body changed visibly and his lameness was significantly diminished. He all but fell asleep during the session and clearly loved the releases he was getting. He and I have had many happy trail and beach rides over the ensuing years and the HS sessions appear to keep his path to complete soundness on a regular positive trajectory. HS is very subtle and very gentle so, whether you are an injured or aging human or horse, the movements can have remarkable results. As a scholar and researcher, I was an initial skeptic, but now do my HS exercises faithfully every morning or evening and my horse gets his treatments regularly as well. Old or young, physically sound or not, this practice is painless and remarkably effective.",1453161600,,1564,4.792592592592593
6500113,5,B00LR1EC14,"After my first Hanna Somatics session (on myself), I felt as relaxed as a deep massage after an hour in the hot springs.  I was never able to finish the first Hanna Somatics session on any of my five horses, as halfway through the session, each one would lie down and stretch out in the sun for a long nap.  Somatics helps the horse (or human) release chronically contracted muscles, which is beneficial mentally, emotionally and physically.  I highly recommend it for horses and humans.",1453161600,,487,4.705882352941177
6500114,5,B00LR1EC14,Can not believe the amazing results of the Equine Hanna Somatics !!! Training dressage horses professionally makes me very aware of any change in the horse. It will make you look into Hanna Somatics for people so you can improve as well as your horse !,1445040000,,252,4.5
6500115,5,B00LR1EC14,"It was very easy to follow the instructions on DVD.  I have been using this on a calf that has a nervous system problem, twice a day and I am also using a guy who is licensed in CranioSacral Therapy who has been working on the calf once a week for about 6 or 7 weeks now.  The calf is moving better all the time.  So we are crossing our fingers that we can continue seeing improvements....",1438560000,,389,4.025974025974026
6500116,5,B00LR1EC14,"I have been using the information I learned from this DVD to help with a hyper reactive, intorverted mare I have in training with me along with addressing physical issues and postures of my other horses. Before this mare came to me, she had broken someone's arm while they attempted to load her in a trailer. She would not be caught. She was 4 years old and had never had her feet trimmed because the owners felt she would explode on the trimmer. I now start out each training session with a Somatics session first and she has become calm, responsive, curious and engaged with anyone who works with her. Not just me. If she does become nervous about something new, I can reconnect quickly just by picking up all four feet, slowly and softly. What I love most is that the concept is so simple to apply and yet has such profound effects both on the mind and the body. I recommend this video to everyone.",1412726400,2,901,4.401197604790419
6500117,4,B00LR1EC14,"First I must clarify that I am working on my certification in the Masterson Method bodywork.  I think the DVD is helpful if you've never taken any other bodywork or energy training.  What I noticed most about the DVD is that Alissa seemed to do everything in almost a slow motion affect.  She lifted all four legs forwards and backwards then adduct and abduct 3 times each very very slowly and would bring the leg, head tail etc. always back to the starting point of the technique.  She worked on the neck laterally 3 times as well.  She did head up and head down 3 times as well.  She then worked on the tail of the horse and I can't remember if she did anything else with the hind end.  The horse was definitely releasing in the DVD and I'm sure he got a number of releases.  I think Alissa is just doing what other body workers do but in an extremely slow way and always 3 times each per body part of the horse.",1412035200,,914,4.182857142857143
8667786,5,B00LR1EC14,"This is a an elegant solution to many ""training"" and ""behavioral"" problems. Although it may look like other techniques it is at it's core very different. I too have studied other modalities,and have worked with horses for over 40years. IMO this get's to the real problem and allows the individuals systems to re balance. How beautiful is that?! No force. It is also physically easy enough for me to help my horse. Since I have had many injuries,aches and pains over the years now I do Hanna Somatic movements too. Read my review on Thomas Hanna's book. Thanks for sharing your wisdom and passion to help horses all over the world.",1522195200,,630,4.684684684684685
8667787,5,B00LR1EC14,"Equine Hanna Somatics is not exactly fun or exciting to watch  at it's best, it's relaxing ... to most who are not actually experiencing it, it can be increasingly boring.  Given the difficulty of presenting this topic to observers, this video does as well as can be expected.  But, be warned, you need to WANT to absorb the information for the video to be worthwhile as a purchase.

On to the topic  Equine Hanna Somatics.  This is a mind-blowing healing modality that really works for horses (and humans).  Although no single modality can reverse all flaws and problems, every horse can benefit from optimal use of their muscles and release of habitual tensions that cause postural modification (usually misdiagnosed as conformation flaws).  We would have sold a horse whose subtle, but cumulative issues caused his behavior to be too difficult for a beginning rider.  Because of Equine Hanna Somatics, we have the horse we paid for  and don't have to say goodbye to our family member.  Because of Hanna Somatics (the original human modality, which is briefly touched on in this video), we ourselves are both more balanced and energetic in everyday life, which translates to being better riders.

Again, this video is not entertainment, it's something you have to want to use.  Equine Hanna Somatics looks very simple, but it's very powerful when done correctly.  If you don't have a practitioner in your area (or if you need a solid source of information for an after-clinic refresher), this video is the way to go, and the money spent doesn't compare to the dividends reaped when you actually buckle down and apply the information.",1503532800,,1635,4.91970802919708
8667788,5,B00LR1EC14,"This is a wonderful DVD for introducing riders and professionals to Equine Hanna Somatics. The DVD is clear and easy to follow, and gives people the skills to begin making a real difference in their horse's physical wellness and movement abilities. I have seen Equine Hanna Somatics make some very powerful changes in horses in a very short time. As a LMT and equine/human bodyworker, I frequently recommend this DVD to clients who are looking for exercises and things they can do on a regular basis to help their horse.",1483488000,,520,4.788888888888889
8667789,5,B00LR1EC14,Wonderful video with easy instructions from the clinician and very helpful watching it done on  the horse clearly. Highly recommend!!!,1483401600,,134,5.7
8667790,5,B00LR1EC14,I have a 27 year old gelding who I use this program on & it makes a huge difference in his overall health & movement.  He had a serious hip injury a couple of years ago & we tried everything.  This system has helped him regain his muscle memory & strength which helps him with his range of motion.  During the sessions he relaxes & offers his limbs willingly so I know he likes the way it feels.  He has made such progress because of this wonderful & simple system!  Now I need to work on myself!  Thank you for helping me & my horses.  Maria M,1463443200,,544,4.02803738317757
8667791,5,B00LR1EC14,I found this video very helpful in my continued education and understanding of Equine Hanna Somatics.  I especially liked the drawings shown on the live video to help you get a mental picture of how a horse may be holding his/her self off of center.  I have had great results using EHS on my own horse and a few client's horses. When I got my horse she was very reactive towards many requests. I have found that the more consistently I practice EHS with her the more relaxed she is when riding.  She's  more receptive to me working with her on all levels.  I can't wait to try the EHS on two young arabs I have the benefit of working with!,1454630400,,639,4.24793388429752
8667792,5,B00LR1EC14,"I was first introduced to Hanna Somatics Education for Humans... I was amazed how much it helped me to create more body awareness and release tension and brace in my body. Then I tried EHS for horses. My gelding Gus was slightly pigeon toed. Something we usually think of as part of the conformation (not posture). My farrier was able to correct him during trimmings but within 3-4 weeks he regularly toed inwards again. After 3 sessions of EHS his legs are straight - and stayed straight. My gelding JB had trouble moving to the left in a circle and moving straight. After only one session, going to the right was easy, and the instructor asked me what I had done differently because we had no more trouble going straight!
Awesome product. You will learn from the DVD how to create a maintenance program for your horse that you can do by YOURSELF, and your horse will thank you for it. There is also a human introductory session included. An inexpensive, effective solution that will also create more connection and harmony with your horse!",1454198400,,1041,4.663043478260869
8667793,5,B00LR1EC14,"I am so grateful to have found EHS! As a trainer/instructor, I am committed to the pursuit of proper biomechanics for every horse-human team. Hanna Somatics is a unique and effective modality for achieving this. Moreover, it is the ONLY method I've found that has had a dramatic and lasting impact on my own personal horse--- enabling him to find both physical and emotional release from chronic patterns of tension. I am a believer!",1453680000,,433,4.864864864864865
8667794,5,B00LR1EC14,"I've been around horses for over 30 yrs and had my share of different body work/awareness done with my horses.  The sessions with Alissa were truly amazing!  Simple subtle movements and the horses transformed.  The before and after shots of their posture really impressed me. Longer necks, softer muscle tone and overall relaxation.
Following up with the DVD was essential!  Such easy to follow instructions and I found the same results.  I do not have any education in body-work per-say either!
The other extremely important side is US! After working with Alissa personally for human awareness I now see how important the horse and human side is!  Do it ALL!  You won't regret it!
