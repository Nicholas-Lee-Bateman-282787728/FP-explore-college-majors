3120903,4,B0013XZ6TS,"I enjoyed the dvd. As a massive Brett Favre fan, it didn't provide any new information, however it did provide some new information to me regarding Peyton Manning.
I think the dvd could've been longer and have more information about the QB's in it, but over all an enjoyable dvd to watch",1426464000,,287,4.538461538461538

3120906,5,B0013XZ6TS,"I love this DVD. It gives a great synopsis of the 3 best quarterbacks to play in the NFL. Brett Favre has set records that will probably never be broken not even by Peyton Manning.  Tom Brady has won 3 Super Bowl rings.  Amazon really delivered for me. Thanks, Amazon",1404000000,,267,4.32
3120907,5,B0013XZ6TS,"I rated this dvd as high as possible because it a well-done documentary,and very interesting and educating issue for the people interested in this theme",1379808000,,152,5.12
3120908,5,B0013XZ6TS,My grandson is a huge Peyton Manning fan so this was a great find as gift for him.  It's gets viewed daily I'm sure.,1371513600,,116,3.8333333333333335
3120909,4,B0013XZ6TS,"Quality review of two of the best to ever play the game! Brady does not belong in the conversation. Super bowls are not a measure of QB greatness-even if they were Legitimate, Unscripted games. Where would the Raider play-off Lie or the insulting Rams ""Super Bowl"" FIX...?",1354320000,,272,4.808510638297872
3120910,5,B0013XZ6TS,Great DVD for any football fan especially if you are a fan of any of these 3 players. I grew up watching and imitating Favre as a kid playing in my backyard and this DVD reminded me of why I was so drawn to him as a kid playing sports. He's just a kid who loved football and got a chance to make a living out of it. Great DVD cant wait to watch it again with my friends. 3 truly great QB's and all are legendary in their own right.,1327449600,,431,3.7472527472527473
3120911,4,B0013XZ6TS,"I bought this dvd for my dad who is a big Peyton Manning fan; but, he also respects Favre and Brady.  He and I watched it and we enjoyed the excellent photography and the action.  After watching the dvd, we both felt that these 3 QB's will go down in history as the 3 greatest QB's of all-time.  The only drawback is that the DVD was only 90 minutes long, which did not really allow enough time to cover these QB's accomplishments.",1299456000,2,431,4.2317073170731705
3120912,5,B0013XZ6TS,"bought this for my 11 year old nephew who is a serious football fan and has followed Favre for years! I understand this went over great, the entire family and friends watching it several times.",1257724800,6,193,4.542857142857143
