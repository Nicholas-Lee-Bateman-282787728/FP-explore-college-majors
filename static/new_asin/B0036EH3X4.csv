4076048,1,B0036EH3X4,"With the completely unsatisfying ending, this show comes to a disappointing whimper of an end. I am still in shock as to how bad it was. Right up to the end of season 5 it seemed that the story was really heading somewhere. The creators decided to take an ""artistic"" turn with season 6. They promised answers but really never delivered anything. This potentially could be the worst series finale in television history. They may have answered what the sideways world was (sort of) but a large part of what the show was about was NOT answered. It is nothing more than the creators and the network walking away from it all because they never had any answers themselves. It is a total cop out that they conveniently said, ""Oh, figure it out for yourself.""

Lost fanatics can try to defend this all day but the bottom line is they never really answered most of the questions they posed in the first five seasons.

The part I am the most shocked over is how many Lost fans are not even slightly disappointed at not being told anything concrete about what the goal of the Dharma Initiative was, what was Eloise Hawking's work, who built the temple and what was its purpose, who created the hieroglyphics, what happened to Penny and little Charlie, why did the others have such super-human powers, what happened to the children, etc. After six years of following this show so closely, paying close attention to names and places, reading everything about the mysteries of the island I could find, I am monumentally disappointed that there was not even a crumb of information given about these things. For God's sake, at least tell us the Man In Black's name!

I am glad so many people found the finale fulfilling but I and many others did not and feel very cheated. This does not mean we don't have the same mental capacity as those who loved it as has been stated many times today in multiple blogs. The bar was set high for this show and choosing to gloss over a great amount of details and being told that ""it wasn't important"" is insulting.",1274659200,36,2035,4.554644808743169
4076049,5,B0036EH3X4,"I cannot wait until my young children are old enough to watch the whole series with me so I can re-live the great time I had watching it over the last six years. This final season was satifying on many levels. If you like stories whose main themes are the importance of living in community, redemption, hope, destiny vs free will, and the triumph of the human spirit, you will appreciate the way Lost delves into them whole-heartedly. Some people felt the sci-fi/mythology elements were not dealt with logically enough, but I thought the story was quite coherent according to the rules it set for itself. For example, it was wrapped up much better than the Matrix trilogy or Battlestar Galactica. Lost is a compelling drama, with great writing, talented actors, gorgeous filmography and muscial score, and you are a better person for watching it.",1274659200,10,846,4.841379310344828
4076050,5,B0036EH3X4,After the show ended I was still thinking about the ending and what it really meant.  This is the first show where I really devoted thought to and I wasn't disappointed.  I like how even after the ending the viewer is left with questions and ultimately those questions give rise to personal interpretation.  Awesome series.,1274659200,44,323,4.836363636363636
4076051,1,B0036EH3X4,"I wish I could travel back in time six years and tell myself not to watch this show.  The writers kept me watching with intriguing questions, and many years ago I realized that I would either love or hate the show depending on the answers to all those questions.  What is the smoke monster?  Who are the others?  What is the Dharma Initiative?  Will Jack and Kate be together in the end?  Do Jack and Kate stink after running out of deodorant and detergent?  We'll never know, because the writers never answered any of those questions.  They summed everything up by saying, ""They all lived (in a way) happily ever after.""  I guess they figured viewers would be so happy that people got to be with the ones they loved in the end that we would overlook the fact that none of it made any sense.

Throughout the show, the writers inserted interesting books and references to great thinkers to make the viewer think an underlying logic would tie everything together and make sense in the end.  They even made me hope the story would ultimately prove revolutionary or revelatory.  Instead, it turns out they used all those pseudo-literary references to trick the viewer into thinking they were deep and powerful thinkers.  The writers turn out to be juvenile pranksters with nothing more to say than, ""Made you look.""  In the end, they said that reason doesn't matter.  Just believe, even if belief has no relationship to reality, and be comforted by the illusion.  We are supposed to be happy that Lost occupied 120 hours of our lives, and we should overlook the fact that all the questions remained unanswered.",1274659200,35,1606,4.682142857142857
4076052,1,B0036EH3X4,"When the series started with a literal and figurative bang, I told the wife that the series would end with everyone discovering that they had been killed in the plane crash. So I decided to tune out the series until the final episode. Can't say the sappy, lacrimose ending surprised. Most unimaginative finale since Seinfeld.",1274659200,24,325,4.927272727272728
4076053,4,B0036EH3X4,"When we last saw the ""Lost"" gang, they had set off a nuclear bomb so the timeline would be reset. Well, obviously things don't go so smoothly, or the series would have ended LAST season.

And it serves as the springboard for ""Lost: The Complete Sixth And Final Season,"" which serves as a brilliantly brain-twisting finale for this unspeakably weird series. JJ Abrams doesn't quite manage to wrap up all the countless plot threads he's introduced, but he does manage to provide a semi-satisfying finale for the vast ""Lost"" saga and its many characters.

In the aftermath of the nuclear bomb, the survivors find themselves being taken captive by a mysterious man (Hiroyuki Sanada) at an ancient temple. At the same time, the Man in Black begins seducing people over to his side, while Jacob's ghost works to get a replacement for his position on the island. And Charles Widmore has finally arrived on the island for reasons of his own, dragging a reluctant Desmond with him.

In another timeline (one where the island is underwater and nobody ever went there), the plane lands safely in L.A. But the fates of the people who were on that flight are still drawn together inexorably -- even though their pasts have been radically different. The history and secrets of the island are revealed, as well as why the people aboard Flight 815 were drawn into the island. And for the evil Man in Black to be stopped, one of the survivors will have to do something unbelievable.

""Lost"" has never been like other network TV shows, but the final season goes all out on the strange stuff -- we've got flashbacks to centuries (even millennia!) ago, two separate timelines, a large number of deaths, and the revelation that basically the entire series has been a yin-yang battle between light and darkness. The biggest problem: Not all the plot threads are neatly tied off, and not all questions are answered (why are the numbers BAD?).

And the finale is a rather mixed bag -- it's not entirely satisfying, but things end on a haunting, philosophical note. Disappointing as a sci-fi story, but very powerful as a personal story.

And the writers spare no emotion, wrenching out some truly powerful moments that mingle tragedy and pure beauty, such as the heartwrenching ""Ab Aeterno"" (in which we find out about Richard's past) or the painfully sad finale of ""The Candidate."" And hanging over every episode is the haunted feeling that something terrible is about to happen (""'Cause if you don't... todos nos vamos al infierno"") and that it will be epic.

I still find Matthew Fox's Jack annoying (I laughed out loud when Dogen started pummeling him) but Terry Quinn is brilliant as the ""evil Locke/Man in Black,"" a genial villain with icy eyes; Michael Emerson's creepy Ben is fleshed out to perfection; Josh Holloway's hatred, sorrow and pain are explored; and Yunjin Kim and Daniel Dae Kim are ideal when their characters finally reunite. And Jorge Garcia is, as always, the show's heart.

There's also some brilliant performances from the supporting cast -- Nestor Carbonell will break your HEART, Hiroyuki Sanada has a brief but excellent role, and Mark Pellegrino is eerie and a little sad.

""Lost: The Complete Final Season"" does not answer all the questions raised, and the finale is too oblique, but it does conjure up a brilliantly complex, powerful final arc for this unique TV show.",1274572800,32,3376,4.847222222222222
4076054,5,B0036EH3X4,"I quit watching ""Lost"" during season 3 because it got a little too bizarre, but about a month ago, I read in Entertainment magazine that Lost was rated one of the top ten tv shows on tv right now.  Since, ""Damages"", ""Caprica"", and ""Modern Family"" were also in the top ten and I love those shows-if you haven't ever seen any of those, defiantly check those out because they are FANTASTIC tv shows-I decided to give Lost another chance.  I started watching the show again at the very beginning of Season 4.  After watching the first few episodes in order to catch up with what I had missed...I was HOOKED!!!  I have watched both season 4 and season 5 in less than two weeks, and I'm almost completely caught up with Season 6-only two more episodes and I will be able to watch the new episode tonight on tv!!!  This is one of the best shows ever written..so many twists and turns...and I almost believe such an island could exist...I'm dying to know who Kate ends up with...Sawyer or Jack???  I want them both myself...LOL.  I strongly suggest you buy the previous seasons and watch this last season as well.  I'm sick to know this is the last one...and if you want a few other suggestions of some other good shows to watch...check out my list below...

1.  Damages...on Fx channel...many twists and turns...Glenn Close is FAB!!
2.  Caprica...another well written sci-fi show
3.  Modern Family...so funny!!!
4.  The Riches..only 2 seasons unfortunately, but a great show!
5.  V...I'm so excited it's back on the air!!!

Any suggestions for some other great shows would be fully appreciated!",1269907200,14,1587,4.67870036101083

this is where everything stars and will end ...

i know this show it might be confuse for some people but is not IT REALLY make sense I know they are some people don't like it cause  they are not into tbis show  to watch it  just because is too confuse but is not .... it will really will make sense at the end.

 but to me this show is  a unique show and one of the best shows  ever to watch  it really got my attention to it , I cant wait till the end of this show I heard some rumors that the end it will be sad but it will make sense to everything.",1269561600,9,613,3.6538461538461537
4076056,5,B0036EH3X4,"I have never been addicted to a show as much as I am to LOST.  There is no doubt that I'll get The Final Season, blu-ray or not.  Every time you rewatch an episode, you pick up something that you missed before.  I hate it when the hour comes to an end because I want to see more and more.  The casting is impeccable and everyone does a magnificent job.  I can't wait for Tuesdays (and yes, I have a life) to see how much more will unfold.  As much as I want the answers, I am sorry the to see the series end.  Start watching from Season 1 and you'll be hooked too.",1268784000,37,564,3.8947368421052633
4076057,5,B0036EH3X4,"The Sixth season of Lost is just like the 1,2,3,4,5 is amazing, questions are answers, questions are made, twists, mythology, love, death... Everything that makes Lost great. The Blu-Ray edition will be the tip of the pyramid for any Lost fan, there really is no point for a review section on this page as everyone that loves Lost has already clicked the 'Pre-order it now' button.

So i'll fill my review by calling out all the idiots claiming its 'Too Confusing'... these people obviously don't watch Lost like others watch it. 'Confusing?' do you actually realise your watching 'Lost'. If you want television that doesn't keep you thinking, buy prison break or desperate housewives. For the rest of us who enjoy the mystery and are smart enough to understand how the show works and accept confusing situations (Which in the end, we'll have answers for). Take this blu ray and put it on the top of your collection.",1267401600,25,916,4.7974683544303796

4076059,5,B0036EH3X4,"LOST won an Emmy (2005) for Outstanding Drama Series, and a Golden Globe (2006) for Best TV series (Drama). During it's run the series was nominated for approximately 254 awards, winning 56. The series still places prominently on lists of Best TV Shows of all Time (having held the number one spot on such lists on many occasions).

From Breaking Bad to The Arrow to The 100, one can easily see the influence of LOST on many other television projects. It raised the bar for character development, production values, and intricate plot structures.

When looking back on all of the TV shows I've watched, no other series has ever reached so deeply into my thoughts and emotions. I've never experienced anything else quite like it. It's an amazingly intricate bit of storytelling that supercharges the imagination.

I recently watched the entire series for the fourth time. I was quite surprised how much I still enjoyed the experience even knowing about all of the mysteries. A decade and half after its debut, LOST is proving to be a timeless work.

The first three seasons of LOST are an amazing achievement, but unfortunately it all begins to unravel in season four. What starts as an incredibly imaginative psychological drama/mystery devolves into comic book styled schlock.

The ending of season THREE is mind blowing and will leave your imagination running wild. If you stop watching at that point you'll probably conjure up thousands of amazing possibilities that are more intriguing and satisfying than what the writers eventually settled on. If you continue to watch, many elements of season FOUR (especially the ending) establish LOST as nothing more than a grand, somewhat schlocky sci-fi series. It could have been so much more.

Even considering the problems with the final three seasons, LOST remains my favorite TV series of all time. If you've never seen it, I highly recommend it.

4 stars for this season, but 5 for the entire series.",1525305600,,1951,4.966257668711656

4076069,4,B0036EH3X4,"The discs come in cardboard and plastic folding contraptions. The discs play fine.

Lost was a great series, although it wasn't an original idea. The Lost Islands, The New People, and Peter Benchleys Amazon are examples of survivor type shows that came decades before Lost. The New People is one of those shows that Ive wanted to buy on disc for years, but its never been available, and its not available to watch on Amazon either.

After buying the first two seasons of Lost, and liking it, I bought the rest of the series. I laughed at the crazy Jack character and some of his silliness, but overall the series was very entertaining. The ending didn't live up to the hype. Some reviewers said that Everybody was at the church in the last episode. Not true. Mr. Echo, Libby, Lucia and a ton of other characters were not at the church. The church was mostly empty. I think the church represented Purgatory.

If you're looking for good stuff to watch consider miniseries like The Astronauts Wives Club (2015), Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Frank Herberts Children of Dune (2003), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Manhattan (2014-2015), Return to Lonesome Dove (1993), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002) and The 10th Kingdom (2000), which are all terrific because they have clear beginnings that establish an objective, then strong middles and conclusive endings where the goal is achieved, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), Granite Flats (2013-2015), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Merlin (2008-2012), The Prisoner (1967-1968), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish.

If you like reading try some of my favorite fantasy and sci-fi authors: Richard Adams, Palo Bacigulupi, Suzanne Collins, Abe Evergreen, Diana Gabaldon, Hugh Howey, George Martin, Brandon Sanderson, John Scalzi, and Andy Weir.",1520985600,,2335,5.334239130434782

The time-traveling, and creation of the paradox (after setting off the bomb in the '70s) seemed to break the story into two separate time-lines - or alternate universes.  It finally started to look as though the actions they were taking on the island NOW was going to result in the convergence - the rejoining - of the two separate time-lines.  Their efforts were merging their consciousness into the new universe (where Charlie is alive and just meets Claire, but feels like he already knows her, and where Hurley and Libby meet again, but totally know each other, etc).  I was so excited, watching this for the first time, because I thought - OMG, they actually created an ending to this show that doesn't suck.  Then the church scene happened.  And ruined it.

The first season was good enough to keep hoping each season would redeem the last and was the only thing that kept me interested. Now after having seen the last season I can't even fathom how I kept watching. This was the absolute worst series I have ever seen. It is so bad there is now way to explain anything about it. There is no story line and no moral. Somehow it managed to get worse each season. The only good thing is the consistent humor injected by Hugo.

If you're into puzzling shows that keep you guessing at every turn, this one's for you.

I read a one star review before posting this. The chap was seriously butthurt that he couldn't understand the ending of the last season. I needed to post this because it's something you all should keep in mind if you're going to get LOST; time is relative to perspective. To the living, we view time as linearly as we live it. It's just how our brain processes experience. Time is, in fact, fluid. For example; if you were to go to a hypothetical heaven after death, you would find that people are there that have been dead longer than you, but also those who have yet to die. The reason for this is that, outside of time, all times are one long now. This place you go after death would be outside of time, and since your brain isn't physically there with you... Time is irrelevant. :-)

If that isn't too hard to comprehend... I think you'll love this very strange, intense, timey wimey show!",1437350400,,1001,4.459016393442623

4076260,3,B0036EH3X4,"When I reviewed season 5 of Lost, I stated that how well the show runners of Lost answered the big questions of the show would ultimate determine how I felt about season 6 and the show overall.  The show finished airing in May and it is now August.  Honestly, I still don't know how I feel about things.

Before we go further, I will issue my standard spoiler warning.  I will be discussing season 6 assuming you have seen the previous 5 seasons of the show.  If you haven't and you don't want to know what happens, stop now.  I will try to spoil as little of season 6 as I can.

Season 6 finds all our characters on the Island in the same year again.  Ben Linus (Michael Emerson) has just killed Jacob much to the delight of the Smoke Monster who is masquerading as John Locke (Terry O'Quinn).  Jin (Daniel Dae Kim) and Sun (Yunjin Kim) are trying to find each other.  Sawyer (Josh Holloway) thinks he may have found a way to leave the island for good, something he is anxious to do now that Juliette (Elizabeth Mitchell) has died.  And in a dramatic change, it's actually Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) who thinks the survivors of Flight 815 might have a destiny on the island.

Meanwhile, we are also treated to the lives of our heroes in Los Angeles.  Yep, in the first few moments of the season, they start an alternative timeline in which Flight 815 didn't crash and no one landed on the island.  How our characters continue connecting in this alternative world and what their lives are like is actually quite interesting.

All this leads to an epic battle.  Who will win?

Or, maybe the bigger question is, what are the sides?  Much like the rest of the show, we are treated to one side of things and plenty of action and twists, but I never felt like we truly learned what any of it meant.  Yes, we got some answers.  The answers we get were interesting and logical in the world of Lost.

But there were way too many big questions left unanswered.  For me, the biggest questions remains, what is the island?  Related is, why is it so special?  You know, minor things like that.  I felt like they were dancing around those answers in the final few episodes, but they never really told us.

On the other hand, the characters were as compelling as always.  Love them or hate them (or sometimes love and hate them at the same time), I have really built a connection with these characters over the course of the six seasons the show was on the air.  I wanted them to live happily ever after, and I felt so much of what they were going through.  I left the final episode with a great sense of emotional closure even as my mind was screaming over all the questions that they never addressed.  They managed to bring back many of the former cast members, especially in the final episode, and I loved seeing them again.

And the acting is once again wonderful.  This cast can act.  The plot may call for them to do some pretty wacky things as the show digs further into a science fiction world, but I bought every minute of it.  The performances, more than anything else, had me glued to my TV week after week, shocked when the show ended already.

But here's the thing.  For a story to truly work, you need both good characters and good story.  While this show had great characters, the story was a mishmash of stuff that ultimately didn't resolve well.  When the producers negotiated an end date for the show with ABC, I expected them to wrap up storylines and give us a satisfying conclusion.  Instead, they just stopped telling a story and gave us an emotional resolution.  So this season turned out to be disappointing story wise but emotionally satisfying.

These sets have always included great extras, and season six is no exception.  In addition to the show, we get deleted scenes, bloopers, four audio commentaries and behind the scenes featurettes on creating the final season and examining the characters against definitions of being a hero.  Finally, there's a new 11 minute short story that explores life on the island after the end of the series.  And that's all I will say to avoid further spoilers.

And so there you have it.  I loved the ride that is Lost and enjoyed my time with the characters.  However, I feel like the storytellers got so wrapped up in those characters they forgot the need to wrap up the story with season 6.  As a result, I don't know if I need to go back and visit these friends in the future.",1431129600,,4430,4.437965260545906

4076329,2,B0036EH3X4,"This was simply a very lame ending to a very long show.  It was trite, unimaginative, and unfortunate--after watching season six, I simply feel that the writers were struggling to wrap up loose ends and tie everything together rather than continuing what had been a very compelling narrative.  And in doing so, they took the easy way out in a lot of ways, but especially with the ""they're dead already"" ending that not only left about a zillion questions unanswered, but that also violated much of the narrative's previous flow.  I'd go into more detail, but that's been given already in the thousands of words written in these reviews, so it really would serve no purpose.  But here's the rub:  if you've made it to season six, you're going to watch it no matter what anyone says, so as to not have wasted the time you spent watching the previous five seasons.  Just be prepared for a season in which the writers are more focused on filling in blanks and explaining things away than they are in continuing a narrative or even developing characters.  This season, and especially the finale, were definitely a huge let-down.  And life goes on.",1417910400,,1142,4.703517587939698

4076346,2,B0036EH3X4,"Anyone who has watched the previous five series will find this season a must have. Since the start of season 1 all we really wanted to know is does anyone make it off the island alive, back to their loved ones. You would expect the final series to explain if so, how, and if not, then what became of them. This final series fails to answer these basic questions. In fact many questions remain unanswered at the end of the final series, such as:

Why did Jacob lure people to the island rather than just select a successor from those that have arrived there;

Why did Widmore want to capture Linus, after all, he didn't really need him to achieve his aim - to destroy the island;

Why did Widmore want to destroy the island and why did he send a death squad that time?

What actually did happen to the survivors of the oceanic flight? Did they actually finally make it off the island?

Why isn't Daniel Faraday known as Daniel Widmore?

Exactly how are Widmore and Daniel's mother involved with the Dharma Initiative, given that they are descendants of the Black Rock shipwreck survivors (""others"")?

Why did Daniel's mother believe it necessary to send him to his death?

What was the mysterious infection that was rumoured to kill survivors?

Why did the others kidnap pregnant mothers and kill them?

This final series fails to answer any of these questions, but just leaves you with more. I enjoyed the whole saga but, for me, it started to go downhill with the introduction of time travel. The problem appears to be that different writers and directors were used for different episodes, resulting in an inconsistent approach to development. I believe that at least another one or two episodes were needed to wrap the series up in the fashion it deserved. This final series is short and really does give the impression that the writers were under great pressure to bring the final series to an end sharpish, in order to meet an unrealistic pre-determined deadline. Perhaps that was down to constraints on resources, such as available finances, or perhaps there were other commitments that required resources. Whatever the case, this ending is far from satisfactory, it is as though those responsible thought ""will it do? If so, then that's good enough - just get it done: it'll sell regardless (as people want to see the end)"". The acting is as good as ever, and that is the only saving grace for this final series.

*SPOILER ALERT*

Until this series, we were led to believe that there was a parallel universe where the survivors we know had never crashed on the island in the first place but somehow retained - deep in their subconscious - memories of events at the island following the crash. That never really made sense. However, this final series leads you to believe that the parallel universe is not a parallel universe but is in fact a kind of purgatory - one where people don't realise they are dead until someone (such as Jack's dad) tells them. In order to leave purgatory (which they all do in the end, as they exit a church-like building, walking toward a dazzling bright light), all the survivors are required to come together under the same roof. So, in the end, nobody survives. However, the way many of the survivors died in order to come together at the end in purgatory is not explained. This is, perhaps, my biggest gripe! After all, the last time we saw most of them, they had survived Lock's and Widmore's attempts to destroy the island and had decided to stay and live out the remainder of their lives there.

Some atheist or anti-Christian reviewers have perceived some aspects of this saga, such as the church-like building, or the whole purgatory-like phenomenon annoying, just because they perceive the presence of these aspects as forcing Christian perceptions on ignorant viewers - polluting their minds - or as just plain uncreative, unoriginal script writing. I have some sympathy with the latter opinion. However, it is worth mentioning that, if you are observant, you will note that the church-like building is crammed with symbolism that represents many of the major faiths of the world, including Christianity, Buddhism, Islam and Judaism (those are just the ones I noticed).

Summary:

A great disappointment - sub-par in comparison to all that had gone before. However, still a must have for those that have followed the series. If you have never watched a single episode, then don't waste your time on any of the series, as the ending really is such a bodged disappointment. :(",1416096000,,4519,4.760869565217392

4076378,1,B0036EH3X4,"What a load of confusion this show was. I watched this show from season one to the final and boring conclusion and I'm not even sure at the end of it all what was supposed to be real and what may have been a dream.

So Oceanic flight 815 crashed on an island. On the island there was a smoke monster, voices, other people, Jacob, Polar Bears, Dharma Initiative people and lookout stations. So the people struggled to survive, sort of that is until they found a boat load of Dharma Initiative food.

Then there were the mysterious numbers that helped Hugo win the Lottery. Those numbers also had to be entered into a computer to keep some scientific event, a time shift, or something from happening.

Well, fast forward to season five and time shifts are happening over and over. At the end of season five an exploding nuclear bomb was detonated.

Season 6 finds people still on the island. Meanwhile the people are also off of the island living their lives.

The writers give us a background on who Jacob was.

The smoke monster became John Locke after the real one died.

Jacob was killed.

The smoke monster wanted off of the island.

Most of the characters get killed on the island or trying to leave it in season 6.

The end has characters in the church. It turns out they were dead?

What the Hell was this show about. What was it supposed to mean? Was the smoke monster the Devil? Was Jacob like God or Christ? Was the Island Hell? Was the world off the Island NOT Hell?

Were the characters killed on IMPACT at the Island. Was the entire story just about characters who died tragically and then couldn't pass on as in the case of Micheal?

I have NEVER watched a tv show that left me more BEWILDERED and WEARY.

Why did people like this show so much? It seems LOST means whatever you think it means, or whatever you might want it to mean. This is because the show never quite clarified what the HELL was actually going on.

DAMN.

What I am saying is if they were dead at the end of the tv show then why couldn't they have been dead in season one after the plane crash? I'm not sure how a nuclear explosion on the island led to the same people being on the island and on the mainland. I guess a time shift occurred. I guess on the mainland the plane never crashed. I guess you could die on the mainland or on the island and still be alive, only to find out you were dead at the end of the show in the final episode.

And what was the deal with the hokey ""LIGHT"" at the bottom of the underground waterfall?

Was the island like Purgatory for the dead?

Why did the island constantly move?

What the hell was the island even for?

It's like I said above, LOST is so ambiguous to where the resolutions to the writer's ideas and themes could be just whatever each individual viewer wants them to be.

I thought for a while that Jacob and his brother were like Cain and Abel or something, or Jacob and Essau.

The mother of the two had some sort of Hera Greek Goddess vibe going for her.

And I guess the most nauseating theme of the movie was the love triangle of the girl with James Ford and Jack. She was alternately making out or having sex with both of them, even though sometimes the sex was in another time period. I got so seriously sick of seeing her face. And then there was Jack's crazy sister, the one who had the baby, another real whack job.

And the characters were just so bad, ""Charlie the Rock star bass player for Drive Shaft"". Sayid the torturer from Iraq.

Anyway, I'm just glad to be done with it.

LOST WAS A BIG WASTE OF MY TIME, not that I don't have time to waste, but what a joke this show turned out to be.",1411344000,11,3636,4.239477503628447

4076391,1,B0036EH3X4,"Worst ending to a TV series ever.  Lost revolutionized the way I watch TV - and not in a good way.  For six years I rode the wave of cliff hangers, Easter eggs, mysteries and awesome WTF moments, always believing we were building towards a solid ending. Instead the characters I loved were manipulated and twisted so many times as to be hardly recognisable, and the mysteries of the island, time travel reoccurring numbers and disappearing cabins all became a big fat pile of red herrings.  I can't imagine ever wanting to re-watch the series when I now know that 90% of what I watch has no meaning whatsoever.",1409184000,15,610,4.577981651376147

I DID NOT SEE THIS TV SERIES YEARS AGO WHEN IT WAS SUCH A HUGE HIT IN TV HISTORY.  THE WRITERS OF THIS SIX YEARS OF DRAMA HAVE AN IMAGINATION ABOVE AND BEHIND THE AVERAGE WRITER.  THE TWISTS AND TURNS IN THESE MOVIES ARE MORE THAN ENOUGH TO KEEP YOU ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT.  I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO THOSE WHO HAVE WATCHED THE FIRST FIVE SEASONS OF 'LOST'.  WITHOUT WATCHING THE PRECEDING YEARS YOU WILL MISS SOME EXCITING STUFF.  I ESPECIALLY LIKE THE FACT THAT THERE IS NO SWEARING IN THESE MOVIES.......EXCEPT FOR AN OCCASIONAL 'DAMN'.  I AM SICK AND TIRED OF SWEARING IN MOVIES, SO THIS IS A VERY WELCOME REFRESHMENT.  THE MOVIES ARE VERY SPIRITUAL, ALTHO NOT IN THE TRADITIONAL SENSE.  A GOOD BOOK TO EXPLAIN THE SPIRITUALITY WOULD BE JOHN ANKENBERG'S BOOK 'LOST' IN WHICH HE BRINGS TO LIGHT THINGS MANY FOLKS MISS WHILE WATCHING THE MOVIES.

4076559,2,B0036EH3X4,"This last series is not as exciting as the previous five. Unfortunately, my family feels the same way. It was a mambo-jumbo of mixed scenes from the previous seasons that do not come even close to seeing something new.

Starting with season two we began buying the Blu-ray discs. The difference between them and Netflix is night and day. The picture and audio quality is stunning.

Season six concludes the beloved series with the twists and turns one would expect from Lost. Nobody is safe until the credits roll for the last time. You will not be disappointed with the quality of this Blu-ray presentation.",1391040000,,540,4.869565217391305

It's like a six-season long Twilight Zone story with amazing characters, pacing and production value. Some hate the ending, but I think it was just about perfect. To say more would be to spoil it.

No other series captivated me like LOST, and the TV landscape has been a bleaker place with it gone. Long live LOST!",1391040000,,403,4.597222222222222

4076600,5,B0036EH3X4,"This is one of those tv experiences that is all too infrequent on the medium.  It is like that 1,000 page book that you don't want to end.  It captivates you from the beginning, keeps you hooked and engaged and makes the time you invest into it pass in a flash.  The story and plot are so well done that you are ""lost"" in suspense, wonderment, drama, excitement and questioning.  You will absolutely fall in love with the characters and with the superb acting and performances.  Now that my wife and I finished the 6 seasons over  a period of about 2 months, it is like withdrawal--so much so that we will probably start over, despite our knowledge of the denouement.  If you enjoy adventure mixed in with some scifi, romantic intrigue, outstanding natural scenery and, yes, some violence, you will absolutely become addicted.

4076602,3,B0036EH3X4,"I watched the entire season back to back on amazon. For some reason this season seemed to skip on almost every episode. Besides for the quality actually watching the show it self had lost my attention by season 6. I did watch it all the way, because I needed to know the ending. But I think this show lost me, there was just so much going no that it was to much. I usually like when there is a lot of drama, but this season really got far fetched, I did like the show, I really like the first 4 seasons. Kind of got lost on the last 2, but still a good series overall.",1389657600,,568,3.9478260869565216
4076603,2,B0036EH3X4,"It has bothered me for a week now that I reacted so negatively to the ending (just finished watching all of Lost on Prime). But now I understand why my feelings about the ending were so strong at the time. It all boils down to what I believe about the afterlife. I do NOT believe that we will be able to fix anything after we die. That is the essence of going to heaven. We cannot make things just how we want them here on earth (and especially not when we have indeed died). Heaven is the ONLY place where we will not feel 'lost.' All those tidy, feel good relationships the characters somehow formed when they were waiting to move on just does not happen. Life is messy and we are all sinful. This show somehow forgets that God is the only being who can wash us clean; we are not the ones in control and life doesn't always end all wrapped up with a big bow.",1389398400,2,860,4.125

4076606,4,B0036EH3X4,"I gave it a four star because the ending was a very surprising ending. It was an ending that I would not have thought of. Season 6 kept up in its normal show keeping you lost by flickering back and forth from different aspects and different time zones. Also very interesting on how it showed the origin of the island, Richard, and the whole reason why everyone was sent to the island. I liked the other episodes better, but this was alright. If you are wondering whether to watch it or not, then you have to. For following all the seasons down to the last, you must finish it off. I guess they had to end it with some kind of bang to surprise everyone for watching it this far. I'm not sure how they could have ended the show any other way? It was fun, entertaining, and exciting while it lasted.",1389052800,,796,4.243421052631579

4076609,5,B0036EH3X4,"If you persisted in watching every episode of the first 5 seasons, especially the frustrating fluff episodes in seasons 2 and 3 when the show had no clue how many episodes they had to tell the full story, then you don't want to deny yourself season 6.

It also had one of the few finale episodes that offered (to me, anyways) a somewhat satisfying conclusion to the dangling plot threads.  Even though there was tragedy for some of the characters in the final episodes, there is also that ultimate sense of hope to cling on to and the indication that most of the main characters will have a happy reward at the end of their long journey.  5 out of 5 stars",1388534400,,574,4.39622641509434

After completing the ABC show LOST after many years of waiting to finish it, there are so many messages throughout the show that speak.
One of the biggest things that impacted me was the unity of all the survivors of Flight 815.

So many stories of sadness, deceit, lies, life, decisions, grace, hope, & happiness. One things that we must remember that throughout life we are supposed take everything we go through and learn from it.
The ups, the downs, the heartache and the decisions.

This life is about you, me, us, & Love. Sharing all the moments with those around us. Yes, there are those that will go the other way, do wrong to you, or want nothing to do with it all but you can make it through. You can come out in top. You can live life to the best if you choose to. This journey is not easy, I know. We go through things we can't explain and sometimes don't deserve thing that happen to us but we can't just give up and do nothing.

There is nothing that we go through that isn't made to teach us and make us stronger. We all make choices, decisions that might be hard to make (they may be right or wrong) but when they are made, there is nothing that we can do to change those decisions.
We must learn from them and move on! Although it might be hard, difficult or look impossible to keep going, it's not! Keep your trust in God and he will make your paths straight.

Keep those you love close and never let go. Remove yourself from places and people that hurt you, deceive you, & harm you.  There is no good that comes from places in life that are made to take you out. Don't put yourself through something that you don't deserve.

It's not your fault and you don't deserve to suffer! You see what the world teaches you and shows you is false. There is no luck, there is no karma, there is us and HIM. Life won't be perfect but there will always be an open door out of turmoil based on the decisions that we make.

We can't go through life and make decisions for ourselves & expect a great outcome. Our ways and lives are flawed but HE has no flaws. We must make decisions for the benefit or others and for Jesus;because we love Him. Then we will see God do things we couldn't imagine & open doors that no man can shut.
But we can't blame God for things that happen in our lives that we have no control over. Although, decisions do lead closer to Him or further away. Where do you want to be?

There is no protection out of Gods will for your life. No one can protect you and you can't protect yourself. Only He can keep you out of harm when you are under His covering but when you decided to do it your way God lifts his hand and you open yourself to the attack and war of the enemy. There is no covering there. But don't worry. You can come back and run into Gods loving and open arms. He never leaves and never forsakes us!
Stop thinking that! He is there, just waiting for you to return!! Your life will never be found in anything but HIM.

YOU ARE FOUND IN HIM!

HE WAITS FOR YOU!!

Much Love,

Nathaniel Nicklas

I got through the first 3 seasons over a couple of years, then binge-watched the last 3 in the last 6 weeks. I just finished watching the last episodes and I am already feeling sad that there is no more to watch.

This was such a refreshing change from the absolute nonsense that passes for television these days. My sincerest thanks to ABC and JJ Abrams for making such an amazing show.

I have to say, on one hand, I'm like , ""Meh."" because the story is so outrageously unbelievable by this point, it's hard to take it seriously. On the other hand, I'm like, ""This ending was perfect...confusing, but perfect."" It takes a little bit of thought, but the message is very clear and it ends the way it's supposed to. All is right, if you will.
Side note: The couple than play Jin and Sun Kwon are my favorite on the show. I love them!! I want to marry Jin, and I want to be BFF with Sun. Their story is the most interesting, by far, even though the show goes to great lengths to make everybody else more sexy (unlucky lottery winning millionaire, spinal surgeon, druggie boy band member, outlaw on the run,con artist, pyschic/deadpeoplewhisperer, and so on.) The love story between Jin and Sun is about the only believable aspect of the entire series, and for that reason, it resonates with the audience. Can't get enough!
Sun is now on Mistresses on ABC (by far the most interesting character on that show too!).
I wonder what ever happened to Jin? If you're reading this Jin, I love you. Marry me!",1385251200,,1173,4.511737089201878
4076656,5,B0036EH3X4,"Fair warning up front there will be spoilers in the review so if you have not seen it, proceed at your own risk.

Lost started out as a series about a group of castaways stuck on a mysterious island.  Throughout the 6 seasons it veered off in a lot of different directions.  The final season was really about telling the backstory of the island, and revealing the fates of the characters.  I think your level of enjoyment of the last season will really depend on what you think of the story of the island and the big reveal at the end.

In this season we finally get to see Jacob and we learn who and what the smoke monster is.  The monster takes Locke's form and Terry O'Quinn plays a great bad guy for really most of the 16 episodes.  We are also shown flash sideways which shows an alternate timeline for the characters.  It is based on the premise that the plane does not crash (that detonating the bomb at the end of season 5 worked), but we find that the characters do not exactly go back to their old lives.  That things have changed significantly.  It also provides the opportunity for bringing back some of the characters that had been previously killed off.  That story is shown concurrently with the bomb not working and everyone still being stuck on the island.

The ending is really open to interpretation.  We find out that the sideways world was not real but a kind of limbo, hence Desmond waking everyone up.  In the end we learn that everyone has died and is meeting again in the sideways world.  We do not know however if they died in the initial crash, if all the events on the island really played out as we saw, or if the plane really makes it off the island in the final shot of the show.  That they did is hinted at when Jack's father says that everyone died at different times, but we do not really know how the survivors went on to live out the rest of their lives.  I think those are all interesting questions that they leave up to the viewers.

The hallmark of the series was really the wonderful acting and the character development.  If you look back from season 1 to the end at the ""main"" characters, those who were around until the end really did change and evolve.  Given that it was such an ensemble cast that was almost necessary for the series to do well.

As far as the actual discs go for those who buy them as opposed to steaming, there is quite a bit of bonus material (although not as much as prior seasons).  You still have the season play option so you can stop and pick up where you left off.  And of course the A/V quality is great.

Overall I think the series was excellent.  Although it did take some weird turns here and there, I think the fact that it was so well acted and did try to give the viewers some kind of payoff on all the stories they had going some of that could be overlooked.  You do have to accept that the show does not wrap everything up in a tidy little bow however.  I never watched the show when it was on the air, but I know a lot of people who did got really frustrated with it for going off on all the tangents.  I think those are easier to take when you can watch it on dvd and see it progress watching the episodes back to back without the long breaks.  Things flow better that way and you can see how they were at least attempting to fit things together.

I do think 6 seasons (albeit the final three being only partial seasons) was the perfect length for this kind of show.  While some may have preferred a ""cleaner"" ending with a straight they get off the island and live happily every after, it was fairly clear from about season 2 on that was not going to be the case.  It is not a perfect show, but it was still very ground breaking and original and definitely one of the better dramas of its time.",1384732800,5,3777,4.224546722454672

Great series though.",1378080000,,246,4.369565217391305
4076730,5,B0036EH3X4,"Overall, the final season of ""Lost"" delivers an exciting combination of action and compelling drama.  In spite of a few flaws that, if addressed, would have made the journey even more satisfying for me, I still believe they did a phenomenal job making all of these puzzle pieces come together.

I'm going to review this season in a way that shouldn't spoil any major plot revelations for those who haven't seen it all the way through yet.  I'll divide my review into four categories:  the storytelling, the characterization, the resolution of any mysteries presented from earlier seasons, and the controversial ending.

Storyline:  unlike past seasons, most of the ""flashes"" we see in each character-centric episode are not traditional flashbacks or flashforwards (or jumps through space-time), but are a new motif which the producers dubbed ""flash-sideways.""  At first, it's a little confusing as to why these ""flash-sideways"" are being utilized, and often has the viewer asking, ""Isn't this just a big waste of time?""  However, by the last five minutes of the series finale, the ""flash-sideways"" completely make sense within the construct of the greater puzzle, and upon rewatch the ""flash-sideways"" will definitely make a lot more sense to the viewer.

Characterization:  unlike many of the previous seasons, we get very strong character journeys for Jack, Kate, Sawyer, Locke, Hurley, Claire, Sawyer, Jin, Sun, Desmond, and Ben throughout the duration of Season 6.  I would have liked to have seen a lot more of Miles, Juliet, Ilana, Zoe, Lapidus, Rose, Bernard, Cindy, Zach, Emma, and Libby in Season 6, but we do get some nice guest spots from Charlotte, Danielle Faraday, Eloise Hawking, Charles Widmore, Charlie, Boone, Mikhail, Keamy, Michael, Alex, Danielle Rousseau, Ana-Lucia, Pierre Chang, Carmen Reyes, Helen, Nadia, and a variety of other minor characters from the earlier flashbacks and on-island story arcs.  On top of that, it would have been nice to have some additional familiar faces return, such as Isabel, Harper, Artzt, Mr. Eko, Karl, Bea Klugh, Naomi, Tom Friendly, and even the much-maligned Nikki/Paulo, but scheduling restraints and actor availability probably made those logistics a nightmare for the creative team to juggle.  I do think they should have included Malcolm David Kelley as Walt somewhere within the 18 episodes; however, Malcolm does return to reprise Walt in the bonus epilogue feature ""The New Man in Charge,"" which is considered official canon and does resolve / give closure to Walt's storyline.

Mysteries:  we learn what/who the Smoke Monster is, learn what exactly The Whispers are, see flashbacks of the island's early origins, learn more about the Black Rock crew, discover how the Tawaret statue was destroyed, learn even more about the DHARMA Initiative, and receive quite a bit of clarification on Jacob and his ""Candidates.""  Some of the lingering mysteries aren't really addressed or touched upon, such as the exact nature of Walt's ""specialness,"" the mysterious outrigger chase from Season 5, or even some lingering questions about The Others' society.

The Ending:  in a word, BREATHTAKING.  It ended in one of the most beautiful, spiritual, symbolic, satisfying ways the writers could have come up with.  I was really fearing they might cop out on us and try to present it as, ""The characters were all dead the entire time, and nothing on the island actually happened for real"" -- but anyone who watches the finale closely will see that this is clearly NOT the case, and everything on the island really did happen to the characters (within the context of the ficitonal Lostverse, of course).

Most fans won't be 100% satisfied with this final season, but hopefully it provides at least some rewarding element for every fan.",1378080000,,3784,5.170491803278688

4076752,5,B0036EH3X4,"I loved all of lost, but season 6 pulled it all together and answered alot of questions .It was great that they included so many of the people that had small parts through out the seasons in the last few shows",1377734400,,209,4.121951219512195

4076757,4,B0036EH3X4,".... but, yes, the end of the ""ride"" was a little bit of a cop out.

Look, with science fiction, I'm quite willing to suspend disbelief. And I allow for a little ""foolishness"" in the plot lines, if it doesn't ruin the story. If we didn't allow that, there wouldn't be much enjoyment. It's a story and the ""authors"" have to be allowed a certain degree of latitude.

But I think they dropped the ball on the ending here. After six seasons of a pretty interesting, often intense, ride, to bring the finale to the conclusion they did was not the best ""everybody wins"" way to end the series. Too bad. They had me on board for everything they did, even some of the silliness in the middle when it seemed they lost their way in telling the story. Remember, I am very willing to allow the latitude... but only to a point.

This season was no different.  What I can tell you is that things start to make more sense after you can watch it again.  Did it answer all the questions presented through the 5 previous years? No. But I didn't require it to either. I watched it for what it was....and it was good (not Season 1 good, but still good).",1376956800,,477,4.230769230769231
4076761,5,B0036EH3X4,"Spoilers - If you haven't seen it and formed your own opinion, better not to read this.
I would like to add my own interpretation about this show...what I think was ""really"" going on (IMHO).  I've enjoyed the many reviews pro and con that I've read here.  I didn't get to read them all, so someone else may have already stated a similar interpretation to what I'm saying here.  First, I'd like to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this show from start to finish.  I like ambiguity in a show or a book or any story since there is so much of it in life anyway---neat bundles of answers are unsatisfying and too phony for me.  Therefore, the many unanswered questions that so many reviewers have talked about, don't bother me.  I originally saw the show when it was on TV over the 6 years.  As I watched through the seasons, I didn't have any particular conclusive thoughts about it all...I just watched and enjoyed the mysteries.  Then when I saw that final episode and the final scene in which Jack comes running back to the bamboo field (where we first saw him in the first scene of the pilot), it suddenly clicked in my head that they had ALL DIED in the original plane crash.  The island was not a real, physical place, but rather a spiritual limbo where these dead, damaged, flawed people could all come together to try to resolve problems in their lives, to bare their flaws to each other and help each other find some kind of peace, or love, or just something meaningful for each of them, so they could finally ""leave"" the island...maybe like a release of their souls.  They don't know that they are dead---they think they have survived a crash and are in a physical location from which they are trying to be rescued.  About 2 months ago I bought the series on DVD and watched it for the second time, and I realized that there were several episodes in which a character says some version of ""We all died"" or ""We are dead"".  For example, in the episode ""Tabula Rasa"" (right after the pilot, remember...the clean slate), Jack and Kate are sitting on the beach and Kate wants to tell him the bad things she did in her past.  Jack tells her he doesn't want to know and says: ""Three days ago we all died.  We should all be able to start over.""  Naturally we would typically take this to be figurative, and I think Jack says it figuratively from his point of view, but I don't think it is.  Also there are other episodes in which different characters say this---I should have written those down as I watched the second time.  Other characters on the island, also dead, but not from the 815 plane crash, are in the same limbo of sorts....mostly trying to get off the island....for example, the Dharma group and the time travel are all efforts by the island's inhabitants to resolve problems from their lives and to find some kind of release, ie. get off the island.  At the end of the story the 815 group reunites after all their trials, at which time their group realizes they are dead and they are at peace with it.  The scenes we see where people seem to be ""off"" the island...well, to me they are not off the island really...they just think they are....again, just all part of them trying to resolve issues in their lives....feeling like they are making headway getting off the island.  The sideways flashes I think are for us to see what could have been these people's lives...if they hadn't died on flight 815 or in other ways...maybe they would have all come together in some other variations...with some ever so slight changes in their choices or their destiny---whichever school of thought you believe in.  Anyhoot, that's my take on this great adventure....enjoy it and hopefully find your own meaning to a fascinating story !",1376870400,2,3730,4.520833333333333
4076762,4,B0036EH3X4,Okay... where do I begin? I watched the entire LOST series from June of this year and just finished the final episode today. In a way the ending was pretty sensible. I enjoyed the show for what it was... a mixture of multiple genres with characters almost anyone can relate to. No one is perfect. No ending is perfect but this one did make sense. The ending leaves me satisfied but if there are any prequel stories in the works as a novel or otherwise I'd definitely like to see this universe explored some more. Heck maybe DHARMA has some more crazy antics somewhere else. ;),1376697600,,576,4.443396226415095

Having said that though, I will say that the series is well worth watching. It is television at it's most creative, exciting and original. There are so many truly touching moments throughout the series, and they are touching because characters were created that we could care about. My fave moments are actually the smaller ones...from Hurley getting a broken down vehicle up and running, and the guys going joy riding...to Vincent lying beside Jack at the end.

Sophomore slumps they call it. I believe Lost went through that a little bit in season 2 but I feel like it had more of a slump in the final year because they honestly didn't know how to end it. And not because they were making it up as they went along. I seriously don't believe that but because of the Pressure from fans and critics alike. That must have some weight on their shoulders that it completely affected their writing. The final season just dragged and was filled with flash centric stuff that we had a good handle on already. It was nothing really new. And instead of focusing on the current cast and going out with a bang, they were introducing more Other like characters and weird nonsense. The Sideways was interesting at first but I absolutely hated the cop out religious motif ending. I didn't think it was genius or amazing. It was cliche and boring. There was so much potential to end the show the way it began. With a big bang. Instead, it kind of whimpers to an end. And don't get me started on the cliff-hanger as to what happens to Kate, Sawyer, Claire, etc. They leave that hanging open. Some of the answers that were given were very ambiguous. And I'm okay with that but with everything else, it just kind of leaves a bad taste in your mouth. I would have been okay with Season 5 being the last season.",1369958400,3,1501,4.383512544802867

4076846,4,B0036EH3X4,"I'm sorry but I cannot stay silent, hoping beyond hope that the current television audience is able to pro-actively understand the relatively light symbolism and allegory present in LOST. It's obvious after reading several 'reviews' here that the majority of viewers have certain expectations with their shows that aren't being met, such as trite, obvious, expected, and stereotypical plot arcs and elements. People nowadays tend to think less independently and prefer to have ideas forced on them, allowing no interpretation. I don't blame the actual individual viewers, but the shallow level that television and cinema have become in the last decade due to social expectations and 'standards.' In the last 3 years, we have mind-numbing drivel such as Jersey Shore, Prison Break, Desperate Housewives, Fast and Furious, Transformers, any 'reality' shows including Gypsy Wives, Lizard-lick Towing, the list unfortunately goes on and on. The trend is show more! think less. No one wants to find personal meaning and actually look for the symbolism through research or common sense. THIS is why LOST was mostly lost on viewers.

For example, I keep hearing needless bitching about unanswered plot threads, like the giant stone statue that Jacob makes his home or the death of the birthing mothers on the island. BOTH questions are resolved in the show by giving just enough information for the viewer to figure things out on their own IF they choose to be pro-active and find the answers independently.

The statue is facing the bearing one needs to sail away and escape the island, but also faces the ocean as a symbolic/mystical ward against foreign threats or a beacon/location indicator like the Colossus of Rhodes. The statue is created in the obvious form of the Egyptian goddess Taweret.

The Egyptian goddess Taweret was seen as a deity of protection in pregnancy and childbirth. When the statue was destroyed by the Black Rock, that was the start of a period when women were not able to live through pregnancy on the island. It would also explain why it was shown with its legs spread in an earlier flashback and together in another -- because it needed to be rebuilt at an earlier point as well to prevent the demise of the island's civilization. She was often depicted carrying an ankh, the symbol of life, or a knife (Jacob and his knife at the beginning...), to symbolize protection from evil spirits.
Tawaret was a household goddess, of the sort commonly worshipped in the home but largely absent from monumental architecture and 'high' temple religion. It would have been highly unlikely that the Egyptians would have normally built a monumental statue to Tawaret, the goddess did not even have any formal temples. But given the fertility problems on the Island and the fact that the Egyptians believed in sympathetic magic, it is possible that they constructed the statue to ward off demons and spirits associated with infertility. This is given further credence by the fact that Tawaret was already an apotropaic deity. She was depicted as a hippopotamus because that animal was particularly feared and deadly in Egypt, and thus was seen as a suitably formidable protector of pregnant women and their babies. The Statue is also unusual in that Tawaret was normally depicted with exaggerated features of pregnancy, a distended stomach and pendulous breasts, which were absent in the Statue. Perhaps this is symbolic of the Island's issues with fertility.

See? The answers everybody seeks is already within the symbolsm! Current audiences are just too lazy to bother to do a little research. Don't blame the writers, blame what sells, which is shallow, cookie-cutter shows where the creators hold your hand throughout.",1369612800,18,3732,5.0931372549019605

I just finished watching the series' FINALE and am still crying. I've been streaming it from Season 1 to now, for most of this past week, even waking up at 3 AM to catch yet another episode. I stopped watching the news or anything else on 'normal' TV, neither did I have the mind to read a newspaper or magazine. Currently I have a pile of dishes in the sink, and I am successfully ignoring them :-).
LOST is a tour de force, a hefty mixture of sci-fi, fantasy, thriller, romance, suspense, and some (though not cloying) spirituality. While  not at all alike, its scope as well as the characters' interaction, reminded me of FRINGE. Yeah, I believe that both shows draw their strength from the way the protagonists react, interact, and eventually form loyalty to each other.
Do not expect the finale to wrap things up neatly. The main plot, over the course of six years, grew too many tentacles, off-shoots, nuances, and I suppose the finale was influenced by production limits. I feel I need another hour of storyline for many of the loopholes to close ...
In the final moments of the ending, I cried for Doc Jack, even though I never quite took a liking to him; to me, he is the spoiled golden boy who wasted too much of his life nurturing the chip on his shoulder. Yet he matured throughout the episodes and redeemed himself. On the other hand, John Locke is a character who distinguishes himself with faith and strength from the get-go, and I am left wondering why, in the FINALE, while liberated from his wheelchair, he was alone ... his lady love (Peggy! from Married with Children), who loved him no less than the other female heroines loved their beaus, was not by his side. Why? Could it be that John did not love her with the same intensity our dear dentist loved his wife Rose, or Jin loved his 'dream lady'?
One of the many loose ends at the finale, was Michael. True, he had done horrific acts to save his son, but then, later on, gallantly atoned for his sins. He deserved to be part of that last meeting.
Lastly ... I feel bad for the Black Smoke Monster. He had wanted to leave the island from the very beginning but was prevented by his step mom. Poor thing, he was born in captivity and after what must have felt like eons to him, perished in captivity. Despite the power he wielded, he was a victim, he sure had a right to the proverbial chip on the shoulder!
Oh, well. Off I go in search of tissues to wipe my tears and then tackle the dishes ...

I could write a book on my aggravation & why, but that will take too much time and this series doesn't deserve any more of my time. Reviewing this is more than they deserve, but in warning.......

If you haven't seen the entire series of LOST as I did & spent days into weeks streaming & watching each episode from Amazon, my suggestion is DON'T GET STARTED!  The first four seasons are great--well acted, well designed, etc. constantly holding interest with each cliffhanger episode & season, but when it comes to wrapping their ever spinning more questions than answers story up, they fail quite miserably with the proverbial phallic finger directed so evidently to the entire world for ever investing time & interest in their lame & evidently as LOST as they are series.

If you stay with the series up to 4 & even through Season 5 you will be a lot happier than EVER watching Season 6. STOP WITH SEASON 5 is a sincere warning! The end of Season 5, yes, leaves you with a lot of questions and wondering of end-stories and unexplained character plots & history, etc. but nothing like the fiasco of Season 6 and how they chose to end the series. If you have any common sense in your brain whatsoever, it will really mess with a huge bunch of ""well if you're going to conclude it this way, then what you did before doesn't make ANY sense whatsoever. Also, literary license doesn't even fit or even science-fiction with the miss-mash of storylines & final conclusion(s) to this season. There are so many better angles and conclusions they could have taken with the story that were much more reasonable & believable and would have followed the previous episodes & seasons characters & plots, but apparently the producers & writers either didn't care to do so, don't have the talent or mindset to do so, or both!

4076930,3,B0036EH3X4,"It took a long time to get there but I'm glad I saw the final season.
Overall, LOST was a good show. Lots of twists & turns. Now that I've seen the last season, and looking back, the whole thing took-too-long.

  Its disappointing that more wasn't said about The Dharma Project. We do find out what the Black Smoke on the Island is. I'm thinking that probably 2 seasons-worth of the whole series coulda been left out. Maybe its just me, but I wish more shows would have just 3 or 4 really GOOD seasons - and then the writers should create/invent a NEW show. Rather than droning on, meandering, and making a good show become boring by stretching it out for too long. In my opinion, that was what happened with LOST.
  I have a couple other seasons of LOST, too- but wish even more questions woulda been answered and tied-up at the end.

  Imagine writers making THREE different TV shows that are 3, maybe 4 seasons long, but that have excellent plots and scenarios and move at a faster, always-something-happening, dont-wanna-miss-it pace...(rather than anything 6 or 7 seasons that just plain takes waaayyy too long to ""get there"").  I'd much rather have that!

A classic example to prove my point is: remember ""The X-Files""?? I doubt too many people stuck with it all the way through. And why? Far too much of a carrot-on-a-stick...i.e...the answers you want, next week....only to be suckered yet again. Yeah right. Probably only a few die-hard viewers bothered to watch all of it. It just took to long to go anywhere.  Example 2: the show: FRINGE. Another  good show. John Noble is great in his acting. But at least one season (the one with too many ""Creature"" episodes) coulda been skipped entirely and it'd still be a good series.  Faster pace. Better answers at the end! (see all my reviews). Then create NEW shows. Too many meandering story-arcs and SUB-plots. This applies to ssoooo much TV these days.",1363996800,,1909,4.6626865671641795

The very last episode had me in tears. The whole thing was just an amazing adventure go through.

I gave it a 5 star rating because it was a really good closer to an amazing show.

4076936,5,B0036EH3X4,"To understand LOST, you need to start with Season Six, Episode 15.  Then, go back to Season 1, Episode 1.

Light=Life source protected, kinda like Garden of Eden post-Fall.  Explains the storyline of LOST.  Else, it will be very hard to cope with the extensive disinformation about this series in the minds of its many viewers, who mistake it for afterlife and sideways-time-travel (which doesn't exist).

Theme here is set for a fusion of Greek-god-style mythology, and modern scientific ideas about life and light as what gives life.  In science and modern New Age (nee: gnostic) ideas, speculation is that somehow there are energy sources combined with magnetism which somehow gave rise to life.  In LOST, the idea is that these sources are placed around the world, all around some 'center' that feeds them all.  Further, that you can travel in TIME.  Whether or not you can actually redo or change life as a result, is another issue explored in the series.

So Season Six Episode 15, posits the Greek-god version, because by Season Six, you've already been exposed to the so-called 'scientific' concepts of light, magnetism, spacetime, etc.  The whole goal of LOST is to show some fusion of science and faith, leaving it up to the viewer, how he concludes.  You're not beat over the head with one idea of faith or science;  the writers leave out a lot of the details, therefore, so you can put the pieces together yourself.

This much of the plot I can say, without giving the show away:  in the beginning, there was Light and Smoke.  The latter was trapped by the former, and neither could directly kill the other, so each 'invited' people to the island on which both resided.  The Light wanted to benefit the people and have them protect it from other people.  The Smoke wanted to encourage people to kill the Light, so the Smoke could escape.  But if it escaped, it would kill everyone.

That's kinda how Greek mythology goes.  Personifying everything seen in nature, and also personifying virtues and vices.  Greek drama always aimed at showing that human life was an extension of the various relationships and struggles between 'the gods'.  But in LOST, this and Episode 9 are the only Episodes dealing directly with that theme.  Episode 15's script is kinda trite, it's faithful to Greek drama (whose script was always melodramatic on purpose, anyway).  Watch it first and then 9, if you want a fuller sense of the plotlines, prior to beginning at Season One, Episode 1;  from there on, watch sequentially.

LOST is meant to beg the question of why you are here.",1363651200,,2572,4.786363636363636

4076976,5,B0036EH3X4,"Unlike many viewers, I loved Season 6 and I watch it regularly to remind myself how to be and what to expect in my own life's adventure. Why do I see this season so differently from so many others? (Or, for that matter the whole series.)

First of all, Lost was never meant to be taken literally.  It's the hero's story, pure and simple, following in the vein of Joseph Campbell. The producers make this point in one of the ""behind the scenes"" interviews.  Such stories are written to present life issues to us in a way we can learn and grow, all while being entertained.  In Lost, however, we have something like 14 heroes to watch and learn from.  There is some little part each of these characters in each of us. Who, for example, hasn't felt as totally lost in life as Jack does in The Lighthouse; as demoralized by past events that one regrets as Sayid; as scared by the whole experience as Hugo?  Who doesn't feel that he's going along life's path not knowing exactly where he's going or why, but embracing the experience anyway?  From the Year One shot of people on the beach after the crash onwards, every scene contains life lessons we can learn from.  I have watched each one go thru his/her trials and have compared their experiences to events my own life -- and I have learned from them. Each character mirrors some part of me and I see how I look.

Secondly, many have objected to the ""alternate"" story -- what might have happened had the plane not crashed.  Haven't we all wondered how something MIGHT have gone had something else not intervened?  The writers get to point out that we all carry with us characteristics that haunt us until we overcome them, as we see when Ben tries to take over his principal's job -- there's still a bit of the angler in him that he must rise above.  And, we get to see Ben finally redeem himself when he chooses in favor of Alex over the principalship and when he chooses to stay ""in life"" to work out his relationship with Alex and her mother.  None of these points could be made so well without that alternate story.

And, from a still different perspective, is there really ""death""?  Is there really time and space?  Einstein wrote that they were a delusion, and modern science is corroborating what he said.  Alternate versions of the story destroy the ""only-ness"" of any one of the versions. Each version is just that -- another version.  And, there's always another one.  Existence becomes holographic.

As for the ending in the church, much of the material presented here has been written about by people who have experienced ""near death"" and by many who are investigating what ""life"" and ""death"" really are.  Are they what they seem to be?  Is there ever really life and death? Or, do they reflect one's limited perspective?  And, for those who've studied the issue of reincarnation, this scene certainly brings it up.

Frankly, I thought the idea of presenting alternative ""versions""of the story, jumping time periods, and presenting scenes in a non-linear order was absolutely brilliant. They may have come as close as one's likely to come to presenting the universe as the holograph some now believe it to be.

Finally, even though the background story of Jacob and the Man in Black seems to interrupt the flow of events, these beings have been too crucial to the story for us not to know their history. Granted, this episode seemed to interrupt, but to tell it any sooner would have explained too much too soon, and it couldn't have been placed any later.  If anything other than the story of our heroes is important to this story it's Jacob and his brother -- the man of hope and the nihilist.

Personally, I applaud the creators for such an intelligent work of art.  The story and points made have given me an understanding of life I feel I never quite got growing up - and I wish I had. I know who I want to be like, and who I don't want to be like.  Anyone really want to be Shannon screaming on the beach?  Or Neil pitching his ""fire"" fit?  Who would you want to be like?  How do you want to be seen handling life?  Thanks to Lost, I'm reminded that when life upends me, it's really no different from  Kate and Jack being ""netted"" while on the path to somewhere.  Any unexpected ""turn of events"" is what makes life an adventure. Life IS really very much like being in a jungle on a mysterious ""island"" somewhere in space, and we walk the path thru the jungle of life never knowing what's coming next. But, all that ultimately counts is HOW we take whatever comes.

And, that's what our heroes ended up doing. The island exacted a huge price from each of them, but look at what they became in return. Each ended up being so much more than he/she was at the beginning. Even Ben gets redeemed! And, that's what we are intended to do: to give our very best to life no matter the cost. To be like Sun, letting her tragic lot play out without bitterness. Or like Charlie, giving his life willingly to help his friends.  Or, like Juliet with her life repeatedly dashed to pieces going on gracefully anyway. Or, finally, like Jack, giving his life willingly to achieve humanity's safety. And, having done so he could indeed depart in peace with a smile because he had achieved a noble purpose - a purpose worth living and dying for. Would that each of us could do so well.

So, I suggest viewers take Lost like a fine French impressionist painting where what is is only hinted at, and nothing that seems to be is ever quite so. Don't expect Lost to be a Law and Order type of story. It's the hero's story, meant to entertain and to teach, to teach us all how to live, and it has done both superbly well.

As a final note -- one simply has to see the series 3-4 times for many of the fine points to become apparent.  This is as richly detailed a story as a Shakespearean play.  It's small wonder it's being studied by groups to this day.",1361232000,4,5894,4.445581395348837

4076980,3,B0036EH3X4,"Season 6 was disappointing, but not just because of the final episode. Overall, I felt that the pacing was off. The writers were too concerned with keeping the sense of mystery up to the last minute and not concerned enough with providing a story that makes sense.

During the earlier episodes of this season, it seemed that Lost was struggling to maintain suspense. It was clear that the show refused to reveal any answers until the final few episodes. As such, the remaining episodes really don't have a point. The characters just run around on small missions, but viewers don't understand the larger picture. Moreover, the characters seem to change their minds every episode about fundamental decisions, such as whether to trust the Man in Black.

The resolution for many of the characters also proved unsatisfactory. Several of the main characters fall by the wayside. Important character moments - such as Jin and Sun reuniting - are fleetingly brief. By contrast, we get entire episodes dedicated to new characters like Richard Alpert and Jacob, characters whom frankly I just didn't care about. The last few episodes of season 6 are just way too late for these types of episodes. It's far more important to give the characters a worthwhile farewell.

A major character problem was how the show deals with Locke. Locke's body is now essentially possessed. The character we all knew and loved as Locke is no more. Frankly of all of the characters, Locke was the heart of this show. Making him a cold villain just does him a disservice.

That said, I thought the""flashsideways"" sections worked well. The flashsideways sections showed what would have happened to the characters had Oceanic Flight 815 not crashed. It was interesting to see how their fates crossed even so. I applaud the writers for not taking the easy way out and just portraying everybody's lives as worse had they not crashed. The outcomes are varied and escape easy judgment.

Now, as for that ending... Well, it certainly doesn't tie up many of the loose ends. A good mystery creates an unsolvable puzzle. A great mystery creates a puzzle that is difficult to solve, but leaves tiny breadcrumbs along the way that the audience can spot the second time around. I just wish the writers had spent more time creating an integrated story rather than focusing on dangling the audience.

Overall, Lost is a decent show, at times great, at times burdened by its own ambitions. I'd definitely recommend watching the first two seasons. I just wish we'd gotten more of that level of quality.",1360713600,3,2554,4.886836027713626

4077003,4,B0036EH3X4,By this time Lost viewers and fans can pretty much be divided into two camps. There were those who liked the show and it's characters and there were those who mostly wanted to see how it ended so that they could hopefully have all of their questions answered. Nothing wrong with being in either camps but in the end Carlton Cuse and Damon Lindelof had to decide which group to satisfy. Needless to say they went with the former and the later have been feeling betrayed ever since. I for one enjoyed the entire series from beginning to end but I can certainly see how some fans might feel like they were ripped off. After all the topic continues to crop up on various websites and message boards to this day and it's been nearly three years since the finale was first broadcast. There was even a fella who penned an entire book length rant on the subject and published it on Kindle. All I can say is that it's high time to move onto something else and give up hating Lost.,1359763200,,971,4.34065934065934

I didn't ""buy into"" the hype at all. I didn't watch a SINGLE episode EVER until 2012 after two years of my new husband begging me to watch it. He had season 1 and 2 already on DVD so I told him ""I'll watch it someday"" and I just never did until last fall. I told my daughters ages 13 and 16 to watch it with us which they REALLY didn't want to do but I told them to watch just a few episodes and if they hate it then they don't have to watch it ever again. Well, they got hooked by at least the second episode and now we're on Season 3 about halfway through so we haven't gotten past that yet but we will. My 13 year old BEGS me to watch it so we usually have ""Lost"" marathons until it's time for bed but since my ex husband and I have shared 50/50 custody I don't see my kids but every other week so that's why it's taking so long to watch them. We LOVE it SOOO much and cannot wait to watch more of season 3 tomorrow night. My 13 year old actually has started watching them over again because I won't let her watch any episodes we haven't seen yet until everyone is together and has time to watch them. It's everyone's favorite show even though it's over now. We will be VERY very depressed and sad once they are over. We watched all three seasons of Kyle XY too on DVD and they LOVED that too. I recommend that show also...a very different show but still VERY good...horrible ending though since they didn't know they were getting cancelled when they filmed it.

4077016,2,B0036EH3X4,"I loved seasons 1-5. I even enjoyed the first two part episode of season 6. However as season 6 dragged on, the episodes lacked the tenderness and emotional drama that made Lost so popular amongst its fans. In addition, the intrigue and fascinating mysteries of the Island were either sped along and thrown into the audiences face with what seemed like no passion, that it just left a bad taste in how the show was handled.

I got the sense that any criticism that could be deemed legit toward the writing and handling of the last season would be merely put in ""you can't please everybody"" bin. While that may be true, I believe the ratings and reviews this season gets as demonstration that this final season was a big let down for many Lost fans.

Oddly, I would still recommend this show. Lost was one of the greatest shows at character development and creating emotional stories, but the show faltered when it created this huge mythological backdrop for the characters to add suspense and mystery to the show, only to fall flat with many fans in the final season when the characters have been developed, and they had to go through the motions of doing their best to answer certain mysteries.

3 episodes standout for their dramatic appeal and demonstration of why I loved lost; LA X Part 1 & 2, Ab Aeterno, and Happily Ever After. Ab Aeterno was probably my favorite episode of the season because it not only had a compelling story to tell for an important character on the show, but it incorporated revelations about mythological mysteries of the show as well.

Seasons 1-2 are by far the best. Season 3-5 are great seasons as well. So despite my disappointment of season 6, the previous seasons make this show well worth the watch.

I gave this season 2 stars because it felt rushed, many episodes had characters traipsing through the jungle with no dramatic effect, and many episodes seemed to lack creative passion when dealing with the revelations of the Island.",1355961600,3,1971,4.684971098265896

4077052,3,B0036EH3X4,"I did not watch this series when it was on the air, so just recently became interested in it and slowly went through all six seasons borrowed from my local library...

I found the ending to be of mixed quality. After reading many of the reviews by other fans here and at other websites I agree with most of what you've all said both positive and negative.

The thing that struck me most about the series about half way through, say in the third season, was that it really had no clear direction. In the opening seasons it was the survivors of Oceanic 815 against Ben and the ""others"" but then sides changed, loyalties changed, crash survivors went from one group to another constantly, and everything became very blurred in terms of direction and ""good"" vs. ""evil"". Then they threw in time travel, god-like beings interacting with the islanders on a personal level, nuclear bombs going off, multiple time lines etc. and it became even muddier.

So about half way through watching this series I realized that the writers were really doing what we used to refer to in grade school as a ""round robin"" story. Basically, they created this opening plot with a lot of potential, and then did not think about where it was going. They wrote it episode to episode. And as with a round robin story, you start it, tell it to someone, they pass it on etc. etc and add a chapter, and once you get to like the 30th telling, the story is complete and utter nonsense with no satisfying way to end it.

That in my opinion is what happened with Lost. The writers just did not think it through. They counted their royalty checks, lapped up the fan support at the time, and went home thinking that they had created something profound. Instead we got this mishmash of crazy events that ultimately ended by being more frustrating than satisfying.

In the midst of this we had six years of wonderful character development as each of these unique actors played off against each other. But I think most people will agree with me that the plot of the series was so convoluted that if you actually found yourself on the island in the midst of all this, it would be a living hell. How would you tell reality from insanity? Take Ben for instance. He started out as this totally manevolent character in the beginning, and at the end they've all pretty much forgiven him for the mass murders he caused (some he carried out personally like killing the entire Dharma Initiative staff), and become his friend... How's that happen?

Another defining element of this series that is unique, aside from the round robin issue, is that I would estimate a good majority of die hard fans of the show will never buy it on DVD. What's the point? It has very little re-watch value. How can you watch season 1, knowing who's going to die when, who's going to kill who, and that all those events are pointless anyway? Charlie dies, sacrifices himself for nothing, and so does Jack, Juliet etc. etc. And think back. How many of the main characters didn't end up being murderers? Even Hurley ended up killing ""Others"" (he ran that guy down remember)...

So how did the island redeem any of these people? How did it redeem Sayid? He probably killed more people on the island, and off of it for Ben, than he ever did in the Republican Guard.

So I enjoyed the ride, but about half way through I realized that a madman was at the wheel and that the show was really going nowhere.

One of the disappointing things for me in the end actually was in the lack of adequate extras on the DVD. They never seemed to interview any of the minor characters to see what they thought of their roles and of the series such as Christian Shepard, Mr. Eko, Shannon and Boone, Ana Lucia... All these excellent supporting characters were not only summarily dumped in the series itself, but dumped by the producers of the DVDs where they could have contributed commentaries of their own.

And it seemed to me also by leaving several characters out of the church at the end, Daniel Faraday, Charlotte and Richard Alpert for instance, they were telling us these people weren't good enough to be included with the rest of the cast.

In terms of the interactions of the characters in the show, the character development, this series deserved four stars. In terms of the opening anticipation created by the plot and setting, also four, maybe five stars. But in terms of what the writers did to us by weaving this mess that inevitably went nowhere, one star if that. Are we allowed to give negative stars?

This series is essentially a poster child for the confusion of our modern world, how everyone's religious, moral and scientific beliefs conflict. In the end, we hoped that the creators of the show would give us a meaningful answer to the mythology they themselves thought up. Instead, they just used us as a way to make a nice fat paycheck for a while, before we ""Lost"" interest in their bull.

I think the conclusion to draw here is that the creators of this show were themselves ""lost"" from the beginning and probably still are. They are probably all still working in the industry trying to recreate the ""magic"" of this train wreck of a series.

And that's sad, because actors like Evangeline Lily and Josh Holloway who gained notoriety from this series really are worth watching again in a series with a plot that has some connection to reality... If you have any hope of finding that in this series, ""all hope abandon, ye who enter here.""",1346889600,3,5470,4.568367346938776

After all.... if you took out the mystery (which was awesome) you still had a extremely good and well written drama.

Sawyer sleeps around but his real name is James. Almost everyone on this island has commited a crime before coming to the island. I mean what are the chances of that many criminals on one plane? You have a con artist, a couple murderers, a drug addict, Korean mafia dude, Thieves with diamonds, kidnappers, ex-torurer,a rebel from uganda,a cop who is a murderer, and I am sure I am missing something else. But overall it was entertaining. I kept telling my husband I couldn't wait for it to be over. Just like a soap opera but with a light at the end of the tunnel. I was so thankful for it to be over. In a good way. Like the end of an addiction. I would reccomend this if you just want to be lost in front of the tv. It's a well structured story and good acting.

>>>>>> SPOILERS AHEAD <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< I started watching LOST for the deep personal stories that touched and interweaved with each other unexpectedly and mysteriously. I continued to watch LOST because of the paranormal mysteries that were hinted of having very normal explanations. Well, maybe not normal but at least logical. What was the Black Smoke? Why is Ben so important? Do the dead resurrect on the Island like Jack's father or dead means dead, like Ben's daughter? Why can it there be no children getting born on the Island? What do the Numbers mean? How was Lock able to walk again and why did he have to die at the end? Why did the statue have four fingers? And what about the polar bears, the one on the island and the other fossilized with a Dharma collar in ancient Egyptian ruins.

As it turns out, the creators of the series had no clue whatsoever. They kept throwing PostIts with ancient, urban and and religious mythology on the board and THEN they tried to mold the resulting pulp of ideas into a narrative. This way, something was bound to catch your interest every week. Yet, they had no idea where the story was going. Not even at the end. Well, especially at the end.

The problem with Season 6 of LOST was that, during the previous seasons, it had hooked us with so many lines that we expected either a fish or at least some uneaten bait at the end of them. Most of these lines simply ended, never to be picked up ever again.

No deeper meaning. No logical explanation that can tie around everything. Just a luminous steampunk spring that ""is important"".

I could not put it in words until I came across Jonathan McCalmont's Blog, Ruthless Culture: LOST was nothing but CalvinBall. To those unfamiliar with Bill Watterson's brilliant Calvin&Hobbes comic strip, CalvinBall is an imaginary game whose rules are made up as we play along. No one keeps score, no one plans ahead, no one wins.

This finale was amazing. It tied up the loose ends that were the most important, and let others to the imagination. I honestly can't think a satisfactory explanation for many of the questions brought up throughout the six seasons, and no answer is better than a crappy one. As for the ending itself I've run into so many people saying, ""I called it all along, the island was purgatory""...NO IT WAS NOT. The sideways flashes are purgatory, but I repeat the island and everything that happened on it was NOT. If that's what you thought about the finale then you clearly didn't understand it, and I implore you to watch season 6 again (or at least just the finale). Christian Shepard says during the finale, ""'Yea I'm real. You're real, everything that's every happened to you is real.

So this show was so freakin confusing. There was all these different characters with all their back stories. The show was constantly flashing back to past, then forward, & then sideways. It was chaotic! But I loved the intrigue. The writers were constantly throwing new info at us each episode & it just seemed like we were getting more & more confused. But I wanted to keep watching cause I knew we'd eventually get all the answers.
And so I thought when the finale came all my questions would be answered. But I wasn't satisfied with their reasoning for the characters stories & two of the cast members who should've been there weren't, & there was no explanation as to why they were absent. That bugged me.
Kinda felt like the writers were in a hurry to end the show.

4077065,1,B0036EH3X4,"*Major Spoilers* The only thing worse than ""it was all just a dream"" at the end of an interesting piece of sci-fi/fantasy is ""they were all just dead."" I'm fine with the idea that not everything needs to be explained, but it was clear from the start of this season that the writers were winging it. It's one thing when the audience is kept guessing, but it's another thing entirely when the writers don't have a clue.

Problems with the writing began to surface as early as Season 2, when the characters began to do stupid things for the sake of contract violations. Frankly, I don't care if Libby and Ana Lucia got drunk on Oahu and were kicked off the show. That was no reason to destroy Michael's character. Shooting Shannon was another plot contrivance. (OK, so she was annoying.) But, you see, good writers can come up with plots that are consistent with the characters they have developed. Killing them in silly ways (Mr. Eko getting zapped by the smoke monster was just plain dumb), is simple laziness. So is slap-dab casting - the former Press Secretary of the White House playing the ""mother"" of the mythical boy twins? Every time Allison Janney opened her mouth I felt like I was getting a briefing. (In very bad Latin, to boot.) And all those pudgy lackeys with guns looked like they'd just stepped off the set of Buffy (first season - that would be 10th grade). Now that I think of it, what was up with all those guns? A desert island that is chock full of firepower? By the middle of sixth season it was just one endless shoot-em-up, the stock in trade of TV writers who can't think of anything else to do. When in doubt, have a gunfight. Or raise the stakes. It's not just everyone on the island who will die if something (what exactly?) doesn't happen - everyone in the WHOLE WORLD will die! (How exactly? Black smoke? That stuff couldn't even get rid of six marines.)

But, in spite of all the lazy writing, I stuck with it, right until the bitter end. Why? Because when Jacob said he would explain everything, I believed him, even though he was, like Hurley said, ""worse than Yoda."" (And I thought nothing worse than Yoda could be.) But there we were, after five years of toughing it out on this island, battling dark inscrutable forces, making fire with sticks, pushing out babies, and all we get is Christian ideology - CHURCH for godssake. (And not even good Christian ideology, because according to the last scene, Kate, Sawyer, Frank, Richard, Claire and Miles flew OFF the island. Which means they weren't even remotely dead. Nor were Rose, Bernard, Hurley, Ben or Desmond.) The only way you could possibly rectify that awful ending was by having them all be dead from the start of the series, which, very clearly, was not in the minds of the writers. The only thing that was clear at the end of this series was that nothing was in their minds - except maybe, ""Hey, guys. I gotta get to Van Nys in an hour, so why don't we just, like, you know, ditch it?""

And that's exactly what they did. The problem is that they ditched us, too.",1333324800,7,3055,4.491007194244604

My only disappointment was in the fate of John Locke. He deserved better. But the evolution of Jack Shepard's character more than makes up for this.

4077084,1,B0036EH3X4,"For five glorious seasons ""Lost"" was one of the greatest television serial dramas of all time. The twists, the turns, the big reveals, the attention to detail: it was totally engrossing. The show had built itself an entire mythology and it seemed that something utterly mind-blowing was behind its many deeply-intertwined mysteries. Then came season six. Since that infamous final episode aired, there are two kinds of ""Lost"" fans: the ones who insist that people like myself are wrong for ""demanding that every little thing be explained and spelled-out for us"" and the ones who know they got jobbed and jobbed big time by that bogus season six. The Hanso Foundation? The Dharma Initiative? Electromagnetism anomalies? Vanishing land masses? Time travel? Widmore vs. Linus? Forget that: it's a cork and all you need to know is that everyone will be dancing and smiling and hugging again together someday, except for certain cast members. Oh, I see.

What I'd like to do is take season six and throw it into that pool at the ""temple"", fish it out and replay it to see if maybe the magical island waters turned it into something non-stupid instead of the nonsensical, supposedly ""character-driven"" piece of claptrap that originally aired. I mean seriously, no one expected EVERY mystery to be fully explained by the end, but come on. They just flat-out blew off five years of awesome sci-fi mythology and back story and instead delivered a bunch of contrived, nonsensical hooey. The ""sideways flashes"" were mostly pointless time-killers full of ""hey, remember him/her?"" gimmickry designed as a cheap swerve and the Jacob/MIB stuff was simplistic, boring faux-profoundity masquerading as good storytelling. It was a massive disappointment.

The problem wasn't that people like me wanted answers we didn't get. The problem was that the show dropped five excellent seasons of narrative because its creators couldn't find a satisfactory way to bring that narrative to some sort of logical (or fantastical) conclusion and instead resorted to a bunch of silly claptrap and flimsy metaphors designed to paint over those five previous seasons with a big broad brush. I hated it and I'd give it zero stars if I could.",1328227200,18,2206,5.0911602209944755

4077086,5,B0036EH3X4,"Why the end of LOST not only worked, but was truthfully the most fitting conclusion the writer's could have given us...

LOST is one of the most important television programs in the history of syndicated story telling. Period. Genre-bending, ground-breaking, budget-busting, gloriously epic both in terms of character development and the scope of it's intricately-woven, mystery-laced narrative, LOST is the most unique television show ever produced. This note is me finally attempting to put down in words what the end of LOST really meant, and why it is the most satisfying ending fans could have ever hoped for.
It has been 1 year and 7 months to the day since LOST ended its six-year run on ABC. During that time-period I have watched the entire show over, and had time to really let my thoughts and feelings sink in. I have moved past the point where I believed the show was perfect in every way, and have achieved a new, and even deeper appreciation for what was done right.
To understand what the end of LOST was really about, we need to understand what the whole show was about. The title `'LOST'' proved to be a loaded one. During the first two seasons of the show we are introduced to the lives of all 14 major characters prior to their crashing on the Island. These first two seasons let us know what the show is focused on: the characters. Each and every one of these characters is geographically lost on this island, yes. However, They are also `'lost'' spiritually, emotionally, and in almost every philosophical way you could think of. Jack is a broken man, eaten up by regret and anger stemming from his complicated and often turbulent relationship with his father. A man who is obsessed with fixing things, controlling every situation, and proving his father's decades old sentiment `'you don't have what it takes'' wrong, Jack becomes the de facto leader of the group. His `'live together, die alone'' mentality would prove to be the true motto of the entire show. This show is about a community of people who must come together in order to survive, or they will all die.
John Locke, a man who has believed his whole life that there has to be something more out there than his dead-end 9-5 jobs, a man who never quite fit in, who never quite felt at home, an orphan in every sense of the word. A man who's longing for a purpose, for a home, for meaning in his life, caused him to fall in love with the Island and to be sensitive to it's true nature, even when the others couldn't see it. John's belief in the power of faith and the role of destiny provided the audience with the first piece of the puzzle as to what this dazzling, sprawling story was really all about.
Kate Austen, a woman who is running from her past. From her relationships, from the police, from her fears and self-loathing.  In Kate we find a portrait of a woman who is unable to face herself and move on with her life.
Sayid, a man who was forced to torture people during the gulf war, a man who wants so desperately to believe that there is good in him, but who always ends up believing what others tell him he is, Sayid is a lonely man who never quite grasps that your life is your own to make of it what you will, you are not fated to make the same mistakes in the future by the failures of your past. Sayid is running from his past, instead of facing it, and finding the strength to forgive himself.
Sun and Jin, the love story of the series.  Jin, a man who will do anything it takes to take care of his wife, even if it means risking everything. Sun, a woman who struggles to find her own place in the relationship, who tries so hard to understand Jin's actions, yet ultimately loves him regardless of his mistakes. Their story is a testament to married couple's the world over, a lesson in what it really means to love another person, and to put that person's well-being above your own.
Charlie, the washed up rock star with a heroin addiction. Charlie is running from his past, from his rocky relationship with his brother, and with his own self-doubt and resentment for how his life has turned out.
Claire, the young, single mother who fears for her child's safety, and doubts her ability to be a parent.
Hurley, a lovable average guy who has never harmed anyone a day in his life, but believes he is cursed. He is running from his curse, and what he believes is his mental instability.
Sawyer, a man haunted by his past, filled with deep anger and resentment. A man who cons people for a living because deep down he has never been able to trust anyone besides himself.
Michael, Walt, Shannon, Boone, Ben, Juliet, Miles, Faraday, Widmore, Charlotte, Desmond, Penny, the list continues...but the point becomes clear.
LOST is about a community of people from, 5 different continents who are thrown together. Each of them is running from something. Their past, their mistakes, their personal demons, addictions, and afflictions, broken relationships, broken hearts, shattered dreams, and disappointed relatives. These people, who for so long have been running from themselves, have become LOST. When Oceanic 815 crashes on the island, they are forced together, and not only that, they have nowhere to go, they have no place to run from themselves anymore. They are forced to work together, putting aside their racial, cultural, ethnic, differences in order to survive an island that in almost every way imaginable represents a reflection of themselves.
The Island, the most enigmatic character on the show, is both the setting for these characters' redemption, and the catalyst behind that redemption. Mysterious, baffling, miraculous, dangerous, and of indescribable importance, the island is the key to healing these broken characters.
The ultimate theme of LOST is letting go. Letting go of the past, letting go of anger, failures, mistakes, and broken promises. Letting go of heartache, self-doubts, fears, and addictions. Overcoming the past by finding strength in those around you, surviving both physically and emotionally by forming a community. Each of these characters over the course of the six seasons of the show are tested by the island time and time again in a variety of ways both big and small; obvious and subtle. The Island serves as a judge, counselor, and healer to each of these people, helping them shed their hang-ups, realize who they really are, and grow into the people they were always meant to be. THIS is what LOST is about...finding yourself. Making your own destiny by realizing that the power to do the right thing has always been in your hands. Recognizing the strength that we each have, and the inner sense of what is right and what is wrong, and that the ability to decide to do the right thing is ours and ours alone. It is an individual responsibility, and we can't blame the past, or our fathers, mothers, friends, or other relatives for our failures. We alone are to blame, and we alone have the power to forgive ourselves, to let go, and to move on. This is what the show was about.. The mysteries served to test these characters in ways that kept us hooked, kept us entertained, and served to move the plot forward in a fresh, unique way. But the mysteries were only relevant in how they related to these character's journeys of letting go of the past. By the time the 2 and a half hour series finale rolled around, whether or not each and every little question had been answered paled in comparison to the hope that our character's would find the strength to let go of the past and move on. Would they find the redemption the island so desperately attempted to give them? It is in THIS context that ANY discussion of the finale of LOST MUST begin. The show was about the characters, and it ends with the characters. And, how it ends, in my opinion, is untouchable.

Exciting, frustrating, slightly amusing, beautifully nostalgic, heart-breakingly final, and inexplicably fitting, the finale of LOST stands as one of the greatest closing chapters in the history of popular fiction. The characters have been presented to us all of seasons 6 in two different time-lines. A world where the Island is of no consequence because flight 815 never crashed, and a universe in which the first five seasons have built to a shocking show-down between our soon-to-be-redeemed heroes and an evil of unspeakable magnitude. The entire final season had us simultaneously scratching our head and biting our fingernails. By the time episode 121, aptly titled `'The End'' aired, we were emotionally exhausted and, like our characters ready to face the ultimate conclusion of what had been a journey of incredible discovery, and deep sacrifice.
Before I explain how the finale perfectly realizes the theme of letting go of the past in order to move on, I must divulge a few spoilers. Without any big, long-winded exegesis, here it goes: The `'side-ways'' world is simply a limbo of sorts where the souls of the characters went AFTER the events of their lives. The characters were real, they all lived, all crashed on the Island, all experienced the dramatic events of the series, and all, eventually, at different times, and in different places, died. When they died, they all ended up in the same `'limbo-verse'', as it were, and we discover, in the most emotionally-charged turns of events of the entire series, and perhaps in television history, that the purpose behind all of this was so they could remember their lives, let go of the past, and move on to the afterlife together.
On the Island, the evil is defeated, and the ultimate hero sacrifices his life to save those he cares for most. The end, which could not have possibly come more full circle, perfectly reflects the beginning of these character's journeys. In the limbo-verse, our characters were given a final opportunity to deal with any unresolved issues they had at the time of their deaths on Earth.  Those who had worked through most of their issues, like Hurley, had significantly better lives in the side-ways world than they ever did during the events we saw of their lives in earlier seasons. But most died with unresolved issues, problems that still needed to be worked out. We see these final issues and obstacles overcome as the characters remember each other, their lives, and the events that have bonded them together into what is now revealed to be a spiritual, as well, as physical community of people. Once each of the characters has remembered their lives, they are free to let go, reunite with the most important people from their lives, and move on. To Where? Someplace where Locke will never need a wheel chair again, somewhere where Kate will never need to worry about being safe ever again. Some place where Sun and Jin will never have to be apart, a place where Sayid would never need to worry about his dark past threatening his happiness. A place where Hurley is loved, accepted, and important. A place where Charlie is clean, free of his depression, and free from the chains that dragged him down during his life on Earth. A place where Desmond will never have to search for Penny, or convince her that he really loves her. A place where Jack knows that his father loves him, and will never have to wonder if he has what it takes. A place where these characters will have found redemption, love, self-assurance, peace, happiness, closure, a future.  Free of the past; free from heartache, free from death, a home. A real destiny, a real purpose. A place where they will no longer be LOST.",1327276800,179,11499,4.71272365805169
4077087,1,B0036EH3X4,"This was the most improper and ""magical"" ending I have ever seen from a television series, that started out beautifully through scientific examinations of the plane crash, attempts at community building, and tried to give us some faith in extra-ordinary events in character's lives, and faith in the island's history.

I did not have any problem understanding both sides - science and faith, but the ending in LOST season 6 is pathetic by any standard, since it did not explain anything through either science or faith, but pure magic, which made no sense unless there was something or someone causing the magic.

In the end, Locke (the ""faith"" guy) is dead, Jack (the ""science"" guy) is confused and tries to kill himself, and the ""others"" (native inhabitants of island) had their leader (Jacob) killed and the island sinks to the bottom of the ocean. What an ending!",1326844800,11,867,4.891156462585034

It made the viewer really think about all the different aspects of the show long after the hour was over and for months (okay 6 years!) and even resulted in many forums, websites & blogs dedicated to discussion of what everything meant or could mean.
It was not so much about 'the ending' (which I totally loved!), but more about the journey with this group of people, who like most, are naturally flawed and have made choices and mistakes in life.

I agree with the majority of people that it appears the writers did not have adequate time to tie up the tons of questions so they answered as many as they could by magic, religion, and making the viewer guess.  If I didn't watch this season I would be just as well off as if I knew I would have to draw my own conclusions there would be no point in watching this whole season that was just weird (not the good Lost weird either).  At the end I felt for the writers who were clearly grasping at straws as if they had told a lie and gotten too deep to dig themselves out.  If you have watched the other 5 seasons you are pot committed and pretty much have to watch so they really didn't need to put out something good.  It is like when someone puts in their 2 weeks notice at work.  Do you really think they are gonna work as hard when they know they are gone after this season?

4077106,2,B0036EH3X4,"This is a comment on the whole show.
As I dislike following T.V. series chapter afer chapter, week after week or - as in this case - year after year, I decided to wait for the DVD release of the sixth seasons so as to watch them from certain distance, far from all the hubbub, the fame and the worship in order to get a more objective standpoint and, eventually, a more accurate and emotionally detached judgement.
The first two seasons seemed to me to be the finest. Round characters, interesting story and thematic concern (how to survive in extreme situations), a brilliant score, good acting from the main interpreters (Michael Emerson as Ben, the best) good directions, impressive locations and great entertainment all the way through. The love stories of Jin/Lun, Claire/Charlie, Hurley/Libby, Jack/Kate/Sawyer and Sayid/Shannon are well developed, touching and true to life; at least, you believe in them.
However, things start going wrong by the middle of Season 3: long incidents over the weighter, some unnecesary flashbacks going nowhere, additional adventures cut off from the main plot. This goes on and on up to the point when the story becomes uninteresting and confusing, a hotch potch that becomes a total boring mess. Once the ""time traveling"" and the island transportation start, you are the one who becomes ""lost"".
No doubt: Hollywood has given us some good series in the History of T.V. Centennial, Roots, Carnivale, Holocaust, Rome, just to name some of the ones I've seen.  And other european masterpieces such as I Claudius, Upstairs - Downstairs, The Earth or Berlin Alexanderplatz, works of art that have never been surpassed in artistic achievement. Although LOST was never conceived to become an artistic masterpiece as the ones just mentioned, it might have reached a high level of pre-eminence if shorter, less pretentious, less ambitious and more common-sensical and coherent. The truth is that, after Season 3, the series becomes weaker and goofier, reaching a ""grand finale"" in a chapel (actually it looks like an all-cast cocktail-to-be celebrating the end of the shooting) wich is a tribute to Utter Nonsense.
If scores allowed, let me rank the series by season, on a scale from 1 to 5:
Season 1: 4
Season 2: 3.5
Season 3: 3
Season 4: 1
Season 5: 1
Season 5: 1
The best: Michael Giacchino's score
The worst: the length and the folly of the last three seasons.
In a nutshell: A hyped Hollywood extravaganza that it might have been much better if less contrived and pretentious but simpler and more coherent.",1321142400,6,2541,4.950819672131147

4077115,3,B0036EH3X4,"I was hooked on LOST from the beginning. Quality writing, compelling characters, riveting stories.  I love a show that makes you think, isn't lazy and can evoke emotion from you.  I appreciate not having my intelligence underestimated.  Unfortunately that's what started to happen in the final season.  Well, the show started to go downhill in like season 4 and 5, the plots were getting overly complex (there's a difference between smart and complex) It wasn't that they were difficult to follow but rather that they were starting to make no sense.  And characters that I loved kept getting killed off but I always thought, you know what? That's okay.  Because I always figured these deaths are going to matter.  For instance, Charlie dies to give them all a chance at rescue. And I thought, when they get rescued someone will tell Charlie's story and blah blah.  And then the dead characters started showing up and it was like cool, there must be something SO much bigger about the island that only the dead can comprehend, but that kind of amounted to nothing.  And little things kept popping up like Desmond and his copy of ""Our Mutual Friend"" the last book Charles Dickens ever wrote that Desmond said would be the last thing he ever read.  And it was like why would they even mention that if Desmond didn't have some clue when he would die? At this point he had already had psychic visions of the future and it was established that he was a link between multiple timelines/flashes/whatever. And there were a million other little similar things that made you think there was going to be some huge dramatic ending where  they all think they're going to die and Des reads his book.  But no.  From day one, you were made to believe that people like Lock who have a bad lot in life, are really meant for so much more.  He was meant to be on the island and he gave himself to it.  Then at the end he wasn't special at all and Ben talked him out of killing himself, strangled him to death and that was it.  Sayid, who I loved from the beginning, always trying to save everyone, blew up.  Sun and Gin drown together and none of this means anything.  But it's okay because we have these magical flash sideways which at first I hated because while I want them to be alive and happy, I don't want them to forget everything they went through on the island.  And I was getting so happy and excited when the true love (which made sense in every case but Jack, Juliet, Kate, Sawyer which should have been opposite) was making them remember so it was like the best of both worlds.  But that really didn't amount to anything either.  And don't even get me started on how they leave it with Ben.

 Beyond all the loose ends not being tied up, and new questions being raised, there was simply bad writing.  The relationship between Sawyer and Juliet was one that made absolutely no sense at all and just there for convenience.  They were stuck together so they started a relationship.  And maybe they grew to love each other but that is not true love. You can't just go ""oh, these characters are in love now"" you actually have to do some writing, SHOW us why on earth they love each other because otherwise it doesn't make sense.  Jack and Juliet always made sense to me ever since they bonded when Jack was being held by Ben.  Kate and Sawyer were not written for each other but the chemistry was there and the writers went with it.  They should know when something is happening on it's own, that's a good thing, and they should roll with it.  But they fought it and forced it so that Kate and Jack would be together so it would mesh with the first episode. Never mind that Kate and Sawyer deeply understood each other because of their similar experiences.  While i was just fine with Kate and Jack, the show had already established multiple times that they just don't work together.  The writers just wanted an easy way out of the love triangle they created so they put people together that made no sense.  In my opinion, the great JJ Abrams got the series off to a fabulous start, then figured, ""all right guys, you can handle it from here.""  But they couldn't handle it.  So they strung us along for years which apparently wasn't enough time for them to come up with any kind of satisfying ending. If you're going to start something monumental, you better have a mind blowing ending in mind.  You can't just feed us crap at the end, try to make it mystical and think we're all going to be happy.  In the end it felt like a cruel joke.

In short, these last episodes were a far cry from ""The Moth"" or ""Confidence Man"" which nearly brought me to tears when i first saw them.  And I agree with another review on here that the last season makes you unable to enjoy the actual good episodes because now you know how disappointing the outcome of all their individual struggle and as a whole really is.

The final season was utterly dreadful, and it was a complete waste of time for the audience. The writers insisted that they wouldn't use some purgatory-type explanation for the show, and yet in the final season they give us one reality that is essentially just a type of purgatory. The writers failed to come up with intelligent explanations for much of what happened in the series, and their lack of long-term vision became more and more apparent as the series progressed.

Celebrity-worship also plagued this show, in that the creators would bring in certain actors (e.g. the always-annoying guy who played Ben), and then they couldn't kill him off because he was designated to be one of the stars from that point onward. This is despite the fact that much of the show's audience seemed to want him killed off as soon as possible. Instead of getting rid of him (as well as that phony and boring Juliet character), they kept him on until the end. Yawn.

Also, the most talented writer for the show, David Fury, left after season 1. That explains a lot.",1314057600,6,1172,4.684466019417476

I agree with many who say we should stop watching at season 5.

4077140,4,B0036EH3X4,"Season Six of LOST is not my very favorite season.  There are two reasons for that, one being that I didn't like the storyline as well, and two because it was the last season and I didn't want to say goodbye to the show.  I was one of those never-missed-an-episode in all the years of the show people.  In my opinion, Season Six could have stood alone instead of being the last season, and instead of rushing and summing up everything, another season would have been better for ending the show.

What they did with Claire was something I didn't like, with the remains of an animal substituting for baby Aaron.  I also didn't like John Locke becoming the Smoke Monster.  He was a favorite character of mine in the beginning, and he continued to slowly go to the other side as the show progressed.

The sideways flashes had me so totally confused that I had no idea what was going on.  Not until after the show ended and it was explained did it make the slightest bit of sense.  Sort of. For six years I loved this show and watched it faithfully, read just about every book that I saw on the show, and read and researched so many things that may or may not have been clues, but I learned so much about things that I had never known before. It was all worth it.  However, the ending was something that I really was very disappointed with.  It was a very tender ending, but not one that I wanted to see with all my favorite characters coming together after death.  I cried very hard and for a long time, and as for the ending, I can't watch it again, even after a year. I'm not sure when I'll be able to watch it, that's how invested in this show I was and how emotionally attached I became.

Season Six won't do you any good if you haven't watched Seasons One through Five, which I highly recommend.  If you haven't seen the show, you've missed one of the best ever to air on television.  Just because these are my thoughts on Season Six, doesn't mean they're everyone's.

Certainly my problem is with the whole season's flash-sideways, which after seeing the season finale, seems pointless and a little bit of a joke, I wish the season had been way shorter or that we got less flashes and more Island. Also even tough we get a lot of answers, some of them are shown in a very simple or even boring way, the final 4 or 5 episodes are gold, the others, seem like filler to me.

Now, there are no complaints for the Bluray edition of this season, the picture and sound quality it's superb, I tought I was gonna have a hard time watching the episodes which I didn't enjoy on TV, but the Bluray experience certainly makes them worth watching again. There are cool extras included here, the usual behind the scenes, spoofs and cast interview's stuff and ""making of"" of the season, but best of all, there is an epilogue included here, on the ""The New Man In Charge"" we get to see some of the after-finale timeline, and in a very clever way we are given more answers, more than I expected actually, it was so awesome to watch, I wish they had made more epilogues, but this one's just 'Lost' gold.

Considering the dilema the writers created for themselves with all the mysteries of the island, I was impressed with the way they decided to wrap things up.  These episodes delivered the same type of quality that all the other seasons did.  Creavity, identifiable characters, and the ""leave you wanting more"" feeling at the end of each individual episode.

I should add that I never expected everything about this series to all make sense in the end.  Fantasy is not about everything fitting neatly into the box, it's exploring the possiblities outside the box.

The only character I thought should have appeared in the final few moments of the program was Mr. Echo. It was a setting and plot that would have really suited a revival of his character.  As for ""Walt's"" character missing from the series end.........not sure what to say.  He would not be the child who started in the whole thing.  As a grown man it would just not be the same anyway, and I don't think he was an important enough role in the overall scheme of the series to miss very much.

After letting the ending sink in for months, I have to sadly conclude that it was a disaster, and unfortunately undermines the entire body of work. This wasn't just a show about people--a characterization oriented show. No, this was also a mystery set in a unique location that was supposed to be highly relevant-""The Island."" For years they milked this and we assumed it was headed somewhere and debated the numerous clues, trying to figure out what the hell was going on.

In the end they couldn't pull it all together. Alas. They score a home run on the ""characterization"" part of the show, but strike out with the bases loaded on the ""mystery"" part of the show. Unfortunately, the answer to almost every mystery that we debated for years was ""didn't really matter."" Think about that. Think about every puzzle you agonized over. Walt? The numbers? The candidates? Jacob? Babies? MIB? Smokie? Polar bears? The statue? Exploding the bomb? Did it work? The Constant? Desmond? Time travel? Widemore?

4077174,5,B0036EH3X4,"Lost
 While watching the television show Lost its hard not to get, well, lost. During the sixth season it's important to pay close attention in order to catch all of the underlining meaning. Lost, from a Christian perspective, has a lot of inner struggles of good and evil. It's easy to see these struggles more clearly in all of the characters as the show goes on. However, some of the changes are so subtle that from a non-Christian perspective it may not be noticeable at all. For most of the final episodes the inner struggles of the characters are more prominently displayed in both the present and the ""flash backs"". It's easy to see these struggles in the main character, Jack. Jack throughout the last season must come to grips with his struggles with the black smoke, to his sudden launch into a position of control, and with his alcoholic father's death.
 The inner struggles of good and evil are prominently displayed in Jack. These struggles start for Jack almost as soon as he comes back to the island and they do not end until his death. From the beginning, Jack is thrust into a position of leadership mostly because he's the island only doctor. But during the final season he becomes even more so when the ""others"" leader, Jacob, dies. Jacob, up until this season, had been only someone that was referred to when things needed to be done. He was simply always just someone to use as an excuse as to why things were the way that they are. This is a lot like the way many people view God. Just as a person who, when things can't be otherwise explained, we tend to blame. When Jacob is murdered in a plot set up by the black smoke, otherwise known as Locke, Jack chooses to take up the position of leader. Thus in my theory making him the new god of the island and forcing him into an even deeper battle between good and evil. This I will try and explain further in the following paragraphs.
 During the `flash backs' and the present it's easy to see the subtle influences of a God like figure in Jack. Jack once he had taken on the role as leader really developed a selfless attitude much like the one God had for us. When he took on the role as the ""good"" leader of the island he basically gave up his life. When he took on the role he knew that he would never be able to leave. But he was okay with that and was even okay with the fact that in order to save the island he himself would have to die. This is a lot like the story of Jesus in that God saw that the earth needed a savior. And in order to save it he became flesh and came into the world to give his life to save us. An example of how Jack did this is when Desmond went into the underground cave to unplug the energy so that Locke would be able to get off the island. Instead of simply getting off the island with everyone else he went back, saved Desmond, and ultimately ended his life. This is symbolic of how even when Jesus could have simply turned his back on us because we are stupid, he instead went to the cross so that we may have life.
  From a Christian perspective, the struggle Jack faces when he loses his dad is more than just emotional. It's spiritual as well. You can clearly see this inner battle during Jacks' `flash backs'. In his `flash backs' Jack must first learn to love and treat his son the way that he always wanted to be treated. Before he is able to move on and come to terms with losing his own dad. This is a lot like the way that we come to God. In order to come to God we must first go to his son, Jesus.  ""I am the way the truth and the life. No one comes to the father except through me.""  (John14:6)  They also talk about something that was being said throughout the last couple of episodes. ""I hope someone will do for you what has been done for me."" What this means of course is I hope that someone will open your eyes to the `flash backs' the way that mine have been opened. But from a Christian context it could mean that I hope that someone will open your eyes to God the way mine were.
In the `flash backs', which we find out later is really a heaven like place; Jack finally finds his way to where he belongs. In the last couple of scenes Jack finally see his father again. They have a quick discussion about what the `flash backs' really are and then they start to go deeper into what it means that their there. To me during that discussion all I could think about was how it relates to the discussion I imagine myself having with God one day. Jack and Christian, his father, talk about forgiveness and about everything leading up to that point. It's easy to see how much during that point that they love each other and how that even though they've been through a lot all that matters now is the forgiveness. That's the kind of relationship that I hope to have with God. I would love one day to get to heaven and have my heavenly father say that nothing else matters now without saying a word. So in conclusion, from a Christian point of view I can honestly say that I really enjoyed this TV show. I would also hope that the next time you watch the show that you should definitely keep your eyes open for the little things. The subtle little hints that God is present everywhere. =)",1296604800,6,5203,4.237903225806452

4077176,5,B0036EH3X4,"We are presented with a story about an Island, the word and its meaning should be considered within the show's mythology; an eye land, the land of the eye, the land of perception, the eye of the mind. The series deals heavily with perception; perception and interpretation. What you get out of the series really depends on what you put into (or are prepared to put into) it. Lost poses all the questions worth asking, literally, everything regarding the universe, consciousness and time. The viewer was the unseen character who saw what the Island saw, the writers kept that thread throughout the entire show. Even if you decide, after watching, that you did not enjoy Lost you could at least investigate some of the literary references; Lord of the Flies by William Golding, Everything That Rises Must Converge by Flannery O'Connor, or Island by Aldous Huxley, to name but a few.

Lost was an incredible journey. It was beautifully complex, the ending was symmetrical, reflective and deeply moving on so many levels (emotionally and intellectually) that you need to spend some serious time to consider its meanings. I do not want to give away too much detail but you will (perhaps) find the mirroring of Season Six and the flash sideways particulary intriguing, watch the scenes in the bamboo field and the church very closely. Lost made us think, it made us look at just how deep and complex we are despite the vacuous nature of modern life, it made us think about our perception of time and of consciousness and of our place within both.

Many of the answers were subtle, some were handed out on a plate (some were hated when given) and some require an element of hard work (you have to earn them) and independent thinking. The show is a puzzle and needs to be pieced together but it is all there. I fear many people watched The End and after about three seconds decided it was rubbish (it was really that one scene many people objected to but the church is used as symbolism and as a platform for a moment of transcendance, a moment beyond religion(s), beyond the notions of heaven and time but it was not the first time we were shown this church in Lost...) there is a lot more going on in the flash sideways than mere purgatory. Think of the Light at the heart of the Island, ""It is the source; life, death, rebirth."" - What element surrounds and ties all these together and is at the heart of the show? Watch LA X again; we are shown the detonation of the bomb twice, that is for a very specific reason(s) - there are two outcomes, both real, think about it. Lost kept the sci-fi elements all the way through the sixth season and blended them with elements faith but you really need to give it some serious thought. I saw the flash sideways as a real place, another dimension related to quantum physics and multi-reality consciousness, a mirror universe inhabited by metaphysical imprints of the characters created in the flash of the jughead detonation and that is the real beauty of the flash sideways - they are left purposely ambiguous.

Key episodes in this Sixth and Final Season are Ab Aeterno, (one of the best in the entire series) Across The Sea,  Happily Ever After and Lighthouse. These episodes are rife with hidden and open meanings. The finale, indeed the whole series is open to interpretation but that is the whole point. Such a literary show needs to be approached on the level(s) it was written.

Everything did indeed happen for a reason, every event led to another, so nothing is rendered 'meaningless' as many have claimed of the finale. The crash, the flashbacks - the linear timeline - the flash forwards, (there is the key to the whole show right there; 'time' and the perception and the manipulation of time) the time travel, jughead, the flash sideways, they are all related. Everything you need to know about Lost is inside the show but sometimes you have to dig deep and unearth the treasures by yourself. The main mystery of the Island was revealed in 'Ab Aeterno' and the nature of the heart of the Island within 'Across The Sea' but many people did not like or accept these answers but they were given.

Much of the fabric of Lost is surreal and that is intentional. Certain people were looking for scientific, rational answers to mythological, irrational questions. But the writers were purposely blending reality with the surreal to create that feeling of question and mystery, so one question inevitably led to another and another and another. That is why we watched week after week, season after season, year after year, because we love mystery and they revealed enough without showing everything in glaring, forensic detail, ruining the illusion.

Many of the 'answers' are completely open to interpretation because they are suggested rather than stated and that is the beauty of Lost, it is a very different experience for different people and therefore the experience becomes very personal. If you didn't like the show that is fine but for some of us there is nothing else like it because a rarity came upon us, (along with 'The Soprano's' and 'Six Feet Under') a tv series that lifted us out of the everyday and the banal and deep into the inner (eye) realm of imagination and enabled us to make the show what we wanted. To give it our own meaning.

I still think the flash sideways 'ending' is a new parallel dimension (not purgatory) created in the white flash, a real place for consciousness and memory to merge from one timeline into another. Like two mirrors slowly folding in on each other. But maybe that's just me...

Finally, the best piece of Lost is left alone, it surrounds the Island now, it glints along the ripples of the water, in creeping tendrils that float and hang upon the vines and the earth.

4077177,5,B0036EH3X4,"I've seen every season of Lost at least twice now, and it all makes perfect sense to me.  Okay, it makes enough sense.  It makes all the sense it needs to.  All the remaining unanswered questions don't matter to me.  ""Who built the statue of Tawaret?""  I don't care, it's not important.  ""Why Tawaret?""  I don't care, doesn't matter.  ""Does the statue being broken have anything to do with the pregnancy problems?""  Chronologically speaking, it seems unlikely, but still, don't care, doesn't matter.  ""What about Walt? WAAAAALLLLT!  WAAAALLLLT!""  Sheesh, you guys have been wailing about Walt since season one.  Don't care, doesn't matter.  Personally, I think the ""new man in charge"" featurette is a joke at the expense of all those people who will just never be satisfied.  ""Okay, you wanna know what happens to Walt?  Here, this is what happens to Walt!  Happy now?""

Sorry for that, I've just been skimming some of the 84 one-star reviews.  84? Really?  ""I loved it until the finale, and the finale sucked!""  Okay, so, 15 out of 16 good episodes results in a one star?  ""I wasted 6 years of my life watching Lost!  I want my 6 years back!""  Surely you did something else during that time?  ""We deserve answers and we didn't get any!""  Well, you got answers, you just didn't like them.  ""The sideways flash was a waste of time!  The time wasted on the sideflash could have been spent with Ben standing at a podium and explaining everything, with a nice powerpoint presentation.""  Hell, Ben never knew everything.

Sheesh, you want to complain about a series that never makes any sense, watch Smallville.

Okay, so here goes.  If you haven't seen this series yet, will you love it or hate it?  If you are an atheist, a materialist, or you believe that this is a science fiction show, and that everything should end up making rational, objective, empirical, materialistic, not-violating-the-laws-of-physics sense (including the smoke monster.  I mean, sheesh, were you expecting the smoke monster to be a cloud of AI-directed nano-machines from the future or something?), then, no, you will not like this season.  If, however, you realize that you are watching a fantasy series and have been from the start, you should have no problem with the true nature of the smoke monster or any other of the answers you get from this season.  And the flash sideways is not a waste of time.

So there.

Edit:  This is the kind of show you have to watch all the way through from the beginning, without missing a single episode (well, except maybe 'Expose'.)

4077178,5,B0036EH3X4,"I've had a chance to read many of the reviews posted here about season 6.  While I agree that season 6 did cause me to have quite a number of WHAT THE HECK? moments....I'm not sure why so many people feel ""cheated"" or ""slighted"" or ""let down"" by the way it ended.

I can appreciate the different levels of intelligence, philosophy, spiritual / religous belief, and over all view of life.  We all are going to have differing opinions on the way the show ended.

For me, a man who probably had the worst stretch of years in his life, from the end of 2005-the start of 2009.....LOST was life altering and helped me realize a lot of things about myself.  I am soooooo greatful for the WGA strike in late 2007 that drove me to drive down to blockbuster in search of something to watch, because I was so sick and tired of re-runs!!!  I settled on the first two discs of season 1 of LOST....and I was hooked!!!!!

This show taught me a lot about life, friends, relationships, and moving on.  I know it sounds strange and ridiculous to say this because in the end....this was just a TV show.....but it somehow gave me hope....gave me moments to pause and think about how the things in my life that were happening...could have been for a ""reason.""  It made me realize, no matter how much life beats you up and how bad things may seem....you have to keep moving forward....because tomorrow is a new day.

In the end...I agree that the show was about the characters...their lives...how they all needed each other...how nobody does it alone....about faith...not necessarily in God or any specific religion...but just faith that allows you to accept certain things that you cannot change. They were all broken or damaged in some way when they got to the island....like I was when I started watching this show.  In the end.....they all seemed to have found the inner peace they all seemed to want and need......

I am almost there myself....but I know I would not have gotten even this far...had it not been for this great TV show.

4077180,1,B0036EH3X4,"The true mystery of Lost is the mystery of HOW such seemingly great writers became so lost themselves.  How could the same writers who crafted such brilliant stories, characters and myths for five seasons, completely, and I mean COMPLETLEY, screw up the last season so badly?  It's like season's 1-5 were written by geniuses with multiple PhDs and season six was written by kindergarteners.  Season 6 is THAT bad.  No knock on kindergarteners, BUT... Where was the brilliant writing?  Why was virtually everything that was built up in 1-5 completely ABANDONED!!!???  It's like Season 6 had NOTHING to do with 1-5.  And the writers had EVERYTHING in place to create a mind-blowing finish to the series.  Jacob and his MIB brother SHOULD have been God and the Devil, Aliens from another planet, some beings that were powerful, significant and meaningful with clear and definitive purposes, goals, powers and weaknesses.  Jacob SHOULD NOT have been killed off at the end of 5.  And Season 6 should have been simply Jacob, MIB, Linus and Widmore all battling for control of the island with our great heroes, the awesome survivors, in the middle of it all and the fate of the entire world at stake!!!  And the heroes saving the island and the world (or not!).  Now THAT would have been a fantastic final season!  Instead we got meaningless, unexplainable, unsatisfying drivel that makes zero logical sense.  If I said I HATED Season 6 it would be too kind, too much praise.

4077181,3,B0036EH3X4,"I am a great fan of the Lost series and I would go so far as to say lost is one of the top five TV series to come out of the last decade, but that was until I saw the last season. Disappointing is one way to put it and let me tell you why, nothing is explained. I do not wish to spoil anything for you if you have not seen the last season however if you like me where hoping to finally get to know what the island is, what the numbers is, why there are Egyptian things all over the island, if you hoped to get an answer to any of the questions you have been sitting with during this six season series, then you are out of luck, they even introduces additional questions in the last season which is not explained either.

Now I am not saying that everything in TV series and movies need to be nearly explained and served the watcher on a platter, however the main focus of Lost have always been mystery, the mystery of what is the island and why are the various paranormal things happening, and how is it all connected and when that is not answered in a series with this as a main focus then that is like watching a who done it crime movies and never being told who the murderer is. The characters of Lost get a decent ending to the various storylines about them, but they are never the focus of the show, the mystery is and they fall flat on that.

Lost have kept it's viewers interest with promising that just beyond the next bend more of the mystery will be revealed, but when one get to that point new questions are presented instead of answers but with the promise of answers around the next bend again and so on thought the entire series, now this is a great way to make the series exiting and prompt people to keep watching but when that promised explanation never comes at the end as expected, then I at least just felt cheated.

Now not all is bad about Lost Season 6, many of the episodes are very exiting, the character interactions is great as always due to the mix of good actors and amazing characters. The last season is more action packed than most of the series and will at time keep you at the edge of your seat. I enjoyed watching this season very much, it is just that for me the sloppy, disappointing ending marred the whole thing, and in turn marred the entire series. I do not know what the creators of the series was thinking when they decided to do things this way.

If you are a fan of Lost I do recommend this set as there is so many good episodes, however I would recommend that you just do not watch the last episode and make up your own ending anything you yourself can come up with will be better than the actual train wreck of an ending this show gets.",1294963200,5,2683,4.143953934740883
4077192,3,B0036EH3X4,"It's inevitable that a series as intriguing as Lost would have a finale that's extremely polarizing in its resolution. What started off as a great series eventually got mired in its own mythology to the point where none of it was going to pay off satisfactorily. The overall problem is that Lost is a show that relied on a serial format and with a serial format, you have to give fans enough of a reson to keep coming back - unfortunately, that can sometimes lead to a wild number of implausabilities and half-cocked explanations. I consider myself a fan of the show (and I still enjoy it on the whole), but I'd be lying if I didn't say that it seemed as though the writers wrote themselves into a corner they couldn't get out of (and all the flashbacks, flashforwards and flash-ups and downs in the world can't mask sloppy writing.) The fact of the matter is this: it feels like a cop-out for a show as initially well-written as this was to simply explain away its own internal logic with explanations like ""it's magic"" or to introduce deus ex machina devices in the end in order to wrap up storylines that otherwise have no explanation. Sure, I enjoy ambiguities, symbolism and metaphor as much as the next viewer, but to simply assume that the series ""is all about the characters"" in an effort to get away with not having to explain some things feels a little lazy. I'm okay with having some mysteries left unexplained and I'm okay with whipping a little quasi-religious allegory in a show that's otherwise meant to intrigue people, but man... did it ever go overboard in this season.

Ultimately, there's no way to predict how the average fan of this show will view this final season - you'll either love it and accept it (flaws and all) or you'll hate it and feel cheated (while also wondering why you devoted so much time to a series that wrapped up so haphazardly.) In all honesty, this is not the season that best represents this show (for that, I would point you to Seasons 1 and 2) and it's unfortunate considering it's the season that provides the most answers to the island's many lingering mysteries. I suppose it's easy to complain that the series eventually collapsed under the weight of its own mythology (and the ""we're more clever than you... oh, and we totally know where this is going"" attitude that emerged in Season 3), but it was definitely one of the better shows of the past decade; otherwise, why would people spend this much time debating the nuances (subtle and otherwise) of it? Your enjoyment of the finale will depend largely on how far you're willing to go with your suspension of disbelief and how much you're willing to be satisfied with less-than-definitive answers.

For me, I came down in the middle. I love the show (and still do), but am perfectly willing to admit to its many flaws. There definitely seemed to be a sense of  the writers making cool stuff up as they went along with no thought as to how they'd resolve, explain or allude to the backstory of a large number of things and that's too bad. In the end, after this 6th and final season, the creators of the show seemed to be just a little foresight shy of creating a genuine masterpiece. Take that for what you will, but it's just one fan's opinion.

Oh, and for the record: ""Across the Sea"" was probably the worst episode of the entire series. How this ended up as one of the series' penultimate episodes is beyond me. If it was entirely within the realm of possibility, I would punch this episode in the face. Romulus and Remus/Cain and Abel-type nonsense and crazy Allison Janney for an entire hour? Really? Again, just one fan's opinion, but you'd probably be better off skipping this episode on this box set.

I love this series, but I do admit the ending left me wanting. If you've gone through the prior 5 seasons, you do owe it to yourself to see how they ended this thing - just don't expect it to end as wonderfully as it began.",1294704000,5,3938,4.525280898876405

Instead I was treated to a bizarre and utterly irrelevant ""flash sideways"", a magical glowing cave, and an ultra syrupy pseudo ecumenical religious ending that leaves the vast majority of aformentioned plot threads, etc, unresolved and thus pointless. Others have pointed out some of the specifics so I won't go into them here, suffice to say that there are literally dozens of unanswered questions/abandoned story concepts that come to my mind. From now on I will be waiting for a series to be over to start watching it if it is a serial like Lost was. I am sooo disappointed it's not even funny.
One final thing. I love this ""It was always about the characters"" excuse. OH PLEASE! Seinfeld was about the characters. Lost WAS about intriguing storytelling mixed with excellent character development.
Do you honestly think people would have tuned in every week to watch what would have amounted to a soap opera set on a deserted island?! NO! It was about the mysteries and the island, NOT just the characters.

4077206,3,B0036EH3X4,"I got the last season of Lost for Christmas.  Was so excited to watch it and was, not exactly disappointed, just not sure what I watched to tell the truth.  When Juliette told Sawyer ""it worked"", I was certain the flash sideways was how their lives were unfolding in an alternate reality after the bomb.  Then I thought everybody in the ""island reality"" had to die in order for the people in the ""other reality"" to remember (kind of?) where they had been before the reality shift.  Then I realized I was trying to make sense of something that could not be made sensible.  The really big question I have (out of all the many questions) is when did they all die?  Was it when the plane crashed?  That is the only answer that seems to fit.  And they were in purgatory (as many other reviewers have said).  The memories they were having in the flash sideways were the trials and tribulations their souls had to endure to prove they were worthy to move on. . .Now, let me say this, some of this season was a total waste of time and quite frankly it was crap.  ""Across the Sea"" was a BIG waste of time that could have been used to really clear up some things, but instead we get an insane woman killing the mother of Jacob and ""the nameless one"".  She raised them to take over guardianship of the glowing hole in the island, but nobody ever said what the light was.  Oh wait, here we go, the whole thing is symbolism, the light is really where our castaways are trying to get to because they are all dead.  Ya think?

4077207,5,B0036EH3X4,"LOST is not about the end as much as it is about the journey.  Even so, the 6th season provides an excellent conclusion to the entire series.  It is unfortunate that the LOST series did not go as long as originally planned, because the last few seasons end up feeling rushed as a result, with more action and fewer opportunities for intellectual intricacies.  In spite of that fact, the creators of LOST bring this, one of the greatest stories of our time, to an emotional and epic close.  If you enjoyed the earlier seasons of LOST as I did, you may enjoy this season.  It has the same feel and goes back to many of the same points the series began with.  However, many posters felt dissatisfied with the final season.  I contend that this negative reaction is more a result of disappointment over the very ending of the series than the way in which it ended.  LOST has always been a series that inspired thought, inquisitiveness, and even self-reflection.  In Season 6, there is arguably more screen time spent on finalizing character development and simply wrapping up the series.  However, if you truly invested yourself in its philosophy from the very beginning, its finale won't disappoint.  In short, it's an artful end to one of the greatest stories ever made.",1293494400,2,1268,4.6923076923076925

Jack, Kate, Sawyer and the other survivors of Oceanic 815 are all heroes in some way.  And in Season 6 this concept is really driven home, as the survivors continue to try to get off the island and get home.

As we've seen the characters develop in previous seasons through flash-backs and flash-forwards, this season presents a unique flash-sideways that is compelling and causes, as usual, more questions.  Season 6 also holds a lot of answers for LOST fans, too, however.  Who is Richard Alpert?  What kind of relationship is there between Jacob and the Man in Black?  Who are Adam and Eve?

Over the past six seasons, this series has intrigued and inspired.  The writing is clever and very moving.  Ending a series is always sad, since its audience has spent so much time with the characters, getting to know and love them.  Ending this series gives the audience just enough information to answer a few pending questions, but begs them to ultimately look inside themselves, to reflect on their own journeys.",1293494400,3,1176,4.655339805825243

The first five seasons are absolutely classic television masterpieces - has there ever been a more classic cliffhanger ending as the last episode of season 5?

The sixth season seems rushed out the door and not well thought out, from a creative angle. If I were to sum up S6 in one word, it would be mediocre, hence the three star rating. This ranks up there with Dallas as one of the worst conclusions to one of the best TV series ever made. There, I said it. I feel much better now.",1292371200,24,749,4.388489208633094

4077242,5,B0036EH3X4,"I would be lying if I don't admit I'm biased towards a good review just because I like this series so much.  So bear that in mind.  Also, -BEWARE SPOILERS-

""We have to go back!""  That phrase never had more meaning than the moment I put the fresh-out-of-the-box disc 1 in my blu-ray player and saw that first scene of Jack back in the airplane.  That second I understood everything that Christian Sheppard said to Jack at the end of the series and understood even more the whole"" transition plane""  he called what we know as the side-flashes.  To get this, watch that final tear-jerking shot of Jack's eye closing and then immediately go to the airplane scene...get it? He dies, and then he wakes up in the most significant moment of his life and start meeting this entire people that meant the most in his life.  That's how brilliantly this show is written! After knowing the end, I now get so much more out the story.  Every character's reaction, dialogue and event now hold so much more than before: Charlie's reaction when Jack ""saves"" his life, Kate's compassion and empathy toward pregnant Claire, Desmond's complacency about his life, etc, etc.  Yes there was episode less good than others, but that applies to all the previous seasons.  For what is worth, a weak episode of LOST is better than an episode of most other shows right now.
No, the last season doesn't answer EVERY question we got through the whole series, but it does give a complete sense of closure.  This show was about all of them, the characters; please remember that when you see Jack entering the church/sanctuary/ecumenical hall to find all of his friends already there. I believe the last 10 minutes are the most beautiful I've seen since the last 5 minutes of ""Six feet under"".  They were lost but they found each other and now they can go on.

From the new ""Temple"" people, who amount to fodder, to the new revelations (cave of magical light.....) this season drags its feet and then jumps off a cliff. All the things you wanted to know about the Time Traveling, What Daniel Faraday was doing off the island-and what he meant when he told Jack and the other that they don't belong there- is never answered. But that doesn't even scratch the surface of where they went wrong here.

Magic? Really? You mean to tell me that all the amazing things that happened in Season 1 2 3 4 5 can be explained away by magic? The whispers were what now? Really? Why? Its head scratchingly brutal, and has made the other seasons completely unwatchable on an investment level because you know that the questions you are asking while watching, will NEVER be answered, not in any logical way.

I loved almost every minute of the first five seasons.  Even when the show would take slight detours (i.e. Nikki and Paulo), I had confidence that Damon and Carlton would steer us all towards a satisfying ending - one that answered the most important questions and an ending that would have us all talking profounding about for years to come.  As we all know, this did not happen.  Season 6, though, did have some shining moments.  Richard's episode was amazing and every second of Desmond and Sawyer were great.  Some of the answers were satisfactory (the whispers and numbers), but after six seasons we were all expecting something mindblowing.  Oh well.  The last episode, though having all the time to plan for it and promises that Damon & Carlton always knew how to end the show, clunked towards a sloppy and unsatisfying conclusion.  I won't spoil it for you except to say that the dog, Vincent, obviously eats Jack Shepherd in the end :)  So while I will re-watch the show at some point for all of its many great episodes, the ending will remain a sore spot in my heart as well as countless other faithful followers who shouldn't have listened to the promises of its creators (who only knew the series would end with an eye closing).

Early in the show, fans had speculated about the nature of the island, including assumption that it's purgatory, the show's creators kept denying it, and six years later, they took the easy way out.

I do recognize that Lost was character driven and that the show created some of the most three dimensional, best fleshed out characters to ever be on television. It would have been nice, however, to see a more comprehensive set of answers in the finale.

***Spoiler Alert*** After all, one of the creators very early on rejected speculation that the characters had died and the island was some sort of purgatory, when that indeed was the direction they took it, though well beyond the most simplistic interpretation along those lines.

I even had crafted a detailed speculation that the island existed just to corral a living evil dust-creature brought back by accident from the Moon in during the Apollo flights. So much for my powers of deduction! This was based on an odd zoom-in shot of an Apollo candy bar during the second season, which apparently did not really have much meaning after all.

In any case, most people know the story or watched it already and they are here looking for reviews on quality of picture, etc. From a technical standpoint, these discs are excellent. The picture quality is terrific - as with most modern blu-rays it can be too good - often if the camera operator is just a hair out of focus (pun intended) you will notice this whereas you would not be able to see the difference in standard definition.

My wife and I also enjoyed many of the extra features but hands down our favorite was ""season play."" This feature allows you to establish a ""save point"" which lets you to go back to exactly where you left off even after playing other discs in your player. This is an absolutely terrific feature for parents who might be able to steal just a little time once the kids are finally asleep - searching for just where you left off would otherwise be quite painful especially when stopping mid show.

Now, in my opinion Lost is one of those once in a lifetime shows that will never come around again. Lost has a beginning and an ending, but to fully enjoy Lost you need to own and watch all of the seasons sequentially. They are all great seasons. While I do like some seasons better than others, I find them all an intricate piece of the overall puzzle that is Lost. In order my choices for seasons are:

Season 1
Season 2
Season 3
Season 5
Season 6
Season 4  I believe the writers strike really messed this season up.

*****Spoiler Alert *******

Lost is a story about a group of people who crash land on an island. They soon discover this is not just any island, there are ""Others"" living on the island. There are various life forms living there that should not be able to live there such as a smoke monster(explained in season six), a huge polar bear etc. The island has certain properties as well, such as women who become pregnant do not live to full term, there are also hatches on the island from a former group called ""The Dharma Initiative."" These inhabitants were killed off by ""The leader of The Others."" (Explained in season 3) When it becomes apparent that rescue is not coming to the survivors thing really start to heat up on the island. Eventually some of the survivors do manage to get off of the island (season 5) during which time the rest end up back in time (yes the island can move through time)and find a way to work in the Dharma Initiative. When those who had been off the island find a way back, all hell breaks loose. I won't tell you how it ends for a number of reasons, but I will say that I was very happy and disappointed in the ending. The ending had answered most of my questions satisfactorily only to leave me feeling a bit empty about the whole series.

*****End Spoiler Alert******
If you want to be hooked on a great series buy the whole series and enjoy. I personally could not watch each episode fast enough once I started. I found every excuse to watch show after show. I cannot remember the last time I had felt this way about a TV show. I only wish there had been more of Lost to watch.

It did not answer any of the mysteries from previous seasons. I liked the mysteries, but I was hoping there was at least a degree of meaning behind them. There was no meaning. Season 6 introduces even more mysteries without answering previous ones.

People say ""The show was about the characters and not the plot."" I understand their point. Lost's characters have more depth than any fictional characters I have ever known. I appreciate that, and that's why I love the show. But I still wish the story made more sense. Supposedly, having a more substantive plot would subtract from the depth of the characters. I guess that makes sense.

Overall, I still liked season 6, just less so than other seasons. I am glad the show concluded while it was still good and exciting.",1288915200,11,848,4.677852348993288

However, when I selected the audio commentary for the first episode, ""LAX"", there was no audio. I tried various ways to get it to play but, in each case, there was no sound.

I received Disc Two from NetFlix.com a couple of days later and its four episodes also played normally. However, when I tried to play the episode ""Dr Linus"" with its audio commentary, there was no sound.

I also rented the last disc of Fringe Season 2 from Blockbuster. I played the season finale with commentary and it played just fine so the problem is confined to the Lost DVD box set only.

Well worth the price!!",1287014400,4,479,4.420454545454546
4077279,5,B0036EH3X4,"Lost captivated me from the get go. It seemed to have everything including an air of ""Self-importance"". I'm not using that term in the standard way. I am using the term in a much larger, much grander way. Here were these people all beaten down from life. They were outcasts in their worlds before they ever became castaways on an island.

But as we all know...except for those still ""asleep""...this was no ordinary island and each and every week there were more and more things being revealed to us about this island; the Smoke Monster, the Dharma Initiative, the 'others"", Richard Alpert, the Black Rock, Jacob....etc. etc. etc. It was actually becoming maddening because each and every season it ended, I would think, ""Oh, please don't let it get cancelled...please let it go on..."" And then the next season would take off and there would be even more questions, and more, and more. And then finally it was announced that there would be a sixth and final season (I always thought that they should've done seven as it is more in keeping with the mystical and scriptural themes they had going on) and I thought, ""Well, here we go...bring on the answers!""

First episode...uh, no answers...more questions.
Second episode...same thing...
Third, fourth, fifth, sixth...DAMNIT!!! ANSWER ONE STINKIN' QUESTION! DON'T EVEN MAKE ME REGRET STAYING WITH YOU ALL THESE YEARS!""

But the answers never really came and yet in a soft and subtle way, they did...they were always there just under our noses. Of course, most of us bypass the obvious. The obvious is...well, too obvious. We like drama, flair, fireworks. Most of us only get things when they are shoved in our faces and even then we want more because we are greedy, greedy children and just like the Losties, we can really be in paradise and not even know it.

Paradise is not where everyone and everything is going along smoothly. Paradise is when we learn to put aside our differences and learn to work with each other and with what we are given. Like the oft repeated line, ""We need to live together or we're going to die alone...""

And these characters rubbed up each other and it was that constant friction and agitation that revealed who they really were. Yes, they were ""flawed"" people...just like all of us...but underneath the flaws, there was the True Light and the True Love that was always shining. No matter what these characters may have said, or thought, or felt, or done; the Light within them was more than any of it.

Just like with all of us.

And then the end came but they weren't dead - they were alive. No, these people were dead before the plane crash. This ""island"" redeemed them, resurrected them, showed them their wholeness/their holiness, showed them that with just a touch of love, all things are made new. I have watched those last fifteen minutes of the finale time after time after time and I always get choked up. This is what life is about; it's about constantly adjusting and readjusting, giving as well as taking, doing things you are called upon to do and knowing that you are not doing it just for yourself, you are doing it for all.

Truly, ""no man is an island unto themselves"".

I have heard people complain that the show was too spiritual. Spirit is in everything. It's just not always obvious. But this show...this irritating, maddening, crazy making show revealed to me my own heart and showed me that I am really never living my life when I just focus only on ""self"" but when I dwell on SELF.

Congratulations for everyone who worked on bringing this masterpiece to television. Your timing was perfect. Truly, to everything there is a season; a time to every purpose under heaven...

Peace and Blessings,

Any review of season 6 would and should serve as a review of the series as a whole.  The final act in what is a brilliant body of work was done to perfection.  They managed to close the series with a bombardment of answers to questions that have developed for 4 to 5 years [some answering of questions actually begin in earnest during season 5].

In season 6 the writers have gone back to what they had done in the first season: character development.  They rounded off the characters and concluded their character arcs.  Everything feels satisfactoraly closed.  What was brilliant was how they rounded off the character development simply by going back to the basics of each character. Thats as best as I can describe it without spoilers.  They went back to the root characteristics that defined and distinguished each particular character and it was done so through the narrative.

Lost has always been about two things: character and [to put somethign complex in two words] the island mysteries.  The overall concept about what is really going on was perfect.  It all comes together. Everything could be traced back to that root concept if you think about it.  So for all the people saying that not all questions were answered, well they're wrong.  Some of the more major questions, that are plot related were answered directly, and I mean directly.  Just said outright by one character or another.  The remaining questions don't need to be answered and can easily be deduced. Its part of the fun.  If everything was answered it would feel like a class lecture.

Whenever a long running TV series ends theres always 2 ""goodbyes"" happening there.  One between the characters and one between the show and the audience.  Most shows hit one or the other, if any.  This one nailed both.  You will know what I mean when you watch.  The satisfaction you get of the resolution between ""them"" and of you not having more Lost is done just right.  No cliff hanger.  No walking into the sunset and wondering what happens next.

Simply said, this is a work of genius.  With so many intricate pieces created for our entertinament and thought provocation to, in the end, be realized to each be a cog in the figurative machine, I don't know what else to call this.  piece of art, entertainment, and brain massager all in one.

I thought the writing/plots were very well executed. I found the episode exploring Richard Alpert's past quite entertaining; and the exclusion of Ana Lucia from the gathering because she ""wasn't ready yet"", hilarious. Sure, I, like so many other LOST viewers, never had all of my questions answered (Walt's ""specialness""?), but at the same time, I truly enjoyed the ride from the beginning to the end. I think most of those that felt let down by LOST were those who wanted all the answers presented on a silver platter, and all the twists resolved. It wasn't going to happen. Just like life. So instead, the writers left alot of up to your intepretation - that was the best part of the whole ride!",1286409600,3,875,4.509433962264151
4077302,4,B0036EH3X4,"A co-worker of mine once told me in no uncertain terms that she hated Lost and thought that it was one of the dumbest shows on TV. When I pressed her for an explanation as to why she hated the show, she had to admit that she had only watched a few of the episodes, and that her opinion of the show's ending came to her second-hand. A friend of hers had been a faithful viewer of the show from episode #1 and SHE didn't like the ending, and it was that attitute my co-worker picked up on. I recount this because the attitude of either not being involved or wanting to be spoon fed all the answers seems almost endemic in modern viewing audiences. A pity, really, and a certain Hell's fury on those who expect the easy way out when it comes to this show. Lost demands that a) you see all that came before in order to know and appreciate what's happening now, and b) that you don't expect certain outcomes. The joy of this show is in the human drama and the overall message(s). Sure it gets a bit loose at times, a bit too much like Survivor, if you will. One wonders who's going to join with whom from week to week, or be banished.

As a whole I found Lost to be quite entertaining, certainly no less so in this final season than any other. It not without some excess -- there's more people being killed than I generally like to see, more people being shot, blown up, drowned, punched into submission, or just plain having guns drawn on them. But it still works overall.

Season 6 is the culmination of a long story about what was and what could be, about how people need each other, about hope and challenge, change and stasis, death and rebirth, and ages-old mysteries and common human frailties. As for the ending, well, that you can interpret your way. Like it or don't like it, dig or don't dig the quasi-religious or supernatural angle. Same goes for the various archetypes, the motifs, the subtexts, the philosophy, its relationship to mythology (and it's own internal mythology)---whatever. None of it is particularly easy. But it is fun, and bully for you if you get a charge out of  the ride, the message, and the art.",1286236800,3,2126,4.377215189873418

4077335,4,B0036EH3X4,"I started watching Lost a year ago, plowed through until the end of Season 5, and watched Season 6 as it aired on ABC.  While at times I was disappointed with Season 6, overall I'm thrilled with the conclusion and the quality of writing six years into the series.  Rarely will you find a show that lasts this long and still keeps you glued to the screen.

As with all seasons of Lost, Season 6 feels different.  Season 1 was about building characters and discovery on the island.  Season 2 develops characters further while exploring the hatch and the Dharma Initiative.  Season 3 we learn about the Others and follow several stories as the Losties take separate paths.  Season 4 tells the story of the Oceanic Six - how they escaped the island and their lives afterward.  Season 5 deals with their return to the island, the origins of the The Incident, and, of course, time travel.  And now Season 6... what was Season 6 about?

According to roughly 50% of all Lost viewers (maybe more?), Season 6 was about screwing everything up.  It was about either not answering questions or giving crappy ones.  It was about failing to deliver on promises the writers made to their fans.  While I respect these opinions, I disagree.

Even though it wasn't spelled out until its very last moments, Season 6 was about saying goodbye - and love.  In the flash-sideways the writers revisit each character and grant them something they either did not have or failed to grasp during their lives - choice.  Kate will always run.  Jack will always have daddy-issues.  Ben will always hold the power to manipulate.  But in Season 6, Kate chooses the unselfish route by helping Claire.  Jack chooses to have an open, loving relationship with his son.  Ben chooses love over power. Season 6 shows what Jacob robbed them of - the power to choose.  (Sorry buddy, but you failed big time in giving your ""candidates"" choices.)  Reflecting on the difficult lives of the Losties over six seasons, the flash-sideways ends up being utterly tragic, yet heartwarming all at once.  Despite having difficult lives, the Losties had each other, and the flash sideways shows they really were good people.  Live together, die alone?  I don't think so.

Season 6 was also about tying up loose ends.  Exploring major mythology elements such as the Smoke Monster, Jacob, and Richard Alpert's history.  Not all of these answers proved to be satisfying (*cough* Charles Widmore *cough*), but Lost was never strong with concrete answers.  From Day 1, Lost was strongest with mysteries and characters.  Even so, Lost DID deliver answers - not answers to every nagging question, but to the big ones.  It also tied up the island nicely and gave us an emotional goodbye to our favorite characters.  Why the hate, everyone?

It is fantastic that they got to wrap up the series and give the viewer an opportunity to unravel many of the mysteries that have puzzled us since the first season.  I was tremendously disappointed when ""The Dead Zone"" was abruptly cancelled, leaving so much hanging.  As with the previous season DVD packages, the bonus material in the final season package are top notch.  If you liked ""Lost"", this is a must buy.",1285545600,4,453,4.625

4077338,1,B0036EH3X4,"What can I say that has not already been written?  Spoiler alert!!!The characters are dead either because they died in the plane crash in season one or in season 6.  The writers/producers of Lost played a long con on the audience.  They created mystery after mystery to maintain ratings, but they never had intention of resolving the mysteries.  If they had wanted to resolve the mysteries. they would have written the solution to the mystery at the same time as they introduced the mystery into the plot.  What murder mystery ends without the murderer being known?

But even if you completely disagree with my viewpoint and liked the show including season 6, wait to buy season 6.  Prices goes down not up.  On September 12, Lost was at #31 in 19 days of release.  Two days later on September 14, Amazon ran a one day in which you could purchase season for around 425.

Essentially, you can watch the first season and the last episode or two and get as much out of it as watching the entire series. Yes, there were some exciting, intriguing aspects to the show, but to find out that they were ultimately just filler with no real point throws a bucket of water over any of the ""good"" parts. It's not the lack of ultimate answers, it's the lack of any resolution to the stories.

4077353,1,B0036EH3X4,"It is easy to make a gripping and exciting TV show full of intense and incredible scenes, if you as the writer never have to concern yourself with the small detail of how to make it work in the end, how to unfold the story, how to explain all the mysterious things in any meaningful way.
Remember it is these mysterious things that made the show such a hit in the first place.
How often did we sit there and ask ourselves: my God, what could this be? Wow, how is this possible?
And our excitement was due to the fact that we couldn't wait to find out what the explanation was, was it not?
Now imagine you watched the show and knew from the very beginning that all these great mysterious storylines would never be explained at all or the explanation would be totally dumb and very, very thin. Would you have been excited?
I could think of a lot of very cool highly mysterious things to put on a TV show if I never have to bother with how to reasonably explain any of it.
I think we've all been played for fools.
And I am concerned that - in the greater picture - Lost may have opened the box and other franchises have picked up (or will pick up) this idea of how to make easy money on TV.

NO!  they were an unlucky group of people that were choosen to take the spot of leader of the island.  And just so happens some crazy stuff goes down when you gotta take that role.  I thought the final season was great, it wasn't over done and for me it summed everything up perfectly.  If you are a fan of LOST I highly recommend watching this, but if you've never seen lost before you better watch the first 5 seasons or your the one that will be lost.",1285372800,2,614,4.100840336134453
4077356,4,B0036EH3X4,"Lost was always a great show, but not a perfect one. It was always entertaining. It always had great acting. It was frequently heartfelt, and often truly interesting. But it took shortcuts. It contained elements that were there for no reason but creating short-term dramatic interest. Elements that were never followed through in a satisfactory way.

An example is the sequence of numbers that had to be typed in every 108 minutes. If you've seen the last episodes, you know where those numbers came from. But there is no explanation as to why a computer was programmed to require those particular numbers to be typed in, or who programmed it that way.

So, Lost was always a bit lacking in integrity. To me, it was clear that such questions as the reason those numbers had to be typed in would never be answered. It just really didn't make sense, and wasn't going to ever have an answer that was satisfying and complete and resonated with everything else. They cheated a bit in order to add short-term dramatic interest.

The way I dealt with such elements all along was to say: ""Hey, it's not perfect. I accept that the writers cheat a bit. But, if I forgive them for that, and look past those elements, there is a whole heck of a lot to enjoy.""

Many people hate the last season because so much is unexplained. But I submit to you: it was clear all along that there was much that was not going to be explained. Much that was going to turn out to be nothing but short-term dramatic manipulation. No one should have expected the last season to be different than it was, in that sense.

With that background, I will say this about the finale: It was lovely and haunting. It was like a poem. It shouldn't be taken too literally. <The next sentence is a spoiler, so skip to the next paragraph if you haven't seen it.> The image of Jack walking by the stream at the end, while the joyful, healing reunion was somehow going on in some other dimension, outside of time so that others who died at other times could also be there, allowing him to finally let go, moved me to tears. Other elements of the ending had the same effect as I reflected on it, in a fairly blissed-out blur, for 45 minutes after the last episode. That's certainly one of the strongest responses I've ever had to anything I've ever seen on screen. (In fact, the poetic, non-literal nature of the ending actually reminded me a bit of a couple of Stanley Kubrick's films...)

Another reviewer reports that right before the sixth season, it came out that ""Matthew Fox says Lost creators Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse will prove they knew where they were going all along when the show ends in 'an incredibly powerful, very sad and beautiful way. I think is going to be pretty awesome.'""

That reviewer disagreed with Fox so strongly that he gave the sixth season 1 star. But for me, Fox was pretty much right, so I gave it 5 stars the first time I wrote this review.

But on further reflection, due to the cheating the writers resorted to, I can't quite give the season, or the series, a 5. But even so, the very best of the series is a 5+. It's well worth watching. Just don't expect every loose end to be tied up.",1285372800,6,3180,4.451890034364261

This was a compelling ifinal season filled with a clever combination of  of tragedy, laughs, adventure, scary stuff, . I truly recommend not only this season but the series as a whole; it's one wild ride you won't forget. I have never been more hooked on and obsessed with a television series as I was with LOST. When the final season came along I was skeptical that it would be able to live up to the hype and provide a proper ending to the epic tale of science vs. faith, not to mention the classic ensemble of characters, that we've followed for six years. Now that the series is over I have to say that I am blown away; the finale in particular exceeded my expectations.",1284768000,3,810,4.4

I was, like so many people, drawn into the show the likes of which I hadn't been since ""MillenniuM"" and ""The Sopranos"". Naturally, I had to complete my collection and purchase season 6. I am glad that I did. I am drawn to shows that have characters I actually care about---good or bad, it doesn't matter. I cared about almost every character in Lost. The writing for this series was brilliant, as was the acting. The cinematography was breathtaking, especially in HD. A side note, the video transfers to blu-ray are spectacular. There have been many television programs that haven't ended perfectly; interestingly the two shows that I mentioned earlier fit squarely into this category (maybe I am attracted to shows that can't tie up all loose ends;-), but that isn't why I watch television---to have all my questions answered. And even though I did scratch my head a bit at the finale, in retrospect, Lost gave me countless hours of enjoyment. Someday I'll watch it again.

4077390,1,B0036EH3X4,"I can deal with an unsatisfactory ending, but I can't really deal with a pointless ending and broken promises.

After season 3, I was getting worried that we'd just see more and more mysteries and we'd never get any answers. Then when they said there would be 6 seasons, I saw a lot of things that gave me hope:

""From the very beginning, fans and even critics have been saying, 'Are you making it up as you go along?' ' which was 'a legitimate question.'
Now, with a still far-away ending in sight, Lindelof says he and executive producer Carlton Cuse have 'specific designs for ending the next two seasons' and promises that with the answer-filled season finale May 23, viewers ""will begin to get an idea of what that design will be, and it will not be at all what they expect.'""

""Straight from the mouth of Damon Lindelof: 'You won't have to wait until 2010 to get all the answers you really care about.'""

Then right before season 6 : ""Matthew Fox says Lost creators Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse will prove they knew where they were going all along when the show ends in 'an incredibly powerful, very sad and beautiful way. I think is going to be pretty awesome.'""

So I continued and continued and believed I would get an ending that at least somewhat resolved things. The fact that the ending left so many things hanging, and left so many things that didn't make sense--I just can't see myself buying the series! And really, it's not because I didn't enjoy the characters. The worst lie the creators/writers told us at the end is that the show was about the characters and not the mysteries. The characters I invested in are worthless because so much of the series was worthless according to the ending! I feel like I've wasted my time investing emotion in their struggles because so many of their struggles are meaningless. And that might be ok if the story was about meaninglessness--but the story told us it was about meaning!

The struggles in season 6? Half of them are meaningless because they were dead. Whoops, spoiler alert. Their struggles with Walt? Meaningless because they're left hanging. Their issues with Jacks dad. Meaningless because it wasn't him. Lock? Meaningless because it wasn't really him later on. The characters we saw after they died? Who knows what that meant or if they were even the characters. Jacob's actions and everyone on the island's interactions with him? Well pretty meaningless because they were just whatever Jacob wanted to do.

Then there are the mysteries that are solved that still don't make sense in comparison to earlier seasons. If you watch season one again, will the smoke monster make any sense now that you know what it was? Do Loch's actions mean anything now that you know how he ends up? The numbers? It just all becomes meaningless because it had no meaning. How can I even reinvest in the characters if I know so much of it is meaningless? Sayid likes this girl, but he really loves that girl, but he truly loved this girl?

Then there's just the ending. What were they smoking? When did anyone invest in these characters to find out what happened to them after they died?

They said it was all about the characters. But to really care about characters they have to have consistency and meaningfulness. Without that, Lost really lives up to it's name! I can deal with some mysteries left unsolved, but too many of the ones left open make the characters worthless.",1284508800,131,3431,4.657851239669421

4077392,1,B0036EH3X4,"I loved Lost, until the end, though I must say that it was the first 2 seasons that had me mesmerized.  Seasons 3 - 5 were enjoyable, but it was the original magic that continued to fuel my enthusiasm for the series.  That, and the anticipation that ""mysteries revealed"" would cause me, at some future date, to watch the series again, and that I'd enjoy understanding details from the perspective of one who had already made the journey.  No need for that now (horrendous ending), & that's a disappointment.

One question, though, for anyone who cares to answer.  Something that I puzzled over as I watched the show was why so many characters had the names of political philosophers:  Locke, Hume, Rousseau, Bentham [I can't even remember which character Bentham was, but there was a Bentham on the show, right?]  Anyway, I kept thinking that at the end we'd see that somehow these characters, and the role they played on Lost, had some connection to the thinkers whose names they were given, but I feel pretty certain that this was just pretentious b.s. on the part of the writers.  The Christian symbolism at the end seems to be at odds with the whole ""political philosophy theme"" which was suggested by the characters' names. ""Christian Shepherd"" is a name of significance (subtle stuff, guys!!!), while the philosophy stuff, like so much else, seems to have been no more than something to get our minds whirring, with no ultimate significance for the story.  Does anyone know whether the writers ever addressed this?

It's not so much the lack of answers (although that is quite annoying) as it is the near total dissolution of the plot in seasons 1-5. How can a show take major plot arcs such as Ben and Widmore's War and push them into the background? As the season progressed, every character we once thought powerful in the realm of the mythology proved to be quite trivial and powerless - Ben, Widmore, and even Jacob. Please. This is bad writing, plain and simple. The dialogue was terrible, as was the inert pacing of most of the episodes. More happened in five episodes of season 5 than happened this entire season. Biggest disappointment in television history.

""Well, we don't have a way to wrap up the show you've been watching the past 5 years, so here's something else."" That's season 6 in a nutshell. The producers tried pathetically to justify what they did this season by claiming the show was about the characters all along, a debate that has divided fans more than any other show I've ever heard of.

4077398,3,B0036EH3X4,"Prior to season 6, I would have rated Lost as a 5 star show without question. Despite a few weak singular episodes from seasons 1-5, all in all I loved this show and was a HUGE fan. Perhaps obsessively so, I read all the episode recaps (Doc Jensen being my favorite), looked for spoilers and often debated/chatted with friends, family and co-workers over this amazing show. I defended its honor when people would question the direction or label it confusing. I had, up until ""The End"", a lot of confidence in Cuse & Lindelof as writers.

Despite my increasing worry throughout season 6, I kept the faith right up until the finale. I will say that ""Across the Sea"", did almost put the nail in the coffin, but I still wanted to believe there would come an ""ah ha"" moment when it would all tie together. I was even willing to allow a few things unanswered questions or things left open to interpretation, but I never expected them to end the show in such a clich' manner. I also never thought they would end the series without telling us what the island was. ""A Cork"" is not an answer, it's a cop out!

I also felt the sideways world ended up being completely useless and I was baffled that our Losties would choose a multi-denomination church, instead of beach, as their final meeting place. Jacob and MIB ultimately, despite a lot of indication that they were, ended up to be of little importance to the overall story. Honestly, as it turned out these fine actors played out to be more filler then storyline. There we were at the end of the road and the whole story of these two is that their non-mother was crazy and one brother flushed the other down the golden island toilet, thus turning him into the smoke monster. Huh?

After a lot of careful consideration, I've drawn my own final conclusion in an attempt to provide some personal satisfaction. I believe the writer's either had another ending in mind and for some reason couldn't pull it off. Or they lied and never really knew how to end the show. But here is the kicker, if you didn't know how to end the series or how to answer questions that you posed in the first place, why not go for another season? I'm sure ABC would have loved to milk Lost for all it's worth. You didn't do your show or your legions of loyal fans any justice by wrapping it up so absurdly. We didn't need Dogan, Lennon or the sideways world at all. We didn't need Sun to stop speaking English for no apparent reason or Shannon to come back for ha ha's. What fans wanted was answers, conclusion and a little something to think about when it was all over.

And hey, if you wanted to go all religious, why not have the island be purgatory all along? Sure everyone guessed it in Season 1, but at least it would have made all the island nonsensical stuff somewhat believable. The audience could have chalked up the millions of unanswered questions as part of some ultimate soul test. Instead you ended the show with footage of the plane crash and then came back and said it was just for fun, no relevance, the island was after all, ""real""! Jimmy Fallon said best during the 2010 Emmy's, ""I didn't understand it, but I tried.""",1283904000,109,3154,4.442141623488774
4077409,2,B0036EH3X4,"I will preface this review by stating that I did love this show.  It ranks as one of my favorites of all time. I won't allow the ending to take away from that.  Lost was that unique show that one would wait for each week with baited breath.  With that in mind, I just can't find reason to excuse the finale.  The show was about characters, yes, but it also was about the mysteries of the island.  One cannot ignore that.  To simply end the series with an ""Oh the island is magic"" just does not suffice.  All of the mysteries amounted to nothing more than Jacob's rules for said island.  There might as well have been unicorns and elves living on the island as nothing that occurred was ever going to be explained by the writers anyway.  I have spent much time pondering over the ending and only now was I able to articulate what I felt.  The actors wrtr essentially what elevated the show above the material.  But the story itself amounted to nothing much.  I enjoyed the journey, but the destination proved to be a major disappointment.",1283904000,27,1037,4.4
4077410,1,B0036EH3X4,I'm not going to repeat all the problems and praises of this series but suffice to say.....So Very Sad.,1283904000,6,103,4.473684210526316
4077411,3,B0036EH3X4,"Spoilers below.

The idea of destroying the Island by bombs to prevent subsequent things from happening can never work.  The purpose of the Island from the outset is to ensure tight custody of hell from breaking loose whereas the purpose of the guardian and candidates is to protect it.  They are never meant to escape from the Island and definitely not to wipe it out from the surface of the earth by bombs.  We can tell the Island is still intact and there is no signs of holocaust when they woke up on the Island in 2007 right after the bombing.

Things got complicated when Jacob laid down the rule :  all his candidates will not be told of the reasons behind their painful experiences.  They have to figure it out by themselves along the way.

Charles Widmore and his wife have been obsessed by the mysterious power of the Island eversince their youth.  They certainly don't want the Island to be destroyed by Mr Blacksmoke.  Jacob most probably made a deal with them along with a plan to destroy Mr Blacksmoke by Jack, Desmond and their fellowship.  Somehow, Jacob is the only person fully aware of the mechanism of the heart of the Island, among other things, Jack and Desmond's abilities to resist strong electromagnetic current without injuries.

Jacob's twin brother was forbidden to leave the Island by his stepmother because the secret of the Island had been revealed to him and it could not be spread into the outside world.  But in the end, Mr Blacksmoke must never leave the Island because now he is evil.

Even when the Island began to fall apart, its mysterious power turn Mr Blacksmoke into a mortal being.

I am not surprised that Jack most likely survives in the end.
After having the sacred drink, now Jack is like Jacob.  We can see he survived the strong electromagnetic current.  He even managed to get out from the cave all by himself and walked a long way to the bamboo field to lay down to rest.  When Vincent the dog appeared, I bet Rose and Bernard won't be far away just in time to save Jack.

Since there is no more Mr Blacksmoke and the threat to the Island is now gone,  I strongly believe Kate and James will regroup and return to the Island with Penny.  Afterall, the code of fellowship is ""No one is left behind"".

Newborns on the Island are special.  But are they a blessing or a threat to the Island ?  Ben's daughter Alex had been killed and Sun's daughter was not born on the Island, leaving Aaron to be the only child born on the Island. Will Aaron become another Jacob or another Blacksmoke ?

Apparently the unanswered mysteries of the Island will not be fully explained.  We have to find out all the answers ourselves, perhaps from a new series of Lost.

Anyway, Lost definitely deserves a better ending and a new series of adventures surrounding the original Island world irrespective of what happened in the make-believe world which is too good to be true.

Jacob has all the luck.  His twin brother can never leave the Island to see the rest of the world while Jacob can travel anywhere around the world to carry out his recruitment plan.

Jacob makes all the rules and chooses his candidates according to his rules.  Their lives are flawed.  Indeed, everybody's life is flawed, one way or another.  Who isn't?

Whatever it takes, the plane must crash.  The plane crash was definitely no accident.  It appears that Jacob planned it on purpose.  No doubt, there were always casualties.  Were those people died in the plane crash just victims of circumstance or were they just dispensable?  Did they or their families really deserve all this?  What if Jack asks Jacob the same questions?  Will Jacob tell Jack that those people won't die for nothing?",1283817600,4,3695,4.58868501529052
4077412,1,B0036EH3X4,"This is how began as a great science-fiction oriented show. Action paced, amazing acting, big budget. But, already in Season Three, it was clear (to me, at least) that the writers did not know where they were going.

Also, the producers probably turned the process of casting into a big money game. That's the simple explanation for the huge quantity of characters, even new ones appearing in Season Six! (you can almost visualize the scene: an agent asking the producers: ""How much do I pay to get my client in the show?"")

The producers sensed they got a steady following (rightly so, judging the so many great reviews) and thought they could get away with murder. So, why bothering explaining the ""hundreds"" of unansewred questions? We just tell them that ""what matters is the journey"".

To me, the ending was a complete swindle on a faithful audience, one that stuck to the show even after the atrocious Season Three.",1283817600,12,921,4.779874213836478
4077413,5,B0036EH3X4,"When Lost finally wrapped up its final season back in May, the realizatiion of just what the show's creators had managed to accomplish was not immediately apparent.  Lost did not provide a mythology heavy, ""aha, so that's what it all means"" resolution that pulled all of the mysteries and plot threads from the prior seasons together in a way that suddenly made everything crystal clear.  No, what this series had accomplished was something much more remarkable.  When the show's title flashed on that solid black background for the final time, the series had come full circle; bringing the audience back to where this amazing journey had started.  Lost's creative team had managed to construct a self-contained story arc that spanned 6 seasons, tackled huge themes, built a complex mythology, provided some of the most memorable and complex characters in the history of the medium and incorporated elements of science fiction and fantasy.  They also did something even more daring and incredible.  They risked critical and fan backlash by ending the series with a finale that appeared to be far too simple for the labrynth of mysteries leading up to it and refused to provide clear cut and easily identifiable answers to those mysteries.  Say what you will about the final season of Lost, (and many have) but the writer's ended things on their terms. By doing so, they created something rarely seen on television:  an ambitous work of art that is built to stand the test of time.

For those who haven't seen the final season, I won't provide any spoliers regarding the plot.  Things pick up following the detonation of the hydrogen bomb by Juliet at the end of Season 5.  The purpose of this act was to change the past and make it so that Oceanic 815 never crashed on the island and all of the suffering and loss experienced by the survivors could have been avoided.  Right off the bat it appears that the detonation was successful.  We are taken aboard flight 815 in the opening scenes of the first episode, ""LA X"" where it appears that the Losties are en route from Sydney to Los Angeles just as they were at the beginning of the series and none of them seem to know each other or have any knowledge of the events that occured prior to the explosion.  But there are some noticable differences.  Jack has a scar on his neck, Charlie has short hair, Desmond is on the plane and we learn that Hurley considers himself the luckiest guy in the world.  What exactly is going on here?  Before we can even begin to theorize on that, the action shifts to the island where it turns out the bomb didn't work.  Instead, the explosion has propelled Jack, Kate, Sawyer, Hurley, Sayid, Jin and Juliet from 1977 to the present where they must confront John Locke, or whoever has taken his form, who is recruiting people in an effort to leave the island once and for all.

Season 6 jumps back and forth between these two realities (the scenario in which 815 never crashed is referred to as the flash-sideways) as it moves toward the end.  On the island some of the shows key mysteries are answered.  We learn what the numbers mean, why the Losties were brought to the island, the true nature of the island, what the smoke monster is, how Richard Alpert ended up on the island and why he never ages and who the skeletons in the cave from Season 1 are.  All the while, our heroes must decide whether they will join Locke in his attempt to leave or if they will take a leap of faith and stand against him.  Meanwhile, in the flash sideways, we watch as 815 lands safely in Los Angeles and the characters begin to go their separate ways only to find themselves crossing paths with each other again.

I think it's fair to say that this is the most complex and challenging season of Lost.  The pacing is considerably slower than in prior seasoons and the epidoses are much more devoted to character development and thematic elements than with the mythology and mysteries.  The result can feel like a season that is disconnected from the prior five, but the ties to the rest of the series are there.  Season 6 explores the larger themes of fate vs. free will, science vs. faith, destiny, redemption, relligion and love that have always been at the forefront of the series.  The flash sideways in particular is rich with these themes as well as the recurring motiff of mirrors.  This is important since the characters do a lot of reflecting on their pasts and their flaws. Events in the flash sideways also mirror those on the island while the season itself mirrors Season 1 in terms of the focus on character and theme.

As for the finale, it is a work of sheer beauty and genius.  It is deeply moving and satisfying;  tragic yet hopeful, happy yet sad and most importantly, it provides an ending as well as a beginning.  This is not only the case for the characters, but for the viewers as well since the show encourages us to go back to the start and take the journey all over again because as much as we think we know about the island, the characters and the mysteries, there is still more to be learned.  There will always be more to learn and Lost will always exist for current fans as well as future generations who want to take the journey.  In the end, that's what Lost was always about:  understanding that the answers are not always easily obtainable and that you have to work for them.  And your answers may not be the same as the next person's.  That's quite an accomplishment for any work of art, and Lost was without question a work of art.  John Locke said it best:  ""We're going to need to watch that again.""",1283731200,5,5603,4.552894211576846
4077414,5,B0036EH3X4,"So, I am not the biggest fan of how the show ended. It was a little too emotional, or spiritual, or cliche, or something along those lines. I would have preferred they prevented the accident and in another life they lived their lives, became friends through other means, and lived normal lives. Up until the finale, the show could have gone any number of directions. The season still deserves all 5 stars in my opinion. Other than the finale, the season was still amazing and I would recommend it to anybody. Season 6 had some of the best episodes of the series and is a must have for any Lost fan, especially those with the previous 5 seasons. And for those of you who may be curious, the packaging is similar in style to season 5, not the first 4 seasons unfortunately.",1283644800,4,771,4.436619718309859
4077415,4,B0036EH3X4,"I have to be honest, after reading so many negative reviews for this season I was nervous to watch it. I have been watching Lost since the 1st season was released onto DVD and have enjoyed it immensely! After watching the 6th season I am completely satisfied with it and the ending. The 6th season wasn't as amazing as some of the others, but it was still great. The series as a whole has been one of the greatest shows I have ever had the pleasure of watching.",1283644800,4,461,4.25
4077416,2,B0036EH3X4,"I really enjoyed the first few seasons of Lost but then had gotten away from it.  I was excited to get season 6 as a gift.  They didn't even try. I would have rather gotten an explanation that I didn't like, rather than them not try at all. Instead we got a incredibly boring season that spun its wheels until the finale, where through some fancy misdirection from the writers, we were told it was always about love and the characters and all that nonsense you can find on any other average tv drama. How silly of us fans to even think it was about mysteries and dialoge and clues? I can't imagine recommending this dvd. It would be painful to rewatch this season I would just like to forget. I loved seasons one and two. . I cut them a lot of slack because I always assumed the story was going somewhere in the end. Felt like it had to be a masterpiece in the making with all the plot components at work. The writers must have a grand plan. The sixth season merely reveals that the whole series was just a bunch of mysteries for mystery sake and they never had a clue what they were doing as writers. The season was really disappointing, they must of needed new writing talent.",1283558400,11,1178,4.278026905829597
4077417,5,B0036EH3X4,I had not seen any of season six until I recieved the DVD collection in the mail.  It was an amazing journey that left me saddened and thoughtful at the end.  Very well thought out with an ending that moves you.,1283472000,4,211,4.121951219512195
4077418,5,B0036EH3X4,"I for one loved the final season of the show.  I watched the first season snd part of the second season, when they first aired, thinking they were so-so.  Years went by and I watched the second season finale at a friends place on dvd.  This was my turning point.  Season 3 brought Juliet and it's been a roller coaster ride ever since.  I also love the fact that all the island's mysteries were not explained.  Why would I go back and watch all the episodes if I I already know everything.  The island was it's own complex character.  It's a shame that many Lost Fans fall into the generic category of wanting all the answer's.  Heaven forbid that they think or not have everything handed to them on a silver platter, wrapped in a bow.  In conclusion, the last episode was beautiful.  I felt my own closure with the show and the series, and can't think of any other way I would have wanted the show to end. Great series that will be terribly missed.",1283472000,7,949,4.3352272727272725
4077419,5,B0036EH3X4,"The groundbreaking show, that has taken it's audience into a mystified journey tethered on the turfs of fate and coincidence, good versus evil, love and scorn, life and death, finally came full circle with it's long awaited two and a half hours series finale, aptly titled ""The End"". The ending redefines the essence of television in the 21st century: in which a heavily serialized show abound with complex fabrication manages to entertain, educate and spark enthusiasms in the modern age of blogospheres and the evergrowing like-minded Internet community.

I was brought in for the ride six years ago, not knowing the impact it would have on me. A classical tale about a group of survivors stranded on a mysterious island seems too elaborate and bears little entertainment value. After the pilot aired and when Charlie (the rock-star character who died trying to safe his friends from an impending doom in the third season of the show) asked with a puzzling look on his face: ""Guys, where are we?"" - the hook was set almost immediately.

LOST is inventive in its own indefinite genre, hallmarked by its shrewd devices in storytelling. It is artful without looking down on its audience and doesn't, in return, demands anything from them. Instead it did the direct opposite by having the writers to playfully sprinkle the implications of science, religion, philosophy, psychology, literature and history throughout the show, indirectly confounding the audience and consequently brought about an off-the-wall change in regards to the way a TV show is being dissected. Critics have been religiously analyzing, hard-core fans created their own theories, casual fans speculated, tweeted and blogged about their personal views. LOST has gradually amassed a modern and vocal audience unlike any other.

It must be said that to be a LOST viewer, one has to regard oneself as a freak. To miss an episode is like sinking into obscured territories. Mysteries after mysteries started to evolve and answers tend to pratfall and delved into hiding as the series propels. But once it progresses to a definite end date, some of the important answers finally began to reveal itself, often poignantly and at times off the mark, disproving the loyal fan's speculations. Indeed, no show would be able to please every single viewer, hence the ending eventually brought about two conflicting camps: the ones who were fully satisfied and the others who felt somewhat robbed. I for once believe that the journey is much sweeter than the final destination.

LOST can be seen as a convoluted piece of art, a poetry that disguises itself as an enigma and a tapestry of a magnified question-mark. It fills itself with perceptive contraptions and perplexing materials that breaks away from the one-sided school of narrative exercises. Game-changers and cliffhangers aplenty, it tends to throw audience into all sorts of direction but not dispossessing them. LOST provides a platform for similar genre to flourish, but alas they meet their demises (Heroes and FlashForward for examples). It is one of the earliest shows to truly put forth an international casting, a show not afraid to break all the safe episodic TV rules and even more unafraid to bring in politically-incorrect characters (Republican Guard torturer, anyone?) into the intricate scheme.

When seen from a broader perspective, it is a show that talks about life in its basic entity, about you and me, about the castaways burdened with various issues: parental, personal as well as emotional. Flashbacks on their private lives created windows of opportunity for the viewers to slip into their past and see how these people react to the ongoing island events. The past tends to build the foundation of who these characters are, and their decisions on the present often parallels the story of their past. The beauty (or ugliness) of LOST lies in the anecdotes and development of these troubled characters, and they were done by not resorting to the usually trite soap-opera motives. Even when nonessential episodes like Expos tend to hinder the show's momentum, they are good storytelling on its own.

The mythological and scientific parts of LOST are one of the aspects that took TV to a whole new level. Not wanting to back down or conform to the exposition in a common heroes-versus-villains syllabus, the writers gave the setting (in this case the mythical island) it's own historical storyline, at the same time peppering pseudo-methodical topics that goes way beyond our heads, such as time-travel, electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, pregnancy among others. Mixed these into the characters' interconnectivity beats and you have a contemporary saga flashes before your eyes.

Too much have been said about LOST and many more are bound to surface after the series greets it's final curtain call. Missing the show is an oversimplification, but yes, there will be no shows (not right away, I guess) that are able to fill the vacuum in this self-named geek who loves mystery-laden parables invigorated with character back-stories and thematic allusions. Like reading a good fiction, the end is bittersweet.",1283472000,7,5143,5.152095808383233
4077420,4,B0036EH3X4,"I'm not going to go through the plot of ""LOST"" but want to focus on the overall Blu-ray.  By saying that, I did enjoy this sixth season and loved the finale.  But again, I've debated this enough on ""The Fuselage"" and other forums to know that this series and its finale has striked a chord among the viewers (positive and negative).  Here is my feelings of the overall Blu-ray release of ""Lost - The Complete Sixth Season - The Final Season"" (note: Didn't find many easter eggs this time around on the BD release).

VIDEO:

""Lost - The Complete Sixth Season - The Final Season"" is a series that looks incredible on High Definition. Featured in 1080p High Definition (aspect ratio of 1:78:1), the detail of the island is captured quite vibrantly. The green lush plants that surround the island, the blue skies, the blue ocean. Personally, most of the video footage shot in Hawaii tend to be vibrant in colors and ""LOST"" is no exception. This final season's offering continues its wonderful presentation on Blu-ray. You can see the skin pores much more closely, even the stubble or sweat on the faces of the characters, the mucky water, detail of the plants in the dense jungle, the rocky earthtones, the brownish/reds inside the Dharma buildings and just regular objects, the stained blood on the skin of the characters, you can actually see that the blood is actually dry and much, much more.

There is a lot of detail that you just don't see on television and when you see it on Blu-ray, especially for ""Lost - The Complete Sixth Season - The Final Season"", you can't help but be amazed. The colors are just fantastic as blue oceans and blue skies are surrounded by beautiful lush greenery. Blacks are nice and dark and skin tones are natural.

Another wonderful presentation of ""Lost"" on Blu-ray!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

As for the audio, ""LOST"" is featured in DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1. The dialogue is quite clear but one thing that caught my attention is how magnificent the audio is in terms of capturing the ambiance of the island when each person is moving through the jungle. This season tends to have used more panning and audio directional to certain speaker channels much more evident than the first season. Also, sounds of the smoke monster and the growls to the ambiance of the island, explosions, earthquakes, the chanting  of the voices of the island and if anything, they really went all out in destruction and chaos with this latest season.

Audio comes quite clear through the various surround channels. Also, good use of surrounds and LFE. Dialogue is crisp, clear and understandable and the music also comes out alive during certain scenes.

I love how the music for the series sounds and how it really brought an overall mood to certain scenes. The music by Michael Giacchino and the way the orchestra creates that tension for the scenes was awesome. So, music plays a big part in the series and the music soundtrack is just wonderful!  So, once again, ""Lost - The Complete Sixth Season - The Final Season"" delivers in lossless audio.  Fantastic!

Subtitles are featured in English SDH, French and Spanish.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Lost"" was an amazing experience since the beginning.  Meeting new friends and debating topics that I have never done with a TV series before, it was just a fantastic ride with its ups and downs and each episode just capturing my attention and for the most part, just embracing everything that had come out.  From the audio books, the web episodes, the videogame,  the podcasts, the magazine, you name it...I was loving every minute of ""Lost"" and what the writers had to provide for us.

And then it came to this final season and I admit that the flash-sideways episodes were a bit confusing.  In fact, I was wondering where this was all heading and right after each episode, I would head to the Fuselage to see how everyone else was interpreting these flash-sideways storylines.  Was I missing something?  Was I not enjoying these flash-sideways as much and I was more into the original timeline?

But the more we got into the series and to see how Desmond had this connection between the two timelines, I just started to have this silly grin on my face while watching this series because we had a sense that Desmond had to play an important part in this series and then things slowly started to unravel.

But then the original timeline also started to unravel and we didn't know who would turn evil, we don't know what would happen with Sayid and what will happen between Jack, Kate and Sawyer.  And for me, I was so happy to see Jin and Sun back together but then to find myself devastated and sad after watching ""The Candidate"" where favorite characters we have followed for years, were killed off.  We knew something was going to happen, we just didn't know who.  And I admit, I was so bummed out, it affected me the day after.

And then it was time for the final episode and I just felt it was the most fantastic ending for a series on television that I have seen.  Granted, the final episode had a lot to do with faith and if anything, your appreciation for the series as a whole.  I found myself going online and having to explain the finale to so many people.  But it was quite interesting to read of how the finale affected people.  Many, like myself, who absolutely loved it and then those who were upset with the finale and a lot of loose ends not being tied up.

And here we are with the Blu-ray release of ""Lost - The Complete Sixth Season - The Final Season"".  Hyped by many publications and even brought up on the night after the finale on the Jimmy Kimmel ""Lost"" special about how Executive Producers Carlton Cuse and Damon Lindelof will tie up those loose ends on the Blu-ray and DVD release.  So, needless to say, many fans of the series have been awaiting this release.  And with all said and done, the 12-minute epilogue was satisfying.  It may not answer all questions but it does answer the question that relates to Walt (and also the polar bears).

Like every previous release of ""Lost"" we are treated with a good amount of special features.  I wish there were more audio commentary featured (especially for the final episode) and I wish the web episodes or even the Jimmy Kimmel special was included on this Blu-ray but overall, you do get many special features like the previous season box sets and you also get the latest version of ""Lost University"" (note: you must have a Blu-ray 2.0 player to play this.  So, if your Blu-ray is connected to the Internet, you can view this feature).

As for the Blu-ray release of ""Lost - The Complete Sixth Season - The Final Season"", the picture quality is again, amazing.  The detail can be easily seen on Blu-ray and  things that never caught my attention when watching the episodes on television, have now caught my attention this time around. From the skin pores and even the hair on one's arm, to the lush plants and the coarse rocks, the blood, the sweat... the amount of detail that pops is simply amazing.  Audio quality is also used very well through all channels and because we see the smoke monster quite a bit and also quite a bit of explosions and destruction in this final season, lossless audio was well utilized and sounds fantastic on Blu-ray.

Overall, this series was a fitting conclusion to this fantastic series.  Many months since the conclusion of the series, people continue to debate the series finale and I'm sure with the epilogue, there are people who will continue to debate the series throughout the rest of the year.

But in the end, the series did touch millions of people worldwide.  May they be content or upset of how the series unfolded throughout the six seasons, it's all subjective.  But overall, for me, I was quite content with how the series played out from beginning to end.  Do I still have questions in regards to the series?  I sure do (especially when it comes to the characters of Eloise and Jacob).  But on the grand scale of how the writers resolved many of the important questions of the series, I was content with how the final season played out and I admit to feeling a bit saddened that this series, which had become a favorite of mine for six years, is now over.

""Lost"" is definitely the most compelling, entertaining and enthralling drama series to air on television and the cast and crew made sure to end the series on a positive note.  If you have purchased all seasons on Blu-ray, this is a no-brainer and easily a must-buy.  Highly recommended!",1283212800,44,13341,4.784776902887139
4077421,4,B0036EH3X4,"first off let me say this,LOST is an amazing show to be on network tv. it is probably one of the best ever on abc,nbc,or cbs.
i did not watch one episode the entire time,preferring to wait for the dvd. the dvds are stunning. great picture and vibrant colors. i got caught up in this show and give every season but 6 five stars, i would have given season 6 a better rating if not for the ending, i mean, come on, this is the exact ending we all HOPED wouldn't happen, right? so cliche, certainly not up the the standards the show had set right up to that point. but ending a great dramatic show must be very difficult.
i can only think of two that ended with grace and the dignity that the shows deserved. they were SIX FEET UNDER and BATTLESTAR GALACTICA. LOST, at least in my mind, deserved a better ending. does that negate the entire series?
hardly! this was a very good dramatic series. i certainly looked forward to getting each new season on dvd, usually watching it in four or five nights. i was very into it. i highly recommend it.
i just wish they had reached beyond the TWILIGHT ZONE and OCCURENCE AT OWL CREEK to find a more fitting and creative, as well as maybe give a few explanations, ending. apparently, from reading other reviews, many people are happy with the ending, and that is fine. also, there are many people who feel very ripped off by the ending. i can understand that.
in a nutshell...i loved the series. i do no care for the ending and had definately hoped for something different. the writers really seem to have taken the most obvious course to end the show and that is exactly what i had hoped they would not do.",1283126400,6,1643,4.337662337662338
4077422,1,B0036EH3X4,"Aside from a couple of interesting episodes this season had to have been the biggest letdown in television history.

Dozens of intriguing plot lines leading nowhere.  No. Really. Nowhere.  It's not open to interpretation.

The saving grace coming from the privilege of watching great actors such as Michael Emerson and Terry O'Quinn.

We hoped for depth.  We hoped for intelligence.  We believed that we were about to witness something that had never been achieved in television before.  Instead, the writers shamelessly led a dedicated audience of six years into a abyss of absurdity.

A 10-year-old child could have written a better ending.

After discussing the last season with friends, the conclusion we came to was that the name Lost could only stand for the hours we lost trying to make sense of a story that made no sense.

There are worse things in life.  Still, it is a shame to see a unique show with so much potential meet such a pathetic ending.

Season 6 of Lost? One of Shakespeare's great quotes comes to mind: It is a tale told by an idiot, filled with sound and fury, signifying nothing.",1283040000,40,1105,4.752631578947368

Perhaps it lacked imagination, but I must agree with those who feel it was a finale that was filled with emotion. The cast gave some of their finest performances; I liked seeing key ghosts from past episodes return, especially Shannon, Juliet, and Libby. This season gave us 17 episodes, including the extended finale. Many puzzles were resolved, a few mysteries revealed, some new questions surfaced. I don't quite accept the title of the finale as 'the end'. With the complete LOST saga on DVD, I'm going back to the beginning.",1282953600,,813,4.773049645390071

4077425,4,B0036EH3X4,"Like most people, I was completely into this season until the church scene during ""The End"".  My jaw dropped too.  This was practically gift-wrapped as a parallel dimension story and they gave us that?  I agree with another reviewer that said the flash sideways could have been removed.  The island story was definitely more compelling, especially as it became more tragic.  However, there were a lot of questions left unanswered.  What happens to you when you become the landlord of the island?  What is that light and why can it destroy the world?  Why did the smoke monster become a smoke monster?  It just seemed like more time could have been spent on answers instead of the flash sideways that are still making everyone crazy months later because of the show's resolution.

Now on to the extras!  I have to start on the missing extras that should have been there.  Considering there are still people who don't understand how the show ended, why wasn't there a commentary on ""The End""?  It seems crazy not to at least get Damon Lindelof on a commentary for it. Also, it was strange not to see ""The Final Journey"" that aired before the finale as an extra.  Maybe it was because the extras were so entertaining that it just feels as if there were too few.  The best by far is the EPILOGUE!  Yes, some of the cast that survived showed up for what happened to some of the characters and even Dharma after the show ended. And yes, I admit, I am addicted to those Dharma videotapes.  ""Crafting the Final Season"" was also a nice feature to say farewell to the show.  If you're a Star Wars fan and have seen History Channel's documentary on the mythos behind Star Wars, ""A Hero's Journey"" will sound very familiar.  ""See You in Another Life,Brotha"" was helpful for anyone, ahem nearly everyone, still scratching their heads about the flash-sideways. It does make you appreciate that, yes, they did maticulously plan out this season.  The commentaries, as always, were quite entertaining.

Overall, this was a very entertaining set and remarkable final season.  Few shows get to end on their own terms, and this DVD set will make you appreciate that Lost was one of them.",1282867200,10,2167,4.677248677248677
4077426,1,B0036EH3X4,"I think it beyond opinion and in the realm of scientific, evidence-supported fact that LOST season six was a failure of epic proportions. The first excellent five seasons continually promised a great ""reveal"" wherein the mysteries of the island would eventually be revealed and the various strange going's on and machinations of the characters explained. The writers instead gave us this major cop out wherein what was originally set up as a parallel universe premise became some purgatory nonsense. The struggle between Jacob and the Man In Black was nowhere near as interesting as the plot developments of the previous seasons and any dramatic tension is essentially negated by the non-sensical flip-flopping of confused narrative which makes up this season. By the series finale all the promise, mystery and uniqueness of the show is dashed into a syrupy sentimental purgatorial awakening that has as much to do with the rest of the show as the trials of Job have to do with Scooby Doo.

4077428,1,B0036EH3X4,"I assume anyone contemplating buying Season 6 has already seen the show but I'll say spoiler alert anyway.

As almost every fan knows, Season 6 was an utter betrayal of LOST's millions of fans, throwing everything out from the first five seasons, all of the mysteries, all of the twists and turns, in favor of a nondemoninational yet quasi-Christian passage to the afterlife and the strange assertion that it was ""always about the characters"".  The statue! The Temple [To what, we now wonder?]!  The Others!  The relativistic passage through time of the island (per Faraday)!  All for naught.  ""They're just names on a wall, Kate.""  Or numbers.  Which were meaningless(?!)  We were better off with the Valenzetti Equation.  The writers so completely didn't care about the viewer that they were still introducing characters in Season 6 rather than resolving or explaining the mysteries of the Island.  The only leverage we have is to boycott buying Season 6.  Save your money.  Offer to give it to another writer who cares about the show and unravels (and explains) the science underpinning the Island.  I agree with another earlier reviewer who wittily opined the show made time travel possible as it retroactively sucked the joy out of the first five seasons.  Those who were happy the characters were ""re-united"" in Purgatory weren't thinking; they allowed their emotions to rule.  The writers' betrayal outweighs the beautiful cinematography, the musical score, the acting; the one-star is also intended as a counterweight to the mindless five-star grades.",1282780800,21,1559,5.151394422310757
4077439,5,B0036EH3X4,"The blu-ray release of Lost Season 6 is stunning.  If you would like to read an in depth, well written review of this set, check out blu-ray.com where Kenneth Brown refers to it as ""a moving end to a thrilling series, a perfect AV presentation, a must-own release.""  (Here's a link to his review - [...])

The people who were unsatisfied with the Lost finale should have waited to post their Amazon reviews until after this set was released.  I got mine yesterday and the first thing I did with it was watch ""The New Man in Charge"" bonus feature.  What a wonderful coda to the series.  This little 12 minute piece does two things - in its first scene it provides some answers to Dharma-related questions and in its second, gives us one last great emotional, character-based interaction (something at which Lost's writers have always been outstanding).  POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD.  Would you like to know more about the polar bears?  Or would you like a hint at why females who conceived on the island died?  Or where the Dharma palates came from?  This is just some of the fun stuff you get in the first scene of ""The New Man in Charge"".  The second scene of this short wraps up a key character's story line - I'll leave it at that so as not to ruin it.  With Lost, I dig the little details and mysteries like sharks with Dharma logos and dead polar bears found in Tunisia, but I watch the show mainly for the emotional character-based content, so the second scene of ""The New Man in Charge"" was a real treat for me.

In a recent Entertainment Weekly interview, Damon Lindelof stated that he and Carlton Cuse are not indifferent to fan reaction to the Lost finale and that it was cruddy for them to read things from some fans saying that they had wasted six years of their lives.  They didn't waste anything.  Season 6 was fantastic and the new blu-ray set is a wonderful addition to my collection.",1282694400,5,1896,4.48396501457726
4077440,3,B0036EH3X4,"This review is particularly directed at John Carter in the Discussion Thread, ""Frak the Haters"".

I was completely engrossed in the show ever since I randomly caught the latter half of the season 4 finale and was like, ""Uhh...did that island just disappear?!"" I quickly realized this show wasn't just some 'Survivor-esque, Lord of the Flies mashup,' and promptly blazed through the first 4 seasons in order to be ready for the 5th. Never have I been so captivated in a television show as an adult (The A-Team when I was 8 was pretty damn awesome).

I am a philosophy grad student and was taking a seminar on the ""Philosophy of Time"" as the 5th season was airing. It was perfect. (Please check out David Lewis' essay, The Paradoxes of Time Travel to gain new insight on Season 5). Needless to say, the characters (and particularly what was happening TO the characters as reviewer, John Carter, points out) was always interesting, entertaining and very funny. But it was the setting, the mysteriousness and overall themes of 'faith vs. reason,' 'forgiveness vs. retribution,' etc. that really pulled me in. And the paradoxes, sci-fi elements, manipulation, and chess-like plot is what really had me and some LOST friends talking for hours.

And then there was...""The End"". Everything was going fine, even great, until the church scene. I really was beside myself once I realized what was happening; my jaw was literally on the floor in astonishment that the writers were really pulling the half-assed purgatory/limbo card. And it wasn't even wrapping up the series, but just the sideways-flash plot-line that was just thrown in this last season. Which, I may add, was completely void of relevance to the previous seasons.

The reason ""answers"" were needed was because closure was needed. And IMO, closure was not had for the character arcs or the adventures they participated in. Not providing closure for many of the mysteries, least of all for the true mythos of the island and the telos it and its protectors may have had, unfortunately renders the entire story moot. It's fun to merely 'go along for the ride,' but to just drive off a cliff into the void at the end of the ride begs the question, ""Why did I get in the car in the first place?""

Don't get me wrong there is still plenty to take away from LOST; 95% of the series was absolutely wonderful. The way I plan on achieving solace with the show, is watching this last season again and skipping every flash-sideways scene (except when Kate is in the precinct; the dialogue between her and Sawyer is hilarious), since I see no point in regarding the flash-sideways/purgatory/limbo universe as existing. It's also a shame that Jack's dying scene, which would have been sincerely emotional for me, was spliced with the church, 'everybody-goes-into-the-light scene,' which was astonishingly bad.

I would appreciate any feedback on this point alone: The last season would have been much, much better if every flash-sideways scene did not exist, even with nothing replacing it (let alone if they actually used that time to further develop the on-island plot). Which is why my personal remonstrance is to pretend it doesn't.",1282694400,13,3177,4.906890130353817
4077441,1,B0036EH3X4,"Season 6 completely and utterly killed my interest in this once great show.  The copout Alternate timeline of Season 6 essentially marginalized everything that happened in the first five seasons by providing a ""Happy Ending"" in the afterlife.",1282694400,20,242,5.368421052631579
4077442,5,B0036EH3X4,"Lost has taken me on a fantastic journey like no other piece of entertainment has.

I'm no fan of television; I find it boring, trite and highly predictable, with the majority of prime time muck revolving around pathetic attempts at storytelling with no real direction. Heck, you don't even get a sense of mortality for most characters on the majority of television shows because each episode ends with the good guys winning and the bad guys losing. Lost is nothing like that, and that is why I fell in love with it. There really are no 'bad' guys in Lost as each character, even the ones that appear menacing represent just one aspect of humanity that is nevertheless essential to our evolution as a species, and that is the beauty of Lost.

Season 6 picks up where Season 5 left off: did the bomb go of? Were the time travelling losties returned to their present time-line? Did the detonation of said bomb (if it actually went off) make it so that flight 815 never crashed on that mysterious island? What follows is an amazing, if convoluted season that, while answering a great many questions brought up throughout its past 5 seasons raises many more (and leaves some questions unanswered). For those of you that were drawn to Lost because of its 'figure it out on your own' mentality, then all is as it should be. Nothing could be closer to the truth than the finale, which turned away more fans than George Lucas ever could. There are still viewers who don't understand the ending, and all I can say is...it is brilliant!

From the very first episode it was evident that there would be no spoon feeding to the audience, which of course spawned a massive hurricane of theories and what-ifs. As the answers slowing revealed themselves many ""fans"" found themselves at odds with the writers of the show, as if they (the audience) knew the show better than the writers. Some of the proposed theories turned out to be correct, while others fell flat on their false faces. While I would never make the claim that the writers knew how every episode and every season would pan out from the start (and I would never be so self-important to even assume as such as all great stories are created on a whim from inspiration and such), I do believe that the general outline of the story was known before the pilot episode of Season One aired. I believe they had the beginning plotted out and the very end; everything else in between was either partially planned or envisioned as the show progressed, and what a wonderful progression it has been.

Character progression is a very important element to me, and Lost has it in spades. Comparing the mentalities of the characters from Season One to their mentalities in Season Six it is very evident that these characters have evolved. From Jack's logical science mind to the fate imbued Jack of Season Six, each character evolved in a way that no other show has ever presented. Sure, some of the characters in Season Six (namely Claire, Sun, Jin and Sayid) didn't get their due, and felt largely wasted and more or less served as cardboard cutouts, the majority of the main cast had their stories fully explained. From the beginning Lost has always, I repeat, always been about character development. I challenge you to watch every single episode from Season One on and tell me that this isn't so. The mysteries and the mythology have been there as well, but it has always played a backseat to the characters (hence the myriad of flashbacks and love triangles etc). The mythology served more as an impetus to add unconventional aspects to a drama show, elements that would propel the show far beyond the average swill that usually populates your black box. Lost is a confusing, and at times frustrating experience, but one thing is for sure, it is poignant, beautiful and truly epic.

While the argument that Season Six feels rushed and more or less a season of the writers spewing forth answer after answer is not entirely incorrect, it loses sight of the purpose and crux of the show. The show has always been about fate vs. free will, science vs. faith, black vs. white, up vs. down; the show has always been about the polarities that unite and divide humanity in its plight and journey in this unknowable and mysterious world. The fact that we (the audience) received so many answers in such a rushed pace during the final season of the show is more owed to paying service to all of the angry and demanding fans that couldn't figure things out for themselves, as well as completing the circle that is Lost. Why did the writers wait until Season Six to reveal some of the nagging questions that had reared their head since Season One? Well, for starters they obviously didn't have all of the answers right away, which should be a given since great stories take time to craft and unfold. Second, even if the writers did know the answers to their questions before hand it would have ruined the show if they revealed all of the answers throughout every season. Part of the allure of Lost were the mind blowing finales that left you scratching your head, pondering what it all meant in swift anticipation for the next season. The fact that I can re-watch every season over and over again is a testament to how amazing the show is. If you are a newcomer to Lost, I highly recommend giving it a chance, as you will surely be introduced to a story that is unlike any other, yet so much like every other that you can easily identify with many of the core themes inherent within its masterful scenes.

As for the Blu Ray, the picture quality is unmatched. Detail is abundant and the picture looks very natural. Colors are vibrant and pop off your screen like the best HD has to offer. Audio is excellent as well. As for supplements we get your typical 'making ofs' and such as well as another follow up to the Lost University program, and finally 15 minutes of more Lost, in the form of another episode that answers more questions in a very satirical way.

From the sly literature and pop culture references to the deep, underlying philosophical and spiritual overtones, I highly recommend Lost Season Six on Blu Ray. Oh, and the finale will definitely make you feel something.",1282694400,22,6207,4.627041742286751

4077444,4,B0036EH3X4,"Season 6 of Lost, on its own, is frustratingly rushed in spots, and at other times meanders on with side characters who may or may not mean anything to the show.  If this sounds like the first 5 seasons to you (particularly 4 & 5), then you know what to expect. And you'll know in your heart that all of your answers will not be forthcoming with season 6. If you're expecting season 6 to answer...well...anything, then you obviously haven't been watching the same show as me.  However, I was sufficiently satisfied with the ending, and I never felt ripped off, or conned.  I watched this show for the mysteries, and they kept me watching for 6 seasons.  So the final ""answer"" only addressed one aspect of the show, so what?  How could anyone who has watched and loved this show think it would be any different?  And on this ""theory"" that the writers are con men, every show is a 'con' if taken to that level of cynicism, because the shows are not real life...they're meant to entertain, and they have to kind of fool you into watching.  Every piece of media released does the same thing.  And if you feel disappointed in the ending, that's fine, and I won't say you didn't ""get it"" (which is really just a person who liked the endings way of saying ""you're an idiot"").  I will say this:  after every season, there were questions, and it was obvious from season 3 on that there was never going to be a way to answer all of them.  It's just not possible unless you used each subsequent season to answer the previous seasons mysteries.  Knowing this was the path they chose early on, I am fine with the ending, because there would be nothing worse than jamming 185 'answers' down our throats in a finale, or even a full season.  The ending wasn't necessarily ambiguous, but it made the prior season/s very much so.  And to me, that was the feel they were going for the entire time.

When you're dead you can time travel all you want, talk to smoke monsters, see things that don't exist and even ressurect to die again. Wow, how come I haven't thought of that before! Amazing writers these guys...

Come on, they had you believing for 5 years, 5 years, that it would not be something so stupid as this. The ""they are all dead"" theory was the one everybody came up with in the first place, at the very begining of season 1. And they had you believing it would be something TOTALLY diferent.

I am so glad I never bought the previous seasons because this season makes everything, EVERYTHING, that happened in the previous seasons pointless. I was sad when Cheers ended, sad again when Friends ended, and sorry to see Ally McBeal go too. This was the first ending to a show that left me mad. By the first few episodes I was already frustrated at all the ""new stuff"" they were adding but still I could not bring myself to believe the guys who created this wonderful story would fail so enormously in the ending. But I was wrong and this season was so bad that I can't believe it was written by the same guys.

So not only would I not buy this on Blu-Ray or DVD, I wouldn't buy the previous seasons now (which I had planned on once it was all over).

4077447,2,B0036EH3X4,"Jacob's fake mother was right.

On Sunday, May 23rd, Two-Thousand and Ten, we all went down to the light and experienced something much worse than dying.

This ending of LOST.

But before I continue with this denunciation of the denouement of LOST, let me be clear: If I punch you in the face and you tell me you didn't like that, can I defend myself and say ""You just don't get it, man!""

What I'm saying is, I think you can understand the ending of LOST very well and legitimately hate it.

UNREALITY USUALLY DOES FEEL UNREAL

The Island was Purgatory.

Don't misunderstand me. I believe that the survivors of Oceanic 815 DO survive the plane crash that occurs in the pilot episode. What the Island does is function as the true Purgatory. The ""real"" Purgatory, the one of Season Six, has no actual restorative or redemptive point, both in contrast (addressed later) and because this Purgatory, unlike The Island, doesn't exist.

That unreality is a big problem - because, in the same way that the accomplishments of your dreams feel cheap when you wake, it's hard to believe there's true redemption for a character when their actions occur in a dream world. Especially when that idea is unsupported, which I'll also address shortly.

This is why many were concerned that The Island was a mystical limbo and the Survivors didn`t actually survive, because it would invalidate 6 years of watching this fantastic show. It's the dreaded ""it was all a dream"" ending. Instead, only half of Season Six is mystical limbo and is invalidated, because when Jack is a good father to a son that doesn't exist and Sawyer chooses Law and Order as his path to avenge his parents in a dream, that ISN'T redemption. And I think why this is, is because the show itself is not real, but we suspend that disbelief. But to create another layer of unreality, call it a ""dream world"" or ""limbo"" or ""whatever"", this is too much, and they cancel each other out. Especially, again, when this idea is unsupported in the show.

EVEN THE BEST IDEAS NEED TO BE LET GO OF IF THEY NO LONGER FIT

Time travel, though bizarre and often unexplained, doesn't bother me because it had been setup in the show and explored. The Island exists in a different space/time, so maybe the characters can too. Fine. But the idea of the characters creating a world for themselves in the afterlife comes out of no where - like getting a greeting card in the mail for a holiday that doesn't exist. I don't think you can spend 6 years on a TV show and in the last few minutes throw in a totally unsupported idea.

The End, in the end, fails in part because unlike ""Pans Labyrinth"" and ""American Beauty,"" the idea of a mystical world created by the love these people had for each other was never supported. It's too big and vague and dreamy to just throw into the air and expect people to accept it without any legs.

The other part of it's failure is that it feels tacked on. From what I understand, the ending has been known all along, and maybe as an idea it's clever and beautiful, but I think that the show had out grown and moved on to a different ending. But instead of recognizing this, the writers who agreed with this end forced an old idea into a puzzle it no longer fit in.

WATERED DOWN WATER

If the point of the ""sideways world"" was to realize how important everyone was to each other, I would say that's a joke. Jin/Sun, Claire/Charlie, Kate/Jack, they all figured that out in the previous world, The Island. If the point was to let go of your past, again, that was the point of The Island. Where you could be anyone and start over. If the point was to come to be at peace with your own death, Rose invalidates it. Charlies acceptance of his fate invalidates it. They already had that peace. All that happens in the ""sideways world"" was the characters remembered their past time on the island, and for that, they are now ready? There were no great realizations, no new connections made. In short, it had no real function. It was just a collection of ""clip show"" moments, where the characters could come back together and say ""Hey, I know you.""

It was on The Island that Jack, Locke, Charlie, Claire, Kate, Sawyer, Hurley and the rest of our beloved Survivors let go of their past. That's where they realized how important they were to each other; where they loved and KNEW they loved each other. Here is where they redeemed themselves from a pointless, empty life.

An argument being made is that it functioned as a place where Jack could finally let go. I would counter that he already let go. Jack dies on The Island with a smile, knowing he fulfilled his purpose; that he saved his friends and The Island, if not the world. What did he do in The End? He came to terms with his death when he opened up an empty casket? He already came to terms with his death. Jack knew he was dead when he made the decision to go and replace the cork. Jack already let go; by giving into his fate, to protect The Island, and by giving control of the Island over to Hurley.

This is why The End is so unbearable, because we already saw redemption. We already saw the realization of how important they all were to each other, so to see it again and in such a cheap, superficial way is heart breaking.

This second Purgatory functions only in the way that the waters in Dante's Purgatory do. The River Eunoe gives back to its imbibers their good memories. And this is the ending to LOST? A cliff notes version of something everyone - the writers, the characters, and the viewers - already knew deep in their soul? That they mattered to each other? This is The End?

AND THE WORST PART IS ..

This is the first time I've felt hate toward this show and now it's gone. This is Jack and Christian Shepard all over again, ending on a angry note, but here there won't be another episode of LOST to come around to redeem it. I won't touch the casket of Season Six and feel peace.

What this ending does is make me feel tricked. That things like the flash on the screen and the corresponding time shift for Jack, Kate, and Sawyer from the Season Five finale (indicting Jughead went off); these were nothing but coins an adult would seemingly pull from my ear when I was a kid. Being cute with editing tricks.

MY OWN PRIVATE """"END""

How did I want LOST to end?

I never cared about being told all of the answers: Where this statue came from? Why Walt was so important? They weren't things I was concerned about. What I cared for was that LOST would end in a way where I was surprised and happy. That's all (though a lot). The way I felt when Charlie died, or when I learned that Jack, when he's waiting at the edge of the airport, that that was the future and he is demanding they go BACK to the Island! Joy! Surprised! These are the feelings I wanted, or even needed, for this shows last minutes but where were they?

Instead, here we are 4 days later, and I'm still left with my hands in a confused, swearing pose. The same reaction I have to watching every other stupid TV show, and that's what was so special about LOST. It wasn't every other stupid show.

I was going to write out how I would have ended the show, but it doesn't matter. This is how it ended. This is how it always will end: ""What's done is done"".

But I will ask why the meeting place was a church and not an airport?

An airport is a better symbol of the faith they had in each other, because THAT is relevant to this show. A church is just a building in the world of LOST, and that's all it is here. A superficial symbol of the faith and the after life.  Much like Season Six was, just a superficial version of the previous years.",1282521600,40,7644,4.374029640084686
4077448,5,B0036EH3X4,"Everyone has their opinions.  That is a simple fact.  But here's mine: I loved the end of the show. LOST has always been one of my favorite shows due to the strong characters, creative story lines, and the deep mythology.  I always found it enjoyable to think about solutions to the mysteries and what the show actually meant.  So, going into season 6, I was excited to see if any of my predictions came true.  Although not all of my questions were answered, I was deeply impressed with the CHARACTERS' stories within the show.  Some of these episodes were so beautifully written, it amazed me how characters on a TV show could make me feel so emotional.  Thus, I was extremely pleased with ""The End"", as it resolved the characters' stories.  No matter what way you look at it, the show was about these characters and their adventures.  Not all of the mysteries were answered, but I think that is what the point of the ending was: not everything is going to be given out to you in life.  Sometimes you have to think about what certain things mean and come to your own conclusions.  I'm not going to lie, was I somewhat dissappointed that not all of the mysteries were answered? I was.  Did the season pan out like I had anticipated?  No.  However, I still respect the jobs that the writers did, and I especially commend the ""final reveal"" of the show.  To me, it was not a cop out; instead, I felt that it really touched upon what LOST was all about: the characters.  Overall, I highly reccomend the Sixth Season, as it is a fitting end to a truly great series.",1282521600,34,1561,4.424561403508772

I actually really loved a great deal of the episodes in this season. There were many highly entertaining and (to me) fascinating entries. I loved first season, and season 6 returned to the slower, character-driven stories that got the show rolling. I loved the dynamic of Jacob and MIB and actually wish this season spent more time on exploring that through time. However, I'd agree that the episode ""Across the Sea"" focused on their background had a lot of problems.

In any case, what I'd say is that the creators became fascinated by the sideways time line and spent too much time developing and explaining that, and then didn't spend enough time providing more detail about the island itself, miscalculating (I think) how much should be answered and how much should remain a mystery. In essence, they should have explained the island, BUT left the sideways time line more up for interpretation. That balance would have made me happier, at least.

But, you can't go back and change it. Perhaps some of the bonus material on this DVD set will make the ending more satisfying to a number of fans that enjoyed but didn't completely love season 6.",1282262400,4,1317,4.572033898305085
4077464,2,B0036EH3X4,"What happened, happened: plot holes, tangents, sloppy writing, character dead ends. Few mysteries satisfactorily (or even competently) resolved. LOST was, like the pre-island career Saywer so excelled in, just one long con.

And it's important to keep that in mind because LOST was a commercial enterprise -- neither a life-affirming drama nor mystical exploration. It was always designed to keep viewers engaged, cast/crew employed, the network enriched and sponsors happy. From that perspective, it succeeded tremendously. (And yes, I'll probably buy this season's blu-ray set, like a sucker.)

I was on to the creators' BS campaign when they started backpedaling during the previous season, dropping alibis about ""character arcs"", and generally trying to sell everyone a load of crap about how unresolved questions make for better storytelling.

I just wish the creators would have made the effort to reward their audience with something less emotionally manipulative. ""The End"" was a cheap ploy that nearly besmirches the entire series legacy. It makes me doubt I'll watch any future program Cuse or Lindelof creates.",1282176000,14,1121,5.505813953488372

I've already seen the 12 minute epilogue, and I don't really feel like watching this series for a 4th or 5th time...especially with the way it attempted to ""wrap"" things up.  Maybe when this season hits around $25, I'll buy it.  The whole season is awful and unrelated to the rest of the series.",1282089600,12,461,4.725

You just knew you had to get something in. Anything. Just as long as you were able to make some semi-coherent attempt to tie it all together.

Well, that's Season 6 of Lost. It is completely and indisputably a Hail Mary attempt to wrap up the series. Maybe the network cancelled on the creators at the last minute, maybe they just wanted to just cash in their chips - worth seven figures I'm sure - and buy their own island. Whatever the reason there is zero, ZERO logic to this last season. They chucked all the buildup of the previous seasons out the window in favor of some half-baked Hollywood schmaltz culminating in the last 15 min where they abandon any attempt at resoloution and basically have Christian tell Jack AKA We, the audience that you're never going to get any answers, it was just a fun ride, let it go, bye bye.

Without a doubt the biggest let down I have experienced with any kind of television. I will never watch anything those creators make again. And I'm sorry but I understand some folks felt emotionality of the ending was enough for them, which is fine, but PLEASE do not pretend that there was a grand scheme and that season fits in in any way w/ the previous ones. There is zero logic that will make that argument work.

P.S - I have just finished reading Stephen King's The Stand, which the writers have mentioned as an influence for the show: they're right. There is a heck of a lot of The Stand in terms of themes and character development, and brilliantly done. But there's one thing the Stand has that Lost didn't - a real ending. In fact, you can see exactly where the writers were probably going to take the story if it followed its natural progression. So I still can't help but feel that the plug was pulled on Lost at thge last minute and they scrambled, because if they had use the end of the Stand, including the Epilogue a la MIB and Jacob replacements, Lost would be the classic many of us hoped it would be.",1282003200,25,2095,4.380462724935732
4077467,1,B0036EH3X4,"The show was great as I was hooked onto it for six years.  The reason movies like Sixth Sense or others were watched over and over was they made you wondered how did you miss the clues the first time you watched the movie.

Lost was an insult on the face of all the audience and we all know no answers were given and the show ended abruptly.  So, I would not buy Lost final season Iam happy with 1 to 5 seassons",1282003200,12,411,3.927710843373494
4077468,4,B0036EH3X4,"I've discovered by reading these threads that there is an innate sense of disappointment and abandonment from the fans, both new and old, regarding the last three seasons of LOST.  Like any film or tv show, or piece of artwork that makes the watcher question their own sense of being and self worth, LOST isn't going to be for everyone.  If you're looking to shut your brain down for a while, go watch an actionflick.  LOST is a journey and for those of us who still enjoy the show, even after it is gone, it will remain one.  I don't regret watching over 100 hours of TV at their original times every week.  I don't regret it because I enjoyed the anticipation of finding out what happened next.  Of course questions were left unanswered, people.  Do you really think we ever get all the answers to life?  I found myself crying like a baby during the last episode because I had grown up with these characters for 6 seasons.
Truly, that is something that a lot of people who are just discovering LOST are having issues with.  The immediate gratification of knowing what happens the next week within seconds makes us lose a little bit of that anticipation that comes with a show like this.  Do I think Season 6 was a little weak?  Yes I do.  But do I think that it was a colossal waste of time, like every person with a 1 star comment does?  Of course not.  Season 6 is a perfect bookend to Season 1, and it goes without saying that you need need need to purchase the entire series to appreciate it.  LOST is one of those shows that you need to watch from beginning to end, without any outside bias.
As a quick comment to those haters of the show, I'd like to point out a few things.  1. Guys, LOST was made to raise questions, not give you the answers up front.  You need to earn those.  If you haters complain about how the writers were ""con-men"" then congratulations, you've just been conned.  I felt that it was worth it.  2. I'll admit, some questions weren't answered.  Sure, there are some pieces of the puzzle (Ben and Whitmore) that weren't really answered.  Sure, there are some points that got thrown on the side of the road, but be adults and deal with it.  Brush them off and move on.  3. No guys, they were not dead for the entire series.  Anyone who thinks that definitely didn't watch the show or ""get it"".  4.  By ""get it"" I mean actually emotionally invest in the show.  If you were watching this show for answers, instead of watching it to simply enjoy the journey, then you've missed the point.

All in all: Season 6 as a whole.
4 STARS
PROS: The ending, of course.  One of the best ensemble casts of all time.  Bizarre timeline switcheroos.  Seeing some old friends.  Hurley one liners.
CONS: This season doesn't hold up on its own.  You need to see the entire series to appreciate it.

4077479,2,B0036EH3X4,I watched lost from the very beginning. I followed the show the way I had never followed any tv show before. I never missed an episode and would even buy the dvd seasons as soon as they came out. I really felt like it was a new and fresh show. Over the years I became concerned because it seemed like the writers were creating more mysteries and questions than they could possibly answer or explain adequately. I still stayed loyal because I would hear them talk about how they had many parts of the show planned from the beginning and I loved the characters and mystery of the show so much that I kept watching. I cannot believe how much they ruined the entire show in the 6th season. Looking back on all of it now you can tell that they were flying by the seat of their pants the whole time. It's not that they left just a few questions unanswered they left dozens of questions and mysteries unanswered and the questions they did answer they did it in a sloppy and forced way. I wish that I could complete my dvd collection and recommend the show to others but I cannot do that. I felt like I should warn people before they become too invested in the show because you will most likely be very disappointed.,1281830400,17,1208,4.302631578947368

As the the fans guessed from the beginning, the show became too complicated to write a competent ending, so it conveniently turned out that they were all in purgatory. The interesting and mysterious plot that had been building up for several seasons between Ben and Widmore was abandoned for a last-minute, underwhelming battle between two less interesting characters, Jacob and the so-called ""Man in Black."" These two characters should have remained mysterious and minor.

The heightened suspense and creative magic that Brian K. Vaughan brought to the show in Season 4 really made for a disappointing contrast when compared against the final season. Nevertheless Lost was an imaginative show that is worth experiencing. Sure, it is slow in places and there are characters who are extraordinarily tiresome, but the overall concept, exciting mysteries, beautiful locations, and a handful of strong performances (Michael Emerson) make it worthwhile.",1281830400,19,1108,5.441860465116279

The writing was amazing, the acting was decent most of the time, and the warped up storytelling just made it all the more compelling.  I have to say this is some of the best writing television has ever had... until it had to end.
Ever since season 3 producers have been talking about how the end had been planned since back then and that they weren't just making things up as the went.  The stressed they wouldn't use any trick devices (Deus Ex Machina) promising it wouldn't all turn out to be some sort of dream... so they did the next best things.  SPOILER: Turns out they're deceased.
I personally feel insulted after 100 hours they come this lame conclusion, proving once and for all that Lost got a little to big, a little to wild, and a little to esoteric for them to handle efficiently.

I was completely in love with this show and preached LOST to everyone I know because I followed it religiously.  The mystery, drama, action, suspense, story, acting, characters, plot-twists, flow, were all more than superb.  Every single episode I tried to find mistakes, I tried to find something that the writers did wrong and I couldn't find it; everything was just PERFECT and nothing made me happier.

That perfection was destroyed in Season 6.  Everything that had made this show the marvel that it was had been replaced with the nonsense and disgrace that is Season 6.

Absolutely nothing crucial was ever answered.  Even worse, MORE mysteries were introuduced in season 6 that weren't even going to be answered by its conclusion.  I mean really, THE FANS OF LOST COULD HAVE WRITTEN A BETTER SEASON THAN THIS.  Thanks to these writers,  I WILL NEVER WATCH ANOTHER NETWORK TV SERIES EVER AGAIN.  If LOST was not able to fulfill its own promise, no other show ever will.  I have completely LOST my faith in all network television.

Up until Season 4, there were many intriguing plot aspects that bordered on Sci-Fi; unfortunately, with the rating plunge and subsequent re-writing, they created a simplified storyline that was easier to understand for J6P - and delved more into the ""Soap Opera"" aspect to lure the inherent female demographic who were there simply to see the ""hunks"".

Bottom Line: The show was ruined by Studio Executives during Season 4. It was a situation of ""Dumb-Down the show for the simple-minded proletariat, or get canceled"". As usual, it's all about the Money...",1281398400,4,1559,4.724264705882353

I understand a group of fans are disappointed because they did not get the answers they needed, but in my case I watched the show for different reasons: the characters. I learned to care about them, to feel what they felt, to understand them, and to live catharsis thorough their sufferings. I think the final episode was a perfect homage to these characters and it was an extremely moving television experience. And especially because, Jack, my way favorite character, was at the center of the final arc of the story. I only can say, thank you, writers, for showing respect to viewers like me, who invested emotionally in your creation. Great show (although not crazy about the whole season)...

Was it because you REALLY needed to know how the Hanso Foundation got a hold of the ship log of the Black Rock that Charles Widmore procured at the auction in S4?  Or was it because the writers of Lost created an amazing group of compelling yet flawed characters that we wanted to see redeemed?  Look, I get it; half the show was the mystery and mythology of this strange place, the Island.  What WAS it?  The Garden of Eden, complete with a snake-like smoke monster?  The Cradle of Life?  A fulcrum in space-time?  The fact is the build up was always going to bigger than any tangible explanation the writers could offer, so in a way, the mystery of this amazing place will endure as an allegorical construct to which each viewer will interpret their own way.  Any moderately capable writer could set up a relatively intriguing premise to catch your interests, but without great character writing or amazing casting...this initial interest would quickly evaporate (""V"" and ""Fast Forward"" quickly come to mind.)  The story was ALWAYS about the characters.  In the finale, the characters' resolution was more emotionally poignant that I could've imagined.  Ending where it began, with Jack and Vincent, with the mantra of the show echoing in my head,  ""Live Together or Die Alone""......brilliant!

To all the sci-fi haters pissed that every little wormhole or flux-capacitor wasn't  explained, and who never understood that this first and foremost was a story about lost souls taking a  journey of redemption....look on the bright side; I hear there's a new Starcraft game for you to geek-out on.",1281225600,25,1687,4.846153846153846

From the pilot episode all the way to the addendum of the show with the postscript, I have been hooked on 'Lost'.  Over the years the show offered so much food for thought and so many discussions amongst my friends about the meaning of the show and the meaning of actions of the characters that those things cannot be taken away...they were wonderful moments.

I felt as though it they were more concerned with comforting their audience then tying up the plot. I felt like they basically took everything that had happened over the last five seasoned and made it all totally irrelevant in the final episode, most of which, made little or no sense.

All of the characters are given a beautiful sendoff and leave you with complete closure for the characters. Not a single character is left without an ending. All of them are given the time and attention they deserve in this final season, and some amazing acting from the always stellar cast seals the deal. Is this the best season of Lost? No I don't think so, but it ranks number three on my list trailing season three and season one. The series finale though sits very high on my list and I find myself watching it over and over and each time I am left breathless by the beauty of the final episode and final scene in particular.

For one thing, Michael Giaccino's music hit the nail on the head.  Imposing, yet poignant, foreshadowing yet beautiful.  I cried for days afterwards because what was important not only about the final season, but the series finale, was how far every character had come (except for Kate.  The writers did NOT do that character justice).  The flashes-sideways of what might have been had the plane never crashed were touching and meaningful, and by the end IT DIDN'T MATTER that every question wasn't answered.  The IMPORTANT one was.  (Funny how we hope for answers on T.V. and in books when we can't get them in life.  Why should they be any different?)

4077517,3,B0036EH3X4,"Lost is a show that had everything in abundance - drama, suspense, mystery, love, humor, poignancy, terrific acting, beautiful scenery -- well you get the idea. I loved this show. From the heartpounding Pilot episode on, I was hooked. When other people stopped watching and said it was too confusing, I stuck with it. When the writers announced a few years back that they were going to set a time limit to this series, I was thrilled. Things were getting a little too crazy and Lindelof and Cuse had introduced a few too many mysteries. This was a golden opportunity to wrap the story up, answer dozens of questions, etc., and there was plenty of time to do it.

Season Six started off with a bang for me with LAX. I loved it and it felt like things were indeed going to come full circle with the characters. There were lots of episodes to come. And then of course, came 'What Kate Does' and even though I really disliked it, I'm the forgiving sort and I figured things would get better. I did find myself disturbed by the introduction of yet even more new characters (Dogen and Lennon) when we still lacked resolution for most of the familiar ones. C'mon, guys, there isn't THAT much time to get to all the Island Mysteries!

And I couldn't help some misgivings over what seemed the needless, rather baffling torture of Sayid. But I'm easy to please and I forgot about all that for the next several episodes. Dr. Linus featured some brilliant acting by Michael Emerson. Of course, eventually we got to 'Recon' and as much as I adore Josh Holloway it was a pretty sub-par episode that really added *nothing* to the plot. Nothing. Besides, I never liked Charlotte anyway.

But things picked up again with the next episode (and the *true* highlight of the season) with Nestor Carbonell's incredible, career-defining episode, 'Ab Aeterno'. Holy cow, what a performance! It was like a big screen moment on the small screen and one I enjoy watching each time. That brilliance was followed by several more good to very good episodes.

Then, of course, as all true Lost fans know, came 'Across the Sea' which quickly demonstrated that turkeys aren't just confined to Thanksgiving. I actually felt embarrassed for Titus  Welliver and Mark Pellegrino. The woman who played the mother was dreadful as was the whole episode. Thankfully, that was followed by 'What They Died For' which (hopeful Lost fan that I was) had me convinced that 'The End' would really provide some soul-satisfying answers.

Now, you have to understand that I actually liked almost all of Season 6. There were some great performances - Nestor Carbonell in Ab Aeterno, Matthew Fox delivering some of his best acting of the whole series (""want to try another stick?"" was great), the always brilliant Michael Emerson, Josh Holloway in the dock scene when he was talking with Kate (they didn't give Josh enough to do Season 6 [very disappointing], Terry O'Quinn for his dual role as Locke/MIB.

That being said, I can't overlook all the flaws. It doesn't mean I don't appreciate the show or that I won't ever re-watch my DVDs (I'm buying Season Six if that tells you anything) BUT for me, The End (of Lost) was horribly unsatisfying.

Some people say to those of us who didn't like it: you just didn't get it. The fact is, I did. I still found it disappointing and frustrating. There weren't just a few unanswered questions. There were dozens. Some of the answers were rushed (the Whispers for instance), some didn't make any sense, and some just weren't answered satisfactorily (if Walt was so ""special"" why did he become so ""dispensable"", why was Widmore so determined to get back to the Island? why, instead of exploring Claire's three years on the island were we introduced to characters like Zoe, Lennon, Dogen, whom we didn't care about?, how did Sayid end up with Shannon instead of Nadia? what was the origin of the statue? how did Jacob make all that money to finance his off-island travels/ventures? why did ""mother"" kill ""real mother""? what was so special about Aaron? one that I forgot the other day -- what on earth was the point of Ilana, the backstory of her being in the hospital at the beginning of Ab Aeterno? etc., etc., etc.)? And most pressing of all -- why do Lost admirer's hate having these questions asked? It's not disloyal. It's just realistic.

I did like the Sawyer/Juliet reunion scene at the end. I think it was the only one that really hit home for me. As for the rest, the scene with Vincent was great...

Overall - great series with a disappointing ending. I'll watch it again, but the thrill is gone.",1280448000,104,4594,4.688585607940446
4077518,5,B0036EH3X4,"Lost is without a doubt, my favorite TV drama ever. Most of what people complain about, particularly ""unexplained mysteries"", are actually indeed answered. Lost almost never hands you an answer with one or two lines of dialog. Instead, the writers choose to show you their answers by weaving it into the tapestry of the show's narrative.

From the beginning to the end, Lost is about the characters and their relationship to each other being told in a mythical setting, and this is where people loose perspective. I knew from the start that you weren't going to find out just HOW The Island came to be, and I kind of like it that way. It's the equivalent of asking where the sun in the sky comes from. It just exists. Lost comes close at times to religious explanations of its mysteries, and this is where viewers become uncomfortable and dismissive. Many who complain about the ending forget that this dynamic of faith vs reason has always existed between Jack and Locke. Its what makes them tick as characters, and why they are so interesting to watch.

To anyone interested in getting into Lost, I suggest to start at the beginning with season 1. Its not ot say that the entirety of the show doesn't loose its way from time to time, nor does it have an absolutely perfect track record with its plot.

My intentions of the review is not about the whether it satisfied the heart or the mind, but to question the inconsistency of could-have-been epic TV show.

JUST ONE BIG LOOPHOLE SPOILER to derive my review:

Season 5:
At the end of the season 5 ""Follow the Leader"", Richard says to the REBORN Locke that the only possible explanation for him to come from the dead was because of JACOB.

Season 6:
The so called BEST episode of the entire season - ""Ab Aeterno"", Jacob explicitly mentions to Richard he cannot bring anyone from the dead and ends up giving Richard the wish of being Immortal.

If you have a decent IQ, you will understand until otherwise if Richard is cursed with poor memory it doesn't make sense for him to not figure out the REBORN Locke is MIB/ Smokey, Jacob wouldn't been dead and hence the entire season 6 is Pure 100% Crap.

A magician is only as good as his tricks and showmanship. The tricks by the show-front-runners were more mysteries, and the showmanship in the form of very good actors (terry o quinn, michael emerson and many others) who can deliver the poorest of lines with their mind-blowing performance. Jack Bender one the main directors of Lost needs due credit for presenting the show in the best possible manner/package.

So depending on your IQ, it is upto you to fall for one six-yr heck of a magic.

I am NOT looking for the best plot but for some consistency from a show,
1. which had secured an end date three years back,
2. the writers said they had a plan from the BEGINNING. (ya right, just ask the polar bear)

My Review ends here.

NOW TO VENT OUT MY FRUSTRATION ON SOME KEY INCONSISTENCIES:

1. Desmond's false vision of Claire and Aron getting on the Chopper,
2. Charles widmore role unexplained to a point that his role was nothing other than crap,
3. lindelof and cuse said they explained the mythology regarding the number 4,8,15,16,23,42 partly in pre-series finale interview, was sheer crap. They could have left the mystery rather un-resolved.
4. All the ONE-LINERS to tie up the loose ends (The whispers, all the ghosts were MIB).
5. And finally, when Jacob's Island mother said don't ask any more questions regarding the Island to Jacob it was slap on my face for loving the show for the last six years.

By the way, if I were to guess, all the 5-star ratings is one of the many tricks by the show-front-runners.",1280188800,19,2583,4.56926406926407

  Just in case your the last person to know, your first guess - that's right, your very first, just minutes after you started watching way back when - was right. They are really dead and this isn't real. No, I'm not joking.

  Amazingly, there's no more sense to it than that. Sure there were great characters, dialogue and moments that made it up to this point the best show on TV. But, you can't say the faith that one day you would get the answers didn't help make it so. I mean, with all that was going on it couldn't be that they are dead because that would be too easy. Right? I know that is what we all thought. They are going to give us something for hanging around all this time. For waiting year after year as the knot got both larger and tighter. Sure that with one pull of one string it was all going to unravel in one masterful move. This had to make sense and not something easy and cheesey like its a dream or purgatory or they are dead. The show is too good for that. If it were that they were all dead, we said to ourselves, then we could essentially write anything and cheaply boost characters and dialogue with the tension of a place that hosts imortality, mysterious projects, strange inhabitants, magical numbers, ancient mysteries, convergence of fates, time and space travel, ghosts, monsters, and rituals that never need to be explained. They wouldn't do that to us. We have been too loyal. We are true believers in the show and defended it to all those of left it saying, they would regret it for not sticking with it as there would be an equally amazing and beautifully clear explanation that will do justice to these phenomenal characters that were presented. Just wait and see!

  Well, guess again. They are dead and there are no good answers.

  With that, the same characters might as well have been on a freaking mystical iceberg, magical swamp or forgotten subway station and it would not have made a difference! You see, a main character, the island, a place which time and time again we are told is central to it all, an active living player upon which all the characters, suspense and action was built upon and elevated...the one central character that despite who else was in the spotlight was continuously presented and thefore forced us to speculated on for six long years and for which we waited to have its own final flash forward/sideways/back (flash anything) was...was..was...? Roll credits.

  That is what you get. A post mortem family reunion but not with everyone. Some characters get resolution, but not all. Some answers are given but not the good ones. Oh, almost forgot. The baby makes it out alive.  Thanks for the bone, JJ.

  In all, it ends not like the show it started as, but like a cop out dressed up to appear as art and depth. Now there are those who liked the ending, but those are the same people that are facinated could also be facinated by a painting with single black dot in the center. Listen, it's empty and it sucks! Plain and simple.

4077534,4,B0036EH3X4,"When I was looking to purchase the LOST: Final Season DVD, I was shocked to see how divided the rating on this was. For anyone interested in giving the season a go, do yourself a favor and don't base your decision on 125 random people who can log in and type whatever crap they like. I'm not saying everyone who was disappointed in the show is typing crap. However, for anyone interested - keep in mind that the general vibe from critics and fans alike is that the show as a whole ended in a satisfying way. I'm not just saying that because I am a fan. If you do some research out there off of Amazon (metacritic as one example), you'll soon realize that Lost has a lot to offer. Of course, try to avoid spoilers if you are interested in giving this show a watch because you'll want to go in without answers like the rest of us.

Always start at season one. I think if you start there and anticipate from the beginning that not every mystery is going to be explained (though the majority are either answered explicitly or implicitly), you'll most liking be blown away like I was. If you are the kind of person who wants 20 minutes of exposition and explanation, you might want to look elsewhere. This is a personal thing and I don't blame anyone for not liking LOST if they want everything wrapped up in the end.

Another thing to consider when getting into Lost is that this show is very spiritual and philosophical, assuming a higher power is present in the lives of the survivors from season one. For many, the religious nature of the show was fine as long as it was kept in the background. When it became more prominent as the seasons progressed, some felt it was a cop-out. If you find shows that are religious to be a turn off, Lost isn't for you. However, it was a fresh take on something most people share. And it was done without becoming corny or absurd. At least in my opinion.

For me personally, Lost's final season was messy and rough around the edges for a couple of episodes. Acting was fantastic and reached new heights with Matthew Fox and Terry O'Quinn, but the plot had a hard time coming in for a landing. However, after ""Happily Ever After"" LOST delivered some of the best moments on TV. In the end it was always about ""live together, die alone"". About characters and relationships. About fathers and sons. It was about faith, religion, science, doubt, redemption, mystery, and above all: love. These aren't ordinary themes you deal with on TV. Other shows attempt to pretend to delved into huge topics, but I think LOST really took itself and the topics it addresses very seriously. It juggled some serious philosophical and metaphysical things, but never forced itself to be preachy or cheesy. I know I am just another opinion among others - and I still hold to my opening statement about not allowing a handful of people with a computer to tell you what to think about LOST - but I hold it up as one of the most amazing, emotional and mind-boggling experiences on television. The conclusion could not have been delivered better.",1279929600,8,3053,4.4972972972972975
4077535,5,B0036EH3X4,"Why is everyone complaining about the last episode of ""Lost""? Honestly, how did you think it would end? A weird, innovative and complex series like ""Lost"" obviously needed a weird, innovative and complex last episode!

Personally, I got it. The alternative timeline was in the future, when all the characters had died and their souls gathered in a waiting room to Heaven. I suppose Christian Shepherd's name and empty coffin was an allusion to the resurrection of you-know-who. The other episodes of the last season answered other pressing questions: Where did Jacob and the Man in Black come from? How did Richard get to the island? Not a bad finale, all things considered.

The main problem with ""Lost"" is that, frankly, the people behind it came dangerously close to loosing it. For starters, the series was too long. The same story could easily have been told in just four seasons. Or even less. After a while, the story became unwieldy in the extreme, with all the subplots and supplementary characters, many of whom were of little interest. Frankly, who cares about Charlotte? The constant jumps back and forth in time became involuntary comic relief after about the dozenth jump. Obviously, it became impossible to answer all the questions raised by these complexities. But then, this was obvious to discerning viewers already three years ago... My favourite meaningless question never answered was: Why did Mr. Eko build a church? And why did good ol' Smokie kill him?

Well, who knows? ;-)

So why did I keep watching ""Lost"", despite knowing that all the loose ends would never be tied up? I think it was the splendid actors and the intriguing characters with their weird life stories. In fact, the flashbacks were often more interesting than the actual story of the island! Who can forget John Locke being conned by his own father, the long cons of Sawyer, the ugly, crazy and lovable Hugo Reyes, or the beautiful and homicidal Kate? Then there's Lapidus, the pilot who looks like a guy from a Burt Reynolds movie, fished out of the water just at the right time for the grand finale. Is that a continuity error?

Despite not answering EVERYTHING, I do believe ""Lost"" somehow found itself in this last season.

All in all, not a bad show.

Now, I'm off to see Jacob, LOL.",1279843200,8,2280,4.801020408163265

4077537,2,B0036EH3X4,"Forget it! The only way this show worked was by stringing it out over such a long period of time that you forget almost 75% of the things you hear over the seasons.

This show had so much magic, character development, mystery, and epic battles that it was such a shame to end it the way it did.

If you watch this show from beginning to end you will feel very let down by the ending. Not to say it isn't a good ending, but it's an ending of a SEASON not of a SERIES. This show left absolutely way too much unanswered.

In the middle of Season 6 I ordered this set. After the show ended, I canceled my order. Why rewatch the entire show only to know it ends without answering all the things you wanted to know about?",1279670400,13,715,4.056737588652482

Without spoiling anything, I highly recommend this product.  The journey ends at a high point for this show, and while it definitely leaves plenty up to interpretation, it is a very well-acted and written show.

4077549,2,B0036EH3X4,"If there has ever been a creative & innovative show, this is it, from the first episode in Season 1, you are immediately hooked in, the first five seasons were pretty consistent with one another, a bit confusing at times, but easy to follow, this final season is just the opposite, not only is it inconsistent with its previous seasons, it is really hard to follow big time, there are so many things wrong with this season, I don't know where to begin, most reviewers on here have already pointed out this season's major flaws, things wrong with this one are below.....possible spoilers...

The first episode of the season does start off with a sense of promise, starting where the fifth season ended..... Juliett manages to detonate the nuke in 1977.... which should have prevented the plane from crashing in 2004.... right....wrong....
the episode does give us a glimpse of what might have happened if the plane hadn't crashed.... a new reality is formed & we see the characters all going about their normal lives as the plane lands at LAX, this did seem like a neat premise... but it soon gets a bit ridiculous.... like the writers just didn't know where to go with it

then, to top it all off, we learn that the nuke sent our survivors back to 2007....how?? & now we have two realities going on at once.....make sense??...

In the alternate never crashed timeline (flash sideways), we see charaters from previous episodes pop up, but there are inconsistencies....like..

Sun & Jin are not married in the flash sideways..(how?)

Jack, our main hero suddenly has a son who was never mentioned in the first five seasons, too add insult to injury, his ex-wife is not even the kid's mother, Juliett is.....how is this possible??

Sawyer.... the show's bad boy....who we learned was con man, but now a undercover police officer with Miles, one of the rescue people in Season 4 as his partner... how is this possible?....

Ben...the show's villian & the main antagonist throughout we learned killed his own dad on the island in season 3 in a flashback moment, but somehow, his dad is a old man here...how?..not only that, they try to make us like him....

Desmond would have been on the island in this flash sideways in the Hatch no less, but yet, somehow he too is on the plane...again...how is this possible??....now one could argue that he was never there because of the nuke, that is possible, but how likely is it he would have been on the plane..not likely...

Hurley is a CEO of the resturaunt that he worked at before hitting the lottery in the flashbacks of his character.... again....how?...

Locke is still engaged to his girlfriend who had left him in a previous flashback episode from season 3....but somehow that never happened...also his reason for being handicapped is also different....I won't even try to explain it..

Only Kate, Claire, Sayid, & Charlie seem to have a consistent flow in this flash sideways...

With Claire still pregnant with her unborn child
Kate still on the run from the law
Sayid being reunited with his long lost love

another thing this season tried to do was explain the Smoke Monster's origin, we learn that it is the MIB (Man in Black) who has an ongoing fued with Jacob(the Island's protector)....almost like Jesus & Satan....with the MIB wanting to leave the island & Jacob refusing to let him leave....but get this.... they are brothers....o.k....but we never find out why the MIB wants to leave...

Early on we are introduced to a group of people in a Pyramid type building who are keeping Smokey out, but we never learn why....let alone where they came from...

There is only one really good episode..the name eludes at the moment, where we learn about Richard & why he never ages, we also learn in this episode how the ship came to be stuck in the jungle, this s why I give it two stars.

This Season is so inconsistent with the other previous seasons that the writers had to be on crack......it is as if creator J.J. Abrams & others here just handed it to Damon Lindelof & Carlton Cuse & said... ""here, it is yours to finish""
& these idiots couldn't come up with a reasonable ending....

Like some reviewers have said....it could have ended with Season 5 with them resetting time, that would have been believeable.... & as far as I am concerned....that is where it ended... I will not be getting this one...& I won't even get started on the last episode which was supposed to justify all the inconsistencies that for the most part was a cop out like others have said, I won't even go there.....other reviewers have already done that for me....stick with the first five seasons.....skip this one.",1279584000,15,4645,4.707768187422935

With the way the storyline turns out in the last one to two seasons, I was almost embarassed to be a fan.

There are many answers if you research things more so I suggest that to those that don't understand or whatever? Season Six Rules!!!

4077552,1,B0036EH3X4,"People, this is not difficult. For five-plus incredible seasons LOST was plot driven, not character driven (that is not to say there wasn't any character development; LOST had probably the best character development of any television show I have ever seen). The story arc was a fantastic blend of adventure, mystery, science fiction, and the supernatural. All of the key plot points and devices drove the ultimate resolution of the story the writers had devised for our entertainment. Then along came the final episodes of Season 6...

It beggars belief that Amazon and the web are awash with supercilious reviews scoffing at the notion that the writers had a duty to provide their audience with ""answers"" and intellectualizing about how poignant and fitting and beautiful the ending was and how those who disagree ""don't get it."" Such sentiments could only come from those who didn't watch every episode from the pilot onward and simply don't understand the concept of the story arc in episodic storytelling. Those of us who did, and do, could never accept the axiom that it is the audience's responsibility to ""interpret"" the outcome.

I thoroughly enjoyed the journey of LOST, but ultimately, the destination had to make sense within the story arc developed over the preceeding five seasons. That the writers/producers instead gave us a hackneyed ending more befitting of some Hallmark Channel melodrama revealed a contempt for their creation and audience far more baffling than any mystery on the island.",1279152000,36,1508,5.151020408163265
4077553,5,B0036EH3X4,one of the best shows ever. as a whole LOST will go down in history as one of the greatest TV achievments of all time.,1279065600,6,118,3.76
4077554,5,B0036EH3X4,"I first wrote a review for season 6 of Lost right after it came out on TV.  The review was titled ""A Literary Work of Art"".  Looking back after many months, I see that I embellished many parts of the season in that review, so now I'm giving it another try.

Looking back on all six seasons of Lost, some of my favorite memories come from season 6. Ab Aeterno, a Richard episode in the sixth season, is one of the most unique Lost episodes ever, using cinematic elements to tell a dramatic love story from Richard's past. My favorite acting performance in all of Lost comes in the seventh episode of season 6, Dr. Linus, as Ben (Michael Emerson) gives his reason for killing Jacob. One of the death scenes in season six made me cry (though I won't spoil it for you). In short, the writers didn't get too lazy on season 6. They can still create incredibly dramatic, memorable moments.

Perhaps my favorite element of season 6 is the juxtaposition between the ""flash sideways"" and the current timeline on the island. Even if you don't like what the ""flash sideways"" turn out to be (which I don't), I can't imagine that you could dislike all the perfect moments that come from these flashes. As life on the island is going horribly wrong, the flashes will show that life in the sideways reality is nearly perfect. Locke and Jack shake hands. Charles Widmore serves Desmond 60 year old MacCutcheon Whiskey, a whiskey he refused to serve Desmond in season 3. So many references to seasons past are made in the sideways timeline, making the sixth season an incredible walk down memory lane while wrapping up the series at the same time.

Of course, everyone's biggest complaint about season 6 is that it failed to answer the questions they've had for all the other seasons; that it didn't actually wrap up the series.  I don't think that's completely true.  However, it's also not true that all or even most of viewers' questions were fully answered.  The vast majority of questions were partially answered.  After all six seasons, what is the island?  Well, we know it's ""a place where miracles happen"" and apparently it's keeping evil at bay somehow.  Does that really do justice to the viewers who have watched the show all six years?  I think so.

Most die hard viewers will tell you that for five years they enjoyed making predictions and putting together theories about the questions that were brought up on the island.  They grabbed a clue from here or there and put together a theory to answer their question.  Then they waited for the sixth season to confirm or deny their theory.  And that confirmation never came.  They were left with a theory that may or may not be true.  One of my favorite short stories is ""The Lady or the Tiger"".  At the end of the story, a woman is left with a choice: will she make the love of her life be mauled to death by a tiger before her eyes, or will she have him marry another beautiful lady.  Then the story ends.  It never tells what the woman's choice was.  I feel like this is what Lost did (though I'm not sure that was the writers' intention).  It left viewers with questions that they would have to answer for themselves, and for the most part, it leaves room for the viewer to find those answers.  You just have to be willing to look.",1278979200,,3278,4.4983108108108105
4077555,5,B0036EH3X4,"I know a lot of people are saying that we didn't get answers in the final season...WHAT SHOW WERE THEY WATCHING? Watch the season again the only things they didn't answer were a couple of little things. I also know that a lot of people said they never explained what the island was...THEY DID..watch Ab Aeterno and Beyond the Sea,they give you two explanations a complex one and a simplistic one. Now that you've read this search Amazon.com for Lost you'll find the lost encyclopedia which will have your definant answers...Now that you've read this aren't you happy they went with a closure to all of the characters instead of answering all the little questions?",1278892800,10,663,4.773913043478261
4077556,5,B0036EH3X4,"Of course, once you get to the end of this compelling series, you realize that (ever since Juliet set off the bomb) the entire gang was gone. But the suspense and mystery is maintained until the very last moment. Still, at heart, this is almost a 'Dallas'-type, 'entire thing was a dream' sort of thing.

Simple -- and true -- as that may be, it does not do justice to what is surely one of the most elaborate, incredibly well-thought-out plots, and beautifully constructed finales ever made for a popular, long-running television series.  The acting is first rate.  The sets are atmospheric.  The photography is beautiful.  The music underscores and highlights the emotions portrayed.

John Locke is fearsome as the personification of evil.  Ben is his usual self-serving, amoral, and hateful self.  Thank god the utterly obnoxious Michael appears only briefly in the final season.  But even these characters become bathed in the benevolent light that pervades the entire season.

Most admirable of all, the writers and actors have managed to walk the fine line of sentiment, in the most heart-wrenching scenes (and there are many), without ever crossing over into sentimentality.

The final season is a fitting, and elevated, tribute to one of the greatest series ever produced on American television.  A real communion.",1278806400,4,1322,5.097674418604651
4077557,5,B0036EH3X4,"Okay, so LOST is not perfect. It had some inconsistencies and faults throughout its six year run, but it's almost inevitable when you're trying to tell a story this large. Because of the grandiose story that unfolds in this show, I can easily see past the minor mistakes the show made. LOST was so wildly ambitious and unique that it's hard not to love. I know many people would disagree with me, many were disappointed by the lack of answers given to the many mysteries presented throughout the show, but I think most of these people were watching for the wrong reasons. If your only interest in the show is seeing the mysteries cleared up, just stop watching. Yes, the island and its strange happenings played a big part in the show, but just like our survivors, we never are able to find out EVERYTHING. But that's perfectly fine with me because the island possesses magical properties and things happen not always with reason.

This season may not have been perfect, it had some issues in the first half of the season. But by the time we reach the halfway mark, particularly an episode called ""Ab Aeterno"", the show picks up and doesn't let us catch our breath until the amazing final moments of the series.

Ever since the finale aired on TV, LOST has been glued in the mind and I think back on the whole experience very fondly. This was truly a magical, one-of-a-kind show that will never be reproduced or equaled in terms of scope, originality, and gripping storytelling. If you go into it with an open mind, not expecting every little mystery to be solved and a suspension of disbelief, this final chapter will draw you in and blow your mind.",1278720000,5,1650,4.589830508474576
4077558,2,B0036EH3X4,"If you're a fan, and someone who never watched this series asked you ""What is the island?"", after watching 6 seasons, would you have an answer?

LOST is a well-written, well-acted series with some great moments, but the reason for initially being drawn into the show is this central question. If you're expecting some explanation based in reality, you will be disappointed with LOST.

Watch the DVDs and enjoy, but skip the final season and make up your own ending. Stick to your own theories and speculation about the island. They are what made this show fun to watch in the first place.

What is the island? It's not what you're thinking. Unfortunately.",1278720000,24,655,4.778761061946903
4077559,5,B0036EH3X4,"I can't believe LOST is over--what a journey. In my opinion, Season 6 has been the best season yet! Not to offend but I think a lot of the people who ""hated"" the ending didn't truly understand it. I know that many questions were unanswered but I think we all saw that coming and I think it was amazing that even up to the last ten minutes the writers still had us all guessing! I am totally impressed with it and could not have asked for a more perfect ending!",1278374400,8,460,4.122222222222222
4077560,5,B0036EH3X4,"The last season, as well as the ending itself, resonated not only with other themes, symbols, and motifs within the show itself, but with major literary and religious works.  The show was, from the beginning, made to entertain and instruct people with a little bit of education about the serious struggles of life itself.  If you don't have that education, or at least some experience reading canonical books with depth (literary, scientific, philosophical, religious), you will only see the show as a mish-mash and think there was nothing there to see simply because you have no eyes to see them.  You may even think that those who defend the show don't see anything either, and only defend it out of some fan-boyish tendency the way other lesser shows are defended.

This is just not the case.  The quality of ""Lost"" overall, as well as the last season, can be easily defended on literary grounds, most heavily relying on a mythological context.  Some large portion of today's audience, however, needs ""answers"" distilled down to some catchphrase, or something so simple that it makes the journey of the story pointless--and the journey cannot be pointless (""meaningless"" in the Adversary's final words; the journey is not only theirs in the story, but our wider journey as humans in life).  Clearly some think the answers given made the story pointless, but those were the only kind of answers we could have gotten given the scope of the questions.  What are the numbers? The Valenzetti equation.  But what are the numbers?  Uh, they correspond to our losties who are candidates.  But WHAT are the numbers?  A sign of Jacob's influence on the world akin to the way other constants, such as pi, are found throughout nature in many different contexts.  But WHAT are the numbers?  A symbol of our interconnectedness as human beings, how our experiences overlap and are often very similar thematically and emotionally which tells us ""we're in this together"".  But WHAT are the numbers?  Then they say, ""See? You didn't answer the question.""  They want an answer that isn't possible for the writers to write, an answer that literally cannot exist hypothetically (in an imaginary world) or in reality, an answer that is so simple a child would say ""ah-ha"" and wander away to play outside.  There literally could be no bottom line, drop-dead answer (imaginary or real) to ""what are the numbers"" that would make the story better.  It simply would have turned the entire show into a math problem, the point of which was to solve for X, and once you do that you can move on and never think of the show again.  The show was better than that.  The show was about life, and life isn't a math problem to solve for X, although it is often a mystery in a variety of ways.  The story was a story the way a great book is a story, the way the great myths of the world are stories, NOT the way a television show is a ""story"" (if we can call something like CSI a story).  But as such, many people watching television would have never opened the ""book of Lost"", had it been a book, not just for the reasons they complain about the series.  They never would have gotten past the first few pages before becoming bored and wandering away.  But at least they were exposed to something greater, something better, than everything else on television.

If you didn't like ""Lost"" or its final season, fine.  But at least turn off the tv and take a hike to the local library and read some of the books referenced in the show, books that contain ideas that influence every aspect of your life even as you are unaware of it.  Since ""Lost"" is over, there is nothing else worth watching on television, and the history of human thought awaits your discovery.  Perhaps start with some of the island books just to get your feet wet: Lord of the Flies, Mysterious Island, The Island of Dr. Moreau, Swiss Family Robinson, Robinson Crusoe, even Shakespeare's The Tempest, among dozens and dozens of others.

If you've never seen Lost, and you are moderately educated, and you don't often watch television...give disc one of season one a spin.  All you need to know about what the show is and isn't, is on that disc.  Namaste.  And good luck.",1278115200,9,4202,4.665760869565218

4077564,1,B0036EH3X4,"Writers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse have a gift - they have a talent for creating highly-intriguing mysteries and compelling characters. The problem? The ability to generate compelling storylines is their ONLY gift - they lack the talent to resolve them in a coherent or satisfactory manner, making them poor/mediocre writers as opposed to excellent ones. The promos for season 6 promised that ""The answers are coming"". Unfortunately ABC and Darlton weren't on the same page, seeing as there were no answers. So what did the writers do? Backtrack and backpedal: ""Actually, the show was always about the characters"". Right. Most of the characters, who at one time had been complex and compelling, had sadly been reduced to two-dimensional stick-figures, cardboard cutouts of their former selves by the end of the show. The beautifully-filmed, yet heavy-handed and emotionally-manipulative season finale seems to have redeemed the series' weakest season in the eyes of many, as was intended - by appealing to the hearts of the audience, the writers hoped to silence the head and blind the viewers to the many glaring plotholes and loose-ends present in their story.

4077565,4,B0036EH3X4,"this season was divided into 2 stories, the island and the people on it, and another story called the alternate universe by most, which had the same actors in similar roles but they never crashed on the island.  This 2nd storyline led to much thought, with everyone watching trying to figure out how it fit into the big picture.

The Island story was excellent, slow in a few spots but revealing more than ever before about the mysteries of the island.  And it leads into an exciting conclusion which i won't spoil here.

The alternate story however turned out to be a total waste of investment into it, as it proved to be an unreal story of island souls wasting time until jack joined them.  If this alternate story had taken place JUST in the finale 2 1/2 hour finale, it might have been a superb conclusion to the series.  BUT because the previous episodes nearly all split the time with the alternate universe and that universe turned out to be a fantasy with no basis in the rest of the series, and it didn't even make sense with the final episode, about 1/2 the season was wasted when it could have been all about the island with many more secrets revealed and a bigger storyline could have been used.  Instead we got stories with Jin in a freezer, his wife getting shot in the stomach, Jack having a son who didn't exist, Locke becoming a teacher with Ben, and none of it meant anything in the end.  A case can be made for the (alternate) end having meaning but everything 'alternate' prior to the finale ultimately meant nothing and became irrelevant when the finale was shown.

An intriguing story became worthless and a lot of time was wasted watching it.  They should have condensed the 'alternate's' into just the finale and left the island story by itself.

If you watch it it can still be worth watching.  Just forward past the alternate stories as you go along, hold off watching the 'ab aeterno' episode AFTER the episode featuring Jacob and his brother and their adopted mother for better continuity, followed by the remaining episodes, and then watch all the alternate stories before watching the finale.  It should flow a lot better that way!",1277683200,6,2161,4.596354166666667
4077576,2,B0036EH3X4,"MAGIC!!!! Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!

Seriously, though. That's pretty much the solution they gave us after 6 years, as if we couldn't figure out the Island was magical after Locke starts walking in the first season. During the course of the show we see the Island has healing powers, time travel powers, and can grant eternal life, and then in the 6th season the writers revealed the source of the Island's powers was a magic glowing light, as if everyone was just going to go ""OOOHHHHHHHH, So THAT'S what it was! The Island was MAGIC!"" and suddenly feel completely satisfied. I did give the final season two starts because, despite the lack of closure on the Island, they did give complete closure on the characters, and after watching the series for 6 seasons you do become invested in their outcome, but not so much that any rational person would actually get on Amazon and post a review that says ""You know what? They gave us complete closure on the characters, and in the end, isn't that what we all really wanted to know anyway?"" NO! Obviously it was not. If that were the case, everyone would have been praising the ending instead of panning it. To be perfectly honest, the decision to focus on the characters in the last season and reveal almost nothing new about the Island was a completely arrogant move on the writers' part. As if they thought they were such AMAZING writers, that they could deliver us one fantastic finale that sums up what happens to Jack so well, we wouldn't even care what the story was with that Island, because we would be so floored with how great they are at writing, we wouldn't even notice they didn't conclude the REAL plot line that made us all start watching in the first place.

No Way!!! Awesome! Why did I start watching this show again?""

I have heard some theories that claim the writer's actually do have a well thought out explanation for what the Island really is, besides Magic, but for one excellent reason or another they couldn't squeeze it into the finale. If that's true I'll consider changing my rating, but until then, they get TWO stars. Bummer.",1277596800,18,2297,4.641277641277641

2nd - this product is not released yet, so this is not a review of the quality of the dvd or blu-ray picture, 5.1 sound, cover art, special features or anything else about the DVD or Blu-ray release that you can buy here on Amazon.

3rd - this review is of Season 6 and it's relationship to Seasons 1-5.  And, whether or not is it worth spending your money on purchasing it and watching it.

The good:

A masterpiece of character development.  It provides a final conclusion to the interpersonal relationships between a number of the main characters and resolves the main plot love triangle, the sometimes passionate, volatile, and adversarial love affair, between Jack, Kate, and Sawyer.  No, Jack and Sawyer don't turn out to be homosexual lovers with Kate watching from the nearest closet.  It also finishes up and provides closure to the love relationships between the few characters that have been featured over the previous 5 years.  Again, nothing controversial.

Great acting and cinematography.  Again, the actors and actresses did a fabulous job.  Especially the actors that played Ben and John Locke.  The camera work and choice of tropical settings are superb.

The characters resolving their emotional problems.  The alternate timeline allows the viewers to see the main characters in lives without the influence of Jacob and the Island.  They have a better, although not great, emotional state of mind and perspective on life.  They are shown without the severe emotional baggage that they carried the first 5 seasons.

The spiritual ending.  The way the series ends is sad and happy at the same time.  Great work to evoke both emotions.  The characters are presented as having resolved the major psychological issues and worked out most of their interpersonal issues with the other characters in the series and collectively are able to move on to the Hereafter.

The smoke monster and jacob are explained.  Not opposites, or ying and yang, God and Satan, or good and evil, but are revealed as humans with human issues, idiosyncrasies, and issues.

Richard's past and his relationship with Jacob is explained.

The Numbers are explained (partially).  It turns out that the 6 magical Numbers are just a subset of 108 numbers which represent the 108 candidates that Jacob has been pursuing for many years looking for the perfect replacement for himself.  Nothing more mysterious than that.

For those viewers who enjoyed the Religious connections to the Old Testament and other Religious works in seasons 1-5, the final church scene is very satisfying both emotionally and spiritually.  It will support and reinforce your belief that life after death is possible.

The Bad:

The majority of the mysteries from Seasons 1-5 are not revealed as committed they would be  by the producers.  The series continually introduced new and interesting events and circumstances throughout the first 5 seasons and into the 6th and very few were addressed in season 6 other than those in the Good section above.  Hundreds of examples from Walt to Dharma to Numbers to Claire to the three toed statue to time travel to pendalum to Eloise to Lighthouse to Widmore and many many other examples of the mysteries introduced during the years of Lost.  Almost all were left up to each individual having to make their own assumptions about what it all meant and if they were relevant or irrelevant.

Richard, the mysterious character that was in most episodes of Lost, is revealed to be just a follower with no real insight into what has been happening on the Island and turns out to be irrelevant in the big picture.

The Island itself, Lost's Main Character, was revealed to be nothing more than essentially a magical floating toilet bowl filled with golden liquid that if flushed into the Pacific Ocean the world would be destroyed.  After many years of weaving this main character into the fabric of Lost and then have such an inane conclusion as to what it was, is a serious flaw.

In general, very poor writing and wandering plot gave season 6 the worst feel of the entire series and for the entire season there were only 3 or 4 really good episodes that were tightly written and didn't feel like the season was just being extended to fill up time.

The Alternate Timeline didn't really provide much to Lost except to provide the Love Boat background for a few of the characters to kiss and come together and provide the church for the final religious scene.  Other than that, it was a waste of time.

The Ugly:

The ending is very simplistic and clich.  It turns out to be nothing more than the classic and typical religious experience of Seeing the Light and moving into the Hereafter all played out in a Church.  Nothing imagintive or innovative.

The ending revealed the entire series was mainly an excursion into the Bibical Old Testament stories, updated to the modern world for the sake of protraying good vs evil in the context of human frailities.

The ending provided no logical conclusion to the ingenious Plot that was the mainstay of Lost.  The conclusion left the viewer with only one way to appreciate the complete series;  to treat the more than 100 characters that were killed and murdered during the series as irrelevant, to treat the mysterious and numerous events as improbable and irrelevant and focus only on the remaining few characters as the only reason and purpose for the entire 6 years.  Thus, the rationale Lost was always just a story about the characters.

With the final episode, it is now obvious that the creaters of Lost did it as a religious personal opinion piece.  It was done to show viewers that there a Hereafter exists and that if one loves correctly and redeems themselves they have an opportunity for an Afterlife.

For those viewers who believed Lost was intelligent, logical and though provoking, Season 6 is the anthitsis of what was expected from what they had believed was a sophisticed and intellectually complex series.

Conclusion:

Unfortunately, even though Season 6 had some good elements, the bad and ugly far outweigh the experience.  Not only does Season 6 on it's own turn out to be the weakest and worst of all six seasons, the conclusion invalidated and corrupted the previous 5 seasons.

Recommendation:

If you enjoyed the Religious context of Lost and believe that the show is really a story about the Characters that get to the end, then buy Season 6.  Watch it and join in the emotional and spiritual final scene.  But, be aware you are likely to shed a tear or two so keep the hankies handy.

However, if you believed that Lost was an intellectually complex story with significant thought provoking elements,  Do not bother purchasing or viewing Season 6.  Buy and watch Seasons 1-5 watch and re-watch over an over again and pretend that the show was cancelled after Season 5.  Especially since season 6 left the majority of the entire Lost plot and events of the first 5 seasons up to your own interpretation anyway, your entire Lost experience shouldn't have to burdened with inept Season 6.",1277596800,49,7154,4.8353909465020575
4077578,1,B0036EH3X4,"It's all about the characters! It's not about answering any of the questions that were teasingly introduced for 5 years. It's all about, you know, who winds up shagging who, just like every other vapid soap opera on tv. I mean come on people, do you REALLY care what the island was supposed to be in the end? Isn't the intellectual thrill ride that is the Jack/Kate/Sawyer/Juliet relationship roller coaster far better to have all the answers to? And I know I know, the flash sideways had nothing, absolutely nothing to do with anything that happened in the first 5 seasons of LOST, nor did they have anything to do with anything that happened on the island or to the characters while they were alive, but aren't you glad to finally, at the end of this 6 season saga, find out what they were really all about?

Season 6 is a classic example of the bait and switch, or of, wait for it... The Long Con! You know, the title of one of the earlier episodes! See!? They DID know where they were going with this show all along!

Could this have possibly ended more poorly? I won't even get into inconsistencies, red-herrings, omissions, and mistakes----I think that the 'brain trust' who led me astray with the futile hope that some creativity could be salvaged from Network media should simply be ignored in all future endeavors. I feel cheated AND evangelized. I do feel sorry for the actors---this piece of crap probably ruined some careers.",1277424000,25,762,5.297520661157025
4077580,1,B0036EH3X4,"Listen, I've been a LOST nut from the airing of the pilot episode.  I wasn't even that hacked at the series finale - although I do contend that you could tack on the 'going into the light' nonsense onto any ensemble show with similar results.  But the sixth season is really a mess and doesn't come anywhere near the quality of the seasons before it.  From the meandering episodes at the temple (where more unresolved mysteries are introduced needlessly) to the muddled origin story of Jacob and the MIB, this season reeks of lazy writing (or is it tired of writing?).

In some ways, I like to think that LOST should have ended with season 5.  Nothing would have been resolved and we would have, ala Twin Peaks, a show with questions that would never be answered but at least the viewers would know that the creators didn't WILLFULLY chose to leave them hanging.  As it stands, season 6 answered nothing and added nothing to the preceding five seasons and that is why it ultimately taints the series as a whole.  I think I'll pull a Jack and erase the last season from existence.

(Also, I hear they have created a 15 minute short for this DVD that is supposed to answer questions.  I've heard rumors that the writers left everything unanswered so ABC could have a STAR WARS-like cash-cow for 'expanded LOST universe' books and so on.  To anyone who defends this, I would ask them to remember that The Stand didn't need a bunch of short stories to resolve its narrative.)",1277424000,49,1471,4.55893536121673
4077581,3,B0036EH3X4,"My review won't break down the story bit by bit because if you made it this far and don't watch season 6, then I don't think I can help.

The reviews here are all over the place and people love it or hate it.  Why?

Because we, as a species, are lost.  The entire show is a metaphor for life itself.  It's not going to answer questions about life and death, good and evil, love and hate because as in life, so is it in the imagination and the show.

I'm going to buy this when it arrives and watch all of them back to back over the shortest possible period that I can.  I'm sure to wonder why this or that happened the way it did, or wonder why this person was left out of the ending; however, it's fine by me. EDIT: Mostly fine.  I took away a star from my review after some discussion within.  While I'll still certainly buy the season and watch it again, I'm still open to removing more stars.

If you are willing to sit back and enjoy a thought provoking series and happen to be here reading this review after dropping the series for some reason, I offer this:  Buy the rest and invest the time with an open mind.  Let it spur your own thoughts about life and what it has to offer before and after it ends.

4077582,1,B0036EH3X4,"I did enjoy the final episode, I'll say that, up until the last 20 minutes where they basically said, ""your last year of investing was completely meaningless."" It's completely frustrating to me, someone who doesn't believe in an afterlife, to have invested so much into this series to have the writer's beliefs shoved in my face. Sure, they shot the ending in a church with all the different religious symbols on the stained glass wall, but I'm not religious. I wanted to know about the science of the island and they basically said, ""this island is too mysterious to understand."" No! That's bad writing! In the end of season 5 they alluded to the bomb blowing up the EMP well in the island as a connection to the flash-sideways events, but in the end we find out that the flash-sideways events have nothing to do with the bomb, making them completely meaningless. I loved the final episode, with the battle for good and evil, it was awesome... but I'm just embarrassed that the writers spent most of the final season on showing off their thoughts of an afterlife. It's just plain stupid. If I wanted to see religious propaganda I'd watch 'Touched by an Angel'. They masked this series as a cool, scientific, edgy, mystery and what I got was a miserable, emotional ending with no closure.

It's like that old cliche: the character wakes up and it was all a dream. This was worse than that.",1277337600,35,1389,4.623481781376518
4077583,5,B0036EH3X4,"After my few years of LOST watching I have learned not to include spoilers when talking or writing about the show. Peeps should can the spoilers, and if you have not yet viewed the season AVOID them like you would an evil infection.

Try not to be swayed by the haters. I will not defend against them, I will only say that season six was without a doubt the most complicated season to grasp as a whole and since that is the case, in the end split the fan base into several directions.

Season six deals heavily in the islands mythology. Where season five dealt heavily in time travel and the history of Dharma, six almost releases itself from the grip of time all together. The Jacob/Man In Black theme is expanded and very hard to understand.  ACROSS THE SEA is the culminating point of the island mythology, where a major question was promised to be addressed. Well it was, but the answer that was given shattered the fan base into more pieces then a certain light house mirror that I won't get into specifics about.

Lets just say that I believe about 99 point 9 percent of the viewers totally missed the point of Across the Sea. I thought that episode was completely bad ass. Since even the peeps who watched the episode fifty times still think my theory is wrong ands I don't want to include spoilers, You can check out what I really think at Lostblog.net.

The production was not as lush as previous seasons in a lot of episodes, (except AB AETERNO, a brilliant Richard centric ep. which shows that Lost could easily remain on air as various movies of the week) and the pacing is way different, but it didn't stop me from watching and rewatching episodes over and over. This is the greatest show of all time, and I loved six as much as others. You should just try and enjoy the ride on the first go through, then assemble the puzzle after. Just remember, where season six may contain fifty puzzle pieces, most peeps just grabbed up three at the end, looked at them for three seconds and then declared that it didn't make any sense. The final episode, while great, isn't the culmination of the mythology presented in the series. And the answer will not smack you in the face as soon as it wraps. It is more likely to wake you up out of a dead sleep several weeks later in a sweat... I get it! Watch and enjoy. That is all.",1277337600,5,2327,4.389791183294664

At least it was nice that at the end of the show they were all together and at peace. I loved & enjoyed watching this every week!!!!

In the years to come, I will encourage those looking for puzzles, depth, mystery and intellectual stimulation to stop watching at the conclusion of season 5.  Why?  Because season 6 will just waste your time with pointless running around and emotional nonsense.

""Life is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.""  Shakespeare

And that's what the finale and entire 6th season did for me... nothing.  Just a handful of episodes into this last season, I could tell that I was in for disappointment.  Answers didn't come, just more questions.  Everything felt ""off"" somehow.  The island has a magically gooey golden center?  That's not an answer!  That's just... ridiculous, not to mention internally inconsistent with the Lost mythology which had been slowly building since the original episode.

Just thinking about the Lost series as a whole makes me feel angry.  Oh well, at least this review gave me some much needed closure if nothing else.

4077596,1,B0036EH3X4,"When I first started to watch Lost, I was thrilled to have found such a fresh, interesting new series.
6 years later and it feels so pointless having started to watch this show in the first place.
If I had known what I know now, I never would started to watch it.

I'm always surprised how easily people accept one-line answers as the conclusion of secrets on this show. Maybe people love making theories so much that they don't care if most of the revealations on this show are not worth the wait but I think the creators of Lost were making a fuzz about nothing.
This is one of the most pointless shows I've ever watched. Most writers think about 'WHY DO I TELL A STORY' but that thought never seemed to have crossed the mind of the Lost writers. Season 6 is definitely the worst season of the entire show, there is the brilliant 'Ab Aeterno' episode but the rest is lost in a crossover between 'FernGully' meets 'Cast Away'. Lost took pride in being different, being an intelligent drama but in the last season they took the easy way out and decided to become a Disney fairytale.

Either the producers realized too late that 6 seasons really wasn't enough for them to tell their story, or it was a giant bait and switch from the beginning. Either way I am hugely disappointed.",1277251200,32,470,4.674698795180723

4077599,1,B0036EH3X4,"The final season of Lost wasn't just a letdown in its own right (although it was). It also betrayed the narrative of the much-beloved five seasons which preceded it. The problem is not just the lack of answers to the Island's mysteries -- although that lack of answers rankled -- but the fact that almost none of the events of the show prior to the last four episodes had any meaning or impact. For instance, the destruction of the hatch in the Season 2 finale never had any ramifications or explanations or consequences. Similarly, the explosion of the nuke in Season 5 ultimately proved to have no impact on the conclusion (despite an overlong and narratively unfair tease). Desmond's flashes -- built up throughout and made to look significant toward the end -- also completely failed to impact the actual conclusion of the show. In short, the ""man behind the curtain"" was revealed in the closing hours of Lost, and his secret was that the show had not actual plot at all. It was just a series of random events in which actions and character choices never had any consequences.",1277164800,43,1080,4.689473684210526
4077600,2,B0036EH3X4,"*Minor spoilers*

Storytelling-wise, this was the weakest season of all. Some of the previous seasons may have started slow (like Season 3) but the story always picks up toward the end. What we have for season 6 is a choppy, uneven narrative with too many characters, major and minor, fighting for screen time. At times, the pace is too chaotic; key events feel rushed and certain subplots are hastily concluded. Other times, the action stalls; all we see is one group of people going from point A to point B while another group is going from point C to point D. The problem of the pacing can be attributed to the fact that too much time was spent on two plot elements: (1) The Sideways Universe (2)Explaining the Jacob v MIB conflict.

I admit some stories in the sideways universe were interesting. And the sideways universe was necessary for the setup of the happy reunion scene in the finale. However, a substantial amount of time had to be devoted to a universe that essentially was not real. The inclusion of the sideways/afterlife universe disrupted the pacing of the story in the real timeline. This was not a problem with the flashbacks and flashforwards in previous seasons since the viewers could see the connection between the flashes and the present timeline. But we were not aware of the the connection between the two timelines for season 6 until the very end, so for most of the season, it felt like two separate stories were being told in every episode. Sure the reunion scene in the finale was very moving, but does the payoff at the end justify the disruption of the flow of the overall narrative?

Another problem was that the writers waited until the very end of season 5 to reveal the whole Jacob v MIB conflict. So they needed a lot of time this season to set up the story and explain the origins of the two beings and the nature of the conflict and the ""rules"" of the game and the candidates and how this relates to the island, etc. They even used one whole episode (""Across the Sea"") to try to explain the mythology, which ended up not being too informative at all. I felt too much information was being crammed, and like the sideways universe, it had a detrimental effect on the flow of the narrative. At the very least they could have revealed parts of the Jacob/MIB story in season 5 to avoid this problem.

My other complaint was how the story arcs of certain characters were concluded in a very unsatisfactory manner. My two biggest disappointments: Claire and Richard Alpert. If we exclude Claire's appearances in the sideways universe (which essentially is just a ""flashback"" to the old Claire we've seen in season 1), then the only thing memorable about her character for this season is her crazy hairdo. The whole ""insane Claire"" seemed promising at the beginning but failed to deliver. By the end she was simply reduced to a bystander in a lot of scenes. Why did the MIB want to recruit her anyway?

And then we have Richard Alpert. A mysterious character we've seen in previous seasons that seemed to know a lot of secrets of the island. Well, it turns out that he does not really know anything. He spent the first half of the season running around in panic after learning that Jacob was dead; at one point he even tried to commit suicide. Then after calming down a bit, his objective for the rest of the season was to ""destroy the Ajira plane."" And he did not even accomplish that. So what was the purpose of his character for this season? Or the entire series? I admit the Richard-centric episode was well done, but if that's all Richard has to contribute to this series, then why create his character in the first place?",1277078400,42,3659,4.580152671755725

4077602,1,B0036EH3X4,"""LOST"" was never primarily about the characters. ""LOST"" was about the mysteries on and surrounding the Island. The characters played a SUPPORTING role for the mysterious Island, not the other way around.

Do you want to know some shows that were ALL ABOUT the characters? How about ""Friends"" or ""Frazier""? In those shows, those characters did basically nothing and basically went nowhere. Those shows were ENTIRELY character driven.

I never saw MYSTERIES being introduced into those shows, but somehow some people have come to the conclusion that ""LOST"", with ALL of it's non-stop mysteries, was about the characters???? PLEASE!!!!!

If ""LOST"" was about the characters, then those characters were IDIOTS, because THEY BELIEVED that the MYSTERIES WERE IMPORTANT. Those characters spent their entire 6 seasons racing around to figure those mysteries out. WHAT FOOLS those characters were. They were even WORSE than the ""average"" viewer, because while we all THOUGHT that ""LOST"" was all about the mysteries, we were ONLY watching. Those MORON characters were actually ACTING as if the mysteries mattered. Just how DUMB could those characters be??????

And in the end, we find out that NOTHING MATTERED. No matter who did what to whom, they ALL end up bathing ""in the light"". Those characters NEVER had to do anything. They never had to fix anything. They never had to understand anything. In the end, EVERYONE ends up in the same place NO MATTER WHAT!!!!!

But the TRUTH is that ""LOST"" was ALWAYS about the MYSTERIES.

Now for the REAL story about Lost......

Lost is an incredibly interesting program with more mysteries and clues than you will know what to do with. Seriously, it's fun and amazing, at least at first.

But when it's all said and done and you get to the finale of season 6, it will be painfully obvious that you have been conned all along. 95% of the mysteries are never solved. They are completely ignored in the end.

For 6 years, the writers of Lost convinced the viewers to wait for the 6th season to have all of the many mysteries revealed in a cohesive story. They asked us to have FAITH.

When season 6 was over, 95% of the mysteries were left unsolved. That was the BETRAYAL.

What other TV series strung the audience along for so long without answering questions from seasons 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 simply by promising to deliver in season 6 and then simply ignoring 95% of those questions in the end?

One 5 star reviewer has been working very diligently to find the answers to a list of MANY unsolved mysteries. You can find the 4 minute video by searching

college humor lost

The 5 star reviewer has come up with quite an interesting list of answers by finding an answer here, another one over there, and making some of them up on his own.

But my question is this......

How many people buy a NEW CAR in parts? Does the salesman direct us to one location for the fenders, another place for the bumpers, another .......... until the customer has a complete car that THEY have to put together themselves?

Nope, we all buy our NEW CARS in one, cohesive, and satisfying package.

People want that same satisfying package in their TV shows.

The writers of Lost told us that they would tie all of the mysteries from seasons 1 - 5 into a cohesive and satisfying story during season 6, and they did not do that.

The writers tried to pawn off various car parts to the viewers rather than provide us with a well made car.

SO MANY of the 5 star reviewers are trying to SELL ""Lost"" like it's the best thing since sliced bread. ""Hey everybody..... Lost is great! You don't need to be spoonfed everything. Just BUY it. Just watch it. Don't think, just FEEL...... blah blah blah""

Well MANY viewers see Lost for the con job that it was and they are speaking out about it.

Read the 1 star reviews to see what avid Lost fans think about the series now.

Another person has commented in a few threads that he suspects that some of the 5 star reviews are actually being written by people who have some connection to the show.

After reading so many reviews telling the readers to ""BUY, BUY, BUY"", I am inclined to agree that there are people posting here who are hired salesmen/women.

Every person should read this short story, which is readily available to read online.....

""The Emperor's New Clothes"" by Hans Christian Anderson. This story was published in 1837 in the book ""Fairy Tales Told for Children""

Hans speaks the simple wisdom that every child can easily understand.

The moral of the story is..... With enough propaganda, the average person can be made to believe ANYTHING.

There are A LOT of 5 star reviewers who are trying to convince people that ""Lost"" is a great show. Well Lost started out to be a great show, but the con-men writers put an end to that.

After you read ""The Emperor's New Clothes"", ask yourself why the 5 star reviewers are pushing so hard to convince you that ""Lost"" is so great.

All of the 1 star reviewers agreed that ""Lost"" was great until season 6, so why this HUGE disagreement now?

Just ponder that story for a while. Simple truths are usually the best.

For people who want to watch a clip from the movie ""Hans Christian Anderson"" that starred Danny Kaye, here is the story of ""The Emperor's New Clothes""

Expectations were ridiculously high--much higher than they ever were for the previous 5 seasons. Season 5 left us fans with many mysteries to ponder upon, and Abrams and Lindelof promised that questions would be answered.

Were there any answers?

I'm going to disagree with a good portion of the reviewers here and say: Yes, yes they were. Season 6 provided a lot more closure than many fans are willing to admit.

I'm sure a good portion of fans who are reading this review (if any at all) are already moaning, groaning and rolling their eyes, but I ask those fans to consider something: Season 6 gave an answer to the smoke monster, the man in black, the nature of Jacob, the ""reason"" that they were all there (c'mon, that's been argued over since Season 1), the whispers, Richard Alpert's story, the effects of the incident, the sickness that consumed Danielle's crew, the overall point of the island, the wheel that Ben used, the source of the electromagnetism and what it does, the statue of Tarawet and how most of it got destroyed, the Black Rock, the origin of the others and their reason for being there, and the temple that's been talked about since the Season 3 finale. I'm not pulling these out of thin air, either. Re-watch the season. For that matter, re-watch the whole show, and then tell me that this season didn't resolve any plot threads. And let's not forget what the previous season have answered, which is much more than fans are, once again, willing to admit. Re-watching the series from the beginning has helped me realize that there really wasn't a whole lot to clear up after the show was finished, though I admit that a few plot threads were left hanging.

It makes me sad to see this season criticized for not fulfilling any promises, when in fact it did, but it requires memory of everything else the series has answered, as well has subtly answered. 6 was hyped up so much that many fans (including myself) put it on some unreachable pedestal, one that no TV show could ever compare to. That's just what happens in a case like this, and it's almost inevitable. Even Abrams and Lindelof seemed to be getting rather defensive when the backlash erupted.

But forget all of that for now. Let's just focus on the show. As always, there are many powerful performances by all of the lead actors. Terry O'Quinn does an outstanding, sinister performance as the man in black that has taken on the form of the deceased John Locke. The story arc of Matthew Fox's character, Jack Shephard, finally comes full circle with realizing his true destiny and rethinking everything he's done on the island. Ben (Michael Emerson) is as deceitful and evil as ever, but even he makes some highly noticeable changes midway through the season. Hurley's ability to talk to dead people is more important than ever, Richard's faith in Jacob is taken to its limits, and the entire LOST team is, once again, divided up. As usual, the show is very entertaining with spectacular performances, plot twists, drama, and none of the characters' dialogue or actions seem out of place. I'll actually admit that I felt underwhelmed at times, but thinking through everything I saw, as well as refreshing my memory on the show, has helped me to not only appreciate the season, but to love it as I love the ones that came before it.

However, I can't give this season the full 5 stars. Sadly, it wasn't perfect, and despite my enjoyment, there were certainly things that could have been done better. The biggest problem with Season 6 is its pacing. Too much time was spent within the temple, and much of the time in this Egyptian maze dragged its feet, sometimes unsure of where it was going. Shoving the Dogen character down our throats and expecting us to care about him felt rather forced and unnatural. Once he was killed, it was stated  that he was the only thing keeping MIB out of the temple. Why is that? I felt they could have spent even a tad of those episodes explaining the reason for this. Surely it had something to do with Jacob assigning him the role, but it was mishandled. Watching the man in black go postal on that place was certainly a Godsend for many fans, myself included. Another portion of the show was spent on the beach just preparing for things to come, as opposed to anyone actually doing anything. It felt tired and, dare I say it, uninspired. It didn't seem smart for the show to be doing this on what is supposed to be the resolution to everything. Lastly, there is the flash-sideways timeline, or ""alternate reality,"" as many fans called it. The true nature of this story line isn't understood until the very last few minutes of the finale. After much thinking and processing, it certainly helps make this side of the story a lot more enjoyable and even relevant (much more relevant than many fans say it is), it doesn't help the previous episodes that they waited entirely too long to explain it. And the two ""realities"" don't even begin to connect until the 11th episode, with only 6 more to go. It was difficult for many fans to grasp the point and relevance of this reality, though I don't mean to suggest that too many fans simply have low intellects. The MIB and Jacob-centric episode ""Across the Sea"" was not as epic and incredible as it could have and certainly had the right to have been. Some parts felt anticlimactic. However, I'm on the side of fans that really liked this episode, and it gave closure to a lot more things than most fans say it did (are you noticing a trend here?).

I'll stop with the criticisms because I feel I'm representing my opinion as being a lot more negative than it actually is (it's actually quite positive). Season 6 was very well done, despite a few shortcomings. The episode that I have to give special note to is the finale, otherwise known as ""The End."" What can I say? I laughed, I cried, I cheered, I watched in awe, and my heart was warmed more than it ever had been by the show. The ""light"" that the protector of the island is meant to protect seems to be a highly symbolic sort of plot device. I'll admit that I'm still trying to figure it out, but it certainly helps answer what the role of Jacob was, and what the role of anyone who is assigned the protector is. I can say without a doubt that the ""alternate reality"" is certainly connected to this light, and part of why it is so necessary to keep it safe. Some fans saw this as a cop-out, along with the AR, but I argue that it fits in with the show as well as everything else we've seen, if you give it a little thought.

Out of all the answers that fans deny that Season 6 gave, no fan can argue that it gave a successful conclusion to each characters' story arc. Watching them evolve over so many episodes has been highly rewarding, and watching them find redemption is easily one of the best and most beautiful scenes of the entire show. I don't feel cheated whatsoever by the ending, and I don't think I would have it end any other way. I applaud the writers and producers for taking such a big risk for the end of their money maker. A new storytelling device and theme is given to each season, and season 6 was no different. It was risky, and they probably knew that some fans would be disappointed, but they created an extremely rewarding experience for this fan and many others. If you're a fan that's been following the show, you owe it to yourself to give this final piece of the puzzle a chance to fit in with the others.",1276819200,6,7811,4.510593220338983

I really enjoyed season 6 - especially ""The End"". That episode wrapped up everything for me. Watching the season again now I am picking up more things I missed in the 1st viewing.

However for those focused on the character development and their storylines I firmly believe Season 6 ends up being one of the best. Rumor has it the complete collection (Seasons 1-6) will contain some answers for those people looking for them. Such as Walt's history, the food drops,  and what happens to Hurley and Ben after the final scenes. But for me the show was and is about the characters themselves.

I am entitled to my opinion so please don't insult me.

I am not an idiot - as one reviewer says that people who just put 1 star on their reviews are  - I also didn't like the ending - and I also feel that it was a copout.  I have actually given it 3 because it was ok, but I wasn't blown away by the 6th season.

We all look for different things in shows and the reason Lost got me hooked in the first place was because of this mysterious island and Jacob, and if it was all about the characters, then surely the biggest character was the island.  Yes, I cared about the human characters and it was good that they got a happy ending - but I feel that there are too many gaps between season 5 and season 6.  I am sorry but the ending did not work for me - no matter what is said in these reviews and whether I am insulted for not agreeing with someone who thought it was brilliant.  If you thought it was brilliant, that's great - you found something I didn't.

I felt that season 6 was rushed and it was a token effort to include some sort of ending for the island - it gave me the feeling that they did not know how to end it because they had put so many mysteries into it - the writers are certainly not geniuses.

I am not one of those people that want to have their hand held when I watch a film or tv show - I do like to think about it - but I do like to have some questions answered when they say this is the end.

I thought it had a brilliant pilot, first season, went up and down in seasons 2-5 but it was still compelling & then you get season 6 - which seemed to belong to a different story - or another story is needed inbetween seasons 5 & 6.

I got up for the 5am start (I live in England) and wished I hadn't bothered, but I am learning to let go and appreciate it for those seasons that I did enjoy.

 The flash forwards and flash backwards were confusing, but forced the viewer to pay attention. The flash ""sideways"" brouht a ray of hope to the viewers who became attched to the characters.

But no, it's absolutely not true what some people are saying: that *the whole series* was a dream and *the Island* was Purgatory (those who think this got the end wrong). However, yes, it's true that in the end, the series decided to embrace spiritualism while in its whole run, it balanced science and faith with extreme caution.

If you expect explanations, you will hate the season. If you feel like you need to know the answer to every single mistery the series created (like, why was Walt special and why was Libby in a mental institution), you will hate the season. If you are agnostic, atheist, or downright hate everything that smells spiritual, you will hate the season. In short, if you are the Jack of season 1, you will hate the season.

If you think that no explanation whatsoever would be satisfying, and that part of the appeal of the show was how it made you theorize and think and wonder, you'll probably like the season. If you are aware that, yes, producers didn't had everything planned from the beginning and therefore some mysteries will be left unexplained (or given lame explanations), you'll forgive some of the season's flaws. But if you, like me, watched the series because of the characters and their stories and the way they interacted with each other, if you cared about these people, and you expected resolutions instead of explanations, you will probably love the season.

I, for one, absolutely loved it. It's probably not as good as seasons 1 or 5, but it's still amazing. And the ending was exciting, funny, emotional, well acted, subperbly directed, and it gave the whole story a satisfying conclusion that left almost (almost) no room for sequels or spin-offs or movies (which is a good thing).

If you watched Season 6 of Lost on TV, and liked what you saw, then this review is not for you.

If for some reason you are contemplating buying this because you've heard all the hype about this show, I'm going to attempt to dissuade you from doing so.

This entire series is an expertly written tease with no payoff at the end.

But unlike David Lynch movies, this one does not stand up to repeat viewings, because the tease does not get more interesting each time you watch it.  It actually gets more annoying because you know exactly which bits are the red herrings, and which parts actually go somewhere.

If you can get past the story, nearly everything else about this TV series is fantastic.  The location is beautiful, the special effects work well for a TV show.  The musical score by Michael Giaciano is haunting and beautiful.  The acting by Terry O'Quinn and Michael Emerson is probably the best I've seen on television.

The cast and crew of this show should be extremely proud of the job they have done.  It's by far the most cinematic and epic sweeping show to be on TV these last 6 years and I'm sad to see it go, as I expect after this no network will attempt anything this daring.

Such a shame that it was ruined by a horrible 6th season of writing.",1275523200,42,1295,4.372384937238493
4077648,1,B0036EH3X4,"I've been a huge fan of Lost since Season 1.  I bought all of the seasons on DVD.  I convinced my friends to give this series a chance, loaned them my DVDs to watch so they could catch up and get hooked when the latest episode aired.

However, I was very disappointed with Season 6.

Spoilers begin here, so stop reading if you really want to find out for yourself.

Many other Amazon reviewers have already pointed out the big mysteries never revealed, and I agree with nearly all of them.  However, if there is one glaring example of how the writers failed this season, it's in the season opener.

In every first episode of each of the six seasons, the first episode featured a grand, iconic image which foretold what was to come, and teased the importance of the series.  In Season 6, we're treated to a view on board on airplane which apparently is in 2004.  It is the the flight that does NOT crash on the island.  Curious things are different on this flight, but at the end of the season opener, there is this fantastic shot:

The camera pans out through the window, down into the ocean below, and shows a grand sweeping view of the island completely underwater.  It's submerged, with all of the details that indicate that SOMETHING HAPPENED to sink this island!  OK, we're all excited now!  This season is going to show us WHAT HAPPENED TO SINK THE ISLAND!

And that answer never comes!  It turns out this entire ""flash-sideways"" alternate reality is not real at all, but a sort of purgatory that never really existed.  It's just a place where the island survivors can find each other before they move onto heaven.  Or whatever.  So if that's the ""beautiful conclusion"", WHY SHOW US THE SUNKEN ISLAND?!

Sadly, the sunken island is another one of those items which is hyped up clearly to appear to be incredibly important, but then dismissed later as totally unimportant.

Examples:

In Season 1, Claire is told repeatedly, by many people who seem to know something (how else could they be giving her the same advice?) that her baby Aaron, should NOT BE RAISED BY ANOTHER.  Very important, this fact.  Why?  And why would all these people know this?  (Again, another silently discarded mystery.)

In Season 1, Walt is clearly magical.  Heck, birds lose their ability to navigate and fly into windows when he's around.  The Others know this, kidnap him and subject him to many tests.  Huge amount of time spent trying to track him down and figure out how to get him back.  Why is he so important?  Why does he appear to John Locke magically like he's a ghost on the island?

Hugo's main squeeze, Libby, is shown as being stuck in a mental institution.  Why is this important?

Eloise Hawking is able to talk to our main man Desmond, and tell him all about time travel, and how you can't change the past, it course-corrects.  She's almost like a God in Season 3, all knowing and calm.  Kind of like the Oracle in the Matrix movies.  She even seems to have lived this life many times in the past, as she says in later seasons to Charles Widmore, ""for the first time, I don't know what's going to happen.""  So what happened with her?

The biggest insult of all is that dedicated fans subscribed to the Official Lost Podcast on ABC's website and through iTunes.  Every week the podcast was put on by the two executive producers and head writes, Damon Lindelef and Carlton Cuse, who insisted they had a plan.  Go back and watch the Season 1 DVD extra features where another writer will be shown insisting that all this chaos does have a plan.  Stick with us, they promise, it's all going to work out in the end.  They convinced me that they knew all about bad story telling - they hated Star Wars prequels ""explanation"" of the force.  Right there with you guys.  They also really didn't like endings where ""it was all a dream"".  That's a relief.  And they promised, no ending like the Sopranos.

By the end of the Season 6 podcasts though, I started to get a real pit in my stomach, and really worried.  They talked about how much the *like* the Sopranos ending.  Wha-what?!  And they talked about how much they hated the Matrix sequels, saying that over-explaining was worse than leaving things a mystery.  Uh, okay, I understand, but you're starting to make me worry that maybe you're just going leave stuff behind.  Viewers would ask questions about what happened with Walt and Claire, and they would make silly jokes.  And then they decided maybe they should end the podcast before the finale, because they wanted the show to ""speak for itself"".  No appearances on on TV shows after the finale either.  Hmm, sounds like these guys are running away from something.

Then the finale happened.  And the backlash began.  I feel for these guys, in some ways.  They built a huge mystery for 3 seasons before they knew how long the show was going to run.  So in many ways, they dug a big hole without knowing how large they needed to make it.  But then they announced triumphantly after Season 3 they secured an end date with ABC for 6 seasons.  Fantastic!  They were proud of how this is a rare occurence; a chance to end the show ON THEIR OWN TERMS.  They had 3 years of shows ahead of them, a chance to map the endign the way they wanted - stick with them, it's going to be great ride.

We stuck with you guys.  But something seems like now, you *didn't* plan the end of Season 6 back 3 years ago.  You were still winging it, year upon year, and you dug *bigger holes* all the way through Season 5.",1275523200,102,5499,4.485858585858586

Through every episode you wonder how it will all end, if everything will be explained. Some may be dissapointed to find that the latter is not the case. But in a show this complex, can everything really be properly explained? There have been flaws and a few pointless episodes throughout the entire series, but in the end, it doesn't matter. Because the end is beautiful and morose at the same time. It all makes sense, as strange as that sounds, and it wraps up solemnly and quietly, and though you wish it could go on forever and ever, you realize, this is the perfect way to end it. Will there be another show like this? Nobody knows, and I feel that people will still be trying to digest this series for many years to come.

The first five seasons were great in their own right, and Season 6 does not disappoint. There are a fair amount of people out there complaining about unanswered mysteries and questions, but I would challenge any of those people to name one unanswered question that dealt in any way with the central story line of the show. The genius of Lost lies in the writers' ability to draw the audience in to the flawed lives of the characters in a remarkably intriguing way. In this sixth and final season, the writers used a brand new storytelling device. We have seen flashes to the past and the future before, but now we are introduced to a Flash Sideways. Great way of intriguing the viewer, and also somewhat confusing. It keeps the viewer off balance between the Flash Sideways and the Island's story which plays out in very satisfying fashion. The Dynamic between the characters is at an all time high. Terry O'Quinn and Matthew Fox are absolutely fantastic throughout the season. Michael Emerson has moments where he would be a hands down favorite for the Emmy if it weren't for O'Quinn. Nestor Carbonell gets more screentime than ever and he takes it a long way. The Stories regarding the Island are resolved very well. The thing about watching LOST is that you are going to have to use your brain. The Writers are absolutely not spelling anything out for the Audience even here in Season 6. The one time it actually does happen, it comes off a little too blatant. That is what makes LOST the show it is. The characters play out their story and concern themselves with the questions important to their overall goal. Those questions are answered very well, and most every other is answered enough for the audience to deduce the rest for themselves.

Some say the writers knew the whole story from the start, some say they made it up as they went along.

Some say they introduced new mystery after new mystery just to keep intelligent viewers tuning in, some say all the mysteries had complete meaning.

Some say you can discover all the answers if you try hard enough and make things up, some say why would anybody even bother.

Some say it is one of the greatest stories ever told, some say it is a bunch of crap.

Some say the love LOST, some say they hate LOST.

it goes on..... and on......and on.

Strangely, most viewers will not have a polarized opinion on any one point, but will have their own interpretation somewhere in-between the extremes.

And, even more strangely, some people will agree with some people on some points and then disagree with the same people on other points.

If you put 20 people who have watched LOST in a room and ask them the same set of questions, you'll get 20 different sets of answers.

Every single person can and will point to something completely subjective to substantiate their opinions.

Personally, I think LOST was the result of Cuse and Lindelhof spilling over a giant literary ink bottle and smearing the ink around for years and then claiming it is a masterpiece of Intentional Splatter.

LOST could have been a nice little Story which ""coulda been great"", if they would have kept it in a Mini-Series format, like Roots or Shogun.

But, instead they stretched it out to make as much money as they could and in the process turned it into nothing but sloppy mess.

A mess  exactly like a giant Rorschach Test,  which requires the viewer to inject their own personality traits and beliefs into the interpretation to make some sense of it.

But, on the other hand, some could point to this ""openness to interpretation"" as one of the strong positives of LOST.

A little thought after getting over the cheap emotions of the finale's reunion of lovers will give everyone pause - the story and plot simply made no sense as there were too many obviously unanswered questions.  Oh, but it was just Jack's nano-second of post death experience.  Who cares, then, what happenned if it was Jack's dream.

A better ending would have been to use the sideways flashes to legitimize what Juliet did in the Season Five finale.  That was the alternate world created by her successfully exploding the Nuke and changing time in the process.  And the reunions could have been the door opening to the world of Lost that went on in some parallel universe unknown to the sideways characters. That would have at least given some rationale for the sideways world. And Jack still could have died, but in the reality of the parallel universe instead of in a plane crash.

They stringed us along all this time to throw a Jacob's Ladder ending in our faces. By a Jacob's Ladder ending, I DON'T mean to say that the Losties all turned out to be dead; it's obvious that they weren't. They all just met later on in some afterlife (really lame, I know, but that's what happened). By Jacob's Ladder, I mean an ending that's in some ways moot, and doesn't have the kind of significance you were led to believe it would. I don't particularly mind an ending like that in some cases, but it was WRONG for a show like Lost. I would like to be clear about something: I am not complaining about the creators' failure to ""reveal everything."" I wouldn't presume to expect that kind of gratification from any form of art or entertainment. What I am offended by, is the sheer brazen irresponsibleness of the creators, introducing countless mysteries, puzzles, and items of supposed monumental portent which, for the most part, they obviously never intended to solve, explain, or redeem since they clearly had no idea what the answers and meanings were in the first place.  I will concede that some answers were provided, and yes, in a lame way they made sense, but the problem is that they were just THAT: LAME.

I had watched Lost with a growing sense of wonder and delight. I was foolish enough to believe that the creators had a predesigned plan. I was wrong, and am still kind of heartbroken.

4077671,2,B0036EH3X4,"Well after all these years of clever twists, they ended the show with the same ending from Titanic?  Yikes.

Season 1 was fresh if long winded.  Season 2 ran into a road block of nonsense.  Season 3 turned the tide with an amazing finale.  Season 4 was a great beginning to the end.  And season 5 made great, if overextended, use of time travel. Save amazing episodes like Dr. Linus and Ab Aeterno, there was precious little to save Season 6 from mediocrity.

Overall, I strongly feel the series went one season too many.  A slightly longer season 5 with a couple less filler episodes easily could have taken on this story concept and closed the overall character arcs.  I didn't hate season 6 at all.  But I didn't like it very much either.  A laugh out loud explanation for the ""sideways"" flushed it for me.

4077672,1,B0036EH3X4,"I agree with everything said in the previous 1 star reviews. Earlier seasons wove a plot full of intellectually stimulating mysteries, with the producers explicitly promising resolutions. It was the reason the majority of people were watching, with the growing culture of speculation in anticipation of the answers the primary reason for the show's success (a simple castaway soap opera wouldn't have lasted 2 seasons).

Season 6 could have been the amazing if it had concentrated on resolving the first 5. Instead they did an about face and copped out, taking the laziest, most anti-intellectual path they possibly could have gotten away with. Season 6 was for the most part an answer-free punch in the gut, wasting 1/2 the season on the flash sideways which in the end had zero relevance to anything on the island, even though it was stuffed full of red herrings indicating it would. The generic religious finale, contrived solely to reunite couples for a schmultzy ""happy"" ending was (relative to intellectual potential) EASILY the worst in the history of television. In the end the producers turned out to be nothing but con men, throwing mysteries at viewers to keep them watching, claiming there was a purpose to them, then doing an about face claiming the show was always only about the characters and the mysteries didn't matter.

As a huge fan of the first 5 seasons it wouldn't have taken much from S6 to get me to buy the set on blu-ray. Now there is no point. Thanks to the unbelievably disappointing ending and knowing the irrelevance of it all I will not even be able to enjoy watching reruns on TV. I cannot imagine a worse, more lazy ending.

4077673,4,B0036EH3X4,"After six long years, television's most engrossing show has come to a close.  What can we say about the end?

First and foremost-- the ending does satisfy.  But by how much?  Let's discuss a bit more.

It's safe to say that most viewers were expecting from the show a mind-blowing ending in two distinct varieties:  first, that the show's end would have strong allusions to very first few episodes of Lost, illustrating the show's greatest strength wherein the outcome of events and revelations seem to have originated from many episodes, if not seasons, back.  This gave the audience the sensation [or illusion] that the show was meticulously crafted and plotted way in advance.  While the ending does have this type of moment, particularly in the episode ""Across the Sea."" and its flashback to Season 1, it is not a masterstroke befitting of the ""Lost"" pedigree, especially since it is the final masterstroke and should be the best of Lost's secrets.  There are many more revelations in Lost more intriguing in terms of long-development/rich pay-off types, most particularly the revelation of the Hatch's origin.  With that said, the revelation of ""Across the Sea"" in terms of the origins of Adam and Eve and how they seem to connect with the initial episodes of the show still feels satisfying despite a vague sensation of being underdeveloped.

Secondly, audiences seem to want and expect for the ending to do a crazy backflip in terms of storytelling reminiscent of films such as Memento or The Sixth Sense.  This is a type of storytelling device where new information at the end retroactively changes our understanding of the entire preceding events.  While a component similar to this storytelling device does play out with the series finale and how the Alternate Reality [or is it?] and the Current Reality co-exist, it also is good but not great.  [SPOILER ALERT.]  It is enjoyable to watch the main cast of the story receive a happy ending, even if they all died either on the island or some point in their lives.  But again, it is not on the scale as say, a Memento or Sixth Sense.  Good, but not great.

As for plot-points, ""Lost"" ties up its loose ends nicely considering how sprawling the show actually has become.  The character of Richard is explained [quite beautifully, I might add.] the origins of the Jacob and the Smoke Monster, the statue with the three toes.  Even the children from Oceanic Flight 815 abducted by the Others in Season 2 is explained!  [They were growing up at the temple.]

However, compared to other seasons in the rich catalog of Lost, Season Six is just not the best one.  One can successfully argue that the tone of the show has changed dramatically over the years:  Seasons One and Two were more methodical, akin to the brooding episodes of the X-Files.  Season Three was a strange and forgettable season.  Season Three and Four were more in vein of '24', rich and kinetic.  But Season Six has its own vibe which is hard to categorize.  In terms of sheer energy, it is a step behind Seasons 4 and 5.  In terms of mystery, it is a step behind Season 1 and 2.  But taking its components together, it still delivers a satisfying ending.

Lastly, the show is at its poignant best when its dramatic beats contain strong Christian underpinnings.  A prime example is the Hatch's button-pressing and the Christian obligation of obeying the moral law.  An example of this in the final season occurs when Jack explains his reason for returning to the island:  ""I was broken.  And I was stupid enough to think the island could fix me.""  However, the ending just didn't have enough of this dynamism between dramatic beats and Christian connotations.  Jacob states that he wants a successor when he goes.  But the Christian God doesn't want a successor-- he exist eternally.  The disconnect between Judeo-Christian theology and Lost's conception of Jacob hampered a lot of what made the show relevant-- seeking a deeper understanding of a God.

With that said, the final season will undoubtedly face its nitpickers and those who will think hard of finding faults with the last episodes [as I initially did upon my first viewing.]  However, in contrast to other shows which promised big storyline payoffs that never delivered [Battlestar Galatica, to be more precise.] Lost does a tremendous job of bringing its run to a close.  A good, not great, but good-great ending!",1275177600,7,4401,4.8210947930574095

Sure, they showed us how Jacob and the Smoke Monster came to be, but where did the woman who raised them come from? What is the light and why does it need protecting? Is the island a real place or all in Jack's mind? What about the Darma Initiative? The relevance of Hugo's numbers? I could go on an on, but the truth is, we will never know. None of it mattered, and so therefore, owning all these Seasons on DVD doesn't matter either. They have become completely unwatchable simply because I know now that we'll never get the answer's.

4077686,4,B0036EH3X4,"Posted 5/28/2010: The tagline for Lost's fifth season, ""Destiny Found,"" would more properly be applied to this, the show's sixth and final season. In season five, the characters and the show was plagued with confusion, mystifying questions, and very bad advice (the two worst ideas being the killing of Jacob, and the attempt to change history by blowing up a nuclear bomb). In Lost's sixth year, however, things finally come to a point and the survivors face the reasons they were brought to the Island, while learning more about it itself and its history, mostly the history of Jacob and the smoke monster. Jack finally accepts his destiny, becoming an admirable and mature hero. John Locke is in the end vindicated, even as his memory is deeply dishonored by the series' central antagonist. At times the season falters, such as with the explanation of the Whispers, a central mystery present in the show's background. To me, this was a question that didn't need to be answered. Strange whispers heard in the jungle are more powerful and interesting as mysterious phenomenon than as solved mysteries. And much of the philosophical content of the two mythology-centered episodes, ""Ab Aeterno"" and ""Across the Sea,"" are illogical at best. Mankind is neither good nor evil, but a tragic mixture of both. Evil is not a positive substance that can be contained or allowed to escape; and different religions that differ from each other in basic and essential ways, that advocate conflicting and opposing paths, cannot lead to the same end. But what show is perfect? As long as these flaws are taken as what they are -- flaws -- the show still shines despite them, giving Lost a very satisfying ending. Lost is a great show because it is one whose mysteries and the answers to those mysteries enrich the experience of watching the show over again. In a way, the passing of a show that has tackled such interesting and important questions as skepticism vs. faith, and in such a compelling and character-driven way, is sad; yet the way in which it passes is beautiful. The action and adventure of the series finale, ""The End,"" matches the series' highest points of excitement and thrills; the final confrontation between Jack and his unholy adversary is breathtaking. And the final revelation of the ""Sideways world""'s true nature is an interesting treatment of a challenge that is necessary for every human being to face. All told, Lost has always been an ambitious show that never shied away from taking risks, and in the end it was inevitable that some would be disappointed. Certain things could have been done better, but then a great many things could have easily been done much, much worse. One thing is certain: this kind of a show, with such great characters, such deep themes, such great daring in storytelling, is rare, possibly coming only once in every generation.",1275004800,9,2870,4.895277207392197
4077687,2,B0036EH3X4,"I think ABC missed a golden opportunity not packaging the Final Season in a white box and a black box, offering the season through the perspectives of Jacob and the Man in Black respectively.  After all, this was the duality set up six years ago when Locke was showing Walt how to play backgammon, giving him a little lesson on Manichaeism by holding up black and white game pieces.  Odd, that throughout this long and troubling final season, Cuselof made no reference back to this memorable scene.

The season certainly offered a promising start.  The opening double episode was packed with thrills and intrigues that carried over into two or three more episodes, but as Cuselof tried to give us ""deeper"" insights into the island, the action all but came to a halt and we seemed to digress into a quasi-Biblical view of the island culminating in the Ballad of Jacob and His Brother, which presented us with the origins of the ""game"" they played between them, and the Man in Black's long suppressed desire to get off the island.

Cuselof toyed with us a little with another band of castaways led by Dogen, who guarded the Temple from the evil that has come to possess Locke.  We also get treated to an alternative reality set in LA where the Lostaways seemed to be looking for their individual redemption.  No mention of Dharma, and Ben seems reduced to a shadow of his former self.  Despite the new cast members, the return of Widmore, and the interesting ""sideways"" episodes, this show returns to the core members from Season One, with the Jacob/MIB story woven into the early episodes through flashbacks.

Unfortunately, it isn't very satisfying, as the writers choose to leave much of the island history they developed over five seasons in the crater left by the explosion at the Swan station at the end of Season Five, and take us on a more spiritual journey that loses most of the tension set up in the initial episodes.  But, feeling they may have gotten too sentimental, they jolted us back into the here and now with an island-shaking final episode that attempted to resolve the dual realities they set up.

You will either love or hate this final season, as it is quite a departure from the previous seasons. I think a little more thought needs to be given to its packaging, and throwing in some extras that help explain some of the creative process behind this show would be in order. At the very least, they should include the ""Lost Untangled"" web series with Puppet Chang, as it was a lot of fun, and showed that the writers could at least poke fun at themselves.",1274918400,9,2576,4.63956043956044

4077689,5,B0036EH3X4,"In this review, I wanna share with you some thoughts about ""The End"" and why Lost will always have a place in my heart for the rest of my life.

But for that matter, I will let a friend of mine talk about it, because, I can't express with the same clever way than him. Credits to [...]. This for me is the perfect interpretation of what the show was about, so read carefully. Oh, by the way, it contains spoilers:

So here it goes:

There's a plane. Oceanic 815. This plane represents us, men. Us, always sky high, us, involved in a metal shield hard to be broken. We are always here and there, here and there, flying in high speed, here and there, without thinking, always carrying fragile things inside ourselves, always in the hights, always, going higher and higher, and higher each second, like this, in a flash.

Only sometimes, we fall. Sometimes, we break in little pieces.

So let's take a look in one of these men: Jack Sheppard. He represents us, this plane. And this plane falls on an island, this man, falls into his own conscience: the island.

By the way, who is the first character appearing in the show? That's right, JACK! Jack opens his eyes.

And what happens next? Jack is walking by the forest and then finally arrives in front of his broken person: the plane. And all those people that were there, they were Jack's little fragments. All the characters on the show, all those characters we came to know and love are fragments of Jack's persona. That's right, Lost is all about Jack. Lost is all about men.

So if we stop and start to think hard, all the characters represents a little fragment of Jack that was spread into Jack's conscience (the island) and Jack represents men, and men are represented by the plane of flight 815.

And now Jack will have to recover because he fell, he broke, and now Jack will have to put all his fragments together again. And this happens only now in Season 6, when all of these fragments starts to find one another in the once called parallel reality, which we learn in the final seconds, it's the afterlife.

And the afterlife has begun after Juliet detonates the hydrogen bomb. And who is Juliet in the afterlife? Well, Juliet is the mother of Jack's son. If all the characters are fragments of Jack, Juliet can be seen as the mother, in other words, the mother fragment inside men. It's the mother of men who promotes the miracle of closing the circle with all these fragments meeting each other, connecting each other and being like one again in Jack.

And so finally Jack have his peace, which is the most beautiful example.

And in the final scene, when Jack returns to the place where he first woke up on the island, who is the one that is in the very side of Jack once again? That's right, VINCENT, the dog. And what is the dog? Well the dog is men's best friend. So it's men's best friend together with men, we can remember the very first sequence in the beginning of the series when Vincent just passes by, he's not in the side of Jack; Vincent is also... LOST. But now, in the end, the circle is closed and Jack is his own best friend. Jack found himself. Now, Jack is fixed, he's one again, he's complete.

Once the fragments of Jack was Lost, was all spread. But now, they found one another, they are connected, and they are ready to leave.

It makes perfect sense. Once again:

The plane is a symbol: the man. The island is man's conscience, the man was cast away into his own conscience. When the episode finishes, we can remember Jack leaving the place he fell in the first episode, walking to the beach, looking all around, and then he starts to understand: that's me, I'm like this, I'm broken, look at all my spread fragments all over my conscience... it will be a long journey to put it all back together again.

And to sum it all: we are left with two words: broke and leave. In the beginning we are all broken. In the end, all we want is leave. In the end, Jack is ready to die. Ready to leave.

And to conclude: what was that plane that passes in the end? Well, we can think of: Ajira, Oceanic 815, or even another plane. But for me, it's just another man who flies. And this man will find himself... and leave.

What a beautiful way of thinking. What a wonderful ending... what a fantastic show!",1274832000,7,4277,4.38558786346397
4077690,1,B0036EH3X4,"""The time for questions is over.""  I originally thought this tag line, which was used to promote season six in commercials, meant that the big  mysteries of Lost would finally be answered.  I see now that it really meant ""Hey, stop asking questions!  We don't possess the creative ability to answer them.""  I'm not saying that every little detail needed to be thoroughly explained, but I had expected to be left with some kind of cohesive understanding of things.  I expected that the big mysteries would be addressed at a minimum.  Sadly, I was mistaken.  And the few mysteries that were ""resolved"" were largely underwhelming and disappointing.  By the way, this will contain spoilers if you haven't seen this season.
The first five seasons of Lost were amazing.  They comprise the most fascinating and captivating television that I have ever had the pleasure of watching.  Season six, however, was a gigantic letdown.  After the initial reveal of the Smoke Monster being the Man in Black/Fake Locke, the pace of the show really slowed to a crawl, and in my opinion, it felt like the writers were just killing time with most of the episodes without really advancing the plot much or explaining anything.  But I still tuned in every week and had faith in the show.  Then came the Richard-centric episode ""Ab Aeterno.""  I always found Richard to be one of the most intriguing characters, and his backstory should have been epic.  This was the first episode that made me realize this season was not going to be as fantastic as it could and should be.  I continued watching and continued hoping that the season would be redeemed.  And then I saw ""Across the Sea.""  I don't even know where to begin with this episode.  The writers squandered an enormous opportunity again to explain much of the mythology of Lost.  I felt that the line ""The more questions I answer will only leave you with more questions."" was directed entirely at the audience, and it was a slap in the face because it's tantamount to complete creative laziness.  It was a device used solely to squirm their way out of having to explain anything to us.  And the mystical light at the heart of the island?  I can't think of anything more contrived and Disney-esque.  And sure, we found out how the man In Black became the Smoke Monster.  Well, we saw it happen, anyway.  There really was no explanation to it.  The only reveal approaching a satisfying resolution in that episode was the history behind the Adam and Eve skeletons.  ""Across the Sea"" made me nervous and concerned for the resolution of the series, but I kept believing that the finale would wrap up the show nicely, and the series as a whole would stand as a cogent, comprehensible piece of masterful storytelling.  Obviously, I don't think the finale did anything of the sort.
I want to take a look at some of the mysteries that were supposedly resolved.
The Smoke Monster.  We've been wondering about this thing since the Pilot, and I think the answer they've presented in the series is half an attempt at best.  So what is the Smoke Monster?  Well, he's the Man in Black, or at least, the MIB's consciousness or something.  Ok, great...so what is the Smoke Monster?  I'm not saying I want to know what he's made out of or anything like that, but all we've been presented with is the idea that he's evil incarnate.  And we gather that only from the dialogue of characters who are opposed to the Smoke Monster.  The MIB as portrayed in ""Across the Sea"" is not evil; he simply wants to leave the island.  This brings me to another question that was not satisfactorily explained.  Why would it be bad for the MIB to leave the island?  We get vague cryptic responses like ""hell on earth"" from Jacob or ""everything you know and love will cease to be"" from , I think, Widmore.  Again, this is just information from characters who are enemies of the MIB, so it just seems a little biased.  When a character on Lost makes an assertion, it's hard to tell if they are telling the truth, lying, or just ignorant.
The Numbers.  There was so much mystery built up around the numbers.  They were part of the Valenzetti equation.  They won Hurley the lottery and brought him bad luck.  They were printed on the outside of the hatch.  They had to be typed into the computer in the hatch.  And they showed up randomly throughout numerous episodes.  All this mystery was built up, and then they reveal that the numbers were simply designators given to the last few candidates by Jacob.  I thought it was a cool idea at first, expecting them to build upon it somehow and reveal an even greater depth or profoundness to the numbers, but then I realized nope, that's it.  Just random, arbitrary numbers assigned by Jacob.  I thought it was a major letdown.
The Black Rock/Broken Statue.  How did a ship end up miles inland in the jungle?  Back towards the end of season one, Arzt suggests that maybe it was a tidal wave.  No, it couldn't be.  That would be too simplistic for a show like Lost.  Wait.  Turns out it was just a tidal wave.  And it must have been one hell of a tidal wave to batter a wooden ship against a stone statue, destroying the statue in the process but leaving the ship relatively in tact, and still have enough force to carry that very same ship miles into the jungle.  Weak and unimaginitive.
While those are some incomplete or unsatisfying answers, there were so many fascinating ideas that they completely abandoned altogether.
Why couldn't the Others have children on the island?
Why was Walt so special?  And then they made it seem that he was too powerful, and the Others were happy to get rid of him with absolutely no explanation.
What was the big deal with Aaron being raised by Claire?  They made a big deal out of it in season one, and then the idea just kinda went away.
What exactly was the MIB's loophole?  Was it claiming the likeness of a candidate?  If that was it, then why did it take him so long to do it?  He had two thousand years of Jacob bringing candidates to the island and those candidates certainly dying on the island.  You would think he would have gotten around to it sooner.  And also, that's just a stupid loophole.  If Jacob's making the rules, why would he say ""You can't kill me.  Oh wait, unless you take the form of one of my candidates.  Then you can kill me.""  The loophole seems too important not to explain.
What exactly were Jacob's rules?  Again, I thought the whole idea of Jacob making up a completely arbitrary set of rules was another way for the writers to be lazy.  ""Something we don't want to take the time to explain?  Oh, it's just one of Jacob's rules.""  And what about moving the island and not being able to return?  Was this another one of Jacob's rules?  If it was, then obviously his rules can be broken as Ben was able to return after moving the island.
What was up with the ash?  Why was it able to contain the Smoke Monster?
What about all the Egyptian influence?
Why did Eloise Hawking seem to know everything, and whose side was she on?
Why couldn't Ben kill Widmore off the island but then had no trouble killing him on the island?
What was the ""magic box"" that Ben used to retrieve Anthony Cooper?
I could go on and on, but this is already getting too long.  Essentially, I believe that the writers completely gave up on season six.  They threw up their hands in defeat and decided to ignore several issues and give us simplistic half answers on others instead of meeting the monumental creative challenge of answering most of the questions in the profound and thought-provoking manner that we had come to expect from Lost.  Season six displays the story telling prowess of a little kid.  ""And then there was this guy, and he had an evil twin, and then he threw him into this light, and then he became a...a...a SMOKE MONSTER!  And the Smoke Monster couldn't leave the island because that would be really bad, and he can't go across ash, and he can't go into the temple if Dogen lives there.  And then...""
Season six was a colossal disappointment to say the least.  I had it pre-ordered from the moment I knew it was available for pre-order, but I've cancelled my order since seeing the finale.",1274832000,64,8191,4.533788395904437

With exception of couple of episodes this was an amazing season.  Lost has always been character driven show.  There has never been a show that has been talked about so much.  So many genres united so many people otherwise would not be in the same room.  The Philosophy,the Mythology, Science Fiction, Drama...this show offered everything. This was by far the best show in last 20-30 yrs.  If Terry O'Quinn and Matthew Fox and the show doesn't get Emmy awards I would be very surprised.  The show has always been very well acted.  That is one of the reasons that makes this show very compelling.  Even though the show didn't answered all the questions (which they didn't need to anyway) it makes people keep talking about it.

The series features a level of violence that surpasses ""Mighty Mouse"" or ""Tom and Jerry"" cartoons, the killings of people for no reason occur every few minutes, the treacherous heroes swap their allegiances and loyalties more frequently than they change their underwear, the people are caught in a sort of stubborn irrationality, and for no apparent reason they fell in love and then abandon their affections. Upon all this the authors pile tons of mind-boggling puzzles, mysteries, riddles, enigmas - all this only to resolve it by a sort of ""A riddle for you: do you know what's shiny, buzzes and you cannot catch it? - No, I do not! - Ah, that's pity, 'cause I don't know either!"" - and after all these you say me: ""It's all about the characters""?
These ""characters"", even the major ones, were killed and forgotten without trace in each of the episodes. Who does remember Mr. Eco the Nigerian (2nd season). Looked like a great ""It's about the character"" until he was killed for nothing and erased from the plot? Just an example. The ""characters"" were more expendable than the privates in a WWI movie. ""LOST"" lured the audience into watching (and high rating) by mysteries and ""more answers"" - and defaulted on the promise.

It seems the script-writers climbed on a very high tree of their imagination only to find that they are unable to descend safely, so they took to the ""Dorothy is back to Kansas"" vaguely happy ending parachute.

And who is the majestic figure that reveals to Jack the final truth? Of all people, his father, a drunkard, completely lacking any moral integrity, without whom no Inferno can be happy! He is the Divine Messenger that ascends into the Heavenly Shining Light! OMG, what a mediocrity...

Alternatively,I would summarize the story in this synopsis: A) In season 1, episode 1, the 1st minute: The plane crashed, Jack, laying on his back, opens an eye - B) season 6, the last episode, last minute: several seconds later, the same Jack, laying on his back, closes the eye and dies - and all of this 6 seasons, dozens of episodes was a multitude of imaginary events that were only in his dying imagination, were not real, there were no mysteries to be answered, nothing of it really happened, just a few last seconds of dying Jack, between the moment A and the moment B.

Very well.

Do we find out what the Dharma Initiative was really doing, where it came from, and what happenned to it afterwards?  Nope.

Do we find out what the giant statue was on the island, and where the temple came from? Nope.

Do we learn about Jacob and the Smoke Monster? Yes!

With so much enigma through to the end of the show, there is a lot of room for people to be thoroughly ticked off that their favorite plot line didn't get resolved.  But let's face it, it's Lost, and it has NEVER fully explained much of anything.

It has, however, been about the characters.  That is where this season truly shines.

That's also where the ending shines.  The last episode of Lost brings resolution to one of the primary character's story in Lost, and the ending is, far and away, one of the most poetic and powerful endings to an American show I have seen a VERY long time.  It also seems more like an ending from a good novel, rather than the usual, run of the mill, television show ending.

This show has set the bar VERY high for drama shows, and for that reason alone, it is worth owning Lost.  I highly recommend the sixth season if you have any of the prior seasons.  You also might want to look at the complete collection if you are missing a significant number of the seasons.",1274832000,8,1321,4.33469387755102
4077697,5,B0036EH3X4,"I still can't really believe LOST is over. The series finale left many ends untied. If you've hung on to LOST this long only to find out the answers to the mysteries throughout the series -- I'm afraid you're not going to get very many. That's left a lot of viewers rather disappointed and angry.

At first, it bothered me, as well. But the more I thought about it, the more I appreciated just how they ended it. Most shows go out of their way to give you a ""God's-eye-view"" of the plot, and for the most part that works. It's great to see threads from the early part finally tie up at the end. LOST bucks that trend by only giving you bits and pieces of the puzzle. But that's what makes it work for me: one of the morals of the story is that you don't get all the answers. You get only a partial view, and you have to decide what to make of it all.

On the downside, ""Across the Sea"" was a complete waste of an episode. It betrayed everything that made LOST great: it's a full-episode flashback that reveals next to nothing, is riddled with anachronisms (e.g. Jacob's mother only had one name? Seriously? If she were really a Roman, she'd be naming all the children after the father and adding a cardinal number -- primus, secundus, tertius -- to it to denote birth-order.), and translates everything said into English rather than using the language actually being spoken.",1274745600,8,1374,4.405511811023622

You can maybe read the comments of the first season and then decide if it's worth the buy. At the most, you buy season one, then read the comments for season 2 and decide if it's worth purchasing. After that, you're cut. So if people are writting comments here, it is because they want to discuss their views of the final. So let's do so.

SPOILER ALERT (you're warned):

I'm not quite sure i got it. Can i explain to you all what i think happened? Then you can tell me if i'm ""lost""?

So... the characters had their lives before. A life filled with despair. Then, as children, they were chosen and touched by Jacob to become candidates to protect an island that is really a cork that keeps Hell from invading Earth (Jacob said so to Richard). Then, as adults, They crashed on that island. They lived through all those surreal events and some of them died on that island. Some others left and died a natural death in their back-to-normal life. And some of them returned to the island, became the new protector and died maybe hundred of years after. The island finally went to the bottom of the sea (as seen in episode one of this last season). Point is, they ALL died at some point. Then, they all went to purgatory and wandered around until they all figured out that they were in fact in purgatory, the character of Desmond being the one to see all that and reunite them all. The lives they lived in that purgatory is the alternate life we see during season 6, right? Then, Jack, the natural leader of the candidates, dies and they can all gather and go to Heaven, except Ben who still needs to make amends (cause that is the role of purgatory).

Is that it? Did i get it right?

At first, i thought they were all dead from the very beginning. When Jack opened his eyes at the start of season one, he was in purgatory. That explained the magical aspects of the island. And we didn't really need closure on every little detail cause it was purgatory anyway. And at the end, jack realises that he's dead, comes to accept it and goes back to the beginning and closes his eyes. I know now that this is not it. But i do wonder whay he sees the plane flying by.

But if my second theory is right, the first one i told you that is, it then means that the magical side of the island is real. Then it is a bit disappointing to not have all the answers. Then maybe yes, the writters did in fact stretched the story a bit too far without being able to come full circle with all their narrative devices.

Nevermind that.

It's easy to see that they knew all along where they were going. It was the souls of the characters that were ""lost"". The adventures they lived together defined their lives. And Jack was their natural leader. So when they all died, they waited for him in order to go to Heaven. Even if it meant waiting in purgatory for thousand of years.

Yeap. This is one heck of a TV series. One that will enrich lots of winter nights with discussions. Don't just bother to buy season 6. Buy them all!

Now, i don't feel ""lost"" anymore.

It has an energy pool at it's core strong enough to create a severe dimensional distortion, not strong enough to be a black hole however, but powerful enough to alter space-time linearity and/or perception of it and make it invisible to the more stable linear energy field of our world. Regarding the origin of the island I can only say that it could be Atlantian in nature or that the energy core of it was created at the time of the universe's Big-Bang and it crystalized into an island on our planet over cosmic eons purely out of quantum probability (in other words: it has existed since to beginning of known time). The energy core allows access to space-time dimensions of higher simmetry, therefore reversing dimensional entropy and approaching the infinity factor which in religion is also called God. The higher simmetry is also a unifying constant that makes all experienced separation become one again and cancelling out all fluctuations. Perhaps civilization came from it and the island allowed intelligent life on this planet (2001 space odissey anyone?).

the ""great twist finale"" was when you realize that you already saw the writers BEST efforts in season 1 and a few spatterings in early season 2 and brushed thinly through 3 4 and 5. Season 6 is almost it's own show. Largely independent of everything you have witnessed through seasons 1 through 5.

The Season 6 tv promos could literally say: ""Forget what you know about LOST... because we're tossing 95% of what you think you know, RIGHT DOWN THE IRRELEVANCE CRAPPER""

the ending works for an episode of Twilight Zone or Outer Limits... But the ""Lost Finale"" was more like a 2.5 hour awakening that the writers were bluffing the whole time.

""The End"" didn't best serve the imagination of the shows FANTASTIC reality. It merely tied neat little pink bows on all the characters, and sent them down the ""Happy Bubbles Brook"".

Fight Club, 12 Monkeys, Memento, SAW (just the first one), Arlington Road, Shawshank Redemption, The Number 23, etc...are examples of a ""superbly written journey""

Writers that know where they are going and writing to that end.
be coy... be clever... be mysterious... be withholding... keep some secrets to your grave...bend and twist reality to stretch, confuse and make us think...
BUT stay on a veiled target so when the audience looks back they are rewarded with a hindsight perspective that makes them want to rewatch the series immediately.

...but it takes no genius to craft the meaningless rabbit trails and the mediocre ending that we were offered to appease our LOST appetite.

I just CAN'T believe the SAME writers - that took me (via a plane crash) to a mysterious hatch, on an ancient hidden island, inhabited by an esoteric tribe of people from a 1970's-era-physiological/scifi/hyper-classified research bunker that was studying a ""SECRET SOMETHING""  so incredible, that makes TIME and SPACE itself, bend to it's awesome mystical power... - gave me such a convoluted vanilla-flavored ""Disney Cartoon"" ending...",1274745600,51,2141,4.9415041782729805

For a start, many questions have been answered throughout the final series, although they were brief answers, but thinking about it, how else could they do it? They've spent six seasons building up the answers, thats good enough for me.
The ending was a commentary on society, in fact the whole lost saga was. The ending summed it up beautifully, and I hope those who see it as a cop out soon realise that it wasn't. Tbh I didn't really care about the answers, I cared more about the relationships that had been built up over the years.

Season 6 dives into the what-if and explores the lives of our oceanic 815 survivors through flash-sideways. It was a unique opportunity to see how much the characters would change and how they would come in contact with each other if 815 never crashed. Personally every episode with the exception of ""What Kate Does"" was awesome in that characters were given the chance to address their many flaws and finally let go of their hang-ups. I think what many people fail to grasp is that Lost has always been a character study about the human condition and all the sci-fi stuff was a way to explore that subject. In the grand scheme of things the mythology, polar bears, electromagnetism, etc. was never the point it was about people, humanity in general. Like Carlton and Lindelof have stated in the past they spent 10% of their time talking about mythology and the other 90% was spent talking about their characters in the writer's room. So if you want to see a show about character pay-off then this is the show for you. As for the series finale, it does not suck like many have explicitly stated.

What the end showed us was that it was the journey and the friendships/relationships formed by these people that were of true importance over the past six seasons, and NOT THE MINUTIA OF THE PLOT!!! Just like LIFE. In the end, when we die, is it going to be important what jobs we held, what our income we had, what kind of car we drove?  No, it's going to be about who we loved and the things we did for other people to help them or change their lives in some way that will truly matter. That is what Lost is to me. . . a meditation on the meaning of life. Now, I'm not particularly religious or even spiritual but I do believe that we are on this planet to make connections with others.

This show could not have ended any better, as a fan who watched the show ever since the first episode, I was very much satisfied with the ending. From the VERY beginning of the show, the writers said they would not tell us what the island was and would not explain EVERY ONE of the strange things happen on it; and yet, that seems to be the only thing everybody on here cares about. Contrary to popular belief, MANY mysteries were solved throughout this season (from the ""whispers"" to the meaning behind ""the numbers"", just to name a few). I'm not exactly sure what people wanted to get out of the ending of this show, it ended the best possible way, seriously. Do you want everything spelled out for you completely?? George Lucas tried to ""explain things"" completely with the Star Wars prequels, and you know how those turned out (midichlorians?)...

Season 5 I barely bothered to watch and now we have the final episode that was a terrible cop out.

The producers swore to us that they were not dead and then they give us this ending that totally ignored all the good story work from the previous seasons including Walt that was supposed to be special and DHARMA to name a couple of really interesting avenues they failed to explore or explain. Considering they claimed to know how the program was going to end when they first started writing it I have to wonder where it all went wrong, it sure felt like they rushed to wrap it in the last two episodes after a season of dull uninteresting jumps in every direction except the right one.

Well, I'm not one of them.
The attempts made, to tie up loose ends are often rather funny than revealing. It's more an: ""Hm, ok. This one is officially solved now."" instead of an: ""Oh my god! NOW I understand! Everything is making sense now!"", which I would have preferred. Ok, they had tossed so many stuff in so many different directions, that it probably would have been naive to assume, they'd come up with a really good explanation for everything. The problem is, that the main and most important questions were not answered.
I must admit though I was quite surprised on how fairly the ending seemed to develop (at that point I had already let go of the hope for more solved mysteries) until they pulled Christian out of the box! This fact and the ridiculous explanation he gave, really pulled it all down. In my opinion this was a severe mistake. Without that, the ending would have been not especially satisfying but acceptable.

My conclusion: It was great to watch the show under the assumption that one will eventually be able to look behind the curtain of the island. If you don't feel betrayed by the denial of that, enjoy the final season.

4077714,1,B0036EH3X4,"Quite possibly the most disappointing ending possible for what appeared, up until the end of the fifth season, to be a very deep and interesting show.  The finale never answered basic question at the heart of the show--what is the island--which is a major strike against any series that is essentially a mystery.

Instead, the writers do not bother to explain anything about the island, and essentially allow ""Magic"" to explain the whole series.  It is no surprise, therefore, that so many people have latched on to the whole island is some sort of purgatory as an explanation--at least that makes sense of the past six seasons of the show.

I can say without hesitation, that while up until this season Lost was a fascinating journey of discovery, this season does nothing but establish that the whole journey was pointless.  Is the message that ""the most important people in your life are those who happen to be around you when you die""?  Or that ""some mystical glowwy cave is responsible for everything, but we won't tell you what it is.""  No matter how you slice it, this entire season was nothing but sappy for no reason.  No matter the interpretation the entire sideways universe is nothing but a big ""what if,"" because it is clearly established that whatever happened there wasn't real and/or didn't matter, resulting in over half of this season wasted from the get go.  I highly recommend that anyone interested in this series, or a fascinating mystery either look elsewhere, or pretend that this show was canceled at the end of season 5.",1274659200,30,1546,4.7819548872180455
4077715,1,B0036EH3X4,"The final episode of the series was such a huge letdown to me that I have no plans to purchase this DVD like I have done with other series I love that tell a story over several seasons. I loved LOST from the  beginning and kept watching while some of my friends stopped as it got confusing for them.

When the final season started I was finding myself not liking some of the story lines as much, basically feeling this final season, to me, is the weakest. But the final episode answers no questions. Why was the Island special? Why did he turn into the smoke monster? Was it all a dream? Were they all dead?

I'm trying to say very little because if you are going to watch it then I'm not going to ruin it for you. All I can say is I feel cheated. Good acting and good writing made me want to know what happened to these people and sadly I was left with questions, not answers.

If the final episode was pitched to the network when they pitched the show, the show never would have aired. Or at least so I feel.

I have no reason to want to watch the whole series again when I know the ending is so......unending.

Enough said. If you liked the final episode then we disagree.",1274659200,33,1175,4.154185022026431
