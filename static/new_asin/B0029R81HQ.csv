8358103,5,B0029R81HQ,"I had known of Bill Plympton years ago, having seen the Tune broadcast on a cable network. What I wasn't prepared for was Bill in person at the 2009 San Diego Comicon. After perusing through his books and several of his other DVD's, I was convinced of two things; his imagination has taken over him completely, and the guy is a certifiable genius as an animator. Nothing more needs to be said. Oh yes, one more thing, I was so impressed, I bought one of his color pieces for my home, and have the intention to buy more, hell, I'll probably paper my walls with them!",1266796800,2,565,4.339622641509434
