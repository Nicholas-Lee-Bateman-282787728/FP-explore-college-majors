8185314,4,B000OIV55C,"This video shows the fascinating plant and animals of Israel, many of which are mentioned in the Bible. There are birds such as storks, the caracal, a wild desert cat much like the lynx, and antelopes such the ibex.  Plant life includes the many flowers which bloom in the Negev Desert. And finally, there's the very hostile environment of the Dead Sea, the ultimate challenge of survival for any species.

This video from Time-Life is a very well photographed episode of Nature, which unfortunately is not yet available on DVD.",1211932800,,528,4.855555555555555
