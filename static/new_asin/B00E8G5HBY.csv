5895517,5,B00E8G5HBY,This is a hilarious college movie on par if not better than Animal House.  Great acting by Piven and others.  A must see if you love Animal House.,1401494400,3,146,4.178571428571429
5895518,5,B00E8G5HBY,"The best college movie ever.

Period.

Yes, I've seen Animal House.

PCU is a wonderful satire of how stupid being overly politically correct is and how it's a huge negative for the value of colleges in America. And it does this while entertaining you with meat tossing, George Clinton, and with a decisive explanation of why majoring in a 5000 year old dead language is stupid.",1398297600,8,378,4.696969696969697
5895519,5,B00E8G5HBY,It took me forever to find this movie on DVD! It just isn't the same with the good parts taken off and with commercials on some random cable channel. This is one of my favorite movies and it made my day that I found it!!!,1488240000,,221,3.933333333333333

5895524,5,B00E8G5HBY,"This is the Animal House of the 90s.  Not quite as epic, but especially today you should watch it.  It seemed silly at the time all the lefty PC groups, but as 22 years have shown, it was a warning of the whiny safe spacer types that infest our society today.",1474156800,7,259,4.0588235294117645
5895525,5,B00E8G5HBY,"""Well, here's all you need to know. Classes: nothing before eleven. Beer: it's your best friend, you drink a lot. Women? You're a freshman, so it's pretty much out of the question.""",1473724800,,181,4.6875

5895547,4,B00E8G5HBY,"I used to watch this movie when I was a kid and it is still pretty funny. It is your typical college frat movie. Beer, parties, women, and rebellion against authority. George Clinton and P Funk are in this movie so that is a bonus if you like funk. For the price it is a good buy.",1422316800,,280,3.9298245614035086
