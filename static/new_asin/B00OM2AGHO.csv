Jase takes his oldest son on a frog hunt the night before he graduates and Jep, Korri, Jess, and Miss Kay decide to roll his house. Jep and Jess's oldest daughter goes on her first date at a mini golf curse and Jep tries to scare the boy away, at the end Jep ends up liking the kid. Willie thinks about changing the duck commander logo, witch doesn't happen. Phil tries to help one of his granddaughters with a school project and gets the guys together for a beaver hunt. One quick thought when using dynamite ALWAYS remember the safety fews. Alan makes more appearance this season. duck commander gets a award from the governor of Louisiana. Willie go to a karate class with his daughter Bella and gets his but kicked by a little girl. And this season we celebrate a birthday with Missy and Willie, guess how got the better gift from Jase.",1430784000,,974,4.477528089887641
