8241533,5,B0011E6X96,I love this DVD.  Hal is so funny and I want more from Hal in DVD.  Hal is great. I recommend this to anyone who love comedy.,1281052800,,125,3.5925925925925926
8241534,5,B0011E6X96,"I am lucky to have seen Hal at Cobb's live, not this night but one since then.
My sides hurt for days from laughing and my cheeks from smiling...
Hal has a unique take on the world.
He choses to educate himself on everything he finds interesting, be that politics, music, motivation, lgbt rights.
Then he puts his spin on it, adds a flair that not only makes you laugh, but can often have you reach an epiphany.
His comedy is not nasty, but intelligent and rather physical.
I have played my copy to quite a few folks and each of them now loves Hal.
Come join us :)
Thanks Hal, for being you!",1272585600,3,591,4.192982456140351
8241535,5,B0011E6X96,"If you haven't seen Hal Sparks live this is the second best way to introduce you to his wildly physical, manic comedic presence live (the first being going out to see him live in a comedy club near you).  He's a marathoner, both vocally and physically, making you tired just watching him!  But the exhaustion also comes from how much he makes you laugh.  While I've loved his TV presence in such appearances as his stint on ""Talk Soup,"" his well-known hilarious cameo on the ""Frasier"" sitcom (among many other TV guest appearances), and his extensive, terrific, and affecting work as Michael on ""Queer as Folk,""  seeing Hal performing live is the best way to really get a full picture of his talent.  Highly recommended.",1227916800,6,720,4.728
8241536,5,B0011E6X96,"If there was one thing Hal Sparks was born to do, it's stand up comedy.  In ""Escape from Halcatraz"" he takes us on a wild ride through many topics with intelligence, wit and almost manic energy.

Recorded in front of San Francisco audience at Cobb's Comedy club, the crowd responds enthusiastically to Hal's take on theme songs, baseball, NASCAR and sexually frustrated dinosaurs.

Consider what you've seen on his VH1 commentary or Talk Soup, and turn it up.  Nothing prepares you for what lays ahead once Hal takes the stage.

Also included on the DVD is an insightful commentary on how he developed his act, as well as some footage of Hal's interaction with the fans, something he's known to do after every show.

If you ever get a chance to see Hal live, you definitely should (his calendar is available on his official website).  But in the meantime, you can get your fix of his comedy whenever you want with ""Escape from Halcatraz"".",1207526400,8,938,4.682926829268292
