8561117,2,B00B1UE7C0,"First the soundtrack/audio is bad... secondly, the camera/work is also bad... zooming in and out in a jerking motion and suddenly.

After that if you are still watching... the dvd is not performed in a traditional teaching style format/ lacking continuity of thought.  Thus we found we quickly lost interest especially while she was dealing with an alleged client whom you could not clearly hear the exchange of their conversation.

Just ... overall not good.  We slso tried on several occasions to contact her at her given phone numbers and she never answers and never returns her phone messages.  Yet she encourages you to contact her???

Obviously this person seems to be only interested in the $ that can be brought in from her DVD's and not in truly helping others.  There are better representations out there with practitioners who are serious about helping other people.",1378857600,11,877,4.965753424657534
