7799593,4,1591793084,"Enjoyed the very thorough instruction. Instructor seems quite knowledgable and descriptive instruction were very good. Not meant to be a workout, more of an educational DVD however the movements could be learned from this DVD and a motivated person could create/memorize movements and workout on own.",1501718400,5,300,5.543478260869565

7799596,5,1591793084,"I enjoyed this DVD set and found it informative as well as instructive. The standing meditations work as I felt a lot of energy in my hands when I did the preparation meditation stances (energy pulses in my hands when I do energy work and sometimes when I'm in altered states of consciousness). For me this DVD set was worth the price just for the standing meditations as I like moving meditations and I really felt the energy. Ken Cohen explains everything well and has a scholarly, but easy air. There are sample videos of Ken Cohen at YouTube and a few cuts from this DVD set if you are interested in seeing samples and trying some stances. The DVD is well organized and has a nice progression from the preparation stances for Qi Gong healing to the basic healing/sensing techniques to more advanced sensing or energy diagnostic techniques. I wouldn't use the technique of holding a finger and sensing the associated organs as I feel energy when I pass my hands over patient bodies, but perhaps some may find they prefer this method. I really enjoyed this Qi Gong healing DVD set and I will recommend it to those who are interested in Qi Gong and energy work. It has made me curious to learn more about Qi Gong and Chinese subtle body systems.",1319587200,22,1246,4.542222222222223
7799597,5,1591793084,"Qi Healing from Ken Cohen is a great buy! I have studied ""many"" healing modalities from around the world and find thus far that Qigong will stay in my arsenal! In Ken's DVD's here, I like how informative he is and for beginners, you will find that he goes over the postures in detail making it easy to learn and follow along! Also easy to navigate the DVD's with the detailed Chapter Selection to find specific info or postures.

I like that I can now see from studying around 5 other veterans of Qigong/Neigong that stance, building up your own storage of chi (Dan tian) and nerve system to allow More chi to flow through you...is the bottom line or essence along with holding the space of Love while projecting chi to the client/partner. (Long sentence)
Being grounded (power stance and feet feeling rooted in the ground)and continuously breathing 100% of the time during a healing session is part of the whole key here!!

Neigong then Qigong are the oldest healing movements known to man. Of course there are others that came afterwards (Huna, Reiki, Quantum Touch...)and I have studied those as well. I do incorporate the others as well, but my root practice is definitely Qigong/Neigong.
Namaste:)",1198972800,37,1202,4.774038461538462
