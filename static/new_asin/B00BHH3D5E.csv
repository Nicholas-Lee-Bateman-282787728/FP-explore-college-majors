5621237,5,B00BHH3D5E,This is a great dvd!  The instructor shows how to do every exercise correctly and includes stretching. I had no problems with it not playing in my player.,1376870400,2,154,4.5
5621238,5,B00BHH3D5E,"Kettlercise is an amazing work-out! Be prepared to sweat. This type of work-out combines cardio and weight training without a bunch of bouncing around and contorting your body into weird positions. It is pretty straightforward and easy to learn. If you are new to exercising or Kettlebell work-outs, I would recommend a fairly light weight because that bell gets heavy after a while.",1372032000,3,383,5.095238095238095
5621239,1,B00BHH3D5E,I ordered these to try and have been unsuccessful so far.  Both DVD players I own must not be region free.  I own older Magnavox and newer dual Samsung player.  Neither one would play it.  Something like this should be mentioned in the item description.,1369612800,3,253,4.555555555555555
5621240,4,B00BHH3D5E,"I was a little disappointed it says that it is All Regions DVD so I thought it would play in all DVDs.  I guess I was wrong.  So to do this workout I have to use my laptop which isn't always the most convenient or buy a different DVD.  The workout is effective.  It's nothing fancy, pretty straight forward.  There isn't a bunch of cheerleading or ranting just do the workout in minute sets.  My legs are shaking and my arms and abs are burning.  I don't know how I will feel later today but for right now I feel like it was ok.  I will say that I don't feel completely maxed as I could still go for a run but my muscles have been used differently than I would have on my own so the instruction is a good guide.  I'd do the workout again.",1367280000,,738,3.9659863945578233
5621241,1,B00BHH3D5E,"I purchased this after seeing it advertised in Oxygen magazine,as I'm always looking for fun kettlebell routines. When I tried to use it,it would not play  in my DVD player and I have since seen reviews that other purchasers had the same issue. Apparently,you need a geographically correct DVD player,which was not stated anywhere in the decscription of this set,so now I have to go through the hassle of returning this.",1366675200,12,420,4.915492957746479
5621242,4,B00BHH3D5E,"I read Khezla Durr's review (Aprill 17), stating it was not a region-free dvd.  I was going to cancel my order but found it was already shipped.  When it came, I decided to risk it and the dvd played in my Phillips dvd player.  When I tried in a different dvd player, it didn't play.  So apparently, I own a region-free player and didn't realize it.  So it is true, the dvd is NOT region-free; however, it also played on my laptop computer.

The first dvd of the set has an introduction (kettlebell size, etc.), a thorough introduction to each exercise (37 in all), and recommendations on exercise group schedules.  The second dvd has the three different exercise groups (full body, abs, and express).  The background music is electronic/techno; fortunately, it doesn't overwhelm the instructor.  The instructor has two participants in the background; one will do a modified version of the exercise for the `less-athletic' person.

Complaints:  1-The above-mentioned region problem.  2-The recommendation of using a light (4 kg-10 lb) size.  3-Shoes-According to experts, a person should wear flats or go barefoot (to avoid extra cushion so your feet will keep balance); the women were using regular athletic shoes.  4-Each dvd has a brief advertising moment for a British vitamin/herbal supplement company.

I recommend the dvd set if you have a regionfree dvd player (or laptop computer).",1366502400,8,1390,5.061674008810573
5621243,4,B00BHH3D5E,"Luckily I already had a region free dvd player but if you don't you will have to buy one to play these 2 dvds.  Liked the little clock in the upper right of the screen, all exercises are timed instead of counting reps.  Did not like the fact that I could not turn off the ""music.""  If you turn off the audio it also turns off the instruction, they don't have voice and music separated.  Good instruction.  They recommend a very light kettlebell approx 5-8 lbs for ladies and the reason why is because they go so fast, they alternate upper and lower body exercises without any break.  You may need to pause the dvd to catch your breath.  They get right down to it and don't waste your time.  There is a regular 50 minute workout and an 8 minute abs workout and an express workout of 20 minutes before they add on the abs and cooldown so with that it runs 30 minutes.  They also have it where you can put the dvd into your computer to print off a pdf of the recommended schedule for beginner, intermediate or advanced of what workouts you should do and how frequently so that is a nice touch.  The lady teaches the express workout and the man does the instruction and the introduction.  I was exhausted after just watching the express workout and haven't viewed the full length one yet but this all looks pretty good to me.  Quick pace, they are doing it like aerobic weight training and circuit style because of alternating between upper and lower body.  Recommend.",1366156800,5,1464,4.397769516728625
