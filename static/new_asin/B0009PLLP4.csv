8174535,2,B0009PLLP4,"I recently purchased this and found some problems with it. Apparently, St. Clair Vision cannot afford to restore any films on their DVDs. Some of the Laurel and Hardy solos are good, but the technology is available to restore these films. The Buster Keaton films are of poor, grainy quality and feature inadequate music. They look like they were transferred from a VHS tape. Swing Parade abruptly stops in the middle of the DVD and shuts my DVD player down. The ""stunt reels"" are just clips pulled together from films already on these discs. The 4 three stooges Columbia shorts are released often and can be found, fully restored on The Three Stooges Collection DVDs, which I own. The General, College, and Steamboat Bill, jr can be found in better quality on the Keaton DVDs released by Kino. I am a fan of all of these comedians, but better quality and better presentation will be found elsewhere. Dont waste your money on this.",1334966400,2,930,4.711656441717792
8174536,3,B0009PLLP4,"The SLAPSTICK GREATS Movie Pack offers several public domain 3 Stooges shorts on one disc, three Buster Keaton silent features on another and Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy two-reelers (made prior to their teaming up) on the third. The only exceptions where Stan & Ollie appear as a duo are a cameo in THE STOLEN JOOLS and their only color movie, a PSA short for the Dept. of Agriculture.

Two of Keaton's greatest works are here, which alone are worth the price of this box set. THE GENERAL is an unparalleled classic, while STEAMBOAT BILL, JR. has Keaton's most famous stunt of all in it (the falling wall).

The early Laurel/Hardy shorts here are poorly preserved. The solo piano used as backing for most of them is dubbed from a scratchy LP, and the ""bonus"" stunt reel is rehashed excerpts from these old clunkers. Their home movies are mostly Stan's amateur photography of children at a birthday party-- it's rather boring, frankly.

The Stooges are always entertaining, as evidenced by the four well-circulated shorts in this collection. Additionally we have a 1949 TV pilot the boys made (for a show that was never picked up) and a music-filled feature Moe, Larry and Curley co-starred in (watch for Louis Jordan, Will Osborne and other musical luminaries in this).
