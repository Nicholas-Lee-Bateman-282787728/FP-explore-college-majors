7810807,3,6301320336,"Volume five in Star Trek: The Animated Series is a real mixed bag.  The first episode 'The Magicks Of Megus-Tu' is an episode that hardcore Trekkies point to as proof that the animated shows weren't a bona-fide part of the Star Trek canon.  The story is quite silly even by the standards of a Saturday morning cartoon.  Journeying to the center of the galaxy on a scientific expedition the Enterprise crew meet up with an alien named Lucien who appears in the form of a satyr.  He rescues the crew from certain death and then transports Kirk, Spock & McCoy to a realm where he demonstrates extraordinary magical powers.  Lucien runs afoul of the Megans, the supremely powerful beings of Megus-Tu, because he has used his magic and brought humans into their realm.  The Megans then put Lucien and the entire Enterprise crew on trial, one that looks remarkably similar to the Salem witch trials we've often seen depicted.  Spock first comes to the defense of the humans and then Kirk is forced to come to Lucien's defense when he is condemned to spend eternity alone in a void.  Oh and by the way it turns out that Lucien is actually the demon referred to in Christian theology as Lucifer!  Yeah, don't say you weren't warned!  The story has little to do with the type of hard science fiction that Star Trek normally deals with and seems more fantasy than anything else.  Also, the Enterprise successfully makes it to the center of the universe - and not a sign of Sha-Ka-Ree!  (That's a reference to the Star Trek theatrical feature 'The Final Frontier' for all you Trek neophytes)

The second episode on the tape 'The Time Trap' is considerably better.  The Enterprise is sent to an area of space known as the Delta Triangle where several starships have mysteriously disappeared without a trace.  Their arrival is precipitated by the Klingons who are also investigating the same mystery.  The Klingon Bird Of Prey fires upon the Enterprise and when the crew returns fire the Klingon's ship vanishes into thin air (or space that is).  Immediately another pair of Klingon warships descends upon the Enterprise and to escape them they travel to the spot of the Bird Of Prey's disappearance and soon find themselves in a sort of netherspace where thousands of vessels are in suspended orbit.  Both Kirk and Kor, the captain of the Klingon Bird Of Prey, are brought to a room where they are introduced to 'The Council'.  The two captains are told they are trapped in this limbo, which they refer to as Elysia, where time has no meaning and that their weapons are powerless.  Initially they reluctantly accept the circumstances but later Kirk convinces the council to allow him to try and affect an escape by combining forces with the Klingons and their ship.  The Klingons agree to help but, quite naturally, have nefarious plans of their own which Kirk and the Enterprise narrowly elude.

'The Time Trap' is one of the excellent examples of what the Saturday morning show could do that the original series could not have done.  The budget simply couldn't have handled all the demands for production as seen here.  First, there is 'The Council' in the limbo.  It consisted of aliens from several species including the familiar Vulcans, Orions, Romulans, Andorians and even the Gorn.  There are even more alien species pictured besides those named.  Then there is the depiction of all the varieties of starships trapped inside the limbo. This episode wouldn't have worked nearly as well on the original series as it did here.  Unquestionably due to costs all of those scenes would have been cut or reduced to something much less interesting to look at.  Also the dialogue contained in this particular story is notably more competent than other entries in the animated series.  It isn't nearly as 'dumbed-down' as some of the episodes were unfortunately forced to do so that they would have enough appeal to a Saturday morning audience.  If 'The Time Trap' had a knock against it that would have to be the Delta Triangle itself.  Back in 1973 when this show was produced the Bermuda Triangle was a world-wide sensation.  Naturally, many television shows cashed in on this cult phenomenon and Star Trek it seems wasn't able to bow out of this trend.  It doesn't matter as the message in the story isn't hampered by this dated reference.

My 3 star rating for this VHS tape might not seem generous but in the interests of clarification I gave the first episode only a star because it's just too silly and ridiculous; the second episode gets five stars as it is one of the superior stories done for the Saturday morning series.",1101686400,3,4617,4.757537688442211
7810808,5,6301320336,"The Magick's of Megastu episode was written by a Pagan aware author, and is NOT evil, but in fact a well done introduction to the Craft for  beginners... It is NOT about Satan... Witches do NOT believe in Satan. This  episode was a pioneer work that broke new ground for Witches and Pagans at  a time when both were (and are) mis-understood and mis-characterized by a  number of forces and institutions in the world. Combining the subject with  Star Trek and it's inherent ability to help break taboo subjects to the  public was a stroke of pure genius.
For it's time, it was a gutsy move by  the network to show it, and it is a misunderstood piece of work, and it was  time someone set the record straight. Magicks of Megastu also was turned  into a book that I believe you can find on Amazon. The story is engaging,  and an enjoyable read. It was my very first introduction to the Craft, and  is a story I am very fond of, as it helped to make me the Witch that I am  now.
I give it extremely high marks and am happy to own the tape and  book.
Blessed Be! AJ",966902400,3,1060,4.188118811881188
7810809,1,6301320336,The weekest of the 11 volumes. I erased the first episode showing satan as a misunderstood alien. The second one is only ok. A bad link to a great cartoon series.,953337600,3,162,4.258064516129032
