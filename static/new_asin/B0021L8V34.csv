3834970,3,B0021L8V34,"I really enjoyed the movie, although it had a fair amount of gore.  I thought it had a decent storyline and decent CGI.  The acting by  Paul Bettany was strong and is what actually held the movie together.  He portrayed Archangel Michael.  Dennis Quaid was really just a ""name"" filler.  While Dennis had a part through most of the picture, it was only as background.

This was an apocalyptic film.  The basic premise is that God is tired of the Earth humans trashing the Earth and each other with wars, killing, etc.  God calls his army of angels together, led by Archangels Gabriel and Michael, and tells them to go down to Earth and kill us all.  Gabriel orders Michael to kill the unborn baby of a certain girl, because this baby represents hope to mankind.  Michael is torn between God's order and Michael's own love for mankind.  Although many humans are not behaving as God wants, Michael still sees a few good and loving people who will not give up.  So Michael decides he will give God what He NEEDS, not what He says He WANTS.  Michael descends to protect the pregnant girl and ensure the baby is born.

The story begins with Michael leaping down to earth on December 23 at about 1 a.m..  Shortly after that, he cuts off his wings, grabs a whole bunch of guns and ammo.  Confronted by 2 police officers, he tells them, ""It's starting.  There isn't much time.""  After a brief negative encounter, Michael heads off in the police car, which the officers no longer need. (What the heck???)

 We switch to a scene in the California desert.  There is nothing around for miles except a very simplistic diner, called ""Paradise Falls"" owned and operated by Dennis Quaid. His son works there too, as a handyman.  A young girl also works there and lives in a small trailer on the premises.  She is 8 months pregnant by someone who is gone from the picture.  The son is a good and simple soul who is crazy about the girl and wants to take care of her and the baby.

Slowly, a small diverse collection of people begin to make their way to the diner.  As another reviewer said, it would have been nice if the movie had taken a little time to background the people.  No sooner do people get in place than the sky begins to darken.  Then sweet little Granny Packer comes in and turns into the terror from Hell.  She tells the pregnant girl her baby will burn, sinks her pointed teeth into a customer's neck, and climbs up the wall.  You cannot help but cheer as the cook bounces a frying pan off her head!

As a couple of people try to get help for the injured customer, they see thousands of flies everywhere (yuk) and cannot drive.  Everyone is stuck at the diner when Michael arrives and tells them that we are ""running out of time"" (as if Granny Packer wasn't a clue.)  He explains that the last time God lost faith in man, he sent a flood.  Shortly after that, the group has to begin fighting zombie creatures that were once human, but ain't no more!

This movie is NOT for children, because of the gore and because of the message that God would send his angels to destroy humanity.  Although I do not believe that my God is vengeful and I do not see my favorite angels, Gabriel and Michael, ever in this kind of role, I enjoyed the movie as pure FICTION, although I would never have written the story line this way. I guess it is an attempt to tell people to wake up and act right before you lose it all.  Regardless of what you believe about God, I think almost everyone will agree that the human race is not acting in a way that ensures its continued existence.

I enjoyed the first time but would I watch it a second time?  Probably not.  Note: I did buy the DVD for my 37 year old son and he has watched it several times already.",1264291200,34,3732,4.342981186685963
3834971,3,B0021L8V34,"First off, I don't think I'm totally insane yet, so let me defend my three star review (actually 2 and 1/2 if I was allowed it). Legion is as close to bad as a movie can be, yet I found enough little things to enjoy along the way. If you go in expecting a bigger than usual budget B movie, you will probably feel the same way I did leaving the theater. It is so silly and poorly written at times, but it is done with so much seriousness and belief in itself, you can't help but roll your eyes and go along. The cast is filled with a few more recognizable faces than one would expect, but I felt that Paul Bettany was easily the best of the bunch. Like everyone else, he isn't given great dialogue or much character depth, but he is a good enough actor to pull this part off. He has a sort of conviction in his voice that elevates his believability factor. Plus, it is cool seeing him an action role for a change. Dennis Quaid just seems to be just cashing in another check like he did with G.I. Joe: Rise of the Cobra and Pandorum (a slightly better film). The CGI isn't too bad, but the action is lacking anything worth remembering. The story is thin and easy to follow, though it seems to combine elements from too many movies.

Legion is good enough at being bad that I wouldn't mind watching it again on DVD some rainy day. Oh, let's not forget the most memorable character. A grandma looking like a Golden Girls casting reject who cusses out a woman, bites half of a dude's neck off, crawls all over the ceiling, gets her neck broken by a frying pan thrown through the air and still comes back for more. Who writes this stuff?

2 and 1/2 out of 5 stars",1264204800,10,1657,4.175
3834972,5,B0021L8V34,"This movie has a lot of violence and gore, however it has a phenomenal message at the end.  The story is about an angel (a general in God's army) that is sent by God to perform a certain task.  He goes against God's instructions stating that he is doing what God needs, not what God wants.  He becomes a protector of the being in which the angels are sent to destroy.  This puts him in the line of fire as well.  I can't say more since it would ruin the ending for those that have not seen it, but I assure you that it has a truly wonderful message.

There are some slow parts in the movie, but I really enjoyed it.  I would highly recommend it.",1264204800,2,645,4.031496062992126
3834973,3,B0021L8V34,"Most of the time the trailers shown before the actual film indicate the type of film the audience is about to see.  Prior to the viewing of ""Legion"" the new apocalyptic film directed by Scott Stewart, a medley of blood-filled horror and fast-car action sequences erupted on the big screen offering the usual fare meant to tantalize 17 to 30 year-olds everywhere.  However, ""Legion"" albeit filled with much killing and scores of hideous zombies, does have a bit of a plot line with the potential for introspective moments that would have played better as a three-night six-hour mini-series rather than a less than two-hour cinema presentation.

The mini-series venue would have given this story time to develop along the lines of William Inge's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bus-Stop/dp/B000059GEJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bus Stop</a>"" where a group of people congregate at a diner in the middle of nowhere, make connections and find things out about themselves.  ""Legion"" follows a similar game plan, however, the encroaching doom that clones a Terminator series of events from almost the opening credits (the empty playground swings are shown in ominous desolation) accelerates the action and leaves little time for the cast of players marooned in a woe begotten truck stop to come to any great revelations regarding their lives' mistakes.

But what if the characters had the running time of Stephen King's ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Stand/dp/B00006AUIN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Stand</a>""?  What if besides the special effects of the zombies and their attack on the humans, there was more time to concentrate on the angels and their motivation and the humans and their histories?  The battle between good and evil would rage on with some interesting epiphanies and revelations notwithstanding with maybe some apocalyptic quotes from the Bible thrown in to satisfy the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Da-Vinci-Code-Widescreen-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B00005JOC9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Da Vinci Code (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;type fans.

Like the Terminator robot in the first two&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Terminator/dp/B000OPOAM0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Terminator</a>&nbsp;films, Angel Michael is thrust to earth and catapults into action.  Now Paul Bettany (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Young-Victoria/dp/B001C4AFOY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Young Victoria</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Beautiful-Mind/dp/B000FVQLQQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Beautiful Mind</a>) isn't as funny as Schwartzenegger, but he plays the Archangel Michael with a serious determination that underlines his strength.  Plus he's just plain nice to look at--especially when he is shown in all his glory, 12-foot wingspan and all.

Charlie, the diner's pregnant waitress, is the Sarah Connor of this tale--the woman whose child will somehow change history.  As a cigarette-smoking mother-to-be whose before apocalypse plan is to put her child up for adoption, Charlie is the Madonna who doesn't want the job in a Bizzaro World twist on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Nativity-Story/dp/B000MGBM1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Nativity Story</a>&nbsp;which again is reminiscent of Terminator.  Jeep is her Joseph--protector and Wise Man.  Dennis Quaid plays Bob, Jeep's father, a Doubting Thomas of sorts who eventually shows that he too is made of finer stuff when push comes to shove. The rest of the cast serves similar purposes.  Even the angel Gabriel heralds the advent with his horn and coerces the masses to 'come let us adore Him.'

Like the ensemble Bus Stop cast, the cast of players here in Legion could have been given their due, but alas their time is too short.  Too much time is spent on the horrific death scenes--nasty old ladies climbing ceilings on all fours, a man erupting with boils that burn off skin and neck-biting seemingly angelic children--and not enough on the little stories behind the diner's inhabitants.  What an interesting mini-series this could have made--but then again, who knows maybe Charlie and Jeep will resurface with the Child and once again the glorious Michael must swoop down and shed a few feathers.

Bottom Line?  ""Legion"" follows the Terminator school of Apocalyptic film.  The key elements are all there to create a scenario where a modern-day savior comes to the forefront after much blood and suffering.  Unfortunately, the film's makers touch on some introspective ground which if tilled would have made a most interesting composite: humans and angels coming together with their stories and motivations to help protect the ideals of hope and faith.  Recommended if you are in the mood for an offbeat Nativity story.

3834974,1,B0021L8V34,"I saw this movie the first day it opened in theaters this movie is god awful, although that phase is ironic considering the theme of the movie. I haven't been this bored in a movie theater I wanted to walk out, but stayed to the end a small part hoped that somehow the direction of this movie would take a turn for the better. It didn't. The most action that was in the movie was pretty much shown during the previews run on television or on the internet. This movie had so many cliches it was unreal. There was the happy cheesy ending...(spoiler alert) everything that was foreshadowed during the whole movie was pretty much all for nothing. One of the main characters was pretty much the classic loser with undying love for the beautiful girl, but she doesnt notice him. Everything he had ever known his whole life (family, friends, work) were all destroyed but it was portrayed that he didn't care because he got to be with the pretty girl and her baby who he's not even the father of (irrelevant), and they're going to journey across the world with no money, a few guns, and his new added confidence (even though in the beginning of the movie he couldn't even shoot an demonic old lady who was about to rip his face off. Sweet boy but not someone you would want with you as back up. The movie wasn't even really about saving a baby it was just supposed to be a traumatic way for the pretty girl to realize that she can be anything or some other bs point they were trying to make.",1264118400,5,1483,4.338129496402877

I was disappointed in this story which begins with Michael cutting his wings off. (Why is never explained). He says he has switched sides and now stands as a defender for a baby that will not be born for another month -- and the mother is a woman who doesn't want the baby, and doesn't seem to know who is the baby's father. The young man in love with this woman is a kind-hearted man largely ignored by the mother. Endless zombie-types show up to attack a diner in the middle of nowhere and bystanders are largely killed off as Dennis Quaid (the diner owner) sucks down alcohol and cooks himself up a steak with total disregard that he has several people sheltering in his diner, including the pregnant woman.

3837621,4,B0021L8V34,"This is one of those movies you watch to hopefully reinforce the fact that humanity is not toally lost in the End of Days!  So with that said the movie bordered sci-fi biblical and was rather a great watch.  Not so purposely accurate by any means to biblical accounts in the fact that Bettany plays arch angel Michael who in real biblical account is the ""Arch Angel"" which means the supreme most powerful angel made by God himself over all angels.  He is sent on a mission to destroy humanity due to their turning their backs on God which as any biblical reader knows has been the reocurrence by the house of Israel since the begining of time.  But instead Bettany has a change of heart and sees that humanity may have a chance and seek favor again in God if he can save them.......so comes Gabriel the angel sent by God to take out Michael.  Well here is where you may have issues if biblically taught, we all know that to be a impossibility since Michael in real life is the most supreme and strongest of all angels.  Gabriel if you remember the birth of Christ went to Mary to tell her of God's plan to give birth to the Messiah.  Well this Gabriel is a bit cocky and boistrous but it is the movies folks...............he is portrayed and in the movie superior to Michael but Michael so to speak gets God's heart on this matter and God seems to give Bettany or Michael the end fight and victory over Gabriel.

So if you can see it for what it is then it is a decent movie.................now it does have some explicit profanity and really while not biblically accurate in most ways, it is a decent ray of hope for humanity.

So enjoy or pass on it..............not much more to say here.",1424390400,,1691,4.376996805111821

3837681,5,B0021L8V34,"Legion is in the line of the Christopher Walken Prophecy movie wherein Gabriel, the angel of trumpet fame, has gone off the heavenly reservation to destroy mankind because God loves man better than angels. Well, in Legion, God has gotten seriously tired of man's B. S. and decided to destroy the human race completely this time--no Noah to the rescue. Michael, an angel, played by Paul Bettany, is sent to make sure a baby doesn't get born because the baby could be the savior of mankind and God wants no savior this time around.. However, he decides the baby should live and he goes against God's orders. At that point the fun begins. I won't give anymore of the plot away but suffice it to say the rest of the movie is a hoot. You've got mankind turned into zombies and sent to make sure the baby dies. You've got angels with razor sharp wings, an old lady with saw like teeth who can walk on the ceiling, and likes her steak blood raw and fly infested. In any event, for those who like their horror based movies imbued with religious themes, a thoroughly pissed off God, the end of the world, brother angels bent on killing each other and spiced with simple  metaphysics and warped physics, then this movie will entertain you. It is something of a cult classic. The actors do their jobs well, playing thoroughly improbable hilarious scenes with a straight face, which of course, makes the whole affair worthwhile.",1420588800,9,1416,4.596837944664031

Bettany is believable as a stoic Michael. Kevin Durand is truly awesomely sinister as a kind but fundamentalist archangel bent on annihilation of mankind. Worth seeing him even if the rest of the movie is only so so. The storytelling and dialogue had some real lapses. Maybe a sequel in consideration at the time. Who knows? To me, worth it what was described in the first line of the review.

One TV series to see if you like this film is the new series on the Sci Fi Channel called Dominion. It is a spinoff of Legion and picks up where Legion leaves off. Even some Christians like this genre because the names of angels in this movie and on Dominion(Sci Fi Channel) are accurate from the Bible and they also mention terms like the ""Apocalypse"" or ""demons"". Demons are angels that refuse to serve Heaven and are transformed into monsters because of their disobedience. Angels are Heaven's military and Michael is the most powerful(he beat Satan in a fight once in the Bible!)

3838085,4,B0021L8V34,"So I did like the movie but I also liked the movie ""The Prophecy"" with Christopher Walken.  Legion is billed as a horror movie but it isn't anywhere near as horror filled as films like ""Nightmare on Elm Street"", ""The Omen"", or The Exorcist"".  The trailer is very misleading, showing the old woman climbing on the ceiling and the ice cream man with the elongating face and arms who screams.  Those were really the best ""demon possessionesque"" scenes in the whole movie.  The movie is more action movie than horror movie.  The star of the film really is Michael, played by Paul Bettany .  Mr. Bettany does an outstanding job portraying a character torn between what he believes is right and what he is supposed to do.  What could have been a serious bomb of a movie is really saved by his beautiful and rather subtle portrayal of Michael. Another outstanding preformance is given by Lucas Black, a young man who is to be the protector of the child due to save humankind.  I've personally loved Lucas Black's acting for years and he does not disappoint in this film.  The most disappointing portrayal was actually by Dennis Quaid.  I thought his acting was a little ""ham handed"" and lacking in nuance compared to the other two actors, and I really like Dennis Quaid as a an actor too.  The movie is really a corny waste of time that gets saved by some unexpected;y outstanding acting, oh and some great action scenes.",1406332800,,1414,4.5936254980079685

So all of humanity depends on some random fetus that his father met his mother in the back of a dumpster somewhere and that is the savior of mankind. Geez... that's allot of pressure on someone that's not even born yet. Already I feel sorry for this kid.
So Gabby and his minions tries to kill them in this old broken down gas station somewhere, but apparently they're in no hurry to kill Rose Marry and her kid. So (plot hole number 1). It supposed to be a war between heaven and hell, so why are angels killing (or trying to) kill people? Well the fallen angel that comes to these people's aid tries to explain that, but dose so very poorly. To sum it up, he say's God's getting tired of humanity so he lets Gabby and his minions do what they want, but then his minions let them go for no reason at all, while this fallen angel fights Gabby. It's as if this story couldn't get any worse, they get away and humanity lives to see another day.
This is pretty much a rehash of the Prophecy, staring Christopher Walken. If you've already seen that movie, then you really don't need to see this one. It's kinda like if you've seen the movie Tomnstone, then you really don't need to see Wyatt Earp.",1405814400,,1283,4.262295081967213

3838125,3,B0021L8V34,"I watched Legion in hopes that some of the missing elements of Dominion, like how all the cities rose, among other topics, would be foretold. But, unfortunately, while we do get a bit of backstory about Michael, Jeep, and Alexs mom, I must admit I am unsure why this, of all movies, was chosen to become a series. However, the question needs to be asked: is this necessarily a bad movie or just one not strong enough to warrant a series?

Characters & Story
In the middle of nowhere is a pregnant mother to be Charlie (Adrianne Palicki) who works at this middle of nowhere diner owned by Bob (Dennis Quaid). A man whose son, Jeep (Lucas Black), works right next door doing automotive work. Joining them in this oddly placed diner is the fry cook Percy (Charles S. Dutton), who we don't learn too much about, and no sign of whoever Charlies baby father is. Though is Jeep had his way, he would step in and be the man Charlie and her baby needs. Which Charlie does appreciate, but seems to not look as a viable option. For not only does she not want Jeep romantically, but she doesnt want the baby either. I mean, she smokes while pregnant!

But, one day, perhaps a month or so before she is due to give birth, what seems like another boring day becomes the eve of the apocalypse. It all begins with this seemingly sweet old lady named Gladys (Jeanette Miller), and then the situation escalates to a horde of lower angels outside Bobs diner. Then two archangels battling it out and wrecking the place. Why you may ask? Well, all over Charlies baby.

Praise

For those who watch Dominion, the sole thing this movie offers is a bit of background behind Jeep as well as help us get to know Alexs mother. Outside of that, this movie does make the Michael and Gabriel on Dominion a bit disappointing. If just because Paul Bettany as Michael, and Kevin Durand as Gabriel, are far more appealing in the roles than their successors on Dominion. Bettany doesnt have Tom Wisdoms weird brooding persona which makes it seem like he wants to be in an Anne Rice movie, but more so belongs in Twilight. Then, as for Durand as Gabriel, there is this actual menacing persona which isn't diluted as he speaks in a sentimental nature when it comes to God or Michael. Unlike Carl Beukes on Dominion.

Criticism

I must note though, when it comes to scenes without Bettany and Durand, I am unsure how this movie made nearly 70 million dollars. For while Quaid and company certainly aren't boring, at the same time the action scenes don't bring anything which makes the film look any better than the show. In fact, with the movie being focused solely in or around the diner, I would argue the pilot of Dominion brings you a much more interesting universe than the movie.

For while we see a young Jeep, Alexs mother Charlie, and even get some flashbacks to this small set which represents heaven, nothing seems to really flesh out the story to the point it makes the movie worth seeing, even if you are a fan of the show. I say this because the story itself is rather shallow and keeps the audience on a need to know basis. Then when it comes to the angels taking over humans, while I did enjoy Millers scenes, and this evil child which came after her, at the same time it felt more campy than scary. Which may have been the point, but at the same time it just seems like the movie is stuck between wanting to be taken seriously and having an almost Zombieland tone without any outright jokes.

Overall: TV Viewing

Im glad I didn't pay for this film because it really does feel underdone for an action movie. For with a shoddy story, rather tame action, and really most of the characters not being all that interesting, I must admit I am tempted to say to skip this. Though if you are a fan of the show which was inspired by this, I think this movie does have some value. Even if it seems like a two hour promo. However, if you have no interest in Dominion I don't think this movie at all will convince you to give the show a chance. And, to be quite honest, this film isn't even good enough to really help me understand why it was turned into a TV series.",1404518400,,4133,4.399214659685864

3838304,2,B0021L8V34,"Forget the misleading image of a ripped avenging angel used to promote director Scott Stewart's ""Legion""; you won't find it anywhere in this cheesy apocalyptic dud.  This poorly written travesty revolves around the archangel Michael, who's been sent by a peeved God to destroy an unborn baby who represents the world's last hope.  (Don't ask why this one child is the world's last hope; screenwriters Stewart and Peter Schink never bother trying to make sense of anything going on.)  Of course, the mother is living in the desert at a truck stop named ... are you ready?  Paradise Falls!  (Get it?  Paradise falls ... ba-da-bing!)  Michael defies God's orders by protecting the child and its mother because, as he explains, God is unable to distinguish between what God wants and what God truly needs.  God sends a legion of angels in the form of vampiric zombies to fight Michael, and when that doesn't work, He sends Gabriel who arrives on the scene blowing his horn like crazy.  The two angels wrestle each other, and ... well, the movie finally limps to its lame conclusion.

The only thing that saves this movie from a one-star rating is the performance of Charles S. Dutton as the cook at Paradise Falls.  (Paradise falls ... get it?  Heh, heh, heh.)  Bless his heart, Dutton tries hard to invest his character with some warmth and dimension, which is more than can be said for the rest of the cast.  Top-billed Paul Bettany is colorless as Michael, Lucas Black overdoes the naive hick schtick as the nominal romantic lead, and Adrianne Palicki brings no shading to the character of the mother-to-be.  Worst of all is Dennis Quaid, who at least has the grace to look and to sound like he's ashamed to be cast in this tripe.

I can't in all good conscience recommend this waste of celluloid to anyone.  Between the inane screenplay, the foul language, the bastardized theology, the inept editing and the lackluster special effects, there's nothing here to champion.

3838476,4,B0021L8V34,"Interesting movie, but not the usual procedure for an Angle to use modern day weapons when they have the power of GOD behind them. Special swords have been recorded back in time, but I guess this is a modern update even though the Power of God is much more greater than imagined. God also ""Promised"" NOT to destroy the Earth or it's inhabitants by my best recollection of the Bible after the Great Flood in Noah's day.
I think the pregnant female's ""Character""  should have been a little more developed as to the origin of the Father.
Still an interesting movie and scary too.......",1385683200,,582,4.596153846153846
3838477,4,B0021L8V34,Legion is a different type of movie that I am used to seeing. The move to me is a move that inspires some hope through our children that things can change.,1385510400,,155,4.032258064516129

3838482,1,B0021L8V34,"It's been a long time since I've seen a movie that has such quality actors and is this pathetic. I watched the first 30 minutes of the film before screaming ""uncle!"". I couldn't take the assault to my intelligence any more. If you are interested, yes there was gore if you have an aversion to such, but that wasn't the problem. The problem is this movie has no substance. Not a lick. It's asinine, banal, stupid, and looks like they made it on a $3 budget. I've watched and loved some movies that had little to no budget i.e. Trancers I-IV. At least that movie though hokey and corny, was fun. They didn't take themselves too seriously. But Legion... urine-poor acting by actors who simply didn't care; a script written by somebody who seemed to think that one-sentence snide commentaries makes for engaging dialogue; cardboard characters whose cardboard got soaked in the rain; and all while trying to pull off the joke that this was a serious film. The only thing serious about the 30 minutes that I could tolerate was how seriously bad this movie was. This. Film. Is. Crap.

The list of actors in this is impressive:  Paul Betthany, Dennis Quaid, Lucas Black (Fast & Furious-Tokyo Drift), Charles S. Dutton, Tyrese Gibson (""Fast & Furious-Tokyo Drift"", Transformers), Kate Walsh, Willa Holland (Arrow) and Jon Tenney (The Closer). One would think that with a list of actors of this caliber, the acting would be diamond sharp.  It isn't. I got the impression that no one cared one iota toward putting in any effort. They read their lines, but that was all. There's just no depth to any character.

The script is so bad and laden with clich&eacute;s that it makes ""Elvira, Mistress of the Dark"" and ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" seem like Shakespeare sonnets. I think the script would work better if no one spoke and they only glowered at each other.

I borrowed this film from a friend. I would have demanded my money back even if I'd have paid one penny for it.

There are only two things that I liked about this film: 1) The dvd/blu-ray cover is wicked cool, and 2) stopping the film from playing any further.",1380758400,,2109,4.625668449197861
3838483,5,B0021L8V34,"its twisted and strong. Its beautiful in all ways, the actors the concept the scenes. its a great action horror flick",1380672000,,117,4.619047619047619
3838484,5,B0021L8V34,"The entire basis behind it is interesting to say the least, but it's an amazing movie with the twists and turns of a thriller.",1379462400,,126,4.291666666666667
3838504,5,B0021L8V34,"I like the movie a lot. The quality is very nice. Buying online has never been a big thing for me because I might be buying a cheap and fake ones or bootleg of that but this one is totally great.

Now I need to watch it .",1379289600,,221,3.6041666666666665
3838505,4,B0021L8V34,"This movie is hilarious, if you enjoy the movie for what it is, it is much more for laughs than a scare factor.",1378425600,,111,3.869565217391304
3838506,5,B0021L8V34,Great movie with wonderful special effects.  It was tension packed and well worth the purchase price.  I highly recommend Legion.,1378425600,,129,5.4

3838508,5,B0021L8V34,"One of the best interpretations to date. It felt like it was pulled directly out of theKing James.
It is a must see for Christians.",1376524800,,131,4.28
3838509,5,B0021L8V34,good movie,1376438400,,10,4.5
3838510,1,B0021L8V34,"This movie is one hell of a mess. Even if we excuse the mail-it-in acting performances (save for Paul Bettany, who does give a decent effort), and even if we try and accept the over-the-top and downright corny demon transformations (is it funny to see a curse-filled action sequence involving an 80 year old lady who climbs walls? Yes. But not when the movie is also trying to take itself very seriously), we are still left with a terrible script, paper-thin characters (is Charles Dutton's character an amputee solely for the opportunity for a mid-chaos one-liner on ""blowing your hand off""?), a total lack of any semblance of pace or continuity, and one of the worst ending sequences I have ever seen. Now lets add to this the fact that the entire movie is an overtly pro-life moral tale and a warning to modern society that if we keep it up, God Almighty is going to send his angels to kill us with machine guns, karate and demented ice cream vendors. This couldn't be made any clearer than the fact that Scott Stewart decides to bookend the movie with the quote that God is going to wipe out humanity simply because he is ""tired of all the bulls***""

I can tell you on this point, I totally agree.",1376265600,,1201,4.509174311926605
3838511,4,B0021L8V34,Not you standard fair of Angels and demons.  The mix of aware zombies and fallen angels makes for a entertaining movie that still provides the hope of a happy ending!,1374019200,,166,4.533333333333333
3838512,5,B0021L8V34,This movie to me gleaned on another side of heaven that christians would not adore too much. But let's face it; is anything ever as perfect as people perceive?,1373328000,,159,4.517241379310345
3838513,5,B0021L8V34,Blu-ray make the movie even better. The clarity in the picture and the sound are awesome. It is well worth the purchase.,1372464000,,120,4.5
3838543,5,B0021L8V34,"I've rented this movie several times; so I just decided to buy it and own it.

I love the idea of Michael and Gabriel ""fighting"" over what God has asked to do to humanity.  And GOOD wins OVER BAD!!!",1371340800,,198,4.051282051282051
3838544,5,B0021L8V34,"This is a very good movie, underrated as well. Some religious freaks may not like it....but shouldn't be too sensitive on what is said. Good actors in 1 movie",1370390400,,158,4.482758620689655

3838547,5,B0021L8V34,"AWESOMELY GREAT MOVIE, PAUL BETTANY AND KEVIN DURAND WERE AWESOME AS THE ARCHANGELS AND A GOOD SUPPORTING CAST, IT'S A MUST WATCH, I BELIEVE THE MOVIE AND ACTORS ARE UNDERRATED.",1369699200,,177,4.933333333333334
3838548,5,B0021L8V34,This was a faboulous compromise for guys and chicks. A modern day Mary and Joseph story. A movie that will resore your hope in humanity.,1368489600,,136,4.48
3838549,4,B0021L8V34,"I am usually a nut about eschatological films (End Time or Apocalyptic films). I have also been mired by various views of what an Angel should or should not be. In Legion, we see an Archangel questioning God's commands.  Michael of course is in most Lore, the strongest, smartest, and the Head of God's Heavenly host. Michael at one point in the film makes it clear he is not interested in what this cadre of characters believes...He is worried with what is. Paul Bettany, despite a somewhat stale script in the case of pure dialog, does a more than decent job of portraying someone who realizes that sacrifice is perhaps more important than direct action- since sacrifice is an action. The character of Gabriel played by Durand makes it very obvious that while he is obeying orders if not blindly, doesn't entirely care whether Michael is right in his defiance or not.  Quaid, Black, Palicki, and even Gibson, all represent sides of humanity that could easily explain God's frustration. The one mystery of the film is when Jeep and Charlie escape with Charlie's newborn son. Somehow the sidestepped violence ends and the ""possessed"" stop and pay attention.

In the end I can look beyond the sideshow dialog and see that there is a point to this film. Whether based in a human angst similar to a kind of ""Mallrats Grown Up feel"" or just simple people trying to grasp that a faith lost or ignored, is still watched.",1368144000,,1414,4.693548387096774
3838550,5,B0021L8V34,brought and downloaded this from amazon because it is a great movie with plenty of special efx and tons of action.,1367884800,,114,4.476190476190476
3838551,5,B0021L8V34,"Creepy, disturbing movie.  Not the best there is, but I really love the story and the visuals.  It is mind-blowing with some really nasty bad guys and terrible things that happen, but Michael and Gabriel characters are beautiful.  A lot of violence, but it makes for a good watching experience.  The ending battle is understated and handled well.  I highly recommend this for a Friday night fright-fest!",1366502400,,403,4.955223880597015

3838629,3,B0021L8V34,I liked the movie but I thought that the concept could have given a little more when it came to the story about God and the angles.,1363305600,,131,3.888888888888889
3838630,4,B0021L8V34,"Story was a little creep but worth the buy. I just adore Paul Bettany and he plays this part well. (My favorite part of the movie in fact.)

3838631,5,B0021L8V34,"I like apocalyptic doom and gloom movies. What is there not to love about this movie? It has demons, angels, end of the world, a crazy old bat that crawls on the ceiling. Some freaky ice cream truck driver that walks like a freaky spider type thing. Lots of people die and there are only a few survivors. AWESOME!@",1362355200,,314,4.338983050847458
3838632,5,B0021L8V34,"To me, one of the best things about this movie is that it is NOT the typical zombie apocalypse we have all seen too much of nor is it a meteor coming to destroy Earth.  For a change it's our own God destroying that which He created, or will He?  Yes, this is an apocalyptic religious story.  So if you don't want to think that God could give up on man and send His angels down to destroy us then forget this movie.  I find it a fascinating movie and exceedingly well done.  This movie has a wonderful story, great actors, and an ending that leaves the viewer thinking that all could be well.  Even an atheist can enjoy the action in this movie.",1360540800,,644,4.153225806451613

3838665,3,B0021L8V34,"This is an offbeat film but but is worth watching, if only once.  No real comic relief  like in ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" (and there should have been)  like but Paul Bettany is a very good actor and  helps carry a film that should have had a bit more farce in it to counteract his intensity. Dennis Quaid could have been used much more effectively in this manner.  Because of the lack of humor it will be a forgotten film.",1359849600,,418,4.175

Using a hodgepodge of visual ideas from earlier and better films (Night of the Living Dead, Jacob's Ladder, Tremors, etc.), they render a perfectly predictable and ordinary horror film. There is far too much time spent on quiet moments for the characters to talk about themselves; that would be fine if the conversations or character development were actually interesting or developed, but it slows the movie's pacing down drastically, without giving us any real insight or emotional involvement. There is nowhere a shred of originality, conviction, or humor, and the actors are wasted for the most part, though Paul Bettany manages to find some depth in his character.

The role of Jeep could have been casted better and Kate Walsh's devoted wife of 15+ years can't be described as memorable (would have been nice to lose her within the first 10 minutes of the film).

Paul Bettany as Archangel Michael?  The cover shot alone was worth adding this movie to my collection!  Great action and special effects!  Dennis Quaid as Jeep's dad and owner of the remote desert truck stop is spot-on.  Tyrese Gibson also does a great job.  What Bible-centric movie would be complete without a Bible thumper (Charles Dutton) who has a hook for one hand?",1333497600,,771,4.869230769230769
3838886,4,B0021L8V34,"Legion(released Jan/10)is an above average film that sports a solid cast and good S/FX....all great in hiding the less than stellar script. Dennis Quaid is Bob Hansen,Charles Dutton is Percy,Paul Bettany is Archangel Michael,Adrianne Palicki is Charlie and Lucas Black is Jeep Hansen.
The story starts in L.A. where Archangel Michael has come to Earth and has shed his wings to become a mortal human. The scene switches to a diner way out in the middle of nowhere where a Bob Hansen and his son Jeep,with the assistance of cook Percy and pregnant waitress Charlie,have eked out a meager living for years. Thrown into the mix is a couple with a broken down Bmer and a rebellious daughter. The first to stir the pot is an old lady who comes in to dine but turns ""ugly"" very quickly. Once dispatched the diner inhabitants are winging their way down the highway to save the life of the male patron. Soon though they are forced to turn back,as what appears to be a large sandstorm they are heading into is in actuality a plague of flies. Once back at the diner Archangel Michael shows up and tells the group to prepare for the worst. He arms them all with high powered weapons and soon the carnage begins. It starts slowly with the eerie arrival of an ice cream truck and its ""vendor"",then moves on to a continuous line of vehicles of all sorts from both directions.
The small group are surrounded and slowly but surely the group of possessed people outside pick away at each person inside. As their numbers dwindle,so it appears,does their hope. It is the arrival however of another Archangel,Gabriel,that things finally come down to brass tacks. Michael and Gabriel battle each other to the ""death"",with Gabriel winning the first round. Out in the desert and on the run Gabriel catches up to the survivors Jeep,Charlie and her baby...whom this entire sequence of events was the catalyst for. It is a touch and go finale and Gabriel goes away the poorer than he came in.
I found the first half hour,where we get the necessary character development in order to move the film forward,a little cliched. The characters are either tired of life because of wrong decisions years before and/or they're going no where fast,one has an unrequited love and one has strong religious convictions. It is all too obvious a build up for characters that need a life changing experience,to that exact life changing experience that is inevitably coming later in the film. Added to this are a myriad of unanswered questions that arise throughout the film. Having said that,however,the solid acting throughout is what saves this picture from imploding in on itself as Quaid,Bettany and especially Dutton show off their acting skills. What one has to do is to let go and just let the film's rhythm move you along. If you do that the film is much more enjoyable.
Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp in its original a/r of 2:40:1. Extras include three featurettes on the stunts,visual effects and the cast and characters.
All in all a nice film about an apocalypse denied. The acting is top notch as are the S/Fx. Just overlook the sometimes cardboard characterizations and the plot holes,and you will have a better time than you otherwise would. Recommended.",1331424000,,3244,4.794642857142857

3838903,2,B0021L8V34,"Sometimes, movies just need a bigger budget, and that's all there is to it.  Working with anything under the triple digits is like scrapping for pennies if you're a director committed to an action flick.  Therefore, to see a movie with the ambition and scale of ""Legion"" attempt to work under the restrain of a $23 million budget is painfully difficult to bear; it just can't all work from a financial perspective.

But it does try - commendably so - to keep things clicking, and the thrills, albeit restrained, are present.  That said, ""Legion"" is a film that never entirely shows its full potential, for some reason or other.  Admittedly, themes concepts of this grandeur would be difficult to tackle for any director, rookie or otherwise, but I give Stewart the benefit of the doubt when I come to the conclusion that ""Legion""'s reach simply exceeds its grasp.

Really, though, you'd be hard-pressed to find someone better for the lofty role of Heaven's general than Paul Bettany.  Ever a man eager for his first leading role (and he certainly deserves it) Bettany is consistently intriguing, and his feuds with his rival brother-angel (played by Kevin Durand) are the high points of the film.  Kate Walsh is another striker here as the struggling mother of a rebellious teenager and the wife of the film's first victim.

But where execution occasionally prevails, creativity is largely absent.  The theoretical stakes presumably make the film itself a candy store of possibilities - it's the benefit of working with a risky premise.  Sadly, none of it really comes to fruition, and we're ultimately left with another zombie movie with angles thrown into the mix.

You're not going to find anything worth cheering over, or even discussing, in ""Legion"".  The action is surprisingly skimpy, the performances are mixed, and the effects are merely satisfactory.  However, for all of its faults, it does do some things that we haven't quite seen before, and I'm always willing to pay cash for a UFC angel brawl.",1324166400,,2009,4.922848664688427

3838907,4,B0021L8V34,"Horror movies today leave very little to the imagination of the viewer, which is a shame, because I think if a movie is well written and the actors have done a good job, then you don't need to see gore to be creeped out and frightened.

With that said, the reason I like this movie seems to be the same reason that other's don't.  It is all about the battle between good and evil.

While the Archangel Michael chooses to fall to earth *spoiler alert* to protect an unborn child that must be born on Christmas Day and the woman who is carrying it, there is a ragtag cast of characters who aren't celestial beings with greater knowledge of heaven.  They are average human beings with faults and frailties and they choose to fight to protect a stranger and her unborn child or to succumb to the easy route.

It stands to reason that there are so many books written and movies made about this very subject, because we as human beings have the choice of taking the easy way or standing firm in the face of opposition to do what we know in our hearts to be the right thing.

We make our choices based on faith and what we know to be true, what we know we can live with doing, and we act upon those factors.

Most of the time we aren't faced with choices that are literally life or death, or that might cost us our immortal soul, but life is about every choice that we make, each step we take on our own journey and how we affect others around us by the way we live our lives.

While it's not high art or a serious study on faith, it gives you the opportunity to think about the choices we make and how strong we might be when faced with doing the right thing even if it means tremendous sacrifice or if we'd just go along because it's so much easier to do than take a stand.

You can't judge a book by it's cover based upon the people you meet at this dust bowl of a diner in the middle of literally nowhere, but you do see who steps up and who gives in and that's the lesson.

Was this only a paycheck for these actors? Did they actually believe this was going to be a blockbuster?

God is angry with humanity. He has decided to wipe them out. The Archangel Michael has his doubts that God is doing the right thing so he rebels and comes to earth, cuts off his wings and begins his search for humanity's last hope. This hope is found in an unborn child.

Michael loads up on guns and ammunition (because we all know that's how you kill angels) and finds a group of survivors in a rundown diner. The unborn baby is there and it's up to these humans and Michael to destroy the people who have been possessed by God's angels.

Gabriel joins the fight at the end with an angelic smackdown between the two archangels.

3838938,2,B0021L8V34,"I am giving this movie two stars after watching it four times on DVD, and then I've gone ahead and pushed the button to buy the damned thing off Amazon.  Why?  The same reason I burned through 3 VHS tapes each of Rocky Horror Picture Show and Army of Darkness.  Despite all of it's campy awfulness, I must confess that I have a real soft spot for campy awful cult films with beautiful little golden nuggets of goodness that you're just not finding these days in the big-budget blockbusters.

The problem with this movie is they took a less-than B-grade horror script with B-grade special effects and, because the premise of God getting angry enough to exterminate mankind, a second coming, and the two archangels is so darned interesting, lured a few passably decent actors in between other jobs for low pay to come and actually ACT in this plot-hole ridden flick.  Because the actors had real talent and no real script, not to mention low pay, they each got their little five minute cameos to develop their own characters and, I'll-be-darned, I actually began to CARE about these characters.  You know when an actor is self-scripting to fill in for a lousy script and, well, these ones did.  Rotten tomatoes and the critics griped about all the '5-minute-cameos', but it was my second-favorite part of the movie.

My favorite part ... the reason I'm buying this movie despite the low rating ... is once Gabriel arrives, the tension between the two archangels, the defiant one, and the obedient one, is simply breathtaking (spoiler alert).  Michael is so earnest in his desire to salvage humanity despite it's defects, while Gabriel is so contemptuous and clueless, it just makes the movie watchable simply to watch these to fight and the big dumb lug Gabriel cry as he watches the brother he just stabbed die.  A single perfect tear.  And then the end ... I won't spoil it for you ... but the ending was so open you could just go write your own script for Legion II to pick things up from there as one reviewer here suggested.

Which, actually, is what an awful lot of people have done.  It's called Fan fiction and there's a whole community of godawful-campy-movie lovers who just love to pick apart movies that had so much potential such as this one did, analyze the scenes, and then rewrite it.

This is the movie that 'could have been.'  It whets an appetite moviegoers are desperately hungry to satiate, and then never quite gets there.

Out of all my reviews, I've only rated two movies. One because I loved it, and this one because I had high hopes for it...but ended up hating it. I mean, come on. God is ticked off at humanity (as if he/she/it didn't already know the depths of stupidity we're all capable of), so he (just to make it simple) decides to send his angels down to inhabit people who drive up in old muscle cars and will quickly remind you of the apocalyptic anarchist types from the 80's films. Unfortunately, God is handicapped by the excruciatingly slow zombie-like humans, where you can just imagine the all-powerful upstairs screaming, ""go man, GO!!!"" This pile of nonsense utilizes the same dumb effects you'll see in any post-2000 B-horror film and the dialogue makes you want to poke both eardrums out. The only scary part to this film is the one you've already seen in the commercials, and even then you wish the old lady would keep her mouth shut, since the only frightening part comes from her sporadic movements around the cafe. There is an enormous, and I mean ENORMOUS problem with this scene when you finally find out what the purpose of her (the old lady) being there was, but I won't ""spoil"" it for you, if that's even possible. I'm one of those people who believes no on on earth has a single clue about what God is and believe we're incapable of trying to understand something like that with our puny brains, but I've got to believe that a God would never allow any physical being to do anything he/she/it would not want it to do. That makes making any movie where a physical being attempt to rise up against such a powerful force,a little ridiculous. I hope someone finds a clever way to do this. This is a straight-to-dvd that accidentally got sent to the theaters. I'm sorry to everyone who lost their money. And if God is up there speed-reading this review, I just want to apologize.

It sets the stage for a ""Fort Apache"" like scenario - the mis-matched band of good guys are surrounded in an isolated outpost by lots of very bad people. Chills and thrills galore. The way that they incorporated the loss of connection to the outside world - radio and TV dead... Ooooo, your imagination runs wild. The high point for me was when the old lady drives up in a dust covered sedan. How did she see through the windshield? Hmmmm. Then, (not a spoiler alert because it was in the trailer) the old lady turns evil. Wow, a great scene. Alas, shortly after that, the movie sinks into a combination shoot-em-up and mis-mash of an eternal struggle centered around divinity, eternity and the apocalypse. Hard to follow, hard to understand and hard to like. I especially didn't like the ambiguous ending - all of this time and there is no resolution. Sorry, not my cup of Lipton.

I don't know why I watched the whole thing. It was bad all the way through. There wasn't really a proper story arc: the problem was that this woman was carrying a baby that somehow would grow up to save humanity, but ""God"" sent an ""angel"" down to kill it because He had given up on mankind. The story arc was never completed -- we don't know if the baby grew up to save mankind or not. All we know is that the angel sent to kill him decided to save him instead, then fought off his BFF to keep that angel from finishing the job. The biggest problem, though, was that if God had truly given up on humanity and wanted it destroyed, why turn everyone into zombies? Why not just flood the planet or something? Wouldn't He have to deal with ridding the world of zombies when the humans were all dead/converted? And if there were a single person about to be born that could turn humanity around, why wouldn't God want to give him a shot? It's not like waiting another 40-50 years would hurt, right?

3839010,2,B0021L8V34,"With a more capable director behind the lenses and a better screenplay too, ""Legion"" would have been much more entertaining. The apocalyptic thriller is yet another end-of-the-world scenario movie about stock characters trapped in a diner in Mojave Desert. Completely isolated in the middle of nowhere, the diner owner (Dennis Quaid) and his son (Lucas Black), a cook (Charles Dutton), a pregnant waitress (Adrianne Palicki) and those unlucky patrons are under attack from the zombie-like humans all intent on their demise - or demise of one of them. And one mysterious visitor Michael (Paul Bettany) announces that God has lost faith in mankind.

""Legion"" is a hopelessly derivative supernatural thriller - with many ideas borrowed from elsewhere, including countless zombie films and ""The Terminator"" - but there is one original concept, namely, its theological aspect and battling angles. With nice special effects (including ""the ice cream man"" by cameo Doug Jones) and cinematography, ""Legion"" is technically decent, but the potential is not fully utilized because of its slow pace and numerous plot holes.

In short, ""Legion"" is a pretty boring experience. The story begins with intriguing premise, but it doesn't make much sense in the confusing second half. Characters talk much, but what they say is not very interesting. Most importantly, action scenes are lazy and repetitious with no real build-up. The last part is particularly disappointing.",1295481600,,1455,5.405286343612334

3839014,4,B0021L8V34,"I was never a fan of horror movies, but my husband has convinced me to watch a few, and I've really come to like certain ones. I now add LEGION to that special list. LEGION is a different kind of horror flick. Not much horror, not much gore, plenty of action, and a surprising amount of goodness and light. The general plot is that God has lost hope in mankind and has sent a plague of angels to wipe it out. But one of his archangels turns against him and comes to Earth to protect humanity. Archangel Michael still truly loves mankind, and will lay down his live to save us all.  Despite this description, LEGION is not irreverent and not overly religious. But, I am not going to dwell on this aspect of LEGION, because the movie doesn't dwell on it.

I knew nothing about LEGION before we started, but as I watched it, it sure felt like a Stephen King novel: a group of strangers, stranded at an isolated diner, must fight off hordes of evil. And even though it is NOT based on a King novel, I was just as completely absorbed by LEGION's story.

I took a look at what the critics on Rotten Tomatoes had to say about LEGION, and they hated it. Loathed might be a better word. And I think most of the comments are justified, although some are just snobby. Is this a perfect movie? No. Are there clich&eacute;s and genre cross-overs? Yes. Did I enjoy watching it? ABSOLUTELY. LEGION is definitely one of those films where the whole is much more than the sum of its parts.",1293667200,33,1471,4.322463768115942
3839015,2,B0021L8V34,"I've always thought angels are actually pretty terrifying.  Evil is something we all think we know pretty well, but a creature of pure good is really quite intimidating.  Angels aren't just jp;u; in the case of archangels, they are warriors too, capable of laying waste to entire cities. You don't mess with an angel.

So Legion's premise seems like a great idea for a movie.  It the eve of the apocalypse and God has given an order to wipe out humanity.  Fortunately, humanity's salvation lies in the unborn child of waitress Charlie (Adrianne Palicki). She works for Bob Hanson (Dennis Quaid, harrumphing his way through the script), and is followed around by Bob's son Jeep (Lucas Black). Populating this diner on the edge of the Mojave Desert is short-order cook Percy (Charles S. Dutton), bickering couple Howard (Jon Tenney) and Sandra (Kate Walsh) Anderson, their loose daughter Audrey (Willa Holland), and ""urban"" Kyle (Tyrese Gibson).

These characters are all stereotypes; the rich squabbling couple, the desperate-for-attention teenager, the grumpy old-timer, the lovesick kid...but the most reprehensible is Kyle, a foul-mouthed thug trying to redeem himself who (of course) carries a gun.  Kyle's presence is forced, like he was inserted into the film to make it feel modern.

All these folks are there to die.  The real protagonist is archangel Michael (Paul Bettany), who is such a rebel that he disobeys God's orders and cuts off his wings. After retrieving some firepower he holes up in the diner to defend the child. The first attack, which has been heavily hyped in trailers, is an Evil Dead homage, complete with sweet grandmas threatening to swallow souls. From there on out, Legion becomes a zombie movie, as hordes of possessed humans throw themselves at the diner.

Legion isn't very deep.  If you cut off an angel's wings, he's pretty much a guy with some wounds on his back.  In other words, despite being about angels, Legion isn't particularly angelic.

It's not until the third act that we get some real angel-on-angel action.  Gabriel (Kevin Durand) arrives with his spinning mace of doom and we get some real angel action, complete with a form of ""angel fu"" that has to be seen to be believed.  You get the sense Legion was supposed to be filled with angel battles like this but they couldn't afford the budget.

Throughout Legion there are hints that the world is falling apart.  But because the diner is so isolated, the end of the world is never effectively conveyed. This is a movie about world spanning events, but where it should be epic Legion feels oddly claustrophobic.

Legion is the opening chapter in a new bible of the apocalypse, but with the violence turned up to eleven and all the preachy parts cut out.  It shamelessly uses traditional religious icons as action heroes, but doesn't have much more to offer than that.",1293580800,,2865,4.906639004149378
3839016,2,B0021L8V34,"LEGION was never going to be a great movie.  But it should at least have been FUN.  Sadly, it is a poorly written, poorly acted bore.

The concept, while ridiculous, could have led to a crazy, over-the-top action fantasy.  Apparently, the angels of heaven have been directed to begin the apocalypse, because God and the angels are just so fed up with how awful mankind has become.  (I have to point out that this is kinda what happened prior to Noah and his flood, and after that, God sent his rainbow as a promise to never wipe out mankind again.  Wow, we've really come off the tracks if God is breaking these promises.)  But there IS a loophole.  If this one particular baby, being carried by unwed mother Adrienne Palicki (from TVs FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS), is born, the world will be saved.  So naturally, the angels have a target on the back of that baby.  And this baby's mom is located in the most out-of-the-way, desolate roadside diner in all of America, so that a small but varied group of movie stereotypes can engage in a battle with the fast approaching angel assassins.  But Archangel Michael (Paul Bettany) has decided he'd rather save this child, so he shows up to fight off the hoard.

Cheesy, but packed with potential.  Yet, for a movie that promises lots of action...there is VERY little action.  And that might be okay if the time between action sequences was filmed with anything other than horrific dialogue delivered by disinterested actors.  The normally charming and easy Dennis Quaid is supposed to be the owner of the diner, a sad-sack who has long seen his dreams of modest retail success go down the tubes along with his marriage...but he comes across as simple-minded and pitiful.  Kate Walsh is on hand to play a wealthy, shrewish mother whose car has broken down...and she fails utterly to generate any consistency in her clichd role.  Charles Dutton is around to play the same character Charles Dutton usually plays...but this time, his dialogue is so tired that there is no Dutton charisma.  Tyrese Gibson is actually marginally interesting (he's usually a pretty stone-faced presence)...but that's only in comparison to a pretty low bar.  Palicki has a few sparks, but her character is generally so unappealing, that it's hard to root for her.

Worst of all is Paul Bettany.  He's often a terrific actor (A BEAUTIFUL MIND, MASTER  & COMMANDER)...but here he is saddled with an underwritten part, and he seems determined to wring absolutely nothing out of it.  Some actors can take bad scripts and by force of will make them interesting.  Bettany does the opposite here.  He has about one expression.  He has nothing interesting to say.  He isn't convincing as a man (or angel) of action.

The trailer to the movie showed a scene with an old woman turning into a crazy, wall climbing monster.  The scene, in context, is laughable and actually doesn't make much sense in the plot.  And there are other scenes too that seem to mostly involve taking something we generally think of as pleasant and harmless (a nice old woman, an ice cream truck) and making it monstrous.  But there's no surprise or suspense built up.  I guess just making a nice old woman drop a few f-bombs is supposed to make my blood run cold.

The television show SUPERNATURAL recently had a season that essentially involved angels acting badly.  That show, with all its shortcomings of occasionally sketchy acting and low-budget effects, actually made the subject of angels fascinating, interesting and even vaguely logical.  If angel-intrigue is something you're interested in, just watch Season 5 of that show.

(Also, the name of the film makes no sense.  In the Bible, ""Legion"" is what a crowd of demons inhabiting a human call themselves.  Angels were not involved.)

In the end, LEGION is a movie that had a silly concept that could have been good, clean FUN.  Instead, it takes itself far, FAR too seriously...and ends up being a serious bore.  There is no reason to subject yourself to this film.",1292803200,5,4005,4.779883381924198
3839017,5,B0021L8V34,"Good stuff. If you liked the 'Prophecy' trilogy (I did) and/or 'Constantine' (this too I liked), you'll like this.  Angels killing demons, demons killing angels, angels killing each other, with talking monkeys caught in the middle (that would be us). The archangel Gabriel mesmerizes as the ever-loyal, dutiful, devoted son of Heaven facing off against the archangel Michael, who's come to save mankind from Heaven's wrath (where's Lucifer in this mess?). And--wait for it--the angels are packing some serious shoot-'em-up hardware. Cool stuff.

But wait! I'm sure that--when presented with such blasphemy and heresy--theologists, historians of religion, and the devoutly righteous (and everyone else who's standing around waiting for the world to end) will probably stick forks in their eyes, drop to their knees, look to the sky, and spew out some ""talking in tongues"" psycho-babble, all while howling and beating themselves with whips.

I agree that the script and acting, particularly of the supporting cast, is often overdramatic and awkard. I find the character of Jeep especially annoying. What I find most redeeming about this film, and why I keep returning to it, are the scenes involving Paul Bettany (Michael) and Kevin Durand (Gabriel).

These two actors clearly have considerably more mature talent and ability than do the other actors. Their deliveries are powerful, though subtle, and simultaneously emotionally tense. The internal conflict and self-loathing that Kevin Durand expresses without a word is breathtaking. And Paul Bettany's quieter moments, particularly his monologue before Jeep, are scene-stealing and memorable.

3839042,2,B0021L8V34,"Others have already summarized the plot so here are some thoughts-there are some spoilers-especially the last sentence about the ending.  There are some cool scenes and special effects in this movie which make it worth watching-once.  When Gabriel and Michael fight it is overall pretty unique take on the angels wings (they are armored and like swords).  Some of the scenes of the possessed who come to get the chosen baby are freakish and a little scary, the kid who looks like Chuckie is particularly disturbing.  The actors/actresses are pretty good and most are easily recognizable.  Overall, this is an enjoyable movie as long as you are willing to overlook some glaring deficits in story and logic.  While it is a little unique to have God's angels be soldiers who have literal ""collars"" the story doesn't make a lot of sense.  If there was some really old prophesy about the promiscuous girl and her baby who will save humanity why did God even let the mom be born?  If he was busy and the mom was born and got pregnant with the chosen baby why didn't he send a couple of angels to the adoption agency posing as upstanding prospective parents looking to adopt (she was giving the baby up)?  Once the baby was in their hands they could do whatever they wanted.  God sends a plague of flies but only briefly, why not send more or something else with a little more bite?  Why not just send a tornado or some other natural disaster?  Or, why not send a meteor (it worked on the dinosaurs-I wonder what they did to get God to lose faith in them)? There is a half hour in the middle of the movie when all the possessed disappear for no apparent reason, giving time for all of the characters to pontificate about their childhood and lessons from their parents, this part seems random and unbelievable.  We never see God just his black dressed and black winged Angels-they are portrayed as mindless soldiers except for Michael-and they are portrayed more like our concept of angels of darkness (they can possess people and turn their teeth into daggers, walk on walls, kill babies, eat raw steak with flies all over it, cuss a lot etc).  The ending is silly.  They show the happy couple and baby in a car driving with an arsenal in the back.  So, did God get in touch with his loving feelings again and recall the possessing angels or not?  They look happy driving in a car with enough guns to supply a platoon or two.",1289865600,,2418,4.534562211981567
3839043,2,B0021L8V34,"I really wanted to like this.

I was hoping for another fun theological horror film along the lines of ""The Prophecy"" or ""Warlock"".

""Legion"" isn't close, actually it's basically a bunch of horror cliches packaged together with an above average cast.

Let's go through this paint by numbers flick:

1. It seems it's the end of the world (again)
2. The only thing standing between mankind and oblivion is a rag-tag group of people.
3. The people are trapped in a roadside diner.
4. Possessed people talk in strange voices and have black eyeballs
5. An unlikely hero emerges
6. Throw in a twist ending

While there are some decent visuals sprinkled throughout the movie, the story is just so tired, if you are a horror fan, you've seen all of this before, and done in a much better way. ""Legion"" doesn't even fall into the so-bad-it's-good catagory, it's just boring.

I wanted to like this film, angels, great effects, violence and only a thread of a plot, normally I do like movies that are heavy on the action even if they only have the bare wish of a plot. This one? I kept feeling like I'd seen this story before, it had wings and angels instead of cyborg assassins from a distant future. God instead of a computer program trying to stop the resistance from happening, but at the end, it was Terminator with wings. And not done nearly as well. With the mythology to draw on, with the possible conflict available, it failed to live up to it's effects.
The effects were good, but instead of being as creepy as it could have been, it was just gross in parts.

When it was over, I did see the similarity to Terminator. A woman who is the mother to a baby that must be kept alive and the men protecting her. That kind of took something away from this movie, leaving you feeling as though it was a little bit of a rip off. Fortunately, that was where the similarity ended. I would have liked to have seen more of the actual angels in this since they were really the key to keeping this different. Overall, entertaining enough for 4 stars.

""Legion"" is one I should have passed on, a pity since it has Paul Bettany in it, a credible actor who should not have been in this. The story centers around the premise that God has lost faith in humanity and has sent an army of his angels to Earth to destroy mankind. Two of his leading angels, i.e. Michael and Gabriel end up on opposing sides. Gabriel (Kevin Durand) is portrayed as God's loyal henchangel, who is determined to see that God's will be done. Michael (Paul Bettany) on the other hand believes that humans deserve a chance, and decides to protect a pregnant waitress who is carrying the savior of mankind.

So, an 'epic' battle begins, with the angels possessing the weak and evil and using the bodies to wreak havoc on Earth. Meanwhile the waitress is holed up in a desert diner with a couple of customers and some workers, including her boyfriend Jeep (Lucas Black), and Bob (Dennis Quaid, what is it with him and bad horror lately?

The angels descend on the diner and all hell literally breaks loose.

The only highlight in this otherwise weak offering is the battle between Archangel Michael and Gabriel. Otherwise, the effects are really not that spectacular, unless you think watching an old woman bare her pointy teeth and rip out a man's throat and then proceed to crawl up a wall, interesting. To be fair Bettany does an adequate job with his role, despite its limitations. The dialogue veers between utter silliness and some attempts at pseudo philosophy/theology that never really work. Final verdict - a waste of time.

Sound familiar?  The writer of this film just took Terminator, scratched out the words ""Terminators"" and ""Skynet"" and just wrote in ""Angels"" and ""God.""

Then in the end we have our heroes fleeing in a stolen police car while their attacker is trying to climb up the back of the car and through the back window while using his hands like they claws all while the person who is driving is shooting backwards at the attacker.  I suppose we had to get a few T2 references in there while we were at it.  The movie ends with our heroes driving off into the desert after an ominous voice-over is given.  Back to the first Terminator for the ending I guess.

Plus, did we really need to see ""Spider-granny?""  Was that supposed to scare me or invoke fear?  Cuz all I did during that fight scene was laugh my ass off.

3839071,2,B0021L8V34,"While many will find this film to be a story about the post apocaliptic world, I would this film to be a movie about free will.  Premise is that God is angry on mankind for being foolish, greedy, selfish and disobedient and decides to let his angels take car of the mankind.  One of the angels who happens to be general of the army (Paul Bettany) decides to rebel agains extermination of the mankind and help them survive.  And based on this premise, the story begins.

The most exciting part of the film to me was a battle between two angels - Michael and Gabriel.  Michael is the rebelious one and Gabriel is the obedient angel to God.  At one point, as they are battling out their ideals in order to satisfy God's love Michael tells Gabriel: ""You are doing what he wants you to do and I am doing what he hopes me to do"".  The statement stroke me as one angel telling another that even they have a free will and should do according what they believe is just and right and not just follow orders.  Basically, film seems to be an exploration of the idea that God has hope for the humankind and angels are there to decide if such ideal is worth sacrificing for or not.

The part that turned me off is that ""weak"" humans turn into zombies and killers.  Nevertheless, Paul Bettany gives another powerful performance.  He is very strong character actor that gives some meaning and quiet beauty to this film.",1286236800,,1403,4.39922480620155

The cast appears to be quite impressive, and the acting is good. But there is only so much that can be done with a bad script. The plot centers on this pregnant girl whose child must be killed, and why, nobody knows. They just needed something to attact the zombies I guess.

To add insult to injury, the 'angels' need to use our carnal weapons, and are quite wimpy. There are some mediocre sound and special effects, but nothing to get overly excited about.

3839073,1,B0021L8V34,"I'm not sure at which point this movie begins its silly descent into pseudo-theology and New Age hectoring, but there is little doubt it reaches its crescendo at the climax as two angels square off on each other after many mystifying scenes.

A renegade angel plummets to earth in the first scene.  He's going off the rez and kicking butt, cutting off his wings and arming himself with some awesome automatic weapons (considering how effective those bullet-proof wings are by another angel later in the film, he should've reconsidered that painful procedure).  Why is he doing this?  Because God has lost faith in mankind and He's looking to wipe them out again...unless a child is born near a remote diner in the middle of nowhere.  And this angel has to protect that child currently gestating in a tough, cynical white trash waitress who smokes during her pregnancy.

Now if you can figure out what the &*#$ is going on in this movie--if you even TRY to figure out what is going on in this movie--you will be a hundred times smarter than the guys who wrote it.  Because it's obvious they don't know.  I'm sure they can tell you what happens, but I have no doubt that they couldn't tell you why...except for their lame New Age message at the end.

God values mercy over rules--even at the expense of his holiness.  We kind of suspect His long-suffering mercy over the whole Jesus thing (who's never mentioned in this film unless it's blasphemy)...but LEGION is here to take that sentiment and turn it into a mind-numbing piece of CGI goofiness.  So...God sent those demons?  Wait...the heavily-armed renegade angel defeats the angel sent by God because God deceived one of them?  Who is on what's side???  Welcome to Hollywood logic.

This film could have been a contender. There were lots of bits of stuff in there that could, with some intelligent writing and a little more thought, have been gelled into an interesting and cohesive film, but sadly, there wasn't and it didn't. Doh!

The good thing that this film did was flush out plenty of religious zealots who want to use words like ""blasphemy"" which is pretty cool. The problem with trying to make an accusation of blasphemy is....

a) The Bible as we know it is a construct of man, assembled over a long period, with events often first written down hundreds of years after they were alleged to happen, then the whole shooting match was looked at by the Church in around the 3rd of 4th century, and the bits they didn't like were thrown away and suppressed. For political and other more worldly purposes.

b) God, being what he is, likes to adopt a noticeable ""hands off"" management style, which means that my opinions on what He thinks, His motivations and His way of looking at the world are as well informed as anyone else's on the entire planet. Any man (or woman) who presumes to tell another one that their view of what God wants/thinks/or anything else, would therefore be an act of heresy and they should immediately stone themselves to death.

c) As that greatest of religious leaders, Father Ted, says.. ""That's the good thing about Religion, it's all so vague and no-one really knows what it's all about. Amen to that.

So in conclusion, this does not purport to be a re-working of the King James Bible, it is merely a sort of Zombie film with an ecclesiastical twist. Personally, I like the idea that super-natural beings can be easily defeated with machine guns. If it wasn't mean to happen like that, God wouldn't have made it that way.",1281916800,,2050,4.557065217391305

LEGION is a glossy studio production built on familiar themes and big-budget action sequences but without heart or emotion. It attempts to create a grand scale despite its remote desert location by using clouds of flies and an army of contorted humans that are possessed by angels. What it doesn't create is any form of tension or suspense, only tedium and tired Horror movie cliches. The few shocking moments are fleeting and exploitative, with no lasting impact left in their wake. LEGION comes close to delivering an interesting plot with deep religious significance, however this is lost along with the lead character's importance, since it is never explained why Charlie was chosen to carry humanity's next savior, or how her child is meant to redeem God's failing creations. For endless amounts of spent artillery and cheap shocks, LEGION will fill an hour-and-a-half, but it is mostly mindless entertainment.

These end of the world flicks are always a hit with me for some reason, especially ones that are more along the lines of horror. I don't know why but I always enjoy them and tend to forgive mishaps more for these. This one while not a perfect movie I s very fun one, especially the first half of the film. Also I am a Tyrese fan so that also helped the film out a lot in my mind, ever since his turn in ""Baby Boy"" I have been a fan. Also any film that has an old lady go crazy and crawl on walls during the trailer is a must see to be honest.

Out in the desert there is a small diner/gas station/auto repair shop where no one would even think is there let alone be a safe haven. But that is what this out of the way place becomes when demons [or so they think] start to appear and are out for blood. In this place are the owner, his son, his cook and waitress and a few motorists that are just passing by [or waiting for their car to be fixed. When old ladies and such start to go crazy and attack people the group starts to panic, especially when all radios and the TV are broadcasting either nothing or warning signals.

Then in comes a stranger with a lot of guns and a plan, keep the pregnant waitress alive, nothing more nothing less. Why you might ask, well because that baby being born is the future of humanity. How do we know that, well because our mystery man is Michael the Archangel who still believes in the human race. He is disobeying God as a legion [hence the name] of angels are sent to kill off the humans and the baby. So this is not only a end of the world flick it is also a horror flick meshed with a survival flick. It is in the scenes were they must survive at this diner that prove to be the best.

Writer director Scott Charles Stewart and writing partner Peter Schink did a good job over all in my opinion with the script especially with the first half to third of this film. Same can be said about the direction the look, feel, and pace of the film is great for the first half to third of the film but starts to loose steam as it goes. While at the diner the film is the strongest when you feel like this is a horror film. After that when it starts to feel more like an end of the world flick it slows down, but still good. Also the effects on this film are real good and I love they way the creatures/angels look.

As far as the acting every one is strong here especially Paul Bettany who plays Michael, I love his look and acting in this film. Of course you know I like Tyrese and he does one of the best and most realistic jobs on this film, I love his characters back story. Lucas Black, Adrianne Palicki, Willa Holland, Kate Walsh, Charles S. Dutton, Jon Tenney, and Dennis Quaid all do great jobs here as do every one else. Another stand out is Kevin Durand as the angel Gabriel who is leading the charge to kill this girl and her baby.

Now before it seems like I am making this out to be the greatest film ever, that is not the case. The film does have plot holes and even at times seems like it does not fit with the biblical themes it is banking on. I would start to list some of these things but that has already been done in many other reviews, a great one being Woopak's review of the film. Speaking of that great review in it he mentions the first Tales from the Crypt film ""Demon Knight"" [one of my favorite films of all time]. I started to think of that and realized that D.K. is a classic biblical influenced film about people trapped in a building, so watch ""Legion"" first if you have yet to see ""Demon Knight"".

Still this is a fun movie and there is a good time to be had with it especially if you like these type of films. Me personally I bought it and I am happy with the purchase, it has some good behind the scenes stuff and special features. So would I recommend this movie to you, yes I would. In fact you may love the film were as I just liked it, different tastes yields different results.",1281052800,,3955,4.069319640564827

3839140,1,B0021L8V34,"This movie is what you get when a bunch of God-forsaken atheists come together to try to make a quick buck out of the subject matter. The title and the theme of the movie have a lot of potential as a serious matter to be pondered over, but the movie turns out nothing short of blasphemy. Production notes in the DVD don't disclose the reasons and intentions of the script-writers, director and producer, all of whom leave us guessing as to why they made this movie. You derive ""entertainment"" out of insulting God and the angels?

The story line is mocks and insults the Christian Faith, especially since it brings up the subject of angels Michael and Gabriel. In a parody of the Incarnation, this movie insults everything from Jesus and his mother and the angels themselves. One may dismiss the the correlation of the Gospel Story if the angels were not introduced in the plot. But, no, they had to play a major part in the movie. Instead of messengers of good news, they're portrayed as destroyers of the human species. The title of the movie mimics the cry of the demoniac as he was healed by Jesus in the Gospels, thus linking this movie as a parody of the Gospel message. In this movie, the angels are portrayed as the bad guys. Angels Michael and Gabriel are seen as also jostling for power to please God (to paraphrase Michael in this movie as he says to Gabriel: ""You gave him {ie. God} what he wanted, I gave him what he needed.""). Besides the selfish human race, who else wants to usurp power and spend all their time lording over others?

Instead of a maiden, the producers saw to it that a trailer trash whore as befitting to be the mother of a baby boy who will save the world from darkness. Does that story line start to sound familiar? By the time the baby is born, you can only wonder how much he will be influenced by his mother's uncontrollable nicotine addiction and her filthy behaviors, unworthy to even be a mother of any child, much less the savior of humanity. Pause. Humanity needs another savior? Wasn't Jesus' teachings and his Sacrifice on the Cross enough? Wait, now what are we watching here, a science fiction movie? Nope. Is this new baby boy going to be the next John Connor of ""Terminator"" series? No, no smart robots in this movie, no robots at all. Once again, the featured baby has to be linked to the Gospel story since ""God"" is explicitly mentioned.

The movie also introduces a St. Joseph character, Jeep, who dotes on the single mother. No complaints about this Jeep character. He'd rather hand-crave a wooden crib for the baby than spend his time fixing cars. St. Joseph was a carpenter. Is this another coincidence of the plot to link the character Jeep with the historical St. Joseph?

Now, comes the angel Michael, who decides to go rogue, falling from heaven like the evil one, but this time with a hearty conscience - to save the baby boy from the ""dogs of heaven"" led by Gabriel. The latter's angels possess humans who try to take out the baby (recall Kind Herod's mass murders in his attempt to find the boy Jesus in the Gospels?). When the possessed humans storm ""Paradise Falls"", you may begin wondering if that scene is inspired by ""Resident Evil"". If insanity doesn't end there, what else needs to be said if anyone rational can see this movie as ""entertainment""? Twisted people must like to see angels fighting. Humans are such destructive creatures, aren't they? Didn't Jesus say that ""a kingdom divided against itself cannot stand""? The producers must have want to see heaven divided, so this must explain why this movie is made in such a way.

There was a line in the movie that says that ""God must be tired of all the BS"" from the human race. This ironic line must be speaking about this very same movie and its evil human producers.

Try this for ""entertainment"":

But first he has to get by Michael with all of his bad-boy guns....

Wait...

You mean guns can kill angels? How is that possible? Never mind. Just let it go. Like everything else. Including anything approaching believability.

So with all that said, you might think I absolutely hated LEGION. And that's probably partially true. The only exception to this would be the special effects which were nicely done, especially the creepy ice cream man who sprouts lengthy arms and legs and crab-walks into a hailstorm of bullets. Oh yes. He dies easily, too.

And there you have it. A movie that suffers because of a horrendously bad script, but has a bit of eye-candy in terms of CGI. If that's all you're looking for, have at it. But don't say I didn't warn you.",1279324800,5,3092,6.308056872037914

A few reviewers said that Christians would find the movie offensive.  I am Christian, and I didn't find the movie to be offensive at all.  It's just a story for God's sake; however, I did find it strange that heavenly angels were so hell-bent (excuse the pun) on being murderous and profane.  That didn't sit well with me.  I understand the wrath of God, but I don't understand the premise and idea here.  It seems the writers were grasping at straws to try and make some sensibility out of the script.  And again, maybe I'm getting too reality-based, because after all this IS just a fictional story, but I would have liked for more than just one angel, out of possibly millions, to find in his/her heart that murder is simply wrong.  One point to make here is that at least they were trying to make sense, unlike a whole ton of other junk that Hollywood spews out on a monthly basis.  You know the kind of movies I am referring to...the ones that make you scratch your head and wonder why they didn't do with the movie what you KNEW they should have done.

Worst movie ever? You bet! The best part was when I was able to return it to the video store.

This is the kind of movie that if you understand only a little about the Christian religion and you have a mistaken view of God, you might think it's a cool movie...  if you also like lame plots, non-sensical twists, stereotypical characters, and protagonists that you hope will lose because you dislike all but one quality about each of them.  In my opinion, there was only one likable character in the whole movie, and his role in the movie inclined me to hate him.

If, on the other hand, you are well-informed about the Christian religion, its portrayal of the nature of God (and angels) is overwhelmingly blasphemous and offensive.

The end is nigh, a child is meant to never be born, and God's most accomplished Angel defies him to do what is right. Most would argue that the plot was horrible, the action was horrible, the script was horrible...but the idea and the main thread of the film, the redeeming qualities of humanity and the inability to give up hope, is what really drives the film. Legion, if you look DEEPER than the surface, asks you too look past the gore, the violence, the CGI spider-like Angel-possessed ice cream man (creepy!!) and think about what is right and what is not: obey blindly because of the authority figure or do what is right in spite of the authority figure? Michael made a choice that was ultimately used to teach God that humanity was still worth keeping around...at least in the film. In reality, we critique the films that would blatantly say ""hey, humanity, you suck"" and label them as ""horrible"", ""disappointing"", ""weak"" while films that are utterly worthless get high praise...this film just has the guts to fictionally show us what we refuse to see: that humanity can be saved, can be helped, if only we'd stop thinking, planning, plotting long enough to look around us and really SEE what's happening...and then CHOOSE to do something to change.",1277337600,2,1769,4.63375796178344

Armed and united by Archangel Michael, a group of strangers becoming unwitting soldiers on the front line of the Apocalypse.  Their mission: protect a waitress and her sacred unborn child from the relentless, bloddy siege of the demonic legion.""

I watched the entire movie and here is the truth of the plot:
 1) God is angry with the world and is seeking to destroy it. He has charged Michael to carry out these plans.  Michael disobeys God and cuts off his wings. Then he goes to a truck stop to protect an unborn child.

 2) God then sends a legion of angels (not demons)to possess ""weak people"" to destroy mankind. One angel-possessed elderly lady uses the f-word and a few other expletives while saying ""all the babies are going to burn"" before she climbs up the ceiling and severely bites a man in the neck.  The fact that these are people are ""angel-possessed"" is spelled out very clearly by Michael and there is no room for interpretation.

 3) After much more carnage God sends Archangel Gabriel to finish the job. Of course our ""hero"" Michael is victorious in the end, and God sees the error of his ways and gives mankind another chance.

cinema can be. During the film I frequently asked myself: Why do these
bad films keep on being made? Why manufacture ""more of the same""? OK,
some women are very nice Willa Holland & Kate Walsh, probably even nicer. And there's the
occasional line by a big actor that tries to deliver us from pain. In
this case, Paul Bettany's. But saving this film is like trying the
""unsink"" the Titanic. Dennis Quaid should be banned from cinemas, like
an alcoholic/ any drug user :).

If I had to get any ""redeeming qualities"", trying hard I'd get the
modest ""philosophical"" dialogues when the willfully opposite characters
speak out their conscience during guards, before ""the evil ones come up
to get them"". And I did feel moderately scared at a couple of times,
thou probably an expensive cinema's sub woofers helped a lot to
fabricate this desired effect. But it was Amazon reviewer Paul Gaita
who really gave me the creeps when he wrote that there may be a sequel
coming...

My favourite character would be Doug Jones. His wicked ice cream vendor
is scary, thou we all know it's just the juxtaposition of ""something
really good, associated to childhood and its easy pleasures"" and well,
""violent hungry dead people at night"" or whichever crap that stuffs our
nightmares. Charles S. Dutton's down to earthiness was also refreshing,
pity his character is dealt with so simply. I liked the trite but
effective ""father's words of wisdom"". Yes, it's been said before, and
way better, but ""Carpe diem"" is never completely put to practice in our

Well, yes.  And so is the case for Dennis Quaid, Charles S. Dutton, Tyrese Gibson, etc.  perhaps there just aren't many scripts form which to choose that draws actors of this quality into a unintentionally  comical dud. But here we are with over two hours of nonsense that may have at its core a good idea but escaped the borders of good taste and character/story development.  Scott Stewart wrote (with Peter Schwink - neither with impressive credentials except for 'unlisted special effects' work in prior works) and directed this plodding CGI mess and even Paul Bettany can't save it.

Going on the prediction that 'when the last angel falls, the fight for mankind begins', Paul Bettany as Michael falls to the earth in Los Angeles, cuts off his black wings, kills a couple of sadistic cops, and steals their vehicle to drive to the desert (apparently in Arizona) where dwells a grumpy Dad (Dennis Quaid) and his son Jeep (Lucas Black) in a little trailer hut cum diner/truck stop.  The reason for the destination is that here lives the very pregnant tacky unmarried young girl Charlie (Adrianne Palicki), cared for by Jeep, who is apparently carrying the infant that will save the world after Armageddon: Percy the cook (Charles S. Dutton) just looks on.  Michael arrives, a lost man (Tyrese Gibson) with a past seeks information about his destination, a cranky couple with daughter (Willa Holland, Jon Tenney, Kate Walsh) complains about everything and the delay in their car repair by Jeep,  and Jeep yearns (it's hard to tell his emotions since his acting ability is minimal) to care for the reluctant Charlie.  Out of a flock of flies and other insects come a crazy possessed old lady (Jeanette Miller) who climbs the ceiling, an ice cream man (Doug Jones) who morphs into a silly CGI creation, and a whole flock of displaced persons who are driven by the need to kill the baby in Charlie's womb.  The rest of the 'story' is pure CGI stuff which becomes almost intolerably boring.

3839248,3,B0021L8V34,"When my wife and I saw the trailers for Legion in theaters (week after week it seemed), we knew it would be better to see the movie on DVD instead of on the big screen.  Both of us have liked Paul Bettany since he appeared in A Beautiful Mind. In Legion, he plays the Archangel Michael with conviction but the story does not give him much in the way of material. His characterization is bland and tired.  He has a great cast to support him, including Dennis Quaid, Charles S. Dutton, Kevin Durand (as Gabriel) and Lucas Black.

Legion is essentially a special-effects film set in the middle of the dessert with humankind facing extinction at the hands of angels.  We don't know why God has decided to eliminate all humans but it is even more puzzling why the unborn child of a waitress, Charlie, (Adrianne Palicki) is fated to be the salvation of humanity.  Although we never know who the father of the child is, Jeep (Lucas Black) is devoted to her. We never learn how or even why the child is significant. The idea of a second virgin birth comes to mind but if God wants all of humanity destroyed why would he allow a savior to be born?  We don't have a clear motivation for Michael going over to the side of the humans. Generally, the story is too incoherent to care what happens.

The action takes place at a diner in the middle of the dessert, something like The Petrified Forest except we have possessed humans instead of gangsters.  There is a cross section of people stuck at the diner representing every kind of stereotype.  The possessed humans who lineup outside the diner bear a close resemblance to zombies, ready to pull one of the humans out of a window to sink their teeth into him.

Legion concludes on an upbeat note with Charlie, Jeep and the newly born child driving away. Hopefully, a sequel will not be in the works.",1274659200,5,1838,4.459701492537313
3839269,5,B0021L8V34,"I am a christian. I wouldnt consider myself a hardcore christian, but I am christian nonetheless. I wasn't sure what to think when I heard the words 'God has lost faith in humanity' but judging from the preview, I had to see this movie.

I wasn't at all disappointed with this movie. Everything about it is amazing!

So the storyline, as you should already know, God has lost faith in humanity and now comes the extermination. God is sending his Angels down to kill of humanity. One angel, or should I say Archangel, is not going to stand for it. Archangel Michael, as well as a group of strangers stand together to fight and to protect humanities only chance of survival, and unborn child. Now how can any of us resist a story like that. If you've read the book of reveltaions, actually even if you haven't read it, you know it contains things we cant even dream of. Legion portrays this very well. Getting down every last detail, down to the swarm of bugs. I rate the storyline a 9/10, only because I am christian and I my belief is that God will never lose faith in humanity.

The acting was great as well. There is a lot of foul language in this movie, but if I were them I would be using those words to. All the actors played their parts amazingly. Paul Bettany, who played Archangel Michael, did a spectacular job and Tyrese Gibson brought a little comedy to the table as well. Just the way he says F*** makes you laugh.

The effects where really nothing to gloat about because I have seen better, but then again, they were simple effects, nothing big like Clash of the Titans or 300 or Alice In Wonderland. In fact, I find it very suprising that it cost $56 million to make this movie. But, for what the effects were they were good.

Overall, I loved this movie. It had its creepy moments and it was full of action. What more can you ask for from a movie. I would deffinetly suggest going to rent it and if you liked it, buy it. It was worth the $20 I spent on it.",1274486400,3,1971,4.287634408602151

3839274,4,B0021L8V34,"The story takes place at a remote diner in the middle of a Western U.S. desert. The town is appropriately named Paradise Falls. It is there a group of unsuspecting people will become humanity's last stand against the most powerful force in the universe: God. He has had enough of mankind, and as with the great flood centuries ago, he's decided to once again wipe out the human race. The only hope is a wayward waitress' unborn child that they must all protect. Lead by the Archangel Michael (Bettany), they must battle legions of possessed people to keep her alive until she gives birth.

This movie was excellent, and was well told and directed. It is not your typical good vs. evil story. The story has a twist which I will not spoil. The special effects are well done and Bettany is quickly becoming one of the more powerful actors on screen. Give it a chance and you will like it.

3839276,2,B0021L8V34,"I so wanted to like this movie. It falls under the slogan ""Don't judge a movie by it's poster"".
The movie has the audacity to be, well frankly ... boring.
Synopsis: God has been disappointed with mankind far too long, so he's sending Angels to kill us all. That my friend is the premise of the movie in a nutshell. Does it succeed in anyway to inspire or thrill? Well, truthfully no. It has a few interesting FX but nothing incredible. I find that the best FX were actually with the angel Michael, his fighting scenes were pretty awesome, so if you really feel like you need to see this movie, go to a Red Box and rent it for a buck, and see if it's worth forking out 20-25 bucks on it.
The actors were a disappointment, I think that thankfully the two actors playing the principle angels were quite good, again I think Michael was better. The woman playing the pregnant girl (she was Sam's girlfriend for you Supernatural fans) seemed to have forgotten how to act, and goes all Sarah Conners circa The Terminator part I at the end, with her puckered lips, and looking out at the vast expanse, and the required voice-over. The guy who plays her ""love interest"" was actually very believable. Then we have two TV actors playing a couple of over the top Yuppies and their surprise, surprise semi-goth daughter. And there are the token African Americans, is Hollywood so racist that they always seem to end up with African Americans with guns or overly religious? And last but not least Dennis Quaid, who seems to go from bad movies to worse.

3839278,2,B0021L8V34,"Oh, it's slam time. Paul Bettany - one of my favorite Brit actors - has charismatic presence, yes he does, but even his brooding, wonderfully world-weary take here cannot save this movie. A worn down looking Dennis Quaid also can't save this movie. LEGION is basically about a badasss angel with a gun and then a dash of the Apocalypse thrown in, and it is not a good movie. The premise proposes that God has gotten fed up, has lost faith in us, and has opted to go all Old Testament. Cue the global extermination as the celestial hordes storm down on humanity (not that we get to see any of that epic stuff).

Instead the key battle takes place at a remote diner in the desert as armies of weak-minded humans are possessed by angels and lay siege on a stranded band of strangers. One of the survivors is a young pregnant waitress and it's her unborn child that the archangel Michael intends to protect. Michael arrives at the diner sporting a cache of heavy firepower and driving a stolen police car, not exactly impressing anyone with his trustworthiness. But this archangel still harbors faith in man and, in some way, any chance of mankind having a future at all hinges on this unborn baby. Michael and the others only have to hold on until the baby is born. Except that the waitress is only eight months along. Ironically, she hadn't even intended to keep the baby. Also testing irony to the breaking point is the diner's name of Paradise Falls. Someone fell off the subtle wagon.

How exactly will this baby save the world? Dunno. The waitress as played by Adrianne Palicki doesn't give us much to root for, and her change of heart regarding the baby seemed almost done by rote. She delivers the baby, and, boom, maternal instincts kick in and it's all ""No, mister, you cannot have this baby!"" or something of the sort. Certainly the film doesn't lay any groundwork or ultimately disclose why this baby or her mother, for that matter, is so relevant. This undermines the story.

This here paragraph is devoted to what's good in the movie. This'll be a short paragraph. Paul Bettany does his best to lend gravitas, but even his skills get bumrushed by an avalanche of poor choices and miscues made by the writers or the director or producer or the dang caterer, for all I know. If you've seen the trailer, you've seen all the good bits. The bit with the creepy mean-spirited old lady who alarmingly skitters up the wall. The bit with Doug Jones's demonic, attenuated ice cream man. These two scenes comprise the film's two good horror jolts, and they happen way too early in the film. The scares afterwards are anything but.

I guess it's only natural that the end of the world - especially this sort in which God has turned his back - would call for plenty of soul-searching. But, damn, this film spends too much time exploring the characters' feelings. And when the screenplay is this incompetent, we're exposed to a pestilence of overcooked angst and dialogue more strained than my belt two hours after I ordered that Big Man's pizza. The film does open interestingly, with Bettany descending to earth, cutting off his wings, absconding with a massive arsenal of guns, and laying a whoopin' on two cops. But then the pace bogs down as the camera shifts to the desert and an interminable five-minute talky talk between Adrianne Palicki and Lucas Black. This tedious exchange blazes a trail for all the following dead spots throughout the film.

But maybe the worst offender is Tyrese Gibson whose character is so stereotypical I couldn't believe he didn't tear up the script. There's actually one scene in which he starts a conversation with ""When I was a shortie..."" Slow your roll, Tyrese.

Parting observations:

- I couldn't help wondering what the point was in the angels possessing weak-minded humans. Why don't they simply come down in all their celestial glory and just wipe us out like we're so many cockroaches? Or perhaps they did do that offscreen, to the rest of the world? Ah, the vagaries of low budgeting...

- Is it me or is Lucas Black's sissified character the only one here with a Southern accent? Even his dad (Quaid) doesn't talk hillbilly.

- I admit, I was sort of impressed when I heard Gabriel's horn ominously blaring, heralding his arrival. But then when Gabriel himself shows up, whoo, what a letdown. I was expecting, I dunno, something more majestic and frightening and less cheesy than some dude in black leather and feathers. Gabriel and Michael, by the way, are the only angels we see in their angel form. This doesn't exactly constitute a horde. I suspect tokenism.

- What has BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER wrought that even angels now employ martial arts?

- Would've been sort of cool to get the Devil's opinion on God's getting his vengeance on. Alas, Old Scratch ain't nowhere to be found, what with the angels doing his dirty work for him.

- Not that I'm calling ""shady editing"" but just how did that snooty mom suddenly end up tied up? Why exactly was she tied up? Dunno.

- Starts like TERMINATOR, ends like TERMINATOR. Some films just wear their blatant rip-offs on their sleeves.

- If God had seen this film, there would've been another commandment.",1274227200,3,5198,4.672866520787746

3839303,1,B0021L8V34,"A great poster does not a movie make.  I love angel movies.  But only a few titles have really satisfied.  THE BISHOP""S WIFE with Cary Grant comes to mind.  WINGS OF DESIRE certainly connected on a deeper, spiritual level asking what it means to be human.  The idea of an angel identified in scripture with a new identity outside of any known theological creed certainly holds possibilities.  But alas, LEGION is not a movie that provokes the mind or excites the senses.  I like  to recommend titles for consideration that are a cut above the norm; that have something to recommend.  But when something so rich in promise, and with a great poster, nosedives, it too must be pointed out as a public service.  It pains me to post a movie review here as a warning lest you be tempted into buying or renting.

The thing that really bothered me - aside from the notion of never being able to retrieve the lost time of watching this movie - is that the idea of an angel challenging God's disappointment with humanity is rich with possibilities.  But to visualize the archangel Michael and God's right-hand messenger Gabriel in roles that are bizarrely inane is almost blasphemous.

And the other fatal error?  The movie is not remotely frightening, suspenseful, horrific but is instead talky and -- sin of sins -- boring.  The latter is the unforgivable sin of movies.  I hold the writers Peter Schink and Scott Stewart (who also directed) responsible and like to imagine them in movie purgatory bound to an endless screening of this film.

Legion is a big jumble, a total mish-mash of Angel mythology,the birth of a new saviour of mankind, and Armaggeddon. But thankfully not the Ben Affleck Armaggeddon(LOL).

The plot is hard to decipher but I'll give it the old college try. Once again, God is ticked off at the wicked ways of the world, and since he already did the flood and the Noah's Ark thing, he sends his angels to wipe out mankind. The angels led by Gabriel take over the minds of weak minded humans turning the human hosts into bobble-headed, big-mouthed, crab-like wall and ceiling crawling demons. The major battle of Armaggeddon is to be fought at an out of the way greasy spoon diner in the desert run by Dennis Quaid, who looks like he was on quaidludes.(thanks Jason)  The reason for the diner?  One of the hash-slingers is pregnant with the new messiah and God sends his angels to make sure the child is never born. Huh???  The last time that happened, Mary and Joseph rode into town on a donkey and stayed in a filthy stable where Mary gave birth to Jesus until they had to skip town when King Herod put out a warrant for the newborn.

To continue the movie--to the rescue of the diners comes the archangel Michael who disagrees with the big boss's orders and he brings with him enough weaponry to fight the Iraq war.

Here's what I thought about the movie itself.

Unexpected depth and resonance. This reminded me very much of the first movie of the ""Terminator"" series, which I saw during its initial theater run: a morality tale unrecognized by its contemporary reviewers; dealing with deep issues of values, morals, and cultural mores; well acted and presented, with some aspects that were a bit ""overblown"".

I think the TV commercials didn't position the movie correctly, but given the subject matter and the film itself, they probably did the best they could, and I really can't think of a better way to have marketed it.

That's unfortunate, because I think relegating this to the ""horror"" or ""teen slasher"" dustbin would be a real shame.

The fact is, if you hold this movie up to classic films, obviously it's going to fall short. If you hold it up to other campy films of it's kind, it's going to fit perfectly. The acting is sub-par, the plot is obviously pretty ridiculous, and the ending is predictable (for the most part.) Okay, well name me another campy film that doesn't have those qualities?

I, myself, am personally not interested in going to the theaters to see movies that are so called ""works of art."" If I wanted to see a work of art, I'd go to the museum. I go to the movies to see big explosions, elaborate fight scenes, and crazy and unbelievable storylines. So, if you're like me, ignore all the negative feedback on this movie and check this one out, I'm sure you'll be pleasantly surprised.

Bettany excels at everything he does. The rest of the cast and the plot were totally forgettable. The plot between Michael the archangel (Bettany), Gabriel the archangel and God, could have been explored way, way deeper and make for a more interesting movie. Instead we are treated to forgettable B movie firefights, cliche scenes between a mother and her rebellious teenage daughter, a guy in love with a slutty chick whose life is another cliche of bad choices and your typical and predictable scene where a guy says a cheesy dirty harry wannabe line, lights something on fire and blows himself up along with some baddies. Bettany's performance and how seriously he takes his work in every single scene as short or as menial as they might be, is the only thing that saves this movie from zero stars.

This movie reminded me a lot of the movie DOGMA. The plot in both is almost identical.

3839383,4,B0021L8V34,"If you're still with me after reading that ridiculous description, then you might just enjoy Legion! It pretty much sums up this entire movie. A fallen angel, Michael, comes to Earth after disobeying God's direct order. God has lost faith in humanity, but Michael hasn't. He robs an armory in LA, stockpiles weapons up the wazoo, and heads to a roadside diner in the New Mexico desert for an impending showdown with God's forces, who have been sent to possess the bodies of the weak and purge the living. He is there to guard the life of an unborn child, the savior of humanity.

Beyond that, you don't have to waste too many braincells following the plot. It is not a thinking man's movie or a deep philosophical ponderer about the nature of divinity, faith, or obedience. The movie poster tells you all you need to know: Michael is holding an H&K MP5 SMG and a survival knife, and basically kicks demon arse. Legion's really just an apocalyptic zombie action flick with angels thrown in, but a slickly-produced and stylish one. There are some excellent shots and sets.

But despite the general opinion that this was a bad movie, I had a good time. You can't take the film seriously. It is immensely campy and rife with B-movie/horror cliches and overused movie tropes like isolated diners, possessed grannies/children/ice cream truck drivers, corny famous last words that would make Arnold proud, and cheeseball slow-motion shots like a diving baby catch. All the characters are inconsequential zombie dog food and just provide movie filler. Parts of it are also reminiscent of T2 (shot of abandoned playground) and the video game Fallout 3's wasteland setting, especially the diner's name (Paradise Falls) and the voice on the radio.

3839388,3,B0021L8V34,"This movie probably would have gotten a solid four stars if it were not for one particular actor. But first let's talk about the movie.

It's your basic hell on earth, apacolypse sort of thing except instead of Satan, God is destroying the world because he has lost faith in mankind. (who could blame him really..hurt locker for best film? I kid I kid) The Archangel Michael however betrays God and sides with the humans. In the desert at a lonely diner, a group of hodge-podge people are grouped together. Of note is an 8 month pregnant girl and a foolish mechanic in love with her. The girl's unborn child is supposed to be the savior of mankind. I didn't really understand that part, I guess it's supposed to be the second coming of Jesus? I don't think they ever came out and said that but that's what I took from it. Anyways, God sends his angels to try and kill the baby by first possessing humans and then sending the other archangel Gabriel to do the job.

Now, for the most part the story kept my interest. A lot of people complained because of the amount of time spent with dialog and there wasn't enough ACTION!!!!...I don't really know what is wrong with todays reviewers but I think they have the attention span of a 5 year old. For all the faults in this movie, I never once thought it was boring or drawn out too much. I thought the plot was believable and not too contrived for this type of movie. And besides one actor, I thought the acting was pretty good overall. Paul Bettany (Archangel Michael) and Adrianne Palicki (Charlie/Pregnant Girl) did really well and Dennis Quaid played his ultimately unimportant part well.

Now, unfortunately the bad acting came from one actor. And even more unfotunate was that his character was one of the most important characters. The foolish mechanic that is in love with Charlie the pregnant girl is played by Lucas Black. Who let this guy on a movie set? When he was younger he could act pretty well...for a 10 year old. Apparently he hasn't developed any since then. He has one of the worst southern accents I have ever heard. (which is funny because Dennis Quaid, his father in this film, doesn't really have on at all) I don't know if this was his attempt at doing a southern accent, or if that is how he actually talks...but noone should ever cast him in a redneckish character EVER again...or he needs to relearn how to talk. It was so bad it continually took me out of the movie. I found myself hoping that eventually someone would kill him. I mean the lovable cook was killed trying to save that stupid woman...why couldn't he get runover by that icecream truck? I'm sure the guy can act...but everytime he opened his mouth or tried to say anything that was supposed to be profound I found myself shuddering.

All in all this movie isn't that bad. It's not going to be your favorite movie but it is entertaining enough. However, it could have been a whole lot better if they had just cast the dumb mechanic as someone else. Hell I'm pretty sure Keanu could have done better than this.",1268956800,8,3048,4.496389891696751
3839389,1,B0021L8V34,"Legion (Scott Stewart, 2010)

The obvious antecedent for Legion, Scott Stewart's feature debut, is The Prophecy, Gregory Widen's much more enjoyable cult hit from fifteen years ago. I would submit, however, that a much more interesting idea for an antecedent is Kaw, a Sci-Fi Channel Original Movie from 2007 directed by Sheldon Wilson, starring Sean Patrick Flanery, one of Hollywood's most intriguing screen derailments, and Stephen McHattie, one of Canada's finest acting talents. Flanery, back in the days of Suicide Kings and The Grass Harp, looked like he was really going somewhere. Than came The Boondock Saints, which should have been the movie that catapulted Flanery (and similarly intriguing costar Norman Reedus) into the A list. Life was grand for Sean Patrick Flanery in 1999. And then... nothing. Flanery has since been involved in some of the worst pieces of celluloid to hit the screen--The Insatiable, Body Shots, Demon Hunter. And McHattie? He makes everything he's in worth watching (including Kaw). It just seems like no one notices.

And here we have Legion, and Dennis Quaid paired with Charles S. Dutton, who might as well be Flanery and McHattie respectively. You can even plant Quaid's turn for the worse in 1999, though Any Given Sunday (an underrated film by any measure, Oliver Stone's best work since The Hand) was supposed to be Quaid's comeback, in the same way Boondock Saints was supposed to (and did) revitalize the career of Willem Dafoe. With the turn of the millennium, Quaid made Frequency (painfully mawkish) and Traffic (as overrated as Any Given Sunday is underrated); with the exception of Far from Heaven, an aberration in the careers of all involved, Quaid's output in the naughties has alternated between the hysterical and the horrendous. He appeared in three movies in 2009, and all three appeared on scattered worst of the year lists (Horsemen, G. I. Joe, and Pandorum). Rightfully so; they were all dreadful. Dutton, on the other hand, has quietly built himself one of Hollywood's more impressive resumes, from Menace II Society to American Violet. Yes, he makes a misstep every once in a while (Secret Window, for example), but like McHattie, in general, Dutton is worth watching every time he appears in a movie. Legion is an unfortunate exception to the rule.

Legion's plot has much more in common with Kaw than it does with The Prophecy, as well, in that where Widen used the idea of the war in Heaven coming to Earth as a platform to examine some of religion's more interesting questions, Stewart is only interested in making a people-trapped-by-something-in-a-diner flick. And I guess if all you want is a people-trapped-by-something-in-a-diner flick, this one delivers the goods (though Kaw is the better film by a country mile). The people in question include the diner's owner (Quaid) and his son (Lucas Black, older than he was in American Gothic but still playing the same guy); the fry cook (Dutton) and waitress (Adrianne Palicki from TV's Friday Night Lights), the latter of whom is pregnant; a family whose car broke down on the road (all three also TV actors--The Closer's Jon Tenney, Grey's Anatomy's Kate Walsh, and The O. C.'s Willa Holland); and a Las Vegan (Tyrese Gibson from the Transformers franchise) who stopped in for a pack of smokes at the wrong time. They are joined first by a nice old lady named Gladys (Norbit's Jeannette Miller, the only good thing about the movie) who turns into a flesh-eating monster, and then a guy who claims to be the archangel Michael (Inkheart's Paul Bettany), who aims to save the waitress from a host of angels who are coming to kill her baby. Well, not angels really, but normal folks who have been possessed by angels and turned into zombies. Or something. In any case, everyone's trying to survive long enough to get this kid born, because the kid is the saviour of all humanity.

At least, I think that's how it goes. Not that it really matters; five minutes after you finish watching this movie, you will have safely forgotten pretty much everything about it. Bettany is as wooden as they get. Quaid turns in his usual post-Far from Heaven performance. Dutton is, as usual, worth watching, but there's not nearly enough of him, and Miller's part lasts all of two or three wonderful minutes. Would that the rest of the movie were anything like it.

Stewart is currently filming an adaptation of Min-woo Hyung's Priest with Bettany in the role of Ivan Isaacs. I am terrified at the thought. ",1268697600,13,4507,4.923684210526316

Legion certainly has its moments and could have very easily been an amazing film. It has two major components that keep it from being one. 1. Its premise is completely contradicting and absurd 2. It has no idea what kind of movie it wants to be.

The premise is that God has lost faith in all of us and has sent his angels down to earth to wipe us out. By wipe us out, I mean brutally murder us all and using adolescently foul language while doing so. It's kind of like Dogma meets Schindler's List. I'm not kidding, that's really it. Oh, but if this woman's child who will be born out of wedlock, is in fact born - then we will all be saved... right.

By saying ""it has no idea what kind of movie it wants to be""; I mean that it has so many different thematic elements, that it's almost confusing for us as to which human emotion we are supposed to react with. Are we supposed to be emotionally moved, or terrified, or laugh-out-loud? At one point we are given honest, gut wrenching, Oscar worthy performances, and then we are given the most juvenile, profanity filled clichs and one-liners.

I can appreciate what the filmmakers were trying to do comedic-ally with the film, but they fail in nearly every scene. They want to create suspense and action with comedy lurking in the shadows. The best example of what they were aiming for would be Signs; which perfected this tact flawlessly. Legion goes over-board with the comedy and it takes us completely out of the moment. There's too much of it, it's used at the wrong moments, and it's entirely the wrong breed of humor altogether.

For example, there is one moment in the film where we have spent a long time admiring a particular character for his good behavior and positive attitude. Rather than give him something clever or heroic to say to the Angel who's about to slay him, his response is diminished to a flashy ""F**k You!"" Don't get me wrong, I'm not a prude and profanity does not bother me; unless it's being used to just be used. This was tasteless, unoriginal and the character would never say it.

Come to think of it, nearly every character in the film at some point has some cheesy one-liner with a strong slur attached to it. Why? How are we supposed to be invested in the suspense and the seriousness of the situations at hand, when we are constantly being taken back to fifth grade gym class?

Paul Bettany stars as the Lord's faithful Angel Michael. Thank God he's in it (no pun intended), because his performance is the main attraction. He was terrific and more than convincing that he dropped out of the sky with a purpose: to save mankind.

Michael has faith in us and has defied God and will do everything in his power to keep an unborn child from being slaughtered. The child's mother is Charlie (Adriane Palicki), and we get the feeling that she's a bit of a slut; so why she is chosen to bare this child is beyond me. Her character has no arc, or moment of redemption, at least that I saw.

And on the subject of her being `chosen' to bare this child - if God wants us all dead, then why would he care if this child was born? It's his orders that send all of the angles from heaven to annihilate us (specifically this child), so why would he allow this to even be a possibility? You can take it a step further and ask yourself why he never stops Michael; surely he knew Michael would defy him. Movies in the past have worked because God allows certain things to pan out. But the fact that he would wish for something to be carried out, but allow something to contradict it - makes no sense at all! The film does wrap everything up in the end and it wasn't as bad as it could have been, but is still far from plausible (meaning related to religion - not science).

The God I know loves us and would not have angles come down from heaven, possess people, and then brutally murder them while using harsh language. Yes, there was the great flood, but that was far more civil than this and let's not forget that the rainbow is a symbol of his covenant with us, that he will never give up on us again (see Genesis). My God is not one to go back on his word either.

There are some really cool action sequences that were filmed beautifully and all the actors did the best with what they had to work with. Charles S. Dutton was outstanding in particular. I'm not sure why Lucas Black's character has an accent and Dennis Quaid's doesn't - being his father, but they both did great jobs too.

Had the filmmakers taken their project more seriously and not made such a mockery out of having an old lady turn into a monster and crawl around on the ceiling; or not had a creepy kid with a knife doing things that far too many creepy kids with knives have done in the past; then it would have been better. If they wanted to scare us, they could have; they almost do. If they wanted us to be on the edge of our seats, they could have; we are - until we break out laughing at some ridiculous line like, ""He doesn't look like any policeman I ever saw ... even one from L.A.""",1268352000,4,5385,4.380761523046092
3839431,5,B0021L8V34,"When I went to see this movie, I was going just for Paul Bettany. What I wasn't expecting was how great the movie actually was. I seriously don't get why people do not like this movie. The effects were great, the story was amazing, and it was nowhere NEAR blasphemous, and the acting was superb! Critics gave this movie a bad review, but like most other times, they were wrong. I would recommend this movie to anyone. I'm getting it as soon as it comes out!

3839432,2,B0021L8V34,"LEGION begins with a young girl explaining how her mother's belief in God evolved over time.  Before her divorce, the mother believed in a loving and forgiving God (we can assume the one who gave the world Jesus).  After her husband left, though, the mother spent more time talking about the God of the Old Testament, the fire-and-brimstone, flood the earth, look-at-me-the-wrong-way-and-I'll-turn-you-to-a-pillar-of-salt God.  The mom couldn't explain the change, other than to guess that maybe God just got tired of all the ... um ... cow feces.  I smiled when I heard this, because it sounded like a joke to me, but the resulting movie actually takes it pretty seriously.

Because God is angry again.  Humanity has let him down for the last time, and he's not only turned his back on everyone, he's also unleashed the hordes of heaven to possess the weak who will then prey on the strong, mad cow-style.  Oh, wait, not only that, but he's ordered his best gun -- the archangel Michael, played with thundering quietude by Paul Bettany -- to personally kill the unborn child of Charlie, a beautiful short order cook at a diner called Paradise Falls (a play on words that continued to assure me that the film was half-kidding).  This diner is stuck way out in the middle of Nevada, nowhere near any falls, and the forces of evil -- wait, I mean, misapplied good -- begin to converge there and terrorize the diner's employees and its handful of customers.

Lucky them, Michael thinks God has burned one too many bushes, and he decides to protect the child.  Thus we have our movie.  A showdown between someone defying the very embodiment of morality in an act of ... morality.  Depending on what you think of the concept of God, you might find this movie baffling or highly insulting.  They say God works in mysterious ways, but this movie adds a horrendous petulance to God's mystery.  He has thousands of angels surround the diner, but they mostly run around and get shot, and then everyone rests for about fifteen minutes.  Michael hints at some vague rules, but they are as clear as the unborn child's status as Man's Last Hope.  What's clear?  It only takes about four people with automatic weapons to hold off the hordes of heaven.  Turns out the Bible might have exagerrated all that.

The only time the movie has any juice is when Gabriel -- God's Golden Boy -- comes down to personally take care of the child.  He does a very poor job, as you can imagine, but it does provide the opportunity to watch some much needed action as the two do battle and discuss what's best for God.  ""You're giving God what he wants,"" Michael says (chin kick! wing slice!).  ""But I'm giving him what he needs!""  Close your eyes, and you can almost imagine that it's a well-exercised gay couple arguing about how to raise their child.  Or maybe I've been watching too much MODERN FAMILY these days.

The point being: this movie is not just silly, it's also weirdly dull.  Say what you will about the acting (not bad at all), the dialogue (hammy, but sincere), or the directing (rote).  What's ultimately the fatal flaw in this film is the plot.  This, folks, is what happens when God throws an Apocalypse, and Satan doesn't show up.",1267574400,24,3219,4.659574468085107

The old lady in the diner scene might have been lifted from IT, the rest of the movie was lifted from something that rhymes with IT. Whoever really wrote this garbage should be assigned to the ninth circle of the inferno.  The big guy doesn't like us anymore?  No wonder, he's got an English accent in this movie, as do his angels.

3839435,1,B0021L8V34,"This movie, in terms of story-line and imagery, resembles both Terminator and Night Of The Living Dead.  Terminator in that at one point, early in the movie, Michael emerges from a firey hole blown in the side of a building.  Night Of The Living Dead in that when rank and file angels come to Earth, instead of having their own bodies, they posses humans.  Once they posses a human, they kill other humans by bitting them to death, they also disjoint their bodies so that they resemble giant spiders.

I'm sorry, but I have probelms with any movie, that is based around the fact that God deosn't like humans any more.  This movie was just badly written from start to end.  For instance, it is never explained why rank and file angels posses people, while archangels, like Michael and Gabrelle, have their own bodies.  It is also never explained by why angels disjoint the bodies they posses.

You should watch this movie knowing one thing, its a Zombie movie, plain and simple.  A zombie movie that thinks its more than what it really is.  If you want to watch a good movie that involves rebelious angels, I recommend The Prophecy.",1265155200,6,1131,4.61
3839436,3,B0021L8V34,"Upset with mankind's direction and having promised to never flood the Earth again, God sends down his legion of angels to wipe the slate clean and start all over in ""Legion.""  Standing in His way is Michael the Archangel (Paul Bettany), who still has faith in humanity.

So how does Michael plan on preventing the destruction of mankind?  He believes that the birth of a child in a sleepy little diner in Paradise Falls, NM is the key.  If the child is born, there will be hope for humanity.  Why?  That's just one of the many plotholes that are never resolved in this film.

A small group has gathered at the diner, whether by chance or destiny, that will eventually be charged with assisting Michael in the protection of Charlie (Adrianne Palicki), the future mother of the mysterious child of hope.  The group includes Bob Hanson (Dennis Quaid), a widowed nonbeliever, and his son Jeep (Lucas Black), who feels the need to watch over Charlie even though the baby isn't his and Charlie has no interest in being his girlfriend.  Also in the group is Percy Walker (Charles S. Dutton), the diner's one-armed cook, Kyle Williams (Tyrese Gibson), a mysterious father en route to meet his son, and the Anderson family (Kate Walsh, Willa Holland, Jon Tenney), who has broken down and are waiting for their vehicle to be fixed.

All of these characters appear to have met at the diner for a purpose, and we are given hints of all of their respective lives, but not enough to really allow the viewer to really undestand where any of them are coming from.

Granted, this film works best as an action film and no in-depth explanation is usually needed for supporting characters in such a film, but the premise of ""Legion"" cries for more information to make it work.

Once the core cast (excepting Michael) is in place, an elderly woman enters the diner and tells Charlie that her future child will burn.  She then attacks one of the Anderson family and takes on the rest of the group.  Her dispatch in one of the funniest moments in the film.

Next, Michael arrives with a ton of weapons.  He tells the group to prepare for the first major wave of attacks from God's forces.  These forces take the form of possessed humans.  Then Gabriel the Archangel (Kevin Durand) comes to finish off God's business.

Can Michael change God's mind?  You'll have to sift through the ninety plus minutes of ""Legion"" to find out.

As stated already, the film's premise begs for more explanation.  What's so special about this baby?  If God is really upset with humanity, why does He allow Michael to stand in His way?  These and other questions leave with the viewer when the film is over.

As strictly an action/horror film, ""Legion"" works pretty good.  The special effects are excellent, and I was particularly fond of the battle between Gabriel and Michael.  There's also a decent amount of gore.

In the end, however, ""Legion"" comes across as a film attempting to be a thinking man's action yarn and fails.  It's one of those films that you watch on stations like TBS when there isn't much else on television.  It isn't terrible, but it isn't good enough to warrant owning once the DVD hits the shelves.

Mildly recommended to action fans.",1264723200,4,3217,4.660746003552398
3839437,4,B0021L8V34,"God has lost faith in humanity, something that hasn't happened since the days of Noah. But instead of a flood, He has sent down a legion of angels, who possess the bodies of weak-minded people, turning them into ... certainly not demons, but then again, there's nothing angelic about these people, so maybe there's no other way to describe them. Anyway, it seems the only one who has kept the faith is the archangel Michael (Paul Bettany), who directly disobeys God by protecting what he was sent to destroy: A pregnant young waitress named Charlie (Adrianne Palicki), whose child was prophesized to be humanity's salvation. Upon finding her in a middle-of-nowhere New Mexico diner - named, appropriately, Paradise Falls - Michael leads a stranded group of strangers in an apocalyptic battle against the angels, who descend in droves.

What I find fascinating is that, for a film that comes across as nothing more than a violent, gory supernatural thriller, ""Legion"" tells a thoroughly absorbing story, one that, oddly enough, sends a message more hopeful and satisfying than the one sent by the duplicitous ""The Book of Eli."" I suspect few will latch onto this, since more time is spent on bloody shootouts and cornball dialogue; a basic shot consists of Bettany toting heavy artillery while someone over his shoulder swears loudly. Another basic shot shows a possessed person transforming hideously, and yes, this includes the overhyped scene of the old woman in the diner. And yet, in spite of all this, the subtexts are there, and there are moments of compelling character development.

Consider the relationship between Charlie and her boyfriend, a simple but decent mechanic named Jeep (Lucas Black); he wants to provide for her despite not being the father of her child, which she finds difficult to understand since she doesn't believe herself to be all that good of a person. She has no plans for the future. She contemplated an abortion, and even in her eighth month of pregnancy, she smokes. ""Why do you have so much faith in me?"" she asks Jeep, as if to suggest that it's wrong to care for someone who doesn't have it together. ""Am I another one of your lost causes?"" Jeep then leaves, refusing to indulge a woman who spends every moment feeling sorry for herself.

Another important relationship is examined. Jeep and his father, Bob (Dennis Quaid), haven't been getting along too well lately, although we quickly learn that Bob is really not a bad guy - he just doesn't want his son making the same mistakes he made, mistakes that left him without a wife in a poor desert town working a dead-end job. Although he has difficulty showing it, he sees the good in Jeep and wants him to put it to better use than fixing cars in a rusty garage.

From Michael's point of view, Jeep is a sign that, in spite of wars, injustice, bigotry, greed, and waste, humanity is indeed worth saving. But it won't be an easy fight; even if Charlie's child manages to be born, it will still be vulnerable to the archangel Gabriel (Kevin Durand), leader of the angel army on Earth. Unlike Michael, he believes that if God gives an order, it should never, ever be questioned. Needless to say, he and Michael are now enemies, although one gets the sense that, deep down, Gabriel wants to side with Michael.

I'm probably in the minority here, but I think that there are deeper aspects to ""Legion."" I also think that they redeem the disappointing screenplay, parts of which seem to have been written by a potty-mouthed sixteen-year-old. Some of the worst dialogue is given to Quaid, who at times portrays his character as nothing more than a country/western stereotype. And then there's Charles S. Dutton as a God-fearing veteran with a hook for a hand, who at one point recalls his father's words of wisdom about dying before waking up. It wasn't profound by any means, but the fact that he tried to make it seem like it was caught my attention.

""Legion"" is not a great movie, and will never be seen as one. But I do think it's better than some have suggested. It tells a Christ-inspired fable that consistently kept me interested, and in spite of some bad dialogue, ridiculous action sequences, and overly gory special effects, it had surprisingly good depth of character. Its greatest accomplishment was its ability to tell a hopeful story without having to cheat at the last second, which is more than I can say for Denzel Washington's latest movie. Keep in mind, however, that this is coming from the guy who loved the critical flop ""Knowing"" and hated the much praised ""Babel,"" so maybe my priorities aren't yet straight when it comes to spiritual parables.",1264550400,177,4652,4.779850746268656

If you can somehow look passed the several plot-holes and forget all the unanswered questions then you may find yourself enjoying the movie.
