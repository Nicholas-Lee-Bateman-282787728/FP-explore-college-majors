Also, though, it portrays the special unique-ness of the wonderful Japanese culture. The nudity is very tasteful and naturally beautiful. It is a very real portrayal of the youthful journey of a young Canadian woman in search of herself while wanting to remain true to herself. The Japanese boyfriend is gorgeous and quite charming.",1489104000,,496,4.9879518072289155

8733689,5,B015I108C0,"This does not follow the book exactly, but it is based on the author's life experience.  I was deeply moved and think about this still even though I saw it a few weeks ago.  I think it was well acted and I connected with both leads.  It's a good story and quite surprising in a number of ways.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes quality films with unpredictable story lines.",1460764800,4,383,4.277777777777778

The film is in many ways like the film Amelie (with Audrey Tatou). The main character is named Amelie (she is played by Pauline Etienne)and she has the same round face and pixie haircut that Tatou had. But this film stands on its own.

The only info Ill provide you  and this is not a spoiler (which I hate)  is that 20 year-old Amelie was born in Japan but her parents moved her to Belgium when she was only 5. She always wanted to return to Japan and so she buys a one-way ticket and plans to make a living teaching French to Japanese. All this you learn in the first three minutes of this 100 minute film. From then on you should know NOTHING in advance. Well, you should know one thing. There is female frontal nudity in the film  but its tastefully done.

The film was funded by both the Belgian Govt, The Quebec (Canada) government and the French Government. It is in French and Japanese (and=d some English)  with east to read English subtitles.

I also loved the score and Ill try to seek out the soundtrack.

If Etienne does not seduce you with her charms, Ill be most surprised. Youll also be surprised at the journey she takes and how it plays out.
Honestly, Id give this film six stars if I could.

There are no bonus features on the DVD except for trailers for other First Run Features releases.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
