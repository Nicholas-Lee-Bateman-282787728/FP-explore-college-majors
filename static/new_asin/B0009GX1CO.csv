2290093,4,B0009GX1CO,"This is a very good movie.  I can't help but wonder why it has basically been forgoten over time.  Scarecrow stars Al Pacino and Gene Hackman very early in their highly successful careers.  They play two drifters who meet and decide to travel around with each other for a while before opening a carwash together in Pittsburgh.  The film is totally character driven.  Although both Pacino and Hackman's characters are loners, they have very different personalities.  Eventually they come to depend on each other.  The chemistry between Pacino and Hackman is magnetic.  The situations they find themselves keep the story ingaging and moving.  This is a well made film with two of the finest actors in the business.  It is a must see for Pacino and Hackman fans and all together an excellent film.",974678400,11,794,4.858208955223881

2290123,4,B0009GX1CO,"On one hand, you could easily dismiss this movie as a Poor Man's Midnight Cowboy, and you'd be right because it really is very similar, but that would be doing a huge disservice to the performances of Hackman and Pacino, especially Pacino.
Truly, it's their strong performances that bolster up a movie that, by now, many have seen before.  So if you like harrowing tales of friendship under duress, or if you especially liked Midnight Cowboy, or are a fan of either the two leading men, give this a rent.",1420329600,,504,4.6

2290158,5,B0009GX1CO,"This 1973 film is a blast from the past when a good movie was made by talent, story and film. There are no special effects, no computers, only a good story line and two great actors. The plot starts off slow and almost nonsensical but eventually plays out into a series of dramatic events, but ultimately you are left hanging with an uncertain ending. The two characters meet up early in the movie and take you along on their rambling crusade to Pittsburgh where they plan to open a car wash. It doesn't sound like the most thrilling of plots, but their grand scheme is met with hardship and sadness, which ultimately tie the two characters together in an emotional plight.",1372636800,,673,4.570247933884297

This is true film making when the acting skill was imperative along with a real story that hits home with regard to real life and the human condition.  I saw this film when it was made, even though I was very young I was quite startled and emotional about the main characters and their plight. Now all these years later I just can't believe how it still affects me deeply.  Only now, I can see other subtle qualities to this story and film like it's some aged wine, getting better with time!!!

2290162,4,B0009GX1CO,"It's not one of the best movies ever made, but watching Pacino and Hackman together is a joy in itself. The film was a little grainy, but it was made 39yrs. ago.",1353715200,,161,4.0625
2290163,4,B0009GX1CO,I caught this billboard on the Warner Bros. studios while watching the film Blazing Saddles with Mel Brooks and it caught my eye so I looked it up and was quite surprised by the synopsis. So I will try to find a copy of it.,1350432000,,223,3.977777777777778
2290164,5,B0009GX1CO,This movie is one of the best films i have ever seen. Pacino and especially Hackman are at their best. I remember almost everybody in the theater had teary eyes at the end. Maaybe that's why it's so overlooked. WATCH IT.,1337472000,,220,4.390243902439025

2290177,4,B0009GX1CO,"The story of Max and Lion is affecting, interesting, often funny, occasionally bruising. But the practice of squeezing wide-screen movies onto the standard TV format for videotape does a terrible disservice to the movie's excellent photography. I only hope that the DVD is letterboxed.",1277769600,,285,5.5
2290178,5,B0009GX1CO,"Scarecrow is a film about human longing, change, and growth. Gene Hackman plays Max, a cynical ex-con who just wants to get to Pittsburgh, and start a car wash business. While walking along the side of the road, hoping to hitch a ride to his destination, Max happens upon Francis (played with deft emotional poignancy by Al Pacino). Francis is also hitch-hiking, trying to get back to Detroit, to re-unite with the spouse that he abandoned when she got pregnant.

This movie moves along at a leisurely pace, as Max and Francis gradually become friends, despite their very different personalities. The two men become embroiled in several misadventures along their journey, even getting put in a prison farm for a month. The prison stint sorely tests Max and Francis' friendship. But, both men discover that the loyalty they develop to each other, transcends the chaos that threatens to tear these two pals apart.

Scarecrow was made back when movies with intense character studies, were much more common than they are now. And this film is among the best made in the 70s, regarding the complexity of the main characters. Gene Hackman is superb as the world-weary, cantankerous Max. Al Pacino gives one of the best performances of his career, as the cheerful, yet achingly vulnerable Francis.

If you like films that have plenty of substance, intriguing characters, and splendid acting, then you owe it to yourself to see Scarecrow.",1261958400,3,1430,4.97489539748954
2290179,3,B0009GX1CO,I first saw this movie when it came out. I thought then that the two actors did a remarkable job portraying two totally opposite charaters thrown together by circumstance. As their friendship grew and changed both of them in minute ways the drama increased. The ending is both touching and sad but realistic. Watching it again after over thirty years it still moved me.,1257724800,3,369,4.78125
2290180,4,B0009GX1CO,"Gene Hackman and Al Pacino star in this amiable but meandering buddy road picture.  The pair meets while hitchhiking in California.  Pacino has been drifting and now is making his way to Detroit to reunite with his wife and child, the latter of whom he has never met before; Hackman is a former con who has been saving money and is now heading to Pittsburgh to open a car wash.  The duo becomes fast friends and decides to go into business together.  Unfortunately, they run into trouble at every turn.

""Scarecrow"" is an interesting movie - the kind that only could have been made in the early 1970s.  Hackman and Pacino are in fine form; this picture was Pacino's first since his breakthrough in ""The Godfather"" and only his fourth movie overall.  I think it demonstrates his career-long willingness to take on intriguing roles in less commercial faire.  ""Scarecrow"" has a lot of quirky humor and situations, with amusing cameos by Eileen Brennan and Ann Wedgeworth.  The picture was largely overlooked at the time, although it somewhat surprisingly won the Palm d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival.  It does have the kind of nihilistic feel that the Cannes jury often likes in other American winners, such as ""Wild at Heart"" and ""Taxi Driver.""

The movie, though, doesn't hold together very well in tone or plot.  There are some undeniably touching scenes that take advantage of the genuine friendship between the two men, but it gets lost among the quirkier aspects of the plot, such as Hackman doing an admittedly very funny strip-tease in a bar.  The film has much to offer and is certainly worth a look, although its slow and somewhat erratic pace will turn off some viewers.",1257033600,,1679,4.768166089965398
2290181,3,B0009GX1CO,"This is one of those little-seen gems of '70s American cinema that always seem to pop up (although maybe it's no longer accurate to say this film is little-seen, since it's been on DVD for three years).  With films like this, it's always tempting to cry ""lost masterpiece!"" but in this case, while the movie is very interesting and worthwhile, to call it a masterpiece would be  hyperbole.  The chief pleasures derived from two hours spent with SCARECROW are (1) the fascinating interplay between actors Gene Hackman (doing a variation on the tightly-wound jerk we've seen him play many times) and Al Pacino (revelatory as a friendly drifter whose warmth and good humor is a far cry from the typical Pacino role) and (2) the gorgeous photography from master cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond, a name that should be familiar to all fans of '70s cinema.  As Hackman and Pacino amble across American backroads, hopping trains and hiking through hills, Zsigmond's lens tints everything with a shade of magic.  The episodic plot sets the pair on individual personal journeys (Hackman wants success in business, Pacino wants a reunion with his family) as well as collaborative ones.  It is great fun to watch Pacino's warmth rub off on Hackman as he becomes steadily less grumpy.  Because this was the '70s and pessimism was the order of the day, the film ends on an ambiguously dour note, but what lingers for the viewer is the ramshackle charm and beauty of the film's pleasant meanderings.",1206144000,8,1484,4.912
2290182,5,B0009GX1CO,"One of the best I've seen in a long time.  While filming is beautiful from the start, it took a little while for me to be sure I was really on board with the characters.  Hackman is so prickly in the beginning, and  Pacino's scarecrow solilique (""The scarecrow makes 'em laugh.."") had me wondering.  By the time they get thrown in the house of detentions, you're thinking what a nice guy Pacino is and how unreasonable is Hackman.. who ends up on a pigfarm.  What a reverse the film suddenly takes after that!  Suddenly, Hackman's stand-offish ways seem to make a little more sense!

But sure, Pacino was the charmer. Hackman was also interesting in his own loyalty and focused determination.  One or two scenes may have been a bit over the top (Hackman strip-teasing in that greasy diner to show Pacino he's not gonna get in another fight?).  Still, this movie was a real work of genius.  It seems to teach something:  Pacino's art of defusing a potential situation (the scarecrow) and Hackman's determination - or as it would manifest in his life (outside of his dreams) - too ready for a fight.  The movie is a character study and a study of human nature.  Both sides of the coin are represented in these two characters and I could respect the way it ended  (remember the last scene? if I was gonna choose one scene to represent Hackman's character, that would be it!).

The substantial slice of their lives which the film gives us is enough to chew on.  It's like the story has told us what it wanted to, and then it ends.  Perhaps all the details have not been ironed out, but the essence, the ""message"", or something like that, has been given.  Ending it where it did, while not answering all the questions pertaining to the specifics in their stories, leaves you to figure out what the real story is.",1204329600,3,1807,4.5246913580246915
2290183,4,B0009GX1CO,"very touching and down to earth.  With the talent and charm of Al Pacino and the crusty gruffness of Gene Hackman their opposite personalities really mesh.  Hackman the cold loner, Al the goofy, but loveable loser. This movie was not liked by critics, and I don't really understand why. Its really an overlooked, well done buddy flick about two very lonely people who find a connection.  Enjoy.",1187481600,4,394,4.850746268656716
2290184,5,B0009GX1CO,"I remember seeing this in the movies as a little girl and saying, ""What the heck did I just see?"" It leaves you dumbstruck a little and you can just see that Al Pacino was a force to be reckoned with. Gene Hackman's best movie, if you ask me and just something to behold.",1184976000,4,271,4.037037037037037
2290185,5,B0009GX1CO,"Having read a decent amount of opinions about the film Scarecrow (1973), I've noticed quite a few differing thoughts with regards to how specific visuals and elements were interpreted, but the one aspect that many seem to agree upon is this is a vastly underrated feature, one that might have gotten lost in the shuffle specifically because the two main actors, Gene Hackman and Al Pacino had both just recently (at the time) appeared in landmark films The French Connection (1971) and The Godfather (1972), respectively.  Directed by Jerry Schatzberg (The Panic in Needle Park, Honeysuckle Rose), the film includes performances by Dorothy Tristan (Klute, Rollercoaster), Ann Wedgeworth (Bang the Drum Slowly, My Science Project), Richard Lynch (The Seven-Ups, The Sword and the Sorcerer), Penelope Allen (Dog Day Afternoon), and Eileen Brennan (The Sting, Murder by Death), as a nasty, drunken floozy with a big mouth.

Hackman and Pacino play the characters Max Millan and Francis Lionel 'Lion' Delbuchi, respectively, who are two drifters that hook up with each other in the backwoods of California, both headed east as Max, who was recently released from prison, has plans on opening a carwash in Pittsburgh while Francis, who completed a stint at sea, is returning home to Detroit to meet his child for the first time and make some sort of amends to his wife (apparently after his wife got pregnant, Francis got scared, ran off, and joined up with the merchant marines).  Anyway, the two couldn't be more different...Max is a gruff, belligerent, short-tempered, mean-spirited, uptight cuss who likes to crack heads, take naps, and doesn't do anything without a plan while Francis is a likeable go with the flow sort, one who enjoys the spotlight if only to make people laugh (he believes you don't have to hit people if you can make them laugh).  As I said, the two hook up on the road through a chance meeting, and Max immediately decides to make Francis a partner in his upcoming business venture, that being opening a carwash in Pittsburgh.  Seems Max, who's been in the joint for the last six years, has been saving every penny and depositing it in a bank, fastidiously planning every aspect of the operation, pouring over every detail to the point of committing them to memory.  As the pair hitch rides, jump trains, and hoof it by foot eastward, they have their ups and downs, eventually making their way to Denver to stop off and see Max's sister Coley (Tristan).  Times are good, but quickly sour as Max gets both himself and Francis chucked in the can for a thirty-day stint after a barroom brawl (Max ends up blaming Francis for convincing him to deviate from his `plans', and subsequently the pair are now on the `outs').  Francis makes friends quickly with a trustee (played by Lynch), earning himself some relatively easy work assignments (along with some unwanted attentions), while Max's standoffishness earns him a trip to Pigville (the county pig farm), shoveling manure.  Eventually the men reconnect, are released from prison, and back on the road, headed for Detroit for a reunion of sorts with Francis' estranged wife and child...

If you're looking for a straightforward type of story, one that has a distinctive beginning, middle, and an end, then you'd best pass this film up.  This is purely a character driven drama with comedic underpinnings, one that, like life itself, tends to get a little messy.  The real treat here is watching these two fine actors play off each other, something director Schatzberg encourages given the length of some of the scenes and the unrestrictive atmosphere in general throughout the feature.  I'll admit, initially I was a little wary about the pairing of Hackman and Pacino in this sort of `buddy buddy' road picture, but the two completely immerse themselves in their roles, creating a pair of completely believable and identifiable characters.  I thought Hackman did particularly well presenting an overly retentive, rigid, suspicious, angry at the world individual obsessed with sticking to his plan, his confidence stemming from the very fact that it was so well thought out (by himself) it couldn't possible fail.  There's an exchange in the film that really helps put his character in perspective, as Francis relates how once in Catholic school he got the palm of his hand smacked by a nun with a ruler for clowning around.

Max: How come you didn't pound that old lady in the mouth?

Francis: What old lady?

Max: The one that hit you in the palm with the stick.

Francis: She was a nun!

I thought Pacino also did very well as in his role as the easy going, trusting, sociable type that's everyone's friend, a bit naive at times, always handy with a joke or a pratfall, whose main goal in life seems to try and resolve a past indiscretion that seems to have haunted him for awhile, that of leaving his wife in the lurch (he did send her whatever money he could over the years, but that was more or less out of an effort of support, and not one of amends).  At some point he realized the only way to excise the demon that plagues him is to confront it, which is why he's headed to Detroit.  The characters are obviously from different ends of the spectrum, but, in their differences, they create sort of a `ying and yang', as Max is the driven man with the plan, along with being the streetwise protector of the pair, his edge slightly offset by Francis' ability to enjoy each moment in the here and now (Max allows Francis quite a bit of leeway in terms of Francis poking fun at Max only because he sees Francis as sort of a child, one whose only desire is to please).  My favorite sequence in the film comes while the pair is in prison, after their falling out.  Despite the fact that they're now at odds, the bond is still there as Max dishes out the retribution after Francis discovers his new friends like him more than for his comedic repartee.  As I said, there's not much of a story here, but I found the characters, relationships, and performances fascinating enough to keep me entertained throughout the nearly two hour running time.  The ending is sort of downbeat, and offers very little in the way of resolution, but if you can get past this, you might want to check this movie out.  It was definitely worth my time.

The picture quality on this DVD release is decent, presented in widescreen (2.40:1), enhanced for 16X9 TVs, and the Dolby Digital mono audio comes through reasonably well (it did seem a little soft at times).  As far as extras, there are English, Spanish, and French subtitles, an original theatrical trailer, and a vintage featurette for the film entitled ""On the Road"" (3:48).

By the way, another scene worth seeing this film for is when Max strips off his clothes in order to go to bed...he's wearing like ten shirts, and watching him remove them is like watching the clowns come out of the little car at the circus.  For those interested, the cinematographer on the film was Vilmos Zsigmond, who also did such features as Deliverance, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and The Deer Hunter.",1143676800,14,7113,4.7765089722675365
2290186,2,B0009GX1CO,"I wanted to see this for a long time.  I attempt to watch every Al Pacino and Deniro movie ever made.  There are only about 5 I haven't seen.  I watch every one even if I know they will be bad such as Simone or Analyze That.  This one I was excited to watch but it was a let down.

This one didn't make it to dvd until just know and the vhs was very rare.

This movie is one of those without a real story to tell but is instead a character study.  The problem is that Al Pacino and Gene Hackman's characters really didn't have much depth and they didn't compliment or clash enough to bring out any qualities that could be examined anyway.  Both characters are also presented as dimwits who don't have a whole lot of rhyme or reason to their actions so that just makes it all the less interesting.

I did start to have a little interest in the little story that the movie was using as a background.  But the story ends abruptly before any of the main storyline is resolved so I never got to satisfy my curiousity there either.

Don't bother picking this one up.",1134691200,4,1060,4.147058823529412
2290187,5,B0009GX1CO,"This is without a doubt a lost gem that never found an audience like the description reads. This little seen movie was one of the best acting vehicles for its stars. Gene Hackman and Al Pacino deliver great and heartfelt performances as two drifters who are seen as losers and they themselves especially Lion, Pacino's character thinks of himself as one of them. This film reminded me of John Steinbeck's classic novel ""Of Mice and Men"" who was brought to the screen in 1994 with Gary Sinise and John Malkovich in the title roles. Pacino is Lenny in my eyes as he has the same innocent and childlike behavior that Lenny has in the film and story. Hackman is George, the strong of the two who is less of a dreamer and more practical than Pacino's character. The two of them although at odds with each other during most of the course of the movie did not get along when they were filming this classic film. They argued and disagreed a lot on the set from what I have it read... however you never saw a bit of animosity between the two of them as their superb acting and professionalism shone through out the film. If you have never seen this movie... this would be a good opportunity to purchase this film and see not only a great, classic movie of the 1970's but also the highlight for me anyway... is two see two masters of the acting craft battle it out in front of your eyes with their amazing gift and talent. SCARECROW,is a winner and you won't be disappointed to add this classic movie to your collection. Special thanks go to the company that decided to finally release this great film on DVD it was about time.",1123027200,21,1617,4.411371237458194
2290188,5,B0009GX1CO,"""Scarecrow"" is another example as to why the seventies were a great decade for filmmaking.  Studios were willing to take a chance on dicey material and stars would eschew their vanity for the sake of art.  For a while I thought this film was adrift like it's two main characters Max(Gene Hackman) and Lion (Al Pacino).  It's around the midway point of this film that these characters start shedding layers of their respective psyches like the copious clothes that Max wears.  The film turns poignant and ultimately tragic and a little hopeful.  For me to reveal the details of the plot would be a disservice to any potential viewers so trust me that you will be rewarded.  Needless to say both Hackman and Pacino are superb here.  The film is beautifully photographed by master cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond.  Credit director Jerry Schatzberg for taking us on an odyssey with two fascinating, albeit lost, souls.",1121385600,43,914,4.928104575163399
2290189,5,B0009GX1CO,"This movie is somewhat experimental, yes, but if you like Hackman or Pacino, you will go for this film because it rides on the strength of their collective talents.  It's sort of like Of Mice and Men meets Waiting for Godot.  Can you imagine two huge movie stars (Hackman and Pacino both in their absolute prime) playing two drifters in a low-budget film like this today?  These are great, uncharacteristic performances by both men.  In its visual style (lots of long takes and jump cuts) and story arc (or lack thereof) you can see why this film would appeal so much to French audiences (it won the Palme d'Or at Cannes).  Therefore, if you detest French cinema, you probably won't like this film much.  If you enjoy great acting, though, you will love Scarecrow.",1121040000,20,764,4.664179104477612
2290190,5,B0009GX1CO,"This is one of several classics I've been waiting for to come out on DVD. It seems as though, if you wait long enough, it'll come out eventually.

2290191,5,B0009GX1CO,"I feel fortunate to have seen this film at a young age; it was my first exposure to film as art and it left a lasting impression. I've often thought back to my first viewing of Scarecrow and always looked for it whenever I entered a video store for the first time. I couldn't believe that it hadn't been released on VHS. I recently saw Larry King ask Gene Hackman what he felt was his best or favorite work. Hackman started to duck the question but finally indicated Scarecrow. Pacino could say the same. Scarecrow is a great story, is wonderfully directed, and features what I believe to be the two best performances from two of our finest screen actors. A must-see for film buffs and anybody who loves a great movie.",1114732800,12,718,4.446969696969697
2290192,5,B0009GX1CO,This film is highly recommended. It is stated by Gene Hackman himself that this is his favorite piece of work and I agree.,1114041600,,122,4.3478260869565215
2290193,5,B0009GX1CO,"The brutal impact you will receive after watching that superb film of obvious theatrical character does not diminish at all its primordial virtues. From California to Philadelphia a pair of drifter-losers plan their future building the isolated pieces of a broken living without many expectations in the middle term future. The wings if the hopeless make its work in the desperate souls of these men literally overcome by the hard challenge of living. Curious parable: from West to East in the same way that just four years before two outlaw men make a parallel road in Easy Rider. This long journey will allow us to explore once more the aridity emotional and affective of two men in the edge of the fall. An existential story nothing easy to follow except if you are ready by previous films of related issues as The fire within, the swimmer., Paris Texas, Strozek or the Last year in Mariembad for instance.

I love this picture and if you do not accept the challenge you will really miss one of the tour de force performances of two real giants actors. I do not think it is exaggerate to conclude this has been the best achievement of Gene Hackman in his career and the sixth best acting of Pacino after Godfather II, Scent of a woman, Justice for all, Dog day afternoon  and Carlitos way in that decreasing order.

I insist: it is not a easy film. But it is plenty of details that work out so efficiently that you will remind it for a long, long time. May be this scrupulous theme is not approached in the future with such honesty and conviction as this case, when the American Cinema gave an important twist in its wide scope focusing the concerns of single people.

An artistic treasure and without any doubt one of my 100 best American Films in any age.

I wonder why this major work has not been released on DVD format: a mistery which overpasses my outstanding. You can argue many reasons but just any excuse.",1108944000,,1918,4.563953488372093
2290194,5,B0009GX1CO,"This and Save The Tiger are probably the most under-appreciated films of the seventies decade. They both need a DVD release. It is outragious and infuriating to know that such dreck as Gigli and WING COMMANDER! maintain DVD status, but this film remains unheard of and forgotten by the masses.
Gene Hackman admitted on Larry King Live that this is his favorite piece of work. What does that say about the film? Yes, better than The Conversation, The French Connection, Unforgiven, and yes, even better than Bonnie and Clyde.

Though when i saw the name Al Pacino i got focused!. I can say one movie that al pacino made that is bad!. After realizing that it was when he was young. I opened my eyes even more!. The thing is with this movie; is that the first 5 seconds make you laugh.
And the movie has no peak... ...Dont missunderstand me! im saying the peak allways rises! but never falls! its just getting better and better. Gene Hackman in my opinion made his best film ever. And Al Pacino made as great as allways. Very unusual role to him and it fits him a little to well 8). I wish you could see him more in films with a characther like this.
