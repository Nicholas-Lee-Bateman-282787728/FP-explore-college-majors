8026451,1,B0002D0TUG,If you want just the very basic old converted from video tape DVD (copyright is 1987) this is for you.  It is definitely not worth the $24.95 asking price. He shows one old style MEC reloading machine  The run time is listed as 53 min. 10 min of that is spent walking around out in the desert. What really ticked me off was the advertisements for other videos ran about as long at the one I paid for. Sorry I didn't look for reviews before buying.,1221696000,10,447,4.186046511627907
