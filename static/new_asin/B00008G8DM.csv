If you're into sampling, chopping, layering all that golden era hip hop boom bapp, this definately not for you. Otherwise i if you favor synth, keyboards, all that other stuff its cool but in my opinion you could learn the same by watching a few youtube videos.",1370563200,,335,4.419354838709677
7984351,1,B00008G8DM,"I bought this a couple years ago out of pure boredom/curiosity and as a funny white elephant gift.  I use to make beats on my computer in college, so I thought this might be interesting to see ""how the pros do it"".  I learned absolutely nothing from this.  If I remember correctly, they just went through a list of equipment that you could use, but didn't show you how to use it or give any advice on tips or tricks.  What a waste of time and money.  I agree with the other review; check out youtube if you want some real advice.  Or just buy a computer program and have fun with that.",1261526400,,585,4.132743362831858
7984352,2,B00008G8DM,"If this information wasn't availible for free on youtube in much greater detail it would get a three from me.  It is fairly well produced for the price.

He basically shows you his keyboard, an MPC and talks about sample CD (very briefly).  There is NO DETAIL WHATSOEVER ON THIS DVD!!!

He basically goes ""here's an MPC, here's me tapping on the pads, here's the finished beat, see easy"".  Then he gets ""industry insiders"" to tell you to get a lawyer before trying to sell beats.

Seriously I have just told you all the (useful) information that is on this DVD.  Avoid it unless you don't have access to the internet and can't type MPC, Korg Triton and Acid Music into the search bar.",1248134400,2,684,4.467741935483871
7984353,2,B00008G8DM,"When this appeared on my ""purchase"" list I had forgotten that I bought it for my 15 year old for Christmas. I bought him several other products and I've heard the least about this one.",1203120000,,184,4.285714285714286
