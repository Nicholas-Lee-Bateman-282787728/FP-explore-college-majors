8737539,4,B016Y9FR62,"Finally! One of the best video documents of the original Mothers Of Invention (and there isn't much out there), their appearance on Germany's legendary Beat Club in Bremen from October 6, 1968 has made it to DVD. And what a DVD! Not only do we get the original 35 min. broadcast, we get the entire footage from their appearance, including them setting-up, fooling around, and rehearsing. Including the actual performance, the entire shebang is one minute shy of 2 hours! There's almost 85 min. of never-before seen footage, all in perfect German-engineered quality from 1968......

With same group of Mothers that performed ""King Kong"" on England's Colour Me Pop, which was filmed only 17 days later, the group performs one long continuous improvisation with Zappa directing the band through the opening themes of some of his more well-known pieces of that era such as ""King Kong,"" ""A Pound For A Brown On The Bus,"" ""Sleeping In A Jar"" and ""Uncle Meat"" They also play an instrumental version of ""Let's Make The Water Turn Black, an early version of ""Prelude To The Afternoon Of A Sexually Aroused Gas Mask,"" and interesting arrangements of ""Prelude"" from ""Act 3"" of Richard Wagner's opera ""Lohengrin"" and Zappa fave Edgard Varese's ""Octandre."" The only caveat is that the original performance from 1968 was filmed in B&W. Beat Club did not go to colour until the early 1970's, the 35 min. colour performance found on YouTube, etc. was edited from the original performance and first shown in 1970, the 1968 footage from the two cameras was put through colour filters to match the rest of the show, hence the weird colour choices which occasionally look like flesh tones on the musician's faces. Also note the old ""beat club"" sign on the back wall, you never see that in any of their colour clips......

From label Gonzo: This rare and fascinating footage is finally available due to the historic importance of the performance. Much of this has never been legitimately released before now. Only the last 35 minutes or so was ever transmitted, which occurred for the first time on German TV channel ARD in October 1970, two years after it was filmed. While there is much footage of Zappa available from his later tours, the early stage of his career, with the original Mothers of Invention, is more sparsely documented than most, naturally enough. With this glimpse into the world of the legendary Frank Zappa and the Mothers filmed in 1968 and at last made commercially available, it s possible to enjoy music being made, in the moment and for its own sake.""

8737540,3,B016Y9FR62,"I feel that ""Freak Out,"" the Mothers Of Inventions' debut album, was one of the great concept albums
of the late 1960s, lampooning both the worlds of the counter-culture and mainstream society. But you
won't find the magic of that album or the ensuing ones here, just endless, directionless,  jamming
onstage. There's a moment when the band tears into a '50s - style rock n roll instrumental that things
begin to soar, but the sound suddenly drops out and you can barely hear it. Recommended for hard -
core Zappa fans only.",1471910400,,524,4.695652173913044
