8103348,5,B000E0OE3A,"Jordan Hawley's `How to Lose Your Lover' is my kind of movie - all about brainy self-examination, funny,  and full of twists.  For me it's genuinely original - goodbyes are always about fake warm feelings, not burning bridges.  Enjoy the psychosis, the antics, the irreverence and the decadence - but when it counts there is real heart in here, too.  Setting this sort of thing in LA is something I've never seen.  I want to call Hawley `West Coast Woody'.  Has any movie celebrated the buildings and landmarks of LA in the same way?",1169424000,4,533,4.617021276595745
8103349,3,B000E0OE3A,"Jordan Hawley wrote and directed this dark 'comedy' about the current state of love/hate relationships in Los Angeles (or inability to create same) with about as much panache as yesterday's onion rings.  The storyline has been used so many times that the tread is off the tires.

LA ghostwriter Owen (Paul Schneider) is a 'nice guy' who sustains an inability to form a satisfactory love relationship.  Exasperated with his life style he decides to become a cad: that must be what women (and men) want.  He reverses his nice guy tactic and begins telling everyone he encounters just how he feels - and that is usually negative! The only person who doesn't but into his change is his roommate Allison (Poppy Montgomery) who is bisexual and therefore not wholly available. He decides to leave Los Angeles and move to the East Coast where a lucrative deal awaits him to write the memoirs of a famous man.  At the last moment he meets one Val (Jennifer Westfeldt), an animal activist: the chemistry is there but each has a conflicting program.  Owen is honest with her, a factor that does not chase her away, but both part ways to other parts of the world.  Upon return to LA after a disappointing experience on the East Coast, tables turn and surprises arise.  And the ending is a mixture of silly and unsatisfying.

Movies like this are meant to entertain and some of the dialogue is clever albeit acerbic.  It just that the idea of relationship examination under these terms is so worn out that the movie just doesn't spark any innovative thoughts.  After about thirty minutes into the film this 'audience' lost interest.  Grady Harp, September 06",1158278400,5,1645,4.753521126760563

We also loved the relationships and character development and the great ending.  A definite must for anyone who loves a good movie and loves to laugh!",1143331200,3,256,4.666666666666667
8103351,4,B000E0OE3A,"I just watched this movie for the first time and I enjoyed the interesting twist that it takes on love.  Paul Schneider's character is trying desparately to get out of LA and basically meets a girl at the last minute that changes his life and makes his escape much more difficult than even he could've imagined.  It has funny, sad and sweet moments.  If you like any of Paul Schneiders other movies (All the real girls, Elizabethtown)  then I think you'd like this!  He's a great actor I think he'll become an even bigger name in hollywood in the coming years.  Enjoy the film with friends or a loved one it's a great flick to see with people you care about.  I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because it can get a slow at times, and quite dark.  But the payoff at the end is certainly worth it, something you can see coming but you enjoy seeing the characters finally realize what we had known almost all along!  Hope this helps!",1142899200,2,927,4.312138728323699
