5911490,4,B001KPYO10,Armin is definitely my favorite DJ.  Every performance on this DVD rocks.  The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because its missing the performance by Sharon del Adel singing In And Out Of Love.  How do you not include that!!!!!  Also they put the performances by Jaren Cerf and Elles de Graaf into the deleted scenes section.  Why????  If anyone knows why they did these things plz let me know cause I think that is really weird.,1223683200,3,434,4.3625
5911491,4,B001KPYO10,"Very nice mixes and song selection. Energetic and uplifting, no doubt. A few main reasons I am giving this 4 stars: 1) The insanely annoying MC. I cannot believe Armin allowed this guy on stage. Quite a ""vocabulary"" the guy has... ""shut your eyes"", ""imagine"", ""make some noise"". Pretty pathetic. 2) The ""live"" performances are not live at all. The only one who actually sings can't sing at all. 3) Where is ""In And Out of Love""???",1262044800,2,430,4.597402597402597
5911492,4,B001KPYO10,"Plain and simple, Armin Van Buuren's performance at this event was amazing... This DVD is a great collection of the night's moments... I do have just two ""gripes"" about the DVD in general though:

- The audio is alittle ""lower"" in the concert portion than the rest of the DVD, so you have to turn it up alot more :-/...
- This DVD was edited. HUGE sections were cut out of it (I guess to make room for a large portion of the songs)... Still, my 3 favorite songs, the only reasons I really bought the DVD, were edited out :-(..

Other than those two issues, the DVD is great :-)

5911493,4,B001KPYO10,"There are a few things that are good to know before purchasing this DVD ...

A LOT (and I mean, A LOT) of tracks, for some reason, were not included in the DVD like: Sharon Den Adel's ""In and Out Of Love""(!!!); Jennifer Rene's ""Invincible"" and so on ...

The majority of the tracks were edited and when you watch it, it seems the artists were lip singing when in reality they weren't (the worst one is Carole's ""Rain"" because they edited with Cathy Burton's voice!!!) But some songs weren't (badly) edited, THANK GOD!

I was very disappointed but even though (the DVD) is not THAT great I think that, if you love Armin, you should get it!",1238025600,3,638,4.389830508474576
5911494,3,B001KPYO10,"The dvd is by far one of the best shows ever recorded but, the only reason i bought this in the first place was because of the sharon in and out of love song. This was a big let down and for me and i fell like i was robbed. Why is there no sharon?",1234915200,3,247,3.5090909090909093
5911495,4,B001KPYO10,"Its def and great DVD, much larger venue, and well improved in the visuals. Great job from the Armada guys.",1229040000,,107,4.4
5911496,5,B001KPYO10,"This is an incredible performance from Armin Van Buuren !!!....amazing music in an out of this world ambient !!!...if you are a Van Buuren fan then this DVD set is a MUST !!!.....the sound quality is amazing, in Dolby Digital 5.1 at 48Khz, the video quality is very good, I think could be even better, Blu Ray would be a better option for video quality, but I think it is not available yet !!!.....but believe me, you won't loose your money with this DVD.",1228867200,,455,4.428571428571429
5911497,4,B001KPYO10,"Trance in its purest form visualized, energized, humanized. Production and crowd are amazing, effects spectacular, nice editing. You'll see happiest crowd in the world. It may be unfair to rate it with four stars, but I compare to the best in the category and there are no 4.5 stars :)  I compare to Tiesto's Elements of Life DVD. They are both superb, but EOL is more of an art, like a classical play put to music. Armin Only and Elements of Life are way ahead of any other dance/trance concert dvd ever made, must have couple. Put it on a big screen, home theater with 5.1 and a party arrives at your home immediately, don't forget to bring friends and invite emotions.",1228694400,,671,4.5
5911498,4,B001KPYO10,"This is by far one of the best production that AVB made since the 2006 & 2007 video. As usual he started out slow, then the speed pickup. I enjoy this DVD along with Tiesto Elements of Life.",1228348800,,190,4.026315789473684
5911499,5,B001KPYO10,"He's been voted the world's number 1 DJ two years in a row; he's toured the globe promoting his latest album Imagine and has now released his latest DVD. Armin Only: Imagine is everything that his parties are, in the comfort of your own home.

Filmed live at the first event in Utrecht on April 19 2008, there's one big room, 16,000 screaming fans and one very cool DJ, culminating in one supreme sight, sound and throbbing spectacle that leaves you breathless. The vibe from the crowd is electric and even just watching the screen you feel like you're right there with them. It's breathtaking, and every beat compels you to get up and dance.

For those who missed out on experiencing this mastery of sublime euphoria in the flesh, this DVD captures everything perfectly. If you were one of the enraptured tens of thousands in the world who joined the party, you'll be reliving every last sweaty moment in 5.1 surround sound.

Armin Van Buuren really is a remarkable talent. Every last beat, every last choreographed dance and every last note is performed to perfection. He's has been a leader in the world of dance music for years now with his solo and compilation albums - A State Of Trance and Universal Religion and his weekly radio show A State of Trance which is available through iTunes as a podcast.

You truly realise just how massive this man is when you hit Going Wrong where Chris Jones takes to the stage and over ten thousand people sing along. Also featuring in the spectacular is Eller Van Buuren, Armin's brother. He features in two tracks, the title track Imagine and also Zocalao which originally appeared on the album Shiver and featured Gabriel & Dresden.

Don't think that this marathon music event ends with the closing beats of the concert. The DVD is a two disc set. Included on the bonus disc is a behind the scenes look at where the concept came from, as well as the planning and logistics behind it all. There's also a photo report and the trailer which was widely available online in the lead up to this mammoth production. There's Armin Van Buuren's discography which showcases the massive amount of work this one man has generated. Not to be neglected are the deleted scenes - they are two songs which were filmed but not included in the overall concert. Elle De Graaf is sublime singing The Power Of Goodbye and Unforgivable is to die for.

`I'm fine without you now, I've given you, given you everything,"" sings Jennifer Rene in Fine Without You at the very start of the DVD and given us everything he has. He has given us multiple albums, he has given us so many live shows and now he has given us Armin Only: Imagine live on DVD so we can be enthralled again and again. He can be fine without us, but trance lovers will never be fine without him.",1227139200,,2781,4.552
5911500,5,B001KPYO10,"An amazing DVD that captures the Armin Only event in the best possible way through video. If like me you couldn't make it to the event, this is the next best thing. Track selection and mixing is awesome as always by Armin plus the lights, lasers and sound of the crowd going nuts all make the DVD a special audio-visual experience for trance lovers. Buy it NOW !",1226793600,2,362,4.338235294117647

8605045,5,B001KPYO10,I purchaed this thinking it was a CD I had accessed through my Zune subscription.  Turns out this was a DVD with several long sound tracks.  I was able to get the audio files transerfed to my zune.  Great music for focus oriented work sessions.,1355875200,,244,4.377777777777778
8605046,5,B001KPYO10,"It all began one day when on Youtube I saw the beginning of his latest DVD ""Mirage"" with Ana Criado opening the show. Since then I fell in love with Mr. Armin (his music - his incredible talent). So I got the ""Mirage"" DVD and then the (this) DVD ""Imagine"". The music, the beat, the emotion, it is just amazing and you can already tell how ""Imagine"" would lead to ""Mirage""... In ""Imagine"" Armin takes you to a journey where you have never been... Get this dvd you will like each second of it... Thank you Mr. Van Buuren for everything that you do... thru your music you make us really feel... yes, a very special state.... so ""Let's Trance""...",1346112000,,642,4.358333333333333

8605048,5,B001KPYO10,amazing. Concert was great and the music was just even more amazing hearing it live in concert. Armin is the world's best DJ and this concert proves that. If you're a fan then get this,1317600000,,184,4.285714285714286
8605049,5,B001KPYO10,"Armin Only is one of the best shows I have ever seen before. I have had the fortune of going to see many shows over the years of my electronic music love, this one is amazing. If you really want to be touched emotionally and spiritually this is the recording for you. This DVD is an amazing compilation of what Armin brings to the table. He is a true leader in the field, and watch the crowd during the DVD if you do not believe me. In fact I purchased his remix album that is in conjunction with this recording. If you want to see real trance by a real DJ this is it!! A lot of albums replicate each other.. This man and his music are truly original and one of a kind. Armada recordings surpasses all expectations of the most demanding electronica and trance enthusiast....",1281484800,,774,4.272108843537415
8605050,5,B001KPYO10,"This is the next best thing than seeing him live.... the music selection is great the performances were really good I especially enjoyed communication part 3 and also chris jones ""going wrong"" if you enjoy trance and dance this is a must it completely takes you out of your element !!! however as some of the other reviews mentioned that sharon del adel in and out of love was not on the dvd and I think its because during the performance when she was being presented the mc called her susan not once but twice and she was in the pictures on the 2nd dvd but did not perform on the main event dvd its sad because thats his most popular song but overall the entire show is amazing and makes you wish you could go join the crowd !!!!!! GO ARMIN YOU ARE THE BEST AT WHAT YOU DO!!!!!!",1276214400,,779,4.2
8605051,5,B001KPYO10,"Watching this dvd as rental, have all the tracks in mp3 format to listen in the car. But i'm buying the DVD because its just one of the best Armin mixes. And his opening at ASOT 450 was unreal. Amazing!",1270252800,,202,4.075
8605052,5,B001KPYO10,"Armin Van Buurin -- the Rachmaninoff of our age -- presents his live show here on DVD, and reveals himself to be an honest-to-goodness real-life Richard Halley, straight out of Atlas Shrugged. For the unaware, Van Buuren is both Producer AND Engineer -- he literally places all the mics in-studio himself; literally NOTHING comes between him and his music, not even an electronic technician.

Here on the Imagine DVD, Van Buuren raises the bar so far above the herd that language itself fails me: Van Buuren starts each set knowing nothing but what his first introductory record will be -- after that, it's all about structuring his set by vibe-connecting with his audience. Part DJ, part social engineer, part Producer, part master of impeccable musical timing -- and all genius -- Van Buuren ""mixes"" multiple pieces of pre-recorded music into a unique tapestry that is never repeated show-to-show; it's an incredibly complex structure of peaks & valleys that Armin weaves together each night in perfect vibe with his audience's ever-shifting emotional state -- he's continuously running multiple computers and at least a half-dozen CD players -- and interspersing multiple live guest vocalists as well -- Van Buuren only makes it LOOK easy. He is in a class utterly by himself.

After seeing this, one is struck with the realization that Mozart couldn't POSSIBLY have mattered.

Absolutely massive.",1266969600,2,1400,5.158590308370044
8605053,4,B001KPYO10,"i dig this dvd. its a show like this helps prove he's #1. i haven't seen a live show of his for 4 years, so this is the next best thing.
