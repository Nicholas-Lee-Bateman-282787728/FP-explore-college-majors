8024370,1,B00029NLH8,"This is about the 1984 murder of a kid named Gary Lauwers. He was murdered by Ricky Kasso, who believed that Lauwers had stolen some PCP from him. The murder trial became sensationalized by the media because Kasso claimed to be a Satanist.

The documentary was originally presented on the Discovery Channel and is a low quality production in many aspects. Some cheesy re-enactment scenes and an absurdly melodramatic narrator tell the story of how the murders occurred and the subsequent trial. Interviews with various legal officals and alleged co-murderer Jimmmy Triona are also included and are somewhat more interesting.

But the narrator continues to drone on about the same issues -the kids were from a middle class suburb, they were taking lots of drugs, there was a lack of parental supervision, etc. It all seems overly simplistic and gets repetitive and boring very quickly. This doc in no way offers an intelligent analysis of the murders. But is a cheap and poorly made effort to shock people into believing that heavy metal, drug use and so-called ""Satanism"" are on the verge of destroying America. It's really a piece of garbage and not worth your time or money.",1222041600,8,1176,4.934343434343434

Even though this DVD gives the facts there is really nothing new that we don't already know, or anything new that we didn't already read in Say you Love Satan!  One of the good things is that you get to see Jimmy Troiano.  Jimmy is interviewed throughtout the whole DVD.  Also the Bonus scenes has an interview with Jimmy as well.  Another cool thing with the Bonus Scenes are:

Ricky and Jimmy's statements to the Police

Gary's Autospy report.

In all I would recommend this DVD to anyone that is intersted in this story",1095897600,15,581,4.314814814814815
