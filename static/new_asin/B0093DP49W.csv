8572347,5,B0093DP49W,"From a Yoga Teacher's Perspective: This DVD has a gentle and thoughtful series of poses in a beautiful setting. Great for someone with limited time, as it is 40-minutes, and for those new to practicing yoga this is a gentle introduction to the basics. Adapt this to your lifestyle - good for waking up early to start your day, or for late-night ""must sleep"" it will lull you. Thanks, YogaAnne!",1350000000,,393,4.628571428571429
