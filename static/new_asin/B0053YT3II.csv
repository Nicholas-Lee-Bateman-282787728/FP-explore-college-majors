I spilled my heart out writing that review of Tyler Perry shows, movies and plays. There are people who don't understand how this television show, Meet The Browns and all Tyler Perry productions, mimics a very funny, people of Color television show, from the 50's. Back then, organizations  fought to get it off the air because of stereo typing, yet today we seem to have revive that genre and loving it.",1387152000,,531,4.589473684210526

4553141,3,B0053YT3II,"The character Mr. Brown has me in tears - true belly laughs with his antics.
The only down side to the episodes is the dark side of life that IS NOT FUNNY (ACTUALLY DISTURBING) - Example:
Thematic subject matter relating to sexual immorality; domestic violence; child sexual and physical abuse; and teen pregnacy with no clear guidance morally but down plays the significance of these societal problems.

I will have to weigh any future purchases with ""home much comedy is worth putting up with the other cleverly disguised garbage.""  There should be clear ratings of this material and description of the content so one is not sucked into believing this is just lightweight entertainment.",1381104000,2,688,5.026315789473684
