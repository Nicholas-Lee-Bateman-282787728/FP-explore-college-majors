5013598,5,B006QU70UQ,"Saw this on YouTube and had to buy the DVD...I'm 63 years old and feel in this ever changing world, the Hillsong United Worship group will lead  young and old Christians to a better love of JESUS..PTL",1362182400,,200,4.405405405405405
5013599,4,B006QU70UQ,I really enjoyed this concert DVD because they mixed in backstage images with the concert and songs. You totally get your money's worth with the amount of songs on it. Inspiring and fun!!!!,1360972800,,189,4.757575757575758
5013600,5,B006QU70UQ,"Hillsong provides incredible worship experiences that some might call concerts. I would call them ""a little taste of Heaven"".  Every worship event makes you look forward to Heaven that much more!",1360281600,,195,5.290322580645161
5013601,2,B006QU70UQ,"I love Hillsong. After being 100% pleased with ""God is Able"" DVD, I expected Live in Miami to also please on all levels.  It doesn't.

Here's what it does well:  It gives you alot of good songs, old and new, and it even up-dates the way some are played.  Like that too.  For instance, ""The Stand"" is much more an electric-guitar version than previous milder versions.  But this 'positive' is also where the negitives begin.

This stage production has a hard-edged-bad-boy adolescent feel to it. A touch of that is great- just enough to say ""we're real""- but the entire production is like this.  The on-stage behavior is perfect for a 13-yr old male.  The occasional split-screen effect is so ""yesterday"".  The sound mixing attempts to make you feel part of the crowd(surround-sound)- works great on the CD- but on the DVD it makes you feel like you are listening from a mile-away: the crowd up close and personal, the sound, the lead vocals, almost totally lost in the crowd. A ""tinny"" sound describes it. The ""light show"" is well...um... pathetic. They should have had the mist-machine on much higher- then they could have visually drowned-out the crowd, at least giving it an ethereal feel, with effective light-show. Instead you see a clearly electric crowd responding to a distant-sounding melody from a rowdy acting band.

I'm surprised.  The CD is so awesome because you CANT
see the band and crowd.  I attended the Aftermath concert in Philly six days after this was recorded, so I have a feel for what the DVD could have been.

Better luck next time Hillsong.  You can't win them all.

PROS:  many songs, different compositions
CONS:  amature light show, cheesy special-effects,
testostorine level a bit high, sound a bit distant.",1359849600,,1738,4.8338983050847455
5013602,5,B006QU70UQ,"It is an awesome DVD, mixing old and new songs from Hillsong. The quality is as good as expected, and the style is a little bit different, mixing percussion to Hillsong way of playing. It really worths it!",1341792000,,205,4.421052631578948
5013603,5,B006QU70UQ,"Hillsong United just keeps amazing me. If you're considering it, you should buy this. I may be biased because I am Australian, but I know everyone would love this.

Pros:
Hi Quality
Long (it's like 22 tracks)
Newest and some old songs
More than just a concert
VERY worshipful
Great for youth

Con:
It ends

ENJOY!!!!",1336953600,8,316,4.607142857142857
5013604,5,B006QU70UQ,Super CD from a super Christian group. Song selection is awesome and the recording is great. I highly recommend it! God bless!,1334620800,2,126,4.7727272727272725
5013605,5,B006QU70UQ,"I own all the Hillsong DVDs and this one is far by the besT!!! Not just with the songs, and music but the quality, and sound that go with it. If you want to get your God on this is the DVD to get!!!",1331337600,8,198,3.522727272727273

5013607,1,B006QU70UQ,"I have been searching for years for a good KC and the Sunshine Band DVD.  This is NOT it.  Here are my feelings on this disc:
1) The video looks like it was shot with a cellphone from about 5 years ago.  2)  The audio quality is much worse than the video!!  3) Of the dozen or so KC hits, there are only two of them on this disc. 4) Not sure what format this DVD is, but I could only get sound on one of my three DVD players. Looks very similar to bootleg DVDs I have seen in the past, although I don't believe it is actually a bootleg.

I took a chance buying this disc when there were no customer feedback(s) on Amazon. Won't make that mistake again.",1408924800,6,652,3.9389312977099236

5013610,5,B006QU70UQ,"Music is a powerful tool, We all know this.  however as an old junkie who is not in recovery but who has been recovered by Jesus Christ Finished work on the CROSS.  I heard the word I dug in and found the words in these songs in GODS word1  It's all out of the BIBLE.  What a way to study God word!  Listen to a song and then go find the words in the Bible; God speaks when His words are spoken in song and when those songs lead you to HIS word. .Thank You Hillsong United, heroin didn't have anything like this kind of High!

5013611,5,B006QU70UQ,"Living in NYC means I get to go to Hillsong church once in a while, with chance of coming across Joel Houston and the gang :D
These guys are truly servants of the Lord, and we just blessed that God use them and we get to listen to and watch quality music.
This is one of them.
The energy captured here is just amazing.
God bless these guys!",1399593600,,340,4.014705882352941
5013612,2,B006QU70UQ,"Cool songs, but I could barely use it for worship with people cause the concert is too crazy and ol buddy running around on stage can be distracting, and the the odd little clips in between songs make it hard to just let the DVD play while people worship. Their last DVD was easier to use for worship settings with groups. So, definitely not home church friendly.",1399420800,,363,4.432835820895522

8503204,4,B006QU70UQ,Would have been 3 stars but the dvd is set up for closed caption. When I could at least read what is in the words it made the LOUD concert more about worship. The audience seemed to know all the words and it was exciting to see so many young people worshiping the Lord. I like how the band reminded everyone that the gathering was euphoric and the next day would be another day but with Jesus it did not matter about your situation.,1438300800,,432,4.154761904761905
