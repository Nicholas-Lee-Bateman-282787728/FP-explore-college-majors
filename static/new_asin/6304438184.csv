If you dislike foreign films or films with captions, you're missing out if you haven't seen ""Ridicule."" Lavish costumes, great sets, and the attention paid to detail regarding the period are all incredible.

886377,5,6304438184,"Sometimes I think that Patrice Leconte is not a person but a studio's name. It's hard to comprehend that one man can create a goofy entertainment like Tanned Skiers (Les Bronzes font du Ski, 1979) and the tragic story of obsession (Monsieur Hire,1989) ten years later. The bittersweet poetic fable of The Hairdresser's Husband (Mari de la coiffeuse, 1990, one of my Top 3) was followed by the purely commercial Une chance sur deux (One chance for two, 1998) - and the only excuse for filming that creampuff was a unique chance of seeing the 2 ageing stars, Belmondo and Delon, play together. Universally appreciated Ridicule (1996) is very far from the vague and hysterical black & white The Girl On The Bridge(La fille sur le pont, 1999).
Watching Ridicule is a pleasing experience. The line between good and bad is very visible.
 The Louis XVI's court is corrupted, peopled by the monsters of excess and backstabbing. They are paralyzed by self-indulgence, they breath irony to justify their lifestyle - everything is hopeless, everything is laughable, a brilliant orator can be turned into nothing if the muse of ridicule favors the rival. So why try anything when even the most impressive results could be ridiculed - remember the scene at the school for the deaf? And all miasma float to the top where the king enjoys the gems of the genre.
Gregoir, the champion of the dying peasants is not lacking in integrity and resolve, though could not resist the temptations. His future spouse is The Era of Enlightnment ideal came alive. It's fun to see the two innocents accusing each other. The man is guilty of a short stay at the enchantress' boudoir (a not unpleasant means to achieve the noble ends) and an occasional wry smile when his witticisms hit the mark. The girl made a few steps towards selling her impressive assets to the old codger to finance the underwater research. Take away these ""sins"" and the couple will look too good for this world. And they certainly look unexpectedly simple for today's French cinema.
No effort is required to enjoy this film. You fall for the good and despise the bad. Even the final ridicule does not look like a disaster - Gregoir exits the ballroom with his lovely prize leaving the courtesans to perform their mechanical dance. And then we are informed that - unlike many of his class in Revolution years - the baron failed to become a headless aristocrat's corpse. Instead Comrade Malavoy works for common good, curing the land of it's maladies.
This time Patrice Lecont couldn't be credited with creating something disturbingly complex - but, obviously, that was not his intention. The world of this movie is worth revisiting - I did it more than once. The scenery is beautiful, the actors - very good, the message is very reassuring. The renowned French sophistication benefits the film but the usual condescending smirk is not anywhere in sight.
The director is on the mission here. Just as his film's character, Patrice Leconte is a champion. A champion of French cinema. He is not willing to adopt the American accent as his compatriot Luc Besson did, but the need to make a French films the rest of the world could enjoy is evident to him. There was an outburst of political activism when Monsieur Leconte demanded to forbid any criticizing reviews of the French-made movies before their release. He argued that such reviews result in the viewers' negative reaction to domestic produce. But finally the master decided to contribute to the cause with his art, not angry declarations.
And with The Ridicule he succeeded spectacularly.",976147200,3,3586,4.859477124183006

The superb acting and more-than-adequate subtitles of ""Ridicule"" convey not only the importance placed on verbal jousting during this era, but also the fact that larger issues -- such as dying labourers or a man's integrity -- did not receive the attention that they deserved.  Like mosquitos which suck the peasants' blood, the aristocrats are shown to serve little purpose other than to consume and infect.

886381,5,6304438184,"Hmmm, not sure why it's referred to as a book, so I hope this review shows up along with the actual video.  'Ridicule' is a brilliant film, in French, that details the quest of a idealistic nobleman as he confronts the ways of Louis XIV's court.  Gregoire Ponceludon de Malavoy wishes to see the king regarding important matters, vital to the survival of his peasants, but soon learns that court is a place where men concern themselves with matters that Ponceludon considers trivial, and where all priority is placed one's wit.  There's a bit of romance tossed in as well.  Overall, a great film that was nominated for the 1997 best foreign language picture Oscar (lost to 'Kolya'- a delightful little Czech film).  Definitely worth renting at the very least, but very enjoyable to watch over again.  END",902361600,15,804,4.7898550724637685
886471,5,6304438184,"This is a cracker of a fillum. And I don't usually go for French fillums in a big way. They tend to self-indulgence and artifice IMHO. This one is different. A great storyline. A moral theme at the heart of it. Romance and sex. Not in that order. Villains and heroes. A duel in which someone gets shot. A fascinating study in French manners in the court of Louis XVI shortly before the Cabalistically inspired (and financed) French Revolution during which he was deposed and executed. A court full of plotters, schemers, patronage-seekers, roues, rogues, narcissists, and debauches, who used 'wit' to slash and destroy all competitors for the King's patronage. It's all so deliciously wicked! Plus, it has a really happy ending ... except for the court wit who goes down in flames to the cheers of all.",1418256000,2,802,4.776978417266187

886477,5,6304438184,"As a huge fan of French director Patrice Leconte RIDICULE is undoubtably his most intelligent, witty and original.

He finds out that the way to the endear himself to the court, and in particular the King, is through the ability to slyly but cleverly ridicule its members and others.  This type of banter was known to the court to help ingratiate oneself to Louis XVI.

The script is fresh with its smart wit and the dark but humorous plot.

886480,5,6304438184,"This is a wonderful depiction of the consequences of a massive disconnect between the ""haves"" and ""have nots"" in a society. The consequences of the great disconnect in the France of Louis XVI are amply documented in history books. The movie is beautifully shot as a historical period piece. The cinematography is lush and  sensual in its tone. It's message, however, is not confined to the time period.

Charles Berling, as Le Marquis Grgoire Ponceludon de Malavoy, is the French equivalent of an English country squire.  The peasants on his estate are dying of diseases cause by a mosquito-infested swamp on his estate. He goes to Versailles to petition the king for funds to drain the swamp and save the lives of his peasants.

He arrives naively thinking that a straightforward discussion of the merits of his engineering project will win him the necessary funds.  He is soon disabused of that notion by the disdainful bureaucrats who inhabit different wings of the Versailles castle.  By chance he is fortunately taken under the wing of an experienced doctor and courtier, Le Marquis de Bellegarde, played by the excellent Jean Rochefort.

The doctor tutors de Malavoy in the ways of the court, where only wit and ridicule matter. De Malavoy finds that the only way to obtain funds for a practical project like draining a swamp is to become a favorite at court, where one must must be witty and lucky rather than smart and good. De Malavoy sets out to accomplish his practical goal which can only be achieved by engaging in an absurd gamesmanship wholly unrelated to dying peasants or the general good.  Wit gains favor and funding, ridicule results in banishment from the court.

De Malavoy is fortunate to have the wit necessary to thrive at court and to catch the attention of one of the king's beautiful courtesans, Madame de Blayac, played by the gorgeous Fanny Ardant. Madame can make or break him. His relationship with her and the doctor's beautiful daughter, Mathilde (Judith Godreche), is the pivot point of the story.  De Malavoy is called upon to put means over the end in order to save his loyal peasantry.

You will have to see the movie to discover whether de Malavoy is able to finally drain the swamp. History shows, of course, that the swamp that was Louis XVI's court was eventually drained; by the ridiculed peasants of the French Revolution.  The corruption and cynicism of a dying regime and its court are wonderfully captured in ""Ridicule"".  Both history and art are well-served in this movie.",1276387200,4,2520,4.846153846153846
886522,5,6304438184,"It's worthy to mention how the French society reacted before the rationalism ages, its response was to activate the frivolity and triviality until its maxim consequences: without Voltaire there would not be Beaumarchais. Perhaps the only adjective to qualify Versailles in the XVII Century: Ridicule.

Every age has its peculiar way to revisit the history. And Patrice Leconte has a very acidic view about Versailles in that century.  The sequence in which we watch Madame de Playac (Fanny Ardant) besmeared by rice dust introduces us into the decadent Court of Luis XVI and its itching of antechambers, where the power and the favoritisms are achieved by the verbal development of the talent.

Gregoire Ponceludon de Malavoy (Charles Berling), is descendent of a noble rural linage, who pretends to desiccate the swamps of his rustic land, devastated by fearing mosquito anopheles, guilty of that terrible disease better known as the malaria. In order to get the state aid for put in action his projects, he decides to introduce himself into Versailles and their pertaining to the palace intrigues, shared between the fresh and sincere love of Mathilde and Mrs. Blayac.

This sharp script allows us to analyze and be aware about what meant to be taken into account in those times, where the ridicule sense was a true knife in the throat of all of those who lacked or abused of it. In this sense the cleverness was an authentic tool of survival that foresaw the Darwin statement.

So, to have spirit equaled to have a certain intellectual elegance, to suggest without offending, to provoke the easy laughs but without seconds intentions like irony or the intelligent humor.

Gregoire challenges and surpasses all these obstacles even playing cards of opposite significance. He defies the enemy but not against it but with it: he knows this is the only way to get into the core of the monster.

One of the nest films of the year not only its undeniable originality but its undeniable hidden agenda in which the decadence is carved in relief through several sequences: the meeting of the Indian delegate, the sequence of the dance and the terrible ending of the theatrical representation in which the starring makes a comment out of place just at the end of the show, falling in disgrace before the politic and religious status.

Without hesitation, this is the masterwork of Patrice Leconte.",1266364800,2,2390,4.972431077694235
886523,3,6304438184,"Patrice Leconte, who directed, came to Hollywood in 1996 fully expecting to win the Oscar for best foreign film with ""Ridicule"" but lost to a bit of fluff from the Czech Republic titled ""Kolya.""  It was a shocking experience, he says in an interview.  He and his wife ducked all the parties after the ceremony was over and returned to France on the next plane; walking around Paris, he says he felt he had a sticker on his forehead that read ""loser.""  Did he get a raw deal in Hollywood?

Yes and no.

Yes because this is an interesting and entertaining film, far better than the ones Leconte competed against that year, well done and well acted.  Judith Godreche (she's on the DVD cover) and Fanny Ardant are beautiful women who create memorable characters, while Berling and Rochefort prove why they are among France's best actors.  The story itself is spot on (as the Brits say) in showing a French version of ""Nero fiddled while Rome burned"" -- in this case, how Louis XVI, who ascended to the throne in the middle of financial crisis, wasted time with trivia (verbal fisticuff competitions at court) when he should have been taking care of business, which led to a revolution, and the rest is history.

No because this sort of topic, despite the new angle, doesn't realy warm the hearts of Academy members.  And speaking of members, it doesn't help matters to start the story with a shot of a fellow whipping out his ... member (no kidding) and urinating on a dying old man who had insulted him years ago.  M. Leconte, with all due respect, this sort of thing makes you look like a bonehead in Hollywood (no pun intended).  That scene should have been taken out.  I'm guessing it turned people off and led to the warm and fuzzy ""Kolya"" getting the nod instead.  More importantly, unless viewers know French well enough to get the point of the humor and the play on words, all that will be lost in translation.  I am certain virtually no one in Hollywood knows (or cares) what alexandrine meter is and how hard it is to write poetry in French that follows such a pattern--the examples in the film are minor league stuff anyway; for the real thing, read Baudelaire.  The verbal fisticuffs give the film a high degree of arrogance and condescension that does not go over well at all in Tinseltown.

Leconte does much better when he stays away from politics, e.g. ""The Hairdresser's Husband"" and ""The Perfume of Yvonne.""  Check those out.",1246579200,3,2439,4.608796296296297

886527,5,6304438184,"Rarely do we witness an impeccable work of Art. Social issues duly addressed, it also bemuses us, and shows mean and altruistic motives combined in every person, noble or wicked. It is true frivolity doesn't come off very well in this film, but I find the contrast between l'ingnieur and la cour satisfying. I won't dance in our modern ""cours"" without having second thoughts from now on...

I love Jean Rochefort's roles, this one seems hand picked for him. Intelligence, restraint, frivolity and pragmatism alla Rousseau form this character. I'd love to have a guide in life like him!

Judith Godrche's Mathilde de Bellegarde is fine. Probably too perfect, too much avant garde for the little education a woman was afforded at that time. But well, this and the fact that both father and daughter are ""brilliant but poor"" makes me wonder if this superb film does indeed have some elements of a feuilleton, of a pop novel. Like Cinderella, Lagardere and all its Hollywood variations, like, just to name one example, ""Mona Lisa Smile"". Mathilde said the cutting phrase I most liked of this film when observed that our hero started to like the corridors of power a bit for its own sake, mistaking his wit for his destiny. I wonder why Judith hasn't appeared on more quality films. Had her part been played by a lesser actress it would have brought the film to oblivion.

Madame de Blayac is just perfect. Beautiful, cunning, devoid of feelings. L'Abb de l'Epe (Serpent) is extremely well thought of. De Bellegarde's words: ""when he speaks, it's already too late"" proved to be just too accurate. For some reason, the relationships between the two ""Marquises"" is at times like those middlebrow US films of boxers, from Rocky to ""Million dollar baby"". But I don't want to show a demeaning side of my favourite film, so I'll keep to the bright side :).

Music is, yes, PERFECT if you like the baroque. So is photography! The foggy duel with ""L'Officier Duel"", aerial views of ""le marais"" and some small moments, like the scene of the palace's flowers resembling it to a ""The cure"" song (an aspect S. Coppola's Marie Antoinette understood very well: the ""modernity"" of classic European culture). Any fool can film beauty at Versailles and Vaux-le-Vicomte. It takes a Leconte to show them under a new fresh light, ""like if we had never seen them before"".

As usual, Berling is fine. Some actors are born with ""the gift""; it's obvious he's one of the chosen ones. Yes, this film is similar to ""Dangerous Liaisons"", but I find Ridicule is far superior for having likable characters and a human story to tell besides the ""fireworks"".

The storyboard is obviously perfect. C. O. DeRiemer in Amazon, ""Terrell-4"" at IMDb said something funny, in the spirit of the film, probably a good ending for this humble review. (On F. Ardant): ""A man would be a fool not to want to bed Ardant, and even more a fool to trust her"".

Enjoy!

PS: It's true that, as this reviewer writes, good command of French is in order if you want to follow this film. It would be like drowning in a marais.

886528,5,6304438184,"H.M. Pyles's review ""Off With Their Heads"" is probably a more cogent plot synopsis than I would make time to write here, so I will forego the synopsis and refer the reader to his review for that. But I wanted to add a few comments about this film, which is a true favorite of mine...  While not averse to foreign language films, I don't watch too many of them, probably for the reasons most movie-goers in America forego them: I want to watch rather than read when an actor is performing, and I know I'm losing some contextual nuances when I watch a film in a language where I am not totally fluent.  But this is a wickedly entertaining film IN ADDITION to being a real morality play.  The stunningly gorgeous and stunningly talented Fanny Ardant really shines in this film, and to my delight, gets lots of screen time.  All of the acting is exceptional, as are the sets, costumes, et cetera.

Of course, there are a lot of differences between American and French cinema, as anyone who has seen even a few examples of French film will realize.  However this film is particularly accessible to American audiences in a few ways...  It is not terribly esoteric (like the Red, White and Blue trilogy, for example), so you don't have to struggle to understand the story as well as the language.  It's very visually appealing, as I mentioned, and it also employs that favorite of American script scenarios, The Love Triangle.  And the humor - caustic and costly as it is to the characters - really does keep one engaged.  And because this is a French rather than Hollywood production, a happy ending is not guaranteed for all concerned.  Therefore, if you want to know what happens next, you actually have to watch!

886529,5,6304438184,"I just got done watching a delightful movie by the name of ""Ridicule"".  By categorization, this would come under the category of a ""costume drama/comedy"" and it's pre-revolution setting was a key element to the movie's impact.  However, the fancy sets and costumes were not just an excuse to make a movie; the counts and countess's served to display a world of benign ignorance of the world around them (as only the 16th Century French nobility could).

The movie follows a well-meaning lesser noble who seeks to remedy the unhealthy conditions in his estate.  To do so, he must speak to the proper component in the king's government.  Getting through to the right person becomes a game for those on the inside and a farce to those on the outside.  It makes our own bureaucracy seem quite efficient in comparison.  Our hero does his best to cultivate the right persons for his quest to drain the swamp back home.  Along the way he meets up with a variety of characters that make for a nice mix of scoundrels and true nobility.  The ending is understated but the message is clear.

As this movie began, I was wondering what I was getting into.  A quick and odd twist had me wondering the same thing from a different point of view.  However, it did not take me long to buy into the premise and delivery of ""Ridicule"".  I may have over-rated it just a bit because it's brilliance caught me off guard.

886530,3,6304438184,"Sometimes with movie distribution, as with humour, timing is everything. Patrice Leconte's Ridicule is a long way from the best work from almost anyone involved, yet still proved a major arthouse success outside France, picking up Oscar and Golden Globe nominations for Best Foreign Film, winning a BAFTA as well as a nomination for the Palme D'Or at Cannes and winning four Cesars, including Best Film and Best Director, as well as another eight nominations in France itself. All of which leaves you with the suspicion that it couldn't have been up against much competition that year. It's certainly not a bad film, but at times it's almost as slight as its subject - the rules of wit and ridicule at the Court of Versailles under King Louis XVI, where you live or die by the readiness of your wit and where a single misstep can cast you into oblivion.

Charles Berling is the impoverished minor aristocrat seeking royal patronage for a drainage project to stop his peasants from dropping like flies only to discover that the only way to get near to the King in a world where wit opens any door is to demonstrate a sharper and more malicious tongue than those around him. Tutored in the rules of engagement by Jean Rochefort's friendly courtier and both championed and checked by Fanny Ardant's court predator, he briefly finds himself a sensation in a world where honesty and wit are so rarely combined, only to find himself heading for a fall.

While it's a cut above the usual dry costume drama and passes the time more than pleasantly enough, it never quite escapes the feeling of a safe and predictable morality tale while at times the wit could be sharper and the venom more prominent. There are some fine moments and Ardant gets a great screen entrance, her servants blowing powder over her naked body, but at the end of the day it manages to be a curious mixture of both a mildly satisfying diversion and slightly less than the sum of its parts. Very much like the Court of Versailles itself...

Oh, yes, it's also about the intrigues and nastiness of the royal court in the early days of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, and it's also one of the most accurate and believable re-creations of what life must have been like then. It captures attitudes about ideas and snobbery, about skill and competition that is in another ballpark from Sophia Coppola's re-creation of the time. The characters in her film would stand tonge-tied in front of any characters in this film and be held up to ridicule.  One of the most dazzling scenes in the film is a contest in which dinner guests must create rhymed couplets on a subject given them--in meter and context--where they get to be clever, brilliant and contemplative. At a recent showing to American high school students, the reaction was one of astonishment--it opened a world of expression the kids could not have imagined ever existed.

In an attempt to have the pestiferous swamp drained that is killing his town, an idealistic young doctor makes his way to the court of Louis XVI.  At court he finds that wit is the way to fame and an audience.  But there are rules; never laugh at your own jokes, don't pun, and the best wit of all is ridicule at the expense of another (who is also vying for the king's attention.)  Entangled in the lures of two beautiful women, many witty barbs are traded as the young doctor maneuvers to be seen, heard, and bankrolled in order to acheive his aims.",1159142400,8,641,4.452991452991453
886576,4,6304438184,"The first time we glimpse Madame de Blayac (Fanny Arendt)she is naked and servants are blowing white powder all over her body and face to give her the semblance of a flawless complexion. We do not know it yet but this may as well be a war painting ceremony. She and her accomplice, the appropriately named L'Abbe de Vilecourt, are two of Versailles most powerful and viscious social figures. If they decide that you are witty then you are invited to become a part of their coterie, but if you are dull then they heap their ridicule on you in one of their public disgracing ceremonies. Madame de Blayac and Vilecourt seem to thrive on their capacity for cruelty; it is the measure of their power.

Into this world trots an unsuspecting young country lord named Malavoy (Charles Berling) who desperately needs funds to drain the swamps on his estate to prevent his peasants from dying of mosquito related illnesses. The only chance he has of receiving the necessary funds is if he can gain an audience with the king. However, a whole world of courtly proprieties stand between Malavoy and the king. In short, to get to the king Malavoy must negotiate Madame de Blayac's and Vilecourt's crucible of wit.

With his natural gift for verbal display Malavoy immediately impresses Madame de Blayac and her circle but she is not the type to do anything for anybody unless she gets something out of it herself and it soon becomes clear to Malavoy that Madame de Blayac will require that he tend to her private as well as her public pleasures and in return she will see to it that he get his audience with the king.

Meanwhile en route between court and country Malavoy is robbed and left for dead on the road. A country doctor (Jean Rochefort) finds him and helps him to recover at his country estate where Malavoy falls immediately smitten with the doctor's beautiful daughter Mathilde (Judith Godreche).  Malavoy and Mathilde immediately hit it off despite the fact that the teenage Mathilde is in the process of negotiating a marriage with a man five times her age.  But as soon as Malavoy is healthy enough he must return to the court in order to press his case once again and that means a return to the courts vices and follies and, of course, to Madame de Blayac.

 As far as Malavoy is concerned as soon as he has his chance to present his case to the king his obligation to Madame de Blayac will be over but Malavoy does not realize that the game is over only when Madame de Blayac says it is over. And once Madame de Blayac discovers that Malavoy has a woman in the country her revenge is swift.

Malavoy's natural wit shines against the opulent artificial surfaces of Versailles and he defeats the overly crafted wit of Vilecourt time and again but we fear that these are only small skirmishes in a war of the wits that he cannot win. We just hope that Malavoy will be able to escape this vile world before its too late.

The most interesting scenes show a Malavoy that is not immune to the allures of court life, wealth and power and even of Madame de Blayac. And it is in these scenes that we wonder just how far he will go to get what he wants and whether there will ever be any turning back once he gets there. We see a secession of lords and barons who have their own cases to plead ridiculed and turned away and we know Malavoy's turn will eventually come, for ridicule is the courts way of keeping the insiders in and the outsiders out and Malavoy is only a guest in this world.

The ending is a surprise. It comes a little abruptly and yet it also seems perfect. The mystique of wit and ridicule (of arbitrary power or power exercised arbitrarily, and of the snobberies of high society) haunts the minds of those who were wounded as well as wowed by it even after the regime that sponsored it has vanished.",1151971200,9,3814,4.466954022988506

As a period piece (France in the final throes of King Louis XVI) it is one of the finest - visually, contextually, musically, AND it is wonderfully intelligent!  Unlike many period pieces that serve as elegant decoration for meager stories, RIDICULE carries pungent statements about the decline of aristocracy and the whispers of the cause of democracy.

A poor humanitarian travels from the ill swamps of Southern France to the court of Versailles to seek funding from the Royal Court to correct the deplorable living conditions ignored by the King.  Upon arrival he finds a vapid society diverting attention from problems that plague the kingdom by inventing word games whose purpose is to find who can is best able to ridicule the fellow shallow players of this verbal chess game. Finding he has the gift to outclass the court with his verbal wit our humanitarian is 'accepted' into nobility and spars with the finest.  For a while our humanitarian's focus is diffused by women, duels, and other diversions of the court until he finally regroups his cause and returns to the suffering sector from whence he came...with the ability to correct the conditions at last.

The cast of Director Patrice Laconte's gem is exemplary and includes such fine actors as Charles Berling, Fanny Ardant, Jean Rochefort, Judith Godr&egrave;che, Bernard Giraudeau, and the mute role so sensitively performed by Bruno Zanardi (the one constant presence who keeps us reminded of just how absurdly low the court of France has fallen).  The costumes by Christian Gasc (especially in the masked ball) are some of the more sumptuous ever created and the musical score by Antoine Duhamel and cinematography by Thierry Arbogast capture the atmosphere of both comedy and underling decay that makes this film so fine.

Truly a film for those who enjoy double entendres and acerbic wit, this film grows better with repeated viewings.  In French with English subtitles.  Grady Harp, May 05",1116547200,16,2042,5.068656716417911

886632,4,6304438184,"Patrice Leconte's film on the pageantries and sophistries of King Louis XVI's court, a place where there are many words flying about but little substance in those who utter them.

The protagonist is a low-ranked nobleman, Ponceludon de Malavoy (Charles Berling), who seeks a royal grant to drain the swamps plaguing his region. He is, unfortunately, a new-comer to the King's court and receives help from the Marquis de Bellegarde (Jean Rochefor) and his loving daughter(Judith Godrche.) Malavoy also receives the help of Madame de Blayac (Fanny Ardant) to befriend the King. As he navigates through the King's court, Malavoy is subjected to the invectives of sycophantic nobles who seek to exploit the King for their own petty needs. Malavoy soon realizes that the only weapon he has that is greater than wealth or title is his wit (esprit). As he come closer to appealing to the King, he maneuvers his wit and invective as a musketeer does his rapier.

This is somewhat of a light drama with plenty of humor/sarcasm.  I wouln't recommend this film to young teenagers or children as one or two scenes contain brief nudity which reasonable persons may consider graphic (not pornograhic though; there are no scenes showing any sexual intercourse or suggestive poses.)  The script is excellent and the story flows with the art of invective and argument. A perfect example of some of the double-entendre is when the King asks Malavoy why he has made jokes of only the aristocracy but not of him? With a controlled smile Malavoy replies, 'The King is not a subject your Majesty!'  Another great thing about this film is that there is really no major deviation from the original novel other than the ommission of one or two scenes in the novel that are are of no consequence to the main plot.

886635,5,6304438184,"The characters of ""Ridicule"" walk a tenuous line in a setting where wit is the only currency. They lead lives filled with shallow hypocrisies and carefully planned jokes. Every pleasantry is two-faced; earnestness is shunned in favour of irony. They exchange scathing bon mots and comebacks, ridiculing each other in order to be accepted. They embark upon passionless affairs to climb socially. Gravitas is frowned upon, and there is always the knowledge that one day they will lose their sharpness or go too far, and be ridiculed themselves.
Gregoire Ponceludon de Malavoy (Charles Berling) comes to the court of Versailles to see the king. He needs money to drain a disease-riddled swamp where his people work and die. His chances look slim until it turns out that he has a quick tongue. He is taken under the wing of an elderly courtier, Monsieur Bellegarde (Jean Rochefort) and trained in the ways of the court (never laugh at your own jokes, never laugh with your mouth open - and never pun).
Ponceludon is soon captivated by Bellegarde's beautiful daughter Mathilde (Judith Godreche), who has plans of her own - she is designing a diving suit and marrying a rich old man to finance it. Meanwhile, Madame de Blayac (Fanny Ardant), an affluent widow of the court with great social placing, spots Ponceludon herself and they embark upon an affair of mutual convenience. His only desire for her lies in the fact that her bedroom leads to the king, and therefore to financial gain for his project. They both know this, and there is a scene where she laughs at him and tells him, ""Learn to hide your insincerity so that I may yield without dishonour"".
Beautifully shot and wonderfully acted, ""Ridicule"" is a treat for the senses. Fanny Ardant in particular is outstanding: she is a captivating actress who should be seen more often here, and to better advantage. The film itself is perhaps a little like the French version of ""Dangerous Liaisons"". Filled with sharp wit that isn't necessarily coming out of the mouths of the characters, it serves as a reminder that perhaps we have more in common with the shallow butterflies of this film that we might care to admit.",1043971200,10,2167,4.827956989247312
886636,5,6304438184,"This reminds me a lot of Dangerous Liaisons (1988) and Valmont (1989) in its cynicism and sharp wit.  Set in France during the same time period (the eve of the French Revolution--that's the eighteenth century, reviewers), Ridicule concentrates not so much on sexual intrigues (although there is plenty of that) but on cynical wit as though in homage to Voltaire, France's master of satire whose spirit is suffused throughout.

First a warning.  Don't let the rather gross crudity of the opening scene mislead you.  That is meant merely as satire, not as a presaging of further crudities to come.  It is also meant as a kind of cinematic joke since there is no comparable female nudity in the entire film.  Indeed, there is no comparable, shall we say ""expression,"" anywhere in legitimate filmdom that I am aware of.  So let it pass or close your eyes.

Charles Berling stars as Gregoire Ponceludon de Malavoy, a country engineer who comes to Versailles to get financial backing to drain a swamp to save the peasants who are dying of mosquito-borne disease.  (""Peasants feed aristocrats as well as mosquitos."")  He discovers very quickly that a way to an audience with Louis XVI is through gaining a reputation as a clever courtier.  Guided by M. Bellegarde (Jean Rochefort), a retired courtier himself, Ponceludon quickly picks up the games of wit and ridicule that reign at court.  His quick and clever mind and youthful good looks gain the attention of the king's mistress, Madame de Blayac (Fanny Ardant) who demonstrates how access to the king can come through her bedroom.  Ponceludon is sincere only in his desire to drain the swamp and so readily allows himself to become another of Blayac's lovers in exchange for a chance to present his program to Louis XVI.

At the same time he meets Bellegarde's daughter Mathide (Judith Godrche), an idealistic beauty with a scientific bent, who is betrothed to a dying old man of wealth and position.  They fall in love, but their differing agendas keep them apart.

What makes this film such a delight is the delicious way it satirizes the decadent court of Louis XVI.  The dramatic irony is superb and absolute in the sense that at no time does director Patrice Leconte give even the slightest hint that any of the byzantine sycophants at court are aware that Danton and the Terror await them.  Throw in the impending Industrial (and scientific) Revolution symbolized in the form of Ponceludon and Mathide, and the ancien rgime with its antiquated feudal titles and corrupt privilege is seen for what it was, a parasitic anachronism, ripe to rot for destruction.

The sets, the direction and especially the acting are excellent.  Veteran Rochefort is particularly good in a part that depends on a directive and expressive face amid the whispers at court.  Berling is smooth and believable as a man with a noble mission, adroit at repartee, love and dueling, a modest and earnest hero.

Godrche is good, but seems a little restrained here.  She is an impossibly healthy, handsome beauty no man could resist.  I first saw her as a 17-year-old in The Disenchanted (1990) where her adolescent charm was carefully and craftily displayed by director Benot Jacquot.  Here Leconte concentrates on her strength of character.

Fanny Ardant's Madame de Blayac is a Machiavellian mistress of love's duplicity, very much like the Marquise de Merteuil from Dangerous Liaisons and Valmont.  Her performance compares favorably with that of Glenn Close and Annette Bening, respectively, although there is an earthy quality to Ardant that seems most realistic.  Her character is also more vulnerable.

The sets are sumptuous without being artificially showy.  The gray, high-topped wigs and the beaked-nosed masks at ball are charming and, along with the gilded attire, the caked makeup, etc., somehow suggest the true state of costume and personal hygiene circa 1784, reminding me that in those days people did not generally wear underpants or take showers.

Some bon mots:

""The soul of wit is to know one's place.""

When asked by the king to say something witty about the king himself, Ponceludon returns: ""The king is not a subject.""  The king asks if this is not a (lowly) pun, but is assured that it is a ""play on words.""

When Blayac discerns that Ponceludon is not entirely smitten with her, she responds, ""Learn to hide your insincerity so that I may yield without dishonor.""

The film closes with a scene in England on a cliff overlooking the English channel.  Bellegarde and another reflect on the changes after the revolution: ""Wit was the very air we breathed.""  ""Now the bloated rhetoric of Danton rules in place of wit.""  Bellegarde's hat is blown off by the wind.  His companion remarks: ""Better your hat than your head.""

By the way, the subtitles (and this is usually not the case) are excellent, inventive and faithful enough, while comfortably brief, to have been done by a professional translator instead of by someone handy who is passably bilingual.

Our intrepid hero decides that he will join the court of Louis the XVI to try to swing some influence. We are told that the key to advancing at court is the ability to have a malicous wit. To be able to ridicule others in an amusing way.
Our hero is said to have this ability so he decides to cash in on it. At a number of dinners he lashes out at the others and his reputation grows. In the end he is not able to gain the influence necessary. However this does not matter as the French Revolution intervenes and instead of having a corrupt government of thickie royalists the people are willing to put a bit of money into swamp drainage.
The main problem with the film is that it isn't very funny and none of the charcters have good lines. The wit is of the plodding kind "" I say that is a portrait of the Duke on his horse but it is hard to say who of the two is smarter (guffaw guffaw)"" being but one of the more shinning examples.
