7862732,1,6304145594,"This video is the standard creationist pitch. Most of the video focuses and problems with evolution and then concluding that
if any aspect of evolution is incorrect then the only possible alternative is creationism.  Crosses the line into anti-intellectualism with a touch of conspiracy theory.
The logic behind the presented arguments is simplistic, leading to errant conclusions.
Finally the conclusion of the video is that it is wrong to exclude creationism from the classroom.
The video boils down to a ""it's us against them"" argument. Less than 2 minutes over the course of the entire video is dedicated to evaluating creationism.",1050364800,7,635,5.287128712871287
