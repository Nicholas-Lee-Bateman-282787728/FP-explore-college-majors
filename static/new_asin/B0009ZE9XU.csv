2344291,5,B0009ZE9XU,Purchased to entertain 4-year old granddaughter.  Excellent!!!  She loved all of the videos!  So did we!,1189641600,,104,5.375

2344293,4,B0009ZE9XU,"My daughter fell in love with Beethoven after seeing the first movie. So of course she wanted to see the whole collection.  Well buying the Pooch Pack is much cheaper than buying them separately, and heck, even cheaper than having to keep renting them all (ha)!  This is a great collection of movies for little ones, and you can't beat the price.  I just wish they spread them out more evenly, or over 3 discs instead of only 2 with the majority of them on the first one.  I also don't care for the double sided DVDs, as my daughter is not used to handling that type and it could very well become scratched on one side.  That reason causes this rating to lose 1 star. Other than that, you will love the Pooch Pack.",1171238400,5,714,4.2592592592592595

2344296,5,B0009ZE9XU,"I bought this boxset only because I wanted to see the first one. But the single DVD of the first (and probably only great) ""Beethoven"" is full screen. This boxset has ""Beethoven"" (and its four sequels) in its original widescreen format. This DVD set has all 5 movies spread out over two discs.",1152057600,39,293,4.547169811320755

2344308,4,B0009ZE9XU,"""Beethoven: The Pooch Pack"" compiles the first 5 films in the series (of which there are 8 to date) into one collection. The series follows the lovable, mischievous  Saint Bernard  named Beethoven from puppy hood into adult hood. The Newton family is also along for  the ride as they attempt to keep the troublesome, but well meaning hound out of trouble through the course of his adventures. This collection is great fun for families. :-)",1437350400,,439,4.826666666666667

This comes with two disc, one says Beethoven's 2nd and the other says Beethoven's 5th. The first disc has all 4 movies 1&2 on one side and 3&4 on the other.

2344321,3,B0009ZE9XU,"We needed # 4 to complete the collection.  The DVD Pooch Pack was nearly the same price as the single movie we needed to complete our collection.

Number one is Okay, Number Two is marginal, the rest are (wait for it) dogs. :-)  For some reason, follow-on films always degenerate to unimaginative, formulaic, utterly predictable plot devices.  Adults and older children will enjoy the first film, but the next ones tend to tiresomeness.  Younger children love this series because it features a loveably, large dog frequently scolded for making messes or for accidentally destroying things while going about the business of living.  I suspect little ones relate very well to such a character because their own days are full of such things.

My wife and I just introduced our four year old grandson to these films during one of our regular babysitting gigs.  He is enthralled while Ouma reads and Oupa falls asleep--but then Oupa often falls asleep from his medications' side effects.  (Which is why a not yet 60 year old Oupa had to stop working and start spending more time with grandchildren, but that's another story.)",1398211200,,1120,4.914893617021277

2344325,3,B0009ZE9XU,"YES IT COULD BE BETTER, Still considering some of the other family entertainment it is OK. Some of the other Beethoven's are not really worth it these are probably the most wholesome.",1375833600,2,183,4.75
