7154490,5,B00WUBPT58,One of the greatest Evel Knievel documentaries ever.,1438560000,,52,5.625
7154491,5,B00WUBPT58,"I have other documentaries on Evel, and this one is by far the best! It's very accurate and in depth, with many conversations with his family and friends. Great footage of his jumps also. Lots of never before seen footage. I highly recommend it!",1438128000,5,245,4.590909090909091
7154492,5,B00WUBPT58,"I am a Knievel freak and have been since I was a kid. I watched the Snake River jump on PPV at a theater and sat glued to the TV every time Evel made an appearance. Back then you didn't know the man, just the stunts. This revealing film shows the real (not always likable) Evel Knievel; focusing on who he was rather than what he did.
Oh the footage from the spectacular jumps is here. So is the man behind them and the people he inspired. Bob Knievel was not a perfect man. Evel just may have been for my generation. Now I wish someone would do a documentary just on Snake River.",1438128000,4,580,4.0964912280701755

7154506,5,B00WUBPT58,"He's Evel Knievel, dammit! What else can you say? For better or worse, one of the biggest icons of the seventies.",1441238400,2,113,4.428571428571429
7154507,3,B00WUBPT58,"Not so Hot!! A Poor mixture of the Real people who Knew Evel - and 'Other' people - who just Interpret what they saw on film Of Evel.
I Love seeing his (ex?) wife Linda - and sons Robbie and Kelly. Also old friends of Evel and business partners - that Is Worth watching.
As far as Matthew McGonaughey - he seems to have Met Evel - like once (no explanation - yet) - but he would have been a better Narrator - than a Pretend celebrity to Interview.
They also Waste our time (viewers) with people - like that TV chef with the funky hair - standing next to an orange motocross bike - like he's a Jumper (Come On!!). - Or - that young woman - looks like a model - who probably Never even Met Evel.: (
Hey - if they wanted to waste time - they could have Interviewed Me too!! - Cause I Never met him Either!!
I'd rather this be Shorter - than listen to people tell me their Interpretations of Evel. - Hell I can watch footage and share
my conclusions too.
They Skipped Many interviews - with Travis Pastrana, Mike Metzger etc.
Robbie Maddison Does make Some comments in this DVD.
On anther note; I'm in my 50's now - and I Don't idolize Evel like I did when I was a kid. - Sure he's interesting and had guts -
but - I Don't admire him when he Stole or Robbed people.
Evel used to lecture about 'Don't use a Narcotic' - then he'd smoke cigarettes. - Or -
Don't use drugs - then he'd go out and get drunk.
I'm just saying - when you admire him - please - be aware - he also had a dark side to him.
p.s. This DVD is in one of the CHEAPEST/Crappy cases I've seen!!
Thanks, Scott M.",1441152000,,1572,3.9778481012658227

8714298,5,B00WUBPT58,"Excellent documentary. If you are a fan or have a passing knowledge of the man it's worth checking out. I live in the SF Bay area and remember the Hell's Angel's problem when he jumped here. I love the Paramount film EVEL KNIEVEL and am waiting for it to get a proper release on Blu (or even DVD for that matter). There is a kind of 'public domain' DVD but it's awful. I got this as a three dollar add on which made it a must have. Ironically Amazon shipped it separately, go figure.",1527465600,,483,4.148936170212766
8714299,3,B00WUBPT58,"Boy I wanted to like this but there's too many talking heads and not enough vintage footage of Evel doing his thing.  What footage there is is used over and over again.
I just can't get behind it, as much as I wanted to.",1525132800,,220,4.0
