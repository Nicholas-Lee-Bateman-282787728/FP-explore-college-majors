8522727,5,B007WUXHMO,"Outstanding analysis of the evidence for the historicity and reliability and accuracy of the bible.  If you have only heard the bible is sheer myth and unsubstantiated, read this book to be intellectually challenged about your presuppositions!",1384905600,,243,5.5675675675675675
8522728,2,B007WUXHMO,"Dr. Daniel Wallace is an amazing New Testament scholar, whom I respect highly. His Greek Grammar Beyond the Basics is a seminary textbook on Greek syntax and grammar. I use it often in my exegetical studies. The Center for the Study of New Testament Manuscripts which he founded has a wonderful mission - to digitally photograph every New Testament manuscript in order to preserve them for future generations and to reconstruct the original text of the New Testament with even greater accuracy and certainty. However, the presentation in this DVD is not very engaging, and lacks theological coherence.

This first part (What the Manuscripts Reveal) was pretty boring, and had more to do with the Center's work to preserve the manuscripts than it did with the manuscripts themselves. We really learned very little about what the manuscripts reveal. The second part (The Bible Jesus Knew) is really about why we should trust the Bible - because Jesus trusted the Bible! It discusses Jesus as the central figure of all Scripture. It is clear through this section that Wallace is addressing an unbelieving audience, or people who have very little or no knowledge of the Bible. That helps make sense of the whole purpose, but means that Christians will find little help in growing their understanding here. Also, we didn't learn anything about the Bible of Jesus' day (Old Testament and Septuagint), which is what I was looking forward to. The third part (What History Reveals) interviews Dr. Peter Williams from the Tyndale House at Cambridge. Dr. Williams essentially tries to give a basic apologetic for the Bible, discussing issues such as violence in the Old Testament, the judgment of God, the commands to destroy whole societies like the Canaanites, alleged contradictions and the historicity of Scripture. However, I found his answers to be entirely unconvincing and not centered around God's glory. There are far better apologetic responses to these important questions (I would recommend John Frame and Greg Bahnsen to start with). In addition, even though the audience is clearly unbelievers, there is no clear gospel presentation. There is a good focus on the centrality of Jesus in the Bible, but no help at all in how to come to know Him as Savior and Lord. Therefore, even though I respect Dr. Wallace, the organization and presentation of the materials is incoherent, and the gospel of Jesus Christ is not central. What I was expecting (from the title) is a deeper look into the historicity and transmission of the biblical text since the original writings. Unfortunately, it isn't what I received.",1341705600,,2609,5.0533642691415315
