7988077,5,B00008YYV8,"I remember when Rocket Robin Hood was in reruns during the late 1970s/early 80s on TV in Canada. I did not know until recently that the show was made in Toronto, and was surprised that something as classic as this series was a Canadian production.

Volume 1 of the series focused largely on the classic, familiar storyline of the original Robin Hood, adapted to an outer space setting. Rocket Robin & his merry men routinely attacked the wicked Prince John & crooked Sheriff of N.O.T.T., confiscating their stolen riches to give them to the poor peasants the Prince & Sheriff had stolen them from. Volume 2 is considerably different; Prince John & the Sheriff only appear in 1 or 2 episodes. The villains were much darker, literally & figuratively, in this volume. They included such dark, sinister men as the fiendish Dr. Medulla ('The Living Planet', 'Slaves of Medulla'), Dr. Manta ('From Menace to Menace'), Nocturne, Infinata ('Dementia Five', 'Return Trip'), and the Warlord of Saturn. My personal favorite - and most memorable - was Emperor Tut ('The Solar Sphinx', 'Jaws of Steel'), who ruled a planet called Nilor and used robotic Egyptian mummies to terrorize Robin & his men, and when they escaped that, unleashed a giant, monstrous flying sphinx on them.

The only problem I have with it is the repeated vignettes during the episodes that show some of the different characters & songs. While one can fast forward through them, it gets a bit tiresome seeing them over & over.

A classic cartoon that will bring back lots of memories to anyone who remembers it.",1398902400,2,1571,4.854477611940299
7988078,4,B00008YYV8,"Rocket Robinhood came from a very eclectic period in television when the format was less defined and wide open to artistic license. So if you grew up watching this program, you will immediately remember (and understand) it's jerky editing and oddly placed musical introductions. If you are new to this format, you will be lost on it's production values. RR is very much a generational piece that does not reveal itself to be stretched beyond the bounds of the children watching it during that period. It was cheap eye candy that will have nostalgic value to those who remember it. Fans of the show will be surprised by it's rich images and suitable sound quality. Nothing that will compete with your standard Blu-ray values, but suitable for vintage cartoon viewing. Volume 2 does appear to have richer production quality in it's transfer. Plenty of eye popping color that will transmit your senses back to the late 60's when anything was possible on television. A worth while investment for kids of that era.",1376524800,3,1009,4.872093023255814
7988079,4,B00008YYV8,"Having already watched the first set, we decided to also grab volume 2. Incredibly, the second set of episodes sees a huge jump in quality. the drawing style, story lines, and character designs are all top notch sixties sci-fi cartoon! If you thought that the first set was just goofy, I'd strongly urge you to check out this one. Very different stuff not to be missed.",1365638400,3,369,4.606060606060606
