When she falls in love with the neighbor, whos a crippled war vet, her mother refuses to let her see him again because she doesnt want Mary to waste her time on a cripple. Meanwhile, the local rogue stalks Mary. Janet Gaynor plays the teen role well, much as Mary Pickford did. This is a sweet, sad story and a well-crafted silent. Great directing and beautiful cinematography. The emotion and suspense will keep you focused on this film. The Gaynor/Farrell matchup is perfect, and this film is must see viewing.",1498262400,2,577,4.7227722772277225
