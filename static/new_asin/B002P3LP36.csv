3963606,5,B002P3LP36,"I have contacted Warner Brothers as to when the third (3rd) season of this awesome TV series will be released, I contacted them August 2010. I was informed by their marketing dept that the release of season 3 is slated for November 2011 !!!!!!!!!! Why the long dely I asked? Their response was that ""I don't quite really know""? This TV series finished airing several years ago in Australia and even 'Pay for TV' has also has run it several times (all seasons) and no longer air any of the show's. I for one cannot understand why Warners are so reticent in making this show more readily available, it staggers belief as there is such an enormous following world wide for it as it is one of the few absolutly excellent TV series that transcends all cultures, genders and groups of interest. No matter your age (except those of more tender years), many of us have grown up enjoying the gripping story lines, excellent acting and very realistic scenes that the shows were shot at. Third Watch is one of those few shows that when watching it, it feels as if you, the watcher, could just step right into the TV and become a part of the show itself. Many times I was left awed and stunned at what transpired in a show, several times emotional enough to even shed a tear, and I am 48 year old male not usually prone to such expressions of emotions. There is little available on TV or movies of this calibre, so to the DVD many of us must go - please Warners, please, Please, PLEASE release all the remaining seasons forthwith and season 3 A.S.A.P.  Can I suggest a world wide demonstration of all interested Third Watch 'addicts' and we all contact Warner Brothers simultaneously requesting for them to get their collective 'acts' together and supply the consumer with a product that we all quite clearly desire and dare I even say it - DEMAND ????",1299196800,115,1840,4.508982035928144
3963607,5,B002P3LP36,"Warner Home Video produced the show for NBC. If you want to see Season Three on DVD, contact them and ask them what's the hold up. I assume it's due to the music rights in the episodes. Time/Warner does not like to pay royalties so I assume season's 3-6 will never get distributed on DVD for that very reason. :(",1294272000,2,312,4.216666666666667
3963608,5,B002P3LP36,"Ok it's seems to have been 2 years ago when I got Season 2. I've been waiting forever for the rest of the seasons but nothing is happening. You can get dvds for all of the seasons of shows...some seasons are released right after the season finales, some released after the show is cancelled, and even dvds have been released for TV shows that haven't been on in years. I can go to the store right now and get all of the seasons for I Love Lucy, Three's Company, etc. but can't get all of the seasons for Third Watch and not to mention that it went off the air in the mid 2000's, but shows that went off the air back in the 70's, 80's and 90's are easy to find!!
I mean by the time the 3rd season of Third Watch is released I'm going to want to go back and look at Seasons 1 & 2 first!! I wonder if we can contact NBC since they were the channel that ran Third Watch through all of the seasons and see if someone there knows or at least have an idea of when the other seasons will be released!! This RIDICULOUS!!
Oh and for those of you who have never seen Third Watch...trust me..it was one of the BEST police, crime, drama shows on TV!! It was really popular and that's why so many people (including myself) are upset that we're waiting so long for seasons 3-6 to be released!!",1291939200,10,1278,4.075396825396825

3963610,5,B002P3LP36,Hey guys from what Im reading online there still having issues with the music that was on the show.  I guess they never got the ok to reproduce the songs on dvd when the show goes to DVD.  This is the same reason that the first two seasons took so long to get out on DVD.  Sit tight this is a great show and will eventually make its way to DVD.,1286668800,52,344,3.816901408450704

3963621,5,B002P3LP36,"I started watching this show back in 1999 when it first came out. I was 5 years old (watching it behind my parents' backs) and, literally, grew up on this show. Watching this show shaped my entire future. I watched every episode on NBC and even stayed up late or got up early to watch the reruns on A&E. I watched all six seasons again and again when they were available for free on YouTube (before the uploader's account was terminated for copyright infringement). I must have watched every single episode at least 20 times. But every time I watch this show I learn something new and am emotionally touched just the same. This show is my life and I am devastated that over 15 years have gone by and the complete boxset collection of all 6 seasons is still legally unavailable for purchase. I have held out on giving in to purchasing bootlegged copies of the show, but if Warner Bros doesn't come out with the complete boxset soon, I fear that my patience will wear thin. Loyal fans and consumers are desperate for the series to have justice and be properly honored on DVD or Blu-Ray. At this point, I don't care if it comes out on Laser Disk or VHS. I just have to have it. There's a reason the bootlegged versions are still out there and available for purchase.

3963623,4,B002P3LP36,"Here's a thought.......Change the damn music if that is what is holding up the release. Most, of us won't remeber what was played anyway. I'm am sure you can find an awesome replacement set of tunes to fit each situation. If my memory serves me - a lot of it was orchestra based. So fill in the gaps with PiNK or Taylor Swift for all I care (please don't though) just PAY THE ROYALTIES WARNER BROS AND STOP BEING CHEAP.  You will make a killing by releasing the rest of the series. Don't you see how successful these shows are?????  Obviously it has nothing to do with the music so just tell the public why and we will move on.",1415491200,14,627,4.216666666666667

3963630,5,B002P3LP36,"I don't know what good this will do if any but i had to write something somewhere. Third Watch was the best show to ever air on NBC. It deserves to be on DVD. If anyone has any ideas, anything we could try please share, I'm up for anything. Petitions, a kickstarter campaign, befriending a billionaire getting them into the series and then having them pay off the copyrighted stuff, there has to be SOMETHING we can do.
Third Watch is one of the greatest shows ever. The rest of the series being held back from DVD release is a great injustice to everyone involved. How do these awful reality shows and one season wonders get DVD releases yet a wonderful, completed show isn't being shown the same care? Change/delete the music, we don't care! This isn't Glee, it's not going to mess up anything if you replace now expensive songs with something else.
We have to keep letting them know we want these DVDs, we can't give up. And please Warner Bros, don't release one season and then wait several years to do the rest. That would be rude.",1366243200,30,1036,4.457894736842105

When I began watching it on my widescreen TV I discovered that it was not available in widescreen.

But there's the other side of the issue:
TV Networks and studios control us viewers like puppets on strings, and there's nothing we can do about it. They pull our favorite shows off the air and refuse to release the shows on DVD, and we're left not knowing why. It's all for business reasons, and if it involves any legal or contractual issues, they will never tell us.

One of my favorite shows NYPD Blue ran for 12 seasons, but they stopped the DVDs at season 4.
Maybe the studio didn't make enough money from the last DVD set to produce more.

Personally, I don't think the studios realized back in 1999 when they were producing a TV series that there would be a demand for DVD sets later. They probably didn't write a clause into everyone's contract, and now they don't want to work out all the legal issues.  Newer shows  already have DVD sales worked into the contracts, that's why we see them coming out on DVD so quickly.",1314057600,3,1040,4.312820512820513

In March 2015, Crave TV began streaming the first three seasons. Its always about greed!!!! Most of us couldn't care less about the music!!!",1498521600,,336,4.616666666666666
8376614,5,B002P3LP36,After waiting many years for season 3 4 5  and 6 to come out on DVD I finally bought a bootleg copy on ioffer and I'm so happy I did. I enjoyed watching it very very much. I had only seen the first 2 seasons that I bought at Walmart. When Warner finally releases the rest of the series ( if they ever do ) I will buy the legal copies. I emailed them and told them that thousands of people were tired of waiting for the rest of the series to be released and that I was buying a bootleg  LOL,1487116800,10,489,3.784313725490196
