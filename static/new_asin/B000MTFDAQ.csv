2747223,4,B000MTFDAQ,"Shinichi ""Sonny"" Chiba in one of his most famous roles. When this was played in California in the 80's for the first time it brought Sonny Chiba & ninjas further into american culture, AND, created a cult following! A must have for fans of the genre!",1358121600,,250,4.456521739130435
2747224,5,B000MTFDAQ,"This series is very good and I am waiting eagerly for the second season to came out.
The plot of each episode is good. Most of them are not very original but some are.
The fight scenes are excellent.
There is some nudity . Chiba disguises itself as a bath house owner and so there are many scenes with female customer showing their breasts. The ladies that appear half naked are beautiful so I can only applaud.",1306540800,,411,4.35064935064935
2747225,5,B000MTFDAQ,"Oh god, I don't even know where to start with this DVD set.  Ninjas?  Check.  Sonny Chiba?  Check.  70s style soundtrack that doesn't necessarily fit into a period-themed show but somehow manages to help the show kick all forms of butt?  Check.  Tons of fight scenes and Shogunate intrigue?  Check, check, check!!  Kage no Gundan is such an awesome show and it's kinda sad that we don't have the other seasons here, but this set is just packed to the gills with stuff that for any Ninja / Sonny Chiba fan, it's hard to miss out.  Definitely get this one, pop it in and watch with other like-minded friends who dig this stuff and you're set for some good times.  Shadow Warriors rules!!",1303948800,,685,4.487804878048781
2747226,5,B000MTFDAQ,"We first saw this series on television 25 years ago, and enjoyed it.  I happened across this boxed set, and thought we could relive the pleasure again.

The acting is good.  The plots are a bit obtuse in the first few episodes, but they do set the tone for the rest of the story.  The writing and dialogue improve a LOT later in the season.",1294444800,,340,4.184615384615385
2747227,5,B000MTFDAQ,"The real first season of ""Kage no Gundan"" was black and white, with no subtitles when it was televised in the USA in the 1980s. Sonny Chiba played Taro Hanzo instead of Hattori Hanzo, and it was set a generation before this series. This is an excellent TV series, however. (Add: SDJ's comment is correct. ""Taro Hanzo was the lead in Kage no Gundan III not the first."" It has been too long since I saw these series on TV. I can't remember the first series' character name. But I wish they would release all years of the series.)",1292976000,,527,4.333333333333333
2747228,5,B000MTFDAQ,"Shodow Warriors is one of my favorite period dramas it has a great blend of action,comedy,and romance. Along with a fantastic cast with action superstar Sonny Chiba at the helm as Hattori Hanzo the thrid. If you like period dramas or if you are a fan of Sonny Chiba then Shadow Warriors is a must own. I'm not going into detail about the story so i don't spoil anything. Just buy it if you like this sort of movie and you will not regret it",1279670400,,440,4.188235294117647
2747229,4,B000MTFDAQ,Excellent.  The product was great and the shipping and received time was excellent.  Exactly what I was looking for.  Will definitely order again from this vendor.,1268524800,,163,5.1923076923076925
2747230,5,B000MTFDAQ,"This is cool stuff people. It's not for everyone. If you like or love Sonny Chiba,you'll love this series. It has a little bit of everything in it. It's funny,dramatic,silly,noble and has a good amount of ninja action. It is however a TV series from Japan at a time when they were wide-open on what they were able to show on TV.It has nudity,blood spraying,limb removal and so on. All in all for about 20 bucks you get 27 episodes an interview with Chiba-san and 2 Chiba movie's besides( make sure you order from the right seller not all of them give the extra 2 movies.) It will keep you entertained for hours and hours! :)",1268352000,,624,4.387931034482759
2747231,5,B000MTFDAQ,"ok so finally i get a chance to get all of them in a set....holy cow its amazing...so first off my chest if you are a ninjutsu practcionor or a wannabe or a student or a enthusist this is a must have piece of japanese history and television here guys..i will say that right off...i am also told soke hatsumi had a little to do with this one as well...
now on the review while i agree it could have been remastered and beefed up for the times you have to remember japanese tv in the 80s was about 8 years ahead of us as far as film so it really isn't a deal breaker of anysorts..it isn't the bloody mess of anime you would expect either because its made for tv...it does have some blood..but honestly these shows are btter than alot of the usa ninja movies ,...i kid you not at the time..all in worth buying foir anyone who wants to see real ninjutsu...with a little fiction thrown in...one of my top picks buy!!!!",1268092800,,913,4.193181818181818
2747232,3,B000MTFDAQ,"Arrived so fast, but each show is very similar in drama/story line, needs little more variety in subject matter",1264896000,,111,4.894736842105263
2747263,5,B000MTFDAQ,"This is my favorite Ninja Series.  The last time I watched these shows were in the late 80s.  I have to say I am more than satisifed with the quality of the DVDs given the originals were televised in the early 80s.  At the time, I tried to catch what I could on Japanese television and recorded episodes on Beta tapes!  During one of my moves in the early 90s, I lost the tapes and have been waiting for a release like this since then.  The only sighting of Sonny Chiba as Hanzo since then was on Kill Bill.
Great series.  Awesome deal on Amazon.  How do we get more released?",1263340800,2,576,4.135135135135135
2747264,5,B000MTFDAQ,"i was very satisfied with this DVD . it had all action and great acting with sunny Chiba i remember back in the ""80""s .looking forward to season 2 of this series !!!",1260230400,2,165,4.03030303030303
2747265,2,B000MTFDAQ,I presume that the previous reviewers all spoke Japanese. That's about the only way you will understand this series. The English subtitles are completely unreadable and useless. What a waste!,1259798400,2,191,5.4
2747266,5,B000MTFDAQ,"If you like Ninja storylines, you'll love Kage No Gundan (this first series).  Sonny Chiba plays Hattori Hanzo, the leader of the Igas who were framed and then relinquished of their duties as official spies for the Shogunate ten years prior.  The Igas only want to be left alone and have peace in the land, but their successors, the Koga are paranoid that the Igas want their old title back.  Meanwhile, the new Shogun is a child, and that is cause for political turmoil.  The guardian of the new Shogun enlists Hanzo and his band to fight the bad guys and keep peace in the land.
I think what makes this series great is the diversity of the episodes.  Although it is formulatic (after all, it is a tv show from 1980), each episodes contains great action scenes, drama and comedy. Sonny Chiba is great in this, and it gives him the opportunity to play serious killer, understanding leader, and silly undercover guise. And if there is one thing that Japanese cinema, television included, does well, is that of the tragic romance - and sure enough, this series has it, which involves Hattori Hanzo. All in all, a great televison series.",1240876800,3,1134,4.621890547263682
2747267,5,B000MTFDAQ,"Where I grew up (the LA Metro area) we did not get cable tv until like 1982 and actually quality has been in a steady decline ever since.
We had 3 independent stations (I remember my dad let me stay up late on a school night to watch the Deer Hunter uncut on KCOP) and very local UHF channels (18,22,52,and 28 which was PBS) where I watched this series when it originally aired here on Sunday night, right on the heels of the very popular Yagyu Conspiracy (also starring Chiba that was a spin off of the movie which I highly recommend).
And at the same time my other favorite show New Wave Theatre was also on every week on the same channel!!!
This is the best in the series of 'Kage no Gundam' productions, I think it went up to III or IV and should have ended with II. This was cool b/c in the Yagyu Conspiracy the Iga were used as pawns and now we got to view it at the 'grunt' level - whereas the YC was like a typical war movie and KnG was like 'Band of Brothers'.
It would have been way better to watch the YC first b/c it would give background and context to this show, especially all the theories of what was happening during this period (there is a reason why there is so many movies and anime about this period b/c it is a mystery) as well as a look at the 3 headed beast of Japanese politics.
I am looking forward to this, but have to admit I will miss the commercials, especially the used car salesman 'JAX' - imagine a Japanese Jerry Lewis, who learned the trade from a Texan. My mom would get pissed at us every week b/c we would say 'oh look it's your boyfriend'-she hadn't figured out that if she ignored us we would have stopped. So every week she would get all huffy while me and my dad would laugh, it got to a point where we would just look at each other and she would get pissed.

Man I miss UHF...I think I just really miss my dad",1232928000,8,1852,4.073972602739726
2747268,5,B000MTFDAQ,"i am a huge ""sonny chiba"" fan and enjoyed watching this program on TV when
""Japanese Theatre"" showed here in Sacramento!!  The Shadow Warriors was one of my favorite shows, along with The Yagyu Conspiracy.  I hope there
will be more Shadow Warriors very soon. Kris Roche",1226793600,,270,4.723404255319149
2747269,5,B000MTFDAQ,"If you are into martial art movies and ninjas this is a must have.  This is where Quentin Tarrentino got some of his ideas for his Kill Bill series.  Hence the Taro Hanzo sword.  It is in Japanese with english subtitles.  The nice thing too about this series is it is not edited for American Television.  So expect to see more blood shed and a little nudity.  For mature audiences. Some may complain about the video quality, but you have to realize when the series was made.  I feel the series is well written for the most part and draws your interest with excitement.  Hanzo is one awesome respected ninja leading his Iga Clan of ninjas against evil in feudal Japan.  Enjoy.",1206662400,13,675,4.467213114754099
2747270,5,B000MTFDAQ,"A must have for anyone interested in early Ninja/Samurai TV series from Japan.  First in a series featuring Sonny Chiba (Chiba Shinchi) as Hattori Hanzo the chief of the Iga ninjas.  Good action, decent storylines, and very good acting by a variety of supporting characters.  Subtitling is decent and easy to read.  This is one of the main sources of inspiration for Kill Bill.  Only available in poorly copied bootleg VHS and DVDs for many years so it is great to have a quality transfer at a very reasonable price.  I hope they put out the rest of the series soon.",1193011200,7,566,4.554455445544554
2747271,4,B000MTFDAQ,"Kage no Gundan Hattori Hanzo (Shadow Warriors) is an excellent series with a mix of drama and action. Sonny Chiba is great as Hattori Hanzo by portraying him with emotion. The rest of the cast did a great job and there is a heavy amount of big cast of guest actors and actresses. The action sequences are good to watch especially when Hanzo and his band of Iga ninjas finishes off the enemies. If you are big into jidaigeki (period drama), you might want to try and see this one. I've seen this series repeatedly over and over since I got a hold of it.",1187740800,26,552,4.266666666666667
2747272,5,B000MTFDAQ,"We found this series very enjoyable. I bought it because I wanted to see how Shinichi/Sonny Chiba became associated with Hattori Hanzo, since in movies Chiba tends to be a supporting character or bad guy rather than H.H. himself. I am not disappointed: we like the characters, the stories, and the combination of action, drama, and humor. At about $30 per hour-long episode it is a very good deal.
  I only have two complaints:
  1) we want to watch more but only the first season seems available;
  2) Chiba's Hattori Hanzo does not say ""VERY GOOOOOD!"" even once! :o)
(Maybe it's because the H.H. in Okinawa who makes the exquisite blade for
B. Kiddo/""The Bride"" is meant to be a descendant centuries later.)",1183161600,2,709,4.723577235772358
8171838,5,B000MTFDAQ,"This was one of my favorite shows from that era. It's been quite awhile already since the 1st season was released, still waiting on the rest since there were 5 seasons total. The other favorite was Yagyu Jubei Abaretabi which I have the whole series of.",1525219200,,253,4.521739130434782
