5690959,5,B00C5UV3YU,Destiny's Child I'd like to have I've been a fan for about 16 years since the group was back in the hay day Girls Tyme !! it's been my TLC for all these years and i'm glad for there many success as a Group & in there solo efforts!!,1375488000,,231,3.7346938775510203
5690960,5,B00C5UV3YU,To any out there that is a huge DC3 fan this is a great buy. To have all the great video from when they started so young to the final video is such a great collection to your DVD's to have. I don't regret buying thing at all.,1374019200,,225,3.7083333333333335
5690961,5,B00C5UV3YU,I love the DVD it's has all the number one hits by the best selling female group it's a must have if your a fan of dc4 and dc3,1373587200,,126,3.3793103448275863
5690962,5,B00C5UV3YU,"I loved the dvd especially the performance of Survivor.  Survivor is the greatest song that I have heard in a long time.  I can relate to the song because I am a ""Survivor"" myself.",1373155200,,180,4.264705882352941
5690963,3,B00C5UV3YU,"It is amusing to hear these ladies sing lyrics about their values and Christian faith yet their entire repertoire is based on music videos selling their bodies as sex objects (even singing about such.) It is less of an indictment of these three ladies than it is about the genre in which they perform. The entire pop music market is about sex. Who can show the most skin, without being censored wins the jackpot. No matter that the pressures placed on these individuals to stay ""bikini skinny"" and to perfect the dance moves while hardly eating and resting, the only thing that matters is that they are deemed sexy by the so-called fans and the industry moguls. What a shame.

I hope, one of these days, Kelly Rowland will actually learn that music is a true artform and that being a stripper (like Beyonce' Knowles) is not... and thus will mature into contemporary adult music, instead of this teen lust, street thug, burlesque-like stuff that she now performs (along with her band mates).

But, that aside, these ladies are beautiful and they do dance incredibly suggestively enough to warrant admiration (even if for the wrong reasons.) Most of the music is laughable, but that is to be expected from the genre. Only when they perform ballads do these ladies shine as truly beautiful women - not just as eye candy but as real vocalists.

The video is worth 3 stars for the naughtiness. Toni Braxton's video collection is superior.",1372118400,,1433,4.746987951807229
5690964,5,B00C5UV3YU,"I am so excited to get this collection of videos by the greatest female group at the turn of the century. I have been patiently awaiting this release for months now. No other girl group does it for me quite like Destiny's Child. This is going to be pure bliss for me.

No matter what the line-up may have been, these ladies always brought style, class, looks, clever lyricism and some of the most beautiful harmonies ever. I seriously cannot wait until this arrives at my doorstep. Destiny's Child is my all-time favorite group (male or female).

Anyone familiar with this group knows that these videos are truly iconic and have helped cement these ladies as legends!!!

I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE INTERESTED IN WITNESSING THE LAST GREAT GIRL GROUP AT THEIR BEST.",1370217600,7,769,4.723880597014926
5690965,2,B00C5UV3YU,"The news of this DVD, much like the news of their ""Love Songs"" CD, comes as a disappointment. Not only have these videos NOT been remastered in HD and put on Blu-ray, but this collection serves as a ""Greatest Hits"" video collection and not the complete anthology us big fans have been waiting for. I wouldn't be surprised if the videos weren't even anamorphic widescreen since Beyonc's ""B'Day Video Anthology"" and ""Above and Beyonc"" DVD's were not. Missing from this collection are EIGHT music videos

01. ""With Me (Part II) [feat. Jermaine Dupri]""
02. ""Get on the Bus (feat. Timbaland)""
03. ""Bug a Boo (Refugee Camp Remix) [feat. Wylcef Jean]""
04. ""Jumpin', Jumpin' (So So Def Remix) [feat. Jermaine Dupri, Da Brat & Lil Bow Wow]""
05. ""Survivor (Remix feat. Da Brat)""
06. ""8 Days of Christmas""
07. ""Nasty Girl""
08. ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"".

Granted, some of these would feel a bit out of place or be a bit redundant, but the non-remix, non-holiday videos should have been included, without question. I'm giving this DVD two stars because it really is a bargain release at under fifteen dollars, but at the end of the day, you get what you pay for. Will I buy this? Yes. Am I disappointed? Extremely. I'm settling, big-time - because it's either this or do what I have to do now, which is pop in various random Destiny's Child releases to watch the few videos that have been included on them. Here's to hoping Columbia records catches up with the time and gives us a Blu-ray disc with ALL of their videos, in anamorphic widescreen (where it applies) and heck, they can still be in standard definition, but an HD remastering would be amazing.",1366070400,19,1650,4.686206896551724
5690966,5,B00C5UV3YU,"These videos prove why Destiny Child is the Top Girl Group Of All Time! There show their dancing talents,fashion and the bond they share is beyond magic!

5690968,4,B00C5UV3YU,Love this collection. Much more of an overview of their career as one of the most successful female groups of all time. The videos include the original line up and all members in between until the final trio was formed. I would have loved some live performances as bonus features or something but this was still great.,1432857600,,318,4.5964912280701755
5690969,5,B00C5UV3YU,The DVD has 16 musicvideos of Destiny's Child in great picture quality.,1432252800,,71,5.0
5690970,5,B00C5UV3YU,I love these videos even the remix ones. Glad to relive the videos. They seem to have all their videos. The disc came in good contention. Minor thing the case was not like a regular one. It was thin clear case like bigger cd case!  As picky as I am and the videos I love I make this work in my collection...,1426464000,,307,3.9516129032258065

5690974,4,B00C5UV3YU,"This video collection features all of Destiny's Child most popular videos but a few are left out, which were ""With Me"", ""Bug a Boo"" (Refugee Camp Remix featuring Wyclef Jean), ""Jumpin' Jumpin'"" (So So Def Remix featuring Lil' Bow Wow, Jermaine Dupri and Da Brat), ""8 Days of Christmas"" and ""Nasty Girl"". If you wanted a complete collection featuring every single one of their music videos, then this is not what you'll get, but if you are interested in watching the music videos they are surely known for, then you might enjoy this. Overall, it's a good but incomplete collection that has two ordering mistakes: ""Independent Women"" should come before ""Survivor"" and ""Stand Up for Love"" should come after ""Cater 2 U"".",1387843200,2,716,4.877049180327869
