I also used to watch M.A.S.H. the TV series and knew who Loretta Switt was. (the narrator to this episode) ANYHOW, obviously, this VHS is clearly dated, but the video doesn't sugar coat the ups and downs of preservation efforts for this Wild Black Footed Ferret or any other conservation effort. As a matter of fact, the same type of conservation for the Black Footed Ferret is still being used today 2014, and is successful because of the learning curve introduced in this VHS!!

**I got this VHS because after several years as the mother of a maturing family, we once again have PET ferrets in the house and my children were interested in the wild populations of the Black Footed Ferret in the U.S. So, I began searching NETFLIX and HULU to see if I could find this episode- with no luck. So... I decided to spend the money on this gently used VHS tape that I got off of Amazon, so that my sons could finally watch the episode on the Black Footed Ferret. They sat entranced and watched it from beginning to end and then began to ask me all kinds of 'nature' based questions.

After the VHS of the Black Footed Ferret was over, the subject of conservation of the Black Footed Ferret and other animals came up and sparked an interest in my kids in other areas of wildlife. As a result they are more aware of the positive PURPOSE of conservation in many respects and have gotten more involved in their science classes and their local FFoA (Future Farmers of America) chapters.

So, in short, even a 20+ year old -dated film can spark a flame in growing animal lovers minds!!",1405641600,,1744,4.460815047021944
