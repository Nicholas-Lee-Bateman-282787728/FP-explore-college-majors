6245406,5,B00I099JI2,Incredible price! And I couldn't believe it had so many of my favorite movies on one disc!,1462147200,,90,4.352941176470588
8637899,5,B00I099JI2,"A solid collection of teen rom-com/coming-of-age flicks. IMHO the best of the lot is Fired Up (5 stars); predictable, but funny and well executed.

Then come Can't Hardly Wait (graduation night party humor); and High School High (tough, inner-city school comedy).  I would give these 4 stars; you won't be sorry you watched them.

Next up: Loser (new guy at college); and Dancer, Pop. 81 (will small-town high school grads leave or stay?).  These are 3 star; good, but not quite as well executed.

Finally, Excess Baggage.  This one disappointed.  The lead actors (Benecio Del Toro and Alicia Silverstone) played dislikeable characters who, predictably, fall in love in a plotline that doesn't really hold together.  I'd give this one a generous 1 1/2 stars.

The combined package of 6 movies is a steal and well worth watching.  I'll be watching all, except Excess Baggage, more than once.",1531180800,,890,4.993197278911564

8637904,5,B00I099JI2,The whole reason I bought this is for the Excess Baggage movie. I've been wanting it on dvd for years. I would have payed way more than 5 bucks for just the one movie alone and now I have a few extra movies I can see if I like.,1471478400,,227,3.6530612244897958
