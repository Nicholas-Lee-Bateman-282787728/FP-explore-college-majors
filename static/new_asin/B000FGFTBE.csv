2565266,5,B000FGFTBE,"I stalked this listing forever waiting for it to become available again and when it did I jumped on it! I finally saw it again ordered it and absolutely am thrilled to have it in my collection.  It's everything I remember from the first and only time I saw it on television forever ago.

Only complaint I have is the box was completely in shambles when I received it and literally fell to pieces when I pulled it from the envelope but aside from that the DVD was in pristine condition and I replaced the box with a different box from an old work out video or something, put the insert from the Rivals DVD where the other insert had been and now it's just like new.",1334102400,,664,4.2204724409448815

2565268,5,B000FGFTBE,"I saw the movie Rivals on LMN. Because I deemed it a very good movie I decided to buy a copy. My first stop was Amazon; unfortunately it's only sold for Region 2 players.

I also checked other DVD/CD sites, and Lifetime/LMN but no luck there either.

Will Rivals ever be made as a Region 1 DVD? It's an excellent movie. Thanks, Toni",1314316800,3,332,4.253968253968254

8122366,5,B000FGFTBE,"So I won't complain about Region 1 vs. Region 2...but I will share my thoughts on this movie.
I first saw this film what seems like eons ago, many moons.  This is based upon actual events.  As a true crime buff, how can I resist?

Laurie Show (played by Jennifer Finnigan) was a high school sophomore from Pennsylvania who was brutally murdered in 1991 by a jealous bully who had stalked her for nearly a year.  The killer was Lisa Michelle Lambert (played by Marne Patterson) a pregnant high school dropout who believed that Laurie wanted to steal her boyfriend.

The good...the acting is superb, although a bit cheesy at times.  But all of the actors are very talented.  Marne Patterson's performance was downright chilling; she nailed Lisa Lambert's evil stare  and cruelty, not to mention that unlike the real Lambert, Patterson is absolutely gorgeous.  I am a straight woman and I admired her beauty.

The bad...I have very few criticisms about this movie except that some liberties were taken with the real story, although many facts remained true to the case.  Lisa Michelle was never a prom queen.  She quit high school at an early age.  She had three brothers, not two little sisters as depicted in the film.  And she was not friendly with Laurie at all.  In fact, the book ""Overkill"" by Lyn Riddle states that Lisa picked on Laurie long before she killed her.  The movie shows the two girls hanging out, Lisa being nice to her, etc.  That is not true...they were never friends.  And other things were dramatized as well like Tabitha Buck (one of the accused) supposedly having a lesbian crush on Lisa.  To my knowledge, this is false.  Tabitha was a new kid in town who sometimes hung out with Lisa but she had no sexual interest in her.  I'm not sure why the producers decided to make it seem that way.
I believe that Tabitha was just a girl who followed the wrong crowd and was caught up in a situation that resulted in her receiving a life sentence.

Also, with Jennifer Finnigan playing Laurie...she conveys emotions very well but I don't know.  At times she seemed a bit too sweet and perky, which can come across a bit fake...but then again, I was a pretty sullen girl as a teen.  Also, the movie depicts her as genuinely attracted to Lawrence ""Butch"" Yunkin (played by Rel Hunt) but I'm not sure this was true in real life.  So many accounts state that they were just friends or acquaintances who dated casually...it was not a serious relationship at all.  And there is also the issue of Laurie's claim that he raped her; I believe she told the truth about that, but this movie makes me wonder at times if there was more to the story.

Lambert is portrayed as the vindictive blonde killer, Yunkin as the macho stud, Laurie as the doe-eyed victim, and Tabitha Buck as the deranged creepy lesbian so infatuated with Lambert that she will do anything to win her heart...even if it means murder.
This is definitely a must-see movie although some might classify it as a ""chick flick"".  But it is really about the dark side of humanity and how emotions can spiral dangerously out of control, to the point of no return.

5 Stars all the way!",1412208000,,3151,4.566844919786096
8122367,5,B000FGFTBE,"I LOVE this movie. I thought my DVD player would have trouble playing the movie, but I had no problems at all. I tried looking on EBAY for this movie, but it would have costed in total about $24, so I tried amazon. This movie was definitely worth the wait for the total of $4 I spent on it. I rate this movie an A+, although it took a while to be shipped.",1405641600,,355,3.8767123287671232
