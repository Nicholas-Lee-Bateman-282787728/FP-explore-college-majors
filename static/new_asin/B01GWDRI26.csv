8764154,5,B01GWDRI26,"A train trip aboard the Shanghai Express in the midst of a civil war focuses on the intrigue and romance surrounding the notorious courtesan, Shanghai Lily. This is a simple film that starts slowly but builds in suspense and interest. Dietrich is superb, the cinematography enhances Dietrichs beauty and mystique, and von Sternbergs direction makes this film a classic. There are many excellent Dietrich films, but this is quintessential Dietrich and must see viewing.",1497139200,,468,5.337837837837838
