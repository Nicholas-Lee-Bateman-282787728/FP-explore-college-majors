1641222,4,B00005OM4Z,"Video one begins on the floor with an intense ab routine followed by glutes.  After doing the original basic series for 3 months, five times a week, I decided to try something else.  I have done this video for three weeks now and it's still very difficult to get through the glutes section.  However, I don't feel right if I don't do this ab routine.  Other ab routines from other videos just don't give me the same benefits.
Video two focuses more on the legs.  One irritating thing is that he keeps saying in what I perceive as the hardest part of the workout that this is just the basic video.  It's not very encouraging.  I do like how Billy reminds you to focus and you'll get through it.
I have damaged cartilage in my right knee from years of dancing, so I look for videos that are entertaining, mentally stimulating, but provide as little impact as possible.  Video two strains my knee, so I have only done it five times and prefer video one, given visible improvements in my abdominals and posture after just three weeks.",1022889600,17,1030,4.470588235294118
1641223,5,B00005OM4Z,"I have been cardio-kickboxing for years, so when I recently decided to buy some DVDs and weights for working out at home, I was eager to try out the much-hyped Tae Bo workout. I thought the Basics workouts would be too easy, and I do add a little more bounce to my workout than is in the tapes (when I have the energy, that is). I was wrong. With a solid effort, these ""basic"" workouts can kick your [behind! It is also good to have workouts divided into 25 minute (and one 8 minute) segments, if you don't have time for an hour's worth of exercise or if you want to reverse order for variety. Blanks has good form and uses all the basic stretches, punches, and kicks that my instructors over the years have used. He explains each move for those who are unfamiliar, and he starts slowly with each new move. (If this is too slow for me, I simply double-time it.) I also like Blanks' supportive, ""let's have fun doing this"" attitude and friendly encouragement. I am looking forward to getting the advanced DVDs for more combinations and greater variety of moves.",1017964800,30,1060,4.441025641025641
1641224,4,B00005OM4Z,"I just purchased this DVD and I absolutely love it!  I have done kickboxing in the past but this is the first time doing TaeBoe.  Billy Banks does a beautiful job putting this DVD together..there are many different types of people involved in the class and he is there to motivate you throughout.  If you want to learn TaeBoe, I really think this is the one to try.  He teaches you the basics..I can't wait to move to the TaeBoe II Advanced.  GOOD LUCK!!!",1014163200,7,455,4.369047619047619
1641225,5,B00005OM4Z,"I recently purchased a buy 2 and get one free at the local Wal-Mart store.  To get the third 8 minute tape you have to mail in the card that come with the set of tapes.  I did everything that I was suppose to do to receive my free tape and it has not arrive yet.  The instructions said to allow 3-4 weeks for delivery, but the deadline has come and gone.
I bought Taebo when it first came out.  I was very happy with that set, but unfortunately they was damaged by my grandson.  So I went to get me a new set of tapes, but the set is incomplete without the third tape.
Please send me the 8 minute workout video.  I would appreciate it very much.  I apologize for using this site to complain about a missing video.  I like the tapes, I believe that anyone who use Taebo will get the results they are looking for.  My address is:  Barry B. Brown

1641226,4,B00005OM4Z,I purchase this workout video to increase my flexiblity and to my surprise within 3 weeks my flexibilty has improved.  It is fun to use and I use it more than my treadmill.  My entire family work out using the tapes.  Very good product and I highly recommend it.,1009584000,3,262,4.3061224489795915
1641227,4,B00005OM4Z,"This is the third in the Taebo series of workouts I have purchased in two years (the first was the original studio workout I purchased on VHS and the second was the complete Taebo Live on DVD).  I've had this set for a week and a half, and have worked out with it five times.  I purchased this set after having fallen in love with the original Taebo Live DVD set, and I cannot say that I am at all disappointed.
As ever, the workouts start quickly, getting your blood pumping and your body stretched out.  The Basic Workout #1 is, to my tastes, a bit tame.  Remember, I've been doing this for a while now.  I should purchase the Advanced set next, but as I am the mother of a year old baby, often I have only one half hour to spare and would rather feel I've completed a full workout.  If you have the original Taebo Live Basic Workout, you will understand what I mean by tame.  There is a definite decrease in the amount of strenuous kicking required in the Get Ripped Basic Workout #1.  I think that for the beginner, this is a good idea.  In fact, I believe that this Get Ripped Basic Workout #1 is more in tune with what a beginner can accomplish that the original Taebo Live set.
The Taebo Live Get Ripped Basic Workout #2 takes the viewer right into a rather strenuous stretch routine which goes directly into a workout that targets stomach and butt muscles.  This section lasts 8-9 minutes and is intense.  I felt the results the next day.  Man, was I sore.  After this section, you get up off the floor and get kicking.  The tone in this 2nd workout is far more energized, and the group is quite lively.  This is not exactly a BEGINNER workout (very unlike Basic #1).  (BTW no amount of ab workouts with the ab-rolling gizmo I bought ions ago ever made me feel this sore - and I guess that's why it never worked!)
The 8 minute workout is a tough one.  Don't think it's an easy out by the length of it.  It's very energized and requires a good deal of stamina.  And again, the 8 minute refers to the actual workout time, not the warm up or cool down sections.  All in all, it's more like 15 minutes.
A note about the DVD itself:  If you bought the previous Taebo Live DVD set, I think you will be as pleased as I am that the navigation leads you directly into the workout, instead of the advertisements for active wear, the scripted music video sequence, etc.  I did not really like the fact that after the workouts in the Get Ripped DVD, I was subjected to Malibu Naturals advertising - a vitamin reselling program that states that you can be fit while ""realizing your financial goals.""  Gimme a break!
Also:  The Special section is in fact just a string of more ads... no interview with Billy Blanks this time, and the Taebo Heroes section is just the infomercial all over again, unlike the original ""Live"" where individuals were interviewed in regard to their accomplishments.
All in all a good purchase... a very good workout.",1004313600,179,2937,4.356617647058823
1641228,5,B00005OM4Z,I saw this video listed as one of the Top 10 Best Men's Workout Videos by Men's Health. I ordered it for my 14 year old son. He has already lost 3 lbs.

1641230,2,B00005OM4Z,"I worked with the original set of Tae Bo workouts many years ago and at the time they were pretty innovative and fun to use. Hearing many good things about this edition I gave it a shot and unfortunately, very little has changed except all the moves seem double-time making things really awkward and difficult to manuever. I quickly got bored with it and put it away. Its not very inspiring and I really didn't care for it.",1355788800,,423,4.435897435897436

1641237,4,B00005OM4Z,"Yeah, this is a pretty good work out. It makes you sweat. The 8 minute work out will make you have a heart attack if you are not careful! I liked how there were heavy people and older people along with the super in shape people. I suspect that this work out has good results. I myself have only done it three times, so I wouldn't REALLY know. But after those three times, I felt fantastic! It's worth a shot.",1154822400,2,408,4.1125
1641238,5,B00005OM4Z,"I bought this DVD almost three years ago. These were the first two Tae Bo workouts I ever did. At that time I was fat and unhealthy and depressed. Tae Bo helped me pull myself back up. There is something about the music and the moves (and Billy!) that pulled me in so that I WANTED TO WORKOUT!!! I found myself arranging my day around my workout. Now I have become a lifelong exerciser and am addicted to kickboxing. You have to love the workout or you won't do it, and for me Tae Bo is easy to love because it is so fun.

After I had been doing these two Basic workouts for a couple of months, I started the Get Ripped Advanced (awesome workouts!!) and then later I got the Advanced Live 1-12 workouts off eBay (even more awesome!!). Now I have about 30 or so Tae Bo workouts. I cannot say enough good things about Tae Bo. It changed my life.

I see these workouts as a great starting point for someone wanting to get fit. If you have never had any martial arts instruction, consider getting the Instructional workout first so you will have good form and not hurt yourself. Otherwise, have fun!",1152316800,12,1095,4.285024154589372
1641239,5,B00005OM4Z,"I bought the Tae-bo ""Get Ripped II"" Basic series last week, and I love it. Tae-bo ""Get Ripped II"" is now my primary workout program with a little yoga here and there. I found the pace a little fast in the beginning, but since then I have eventually learned the moves and can now match the pace.

I use the shorter 8-minute version as either a lighter workout (later in the day), or when I haven't got the time in the morning for the longer 20 minute workout (which is closer to 30 when you factor in the warm-up and cool-down stretches).

This is a great workout for anyone who is really, really serious about losing weight and staying in shape.

I highly recommend it!

1641240,5,B00005OM4Z,"This is a great workout. I initially bought thr Get Ripped Advanced workout and after I embarassed myself to no return, I decided to start with something a little easier. I am very pleased with this workout. It is not so easy that you will breeze through it. After a few workouts, I have yet to finish the tape without stopping a bunch of times. (Which Billy says is OK). The only problem that I can find is that Billy loses count a lot. He will say one more set and you sometimes actually end up doing three more sets. You can look at that as a plus though; you are going the extra mile! At the beginning of the tape there are commercials of some sort, which I fast foward through. I don't know if you can skip them on a DVD player however. Either way, I am VERY pleased with this workout and would highly recommend to beginners of all ages.",1139270400,6,842,4.171779141104294
1641241,4,B00005OM4Z,"Let me be clear. I never bought these type of videos before because I always thought they were kind of dorky! But this one is actually great! I had read the previous review carefully before making a decision to purchase and two things definitely held true. 1) Do not try to skip ahead and purchase the intermediate routines if you have never done this before. Some people think just because they already have a descent exercise program going that they don't have to start out with the basic workout. If you skip, YOU WILL BE LOST!!! There are a lot of moves that you have to get use to in the first program. And you will need to get these down first because in the upcoming tapes, the moves get really difficult. And at first its hard getting use to switching routines which Billy will do on a dime. So keep your remote near you to stop the program and rewind. (That's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.) But, as people in previous reviews have written, YOU'LL GET USE TO IT! Get this tape down packed before moving on. 2) YOU WILL SWEAT!!! Its a great workout even though it only lasts for a little over 20 minutes. For those who have a exercise program, what I do is go through the routine twice. You will love the burn. And his tape is not boring. I use it mainly as a alternate Cardio day to burn calories with my 3 weight lifting days to total and round out a solid four day workout week. It is a great buy.",1126742400,8,1413,4.198529411764706
1641242,4,B00005OM4Z,"Since this is the first Taebo video I have ever used in my life, I found it difficult at first. But I've also done some martial arts in the past. So, after exercising with it for two weeks or so, it became increasingly easier and manageable. I work up a sweat with it and usually have to stop once in the middle of the workout to catch my breath, so it gives me the push I need to lose weight. Billy is supportive but can be a little repetitive in his ""come on""s and ""work it""s (which I find kind of funny :D). Overall, this is a good exercise dvd for those who have exercised before but not so great for people with bad balance or who have never done a front or side kick before.",1125273600,3,680,4.007352941176471
1641243,5,B00005OM4Z,Finally a new Basic DVD!  I've used the very first basic tape so many times that i cant watch it anymore because the tape is so bad now. With the 2 basic workouts its easy to alternate workouts to whichever I wanted to.  With the help of the origional tape and a great diet i've dropped 98lbs so far in the past 10 months.  I also have the advanced workout which is longer than the 30 min each basic workouts. I was not disapointed with this dvd.,1121731200,7,446,4.103448275862069
1641244,5,B00005OM4Z,Definitely not for beginners and it will get your heart pumping faaaaaaaaaast,1120867200,,77,5.5
1641245,5,B00005OM4Z,"This is a great workout. I just did the Tae Bo Get Ripped Advanced 1 just now. It was AWESOME!!! I was able to do the full hour on my first time doing it (okay, form might not have been perfect, balance was off, etc, but I did it). I'm in pretty good shape. I bike, I was in dance for two years and baton for ten years. My biggest set back is my eating disorder, so I probably shouldn't even be working out this hard, but I love Tae Bo. It's so awesome. It leaves me feeling so refreshed and energetic.

I never did the Advanced Tae Bo from the orginal 4 pack. I went from the Basic one from when I was about 13 (I'm 18 now) and then didn't do Tae Bo again until this past year when I did Tae Bo Cardio 1. That got old and easy pretty fast so I picked this up.

I will be doing this DVD for awhile. It won't be getting easy for a VERY long time.",1120262400,,845,3.768361581920904
1641246,5,B00005OM4Z,"I used this DVD for combination ideas a year ago when I was teaching cardio kickboxing. Today, I still workout with it when I want a good sweat. It's easy to follow, and I have it memorized in counts so I can play my own music to it because his counting gets a little dull, however it is great for people who need to focus on the moves and rhythm of the movement. You will work up a sweat with this one.

I also reccommend his recent ones with Bootcamp style, because it involves music and strength. Just a warning though: he goes a bit too fast with the resistant band at times. Stay with a steady safe pace so you are sore in a good way and not a bad way.",1118102400,,657,3.977272727272727
1641247,5,B00005OM4Z,"I have been following Billy Blanks Tae Bo tapes since 1999.  I was skeptical, as I had never been a fan of home exercise videos.  I had been active in the gym with weights, running, and advanced step classes and never thought I could get a decent workout from a video.  Boy was I wrong!  I started with Tae Bo Advanced Live Vol 1 and became so addicted I bought 5 more volumes!!!  Now I own Tae Bo Bootcamp, Cardio Blast, and most recently the Tae Bo Advanced Get Ripped workouts!

I have nothing but great things to say about these videos!  The first one is definitely more challenging cardiovascular wise, but the second is still a workout!  I love all the imperfections(even the uneven sides!), because it's more realistic to being in a real class!  I don't want some perfectly choregraphed model telling me to step it up!  I want to see some sweat!!

I am stronger and more toned at 33 years old and one son, than I ever thought about being 6 years ago when I started these videos.  I have continued to incorporate these videos with my regular gym workout. Plus, I don't have an excuse when I can't make it to the gym!!",1115856000,3,1123,4.346153846153846
1641248,4,B00005OM4Z,"This is a pretty good cardio workout. If you have a minimal amount of time, this gets the job done and gets your heart rate up. I am more bias towards the 1st workout which is a straight cardio workout as opposed to the second with floor work.

I love Billy's encouraging words, it helps move along the workout. Do this for about a month or so if your a regular exerciser than progress to the advance, which is going to be my ultimate workout goal.",1107907200,,448,4.209302325581396
1641249,5,B00005OM4Z,I love tae-bo ans was not disappointd with this dvd. I did tae-bo until I was about 8 mo pregnant (obviously I had to adapt a few moves)and have started on this series to get back into my pre-preg body. These workouts include more stretching that in the first series and a longer cool down period. There are 2 basic work-outs and an 8 min which is great. They are more fast paced but include new moves and incorporate floor work for abs and glutes but not to the extent you see in the advanced tapes. There is still the occasional too many sets on one side but if you alternate which side you start with you will always get a complete work out. these are the only tapes I can do at home and not get bored. I alwasy feel like I get a great workout. Great purchase and I will buy more.,1104019200,3,783,4.090909090909091

1641251,3,B00005OM4Z,"This 2-tape set consists of two basic Tae Bo routines.  Basic Workout 1 includes floor work in addition to a standing kickboxing routine.  This video begins with instructor Billy Blank's standard 5-minute stretch routine.  Following the warmup comes the toning segment:  4 minutes of abs work and then 4 minutes of targeted glutes work performed on hands and knees.  Then Billy leads one of his basic kickboxing routines consisting mainly of punches with some knee lifts and kicks thrown in; Billy also emphasizes the abs while in a standing position.  The kickboxing segment lasts about 10 minutes, and a final 3 minutes of cool-down stretches complete this 26-minute workout.  Basic Workout 2 is entirely a standing kickboxing routine.  There is a similar warmup (about 4 minutes) followed by an approximately 18-minute cardio workout.  Billy does a few more combinations here, and again, he always reminds you to work your abdominals from a standing position.  This workout ends with a Tai Chi type cool-down segment.
As an instructor, Billy Blanks is very likeable and extremely enthusiastic. However, his counting is not always accurate, and he frequently completes an uneven number of sets from one side of the body to the other.  These tapes would be good for those who like simple kickboxing routines focused mainly on punches and which include some toning in addition to cardio.",1084060800,18,1387,5.12

Es un ejercicio bastante fuerte, por lo cual a los que estamos un poco sobrepeso se nos puede hacer un poco dificil al principio, pero despues te diviertes muchisimo.  No le di una puntuacion de 5 solo por que la segunda parte me parece un poco monotona.  Pero por lo dem&aacute;s es excelente.  EXITO!!!",1080691200,4,481,4.359550561797753
1641253,5,B00005OM4Z,"Though these are called basic, they will still give you a great cardio workout.  The moves are explained well enough that a beginner could start here without the instructional videos.  One of the videos starts out with a short abs workout and dog-style glute exercises and then goes into cardio and the other is entirely cardio, but both have a good cardio workout.  There are enough repetitions to make you sweat, but not so many that most people won't be able to complete them.  The combinations are easy to follow, and the instructions are clear.  It is a little annoying the Billy Blanks always says go right when he's going right when most people following will be doing mirror images to follow along and thus going left, but that's a small complaint.  These two videos are a great addition to any workout plan and work great for cross training.  For longer workouts just move on to the advanced tapes.",1041638400,39,907,4.666666666666667

I was slightly disappointed with this 2-pack ""Get Ripped"", because one of the tapes is mostly just a ""on-the-floor"" work out, and I wanted more cardio, and the other tape is fine, but it is easier for me than the one I already have (Tae Bo Basic), I only use this new tape on the days when I am too tired for the workout in general, but want to pretend that I am doing ""something"".

All i have to say is that Michelle, can be a bit too annoying saying ""all right"" every minute, but after a while, you learn to block it outta your mind while doing the tapes!
and one other thing, Billy always has different number of sets for ever exercise! that is annoying, and he does it on every tape! ah well.....the workout is what matters!

As a result my fitness suffered and I put on a lot of weight. I looked for a way that I could exercise without the difficulty of trying to find a safe area in strange cities when travelling alone, often overseas. I purchased this DVD as a trial to see if it would give me good aerobic exercise within the confines of my hotel room and be fun at the same time. It was great! I do the exercise in the privacy, safety and comfort of my hotel room first thing in the mornings before my meetings. I feel great energy when I go to my meetings and I don't seem to get as stiff as I used to get after sitting all day. Besides, I have the option of another half hour session at night before going to bed. The exercises are fun, physically challenging and it's almost like being in a real exercise class with real people around me when I do it. The TaeBo DVD and my lap top are the first things I pack when travelling now. My fitness has started to pick up and I'm working on losing thast weight.

7948913,5,B00005OM4Z,"This is my favorite DVD workout. I have used my original since 2002, and played it nearly every day. My original eventually wore out. I was able to buy a replacement in nearly new condition for just a few bucks on Amazon. It arrived on time, in great condition, and will undoubtedly allow me another 13 years of exercise with Billy Blanks.",1437868800,,339,4.483870967741935

7948915,5,B00005OM4Z,"I have been doing the newer TaeBo workouts for years but recently decided to pick up some of the older workouts and go back to the early years of TaeBo.  I remember having this workout series on VHS years ago, and it always kicked my but.  I have to say I was not disappointed when I received this DVD.  Of all the TaeBo basic workouts I have done over the years, these two are easily right at the top of the list.  They are well done, easy to follow but difficult to master the first or second time through.  These routines are a great addition to your collection and can easily be added into your rotation of workouts to change things up when you feel like it.  I highly recommend these two workouts.",1424304000,2,702,4.2406015037593985
