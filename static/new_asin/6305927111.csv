8078804,1,6305927111,"A few months ago several friends and myself were accosted in a pub by a (relatively sober) Glaswegian man who had been listening in our conversation about movies. According to this man the most 'amazing' film he had ever seen was called 'How Sleep the Brave' and from how he described it made 'Platoon' and 'Full Metal Jacket' look like 'Carry on in 'Nam'. He insisted we seek it out. Needless to say we did not.

However, by some cruel twist of fate one of my friends was given the film on DVD at Christmas (the film now called 'Combat Zone - How Sleep the Brave' by Castle Video). One by one we all watched it. The only thing amazing about this movie is the fact it got made at all - I consider this film as worse than 'Silver Dream Racer' and that's saying something. It's clearly been filmed on a piece of English scrubland - as was 'Full Metal Jacket', but with a budget of about 50 and six pack of Bud - unlike 'Full Metal Jacket'. The picture quality was appalling, editing/continuity hysterical (man alive, dead, alive again) - this alone is worth watching the film for as viewer confusion makes for some amusing moments. The black guy in the film seemed to die twice at least (30 minutes apart) and one man upon getting shot seemed to drop a joint of beef on the floor, which I assume was supposed to be his innards, but as there was no blood (at all) it just looked like he'd dropped his shopping. I won't mention the Huey helicopter they couldn't afford. As for the story, well there isn't one - it's all shouting about [...], [...] and Saigon while calling each other [...].

If you watched this film in the early 80's and enjoyed it, I suggest you do not see again for the sake of nostalgia - time has not been kind. I you have not seen it save yourself 90 minutes of time to do something else. Having said that it did provide an evening's worth of entertaining conversation at the pub afterwards - this time without a Scotsman interjecting with future viewing advice.",1144195200,2,1981,4.380434782608695
