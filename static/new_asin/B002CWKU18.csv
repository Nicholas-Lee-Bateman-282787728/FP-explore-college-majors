3907237,5,B002CWKU18,"These two movies would make a fine blu ray package!  Blacula"" is a awesome flick coming in the early seventies when the american cinema was letting loose with great new wave black films, made for black audiences often they still hold up today and this one was a crossover b movie sucess!  It spawned a great sequel and it's as good as the first one. This one is similiar to the count yorga series of the same era and other cool seventies vamp flicks. This isn't twighlight but blacula in spite of it's exploitation name is a fine all around vamp flick. The lead character follows the standard sympathetic lonely vampire story in which he wants his long lost lover back , in the form of a woman from his 1970's present.  he's a proud caharcter adn a prince no less!  Who returns in the second movie to reek more havoc.  In a recent episode of the hit series ""psych"" the guster character dresses up as 'blacula' and people can't remember him, the other character remarks ""only quentin taratino remembers blacula'. This isn't the case as blacula is a excellent vampire flick with excellent acting.  Many of us remember and love these movies, these are not camp movies in spite of the name. And truthfully the hair styles of the early 70's would match the hair styles of the 1500's - early 1800's anyways.  so it's all good. The dvd's look ok, with not too much damage or dirt on them. These are good flicks if you like vamp movies.  And the early 70's had some good vamp flicks for sure. Including vampire circus"" among others.",1320364800,8,1524,4.496376811594203
3907238,5,B002CWKU18,"In BLACULA, Prince Mamuwalde (William Marshall) is bitten by Dracula, turning him into an undead bloodsucker. Centuries later (in 1972), Mamuwalde is released from his coffin by two interior decorators, causing a vampiric assault as the Prince slakes his thirst for human hemoglobin. Marshall is wonderful as the title character, biting his way through to the cop-tossing finale at the local chemical plant. SCREAM, BLACULA, SCREAM has Mamuwalde (Marshall again) resurrected by a voodoo ritual, allowing him to once again bring terror and bloodshed. Pam Grier (COFFY, FOXY BROWN) is in this one, looking as H-O-T as ever, and adding a great deal of fun to the viewing experience! Her role as a voodoo practitioner is solid.

3907240,3,B002CWKU18,"I remember watching ""Blacula"" and ""Scream Blacula Scream"" a few years after they were released to the big screen.  My Mom and Dad would not take me to see them at the local theaters.  A late night Halloween special was my first experience with these fine films.  While my younger family members used words like stink or awful or Dad you like this garbage, it made me happy to be born in the early '60s.  What made these two films happen for me was I could still use my imagination.  No naked people, no excessive gore or torture.  Just a story line good acting for its time and a lot of fun.  Who did not cheer for Blacula when that female cabbie got in his chops and he bites her right in the neck.  How many of us wish we could do that when getting busted on?  Then he tears out the throats out of the two street dudes who were going to roll him. Go Blacula, do it baby! Who thinks Pam Grier is still hot after all of these years? She can bite my neck anytime.  It was scary then and it is appreciated now.  While these films will probably not win any awards, it will be cherished by those of us while watching this movie remembered the great times we had when these flicks came out.

3907241,5,B002CWKU18,i could not believe that a black man was hired to play a vampire. i own both of these movies but the first one i can say is my favorite not bringing down the second one it was great to but the first one is by far my favorite,1276387200,,224,3.5918367346938775
3907242,3,B002CWKU18,"I saw these films back when I was a teenager.  The shock value is still there but do not look too carefully.  The deep-bass voiced and renown stage actor, William Marshall (The Cartoon King on Pee-Wee's Playhouse) is regal as African Prince Mamuwalde who was turned into a vampire.  He pines for his dead wife, Luva (Vonetta McGee) and laments over Dracula's treachery that resulted in his vampirism. This was the first of two Blacula films and ushered in a number of black horror films.  The film itself, follows the formula which was set in LA of the early-1970s.  Of course, Mamuwalde runs into a modern-day woman, Tina (Vonetta McGee) who bares a striking resemblance to his long-dead wife. It works mainly because of Marshall's heartfelt performance and some truly scary scenes. This is a must-see for vampire film fans.",1272585600,18,825,4.864285714285714

3907272,1,B002CWKU18,"The movie ""Blacula"" is not good.  Mediocre acting, even from William Marshall who should have been better, and the guy playing the actual Dracula pretty much ""sucks"" too.  The writing is terrible based on a rather silly concept.  Even the costumes are all over the map in terms of quality.  Some of them are okay but Blacula's costume in the initial scenes where he's supposed to be in the 1700's look like a standard 1970's black business suit and dress shirt accompanied by just a slightly odd tie.  This is also true of Dracula's three servants (yes, in this version, Dracula has servants), but the costume for Blacula's wife is more authentic looking for someone who is supposed to be from Africa.  Oh, and did I mention the horde of vampire followers?  There's no consistency there either, it looks like each of them did his or her own makeup based on wildly different concepts.

3907290,4,B002CWKU18,"BLACULA (1972)
From my 1967-75 movie blog (By all means follow me!)
http://ianchampion-ianvoicing.blogspot.co.uk/2015/07/blacula-1972-as-blaxploitation-proved.html

As Blaxploitation proved itself a commercial field for box-office appeal, studios looked at expanding the urban crime stories by mixing in aspects of other trendy genres. BLACULA, made by AIP, was the first of the horror cycle and despite its name is surprisingly good.
Part of its success is the casting of the debonair, urbane Shakespearian actor William Marshall whose deep cultured tones lend a welcome gravitas to the central role of African Prince Mamuwalde. In a 1780 prologue at Castle Dracula in Transylvania, the Prince attempts to persuade the Count to release his people from slavery (a brief nod to history). His insolence is rewarded by Dracula biting him into fanged immortality, cursing his people for ever and murdering his wife Luva (Vonetta McGee). These scenes are shot with care and the rich colours that fit right into the Hammer style. Already we feel that this is not a silly cash-in but a commendably straight-faced horror film.
From here we shift to the present day where a pair of cringe-inducing gay stereotyped decorators buy the property and ship Mamuwaldes coffin to Los Angeles. The stage is set for Mamulwalde  (called the black avenger in the trailer) to rise again, suck the blood from the modern urban world and seduce whom he believes is his lost love in the lookalike form of Tina (McGee again). These beats are well-played for their sincerity and also the romanticism of the noble reunited after centuries with his eternal love).  Along the way, he attracts a hunting nemesis in police pathologist Dr Gordon Thomas, a solidly Shaft-esque hero, Thalmus Rasalala and his partner Peters (Gordon Pinsent).  He is aided by a pleasing cameo from Elisha Cook as the morgue attendant.
After converting a bevy of victims to vampiric servitude, Mamuwalde is tracked down to a warehouse. Here the nest of vampires descend on the police in a satisfying Fulci-style zombie attack-wave. Tina is shot by the police in the melee and Mamuwalde has no choice but to tragically save her by turning her to a vampire. When she is staked by Peters, the Prince of Darkness is so consumed by loss that he commits suicide by fatally baring his body to the searing sunlight on the roof .  I cant think of another vampire film where the central Dracula figure takes his own life in the climax, so this ranks for me as another gratifying surprise to add to the movie being the first depiction of a black vampire on screen.
BLACULA is played as a straight-forward horror movie avoiding almost all of the camp absurdity or spoofery you might expect from the premise and proved successful enough (grossing over $1m) for the sequel SCREAM, BLACULA SCREAM the next year.  Its lively, nicely paced and has the bonus of funky live club performances by The Hues Corporation amidst the refreshing soul score rather than traditional classical horror orchestration. Undead and uncommon fun.",1438041600,,3055,5.087824351297405

So if you pick Chapter 6 based on the photo representation, you will likely have to skip two more Chapters with your controller to get to that scene. A commentary by a David Walker, who apparently is a writer in hollywood,  for Blacula, is interesting in its observations and is the only extra that the DVD didn't have. Richard Lawson did commentary for SBS, the second movie and which he had role in was also pretty good and he is still active  in Hollywood.

This was a real sloppy release, the reason I gave 3 stars is for Willliam Marshalls performance, which really is what makes these movies worthwhile and the only good thing about this BD release overall.",1428969600,4,811,4.541095890410959
3907305,4,B002CWKU18,"This review is for the first film, ""Blacula"" -- more specifically for the hilarious commentary by David Walker. Walker, if you don't know, was the editor of a blaxploitation zine from the '90s called ""Badazz Mofo."" He is a student of African-American Cinema of the '70s and his research shows. What makes the commentary so hilarious is that he interviewed some of the actors in the film and he isn't afraid to say what he really thinks. For instance, Walker claims that William Crain was a hack TV director -- which is true. The film is superior because of its excellent cast headed by Shakespearean actor William Marshall and the always great Thalmus (""Cool Breeze"") Rasulala. Some great shots of early 1970s Los Angeles and some socio-political commentary by Walker about the film make this a great blu ray to pick up. Colors hold up and audio is ok. This isn't the best blu ray release I've ever seen but considering the original source material and crappy TV-style lighting it's probably about as good as you'll get.

3907309,4,B002CWKU18,"Scream Factory performs its magic again by reviving not one but two cult classics from the grave. Blaxploitation gems Blacula and Scream, Blacula, Scream get the high-definition treatment in this must-have double feature. However, I cant imagine the release won't face some controversy based on some of its dated content.

In Blacula, an African prince (William Marshall) gets turned into a vampire by Count Dracula (Charles McCauley) during a visit to Transylvania. Sealed in a coffin for several lifetimes, Blacula reawakens in 1970s Los Angeles. Leaving a trail of bloodless victims in his wake, he pursues Lina (Vonetta McGee), a woman who bears a striking resemblance to his dead wife. Meanwhile, Dr. Gordon Thomas (Thalmus Rasulala) and top cop Lt. Peters (Gordon Pinsent) are hot on the bloodsucker's trail.

Scream, Blacula, Scream follows up the original when a hated rival, Lisa Fortier (Pam Grier), is chosen to lead the voodoo cult of Willis Daniels' (Richard Lawson) late mother. A vengeful Willis brings the doomed vampire Prince Mamuwalde (William Marshall) back to life. Willis soon finds the vampire too powerful to control, and Lisa agrees to perform a spell that will break the curse placed on the prince. But, when racist sheriff Dunlop (Michael Conrad) gets involved, the vampire unleashes his deadly revenge.

I really enjoyed both Blacula and Scream, Blacula, Scream. There were many instances where I was left with my jaw on the ground because of what many will find racist and unacceptable in todays diverse society. Uses of the N word to describe African Americans and the F word to label homosexuals flew out of characters mouths like they were just part of casual conversation.

The use of voodoo chants and rituals in Scream, Blacula, Scream might keep some religious folks from taking the movie in. Blacula really is just a remake of Dracula with African Americans in a contemporary 1970s setting. I found both films to hold a certain passion and striving to be taken seriously in the world of horror. Amongst all the jive-talking is some really intense and scary sequences accomplished by some great camerawork and pacing.

Blacula and Scream, Blacula, Scream are both rated PG for violence, gore, adult situations, drinking, smoking, references to drug use, and some intense scenes of horror. Theres no nudity but quite a bit of language and stereotypical terms that would be considered unacceptable today. The violence and gore is of the vampire type and not very graphic.

The Blacula / Scream, Blacula, Scream Double Feature has some interesting bonus material. Audio commentary is provided by Author / Film Historian / Filmmaker David F. Walker (Reflections on Blaxploitation: Actors and Directors Speak). A new interview with Actor Richard Lawson (Scream, Blacula, Scream) is found. Theatrical trailers are included as well.

Ive never really dived head-on into the genre, but if there were a King of Blaxploitation Films it would have to be Blacula. Its right-hand man would have to be Scream, Blacula, Scream. Ive never witnessed anything so politically incorrect by todays standards, yet so awkwardly fun, in my entire life. Somehow, they're also fueled with social and racial commentary that speaks for the African American of the 1970s. Blaculas plight was put upon him by the evil white Dracula. By the second film, all he wants is to be free from his bloodlust. However, he always strives to be a champion of his race.",1427241600,5,3462,5.106007067137809

3907312,4,B002CWKU18,"I guess the studios look at blaxploitation as having served it's purpose of getting black people's minds out of a revolutionary spirit of the 1960's, but nothing more.  Many studios seem to treat these films like the Hong Kong martial arts films and treat them however they feel.  Some of us love them and want almost all of them.  They are a time machine into a by-gone era, as well as racist Hollywood's insult to blacks in the US.

Now for this Blu-Ray double feature Blu-ray review.  I'll just start out with the curious and the bad news - both movies are on ONE disc, not two separate discs.  However, since both films have grain and were not A1 quality to begin with, it seems to work fine, but I am used to BD sets being on separate discs to maximize what is.  Speaking of which, I counted 43GB used on the disc...

Of course the second film - ""Scream, Blacula, Scream!"" is the visually superior of the two, but both were close.  Details are strong.  Colors pop.  You can clearly make out the fabric/marital type on clothes, and you can clearly see the limits of the cheap makeup jobs, which kind of makes thing looks ridiculous.  Seeing the full limits of the makeup kind of makes viewing the films more personable; as if you were there.  What is metal, plastic or rubber clearly stands out as such as well.

The main menu is about as low down and as quickly put together as you can get.  None of the usual BD quality, just something extremely simple.  The pictures quality is great to the point that going back in time, it seems as if you can better picture having bee around during that time period.  The sound is that same old, low-fi, fairly muffled, treble deficient 70's low-budget film sound.  Of course it is in mono, as you should not expect much more.  None the less, it is good to have in the collection.  Now if they can just release the other Shaft films - especially Shaft's:Big Score!  I have waited too long for that!

I say - get this Blakula set before it goes out of print, which the signs seems to be pointing to it that it might be getting there sooner than later.  I felt the need to write a fairly detailed review about the Blu-Ray since I have not seen one and I know people want to know the quality.",1426723200,8,2232,4.338164251207729

Women vampires hair disarranged more scary than when Dracula gets a hold of them. Women offer more resistance and scream more.

3907322,5,B002CWKU18,"I saw this film in my hometown theater when it was first released in 1972. Recently I purchased the DVD to view with youngsters in my family as a Halloween treat. Their response? It was an instant hit! Both William Marshall and Vonetta McGee are great in their roles. William Marshall's rich baritone speaking voice and persona brings character to his role as Blacula the so-called ""Brother from another Mother.""  Having been an opera singer Marshall's deep voice and his experience as an accomplished Shakespearean actor, brings swagger to this film. It is sad that  Mr. Marshall is only known for his roles in ""Blacula"" and ""Scream Blacula Scream."" But it is more heartbreaking that he and so many African American actors/actresses at that time, were unable to get more work to showcase their multifaceted talent in better acting roles. However, These two(Horror movies and/or Blaxploitation films) are campy and fun. The lovely Vonetta McGee who was better known for her beauty than her acting does a great job. She is also known for her starring roles in not only Blacula, but also other 1970's films such as Hammer, Melinda, Shaft in Africa and 1974's ""Thomasine and Bushrod"" with her then boyfriend, Max Julien (directed by Gordon Parks). Amazon's double feature offer of SOUL CINEMA, features both ""Blacula"" and ""Scream Blacula Scream"" and is a great buy. I highly recommended both films that can be viewed by the whole family and friends of all ages.",1414108800,2,1458,4.946938775510204

William marshall is a good actor. he could have done a lot better vampire if they would have let him. he's got class and a great voice for the king of vampires. pam grier is her usual self looks hot. also with a better script she could have done so much better. worth having no matter if you like the old soul movies or horror.,1403136000,,509,4.0495049504950495
3907331,4,B002CWKU18,"I saw Blacula and the sequel 40 years ago when I was a little kid.  I viewed the movies as a straight horror, as any satirical references went over my head.  I saw them again only once after that.  Now with the advent of DVD's and You Tube, films are at your command and I was able to watch both Blacula movies with adult eyes.  I was shocked to discover there were things I missed as a child since you filter out information that isn't immediately gratifying.  As an older adult viewer, new aspects caught my attention.  Blacula was not some scary boogeyman indiscriminately biting people.  He was Mamuwalde, an imposing and intelligent character, whose motivations were the most selfless and genuine.  He was in the process of negotiating with Count Dracula in order to abolish the slave trade.  Mamuwalde cancels the meeting when the Count makes inappropriate advances on his wife and is later cursed.  The rest of the film he spends seeking his lost love.  I did not catch these on my prior viewings.  I love the scene where Mamuwalde takes down two pimps.  He says ""you made a slave of your sister and you're still slaves imitating your slave masters"".  An incredibly insightful statement from a cheesy horror flick.  The thing that stand's out despite the ""blaxploitation"" stamp is William H. Marshall's marvelous performance.  This skilled, stage trained actor turned this b-movie character into a very sincere, memorable, strong anti-hero.  According to interviews, the movie was supposed to be an all out stereotype with a vampire named ""Andrew Brown"".  William Marshall was opposed to this version and fought to make the vampire an African prince named Mamuwalde, who was fighting to end slavery.  Credit should be given to Marshall because this change along with his dominating performance is what I believe made the film a success.  As a character, Mamuwalde transcends the constraints of this movie due to the talents of the late, great William Marshall.",1402012800,4,1967,4.920972644376899
3907332,5,B002CWKU18,"For a movie about vampires this movie had a lot of great sayings and lessons in the story. I remember this movie so well as when I first saw it over 30 years ago. William Marshall's Blacula character approached two pimps. They were rude and tough. They did not realize that they were staring death in the eye. When Blacula realized who they were and what they were doing, he became quite upset and told them ""you are making slaves of yourself and our women"". They then became his victims. His character ooozed with pride. He was a former African Prince. When he became Blacula, he felt shame of the choices he had to make. In one scene he is called by his African name. He is about to strike another victim. At this point he cannot attack his victim. He then corrects his pursuer and tells him ""my name is Blacula"". It is then that he can continue his attacks. William Marshal was a great actor. He never received the recognition of Sidney Potier but he was well trained and up on his game. I recommend this movie set to any 70's or vampire fan.",1395878400,,1045,4.336734693877551
