8521004,4,B0001HK0PM,"One of my favorite movies because everything still holds up. The acting is great (though I still refer to Dennis as ""Shaggy""), the shots inside the house are amazing since they had to avoid capturing their own reflections in all the glass, and the make-up they use for the ghosts is so cool! Even if you're not much of a horror fan, you'd probably like it.",1504051200,,356,4.409090909090909
8521005,5,B0001HK0PM,"Jeeze, I want that house.  What fantastic art design.  A Fun Movie, if you can put your hand over your eyes and peek through your fingers at certain points.",1469750400,,156,4.344827586206897
