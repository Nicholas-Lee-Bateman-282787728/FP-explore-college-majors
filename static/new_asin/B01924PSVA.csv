7560922,4,B01924PSVA,Alabama Fan and wanted to purchase the Championship game.  It comes with a dvd and a blu ray copy of the game.  The picture quality to me looks about the quality of the broadcast.  The blu ray chapter select is broken down by quarters and includes the after game Trophy presentation.  Wish there where more extras included though.,1457222400,2,330,4.637931034482759
7560923,2,B01924PSVA,"Video quality for the blu ray disc is very good and the DTS audio is excellent but only 2 channels. The dvd video quality is horrible. Whoever was hired to encode the dvd video should be fired? The frame rate was encoded incorrectly and the game looks like it is a ""film"" version as opposed to live . For the money, there is not much programming on the blu ray version even though the video is in h. 264 or AVC format. They did manage to include the trophy ceremony but that is all the bonus material included. No espn pregame or postgame coverage. As in previous productions, there are no chapter marks for each quarter. If you press the fast forward button, you automatically skip to the next quarter. Since this is setup this way, this renders the blu ray pop up menu useless since it does the same thing. This fantastic game deserved a better product than this ""rush"" job produced.",1457049600,,885,4.435582822085889
7560924,3,B01924PSVA,"As an Alabama fan this should be a five star Blu-Ray/DVD combo football game, but it's not. On so many levels this is a disappointment! First, and I realize this may be petty to some... Why am I not receiving this in a Blu-Ray case? I hate combos in a DVD case. Second, They used the cheapest case imaginable, you know the type, the cheap replacement case that doesn't hold the disc very well. Which leads to my third point, both discs arrived loose within the case, the DVD has significant damage, the blu-ray has minor scratches. Fourth, even blu-rays with minor scratches can skip and freeze, yep! mine does, before the game even started... right as Dabo Swinney started his pregame interview. and Finally, and probably the most significant, the picture quality isn't that good, kinda blocky, like streaming a movie when the bit rate is on the low side. Not horrible, but not what I've seen with my other championship games.

Needless to say, I am returning this, and getting an exchange. Hopefully it arrives in better shape.

As an update... I have received my replacement set and they have arrived alive. Both discs are in their holder as expected and look great. I've played the Blu-Ray and it plays properly with not a skip or freeze.

I would recommend the set if you are a fan of either of the teams because it was a great game, and I doubt we will ever see a better version. It seems as if these sets are a one and done proposition and we get what the market dictates. Personally I have the last 5 Alabama National Championship games on disc and you can tell the market size by the presentation. Texas and Notre Dame look great and come in Blu-Ray cases. LSU is only on DVD, as is Miami but that one makes sense because it's old. Unfortunately Clemson and Alabama don't deserve a proper Blu-Ray case but at least we got a Blu-Ray.",1456963200,10,1841,4.48955223880597

7560927,3,B01924PSVA,"My review is about the Blu Ray disc (I didn't view the DVD disc).  The video quality is excellent -- very clear, like I was hovering above the football field watching the game as it was happening.  However, the audio quality is very disappointing.  For one thing, the audio is not in surround sound format.  While viewing the Blu Ray using my receiver's surround sound setting, everything came out of the center speaker, with nothing except very, very faint sounds coming from any other speakers.  After trying various settings on my receiver, I found that only the two-speaker stereo setting was acceptable, where the audio is coming from my main left and right speakers.

The other problem with the audio is that while the commentary from the announcers (Chris Fowler and Kirk Herbstreit) was clear and easily heard, the crowd noise sounded like it was recorded with a tin can.

I am very disappointed that in this day and age, a quality Blu Ray with top-notch video AND audio (with proper surround sound) wasn't released for such an important college football game.",1464480000,,1068,4.835164835164835
