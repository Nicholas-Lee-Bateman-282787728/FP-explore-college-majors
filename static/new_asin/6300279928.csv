Since I was only 11 years old and had not seen ""Carrie"" yet (I wouldn't catch that till a year later, in edited form on TV, of course), it scared the hell out of me.  In other words, I liked it quite a bit! :)
I think that this would be a good movie to get if you have a son/daughter between 11-13 that likes to be scared, but isn't ready for a real hardcore horror movie yet.  It'll scare them sufficiently! :)",988416000,4,484,3.8686868686868685

She is aided by her strange housemother(Shelley Winters) who also happens to be a witch. Fun and entertaining, in a juvenile sort-of-way, THE INITIATION OF SARAH is a sometimes effective variation on the standard CARRIE/teen misfit theme, made doubly enjoyable by Shelley Winters' hammy performance.

Alas, the snobby girls there, led by the uber-bitchy Jennifer Lawrence (Morgan Fairchild), only want Patty to join their ranks.

7808683,3,6300279928,"The Initiation of Sarah (Robert Day, 1978)

NOTE: This review contains some spoilers for the film. Proceed with caution.

Ah, the seventiesthe golden age of what has come to be known as the Satanic Panic film, though the repercussions of same would not be felt until the eighties and early nineties, when Satanic Panic leached into American culture, with shysters coming up with all sorts of things to keep a newly-freed-from-Red-Dread country checking under their beds for boogeymen at night. Instead of commies, we were told, we needed to watch out for devil worshippers kidnapping and molesting our children (or even doing it right at the day care [...]). All of it absolute bunk, of course, cooked up by the morally bankrupt in order to make themselves a few bucks. And as a result, I feel like I should take every Satanic Panic movie made in the seventies to task for foisting these monstrosities on us. But instead I watch a movie like The Initiation of Sarah and I just wonder to myself, people eventually thought this sort of thing really happened? (An amusing side note: I did not know until just now that the movie had been remade in 2006, starring Mika Boorem and Summer Glau. Satanic Panic has indeed returned, at least on celluloid.)

Sarah Goodwin (House's Kay Lenz) is a newly-minted college freshman at a campus where greek life is everything. (For those of you who went to bigger schools and don't believe such things exist: when I was a college freshman in 1986, 95% of the males at my school were in a fraternity. The women weren't yet because (a) my class was the second to be coed and (b) sororities were not chartered on our campus until 1989.) She goes through rush, but as something of a wallflower, she is for the most part heckled or snubbed... until she finds her niche in the polar opposite of the Mean Girls-esque sorority that pledges her glamorous sister Patty (Gypsy's Morgan Brittany). Now, we already know something is up with Sarah, since she used telekinetic powers (without understanding what she was doing) to prevent her sister from being raped in the very recent past...but let's forget all that, shall we? Oh, well, until the sinister house mother (Shelley Winters) and some of her creepier housemates discover Sarah's talents and decide to put them to good use humiliating those stuck-up chicks.

The good partwhile this is (obviously) somewhat derivative of certain earlier movies (*cough*Carrie*cough*) whose names we won't mention, there's that other supernatural aspect to it that sets it apart somewhat.  That's the good part. The bad, well...how is it that a made-for-TV movie feels cut? That makes sense in the days of the DVD, where the made for TV movie has an unrated director's cut waiting in the wings to be released a week later, with all the f-bombs not dubbed and the extra half-mil in special effects not cut out to make room for deodorant commercials. But in 1978? The final sequence, especially, feels as if it had been cut to shreds, with some implications that are never fully spelled out, and a few characters who would have done exceptionally well given another two minutes of epilogue. Still, there's enough of the final sequence, or what was the final sequence (I hope), to give you an idea that you think you know what happened. And hey, maybe there's a director's cut waiting in the wings. Hey, they made a remake, right? ** ",1398124800,,3393,4.7815699658703075
7808684,5,6300279928,"I saw this for the first time in years yesterday and remember how much I liked it.  A horror story (let's use that term loosely for this one) will always be more effective if our main character draws us in with an element of empathy, and Kay Lenz as Sarah Goodwin does this beautifully.  You felt the same way for Sissy Spacek in the original version of the Carrie film.  You don't get this feeling with the remakes of either film, and I really have to question why most remakes of almost any film are necessary at all.

Lenz sparkles as the mousy, bookish, Sarah in comparison with her beautiful, outgoing sister Patty (the beautiful Morgan Brittany).  In her look, demeanor, and clothes, Lenz makes you believe she is truly her character.  Conversely, so does Morgan Fairchild as the nasty maternity vixen Jennifer.

Sarah has never felt confident or truly loved by anybody but Patty, but it's their stepping into the collegiate world that tests their bonds.  ANS definitely want Patty because she looks like a model, but they don't want Sarah and set out to tear the two sisters apart.  Sarah is accepted at PED (nicknamed Pigs, Elephants, and Dogs by the ""mature"" bimbos at ANS), and it is there she finds comraderie with other bookish, unpopular girls like herself.  There is just one problem:  Sarah has telekenetic powers that unleash themselves whenever she becomes angry, and the house mother played a tad overindulgently by Shelly Winters harnesses on it for evil.  She doesn't seem any better than the ANS girls as she even tries to get her to destroy Patty who truly loves Sarah, and that really doesn't sit well with me.  I also suspect that, because of the way Winters' character seems overly familiar with Sarah on first sight, that she may be her birth mother, but we never find out.

Nothing gorey here, but the premise is good and keeps you on the edge of your seat as revenge is exacted on the ANS snobs--especially evil Jennifer (I guess I just hate her more than the average viewer because I knew someone who looked and acted like her when I was younger--and we did NOT get along either!).  I would like to have seen an alternate ending, having hoped the best would happen once Sarah realized she was being darkly manipulated, but won't give it away.  What I can say is this is one of the better made-for-TV movies of this genre, especially one of several that were inspired by Stephen King's Carrie, and you would be missing out if you didn't catch it.",1327449600,2,2474,4.614155251141552
7808685,3,6300279928,"Well, I stumbled upon this old 70s movie on a movie rental site I subscribe to, and since I have a weakness for cheesy 70s supernatural flicks, I decided to watch it. It reminded me a lot of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Carrie/dp/0792839676/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Carrie</a>, though Carrie was a far superior production. This is set in a college and revolves around two sisters (actually adoptive sisters) - Patty (Morgan Brittany) is the pretty and popular sister and Sarah (Kay Lenz) is the quiet and unassuming wallflower. Sarah also happens to possess telekinetic powers which she finds difficult to control. Both sisters are very close to each other but their bond is put to the test when they pledge for a sorority. The popular sorority is led by the snooty Jennifer Lawrence (Morgan Fairchild in her pre-Flamingo Road role, but playing to type), and when Jennifer decides that only Patty is worthy of being their 'sister', Sarah is devastated. She ends up pledging for a rival sorority that is led by a sinister housemother Erica Hunter(played by Shelley Winters) who has a grudge against the other sorority. The rest of the story sees Sarah's life being made miserable by Jennifer, and how Erica tries to manipulate Sarah to do her bidding and enable her to finally get back at the rival sorority.

It's an ok movie along the lines of a Lifetime movie, and definitely has a dated feel to it on account of being made in the 70s. There are also some cheesy moments, but Kay Lenz's performance as the distraught and tormented young woman who just wants to feel accepted and not made fun of is a stand-out performance and makes this movie worth watching (that, and the fact that I just love watching Morgan Fairchild play her vampy, little miss nasty role to perfection!).",1286841600,3,1826,5.046357615894039
7808686,5,6300279928,"Its a shame that while the less-than-stellar so called ""remake"" is readily available on DVD, the original made-for-TV classic sits locked away in a vault somewhere. This one's got a much more engrossing storyline and a GREAT cast featuring Morgan Brittany, Morgan Fairchild, Kay Lenz, Robert Hays and of course the inimitable Shelley Winters. Many people fondly remember this from its original 1978 airing. I bet very few will remember the stupid remake 30+ years from now.",1279497600,3,473,5.1558441558441555
7808687,5,6300279928,"Yes, The Initiation of Sarah was inspired by Carrie -- but it also surpasses Carrie. For unlike Carrie, The Initiation of Sarah was a TV-movie, hence subject to budgetary and censorial restraints. But it overcame these restraints, even turning them to its advantage by emphasizing story and acting and atmosphere over shocks and gore. It's my personal favorite horror TV-movie, better than the oft-cited and rightly praised The Night Stalker.

The Initiation of Sarah tells a common tale: A young high school/summer camp/college nerd is long picked on, then finally retaliates. In the horror genre, the nerd often employs supernatural powers, or is severely injured in a ""prank gone bad"" so that he becomes an 'berpsycho.

The Initiation of Sarah, like Carrie and The Craft, follows the former pattern. Like Carrie, Sarah (Kay Lenz) has telekinetic powers, which manifest when she's angered. But as she is unable to control its destructive potential, and being a good-hearted nerdy girl, Sarah suppresses her powers.

The film begins with Sarah and her half-sister, Patty (Morgan Brittany), going off to college. Both pledge the campus's elite sorority, ANS (Alpha Nu Sigma), but ANS only accepts the beautiful Patty, not the mousy Sarah. Instead, Sarah joins the brainy PED (Phi Epsilon Delta -- which the svelte ANS girls refer to as Pigs, Elephants, and Dogs).

ANS is led by the beautiful and [...] Jennifer (Morgan Fairchild), who pressures Patty into tormenting Sarah. Meanwhile, the timid Sarah finds new friends at PED, including Allison (Talia Balsom, Martin ""Psycho"" Balsom's daughter, and star of The Kindred and The Supernaturals) and Mouse (Tisa Farrow, Mia's sister, and star of Zombie and Grim Reaper). Several other cast members (some very minor) are the daughters, nieces, and sisters of famous thesps -- a gimmick employed by the film.

Sarah also comes under the wings of PED's loopy house mother, Mrs. Hunter (Shelley Winters), who teaches ""anthropology and belief systems in primitive cultures."" Naturally, she's also a practicing witch. The evil Satanic kind.

The film follows the usual trajectory. Sarah is rejected and tormented, encouraged to develop and use her powers for revenge, everything finally culminating in a fiery cataclysm. Yet within the framework of its familiar story conventions, the film offers much.

Its strongest asset is Kay Lenz, whose physical appearance, body language, mannerisms, and expressions consistently capture the nuanced timidity of a girl nerd. Consider Sarah maneuvering silently amid the ANS party-goers. In her dowdy cardigan sweater, the 5'1"" Lenz holds herself together, trying to avoid touching anyone as she squeezes past the exuberant taller girls chattering over her. The insecure Sarah strains to be inconspicuous, painfully self-conscious despite the beautiful ANS girls' obliviousness to her. It's a short scene, but The Initiation of Sarah is full of such moments when Lenz shines as Sarah.

The one flaw in Lenz's portrayal is when the ANS girls fling mud and vegetables at Sarah, who stands screaming rather than retreat into the house. But most likely, this was Robert Day's direction. A small mistake, in an overall fine job as director. (No, I don't buy that Sarah was ""too shocked"" to move -- just as I rarely buy that horror's legions of screaming women are too shocked to move whenever a monster lumbers toward them.)

The rest of the cast is competent-to-stellar. Tisa Farrow is best known to horror fans as the star of Zombie, yet her portrayal of Mouse is her best horror (or even non-horror) performance. In The Initiation of Sarah, Farrow is less spacey and distant than usual -- infusing Mouse with pain, insecurity, trepidation, despondency, and an occasionally distraught edge (Mouse had attempted suicide).

Morgan Fairchild's Jennifer is a proper [...], more nuanced that most movie/TV [...], shifting from girlish camaraderie, to coy flirtation, subtle slights, and raw cruelty. Shelley Winters gives a stammering, hyperactive, hammy performance, which is inappropriate against Lenz's realism, but is still mildly fun to watch. Perhaps the celebrated Winters did not think this horror TV-movie was worth a serious effort, but Lenz and Farrow demonstrate that it was.

To fully appreciate The Initiation of Sarah, one should compare it to The Craft (1996), an overrated and inferior film about four nerdy high school girls who employ witchcraft to take vengeance on their [...] oppressors.

The Craft is a heavy-handed mess, overstated in every way that The Initiation of Sarah is subtle. Both films have stereotypical WASPy blond [...]. Yet Morgan Fairchild's Jennifer knows when to withdraw and feign decency. (ANS girls call it ""tact""). Conversely, The Craft's Laura Lizzie (Christine Taylor) is openly racist, brazenly calling a black nerd (Rachel True) ""the N word"" in public.

Sorry. Whatever she may say in private, I just don't buy that a sophisticated teenager would publicly shout ""the N word"" in an elite California school in 1996. Maybe in 1956, but not 1996. Even Jennifer, whose film is set in 1978, knows better.

And although Jennifer (like Laura) is vicious, when publicly called on it, Jennifer immediately retreats and says it was ""just a stupid joke."" The Craft eschews such realism. It ""tries too hard"" to establish Laura's villainy (and subsequent reformation). The Craft's heavy-handedness, its stark blacks and whites, ring false. Not a problem in The Initiation of Sarah.

Now compare the nerds. The nerds of PED look like nerds. Dowdy, plain, or overweight. Even the pretty Lenz and Farrow manage, through costuming and body language, to portray proper nerds. Conversely, in The Craft, two of the four nerds (Robin Tunney and Rachel True) are way too attractive to be treated as nerds.

(Of the other two nerds, Fairuza Balk can be pretty, but is effectively distorted by her Goth makeup; and Neve Campbell's nerd passes because of her physical -- and resultant emotional -- injuries).

Despite its big studio theatrical budget, and 1990s special effects, The Craft fails in every way that The Initiation of Sarah succeeds.

(The Initiation of Sarah also compares favorably to The Spell, yet another TV movie about a tormented nerd girl with telekinetic powers, who is yet again tutored by an elder woman (played by an overbearing Lelia Goldoni, the mousy wife from The Unseen)).

The Initiation of Sarah also surpasses the average TV-movie in every area. TV lighting (especially in older TV-movies) tends to be flatter than in cinema, as TV screens display a smaller color palette than does film stock. Despite this, The Initiation of Sarah is especially atmospheric (credit to cinematographer Ric Waite), especially in its murkily-lit photography of the PED sorority house.

The film has some plot holes, or at least raises issues that remain unaddressed (e.g., the fate of Sarah's birth mother; and where is Mr. Hunter?). The classrooms are underpopulated (trying to save money by hiring few extras?). Gore is limited, this being a TV-movie.

Even so, The Initiation of Sarah is an underrated horror gem. An engrossing (if familiar) story, performed by a talented cast. Kay Lenz's portrayal of the nerdy Sarah would alone be enough to make The Initiation of Sarah worth seeing.",1161648000,6,7298,5.20460358056266
7808688,2,6300279928,"This film is about a girl named Sarah who her and her sister go off to college and end up in separate groups of fraternity's. She is the adopted child of a mother who hasn't loved her very well, but her half sister does tho. Her mother used to be in the sorority of the snobs, and wanted her daughter to carry the legacy as well. Sarah is considered the outcast, not pretty enough, not the right personality, so she is ignored and teased by the frat her sister gets into which is the one her mother was in. Sarah joins a quieter group of sorority girls who accept her for her and hate the other frat. Their dorm mother is a weirdo who knows voodoo or witch-craft or something so you can guess what most of the plot is going to be like from there on.

Sarah also has special powers, sort of like Carrie White, and the story I think is trying to rip off Carrie, but instead of being a full out-cast, it's changed to ""what if Carrie had friends and more confidence?"" really. Sarah goes from being a shy girl to a girl leading the frat to stand up for themselves against the others who hassle them.

A fair few scenes in this are ripped right off of Carrie, so it's not just the mystical powers thing. There is a specific scene where they lure Sarah outside and throw mud at her, I could almost hear the chant, ""plug it up"".

The movies finale didn't have the edge or charisma it needed. It pretty much unfolds just the way you expect it to. It's not a horror movie IMO, or a thriller, not even suspenseful. Maybe it might scare the weak minded, but it's not scary in anyway.

Perhaps if the ending of it was done a little better and not just relying on candles and wind machines for an attempt at suspense, then it might have worked.

It's a no wonder this was made for TV rather then theatrical release, it just would not have been attended in theatres.

Stephen King recommended this movie in his TV thing, ""This is horror""... he must have been paid to say it, because this movie is not horror, it's more, horror-ble and is just a weaker more watered down version of his own writings.",1118448000,2,2083,4.247474747474747

7808690,4,6300279928,"I, like most of the reviewers here, first saw this movie on television in 1978.  It is great fun with stellar performances by the entire cast.  Shelley Winters turns in a wickedly ""funny-hammy"" performance which borders on the ridiculous at times.  Kay Lenz as the scapegoat girl with telekinetic powers (ala Carrie)is superb.  Morgan Fairchild as the lead villainess and tauntress of Lenz is equally fine.

The payoff at the end, for me, is disappointing.  Instead of following the ""formulaic"" horror theme where the heroine dies to sacrifice herself, I wish the writers had taken another route, namely, to have Sarah visit Jennifer who has been horribly disfigured into an ugly old crone and make her realize that cruelty and laughter at the expense of someone else doesn't pay.  I would have loved to have seen the after-effect...that would have been great.  That is why I give this movie four stars instead of five.",1099612800,6,919,4.922077922077922
