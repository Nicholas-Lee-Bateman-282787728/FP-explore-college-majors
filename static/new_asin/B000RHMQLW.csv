8200742,5,B000RHMQLW,"Ancien Regime, Livre IV of the immensely clever Le Chevalier d'Eon, expands its scope in this volume to not-so-merry Olde England, where this time we have a go at the British monarchy.  The ongoing cast of four French knights, d'Eon, Teillagory, Durand, and Robin must somehow again contrive to arrange a meeting with the female head-of-state, this time Queen Mary Charlotte, consort of King George III of later American Revolution infamy.  Again however, it is not the royalty that poses the threat, but lesser members of the court and nobility, particularly the Earl of Sandwich and Dashwood, leader of the Hellfire Club and the real ""puppetmaster"" of the series the Japanese are so fond of.  It develops Dashwood is the one behind most of the machinations thus far, with both St. Germain and Robespierre his willing agents.

With this revelation, we move into the second half of the series and no doubt much closer to some kind of showdown between the four Knights and the manipulating Poets over possession of the mysterous and powerful Royal Pslams.  Things also begin to get if anything far more dangerous for our four principal characters, threatening to sunder their so far tight bonds with each other.  In particular, Robesepierre has targeted both d'Eon/Lia and Durand, but for very different goals.  I am thoroughly enjoying this little visit to one of my favorite periods of European history, and especially the little ( or not-so-little ) twists and turns given to the historical characters who chiefly populate it.  My only criticism of it is in the vastness of its plot and numerous characters, which may be a burden to viewers who get impatient with costume dramas, which this undeniably is; and who crave ceaseless action and buckets of blood.

From the beginning, Le Chevalier d'Eon has reminded me in structure, pacing, and intricate plotting of one of my all-time favorite Gothic anime, Witch Hunter Robin, though on a greatly expanded scale.  Its evocative atmosphere, backdoor manipulations, secret semi-religious rituals, and overall air of mystery combined with occasional bloodletting and fantastic duels occur here as well, with a rather more colorful artistic palette.  If you appreciate an intelligent and intricately-plotted tale of romance, history, mystery, and at times subdued Gothic-style terror this neglected but beautifully crafted series should delight.",1288224000,,2391,5.232984293193717
