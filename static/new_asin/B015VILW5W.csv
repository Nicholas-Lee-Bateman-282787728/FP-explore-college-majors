8734727,5,B015VILW5W,"I don't know how I missed this tribute when it was released in 2012. I watched a Booth Brothers video on YouTube from this concert and immediately had to find it. It is available at daywind.com for $14.99 plus a couple of bucks shipping. It's got several guests doing Lari's arrangements - the aforementioned Booth Brothers (their performance of Then I Met the Master is my favorite), Ernie Haase and Signature Sound, Babbie Mason, The Hoppers, The Mark Trammel Quartet, Greater Vision, Legacy Five, Taranda Greene, The Martins, The Nelons, a couple of bonus tracks, one with Reggie and Ladye Love Smith, and they all do a great job. The concert is hosted by Gerald Wolfe. There is also a feature called Extras that has several of the performers giving tribute and recalling memories of Lari Goss and his influence over the years. The best one is the Booth Brothers - they start out with the usual, but then take a left turn that is hilarious.",1456531200,,943,4.686746987951807
