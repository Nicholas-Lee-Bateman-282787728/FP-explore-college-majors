8422074,2,B004BNDD5G,"If you have trained personally with Master Ren, this is a great reference tool.
However, it is a demonstration video with no instruction.

You can follow along and imitate him, but that is not instruction.
Great form, beautifully and powerfully done, no value for students trying to learn from the video.",1426982400,6,304,4.96078431372549
8422075,5,B004BNDD5G,"The next best thing to a real instructor.  He goes slowly step by step (breaking down when to step, shift and turn).  I tried to learn the form on youtube videos and it just wasn't working.  Only criticism, I would have liked to see more silk-reeling exercises instead of the same ones (and the same form instruction) performed several times.",1399593600,,342,4.666666666666667
8422076,5,B004BNDD5G,I'm very happy with this video because gives you clear instructions on how to start a good tai chi practice by yourself!,1359936000,2,120,4.5
8422077,5,B004BNDD5G,"This is an outstanding video by a true Master of Taijiquan. It provides an excellent, step-by-step introduction to Chen Taijiquan, including standing post meditation, silk reeling exercises, and 19 Form.  It is best used as a supplement to lessons with a live instructor, but can serve as a very useful introduction to determine whether you may want to commit to a Tai Chi class.  I use this video every day for my home practice.  Five stars!!",1330646400,2,443,4.802631578947368
