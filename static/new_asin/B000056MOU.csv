7932240,4,B000056MOU,"This is a must own for the short ""Franz Kafka's It's A Wonderful Life"".  If that title made you laugh, than this is for you.  Starring Richard E. Grant and written and directed by the current (12th) Doctor Who, Peter Capaldi, it was a much deserved Oscar Winner back in 1995.  The other things on this disc are worth watching once, but you will find your self returning to this short over and over.  A twisted Christmas classic that deserves to be better known.
