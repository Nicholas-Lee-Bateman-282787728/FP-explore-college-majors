On the bright side, unlike other Troma fair, the camp was left out, and the script at least ""tried"" but the actors were too weak to carry it.

8082369,4,B000B6DHOY,"Bettdr than average for Troma Films with a good script, but low budget featuring some familiar faces in later films.  Interesting convolutions in the story-line that held my interest until the very end.  Plot was tight and with more money this might have rivaled ""Scarface"" upon which I think it was carboned.  Good acting and props were detailed and gore and shooting scenes well orchestrated.  Overall the camera work left imagination do the work and though gory the stunt work was well planned.",1444435200,,497,4.951807228915663
