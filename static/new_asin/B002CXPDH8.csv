3907388,4,B002CXPDH8,"Vol. 1 in Spanish, The intro song at the beginning wasn't in Spanish, which its really cool and I was expecting to sing it when id watch the show.

3907391,5,B002CXPDH8,"Action, drama, emotions, Supercampeones has it all. This cartoons are not for people with heart trouble. The show will keep you in the edge of your seat and wanting for more. This is the story of Oliver Atom, a natural gifted kid destined to be a soccer champion, however, the road to success is far from easy for him. He has to face formidable opponents like Benji, Steve and Richard. This is an inspiring and motivating story that I recommend for the whole family. The show is Japanese cartoons in Spanish, it seems like it is not well known in the United States, I wish it also comes in English.",1272499200,4,598,4.445454545454545
