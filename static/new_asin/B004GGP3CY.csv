8428707,5,B004GGP3CY,"My favorite is the Civil War episode here is STILL VALLEY. STILL VALLEY was written by Rod Serling and directed by Jim Sheldon. A Confederate scout played by the crag faced Gary Merrill reconnoiters a town held by Union troops who are all frozen in their tracks as if time had stopped. Sinister forces are at work here with a spell from a book of black magic from an old man who suggests that Merrill use this force to destroy the entire Union army. That is the moral dilemma set before Merrill. The images of the frozen Union soldiers are a bit unsettling and are rather haunting. Thought provoking stuff from The Twilight Zone. DEAD MAN'S SHOES is interesting and memorable episode. Warren Stevens is a derelict who finds the shoes of a dead gangster. He puts on the shoes and he finds himself following literally in the footsteps of the dead man's life. This is classic Twilight Zone written by Charles Beaumont and directed by Montgomery Pittman. Warren Stevens gives one of his best performances. A PIANO IN THE HOUSE which first aired on February 16, 1962 shows the cruelty that lies beneath the surface of some people. Barry Morse is at his best as he uses a player piano to make his guests reveal their innermost feelings and desires in a most vicious fashion. The late Joan Hackett is very good as she underplays her role as his abused wife. Earl Hamner, Jr. wrote a brilliant and memorable script for this episode as he chose a different tune to reveal each character as it was played on the piano. A PIANO IN THE HOUSE was directed by David Greene. THE JEOPARDY ROOM written by Rod Serling and directed by Dick Donner seems more akin to ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" but is a good play on words and strategies between Martin Landau and John VanDreelen with it `cold war' views and interpolations. It is still a story of the individual who must emerge from a society that would suppress personal freedoms.",1380585600,,1913,4.612903225806452
