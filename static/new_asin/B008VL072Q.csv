5185305,5,B008VL072Q,"I bought this for my grandchildren to watch during the Thanksgiving Holiday, and they LOVED it.  They watched it over and over and ended up asking all sorts of questions that started great family discussions.  Highly recommended!",1358553600,5,229,5.162162162162162
5185306,4,B008VL072Q,Loved the story but my daughter would say it wasn't like the book. Of the the book is always better but  I think for a little movie it is worth seeing and educational.,1355961600,,167,4.0606060606060606
5185307,3,B008VL072Q,Good teaching tone...but monotone voice is a little boring.  Very slow moving.  If you could play in FF would make it much better.,1355097600,,130,4.608695652173913
5185308,1,B008VL072Q,"Wanted to share this story with students. Decided to preview it and very glad I did.  The disc did not match the title ordered.  The case matched, but the disc is something concerning the Civil War!",1354665600,,198,4.472222222222222
5185309,4,B008VL072Q,"The chilcren loved this very tastefully and beautifully done movie, but it was SHORT. Would have enjoyed it more (especially for the price) if it was a little longer.",1354665600,3,166,4.758620689655173
5185310,5,B008VL072Q,My class loved it,1417219200,,17,3.5
5185311,4,B008VL072Q,This story engaged my students and was a nice addition to our Thanksgiving unit.,1417219200,,80,4.785714285714286

5185314,2,B008VL072Q,Read the book first!!! This movie leaves out many many details that make Squanto's story so unique. After reading the book our kids and I were able to identify the parts of his story (YEARS) the movie had left out.,1412294400,2,214,4.375
5185315,5,B008VL072Q,This is a well told story like the storytellers of old...I love that its calm and not full of action. This is exactly the type of experience we will share with our granddaughter...a nice diet of good old fashion history told in a format that is traditional. Loved it.,1393459200,,267,4.469387755102041
5185316,3,B008VL072Q,"I am a teacher and I ordered this for my students to watch on a half day schedule.  It did not hold their attention.  I had to shut it off.
Wasted my money on this one!",1386460800,2,168,3.638888888888889
5185317,4,B008VL072Q,Good story--little monotone but message was easy for children to understand.  I was happy that the story wasn't just about pilgrims coming to America for religious freedom and breaking bread with the Native Americans to celebrate the harvest.,1385769600,,242,5.368421052631579
5185318,5,B008VL072Q,"It honestly, yet carefully, portrays both the kind and evil displays of raw, human emotion. I viewed this with our six year old son and we were both unexpectedly drawn in right away.

Please don't expect a flashy Pixar production here, but that's a good thing! Technically, it is not a moving animation, but rather a collection of beautifully drawn still images with the voice of a soothing narrator as if Grandpa were sitting with you reading it.

This is one for the whole family; a humbling reminder of why we celebrate this cherished holiday. Highly recommended.",1385164800,9,566,4.824742268041237
5185319,5,B008VL072Q,"So good to hear the full story. Growing up in the Midwest, we heard lots of stories of what really happened to the Indians.  I was often embarrassed to be ""white.""  It's nice to hear a story showing the forgiveness of a great man toward the people who so drastically altered his life.  We could all learn a great deal from his response.",1384646400,6,336,4.301587301587301
8531019,5,B008VL072Q,My students love this book.,1512259200,,27,4.6
8531020,5,B008VL072Q,"We loved it. The story of Squanto's life, hardships, and how good trials became a gift to others with the lovely artwork was a perfect way of introducing him to my 8 year old. My 5 year old was not as engrossed, but he still understood the main points of the story.",1510617600,,265,4.115384615384615
8531021,4,B008VL072Q,Very informative. But not animated. Like someone reading a book to you.,1481241600,,71,5.0
8531022,4,B008VL072Q,"Was just not long enough, hence the four stars. Amazing story that has been not told enough.",1481241600,,92,4.470588235294118
8531023,5,B008VL072Q,Used this with my third grade class just before Thanksgiving. We had been studying Squanto in other examples of media and literature. It was a good addition to our collective sources of information. I appreciated the serious tone and neutral color tones of the video. Not everything in history was unicorns and roses. Life was rugged and difficult for most of our ancestors.,1479772800,,374,4.9523809523809526
8531024,1,B008VL072Q,"Understand what you are buying before you buy: This is a 23-minute video in which 22 minutes are about Squanto's life (largely dark and depressing) and perhaps one minute of which deals with Thanksgiving. Since I bought it to show at a Thanksgiving-related event, it was useless.

The artwork is lovely, but narrator Graham Greene whispers while the background music is much too loud.

Far too arty and compex for children; far too short and simplistic for adults. I have no idea what audience this was created for.",1446422400,5,515,4.840909090909091
8531025,5,B008VL072Q,Very well done.  A touching harvest feast account with colorful artwork and soothing background music.,1445817600,,102,5.8
8531026,5,B008VL072Q,"This brief video is a touching tribute to the real story behind the first Thanksgiving, bringing to life Squanto, whom most of us learned little about in grade school.",1436745600,,167,4.793103448275862
8531027,3,B008VL072Q,A bit boring for kids.,1417305600,,22,3.6
8531028,2,B008VL072Q,Good story but you could barely hear the narration over the music .  I would just buy the book and not bother with the video.,1417219200,,125,4.0
