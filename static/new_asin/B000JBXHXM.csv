2668446,3,B000JBXHXM,"Great history.  I was hoping the series would focus more on the cars themselves, rather than on the historical background and the manufacturers of the cars.  Rarely do they even play recordings of the cars' exhaust notes.

I would say that this set is worth the purchase.  But just know that this is no Top Gear or Fifth Gear.  This is a historical documentary.",1255478400,,361,4.578125
2668447,3,B000JBXHXM,"...and three stars is pushing it. I gave it three because it exists, and not much else does that tried to cover a comprehensive history of cars. However, it falls short. Firstly, the episodes are a half hour, if that. Modern variations of some cars, like AMG Mercedes, are shown in brief snips, but not covered. Finally, if you are a big enough car nut to rent a disc like this, you want the intricate details of each product line (for instance, specific engine types or limited run racing versions of a Corvette), and they really just skim. I commend them for trying, but don't go into this rental thinking you are going to learn much.",1254700800,,636,4.491379310344827
2668448,4,B000JBXHXM,The only problem is that the Videos are too short!  An auto enthusiast will want to see them all.  They are an excellent summary of he Cars and Auto companies they are about.  They are very enjoyable.,1191628800,,200,4.351351351351352
2668449,5,B000JBXHXM,"If you are a true car buff you will welcome the availability of this set on DVD. It IS a real history lesson about the origins, development and triumphs of each of these marques. The history is very well presented (not boring), with great archival footage and each disc has additional rarely-seen bonus material (such as factory promo films introducing the 1953 Corvette to GM dealers). Whether you are a rabid ""car nut"" or completely unfamilar with any of the cars in this series, you will learn something new in these DVDs. It was also great to see man of the very rare antique models held in private collections being driven for the camera, and not just sitting in a museum. After all, isn't that what great cars are all about? ...To be driven! The videography, production and naration are top-notch. Well worth the price and a set that will get repeated viewing by car fans.
I only hope they also make the other programs in this series available soon on DVD.",1189382400,4,962,4.598837209302325

8149745,5,B000JBXHXM,"Ok value, but you get what you paid for, Has some cars,footage there haven't seen on other dvds. Overall if your a fan it's worth it. I got mine for $5 at a Kmart. However,There are somethings that Are not Included in other Corvette Vhs and Dvd I have,and that Is Footage of The Mako Shark II(not the Mako Shark I/XP700)which later became the Manta Ray,while I like the Manta Ray I prefer the ""Rolling""version Mako Shark II 396 with cool side exhausts look,the footage is of the Driveable Mako Shark II(427)It is titled ""Gm's Operational Shark""1965,it is under 4mins approx.it's in the bonus material of this dvd,along with something I never seen or can recall in my other Corvette Videos,Bonus Footage of the 4-Rotor Corvette,So while it is Short,it is a great bargain with a Lot of Bonus Material,as well as Bill Mitchell's Beautiful Red and Later Lucite Silver 1959 Sting Ray Racer/Concept which is seen briefly racing and you hear it too but sadly very briefly,very beautiful.",1378598400,,980,4.804733727810651
8149746,5,B000JBXHXM,"We tried to catch every episode of this series when it ran,  and really wanted to order the Mustang video, but it was too pricey when adding shipping .....  Couldn't be happier that now we have all for less than the single would have been when they were broadcast.",1371168000,,264,4.36734693877551
8149747,4,B000JBXHXM,It is a very good documentary. Excellent stories and History about the cars. Worth the time and the purchase. Worth owning the DVDs,1357171200,,131,4.739130434782608
8149748,5,B000JBXHXM,"The DVD set of a great collection of magnificent cars. Six disks cover seven different marques (one disk splits time between Farrari and Alfa Romeo). Each goes into the history and the mystique behind the cars. I ordered the complete set at an amazingly low price and it came in just a couple of days, brand new and unopened.",1350086400,,325,4.52542372881356
8149749,4,B000JBXHXM,My husband is an avid car buff and the DVD contained great stories and archival footage of all the classic sports cars.,1331769600,,119,4.454545454545454
8149750,2,B000JBXHXM,"This video began fairly well, explaining the origins of Daimler-Benz as an automotive company in a well presented fashion. The story of the company's founders and namesakes were well presented.

Then, the video began to chronicle the development of M-B racing and high performance cars exclusively. There was little about passenger cars after the early years and I felt the video should have spent far more time on M-B's main area of auto design and manufacture. As significant as the ""arrows"" and ""gull wings"" were, other M-B autos were just as important to automotive history.

I was disappointed by this DVD for the above reason. If one is interested in M-B sports cars exclusively, the History Channel ""Automobiles"" series episode (available in DVD format here on Amazon) on Mercedes-Benz was certainly better in my opinion and I would recommend that DVD instead of this one.",1261958400,,879,5.055172413793104
