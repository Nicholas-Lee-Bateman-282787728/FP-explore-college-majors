8449148,1,B004Z0R89M,"Why any man would marry these ""catches"" is beyond me. Especially Karen, who gets into a verbal altercation with her seamstress, then inflates the story into an absolute lie. The poor seamstress was petrified. There's no excuse for behavior like that.

And the others on this DVD aren't much better.

If your son is about to get married, show him an episode of this. My guess is he won't get married.

One of the problems with this show is people go on it, like they do Jerry Springer, just to be on TV. They will act ridiculous just because the camera is on them. Some of the situations are so set up it's pathetically obvious. The producers are doing everything they can to push these losers to act like idiots. And most fall for it.",1312070400,,734,4.4222222222222225
