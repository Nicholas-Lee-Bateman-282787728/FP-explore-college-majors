7832945,4,6302986877,"For any of us from Kansas City, the World Series was a long time coming. This video brings back some of the stars and heartbreak of that series, yet it is good to see George Brett, Amos Otis, Hal McRae, Willie Aikens, and others battle the resilient Phillies.  Unfortunately, there were some tracking problems with my copy--hence the 4 stars.",1147910400,,342,4.7

Things to watch for in the World Series film:

The reaction of the teenage fan just after Jose Santiago homers in Game One.
The great sunglasses and Barbara Feldon hairdos sported by many of the female fans.
Reggie Smith (a rookie) is allowed not to wear a batting helmet, which even then I thought rookies were required to wear.
The great umpire POV shots at Busch Stadium.
The VERY strange reaction of the Cardinals, heading into the dugout after winning the World Series, looking over their shoulders onto the field as though a cannon shot had just been fired or they had seen  someone brutalized by the stadium police. In fact, I read that some ugly incident DID occur, but for the life of me I can't find that reference....do you know what happened?
How much Dick Williams juggled his starting lineup. He platooned the whole series at 2B (Adair/Andrews), RF (Tartabull/Harrelson), 3B (D.Jones/Foy) and C (R. Gibson/E. Howard).
The monstrous homer Brock hit in Fenway's CF bleachers in Game 6.

Things you won't see in the World Series film:

After Brock went 4-for-4 in Game One and when he led off the game in Game Two, Lonborg sailed one at his head. That was the last the Red Sox heard from Brock that afternoon.
Nelson Briles retaliated by drilling Yaz in the legs his first AB in Game Three. Yaz sarcastically shouted ""Thank you"" to Briles as he headed to 1B. It didn't seem to stop Yaz in the whole series, although the film doesn't show him popping out twice with tying or go-ahead runs on 2B in Games Four and Five.
After the Sox won Game Six, Dick Williams told the press, ""Now it's Lonborg and champagne,"" and Boomer Scott said ""Gibson won't survive five."" Meaning innings. Curt Flood retorted by saying ""Gibson will be drunk by five."" Meaning o'clock.....
The impact Tony Conigliaro might have made on this Series....
Boston Mgr. Dick Williams pitched Lee Stange, who started 24 games for the Bosox and had a 2.77 ERA that season, only two innings the whole series....I might have given him the nod in Game Seven, ahead of hero Lonborg who, starting on just two days' rest, was by this point fatigued and leaving his pitches up for Maxvill, Gibson, and Javier to hammer.
St. Louis Mgr. Red Schoendienst similarly never started Ray Washburn (2-2/3 inn the whole series), who had started 27 games during the season and won 10.",1102377600,,2521,4.645739910313901

7832948,4,6302986877,"The tale of two cities in the 1982 World Series had to do with the contrast between the speed of Whitey Herzog's St. Louis Cardinals and the power of Harvey Kuenn's Milwaukee Brewers, although you could not tell from Game 1 when Harvey's Wallbangers went into Busch Stadium and crushed the Redbirds 10-0 with Mike Caldwell pitching a 3-hit shutout and Paul Molitor setting a record with five hits. However, the Brewers were playing without their relif ace, future Hall of Famer Rollie Fingers, who hurt his arm at the end of the season. His absence mattered in Game 2 when the Cardinals tied the series with a one run victory behind their relief ace, Bruce Sutter (who should be in the Hall of Fame). Even more auspicious for St. Louis, when the series shifted to Milwaukee was center fielder Willie McGee hitting a pair of home runs in Game 3, even though he had hit a total of four during the regular season.
You knew this one was headed for seven games when the Brewers came back from a 5-1 deficit in Game 4 to tie the series at two games each. In retrospect it becomes clear that this series had two halves. In the first three games the home team only won one game, and that bya single run. Then the home teams won the last four games as the Cardinals speed and pitching overcame the Brewers tendency for the long ball. The signature play of the series was when the Cardinals score TWO runs on a sacrifice fly to deep center field in Game 4: With McGee on third base and Ozzie Smith on second with one out in the second inning, Tom Herr hit a long drive to center field. Gorman Thomas tracked down the ball and made the catch but slipped on the warning track. McGee tagged after the catch and scored and so did Smith for a super rare two-run out.
This was the ninth World Championship for the St. Louis Cardinals, which is second on the all-time list behind that team in the Bronx. Catcher Darrell Porter, who only hit .231 during the regular season, was voted Series MVP after he grabbed the spotlight when he tied Game 2 with a two-out, two-run double. From a historical standpoint the 1982 World Series was a classic example of small ball beating long ball. The Cardinals had six players who had double figures in stolen bases during the year and their top slugger was outfielder George Hendrick, who had 19 home runs and 104 runs batted in during the season. The Brewers had eight players who had double figures in home runs and four with over 100 RBIs, with former Cardinal Ted Simmons adding 97 more. Robin Yount became the first player in World Series history to have a pair of 4-hit games, and in the end it was not enough.
Obviously, this video of highlights from the 1982 World Series is a joy for Cardinal fans and a bitter memory for Brewers fans, although this is the best video record of the team's glory years (and they did end up with three Hall of Famers with Fingers, Yount and Molitor, versus only one with Smith for the Cards). Add to this the grim fact that the Brewers now know that they will never ever be able to beat the Cardinals in a World Series rematch. At least Chicago Cubs and Boston Red Sox fans can at least point to the an actual possibility of redemption",1082160000,,3195,4.407783417935702
7832949,4,6302986877,"The 1954 Cleveland Indians discovered the secret of ending the New York Yankees streak of five straight American League pennants and World Championships: all they had to do was win a record 111 games.  However, despite that monumental success Al Lopez's team did not win a single game in the World Series, being swept by Leo Durocher's New York Giants.  It was the first time a National League team had won with a sweep since the Boston Braves in 1914.  The signature play of the series game in the eighth inning of the opener in the Polo Grounds when Giant center fielder Willie Mays made a historic Series catch, running flat out towards the center field wall with his back to the plate for an over the shoulder catch 460 feet from the plate of Vic Wertz's blast.  Watch the play closely: when Willie taps his glove that means he knows he has the ball all the way.
The hitting hero for the series ended up being Giants' pinch-hitter Dusty Rhodes.  In Game 1 he pinch-hit a 3-run home run in the tenth to break a 2-2 tie.  In Game 2 he came back with another pinch hit to tie the game at 1-1, stayed in the game and hit another home run.  In Game 3, Rhodes got yet another pinch-hit to drive in two runs.  They did not start giving out the World Series MVP award until the following year, but Rhodes would have been the obvious choice.  Actually, his success was not that surprising: during the regular season the platoon player batted .341 with 15 homers and 50 RBIs in only 164 times at bat.  But a .667 bating average in the Series is still pretty impressive. Meanwhile, the Indians starting rotation of Jim Lemon, Early Wynn, and Mike Garcia could not win a game and Bob Feller did not even get to pitch.  Wertz was the only bright spot for Cleveland, with a .500 average for the Series.  The Yankees would win eight of the next nine AL pennants again, the only pump in the road being the 1959 Chicago White Sox--also managed by Al Lopez.
So the team that won the most games in American League history lost the World Series in four straight and the Giants of Mays, Monte Irvin, John Antonelli, and Ruben Gomez had their first World Championship since 1933.  Giant fans probably have the great catch by Mays on several videos already in their home library, but this 40-minute black & white video gives you all of Rhodes's heroics as well.  Besides, unless you are a Giants fan who happen to be in your 70s, this would be the only Giant title in your lifetime.  Videos of Giant losses in the World Series are available for the 1951, 1962, 1989, and 2002 seasons as well.",1054944000,,2573,4.41014799154334
7832950,5,6302986877,"After the first three games of the 1973 World Series it was pretty clear this one was going to go seven.  Game 2 between the Oakland A's and the New York Mets went 12 innings and Game 3 went 11.  But then, this was the year that Mets Manager Yogi Berra uttered the most famous Berraism ""It ain't over 'til its over,"" (and reliever Tug McGraw's ""You Gotta Believe!) so of course this one was going to come down to Willie Mays being the tying run at the plate in the final at bat of his career.  This was a Mets team that won the National League Eastern Division with a 82-79 record and went five games to defeat Cincinnati's Big Red Machine to make it to the World Series.
Almost every game was close enough that you could point to one or two pivotal plays that would have turned things around.  Oakland scored two unearned runs off of Jon Matlack in Game 1 while Ken Holtzman and a bevy of relievers held the Mets to one run.  The A's scored two runs in the 9th to send the game into extra innings but ended up losing 10-7 when the Mets scored four runs in the top of the 12th.  All four of those runs were unearned because of an error by A's 2nd baseman Mike Andrews; after the game maverick Oakland owner Charles O. Finley tried to have the ""injured"" Andrews replaced on the roster, but Commissioner Bowie Kuhn was not stupid.  Back in New York Game 3 matched up future Hall of Famers Jim ""Catfish"" Hunter and Tom ""Terrific"" Seaver but neither was around at the end when the A's won 3-2 in 11 innings.  The Mets went up 3-2 in the series winning Games 4 and 5 behind stellar pitching by starters Matlack and Jerry Koosman, giving up one run in two games.  At this point the Mets learned that it ain't over until its over.
Facing elimination at home the A's won Game 6 behind Hunter's pitching and a pair of doubles from Reggie Jackson driving home a pair of runs.  In Game 7 the A's went up 4-0 with Jackson and Bert Campaneris hitting two-run homers off of Matlack.  But in the 9th inning the Mets were down three runs with two on base and Willie Mays at the plate.  But neither Mays not Wayne Garrett (the only player with 2 homers in the Series) could get a hit and Dick Williams and his crew had their second of three consecutive World Series championships.  Jackson, who had been injured the previous year and unable to play, was the Series MVP batting .310 with 5 extra base hits and 6 RBIs.  Actually the Mets batted .253 while holding the A's to only .212, but that did not make the difference in the end.  This color video of 1973 World Series highlights runs 43 minutes and should be of interest to fans of both the A's and the Mets.",1054598400,,2645,4.241035856573705

7832952,4,6302986877,"When the Brooklyn Dodgers faced the New York Yankees in the 1955 World Series it was their sixth meeting in 15 years and when the Dodgers dropped the first two games at Yankee Stadium it sure seemed like the results would going to be the same as they had been all of those previous times.  After all, no team had ever lost the first two games of a seven-game Series and come back to win.  The hero ended up being 23-year-old left handed pitcher Johnny Podres, who mixed his fastball and change of pace to win Game 3 and then came back to shutout the Yankees 2-0 in the deciding game.  Whitey Ford won games 1 and 6 for New York.  The signature play of the series was when left-handed leftfielder Sandy Amoros caught a slicing fly ball off the bat of Yogi Berra and turned it into a game-saving double play.  The two teams combined for a (then) record of 17 home runs with Duke Snider blasting four round trippers; Mickey Mantle only had one and was kept out of most of the games by a bad leg.  Gil Hodges drove in both of the runs in the finale.  The home team won the first six of the seven games in the Series.  This video of the ""1955 World Series: Brooklyn Dodgers v. New York Yankees"" runs about 41-minutes.  Obviously so those die-hard Brooklyn fans, traumatized by their beloved Bums leaving the borough for Los Angeles two years later, this video recalls the greatest moment in franchise history (okay, second greatest besides signing Jackie Robinson, who stole home in Game 1, but I am a Yankee fan and prejudiced).",1050105600,4,1524,4.414285714285715
