8260833,5,B00164SB8C,"Beautiful musical for young and old!! I wish it also would be released on DVD in English, how I watched and enjoyed this movie in Europe (1980 or so), titled ""Rock 'n Roll Wolf"". The songs in English -same music of the Russian version :) - are very catchy... you WILL sing along! However, if you know Grimm's fairy tale ""The Wolf and the Seven Kids"", it easy to follow the story along. Good experience for children to watch a movie in a different language. Hats off to all actors (the children are adorable), Moscow's Ice Ballet, and last but not least: the Russian Popov, gone to soon but not forgotten!!",1482710400,,605,4.45945945945946

8260838,4,B00164SB8C,"This film is loved in Russia!
It's based on the folk tale about Mama Goat who leaves her baby goats at home alone. That's when the bad guy, Wolf, will try to get them!
This DVD is entirely in Russian, filled with music and songs, and is so much fun to watch with your kids, starting with toddlers.
Keep in mind, however, that there are no English subtitles.

Popular Russian actors - Lyudmila Gurchenko and Mikhail Boyarsky - appear as main characters!",1369699200,2,452,4.512195121951219

This Musical is pure magic.

It is what I would like for heaven to be like:
Strange, funky, sexy and filed with carnival animals with tights, bad teeth and amazing singing voices.

8260842,1,B00164SB8C,I received this product and was really disapointed to see that it was in Russian only.  The film was what I wanted but since the title was translated in English I expected the movie to at least be in that language.  Very disapointing for the price.,1214352000,6,248,4.369565217391305
