So what's the issue you ask? Well, half of the event is missing. You can only see the first have of Bushido 9 on the disc that comes in this box set.",1293580800,8,239,3.6862745098039214
8516707,2,B003TKS7G2,"Now, I'd like to preface this by saying I own almost all PRIDE DVDs and that PRIDE is my favorite sports organization, period.

However, this DVD set is a cheat. The main reason I bought it was to get PRIDE Bushido 9, which included the first and second rounds of the welterweight and lightweight tournaments. But the DVD only gives you a third of the fight card. You get the first round of the welterweight tourney and one alternate bout of the lightweight tournament and then the DVD ends as if that was the end of the PPV.

I advise you don't buy this DVD set if you are in any way interested in seeing the FULL Bushido 9 fight card. Instead, buy all the dvds in the set individually. I'm going back now and purchasing Bushido 9 for a second time (to get the full fight card) and I'm not very happy about it.",1288310400,9,811,4.225806451612903
