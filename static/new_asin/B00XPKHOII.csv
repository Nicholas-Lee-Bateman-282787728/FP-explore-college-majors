7177277,5,B00XPKHOII,"This film was created by working with anti-trafficking organizations and homeland security investigation. It's inspired by actual events to raise awareness to what is happening in the U.S. It is not always fun to watch, but it is important in understanding what is happening all around us and what we can do about. Thankful for what the film has done to raise awareness and support for the victims of sex trafficking.",1447372800,7,417,4.887323943661972

7177285,4,B00XPKHOII,"Amber Stevens' story is a tale of thousands of girls in the US.  Girls can get easily drugged and put into prostitution.  The fact that she had such amazing parents who cared to help her so early on is rare, but good.  I think this movie showed a lot about what trauma is left behind and how it isn't so easy to cope after a rescue.  If she suffered as she did for 8 days, how much harder would it be for a girl put through sex trafficking for months to years?  I thought this was good but some of the acting wasn't that great at times.  There is some immodesty in it (no nudity), in case you are curious, but no sex is shown, just implied.  There is violence and threats and drug use as well.  I don't recall any bad language.",1465430400,5,727,4.034965034965035

7177295,5,B00XPKHOII,"This movie was very disturbing and very informative.  Human trafficking and child sexual abuse are causes that I care about.  I have had many preconceived notions that were so far from the truth.  This movie showed how so many young girls are exploited and become trapped in a life that they never expected.  A quote from the movie that I feel is so important for us to all remember is, ""No one ever wakes up thinking they'll be kidnapped or grows up wanting to be a prostitute.""  These women are victims - not criminals.  I loved that they talked about things that can be done to help victims get free from this slavery.",1456012800,,621,4.451327433628318

7177298,4,B00XPKHOII,This story is a definitely a much needed story and there needs to be more like it so we can make people aware of the things that are happening around us. The acting wasn't very good but the need for it overlooks any lack of quality.,1455580800,,232,4.065217391304348
7177299,1,B00XPKHOII,Moving was very stereotypical. The two girls that came from horrible backgrounds and were manipulated or sold into that life were treated as criminals and the upper class girl who went against what her parents said and was abducted was the only one treated as a victim. It's sad. They are all victims.,1455321600,4,301,4.69811320754717

7177307,5,B00XPKHOII,"This is a good start, however, more movies on this topic with more explicit details and events need to be shown. This is a horrific tragedy that destroys individuals, children and I am afraid that this movie is just not real enough to get into the hearts of those that believe it's ok or that it doesn't happen. I gave it a 5 star because it's a step stone. I read quite a few of the remarks and I was taken aback as to some of the responses. Everyone needs to see this film and hopefully more that are created. In this case, it's not about the acting, it's about the issue of children being prostituted and those sick individuals that pay to rape and sodomize those children.",1454457600,2,676,4.2890625

7177310,5,B00XPKHOII,"The topic of the movie, although important to understand, was not something I really wanted to know about much less see on a large screen.  Wake up as this atrocity is here and growing. However, I am thankful the director handled this topic with clarity, intensity, immediacy and truth  while sparing the audience some of the gory details . In that regard it reminded me of an old Hitchcock style movie leaving much of the horror to the imagination. I think this movie was artfully done and I am better for knowing about this topic and thankful for the movie producers, writers and actors.  I have purchased several of these movies in order to spread the word.",1454198400,2,660,4.6239316239316235
7177311,5,B00XPKHOII,"This film is an awakening to the tragedy of sex trafficking in our own backyards. It shows the horror of finding your own child caught up in the kidnapping, drugging, and life changing terror of what happens in this  heinous crime.  i could just cry along with the mother in this film as if the trapped teen was my own child.  I feel this is a must see for all teenagers to ""get smart"" about being cautious in your choices.  Based on a true story.",1454112000,2,447,4.223529411764706

7177317,1,B00XPKHOII,"This is the worst thing to happen to victims of human trafficking or sexual abuse and represents everything wrong with Christian film and Christian branding. I am speaking as a Christian and a survivor of child sexual assault and rape. The film marginalizes and criminalizes everyone who is not Christian which is the exact opposite action that Christ instructed us to take. He taught us to love and to forgive and to welcome and not to judge. The film also infantilizes people and the truth; Christian books and films do this across the board and by doing so it creates a massive chasm that our children fall through because what is portrayed in a Christian book or film does not equate to what they see in real life so they end up feeling helpless, scared and alone sitting with important questions they feel they can't ask in youth group.
The film goes on to portray females who are trafficked in the worst possible light. My heart broke for the two girls who were not Christian and therefore not worth saving. What a disgusting judgement to cast on human life by filmmakers who call themselves Christian.
The takeaway for me was that if I'm white, upper-middle class and come from a Republican, Christian home and I make a bad choice, the SWAT team and Jesus will save me, but if I'm anything 'less' I deserve what I get. Wrong. On so very many levels. Wrong.
I work with survivors. They hated your film too. What would be preferable would be for organizations to receive trauma-informed training and go back to the instructions Jesus left us-LOVE.",1452384000,6,1552,4.6678832116788325
7177318,2,B00XPKHOII,"Okay.... so I almost don't want to rate it so badly because human trafficking is real and awareness is necessary. However, this film is horrible. The acting was painful to watch. There really was no script. Everything seemed improved and not in a good way. I feel like if they were going to spend the time and money (no matter how little) on any film they could have at least created a script and hired some actors that weren't laughable. The only semi good actors were the girl's parents. The girl did okay, but her expression at times looked like she was going to start laughing. I think it would have been a good film to show teens and parents to raise awareness, but I am afraid that people will not take it seriously at all because of the quality of the film.",1452124800,2,764,4.34965034965035
7177319,1,B00XPKHOII,"If there was a no star option, I would have selected that.  This topic is so incredibly important and I wanted my teen daughter to watch this and take it seriously, but the poor acting and production completely distracted from the importance of the topic and my teen did not take it seriously.",1452038400,3,293,4.528301886792453
7177320,1,B00XPKHOII,"Just awful. This would be an excellent film for filmmaking instructors to use to show a class bad filmmaking. And I'm not trying to be funny here - I""m serious. Where to begin?

1 - It never knows whether it wants to be a documentary or a story. If you can suffer through the several minutes of preachy narration at the beginning, you actually get into a bit of a story. Not a NEW story - this is absolutely nothing innovative here.

2 - The acting is on par with a high school drama production. Seriously. The one real standout is the actress playing the mother, who only lapses occasionally into melodrama.  The rest of the performances are either over the top (someone get the lead actress an acting lesson!) melodramatic or stereotype aping, or deadpan.

3 - The script isn't helping the actors. It's just really, really bad. It's full of cliches and stereotypes. (I say this as a pro writer and editor - I sometimes edit screenplays for pay.)

4 - The production values are atrocious. I can only hope it was due to a terribly small budget, because there is really no excuse for some of that lighting.

5 - This is not a film made with intelligence. Actors stumble through scenes mouthing cliches, self-consciously crying on cue, exerting meaningful sighs on cue, without anyone really thinking about any of this dialog. Some lines hardly make sense - they are someone's idea of what should be said, not the result of any writer seriously thinking about what someone would say or feel in a given situation.  There is not a depth of understanding of the human condition here.  The film does not even attempt to draw the viewer in; it merely presents a scenario and demands,""There, Viewer. Isn't this terrible?  Now feel something!""  That isn't sophisticated filmmaking, and it isn't even good filmmaking.

I would have this advice for the filmmakers:

1 - Hire a real writer. Don't write you own script, or have your buddy do it.  Invest a little cash in hiring someone who knows what they are doing, because a good script is the foundation of your film.

2 - Teach your actors that Less is More.  Less emoting, a little subtlety, can send a message far louder than a lot of mindless wailing and crying and giggling and rolling of eyes.

3 - Hold off making the film until you have the money raised. Don't cut production quality, hire incompetent cast, and scrawl your own script. You bury yourself before you shoot the first 10 minutes.

4 - Either make a documentary or make a narrative film, but don't try to put both into one. You aren't skilled enough yet.  And BTW if you do make a documentary, do some research, so you aren't spewing assumptions and stereotypes or information your audience already knows.  Try to present something new, with some real stats and real stories to back you up.",1451692800,2,2800,4.597585513078471

The scenes during her captivity show her freely crying and panicking in the presence of her captors.  It strikes me as unrealistic, from what I have read from victim stories where emotional expression is violently prohibited.  But, the emotion she shows must be what it would feel like to go through something like this, which I can appreciate.  I would say it is a good movie that brings attention to these issues of our day.  It is a film I have watched more than once and I am glad to have it.",1503878400,,595,4.372727272727273
