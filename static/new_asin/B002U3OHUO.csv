3987155,5,B002U3OHUO,"I knew exactly what I was ordering as far as the ""Bass Lesson Set"" by RoyV. If you are here and thinking about ordering this then you are serious about your musical path.  Believe me when I say that this is a minor investment for what you are getting and the best thing is you can always go back to the lessons later down the road.  Not that using instructors are a bad thing but like anything else it is a roll of the dice, this is the sure thing.  I actually paid three times as much as this investment on instructors in the past six months!  By no measure this is more organized and flows the best of any program of its sort.  Life is short, get off the bench and join the game!

Oh yeah, btw the product was shipped and arrived super fast!",1329091200,14,743,4.054794520547945
3987156,5,B002U3OHUO,"I have had lessons on the bass before, I've also used DVD bass instruction as well in the past - simply put: neither compare to Roy Vogt's Teach Me Bass Guitar program - it is the best.

It starts at the basics and systematically grows more complex once you have the foundation in place. There is a ""loop library"" that allows you to play back a specific portion of lesson as many times as it takes to get the technique in question or song locked down. It also comes with tons of songs to play with a band.

It has been a few weeks now - my bandmates notice a definate difference in play.

This is a good program - well worth the money.

3987157,5,B002U3OHUO,This is a fantastic set of DVD's for learning the bass guitar.  The instruction is very clear and the lessons are well organized.  Highly recommend for someone wanting to learn the bass on their own.,1294790400,7,199,4.6571428571428575

3987159,5,B002U3OHUO,"Roy does a great job.  I'm a beginner and Roy's methods work well.  The video instruction is so much better than just a self teach book.  Having the ability to replay the lessons and practice with Roy and his band is very helpful.  For us, guys, Roy's assistant Ashley is joyous!",1423180800,4,279,4.411764705882353

THE COMBO OF ROY STATING THE NOTES AS HE PLAYS, THE ONSCREEN FRETBOARD, AND SEEING HIS HANDS PLAY THE NOTES INCORPORATES EVERYONES LEARNING STYLES.

3987161,4,B002U3OHUO,"I bought this product from the website it came in two days and I agree with everybody's assessment that it is very well put together, instruction is very good but I was going through a bass book that I will not name here and it is pretty much the same information for only 20 dollars okay 35 dollars if you buy the accompanying dvd with the course.  Not that this is a bad course but you have to download the book that comes with it Gibson's learn and master guitar costs less than this product and they include the workbook.  I think whatever learning method you choose whether you need a dvd or can learn from a book and cd's is generally up to each person but remember everything is a tool if I find this product for less on ebay or even amazon I may buy it again but the cost is just too much.",1378684800,,797,4.102564102564102
3987162,5,B002U3OHUO,"I think these DVD lessons are amazing.  If you already know some music theory there will be some boring spots for you, but it's still 100% worth it.  A good private teacher is probably the quickest way to success.  If you are like me, you don't have the time or money.  If you have the discipline to work at it you will not be sorry you purchased Roy Vogt's Teach Me Bass Guitar!",1373328000,6,379,4.1506849315068495

3987164,5,B002U3OHUO,"As far as what is out there on the market today,just short of a bass guitar teacher, there is nothing that is remotely even close to the quality and quantity of information in this course. TMBG is not a fly by night crash course that promises you to unrealistic goals of being an accomplished bass player in a matter of weeks. This course is designed to take anyone from ground level knowing nothing other than having a desire and a commitment to be a an intermediate to advanced bass guitarist and not just someone who can hack out a tune by riding the low E string. This is not for those who think they want to play bass guitar. This course is an investment in your musicianship as it will give you an edge that most bass players do not have. TMBG teaches you technical skill of how to physically play the bass as well as the scales, theory, sight reading, Nashville number system, etc. I could go on and on and on. The bottom line is this, I own or have owned a lot of instructional DVD courses for guitar, bass, drums, etc.... This is by far the best of all bass courses. If you really want to be a bass guitarist and not just someone who plays bass (there is a difference), then this is the course for you. It is taught by a professional bass player who is also an educator. Roy Vogt teaches bass at the prestigious Belmont University and he was the very first to get a master's degree in the electric bass. A truly awesome course and it is well worth the investment. The have a great support team who stand behind there product and a learning community where others can share ideas, advice, and help. Roy himself gets on there to assist anyone having problems. Great course it is a must buy for anyone who is serious about being a bass player.",1343606400,17,1749,4.319148936170213
3987165,5,B002U3OHUO,"One of the biggest problem with taking music lessons is scheduling.  The other is price.  Teach Me Bass Guitar takes care of both problems.  Not only is it affordable (two years worth of lessons for under $200.00), but you study when YOU'RE ready.  No extra expense for gas to get to your class, and not a minute wasted in travel.

The course itself has phenomenal production values and many added features to get you playing bass!  There's a real-time fretboard to follow along with the lesson, practice loops that you can use over and over again at your own pace (loops have FAST or SLOW samples), and even an on-screen band that you can practice with once you get each lesson under your belt.

I'm taking this course myself - I bought mine on the Teach Me Bass Guitar website - and I couldn't be more satisfied!

There's no better self-paced bass instruction series in the world!  Don't you deserve the best?",1342137600,8,911,4.574074074074074
3987166,5,B002U3OHUO,"I ordered this after trying 3 other DVDs.  This is by far the best I have seen.  The instructions are easy to follow and the amount of information crammed into each lesson is amazing.  The Loop Library is the reason that they can get so much training in each lesson.  Roy Vogt will spend a few minutes teaching you a technique and you go into the loop library and practice it as many times as needed before moving on to the next section.  Each step is enough of a jump forward, that I really feel like I have to push myself practicing, before I hit the next section.  It really gives me the feeling of accomplishment as I progress.

NOTE - When I say ""Section"" I mean each step within a lesson.  Getting through the first lesson was relatively quick for me, because I had some practice with other DVDs, but from the second lesson on, it takes hours practicing to get through each lesson.  I was skeptical about the claim that this is designed to take months to complete, but they aren't exaggerating.

This is well worth the money, I should have spend the money on this up front instead of wasting my time and money on the other DVDs.",1334102400,18,1134,4.331753554502369
3987167,5,B002U3OHUO,"The trouble with books is that they get boring after a while, no matter how well-written they are. This, on the other hand, is a fantastic set of DVDs. Roy's teaching style and ability to communicate concepts in an easy manner are noteworthy. The producers obviously spent a lot of time and effort to put this set together and it shows in the arrangement, the packaging, and the ability to download a PDF from one of the discs. This is one course you'll keep going back to so if you're serious about your playing, get this.
I hope the producers and Roy are thinking about volume II as well, dealing with advanced concepts.",1330992000,3,622,4.513274336283186

8380959,5,B002U3OHUO,"I played the bass (self-taught) as a teenager and have now picked it back up after over 20 years of a break. Back then, I played with my friends who actually knew what they were doing, so I slacked on a number of core topics, like music theory.  This is my first attempt at a bit more meaningful instruction and I find this course is very well done. I am only about 3 lessons deep at this time. Roy spends a bit of time initially on music theory (I feel that this topic can be explained a bit better. Along with some basics from the Internet it can be easily augmented, though.)
The first two lessons were especially helpful to me. I could immediately learn some basics that improved my plucking technique as well as my left hand positioning and to avoid cramping and weird finger stretching.
The PDF version of the booklet is very helpful as well. Amazon offers this course at a significant discount over other online retailers (I think the SRP is about $250 and some other sites offer this for $200.)",1490054400,,1002,4.416216216216216
8380960,5,B002U3OHUO,"No better self instruction program out there!  Roy takes you thru literally years of lessons in this set.  This is meant to be a 'college course' in bass education.

I took the time to read the 2-star reviews.  I don't understand these people.  One discusses why Roy is not teaching box shape v. open strings.  Really?  There are always several ways to play a scale/chord/triad on any instrument.  It's good to learn more than one.  I make it a point of trying to learn 2-3 ways to play some lines, just to keep my mind sharp.  I believe Roy is trying to stress ""position playing"" early on, but then that reviewer never went past the 3rd lesson.  How sad.

Having had access to, or purchased numerous bass resources, I can definitely recommend this set, and at the price offered its really a bargain.  If I have any issue with it its that Roy does not spend enough time on the very basic ""basics"".  For that reason I recommend Ed Friedland's Hal Leonard Bass Book as your starting resource, followed by this set.",1470096000,,1012,4.489010989010989
8380961,2,B002U3OHUO,"I've played guitar for the last 3 years.  I decided that I wanted to learn to play bass because I kept hearing really great basslines in the music I was listening to and I was inspired to want to do the same.  There aren't many lengthy bass DVD lessons like TMBG so it was one of the only choices for self-study.  Actually, it's the only one I know of on DVD so I purchased it.

The 1st lesson starts off with the basics. The student is introduced to the note names and how to hold the bass, alternating plucking, parts of the bass, etc.  All fine and dandy here.

Lesson #2 is where the lessons take a nosedive and become unhelpful.  Vogt clearly knows his material and is a great player.  He begins to show the student how to play all the major scales.  Some of the fingerings he uses are unclear why he uses them.  He plays some of the scales with open strings.  I didn't understand why he was showing such a weird way to play the scale instead of the box shape. After he spent an hour or so showing all the scales, he doesn't mention at all why you are supposed to practice the scales and how.  I find that's the difference between someone who shows and someone who teaches and gives concrete examples of how a concept is beneficial and practical.

I gave up after Lesson 3.  That's where Vogt introduces 3 minor scales.  He spends time showing how to play them but you don't know what to use them for and in what context.

I think one of the biggest concepts left out of this DVD set is ear training and encouraging students to play by ear & showing how to get started.  So much of a bass players role is listening, getting a groove established and hearing chord changes.  None of that is emphasized in this series.  Norm Stockton's ""Art of Groove"" website really opened the door to bass, grooves & drums relationship in a band.

A lot of the remaining lessons (and many other dvds) leave out the practicality of the concepts. Sure, you get a chance to play with the band onscreen with the playalong songs.  But why does Vogt choose certain chord tones to play over a progression?  Some people may say it's up to the student to be creative and find their own way to make use of the concepts.  I believe that to an extent for more advanced students however most beginners will need a little hand holding like myself.  It doesn't hurt at all to give examples in the beginning then tell the student to explore creatively once they've gotten a grip on what it is their doing and why.  So many concepts,very little understanding of how to apply and be musical with the information. I felt extremely frustrated with the DVDs and quickly sought out a teacher.  I also am learning guitar and if anything Learn and Master Guitar never left me frustrated.  I saw how the musical concepts applied and it gives guidance on how to gauge when you're ready to move on from the lesson to the next.  This series doesn't not.

PROS:
Great chance to play along with a band onscreen.
Fairly cheap
Onscreen graphics
Music theory introduced

CONS:
Very low teacher interaction on the course's forum to get questions answered
Highly focused on 12-bar blues and jazz  styles. Where's the rock, pop, metal and funk?!
Not enough explanation on the ""whys"" and ""hows"", most talks about the ""whats""",1457568000,6,3274,4.442953020134228
8380962,2,B002U3OHUO,"This starts out very good; the technology is better than most as a fretboard appears as he plays.  After the first few lessons you realize he is a master musician but a horrible teacher.  He teaches a concept but the practice lesson is not consistent with the instruction; for example, a bass progression is taught with the theory behind the notes that should be played but then the sample you play doesn't follow the instruction! You get so confused because he tells you how the notes should be selected but then adds notes that don't seem to be appropriate. Hard to explain but if you go on his blog (only after you've paid) you find students confused and frustrated. Simple professional teaching methods are not followed. I'm quitting his instructions because I spend way too much time trying to figure out why the practice songs don't follow what was taught. This is ALMOST a good system but I was so frustrated and confused I will try another system that has a consistent method. They need a professional educator to edit and correct the lessons so they can be understood by a student ( not an expert bass musician).",1452902400,7,1121,4.656565656565657
8380963,5,B002U3OHUO,"Not much I can add to these glowing, 5 star reviews except to offer a couple of comments.

I like the course and it seems well organized and the quality of the video is great.

Two books I feel are in this category of quality and are worth reading are:

 Bass Guitar from Scratch by Bruce Emery

The Complete Idiots Guide to Bass Guitar by David Hodge.

Each of these books adds the musical theory in a way not presented in TMBG.

In addition, there's a free program for the Fretlight line of guitars and basses that's useful for learning scales, and chords as well as containing a full set of backing tracks to jam along with.

It work better with the Fretlight bass guitar, but is still quite useful in and of its own.

It's available for free download at the frelight site. It's called Fretlight Studio 6. Look under the software offerings.",1443657600,,843,4.422077922077922
