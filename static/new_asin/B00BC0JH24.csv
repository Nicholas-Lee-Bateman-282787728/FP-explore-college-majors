5572134,5,B00BC0JH24,"This was such a good series, what a shame it ended unfinished. Left us more then a little mad wishing it had a FINAL ending. If you buy this movie you will be taken in and so disappointed because it has no ending and will leave you wanting more.",1377475200,,245,4.020408163265306
5572135,3,B00BC0JH24,"Not only does this not have captioning or subtitles, the sound is awful. It goes from blaring to low and back again. Very disappointing.",1376611200,,136,4.708333333333333
5572136,2,B00BC0JH24,"The description was very misleading!! It was more like a soap opera. It was more about romance than anything else. I didn't feel like it was really a family show. It wasn't terrible but I wish I hadn't bought it. It bordered on the edge of me throwing it out. We did watch it all but there was really no purpose to it! Apparently the show was canceled, you are left hanging.",1375574400,,374,4.208333333333333
5572137,4,B00BC0JH24,"Good Series, too bad it didn't keep going.  Kind of sappy at times but overall interesting to watch. I love that the theme song was by Loreena McKennitt.",1375488000,,153,4.464285714285714
5572138,2,B00BC0JH24,"This show had so much potential. Unfortunately the writers ruined it with constant soap-opera-like relationship problems. First episode the oldest brother breaks off engagement because he's always been in love his father's secretary, but the second episode shows him in bed with a one-night-stand.  And so it goes with each character in following episodes. Thankfully the youngest sister (about 11 yrs old) is the only one with any sense, but the writers would have probably messed-up her character if there would have been a second season.",1375488000,,540,5.27906976744186
5572139,5,B00BC0JH24,"I bought this DVD at Walmart for $5.00 .  It was worth every penny, and then some.  I was sorry at the ending, and even more sorry that there wasn't,t more DVD,s to buy.  I am very sorry.  I am sorry that I watch it.",1373760000,,216,3.7333333333333334
5572140,5,B00BC0JH24,"I just purchased this DVD and finished watching it only to be dismayed like others that it really wasn't the END...rather, it left me wondering if perhaps I forgot another disc, or if maybe there were additional shows available...how disappointing to find out from other comments that in fact, there are no more shows to continue the story!  I enjoy watching the ""prairie-type"" movies and found this one to be one of the best!!  I loved all the family characters and their situations, and can't understand why they stopped making them....I hope somehow it can be reactivated with the continuing saga...I would follow them all!!",1372550400,,627,4.961904761904762
5572141,5,B00BC0JH24,"I used to watch this show during original airing and had really bad VHS recordings ot it. This set brought back fond memories of how great LEGACY really was!
Glad the show was released on DVD!!",1372550400,,193,4.388888888888889
5572142,5,B00BC0JH24,"I just watched the series and loved each and everyone.  I can't remember when I enjoyed a series/movie as much as I have this one.  It was incredible.  Like the other reviewers, I was saddened by the ending and wished it would have been continued.  I hope that someone will see the real value of this series and produce more of them.  Wonderful characters that fit perfectly into their roles.  We need more movies like this one to inspire and uplift us.  All I can say is FANTASTIC!!",1370304000,68,483,4.420454545454546
5572143,3,B00BC0JH24,"We were really interested in this show but the packaging is misleading...it is 18 episodes, but there is no ""closure""...Did they cancel suddenly and fail to alert the writers so that the story could be completed in a satisfactory manner?  It ""ends"" with the entire family at odds with the (usually great) father, and with a couple of scammers about to murder him and fight the children for the horse farm.  Looks almost like a season ending ""cliff hanger""...but I can't find more DVD's...so  would not recommend it at this point.
  The music and scenery are beautiful, and the characters are well developed and interesting.  It's extremely fictional, but entertaining.  We were just disappointed with the ending.
  It's set in Kentucky, post Civil War...a widower and his four children plus an ""orphan"" he took in who is a love interest for the oldest daughter as well as creating some competition with the two sons.  The Father is wonderful, loving and wise--some episodes had us laughing and crying at the same time.  The horse farm is beautiful, and there are many scenes of the fabulous horses.",1368057600,83,1098,4.881081081081081

5572146,1,B00BC0JH24,OH my Gosh!! Seriously??? I was watching this WITH MY KIDS when the oldest brother decides to sleep with a prostitute?? Really??? How is that like Little House on the Prarie or Family Friendly?? I'm totally confused.,1493337600,5,216,4.864864864864865
5572147,3,B00BC0JH24,"I wish I could say I really liked this show. I wanted to. Some of it was good. It has the strangest theme song for a show about horses, sort of Enya-esque. The acting is like the rest...just okay. For the most part it's completely clean, There is randomly an episode in which both the father and one of the sons have meetings with women in town. That's really the only part that wasn't ""Little House"". I picked this up at a used book store and thought, ""Hey, I'll give it a try."" If you are sitting around bored and have already seen Christy, Larkrise, North & South, etc. then it would probably be enough entertainment to keep you awake. It is not anything like Little House on the Prairie as it states only the cover.

It is set in Kentucky. There are lots of horse ranches around. The scenery is beautiful. It's not a complete series. They just stopped. I assume it was cancelled and it's a shame because it could have been so much better.",1488931200,2,942,4.322033898305085

5572150,3,B00BC0JH24,"I really enjoyed this in the 1990s. I found a used copy of it here on Amazon for a few dollars and picked it up. I enjoy it now, too, but it's definitely a bit dated, and because it was cancelled, abruptly cuts off without resolution to a number of points at the end of the series.",1484092800,2,281,3.9473684210526314
5572151,3,B00BC0JH24,haven't watched it yet but I'm sure i will love it. I like most all horse and dog movies,1483574400,,88,3.6842105263157894

5572157,2,B00BC0JH24,"""Fans of Little House on the Prairie will love this wonderful family series"" is the headline and very misleading.  There should be a rating, and it is not a good family movie.  There is drinking, much lying, stealing, deceit and immoral behavior with a bedroom scene in one of the early episodes with the oldest son ( who supposedly loves his family's African-American staff lady) and a woman he just meets .  We are very disappointed with what could have been a beautiful series with good lessons.  It went into the trash.",1478822400,,523,4.6521739130434785

5572166,5,B00BC0JH24,"I love this series and it is what I hoped for, except I don't think the episodes are listed in sequence, making it hard to watch chronologically, but overall great. My only complaint is that the series ended too soon and didn't give closure to some of the storylines, but that has to do with the creators and network, not this product itself.",1471046400,2,342,4.444444444444445

5572171,5,B00BC0JH24,I really enjoyed the movie up to the point that everything really had a should I say cliff hanger. Went immediately to Barnes and Noble to get the next movie after watching 4 DVDs only to find there was no conclusion. Talk about disappointing!! That should be illegal or something! Don't bother even watching!!! What a disappointment!!,1468368000,,335,4.894736842105263

5572174,3,B00BC0JH24,"This series is advertised as ""Fans of Little House on the Prairie will love this Wonderful Family Series.""  First, it in NO way resembles Little House on the Prairie.  Second, there is a lot of lying, heavy alcohol consumption, lots of kissing and on a few episodes listed below, immoral behavior.  It is geared to teenagers/young adults and would not be suitable for younger children.  There are some good episodes.  If you don't watch ""Blood Relative,"" ""Full House,"" or the last 4 episodes of the series you may find it acceptable.  There was good acting, beautiful scenery & horses, period costumes, etc., but proceed with caution.  It's too bad they didn't gear this to families and uphold higher moral principles.",1463961600,6,718,4.933333333333334

5572178,5,B00BC0JH24,Superb and wholesome family focused drama series - but warning: series was cancelled prematurely and storyline (excellent) left unresolved. This series is so enjoyable with quality acting and horseback riding. Would love to see it offered again by amazon.com as I have recommended to everyone I know who would enjoy it and am disappointed I cannot order some as gifts for my equine enthusiast compatriots.,1459296000,4,405,5.246153846153846

she is a witch (not a good one) ,  sat up all night watching the thing just to see her get it,  never happened,  left us in the dark,  she and someone else  are going to kill the father her husband,  the whole family is at odds,  I do hope they finish this at some point.  Had I known this would end
but not end like this (not finished),  I would not have bought it.  We loved it till the end of the film, not the end of the show, cause there is no end",1458864000,6,585,3.743801652892562

5572181,5,B00BC0JH24,Loved this series when it came out. I had taped the series on VHS (this was before DVDs) so I was so excited to now have it on DVD!!! It was a sad day for me when they took it off the air. And the way they let it end left so many unanswered questions. Inspite of this show is still one of my favorite TV shows of all time.,1458691200,,322,3.6142857142857143

I'm furious!  Now I have to shred it to keep someone else from getting duped.  Sometimes reviews spoil the fun of watching, but this, well, I'm speechless. No wonder Netflix doesn't carry it.  Customers would vent on THEM!",1458432000,2,388,4.892307692307693

5572186,5,B00BC0JH24,"I was so totally involved in this drama,couldn't wait to see what would happen next. Just finished watching 18 episodes and totally loved it. We need more shows of this caliber. Happy to have viewed it but not being aware it was an abruptly canceled show with an incomplete ending was aggravating.  What kind of inconsiderate, irresponsible network drops a series prior to a decent conclusion.

Legacy is a family western drama led by patriarch/widower Ned Logan (Brett Cullen)running a prestigious Kentucky horse farm who has a legacy to uphold no matter the obstacles,his son's failed engagement,a devastating barn fire, the addition of an orphan but he is a very honorable man determined to defend the family name. He believes in a solid foundation of love/support and helping others less fortunate. They are a proud,close knit family working to maintain their values among a society driven by power,greed,self-centered neighbors who only pretend to have integrity.

Ned's eldest son Sean (Grayson McCough,) handsome, charismatic with a promising future. Clay (Jeremy Garrett,), passionate, hot-headed son. Alice (Lea Moreno) a mature conflicted teenager very willing to accept the responsibility of running the household and Lexy (Sarah Rayne,) the youngest, who is mature beyond her years. All are prime examples of the best parenting.

This is an excellent, wholesome TV series, with exceptional actors/actresses. There is plenty happening to keep a viewers interest and anticipation to what may happen next. Although evil is around every corner the series is minus violence and killing,maybe that is one reason it was canceled. Go figure today's audiences. The most violent movies create best box office.

Surely would give most anything to see the ""wicked stepmother"" get what she deserves.",1453593600,,1798,5.361702127659575
5572187,3,B00BC0JH24,"This can't be a ""complete series""  the story just ends.  Needs at least 2 more episodes.  I was very disappointed.  I had purchased this set some time ago and thought maybe the one I had wasn't complete.  They both just end.  Left a body hanging.  Certainly not ""Complete"" As I said, very disappointing.

I want to see these characters again and would love to see the series resurrected, if only to give us closure.

Not well acted, except for the little girl who was really a natural little actress.  I will donate it to a nearby assisted living facility because it may bless them and fill some lonely hours.

Scenery, acting, music are all great.  The writing lacked compassion for the viewer's feelings.

This was so well done and the actors suburb. The story line is excellent, never dull! The only sad part was the way it ended, or shall I say how it did not end. It left you hanging with no real ending. My guess was maybe the show just quit suddenly for reasons undisclosed.
I am putting a pray out there that they get together and continue this fabulous series. I do not take part in viewing TV, it is empty.
This series had rich substance. Even if it ended the way it did, I recommend it highly any way, it is well worth it!

5572247,1,B00BC0JH24,"Huge, huge disappointment.  Not only does the story not end, it does not live up to the description on the box.  What starts as a story about family, love, and adventure ends up as a terrible destruction of family, an illusion of love, and an adventure in an all out attempt to destroy a young Kentucky family.  The first half has quite a few redeeming qualities and shows the beauty of changed lives through the graciousness of trust and forgiveness and second chances.  But by the end, all of that grace and faith that provided those second chances was so exploited with no resolution, it leaves the viewer feeling soiled and depressed.  If you are searching for a family film series that displays a main character who is successful at ""defending his family name"" and ""upholding a legacy no matter the obstacle"" as the description implies, this is not the right series for you.  It does nothing of the sort, but paints any person who is willing to have faith and grace towards his fellow man as a fool. The story doesn't resolve and the last 4 episodes show the paternal figure and just that - ""a fool"" who has fallen for the masquerade of a deceptive and greedy winch.

Not a lot of people remember this show, and although I was in middle school when it aired, and some parts were a bit scandalous, I still really enjoyed it.

I do not rate that suitable for children and the constant willingness to enter into physical relationships is not historically convincing. Some of the characters are likeable and the scenes of horses are beautifully done but the plot gets very depressing and unbelievable and many of the characters are willing to cheat, lie, sleep with people, marry and sell themselves for money in order to get their way which is not fun to watch.

Since the reviews I read stated that this one was something similar to that of Little House, I put it on my wish list and a friend bought it for me. I'm sorry to say that after only 3 episodes I'm very disappointed because of the unnecessary adult content.

Show was well acted but morals were all over the place with occasional promiscuity (although no nudity thankfully) and moral lapses with little or no consequences. Father is depicted as a very loving father until the last few episodes when he begins to choose a woman he just met and marries over his kids most of which he has raised on his own for years. The show ends there. Could have been a great show but seems to have had trouble deciding if it wanted to be a more family oriented show or an evening soap opera and ended up being neither.,1414627200,4,674,4.232558139534884

5572318,4,B00BC0JH24,"I think of this series as a long, long movie. I watched each series back to back. Each one makes you want to see what happens next. It is quite addictive and the scenery and music get stuck in your head. The actors are very good, all of them. They really get into their roles, some quite funny to watch. The series rates 5+ stars. The only reason I bumped it down one star is because there is no closure to any of the major conflicts or struggles in the end. There basicly is no ending. You are left hanging to create an ending to every relationship in development. There is huge potential for new twists and turns in the outcome and yet there is nothing. The end (cut off) doesn't even imply what might happen. It is truly cut in the middle of various incomplete stories lines. Even so, with that said, the characters are so good you enjoy watching the shorter quick story lines that are completed. This series was done so long ago, it is hard to imagine the outcry for more hasn't produced a new series to date. If there is anyone on the writing or directing team that reads these reviews, PLEASE consider at least finishing your series in a book with some closure. I'm tempted to write a book myself.
I would recommend this series for family viewing. It is clean and for the most part avoids suggestive scenes except for the second to last in the series ""Where Spirit Lives."" There is a scene where a woman steps out of bed with her upper back bare and she then dresses. The man she is with is not her husband. Otherwise there are a few scenes with couples kissing. I don't recall any bad language. There is a part of the series that depicts someone struggling with a medicine addiction. There is also some card game gambling and alcohol use. It fits with the setting and is appropriately portrayed for the time. I didn't think any of these scenes were exaggerated or prolonged.
I do hope the powers that be would bring this series back. It would require new young characters obviously. It has been some 15 years ago now. I don't watch TV because of the garbage that is pushed. Young folks need to see what wholesome life can be like. If you bring it back, don't compromise on keeping it clean. Thanks!",1401580800,4,2205,4.380487804878049

Much like Little House and Love Comes Softly, it was a heart warming story that promoted good Christian ethics and connected you with the characters. Today's shows are soulless, evil, shallow, and demeaning to viewer's intelligence.  By pulling Legacy, the TV execs have strengthened my already considerable  contempt for them and the crap they are trying to force feed us viewers.  Most evenings, if I bother with TV at all, I find myself watching ""How It's Made"" or the History channel or even more often, resorting to a good book to avoid the sickening, shallow crap masquerading as ""entertainment"" on TV today.

One other big gripe I have is the annoying advertising imposing on the program that ruins the show.  It is as if they insist on rubbing their crap in our faces trying to force us to watch what they deem as entertainment.  Can you tell that I am growing increasingly angry at the idiots who control what's on TV these days?  My disgust is growing stronger, so much so that most evenings I find I am avoiding TV altogether.

5572349,1,B00BC0JH24,Got this movie and really enjoyed it until I got to the last disc and found out that this was the end of the series and no conclusion.  The end of the movie just leaves you hanging there should of been more to this series the end of this series is just horrible.  I enjoyed the show and searched around to find more of the series but found out that was it.  They really should finish up with this show and do a few more series if I would of realized that it ended this way I probably would not of made the purchase.  It was like watching a really good movie you couldn't turn off then in the middle of the show it just stopped and you never get to see the ending.  If they made more of this series I would purchase them but for just what this movie had it got you interested in it makes you love it then just cuts you off.,1381449600,36,822,3.8982035928143715

5572351,2,B00BC0JH24,"My whole family enjoyed the first 2 episodes so we were so disappointed when in the 3rd episode there is a bed scene between a main character and stranger.  NOT what we consider a family movie which was said to be ""like Little House on the Prairie"".  After reading the other reviews and how the ending is missing, I doubt we'll finish watching the other episodes.  Very disappointing.",1381017600,4,384,4.617647058823529
5572352,5,B00BC0JH24,"Very good series, however it quit in mid-stream on the last story, because unknown to all us viewers, they cut the production, before the story ended.

We were very disappointed with the fact they stopped production of the series, before wrapping up the storyline.

This could have been avoided, if they had ended the story in the last of the series. Very poor planning on behalf of the production company.. Don't buy this series, if you want a complete story, because it lacks an ending.",1380672000,2,488,4.729411764705882
5572353,2,B00BC0JH24,The story ends before wrapping up anything.  It was fun to watch but was left unsatisfied because all the issues were unresolved.  Obviously the show was meant to go on but didn't.  Sorry I invested so much time in watching all 18 episodes to find this out.,1380326400,,257,4.425531914893617

This was one of my favorite shows and looked everywhere to find it only to be disapointed by no ending. I thought when I watched it on tv that it had more than what the dvd offered. I am very disapointed!",1379289600,,304,3.8412698412698414

8565633,5,B00BC0JH24,This is an amazingly riveting series about a post civil war family. The cinematography is absolutely as gorgeous as the cast. Great family episodes. So sad they only made one season.,1507420800,,182,4.903225806451613
8565634,1,B00BC0JH24,"I am reviewing because my opinion seems barely expressed in the others.  -Yes, we KNOW by now that the series ended incomplete. --Might there be a reason why??  For the intelligent viewer, it is impossible to get past the SUPER HOLLYWOODED-NESS of this, making it extremely INAUTHENTIC.  For one, it seems they chose the actors exclusively for their stunning looks, then filming them in a visually lovely way to consistently show that off. ---This may be nice if you want to watch it in the dark with the sound off, spacing off dreaming of a more-perfect world. It has gorgeous people, horses, and scenes.
  But this was supposed to tell the story of a Horse Farm and family in a past century. . . and instead it is SO unrealistic and predictable that brighter viewers will be bored.  Some were upset by its moral decline.  If it had a better screenplay, maybe the shallow sensationalism wouldn't have needed resorting to to keep audience attention.  So, it Fails on ALL fronts:  Not clean enough for children, too squeaky-""perfect"" for nighttime soapy smut, AND too far off base in content to be good historical fiction.
 -A FEW good moments (especially Miss Rayne as Lexy), but not worth it if you have a brain.",1505692800,,1213,4.706161137440758
8565635,3,B00BC0JH24,WARNING SPOILERS  This was a wonderful series until the last five episodes when I think the writers must have lost their minds. At least I won't be sorry they cancelled it. But seriously up until the last five it was great!!! A good family oriented show. Could give 5 stars until the episode called Winter's Storm. After that a 2 star.,1503446400,2,335,4.491803278688525
