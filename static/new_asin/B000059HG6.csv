7933532,4,B000059HG6,"Ever since I learned of the Mike Douglas video set with John and Yoko, I wondered if other Douglas Shows with rock stars would be made available. My wondering has ceased with this release. What is a particular delight for me is that of all the Douglas shows I watched over the years, perhaps the most memorable is the subject of this review - the MD telecast in which Little Richard performed great renditions of ""The Girl Can't Help It"" and ""Slippin' and Slidin'"". Well, perhaps my memory has failed me - ""Slippin'"" is not contained on the tape. Anyway, Richard's workout on the '56 classic is more than worth the proverbial price of admission: it's a funky rock 'n soul re-arrangement which belongs in any TV-history time-capsule you can imagine. Plus, his interview segment provides some interesting commentary on the cultural crisis symbolized by the recent passing of his friend Jimi Hendrix. Richard explains that the world is in a *Spiritual* crisis. It's a very moving moment. For the Mike Douglas fans who are not into Rock history, we have his guest host, Mr. Lee Liberace, who performs two typically elaborate instrumentals and ofcourse discusses his wardrobe. Also along for the ride are his touring protege Faye McKay, and the president of Christian Dior Furs, Laurence Kaye, who presents a fashion show and reflects on the 1970 fashion industry. Yes, it's a low-key affair (with the exception of the [then-known-as] ""Bronze Liberace"" - Little Richard!), but it takes you back to a time in entertainment when confrontation and four-letter words were not needed to keep an audience.",982368000,,1594,4.951492537313433
