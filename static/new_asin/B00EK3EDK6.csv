5924115,5,B00EK3EDK6,"This movie is fantastic historical fiction.  I was lucky enough to participate in a live Q&A with director/producer,  Sam Kadi and was blown away by his honest and loving message in the movie and his interactions with the audience. He has reignited hope in the American dream and a loving and welcoming society. I have a renewed hope after experiencing this docudrama and meeting with Sam Kadi.

5924116,5,B00EK3EDK6,"I had never heard of actor Khaled Nabawy prior to watching ""The Citizen,"" but I now recommend him for at least a Golden Globe for his portrayal of immigrant Ibrahim in this wonderful film! Even if you believe 9/11 was a U.S. conspiracy, ""The Citizen"" is a powerful film that will make you value your citizenship in the U.S. and maybe think twice about how you look at the next immigrant you meet.",1381795200,5,396,4.438356164383562

5924118,5,B00EK3EDK6,"Watched this film on yesterday through Amazon Prime. Ironically, it was 9/11 and some of the events of that historic day were captured in this film.

The main characters were outstanding. The resolve and continued faith in man displayed by Ibrahim through the many challenges he faced in coming to the USA, particularly the day before the events of 9/11, was wonderful. The film delicately showcased the unity (and unfortunate hate) of people when they choose to believe in one another.

I hadn't heard of the film prior to watching it. I simply chose it because of the ratings received and the summary of its narrative. I'm glad I watched. Great film!",1473638400,3,652,4.8125

5924158,3,B00EK3EDK6,"Basic plot: Ibrahim Jarrah (played by an Egyptian actor) wins the green-card lottery to enter the US after 12 years of trying.  His luck has never been good so far in life.  He lands in NYC exactly ONE DAY before the events of 9/11/2000.  Looks like his luck didn't really change.  Hes arrested, detained and interrogated for some 8 months on suspicion that he may have been involved, before finally being released.  And then what?

This was largely filmed in Detroit (with the assist of some stock NYC footage) but nowhere can I find an explanation of who actually FUNDED the movie.  I think perhaps a clue appears in one of 6 listed awards: from the Abu Dhabi Film Festival.  Abu Dhabi is wealthy, and has extensive business connections with the US.  The messages in this film can be bulleted:
1.  Not every Muslim is a terrorist
2.  They believe in the same God Christians do.
3.  Many Muslims, as well as Asians, Africans and people from other countries around the world would
  love a chance to emigrate to the United States, not to blow people up but for the opportunity to
  build a better future for themselves and their families.

We have been considerably less welcoming since 9/11.  It is also a somewhat neglected fact as well, that if you break it down in that way, essentially all new job creation of the past 10 or 20 years (or longer) can be accounted for by businesses started by immigrants.  Thats all the way from a co-founder of Google to someone running a fruit stand in New York City.  People willing to leave their home land and emigrate to a strange country are on the average very energetic, optimistic and resourceful people.  They, not millionaires like [name omitted to protect the guilty] living off their interest payments, are the real job creatorsand we [along with many other countries] have been trying to shut them out.  You knowI get all that.  About halfway through the film I started getting a bit bored with where it was heading.  I hit the eject button at that point.  Maybe you can do better.  I give itI don't know, I guess I shouldnt give it any rating since I didn't finish.",1432512000,,2118,4.566489361702128

5924161,5,B00EK3EDK6,"Excellent, excellent film to share with the entire family.  If we ever hope to raise children who are free from prejudice and open to viewing the world from multiple perspectives, we must show them films such as this one as they are growing up.  How the main character Ibrihim was able to keep his optimistic faith in himself -- and America -- after all 'we the people' put him through is almost beyond me.  All I can say is that he must have genuinely had a personal relationship with God, because I doubt very few people could have made it through all of that without God's strength -- which makes it even more of an indictment against the INS prosecutor when Ibrihim accuses him of insinuating that the God of  'God-fearing Americans' is a better 'god' than the God Ibrihim worships.

Although I believe in Jesus Christ and the truth of all he taught, God can reach any individual who seeks Him regardless of religion or culture, so it regularly offends me when Christians arrogantly assume people of other faiths (especially Muslims) ipso facto have no genuine relationship with God.  I believe this movie illustrates precisely the opposite.",1426118400,3,1145,4.757575757575758

5924164,5,B00EK3EDK6,"After reading many of the reviews for this film, I definitely wanted to see it. I was not disappointed. A moving story of ill-fated timing and the backlash from a tragedy America will never forget. Nor will the thousands of immigrants who bore the brunt of profiling, just as Ibrahim did in this film. The acting was excellent and the cinematography captured the essence of the various points being made. This is a film I highly recommend, if only as a way to remind us of our responsibilities as human beings and to keep compassion in our lives.",1402358400,,546,4.581632653061225
5924165,5,B00EK3EDK6,I was frankly surprised I enjoyed this film as much as I did. This is a great movie to watch with your family and discuss afterward.,1399075200,,132,4.115384615384615
5924166,4,B00EK3EDK6,"""The Citizen"" (2012 release; 99 min.) brings the story of Ibrahim, originally from Lebanon, who after 12 years of trying out for the ""green card lottery"" actually wins and comes to the US, a legal immigrant. Alas, his bad fortune is to arrive in New York on September 10, 2001, yes the day before 9/11. Before we know it, he is detained, for reasons unclear, for 6 months, only to be released in March, 2002, for lack of evidence, But his troubles aren't over yet. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this movie is a lesson in civil rights and as such, right away a movie that deserves to be seen. Second, this is the debut feature of writer-director Sam Kadi, whom I speculate (I have no concrete evidence of this) is a first or second-generation immigrant himself. Third, the performance of Egyptian actor Khaled Nabawy as Ibrahim is powerful. Last but not least the ""green card lottery"" continues to this day, providing those lucky winners the opportunity to come to the US and make the American dream a reality. The DVD bonus materials come with a bunch of interviews, the most interesting of them being with writer-director Kadi, explaining that the story is based on various real life stories, but for movie purposes, he bundled them into the Ibrahim character.

As a legal immigrant myself some 30 years ago (albeit not because of the ""green card lottery""), this movie really resonated for me. This country was made great by legal immigrants, in fact many Americans in one way or another descend from the early settlers, and this country continues to be made great by legal immigrants, the very fabric of our nation. All hail legal immigrants! ""The Citizen"" is definitely worth checking out.",1397347200,5,1803,4.757188498402556
5924167,5,B00EK3EDK6,"This movie sparks a lot of questions about the value system of the United States of America.

5924168,5,B00EK3EDK6,"As America continues to grow, we all need to watch this movie. I try not to judge people against any thing and in fulfilling a Christian lifestyle, this really woke me up to the racial differences of all mankind.",1395446400,2,212,4.461538461538462

5924174,5,B00EK3EDK6,"I had been waiting to see this movie. It premiered all over the country, and I kept missing the premiers, so when I found it was finally on Amazon, I just could not wait to see it.

Some reviewers are upset that the movie ended in the way that it did, that it was ""romantic"" in a sense. However, I think that all of the moods and tones were properly utilized. When you think of home, when you think of belonging to a place, it can be romantic. It should evoke nostalgia, and no one can help but fall in love with Ibrahim. The character is not made up; he merely represented much of the sentiments that so many immigrants share when they come to this country. They believe, that somehow, it will be better, and it can be in so many ways. Nevertheless, it also showed what one has to give up to be here.

Whether viewers like it or not, the movie was real life. I have many immigrant friends, and this movie exhibits many of things they go through. To the reviewer that felt the movie was not political or controversial enough, you totally missed the point.",1387584000,4,1055,4.27

Just learning the language and negotiating basic every day life is a difficult transition. Like many immigrants they got down to business and did what they needed to do. I can attest to the hard work and diligence it too for them to succeed. I think this movie is a good example of the struggles many immigrants face. The characters are well developed and represent the script well. I must admit that the storydoes have a Cinderella quality about it. Not all cases of deportation turn out so well. Nor is victory so easily won. (our hero did not face many the terrible situations that a lot of immigrants do. However, the story is inspiring and hopefully will get some people to thinking about we all (except for native Americans) got to be citizens.  It may seem trivial, but I'm giving a whole point off for the sappy music that is the background for a lot of this movie.  It's the same awful stuff played in most Hallmark presentations.
