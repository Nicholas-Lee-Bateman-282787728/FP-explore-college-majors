625650,5,6303316042,"Great series of DVDs! I love detective series and this one is excellent. Along with the wonderful detective stories it takes place in medieval times several years after the Crusades. Brother Cadfael, pronounced Cadfile, is played by a superb actor, Sir Derek Jacobi. Some may know him from the series ""I, Claudius"", or the movie ""Dead Again"" or any number of other roles.

Cadfael is a monk in an order in the village of Shrewsbury. The mysteries he encounters involve murder or mayhem over inheritance, love, jealousy, and property. Often there are interesting characters that seem involved with the case that are but not in the way we suspect. The sheriff Hugh Beringar, played by Sean Pertwee in this set does an exceptional job as well and is often helpful to Cadfael in pursueing the cases.

The stories in this set involves a variety of mysteries that Cadfael unravels with the assistance from a gamut of people of the times. Cadfael has led and interesting life which we get a peek at with each episode. Even if he was just a monk that cares for the ill using herbs from his garden it would be enough, but there is much more to him. It was hard not to sit through a marathon of watching the set because they are so engrossing. I had not seen any of this series until I bought this set on a whim. After seeing it I immediately ordered the next three sets.

The set is excellent and includes Bios, Background on stories, and much more. The picture and sound quality are first class. I highly recommend buying this set. Fans of movies like ""The Name of the Rose"" or BBC series like ""Sherlock Holmes"" with Jeremy Brett, or even TV series like ""CSI"" will probably enjoy it.",1073952000,34,1675,4.539735099337748
625651,5,6303316042,"I has seen all the movies up to the fourth series, and have read all the books from Ellis Peters (the Cadfael author) that my library has.  This series is as true to those mystery books as possible with their budget, and  the result is stunning.  They combine action, romance, sublety, and a  medieval setting as true as the health department will allow.  The movies  maintain a true feel for the era, the mental mindset, and the  suspicions/beliefs of the times.  Derek Jacobi's skill as an actor are what  brings Cadfael to life, and he hold nothing back in excellent after  excellent episode.  In only one episode have I been able to figure  out the ending before all the clues are pieced together.  My only criticism  (and it is very minor) is that the actors who portray Hugh Berringer have  changed several times.  All have been very good in the role, but the first  should have stayed.  All in all, this series is well worth the expense,  and is a real treat for the mystery movie lover (and historical period  buff, the recreationists, the, well everybody I know anyway)",924307200,38,1078,4.603174603174603
625712,5,6303316042,"Love them.  I'm a Derek Jacobi fan to begin with and love British films, especially mysteries.  The books were recommended to me by others who love this genre and I was excited to find they had been portrayed on film.  The old English only adds to the fun but it is not overdone.

mysteries excellent, just the thing for a winter evening by the fire. Lovers of either history or mystery will find these

625714,5,6303316042,My favorite TV shows are forensic in nature such as CSI.  This series is about a Medieval monk who solves crimes using forensic processes.  Derek Jacobi is superb in historical dramas.,1366675200,,184,4.903225806451613

625718,5,6303316042,"If you love murder mysteries, this is for you! I have always been fascinated by the Medieval period, and this film combines the best of both. Derek Jacobi is superb in his role as monk/investigator. The series was filmed in an area of Hungary that had no telephone lines in order to keep the sets as realistic as possible. Great stories about the travails of human nature.",1305590400,,372,4.567164179104478
625719,5,6303316042,"Brother Cadfael is not the sort of person you would immediately peg as a brilliant detective -- a crusader-turned-monk who specializes in herbology and medicine.

But he is a brilliant detective. And ""Brother Cadfael, Set 1 (One Corpse Too Many / The Sanctuary Sparrow / The Leper of St. Giles / Monk's Hood)"" brings the first four adaptation of Ellis Peters' classic mysteries, which intertwine murder mysteries and medieval history. These stories are well-written, clever and full of unexpected twists -- and they're filmed with a gritty, grimy realistic flavor.

Cadfael finds ""A Corpse Too Many"" after a mass execution by King Stephen -- there's a strangled corpse slipped in among the executed, but the authorities don't seem to care much. As he works with the new sheriff Hugh Beringer, the canny monk cares for a wounded man, uncovers a young monk's secret and a love triangle turned deadly.

Then Shrewsbury Abbey ends up with a ""Sanctuary Sparrow"" when a traveling acrobat is kicked out of the Aurifaber wedding reception, unpaid for his work. But when the master of the house is found clubbed and robbed, a mob chases the young man into the nearest church, where he claims sanctuary. Now Cadfael must unravel the complex troubles of the Aurifaber household, and figure out who there has a motive to kill...

And in ""The Leper of St. Giles,"" a young heiress is brought to the abbey to marry the cruel Baron Huon de Domville... only, of course, he ends up dead as a doornail. The main suspect is a young squire desperately in love with the girl, but of course Cadfael doesn't think he did it -- and he needs to figure out whayt's going on with the treacherous Picard family before the wrong man is executed.

Finally, Cadfael is shocked when his ex-fiancee Richildis appears at the abbey... along with her nasty husband Gervase, who has spited his step-son by deciding to will all his considerable property to the abbey. Then Gervase is poisoned with monk's hood (aka aconite or wolfsbane) from Cadfael's own store. Obviously the stepson is accused of the murder, but Cadfael doesn't believe he did it -- and he has to prove it, for Richildis' sake.

""Cadfael: The Complete Collection"" is the sort of authentic historical series that the BBC has sadly stopped making -- it has all the blood, grime and sweat of the 12th century, and accurately depicts the strong presence of religion and politicial strife in medieval life.

For the most part, the writers accurately adapt Peters' novels -- every mystery has lots of suspects, moral dilemmas, religious strife, civil war, a murder that only Cadfael can solve, and a bit of cute romance as well. And since the series is set long before forensic science was created, it's fun to see Cadfael scout for tiny clues and patch them together into a case.

But Derek Jacobi is absolutely pitch-perfect as Cadfael -- his solid performance is kindly, wise, paternal, and a little humorous at times, especially as a monk who's seen more of the real world than most of his brothers (he was even a ladies' man!). Jacobi does an especially good job in ""Monk's Hood,"" where we see Cadfael's lingering affection for his ex, as well as his feelings of obligation to her.

There are also great performances by Terrence Hardiman as the kind but stern Abbot Radulfus, Julian Firth as the fussy Brother Jerome, and Michael Culver as the haughty snob Prior Robert. And Sean Pertwee is the best of the three Hugh Beringer actors -- he's a strong decisive man who trusts in the ""rare Benedictine's"" wisdom.

""Brother Cadfael, Set 1"" brings together an entertaining first season of mysteries, set against a medieval backdrop of war, love and murder.",1281398400,,3681,4.819334389857369
625720,3,6303316042,The Cadfael stories are interesting and Derek Jacoby is very good as Cadfael but the setting and time period seem very depressing.  The whole atmosphere is kind of gloomy and the music adds to this.  I wouldn't want to have lived in that era.  One Corpse Too Many was too violent for my taste but overall I enjoyed these mysteries.,1274918400,3,331,4.483333333333333
625721,3,6303316042,"As with ""One Corpse Too Many"" I love the story, but the quality of the video is lacking.  In this case the last bit of the video is missing; it ends with High asking Cadfael a question, Cadfael opens his mouth to answer, and the video stops.

Amazon needs to improve its QA.",1249862400,,274,4.150943396226415

7843640,4,6303316042,"Two of my small pleasures in life have been the knowledge that I have not yet read all of Ellis Peters' Brother Cadfael books nor watched all of the episodes of the BBC Brother Cadfael series.  I will soon no longer be able to enjoy the second.  The Cadfael series comes with my BritBox subscription so I will soon have watched them all.

Series 1 begins with One Corpse Too Many, a clever mystery and some interesting history concerning the English civil war known as The Anarchy.  All of the episodes are better than average television but all are not necessarily good history which bothers me in a period piece such as this.  For instance in the episode titled The Leper of St. Giles, much is made of the fact that a girl is being forced into a marriage against her will.  This was both legal and common in Medieval England.  Few if any men in power would care what the girl wanted.  Little things such as this make it four stars instead of five.",1509062400,,949,4.382857142857143
7843641,5,6303316042,"One Corpse Too Many

We deal with what is

As complex as any of the Cadfael series, this one tells the story of how Master Hugh Beringar becomes sheriff. Also as Cadfael states, ""By my reckoning there is one corps too many.""
From the back Jacket:
When a Novice Monk arrives at Shrewsbury Abbey and turns out to be a young girl in disguise, Cadfael decides she is in need of a friend. But when he discovers his Novice's true identity, Cadfael finds himself caught in the Crossfire of the Civil war between King Stephen and the Empress Maud.
He is called upon to bury 94 rebel soldiers executed on the King's orders after the fall of Shrewsbury Castle. But when Cadfael counts up the dead bodies and finds one corps too many, it sets him on a murder trail. His investigations lead him to suspect the shadowy Hugh Beringar - a man who appears to have recently pledged his allegiance to King Steven...
This time will Cadfaels tuition, forensics, and logic. Prove the case?

The Sanctuary Sparrow

Under the certainty of Heaven nothing is certain.

This is film is part of:
Brother Cadfael Series 1 Box Set: ""The Sanctuary Sparrow, One Corpse Too Many, Monk's Hood and The Leper of St. Giles"" (1995)
From the back cover: When the town's goldsmith is robbed and left for dead, the finger of suspicion is pointed at young juggler who was performing at the wedding feast of the goldsmith's son.

Pursued by the mob, the young entertainer stumbles through the town to the Abby where he seeks the sanctuary of the Alter. Cadfael is given the job of keeping an eye on the youngster while the authorities investigate. But his discrete inquiries are cut short when the goldsmith's neighbor is found dead floating in the river...

Once again the box does not convey the complexity or the beauty in the film as father Cadfael along with my favorite Hugh Beringar (Sean Pertwee) search for truth and justice using forensics, intuition and logic.

7843642,4,6303316042,"I love this series and had hoped to watch it again on Amazon. I find it listed, BUT it appears to be unavailable. No information as to whether this is a temporary or permanent situation, just that it is unavailable.  Why would Amazon continue to show this if one cannot watch or rent or buy any of this series?  I am very disappointed in Amazon and very disappointed that I cannot stream this program.  Take it down if it is not available.

IF this series should become available again, I do highly recommend this series. While it is a bit simple and predictable, it goes a long way to help viewers envision life and politics of the period. For me, it helped me understand a little more about the conflict between Maude and Steven's claims to the throne and how the public could get caught up in the wars. It by no means serves as a worthy substitute for a well delivered history class, but it did help me see it in a whole new point of view. I understand a bit more about the history of that period, the history of the church of that time and how life might have existed for so many of that time, even in light of the literary license one can expect.

Also, the stories were interesting for both the mysteries and the historical background. After Season 1, the series became much more violent and bloody (it is the Middle Ages, after all), and the chemistry between the leads just didn't seem the same.",1421107200,,428,4.797297297297297
