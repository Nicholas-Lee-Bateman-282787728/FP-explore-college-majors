6919049,5,B00R8O809O,We have received. Thank you.,1431475200,,28,4.8
6919050,5,B00R8O809O,"Also known as Like Father Like Son, Massacre Mafia Style is in the same league as the Godfather, Goodfellas and Scarface. James Cagney and Edward G. Robinson would marvel at Duke Mitchell's acting chops. And the hair chops make Elvis green in the grave with envy. Duke Mitchell plays Mimi Miceli who wrote, directed and stars in this hair raising mobster movie that you must see to believe! Im so thankful for the recent Grindhouse Blu-ray release. Thank you, thank you, thank you.",1430697600,,481,4.807228915662651
6919051,5,B00R8O809O,Best movie about organized crime ever! Better than The Godfather!,1429488000,,65,5.6
6919052,5,B00R8O809O,"Grindhouse releasing packed this disc with great extras, including Duke Mitchells first movie role in Bella Lugosi meets a Brooklyn Gorilla and several notable features. They did a great transfer of the film as well.
 The film itself is actually really good. I expected to sit through a really goofy home made movie but I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the movie. Duke Mitchell is great as the lead role his speeches do start to get long winded and mess with the flow of the film, and while all the supporting cast are sort of lacking in their acting ability they all have real moments that showcase potential, especially Duke Mitchells best friend and girlfriend in the film. The film is also edited a bit weird and that also messes with the flow of the film, but even with that Massacre Mafia Style is the best home made mafia film.",1429056000,,846,4.565789473684211
6919053,3,B00R8O809O,I thought I would like it a lot more than I did. A lot of hard to explain stuff happens but this seems to be a movie it is better to watch as a group so you have someone to share the film with and exclaim when the next weird thing happens.,1428192000,,239,3.6153846153846154
6919054,5,B00R8O809O,very good action and late night skinemax,1427500800,,40,4.857142857142857
6919055,5,B00R8O809O,"This would be my number one current favorite exploitation release if Gone With The Pope had not been released right afterwards.  This movie starts with the violent action (which is later recounted a couple of times at lesser lengths) and then backs up to the beginning showing Duke Mitchell's character leaving his father vowing to take over from the pimps and bookies.  After an unorthodox way of getting close to the top mob boss, he proceeds with another massacre which gets him and his friends a secret thumbs down from the mobsters.  Will Duke survive the mob's plans for his demise?  In one of the extras a friend of his talks about how he preferred this movie over The Godfather, which obviously inspired it, in that this movie is full of uexpected twists.  In another revelation in the extras, we find out from Duke's son that the scene where they tie some guy in a wheelchair up to a toilet, rig him up with a wire, and plug one end into a socket was completely real!  Duke didn't like the guy, and they did this to teach him a lesson!  Why the guy didn't sue them is beyond belief, but this was a very different time ... In the movie the scene makes almost no sense, in the context in which it's shown.  Great job, Grindhouse Releasing!  This is a wild film, and could be teamed with the Dolemite movies (Rudy Ray Moore) for a completely unpolitically correct evening.  Just try to get that catchy tune out of your head, too.  My head is still going ""round and round!""",1427414400,,1478,4.4572490706319705
6919056,5,B00R8O809O,A must have for fans of the Mafia genre of film and people who dig Grindhouse movies. Duke Mitchell is a God and this classic needs to be watched over and over again for true appreciation.,1427155200,,188,4.25
6919057,5,B00R8O809O,From beginning to end this movie is ridiculous. I give it eleven thumbs up.,1426377600,2,75,4.428571428571429
6919058,5,B00R8O809O,"I am giving 5 stars to the product and 4 stars to the film. An amazing product by Grindhouse Releasing. The movie itself is a great throwback to the gritty grindhouse days of cinema, violence, gore and downright awesomeness. A wonderful example of a flawless product.",1426204800,2,267,4.826086956521739
8694607,1,B00R8O809O,"Not so bad it's good but just plain BORING. Wishes it was the Godfather but fails miserably.

If you watch the extra documentary his son Jeffrey threw together you see what a real jerk Duke was. His son relates dozens of stories about his dad being a jerk to everyone (including his son) and of what a giant racist he was. This documentary really made me dislike Duke and Jeffrey (who was a spoiled little brat and now a pompous fat bald old man).

Save your $ this movie sucks and so do the extras. Don't believe the hype.",1501977600,,523,4.2727272727272725
8694608,5,B00R8O809O,"Painfully racist and pseudo profound b movie with long cloying speeches and a despicable central character. Why do I give it five stars? Well in spite of what I just said, there is something irresistibly energetic, charming, and fun about this campy bloodbath of a grindhouse mob movie. It is frankly impossible that Tarantino wasn't influenced by this. Misguided, ridiculous, absurdly violent and somehow just...fun. Faggedabaddit.",1501632000,,432,5.5606060606060606
8694609,3,B00R8O809O,"I wanted to enjoy this more but outside of the crazy DIY look and self indulgence the movie isn't quite as special as one would hope. It is however strangely focused despite being completely haphazard and filled with bizarre soap opera romantic digressions and long winded political monologues. It's certainly focused by the standard of the sprawling and bizarre Gone With The Pope by the same director / vanity project king.

I'm being kind of hard on it but it has a certain charm. For people into this sort of thing, it's solid comfort food. I had fun. It's just not as special as I would hope. It did however have a fantastic use of weaponized bread.",1499299200,,654,4.589743589743589

8694611,5,B00R8O809O,"This is one of those films that touches places in your heart that have very little to do with quality or cinematic prowess. This movie made me want to be living back in the 70s near a grind house in times square. It reminded me of my father's dopy friends with names like dig dig and Nicky D. It was so much fun hearing those classic Italian wedding songs and watching these guys posture in a way that just makes me miss the hell out of an era and a faction of wanna be gangsters that have all the swagger and none of the violence in their hearts. Yes it's violent, no it doesn't make much sense but hell I am going to watch it over and over just for that feeling I had living in NYC in the most decadent time in history. God bless Duke Mitchell and if you were born in the 50's or 60's buy this film. Hell if you want to know what it was like back in the 70's this is your ticket.",1465689600,,881,3.9273743016759775
8694612,1,B00R8O809O,Seems like I cannot pick a good movie any more big stinker,1461024000,,58,3.9166666666666665
8694613,5,B00R8O809O,It's like a cheap proto-Goodfellas made by 14 year olds that really love movies. Hilarious and racist and full of overly dramatic monologues and a mix of both well executed AND terrible gunplay. A definite treat for a group watch. I can't wait to show this to friends.,1447977600,,268,4.604166666666667
8694614,5,B00R8O809O,"This film is RAW, GRITTY, TARANTINO-esque and VERY 1970's !!!!!!!!!!!!! A film with balls and a one that will stand the test of time !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The acting of the extras is so bad in this one...that it actually adds appeal to the film.  What Django (1966) is to Spaghetti Westerns...that is what Massacre Mafia Style (1974) also known under alternative title as-- Like Father, Like Son...is to mafia films.

Duke Mitchell directed and started in this mafia-exploitation flick, and he also composed the theme song, which can be heard at end of the film.
The film is roughly about Mimi Miceli (Mitchell) who travels from Sicily to Los Angeles (Hollywood) to avenge his disgraced father who has been deported from the USA back to Italy many years ago.  He sets out to find a childhood friend he once knew when he lived in the States with his father.  The man he is looking for also happened to be the son of the enforcer who worked for Mimi's father.  He finds him working in one of the LA bars, and the two men quickly reunite and began to change things around the Hollywood area...but not without making enemies...

Massacre Mafia style is an Italian mafia film along the lines of Fernando di Leo's films, such as: The Italian Connection (1972), Caliber 9 (1972), The Boss (1973) or Rulers of the City (1976).",1445644800,,1313,4.658008658008658
8694615,5,B00R8O809O,"Grindhouse Releasing has always been reliable. This is an outfit that doesn't put out a lot of product, but make sure that what they do release is packed with value and has as good a picture and sound as possible. As for the film itself, it's surprisingly entertaining. It was obviously a labor of love for Mitchell. It's rough around the edges, to be sure, but is still a far-better film that many mainstream studio pictures. The inclusion of the mind-blowingly cheesy Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla is just icing on the cannoli.",1439078400,,536,4.712765957446808
8694616,2,B00R8O809O,"I was somewhat disappointed with this title. The movie itself is ok, not great. I would give it 2.5 stars if I could. Too slow, not as good as the cover art.",1435190400,,157,3.9375
