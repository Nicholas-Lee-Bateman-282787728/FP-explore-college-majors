The only trouble is that it has the region code 1, which is good for United States, whereas I am living in Europe, hence I cannot play it. It is useless to me. When I make an order from Europe I take it for granted that you warn me that what you want to sell to me does not work in Europe. No indication of region code was presented until I already had placed my order. Shame on Amazon.

8505709,2,B006WN5UN6,"I read a book on his life---the question that haunts everyone is why he went back to that cesspool of Stalinist Russia after living in Paris. That said we have here a typical example of a pedestrian life coupled with perhaps the most extraoridnary musical talent of the 20th century--an odd paradox. But, truly, never look into the pedestrian life of greatness.

In the 20th Century I think that only the Harris 3rd, and the fifth and wonderful 10th of Shostakovich approach Prokofiev's Sixth. The first violin concerto is magificent--of course Romeo, etc. The world within dwarfs the world without-- simple matter of fact.

I do not think these documentaries are done very well-- another one on Schubert and Rachmanioff were extremely poor--and this homosexual obsessive bashing of Tchaikovsky is not only in bad taste but is a getting out of hand as an irrelevant distracting issue.

Their music is paramount. Affectations, illusions or bad habits are secondary,more like psychological and material subsistence.",1338681600,5,1013,5.2024539877300615
