8084875,4,B000BBSA28,"Inspiring photography will make you want to cast off your anchor to shore right now. This series is definitely built around the ocean crossing cruiser and not the weekend coastal sailor, yet it delivers excellent information on sailing techniques, equipment and destinations. Keep in mind that these videos were shot for TV. Just be sure you can play the Region Number that these are produced for. While very entertaining and delivering good information, I found these programs occasionally a bit unnecessarily ""cheesy.""",1477267200,,520,5.353658536585366

4  shows on being out to sea on sail boat with Bob Bitchin and his crew.",1377475200,,106,4.0476190476190474
8084877,4,B000BBSA28,"Who am I? I lived aboard a sailboat for 15 years, so let me say right here, these folks are the real deal.

Having said that, okay, I admit I'm disappointed. The raison d'etre of Lats and Atts was getting out there and doing it. And they do. My problem is with the boat reviews. These folks are schizo. One minute boat bum, the next Cruising World. Still and all it's a pretty cool show. It has a real down home feel to it. While they review gold-plated yachts, they sail with others who are just like you and me - average people living the dream.

Buy this and enjoy, get motivated, then, darnit, go sailing!",1329350400,,609,4.241379310344827
