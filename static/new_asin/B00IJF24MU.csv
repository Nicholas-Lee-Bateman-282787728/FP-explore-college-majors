8642546,3,B00IJF24MU,"French language movie with English subtitles. Goal of the Dead is a low budget looking zombie outbreak movie, where the outbreak occurs after a local small team's best soccer player is given his regular steroid injection, but unbeknownst to him it's been contaminated by something that when the needle drips the liquid melts the table.  The player quickly transforms into a roid rage like we've never seen before.  He runs off into the country side in search of the team bus with the yet to arrive in town Paris team opposition player he has been told to ""kill"" on the field. That guy was the star player of the small French town team 17 years ago, who left mid season to sign onto a higher up the minor professional French ranks bigger league club in Paris.  When he left, the local team failed to win their local division, which meant their team didn't get automatic selection into a better more financially lucrative league. The failures of businesses and everything in the small town are blamed on this, as they call it betrayal.  The town definitely holds a grudge,  Not to mention while he was playing there, the player slept with all the town's hot females taking their virginity, which angered their fathers, brothers and all the guys who missed out on it being them.

The actual ""zombie"" stuff is pretty mild.  Basically the virus is spread by vomiting on an unaffected person, while you who have been infected in an uncontrollable rage are attacking them and they're holding you back.  This is done with the old hidden hose up the side of the person not seen on the side being filmed and a white liquid spraying out the hose onto the victim's face technique.  It's sort of amusing the first time but gets old real fast.  There's a few good scenes of violence, but really most of it is just a crowd of people out of control banging on metal roller doors and stuff like this.  Basically it's representing soccer hooligans taking it to a new level.  There's also a player manager that only cares about the player that can make him money surviving, and a few soccer related things like this. There's a female reporter travelling with the team who gets walked over by the players and officials.  None of the characters are particularly likable.

The idea of the film seems a lot more fun that it actually is.",1499558400,,2313,4.609756097560975

8642549,5,B00IJF24MU,"This is a smart zombie film that provides a clever story line with several subplots. Paris is playing Caplongue in soccer/football. Idriss is the 12 year phenom on the team and interest of the media. Sam, the eldest player on the team, is the real story. He is from Caplongue and the town has never forgiven him for leaving and playing for Paris, especially when it cost the town the French Cup.

Jeannot is the leader of Caplongue and takes a serum that makes him more aggressive. The zombie aspect is soon obtained and the film is into full swing. The disease is transmitted by contact with body fluids, primarily by gross power puking.

The film is a light comedy. Idriss, while being interviewed by the press talks about his great role model, but due to sponsorship can't name him. Zombies are crudely taunted as football fans. Korean football players are chastised because they have been in the country for 2 months and can't speak French.  The coach's final locker room speech had me laughing out loud as he describes the use of team work to combat zombies.

Good slow motion blood splatter too.

I watched the film with English subtitles. Would love to get a DVD in English.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex. Adult themes. Brief male rear nudity.",1406160000,3,1252,4.668181818181818
