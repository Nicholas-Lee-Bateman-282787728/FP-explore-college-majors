2553804,1,B000F6ZIJC,"Thankfully, I read the reviews of this video before buying it.  We checked it out from the library instead.  At least it was free.  The sound and picture quality is awful, and Laurie Berkner really needed top billing over the other two groups who are not even close to her in talent.",1168300800,4,283,4.403846153846154
2553805,3,B000F6ZIJC,"The video could be better...sound quality, camera angles.  Overall, we enjoyed all of the acts though...a great spectrum of the talent out there to help teach and entertain kids and adults.  Too bad so many people didn't enjoy the Ohmies.  I suggest people check out the Ohmies' ""Surprise the Sun"" DVD or, better yet, go see their complete live show if you're in the LA area...FANTASTIC!  Penny's voice can be a little annoying at times, but the others in the cast make up for it!",1168041600,2,480,4.6117647058823525
2553806,2,B000F6ZIJC,Well...We love Laurie Berkner and Milkshake is great too....but the Ohmies really ruin the dvd. I fast forward over their performances. The sound quality is not great either. Seems to be amatur-ish. Laurie's dvd is so much better!!,1167868800,5,231,5.105263157894737
2553807,2,B000F6ZIJC,"Poor audio.  Performances were unispired.  Milkshake does a credible job, Laurie Berkner seems to mail it in, and the only reason to watch the Ohmies is a out of shear Schadenfreude.",1167782400,4,182,4.838709677419355
2553808,1,B000F6ZIJC,I purchased this DVD because my daugter loves The Laurie Berkner Band. I could only stand about 5 minutes of dvd until I had to forward it. My daughter wasn't interested in watching it at all. The quality of the video wasn't the greatest. All in all I was really disappointed in this DVD. If only I had checked out the reviews. DON'T BUY THIS DVD! If you want some great children's videos check out The Laurie Berkner Band and Dan Zanes and Friends.,1167436800,3,449,4.357142857142857
2553809,1,B000F6ZIJC,I would have given this no stars but they made me pick at least one.  I can't believe I paid $15.00 for this DVD.  I bought this because my daughter loves Laurie Berkner.  The quality is just horrible.  And Laurie only plays two songs.  Are you kidding me?  The Ohmies are as annoying as can be with that high-pitched girl squealing between acts!!!! How did they get the majority of time on stage?,1164585600,11,397,4.36986301369863
2553810,1,B000F6ZIJC,"Awful!  The quality of sound is super bad and the songs are unknown by my daughter (who know tons of songs and sings along).  We didn't like the Ohmies at all!!  Hadn't heard of them before and certainly won't be spending time with their squeekiness again.  We barely made it through the video one time and I tossed it. It certainly didn't pass my rule that mommy must enjoy the video, too.  If you want enjoyable sing-alongs for children (and the adults that are subject to them, too) choose Laurie Berkner or Raffi or even Dan Zanes for a change of flavor.  We have yet to get sick of those awesome musical DVDs!",1163116800,12,614,4.389380530973451
2553811,1,B000F6ZIJC,We bought this because my daughter absolutely loved her Laurie Berkner DVD. We only made it throught 10 minutes of Jamarama. The sound quality is terrible and my 3 year old kept asking when the video was going to start because the camera work doesn't bring the viewer into the event at all. This is a waste of money. I actually can't understand how anyone thought children would enjoy this.,1160524800,17,390,4.585714285714285
2553812,2,B000F6ZIJC,"Recently I received my long awaited copy of ""Jamarama - Live"", what a rip off! Much can be said about the amateurish production of the DVD. Despite the fact it was a live event, focusing and tracking for this DVD seems to have been a lost art.

Yet, the worst part of this recording is hype used to promote DVD. Laurie Berkner who by the time of the issuance of this recording was an established star of the pre-school set was  presented as the principal artist. Well if principal artist means doing two songs which she  had better recorded on her own much heralded DVD then ok. The rest of tracks and their attendant artist can best be summed up with one word, boring.

I won't belabor my criticism of this DVD. I'll end by saying save your money.",1158451200,33,748,4.359712230215828

8118478,1,B000F6ZIJC,"Not what I expected, not made very well.",1425513600,,40,4.125
8118479,4,B000F6ZIJC,"I personally dislike this DVD. We only use it in the car, so it's more like a cd to me as I haven't watched most of it, just listened to it a million times, and the music, other than Laurie B., is so out of tune it makes me cringe. But, my kids (3 and 5) LOVE it. It literally has saved me on several 10+ hour car trips. I'll pull this out when nothing else will keep them entertained and they will watch and sing along over and over, happily. Every long car trip and they ask me to pull out this DVD, more than movies, or TV shows or any other DVD we own. So, for that, I give it four stars.",1321920000,,592,3.782258064516129
8118480,4,B000F6ZIJC,"i knew what i was buying, as i saw it with my cousine and my doughter loved the Dinousrs song, so i got it for her, good dvd for kids :-)",1316563200,,137,3.4516129032258065
8118481,3,B000F6ZIJC,I may have misread the ad but I thought this was a full dvd of Laurie Berkner. The seller was very easy to deal with and it was really my own mistake of not reading more of what the dvd was about.,1265760000,,196,3.6904761904761907
8118482,2,B000F6ZIJC,"I bought this dvd, like many other parents because I thought The Laurie Berkner Band and Milkshake were headlining. Instead we get mostly The Ohmies: saccarin-sweet boring music. My child left the room after about 5 minutes into it. There's a reason I've never seen this band on Noggin-they're terrible! I agree with many other reviewers that the sound quality was not great and there were only maybe 2 songs of Laurie and 3 of Milkshake. If this show were playing close by I would never go to see it. Save your money and get Jack's Big Music show on DVD or We are the Laurie Berkner Band.",1246838400,,589,4.462962962962963
8118483,2,B000F6ZIJC,"My toddler is not very interested in this. He loves music by the individual bands, but this DVD has the same songs that are on their individual DVDs, so not worth the money.",1216339200,,173,4.2727272727272725
8118484,5,B000F6ZIJC,"I bought this for my daughter when she was about 10 months old.  She always saw the previews for it on Cartoon Network and would stop dead in her tracks when she heard it come on and just dance.  She is now 15 months old and when she gets fussy or is tired and needs a ""time out"" from playing I pop this in and she is mesmerized.  She loves all the songs and dances along with all the bands... If your little one loves music this is the perfect DVD!!",1178064000,3,450,3.923076923076923
8118485,1,B000F6ZIJC,"We bought this CD because we love The Laurie Berkner band but I was VERY disappointed.  My 3 year old who loves the We Are The Laurie Berkner Band was very excited when we ordered this CD.  We were both VERY disappointed!  I allow her to watch the 2 DVD's only when I am walking on the tredmill in the same room as the TV (only time she watches any TV) but I have to say that I can not stand this DVD.  My 3 year old is glued to We are the Laurie Berkner Band but as soon as this CD came on she was up off the couch and ready for me to be finished.  We now skip right to Laurie and watch her 2 songs and then turn it off.  I have to say, if I was Laurie Berkner I would nopt allow whoever did this video to use the name to promote such a piece of crap!",1175299200,9,752,3.639751552795031
8118486,2,B000F6ZIJC,"When I first watched this DVD, I couldn't believe that they actually went ahead with selling it after hearing the poor sound quality from the live recording. Laurie Berkner is the only one who sings in tune, so it is very difficult for the adults to get through it. However, I have to give it a few stars since it is the only DVD that I play where my son will sit through the entire thing, even if I leave the room!",1171324800,3,415,4.073170731707317
