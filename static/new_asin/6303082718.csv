7836868,3,6303082718,"Well its been said that things happen. Thats ever so true in this futuristic time travel thriller. From the moment when it appears that your entire world may have been destroyed by some error in judgement , to the  journey into Time to solve the paradox that will fix this situation. Not to  forget the Love interest.... How to deal with the Paradox versions of Loved  Ones in the other world? I found this to be a somewhat sad and slightly  Haunting movie. I enjoyed it and will watch it many times. The Effects  aren't all that great but the story line is quite good.",929404800,6,569,4.380952380952381
