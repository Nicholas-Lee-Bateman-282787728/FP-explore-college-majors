7309200,1,B010E1H2CS,I didn't laugh until he was putting the desk together for his buddy. Their relationship was the best part of the movie but the rest didn't work. Her character was not one I ever warmed up to and her confession was so cheesy! Her entire role felt so forced and I never really bought into the premise. Really disappointed by this movie.,1438214400,3,334,4.403225806451613

7309207,5,B010E1H2CS,"I thought it was a very well scripted movie, with a happy ending. Not at all what you expect from the title.",1529798400,,108,3.9545454545454546
7309208,3,B010E1H2CS,"The problem in Hollywood these days seems to be better actors than writers.  This movie is a fine example.
All of the actors are good, showed up on set and did their jobs, even the direction and editing was good work.
However, the story is such a rehash of all the ""hooker with a heart of gold"" plots that you know what is going to happen in the first ten minutes.
There are several good documentaries on the reality of the sex industry out there that these tired, overdone, stock characters, plots, and lines, make an Ester Williams musical seems like M. Night Shyamalan.  Even the Milinieal characters have devolved into stereotypes.
Mentioning ""Pretty Woman"" is always a bad move as it reminds your viewers that there are better movies out there that they should be watching rather than your poor effort.

As I said, all the actors did very well with what they were given.  They were just not handed anything you have not seen before, and that is too bad.",1529712000,,958,4.5523255813953485

7309227,5,B010E1H2CS,"The people who expected this film to be seedy are influenced, I think, by the image of Lyndsy Fonseca's unzipped dress. She's obviously a hooker, right? Well, she is. But the drama is actually pretty clean - not a lot racier than, say, 'Pretty Woman.'

I enjoyed the heck our of watching Bruce Campbell play Michael Doneger's dad. And I hope there are more scripts coming from Doneger. He is talented (and cute, and athletic, and smart, yadda, yadda).

Above all, I think this film is a love letter to L.A. from an East Coast kid. Sunlight, color, space, green, and a total lack of the historic neighborhood you can see lurking in movies shot in almost any Eastern metropolis location. It's refreshing, bright - like a citrus (without the Florida citrus humidity!)",1526860800,,764,4.7368421052631575

7309229,3,B010E1H2CS,"Surprising ok movie!  Good cast choices.  I have watched it several times.  Downside is it promotes use of cannabis, girl playing football to keep a boyfriend, escorting is justified because of large college debt, violence against others because you disagree with their life style, virtue signaling that being liberal is superior to conservative.  The writers use the low hanging fruit airhead pot smoking father character of Hollywood who became rich from music but that was 'cool'.  The sex addiction intervention with his little sister as one of the people confronting him was inappropriate plus making humor of sex app was awkward attempt at humor.",1526515200,,652,5.230769230769231

7309236,4,B010E1H2CS,"...I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. Didn't have a clue what I was getting myself into, but I felt like this is a hidden golden nugget of a movie.
Reminds me of some of the 90's movies that had more of a sweetness underlining it that you wouldn't expect. Give it a wath, you won't regret it.
Not sure what age limit to put this at, but there are a couple of mock sex scenes and for some reason they used some pretty heavy slang words for humor. So...a mature 15 would not be completely out of the question... unless you are someone who doesn't like humorous foul language...",1523750400,,582,4.3

I turn to sex because my wealthy father didn't go to my graduation wah, isn't getting tested for STD's a drag wah. I got fired because firing anyone else would result in a lawsuit, because having sex with interns could never result in a lawsuit even though I was told to stop. I was an internet sex sensation because I emailed this list to all my friends, therefore I had no choice but to become a whore. OMG take some responsibility. Cyber bullying? Seriously?

I must admit, I couldn't make it past the first fifteen minutes without feeling both jipped of my time and as if I had contracted a grotesque STD under the most asinine and unexceptional circumstances.

7309291,5,B010E1H2CS,"Okay...Maybe some slight Spoilers here...so be Alerted! Yes --it is sex-oriented! If sex, adult topics, and adult language bother you...perhaps you should make a different selection. Otherwise, I think most people will find this a heart-warming, laugh out loud romance.

I have seen the thumbnail for this flick in my Amazon video feed for some time and just had no interest. I felt, wrongly so, that it was just some c-grade Cinemax sex reject. Did I mention I was wrong?

This is a wonderful comedy-romance flick that has illicit sex as a component. It is NOT sleazy or low class. No real nudity, some simulated sex, lots of adult topics, brief nudity, and lots of adult language. It, therefore, earned its R rating. But this movie has something else: A LOT of HEART!

We've all been in that extra lonely place. Life seems so bleak and pointless, and then, BOOM! We find real love when we thought it was non-existent. Oh course, this high-quality movie follows a familiar romance roller coaster ride of ups and downs as the main characters ebb and flow in and out of their interest in one another.

Throughout it all, the characters become very real and one will surely identify with them enough to feel the story come alive. In her bid to escape the escort business and grow her own tutoring business, the lead character played so well by Lyndsy Fonseca, is as inspirational as she is adorable.

It is a comic love-story of two people with their own sexual hang-ups, who overcome the odds, together. It is also a feel good story of human failures and the triumph over the obstacles we all face in life.

I am not a huge fan of comedy-romance, so the Five Stars I bestow here were earned the hard way: through excellent writing, directing, cinematography, editing, and acting. I watched this on a whim and I am very happy I watched it.

If you know the real feeling of loneliness, you might appreciate this more than most. I highly recommend it!",1502064000,4,1947,4.642441860465116

It's a modern tale about what is actually happening and what could happen when people realize that they can change. The cast was brilliant and the screenplay as well. It teaches a lesson how important to stick to your own belief (whatever it may be) and just have a little nerve to pursue it.

7309389,5,B010E1H2CS,This touched my heart. I relate to Natalie in so many ways but not the escort part. Cyberbulling is real & I'm mentally still a victim of it years later to this day. I made dumb choices in college too that led to my name & mistakes being put on the internet. I cringed when she spoke about the way her name is slandered in what feels like forever. I know that feeling of not wanting to tell anyone you meet your real name bc of fear that they will Google you. And it some job applications are impossible-no matter how qualified you are. Moving on. It was so inspiring for me when the admissions director told her they were going to accept her bc they wouldn't be another obstacle to keep her from reaching her fullest potential. That was powerful. This movie oddly turned out to be one of the best movies I've related to & Thank You whoever wrote this story.,1495929600,,858,4.269938650306749

The characters were alright and actors meant well, but the overall plot/story line is not something believable for real life sex work. It only showed the negatives that would be stereotypical for an escort (ex. guys being grabby/violent - which actually doesn't happen often especially when weed them out with higher rates), when in reality there are many other negatives that never seem to be mentioned in these movies because most movies about escorting are produced and acted with non-escorts.

The quality of the production struck me as extremely simple, something 5 people with a DSLR under a grand and a mid quality PC with Adobe premier could throw together. Much of the dialogue comes across as trite, and shallow and meaningless. But the narrative of the story, the impactful things it touches on in some of the more meaningful moments, and the back and forth between the characters was enough to keep me involved with it. More importantly, the things told without dialogue were perhaps the most insightful and capturing. When something of this quality can keep you involved, something is right.

It's easy to see why  people will compare this to Pretty Woman, but I feel it's a great disservice to this film. The dialogue is edgier and more realistic, as is the setting and basic plot. Although unrated, I'd call it PG13; there's no T&A, and far more is implied than actually shown. The whole story revolves around dialogue; a welcome relief from much of what comes out of hollywood these days.

The acting is good, dialogue and pacing fantastic. The writers (and director) made something that's classic. Perhaps most impressive to me is the lack of a villian/antagonist in the film .. the heroes are real people we both love and hate, and can relate to their strengths while cringing from their flaws. This honesty about real life is a strength of the film and makes it far more enjoyable to watch than Pretty Woman.",1491091200,,917,4.5120481927710845

This film points out that people are frequently and inaccurately ""diagnosed"" by friends and family to make THEM feel in control of the situation and better than everyone else. On display is two people who, by any ""normal"" persons standards, are considered messed up. It shows the before, during, and after transformation.

7309475,5,B010E1H2CS,"I saw this movie on a free trial, don'rt worry I plan on buying it for real. Anyway, okay story I guess, I learned a little something, Natalie played her Victoria persona down to a tee, Joe never truly realized how much of a problem he had, until he had that
wack intervention, between his sister, father, landlord and friend, understood that much. In the end, they got together, the story
is sort of similar, but very different to ""Pretty Woman,"" I think that The Escort will definitely give me a refresher course with Pretty Woman.",1489536000,,533,4.5625
7309476,5,B010E1H2CS,"Well-executed, smart, and funny. Not too heavy, but not too light in subject matter. Solid production value that I didn't expect from the premise, title, cover. Good work and worth a watch.

7309483,4,B010E1H2CS,"I almost didn't watch this because I was expecting raunchy scenes and bad acting. I quite enjoyed the characters, the acting and script. The best friend, JP, was a little strange and intense. I liked the chemistry between Mitch and Natalie and loved his little sister! I found the men's room attendant and the landlord's reactions to Mitch's sex addiction humorous. Natalie's dialog with Mitch near the end in his apartment, where she analyzed/diagnosed his issues, was well done and believable. Although there were a couple of rough patches that made me cringe, I'm not sure if it was the storyline, the acting or the editing, it wasn't enough to take away from the overall appeal.",1489190400,,682,4.887931034482759

7309486,5,B010E1H2CS,"I was not expecting to watch until the end, but I did. This is not bad for a comedy, I think it deserve a much higher rating than 3-3.5 stars. Not an Oscar winning masterpiece but a perfect movie for some laugh and fun. Glad amazon have this on prime.",1489104000,23,251,4.04

7309491,4,B010E1H2CS,"Well written and executed. You'll enjoy the dialogue and acting. Lyndsy Fonseca sparkles here. I think if you compared this movie to other smaller films of a similar scale and budget it could easily pull five stars. It gets just about everything right. However, as I am comparing it to all movies in general, I am docking one star for narrative weight. Schindler's List this is not. Still a great movie. I highly recommend it.",1488931200,2,426,4.693333333333333

I almost feel bad for having assumed I would be disappointed in my decision to watch it in the first place. I am humbled...",1488758400,7,439,4.116279069767442
7309493,4,B010E1H2CS,Lyndsy is quite exceptional when the Hollywood machine/ editor matrix manages to patch together her emotional states; Michael Doneger- writer of and star of the film is less believable. Its an enjoyable fairy tale for white folks which has some nice supporting characters who feature as beneficial buttresses to the weak ecology created by the writing team. Easy to watch and some good feelings at the reclamation of our collectively jeopardized soul!,1488758400,3,451,5.277777777777778

A day or so later I came back to look for another movie but I first glanced at the reviews since they were still on my screen. They were quite positive so I thought I'd watch a few more minutes, and then I suddenly became interested. It's a really good romantic ""comedy"" with some very good dialogue, so my thanks to the previous reviewers.

I wasn't sure how many stars it deserved, but I felt 3 were too few so I gave it 4. It's worth watching if only to see Lyndsy Fonseca's beauty, but all the actors in this film play their parts very well. Try it --- you'll like it.",1488153600,2,656,4.125

Insightful writing and great acting from all involved.",1487116800,16,335,5.036363636363636

This is an entertaining piece for a normal person, it shows the faults and insecurities in people, fears of skeletons in the closet from the past holding the main characters back from reaching their potential.

7309762,4,B010E1H2CS,"Granted, all Romantic comedies have a certain amount of silliness, and humor that can stretch from funny to sometimes downright offensive, but the main difference in the ones that ""work"" is that they have HEART;  and that is exactly what this wonderful story has.  The Characters are quite imperfect, each with their own hangups, and the profanity is so rampant in this movie, that it extends to a very young female.  But it doesn't matter, because as I said, the magic ingredient of HEART is in this story, and it will win you over.

The lead, Lyndsy Fonseca, is just so terribly adorable, despite her hard edges:  she is literally, a little bit of thing, but remarkably pretty and plays her part to perfection.

As a bonus, one of the greatest comediens of our time, Bruce Campbell, has another one of his hilarious spots as the Father of the protagonist, speaking of which, also plays his part very well.

In the end, it is an uplifting story, and should satisfy the Rom-Com nation out there....",1477785600,,998,4.668571428571428

I've watched this movie a bunch of times, and it just makes me smile because I always forget some of the lines and laugh when I hear them again, just like I did the first time!  Both movies have a self deprecating sense of humor which allows you to laugh because you identify both with the person being the dweeb and the person who thinks they're a dweeb, but likes them anyway.  One line (in The Escort) makes reference to the movie Pretty Woman, and I have to say if its possible to follow the timelessness of that movie, then both The Escort and This Thing with Sarah do as well.  Every relationship should be full of ""ah ha"" moments when you learn something about somebody that you didn't expect, and suddenly they become increasingly more dimensional because of it.......Hear the writers are doing an MTV series of The Escort, but selfishly, I would like to see more movies just like these......",1472774400,6,1048,4.553191489361702

The chemistry between Michael Doneger (Mitch) and Lindsay Fonseca (Victoria/Natalie) was natural and similar to Gere and Roberts in Pretty Woman.

Fonseca plays a Stanford-educated escort for reasons unknown.  Doneger is an out-of-work reporter in search of a top-notch biopic and meets up with escort Fonseca.  Together, the two save each other.  Partially romantic comedy and partially drama, this movie is on-par with Pretty Woman.

7310210,2,B010E1H2CS,"The basic story is predictable, but the actual story has a few twists here and there.  Even so it did feel somewhat vanilla flavored, and there really weren't any surprises.

What I was expecting (other than perhaps a bit more sex) was a real story about a journalist being tempted by his subject.  But it isn't.  We don't see the main character write a single thing until the end.  And even then we just see the magazine supposedly with hit article in it.

We don't get his commentary, we don't get his insights, we don't get any emotional impact other than him losing his cool a few times.  It's not a thorough movie.  I mean why on Earth would you be attracted to a woman who charges men money for sex?  Oh sure, as guys we understand the physical aspect, but this guy falls in love with a woman who really doesn't care much for love.  It's like she falls for him for the sake of the movie, and nothing more.

In this way this film felt very mechanical, and it really wasn't all that well shot in the first place.  No insights from the characters of why they do what they do, a rather bland shooting style, some predictable plot points or points that have no bearing or evidence to be present in the first place (note that sex-intervention scene), and what you have left is a kind of Pretty Woman knockoff minus the budget that went into Pretty Woman.

Like I said about another film, this film needed more sex and story, and by story I mean some real thoughts expressed by the male lead.  Why have no idea why he's falling for this hooker other than she's personable.  The guy's not that bad looking, so perhaps it's a case of being miscast (as well as poorly written and shot).

If you're going to make a film about sexual discovery, then make that film.  This film is like a freshman writer's sexual fantasy come true, but without the sex.  Make of that what you will.

Otherwise I say avoid this thing.",1459209600,,1909,4.356940509915014

The main characters had some deep flaws, but they were basically good at their core.  All in all, I enjoyed the story.  The acting was decent, not great.  The worst part of the film was the idea that a Stanford graduate would only have prostitution as a job possibility.  Then again, maybe that's not the most implausible thing about this film.

I understand Amazon wanting to stay in the competitive streaming service market but the video quality must be improved. Hulu and Netflix video quality is 100 times better. The only thing I hate about Hulu is all the excessive buffering. If I had to choose out of the 3 Amazon streaming wouldn't be my first choice.

7310393,4,B010E1H2CS,"This is your odd ""Pretty Woman"" type of romantic comedy that is perhaps more drama than either genre. This is not your dumb sleazy ""50 Shades of Shasha Gray"" escort type film.

The story centers on Mitch (Michael Doneger) who is a journalist and writes obituaries. However ""Obituary Writer"" is not a film title people will flock to. Mitch is also a sex addict who uses a sex app on his phone to hook up for fast nameless sex. His behavior gets him in trouble and he gets fired from his job. He applies for another job, but needs to present a printable article, i.e. not obits in order to get hired. He meets up with Natalie (Lyndsy Fonesca) an educated escort. She allows him to follow her around so he can write a story about her....just follow the formula.

Bruce Campbell comes in at 48 minutes into the film as the rich father of Mitch. Rachel Resheff plays Mitch's potty mouth sister. The film has humor, but is not laugh out loud funny. It is a light drama that keeps you engaged even as you know how it ends.

7310395,4,B010E1H2CS,"Honest, well written and enjoyable.  A movie that can depict how guys can behave just because they can, whilst managing to entertain you without being gratuitous is something I can appreciate. I have 3 criteria that guide me for movies: Is it predictable? Is there evolution of character? & Will I remember something about it, a scene, image, feeling, character, years after having seen it?  (If it makes an impression, even though I might not 'like' it, I give credit for the imprint power it has.  I love movies, and admire those involved in the industry.  I liked the evolution of character in this movie.  There are some well written lines in this one, especially at the climax where Natalie tells Mitch what his real problem is. I also liked Natalie's character & story line, which reflects these times.  Doneger is honest about how technology is affecting intimacy and relationships these days.  (Even the relationship one has with one's self.)  The good natured undercurrent is welcomed in these times.

Many apparently expected it to be about the journalistic process for one of the main characters... it isn't.

It is actually more of a story which explores two people that are not exactly broken per se, but are at least missing something in their life. That being said... nothing really seedy, nothing terribly violent, nothing like Taxi Driver and the need to save a prostitute from some bad end. Remove those expectations and don't expect to compare it to Pretty Woman... give it a chance. It's worth watching, especially once you realize the reason that both characters like each other is they are not judgmental to one another. Though to explain that more would be a spoiler.",1534809600,,853,4.842465753424658
