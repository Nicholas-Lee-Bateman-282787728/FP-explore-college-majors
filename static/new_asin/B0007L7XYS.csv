I have lived in small apartments for the past few years, and you can EASILY do this DVD from start to finish in a small living room... you just need a little bit of space... and you work up a sweat doing it!  I have worked out for years, and this DVD is definitely challenging, fun, and easy to learn!",1276560000,5,335,4.0606060606060606
2217515,5,B0007L7XYS,"I am a 50 yr old female national guardsman. I have been taking pretty good care of myself for most of my life. I don't really like to exercise, but this is a necessary evil in life as well as in the military.
I love this DVD set. I bought it first in 2003 and have tried other programs but none are comparable to Slim in 6. My 22 yr old daughter uses it too.
It gives me the results I need and Im exhausted when I complete it every day. Debbie Siebers shows you alternatives as well if you are not able to do a particular exercise the way she does.
I love the results I get, I look amazing for my age and I have abs to die for.  Try it!",1264896000,18,636,3.781954887218045
2217516,5,B0007L7XYS,"I've been using various Beachbody workouts for a little less than a year. In spite of the typical infomercial ad campaigns the programs I've done from them are very effective and straight forward.

I have been exercising for the better part of the last 20 years, and haven't missed a day of some form of exercise in the past 11 years. Lots of years of Yoga, Pilates and Strength training!

Anyway, my wife had actually purchased Debbie's ""Slim In 6"" program at the same time I got Tony Horton's P90X. After finishing P90X I figured that for ""fun"" I'd do some of Debbie's programs, thinking they'd be a piece of cake. WRONG! They were actually very tough and humbling!

Slim in 6 works your body quite differently because of the constant low impact cardio type moves that really target your lower body before moving on to the resistance band and floor work exercises.

Keep It Up is under 45 minutes and starts with her standard standing warm ups which move into lots of squat, plie and other moves as well as standing ab work. Also she includes a small bit of kickboxing type exercises.

Then you move onto the resistance band work. She does two sets of a sequence of rows, shoulder presses, curls, and triceps extensions. Believe me, it seems like it's going to be easy but by the time you're thru you'll be pretty fatigued in those muscles.

After comes floor work. you're on all fours and doing various types of leg raises. It's so intense I actually have to alternate legs every few reps, sometimes every rep, because my glutes were burning so badly.

In between the right and left side of floor work you do a long set of pushups (wide), after the second set of floor work you do tricep pushups (elbows in close).

The program ends with some standing stretches and then you're done.

The program also comes with optional ab work (Slim in 6 pack) and stretching (Slim in limber) on the same DVD if you want to add those.

All in all, I've been thoroughly impressed with Slim in 6, Keep It Up and the Slim Series programs I've tried.

If you see my more than 200 reviews here on amazon, you'll see that I'm clearly not affiliated in any way w/ Beachbody (mostly Yoga/Pilates dvd/vhs and book reviews) but I have really benefitted, as has my wife, from these excellent programs.

One word of advice, if you do buy from Beachbody pay in full, not in separate payments as I've heard of people having difficulties with getting extra charges. I've always done it in one payment and so far (knock on wood) have had zero problems.

Of course you could just buy it from Amazon market place or Ebay and not have to worry about it, but I've been really pleased so far w/ my dealings with Beachbody so far though I know there are many folks who have had issues with them.

2217517,4,B0007L7XYS,"I have been exercising for years and found this DVD difficult to do on a daily basis.  She does a great job with challenging someone for a harder workout, but if you are looking for a classic aerobic exercise session then this isn't for you.  If you want to stick to a program and work hard for results, then try it.  I didn't see much difference in my body from the DVD, but I still enjoy to do it occassionally.",1125532800,14,413,4.1375
8048100,2,B0007L7XYS,If you like extensive cargo this tape is not for you,1420934400,,52,3.8181818181818183
8048101,3,B0007L7XYS,Liked that it is a shorter workout. If she had kept the ab and side to side section and got rid of the push ups it would be perfect. I didn't like her being inconsistent in all her workouts. If your going to do 24 reps on the left than do 24 reps on the right.,1373241600,,260,3.6607142857142856
8048102,5,B0007L7XYS,"Love the slim in 6 series, really notice the difference, challenging at 1st, each time you do gets a little easier, this one shorter than #2 and #3 of the slim in 6 series, leg work at end is brutal, I have done 3 times now and still have to take a break in between a few times, but I actually love it",1363737600,,301,3.7936507936507935
8048103,5,B0007L7XYS,I just ordered this DVD to replace my old one that had scratches and was skipping  I do the slim and 6 pack on this DVD just a couple of times and week and it gets me a flat stomach!!! I've never found a better ab routine and it is only 11 minutes. I always recommend this DVD when people ask how I get such a flat stomach. I also LOVE the slim and limber and try to do it at least once a week with my marathon training. This is a great DVD!!!,1357689600,,443,3.7127659574468086
8048104,5,B0007L7XYS,"easy to follow exercises that are low impact, tones, strengthen and stretch moves.  I have tried and look forward to using it routinely, as part of various routines I follow",1356220800,,173,4.766666666666667
8048105,5,B0007L7XYS,"I've had this DVD for years but misplaced it and ordered another one. I only use the Slim & 6 pack and Slim & Limber. The actual workout is kind of a waste if you don't already have resistant bands, otherwise it would be a pretty intense work out. If you do the Slim & 6 pack daily you'll be ripped!",1349395200,,299,3.918032786885246
8048106,5,B0007L7XYS,"I love this workout video.  It is hard to convince myself to workout at home, but with this video I know I am getting a good workout without leaving the comfort of my own home.  I really enjoy the slim and limber portion of the video,also.",1341273600,,239,4.173913043478261

8048108,5,B0007L7XYS,"Good streches.
Good warm up.
Good work out.
Format simlar to Tony's P90, but content very low impact and streches good if you are recovering form joint issues.

Presentation is straight to the point, no hipe, just workout and useful information.",1288310400,2,245,4.975609756097561
8048109,5,B0007L7XYS,"I have many exercise DVDs, but I always come back to Slim in 6.  This is very similar to Burn it Up (the last DVD in the 3-DVD Slim in 6 program), except it's 20 minutes shorter. Still, not much is sacrificed.  There are a few new moves, but it's mostly the same moves done with more intensity. This DVD is short enough that I didn't do any fast forwarding.  As a result, I got an intense workout, but it was easier on my knees and shoulders than Burn it Up.

It sounds like the other reviewers were pretty hard core exercisers.  Don't be intimidated.  If you can do Burn it Up, and you liked that DVD but wish it were shorter, I'm pretty sure you'll like this one. I'm definitely working this DVD into the rotation.",1281744000,15,716,4.189781021897811
