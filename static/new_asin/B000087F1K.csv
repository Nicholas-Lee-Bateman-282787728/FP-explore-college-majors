These four episodes are part of the thirty-nine episodes produced in France for television. They are in English, but you can hear some actors speaking with a very slight accent. These lower budget productions have humor not found in earlier stories. This DVD from Alpha Video has only four episodes, as if it was copied from a videotape. These mostly original stories are serious, not a parody. Their quality varies, but all are worth viewing. They are not in the original order, a number in brackets identifies their sequence. The actors are Ronald Howard as Sherlock Holmes, Howard Marion Crawford as Dr. Watson, and Archie Duncan as Inspector Lestrade (and others).

1. The Case of the Baker Street Bachelors [33].
A Member of Parliament is accused of harming a woman (the accusation will be scandalous). They met via a Marriage Bureau. Holmes and Watson investigate and meet two women. The next day the trap is sprung! Can Watson get the evidence? Holmes deduces the hiding place. There is a complication but the good guys win.
2. The Case of the Baker Street Nursemaids [26].
A package arrives, it needs careful handling. An important foreign visitor was kidnapped. A Secret Navel Treaty is involved. Holmes test the note paper. Can the spies be stopped? Holmes and Watson accomplish their mission.
3 The Case of Lady Beryl [02].
Carl Oberstein was shot by Lady Beryl, her husband works for the Foreign Office. Is she really guilty? Holmes deduced what really happened and who killed Oberstein. [The Second Stain]
4. The Case of Harry Crocker [09].
A man is accused of the murder of a young woman. Holmes investigates. What about that locket? Holmes solves a murder caused by jealousy.",1422230400,,1739,4.8915254237288135

""The Case of Harry Crocker"" in this volume-1 is the best episode of the twelve episodes I have seen and worthwhile. An escape-artist is wrongly accused of murder. He repeatedly escapes the police, often moments after they have handcuffed him, to seek help from Mr. Holmes.

The Case of ""Lady Beryl"" in this volume-1 has some humor too and more clever detective work than other episodes.

""The Thistle Killer"" in volume-5 (not in this one) has some suspense.
All the episodes are only 25-minutes, so there is not enough time for depth. The other nine episodes I have seen hold your attention; are not bad, but are not memorable. So of volumes 1,5,6; I only recommend this volume-1 for the two good episodes, if the price is cheap.

All 28-episodes are available free on Hulu under TV-shows, ""A"" for ""Adventures of....""; plus the following 11 more episodes:
Neurotic Detective
Haunted Gainsborough
Imposter Mystery
Christmas Pudding
Careless Suffragette
Vanished Detective
Laughing Mummy
Greystone Inscription
French Interpreter
Red Headed League
Winthrop Legend

My favorites in the above were:
""Christmas Pudding""
""Laughing Mummy""
""Greystone Inscription""
""French Interpreter""

7979792,4,B000087F1K,"This first volume in the Alpha/Gotham DVD series of the 1954-55 SHERLOCK HOLMES TV show is superior to the similar Laserlight & Madacy releases.

The episodes still seem to come from videotape recordings of the 16mm prints, but this version is the best copy so far, the noticable artifacting in the other releases is much less here.

The same 16mm films seem to be the source for all of the DVDs.

Until someone finds the original negatives to this French produced show (for U.S. television), this will do.

Sherlock Holmes fans who have not seen this series will quickly fall in love with it.  While the half-hour format does not allow time for intricate stories, the puzzles are still fun to solve.

Roland Howard plays Sherlock almost as well as the great Basil Rathbone, and at times you may think you are watching the classic 1940's movies.",1108684800,7,845,4.714285714285714
7979793,4,B000087F1K,"My wife and I both love the Rathbone movie series on Holmes and Watson. For a different take you should try the Ron Howard and Marion Crawford series. Holmes is more likeable and Watson is the star of the show, but both are very engaging to watch. Certainly worth the few dollars for several nights of entertainment. If you love Rathbone and hate Jeremy Brett, you should like this series.",1043539200,10,389,4.571428571428571
