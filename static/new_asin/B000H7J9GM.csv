8137308,3,B000H7J9GM,I gave it a fair...as the movie tries to deliver a good message...about a boy looking up to his dad...to do the right thing in life.  I really didn't care for the way the film was made...but the effort was there by Romeo.  I would not watch this movie again.,1357948800,,258,4.14
8137309,5,B000H7J9GM,"I purchased this movie. I thought it sent a great message and was thrilled to be able to watch the movie with the entire family! There were no obscene language or explicit lyrics nor sexual/violent contents in this movie. I really loved that Master P has reared and continues to hone his son's talents. This inspired my children that they can too strive and follow God's way and still be ""cool"".",1222560000,,395,4.577464788732394
8137310,5,B000H7J9GM,"I wish this movie and soundtrack would have got alot more promotion because this movie was real insipering to me and the soundtrack should have been Romeo's first official album because it was promoted a lil bit with the video ""You Can't Shine Like Me"" (which might I add got very little air-play and also completly wiped Lil Bark-Bark off the map, yall know who I'm talking about).The whole album was insane and he never has to cuss. Like I said this should have been highly promoted and sold as his first official album with a bonus movie and music videos because with it being sold as a dvd alot of people didn't even see it on the shelfs and that bugs me because at the same time Lil Bow Wow's crappy album is all over the place. Anyways, as you can tell I love this movie/soundtrack and I'd highly recommend it to anyone!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1192233600,,838,4.4480519480519485
8137311,5,B000H7J9GM,"i was surprised at how good the movie and the soundtrack were. it definitly had to be romeos best album yet and the movie was great and had a good message to it, there were special appearances by ... John Witherspoon, Tony Cox, Kyle Massey, Chris Massey, Lil JJ, & many more ... God's Gift was a fantastic overall package

""A Must Buy""!!",1173139200,3,337,4.349206349206349
8137312,5,B000H7J9GM,"ROMEO DID SPECTACULAR!!!! HE AINT LIKE THESE OTHER DUDES OUT HERE SAYING THEY SHOOT PEOPLE. HE TALK REAL. I THINK THE MOVIE WAS GREAT AND THE CD WAS EVEN BETTER. BUT ROMEO MY FAVORITE RAPPER! ROMEO OH ROMEO, U THE BEST RAPPER. THANX FOR MAKING MUSIC FOR THE KIDS AND ADULTS. BYEEEEZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ.",1170374400,4,321,5.1923076923076925
8137313,4,B000H7J9GM,"PRETTY GOOD CD FROM LIL ROMEO,

the film itself is ok - nothing special.

if you like romeo this is good value for money.",1167782400,,121,4.0
8137314,3,B000H7J9GM,"While the movie summary states Romeo tries to help one of his friends, the movie is mainly about him trying to be the best. In fact you really don't even see Don that much.

You can tell this was a Master P production as most of the cast is either from Master P's label or Romeo's show on Nick. You even have a cameo by John Witherspoon (whose name is misspelled in the credits.)

The only extras the film has is Romeo's 4 videos and two trailers. The bonus cd is Romeo's God's Gift cd.",1166227200,2,486,4.105263157894737
