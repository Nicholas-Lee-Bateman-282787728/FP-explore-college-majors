The kids are very lively, and really seem to be having a lot of fun, and clearly the audience is enjoying it also.",1149379200,,187,3.7948717948717947

The total running  time is 76 minutes and, this concert was shown on TV in Mexico as there are breaks where the ads would come. There are also interviews  with some of the kids.

In the concert the only  adults are Minerva and  Ral Padilla(forgive me for not remembering  his name that he plays on  the series, but you know he is partners with  Claudio). These 2 cause trouble during the concert.

The concert is done very much like the series, where they look for the map  and Amy  is taken by  Minerva to the Island.

The music of course, is prerecorded, its the music from the 2 CD Volumes  and they  just  move their mouths to the songs. They all wear microphones around their heads so they can be heard when they talk.

Seeing Amy  in this concert, oh  boy, she is so adorable and, in the last part of the concert she wears  her white dress and is barefoot.

its a wonderful  DVD and, the picture quality is  good, its not super sharp but,its very watchable. The audio  is mono, its not in stereo,which is really  a shame as this music would be much better to hear in stereo. There are 17 songs total  and at  times, Amy  and the others go out into the audience to shake hands or give a kiss

This is a must  own  DVD that  you will love!

Also as an extra,  you get some real nice  fotos shown as music plays from the series. it  is a slideshow and real neat.
