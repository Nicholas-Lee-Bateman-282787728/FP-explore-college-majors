8325497,5,B000NLBU00,"Compelling drama about the little-known plight of poverty stricken Japanese who in desparation emigrated to Brazil just before WWII. They struggle against exploitation, prejudice and poverty in a hostile environment, ruled by Eurocentric plantation owners. They become little more than endendured servants to Brazilian plantation owners, who misreprested living and working conditions and their endenturement in order to recruit cheap labor from Japan. Excellent 5-episode television drama, well-acted with high production values. Story told through the lost letters of two sisters, found 60 years later. The sisters lost track of each other at a very young age, when the family emigrated to Brazil, and each thought that one had forgotten and abandonned the other. Throught the letters, the sisters come to a gradual reconsiliation and healing. English subtitles.",1184976000,3,864,5.7578125
