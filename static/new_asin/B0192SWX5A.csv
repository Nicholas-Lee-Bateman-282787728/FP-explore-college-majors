7561934,4,B0192SWX5A,"Not a ghost movie, not a slasher movie but very disturbing and rather sad.  Its not creepy house type thriller either but a good twisted tale of family secrets gone wrong.  If you want to be unsettled, then this might be good, if you want a good old fashioned scare fest...then this probably won't work.",1456272000,12,303,4.490909090909091

7561944,4,B0192SWX5A,"This movie has the main character as clueless as we are about her family. which helps make the situations more intense and asks more questions about what is really happening in the plot

 It's a little cliche to have the memory of our main character erased, but in this case it works. My only issue is that the dialogue had a tensest to be a little muffled and had to hear during so critical times. You may need to fiddle with subs for some parts.",1464307200,,447,4.247058823529412

7561949,4,B0192SWX5A,"This movie is really more of a 3.5 than a 4, but definitely better than a 3. The acting was what I found most impressive in this. Every person in the main cast gives a memorable performance and really bring each of their characters to life. And they are certainly all characters. From the trailer, I thought this movie was going to take place way back in the day, but it turns out, it was just a family with very little other than their estate to their names. You'll likely be able to see the twist coming from a mile away, but the movie does a pretty good job of moving at a steady pace, so you also won't mind. The cinematography is outstanding and the way they use scenery is quite lovely. There is one scene that will probably make you squirm, but there isn't any gore in this movie. In fact, I don't really remember seeing much blood at all, aside from one particular scene towards the end of the film. Definitely not for kiddies, though.",1462320000,,943,4.303370786516854

7561955,5,B0192SWX5A,"I really enjoyed this.  I love slow moving thrillers that let the mystery slowly unravel, going deeper and deeper, to give you chills as you realize just how twisted the truth is.  This is very well acted and filmed.  It is slow moving and you have to pay attention as small clues are given through out but it wraps up completely in the end with no loose ends.  Family secrets can be so sinister.",1458604800,5,396,4.3108108108108105

7561961,3,B0192SWX5A,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

I find myself strangely conflicted about ESTRANGED, a recent thriller released from Well Go USA.  The movie as a whole is pretty decent, however it has some gaping issues that prohibit me from loving it.  The premise is interesting, and it could have been stunning if the execution had been better.  As it is, the film is a mediocre attempt at making a shocking thriller.

Despite the films flaws, I will state the cover artwork drew me in immediately.  The imagery is stark and bleak, and it projects an air of mystery that begs to be uncovered.

ESTRANGED is shot well and looks good from a cinematography standpoint.  The production value of the film appears decent, although I have no information on its budget.

The acting in ESTRANGED is pretty good, with the whole cast doing a fine job with their performances.  James Cosmo, who fans of GAME OF THRONES will recognize, does a great job with his role here, as he does with just about any role he plays.  Amy Manson, who plays the lead character, January, gives a chilling and yet perplexing performance.  Manson appears to be a great actress, but her character here never seems to come fully together.  I felt like I could relate to her at times, but she also seemed vastly distant from me for most of the film.  This is probably due in part to the writing, and not the actors talent level.

The storyline in ESTRANGED is where I have the most problems.  I was good with the plot until about 3/4 of the way in, when the big reveal comes about.  My first problem here is that the big reveal isn't fully explained.  It is mentioned in passing, and even then, I didn't quite understand where it was going.  The second problem is that the rest of the film, from that point on, didn't make much sense.  I knew what was going on for the most part, but the actions of the characters seemed, well, dumb.  Perhaps I need to revisit the film againmaybe I missed something.  But as first impressions go, Im not impressed.

Still, you cant deny the haunting atmosphere the film builds, nor the tension that is created between the characters.  As such, Im in the middle of the fence on ESTRANGED.  I suggest giving it a look for yourself to see where you stand.  It is available now in a variety of formats.",1456876800,7,2324,4.473809523809524
7561962,4,B0192SWX5A,What a movie. Many people won't watch this because it wasn't hyped in the media. But it's extremely well made & well cast. This young lady can act. I really enjoyed it & would recommend it.,1456790400,4,189,4.277777777777778
7561963,2,B0192SWX5A,"Callum (Simon Quarterman) and January (Amy Manson) vacation in Brazil until they kiss an automobile with their scooter. Callum gets a scratch while January loses her memory and the the loss of her legs. They return to her childhood manor where she can't remember any of the creepy people or more importantly why she left in the first place. Things become weird as they always do in this type of film.

I liked the name January, named for the god Janus who looks both to the past and future. Very clever. The problem is that this genre has been so overdone, there is nothing else clever that they bring to the production. I was bored for most of the film waiting for the scary secrets to reveal themselves, not even interested in the clues...which were mostly head fakes, as the characters were miserably portrayed and lacked depth.

The DVD cover of January with a gun was a bit of a plot spoiler as that scene doesn't come to late in the film.  It was a film I have felt I have seen before a half dozen times and didn't enjoy it then.

8743716,1,B0192SWX5A,"anytime I choose a movie, it's guaranteed to suck. especially if it's one we paid for.",1499126400,,86,4.4375
8743717,2,B0192SWX5A,"Almost perversely unsatisfying movie about a young woman who returns home with her boyfriend after a near fatal motorcycle accident.  She is in a wheelchair and has no memory of anything before the accident--which turns out to be very convenient for her family since there is clearly something off about them all but since the woman has amnesia it takes her a very long time to figure out exactly what it is.

Estranged has a good mystery and creepy premise but to say that this is a slow burn thriller doesn't really do it justice--the movie is so slow for a very large part of its length it's little more than an exercise in masochism, both for the heroine and the audience.  Director Adam Levins seems to think that he's Ingmar Bergman or Andrei Tarkovsky and shows no interest whatsoever in actually making a film with the pacing and rhythms of a thriller--he almost seems determined to eliminate anything that could come close to generating suspense and instead drags out the film's premise so far past the breaking point that when the heroine finally does get her revenge the only satisfying thing about it is that it means the movie is very nearly over--although there might be a director's cut somewhere where she spends another hour at the end drinking a cup of coffee in the kitchen solemnly contemplating everything that she's endured.

Estranged is honestly a train wreck as a genre film, a likely case of a director who thought he was too talented to make an entertaining movie and decided instead to transform what should have been a gothic thriller filled with violent, trashy fun into a boring wannabe work of art.  This only qualifies for two stars instead of one because the acting and production values are first rate and the screenplay had a lot of promise--none of which the movie comes close to delivering on.",1497225600,,1831,4.7272727272727275
