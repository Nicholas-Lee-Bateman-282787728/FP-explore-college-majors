8378488,5,B002R8H632,"as the previous reviewer failed to indicate, this set is mostly pro shot footage from the reunion tour in 2009 before daniel davies started singing with the group, or their 2 latest records werew made (""41"" still does appear as it was played at these shows). the 2009 footage (morgantown and baltimore) is for the most part very well filmed from what looks like 5 or 6 cameras, which is plenty enough coverage from clubs this size. the only real criticism i have for it is that occasionally the shots have a bit of a ""retro"" look to them; a little graininess once in awhile makes this part look almost vintage. the bonus features are plentiful, but not of as high quality as the main feature. all the 1997-1999 footage contained is shot with one camera in some dive looking bars. the exception to this is a 6 song set from the dynamo festival in 1997 - even though only 1 camera filmed the event, its still a great watch, complete with soundboard quality audio (possibly taken from the mountain mamas boxset with these same tracks.) also is the new video for ""20,"" a very surreal but satisfying video. for the KTB fan this is a must own, especially since its out of print now and won't be available too much longer",1323993600,,1214,4.472972972972973

pass on this.",1313539200,,117,3.68
