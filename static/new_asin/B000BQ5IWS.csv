2436656,5,B000BQ5IWS,I was a big diet coke drinker until I saw this documentary!  They do a very thorough job of uncovering the timeline and key people involved in the FDA's approval of aspartame... can you believe that Donald Rumsfeld was the president of the company that manufactures asparatame when it finally got FDA approval!!!  Lots of political information and background.  I highly recommend this!!!,1186272000,9,387,5.111111111111111
2436657,5,B000BQ5IWS,Now I can show people what I have been trying to explain for decades. The poisons added to our food is a disgrace. We are slowly being killed in the name of profit.

2436659,4,B000BQ5IWS,"It's a very interesting video which explained the facts behind aspartamine in an easy to understand manner.

I was a little disappointed it didn't go into the chemical composition very much... as that's central to understanding the problem... but if you know the hazards of methanol and formaldehyde you will appreciate the toxic effects of these substances.

A few illustrations of methanol poisoning from news reports wouldn't have gone astray... as most people aren't familiar with it's effects.

It took two viewings before it all clicked.

Despite this the message is quite clear... a problem exists with this sweetener.

This video also puts a spotlight on the political machinations that are driving organisations like the FDA.

If you've got family and friends who use aspartamine... get them to start using something safer.

This video gives you some useful facts which you can use to convince them.

2436660,5,B000BQ5IWS,"Just over a year ago, I became a statistic when I was diagnosed with Type II Diabetes.  After moving past that initial shock, it occurred to me that I could still enjoy many items because of the convenience of the `artificial sweetener' Aspartame.  I took it on faith that it was tested and deemed safe by the FDA so I frequently used products that contained it.  After watching Sweet Misery: A Poisoned World and realizing that I'm nave, I should have done my homework and found out just what it was that I'd been ingesting.  Needless to say, I will never again eat or drink anything containing Aspartame.

What is Aspartame exactly?  Apart from it being called an artificial sweetener I mean?  Well, in a word, it's poison.  That may sound a little extreme but when you analyze the known information, there really is no other way to categorize it.  Let's take a look.

Aspartame is broken down into 3 parts which consist of Phenylalanine, Aspartic Acid, and Methyl Ester.  When swallowed, Methyl Ester immediately turns into Methyl Alcohol (a.k.a. Methanol, a.k.a. Wood Alcohol).  This substance is very poisonous to the human body.  Aspartame has been linked to 92 different medical symptoms, some of which are also associated with Multiple Sclerosis, Diabetes, Lupus, and Fibromyalgia.  A predominant number of these symptoms are neurological problems.  After discontinuing use of Aspartame laden products, individuals 'detoxifying' themselves have felt their adverse reactions decrease and show a marked improvement in health.  This is strong circumstantial evidence lending credence to the fact that Aspartame is poisonous to the body.  Common sense states that not everyone will have the same acute reactions to Aspartame toxicity.  Information in the documentary shows that those who consumed large quantities of products containing Aspartame were showing severe symptoms sooner rather than later.  Others who use these products less frequently are probably setting themselves up for health problems in their future.

In the late 1970's, the maker of Aspartame, G.D. Searle, attempted to get it approved for public consumption.  Initial tests were not favorable due to health hazards created by the substance (when tested on lab animals, brain tumors didn't prove to be very popular).  This didn't fit the agenda for G.D. Searle so they decided to put the ethics aside.  Upon later investigation, just some of the following information was discovered:  improper lab testing, fabricated test results, destruction of medical evidence showing toxicity, tampering with medical records and scientific data, and critical study documentation purposefully withheld from the FDA.

In 1980, a public board of inquiry voted unanimously to reject the use of Aspartame for public use until more tests were conducted.  Once again, this was unacceptable to the G.D. Searle Company.  By way of unethical political maneuvering and a total lack of professional behavior, the FDA, the government, and G.D. Searle completely disregarded public safety and got Aspartame approved for public consumption.  And this was after 3 senior scientists from the FDA pleaded with the `powers that be' not to release this product.  Unbelievable but true.  This entire ordeal is explained in detail in Sweet Misery: A Poisoned World and it's downright appalling.  In 1983, now being approved, Aspartame was finally unleashed on the unsuspecting public for the first time.  Only 6 months after Aspartame hit the streets, so to speak, the following health statistics were noticed:  brain tumors were up by 10%, Diabetes was up by 30%, and brain lymphoma (a very aggressive type of brain tumor) was up by 60%.  To add insult to injury, in 1988, of all the food additive complaints reported to the FDA, 80% of these concerned Aspartame.

To get an idea of how prevalent Aspartame is, it can be found in these following products (just to name a few):

Soft drinks, vitamin & herb supplements, yogurt, instant breakfasts, candy, breath mints, cereals, sugar-free chewing gum, cocoa mixes, coffee beverages, instant breakfasts, gelatin desserts, frozen desserts, juice beverages, laxatives, milk drinks, shake mixes, tabletop sweeteners (NutraSweet & Equal), tea beverages, instant teas and coffees, topping mixes, wine coolers.

Sweet Misery: A Poisoned World is a very straightforward documentary and while the material presented is highly informative and absolutely necessary, it is also distressing and unpleasant.  I commend the producers of this work for their courage to stand up and expose the shocking behavior of big business and government and their utter disregard for the greater good...the public at large.

For a product ""Generally Recognized As Safe"" by the FDA, and therefore in no need of either research or justification, aspartame is, in fact, a slow-acting, deadly poison that 1) should never have been permitted on the market (for human consumption or otherwise), and 2) should in any case be removed from the market immediately -- and totally. ""Sweet Misery"" makes a good case for this, especially considering all the medical personnel and others who still can believe only what the marketers of this product would have us know.

2436690,5,B000BQ5IWS,"I'm not a dietary scientist.  I'm not a doctor.  I'm not an expert.  I even need a spell check to write this.  But I know what I've seen and heard from close friends and relatives.  A daughter-in-law was having occasional, unpredictable, and unexplained seizures.  Doctors put her on all kinds of medications, but she kept having them.  She also was a heavy Diet Coke drinker and imitation sweetener user because of a concerned weight problem.  When someone suggested getting away from Aspartame, she gave it a try.  The seizures quit and the only ones she's had in the eleven or so years since were mild ones occurring after visiting Las Vegas where Aspartame might be in some of the foods without her knowing it.

A close friend is overweight and diabetic.  At a doctor's advice she went on a lose-weight effort and substituted artificial sweeteners with Aspartame.  Her blood sugar readings went wild.  They didn't correlate to what she ate.  She felt miserable nearly all the time and some of us wondered if she was considering suicide.  My wife suggested eliminating the artificial sweeteners.  Her ""recovery"" was almost immediate and her blood sugar readings became correlated to what she was eating and has remained so for a year or more.

I didn't know that Splenda has Aspartame in it.  Some years ago I started drinking Splenda sweetened drinks by Talking Rain in an effort to lose weight.  I had an extremely painful kidney stone attack.  The doctor asked what I had done differently.  I told him I was drinking the Splenda Talking Rain drinks.  He insisted that couldn't be the cause.  The kidney stone resolved itself but I quit the Splenda drinks for about a year.  When I resumed drinking them, I got another kidney stone attack in about two weeks time.  It too eventually passed and I quit the Splenda drinks for good.  I haven't had another attack since.

As for Donald Rumsfeld being less than candid, that's consistent with his declaration that the war he was orchestrating in Iraq was not about oil, but that Iraq's oil profits that the war would give them control over would be used to pay for Iraq's restoration that they (he along with our tax money, and Cheney affiliated industries by no-bid contracts) were getting paid enormously to both destroy and restore.  These are the people who want to privatize government, eliminate safety controls, complain that government controls take away their ""freedom,"" and claim that the free market will solve all problems--not to mention that they control the free market.

I'm not a scientist, doctor, expert, or certified anything but a person who so far as I know can still put a few puzzle pieces together and see what sort of picture is consistently formed.  How about you?",1294531200,12,2741,4.819742489270387

2436698,4,B000BQ5IWS,"This documentary has effectively made me give up Aspartame. I am very reluctant to believe one side of the story. In fact, I did a little research supporting the safety of aspartame. The evidence against aspartame is much more compelling. Then I went to the kitchen and poured out all my products containing aspartame.

This video effectively scares you from using aspartame. Which is the reason why I watched it, because I was concerned with how much I liked sugar free products containing aspartame.

At the beginning of the video the people they interview seem to be naturally accident prone people. For me, they seemed like people that if wasn't aspartame it would be something else. So I they didn't convince me. The convincing part was just how long it took to approve aspartame, which is no secret. There were various stipulations on aspartame until last decade even though it was developed in the early 70's.

Yes I am grateful that this video has forced me off of diet soda and I think I will never or very seldomly drink it for the rest of my life. The reason I gave it 4 stars is because this is quite possible the least stimulating documentary I've ever seen. I was falling asleep sitting at a reasonable time of the day for me.

2436699,1,B000BQ5IWS,"As a health and fitness professional, I am keenly interested in matters of food addatives and their potential health effects. Aspartame is one of the most common of these addatives and as such the video peiqued my interest. While the  argument given by the documentary is seductive (evil corperations secretly poisoning the populous with an untried and dangerous chemical)the video does  a very poor job of supporting it's self with anything but bad logic and statistical gymnastics.

The first red flag for me was that many if the talking heads revealed a personal grudge toward the producers of aspartame (the psychiatrist was given the corperate run around when trying to design his study)and there was a conspicuous absance of the opposing veiw point. I am not saying it should have been fair and balanced ( all documentaries are opinion pieces)but the counter arguments were never even presented to be dismissed.

Another problem I found through out the video (it was shot on video not film) was the misunderstanding of basic physiolgical processes. Toxin storage, the effect of creatine, dehydration and others were explained by non-experts in completely erroneous ways or not explained at all. The proposed mechanism for the ill effects of Aspartame were logical and seemingly conclusive, but never were backed up with any hard data. the only studies(to the best of my recolection) directly related to aspartame, were statistical or critiques of other studies.

The accusations of corperate crime are well founded and easily ferreted out with some curorary research. these companies did royally screw up their tests and did push it through to get it on the market before adiquite trails were performed. This is unlawful and unforgivable but also completely irrelavent to the case in point: is aspartame so hazzardous that it should be banned from human consumption. All it shows is that corperations are shady cheat factories that are devoid of feeling for the safety of the public. Who didn't know this?

The actual facts of the studies with Aspartame are less dramatic than the video would like to believe. Contrary to the documentary 9it claims that the only positive studies done on Aspartame were done by the companies that sell it) many many studies and trials have been performed since it's release into the consumer market. Of recent, only one study showed a dose- response relationship and that study was summarily dismissed because of major flaws in the colony of rats used as well as methidology. the grand majority of experiments done the world over have been unable to provide a consistant link between aspartame and cancer risk.

The other major mechanism that the video proports is the production of methly alcohol and it's matabolisation into formic acid (they rutinely say formaldehyde but that is actually the stage prior to the adverse effects. But this hypothesis was refuted in the Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health. Vol. 7, no. 2, pp. 281-290. 1981 by Stegink LD, Brummel MC, McMartin K, Martin-Amat G, Filer LJ Jr, Baker GL, Tephly TR from Harvard medical school intheir published study: Blood methanol concentrations in normal adult subjects administered abuse doses of aspartame. They found that the levels of methynol and formic acid went up in abuse doses (far more than even the heaviest drinker of Coke Zero consumes)but returned to normal 8 hours after the dose was admisinstered. No detrimental biological or biochemical effects was noted.

Caution is always advised when dealing with addatives. It is best to avoid them when possible. But it does no one any good to spread unsupported hyseria no matter how important the possible implications could be. The actual science behind it and the true debate in scientific circles is far more complex and subtle than the documentary leads one to belive.

It is also produced with the technical proficiency of a freshman college project. Very boring and overwrought.",1211760000,24,3960,5.117647058823529
2436700,3,B000BQ5IWS,"In Sweet Misery: A Poisoned World, film maker Cori Brackett charts the insidious, deadly and exceedingly profitable hoax perpetrated by the pharmaceutical giant JD Searle and Company Inc., (now owned by Monsanto)  to advance the global wide use of Aspartame as an artificial sweetener.  Aspartame, aka Nutra Sweet, Splenda, or Equal forms the ""diet"" component of  Pepsi, Coca Cola, Kool-Aid, Crystal Lite and countless other products routinely imbibed by people throughout the planet.  Brackett details the destructive impact this chemical has had upon those who have used it and documents how greed-induced Washington insiders circumvented the banning of this substance by the FDA.

Donald Rumsfeld emerges as a key figure in this process. From 1977 to 1985, Rumsfeld served as CEO, President, then Chairman of JD Searle based in Skokie, Illinois. Along with Aspartame, Searle's products, include: Metmucil, Dramamine and the oral contraceptive Envoid. A 1980 Board of Inquiry comprising three independent scientists who, serving under Jimmy Carter  concluded that Aspartame ""might induce brain tumors."" Rumsfeld launched a counter-attack against this report. As a former Congressman and powerful insider, Rumsfeld wielded tremendous influence in Washington and these political assets enabled him to eventually secure  FDA approval of Aspartame. Rumsfeld  saved a foundering JD Searle and his success in this endeavor earned for him acclaim as the Outstanding Chief Executive Officer in the Pharmaceutical industry from the Wall Street Journal (1980) and Financial World (1981).  Throughout the film, we learn how Aspartame kills brain cells-  particularly in the hypothalamus which controls feeding behavior.  According to  experts interviewed and cited by Brackett, three hundred or more people die each year from the effects of Aspartame.

This important and sobering film does her enormous credit. I do wish Brackett had utilized the services of an editor and writer capable of  re-arranging and condensing frequently long-winded and tiresome interviews into a more cohesive, comprehensible and engaging whole.  These weaknesses notwithstanding, and for the sake of the health and welfare of people worldwide, Sweet Misery deserves to gain the widest possible audience so that heightened awareness may finally spearhead a movement designed to ban this highly profitable, low-cost, calorie-free mass poison from the global marketplace.",1208995200,46,2439,5.736111111111111
2436701,5,B000BQ5IWS,This is a very scary documentary but it should be seen by anyone who has the courage to watch it. It's full of painful & frightening truths. The FDA and Food Industry does NOT have our backs. Buyer Beware!,1207699200,4,205,4.282051282051282
2436702,5,B000BQ5IWS,"Lately, I've been researching Aspartame as I am concerned that I am having some side effects from consumption and every day I am seeing it popping up in more and more of the products I have been regularly consuming. First it was my Diet Coke, then my minty Listerine breath strips, then my Wrigley's spearmint chewing gum and it's not even the sugar-free kind! I went to my local drugstore and I see that Aspartame is in the ingredients of all sorts of other medicinal products I didn't know it was in... Even in Children's fruit flavored chewable vitamins!

After seeing this movie, I will not eat or drink anything before carefully reading the ingredients list to make sure that Aspartame is not present. I highly recommend this DVD if you want to know more about Aspartame and how our own FDA may be failing in adequately warning us of the risks.",1206576000,6,849,4.5855263157894735

My MS is definitely traced through inheriting the as I call it the 'Genetic Jackpot' of Garbage Genes that can be traced through prior Generations.  No other Family Member of this Generation of mine (Brother and three other sets of younger cousins) thank goodness has been afflicted with anything Neurologically but it was my Grandmother who had Lupus hence where I can trace the connection to MS.
