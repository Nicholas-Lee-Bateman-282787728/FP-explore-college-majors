8401083,3,B003NGRL8C,"This version, though pleasant, lacks suspense.  The performances are wonderful, but the solution to any situation is provided immediately.  Ian Richardson is charismatic, but his Holmes is not..  He plays him as a rather jocular soul, not as a driven detective who worships intellectual activities.  Entertaining but not great.",1525392000,,327,5.612244897959184
8401084,1,B003NGRL8C,"A real disappointment.  I am an enormous fan of the late Ian Richardson whose career was filled with wonderful performances. Sadly, his two outings as Sherlock Holmes were in misbegotten productions. This SIGN OF FOUR is badly structured, poorly written and departs seriously from the original novella by Arthur Conan Doyle. The carnival and house of mirrors scenes come out of thin air and are unbelievably poor. David Healy makes a completely colorless Watson. Instead, watch again the miles-better Jeremy Brett SIGN OF FOUR--written by John Hawksworth--with better acting and a truer spirit, It doesn't hurt that the late great John Thaw appears in the major role of Jonathan Small in Brett's version. This Blu Ray is also a disappointment technically. The original aspect ratio (likely 4:3) has been ""zoomed up"" for this new Blu Ray with the resulting chopping off of heads and other parts of the original images.",1462233600,,917,5.113333333333333

This product has two ""Sherlock Holmes"" movies from the 1930s where Arthur Wontner played the most famous fictional detective. Here is a brief description. Read the reviews for each movie. Arthur Wontner best resembled the old illustrations for the Sherlock Holmes stories.

The Sign of Four, 1932 film
This was adapted from the story by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Jonathan Small tells of a treasure buried in a fort in Agra. Major Sholto and Captain Morstan search for the jewels. Will there be a conflict? Retired Major Sholto reads about the escape of Jonathan Small. He tells his two sons of his secret then collapses. Mary Morstan owns a florist shop and gets a strand of pearls! Two men invade the Sholto home to search for the treasure. Mary Morstan's safe is cracked. A letter calls her to a meeting, she is warned against going to the police. The ending was changed from the original novel, which had a more ironic ending. It is one of the best of the Holmes films. Ian Hunter is the best ""Doctor Watson"", a young man around thirty. There is subtle criticism of British Imperialism and its looting of the treasures of India.

The Triumph of Sherlock Holmes, 1935 film
This is based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's ""The Valley of Fear"". Sherlock Holmes is moving out for his retirement. Professor Moriarity wishes him ""a pleasant and permanent retirement"". Moriarity is offered $50,000 for a job. Inspector Lestrade visits with news of a murder at Birlstone Castle. Holmes and Watson go there to investigate. The body of Mr. Douglas has a brand on the arm. The murderer took the wedding ring from Mr. Douglas' finger. Lestrade questions the people there. [Does the wife seem sad?] That brand is the mark of the ""Scourers"", a secret society. Widow Douglas tells their history in America. She met Jack Murdock in America. What about the missing dumbbell? Barker and Mrs. Douglas laugh over their behavior. At night Holmes solves the crime by finding a missing person. This is not the real history of the 1876 Coal Wars in the Anthracite region. This clever story shows how easy it is to jump to a wrong conclusion when you depend on circumstantial evidence. Holmes does not make this mistake.

8401086,4,B003NGRL8C,"MILL CREEK ENTERTAINMENT offers bargain-priced movies with no extras beyond four-chapter access. Their transfers are unrestored and without closed-captioning. Counting MCE's 50 and 100 movie packs, I own over 1,000 of their dubs. Although none are studio-quality in appearance, very few of these are unwatchable.

Arthur Wontner is star of this Holmes double feature. The second sound-era Master Sleuth (behind Clive Brook in ""The Return of Sherlock Holmes""), Wontner began his seven year run in 1931 at age 56. Many believe his sober, scholarly detective better reflects Conan Doyle's creation than Basil Rathbone's more physically active portrayal. I like them both, but lean toward Wontner's films solely due to a predilection for early to mid-1930s cinema.

This DVD contains Wontner's 3rd and 4th Holmes movies. (Note: Ian Fleming in ""Triumph of Holmes"" is not the spy novel author.)
