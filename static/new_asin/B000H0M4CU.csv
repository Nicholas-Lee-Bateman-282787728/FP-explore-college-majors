2625093,1,B000H0M4CU,"Black Dhalia.

This is a blatant case of cashing in on someone else's coattails. A reviewer below made that point. I find it 100% accurate. It duped me. Luckily it was just a rental.

After I realized this wasn't what I thought I decided to get my money out of it and watch it to the end. People, its as bad as previous reviewers state. Its not bad its awful.

First we have camcorder 101. It feels like a home movie. I understand that its going to realism. It doesn't work.

Second, acting is terrible. This simply has to be one of the worst cast movies I've ever seen. Right down from the catholic whackjob girl who cusses at every woman her henchmen cut up to the cops.

It simply does not draw you in. You feel like you're watching a concept movie instead of a real thing.

The story is simple. The last man to see the Black Dahlia alive is still alive. His daughter/caretaker runs a family ""side"" business so he can relive his best moments before he dies. Thats it. Oh, and during the movie you see a bunch of severed limbs and screaming just for good measure.

No surprises, not real connection to the viewer. Avoid this one. Its a shameless cash in on the ""other"" film of the same name. Look for Ulli Lommel's name. If you see it - put it down.

You'll thank all of us.",1161216000,4,1276,4.222222222222222
2625094,1,B000H0M4CU,"After seeing this movie in Blockbuster, I rented it and after taking it home and seeing the first fifteen minutes or so of it, I instantly regretted it.  This movie looks like a movie that was made in a college dorm, it was very poorly done.  The special effects are terrible, the camera looks like a video camera someone bought in a electronics store, the acting is awful, and I didn't understand the plot at all.  It was pretty gorey, but it was from Lions Gate, the same people who made Saw and Saw 2, which is a whole lot better than this movie.  I would not recommend buying or renting this movie.",1161216000,3,602,4.300884955752212
2625095,1,B000H0M4CU,"I just bought this DVD and watched it tonight.

Oh God, this is again one of the most rubbish movie I have ever seen!!!

I am still wondering if it is really a movie or someone is joking, wasting negatives just to make fools out of viewers like us by this experimental garbage...

There is nothing in this garbage movie, silly, pointless, senseless, confusing, especially the shots they used make you dizzy.

The movie is hard-selling nothing but blood and body-parts in a meaningless way, I seldom use the ""hate"" word, but I hate this movie.

Please note that I actually wanted to give ""0"" star but since there is no such option.

We are being tortured and ripped of money above all!!!

The Black Dahlia case is one of the more mysterious, unsolved cases in america.... and a very intriguing one at that.

I haven't see DePalma's new version yet. However, the best version I have viewed so far was the one with Lucie Arnaz. Hard to find, made for TV, but a good one.

A crazed Gulf War veteran and her cohort stage fake auditions looking for another ""Black Dahlia"".  Not only was this psycho groomed by the Army to torture (she has a lot of flashbacks) but is tied to the last missing link from the original unsolved mystery of the original Black Dahlia (who's shown in flashbacks and looks hot).  A nosy cop and a bunch of dead bodies points towards a weird old man and a warehouse.

2625101,1,B000H0M4CU,"Okay for those who don't know this is not the movie directed by Brian De Palma, it is actually a rip off directed by Ulli Lomell. Ulli Lomell is a German director who has done only one so-so movie called Boogeyman(1980) (not to be confused with the 2005 version) anyway this director is doing a movie every freaking month, and they are all horrendous. Like this one they all have bad acting, bad dialogue, bad lighting, etc. . . . The story centers around some sickos who are reenacting the murder of Betty Short (Black Dahlia) again and again more murders in the same fashion begin to occur, it becomes so repetitive that you literally have to fast forward. Also the movies production is so cheap, I think even someone with no experience and no money would do a better job. The director even makes the movie worse than what it already is by inserting ""SAW"" like transitions every second; it gets really irritating. And not to mention the ending which made no sense whatsoever. PLEASE don't watch this for the curiosity to see if it is as bad as everyone thinks because it actually is as bad. Definitely avoid at all costs.

2625105,2,B000H0M4CU,"I rented this accidentally a few weeks ago, thinking it was Brian DePalma's ""The Black Dahlia.""  But this one, Uli Lommel's Black Dahlia, is a whole other beast.  It basically centers around a cute, psychotic girl (who stole Sheri Moon Zombie's laugh and fashion sense) and her two silent henchmen in helmets who hold auditions in abandoned buildings for the next Black Dahlia.  Anyone who's not ""right for the part"" is cheerfully tortured and killed, complete with random nudity and dancing in blood.  There's a bizarre subplot with idiotic detectives and an old man to whom psycho girl is caretaker or somehow related, who may have killed the original Black Dahlia and wants to try a new one . . .

The whole deal is several shades of rotten, from the z-movie budget to the random Eon McKai-style editing.  It doesn't even fall into the ""so bad it's good"" category, but I threw in an extra star because I'm sure it would be incredibly funny if you were drunk.",1178496000,,961,4.65680473372781

This film is made by a really awful german horror film director who for some reason, continually pumps out terrible films.  Most of them are only watched because he is constantly exploiting other current movies.  Like this film which came out  close to the time of Brian DePalma's film.  This director also made a film called Boogey Man, which not surprisingly is almost a scene for scene remake of John Carpenter's Halloween.

Young girls arrive at an old abandoned building, expecting to audition for a movie adaptation of the infamous ""Black Dahlia"" murder. They're all pretty stupid, because they all allow themselves to be strapped down and cut to pieces by two rednecks with implements of destruction. The whole scene is instigated and witnessed by these two hicks' sister, who stands there giggling like some moronic ninny.

I will say this: I gave it an extra star because I didn't expect the ending...that's it's saving grace.....disgusting, but at least it didn't end the way I figured it would.

The guy at the movie rental place warned us at checkout that this one was a different version, but we decided to try it out anyway, since sometimes it is interesting to see different perspectives of the same idea.

After watching the movie, I have to say this is probably the worst movie I have ever seen.  Like other reviewers, I think this movie should be rated a ""0"", but since ""1 star"" is the lowest rating you can give, that is what it gets.  It looks like something someone put together for their high school or college drama class.  I have never seen such bad acting outside of a porno movie.  I forced myself to watch it to the end in the hopes that it would eventually get better or have some redeeming quality, but alas - nothing.

The cinematagrophy looked very much like someone making home movies.  There wasn't enough character development to really make you feel much for the characters.  They repeated many of the same shots over and over again.  After seeing the first person tortured and cut into pieces, I really didn't need to see that 5 times - it just got really boring.  They would have been better off using a little inuendo and spending that extra time to develop the plot a little more.  You never really got a true sense of what the motivation of the characters were.  The guy that played the young cop in the movie was the only one that gave a half-way believable performance.

In summary, this movie stinks, and is not even worth renting.  Believe the reviews - it is THAT bad.

Lommel is truly a fascinating man to be sure.

From there Lommel directed several horror films during the eighties, one of which became a cult favorite ""The Boogeyman"".

8135710,1,B000H0M4CU,"I went into work one morning and found sitting on my desk a stack of 15 DVDs, most of them horror, from one of my co-workers.  Sorting through them, I already had one, and the rest I'd never heard of with two exceptions.  One was a loaner for my daughter, while the other familiar one was this movie, BLACK DAHLIA.  Or so I thought it was familiar.

Obviously, the movie I thought he'd loaded me was the 2006 Brian DePalma movie with Mia Kirshner in the title role.  What I got was not so much.  Instead, this was the 2006 direct to DVD version directed by Ulli Lommel.  That's ok, I thought; it reads on the DVD cover, ""From the director of The Boogeyman.""  Okay, well, BOOGEYMAN was, in my opinion, a failure, but it was a good looking movie, at least.

Again, not so much.  Whereas I thought the box was referring to the 2005 Stephen Kay movie with Barry Watson and Emily Deschanel, what it actually meant was the 1980 movie starring John Carradine and Suzanne Love.  So.

Lommel has been directing since 1974, so it should stand to reason BLACK DAHLIA should project some sense of a filmmaker who knows what he's doing.  And that was my third strike.  Oh, if only that meant I was out and didn't have to sit through this thing.

BLACK DAHLIA does not tell the story of the real ""Black Dahlia"" killing of Elizabeth Short in 1947.  Instead, this story is set in present day Los Angeles and follows a rookie cop as he tries to track down the culprit behind a series of copycat murders.

Meanwhile, in an abandoned jail, a casting call is being held for a movie called BLACK DAHLIA.  Only when the actresses show up, their audition is to be strapped to a table and murdered by an obviously insane woman in a school girl uniform and her two silent thugs, one a shirtless man in a stained butcher's apron and a black leather mask, the other a man in a crude baseball uniform wearing a batter's helmet with a football helmet faceguard over the front.  The fact these are the only three people at the audition and that they're all covered in blood splatter doesn't seem to faze or confuse any of the auditioning actresses.  Granted, I've never been to an audition, but I think three people in an abandoned jail all covered in blood would raise my suspicions.

While the rookie cop, Rick, finds himself becoming obsessed with the real Elizabeth Short, through a series of internet searches he finds a connection between a movie producer who was going to work with Short in 1947 and the casting call for the BLACK DAHLIA movie being made.  Well, it's not really being made, it's just a front for the murders, but you know what I mean.

While Rick's partner is boozing it up at the bar, Rick goes to the jail and heads into the scene alone, without backup, by himself, and it's not a good call.  Luckily his partner sobers up just long enough to answer Rick's page and the cavalry swoops in just as Rick has been strapped to the kill table and his eyeball plucked out with a pair of tongs.

Yes, BLACK DAHLIA is a gory movie, very much so.  Lommel certainly didn't shy away from showing the goods.  There is a ton of blood in this movie, as well as lots of severed body parts and half a dozen kill scenes.  In fact, the majority of the movie is taken up by these kill scenes and the case could be made for this movie only existing so Ulli Lommel had a reason to film as much gratuitous gore as he could cram into one film.  I mean it certainly wasn't an intense character piece, and it wasn't in an effort to answer once and for all what really happened to Elizabeth Short--although both of things did come across in this movie, as we see Rick's character development and a fictionalized resolution to Short's case does indeed come about.  But those weren't the reasons Lommel made this movie.

Considering some of his other movies around this same time were ZODIAC KILLER (2005), B.T.K. KILLER (2005), GREEN RIVER KILLER (2005), followed by SON OF SAM (2008) and D.C. SNIPER (2010), it becomes apparent Lommel isn't in the business of making art (funny thing, considering he worked with Andy Warhol on COCAINE COWBOYS in 1979), and instead is just sensationalizing America's fascination with serial killings (granted, the Black Dahlia case wasn't a serial killing, but it is the most famous unsolved murder in American history).  Or rather, he would be sensationalizing them, if they didn't look like utter crap.  Admittedly, I'm working strictly from the example of BLACK DAHLIA as I've not seen any of Lommel's other movies, but if this is the quality of his work 32 years in, then someone needs to have a talk with him about goals, standards, or maybe a new line of work.

In the acting department, this was only the second movie for both principles, Elissa Dowling (Kate, the schoolgirl-clad ringleader) and Sutton Christopher (Det. Rick--also his last movie), and it shows.  I wouldn't be surprised to discover this was the only movie for a lot of the actors, and rightfully so.  Please please, everyone, go back to your shift at Denny's, someone's Moons over My Hammy are getting cold.  I will have to give Dowling credit, though, for living the dream.  Since starring in this movie in 2006 (her 2nd movie, remember), she's racked up a total of 57 movies in 6 years, some of them even decent movies like the 2009 After Dark Horrorfest movie DREAD.  That same year she was also in VAGINAL HOLOCAUST and then in 2010's DAHMER VS. GACY, so, you know, take from that what you will.  Myself, I'm just surprised I found a valid a reason to use the words VAGINAL HOLOCAUST in a sentence.

The effects here consist mostly of tons of blood and a small number of rubber severed body parts, like a leg, half a foot, a hand.  They were nothing special, used strictly for shock value.

The third biggest problem I had with this movie, and the one I think is really going to turn off the most viewers, was the editing.  Aside from the acting, aside from the cheap video quality of the film, the editing by Christian Behm (credited a Xgen, and also starring in the movie as Det. Christian), was a disgrace.  Someone was having way too much fun with all the fancy buttons on their editing machine.  We've got slow motion, we've got black and white, we've got a few instances of reversed footage, we've got several shots that just repeat 3 or 4 times, as well as too many shots to count of footage just repeating on top of itself, so we're watching the same scene play out in layers, all simultaneously.  It's headache inducing and is the true downfall of an already bad movie.  My advice, when your movie sucks, don't assume fancy editing is going to make it better.  Just let it suck and try to do better next time.  I mean, the dude's been making movies almost as long as I've been alive, he should not be turning out work this cheap.

Ulle Lommel's BLACK DAHLIA is a train wreck from the first frame to the last.  You can watch this movie, but you won't be doing yourself any favors.  It's not even cheesy fun, not really.  I'd put this movie only a cut or two above a piece of crap like Carlos Batts's AMERICAN GOTHIC, and only because this movie has a mostly-coherent story.  But it's not a good time.  So do yourself and your DVD player a favor and steer clear of this one.",1342828800,,7263,4.468892261001518

Is so far removed from the actual Black Dahlia case that if it wasn't for the title, no one would know it is supposed to have a connection.  Bad acting and the film work was worse than any home movie I have seen.  Save yourself the time and the money, take a pass on this.",1314144000,,416,4.098765432098766

Whats with that chick dog soldier, and all those YOUNG PUNKS up to chopping up babes and scattering them all over the place, and that Hopscotching all over. What is this. This has nothing to do with the Black Dahlia at all. All this director can do is make a comedy over a serious murder that happenen in 1947 and make money off this con film. If you are a collector of worst films this is the one to get. Go ahead and spend your hard earned money on this piece of TRASH. The movie directed by Brian De Palma is the closest you can get to the Black Dahlia.",1270339200,,692,4.021739130434782
8135713,4,B000H0M4CU,"Ulli Lommel's Black Dahlia: 7 out of 10. No the score is not a misprint. Yes I'm going to have to use the entire review to explain this grievous lack of judgment.

First of all this is not the studio release of Black Dahlia. This is a Z budget rip off with decent cover art. Second this is an Ulli Lommel movie who I swear is Uwe Boll's uncle and one of the worst directors working in sub-par serial killer films today. (His Zodiac Killer was one of the worst films I've seen this year) He and his trusty 1985 camcorder have been shoveling out serial killer movies the last few years and he apparently has some compromising pictures of Lion's Gate executives because they keep releasing them.

Half the cast is unnecessary, the drunken cop is over the top and one of the main bad guys is Anna Nicole Smith's first husband. The Saw rip-off directing style and three sets location are horrible.

So why the positive score? Somewhere in the first twenty minutes or so the movie becomes so bad it actually becomes good. There is something ridiculously appealing about vivisection, bondage and catholic school girl uniforms mixed in with swing music. Now read that last sentence again if that doesn't appeal to you run far and fast. There is nothing else to see here so keep moving.

Also in the films favor is that the acting isn't so bad it grates on the nerves. (A real risk with zero budget films) The gore scenes are plentiful and done in a Monty Python over the top style. The ladies are somewhat attractive and actually look like real people. (I don't think this was a naturalistic touch by Lomell I just think he couldn't afford better looking plastic woman.) The soundtrack is an excellent combination of catchy monk style classical (think the Conan soundtrack) and 40's style pop tunes. When a pigtailed catholic schoolgirl and two masked guys dance around with severed limbs to a Sinatra tune you simply can't wipe the smile off my face. That's why I liked it. Excuse me while I go seek some help.",1268870400,2,2003,4.555555555555555
8135714,1,B000H0M4CU,"Black Dahlia (Ulli Lommel, 2006)

So you want to make a movie about the Black Dahlia, and you want to make one that's even worse than Francis Ford Coppola's 2006 abortion on the same subject. And oh, yeah, you want to release it the same year, so everyone and their mothers knows it's worse. Who ya gonna call? Ulli Lommel! The master of plotless dreck comes through again. I really can't believe this is the same guy who made Tenderness of the Wolves.

The movie takes place in the present day, and the police are investigating a series of murders that have a striking resemblance to the Black Dahlia killing sixty years ago (except for a few minor details like, oh, the way the body parts are placed, what's severed, that sort of thing). There's no mystery about who the killers are, since we see most of the murders as little set-pieces throughout the film. They're headed up by Brianne (Lorielle New, who has the most annoying laugh in the universe), a lovely young thing who we see doing a lot of military stuff in flashback (this is never explained). She has two big, silent partners who actually do the dirty work, after which they all do a little dance and then go place the body parts for the cops to find. They never actually change clothing, though, so they're traipsing around the streets of Los Angeles while still drenched in blood and no one notices. Well, okay, in Los Angeles, maybe no one would notice.

As has been increasingly common in post-Boogeyman Lommel flicks, everything about this turkey is painfully bad. The acting is terrible, the script is worse, Lommel's direction seems as if he shot the whole thing while blasted on bargain-basement kamikazes. The entire movie makes no sense whatever. Gets half a star because I did finish watching it, and because there's some entirely gratuitous nudity.",1263600000,2,1824,4.7115987460815045
