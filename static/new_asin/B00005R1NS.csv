7951800,1,B00005R1NS,"I found this DVD with a search on Amazon which auto-completed with the words ""facesitting DVDs.""  Two reviewers referred to scenes involving facesitting - one specifically, ""Pindown Girls.""  This and any other scenes on this ""camp"" DVD showing films from the 1940's included *NO* facesitting scenes, whatsoever, *ANYWHERE* on this DVD.  Nor were there any instances of mixed wrestling - a total misrepresentation of the product.

If this is what you're looking for, you won't find it here.",1326326400,,489,5.230769230769231
7951801,4,B00005R1NS,"At first appearance, it looks like a mediocre collection of vintage female wrestling clips, most of which are pretty redundant. The shorts (both in and out of the ring) are interesting and somewhat humourous, but I highly recommend it solely for the inclusion of PIN DOWN GIRLS, a great exploitation fillm starring Tim Farrell and the wondrous, mysterious Peaches Page. A great find!",1145318400,5,383,5.095238095238095
7951802,5,B00005R1NS,"Womens wrestling as it used to be:women who sat on your face or
squeezed your head between their thighs till you you were barely conscious, and did not feel sorry for you. This DVD is brimming with the head scissors and face sitting you loved to watch. Women,especially, will enjoy this retrospective, watching their own kind laying on their sides, crushing heads between their powerful legs, or staring down at their oppponents eyes, the only part of their faces visible, as their bottoms smother the consciousness from them.",1002672000,18,526,4.988636363636363
