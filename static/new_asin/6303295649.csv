7843313,4,6303295649,"What actually happened at Little Big Horn may remain a mystery forever, but this film is one of the most balanced and honest attempts to explain the events of Custer's Last Stand.  The documentary uses Native American  accounts, contemporary newspaper reports and U.S. Army archives to  interpret the events leading to that day and what transpired.  The film  employs still photographs of the battlefield and the battle's key  participants to set the context.  The roles of key Native American leaders  are explored, as  is the impact other U.S. Army campaigns had on the  mindset of those leaders.  To provide a counterbalance, this film also  examines the personality of the flamboyant and headstrong George Armstrong  Custer. ""Last Stand at Little Big Horn"" continues the tradition  of the PBS series ""American Experience"" in searching for the  truth in an honest and objective manner.",956361600,19,888,5.198581560283688
