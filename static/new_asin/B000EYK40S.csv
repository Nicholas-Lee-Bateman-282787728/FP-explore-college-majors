2546691,2,B000EYK40S,"<strong>The Phantom</strong> (Alan James, 1931)

Pre-code thriller that lacks anything relating to thrills. A bunch of folks staying at a remote mansion, later including some of the local constabulary, are stalked and done away with one by one by the title character, an escaped convict (potboiler vet Sheldon Lewis in one of his final movie roles). Now, you might be thinking to yourself, ""hey, this sounds like a pre-code slasher flick!"", and reading back over it, it kinda does, but really, it's not. Or, perhaps, it is, if you think about the absolute bottom tier of slasher flicks. You know the ones, where there's no characterization, no plot to speak of, nothing but a bunch of cardboard cutouts waiting for someone to come butcher them. (Read: any horror movie starring Paris Hilton.) Except, in this case, despite the movie being pre-code it failes to bring even the tiniest drop of blood to the party. Does have a few laughs going for it, but honestly, if you never see this movie, you won't have missed a thing. * ",1312761600,,1025,4.785310734463277

The writing has left gaps in the tale that are all too obvious, lots of the camera work is below poor, and the sound quality is bad even for a film of this age.  The acting is something less than high school drama level.  In many scenes one actor will approach another and then stand there for a second or two before delivering their lines.  Then, after another long long pause, the other actor answers.  It pretty bad.

Want a good action story with great acting: try Railroaded, also on Amazon.  After watching that movie, click, ""more like this"" and you will come up with a series of old mystery and action films that are excellent (well... most of them).

2546710,4,B000EYK40S,"Watch this film for a laugh and see how to really botch a film. It is hilariously instructive. Really!
It has every flaw you can imagine: dialogue, casting, acting, script, story. It would make a great party game to count them. They seem neatly placed as to almost plead for film school inclusion.

The Phantom starts out (for about 30 seconds) as a crime thriller then morphs into Laurel& Hardy meet The Thin Man. I laughed a lot at this film just for the later characters in the insane asylum. You just have to see it to understand. It's nuts. It was all worth that part of the film. The actors/characters seem to all be acting in different shots but it somehow moves smoothly enough to keep me entertained. It seems almost as if there was no director. This is nonetheless, one of the funniest bad films I've seen.

2546711,1,B000EYK40S,"There's not much to enjoy in this dated, underachieving thriller, starring Guinn ""Big Boy"" Williams, who was much better suited to play the roles in which he shined as the goofy side-kick in Westerns starring Errol Flynn, etc.  Instead, Williams is assigned the hopeless task of attempting to pull off the lead role in this nuclear disaster-sized failure of a film.  ""Big Boy"" is sorely out of place as the mystery-solving reporter-hero; and although the personable, easy-going everyman which is apparent in all his performances, peeks through occasionally in this clunker, it does not do so often enough to sustain his character or the film.  A welcome addition to almost every film in which he made an appearance, this fiasco named THE PHANTOM is clearly not Williams fault; he is simply miscast and painfully lacking in anything resembling competent direction.  And poor Allene Ray.  Her brutally fast career demise in post-silent film Hollywood did not occur quite quickly enough as evidenced by her presence in this movie.  Though she was unique and should be remembered as one of our first female bronco-busters in her native Texas, which served as the launch-pad for an uneven silent film career, it's difficult to sit through her high-pitched delivery and her pathetic attempts to attain some level of sound film competence...which never occurs.  Equally nauseating is Violet Knights' turn as the housemaid.  If anyone was ever in desperate need of acting lessons--or better yet, of permanently staying as far away from a movie camera as humanly possible--it was her.  Finally, the character of the ""Phantom"" is an absolute disaster in this laughable stab at the haunted house suspense genre; even with no lines to deliver other than incoherent grunts and groans, the actor flubs even the essential creepy hand gestures, supposed to give audiences the shivers.  If you want masterful hand gestures, look to Bela Lugosi who was the best ever at delivering emotion through hand movement.  The only reasons I can think of to recommend this stinker is for a good laugh, or to point out that it would prove valuable to anyone who wanted to learn how NOT to make a film.",1363737600,3,2172,5.0055555555555555

You get to see how people dressed, what cars they drove, etc. But I must say this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. As some of the other reviewers have said, it's a bit like a silent movie, but with talking. The actors make all sorts of facial expressions, and then finally deliver their lines. It's also curious that when the characters are walking indoors, it sounds like they're always stomping.  Perhaps that is somehow due to the sound-recording technology, or maybe the movie sets just all had really hollow floors.

The movie makes me think this is what Troll 2 would have look like had it been made in 1931, except Troll 2 at least had a more-focused storyline.",1469404800,,809,4.534246575342466
