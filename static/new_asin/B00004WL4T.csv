Both prints were put though a scene for scene color correction, sound design and re-mastered. WE GUARANTEE THESE ARE NOW THE BEST QUALITY PRINTS OF THESE TWO FILMS ON THE MARKET.

7925501,1,B00004WL4T,"I don't know what the last poster was thinking... This DVD goes to the top of my worst quality list. I wouldn't complain as much but they are advertized as ""Digitally Remastered,"" which is obviously meaningless. ""Long John Silver"" is soft-focus, borderline blurry, throughout; marred with constant flecks and blobs; and has countless vertical scratches that score the full image. It's like watching some old home movie you found in a trunk. Haven't viewed ""Captain Kidd,"" but a cursory scan indicated it too is in poor condition. If that's the best the films come, and there's no money for clean-up, so be it. But get that misleading ""Digitally Remastered"" off the box. That's a hoodwink if ever there was one.",1084147200,8,710,4.925
7925502,5,B00004WL4T,This DVD Double feature cost me ... and was worth every penny. Long John Silver (1955) and Captain Kidd (1945)  Two films I had never seen before but always wanted to.  With Marengo Films putting 2 movies on every DVD they release it's a good bargin! The films look very clean and the sound is great. Can't wait to see what else these guys come up with...,983750400,16,355,4.2835820895522385
