Though billed as a cute love-triangle story, it is instead one of the most violent, psychologically sick Hindi movies I've ever seen. In this long, disjointed tale, the protagonist (whom we're supposed to be rooting for?) is basically a psychopath who grossly abuses everyone close to him and finally incites a bloody massacre at his own family's wedding party. There are no redeeming features of this production except for the tasteful costume design and stunning beauty of Yukta Mookhi, who won the Miss World contest in 1999. According to IMDB, this film was one of biggest box office disasters in the history of Indian movies. And well deserved.",1404950400,,827,4.79020979020979

The photo is of the box for the ""original"" Pyaasa, usually regarded as one of the best movies ever made in India, by auteur Guru Dutt.

One review/summary is for a modern film which also has the word Pyaasa in the title - the word means ""thirst,"" I believe - but that movie has NOTHING to do with the Guru Dutt movie pictured.  Another write-up is about the original movie (the original movie is the one about a poet.  Waheeda Rehman and Guru Dutt are in it).

IN ADDITION - if this is straightened out - a potential buyer also wants to know whose dvd is for sale - the Eros one, which is a dark print with no subtitles for the songs (which have important lyrics, the story is about a poet), or the Yash Raj one, which is supposed to be better and which is what I was looking for!!

7977644,3,B00007L3RZ,"Just letting you know, the review titled ""Bollywood tale of a poet, a love, and the sin of greed,"" in which the reviewer writes that the synopsis above is totally wrong, is totally wrong.  He's confused this ""Pyaasa"" with a 1957 movie by the same name.  His review for the old black and white Guru Dutt film is fine (and it really is a great film), but this is not even a remake as far as I can tell.  It just has the same name.  Such a confusing situation is inevitable when Bollywood makes more movies than India makes words.

Other than that, I have nothing useful to say about this film, having never seen it.  I was actually searching the web for a version of the 1957 film, but with decent subtitles.

I hope that one day, when you get a dvd of a foreign film, you can choose what level of subtitle you want.  You know, there would be the ""very concise"" option, which would be like the version of Pyaasa I've seen, where entire verbal exchanges as well as every lyric in the film are completely left to your imagination, but at least you don't have to do much reading.  And then there would be the ""more thorough"" option, where you get the lyrics and darn near every word of dialogue, even the fast exchanges, reasonably well subtitled.  Then maybe you would even have ""comprehensive.""  Every word, even when repeated.  Even all the background chatter, maybe in a smaller or dimmer type to connote secondary importance.  And every lyric.

That will be nice.",1146614400,,1463,4.451127819548872
7977645,4,B00007L3RZ,"First of all, the plot synopsis shown for this film on Amazon is completely wrong. This is a story about a poet in contemporary India, circa 1957. It has nothing to do with the story line described in the ""plot synopsis"". The second thing, interestingly enough, is that this film was included in the Time Magazine Best 100 film list. I had never heard of it, and imagine my surprise when my local video rental store (you know, the store name that everyone's heard of, denoting a movie that makes a lot of money, busting the block, so to speak) actually had a copy of it to rent. Not what one would expect.

All Bollywood films have songs and this one's no exception. The main character, Vijay, is a poor poet whose poetry abilities far outshine those of his fellow poets. Only in India, at least in 1957, poetry always meant words sung to music. Our hero is a great lyrical tenor whose lilting voice makes the ladies swoon. His two crude dopey brothers want him out of the house and his mother begs him to stay as well, defying her two dumb sons, but Vijay has to leave to make his own way in the world.

An ex-lover, Meena, currently married to a wealthy director of a publishing company, regrets having given Vijay up for her current husband who has all the comforts of life but no heart. A good-hearted (and beautiful) prostitute (gee, is there any other kind in these films?), Gulab, takes Vijay to heart after initially scorning him for being so poor. A comic relief guy, the local masseur, Sattar--whose specialty is massaging the heads of men--values Vijay as a friend. Greed shows up in the persons of the two brothers who sell Vijay down the river for pay; the publishing director, who does the same; and a rival head of another publishing firm as well.

Clocking in at more than two hours in length (138 minutes to be exact), this could tend to try one's patience. But many of the songs--and they are frequent--are moving. The masseur's song is a real joy--comic, with a large dollop of, believe it or not, West Indian music thrown in (the composer is the great R.D. Burman), this (at least for me) was the real musical highlight of the film. It puts a smile on your face at the same time it makes your body move. Lots of fun!

But the serious songs, sung by Vijay and his prostitute lover, are poignant. While it's true that there is real melodrama here, the film ultimately becomes a real emotional gripper in its last 40 minutes or so as Vijay goes through some major changes. My guess is that the reason this is on the Time Magazine Best 100 Films list is that it is unique; you won't see this combination of melodrama and musical in a film from any other country, and, as noted, it's emotionally resonant.

An interesting cinematic experience, Pyaasa is definitely worth viewing. The DVD allows you to listen to each of the songs individually as they appear in the film. Note that unfortunately, none of the songs are accompanied by English subtitles which definitely limits the enjoyment of those who do not speak Hindi (this could be Urdu; I'm not sure. I gueesed Hindi, but I could be wrong). Nevertheless, the emotional context of the songs as they are sung shines through pretty clearly, so subtitles are not absolutely necessary.

Definitely recommended.",1137196800,,3275,4.580204778156997
