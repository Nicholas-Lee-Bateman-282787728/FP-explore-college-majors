4166724,5,B003QAHJYG,"The first time I ever saw this was with my oldest uncle. HE was a Joe E. Brown fan and I have been ever since that day too.
Its all about CLEAN humor suitable for family viewing. The kids really need to learn to appreciate comedy from this era.",1395187200,2,244,4.0
4166725,4,B003QAHJYG,"Joe E. Brown is at his best in this comedy baseball story filmed in the 1930's.  The film got lukewarm reviews in the day and it is a B level Warner film.  However, Brown was a big baseball fan and his athletic skills play extremely well here. The good natured humor holds up very well in the 21st century.  The chief character is full of endless excuses and Brown plays it to the hilt.  There are plenty of sight gags including one of the most hilarious pitching styles ever committed to film.  Credit Brown for creating several small bits of business that add charm to his character.  It really is his show, with support from William Frawley and Olivia De Havilland.

The picture quality is good considering the age of the film.",1371168000,4,730,4.484848484848484

4166727,5,B003QAHJYG,"Comedian Joe E. Brown--who had a personal love for baseball--plays Frank X. Farrell, a rookie for the Cubs with one of the kookiest pitching styles I've ever seen. But Farrell's penchant for excuses & pure malarkey get him in & out of trouble, personally & professionally, thus earning him the moniker ""Alibi Ike"". Farrell gets mixed up with gamblers who make him ""fix"" the games. Caught in one of his alibis to his sweetheart (a glowing Olivia DeHavilland just before movie stardom), it sometimes affects his game, with him pitching cockeyed, much to the frustration of his manager (an early William Frawley, long before ""I Love Lucy"").
Brown is at his most genial best as Farrell, who seems to play the game on his own rules. The big climax where Farrell arrives just in time to save the day (in this case, night) shows off Brown's athletic ability as he darts around the bases & tumbles over the guy holding the ball to come into home base safe.
Definitely one of Brown's best vehicles!",1350086400,,989,4.689655172413793
4166728,5,B003QAHJYG,"What a wonderful movie, particularly for movie and/or baseball fans.  Joe E Brown is great, the story line fun and Olivia DeHavilland is cute in one of her first movies.  The DVD quality was fine.",1297036800,3,196,4.571428571428571
4166729,2,B003QAHJYG,"Joe E. Brown was Warner Brother's in house comic for the standard 7 year contract until 1936. With his goofy looks dominated by a wide mouth and narrow eyes, Brown usually played a gauche hero is some sort of scrape who beats the odds and wins the heart of a pretty ingenue leading lady. In this way, his films are not unlike those of the English George Formby, who was even goofier looking but had a significant advantage because his films always had delightful musical numbers and much better production values.

""Alibi Ike"" is one of Brown's better known comedies set around a baseball star who has an excuse for every action. The comedy is predictable, genial but hardly rib-tickling! The film has a good supporting cast, mainly wasted, including Ruth Donnelly and a teenage Olivia De Havilland at the start of her illustrious career. The production values are very ordinary for this is really a B grade entry. If you have an interest in baseball, that helps.

The film has been issued in the Warner's Archive collection which means it is very expensive, unrestored and contains no extras. In this case, the original theatrical trailer is included and the print is good.",1295395200,4,1174,4.778325123152709
4166730,5,B003QAHJYG,"I love this movie. I saw it on A & E late one night a few years back and had to have a copy for myself.
But I only paid 24.99. Anyways, Joe E. Brown is a hoot.  You will also notice a character from I Love Lucy...Fred, he plays the coach. Olivia De Haviland plays the sweet girl just like her character in Gone With the Wind.  Again, love this movie but wouldnt pay this price...sorry Amazon and you have such great prices on a lot of items.",1295308800,2,441,3.943820224719101

8402233,5,B003QAHJYG,"In Alibi Ike Joe E Brown plays a pitcher with a crazy wind up who comes up from ""Sauk Center"" to help the Chicago Cubs win a pennant.  The movie is filled with hilarious skits, and as in many of his movies, features his wide mouth and unusual yell.  I remember as a kid growing up in the 1950's my friends and I would try to imitate his yell.  His movies (mostly from the 1930's) were shown regularly on TV during the 1950's.  Many of his movies centered around sports of some kind, including a track star in ""Local Boy Makes Good"" (1931) to a polo player in ""Polo Joe"" (1936), along with two other baseball movies: ""Fireman Save My Child"" (1932) and ""Elmer, the Great"" (1933).  William Frawley (I Love Lucy) plays the manager of the Cubs, and an up and coming Olivia de Havilland plays Joe E Brown's (Ike) girl friend.  The movie also is said to include some actual professional baseball players.  In real life Brown was said to have turned down a contract with the New York Yankees to pursue a career in entertainment.  I feel ""Alibi Ike"" was probably his best movie, and the CD quality is extremely good.",1418342400,3,1107,4.392156862745098
