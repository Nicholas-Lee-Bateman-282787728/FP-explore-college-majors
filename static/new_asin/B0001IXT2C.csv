And secondly-- this is a steal! With so many anime titles to choose from, sometimes it's really a difficult matter to pick which one's the next best thing for your growing collection! I was at Borders Bookstore (Northridge area) 2 years back when I chanced upon the manga version. As soon as I got home, I searched online for an animated version and amazon has them. I didn't need to complete the book form after I got the complete box set of the show, and I have no regrets either.

And lastly-- if you're an OTAKU, you won't even care how Sugar behaved at all times because her cuteness will definitely win you over. So what are you still waiting for? Go BUY it NOW! :D",1215043200,3,983,4.455555555555556
