4691766,4,B005GNU5N8,"This is a wonderful film. It shows how a little bit of love and kindness can go such a long way, and how helping others can help heal one's own pain. I just watched this again yesterday and it is heartwarming. The thing that kind of stuck out though is that the little girl was gravely ill, devastated from the treatments, yet never appeared to have any physical difficulties at all. She was running with the kite and bouncing around picking out the Christmas tree, having the Halloween party, and always shown walking, never in a wheelchair, even when it was said that her body was too weak for more treatment. Never tiring, never needing to nap. It was even more odd that the healthy brother, about 6, was shown being carried a number of times, but never the sick girl.",1515801600,,771,4.475177304964539

4691863,5,B005GNU5N8,"Without a doubt the sweetest, most heart-warming Christmas movie to come out in 20+ years. Sam Elliott and Karen Allen are such an adorable couple, and there are plenty of sub-plots and supporting characters to round out the story and give it more depth. It is perhaps a little emotional at times, but this movie is never maudlin or sappy. It seems like something that would really happen in a small town, rural area anywhere in America. I watch this every year -- now I don't have to wait for it to come out on the Hallmark channel. Yay!",1438819200,4,538,4.444444444444445

4691986,5,B005GNU5N8,"- A customer in December: ""Well, I'm here to take my tree.""
- The gruff tree lot proprietor: ""You're late. Christmas comes in November around here.""

So around this season - this holiday season - the sentimental bug takes a big bite out of me, and I'm left walking around wishing people merry this and happy that and slipping a dollar or two in those donation pots outside them shopping stores. Around this season, I am an easy touch. And a holiday movie would have to really suck arse for me to get all up on its case. And if you think that preamble is set up so I can bag on NOVEMBER CHRISTMAS, think again.

NOVEMBER CHRISTMAS premiered on CBS in 2010, and it became an instant modern classic. It is enchanting. Not in the sense that something magical happens in terms of angels and elves and flying reindeer. This film grounds itself in more mundane context. It posits that an entire community can pull together and, with kindness and humanity and extra effort, achieve something extraordinary and, yep, magical. There's a lot of Christmas movies out there. I challenge any of those to present a truer depiction of the meaning and the spirit of Christmas.

This movie is populated with established actors like Sam Elliott, John Corbett, Sarah Paulson and Karen Allen. And yet an utterly captivating performance by a young girl named Emily Alyn Lind is what lingers days and weeks and years later. In a Rhode Island town, she plays 8-year-old Vanessa Marks, a very, very sick girl who nonetheless keeps up a good front. Fearing the worst, her parents (Corbett and Paulson) decide to speed up the holidays so that she could experience them one last time. In August, when the father asks the local farmer (Elliott, gracefully aging) if he had any pumpkins and, weeks later (but still prematurely), if he could tag a Christmas tree off the Christmas tree lot, the perceptive farmer suspects what the father is up to and plays along. And soon the small Rhode Island town is playing along.

This film doesn't only focus on the embattled Marks family. Other characters are featured and, over time, one by one, we learn how they impact the life of little Vanessa. One of my favorite characters is the teen waitress (Elizabeth McLaughlin) with the checkered past who aspires to be a children's writer and ends up befriending Vanessa. Anyway, I really, really like this movie. It checks all the boxes required for an entertaining and meaningful holiday film. The word ""heartwarming"" is applied ad nauseam to films like this. Except that NOVEMBER CHRISTMAS absolutely earns that word. Caution: You may need a hankie.

Note that this film is adapted from Greg Coppa's short story. He wrote a short story sequel titled ""A Partridge in a Persimmon Tree"" which takes place twelve years after ""November Christmas"" and focuses on Sam Elliott's character, farmer Jesse Sanford. Both stories are collected in his anthology November Christmas & Other Short Stories, which is available on Kindle.",1355097600,30,2979,4.821917808219178

Love Christmas movies. Watch them every year on Hallmark channels. But they make new movies every year, so some of the older
movies aren't shown as often, or at all. So I add Christmas movies every year to my collection. Being a prime member I like to order
my movies and music from Amazon.
