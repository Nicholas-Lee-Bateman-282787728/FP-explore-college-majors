3982225,5,B002SSTP4Y,"Stop! Ready for some laugh out loud enjoyment?  Then buy this dvd.  Miranda has the best physical comedic comedy I have seen in quite a while.  So much so, I laugh so hard, people come to see what I am laughing at.  So do the right thing for you and buy this today.",1296691200,12,265,3.943396226415094
3982226,4,B002SSTP4Y,"Been watching this on You tube, since it's not available for the US market (yet, I hope, but I've been saying that about Brittas Empire for years now). I first found Miranda Hart on BBC's ""Hyperdrive,"" also very good. I found her style of comedy very likable as the lovesick officer. Her own show is much better. One of her innovations is the breaking of the fourth wall (she talks and reacts to her audience). Not that this is a new technique, it's just that it hasn't been done in a while and it has the added bonus of drawing the audience in to her crazy situations. She also has a good cast of supporting characters, all very British in their sensibilities but that's what I like about it. You get a taste of what's going on across the pond. There's quite a bit of slapstick, heightened by Miranda's 6'2"" frame. She reminds me a lot of Jennifer Saunders of Ab Fab, but her character is sweet not vile, and not so exaggerated you can't sympathize with her. This is a winner and I'm hoping for a US release sooner or later. Are you listening BBC?",1295827200,24,1048,4.3520408163265305

3982248,5,B002SSTP4Y,This is one of the best new comedies.  Miranda Hart is a gifted comic. Please make this available on Amazon Prime and to view on US players.  This is really funny and fresh.  Please.,1362528000,,182,4.294117647058823
3982249,5,B002SSTP4Y,Miranda is a national treasure who deserves to be shared with the world.  The only reason I can see for not being allowed to watch wonderful British tv (including her former series - Hyperdrive) is that we are being punished for no longer being part of the Empire.  Please forgive us and make the dvds available in US compatible format.  Cheers!,1352592000,4,345,4.622950819672131

8379588,5,B002SSTP4Y,"My friend NS I found this after seeing Miranda Hart play Chummy on Call the Midwife and we've fallen in love with her slapstick humor.  Her comedic delivery is fantastic.  Any other comedienne might make this material feel campy and bland but she and her cast are fantastic.  We were out of breath laughing when she and her mom sang the Titanic theme, and the continual references to Heather Small are awesome.  I wish I could buy ts DVD set and watch here in the US.  But I don't have anything that plays region 2.  :....(.  Thank god for Hulu Plus.",1405209600,,550,4.3861386138613865

8379590,5,B002SSTP4Y,I chose this rating as this show is a marvelous example of the British humor.  She is a very talented actor in comedy or serious roles. This series is one of the best on BBC in my opinion.  I am looking forward to buying more of the series.,1370563200,,240,3.9791666666666665
