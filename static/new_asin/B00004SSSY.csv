7921938,4,B00004SSSY,"Stanislaus Merhar possesses that androgenous charm that can exite both sexes.  In this film, he learns quickly to perform tasks in the dry cleaning plant of a French family in one of France's small cities.  The wife needs a spark that no longer exists within her marriage.  The affair is soon detected by the husband.  But the stranger (Merhar) swings both ways and soon targets his employer for casual sex.  Some nudity (not frontal) in the film.",1387152000,,447,4.753246753246753

7921940,4,B00004SSSY,"A very raw movie on the powerful role in people's lives of emotional dependencies on others, on how those dependencies develop and on how these higher in a relationship hierarchy exploit the dependencies for manipulation.  The drama of the dependencies is underscored with sex and murder.  The movie brings to mind Shakespearean plays such as Hamlet or better Titus Andronicus (no, not in the Julie Taymor edition).  I actually ran across this movie in France.",1064534400,2,460,5.1066666666666665
7921941,3,B00004SSSY,"This film is a wonderful, intriguing character study that completely falls apart in its reprehensible last five minutes.  The majority of the film explores the variety of longings people possess, and how they manage expressing-- or repressing-- these longings.  Two couples are contrasted in lifestyle, but the film gradually and creatively shows how the two pairs are less different than might seem apparent at first glance.  The ways the couples interact makes for interesting viewing, and for this reason would warrant a four-star rating.
Tragically, the filmmaker seems to want her cake and eat it too.  The story is not content to chart divided and varied longings-- it disguises itself as a progressive look at erotic behavior (if it can be considered progressive to show non-conformist sexual relationships after at least 40 years of such depictions on film).  But ultimately it becomes clear that what the director really wants is to titillate with scenes that might be considered illicit to the bourgeois audience members and then reassure the conservatives that such illicit behavior will not go without punishment.  Haven't we gotten past such stilted conventions and pandering to narrow-mindedness?  This proves to be a fatal misjudgment in an otherwise interesting movie.",1037664000,10,1284,5.358208955223881
7921942,4,B00004SSSY,"To me, a romantically inclined gay man, this was a fascinating but ultimately unfulfilling tale of a ""normal"" French couple, Nicole and Jean-Marie Kunstler, who have grown unsatisfied with their settled, routine lives. The couple runs a dry cleaning business in an unexciting small French town. Their lives change when they go to a bar with some business associates and encounter Loc and Marylin, a cross dressing brother/sister act.  From the first, the couple is fascinated with the pair but particularly with Loc, the sexually ambiguous brother, (played to perfection by Stanislas Merhar).
The couple is so enchanted with the pair that they take a weekend to the city where the performers are appearing next. When the sister decides to end the act and run away with her lover, the brother insinuates himself into our dry-cleaning couple's lives. The young man claims to be, and is by all indications, straight and soon takes the wife as a lover.  The husband is also aroused by the boy but denies his attraction. Soon the boy is living in the couple's home and working in the Dry Cleaning shop and is showing a talent for that type of work. He even befriends the couple's child and helps him with homework and takes him skating.
Whether his good work arises from Loc's desire to repay Jean-Marie or from some innate talent for dry cleaning is unclear.  I think that Loc feels guilty about cuckolding this man who has shown him nothing but kindness, genuinely likes the guy, and is aware of the man's attraction to him. He wants to make amends in any way that he can. Ultimately Loc offers himself to Jean-Marie physically but is rebuffed.
Whether it's the husband's ""homosexual panic"" or his actually seeing his wife with Loc during one of their trysts, Jean-Marie decides that Loc must go. This leads to the final and I think dissappointing concluding scenes.",995414400,13,1863,4.83385579937304
7921943,5,B00004SSSY,"A routine middle-class couple (both wonderfully acted by Miou-Miou and  Charles Berling) who run a dry cleaning/laundry establishment become  fascinated by a brother/sister drag/dance act at a local club. Through a  series of happenings and coincidences, the brother side of the team (a  brilliant Stanislas Merhar) ends up becoming the wife's lover, plus living  with the couple, working for them in the dry cleaners and lusting after the  husband who may or may not be a closet case. It may sound sordid, but it is  not; the film is the epitome of taste and explores the many avenues a  relationship can take. Fans of French pop culture will be especially  thrilled to see Stanislas Merhar in drag performing as Sylvie Vartan!",965865600,8,728,4.950413223140496
