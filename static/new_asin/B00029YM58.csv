8024890,1,B00029YM58,This should be given away for free. More of a commercal for products then information on shooting.,1262476800,3,98,4.823529411764706
8024891,3,B00029YM58,The basic info was good. I could have done without the ads included in the video which were extensive. It would have been good to know ads were a part of the video.,1214179200,4,164,4.0
8024892,2,B00029YM58,"That's what this should have been titled as a great part of the  DVD is simply an infomercial for Wilson Combat's lubrication products (Wilson drags the viewer through tests of about 4 competing brands of oil against his ""super"" lube,  Yawn!)  and his custom gun parts and the final kicker at the end of the ""show"",  Lenny Magill's song and dance about his DVD's and videos that are for sale.

The relatively short segment on the P226 Sig by Wilson was ok but rather lackluster ""Liven it up Bill"", sheesh!  The Q&A segment on shooting, ammo etc was the ""tell me something I don't already know"" kind.

Either sell the DVD as "" Bill Wilson  and Lenny Magill Promotions with a segment on the P226,"" or cut the price in half!

Disappointing!",1122249600,27,737,4.5227272727272725
