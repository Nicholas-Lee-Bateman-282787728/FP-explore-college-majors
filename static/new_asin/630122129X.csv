7810418,5,630122129X,"A collection of U.S. Government films covering a wide variety of topics from surviving an atom bomb (duck and cover!) to surviving sexual relations; from controlling a riot to controlling your temper. 8 volumes, roughly 60 minutes each.

From the back: ""Since motion pictures began to flourish as a medium, one film studio has produced more movies and spent more money doing it than any other. That studio is the United States Government.

Federal Follies is a hilarious collection of these films (color and B&W,) because at the time each was made, the subject matter was approached with the utmost seriousness. Today, they make for an extraordinary viewing experience, both for their unintentional humor and historical content.""

Vol. 1 contains the following episodes:

Blondes Prefer Gentlemen (U.S. Navy) - ""The perfect blend of manners and idiocy""
The Decision is Yours (U.S. Navy) - ""What's a guy supposed to do for sex?""
Duck and Cover (Civil Defense Administration) - ""Newspapers can save you from radiation burns.""",1163721600,,1023,5.181818181818182
