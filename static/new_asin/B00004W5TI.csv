7924814,1,B00004W5TI,"There were two good matches in this edition of KotC, but there were several that showed little or no skill at all.
Commentary by Mark Kerr, Don Wilson, Ken Shamrock and Gary Goodrich was minimal, and most of it didn't do much to gain any insight to the matches.
One fighter who was announced as having ""3 black belts in different martial arts""  seemed to be totally unexperienced, and in his mini interview said that he studied ""ju jitsu, boxing, and some tae kwon do, but I don't really use it.""  In the ring he didn't seem to use anything and simply  got tired out on his way to losing.
The production values were terrible but on the DVD edition the menus were decent.  Poor lighting on the fighters and comentators and bad camera work. It doesn't even work on the level of being ""raw"" since the most of the fighters only seemed to slap each other around.
Granted these were a lot of possible up and coming fighters, but if you are going to buy a tape/DVD, stick with UFC or Pride.",1019865600,2,983,4.355191256830601
7924815,4,B00004W5TI,"First off....commentary...a bit annoying....lots of talking over each other but What the hell...it's the bouts you buy this stuff for right???
Well good news...the bouts are extremely good....lots of young inexperienced guys who are trying to make a name for themselves. Consequently some of the early lightweight fights involve alot of grappling with lots of reversals etc....they kinda look like kittens rolling around on the floor.
I was suprised how much I enjoyed this and it was also good to see Travis Fulton and Rico Rodriguez involved...it was also nice to see John Matua stay on his feet longer than he did against Tank Abbot in UFC that time.
Overall it's a small production with top class competitors that I think is worth the money.
righto",989625600,,752,4.976190476190476
7924816,5,B00004W5TI,Nice job to the KOC guys.  Excellent production.  Good DVD menu and some nice fights.  Excellent transitions and camera work.  Very impressed.  Better quality than the Caged Kombat 5 pack but I am glad just to see any MMA videos on DVD so I bought them both.,973468800,,258,4.404255319148936
7924817,5,B00004W5TI,"'King of the Cage: Desert Storm' builds on the first installment to bring an even better show.  UFC fighters John Matua and Travis 'the Ironman' Fulton are on the card, as is Pride fighter Ricco Rodriguez.  This time through, there are commentators who really know what they're talking about. (About time, huh?  No more gibbering idiots to distract you from MMA excitement.) Other than Don Wilson, Mark Kerr, Ken Shamrock, and Gary Goodridge commentate.  This little show is setting standards for the entire MMA industry.",971222400,2,521,5.094117647058823
