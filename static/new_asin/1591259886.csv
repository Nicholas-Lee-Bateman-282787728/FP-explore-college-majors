200441,2,1591259886,"I'll start with some of the minor gripes. The packaging was a little tough to work with, but that usually doesn't bother me - I tend to throw that away anyway. However, I realized that I would need some way to store this DVD later on (in a DVD wallet, or jewel case, etc..) Keep that in mind, because you really can't use the original packaging for storage - it really isn't easy to work with. Also, be careful before inserting into a DVD tray - I just happened to notice that there was some of that rubbery glue-like stuff on the DVD that I had to peel off. If I hadn't noticed it, it could have damaged the DVD player. But now, on to more important stuff....

So I first put it in my PC running Windows XP Home Edition. I mention that detail because eventually, my PC crashed! Remember, this is a DVD (just like a movie DVD). So my application (which happens to be Roxio Cine Player) automatically tried to open this DVD, and when it tried to do so, my PC just rebooted. It has NEVER done that before. For comparison, I opened up another movie, and all was fine. That was a very big negative for me.

So then I went on to putting the DVD in my DVD player attached to my TV. It worked fine. So I started navigating this DVD and found out there are 10 lessons covering different real-life categories. E.g. lesson 1 is about greetings, lesson 2 is about introductions, etc..

Each lesson just goes straight into the vocabulary, without really spending time on the pronunciation, or the root of any word. That's why I think that someone who has no knowledge of French is going to find this tough to use. I took French in High School long ago, and so I remember some of the basics. But it's tricky to pronounce the words (at least for me) and that's where this DVD falls short. Each word is pronounced twice, but it's rather quick and you have to constantly rewind to hear it clearly again. Then after they finish the vocabulary for the lesson, they have a short conversation between 2 people using the same vocabulary. And they tend to speak rather quickly (probably like real French people do). That's great if you already know the language, but not so great if you're trying to learn it.

I went back to inserting this DVD in my PC, and stopped the player from playing the DVD so that I avoided the crash. I then saw that there are some pdf files and some audio and video files that you can copy onto your iPod. That does sound like a good idea - to have this on your iPod and learn. But then again, my complaint is that they don't a good job of teaching how to pronounce, and they seem to make the assumption that you know some of the basics of French.

I've seen better products that, for example, give you a test after each lesson. That helps you remember the vocabulary much better. And some more sophosticated products even let you record your voice to see how you're pronouncing the word. Now THAT's a cool way to learn!

So overall, I was rather un-impressed with this DVD. I think this DVD works better for those who want to improve their conversational French to the level of real French people. But not a good DVD if you've never had any French basics. Just my deux cents!",1205625600,,3182,4.321608040201005
200442,3,1591259886,"The package is simple enough with just the DVD in a clear plastic package.  Later, I found out there are printable ""U-Print"" PDF documents on the DVD, which is convenient but it would have been nice to have had a printed manual anyway.  The producers thoughtfully included the installation files for Acrobat Reader for MacOS (on both Intel and PowerPC) and Windows on the DVD.

Also, I thought the capability of viewing this information in several formats (video iPod, straight DVD and computer) a nice feature.

As I don't own a video iPod, I inserted the disk into my DVD player only to hear a strange clacking sound.  I'm not sure what was happening, but as I didn't want to break my player, I ejected the DVD; re-inserting caused the same thing to happen again.  When I moved it to my laptop's DVD player, I had no problems.  I'm not sure what caused the problem, but it's worth pointing out.

On to the content.  I grew up speaking French but lost fluency as I grew older so I was really interested in polishing any latent skills.  I don't know why I was expecting something a bit different--along the lines of a full grammatical instruction--but within a few minutes of starting to watch the DVD, I discovered it was going to be an introductory course or what I call ""tourist French.""

I wasn't terribly disappointed though because the lessons are clear and easy to follow.  Within a few moments, all those now forgotten-used phrases of my youth came trickling back.  There are ten lessons in all, starting with Greetings then Introductions in lessons one and two respectively through lesson 10 (Emergency & Pharmacy).  The tutor's voice is gentle and the French speakers who speak the lesson's example dialog, although corny, are pleasant to hear.

The DVD does cover some grammatical principles in a light, fast review after most lessons and in a more in-depth review after the first five and the last five lessons.  I found these somewhat inadequate although I can understand the reasoning.  This is, after all, a first-step introduction to tourists.

In summary, I'll give this a three-and-a-half star review because I was expecting something more profound, the weird problem I had playing it in my regular DVD player, no printed manual to, and the light grammatical content.  But (in the positive) also because as these things go, this is a well-produced multimedia introduction to the language, along with the ability to view the content on different platforms.",1205625600,,2473,4.845238095238095
200443,2,1591259886,"Here's what this disk is for. If you have a basic knowledge of  French or a memory of having learned it back in the once-upon-a-time, this will refresh your memory in preparation for a trip. The disk is easy to install and use on both MacBook and iPod, although you'll have to provide your own case for safe-keeping.
This would probably not be of much help if you were starting from no knowledge at all- at best it would tune your ear to the sound of the language, although the demanding and fussy pronuciation of French might overwhelm this simple disk. It certainly wouldn't work if you wanted any understanding of the structure of the language so that you could apply it in a real setting.",1214438400,,692,4.492063492063492
200444,3,1591259886,"While the concept here is great, this video learning structure isn't very well organized, moves very quickly and probably won't give you much in the way of functional competency in French.  If used with other types of lessons it might be of benefit, but standing alone it is of limited usefulness.",1211155200,,297,4.823529411764706
200445,3,1591259886,"I am planning a trip to Paris later this year and jumped at the opportunity to try out the iVideo French Learning for the iGeneration, particularly since it can be used in both a DVD and iPod.

Unfortunately, there is no supporting documentation, it doesn't even include a DVD jewel case or sleeve, so you'll need to purchase one or it'll wear quickly.

There is really not much to the presentation - two people face you, toss a phrase out with the English and French written translation followed by the French pronunciation, which itself sounds kind of odd. I watch a lot of French movies and which is my only basis of comparison, and they tend to be much more conversational.

I don't speak French so it was all new to me and I found myself behind most of the time; I was too slow in repeating the phrase before they were on to the next one. Perhaps those who have a basic understanding of the language might have found it more helpful. I did not bother downloading it to my iPod as I wasn't sure how much memory it would eat up and I wasn't all that impressed with the product. I'll probably stick to some basic phrases I learned and my trusty phrasebook.",1207612800,,1158,4.376744186046512
200446,4,1591259886,"iVideo is a great idea - leverage the power and ubiquity of iPods and other similar devices to help you learn or refresh your knowledge of a language.

First of all, installation of the files on your iPod is pretty easy.  The easiest way to do it is to pop the DVD in your player, open up iTunes, and select ""Add to Library"".  iTunes will do all of the work to get everything in there, and then all of the files are available there.  Then, when you sync your iPod, they all end up on there without a problem.

The video files are pretty short, and focus on small concentrated areas.  The people in the video speak the words twice, with the word or phrase on screen in both English and French.  They speak slowly enough that it's pretty easy to pick up the nuances of the pronunciation.  The additional audio files provide extra vocabulary.

Since the files are so short, I can't call this a way to really learn the language.  However, I didn't expect it to be either.  For such an inexpensive product, I don't expect it to fully teach me the language.  It's a great intro for a traveller who doesn't already know the language, or to refresh your rusty language skills.",1207267200,,1168,4.381395348837209
200447,4,1591259886,"Like most language learning tools, this one is aimed at the traveler. So allot of the learning deals with situations you would encounter while on vacation: such as, basic greetings, how to get directions, what to say in an emergency, etc.

Most likely this program will not help you become 100 percent fluent, but it's a great tool for the elementary learner. The video presentation is a bit bland, but I like it better than plain audio. If you really want to learn the language you probably need someone else (who speaks French) to interact with, but this program gives you a foundation; if you have the foundation, it's more likely that someone will help you (because teaching the foundation is the most frustrating part).

good luck",1207180800,,735,4.7795275590551185
200448,3,1591259886,"My sons have been bugging me to buy them Rosetta Stone software so they can try to learn languages---but it's beyond my budget!  I was thrilled to get a chance to review this product.  My older son has been dying to learn some French as a lot of kids in his class are Haitian and speak some French (of course, with a very different accent than this DVD!)  He enjoyed the lessons a good deal, but probably not for the right reasons---he found the speakers to be quite funny in their manner of presenting words, without a lot of context and sort of in a nerdy way.  He did repeat a lot of the words and probably got a bit of a feel for the way French is pronounced, and he did learn a few words, but there just isn't enough here for much use in the long term---it's not a way to LEARN French, more a way to be introduced to it or perhaps brush up a bit before a trip.  I guess this is much cheaper than the real language teachers, and it gave him an introduction, so he was happy enough, but I don't think it's really a product I would go out of my way to buy.",1207008000,,1058,3.995260663507109
200449,4,1591259886,"The iVideo French:  Video Learning for the IGeneration is a fun introduction to the French language.  Granted, you won't be able to speak the language fluently (or understand it very well), but you will be able to address people properly and get a few essentials down when travelling.  Shopping, emergencies, general greetings and more are covered on this disc that can be viewed either on your DVD or iPod device.  When in your computer, the DVD provides additional information including a handy vocabulary feature.

Although it involves the standard repetition of many other language courses, this DVD also features a great cast of people who actually seem to be enjoying repeating French phrases to each other.  It's a lot nicer than having one or two boring individuals repeat phrases back and forth.

If you're looking for an introduction to French or are planning on taking a trip to a French-speaking country, iVideo French is just what you need.",1206576000,4,953,4.993670886075949
200450,4,1591259886,"I studied French for 4 years in high school and 2 in college, so I didn't get this DVD to help my language, but more out of curiosity, since when I went to high school...yeah, it's been a decade, and frankly, I am much better at reading French than speaking or hearing it spoken. I agree with other reviewers, the two speakers seem to exaggerate the pronunciation of everything, which at first made me think that my memory was just bad, but no, it is exaggeration. Once basic thing that seems to be lacking, is just going through the French Alphabet and the sounds accented vowels make, something that is usually where most foreign language instructional videos begin. iVideo French would be a useful tool for beginners and anyone that would like to learn some French before traveling overseas. Being able to put it on your iPod would make it easy to review while traveling. Still, a phrasebook or some other resources will be necessary, especially if you really want to learn French.",1206489600,2,984,4.69364161849711
200451,4,1591259886,"I think this product would be useful for someone who already had some knowledge of the language and just needed a refresher for a trip. There isn't any instruction in how the language works - it's just phrases repeated over and over. The people in the video are pleasant enough, but the presentation can be a little geeky. I laughed out loud a couple of times. I did find it helpful in brushing up on my French, but I used to speak French. If I had never studied it, I think this would leave me a little lost.

The phrases are practical things you need to know if you're traveling - where's the bathroom, which way to this landmark, etc. I was a little dubious about a couple of the pronunciations. The word ""plus"" for example - I've only ever known it to be pronounced ""ploo"" with no ending consonant - in the video, it is pronounced ""ploo-seh."" I'm sure people would know what you meant, but I've never heard it used that way, and I've spent some time in Paris. Other than that, the pronunciation of the demonstrators is quite good, though, again, I can see how they could be intimidating to someone with no familiarity with the language.

I gave it four stars because if you were taking a trip, you would want to know at least the information included here, and if you have a reasonably good ear, this will get you from point A to point B.",1206489600,2,1342,4.342629482071713
200452,3,1591259886,"I am planning a trip to Paris this summer, so when this item was offered through Amazon Vine, I wanted to give it a try.

I have two other basic tutorials which I am also reviewing. All three cover the same sort of information. Primarily these tutorials are designed to give the average person enough vocabulary to enjoy their trip and be able to get by with some basic words and phrases. It just seems right to me to try and pick up a few words and phrases, to show some respect to the people we are visiting. A lot of people speak English, but you can't assume everyone will. These tutorials cover things like getting around, directions, how to order food and check up on your itinerary and reservations. You won't become fluent, but hopefully you will be able to get around a little more confidently.

iVideo French also offers a video component and is designed to be used primarily with your iPod. It is an interesting idea.

After a very brief introduction, two people pop up and begin to roll through a series of related words. As they recite the words (a little too carefully in my opinion), the words are printed in English et en Francais.

As they recite the words, a 'typical' French image is projected behind them. For instance, if they are going through food or restaurant related foods, a French cafe' pops up. It is an interesting visual, but wouldn't it have been a better idea to see these people in actual French locations? The budget probably wouldn't allow. As it stands, they seem like they are at one of those Sears photo studios when they drop a background behind you for your portraits.

The two people on screen alternate pronouncing the words and say each word twice. On the second pronunciation, they turn and look at the other person, who usually nods in agreement. The only problem is no questions have been asked. Usually, they are only saying one word. This doesn't make any sense and only makes the whole exchange seem more phony.

Later, as they start to get into more complicated sentences and phrases, the time alloted for you to repeat seems to be the same as it was when they are saying single words. This just doesn't work. I found myself still trying to repeat the phrase when I was interrupted by the next sentence.

I have found this program is better as simply as an audio program. I play it in my car, on my iPod as I drive, repeating the words and (most of) the phrases. The video is simply too phony and distracting to help me learn these words and phrases.",1206489600,,2501,4.495594713656388
200453,4,1591259886,"I'm in the very beginning process of trying to learn French.  So far I've checked out a few books, and I've priced some expensive packages like Rosetta Stone, and talked to my children's French teacher who thought that Muzzy might be the way for the whole family to go.

And my take on this product is that it rates high for 'fun' and fairly high for usefulness - depending on exactly what you expect to accomplish.  If you are getting on a plane for France next week, this is a great product to try to get control of a few phrases so that you can at least manage to beg for directions to the loo.  Similarly, it would be a good product to use to refresh your memory if you've already had a year of French in the past.  (I was amazed at how much came back to my husband)

For myself, as a total novice in the language, I found that I needed more.  Principally more in the way of a grammar, but I can't tell you whether that's just something I need, and whether other people can breeze past that lack.  In any case, I found  the .pdf files an absolute necessity in trying to get a good grasp of what was going on in the video.  They provide a copy of the conversation, as well as a list of vocabulary words that you can turn into flash cards.

Should you buy it?  I think the person that will get the best use out of this program will be one who is trying to refresh a year or so of high school French, or who is going on a trip to a French speaking country.  My children and I have enjoyed fooling around with it, but we have used it more as a side aid than the principle course.  I think it's a great product for the money.",1206403200,,1624,4.034375
200454,3,1591259886,"We really had high hopes for iVideo French. It is a great concept - to work both on your DVD player / laptop and your iPod. What else could be better for learning a language?

Unfortunately, they just don't have the hang of the process yet. We've used several language products in the past for a variety of reasons and pretty much every alternative was done better than this software was.

You get ten video lessons, plus additional files that provide additional vocabulary. The video lessons are relatively brief and shallow. The format is two people staring at you on the screen. A phrase comes on the screen - English on top, French on bottom. The person looks at you and says the phrase, then turns to the other person and says the phrase again. Maybe so you can see the ""side of their head"" while they say it? Sometimes it was funny because the actors would forget when to turn their heads, too :)

The translations are idiomatic, not literal, so it can be very confusing when the translation doesn't match at all. They should have both a literal and an idiomatic translation so you can see what the words actually mean.

The speaking voices were not always accurate. They were often talking in a stiltified way which maybe helps you pick up distinct sounds but if you were in France you probably wouldn't recognize the sounds as the same phrase. Since they're speaking twice anyway, they should speak once in ""slow speak"" and once in ""normal speak"" instead of just speaking oddly twice.

My boyfriend took several years of France - while I took Spanish growing up - so one of us saw this as a refresher while the other saw this as a new language. He said it was perhaps a decent refresher but with funny diction and with several quite non-useful phrases. As a new learner I found this quite inadequate compared with other language tools. Again, some of the phrases were simply useless. If I'm learning French, I'd much rather do it with one of the professional instruction sets with high quality speakers and phrases.

Also, packaging wise, it came with NO companion book - which is pretty standard with any software, and there's not even a DVD case!

I definitely like the idea of using the iPod's video capabilities for something like this, but this needs another release or two before it's really a useful product.",1206144000,4,2323,4.62378640776699
200455,4,1591259886,"This format is for an iPod or a DVD player.  I wouldn't say the content level is high.  If that is what you want, Rosetta Stone or a complete Pimsleur package may be what you need.  This is a traveler or business package with survival phrases, which have been sold for years.  What makes this unique is that you get the visual and see actual interaction, which also gives you more cultural information.",1206057600,,402,4.465753424657534
200456,5,1591259886,"If you took French in college but don't speak it regularly (I have one or two fellow Francophile friends), this is a great, useful course, especially if you are planning to travel to France. It may not bridge the cultural divide if you're Americain, but hey, we have to start somewhere.

I have yet to download the courseware onto my iPod across platforms, so I will amend this review when I do. It helps to have a desktop computer with a DVD-ROM drive as opposed to just a laptop (my situation).

The content selection of the course is helpful and the lesson menus are easy to use and navigate. The speakers, our three smiling instructors, actually look and sound French. The vocabulary and conversations cover phrases we're all dying to know: Acceptez-vous les dollars? (That's american dollars) and J'ai besoin d'un medecin (I need a doctor). It doesn't tell you what to do if you botch an order in a French restaurant, but after you take this course, you can tell the waiter (serveur) you're desolee (sorry).

200459,4,1591259886,"I try to learn a bit of the language for any foreign country I visit.  The locals like it, and I feel more like a traveler than a tourist.  In the past, I have prepared for trips abroad by using audio tape and CD language programs from Pimsleur, Lonely Planet, and Elisabeth Smith's One-Day series.  But a more portable solution is handy as well, especially when I need an in-country refresher.  For that purpose, and more, comes the iVideo Language program for the iPod or iPhone.  It's a fine aid for a visual and aural learner looking to learn some language and travel skills.

A warning: When I opened the package to begin the install, I felt something sticky on the DVD's underside.  I flipped it over, and near the center hole was a flat gob of sticky clear adhesive gel.  I'm glad I found it before inserting the DVD into my computer.  After removing the goo, I popped the DVD into my iBook G4 laptop.  As an aside, you can also play the video lessons on your Macintosh or Windows-based computer with your DVD software.  However, the audio files have the .m4b extension, which kind of locks them into the iTunes Audiobook category.

At that point I was ready to copy the files into iTunes and synch them to my 8GB iPhone.  The iPhone is a recent purchase, so I'm still learning to use it with iTunes.  Getting the files to iTunes was fairly easy, but I struggled with getting the files over to the iPhone.  Finally, I used the iTunes help function and found out i had to activate synching for TV Shows and Audiobooks in the appropriate software tab (Later, I discovered that the Penton Overseas website has a YouTube video demonstration on this process).  Once that was done, the iVideo files rapidly synched to my iPhone.  The thirty videos (around 500MB or so - I discovered later that I'd had a bit of trouble with my iPhone's synch process, so the exact size of all the files was hard to discern.  But it wasn't a showstopper.) went into the TV Shows folder.  The remaining content (approx. 30MB) went to Audiobooks.  The Audiobook category was initially absent from my iPhone, but the synch process automatically created it.

The ten video episodes are between three to five minutes each, and are split into three segments.  The first segment consists of two actors who demonstrate the use of the language. The off-screen narrator says the English word or phrase once, and one of the actors will repeat it twice in French.  The corresponding English text appears on top of the screen and the French equivalent on the bottom, both framed by a red background to make reading easier.  The second segment has the actors performing a conversation related to the previous segment's content. The final segment is like a mini Powerpoint presentation, where the off-screen narrator goes over a special topic concerning cultural and linguistic information.  In addition, after episodes 1-5 and 6-10 there is a review lesson that is meant to test your recall of the material.  An English sentence appears on the screen, and the off-screen narrator reads it once.  After a pause, the French equivalent pops onto the screen, and an off-screen French speaker repeats it twice.

After the ten video lessons, the videos move into the ""Additional"" category.  They consist of more vocabulary lessons, and there is no visual narrator.  As with the review lessons, the English and French words or phrases are listed on the screen, accompanied by verbal prompts to listen to and imitate. Their length varies, from under a minute to almost five minutes each.  To supplement the audio and video, the DVD comes with two Adobe .pdf files that you can print out for reference.  One file contains the material covered in lessons 1-12, the other lessons 13-30.  As for the Audiobook material, the material there covers additional words and phrases, and is similar in format to the Additional category of video lessons.

The two-hour, 1500+ word & phrase lesson content is more than adequate for the average traveler, with categories that include Greetings, Directions, Restaurants, and Emergency & Pharmacy (for comparison, on most typical trips you'd be doing fine if you mastered the 50 words and a few basic phrases provided by Elisabeth Smith's One-Day series). The actors appear to be native speakers, so the student will learn a competent pronunciation of the language.  Watching them speak helps engage the visual learner by showing him or her how the words are formed by a person's mouth.  Each video and audio lesson is clearly listed and easily accessed in its respective folder (Videos/TV Shows and Audiobooks), and the iPhone's controls make it easy to start, stop, pause, and rewind as needed.

Even so, I had a couple of quibbles with the program.  Yes, it was great to be able to associate written and spoken French, and see people form the words - a good use of visual and aural instruction.  But using more images that corresponded with the text and audio would've pushed the iVideo to an even higher level.  I would have been able to make a more concrete contextual visual association with the written words and audio phrases - for example, in the restaurant section to match words with entrees.  At least the actors sometimes use relevant props during the conversation segments, which are valuable in themselves as situational examples.

As for technical glitches, there were some minor ones. The iPhone screen provides adequate-size video screen for a handheld device.  However, the video portions might be pointless on a tiny iPod Nano screen, especially for folks with vision issues. Also, in the Additional category videos, the picture didn't kick in until the second word.  The first word's audio came on, but the screen was black.  Finally, I noticed later that a couple of the lessons failed to synch, so I had to go into iTunes, mark the lesson as ""New,"" and then resync to get them over to the iPhone.

Despite these issues, I recommend the iVideo package for any traveler who desires to learn some basic French, or brush up on their existing language skills.  For variety and challenge, I recommend using the iVideo French language package with some supplemental programs, especially before leaving home on your trip.  You might try Elisabeth Smith's One-Day French, which comes on CD and can be burned into iTunes and loaded on an iPod, and ""Coffee Break French,"" a number of Podcast language lessons from Scotland available for free on iTunes.

200462,4,1591259886,"I agree with much of what the other reviewers are saying about this product: namely, that it is for the casual traveler, not the serious student, and that it is well-suited for quick private lessons on your i-pod while waiting somewhere. And the casual, no-pressure tone is indeed a pleasant aspect. I also like that the words are on the screen in both English and French as you hear them spoken.

I took French for 5 years from Jr. High through High school, and in truth I was never particularly good. I was able to memorize enough grammar rules and vocabulary to pass written tests easily, but the listening portions are really what got me. I just had a terrible time differentiating the words I heard spoken and understanding the phrases. As I worked my way through these lessons, I was happy that I could hear the speakers very clearly. (How much benefit this is in the real world, where people talk quickly and in varying regional accents, I won't speculate, but when using the program in my living room and speaking basic French with my wife just for fun, it's nice.)

The only way to fully learn a language is of course to immerse yourself in it. Some people have more of a knack for language than others (I envy those people!), and some of us have to really push ourselves. What I like best about this program is how it helps to reinforce those very basic elements, from introducing yourself to finding someone who speaks English, that you would learn early in a beginner's class and that you'd need if you won't let not knowing a language stop you from traveling the world.",1205712000,,1582,4.5473684210526315

Two speakers are presented; they then begin a dialogue of the words and phrases that were individually presented to the view. It is a great way to learn the language and to show how to use the language.  I have this DVD along with another one in Italian.

7799587,4,1591259886,"Learning a new language requires one to master the alphabet, vocabulary, grammar as well as the skill of conversation, reading and writing the words and sentences that make sense. The process requires committed effort from the student. The most important thing about French is its pronunciation which is difficult to master as the spelling differs from the sound. Through this iVideo French DVD, the vocabulary and commonly used terms and sentences are explained, pronounced, announced by French speakers, allowing you to repeat and learn words in their native tonality and sound. To learn a language one must become familiar with its sound from other lips. It is not easy to find teachers who will repeat the right lines to you, but with a DVD like this, with every chapter turned into an audio-video file, you can play the files as many times as you like. I haven't progressed to the point where I can speak the language fluently or follow all of the conversation between native speakers, but I have begun to recognize sounds. One day, I will master French, but there is a lot of work to be done before that.",1263945600,,1110,4.786458333333333
7799588,5,1591259886,"I have almost every Basic French kit available and none of them give you appropiate visual aids to accompany the audio.

Cons:

1) The young French actor performance is overacted. He has an unbearable high-pitched voice. Normally, you would play the lessons hundreds of times but this guy becomes unbearable after the second play. He is on 50% of the lessons rendering half the video useless. I hope they never use him in future videos.

2) There are no visuals to help your memory. Just talking heads.

Pros:

1) Both female actresses are excellent, I hope they keep using them.
2) This video contains some of the best French pronunciation ever.
3) Eureka, someone's light bulb went on: they show you the French and the English translation at the same time. Other publishers do not show you the translation, I dare you to learn French without it.
3) Unlike other lessons, this kit does not have angry French complaining about food or about loosing their luggage at the airport. I never understood why the other publishers represent the French culture as a bunch of whiners. If you have been to France then you know the French are very gentile, fun loving and friendly.
Conclusion: This is a video for beginners and it is not perfect but it is a great step in the right direction. I am looking forward to future productions...without the annoying actor.",1232668800,,1353,4.740425531914894
7799589,4,1591259886,"iVideo French is a DVD in a plastic case which does not have anywhere to store it once you have opened it up- the original case it comes in is too flimsy, so you had better be sure you have another hard case to store it in if you order this.

When it first comes up on the screen (I ran this in a DVD player on a TV), this is what you will see:

INTRODUCTION

1.  Greetings
Basic words and phrases.  A man and woman take turns pronouncing each word twice while the English is on top and the French spelling is on bottom of the screen.  You have the option to repeat the section if you like on screen.  This is followed by a simple conversation between the man and woman, with English on top of screen and French on the bottom.

Special topic of formal and informal pronouns and verbs.  Explains the simple differences.

2.  Introductions
How to introduce yourself and meet others.  Two women say the simple words = again same format as before which is carried through the DVD.
A short conversation illustrates how two people meet each other.

Special Topic
Gender and Grammar - simple explanation of the gender of simple words.

3.  Do You Speak French
A man and woman use simple words of description which might help to determine speed, and other words that would be helpful to communicate if you want to find someone who speaks English because you can not understand much French. Bathroom words are included here.  Also phrases are included to help you understand if someone is trying to tell you that they don't speak English at all or just a little. Also words to help you tell someone to slow down a bit if they are talking too quickly.

This section is quite long compared to the previous sections.  A lot of information is covered here so it will be necessary to repeat this quite a few times.

A simple conversation happens between the young man and woman to help find someone that speaks English and find out some basic important information.  (Bathroom)

SPECIAL TOPIC
French verbs and verb forms are briefly covered here.  This is VERY basic.

4.  Directions
ASking for and understanding directions.  Two women will lead you through simple words and phrases to help you find out how to get somewhere and how to find something. This section is pretty well laid out for most things that you might need to address if you are trying to get directions.  The two women stage a conversation of someone who is lost and needs direction from the hotel to a park.

SPECIAL TOPIC
Finding conveniences.  The terms are different for things that we know in the US.  Directions are given using landmarks and numbers so be aware of this.

5.  Meeding, Wanting, Having
Terms and phrases to tell someone what you need or have.  There are some verbs shown in their base form and some phrases with the verbs already put into the proper form for the speaker.  Family terms and more restroom phrases included here.  This section is on the longer side as well.  A man and woman have a conversation which you can fill in the blanks to tell someone what you need, want, or have.  It allows you to learn the basics.

SPECIAL TOPIC
Plurals and how to make them.  This is very simple and basic.

REVIEW 1

Phrases from all five lessons are taken and you have some time to think of them on your own, they will then tell you the answer and allow you to practice.  The viewer is not urged to continue on in lessons until the first five chapters have been mastered.

There are no people visible here, just the words show on the screen to allow you to think more clearly without distraction.

6. Travel
Airports, cars, passports, trains, and taxis.  Words that you need to know to allow you to take transportation.  The conversation that is in this section allows you to discuss your documentation that you need to present in order to travel.

SPECIAL TOPIC
Travel Time, how to talk about time.

7. Hotel
Vocabulary you need for lodging.  Words and phrases to get reservations and such for lodging.  Conversation shows how to check in for a reservation using your full name.

SPECIAL TOPIC
Type of lodging that you will find in France.  Discussion of different manners of lodging- looking them up on the internet first- not much info here.

8. Restaurants
Some words relating to food and eating out.  The conversation between two women is a dining out situation in a restaurant with a waitress.

SPECIAL TOPIC
Restaurant bills and tips.

9. Shopping
Essentials for finding souvenirs and words and phrases so you can do basic shopping.  Conversation is a man and woman shopping for souvenirs to bring home to family.

SPECIAL TOPIC
Currency- how to understand Euro and credit cards.  Very brief.

10. Emergency & Pharmacy
Basic emergency terms. Theft, medical emergency, and loss words are in this section. You can also find more words of this type on the audio appendix.  Conversation is between man and woman but they are both acting out different conversations- one is a heart attack and the other is a stolen purse.

SPECIAL TOPIC
Medical and Law Enforcement.  Differences between France and US approach.

REVIEW 2

Same process as the first review section.

WHAT IS THIS PROGRAM LIKE?

Nice music reminiscent of Mr Rogers Neighborhood- rolling piano music- comes on and you are given a brief introduction of what to expect when you use the program.

There is an audio appendix and a self-print guide that you can print out via computer.

COMMENTS

You can not use the search button to speed forward through the lessons- you have to listen to each lesson completely through if you want to repeat it.  That is rather frustrating.  I would prefer to be able to forward through the lesson to get to words that I wanted to review.

Also, another thing about this program is that the people that act out the words and conversations are kind of stiff and not as fun to watch with as the Spanish program is.  It is a decent program for those who want to quickly learn French enough to survive in France for a trip.

The other advantage is that this program can be used on an Ipod.  Supposedly it can be used on MP3 too, but I have not been able to do it, so I am going to say it does not work. If I figure out how to do it, I will update this review, if possible.

I wish that this program came with a case, but I think that it is a decent introductory program to learn VERY BASIC essentials of French.

If you are looking for something more substantial, then I would look for something else like Rosetta Stone program or other more foundational French programs.

There is very scanty information on things as far as understanding the language, and I think that it is primarily repetition and learning of basic things trusting that it is going to be correct enough to get you through a trip.  If you want to learn how to translate words and such- this program will not help you.

I have given it 4 stars.  It is good for what it is, but I am not WOWed by it.

I like the fact that you can use it on portable media so you can take it with you while you travel.",1219190400,,7053,4.484657749803304
7799590,2,1591259886,"I returned, within the last month, from a trip to France. I took Spanish in high school and some Italian post-college, but beyond ""parlez-vous anglais?"" and some other basics, French isn't my language.

In preparation for my trip, however, I downloaded many episodes of a free podcast called Coffee Break French. It was not a video cast unless you subrscribed with a fee for their service, but I find them vastly superior to this program even just doing the free (non-video) subscription.

There is no introduction nor explanation in the beginning of the lessons, suddenly people are just repeating phrases (and not useful ones, in lesson one, I might add.) Another review mentioned some dubious pronounciations and I have to agree - based on what I heard in France and based on my other lessons.

I am a fairly quick language learner - I feel that I did well enough in France - but this program wouldn't have helped me near as much as my free podcast did. It just doesn't have the oomph needed to keep people interested, and in fact isn't terribly helpful. Don't waste your money if you're a beginner. I'm not even sure it would be great as a review, as it's so completely boring.

I guess I would look for just a little ""more"" - the free podcast I used had very personable people, who gave a lot more explanations about what you were saying and why, along with personal examples, differences for what a guy would say or what a girl would say, much more grammar explanations, etc. Watching two people repeat disjointed phrases just doesn't do it for me.",1215043200,2,1554,4.619565217391305
7799591,3,1591259886,"Having studied French for five years in the British education system I decided to check this out to see if this would enhance my understanding of the language. While this program is fine for those preparing to travel to France it lacks the comprehensive quality that I was looking for. It, like its Italian cousin, seems largely geared to the casual tourist and if that is you I recommend it.",1214524800,,392,4.614285714285714

Too often we Americans expect others to learn our language while we never try to learn theirs. This program can help change that impression. Try it!,1214524800,,326,4.360655737704918
