7919992,5,B00004CTW0,"My old WWF memories continue here with In Your House: It's Time. For those that may not remember but during this time, Sycho Sid had recently won the WWF Championship at Survivor Series by defeating Shawn Michaels while Bret Hart made his return to defeat Stone Cold Steve Austin in a classic wrestling match to become the number one contender for the title. Also here, the feud between Undertaker, Mankind & Paul Bearer continued here with Taker finally being able to face Bearer's bodyguard in the Executioner.

Flash Funk vs Leif Cassidy. It's interesting to mention that this was a battle between two ECW veterans as for those that don't know, Cassidy is actually Al Snow. Anyways, this was a good match to start the show as this was a better effort than you would expect from Cassidy while Funk showed here why he has been considered one of the most underrated performers in perhaps all of professional wrestling.

WWF Tag Team Champions Owen Hart & British Bulldog vs fake Razor Ramon & fake Diesel. The reason I wrote ""fake"" is because these two characters weren't the originals as the original characters in Scott Hall & Kevin Nash were in WCW by this point in time. This was a decent match that was really more about pushing storylines as Stone Cold Steve Austin made a cameo appearance here & had a confrontation with the Bulldog while at the same time continuing the tension between Owen & Bulldog.

Intercontinental Champion Hunter Hearst Helmsley vs Marc Mero. After these two have been going at it all year long, this was Mero's final chance to get his hands on Hunter & reclaim the Intercontinental title. This was a solid encounter that had Mero show some of his athleticism that he had during this point while Hunter continued to improve in the ring. However, the real issue here was the appearance of Goldust that not only lead to Mero winning the match but not the title but also to begin his feud with Hunter over Marlena.

Armageddon Rules Match: The Undertaker vs The Executioner. The rules to this match was that there would be No Disqualifications & to win the match, you would need to pin your opponent & if that person can't answer the count of ten then the match is over. For it's time, this was a wild hardcore match as they brawled around the ring, to the backstage area to eventually going outside to the point where Taker threw Executioner down a flight of stairs into a pool. Another moment to check out would be Taker throwing Mankind through the In Your House set & even tossing him through the door. This isn't the most hardcore match you will ever see but it was entertaining for what it was.

WWF Champion Sycho Sid vs Bret Hart. Shawn Michaels was outside doing commentary for this match & was really doing what he does best & that was be very comical & controversial. For anyone that has followed Bret's career, he is one of the few wrestlers that is capable of bringing out the best performance out of bigger men & that was the case here as this was one of Sid's best matches throughout his career. Bret worked on Sid's back to keep the big man down & even wear him out with ground attacks while Sid was looking to out-power Bret with his size. Along with a cameo from Stone Cold Steve Austin & HBK getting involved in the end, this was a very good match between these two that also did a good job in continuing the Bret/Austin & Shawn/Sid feuds as well as the Bret/Shawn feud catching some fire here.

Overall, this was one of the best In Your House events that the WWF has put out as this event didn't have any fillers & most of the matches here were good quality so for two hours, you were satisfied so I would highly recommend this event...if you can find a copy of this event.",1243728000,,3721,4.497041420118343
7919993,5,B00004CTW0,"Thanks to an old tape I found in a box, I relived an old PPV from the In Your House PPV series in 1996 subtitled ""It's Time."" Now for those who don't remember the original In Your House PPV series, they were only 2 hours long at a cheap price (less than $20) and were the filler events inbetween WWE's (then WWF) big PPV's like Royal Rumble, WrestleMania, King Of The Ring, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series. During this time, Bret Hart was the #1 contendor for the WWF by defeating Steve Austin at Survivor Series while Sycho Sid was the new WWF champion by defeating Shawn Michaels at the same event.  At the same time, Bret wasn't the only member of the Hart Family Austin had issues with as he got into an altercation with British Bulldog weeks earlier resulting in those two fighting it out as well.

Flash Funk vs Leif Cassidy - The battle of two ECW alumni here as the former 2 Cold Scorpio went one on one against the real life Al Snow.  This was a good opening match as this was probably the best singles match Flash had in the WWE as he showcased why he's was so underrated & underpushed.  The moment to look out for here however was Flash's entrance when you saw Vince McMahon turn into Dick Clark with his dancing at the announce table.

Tag Team Championships Owen Hart & British Bulldog vs. ""Diesel"" & ""Razor Ramon"" - For those who don't remember, this wasn't Scott Hall & Kevin Nash wrestling under the names of Razor & Diesel but two new guys that WWE decided to give the gimmicks to (with Diesel being played by the wrestler currently known as Kane) with Jim Ross constantly putting these wrestlers over as part of his attempted heel turn that never got over & was dropped within a month.  Overall, this was just an average match that was just a filler to continue the issues with between Austin & the Bulldog along with plug the fact that wrestlers from the AAA promotion in Mexico (two who made an appearence during the match) were going to be in the Royal Rumble the next month.

WWF Intercontinental Champion Hunter Hearst-Helmsley vs. Marc Mero - This was Marc Mero's rematch after Helmsley (with help from Mr. Perfect) screwed Mero out of the championship two months earlier.  This was a very good athletic contest between both men & possibly their best match against each other.  However, the real story here was the appearence of Goldust based off something that happened earlier in the night between Helmsley & Goldust's manager Marlena that resulted in Mero winning the battle but not the gold.

Armageddon Rules Match: Undertaker vs. Executioner - This was glorified No Disqualification match between Undertaker & Paul Bearer's bodyguard in the Executioner (played by the late Terry Gordy of the Freebirds).  This wasn't as wild as the later hardcore matches would be but it definately was crazy for it's time as they would fight in the ring all the way to the outside of the arena at one point where the Executioner ended up falling into the water on the outside of the arena. Mankind even made an appearence that resulted in pepper spray, a straightjacket, and really ""tearing the house down.""  For it's time, this was an all over the place match.

WWF Champion Sycho Sid vs. Bret Hart - Shawn Michaels was set to face the winner of this match at the Royal Rumble & did commentary during this match was back to his usual ""controversal"" self on the headset.  Looking at his matches with the likes of Yokozuna & Bam Bam Bigelow & Kevin Nash & Undertaker, you know that Bret Hart has the ability to work with large men and give them one of the best matches in their career..this was no exception.  While it wasn't a classic match, it was a good main event overall with Bret doing his usual ""bring him down to my size"" offense by working on the legs.  With a cameo appearence from Steve Austin along with Shawn getting involved in the end, it was a very good main event and one of the best Sid matches I've seen during what was maybe the best run of his entire career.

In the end, this wasn't the normal ""filler"" In Your House PPV as it finished off long term storylines (HHH/Mero, Taker/Executioner) while advancing others (Sid/Shawn/Bret/Austin) and planting the seeds for future feuds & plans for WWE (HHH/Goldust, cross promotion leading into the Royal Rumble).  This is one event I would recommend as it was one of the best In Your House events they've had.",1240531200,,4387,4.559796437659033
