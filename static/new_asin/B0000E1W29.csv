8001612,3,B0000E1W29,"I love this series, although I have yet to finish it. But the price, everywhere, is generally horrible. There's only a few episodes on each disc and they want $15+ for them! And there's a lot of discs in this series. I started watching this when I found it at Blockbuster Online. However, I didn't check to make sure they had all the discs. Ha, ha, I just assumed they would have all the discs in a series! But no, apparently they don't do that. Erg. Anyway, several of the discs were missing, labeled ""Coming Soon"". They've been saying that for months now. Anyway, I broke down and bought this disc used from one of the Amazon Marketplace and what with shipping it still ended up costing me about $15.
This is why I don't own alot of anime. It's a ripoff.",1202256000,,756,4.330985915492958
8001613,5,B0000E1W29,"Wow, this is a weird bunch of characters in this DVD!  Tsukushi is a great character; strong, opinionated, brave....The rest, I'm not so sure how much I can relate to them, or even believe that they could be real.  But I think that part of this series is that most things are taking to the extremes.

The 3rd volume continues the story very nicely.  Shizuka invites Tsukushi to her birthday party and makes a startling announcement; she's moving back to Paris permantly.  What will Rui do?  Well, I don't want to say and ruin the story for anyone who hasn't seen it.  Also on this volume, the relationship (or aquaintance?) between Tsukushi and Tsubasa is further explored.

I know it's melodramatic.  I know it is fairly farfetched.  But I can't help watching it, I'm addicted to the series.  I can't wait to find out what's behind Tsubasa's attitude toward Tsukushi.  Whether or not Rui will forget about Shizuka, and who Tsukushi winds up with.  This is a great series, and I recommend it to any fan of shoujo anime.",1084752000,,1019,4.625698324022347
