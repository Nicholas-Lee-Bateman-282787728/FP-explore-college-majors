I could almost imagine myself in their situation, which would have been very scary.  Excellent and entertaining.",1411084800,2,247,4.674418604651163

5962158,1,B00F0C2NCG,"12 people who appear to be already dead are placed together in a room where they must judge the most guilty and most innocent, with only one getting a ""second chance."" They must kill someone every 12 minutes or else it will be done for them, which would have been my one and only option. Some of the people are a preacher, Air Force member, robber, CEO, lawyer, cop, banker, mom etc. all the usual suspects. Their stories were pretty bad and their story telling was worse. The acting was sad all around as I was hoping they would all die slow horrible deaths. A rather pointless film.

Difficult to sit through. Doesn't work as a rental.

8611062,2,B00F0C2NCG,"The movie has a familiar plot... The acting is luke warm. An attempt to make awesome out of content that is only 1/2 thought out. So many chances to take it to greater lengths, but the movie always seems to stop short and let down. Nothing special, in my opinion.",1421193600,,263,4.28
8611063,5,B00F0C2NCG,I love these kind of movies that take place in one area with an insane plot,1419724800,,75,3.75
8611064,1,B00F0C2NCG,"Don't be fooled into thinking this is some great ensemble movie.  No, this is just an excuse for a bunch of bad actors to get paid.  A bunch of people are chained in a room.  Someone selects 12 of them to play our newest game show.  Sorry about the ones not selected as your consolation prize is ... you get killed.  Except,  well, I don't want to give away too much yet.  The twelve selected are in a room with chairs and a table and a knife and gun.  The game?  Only one gets to leave alive.  They have 15 (or something like that) minutes to decide among themselves who gets killed.  And you won't care.  And you'll feel cheated when you discover at the end, it never really mattered because the game was rigged.  This isn't horror, and it doesn't even work as a good slasher flick.  There's no tension, no excitement, no real plot.  A total waste of Eric Roberts.  But he got paid.",1414281600,,884,4.234939759036145
8611065,4,B00F0C2NCG,I thought this was pretty good. I love Horror flicks and since there aren't many greats like the classic films it's hard to find the gems. This one had a pretty good twist to it that I enjoyed.,1413417600,,193,4.105263157894737
8611066,5,B00F0C2NCG,"It's a subgenre still looking for a name. Killing Game movies is my suggestion. In it I can think of Would You Rather, Die, The Exam and now The Devil's Dozen. This had the feeling of a theater piece more than a movie to me. You get a sense that everything is set in this chamber that resonates sound and emotional energy alike. Everything's claustrophobic and tense. The dialogue isn't great, and it's far too explicative, and you have to suspend your disbelief that twelve people in this sort of situation would remain this chatty. I would be peeing my pants and crying like a baby for the whole stretch, man.
But what matters is the drama. The game is cleverly designed on the basis of twelve-minute intervals, which I'm pretty sure were done out in real time. Every twelve minutes, someone else kicks the bucket, whether by murder or by defaultif nobody kills someone else, a random person just drops dead.
It's so good that it needs no clever, fun, nasty, mischievous twist ending. Oh, but it has one. A big fat juicy one.
If you don't enjoy this sort of movie, don't even try. But if you do, just sit back and savor.",1412035200,3,1122,4.478048780487805
