6755778,5,B00OL2G962,"I was lucky enough to see this film on the big screen in New York City.  An amazingly heart warming and touching look into the difficulties and the rewards of family interactions delivered in extremely entertaining and enjoyable adventure.
A must see!!!!",1415059200,,254,5.0476190476190474
6755779,5,B00OL2G962,I saw this movie during the theatrical run and can't wait to own a copy. It is a new classic that I look forward to watching again and again. It is heartwarming and poignant but just before turning down the path towards predictable and trite The Discovers always takes a welcome left turn and leaves you laughing at the absurdity of life and the joy we can find in unlikely places with unexpected companions.,1414454400,,408,4.527027027027027
6755780,5,B00OL2G962,Beautiful cinematography.  Family dysfunction at its best.  Warm and funny.  Every character is worth knowing.  I was lucky to see it on the big screen in NY -- so glad to now add it to my video library!,1414195200,3,203,4.2631578947368425
6755781,5,B00OL2G962,I saw this film at the Philadelphia film Festival. It's everything the critics said and much more! I must see for anyone who has a dysfunctional family! A great gift for anyone!!,1414108800,3,178,4.59375
6755782,5,B00OL2G962,"Great acting, great story, great score. Funny. Touching. Everything you want an independent film to be. And it delivers.",1414108800,2,120,5.368421052631579

6755784,5,B00OL2G962,"""The Discoverers"" is a smart, heartfelt, and funny road movie with great performances from Griffin Dunne, Madeleine Martin, and Stuart Margolin. It is beautifully filmed and explores the themes of family, nature, history, second-chances, and personal discovery in a most entertaining way. Definitely a must see.",1414108800,3,311,5.782608695652174
6755785,5,B00OL2G962,A beautiful film. An inspiring and heartwarming story. A must see family movie.,1413936000,3,79,5.153846153846154
6755786,3,B00OL2G962,Silly in most scenes but with a story that has meaning.,1456617600,,55,4.090909090909091
6755787,5,B00OL2G962,What movie can make you cry and laugh and at the same time! This is a great movie I highly recommend! I'm surprised this movie hasn't gotten more stars. Great movie!,1455753600,,165,4.354838709677419
6755788,4,B00OL2G962,"The Discoverers deserves wider recognition as a genuinely thoughtful and well-constructed film. The movie is a very personal take on history and relationships with the Lewis and Clark expedition as a reference point and backdrop. Griffin Dunne plays an academic who is engaged in the simultaneous efforts to respond constructively to his teenage children, come to terms with aging and dying parents, and move to some kind of fruition in his career. The film score is one of the movie's strengths with its use of quiet and reflective themes often performed on acoustic instruments with pitch-perfect placement.

The tone of the film combines the absurdly funny with the highly serious and heartfelt parts of life. The relationship between the father and daughter characters is quite well done, and their progression and cooperation is fun to watch. This is not a fast-moving or flashy film, but it does have some very nice use of the film medium with its presentation of the golden fall colors of the forest and the movements in and out of civilization. I am really happy to own a copy of this film and have already shared it with several friends and family members. If you want to slow down and catch a quirky but enjoyable film with a worthwhile take on history and humanity, take a look at the Discoverers.",1455321600,,1308,4.839285714285714
6755789,5,B00OL2G962,Really enjoyed this movie and watching the family members realize that they really didn't know each other very well at all. Makes one think about how well they know the people in their lives. The family does a great job of making the best of all the comical situations that they find themselves in.,1450656000,,298,4.537037037037037

6755791,5,B00OL2G962,"Great story. Funny in parts, serious in others. Well acted. All in all a great move.",1442275200,,84,4.3125
6755792,3,B00OL2G962,Good acting in a dysfunctional family road trip movie. Griffin Dunne is good in a sad-sack Steve Carell type of role. The kids look like real people instead of movie stars. The story is lacking; it hovers between a drama and a comedy without really committing to either. Slow throughout with an understated message about hope and resolving things with your family by actually spending time with them.,1437955200,2,400,4.897058823529412
6755793,5,B00OL2G962,I was moved by this film when I saw it in the theater and just now sent it to my dad for Father's Day.  Any father and son could relate to the tensions played out so deftly in this story.  It should be shared and enjoyed.,1434672000,,221,3.782608695652174
6755794,3,B00OL2G962,There was nothing about this movie that made me want to continue after the halfway point.  I may try to finish it when I'm in a different mood to see if I get a different perspective.,1430870400,,183,4.083333333333333
6755795,3,B00OL2G962,Slow...not great.,1427328000,,17,8.0

6755797,3,B00OL2G962,"If you liked Little Miss Sunshine, you'll like this. I was actually stunned to realize that it was not the same group of creators involved in this one.
Unfortunately, I wasn't interested in watching Little Miss Sunshine 2, so I'm only giving it 3 stars.",1426291200,,253,4.644444444444445
6755798,5,B00OL2G962,"this is just plain straight out fun , i loved this movie",1423008000,,56,3.75
6755799,2,B00OL2G962,This was included in the comedy genre. Where was the humor? This movie was very slow and flat-lined from the beginning.,1420588800,,119,4.714285714285714
6755800,1,B00OL2G962,"I liked the actors acting, but the plot is so poorly written and  the story line is stupid and ridiculous.  Too bad, because I wanted to really like it, but it was a colossal waste of time.",1420156800,,189,4.081081081081081
6755801,2,B00OL2G962,"This is a dreary story of a dreary family vacation gone awry. The description that claims it is ""hilarious"" is totally misleading. Dull performances--though the story is the truly dull feature--and dull indie quality production values. Give it a pass.",1419206400,,251,5.3
6755802,5,B00OL2G962,"A soulful journey into the art of the relationship as seen through this sometimes comical, sometimes sad estranged family unit. Griffin Dunne and Stuart are magnificent.... well acted by all, great direction and poetic story line, make this film a must see.",1418256000,,257,5.142857142857143
6755803,5,B00OL2G962,Sweet movie - and the music is terrific!,1418169600,,40,4.125
6755804,1,B00OL2G962,Very foul language right from the begining!! We got into it about 5 minutes and shut it off!!!,1418083200,2,94,4.277777777777778
6755805,5,B00OL2G962,Great movie. Original plot,1417910400,,26,5.75
6755806,5,B00OL2G962,I was lucky enough to be a small part of this movie.  I'm glad because it is a great movie and a good movie to watch as a family.,1417737600,,129,3.4482758620689653
6755807,1,B00OL2G962,"This movie was horrible and NOT at all ""hilarious"" as billed.  Not one laugh.  Ten minutes into it I wanted my money back.",1417478400,,122,4.260869565217392
6755808,1,B00OL2G962,This was two hours of my life I can't get back. I thought it was terrible.,1417392000,,74,3.6875
6755809,5,B00OL2G962,"Is there a more appealing actor in the industry than Griffin Dunne (so good as the ex-patriot doctor down in Mexico who gave Matt the drugs in ""Dallas Byers Club)? Madeline Martin, so good on stage in ""August: Osage County,"" turns out , reads great on film. This is the sort of movie which would only be possible now, with digital process, made on the cheap, character driven, small, sensitive, but not sticky, and for the most part, it works like a charm.",1417219200,,456,4.506024096385542

6755811,4,B00OL2G962,"The storyline was a real downer at the beginning, but turned around and redeemed itself. Good acting and worth seeing.",1416441600,,118,4.95
6755812,2,B00OL2G962,"The Amazon player worked very well.
Listed as a family movie, and reviewers stating this as a family movie convinced me to rent this even though I couldn't find a rating for this film anywhere on the internet.
That was a mistake.
The scenery/cinematography was beautiful.
The music was subtle and lighthearted.
The acting was believable and good.
The overall story was engaging.
Unfortunately the movie was marred by the foul language, which consisted of:
5 - 'F' words (the fifth one is garbled, but the viewer clearly knows what was said).
2 - 'S' words
1 - 'A' word
1 - 'D' word
3 - drug use scenes (smoking pot)
2 - references to sex (one of which is a profane choice of words to describe oral.s)
This is a movie ABOUT a family, NOT a family movie.
Would not recommend this film to anyone.",1416355200,5,793,4.438356164383562
6755813,1,B00OL2G962,Listed as a family movie by Amazon but contains quite a few expletives.  Watched it with my kids and had to turn it off after 10 minutes.,1416182400,4,137,4.074074074074074
6755814,3,B00OL2G962,"Okay but nothing to write home about...  the dysfunction is the story line, not very believable... even in a time of crisis. There are some silly or stupid parts/character that are very irritating, like a glaring continuity error and didn't allow me to sink into the experience.  The family its self, the father with his two children, are good together.  They seem to have honest interactions, I could have watched more of just them... refreshing that there were no grand epiphanies, no insightful breakthroughs... problems were not tied up in a pretty bow at the end.  The one redeeming aspect... the daughter, actor Madeline Martin, was fun to watch, loved her moody teenage angst and she had some very clever lines -- she is the redeeming aspect of the film... I'll remember her.",1415923200,,782,4.857142857142857
6755815,5,B00OL2G962,This is a wonderful story about father reconnecting with his father and with his kids. Quirky in that they use a reenacted Lewis & Clark discovery trek for context. Griffin Dunne does a great job playing the father.,1415664000,,215,4.684210526315789
8684087,4,B00OL2G962,"Loved how characters developed simply, purposely with slight humor and drama.",1532736000,,77,6.090909090909091

8684093,4,B00OL2G962,"We always enjoy anything by Griffin Dunne. You might more enjoy this tale if you are History Buffs or Reenactors, or have a Lewis and Clarke interest. Very funny little comedy about how life goes on.",1473552000,,199,4.555555555555555
8684094,5,B00OL2G962,"Nice.  Liked it more than expected too. Basically a funny, sentimental, dysfunctional family story.",1468108800,,99,6.071428571428571
8684095,5,B00OL2G962,"A family drama with both sweet and sour moments, exactly as many of us experience our own families. No fears, there's comedy to be had, as well. And if you're a Californication fan missing Becca Moody and hoping for one last fix, you'll get it here. I discovered The Discoverers searching for more from Madeleine Martin and, while I hope she doesn't deliver a performance like this so often that she lives to regret it, she brings exactly the tone and the characterization to this part that she regularly delivered in Californication.",1460764800,2,534,4.815217391304348
