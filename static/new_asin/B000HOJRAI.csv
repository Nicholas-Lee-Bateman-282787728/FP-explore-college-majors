8482062,5,B000HOJRAI,"this ""box set"" is actually 4 individual DVDs packaged together: Iggy & The Stooges: Live in Detroit (the reunion concert), The New York Dolls: All Dolled Up, The Dead Boys: Live at CBGBs 1977, and Mc5: Kick Out the Jams. Nothing added, no bonus features, all 4 of these DVDs are all available individually. Of course, they are all excellent, and buying this set saves you some money (especially on shipping if you are ordering online), but the description is vague and so I just thought I would point this out in case anybody is expecting unreleased material by these bands.",1167436800,26,574,4.693069306930693
