4428671,5,B004M5HJQC,This movie is a great one for teaching other kids (AND ADULTS!) about disabilities.  The stories are poignant yet the short format is great for a class period.,1384473600,,159,4.678571428571429
4428672,5,B004M5HJQC,"This short film showcases children with ""learning differences"".  Not learning disabilities but instead differences.  Each of the children featured has gone through a difficult time at school with teachers and fellow students not able to understand why they learn in a different way. However, once you view this you will see the way they overcome these differences and achieve just as much as the other children, if not more. Teachers should not miss this.  It will help them to be more understanding and give them the opportunity to learn what so called ""special ed"" children really need, i.e, the same thing all children need..a chance ,love, and patience.",1371686400,3,657,5.064814814814815
4428673,5,B004M5HJQC,"Allowing us into their lives cannot have been an easy decision, but the young people who allow the camera to follow them around are heroes to a generation of kids who face the same issues.  All involved are very brave and open, families and teachers, do very well in discussing the learning difficulties faced.  This little program will stand as a testimony to the courage and perseverance of all involved.  A wonderful insight for families battling the stigma of learning difficulties, and an eye opener for many teachers whose training often does not even touch of these oh so common problems.  A great resource for teacher training courses.",1365120000,,643,4.925925925925926
4428674,5,B004M5HJQC,As a Dyslexia Consultant I recommend watching this movie! Great insight! Allows people to see things from the perspective of the children. I enjoyed it very much and will be showing it to my parents of my students.,1355011200,,214,4.657894736842105
4428675,5,B004M5HJQC,"I bought this DVD for my daughter to watch and to share with others.  Since my daughter has dyslexia it was encouraging for her to see how other children with learning differences handled their issues.  Those of us who don't have learning issues sometimes take for granted that school is easy, and we don't have any perspective on what it's like to struggle with things that others grasp easily.  It was especially encouraging to see the other ways LD children focus their talents.

The film was a good short length, which meant that we could watch the whole thing and not get bogged down.  A good documentary for LD and non-LD alike.",1322352000,7,634,4.625
4428676,5,B004M5HJQC,"As a professor of Special Education, I was amazed to see this wonderful documentary that gave viewers insight into how if feels to be misunderstood and thought of as lazy or unteachable.  This 30 minute DVD is shown through the eyes and voices of children with a variety of learning difficulties who relate their experiences in very thoughtful and amazing clarity.  Every person who is going into the field of education should see this DVD.  I will be showing this to all of my students.",1308009600,9,487,4.705882352941177
4428677,5,B004M5HJQC,This amazing video is a real eye opener on children who are mislabeled as slow or lazy learners.  Some children just need a different way to learn.  These bright energetic kids sometime suffer the unnecessary consequences of being looked over and even called stupid. Each one of these children were able to find the right help to be successful and enjoy school instead of dreading it.  Every parent and teacher should watch this video and learn from it.,1301616000,5,453,4.782051282051282
