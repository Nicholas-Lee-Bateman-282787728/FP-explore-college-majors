7823925,5,6302296692,"Esta Salome, junto a la de Maria Ewing es indudablemente una de las obras maestras del canto y de la escenografa. La danza de los siete velos de Maria es insustituible; la de este video es igualmente admirable. Solamente quisiera agregar que lo nico malo de este video es sto, que es un video y no un DVD. Por favor hagan lo imposible para que esta excelente versin de Salome se emitida en un futuro en un DVD. La venta mundial podemos predecir que sera admirable. Esto por supuesto sucede con otras obras maestras, no solamente de R. Strauss sino tambin de otros grandes compositores, por ejemplo Las Bodas de Figaro con una juvenil Maria Ewing que creo que no est disponible ya. Un DVD de esta pera maravillosa igualmente tendra venta mundial asegurada. Gracias por su atencin y esfuerzos eventuales a estas peticiones. Felicitaciones de paso a Amazon por sus maravillosas disponibilidades.",1072396800,,892,4.836601307189542
7823926,5,6302296692,"In reading recommendations for introducting people to opera, I have yet to see anyone mention Richard Strauss' 1905 masterpiece ""Salome."" People usually suggest something by Verdi, Puccini, or Bizet's  ""Carmen."" I guess the old stereotype of German opera as being  ""too heavy"" for most people still seems pervasive. In my opinion,  however, ""Salome"" provides the perfect introduction to opera.  Approximately the same length as a standard feature film (and with  excellent pacing compacted into one act), it contains may elements that  would appeal to contemporary sensibilities: erotic matters (Yes, there was  sex in 1905; my grandmother was born that year, after all.), dysfunctional  family life (worse than anything the Fox network could conjure up), and so  on. As the perfect synthesis of syrupy Romanticism and cold Modernism, the  savage violence beneath the sensual tenderness of ""Salome""  provides listeners with delicious aural pleasures.
From the opening's  mysterious nocturnal chords to Salome's shattering musical orgasm, this  interpretation is a potent listening and viewing experience. Under the  direction of Giuseppe Sinopoli, the Orchester der Deutsche Oper Berlin play  with red rapture, sighing, moaning, screaming with Salome's ecstasy over  the holy man Jochanaan (a.k.a. John the Baptist).
Catherine Malfitano  ranks with Hildegard Behrens and Teresa Stratas as the best Salome. She  does not sing it with the large voice of a Wagnerian soprano, which is not  right for the role anyway. As Strauss himself wryly commented, a sixteen  year old with the voice of an Isolde would be ideal. (Start working those  vocal chords, Brittney.) Simon Estes makes a formidable Jochanaan, and  doesn't wander about in the usual camel hair get-up and hokey fake beard  associated with the role. Other acting high points include Leonie Rysanek  (a former Salome herself) and Horst Hiestermann as Herodias and Herod,  Salome's outspoken mother and lecherous stepfather. They provide edgy comic  relief, with Herodias making fun of her husband's lust for his  stepdaughter, and Herod acting like a pathetic basket case. To paraphrase  an erstwhile T-shirt, they put the fun in dysfunctional.
Several months  ago, I showed this video to an interested, though somewhat skeptical,  female companion. She ended up enjoying it very much. I hope that if you  try ""Salome,"" it will give you as much pleasure as it gave us.",960681600,,2425,5.403743315508021
