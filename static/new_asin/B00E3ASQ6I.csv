8600509,1,B00E3ASQ6I,"Wendy seems to have simply researched Google for basic DR info and made an expensive product out if it. There's very little explanation about proper form. Wendy fails to explain the correct way to contract the TVA from origin to insertion. It took my one session with a physical therapist to learn that I was doing it wrong. The ""Alignment Reminders"" sections are rushed and useless.",1408233600,3,383,4.818181818181818
8600510,4,B00E3ASQ6I,"I've been looking for some videos and information on diastasis recti and purchased (and reviewed) several. Although this one isn't perfect. It is by far the best of the lot.

I'll start by explaining my situation. I'm 3 years post partum and have a 2 finger diastasis. I run, do Insanity and P90X etc. I'm treating the diastasis like physical therapy and want a 10-15 minute daily routine to do. I have other outlets (see above) for cardio and strength.

I got:
--a FitSplint (as recommended by my physical therapist neighbor) to wear during exercise. She was clear to point out that I shouldn't wear it all day as some programs (like Tupler) say you should because you can weaken the abs.
--Lindsey Brin's Core Firing Sequence. This has 5 star reviews on Amazon but doesn't address Diastasis (only mentioning it to say ""this exercise is not safe for diastasis recti""). AND she does crunches and I'm completely unclear on how to safely do them (supposedly there is a ""right way"" so that it doesn't aggrevate DR) so I spend a bit of time modifying. The length is good (about 6 minutes), actually a little short so I started doing Phase 2 and 3 back to back but since I was modifying... I didn't think I was getting anything out of it that I didn't get out of Insanity and P90X (plank, side plank, superman, etc)
--BounceBack Fast by Helene Byrne. This one has the BEST information for form and specifically addresses diastasis recti at last. BUT the format isn't conducive to daily use and the length (30 min) is a turn off. WIthout the instruction and chatter it would probably be closer to 15-20 minutes, which falls in my PT daily goal, but there is no condensed/fast track/simplified routine.

So finally I saw this MuTu focus program go on sale and I snatched it up. This video has the best balance of info and accessibility. The routines are phased and about 10 minutes long - something I can do as PT daily. I have all of the ""equipment"" needed (such as resistance bands, balls, etc) . Wendy's voice is NOT irritating (I failed to mention both Brin and Byrne have voices and mannerisms that grate on my nerves, making watching the videos all the less enticing), in fact, it's purely conversational. She demonstrates the moves well and they are effective.

The only reason I docked a star for this DVD is the price:quality ratio. The content is perfect and just what I needed. But the format is pretty lame. The music is uninspired and the video is poorly shot. It's just Wendy with a white-out background and floor. It gets the job done, but it's a far cry from the BeachBody DVDs I've gotten used to. Certainly there was enough money in the budget to go into some hardwood floor studio for an hour? No? At any rate, between that and the tiny pamphlet with tiny photos I can't see justifying the $67 (sixty seven dollar) price tag. I picked it up on sale at $37 (thirty seven dollars) and I thought, ""wow, that's a lot of money for a single DVD."" I went with Focus over the 12-week program because I felt I didn't need the get fit workouts since I was running and doing Insanity etc. If those workouts are shot with this video quality, I'm super glad I didn't make the investment. Yikes.

I guess in the end, I'd recommend this even if it weren't on sale because it has the content that I want in the form that best suits my needs. But I'd imagine they'd sell more if they dropped the price point.",1397606400,10,3403,4.491114701130856
8600511,4,B00E3ASQ6I,I'm confused. I got the DVD and it was thorough but 85 dollars for just that? It was a gift so I'm not sure if there was something else I needed to download?,1388707200,3,157,3.787878787878788
8600512,5,B00E3ASQ6I,"I came across the MuTu website while researching Diastasis Recti after having my second child. I started the program and had great improvement in core strength and closing the gap. I also gained a wealth of knowledge of why it happens. She includes a whole ""science bit"" for those who want to learn more. I continued with some of the Focus moves during my pregnancy with my third child. Some of the stretches really helped me to relax. I also loved the online community where you can feel part of a larger group of women who understand you, when you feel alone in your journey. I have also done the older 12 week program and am currently repeating it now that my little one is about 3 months old.",1384128000,3,696,4.403100775193798
8600513,5,B00E3ASQ6I,"I am very happy that I decided to purchase MuTu Focus! I am about 3/4 through the program right now and very pleased with the results!

I previously have tried a few other methods to get my belly looking nice again after two babies, and this has been the most effective and most enjoyable! I love that this program runs on an 8-week guideline, but lets you know which criteria must be met before you can move forward. This might mean that it takes you longer than 8 weeks to get through it, but it's SO important to do the exercises correctly!

I view Focus as a sort of physical therapy. It's not one of those crazy whip-your-butt-into-shape kind of things. The tone of MuTu is very positive, and encourages you to treat your body well as it heals from the major transformations that pregnancy and childbirth brought. Doing the exercises daily and mindfully is key. You won't get results if you don't do the work!

There is also a very supportive online community with an active facebook group for moms who have purchased the product. Lots of great conversations and support there! And Wendy (the creator) will personally answer questions that come up.

I highly recommend this program! I finally feel like my body looks nice again!",1380067200,10,1233,4.6422018348623855
8600514,5,B00E3ASQ6I,"I have had DR since the birth of my son, 4 years ago, and it only worsened after my daughter, now 19 months, was born. Having had back pain from the weak core and being unhappy with my poochy tummy, I was game to try whatever it was that promised it would help. In all honesty, I did see results with other programs but they never lasted, and/or were so difficult and time-demanding that it became clear from very early on that a busy mom could simply not keep up. And feeling like a failure is not anything any new mom needs to feel.

Enter MUTU and its reasonable 10-15 minute daily exercises, and a reasurring team of Mamas who 'get it' backing you up, and I am one happy customer!  Imagine my surprise when, within the first month of doing Mutu Focus, my DR goes from almost 4 fingers to now about 1.5 fingers. Midline is stronger, and I can finally get up and down without grunting, and suddenly lugging my kids in and out of their carseats doesn't hurt and certainly doesn't feel like such a chore.

I have work still left, but since starting in May, I have gained strength, shrunk my DR, improved my posture, and even slimmed my waist. I look forward to my daily walks. I look forward to my stretches. I look forward to it all, because I KNOW the results are here to stay! And I am mighty proud of myself for FINALLY doing something for myself (come on, you moms can relate.)

Highly recommend MUTU Focus! You will NOT be disappointed!",1379980800,22,1442,4.32962962962963
