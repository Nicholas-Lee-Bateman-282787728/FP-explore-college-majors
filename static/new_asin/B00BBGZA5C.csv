5570252,5,B00BBGZA5C,"Saw this movie on TCM, and had to have it!! Fantastic footage of San Francisco in the mid 50's.",1413849600,,95,4.052631578947368
5570253,4,B00BBGZA5C,"""The Lineup"", a movie spun from a popular mid-century tv show of the same name, takes off from the first scene, when a stolen briefcase is handed off to a waiting taxi, who then takes off and in his hurry, rams a tractor truck pulling out of a nearby pier---pulling out of that crash, the cabbie then hits a policeman, who manages to get off one successful shot, and the dead cabbie crashes into a bit of waterfront construction----the police then discover the man was carrying drugs, and as the investigation widens, that innocent tourists and businessmen returning from the far east are being used as unsuspecting mules.

The filming was not great---I had to stop the film to identify exactly where they were----that Pier 41 is long gone; and recognizable buildings in the background are only hazily captured.  Still, once they get away from the Wharf, the cinematography improves.  The cops are played by a couple of middle aged rumpled looking actors, and no one in the film has the glossy flossy beauty everyone has to have today.  The story is interesting and plausible, with the added feature that, for people who've been to San Francisco, one gets some great views of a long vanished landscape, from the interior of Sutro Baths to the double decked Embarcadero Freeway, and the YMCA.  And there's a seemingly obligatory chase scene----this one being more ridiculous than others, hopping back and forth from the Golden Gate Bridge to the Bay Bridge, for no good reason, but hey!

It's not quite like the cop films we've come to expect, that began with ""Bullitt"" and moved on to ""Starsky and Hutch"" and ""Dirty Harry"".  But that's a bit refreshing, especially in an age where the genre has everything from Brothers Grimm characters haunting Seattle and Ichabod Crane back from the dead to fight evil in modern day Sleepy Hollow.  If you like noir, you may have already seen this, if you haven't, you should.",1406332800,3,1912,4.7902735562310035
5570254,5,B00BBGZA5C,"This was a great old movie that I missed when it was first released. So good to go back and find a gem like this. I listened to The Lineup on radio drama when I was a pre-teen, and never missed the show. Truth is, I never knew about the movie until I recently ran across it on Amazon, and had to have. It brought back all those great memories of the radio drama. Lots of fun.",1405555200,,375,3.883116883116883
5570255,5,B00BBGZA5C,"** This review may contain spoilers ***

Awesome old film noir that boasts an impressive collection of bad guys (Richard Jaeckel as a dipsomaniacal wheelman, Eli Wallach as a psychopathic bagman enforcer).  A mysterious heroin kingpin called ""the man"", Robert Keith as a vicious but intelligent mentor to Eli Wallach (Robert Keith, you'll know as Richard Kimble's father in ""The Fugitive"" and episodes of ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"") he likes to write ""last, or end quotes"" from the people Eli Wallach murders in a little black book.), a suave trench coat wearing fingerman, and a couple of really dry and boring, but procedural, head cops.

This is a ""daytime"" film noir.  Eli Wallach is superb as a bad guy.

Good locations as well in the San Francisco area, a city where I lived.  The Veterans Building (opened in 1932) in the Civic Center Historic District, the Mark Hopkins Hotel (1926) on Nob Hill, Cliff House and Sutro Baths (swimming pool complex but ice skating rink in film, torn down), The Legion of Honor museum, the elevated double-decker Embarcadero Freeway (demolished after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake), the Seaman's Club (YMCA of San Francisco Building), Steinhart Aquarium (California Academy of Sciences - damaged in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, torn down), De Young Museum (damaged in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, torn down), United States Customhouse, the Presidio, Golden Gate Bridge Highway and plenty of old docks and piers.

Has some silly stuff like a cop in the Golden Gate Park picking out the car of bad guys based on the driver having a ""tan"", and a cop on the north end of Ocean Beach (Cliff House and Sutro Baths area) picking out the car of bad guys again, but still a wonderful film.",1399334400,4,1730,4.904109589041096
5570256,5,B00BBGZA5C,"While many films have used S.F. as a locale for movies (eveything from Bullett to Star Trek), few have been made that captured historical landmarks that are now gone or drastically changed in appearance.  I particular I believe this is the only movie that has footage of outside and inside the Sutro Baths (there are also shots of the old DeYoung museum and the Cliff House).  And there is very little footage of any kind (even historical or documentary) of the inside of the Sutro Baths. For that reason I gave it 5 stars even though the plot is rather simplistic.",1396569600,,565,4.584158415841584
5570257,5,B00BBGZA5C,This was a great look of early San Francisco for the sights. The story line was good too and of course Eli Wallach was outstanding.,1391126400,2,131,4.28
5570258,3,B00BBGZA5C,"What a strange and engrossing movie. It can't decide whether it wants to be a clipped, flat DRAGNET clone or violent, gritty noir. The two cops are so wooden, one-dimensional and dull, they make Joe Friday & Frank Gannon look like Hawkeye Pierce and Trapper John by comparison. On the flip-side, the two assassins (one played by Eli Wallach), their driver (Richard Jaeckel), and the various underworld people that they encounter are eerie, dark, and their dialogue is great. It's as if the writer -- Stirling Silliphant -- and the director didn't give a damn about the cops and only cared about the bad guys. The San Francisco locations are terrific...it's like peering back into time. All in all, a very good movie. It's fun to contrast THE LINEUP with DIRTY HARRY, another Siegel cop movie shot in San Francisco.",1384128000,8,814,4.821428571428571

5570260,5,B00BBGZA5C,"I saw the beginning of this movie recently on TCM, but could not see the rest of it then, so I bought the DVD.  This is superb with its characterizations of the criminals, and the locales, some now gone, themselves make this worth watching along with the automobiles.  Vaughn Taylor in his short appearance in this film, perhaps the shortest apperance in his career,  becomes evil incarnate in a wheelchair.  The closeups of his face are worth the price alone.  Eli Wallach would be  memorable for his facial expressions alone executed as well here as are his ""lewd""  expressions in Baby Doll. His slight grins are somewhat barracuda like, but then he almost has our sympathy when he grovels before the ""Man,"" from whom he tries to cover his fear with mildness. It is curious that Wikipedia entries on Vaughn and on Richard Jaeckel [sp-?], the ""wheel man,"" do not mention their roles in The Lineup.  In addition, there is Robert Keith, a killer who often takes an avuncular attitude and seems to remember someone's final word that would make a good epitaph. As a bonus, someone who likes symbol hunts and subtexts may be able to find some here.",1471219200,2,1144,4.685
5570261,5,B00BBGZA5C,"I just saw this movie on tv and had to get it for a gift for my brother.  I loved the cars and the car chases in it.  It's all filmed in San Francisco, and I am familiar with that place, and first went there in the fifties as a little girl, to  the places that are featured in the movie, so it was a kick to see them filmed from that same time.  It's a old movie and in black and white, which I not only do not mind but find only adds to the nostalgia of an old movie of this type.  The film quality in it is excellent, and only those who appreciate black and white and what can be accomplished with it will know what I am talking about. So if you are a fan of old movies of this era, you will enjoy this one. Some of the cars are the same ones my dad owned, so again, nostalgia for me.  Great cars, I would not mind owning again. UPDATE :  I just watched this movie again at my brothers on a 60"" screen.  It just gets better.  The clarity of this film is just remarkable, and the genius of the producer, is amazing.  The angles of the shots of the actors, is so different than what you see today.  This producer was so incredibly talented.  Again, if you don't understand what black and white can do, you will not want to watch this no matter what anyone says, so do buy it and then complain.  But if you're a fan of black and white then you must buy this movie.  You will understand why I am so enthused about this film when you see it.  There is a second dvd in the pack with commentary on the movie.  However, that dvd was not all that interesting or informative.  I could have done without some of the language in it and would have appreciated more actual informative commentary, without the other crap he was saying.  This is a collectors dvd for sure.",1470528000,5,1758,4.017291066282421
5570262,5,B00BBGZA5C,"If you grew up in San Francisco in the 50's, you will love this movie.  I am so glad I actually bought it, and did not just rent it.  I have seen many movies made here, but this one has the best and most detailed landscape shots I have ever seen.  A younger San Franciscan might like this as well to see what the city used to look like.  Of course, the dialogue and story is dated, but if you can just let that go, you will like this movie.",1461801600,3,440,3.8555555555555556

5570267,4,B00BBGZA5C,"""The Lineup"" is a mildly noir police procedural and gangster flick based on the television series of the same name that aired on CBS 1954-1960. Director Don Siegel found the robbers considerably more interesting than the cops, however, and commissioned Stirling Silliphant to write a movie that emphasized the edgy, violent drugrunners and hit men. It begins at the San Francisco docks, when a porter hastily tosses someone's suitcase into a taxi, which speeds off, hitting a truck, a police officer, and, finally, killing the driver. Police Inspectors Ben Guthrie (Warner Anderson) and Al Quine's (Emile Meyer) investigation of the dead man and the suitcase leads them to a drug smuggling operation that uses innocent tourists to bring heroin into the United States.

Meanwhile, Dancer (Eli Wallach) and his partner Julian (Robert Keith) have arrived in town to retrieve more drugs from unsuspecting tourists. Their job is to relieve recent travelers of some objects they bought in Asia that contain heroin: a sailor, a well-to-do couple, and a woman and her young daughter. Predictably, things don't go as smoothly as the men would have liked. Julian describes Dancer as ""a wonderful, pure pathological study, a psychopath with no inhibitions."" Those are traits he likes to inflict on their new driver Sandy McLain (Richard Jaeckel) and which have a tendency to heighten a crisis. Julian's more reserved demeanor hides a man who has never fired a gun but with a passion for recording the last words of dying, murdered men.

In some sense, ""The Lineup"" is a post-War police procedural whose goal was to instill confidence and trust in governmental authorities. It also has elements of a public service announcement. There is a lot of exposition about how heroin smugglers use unwitting tourists to transport their product. But Don Siegel clearly wasn't interested in the cops. They embody their jobs but evince very little personality. The relationship between Dancer and Julian is center stage. The two men thrive on violence. But their ironic sense of professionalism proves that doing the right thing might be the wrong thing. Or is it? Even efficient killers can't control their destiny. The original trailer for ""The Lineup"" billed it as a ""never-before-told-super-chase-crime-hunt story"". Gleeful depravity and a terrific performance by Eli Wallach too.

The DVD (Sony 2009): This disc is part of the Columbia Pictures Film Noir Classics I set. Bonus features are an original theatrical trailer (2 min), ""The Influence of Noir with Christopher Nolan"" (6 min) in which the director says nothing intelligent about the relevance of noir to his films, and an audio commentary by film noir historian Eddie Muller and crime author James Ellroy. As the film takes place in San Francisco, this is Muller's territory, and he provides a lot of information about locations, as well as cast, photography, and Don Siegel's approach. James Ellroy offers some politically incorrect commentary. The tone is conversational and lively. English subtitles are available for the film.",1425686400,5,3070,5.223123732251521

8565386,5,B00BBGZA5C,"The Lineup, 1958 film

A ship docks at Pier 41 in San Francisco. A man drives away wildly in a taxicab, hitting a truck after running into a policeman (who shoots him). Why? The man in the taxicab had no identification. The man whose suitcase was stolen describes the contents. Nothing of value except for some trinkets he bought abroad. The dead mans gun cant be traced, the serial number was gouged out. Lefty Jenkins had a record as a wheelman. The police found a bag of heroin hidden in that statuette! They replace it with a bag of milk sugar, then return the suitcase to Mr. Dressler. He checks the contents and agrees to try to identify the porter who took his bag. Dressler will be tailed. Detective Guthrie visits the Customs Department, they cant catch them all. Innocent travelers are used to unknowingly smuggle drugs. The porters at the docks attend the lineup, five at a time. None are recognized.

The detective visits Jenkins tiny room and find his drug paraphernalia and clues. The body of a porter is found in the sea (he was in the lineup). A four-engine airliner lands at San Francisco airport. A man in a car meets two travelers to drive them away. This driver likes to talk. They meet a contact at the docks, he identifies the people who have the drugs. Dancer will deliver the goods via a dead drop. Julian explains this operation to Dancer. He calls the Seamans Club to arrange a meeting to pick up that horse. Why be greedy? The detectives investigate the murder of Warner and get a description of a man. The horse statuette is shattered! Dancer visits a big mansion to collect the flatware. The servants objection is overruled. Dancer doesnt leave witnesses. A mounted policeman sees two men with heavy tans, he calls it in with the license plate.

Dancer and Julian look at the doll bought in Tokyo. Cindy cries at the mistreatment of her doll. Dancer is warned about his plans, they must use the woman to explain the loss of the goods. They stop at Sutros museum which has many visitors. Dancer watches the drop site. A passing motorcycle cop notices the gray sedan parked by on the street. Julian explains why women have no place in crime or law enforcement. Dancer explains the shortage to the messenger. Youre dead. Did he speak too soon? The crowd screams at this event. The detectives arrive outside. Dancer runs up the stairs. Shots are fired. The gray sedan speeds away as the police follow. The road ahead is blocked. Can the villains escape? The car speeds onto a Freeway under construction! Are they trapped? Dancer dissolves the partnership, then goes over the side of the bridge to escape. The whistle sounds at 4:40 PM, its all over on schedule.

This drama seems to be based on a true crime because of the way it is written. The faults and quirks of the criminals seem realistic. The plan of the criminals seems perfect, but they don't allow for the unexpected. You can figure out the fate of the driver if Dancer and Julian completed their operation. And the single mother and her girl. Note the lack of traffic in San Francisco then. What else has changed since? Don Siegel went on to produce many more action films in the future. The Asphalt Jungle was a perfect crime story. Its planning was perfect except for what happened after the crime. Other stories, like The Big Knockover, had a similar stories.",1523232000,,3349,4.614093959731544
