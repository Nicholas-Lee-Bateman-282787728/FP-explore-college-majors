3549191,4,B001ECDVKY,"Great photography, fascinating film but rather short.  Looked fantastic on a 63"" Samsung plasma.  Scenes of windsurfers were really awesome.",1233964800,11,140,5.95
3549192,4,B001ECDVKY,Great videography!  Fun to watch and not so long that you get bored.  Good fun!,1434240000,,79,4.2
3549193,5,B001ECDVKY,Thank you.,1433548800,,10,4.5
3549194,5,B001ECDVKY,Saw this on IMAX years ago.  Love it!,1432080000,,37,3.625
3549195,3,B001ECDVKY,"more of a documentary, quality of Blu ray is weak. Extreme surfing, skiing, climbing",1417132800,,84,5.071428571428571
3549196,4,B001ECDVKY,Excellent footage of multiple extreme sports. Very entertaining.,1407801600,,64,7.125
3549197,5,B001ECDVKY,I was looking for this movie for a long time. Excellent blue ray version.,1406764800,,73,4.285714285714286
3549198,5,B001ECDVKY,Like a lot-thanks,1403827200,,17,5.0
3549199,3,B001ECDVKY,"This needed way more intense scenes throughout. It was OK, but we were thinking it would be non-stop exhilaration. More of the surfing and some intense skydiving and such. Wife said, ""you spent how much on that?"" Enough said, sorry.",1394841600,,232,4.825
3549200,4,B001ECDVKY,Hard to believe but this movie is about 15 years old.  Much of what they're doing is still extreme.  Nice mix of different sports.,1391731200,,130,4.375
3549201,5,B001ECDVKY,"I love surfing and water sports , I grew up on the beach as a kid living in Sydney Australia . This movie was awesome from big wave surfing to windsurfing , it just blew me away . Climbing frozen waterfalls to rock climbing . I can appreciate how dangerous it is for  those men and women athletes on how they challenge mother nature and to be on top of their game because you won't get a second chance if your not
.I was interested in how they filmed in Imax and to all camera men/ women and people associated with shooting documentaries, I give five stars",1389744000,,556,4.196261682242991
3549202,3,B001ECDVKY,Not enough WIndsurfing (according to me !). Too much skiing and climbing. But beautiful and very interesting to hear sportsmen (and women),1385078400,,138,5.318181818181818
3549203,5,B001ECDVKY,I loved being able to see this movie in such a perfect BluRay format! Such a crisp and clear picture! Watching it on my new big TV helped!!,1372550400,,139,4.0
3549204,5,B001ECDVKY,"Ill be watching this over and over. Definitely worth putting  into your collection. Get it! Nice  footage, and colors. =-0)",1371513600,,123,5.1
3549205,5,B001ECDVKY,I watch this at least once a month. It shows all the extreme sports and the scenery is incredible. Very happy with this purchase.,1363392000,,129,4.416666666666667
3549206,5,B001ECDVKY,"I always enjoy IMAX movies, and this one is excellent especially with a home theater surround sound system. It's something which is good fun for both adults and children.",1350172800,,170,4.896551724137931
3549207,5,B001ECDVKY,"Great IMAX movie for fans of the genre!

I waited for YEARS after seeing this for the first time (and multiple times thereafter)!  Contacted the makers of it and finally received word that this was out on Blu Ray.

Viewing on a 120"" projection screen with 1080p projector and great sound system.....WOW!!!!  Clarity, sound, cinematography are terrific!

This is a MUST have for any IMAX fans or folks desiring to show off BIG SCREEN capabilities!

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1340409600,,467,5.0
3549208,5,B001ECDVKY,"Extremely beautiful dvd with stunning places and highly risk sports with performances that will take the limits of the possible to a whole new level!

3549209,5,B001ECDVKY,"This is an excellent extreme sports blu-ray. Surfing, rock-climbing, and snoboarding/skiiing..... it is incredible footage. Highly recommend it to all.",1327190400,,151,6.6
3549210,4,B001ECDVKY,"This is a film you can watch over and over again. Amazing imagines. Color is not great however. I know it was filmed some years ago so it seems a bit out of date to what we've become used to now. If they could make the color more vivid, this would be an outstanding film.",1314057600,,271,3.9454545454545453
3549211,3,B001ECDVKY,"The photography, the interviews, etc are fantastic, with awesome scenery, but... there are no additional facts and information, eg. how fast do those incredible waves travel, what speeds are reached on the slopes while snowboarding, etc.  Much beauty, but virtually no information sums it up!",1309651200,,292,5.488888888888889
3549212,4,B001ECDVKY,"If you like documentaries, it's well worth a look. I am sure it was unbelievable in I-Max. Still pretty awesome in HD w/surround.",1301356800,,129,4.6521739130434785
3549213,5,B001ECDVKY,"Biggest waves I've seen other than some of the tow-in surfing that Laird has done at various places across the globe. The climbing scenes are also great.  Totally enjoyed watching this and totally amazed at the size of the waves at Waimea Bay - I think 1999.  Great diversion from the pain as I'm riding my bike on the trainer in front of the TV.
Buy it!  You will never regret it.  I think I've shown it at least five times during the first week I had it.",1299628800,,456,4.1477272727272725
3549214,4,B001ECDVKY,"The photography on this video is absolutely beautiful.  The personal testimonials are interesting, too.  I really enjoyed it.",1297382400,,125,5.888888888888889
3549215,4,B001ECDVKY,"Yes, as someone else mentioned it is a short documentary. However it is well made, the color is more than acceptable, sound is ok. This movie is a tribute to those that decide to challenge the elements while surfing, climbing, skiing having fun while doing it and actually showing respect as well.",1278892800,,297,4.730769230769231
3549216,2,B001ECDVKY,"When i saw the cover i was very exited to see big wave surfing, I was very unhappy with this movie as all the shot of the surfing scene are taken from a helicopter. Its a nice introduction to big wave surfing but nothing compare to riding giants or the billabong odisey. The rock climbing was also so so. The snow board scenes are nice as always but nothing special. Overall this blu ray is good but doesnt show you anything new or that you event seen before.",1276041600,,459,4.2272727272727275
3549217,5,B001ECDVKY,"I saw this film six times when it played in IMAX theaters about seven years ago, often taking friends who had not seen it. Since then I have been annually pestering the people at Extreme as to when a DVD might be available. This year's email turned up gold; it's out!

I think this film is utterly extraordinary. To me it's actually a serene meditation on art, beauty, elegance, and the human spirit. I'd been hoping for a DVD release because I periodically felt a need for an Extreme ""fix""; and it simply has not been available at regional IMAX theaters anymore. I would love to see it occasionally when I need reassurance as to what is worthwhile in the human spirit!

The previously released soundtrack is also one of my favorite albums. And the pairing of that music to the film is unbelievably inspired, For example, Morsheeba's ""The Sea"" is played during a snow/mountain episode, not during the surfing -- and it works so PERFECTLY! Whoever coordinated the soundtrack is a genius imho! It's right up there with ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" and just a handful of other movies as having perfect soundtracks (again: imho!). Along these lines, when the film was showing at our local IMAX theater, a reviewer wrote a basically good review -- except that he criticized the soundtrack. He said the music should have been more driving -- hard metal or some such. I just shook my head and wondered at how he could so totally and utterly miss the point of ""Extreme."" I guess he thought it should have been some kind of testosterone fest with pounding music to drive home the point. I'll stick with my assessment of the film as a meditation!",1257638400,22,1641,4.597269624573379
3549218,3,B001ECDVKY,"This looked a lot more interesting than it is.  This is an extremely short movie with very little substance to it.  It looked all right on a 52"" Samsung but for some reason the picture was very small.

Very glad I bought it on a Lightning Deal or I would have been that much more disappointed.",1246838400,10,293,4.196428571428571
3549219,5,B001ECDVKY,"I recently upgraded to a blu-ray player and then the decision was what would be the first discs that I would want to be the start of the new library.  This movie was one of the first things that came to my mind because the photography and action is truly amazing.  Something I will definitely watch many times.  If you love the outdoors and incredible settings, buy this disc!",1246147200,5,376,4.420289855072464
3549220,2,B001ECDVKY,"The Extreme is smaller than I could expect.
I was expecting to see a better overall quality as well, on the scenes, sequences and theme.",1241740800,6,136,4.48
