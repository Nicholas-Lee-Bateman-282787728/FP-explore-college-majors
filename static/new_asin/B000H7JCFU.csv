2630892,5,B000H7JCFU,"Own this movie if not just for Tracy Morgan and his friend dancing.

Chris Kattan and Dominique Swain's story can be a bit annoying...but it is a very entertaining and funny movie overall.

2630893,5,B000H7JCFU,"What can I say? I actually loved this movie. It's surprising that a TV movie debuting on VH1 could actually make me laugh out loud. The films plot is just a bunch of 80's movie thrown into one, much like the film Not Another Teen Movie. What makes this film work is the great casting, writing and over the top performances. Bravo White Guy who did Chappelle's show.",1162598400,5,365,4.382352941176471
2630894,2,B000H7JCFU,"Totally Awesome is unsurprisingly a VH1 Films production. Its inspiration clearly comes from that entertainment channel's ""I Love the `80s"" shows, which bask in the slightly embarrassing nostalgia for that bygone era of the Brat Pack, cheesy teen romances, pastel colors, and too much keyboard in rock songs. More important, though, the shows invite `B' comedians and celebrities to mock the heck out of every facet of the decade.

Unfortunately, they do a much better job than Totally Awesome, which will only score laughs because of extremely over-the-top performances, not because making fun of the 1980s is funny. Because, by this point, with the retro 1980s stuff nearly at its peak and the aforementioned ""I Love the 80s"" having skewered everything about film, music and culture, there aren't any more good spoof jokes to make. It's too late, guys.

DVD Extras: Why did ""Chappelle's Show"" co-creator Neal Brennan think this was a good idea? I don't know. I invite interested parties to listen to the commentary with Brennan and Tracy Morgan (guaranteed to be funny). If they still can't get enough, there are featurettes more watchable than the movie on the perfectly coiffed Kipp Vanderhoff character, Tracy Morgan's ad libs, bloopers and deleted scenes.",1162425600,2,1261,5.176470588235294
2630895,4,B000H7JCFU,My friend and I Watched this years ago and couldn't stop laughing. I got a used copy of it on here to remember the giggles. It worked.,1355529600,,134,4.0
2630896,5,B000H7JCFU,"This was a funny, silly movie that I rented a few years back so I knew what I was purchasing.  I love this '80's spoof film.",1338940800,,124,3.769230769230769
2630897,5,B000H7JCFU,"With a title like Totally awesome this movie had a lot to live up to, and it did. Now it deff is not for everyone but I found this to be an Aweosme movie with some awesmoely funny parts in it.....the story, as well, was quite awesome, mixing a few 80's movies togetehr to create their own movie. Great homage.",1297123200,,309,4.166666666666667
2630898,2,B000H7JCFU,Good thing I only paid less than $1 for this movie. All the funny parts were in the previews,1268697600,,92,3.8947368421052633
2630899,5,B000H7JCFU,"This is a genius spoof of corny 80s plot devices, character typecasting, musical transitions, and dance styles.  It spoofs a wide range of films too with some of the little jokes and many of the overarching plots, covering Teen Wolf, Pretty in Pink, Sixteen Candles, Breakfast Club, Problem child, Some kind of Wonderful, Karate Kid, Soul man, Footloose, Breakin' I and II, Dirty Dancing, Wierd Science, Girls just want to have fun, Vacation, Better off Dead, and a few others.

Anyone who loves 80 films or camp, corny retro TV/Movies will love this.  Its definitely got the charm of a low budget 80s flick, and a lot of satire for those who are familiar with the 80s teen genre, so anyone without an appreciation for the ridiculousness of the decade's film industry, WILL NOT enjoy this.  If you haven't seen a wide range of 80s movies either, most of the spoofs will go right over your head and seem stupid.

Even if you don't love the 80s, fans of Tracy Morgan (WHO IS GENIUS HERE!) and Chris Kattan (equally brilliant in his niche as the pretentious, over-inflated Swayze-wannabe Dance teacher/Janitor) will LOVE this.",1241568000,,1123,4.7979274611398965
2630900,3,B000H7JCFU,Only really funny thing is the tracy morgan parts ..If you are a fan of his then pick this up other wise forget it ... its a bad version of the scary movie themes of the 80's,1208390400,,174,3.72972972972973
2630901,5,B000H7JCFU,"Enjoyed the references to Soul Man, Footloose, Breaking, etc. I think I would enjoy this type of movie cause I graduated from high school in the 80's.",1207958400,,150,4.592592592592593
2630902,5,B000H7JCFU,"If you are nostagic for the clothes, music, vocabulary and personas of the 80's... this movie is for you!!!!",1193270400,,108,4.7368421052631575
2630903,5,B000H7JCFU,"Totally Awesome takes a variety of 80s teen films and melds them all together.  Several mainstream actors are abundant and you will not be left out of in the laughs, as this movie will over dramatize several things you may find familiar.  The social issues are still sweet and comical as well as the hairstyles and music.  The 80s were a fun time when they were happening, so have fun reliving them or at least laughing at some of the films like sixteen candles or the breakfast club which have some presence in this film.",1186617600,,522,4.473684210526316
2630904,4,B000H7JCFU,"Creators of embarassingly lame and un-funny spoof films like ""Date Movie"" and ""Epic Movie"" need to take notice.  ""Totally Awesome"" might not be the funniest movie I've ever seen, (an honor still reserved for ""Dumb and Dumber"") but this movie succeeds as a far better spoof of its source material (the 80's) than either of those two movies combined.  Instead of just loosely stitching together movie spoofs into a stupid and completely non-sensical plot (like the aforementioned duds), ""Totally Awesome"" is able to both spoof movies (""The Karate Kid"", ""Footloose"", etc.) and weave them together into a decent story all its own.  Even if you haven't seen many of the movies lampooned here, you should still have no problem enjoying the story as its presented. There's no punishment for those who aren't ""in"" on the joke, nor does the movie fall flat on its face without knowledge of the references.  Let's see ""Date Movie"", ""Epic Movie"" or even ""Scary Movie 4"" make that claim.  ""Totally Awesome"" is a funny and likable movie with a fair share of interesting and funny characters.  Mikey Day is very charismatic as the likeable Charlie and Dominique Swain is completely hilarious with all her psychotic outbursts.  (Seriously-these blow ups alone are worth the price of a rental!!)  I'd like to see more movie spoofs done this way in the future and less like ""Date Movie"".",1184630400,4,1370,4.926086956521739
2630905,5,B000H7JCFU,This movie is fantastic. Sure the acting stinks-that the way the movies of the 80s were. This is well worth buying and will make a great movie to watch on a long day.,1178928000,,166,4.0606060606060606
2630906,1,B000H7JCFU,"It is an insult that they try to pass this off as comedy.  The story was none existant, and the acting was appauling.  As if movies like ""Scary Movie"", ""Not Another Teen Movie"", ""Date Movie"" and ""Epic Movie"", and all the other nauseating cookie cutter sequels they spawned weren't bad enough, VH1 puts out this 90 minute borefest.  Instead of doing the same lame obvious ""jokes"" over and over try coming up with an original comedy.  This is not even worth 1 star.",1176595200,2,463,4.542168674698795
2630907,5,B000H7JCFU,lot of silly laughing by actors ....over the top performances seems like thier were pushed to hard by the director to overdue a line ....lol  the actors are a little to old to be high school ???,1175212800,,194,4.243243243243243
2630908,4,B000H7JCFU,"This is a VH1 Original. I saw this on VH1 and waited for it to rerun. Unlike every other thing on VH1, it didn't. So I bought it. It puts together a ton of great 80s movies (Not another teen movie style) for great entertainment. It has all your favorite characters, with some slight exaggerations of course. If you like slapstick humor and/or 80s movies you will love this.

I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it could have a few more familiar references in it. Great overall!!!",1173744000,,482,4.355555555555555
2630909,5,B000H7JCFU,"If you like movies like sweet 16 , pizza the movie and nerds strike back you'll love this film!! Vh1 did a ""what ever happened to..."" on the cast .

Gunderson went on to do 3 more of these and the cool black guy went on to do a showtime show. Kimberly went on to do Pittsburgh steamer videos.",1172102400,,292,3.9491525423728815
2630910,3,B000H7JCFU,This DVD is funny and yet silly at the same time. I love how they put some 80's movies like 'Dirty Dancing' and 'pretty in Pink' all into one crazy movie.,1168473600,,154,4.0
2630911,5,B000H7JCFU,"Remember how ridiculous the movies in the 80's were? How politically incorrect they were? How bad the acting was? Finally there's a movie that pokes fun at all the silliness and mock seriousness of the movies of the 1980's. Totally Awesome is a movie that takes on even the smallest stereotypes and cliques. Produced by VH1, Totally Awesome is the ultimate parody of every movie ever produced by the decade that gave us some of the most memorable movies of all time. If you're looking to laugh out loud go no further. Chris Kattan shines in his most over the top character role, playing part Patrick Swayeze, part the janitor from the Breakfast Club. His dancing scenes alone are worth watching this movie. Prepare to laugh so hard you cry, that's the magic of Totally Awesome.",1168473600,,777,4.720588235294118
2630912,4,B000H7JCFU,"I'm making the bold prediction that this movie will, in time, become a

cult classic for those who ""get it"" much like Office Space.  Many

reviewers, professional and not, dismiss this movie out of hand, again

like Office Space.  They clearly don't fall into the ""getting it"" crowd.

Those who enjoy twisted references and a plethora of quotable lines will

fall hard for this picture.  I can't stress enough that you and whoever

you watch this movie with will be trading lines via text messaging

within minutes of the credits rolling. This is a tribute to primary

writer Neal Brennan's (Chappelle's Show, Half Baked) script.  Brennan

does a great job crafting a very clever homage (not entirely a spoof) to

80's flicks with pitch perfect timing and mood. Centering around the

Gunderson family that moves from Pittsburgh to California, Totally

Awesome finds siblings Charlie (Mikey Day) and his sister Lori (Dominque

Swain) trying to adapt to their new surroundings.  The family is rounded

out by genius younger brother Max (Trevor Heins) and optimistically

clueless parents (Greg Kean and Teryl Rothery).  Immediately things go

wrong for Charlie and Lori as their worlds are turned upside down.  As

the new kid, Charlie finds himself dead last in the school coolness

rankings and dance aficionado Lori can't practice her trade due to some

dubious local legislation. Their struggles are offset by fellow outcasts

Billie (Nicki Clyne) and Gabriel (Chris Kattan). What sets Totally

Awesome apart from other 80's referencing films, such as Not Another

Teen Movie, is that the main characters and many of the surrounding cast

are composites rather than direct references to characters from classic

80's movies.  Standouts include Joey Kern as smirking king of the High

School, Kipp Vanderhoff and Tracey Morgan in a role that relied heavily

on his ad-libbing abilities.  Kattan does a respectable job as the

smarmy 35 year old school janitor, as does Lucie Guest as his scorned

girlfriend Deb.  Granted, Guest's performance is facial expression

heavy, but the casting was perfect!  A refreshing change to this film is

the lack of gross-out humor (perhaps we are spared this due to its

production directly for television) that seems to the status quo for

movies that fall into this genre (think Wayans).  The soundtrack is

expectedly laden with 80's classics, however the score is part of the

fun here.  The music for the dance numbers and the emotional synth

filling the background of Billie and Charlie scenes perfectly set the

mood. Occasionally the film does fall flat, particularly it's thankfully

brief and over the top Teen Wolf references, however its positives more

than outweigh these grating scenes.",1167436800,,2739,5.111363636363636
2630913,4,B000H7JCFU,"TOTALLY AWESOME is NOT a good movie. In fact, it's completely awful. Yet, after watching it and laughing my butt off numerous times, rewinding to rewatch certain things, I couldn't help thinking... this made for T.V., straight to video movie, was ten times better than LITTLE MAN, WHITE CHICKS & DATE MOVIE... put together.

I shouldn't call it an awful movie, because it's funny as heck. It accomplished its goal by being hilarious. Yet, unlike LITTLE MAN, WHITE CHICKS & DATE MOVIE, it didn't get the studio backing like it should have. The movie has a shot by video camera look to it. The dance sequences are purposely terrible and unpracticed. Dominique Swain plays a perfect combination of awkward clumsiness and over-the-top effort.

TOTALLY AWESOME knocks all the trends of the 80s, the movies, the clothes, the dancing, the lingo, the popularity cliques and the emotional baggage that teens carry. Yet, unlike DATE MOVIE, the movie spoofs have setup, purpose and deliver laughs. They're not just imitations and references, they have a reason and they're funny. Like the stereotypical movie jerk Kipp, played by Joey Kern, or the Gay Miyagi, Yamagashi, played by James Hong, or the total belittlement of the sweet not so pretty girl Billie, played by Nicki Clyne, and her willingness to forgive, and of course the town who boycotted dancing and the 35 year-old janitor, Chris Kattan, who teaches a secret dance class and preys on 16 year-old girls.

The funniest things in TOTALLY AWESOME are just pokes at the 80s culture in general. Most noteably Tracy Morgans portrayal of Darnell and his robot break dancing friend Cheese, and without question, the emotional EXPLOSIONS of Lori, played by a hilarious Dominque Swain. She snaps at the drop of a hat. She goes from sweet talking, girl next door, to a crying, blubbering, destroying screen door, screaming basket case in seconds, and it's hilarious.

Oh, and like all the spoof movies, they had to throw in a Michael Jackson reference... but unlike DATE MOVIE... this Michael Jackson reference IS FUNNY.

Check out TOTALLY AWESOME. It isn't a good movie, but strangely enough, you'll be laughing outloud.",1163203200,,2162,5.011142061281337
2630914,5,B000H7JCFU,"Dominique Swain steals the spotlight from the rest of the actors and she doesn't even know it.  Her girl-next-door appeal and good looks make this movie a joy to watch.  It's worth the rental fee just to see Dominique.  She has a bright future as an actress.

Often-times intentionally annoying, over-acted and over the top, Totally Awesome! takes you back to the 80's by spoofing not only popular movies of the decade but clothing styles and anything and everything else you'll probably remember, and some things you've forgotten.  It doesn't take its self seriously at all and you shouldn't take it seriously either.  Just pop it in the DVD player and have fun with it.",1162944000,4,671,4.791304347826087
