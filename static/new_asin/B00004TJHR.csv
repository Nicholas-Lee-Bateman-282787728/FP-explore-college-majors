7922731,4,B00004TJHR,"Yes, the quality is poor. But one should remember this was filmed in Japan in 1924. Given the firebombing of WWII the fact that it exists at all is pretty amazing. This is one of the few surviving artifacts from the era when Karate was transmitted from Okinawa to Japan.

If you are looking for an instructional video, this is not for you. If you want to see the original Karate as Funakoshi brought it from Okinawa to Japan, before it became stylized and exaggerated then you will want to see this footage.

To say there are huge differences between the Naihanchi Kata (Okinawan version) and Tekki Kata (Japanese version) is an understatement even though they are supposedly the same kata.

You can also see the actual training level of the practitioners of the era which are often exaggerated to mythic proportions. But at the same time you can observe their dedication to practical fundamentals and the lack of stylized kata or exhibitionist technique.

It is the ""real"" karate we have often read so much about in books.",1317686400,,1023,4.730337078651686
7922732,1,B00004TJHR,"To say that this video is of poor quality is an understatement.  While the information that is conveyed audibly is useful, the visual aspect is completely pointless.  It should have been packaged as an audio recording.
  The images of Funakoshi Sensei are indiscernable black shadows moving across the screen.  It's not worth your time or money.",1000857600,10,345,5.089285714285714
