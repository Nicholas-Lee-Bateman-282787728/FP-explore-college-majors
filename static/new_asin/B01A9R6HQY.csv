8746842,4,B01A9R6HQY,"Good movie but not as engaging at Iron Man 1 and 2. It had all the right combination of special effects and sonic fireworks. But the story seemed a bit contrived, as if the writers were stretching hard to make it work. Reminds me of how the Transformers franchise began by dazzling us then over time began to lose its luster and uniqueness.",1526601600,,340,4.412698412698413
8746843,5,B01A9R6HQY,3D movies are WAY fun! Brings me back to the 70s when I was a young kid & they were shown in theaters as a novelty. I hope they keep making them bigger & better. Also hoping they keep re-releasing old 3D movies on BluRay with new transfers!  Yay for 3D!!!!,1523577600,2,256,4.019607843137255
8746844,1,B01A9R6HQY,Look I'm a fan of RDJ Iron Man and the MCU. The first movie was amazing and blew my mind when it came out. The second Iron Man was mediocre but somewhat watchable at least but Iron Man 3 is a gigantic mess. A poorly written storyline that contains the worst plot twist (Mandrian Reveal) I have ever seen in the movie. The characters are overall handled terribly to the point where the movie feels like a big joke. Speaking of jokes there are so many forced on bad jokes that get shoehorned into this movie to the point it is cringe-worthy. The final act was a big CGI catastrophe that was completely pointless and dumb (Don't even get me started on Peppers turning into the human torch like thing). Robert Downey Jr. is the only saving grace in this movie. He is really the only good aspect of this movie. But overall he is not enough to save this movie. If you buy this movie and are disappointed well don't say I didn't warn you.,1519948800,7,931,4.295454545454546
