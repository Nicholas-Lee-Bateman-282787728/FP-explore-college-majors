3794723,5,B001TZ70DU,"I was spoiled by the Luscious DVD and wans't sure that Love Potion could possibly be as good; but Happy, Happy, Joy, Joy, Love Potion is just that joyful and uplifting!  I love it.",1247961600,7,180,4.294117647058823
3794724,5,B001TZ70DU,"This instructional video gives good understandable direction.  It can be used by beginners as well as intermediate dancers, the moves are illustrated very well, making it easy to understand and emulate.  A good workout that's fun too!",1247270400,3,234,5.297297297297297
3794725,4,B001TZ70DU,"Love Potion from World Dance New York is the unofficial sequel to Luscious, a previous entry into the bellydance fitness market with the same instructors:  Neon, Blanca and Sarah Skinner.  Using American bellydance technique, they put together a drill session and workout.  In addition to drilling the movements, the instructors make note of head angles, posture, and grace - the little details that make the dancer.  As always, beautiful and flattering costumes are worn by the three instructors, varying by each section, and each of them trade off leading.  The DVD is split into 7 different sections, each with a different inspiring name such as ""Creative Flame"" or ""Goddess"".  There is a feel-good element to the DVD as well, little mantras uttered at the beginning of each section about loving yourself, talking about how shimmies give us joy.  So, if you need a bit of a psychological boost, this DVD may just give you one.  If not, these sentiments easily fade into the background.

It is more advanced than Luscious, as few movements are drilled consecutively and everything is mapped quickly into a combination.  The viewer is expected to pick up on the combinations quickly and follow them, which is the reason why this is more of an intermediate/advanced DVD.  There is, however, a beginner's practice flow, which goes through each of the sequences slower.  I actually consider this to be a good thing, as the DVD will keep me entertained even if I repeat it over and over, which as a fitness DVD, I intend to do.

The movements themselves are not advanced - ranging from smooth moves like pelvic circles and infinity loops to hip accents and shimmies.  You will get a core workout if you are utilizing proper posture, maintaining your core, and - as my teacher says - squeezing your princess.  After the 40 minutes, I'm actually feeling it!  For the cardio aspect, it's hard to gauge, since I'm 8 months pregnant and we don't seem to have the air conditioning on.  I was sweating, but I don't know if the average person would.  You might even see it as a ""interval"" workout, since the sections varied from undulating and circling movements to the more intense hip drops, accents, and shimmies, and back again.

The DVD is set to new-agey music.  Most of it was OK.  As a huge fan of Arabic music, the music on this DVD didn't really get going.  It did make for nice backdrop music, but I wouldn't run out and buy the CD. The last section, where many of the combinations are joined into a dance, is set to a composition ""Goddess"".  I found myself a little embarrassed - I just don't go in for this sort of thing, sung in English. It's very goddess-power type stuff.  I don't object to the message, but it's not really my thing either.  Luckily I was alone in the dance studio because otherwise I would feel pretty silly dancing around to ""I'm a Goddess, Set me Free"" if anyone could see me.  That said, it's really nice to see the combinations and movements displayed in a dance, that was obviously connected to the music (as dance should be), and the dancers/instructors on this DVD display grace and, well, a goddess-quality when they demonstrate this section.
I should also mention that either of the two workouts on this DVD, Love Potion and Beginner Flow, can be done without voice cues, with the music only.

Overall, I got exactly what I ordered, a fitness dvd that works my core, drills my bellydance vocabulary, and keeps me entertained as I do it.",1245196800,76,3468,4.689256198347107
3794726,5,B001TZ70DU,"I love this!  The moves are broken down in an excellent, clear manner for beginners in the turorial section, done slowly for those somewhat familiar, and work-out pace for those that are familiar.  This makes it great for everyone because you can choose your pace and advance your skill level.  You can even choose to have voice cues or just music for your workout.  If you are an absolute beginner, I would recommend Instant Belly Dancer 1 & 2 along with this DVD.  If you want an all dance workout with continuous movement, I recommend this DVD.  No yoga, no pilates, no jazzercise..... just belly dance!  Not only that, these ladies are lovely to watch and their costumes are delicious!",1244937600,5,689,4.691666666666666

I hope to take a class with these ladies someday!

3794728,5,B001TZ70DU,"World Dance New York returns with this enchanting ""Love Potion"" dance instructional/workout program. If you are a fan of ""Luscious"" you will absolutely love this program! Beautiful 100% belly dance moves layered on triple steps on releve, grapevines and beautiful turns, rocking steps, all a bit more challenging!
This program options has voice cues or music only and is about two hours and a twenty minutes total.

The selections are:
The Love Potion Workout-40 minutes, practice flow for beginners-50 minutes, and tutorial-50 minutes.

 You will definetly feel the work out as you shift from grapevines to releves, and hip movement. Best of all you will increase in dance vocabulary and learn posture, isolation, arms frames, a huge variety of hip movement, and traveling steps. From beginner to intermediate student, the tutorial and practice section allows most to follow along very well.

Neon instructs the key elements in the dance structure section; the purpose of slower dance movement allowing the muscles to get a longer work out, the technqiue of isolation, body posture, stylized movement  in contrast to everyday life movement. Dancing can help alleviate the symptoms of sedentary lifestyle by elongating muscles and fixing improper posture.
 Each segment below focuses on upper and lower body basics focusing on circles, undulations, shimmies, hip movement and traveling steps, working every muscle group. Once past the welcome section, prepare to be taken in by beautiful music, choreography and dancers of course!
Neon, Sarah, and Blanca lead you into the following trajectories of
The Love Potion workout: (The combos are broken down quite simply with footwork, arms patterns, hipwork added gradually and repeated.

Eternal Feminine- a rotations workout, grapevine, hip accents.
Mystery-pelvic circles, hip pushes, chest lifts and circles,hip infinity loops.
Desire-horizontal infinity loops, undulations, triplet steps, and yet more hip accents.
Creative Flame- emphasis on hip work, lifts drops
Free Spirit-emphasis on shimmies, shoulder and vertical hips and 3/4 up and down shimmies.
Priestess- a beautiful dance flow empahsing grace, body alignment, coordination, and fluidity
Goddess-beautiful sways, turns, hip work, all combined in a ""dancer's prayer"" flow.

Each segment offers much variety using organic belly dance moves. When combined differently, these work different muscle groups as a fantastic workout. The tutorial section and practice flow are suberbly defined with extensive vocablulary for dancers of all levels making this one of the best dance instructional videos I have reviewed. Neon is a thorough and precise instructor as you will see in the tutorial and practice flow segment. I especially commend the footwork section so well broken down, beautifully narrated, carefully guding into proper posture and framing! Arms patterns added are beautiful decorations to the hip movement and traveling steps.

The music is spell-binding with several selections from DJZen, Hossam Ramzy and others. The stage backdrop is soft and soothing to the eye. If you are new to belly dance or have loved it for a spell, the ""Love Potion"" program will simply mesmerize you!",1243728000,22,3198,5.510204081632653
3794729,5,B001TZ70DU,"This is serious belly dance instruction masquerading (successfully, I might add) as an exercise video.  You'll need a little more space to execute the moves than, say, the Shimmy Workout (which I also recommend); but your living room should suffice.",1433980800,2,249,5.225

3794736,5,B001TZ70DU,"I really love Blanca. Her every move is so sensuous. Wow! And Sarah Skinner is the consummate teacher. She really looks feels and becomes the sultry dancer, and shows us how to get the look and feel of the dance. I don't really understand the complaints from other viewers. I have plenty of DVD's that demonstrate the how to of each move, and they actually complement each other but what I have been looking for are some dances--or combined moves to learn to create my own dance, and this DVD has several great dances. I think my problem with Neon, as she is sultry and beautiful too, is that her dance routines are more difficult. I would buy any of Blanca or Skinner's DVD's. Definitely not just for beginners, but best for beginners.",1414022400,,736,4.541353383458647
3794737,5,B001TZ70DU,This DVD teaches you how to make the movements.  She shows you what is right and not right.  She teaches you how to do the dances shown in the DVD.,1399334400,,147,3.8666666666666667
3794738,3,B001TZ70DU,"I really liked the practice flows--you dance along with Neon, Blanca and Sarah Skinner to some basic moves strung together in some interesting but simple choreography--with or without vocal cues to tell you what move comes next.  The music was enjoyable, other than the ""Fire Goddess"" song that was a bit over the top for me with the snicker-inducing voice-over ""I am the desert rose...luminous in moon wine"".  Hrm.

Unfortunately, the practice flows are just a third of this DVD.  The rest is technique--which normally is a major plus, but if you are unfamiliar with the basics of belly dance, I doubt you could learn the moves very easily by just watching someone explain the technique.  (I do like hearing Neon explain things, though, her accent sounds like Dracula's.)  I think that if this DVD had been organized with technique, combinations, then a flow, then more technique, more combos, then another flow it would've been really great for all levels.  More advanced dancers could just skip to the flow.

Overall I think the flows are fun to dance along to, but that this DVD needed to be assembled better for viewers to get the most out of the material offered.",1398643200,,1169,4.81

3794743,5,B001TZ70DU,"I wish they can make more of these bellydance workout. Very comprehensive bellydance moves, and lots of materials in one DVD. Compared to the other dance DVDs on the market that only have 45 min with repeated moves ( just to teach you so that you can follow up), this DVD has 50 min unrepeated new moves divided into 7 small sessions. You can play over and over at your own pace without getting bored. I have been using this DVD for a year (once every week), and I still find I haven't mastered all the moves.

If you are an absolute beginner and you want to buy only one bellydance DVD, I think this is the one. It has the explanations you need as a total beginner, it has a nice practise flow and a bit more advanced workout (the bit more of difficulty lies in the speed and in the combination of various of the moves into a choreography, not in layering the moves, so it's doable). If you are a total beginner maybe you should stick to the practice flow for some time, since going directly to the workout may ""intimidate"" you. I am still at a level that I enjoy the flow better than the workout, because I do not need to concentrate so much on following the combos and I can focus on doing the moves correctly, so I feel I exercise better.

EXCELLENT BD DVD'S FOR TOTAL BEGINNERS. I may have other beginner DVD's, but the following are my top pics because all include a detailed tutorial section that break down the moves slowly and without music. Of course tutorials are boring, specially if you are not totally new to BD or if you prefer to learn by dancing from the very first step. However, if you are an absolute beginner in BD, you probably need this instruction, since you need to isolate a lot of muscles you did not even know you could voluntarily move.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Belly-Dance-Basics-Beyond-with-Jenna-Belly-Dancing-Classes-for-a-Solid-Foundation-Bellydance-how-to-belly-dance-technique/dp/B000FSL8WQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Belly Dance Basics & Beyond, with Jenna: Belly Dancing Classes for a Solid Foundation - Bellydance how-to, belly dance technique</a>&nbsp;will provide you one of the most detailed technique sections you will find and probably the most complete one in terms of variety of moves.

However, I am not sure if it's for total beginners, since Autumn does not include individual practice time for each independent move, the only practice time you get is different moves strung together in a flow.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Belly-By-Sandra-Vol-1-Isolations-Bellydance-Instructional/dp/B001SFT764/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Belly By Sandra Vol 1: Isolations (Bellydance Instructional)</a>&nbsp;is also excellent for beginners. Sandra first explains each move, including muscular engagement, posture, etc. without music and also giving you truly interesting background information as to how the move is executed in ""Middle Eastern Dance"" vs other dance forms like ""African"", ""Jazz"", etc. Then she drills each move with excellent drum music, making your drilling much more fun so you do not get bored so easily. However, you would need to buy Vol 1 and 2 and still don't get as many moves as with Jenna.

CARDIO CHALLENGE: Low TONING: Medium CHOREOGRAPHY DIFFICULTY: Beginner to Intermediate INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY: Very Good MUSIC: Very Good FUN FACTOR: Very good

CONTENTS: Tutorial, practise flow and workout are about 40-50 minutes each, so basically like a regular class.
1) TUTORIAL - Very good explanations and break down of the steps and moves that you will need in the following sections without music
2) PRACTISE FLOW - Drilling session for beginners with nice slow music so it's like dancing your reps. All the moves are practised in the basic combinations that you will need in the workout.
3) WORKOUT - Divided in 6 sections (led alternated by Neon, Blanca and Sarah - 2 chapters each, so you get more variety in teaching styles). Each section consists of several combinations that include the moves learned in the tutorial/flow sessions but combining the simple combinations from the flow into more complex ones and alternating them to form a more choreographed workout.
4) GODDESS DANCE - Combines the moves from the 6 sections of the workout in a full choreography.
MISSING: Warm-up and cool-down. Apparently Neon considers the first section and the last one as warm-up and cool-down respectively. In the trailer of another of her workouts, she expressly mentions that the last segment is your ""dancing cool-down"", a series of artistic slow poses and flowing movements that release tension in your muscles. Ok, I take it, but I really like standing or floor stretches, so sometimes I use the cool-down of another DVD.

MUSIC:
Very nice contemporary music selections without lyrics, so you can concentrate on your moves (only the last dance ""Goddess"" has lyrics).

EMPHASIS:
Very good overall emphasis, your abs get a very thorough workout and it even has some arm embellishments and footwork.

WHAT IS BETTER THAN IN OTHER DVD'S:
+ I labelled this DVD one of the best ""all round"" DVD's in my collection, since you simply have it all: detailed tutorial suited even for absolute beginners, beginner dance flow and advanced beginner workout, which you can continue using as you advance your dance, because it's a good bellydance training as well as fun, so you can really ""grow"" with this DVD.
+ Very well balanced: it is useful for almost all skill levels, the size of each segment is ideal, it combines slow and faster segments, it alternates the leading role of the dancers, it combines soft & undulating movements with percussive ones, it targets all body parts as well as some embellishments, it combines drills and dance combinations, as well as artistry and fitness.
+ Customizable training: The tutorial and the practise flow which are two independent sections, have also been built together, so you can decide how to use them, depending on your preferred learning process. You can go over the whole tutorial (if you need detailed and slow break-down of the technique), you can dance from the beginning with the ""dance flow"" (if you prefer the ""monkey see, monkey do"" method) or you can choose each move from a menu that presents you the tutorial of the specific move followed by the part of the dance flow that drills that specific move.
+ Nice combinations: Well balanced and look nice together. Although they are not too complex (not many layers), you learn how you can put different moves together in a choreography.
+ Shimmy section: Real fun (excellent choice of music+combinations). Maybe it is not as thorough as the one in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Serpentine-Belly-Dance-with-Rachel-Brice-Bellydance-Technique-Yoga-for-Strong-Relaxed-Sinuous-Movement/dp/B00095NX9G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Serpentine - Belly Dance with Rachel Brice :: Bellydance Technique & Yoga for Strong, Relaxed & Sinuous Movement</a>, but this one is easier, so you can start here.

Neon's ""First Steps"" is not as good for Total Beginners and in overall content as Love Potion, which is really excellent in almost every respect.

P.D. Why 4 stars? Only because I chose to rate 5 stars only the DVD's I would definitely replace in case I lost them. I would not give this DVD away, but I'm not sure if I would replace it. This is an excellent DVD which I absolutely recommend, specially to beginners who wish to start bellydancing and improve in this dance form.",1341273600,5,9905,6.225547445255475
3794746,3,B001TZ70DU,"I've tried several of the World Dance DVDs with Neon, Bianca, etc. I found the Sensual one poorly done. For the ""trilogy"" Luscious - Love Potion- and (forgot the name), they are better, but have flaws. I'd say if you have a good level of coordination and want to get a workout with a bellydance flavor, this is good. It can even help you learn basic BD moves. But there are flaws: the cueing is not the best, moves quickly and cues are announced after moves are begun often. Also sometimes the cues are incorrect, saying to move Left, when it's really Right. Another criticism is that the ""combinations"" - used loosely - are picked up, dropped and changed too quickly. When learning, it helps to practice something over and over for several minutes to get something ""down"" ... I wish that was more the case here. Overall it's OK for a workout, and if you stick with it you'll start getting things in muscle memory, which is good. It can be enjoyable. But I think it's somewhat haphazard. I highly recommend Jillina Shape Up and Hip Out for a really great learning/combination beginner dance instruction and workout, which moves at a more ideal pace and drills combinations long enough to get them in the body.

***On a side, note, note that the ""First Steps Bellydance"" DVD from World Dance New York is an excruciatingly S L O O O O W and presentation that would probably not inspire or challenge you if you've got any movement capacity at all  ***",1340409600,7,1448,4.5440613026819925

3794750,5,B001TZ70DU,"I'd say that if you're a beginner, Love Potion will be more helpful than Luscious. With the tutorial and flow practice, you get a lot of solid experience using bellydance moves. Some of the music was good enough that I wouldn't mind buying it, which is often not the case. (I usually can't wait to learn the moves so I can dance to my own music.) The whole goddess/priestess imagery was pretty goofy, but you can turn off the voice over if it gets on your nerves. On the whole, this is a great DVD for building your confidence in bellydance. Note: It's not an exercise workout like some Veena and Neena DVDs. Instead, it is practice for getting your body trained in bellydance.",1327363200,,677,4.467741935483871
3794751,5,B001TZ70DU,"I think this is a good investment if you already have Luscious this is a good follow up. All three of the teachers clearly know what they are doing. Blanca and Sarah are good, but I don't really think I'd get DVDs by them unless Neon is involved somehow. I just have trouble with there teaching style for some reason. Neon is an amazing teacher as far as I'm concerned, I only picked up dance and figured out how to do it because I picked up Luscious.

The DVD has several options, if you are not a dancer I would try the practice flow first.  I did that for something like three months before trying the workout itself. One of the other reviewers made the comment there is no warm up and cool down. There is, Neon's first section on both the practice flow and the workout is a warm up. In the workout itself Blanca follows up Neon's initial warm up with another one similar to the first circle section on Luscious. Blanca also ends the workout with a cool down. The ""goddess section"" at the end is extra its not part of the workout itself. I call it the ""dance"" part. Anyway if the above is not enough for you I would try doing the first section of Luscious first and then tackling Love Potion.

The music throughout is very good I wish I could figure out what the song used for the Shimmy section was because I just love it. Although I keep wanting to improvise rather then do the moves Sarah is asking me to do.

The girls all wear pants so you can see there legs when they are dancing, so if you are a true beginner you'll be able to copy the movement they are doing. All in all well worth the five stars and the money for it.",1327104000,4,1630,4.165079365079365
3794752,5,B001TZ70DU,"I love this DVD!  It's easy and the direction is clear enough for beginners, but the cominations are clever and interesting enough for more advanced dancers to include in their choreographies.

Sara's DVDs never fail to please.",1326153600,,227,5.108108108108108
3794753,5,B001TZ70DU,"Very enjoyable as a workout.  I also own Luscious, which I enjoy.  Compared to Luscious, Love potion offers different & slightly more challenging combinations.  The video seems to be more clear, making it look a bit more modern.",1311292800,,228,4.947368421052632
3794754,5,B001TZ70DU,"Finally, a Workout DVD that I can Respect.  Not only do I actually use this DVD and workout every night, I sometimes leave it on just for the fun of it.  I am buying more from these three dancers.",1306022400,,196,4.0
3794755,5,B001TZ70DU,"I have had this DVD for a while now along with Luscious and I find they are very similar, so my review is essentially the same for both of them.

I'll start with all the positive things about this DVD not including the actual content it'self. First, it's very affordable. I got mine when it was closer to $15 which is very well priced for a quality belly dance DVD. The video, sound, lighting and camera work are all very good. The video is clear, sound is crisp, voice overs are well done, lighting is moody but not too dark, camera angles are appropriate and camera changes are kept to a minimum. The DVD has lots of features. It has explanations on how to do the moves and how to do the combinations used in the workout. You can do the workout with voice over cues or without.

As for the actual content, the program provides a light to moderate workout that is very much like dancing as opposed to an aerobics class with some belly dance moves. I wouldn't say you will get a heavy workout like the Veena and Neena Slim Down. However, if you are looking for something that is a mix of dance practice and a workout in one then I think you will enjoy this DVD. It is 100% dance including graceful arm variations. It's a great way to work on your stamina and polishing your technique for long performances. The sessions vary in tempo starting with a slow piece. From there they alternate tempos to keep things interesting. The dancing starts off with a simple move such as a hip circle, then adds on it to make short combos that are repeated a few times, then another simple move is introduced and this process is repeated throughout. The movements match the music and are generally easy to follow although you may not get them all at first. Simple layering is used (such as hip bumps over a traveling step) but if you can't do the movement yet you can easily omit a layer or two so that you can keep up.

The dancers take turns being in the middle and that dancer does the voice over for that dance. Voice over is simple cues, tips, and bits of encouragement that are helpful and are not distracting. And you can always turn it off later if you prefer. All three of the dancers are skilled and demonstrate technique properly. They are also in perfect sync with each other making everything come together well. Their costumes are attractive and stand out well without being distracting or overly gym-ish. They're like something between practice gear and a full costume. The dancers wear pants that let you see their feet.

The music is enjoyable, but not very ""traditional"". However, I find for practice this is perfectly acceptable. The songs tend to be simple because something complicated with lots of changes would make it too hard to repeat movements and follow along. I actually really liked a lot of the music in this context.

You will like this DVD if:
-You are looking for something to practice uninterrupted dancing for long periods of time to help you build dance stamina.
-You have a grasp of basic belly dance movements and some simple layering or are not afraid to alter the movements to your needs.
-You don't mind non-traditional music for practicing.
-You don't mind voice over
-You don't mind choreography dancing and follow the leader style practice

You will not like this DVD if:
-You're totally new to belly dance or are still learning basic movements and would easily get confused if you had to add movements with traveling and arms.
-You're looking for something more aerobic or something which drills moves and/or breaks movements down and focuses on technique.
-You only want traditional music to practice to.
-You can't stand voice over
-You can't stand choreography or follow the leader practice

Overall I think this DVD is a great deal and a good practice companion for any dancer who has a grasp of basic technique (or isn't afraid of a challenge!)",1295308800,4,3880,4.590187590187591
3794756,3,B001TZ70DU,"I've been a dancer three years now, and have amasses a few videos over the years. This one is ok. Nothing spectacular, just ok. The I am a Goddess song at the end of the work out I think I can do without a little cheesy for me.

Only few problems with this video. There is no warm up or cool down, both vitally important when dancing/working out. Also some of the explanations really aren't the best, if you've never danced before go through the tutorial, some of the names used for the moves threw me a little too, referring to a Maya as an upward infinity loop, and all figure 8's as a type of infinity loop was a little strange. The reliance in knees for some of the sharper movement was a little concerning too, technique and muscles should be used instead on knees this prevents injury. Not the best for beginners.

I do like the combination and the workout portion and will use it for those reasons.",1293926400,8,905,4.317647058823529
3794757,5,B001TZ70DU,"Although I have a vast library of belly dance instructional videos ranging from Egyptian to Turkish, this video is by far my favorite!

The dance is very sensual, yet it is an effective workout. The plus is that you actually end up with a dance that can be performed once you've learned all the moves and choreography. The movements are flowy and feminine and are quite enjoyable to watch. I viewed the performances several times before starting the actual instruction.  A swing dancer first, I have only been belly dancing for a couple of years, so I always enjoy the opportunity to refresh myself on the basics of posture, frame, etc.

The style seems to be somewhat eclectic, and I believe the variety of moves can be adapted to any specific genre.

I especially appreciated the section on arm work (and not just snake arms), as well as the facial expressions and head placement, as we don't often remember to consciously think of these things during exercise or performance, especially if you are a newbie.  Overall, a great buy for content, fitness, and fun!!! I would definitely recommend...",1293840000,3,1097,4.8138297872340425
3794758,4,B001TZ70DU,"...that seem like they easily could have been eliminated

But let's go over the good stuff first!

There are seven dance sequences to learn. Each one of them has 4 or more combination of 8 to 16 beats in it that you can easily memorize and apply to other music. Though I knew the moves as an intermediate belly dancer, it really helped me to have them put into a usable sequence. And I don't have my usual gripe here--not enough repetition--there was plenty.

There are practice flows you can use that are identified in such a way that you can learn specific moves before you do a specific dance sequence.

The not so great stuff. In this video, like the previous one- Luscious, there is an overlaying of the voice instruction. That is, the dancers just dance and smile into the camera and the voice instruction is added later--with about 50% accuracy with the left right left thing--and sometimes it's late, early, or missing. Neon seems like she can't hear the music at times. I don't know why they didn't re-do some of those scenes but there are three of them so you don't have to look at her when she's off. In any case, you wind up getting to know the steps by using the DVD every day and watching rather than listening. Oh yeah---the number of repetitions aren't very consistent so I don't know that I'll ever turn the voice instruction completely off.

Yet, I have to say it's a good work out--not strenuous exactly but...How do I describe it. As I used it more and more I used the right muscles instead of depending on my legs to help. I used deeper and deeper layers of muscle too. And the way the sequences are laid out all my muscles get stretched out. I've been doing a few sequences daily and my hips are finally feeling like they are staying stretched out.

I'm happy with this purchase. It has it's flaws, but I highly recommend it.",1293235200,2,1847,4.433628318584071
3794759,3,B001TZ70DU,"This is a very good video to learn precise belly-dance moves, but it does not feel like a workout.  I prefer Neena & Veena's workouts, more bouncy and fun.  This is for the serious belly-dancer only.",1288051200,4,199,4.5
3794760,5,B001TZ70DU,"I have quite a few belly dance workouts and so far this is my favourite. I love luscious as well but much prefer Love Potion, probably as I am a gymnastics coach and have done many different dance styles, and Love Potion is a stronger workout, I actually feel it in my waist when I do it, the dance is more fun and the music in it is sensational.
I am going to purchase Hard Candy next as I really like the way these dvds are formulated. I am always happy to do this dance workout, it makes me sweat and feel good.

3794761,5,B001TZ70DU,"I have had experience in belly dancing, and wanted to see how a ""workout"" like this one would be in terms of authenticity to the art form. I did not try the ""Luscious"" precursor to this DVD, as I figured I could jump to this intermediate-level belly dance workout because of my previous experience. I can say that it is a professionally-done instructional video that integrates many of the basics of belly dance technique, then applies them to choreographed sequences set to music. I am glad that this is more of an authentic dance experience versus an actual ""workout"" per se; if I wanted a real cardiovascular workout, I'd do a kickboxing or dance conditioning video that is targeted primarily toward fitness. I consider this DVD something of a respite from the conventional and pragmatic goals of a workout, as this is more of an artistic, femininely aesthetic experience than anything else. I does work one's core muscles, especially those of the lower back and abdominals, and definitely tests one's coordination and rhythm. There is a tutorial that breaks down the movements slowly and microscopically, then a practice flow that gradually builds on the basic movements that are to be used in the ""Love Potion"" workout. The ""Love Potion"" 40-minute segment itself goes at a good clip, and so if one is not quite familiar with stringing together the movements in succession, one can always refer back to the practice flow. This is a workout with which one can grow and master over time, which makes it a great deal; it is almost like being in a real belly dance class, where one can easily go at one's own pace and repeat sections as needed to perfect one's form. The music is appropriate, and true enough to the ethnic sounds and rhythms of Middle Eastern music to be a nice accompaniment to the dancing. I have only tried this workout once so far, and have yet to be able to fluently follow the choreography to the expert cuing of the instructors. I'm sure with practice it will be possible to look as fluid, sensual, and lovely as the professionals teaching this art form. Highly recommended for those interested more in a genuine belly dance experience than a heart-pounding workout (although I did work up a respectable sweat in both the practice flow and the ""Love Potion"" workout).",1280880000,3,2291,4.773299748110831
3794762,5,B001TZ70DU,"First of all i loved it!  There was a lot said in previous reviews that I agree with.  This is definitely the sequel to Luscious another wonderful bellydancing workout dvd by the same dancers Blanca, Neon, and Sarah Skinner.
Most of the moves are repeats from Luscious however this dvd has more choreography, and is a lot more fun.  For a beginner like myself it was a nice transition from Luscious to a more sophisticated and slightly advanced dance.  Neon, who does the tutorial is an amazing dancer and wears clothing that shows her leg movements well. There are five parts to this dvd

1. Love potion Music and voice cues
  is the choreography of love potion with voice cues
2. Love potion music only
  The choreography of love potion without voice cues, so you have the music if you want to perform the dance for someone
3. Step by step tutorial

This section is divided into five parts.  The dvd will take you to a menu where you can choose which section you would like to go to.  You can go through all of it at once of course or if you are wanting a quick review of the 3/4ths shimmy then you can go directly to it.  Here is what each section consists of.
  Section a. hip circle, pelvic circle, chest circle, horizontal hip figure 8, vertical hips figure 8, reversed verticla figure 8
  Section b. Undulation and chest lift and pelvic tuck./release, reversed undulation,
  section c. Hip, drop, hip twist, hip arc
  Section d. Shimmy, 3/4 up shimmy, 3/4 down shimmy, Arabic hip walk in great detail!
  section e. Finally snake arms

4. practice flow music and voice cues
This section includes the floor work for the dance so you have an idea of what you will be doing during the dance.  Very helpful for someone like me who needs extra work memorizing the choreography.

5. practice flow music only
  This is the same as the practice flow however there are not voice cues so you're on your own.

This is a fun and sensual workout.  The music is beautiful and the dance looks great.  You can view parts of the dvd on youtube, which may help you make up your mind.  It might give you an idea of what to expect.  Neon has another new dvd called Hard Candy, which is now also available on amazon.  I hope this was helpful.  :)",1266364800,4,2231,4.411330049261084
3794763,5,B001TZ70DU,"This ""sequel"" to Luscious is great.

This is very much an intermediate work out, but with a bit of practice, and working your way through the tutorial and ""practice"" flow, an (advanced) beginner can master this workout.

One of the things I just love about this is that it's just the right length for popping it in to the DVD after work, going through all the sections, and feeling like I got a workout, AND got to practice my dancing to boot.

My favorite part is the shimmy section. It's fun, I love the music, and you really feel like you are dancing.

There is only one thing that I don't care for and it's the ""Fire Goddess"" song in the last segment. Just a bit too new-agey for me, but your mileage may vary.",1265760000,2,714,4.266666666666667

3794765,5,B001TZ70DU,"Love Potion provides great non-stop drills for intermediate dancers.  There are also tutorials and ""practice flow"" for beginners.  I don't think a pure beginner could learn to dance only from this DVD, but it would make a great practice for ""between"" classes.

The style is ""classic"" bellydance.  Nothing specialized - just graceful universal moves suitable to all styles.

This DVD gets 5 stars for a menu that is easy to navigate.  The camera angles and voice-overs are well-done and you even have the option to skip the voice-over once you learn the routine/s.

The costumes are lovely, but not ""overdone"" so you can see the dancers' movements.  All 3 dancers are in synch and all have a pleasant style.  The choreography is excellent for a beginner-intermediate DVD.  Simple & elegant - not dumbed-down. This DVD is one of the few that actually delivers exactly what it says on the box.

The DVD starts with a ""Welcome"" from Neon, who talks about how absolute beginners can benefit from this instruction, but so can dancers at all levels, and how belly dance strengthens your muscles and helps you to become more flexible, something our bodies need desperately in our ""sit in the car...the office...on the sofa"" lifestyle. This really applies to those of us in our ""golden years,"" and belly dance can be the most enjoyable and satisfying form of exercise we can do.

There are 2 tutorials on this DVD that are wonderful, and break down each movement and its technique. These sections are excellent for beginners, and also for more advanced students who want to refine their style and skill. The Love Potion Workout section is the one that makes this one of my most favorite instruction DVDs that I own. It is non-stop dancing, with each instructor taking turns with a segment that has a theme: ""Eternal Feminine,"" with Neon, ""Mystery,"" with Blanca, ""Seductress,"" with Sarah Skinner, etc., for 40 marvelous minutes. It's a superb way to practice the movements and as exercise it is fun as well as efficient. There is also the option to play it with voice-over instruction, or just music.

Extremely well produced, planned, and executed, this DVD is a 5 star winner. The music also adds to what makes it so good, and includes selections by DJ Zen, Phil Thornton and Hossan Ramzy, Giacomo Biondi, and Raul Ferrando.

I think this video would be good for new dancers too because all the practice dances are fluid, unlike the typical beginner combinations that just put moves together awkwardly to practice through repetition, and advice is given about where to keep your gaze and your arms, which are often overlooked in beginner's tutorials.
My only problem with this video is not a problem with the video but with amazon. There is only an option to rent the video on amazon video and not to buy it permanently, and to rent it cost $9 and you only get it for 7 days.
