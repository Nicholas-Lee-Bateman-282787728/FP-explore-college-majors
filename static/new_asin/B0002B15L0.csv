2073650,4,B0002B15L0,It is adorable-the music keeps my kids going-all the cute little situations that Strawberry and company get into is so funny and keeps them glued to the show.,1104969600,2,158,4.678571428571429
2073651,1,B0002B15L0,"As my almost 4-year-old daughter is a big Strawberry Shortcake fan, we snapped up this title as soon as it was released and were very unhappily surprised to find the story included a villain and a storyline my daughter found to be disturbing and scary.  She was horrified to see Honey Pie and the other ponies locked up in a cage, despite the ponies ultimate escape.  Needless to say, my daughter took an active dislike to this video and insisted that the DVD be banished from our home.  Moms beware.  This release does not hold true to the sweet stories typical in the first three Strawberry Shortcake VHS/DVD titles.  I don't know what DiC Enterprises was thinking when they tinkered with the format.  If future releases continue in this fashion, we will not be buying.",1101859200,13,771,4.674074074074074
2073652,5,B0002B15L0,"I am a macho fan of Strawberry Shortcake and all the things that involve her. Since I was a tot, I was obsessed with her. Now that she has made a return, I see that ,other than her outift, the whole attitude of the story has changed, making it more like a self help movie than an adventure story. The first 4 DVD's were OK, but too preachy sounding. This new DVD features 2 adventurous set around a berry special memory book Strawberry keeps. The 2 adventures involve a magical place called Ice Cream Islands and the sweet, My Little Pony style, fillies. There are 2 new characters, a Purple Pieman style gent named Licorice Whip and his Bery bird Raven. With magical fillies and a mischievious * but not too scary* villan, Strawberry Shortcakes Adventures on Ice Cream Island is sure to make your day Berry sweet:}",1095724800,8,815,4.513513513513513
2073653,5,B0002B15L0,"I know as an adult I may not fully appreciate this CD, but my rating is based on the fact that my grandkids (even the boy), love watching this video over and over again. What else can I say?",1290384000,,190,3.8974358974358974
2073654,3,B0002B15L0,"My daughter is almost 3 and loves Strawberry Shortcake.  I thought she would really like this because it has horses too, but it has turned out to not be our favorite.  The movie is very cute but just not a hit at our house.",1252713600,,223,4.045454545454546
2073655,5,B0002B15L0,"My 4.5 year-old preschooler loves Strawberry Shortcake and her friends, and we own most of the DVDs. In this collection, Strawberry Shortcake and her friends have some fun adventures with their horse friends. In ""Horse of a Different Color"", Honey Pie Pony visits Ice Cream Island and has lots of fun with her other horse pals, but when she realizes her human friends miss her, she decides to return home. In ""Festival of the Fillies"", Honey Pie and some of the other horses become targets of a mean show horse owner, and Strawberry and friends get together to help them escape.

The songs have an infectious beat and my girl memorizes them in no time at all. I love these shows because the language is 'clean', and there's always a positive message behind the stories, emphasizing values like true friendship, helping each other out, etc. Highly recommended for children ages 4-8.",1251331200,,881,4.8344370860927155
2073656,5,B0002B15L0,"We own all of the Strawberry Shortcake DVDs, and this is one my girls (7 & 5) watch over and over.  My 5-year-old is a ""horse girl, and she especially likes the story being told from Honey Pie's prespective.  Good lesson that we all need friends like us as well as friends not so much like us.  The second episode didn't bother my girls - they viewed it as a mystery.  In the end, the raven is so moved by the friendship between the girls and Honey Pie that he helps Strawberry Shortcake.",1164931200,,488,4.21505376344086
2073657,1,B0002B15L0,"Strawberry Shortcake was my Favorite thing when I was little.  So, naturally, I started looking for some of the old movies for my little girl.  I really don't like the new look of Strawberry Shortcake and her friends, but bought this DVD for my daughter anyway.  I love the smell of the DVD case, it smells just like my SSC doll that blows kisses that I got when I was 5.  But the stories are really stupid, and the songs are painfully done.  I don't know why they had to dumb it down so much.  I personally miss the cuteness of the classic, as well as Sour Grapes and the Purple Pie Man.  The villain in this is just rediculous.  My daughter does like the first story, but won't watch the second one,(She's 3) the bad guy really bugs her.  So, I am back to searching for the classics.  I wish they would just put the old ones on DVD.",1143936000,4,834,4.15625
2073658,5,B0002B15L0,Strawbery Shortcake movies are one of the best selections you can get for your kids.  Your children will learn things that will help them deal with everyday issues.  I like the cartoon because you can understand all of it.  It's not like some cartoons today that the parents have to wonder what it is teaching.  The Strawberry Shortcake cartoons are great.,1126742400,2,356,4.786885245901639
2073659,4,B0002B15L0,"There is no reason for the songs to be SO painful to listen to. The story is sweet, there is a bad guy but he is not dreadful.  My daughter and niece love this one, especially the ponies. The girls don't seem to notice how bad the songsa are so it is only grating on my nerves.  Certainly not a timeless treasure but cute and fun nonetheless and harmless in spite of the BAD GUY",1126224000,2,378,4.026666666666666
2073660,4,B0002B15L0,"My daughters 8 and 4 love horses.  So naturaly they love this DVD, however they hate the ""bad guy"" in it.  All the Strawberry Shortcake DVDs we own are very happy so I thought this one would be like the others.  They love the 1st episode on this DVD, but not so much the 2nd.  Too bad the 2nd one has to be about a greedy guy who kidnaps Strawberry's horse!",1125878400,5,357,3.9859154929577465
2073661,5,B0002B15L0,I love the smell of the dvds! This was a very berry cute movie lol It has two stories on it 1 where they go to ice cream island because the horse wants to be with more horses and the other where they go back to ice cream island to see the parade of the follies. It also has a strawberry music video! I found this for a great price at 1 of my local stores! i got 2 strawberry dvds for 12.00 dollars,1117238400,,397,3.738095238095238
2073662,5,B0002B15L0,"As a parent, I welcome any Strawberry Shortcake DVD into my home because I know that my girls will not only be entertained but get a lesson or two as well.  And the songs are so catchy we bought the SSC Seaberry Beach Party Music CD to jam to in the car!

 In Adventures on Ice Cream Island, SSC is looking through her ""remembering book"" and tells two tales to Honey Pie Pony.  In the first story, HPP feels lonely because she is the only filly in Strawberryland.  SSC and her friends search for other horses to make her feel more at home.  On Ice Cream Island, HPP realizes that true friends don't have to look ""just like you.""

In the second story, the friends return to the island for the Festival of the Fillies. HPP, the Grand Marshall, will lead fillies Orange Twist, Cookie Dough, and Milkshake in the parade.  But resident meanies Licorice Whip and Raven spot HPP standing on her head and plot to horse-nap this talented horse for their show.  My three-year-old daughter was a little disturbed by Licorice Whip the first time through.  Now she asks for the DVD and is not bothered at all.

Songs on this DVD:
""Prancing Paradise""
""Back Together""
""Festival of the Fillies""
""My Gift Horse Gift""
""Tell Me A Story"" - as a separate music video
