6130253,4,B00H3T4MQO,"Great release! A lot of cartoons from the 1990s get cheaper releases with sub-par sound and video, this is not the case with Beetlejuice. It looks great, sounds great, and it's still funny. All the gross-out humor is still just as good as it was back watching this on Saturday mornings.",1404691200,,286,4.627450980392157

6130272,3,B00H3T4MQO,"I love the series but I was not impressed with this DVD set. I have the season 1 set also and the picture quality was fantastic; this set, not so much. The picture and sound quality were what I would expect from recording directly from standard cable on a 20 year old VCR.",1474070400,,272,4.150943396226415

6130275,5,B00H3T4MQO,"It is exactly how I remember it. If you were a fan growing up it is definitely worth a look. It's gross, funny, and sweet in equal measure. I think todays kids would enjoy it too, I know I sure did when I was little.",1471651200,,216,3.8222222222222224
6130276,5,B00H3T4MQO,"A very distinguishable cartoon considering the generation which produced it...lots of movies have been turned into cartoons, and vice versa...this is one example of how a more adult dark/comedy reached a younger audience through the lense of animation! Tim Byrton has his name attached alongside many many animated endeavors. His stylized view of characters and their stories also inspired the Batman:TAS cartoon; using his color pallet and character intensity. Beetlejuice was his first film to be adapted into an animated world. This cartoon is absolutely, unequivocally a TRUE ORIGINAL. A forgotten gem that deserves a tremendous publicity jolt to remind kids of BJ again! It had a huge fanbase and when I came across it the first thing I said (out loud) ""oh damn! How could I have forgotten this!?!?"" With an opening theme and title song that once heard again will take you back 20+ years (I.e. I'm 32 lol) .....",1471478400,2,916,5.032894736842105

6130283,5,B00H3T4MQO,"I am a huge BeetleJuice fan and use to watch this television show on Saturday mornings while eating cereal. Those were some of my best childhood memories so I was happy to find the series on DVD. This is one of the funniest cartoons ever created and even though I am an adult, I still laugh out loud when watching it. This cartoon is becoming a fast classic in my household and my daughter is constantly asking to watch episodes. This is a great find and worth the purchase, you will not regret it!!",1461628800,,499,4.319148936170213
6130284,5,B00H3T4MQO,"I grew up on this show as a child, and I was dying to have my 6 year old son watch it.  He loves it.  He likes how creepy the intro to the show is, and he loves the characters.  He likes that Beetlejuice and Lydia are always getting into trouble.  He also thinks all the bugs, sandworms, creatures, etc. are hysterical.  This show is awesome for any kid (or adult) who likes crude humor and gross stuff.  It isn't inappropriate at all, but it does involve a lots of creepy crawly things:)  A great buy!",1458777600,,502,4.166666666666667
6130285,5,B00H3T4MQO,"Awesome DVD. Brings me to my childhood. Got this for my daughter for her birthday since she loves the movie, I thought I would shock her and show her there was a cartoon! :)",1457308800,,173,4.117647058823529

6130294,5,B00H3T4MQO,"There are no extras, but it's still worth it!

I remember watching this when I was a kid in the mornings, and then later in the afternoons over at my best friend's house. It was funny with great voice acting and good animation. And, as far as I'm concerned, it stands the test of time. There are also great messages to be found within the episodes about how just because someone is different doesn't mean they're bad or not worth knowing, and about doing the right thing no matter what, and how decisions you make have consequences. These aren't told to the viewers in after-episode morals like in cartoons from the 80's (not that there's anything wrong with doing that, too), but they don't need to be. It's easy to get the moral of the story without having it spoon-fed to you. I think this would be a great addition to any child's cartoon library. Great fun for kids, or for the whole family. And if you're like me and grew up watching the show and want to add it to your collection of shows you used to watch and still love, it's definitely worth it!

The only thing I have to complain about is, as I mentioned before, there are no extras and it would have been fun to have some cast interviews and commentary added to the DVDs. In addition, it appears that in order to get season 4, you have to buy the entire series in a single box set since they apparently didn't release it on its own.

Still, I don't think that's enough to knock off a star.",1443398400,3,1450,4.304029304029304

6130305,4,B00H3T4MQO,I remember this from my childhood and it it funny and a bit deadly-vu! I like that the two seasons were combined into one set and how some of the episodes are paired together so that it runs smoothly despite some of them varying in length. I just wish the same company would release the fourth season by itself...otherwise you need to buy the whole pack which costs quite a bit.,1420416000,,378,4.338028169014085
