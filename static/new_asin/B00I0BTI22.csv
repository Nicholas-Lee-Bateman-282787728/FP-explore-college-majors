8637938,5,B00I0BTI22,"I own several CDs by Eldar Nebolsin and have enjoyed each very much.  He really loves the romantic piano literature.

 It was a great pleasure to finally be able to watch him play - to see the intensity and focus in his face- but most of all to witness the sheer enjoyment he derived in playing every note.  On this DVD I found the Rachmaninov the best overall - the beautiful interior of the Capella Concert Hall is captured in various camera angles whereas the lighting was much brighter and harsher in the Tchaikovsky and washed out the colors.  But that is a minor point.

That being said, the several cameras used to capture all three concerts made this DVD a pleasure to watch.  In each concerto, as the score featured an interlude played by a  specific musician or group of musicians ( such as the first violins or the woodwinds or others ) the camera switched in sync with the music to focus on those musicians and then back again to the featured pianist and then on to others.  The camera angles changing smoothly with the music made this DVD a joy to watch, almost as if I were in the front row and my eyes were moving effortlessly to each part of the orchestra as they lifted their instruments to take on a featured role for a moment.  I own several other DVDs of concerts, but this has quickly become my favorite.  Highly recommended!",1429660800,,1346,4.430894308943089
