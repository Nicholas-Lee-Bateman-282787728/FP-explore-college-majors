8038493,2,B00064ALMM,"Jeff ( Adam Baldwin) is a script writer down on his luck because of that ""truth"" incident. He is asked to write a bloody horror script by George (Udo Kier) of True Films. The script concerns a family massacre that took place 35 years ago which we see at the beginning of the film. As Jeff attempts to unravel what happened, weird thing happen around him. Oh. And Jeff is about 35 and the woman who was killed was pregnant, but no word on the fetus.

The film is one of those that manages to suck you in and hold your interest as you wait for it to go somewhere, and when it does, ho-hum. Acting fair, but the script needed something other than a guy picking up an axe wrong and mom jerking around with a toaster in the dishwater.

Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity. Woman smearing blood on herself in a passionate manner.

8038494,2,B00064ALMM,"Evil Eyes is about a screenwriter that comes up with a script that eventually comes true in reality piece by piece.  Sounds enticing on paper, however we quickly learn that the lack of suspense and a really big dilemma in the pacing is responsible for almost completely destroying this movie.  Yes, these events that the screenwriter jots down comes true, however it's executed in a way that's unsatisfying and unsuspenseful almost every single time.

For example, he predicts an earthquake.  Instead of witnessing the after effects of an earthquake, the ground shakes for a couple seconds before the screenwriter and his wife contemplate what just occurred.  A woman is predicted to be decapitated in her car after an accident.  It happens but... in a really cheesy murder/mystery kind of way.  A major disappointment.  The seen with a hunk of flying wood from a baseball bat going through a catchers neck is the only moment that caught my attention even though we knew it was coming a mile away.  I think you'd be better off not seeing this movie.",1355011200,,1049,4.848314606741573
8038495,3,B00064ALMM,"Evil Eyes (Mark Atkins, 2004)

I couldn't resist this one. Yes, it's an Asylum picture, and Asylum have always been awful (even before they started making SyFy Channel Original silliness pitting one huge mythical sea creature against another, which has been their bread and butter for the last few years), but dude, it's Adam Baldwin and Udo Kier. In an Asylum Pictures release. WHAT. Okay, so that demands some looking into, methinks.

Baldwin plays Jeff Stenn, a screenwriter whose career is on the downslide after an incident about which we never find out about much (though Stenn says, in a heated phone conversation, it had something to do with his unwillingness to bend the truth). Just when things are looking their worst, Stenn gets a call from George (Kier), a producer from a small company called Trufilms, who want to do a more commercial project than the art-house films they've done during their first years of existence. They're looking at adapting the story of a director, Gramm (Intermedio's Eric Caselton), who went crazy and killed his entire family, then committed suicide, after coming to believe that the script he was writing for a movie he was working on was actually coming true. Stenn needs the money, and thus takes the job...and soon finds the same thing happening to him. But they still need the money, so he packs up his wife Tree (Blurred Vision's Jennifer Gates in her feature debut) and moves to the house where it all happened to get rid of his writer's block. Despite having a very, very good reason for keeping it in place.

Yes, there are many things about this movie that don't measure up, and yes, I may be being a little less hard on it than I otherwise would since I can't help but compare it to the other mess I saw this weekend (Bane, q.v.), but it wasn't all that bad. Especially not for an Asylum joint. Atkins (Dragonquest), who also did the cinematography, isn't entirely incompetent, though there are parts of this movie that could certainly have been shot better, and screenwriter Naomi Selfman (#1 Cheerleader Camp) manages to make it almost all the way through without messing up; she blows the ending, yes, but it's not nearly as off the cliff as the ending of Bane. Baldwin and Kier are good actors most of the time, and they turn in performances good enough here to at least keep your attention, while some of the minor cast is decent and some are bad, but obviously there for comic effect (Stenn's former agent Bob is an obvious example). Short answer: go into it thinking about the average quality of Asylum pictures, rather than the average quality of all horror flicks, and you may find yourself pleasantly surprised. ** ",1282608000,3,2678,4.740343347639485

8038498,2,B00064ALMM,"EVIL EYES is a derivative a la Stephen King/Dean Koontz variety.  A failing screenwriter (Adam Baldwin) is approached by a mysterious ""agent"" (Udo Keir) to write the screenplay based on a true story of a screenwriter who went mad and killed his mother, father and wife.  As Baldwin begins writing his screenplay, it seems that the things he is writing start to come true, with tragic results for some of his friends.

Veiled in inexplicable ambiguity, EVIL EYES never fully explains what is going on so the viewer is left with no sense of resolution or understanding.  Vague film making at the least.",1127952000,,600,4.796116504854369
8038499,3,B00064ALMM,"Evil Eyes is the story of a writer, portrayed by Adam Baldwin, that finds that what he writes comes true, in a tale eerily similar to the true crime movie he happens to be working on. In that case, a writer director turned serial killer after everything he wrote came true.

However, while this movie had the power to be fun and scary, like Stephen King's Dark Half, I had a few problems with the film.

One: The editing style on the film is choppy, and the story jerks around quite a bit. Several times you're left wondering if what you saw actually transpired or if it only occurred within the realm of the story.

Two: Even after one of his best friends is killed in a manner parallels a story he just wrote, the writer continues to picture friends in the scenes, or to write scenes about people he knows. This doesn't seem very logical to me.

Over all this is one of the better films to be produced by Asylum lately, and it shows their growth as a movie house.",1115078400,,965,4.285714285714286
8038500,1,B00064ALMM,"Are all screenwriters narcissistic? Seems like a lot of them think that their life is so interesting that it deserves to be told to the whole world as a feature film. In a best case scenario, you get Charlie Kaufman's Adaptation... which I liked because it took that narcissism and made fun of it. In a worst case scenario you get Evil Eyes.

For the whole movie, the main character goes around doing screenwriter things: talking to his agent, trying to get some job at Dreamworks, complaining about how no one understands his art... etc. Just like Charlie Kaufman in Adaptation, but without any of the style.

Boring, boring, boring.

About twenty minutes in, our protagonist gets a job offer. It comes from a strange foreign gentleman (a la Angel Heart) and soon he's off writing a MOW about a guy who killed his wife. Pretty soon, he becomes convinced that the words that he writes can actually kill. If anyone out there has ever read the Stephen King short story called Word Processor of the Gods, you'll recognize the plot... that's clearly what the writer stole... Er... was inspired by.",1109635200,2,1093,4.712041884816754
