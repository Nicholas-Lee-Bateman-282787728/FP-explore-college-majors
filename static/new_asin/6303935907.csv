Episode Five: Destroy The Dam. The Evil Emperor's horticultural horror, the infamous Gargoyle Vine is back! A colossal new sprout rises up out of a lake and swallows up all the water. Bombing attacks only fuel it with needed energy, and soon the treacherous tree is spewing flaming-hot lava bombs! Suddenly the whole area is ablaze, and residents must run for their lives. Johnny Sokki spies an upstream dam and devises a plan. With a one-two mega-ton punch, Giant Robot easily smashed through the barrier. Torrents of water douse the flames and stifle the monster plant. Finally, Giant Robot moves in for an explosive victory, vanquishing the plant with a hefty spread of missiles! You lose again, Guillotine!

Episode Six: The Transformed Humans. The Gargoyle Gans has unleashed another terrifying monster -- big enough to swallow an entire train! On board is a Unicorn Chief who is taken hostage and transformed into a cyborg! Now a Gargoyle pawn, the Chief attempts to steal top-secret plans. Everyone is wary of his odd behavior! While investigating, Johnny Sokko and his partner Jerry are captured and taken to Gargoyle headquarters. Meanwhile, the giant monster has embarked on a spree of destruction. Johnny manages to radio Giant Robot, who valiantly fights, flings the wounded monster into the sea, and rescues the captured agents from certain doom. In time the Chief will recover. Another heroic Unicorn triumph!

Clearly primitive special effects, but I liked it then, when the special effects were what I really appreciated.
If your over 35 (my age)  you will be taken back for sure",1085961600,5,292,4.7254901960784315
