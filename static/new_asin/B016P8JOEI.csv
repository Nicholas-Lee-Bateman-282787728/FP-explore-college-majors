7479052,5,B016P8JOEI,"This is the perfect family film, with something for everyone age five to a hundred and five! The story was moving, the sets were authentic, the costumes were perfect for the period, and the acting was superb--each character brought a strength to the film that was unique and compelling. I was thoroughly pulled into the story, hissing for the bad guy and cheering for the many, many good guys. The end was completely satisfying and left me feeling inspired, heartened, and believing that miracles DO come--in many ways, shapes, and sizes. What a great film for the Christmas season (and beyond)!",1446508800,6,595,4.900990099009901
7479053,5,B016P8JOEI,"We sat down and watched Miracle Maker as a family yesterday, just in time for today's release date. All of my children enjoyed it and mom shed a few tears at the sweet message of hope. It's a Christmas tale of planting seeds for a later harvest, softening bitter hearts and how one person can make a difference. My children noticed the Charles Dickens Scrooge parallels. They have seen a few other movies by Mainstay productions and recognized many of the cast members from last year's Christmas Dragon. Their suggestions would be to reach out and include a few more new actors and be careful of costuming. My son was bothered that a few of the costumes looked ""modern.""

Would we recommend buying or gifting this movie? Absolutely! It is heart warming and simple and just in time for the Holidays.

Highly recommended as a clean movie for the whole family.",1446508800,3,857,4.66887417218543

7479083,2,B016P8JOEI,"The Spirit of the movie was a good one, and there were some genuinely cute parts.  The kids were cute, and the two old ladies who were always gossiping and joking were also cute.  But some parts were way too contrived to be plausible.  And the resolution, while nice, just seemed kind of-- put there.  There were also plot holes that one could drive a truck through, really.  Not a small truck.  One of those big ones, from Kennecott.  Questions that are brought up that just don't get answered.  And that was frustrating for me because I did want to like this movie.  The makers of this movie have made some incredibly good movies in the past like 17 Miracles, but this was just not up to the same quality.  Hopefully, their future movies will go back up to the quality of past movies.  I know they can do it.",1453075200,,810,4.333333333333333

7479091,5,B016P8JOEI,"Miracle Maker (A Christmas Tale) is movie that tells the story of how hope can be restored in peoples lives when they open their hearts.  Each characters life reflected in different ways how believing outside the box we put God in can affect us so much that we look up.  In each situation, the false beliefs had to be let go in order for truth to come in the hearts of each persons life.
Some of the movie was really cute such as one little girl who tends to speak her mind sometimes to the embarrassment of parents; yet, who also is able to rally other children to confront a man.  This man is living with the loss of his wife years prior and then choosing to distance himself from others.  He is touched by the bravery of this little girl.  Whether loss of loved ones, job, hunger and other life experiences that burdened the hearts of the town folks, being at the end of their own abilities viewers can see God transform people.  To me that is the miracle this movie reflects most of all that God can and does make a major difference in our lives and He is reflected in our speech actions and life.  While the miracle maker is believed to be a man who shows up in a town, the true miracle worker is the Creator of heaven and earth.  The movie is a family friendly drama which lasts 90 minutes and is one to watch again and again.
So in light of all the traumatic events that have happened around the world, this is one movie that will lighten the hearts and restore the hope of all who view the DVD.  Consider giving this DVD to family or friends or anyone you know who might need some encouragement this year.  Enjoy the Christmas tale and don't forget to read about the best miracle, Jesus Christ, who came to save the world.",1449187200,10,1730,4.2629969418960245

7479093,2,B016P8JOEI,"I guess I'm the only who didn't really love this movie. There were some cute parts, especially the children and the older ladies, but the whole plot just seemed too contrived for me. The conflict between the miserly renter and his daughter was too unrealistic for me. No one makes his adult daughter stay in the house all day. At the end his heart softened, but the resolution was very low key. The plot seemed disjointed and slow moving.  I had to swallow my incredulity at the end when the one lady had her baby in less than two minutes in the back of a wagon with the townspeople gathered around with only one gasp.  Yes, it was a sweet movie, but nothing I could relate to.",1447891200,5,677,4.322834645669292
7479094,5,B016P8JOEI,"My neighbor and I both loved watching this movie. And I love it when I find a clean, wholesome, family friendly show that teaches values that seem to be lacking in today's society. I strongly recommend this movie. It would make a great gift to your family, friends and neighbors. This movie teaches Christian values.",1447632000,2,316,4.763636363636364
7479095,5,B016P8JOEI,"This is the story of a small town that is struggling. Mr. Booth owns the town and he's a bit of a miser. He's firm and controls his daughter's life. We learn about some different families that are having difficulties keeping current on their rent. After a sermon on miracles, the children decide they need a miracle maker and soon that's the talk of the town. A young boy who hasn't spoken since the death of his parents sends a pigeon with a message. They soon receive a telegraph that a miracle maker is coming. When he arrives, though, he wasn't what they were expecting.

This is a fantastic family film! I watched it with my children and we all enjoyed watching the transformation that happened in the town during the course of the movie. I enjoyed all the characters and thought the people of the town were portrayed well. I love Jasen Wade (the ""Miracle Maker"") and enjoyed his interactions with the townspeople. I especially got a kick out of how he paid for his bread. Even though times were tough, it's not all doom and gloom and there is some humor as well. There are two older women who have an opinion on everything and a young girl who isn't afraid of anyone in town.

Hearts were softened and friendships were formed or renewed. There were times I found myself waiting for something big to happen and took a few minutes when it was finished to reflect on the overall message and how it relates to me in my life. The message of love, hope, forgiveness, and miracles is one that I especially enjoy this time of year but I plan to watch it throughout the year as the message is timeless.

I received a link to review this movie for an honest review",1447113600,2,1660,4.4183006535947715
7479096,5,B016P8JOEI,"was able to watch this movie with my family over the weekend and we all loved it! I loved that the whole feel of the film is old time. The movie is filmed in places that look and feel old and the characters feel as though they were from that time period too.

I loved the littlest daughter of the shopkeeper, she really stole the whole show with her adorableness! But I also loved Sara and her brother too. And Lily and her love, their story was sweet too. And the two old ladies. And the woman who didn't get out of bed because of all of her aches and pains. And the shopkeeper who was willing to giveaway bread for rocks...I really could go on and on! I thought that all of the characters in this movie were played really well, they seemed as though they could step right off the screen and be who they were in the movie.

I loved the plot of this movie. The whole town was in need of miracles, and they got them, just not in the way that they were thinking they would.

This movie is one that my family wants to watch over and over, our daughters are already asking for it to be included in the Christmas movies we watch every year. I predict that it will be a holiday classic for many years to come!

I was able to view this movie early in exchange for writing a review.",1447113600,3,1274,4.084
7479097,5,B016P8JOEI,"Beautiful story of service and hope brought to a town badly in need of hope.  The story alludes to some parallels between the man who owns the town and Scrooge.  The miracle maker who visits the town is unassuming, giving service and teaching life lessons.  The story is beautifully portrayed and very heartwarming.  We watched it as a family on a busy school night when my older kids had much they needed and wanted to get done.  Yet, the whole family was wrapped up in the movie and watched till the very end.  It brought a feeling of peace and love into our home.",1447027200,,566,4.394230769230769
7479098,5,B016P8JOEI,"I had the privilege of previewing this movie for review and I have to tell you that I really loved it.  It is the perfect movie for this Christmas season.  Think snuggles on the couch, a bowl of popcorn and a message that leaves you feel good inside.

I love the the feeling of hope and healing.  I love the characters in this movie.  They did a great job of making this movie believable and real.  It never felt over the top or cheesy to me.  Every character in this movie is linked to another and as it seems like when one good thing happens, it is sort of like a domino effect.

The miracles come in gentle ways and bring peace and healing to one small town.  Like I said before, this is the perfect feel good movie for this holiday season.  I'm so glad I was able to watch this movie.  I cannot wait to share it with my family.  It's going to be a great gift for a few people on my Christmas list.  :)",1447027200,2,905,4.01685393258427
7479099,5,B016P8JOEI,"MY REVIEW:
The acting was ""top-notch""! Their on-scene personalities were so real - natural - one immediately felt endeared to each one...except the villain (he really fit the arrogant, pain in the behind, part!).
It was a well-written script for the most part. I do not feel any of the acting parts could have been better filled. It was a touching, captivating tale. even my husband - the movie critic - who doesn't feel like most movies are worth his time, actually enjoyed this one, also!
there was a scene at the first where an actor had a ""disfigurement""on one side and through the rest of the film it was on the opposite side, but most probably wouldn't notice that. The only other criticism I have is it ended too abruptly. I would ave preferred a little more viewer insight to dramatic changes. An additional fifteen to thirty minutes would have made it more meaningful. Still, it left one feeling ""in better spirit"" for watching it!
*I was allowed to view this DVD in exchange for an HONEST review, of which I have given.",1446854400,16,1029,4.5978260869565215
7479100,5,B016P8JOEI,"I loved this movie. I am a huge fan of Jasen Wade and he does not disappoint in this film.  There are so many fun characters, that there is someone for everyone to identify with. From cute precocious Rae Grant, to the delightful Agnes and Bessie.  The story tells of a young mute boy who sends a message via carrier pigeon, for a Miracle Maker to come to town. The townspeople are not faring well, money is tight, and Mr. Booth the richest man in town, who owns all the property, is a hard landlord.  When a telegraph comes that lets the people know that a Miracle Maker is coming to town, the excitement and anticipation builds.

But, the man who comes to town is not what they expect, he sets about doing small things, that make a difference.  And, in the end the townspeople realize that miracles don't have to be big to make a difference.  There are small miracles all around us, as Thomas Keating the preacher tells his congregation. We just have to recognize and give thanks for them.

There are many things to like about this film, and I will be giving it to family and friends for Christmas.  The acting and directing is solid, the characters get under your skin, and stay with you long after the movie is over.

Highly recommended for all ages.",1446681600,2,1253,4.413043478260869
7479101,4,B016P8JOEI,"I love it when I find true movies that inspire and leave you with a great feeling and most of all that are suitable for all ages. Mainstay Productions has launched an incredible movie, Miracle Maker that I am sure that you will want to add to your family's DVD collection and I know it has made its way into mine. This movie is perfect to begin the celebration into the holiday season.

It conveys the story similar to A Christmas Carol of sorts, a town that is hit hard not by financial issues, but simply struggling to make ends meet to pay the rent to Mr. Booth, the man who quite literally owns everything in the small town. It makes things downright difficult as some families struggle to put enough food on the table and still try to make the rent. One thing is for certain, Mr. Booth does not need the money. He is a selfish and stubborn old man, who is bound up by an event from the past in which his daughter Lily is almost killed in a buggy accident. He trusted her care into the town's preacher, Tom who brought her back that fateful night but was also forbidden to have any more contact with her.

Now Pastor Tom tries hard to convey his feelings to Lily, who remains confined in the house, while he tries to find ways to make amends to her father. His own mother has been confined to her bed since the death of her husband and now relies on Tom to help her out. The town desperately needs a miracle and soon a mute boy takes it upon himself to send a message of help for a miracle maker. What arrives in town is nothing short of a miracle as they soon discover that miracles don't come from any one person, but from the hope the town provides to those in need through what they can offer one another. As one seed of love and hope is planted, soon an abundance springs forth and restores the town to it's former glory.

I received the opportunity to view Miracle Maker before its release compliments of Mainstay Productions for my honest review. I did not receive any monetary compensation, aside from a link to watch the movie in exchange for my honest review. This is such a great family film because it shows how we can all begin planting our own seeds of love in a world that so desperately needs hope and faith. The DVD release of this movie is November 3rd nationwide and I hope you choose to add this to your DVD collection. For me, it will find a lasting home among mine and thus the reason for rating this movie a 4 out of 5 stars.",1446681600,2,2452,4.235042735042735

It's a message that everyone needs to hear. The acting is wonderful and it's easy to get swept up in the movie. I have loved this story for the first time I had the privilege of reading. They did a fantastic job of turning Ann's short story into a wonderful movie. My kids loved watching it with me and have asked questions about it since. I highly recommend this movie to everyone.",1446595200,,534,4.459183673469388
7479103,5,B016P8JOEI,"This was an outstanding film perfect for Christmas. I loved getting to know each character in this small town. I wanted to live among them. The people needed a miracle and when one gentleman named Matthew arrived, they thought he was the miracle maker. He didn't have much to offer except rocks. He was a hard worker and did all he could to help the people in Woodhaven. There were many things the townspeople needed and the miracle maker made it happen for them. He taught the town to believe.

There were many characters I enjoyed watching. Lilly was stuck in her home due to an accident. Her father thought he was protecting her but he was only hurting her from being with the one she loved. Gabriel's mother was ill but her character made me laugh. Will she ever leave her bed or will she stay there forever? Jenny and Elias own a store that is suffering. Will they be able to pay their rent and continue to sell supplies or will they struggle to meet ends meat? Overall, it was a powerful and touching story and I enjoyed it.

8736987,2,B016P8JOEI,"Where do I begin? There are some really attractive and talented actors in this film. The stand-out actor is the one portraying the littlest Grant Girl. As to the others, who directed them to read their lines to be: A. Ineffective and unemotional in some parts that should have been played to affect our hearts or B. Over-the-top? Also, who in the world filmed a Christmas movie that takes place IN THE SUMMER in the USA and the cottonwoods look like it's early spring? Even in the southwest the trees lose their leaves in the winter. I also noticed that in the center of town, in the middle of the street, there is a boardwalk that the stagecoach and riders must cross. Impractical considering it would have to be repaired weekly. The Christmas tree growing in the middle of the town keeps changing shape and size. . . and (SPOLIER ALERT)  it snows with everything in bloom.
Aside from that, this a sweet, entertaining film. The stand-out actor is the littlest Grant Girl.",1519430400,,972,4.618497109826589

It's done by a group of writers and techs who obviously love what they do.
