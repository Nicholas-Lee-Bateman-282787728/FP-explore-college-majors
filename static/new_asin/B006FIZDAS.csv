8496981,5,B006FIZDAS,"By far the best Alaska hunting DVDs available. Content is real, real Alaskan Trophies are harvested and Billy Molls is the real deal, no Hollywood producing, just real awesome hunting footage that all hunters want to see!",1491177600,,221,5.0
8496982,5,B006FIZDAS,"Just watched both Season 5 and 6 and they are outstanding. Both are now 2 discs each, which encompasses a lot more scenery, behind the scenes footage and reflections from Billy. The earlier videos had great footage, but it appears like he got an HD camera and is better at editing, as both these videos are very professional. You can tell by the relationships he has with coworkers and his hunters that he's a genuine guy, works hard and earns the respect others give him. I'll definitely keep buying future seasons",1489190400,,515,4.670329670329671
8496983,5,B006FIZDAS,"Modern Day Mountain Man DVDs are my favorite hunting videos.
 Billy is an excellent guide and is the kind of guy we need more on our TVs, a hard working family man!",1488153600,,164,4.125

8496985,5,B006FIZDAS,"Season 5 ""Modern Day Mountain Man"" is the latest addition to Billy Molls self produced guiding Alaskan Big Game DVD's. The quality of his filming in often difficult conditions, some how each video just gets better. This DVD has breathtaking scenery, it makes you feel a part of every hunt and he captures the intensity before and the excitement after the shot. He shares his passion with every Hunter. The scenes flying in a Super Cub along the Alaska Peninsular and through the Brooks Range offer a different view most of us will never experience. Billy's tips on skinning your animal, meat preparation, his suggestions on hunting gear add that extra interest. I looked for DVDs before I hunted Alaska, and Billy Molls produced the best ones I found by far. Now that I have hunted Alaska, I appreciate his videos even more. It looks like he has 2 cameramen, but I emailed him and he said he films it all himself!!! The video is actually 2 DVDs, and close to 5 hours long, not the 60-70 mins. of most DVDs. My mates and I watched the entire video in one sitting!. I always read reviews before I buy anything online, I appreciate it when I buy something that surpasses my expectations. This video does just that.",1327968000,2,1211,4.585253456221198
