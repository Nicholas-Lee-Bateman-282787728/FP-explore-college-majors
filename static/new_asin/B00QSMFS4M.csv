8692639,5,B00QSMFS4M,My 24yr old daughter loves this cartoon so much! I find her watching this show all the time. She says it reminds her so much of the good old 1990's and early/mid 2000's cartoons that she loves misses so much.,1434758400,,208,4.225
8692640,5,B00QSMFS4M,My son and I saw this on itunes - -but when I saw the DVD was available -- we just had to own it. My son is a big Rob Dyrdek fan -- and loves this cartoon.  Why not - he loves anything to do with skateboards!  The jokes were funny and the skateboarding animation was great.  I can't wait to watch this again with him for the 3rd time!,1430870400,,334,3.742857142857143
