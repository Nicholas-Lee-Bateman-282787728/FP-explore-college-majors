2655560,1,B000ICM5LC,"The acting is terrible and the plot is jerky and disconnected; don't waste your money or your time - the ""surprise"" at the end is not worth it.  Remember I told you.",1197158400,,165,4.15625
2655561,1,B000ICM5LC,"the pictue quality was good, the movie was not all that bad however it's not worth the price to buy it. $2.00 is all it's worth",1185062400,2,127,3.923076923076923
2655562,3,B000ICM5LC,This movie is ok for the budget.  Some things didn't make sense though.  This guy went crazy and it was her fault.  In the end she is regretful but he loses everything.  They should have had a better actor for the main lawyer although I like him in other things.  Robin's lawer has to work on his acting skills.  It's cool for something to watch though.,1182902400,,353,4.2727272727272725
2655563,5,B000ICM5LC,I purchased Restraining Order as a gift for someone. I haven't seen the movie. She was very pleased! She said that the movie was very good and recommended that I watch as soon as I get a chance. I gave you a rating of 5; because I was pleased with the prompt shipment and especially with the fact that she was really pleased with it.,1181347200,2,333,4.138461538461539
2655564,3,B000ICM5LC,I think it made a statement. Just because a woman tells you she is being abused does not mean it is true.,1179792000,,105,3.8181818181818183
2655565,1,B000ICM5LC,"The title of this review is not a reference to the actor's performances. It is an acronym for a hot @zz mess. That pretty much sums up the whole film from start to finish. I watched this with my friend and we were on the floor laughing the whole time at this blunder. The bad editing and writing, horrific acting, and awkward camera angles will have you in stitches. In one shot, it looked like they switched from film to video. Don't get me wrong I knew this film was low budget but come on they could have done better. It seemed as if they had a budget of $20.00 and half of that looked like it was spent on the food. And Robin Givens, sweety, are times really this hard? I would have given you the money to pay your master card bill for the month. To sum up, this movie was a hot lava filled mess",1175731200,6,799,4.063291139240507
2655566,5,B000ICM5LC,"I happened across this one by accident. It was laying on top of the tabloids at the checkout counter in Wal-Mart. Guess someone had doubts and decided not to get it...their loss was definitely my gain. Without a second thought, I added it to my order. No regrets. I'm happy I was able to add this one to my collection.

There's deception, mystery and suspense! Makes you ask yourself...what are you willing to sacrifice in order to get what you ""think"" you want?

A pleasant surprise. Restraining Order is a must see. I highly recommend this film.",1172016000,19,547,4.628865979381444
2655567,3,B000ICM5LC,"Overall, I felt that this movie was just okay for me.  I expected a whole lot more.  The acting and set-up was low-budget and the plot made entirely NO sense. I definitely would not recommend purchasing this movie.  Put your money to better use!",1168819200,7,245,4.5227272727272725
2655568,5,B000ICM5LC,"In Reggie Gaskins' latest film, Restraining Order, you'll get an opportunity to see the works of Robin Givens, as well as the phenomenal performance of Sean Blakemore, who continues to show the world that he has what it takes to bring such a thrilling novel alive. The storyline flowed tremendously well, and as Diane(Robin) tries to separate herself from a marriage that she no longer wants to be in, Dontae(Sean) ain't having it. Like many men who put forth every effort to ""take care of home"", Dontae is stunned by his wife's sudden non interest and he turns into a crazed individual. A divorce is not an option for him and the story has a tramatic ending, proving that honesty is definitely the best policy. The most enjoyable thing about this movie is the ability to keep the viewer speculating and wondering who the other man is. Once the individual was revealed, it was a shocker and I certainly didn't see it coming. No doubt, this is one to add to your DVD collection.",1166745600,45,977,4.620689655172414
2655569,5,B000ICM5LC,"Robin Givens stars in the suspenseful new movie ""Restraining Order."" Givens plays a distraught wife. When she turns to a male friend for emotional support, all hell breaks lose. You will find yourself involved in the story. Other cast members include Sean Blakemore (plays Given's husband), Reggie Gaskins, N' Bushe Wright, Mari Morrow and James Avery. They all do a great job in bringing the story to life.

With a riveting story line, Restraining Order shows you what happens when someone goes over the edge.

If you're looking for something different and suspenseful, I suggest picking up a copy of ""Restraining Order.""

2655574,3,B000ICM5LC,"It was an alright movie I guess...(This is my 1st review).
I don't have to see it again...
It was pretty low budget.",1383782400,,116,4.086956521739131
2655575,4,B000ICM5LC,"I was very surprised by this movie. Robin Givens played the ungrateful, selfish wife to the T. Not only did I find myself hating her character but hating her for playing it so well. The whole time I'm thinking ""What the heck is wrong with her?"" Towards the end I was on pins & needles until the ""big reveal"". Not gonna lie, it threw me off & left me a little perplex. But the movie has great range and depth, mainly emotionally, and it holds your attention. The supporting cast is good too. Her husband had me cringing. He was excellent as the unstable, loving husband.

Trust, this compelling movie is completely different than most & coupled with the good acting makes this a must see.",1378771200,,687,4.4523809523809526
2655576,3,B000ICM5LC,This is the type of movie that you view once.  It is entertaining when you final figure out what is going on.  Probably worth watching.,1378339200,,135,4.36

2655578,1,B000ICM5LC,"Plot is beyond illogical...the ungrateful ""Diane"" is not even woman enough to tell her husband she is no longer in love with him but files a restraining order against him instead. I only wish I had a husband like hers. Clearly, Diane is attractive to men with deep pockets i.e. Russ, which is all well and good but just be straight up about it!",1363478400,,344,4.390625
2655579,2,B000ICM5LC,"The director's role is vital because the director pulls all the parts together.  The direction is why it does or does not make sense, how it becomes seamless.  No matter how good the storyline, if the directing is off it can ruin the movie.  That was the case in this movie.  It's in the details and how they connect and flow and it just wasn't there.  Parts of it in terms of the actors interaction didn't make sense and those cracks in the flow made it unbelievable.  The best thing about this movie was the soundtrack.  The music was great!!  Too bad they released the movie and not the soundtrack.",1362182400,,601,4.4
2655584,1,B000ICM5LC,Horrible movie robin givens made me want to beat her up really really bad and punch her in her face. Why didn't she die?!?!? Why did the finest man in the movie have to die? I absolutely hated the plot,1361664000,,201,4.05
2655585,1,B000ICM5LC,I didn't like this movie at all it was stupid from beginning to end the plot didn't make sense in the beginning and the characters were stupid. I hated this movie I wish I could get my money back I couldn't watch it all the way through I had to stop it several times because I kept getting mad at the movie. I really hated this movie and would not recommend any one to purchase this DVD.,1345161600,,387,4.038961038961039

(SEE THE MOVIE TO SEE WHAT I MEAN).  HER HUSBAND IS VERY DRAMATIC.  I WOULD NOT WANT A MAN WHO LOVES ME THAT MUCH TO WHEN I TELL HIM ITS OVER AND IM LEAVING, HE CANT TAKE IT.

2655592,3,B000ICM5LC,"I saw this film at a festival.  I did not like the film too much.  The story line did not make sense.  I did not understand Robin's character way of thinking.

What I loved about it was Sean Blakemore.  He played his part well.  I was convinced that his pain was real.  It did not hurt that he is easy on my eyeballs.

Tyler if you listening or reading, how about featuring this chocolate hunk in one of your productions.  I will come just to gaze upon his beauty.",1211155200,,464,4.123595505617978
