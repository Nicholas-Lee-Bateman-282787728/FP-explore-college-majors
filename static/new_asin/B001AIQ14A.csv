3451087,4,B001AIQ14A,"I don't know what it is with those Australian's and their movies, but there must be something in the water in Australia !  Because just about every Australian movie that I've seen was good to excellent, and this one here is simply another good Australian thriller.  I guess the best script writers and directors along with actors do actually reside in Australia.  Anyway, this is a good suspensful thriller that is more focused around the different characters of the film.  Its not your average run of the mill type of thriller, especially because there is a certain amount of character development in it which is usually missing from other thrillers.  Watch it cause you won't be disappointed if you're a thriller fan.",1235520000,55,719,4.860655737704918
3451088,5,B001AIQ14A,"The movie Restraint manages to entertain on many levels--it's a thriller--who will kill who?  It's a pyschological play--who's got the power in each situation and who will turn it how?  It's sexy--who's going to have sex with whom?  And it's all well-executed.  The actors are believeable and gorgeous; the cinematography beautiful and even haunting; the dialogue cutting and concise.  Having said all that, it does many things well, but nothing great.  It's not scary enough to appeal to the slasher crowd; it's got too much violence to appeal to the cerebral crowd; and it doesn't have enough sex to appeal on those grounds.  It's just a good movie that explores the power struggles--both physical and psychological--of three people in very bizarre circumstances.",1232236800,75,765,5.221311475409836
3451089,5,B001AIQ14A,"Well, I rented this because I am a Moyer fan.  I was not disappointed.  For 3 actors, shooting in primarily one location, it did not bore me for a minute.  Excellent acting, beautiful people, nice twist.  Nothing complicated.  I suppose if the actors were less appealing to the eye, it might not have been as good.  :)  The only thing you must know, is to be sure and watch the alternate ending.  I think it was much better.  Just go to the special features.  :)  ENJOY!!",1228953600,6,471,4.3604651162790695
3451090,5,B001AIQ14A,"I purchased this DVD as used. It was in excellent condition. It was like brand new. I will continue to order used DVD because it is afforable. Even more so, if you plan to purchase more than two or three.
The movie was excellent. I love Stephen Moyer.",1228089600,,251,4.25
3451091,5,B001AIQ14A,"I happened to search under ""True Blood"", the HBO series for any items. This movie, ""Restraint"" came up among other items. It looked like a good thriller so I checked it out. Stephen Moyer from True Blood is in it which was why it showed up. I'm not a fan of his so that had no influence on wanting to see it.
A young Australian couple, Ron and Dale are on the run from the police. Ron has just recently killed Dale's boss. They have no money and are looking for a place to hide out. They eventually find a very big secluded house. As they're searching the house for things to steal, there's one thing they don't know. The owner is in the house.
The owner, Andrew (Stephen Moyer), sees Dale first and before anything is said, in comes Ron, with his shotgun, barking orders and tying Andrew up.
Andrew is agoraphobic and doesn't fight back as much as one would expect.
They come up with a plan, which to not ruin the movie, I'll leave out.
As the movie progresses, the interaction between the three characters is intense, suspenseful and exciting. Looks and actions could be deceiving.
All in all, I never expected the movie to be so good, with great acting and a storyline that kept me interested the whole time.
It's too bad both actors, Travis Fimmel (Ron) and Teresa Palmer (Dale) haven't been in more movies.",1224892800,177,1311,4.443983402489627
3451092,5,B001AIQ14A,"So I watch about 8 movies a month, and lately, no matter how good the premise seems these movies find a way to make you want to switch it off...I approached Restraint cautiously, and am very happy to say that this is at best a decent film and these days thats harder to find than you would think. The plot is nothing special and the idea has been done before, but the actors are very good and the film seems very honest with it's atmosphere. Definatley recommend this, if anything you won't be too disappointed I guarantee it. And this has to be the hottest cast I have seen in one movie for a long time. The cinemetography is also really good.",1216857600,7,644,4.286885245901639

Only, Andrew, an agoraphobic of at home.

This is a fairly tense movie but action is far from anything on the agenda.  Andrew works Dale into dressing, speaking and acting like his ""out of the country"" girlfriend.

3451131,5,B001AIQ14A,"This is a very good simple movie.  It's pretty much unknown though, outside of Australia this movie pretty much was straight to DVD, and by straight to I mean a couple of years later. I think it was in cinemas around 2006 or something.  Teresa Palmer and Stephen Moyer's careers have obviously taken off in the years since but fans of either will enjoy much younger versions of these stars in this one.  Most of the movie revolves around just three characters and all three of the actors including the much lesser known Travis Fimmel, do a great job .

A very basic plot, Moyer's character has some sort of psychological condition that makes him afraid to walk out the front door, unfortunately for him a thug has killed his stripper girlfriend's pimp and for some reason is stupid enough to be driving around with the corpse in the tray of his ute.  This results in the demise of a service station attendant and the two in a panic turning off the highway down a private road that leads to a mansion.  There they violently rob the occupant and plan for him to drive them in his car through whatever police roadblocks are out there to somewhere else.  Of course for a guy who can't walk out the door, this isn't really an option.  The occupant comes up with an alternative but can he really trust the thug not to kill him in the meantime or when it's over?",1420934400,2,1355,4.413654618473895

3451150,3,B001AIQ14A,"Great movie. Teresa Palmer was the stand-out character in this film. She drifted in and out of scenes and moods perfectly. The three main roles were played out with superb skill but not predictably so. Restraint was a ping-pong game of survival among three well-developed characters. Most of the abundant details in Restraint were unexpected. Viewers will always play guessing games and filmmakers can't hide everything. Even so, this is an excellent film. I'd easily give the movie 4 stars but I hate the ending. To me, it was abrupt and out of context. I've seen moody, cerebral films with less tension in which such an ending would be appropriate. Still, I'm glad I watched and the film is a good one. I do recommend it. After all, one man's peeve is another man's delight.",1407888000,5,776,4.7555555555555555

3451157,4,B001AIQ14A,I did enjoy the movie and it had an unexpected ending.  The main reason for buying this was for the fact Travis Fimmel played in this and I so enjoyed the Viking series.

3451169,3,B001AIQ14A,"Nothing to see here. Move on, please. Standard situational suspense film, with situations that stretch credibility, like the druggie, petty criminal girlfriend who magically morphs, through the course of the film, into a refined and sophisticated lady of means (well, relatively sophisticated. It is set in Australia after all!), or a missing fiance who may or may not be missing, or (sinister musical accent) dead!

Not terribly engaging, and characters that simply don't materialize as more than cardboard cutouts.

3451174,4,B001AIQ14A,"I originally put this movie in my Netflix queue because Stephen Moyer starred in it and I've recently discovered him. I was pleasantly surprised at what a good movie this was. Had never heard of the other two actors but they were very good as well, Travis Fimmel was very convincing as the mean, menacing guy who drives the story in the beginning. Moyer is also convincing as the ""good guy"" who is taken hostage by the young couple on a crime spree. I thought it was very well made, the tension keeps you on the edge of your seat, and the story very believable. So, I bought it for my DVD collection. The alternate ending was really good and gives a little more insight into the ""good guy"" and leaves you wondering if he really is the good guy. I loved it!",1378425600,2,756,4.293706293706293

3451182,2,B001AIQ14A,"There was nothing new in this Aussie version of a kidnapping/home invasion that hasn't been done many times before. The so called twist in this story was no more than a lonely guy who is without a girlfriend (I won't say why) who falls for one of the kidnappers (Stockholm syndrome) and his will to survive at any cost. Yes, the guy is a little off, but his mental health was not enough for me to rate this any higher than average. The production values that include acting, direction, editing and camera work were good, but again the story just didn't bring enough to the table to raise this above the dozens of other movies like it. It was predictable with no surprises and that includes the ending 2.5 stars Was it worth the time? Yes, but not memorable.

3451240,4,B001AIQ14A,"Good acting, top props to the 'hostage,' though. Great camera work/camera quality. Unique enough characters in a unique enough situation, especially with the hostage's phobia. Despite doing their performances well, it's WHAT they performed as the first half of the film that made it less enjoyable.

The two ""antagonists"" were WAY too unrealistically unstable/bi-polar for the majority. There's random acts of humorous bonding between everyone, then random insults/threats, then random sexual tension BS including from the promiscuous chick who somehow has bouts of dramatic seriousness, to random bouts of emotional-ness from one of them to another, etc etc.

But towards the end this finally starts to fade and take a stronger tone as the movie builds up to its finish. The finish, suffice it to say, has a decent 'twist' that makes the movie stand out a bit more on itself. But it's hard to say that it makes up for the back and forth personalities and such earlier.

In the end, after a bit of thought however, I can see there's a lot of psychological themes and detailed imagery based on the human mind that were meant to be displayed because of all these chaotic things (especially the twist added in), but it just doesn't come together as well or as cleanly as it could've and leaves a mildly disjointed product instead of a more direct/blatant, beautiful piece of psychological art it could've been with a bit more focus and a bit less whipping around.",1333152000,3,1460,4.926829268292683

3451246,1,B001AIQ14A,"I'm sure you'll agree that these puritanical diatribes masquerading as feminist propaganda campaigns disguised as horror films are getting rather tiresome.

First there was ""The Exorcist,"" with its crass popey message that puberty comes from the devil if you're a girl. And now we have ""Restraint,"" the first film funded by Sarah Palin's Abstinence Research Institute. Of course, I don't mind that this one falls prey to the same ridiculous tactics as vegans molding their veggie loaf into animal shapes, when they cast a buxom blonde with profound areolas to portray the chastity-craving protagonista.

The viewer is constantly hit about the Adam's apple, base of the spine and frontal lobe with the nerdy message that lust makes men impotent and women just want to play with their Barbie dolls in peace. But they also want lots of money to buy shoes and dinner gowns! And those cute little teeny weensy anklets!! Pass me some of those sparkly foofoos!!!

3451248,4,B001AIQ14A,"It seems to me I've seen some numbers of thrillers that revolve around a character with a psychological quirk. In this case the protagonist suffers from agoraphobia.

A young couple are on the run. He has murdered someone who is now in the trunk of his car. She hasn't yet done anything wrong but has issues of self worth so she stays with this murderer. While they are at a gas station, and in need of dough, the news hits the TV that they are wanted. He ends up killing the attendant and they need to get off the street. They end up in the house of the agoraphobe and realize he is a source of their much needed cash. The movie shifts into psychological gear and the viewer must try to figure who will win the cat and mouse.

Once you suspend your disbelief on the way too coincidental set up, this is a pretty cool movie. Steve Moyer as the shut in does a nice job. He's essentially a normal guy except for that one phobia. And when the viewer sees he might not be as innocent as he proposes he handles that with equal aplomb. Teresa Palmer as Dale is gorgeous. She's good. Maybe not great, but good enough to get the viewer through the role comfortably. I'm not too sure about bad boy Ron. Some aspects of his character were right on but something was wrong. I'm not certain if it was in the writing or his portrayal.

Most of the action is set in the house and it's a good set. It's a mansion that is a bit past its prime but has a lot of personality. That the shut-in is a used-to-be art dealer helps as well. You have some nifty artwork scattered throughout the place. This has decent production values and moves along at a fair clip so you're not at all bored. This could have used a bit better script, but so many of these types of thrillers are pretty awful, so this stands out quite a bit higher.

3451265,5,B001AIQ14A,"The unusual developments after a home invasion, is the subject of Restraint (2008), an atmospheric tale of suspense, shot in Australia, directed by David Deennen, and written by Dave Warner.  There are some minor cultural quirks, but this intriguing drama centered on the evolving relationship of the three central characters, easily translates to other cultures.

Ronald Beron (Travis Fimmel) and his stripper girlfriend Dale (Teresa Palmer) are on the run, with Dale's dead ex-employer in the trunk of their car.  When they stop for gas, an unfortunate attendant who sees the body, receives a shotgun blast.  With another homicide to their credit, the couple zips down a side road looking for a place to hide, and discovers a small house.  Inside, they find the owner, Andrew Shepard (Stephen Moyer), and intend to make him part of their escape plans, but run into a problem.  Andrew suffers from agoraphobia, an acute fear of the outdoors that prevents him from leaving his home.

To save his life, Andrew proposes a scheme where the couple can acquire forty thousand dollars.  This would involve Dale impersonating Andrew's fianc Gabrielle, in order to withdrawing cash from his bank, twenty thousand dollars at a time.  As Gabrielle is woman of some class and breeding, and Dale is somewhat unsophisticated working class type, carrying off this deception will require a slight makeover, to smooth over some of Dale's rough edges.

The interaction between these three central characters is dynamic, constantly changing, and very compelling.  Ron and Dale are passionate lovers, however Dale is not shy about teasing Andy with her naked body.  Ron intends to squeeze as much as he can from Andrew, before he kills him, and is open to using Dale as a tool to achieve this end.  Although a victim, Andrew has some deep dark secrets, and some desperate plans of his own.

The screenplay is tight, with hardly a wasted scene, and numerous little artistic touches, like slashed paintings, a pulverized pet, jazz music, and Ron's surrealistic confession.  The characters come off as being pretty consistent, and very real.  Travis Fimmel shines as Ron, the cheeky bad boy, with a mean nasty streak, who revels in being in control, and playing deadly games.  Stephen Moyer, is very convincing as the seemingly helpless Andrew, a man who seems to be a master at psychology, and whose mind is continuously planning and plotting.  Teresa Palmer (2:37) steals the show as Dale, who's uninhibited sexuality grabs your attention, as the character grows beyond her limits, before your very eyes.  Ms. Palmer appears to have a bright future.

Matters proceed, building up to a tense finish, as Andrew makes desperate attempts to save himself.  Emotions swirl and come to the surface, producing some thrills, and unleashing violent surprises.  A gritty tale of suspense that is largely free from typical Hollywood clichs, Restraint scores major points for being fresh, and mostly realistic.  While not perfect, the film is so much better by comparison, than most of the dreck that is out there.  Rife with sexual tension, this one is a winner.  The film features a solid cast in the few supporting roles, including Philip Holder as a nosy policeman.",1276819200,2,3236,5.048964218455744
3451266,4,B001AIQ14A,"I was able to watch this as an instant play on a movie rental website I subscribe to, and the only reason I picked it was because Stephen Moyer of HBO's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/True-Blood-The-Complete-First-Season-HBO-Series/dp/B001FB4W0W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">True Blood: The Complete First Season (HBO Series)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/True-Blood-The-Complete-Second-Season-HBO-Series/dp/B00280LZAE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">True Blood: The Complete Second Season (HBO Series)</a>was in it. It's a little known Australian production, but proved (despite my initial misgivings) to be quite an effective thriller.

A young couple comprising a hoodlum, Ron (Travis Fimmel) and his stripper girlfriend, Dale (Teresa Palmer) end up being on the run after Ron kills a gas station clerk. The pair find an imposing big house out in the country and decide the check it out, not realizing there's an occupant in the house. The man occupying the house is an agoraphobic (someone who fears going outside) and Andrew (Stephen Moyer) is soon taken hostage by the pair. This is where the fun/thrills begin as the three play a sort of cat-and-mouse game with some psychological and sexual tension between the couple and the hostage. Andrew appears to be sexually attracted to Dale and keeps commenting on her resemblance to his fiancee Gabrielle who has apparently jilted him. Ron, as dumb as he acts, is wise to this attraction and manipulates it to serve his own ends, but there's more to Andrew than he suspects.

The tension  in the drama is credibly played out and most of the movie is actually set within the house itself - there's an element of unpredictability in the 'relationship' that forms between the three, at times Ron is beating up on Andrew, at others Andrew fights back, and then there are times when all three are acting all civilized (sharing a meal, dancing happily to some vintage jazz album). It's hard for the viewer to determine what exactly Andrew's motives are, and if Ron and Dale will be content with what is promised to them. Dale as portrayed by the sexy Teresa Palmer (there's a scene where she bares her behind and breasts, but there's no graphic scenes of sex) is the object of desire for both men, and this sexual tension is also well played out.

Though this appears to be a low-budget production, my husband and I both felt the dialogue was well-written and the three main actors were credible in their roles. The only thing we felt was a letdown was the rather cliched ending, but on the whole, this is a nicely done psychological thriller.",1271376000,13,2683,5.4423076923076925
