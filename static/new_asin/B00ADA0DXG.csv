5409056,5,B00ADA0DXG,"The movie is a masterpiece, no need to comment on it. I just want to mention that the imported Blu-ray from Spain WORKS IN THE US, in any bluray player. It says ""Region B"" in the box but it's actually REGION-FREE. Good picture quality, until Liongate or someone releases a remaster for the US, THIS IS THE VERSION TO BUY.",1422316800,,321,4.366666666666666

8550049,4,B00ADA0DXG,"This is the best and most interesting of all the movies made of the life of Jesus. Patched with clips of the Sanhedrin, Pilate, Herod and people from the crowd it presents a depiction of the life of Christ that is acceptable to Christians and others who want to learn about Jesus. The death of Christ and the scene where Mary, the mother of Jesus, accepts his body at the foot of the cross is very moving. The sound can be chosen in Spanish or English. Directed by Franco Zeffirelli, the work on 2 Blue Ray discs lasts 6 hours and 24 minutes.",1431993600,,542,4.271844660194175
