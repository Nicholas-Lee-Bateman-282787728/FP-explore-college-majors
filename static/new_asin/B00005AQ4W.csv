8171661,4,B00005AQ4W,"This is one underrated movie; I believe that Valeria Golino was amazing and so was Dalton. I never heard of this movie, and found out about it because I am a fan of T.Dalton.",1371772800,,174,4.147058823529412
8171662,5,B00005AQ4W,The choice of actors that could have been found to play this role of smoldering passion and the best sword fight that could be depicted without real blood...is of course ONLY Timothy Dalton...where have all our real men gone on the screen??? Faded in to political correctness perhaps???? Enjoy..try to find the longer version to really SEE the story better!!!!,1356825600,,360,5.016666666666667
8171663,5,B00005AQ4W,"Once again, I am in awe of the strength of Timothy Dalton.  His portrayal of a king with an obsession for a married woman is heartbreaking.  He is at once frightening and forceful and tender and vulnerable.  Not many actors could pull that off.  I waited a long time to get the DVD and although it may have shortcomings as others have noted (cuts in the film, no subtitles), it is still going to be one of my favorites.",1263168000,3,419,4.265822784810126
8171664,5,B00005AQ4W,"As a long time fan of Timothy Dalton, this is one of those that deserve top rating.  It is a great story, and a wonderfully made movie.

Valeria Golino is good, really good.  These two actors compliment one another's performances, with their characters in considerable conflict throughout most of the movie.  I won't reiterate the story line here, as it has been done beautifully by another reviewer.

It is a complex story though as stated, and once again Timothy Dalton proves that he is a great artist who can take the role he has chosen to perform and portray to it's ultimate best.  I remain a fan!",1256428800,5,603,4.588785046728972
8171665,5,B00005AQ4W,"In 1990 THE KING'S WHORE based on the novel by Jacques Tournier was made into a film by Italian director Alex Corti. It originally ran 132 minutes when I had the chance to see it abroad in Europe. Unfortunately,reviews for this film have always run the gamut because there are at least five different versions of it that run as low as 92 minutes depending on the country that released it. Unless the film is shown in its entirety as Corti intended there will always be gaps and scenes that seem chopped and out of place. What a shame that the best release for the USA on DVD runs one full minute longer than the VHS counterpart,yet still is 20 minutes short of the film that was nominated for the Palm d'Or at Cannes.

The film that was intended by Corti in 1990 is in my opinion a 5 star film. With a DVD release for the US (sometimes even titled with the diminutive title THE KING'S MISTRESS!), this lush 17th-Century sweeping tale of unreturned love and revenge has been edited enough to take away the real emotional impact that was in this film originally. Enough of it is there to get the viewer through,but it will undoubtedly seem somewhat choppy to those who have never seen the full length version.

THE KING'S WHORE is a complex story of a kingly obsession for the love of one of his married subjects. Timothy Dalton portrays the tortured Vittorio Amadeo whose total senses have been damaged by one of his married subjects, the beautiful Jeanne de Luynes. The King gets what he always wants, and Jeanne's family,even her husband,abandon her to the King's whims out of fear. Jeanne (a young Valeria Golino) feels totally betrayed and used,so she submits the the King her body,but never her heart, as she sets out to exact revenge on all of those who had betrayed her. Jeanne figures that if she has been ""sold"" into this slavery as the King's mistress then she will play her cards to the fullest extent. The King and Jeanne go through a ""push me-pull you"" relationship that the viewer can never decide with whom to side,because there really is no winner in this impossible situation. The King would appear to have the deepest love for Jeanne, but he still beats her and reminds her that he is the ruler. On the other hand,he can be turned by Jeanne should she show even the slightest hint that she might love him. Frankly, Dalton as the King breaks your heart. Golino as Jeanne is marvelous in restraint and defiance, and yet tender when her character starts to give in. This is a story with no possibility of a happy ending. One hopes that either character will give way, but that is not the story that Tournier wrote. There is a battle raging between two rivals that makes it impossible for either to be totally blissful. This is truly a story of ""when you are handed lemons,make lemonade"" if there ever was one.

With so much edited out, the reasons for Jeanne's brother returning, the War with France and the interaction with Jeanne and her in-laws is severely damaged that I only have to remember what material was there when I first saw it.

The DVD is a beautiful widescreen remastering, but it is extremely rare. It far surpasses the US VHS fullscreen format. There is also some dubbing that was not in the original. Go figure? Since Alex Corti is dead, we may never see this film the way it was intended! Gabriel Yared's continous soundtrack of themes based out of Bach and Mozart flow seamlessly telling the two character's story.

I love this film,but the best that I can do is rate the movie with the 5 stars that I believe it deserves, but leave the decision to the viewer that what you will see may seem confusing and unfinished. That the story is gloomy...yes it is. Times were tough when you belonged to the King.

An excellent companion film would be VATEL.",1195344000,19,3783,4.53958944281525
8171666,5,B00005AQ4W,"I have owned this movie for years now...I have it on VHS and have watched it many times.  I popped it in again today and am struck by the great passions of the characters, especially of the King.  Tim Dalton does a magnificent job of creating the mood of the ""not-so-jolly"" monarch.  His jealousy of the happiness of his chamberlin, his passion for Jeanne, the woman he couldn't have, ignites the fire in this movie.  Granted, this may have been one of the Valeria's (the actress who plays Jeanne, {that is her name, isn't it???})first films, but she didn't do too bad a job.  Her character is placed in a such a position by her husband's social climbing family that she has no recourse but to submit to the Kings desire for her, but she has her revenge in the end.  As you can imagine, such passion can lead to no good end, and the heat of this monarch's personality burns all near him.  A great historical fiction movie that I highly recommend.",1192665600,7,946,4.433526011560693
