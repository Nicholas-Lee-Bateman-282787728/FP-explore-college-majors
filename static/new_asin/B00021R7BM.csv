2054329,5,B00021R7BM,"Incredible movie.  Before Christians get to thinking they are sacrificing by giving up some food for lent, or even ""saving"" themselves before marriage, they should watch this movie.  It depicts the story of true sacrifice, of true dedication to one's beliefs.  For most Christians the amount they actually suffer for their faith is almost nothing.  A must watch for anyone but especially Christians so they can realize how little they actually have to suffer.  The next time I hear that God gave someone a new house I think I will give them this movie for a housewarming gift.",1488672000,,576,4.836734693877551

2054333,5,B00021R7BM,"- in these Japanese POW camps. Yet this film remains special.  Unlike the genre's genesis, ""Bridge Over the River Kwai,"" this film pulls no punches in either the brutality of captive life or the spiritual tortures of its victims. In coming to terms with with injustice, violence - and their own souls - those men who survived came out the better for it, Japanese or Scot.  (Though assuredly this was not the Emperor's intent!)

There is a strain of rah-rah Brit patriotism, of course, as well as a touch of racism.  I can understand those who fault the film for it, but one must remember that this racial angle was part and parcel of the war itself on both sides. Not for nothing was the atomic bomb dropped on Japan and not Germany.  Doubtful that these men, whose lives were so scarred yet ""purified"" by their torment, would have applauded this act like the stay-at-home flagwavers.",1467590400,,884,4.641025641025641

If you think war is wrong, rent the film instead of purchasing it.  Pretty graphic violence, which was appropriate for the script.",1429315200,,356,4.9
2054360,5,B00021R7BM,"Few movies demonstrate the high aspirations of the soul of the human male. This movie exceeds mere demonstration. Instead, it truthfully depicts how amid human deprivation and human cruelty the souls of males, the souls of men, can aspire for and reach intangible grandeur though their bodies have wasted away. In such conditions in which the characters of this story lived, their aspiring to reach a nobler  aspiration required of them to struggle against great odds to surpass degradation of inflicted inhumanity occurring during war as prisoners of war. As the story portrays even if one (a male) is the victim, to achieve true humanity, a quality never to be lost, if he were to humble oneself as Christ then his humanity is not a casualty of war.

This movie celebrates the culture of integrity of the British military tradition. God, country, and the refinement of study highlight this story. This is a heartbreaking story. But triumphant one as well.

Kiefer Sutherland is used, seen pictured on the front of the DVD, for his star power for advertising, but his role is supportive, in no way a lead.

At first the story moves at a rather slow pace. The subject matter very heavy. Able to capture my interest enough for me to see the movie through to its end I thought unlikely. Started watching the movie in the later portion of the evening and I became sleepy and so turned the movie off to go to bed, thinking I might not even finish watching it. Well a few days later I had about a hour to kill before attending to important matters, so I turned the movie on where I left off and was hooked. Could not wait to return home to finish the movie.

This story sliced through me like a double edged sword. It pierced me to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow. It had me evaluate the thoughts and intentions of my heart. My watching the film compelled me to weep. I wept like I have not wept in some time, cleansing tears. And I am man enough not to be ashamed to admit it to you.

Ended up purchasing a copy of the film to add to my collection.",1427155200,,2072,4.453825857519789
2054361,1,B00021R7BM,"This intolerable slap in the nuts is a pitiful and sorry piece of film. The usually intense and interesting Sutherland stares blankly throughout the movie barely showing emotion or recognition. He's clearly supposed to be some kind of sacrifice to fate at the hands of an uncaring and hell bent world of extremes. What actually comes through is a hackneyed, dreadful, and boring few cliches and painfully obvious and overused plotlines no one has thought to change since Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence. (which was a brilliant and underrated product of genius)
 The predictable storyline, the worn out themes and propped up monoliths of every war film ever made make their appearance here like the sad, soaked urinal cakes in a bus station men's room. And this bowl-floater smelled equally bad.",1426896000,,791,5.084615384615384

2054371,5,B00021R7BM,"I had the rare privilege of seeing the film in a theatre with its producer, Jack Hafer. It remains one of the most inspirational films I've ever seen. In contrast to a reviewer who objected to what she saw as a watering down of the story's spiritual content, I know that Ernest Gordon, on whose story the film is based, told Jack ""You've captured the heart of it"". If you are a Christian, you'll see and hear the message of your faith here. If you are simply a person who enjoys good film-making, or a lover of historical film (especially of the WW2 genre), you will find this film inspiring and powerful, without feeling preached at. And you might even feel drawn to the message that was central to the survival of Ernest and his fellow prisoners.",1419552000,,748,4.467153284671533

2054376,4,B00021R7BM,"This is the true story of a British prisoner of war who was forced to help work on the Thai-Burma railroad in 1942. The story tries to tie all the details of the approximately 142 mile railroad into the story of one group of prisoners. The author of the book was an officer of the group who found himself near death, and with help brought himself back to health. He found a group of fellow prisoners who wanted to learn and established a Jungle University. The Japanese camp commander did not understand what he was doing, and one of his fellow officers - who was bent on revenge and escape - did all he could to undermine the education effort. The whole story is one of personal courage and has a religious overtone with the one who helped the man survive and come back from the death house was a believer in the Bible. The book attempts to cover the whole building of the railroad while in reality the prisoners were placed in separate camps to build sections with many camps working at the same time. This is a companion to the old 1957 film Bridge on the River Kwai, and well worth watching. Another companion film is The Railway Man that tells another side of trying to survive and recover from the trails of this little known portion of the war in Thailand.",1416182400,,1263,4.401709401709402

There are some very brutal torture scenes, which the faint-hearted may want to avoid, but this shows what kind of evil these prisoners had to live under and how to survive enduring their very worst.

2054397,5,B00021R7BM,"To End All Wars helped to remove a 45-year regret of Ernest Gordon that Bridge on the River Kwai had so distorted the truth of his story Through the Valley of the Kwai.  Dr. Gordon told us students right after the now-famous movie came out in 1957 that besides fabricating the blowing up of the bridge on the River Kwai, Hollywood had totally left out his telling of the crucial element that had enabled Gordon and his fellow prisoners to survive the ordeal that took the lives of 100,000+ POWs and civilians during construction of the Burma-Siam railroad: namely, their Christian faith!

Finally, after 45 years, Ernest Gordon got to see toward the end of his life, production of To End All Wars, the true telling of his story and that of the many POWs who came to Christ during that terrible time.  The story of Christian forgiveness and reconciliation to their captors is shown poignantly at the films end, as the real Ernest Gordon and Takashi Nagase meet at the site of the bridge on the River Kwai and at one of the huge memorial cemeteries.

This is the real story that deserves Academy Award recognition.",1392508800,,1112,4.629441624365482

He was a CLOWN, he was not respected by the Japanese... he was a joke to them.

Go ahead. Google it. This is ""his"" version of events, his fellows and other prisoners have a much less kind view of his co-operation with the enemy. Stockholm syndrome at it's finest.",1386460800,,606,4.5

2054401,5,B00021R7BM,"The acting in this film is exceptional. That being said the negative reviews are from those who read the book , and didn't like the fact that they condensed the book into this film. The message remains though in a very powerful way. It's about the power of redemption and the men here are influenced by the bible to sacrifice for each other, among other reasons. It is a TRUE story, and while this is a Hollywood version , it's a powerful movie that people should see. Hate doesn't win in the hearts of the men who suffered in ways we can't even imagine. The death railroad was a horror that killed thousands, The Japanese at the time , were like a horde , that killed over 30 million people from 1937-45. We say the war started in 1939 , but in reality that's not correct. But it would be easy not to see the Japanese as human. They were and they didn't give mercy to even their own people. It was all about honor and code. This film makes this important story accessible to the viewer. But I know that the book is far better and the message is even clearer there. But this will do!.  This movie is so powerful in it's message of men and faith overcoming savagery. One of them , the religious leader of the group is even crucified for his fellow men.  It just shows how the message of jesus isn't jihad, it's about forgiveness and sacrifice. But this movie makes it clear the Japanese had to be fought , as they were one of histories most brutal empires.

2054405,4,B00021R7BM,"How godawful inappropriate is THAT?  It's so obvious from all the POW memoirs as well as the films that the Japanese had NO business posing superior to these prisoners of theirs.  They probably NEVER did feel superior to their captives which fed their brutality.  What these films still do not show is that the Japanese were bored and had time on their hands and would play games with the prisoners in the same way as they toyed with Chinese families.  It's why the POWs from England, the United States and the families with children in Holland all were censored by their governments after the war.

John LOVES Yoko, you know?

This movie is very much about the Scottish not belonging there - that's really the communication I am getting from it - not really about some sweeping epic or thoughtful war message.  Robert Carlyle isn't really given the material to decloak his special brand of awesome - it's really about his looking very young and vulnerable and more and more sun damaged - in reality.  A BIG WASTE of all of our best people all over the world because some people are uncommonly greedy and hateful.

Even if only a few of the POWs were sent to Unit 731 and nanjing's Unit 164, the Westerners do know that there will be no softening of these tormenters.  Not only were they known to kill missionaries unlike the Chinese, but the beauty of the bones persist and is evident in the starved bones of the captives - a bone structure not shared with their captors, that and the HEART of the Allied soldiers always made the Japanese uncomfortable.  They will never trust in any performance of submission and inferiority no matter how expert.  The only use for Christianity is as sheep's clothing after they lose the war.  Taro Aso is a Christian.  So is the Empress of Japan.

The POWs saw their youngest and tenderest treated like this:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beastly/dp/B002ZG975Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beastly</a>.

That the pows who were in the care of armed guards and officers deserved to be tortured, humiliated and murdered because they had been soldiers.

2054430,5,B00021R7BM,"A true story! Very few stories are told so well of the life of a man, his war buddies, and the horrific conditions of a Japanese prison camp.  It makes me angry to think that the Japanese have never apologized or attoned for the brutalities they inflicted upon SO MANY!!  I am shocked to know they were never convicted of such attrocities and murders, yet the Nazis were; I don't understand it!  Both empires were equally evil with no respect for anyone outside of their own.  TRUE prejudice!  I don't wish to forgive them their extreme viciousness throughout WWII, in and around the Pacific, to all manner of men -- women and children included (in China) yet that is the underlying theme to this movie -- forgiveness. I am overcome with emotions and tears each time I view this.  I cannot get over this kind of forgiveness in the face of such injustice, evil, and wickedness.  It is horryfying to think that men become SO brutal -- that they ENJOY the suffering of others -- it astounds me that they have no conscience left; they have become mere animals, NO . . . worse than animals -- animals don't maim and kill for sport -- they kill for sustenance; food. But equally compelling is the DIVINE grace and forgiveness of God -- the forgivness that Earnest (Ernie) shows his captors -- I am overawed at his ability to endure the torture while not being angry, but loving.  I don't know that ANY MOVIE I have ever seen has even come close to capturing such a concept. BE PREPARED -- your life will be transformed by watching this movie.  Who, of us, can complain about our lot in life after viewing this movie?  And to think that Earnest Gordon became the Dean of Princeton's chapel -- how deserving he was of such an honor!! How many people in the ministry or priesthood could attest to such treatment and survival without bitterness -- ever humbled into submission. TV evangelist he was not! Too bad he never received more acclaim in his lifetime.  Come cry with me and ponder . . . . . . . every time you see it.",1284768000,,2015,4.448369565217392
2054431,5,B00021R7BM,"Movies that present lofty and transcendental truths are seldom devoid of clich and sloganeering, not so with ""To End All Wars."" The words: powerful, life-changing, and inspiring are not hyperbolic in describing this faith-based true story. ""To End"" is akin to the iconic ""The Bridge Over The River Kwai"" in subject matter, theme, and the era of its occurrence (WW II).

Soldiers from the UK are imprisoned in a Japanese Prisoner of War Camp in Thailand and are pushed to build a railroad line (Burma-Siam). The men are in the midst of dispossession and Japanese brutality as they seek to survive with self-respect and unflinching humanity. Kiefer Sutherland (should have earned an Oscar nomination) excels as an American who challenges the British mode of holding a stiff upper lip as one should just do your duty.

""To End All Wars"" tells the true story of the POW Ernest Gordon. This movie is accurate to history in its presentation of the unlawful viciousness and the atrocities of the Japanese and with bad language earns its R rating (but the story requires therein).

This is not just an anti-war flick that exposes Japan's war cruelties, but is a story which depicts the truth that redemption, forgiveness, and human dignity can be maintained and displayed even in the midst of repression, revenge, war, despair, and suffering.

Buy this DVD, you will want to watch it every year on Memorial Day or Veteran's Day; stirring, deeply touching, and faith fortifying.

2054432,5,B00021R7BM,"One of my Amazon friends initially recommended this film to me and after reading Ernest Gordon's powerful memoir ""To End all Wars"", I decided to give the film a try.  Rarely has a film surpassed my expectations as much as this one did.

  ""To End all Wars"" is a fictionalized portrayal of the true story of Scottish Captain (and later chaplin at Princeton) Ernest Gordon's coming to faith while a POW working on the infamously brutal Thai Burma Railway built for the Japanes in WWII.  The film's subject matter alone gave it the potential to be a solid personalized War film.  Afterall I liked David Lean's even more fictionalized ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" set during the construction of the same railway.  In terms of drama though, ""To End all Wars"" blows Lean's film out of the water.

  The acting is solid from about every member of the cast.  Robert Carlyle gives a very memorable performance as a Scottish officer though frankly this film is full of excellent acting on both the Allied and Japanese sides.  While not possessing a huge budget compared to many major films, the cinematography gives a surprisingly epic feeling to the film as well as captures both the natural beauty and inhuman brutality depicted.  The film's musical score is very well composed and very appropriate.  Especially at the film's conclusion, photographs and footage of the real Ernest Gordon and historical locations add a special historical quality to the picture (one interesting photograph appears to be the real Bridge on the River Kwai after being bomber by Allied aircraft [note: the River apparently had a different name at the time]).

  What really caught my attention with ""To End all Wars"" was the film's graphic intensity and moral message.  This is a film which like Saving Private Ryan tries to capture the hellish nature of war. In the midst of appaling work conditions and cruelty from their Japanese guards, charachters choose whether to forgive or hate.  The film is generally from a Christian perspective and contains a strong religious allegory in one of the characters, though I think other reviewers were correct in noting that the filmakers played down some of the book's religious message.  ""To End all Wars"" has a great deal of violence and cursing.  However, neither is exploitative and are simply necessary gritty historical realities.  At times, I came close to tears, not a common occurance for me in most films.

  Overall, ""To End all Wars"" is a very powerful and well-made film.  It is also a film which brings important topics about faith and humanity.  I strongly recommend it though I caution viewers that it is realistically brutal and intense.",1268092800,,2666,4.906040268456376
2054433,3,B00021R7BM,"I came to this with rather high expectations given the positive user reviews. (Amazon customers seem to be a very forgiving lot). Anyway....I just wasn't that impressed, probably because it seemed to be a pastiche of too many other movies. I felt as though I were watching parts of Bridge on the River Kwai, Empire of the Sun, Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence, King Rat and The Great Escape.

Many aspects of the movie were fine. The acting, cinematography, editing, etc. were all fine. For my money it failed at the script level. Things progress through the first two acts well enough, (even though you're reminded of those other movies), but in the third act the entire thing falls apart. I understood it but I didn't believe it. It all seemed way too forced. I cannot be a spoiler by divulging the events, but as much as I would like to believe people would act with as much nobility as do these POWs, the years under my belt tell me no. This was a savage and harsh reality. What these men went through should never have to be endured by anyone, anytime. To think that, as the tide turns, these same men would take the high ground severely taxes credulity.

As unbelievable as the ending is, it's also very heavy handed. The religious imagery is so overt and over the top it made me wince.

Overall this is not a bad movie by any means. It certainly doesn't hurt to watch. Just keep in mind that you'll be seeing things you might have already seen in other movies. Movies that have done a much better job handling this particular subject matter.",1267056000,,1544,4.507142857142857
2054434,4,B00021R7BM,"To End All Wars covers much of the same ground as the classic The Bridge Over The River Kwai, not only in plotting but theme as well.

A group of British soldiers (in this case Scottish) lead by a headstrong Colonel are brought to a Japanese prisoner of war camp in the middle of Thailand and put to work on the labor force to build a railroad through the jungle to India. In the face of deprivations and the cruelty of the Japanese the prisoners find ways to maintain their dignity and humanity. I half expected to see Alec Guiness or William Holden in a far off shot of the next prison camp over. Though Kiefer Sutherland does seem to playing the William Holden part, the roguish American thrown in with the bewildering British while he offers commonsense existential wisdom to the British stoicism.

While this isn't a remake of Bridge Over The River Kwai the stories are remarkably similar, but that just maybe because the stories are set in the same proximity, time and of course the Japanese building the railroad. While Bridge is a fictional account To End All Wars is based on a true story by Ernest Gordon. This movie is much more realistic in its depiction of the cruelty and war crimes of the Japanese than Bridge was. It is also more realistic in the depiction of the living conditions, I believe going by the adage that if you tell the truth about war you have created an anti-war movie. The maintaining of dignity in this movie is much more complex undertaking than in Bridge, here Ernest starts teaching the prisoners, unbeknownst to the Japanese, of course. Although the lessons taught in the ""jungle university"" and the moral of the story maybe more informed by Ernest's post war career, 26 years as Chaplin of Cambridge than what may have actually been taught at the time.

2054439,2,B00021R7BM,"If I had never read the book (which happens to be FACT, it is written by Ernest Gordon himself), I would have thought this was a fine movie, and liked it.

but the movie has so successfully watered down the christianity of the book....the movie retained about 20% of the ""religion"".

While this may work fine for many other stories (I understand many audiences resent ""religion"" on screen).....this almost killed it. Because that was the whole point.

In the movie, the brutalized men become human again after reciting Shakespeare&Plato....  For Heaven's sake, it was the Gospels that they were actually reading!!!

I suppose it now will touch English Teachers deeply....but it no longer corresponds to reality...

ALso....two nonfactual messages were slipped into the movie that made it more palatable to Politically Correct people, but was very offensive, insulting the memory of dead men.
  First:  the movie spreads the lie (originating from the grossly inaccurate film ""Bridge over the river kwai"") that the POW's gleefully helped the Jap's construction projects....projects that would help the Japs imperialist conquests of mass rape and civilian torture. (Do you know what the Japs did to the Chineses and Koreans? Its as evil top notch...ripped open pregnant women for sport, etc.)
  BUt in REALITY, Ernest GOrdon devoted a page of the book to DEBUNKING the whole lie. He clearly wrote that the men worked under watchful eyes of guards and whips, at point of bayonet, and whenever they could, SABOTAGED or shoddily built things on PURPOSE.

  Second: at the end of the film, the POW's stare at the liberating Allied soldiers as if they were some aliens from Mars. There is a hint of hostility, and a feeling that the POWs have now all become peaceniks.
  BUT in REALITY, Ernest Gordon writes, they hoisted some stunned paratroopers onto their shoulders, and shouted themselves hoarse with joy, hoisting up a Union Jack onto the flagpole....

  THere. I had to set the record straight.

I know the directors probably didn't want to be ""preachy"", but for heaven's sake, ERNEST GORDON BECAME A PREACHER. THAT IS WHAT HE WAS DOING IN THE DEATH CAMPS!!!

  Btw, a good family friend of mine was converted by Ernest Gordon after the War. And yes, my Korean Grandparents suffered under the brutal Japanese Occupation, until being liberated by the Allies.",1219363200,,2355,5.028423772609819
2054440,5,B00021R7BM,"I came across the wonderful masterpiece by happenstance of ""surfing"" lists on Amazon.  Seeing that the vast majority of the reviews were five stars and the film had Kiefer Sutherland, I decided to purchase ""To End All Wars.""  I am so glad I did.

In preparing to write this review, I read the other reviews, starting with the one star reviews, to see what had already been emphasized--both positive and negative.  I was taken aback at many of the comments made, and the ""controversies"" many viewers had with ""To End All Wars.""  Call me jaded, or anything else, but I do not see why this film has been criticized and/or labeled for being: 1) an anti-war movie; 2) a graphically violent or gory film; 3) an ""unfaithful"" rendition of the book (an aspect I cannot comment on, as I have not read the book); and 4) a movie that has--depending on the reviewer--to much or too little of a ""Christian message.""  Moreover, I have found my self challenged by the intriguing question:  Why do I watch a movie?  Entertainment?  If entertainment, what is entertainment?

What I see in ""To End All Wars"" is a brilliant presentation, on a ""limited"" budget, concerning a part of World War II that many people do not like to ""think about.""  I see a semi-autobiographical account as seen through the ""eyes"" (and memories) of one survivor.  I see a film that details the fact that the story teller, along with a few other other prisoners of war (POWs) survived an amazing feat; (nearly 50% of the Asian and 25%--16,000+--of the Allied prisoners that worked on the railroad died).  ""To End All Wars"" brilliantly captures the nature of this horrendous experience, to the degree that an ""R"" rating would allow.  What I do not see is a movie debating ""Vengeance or Forgiveness,"" ""Pain and Pleasure,"" ""Redemption, Forgiveness, Brutality,"" ""Sadism,"" or ""Christianity.""  And to find ""To End All Wars"" boring, is to find life and drama boring.

I have not read the book that the movie is based upon, so I cannot comment on how much detail Ernest Gordon goes into with regards to the treatment of the prisoners (or comment on the films ""faithfulness"" to his book).  But I have seen other testimonies and pictures, and I can safely state that the movie is ""soft core"" with regards to the treatment, conditions, interactions, and violence endured by the POWs--""To End All Wars,"" as far as I am concerned, is NOT graphically violent or gory--especially for an ""R"" rated movie.  Despite this, I feel the film gets the point across, just as it makes clear why any attempt to escape would be futile, why so many were suffering, and why the author's decision to ""teach"" was so helpful to the survivors.

In deed, I would argue that it is the fault of our own ""arrogant"" and ""prudent"" denial of reality, as found in our educational systems and other social organizations, that prevented ""To End All Wars"" to truly portray what happened.  Why does the movie not show more of what happened to the Asians working on the railroad?  Why does the film not address the gruesomeness the people sent to work on the Burma/Death Railway endured just to get to the camps?  Why does the movie not address what happened to the Japanese who were involved in these ""war crimes?""  Why does the movie not tell what happened to the other POWs?  I am guessing, one reason is that movies today cannot go over two hours; but, I suspect the greater reasons are that viewers don't really desire to know ""the bald facts,"" and because showing everything would have resulted in some form of ""Adults Only"" rating.  With that in mind, if ""To End All Wars"" had been able to truly portray what happened, then I would agree with those who call the film an ""anti-war"" movie, because it just might have had such an effect upon the viewer.

But I do not believe that the makers of ""To End All Wars"" were overtly trying to make an anti-war movie; (if they were, they failed).  Nor can I believe that someone as noble and brave as Ernest Gordon (based upon my research for this review) would be totally ""anti-war.""  I believe he would think more along the lines--as he clearly did when he enlisted--that war is sometimes a necessary evil.  And the ""message"" I got from ""To End All Wars"" was: Honor those who fought/fight--regardless of their beliefs or which ""side"" of the war they were serving.  If this is a ""Christian message,"" then it is; but, it is, more importantly, a human message understood by all who have endured many forms of violence--war in particular.

As for the language, I think that the director did an incredible job of ""covering up"" the dialog that would have been/is used on a daily basis by people caught in such an environment.  If the viewer is so easily offended, they should stick with ""fantasy"" films.  Even more germane to this film, is if Ernest Gordon did not use the vernacular of the everyday soldier, let alone that of prisoners under extreme duress, in his book, then I say the makers of ""To End All Wars"" were obliged to ignore Mr Gordon's prudence.  The fact that Ernest Gordon ""started"" a school to help keep moral up, and that one of the books available was the Bible never once lead me to the conclusion that this was a ""Christian"" movie.  Indeed, what I remember most is: 1) that the thoughts of Shakespeare and Plato were integrated with those of the Bible and the Japanese ""bushido"" ideologies; and 2) how these ideas impacted upon the men involved.  Perhaps even more impressive was the presentation of how the ""refreshed"" attitudes (from their ""schooling"") of these few men influenced the attitudes and lives of the rest of the camp--including the Japanese.

For me, the role of ""faith,"" was not that of Christian faith, but of human faith.  Again, without having read the book, I have no idea to what degree Christian faith influenced Ernest Gordon before his camp experiences, but as a sociologist I do know how individuals who have been around Christian thinking will quickly turn to the Bible--or their ""remembrance"" of the Bible--when they find themselves in situations they cannot fathom; just as individuals of other religions ""turn"" to their ""remembrances"" of whatever source of ""faith"" they have encountered.  And there in-lies one of the beauties of the ""school:""  ""faith"" was found by some POWS in the Bible, by others in Shakespeare, yet other POWs took faith from Plato and other writers, and other POWs discovered faith in music and drama.  Others turned to the darker side (brought out so well in ""King Rat"") for their faith, as aptly found in an American POW--portrayed with greatness by Kiefer Sutherland as Lt. Jim Reardon--selfish materialism; albeit, Sutherland's character undergoes a transformation that is both longer and greater--and less appreciated and understood--than many of the other POWs.

""To End All Wars"" walked a hard line, and in the final analysis, I truly believe it did a wonderful job.  All of the performances were superb.  I found myself involved with the characters, and living their lives (or at least feeling like I was).  The script, direction, and production are all stellar.  When a film, such as ""To End All Wars"" draws the viewer into the world they are portraying, I think that is what entertainment is all about.

2054443,4,B00021R7BM,"Over the years there have been a number of anti-war movies made. Each took the perspective of why it was bad and the consequences of those who would wage war. The outlook of this film differs in that it talks about the suffering of man, the ability of man to rise above his experiences and the way man can find humanity in himself.

The film is narrated by Ernest Gordon (Ciaran McMenamin), a young man who joins the army because it was the right thing to do, only to find himself a prisoner of the Japanese in Thailand. Their captors demand respect and a following of the code of Bushido, a code that the allies are unfamiliar with. It becomes a hard lesson to learn but one that takes place, notably when their leader is killed before their eyes.

Hardened by this event, the camp breaks down into two groups through a series of events. One is led by Campbell (Robert Carlyle). His group is planning escape from a prison where there is none. Buried in the jungle with no where to go, they have little hope of survival. But deep seated feelings of retribution lie in Campbell.

The other group is led by Gordon and Dusty Miller (Mark Strong). This group has begun to meet secretly in an attempt to bring civility to the camp. In offering education to the prisoners beneath the noses of the Japanese, they regain the humanity that their captors have tried to strip from them.

Between the two groups and fending for himself is Reardon (Kiefer Sutherland). The only Yank in the group, Reardon looks out for himself. Sutherland's part is more minor than usual, but he works it well. The change his character takes is a linchpin to the tale.

While the Japanese force their prisoners to work for them, building the infamous ""Railway of Death"" between Thailand and Burma, the prisoners do their best to survive. And doing so in the face of their captors is what forms the drama of this film.

The performances are solid all the way round. The look and feel of the film are well made. The film does lack one thing though. While the story is an important one to be told, based on fact, it lacks enough oomph to capture the viewer and hold on tight from beginning to end. Interesting yes, entertaining no.

War film fans may enjoy this one. For the average viewer it will be a choice made when the hot new title is gone for the night at the local video store. It's worth watching, but meant more for the select than the masses.",1205539200,,2420,4.44920993227991

2054446,5,B00021R7BM,"I first read about ""To End All Wars"" in a movie review in World magazine(a Christian faith publication), and then was astonished when it was released to only a few movie theatres in the US (mostly on the West Coast), and then only for a brief period of time. I had read the book by Ernest Gordon (on which the movie was based), and coupled with the reviews (all of which were very favorable), I bought the DVD as soon as it was released, sight unseen. To this day it remains one of my favorite movies about war- both for it's uncompromising, gritty realism (in telling the true story of the Burma ""Death Railway""), and more significantly, for the enduring and thought-provoking message that it so effectively communicates. All good movies about war, in my mind, have in common the ability to go beyond the action, beyond the suffering and violence, and to raise from all the ashes something profound about human nature, and man's inhumanity to man.
""To End All Wars"" is a first-rate movie production: on location cinematography, compelling acting performances by all the actors, a haunting musical score, and uncompromising realism in telling a story of extreme (though all too common) brutality and suffering. This is no made-for-TV affair - the production values are A+.
The few other reviewer comments on profanity in the movie, and a ""watering-down"" of the overt Christian message of Gordon's book didn't bother me at all; I rather imagine this movie was not made with a fundamental church-going audience in mind. Rather, by presenting a true story and being faithful to the times and events of those times, I think this movie gains a measure of respectability for any audience, and only makes the eventual message of forgiveness all the more powerful.
For you see, this movie is, above all else, about forgiveness....REAL forgiveness, not just a word we use to appease our guilty conscience, but the ""working end"" of the idea- that is, forgiveness that means real action....forgiving those who persecute, hate, and even kill you. The POW's of the Death Railway camp portrayed in this film survived unimaginable physical and mental hardships, in no small measure (perhaps mainly) because of discovering faith, meaning, and ultimately salvation - amidst the worst of human conditions. The last 10-15 minutes of this film, where this message is conveyed so powerfully, are among the most gripping and memorable images I've ever seen on film.
I'd highly recommend this movie to anyone who is not uncomfortable with confronting the ugliness within the human heart, in order to find it's greatest rewards.",1197244800,,2604,4.974770642201835

2054450,3,B00021R7BM,"The acting and authenticity of this film's set are excellent, but having read the book I was disappointed that the Christian message of the film wasn't more central and overt.  The book, and Ernest Gordon's life as he writes about it, are about the transforming power of a relationship with Christ, in the face of unimaginable evils and difficulties.  It was that faith that gave the prisoners hope and transformed their outlook.

The makers of the film wanted to communicate that, but they evidently tried to do it in a ""cool"" way that they felt was socially relevant, a way that would attract people who are searching.  I guess they felt that a few ""f-bombs"" (profanity) thrown in would help do the trick, along with not talking too much about the Gospel.

Don't get me wrong--I'm not advocating a legalistic stance on faith--and language like that was undoubtedly a part of the lexicon at that time.  But in this film it was gratuitous, and also makes it less likely that the wonderful story of the film can be shown as broadly as possible--to various ranges of age and different backgrounds.  In general, this film just seems to cower from talking too much about Christianity---in Gordon's book, the discussion sessions revolved around how to reconcile Christianity and a loving God with the terrible suffering that was going on all around.  But in the film, Plato's thoughts on a ""just society""  are highlighted more than Jesus and his message.  There are visual symbols and scenes that speak to it, but why not just come out with it?

The Christian message is attractive to seekers precisely because it is different and a radical break from the world.  There's no need to water it down to make it more attractive.  In this case, trying to do that merely diluted the power of Gordon's original account--it was the love of Christ and its implications that transformed the Kwai camp--that's the ""miracle"" on the River Kwai that Gordon wrote about.  I'd encourage everyone to read his book.  It's currently being marketed with the same name as the film, though it originally appeared under the title Miracle on the River Kwai.",1184716800,,2128,4.8076923076923075
2054451,5,B00021R7BM,"This is easily the best ""prisoner of war"" film I've ever seen.  Indeed, it's one of the best films produced this decade in any category.  To tag it as thought-provoking is an understatement (and when was the last time you watched a WWII POW camp flick that you would call thought-provoking?).

The film is strongly based on the true story of the Allied prisoners that were used by Japan as slave labor to build the 400 km ""death railway"" from Thailand to Burma.  The conditions were intolerable and deadly.

Some of the prisoners reponded to their lot with hatred and bitterness.  Some, and this is key to the film, sought out education and spiritual refreshment.  Plato, Shakespeare, music, the Bible, and ethics are taught and learned.  Oddly, neither Jesus nor the God of Christianity are ever specifically named, but the message regarding foregiveness, love and submission are overwhelmingly obvious to those familiar with the teachings of Jesus.  The film characters are transformed by this philosophy, including the captors to some degree.  This is not about religion, but rather how one lives one's life, especially under extreme adversity.  An additional note on the ""Jesus factor"" . . . the character Dusty, played so well by Mark Strong, parallels the nature and circumstances of the biblical Jesus so well that during one climactic scene I realized that I was leaning forward in my seat with my jaw hanging open.  Very, very powerful stuff (I won't give it away).

Do not be scared off at this point thinking that this is one of those ""religious flicks"".  It is not.  It's fairly gritty and realistic with Academy Award quality acting, directing, and all other production values.  It is about war, hardship, duty and honor, good and evil, and cruelty and forgiveness, selfishness and self-sacrifice.  There are violent scenes but I did not consider them gratuitous. And, unusual for an R-rated flick, the production team did not cook up some reason to include a woman without her shirt on.  There is no nudity in the film (although after extended captivity, much of the POW clothing had become sparse rags).

Finally, special mention to the location and set.  A very realistic look. As I mentioned above, all of the production values were top shelf.

Thoughtful, intelligent, and certainly entertaining.  A great movie.",1174867200,,2330,4.981865284974093

2054453,4,B00021R7BM,"I wanted to give the movie version of To End All Wars 5 stars but...

There's a trend lately for faith-based entertainment to use elements such as swearing to ""keep it real"".  Perhaps this is an effort to reach a broader audience.  ...or out of defiance of what is typical of faith-based entertainment.

But once you've read Ernest Gordon's firsthand account (published under a few different names) you have proof that the same moving and powerful story can be told without the language.

For others concerned like we were as to WHICH words are used - it's basically the F word said repeatedly by one character 13+ times in a row in a moment of anger and then one time shortly after by another character.  There are other words as well but never is God's name used in swearing (which is where we would've drawn the line).

Other than that, the movie is really gripping.  There are some tense scenes with violence, but there are many excellent performances by the actors.

The loss of hope through capture, torture and betrayal in the face of brutal circumstances is the crucible in which true honor and self sacrifice rise to the surface.  This prisoner of war movie, slated to release too close to 9/11, finally reached the public without fan fare and is one of the most powerful depictions of honor and true humility available today.

When some of the prisoners are inspired to teach and study and redeem the time by sharing their gifts and talents, hope finds its way into the hearts of the prisoners once again.  They now have something to live for, to look forward to at the end of the work day, and their ""awakening"" causes their captors to permit expansion (espeacially since their productivity increases).

2054461,4,B00021R7BM,"I thought this was just going to be another telling of ""Bridge on the River Kwai"". I think it is the same basic story and may be based on the same source material (though ""River Kwai"" is also from a Pierre Boulle novel). But, the basic form of the story and the origins may be the same, but midway through the movie it is clear that ""To End All Wars"" is going in a different direction. We are still set in World War II and we are still in Burma and Thailand building the railroad. There are still British Prisoners of War (Scottish this time) and one American (this time played by Keifer Sutherland) and they are being poorly treated in the prison camp and made to build this railroad on meager rations. They are brutalized for not bowing, and for doing anything out of line or that would make the Japanese ""lose face"".

But through the movie there is a string of hope, of grace. That through kindness in the face of brutality, of turning the other cheek and of sacrifice, that the prisoners can gain respect (from their captors and self respect) as well as better treatment. The railroad is almost an afterthought here.

I had never heard of this movie until a friend recommended it to me, and then another friend. I still didn't expect too much from ""To End All Wars"", but it turns out that this is a quality movie. Well made, well acted, and very moving. There is a spiritual side to ""To End All Wars"" with a bit of the Christian teaching running through it. It's not overwhelming or preachy, but it is effective and there is a very strong and overt Christ image but not quite the way it was expected and how that plays out isn't such that it bangs your head with Christ.

Well done. I like when a movie I haven't heard of and clearly did not get a major release turns out to be a good one.

Very few films I have seen portray so strong a Christian view of suffering and life. Unlike ""Christian"" films, ""To End All Wars"" does not shy away from real life, nor does it shoot itself in the foot by being ""preachy."" The violence and language alone earn it the ire of many, to be sure.
One of the central themes of ""To End All Wars"" is justice and who the truly just man is.

The film is but a simple account of what actually happened there at that camp, it doesn't try to glorify it or make it conducive to some secretly hidden Christian agenda.  Like it or not, many WWII veterans became Christians on the battlefront.  The religion has helped, is helping, and will help American soldiers deal with their stresses for ages to come.

The movie is a gripping tale of forgiveness, humility, and responsibility that will leave a permanent impression.  The story is even more gripping of a tale than ""The Great Raid,"" which is similar to it.

Keifer Sutherland and Robert Carlyle do an excellent job with their acting and really bring their characters to life.  The Japanese actors are also on top of their game as the movie is very well paced and acted throughout.  The video and sound also leave you with nothing to complain about.

WWII movie fans simply cannot pass it up and others would be cautioned, it is violent.  But within the blood and suffering, the themes of forgiveness and ultimately love are seen more clearly and last longer.

Ernest Gordon and Major Campbell show two completely different responses to suffering. Gordon finds the grace through Christ to forgive his oppressors and  extend mercy to them, even when it is not required. Campbell is eaten up with the desire for revenge; even when he finally has the chance to take it, he  finds no satisfaction. To those who are offended by the overt Christian message, I would say: This is a true story about allowing God to change your worst impulses into something beautiful.

2054469,5,B00021R7BM,"I had never heard of this film. I picked it up because it looked to be an interesting war movie. On closer inspection, I became suspicious and suspected an apology and justification for Japanese war crimes. Just moments into it, I flipped the otehr way and thought it would be an acurate (as to the horrors of the Japanese treatment of prisoners) but shallow, depicting all Japanese as monsters and all allies as saints. Neither suspicion was well founded.

The brutality and horror of the Japanese treatment of POWs is graphically protrayed here. Some survivors who have seen it have horrified me by indicating that the movie pulled some of its punches and the reality was even worse. The thought that that could be true is utterly terrifying but does not detract from this film's ability to realistically protray that brutality. The film also protrays some virtues on some Japanese. The ugly facts are present but so too are some acts of humanity.

Neither were all the allied parts played as some sort of supermen. They had their good points and their bad. On balance, they WERE the good guys. That does not stop them from having the same assortment of humanity, with all its goods and ills, that any large gathering could be expected to have.

The story of the movie is fairly simple. Prisoners from the 93rd Regiment, the Argylle and Sutherland Highlanders, are forced to labor on a military railway by their Japanese captors. With them is a single American officer. The movie depicts the story of their mistreatment and their efforts to survive the horrors. Part of their approach in maintaining a degree of civilization amidst the barbarity is to run a ""school"". The school teaches such subjects as philosophy, music, drama, ethics and even Christian doctrine. They utilize whatever knowledge is possessed by the POWs. Some are skeptical but others thrive. The school gives hope. It is also apparent that the labors of the teachers bear fruit, especially with the concept of forgiveness. In the end, it is the ideas of forgiveness and redemption in the midst of suffering and brutality which are the point of the film.

It seems that some commentators take exception to the Christian message protrayed. Too bad. The story is taken from the account of a serving officer who became a chaplain at Princeton after the war. His story is a Christian one. I have no doubt that someone of a different faith would have couched his message in different imagry but that would have been a different story, not this one.

This is a powerful film. It cannot properly be calle entertainment (I hope) but it is still worthwhile. This graphic violence and suffering is difficult to take sometimes but the message is worth the effort. It is a work of excellence.",1116201600,,2751,4.807610993657505
2054470,5,B00021R7BM,"What is courage? What is the worth of a single human life? What is justice? These are the issues explored in this moving film about the power of Christian forgiveness.

What takes more courage? To plunge a knife into your enemy, or to lay down your life for another? The answers presented here will make many uncomfortable, especially those who view Christ's words of love as ""superstition,"" like the Japanese officer in the film. But what else could inspire us to love and forgiveness, instead of hatred and vengeance? The answer they would like to avoid is: nothing. There is no other answer but the supernatural, transforming love that is on display in various forms in this film.

What of those who believe that human beings exist to serve the State? That their lives are worth ""less than a feather""? They will also despise the message of human worth here.

P.S. While watching I was reminded of the book, ""Flyboys,"" which I have reviewed, and I felt the need to reiterate one point: my disgust at the author's attempt to equate incidents of American brutality towards the Japanese with the Japanese's systematic and horrific treatment of non-Japanese, white and Asian alike. I must repeat that sentiment here. The actions of the Japanese, as detailed in that very book, were orders of magnitude more abhorrent than any Hollywood fantasy conjured up against our fighting men. To attempt to equate them is equally abhorrent, even in the name of ""fairness."" On the other hand, this film calls us not to ""eye for an eye"" vengeance but to a higher ideal, possible only through a certain ""superstition,"" and impossible without.",1114819200,,1626,4.862815884476534

The setting is a WWII prison camp, filled with Allied soldiers who pass their time studying art and philosophy, and put in to practice the teachings of Christ.

The most powerful scenes in the film are depictions of the oppressed convicting the oppressors of the evil they are perpetrating in the camp, when evil is indeed overcome by love.  This beautiful film that contrasts the life of the genuine follower of Christ with the lives of those driven by revenge, power, and nationalism will definitely leave you thinking about your own faith and the implications of belief.",1105488000,,845,4.9787234042553195

After viewing ""The Passion,"" then this, I'm prompted to wonder what is it about sadism that gets ""Christian"" film makers so turned on?  For a real movie on the POW experience in WWII Japanese war camps, stick with ""Bridge on the River Kwai,"" of which ""To End All Wars"" is but an inferior imitation.",1104451200,,620,4.904761904761905

The filming was impecable and the shots done in way that made us feel like we were there. The characters well defined, almost like a documentary but with energy of an action movie. The violence was never done just for impact but where it was right.

Why the Christian leaders did not get their churches behind this movie, as they did behind ""The Passion"" is puzzling to me. This was a real story of a God who did not stop at the cross. This was a movie that shows us that Jesus indeed lives. I just hope that every Christian sees this movie and realizes that there are no winners in wars.

To end all wars is a movie to have in anyone's special collection as a reminder that amidst tragedy and injustice some can still find the source of strength and inspiration to go beyond their human capability and soar into the halls of true heroes.

If not, it is because most of the people who go to movies in theaters do not want to be confronted with some realities that have occured in this world and continue to occur.  This was one of the most moving films I have ever seen.  Reconciliation and forgiveness are some of the most difficult things that people have to deal with in their lives.  In a few instances in my own life, I was severely hurt by other people, and refused reconciliation and forgiveness for lengthy periods.  I was wrong.  Forgiving and reconciling with another or others is the most freeing experience that a human being can have.  The prisoners of this movie suffered far greatly from the inhumanity of others than I have or ever will.  Yet they showed the greatness to which the human spirit can rise.  They had every reason to make their captors suffer as they had and to ultimately kill them.  That they didn't was just so deeply moving that I was in tears at the end of the movie.  I just sat there and reflected.  There is much brutality and violence, as there surely was in these work camps.  It just makes the ending all the more beautiful.

However, it does not focus on Ernest Gordon's theme in his book, Through the Valley of the Kwai (a five star book) which is proported to be the basis of To End all Wars. I did not see any review which pointed out this fact. Gordon's theme was what faith in Jesus Christ can mean to those in dreadful circumstances such as the Japanese prison camp. The men found hope and peace and meaning in Christ which resulted in help when facing death and for those who could, they found a deep sense of value in human life and the concern to serve others rather than being reduced to a sub-animal level of survival of the fittest. The editors of the movie injected their own antiwar agenda (a serious and thoughtful theme) but not the theme Gordon gave great emphasis to through out his book. I highly recommend reading Through the Valley of the Kwai for the emphasis it gives of what Jesus Christ will do for all who choose faith in Him and His teachings. The book gives several very excellent examples of what faith in Jesus Christ can give to those facing hopeless situations and death. The movie unfortunately omits these. Plato and Shakespear cannot touch this theme.",1093219200,,1219,4.520361990950226

Why wasn't this movie in the theatres? I remembered seeing Chariots of Fire for the first time. I felt the same awe for a powerful story-- and HOW it was told and I thanked God for film makers who challenge us to analyze our motives, our hidden agendas and our faith. I came away with the most amazing understanding of how to love and forgive my enemy--which truly has to be an act that only God can help us do. I am not against war by any means. We as a country needed to fight against the Nazi's and the Japanese and the Sadam Husseins of the world. This movie NEVER portrayed submission to the Japanese,--- it portrayed submission to a God who calls us to lay down our lives.... I came to an understanding, as I initially struggled with the message, while it dramatically played out, that once inside a prison camp and under that authority---that the teachings of Jesus of turning the other cheek, carrying what is asked another mile, praying for those that despitefully use us--- loving--yes even loving our enemies, is truly the most courageous, powerful way to break the enemy. In one scene, the tears on the face of the brutal, Japanese commander--- during his most heinous, torture and murder--- spoke volumes as to the effect, this level of courage, can have on a man's heart and soul. Love won and hatred lost. And the most exciting revelation came, as my tears were flowing at the end of the movie,-- seeing 2 of the actual men who lived this journey. If man would react, purposefully, as these men chose --we wouldn't have to wait for the ""Return of the King"" to END ALL WARS.",1091664000,,1736,4.462264150943396

But like all things, good can come out of the bad. Redemption and forgiveness can result from the suffering and destruction. And To End All Wars demonstrates this powerfully. The story has great character development, which is performed by some of the best actors around (all of whom are way underrated, in my opinion). In the POW camp and forced to build the railroad, in hopelessness and despair, the soldiers find redemption and hope and learn to forgive.

That this film is based on a true story makes it all the more powerful. I know the screenwriter not only worked with Ernest Gordon but he also did a lot of research to write this story. And most of what happens on screen indeed happened in real life.

This film is on par with Saving Private Ryan and Shindler's List in its emotional impact. I'm not sure if I could see it again because it is so intense. But I certainly recommend it to everyone as a not-to-be-missed film. Through it we see the reality of war as well as our need for forgiveness and redemption.",1090540800,,1168,4.453271028037383
2054481,5,B00021R7BM,This was an amazing movie about life truths. It is very real and down to earth and I think truly depicts what would have happened in a POW camp. You can really take alot away from this movie about Justice and life.,1090454400,,214,4.119047619047619
2054482,1,B00021R7BM,"This is supposed to be a true story. It seems to me that the film takes certain aspects of truth, while maybe leaving out others, and  over does it to get a certain point of view across. The point of this film is forgiveness. Christianity teaches us to forgive. Throughout the film, the POW's are tortured, shot, malnourished, enslaved, beaten, etc. They are asked to build a railroad so Japan can conquer India, it will provide supplies, they all know this. When their leader is shot in the head for questioning the Japanese for violating the Geneva convention, the next in command, Campbell, decides to take vengeance. Now begins the whole vengeance bad, forgiveness good theme which is driven into the ground.

While the next in command plots his escape plan, everyone else decides its a great time to start school, so the jungle university is formed, teaching is led by our main character Ernest. Ernest teaches philosophy dealing with justice, etc.

Ernest sways everyone away from the Campbell, so instead of focusing on escape, everyone decides to work hard to build the railroad, even finishing it ahead of schedule, and focuses on studying at the university.

When Campbell hatches his escape plan, only about 5 other POW's help him, the rest are too concerned with graduating from the university and forgiving the Japanese to try and escape. Of course the plan fails, campbell and his crew are captured. Before campbell is executed, the chaplan of the POW group gives himself up instead and is literally crucified. Campbell remarks that his death happened for a reason. Mmmmkay.

If the characters in this film, Ernest and company, were representative of the soldiers who fought in WW2, like my grandfather who was in stalag 17, we would all be speaking german and japanese right now and talking about how we forgive the Japanese for the sneak attack on pearl harbor, the oppression of our people, the murdering, enslavement, torture, etc. and how we are simply content to be their slaves.

Fact is, this forgiveness is irrelevant, logic is. The POW's helped finish the railroad ahead of schedule, thereby helping the Japanese invade India (the war ended and they never did, but that's beside the point since the POW's could not have known that) they never attempted to escape or hinder the Japanese war effort at all. In effect, they were willing to let the Japanese do to others what had been done to them. One can forgive the Japanese for their actions and understand that their minds were corrupted by the warping of the samurai code and the emperors desire for natural resources and expansion, but I cannot understand how these soldiers could do NOTHING to try and stop the Japanese. They could have easily taken over the camp, there were only a few guards, and prevented the building of the railroad. In the end, they even help out the wounded Japanese soldiers claiming they are just human beings. While there's nothing wrong with this, since the war was basically over, the fact that its in the film to show how the American POW's sense of forgiveness is superior to the Japanese Bushido, is pure rubbish.

I was shocked that this could be a true story and that these events really happened. This movie does not preach forgiveness, it preaches submission.

The film's message is hammered so hard, its almost like watching a war propaganda film.

In one scene Ernest holds the bible up to the Japanese commander and says how it teaches forgiveness, and that if everyone reads it, they will work harder on the railroad. There are a lot of things the bible teaches, forgiveness being on of them, but it never teaches submission like this film does. This film warps the  values of christianity.

The acting is great though, but the overall theme of the movie is ridiculous and pure anti war drivel.

All quiet on the western front is a great global anti war movie, this movie teaches us to forgive and let ourselves be oppressed and to submit to those who oppress us rather than fight back. It doesn't merely say that war is bad. Bridge over the river kwai is a great movie about how the ego of the POW's clouded their sense of loyalty. They wanted to build this bridge so bad, that they forgot why they were building it. The POW's in this film could care less about the RR once it is done, they simply want to please the Japanese to show their forgiveness.

What an awful waste of film. I do not know how I would act if I were in that situation, but this film says that the men acted correctly, I disagree. The film should stick to purely showing the facts and not trying to get a message across, once it does this, it ceases being an accurate account of a true story.

Yes, I will agree that the technical aspects (directing, acting, and the accuracy of the set and makeup/costume) of the movie weren't exactly impressive.

In this endeavor, I would say that they succeeded admirably.  While I don't agree with all of the ideas put forward in the movie, it has made me think about many philosphical ideas in relation to morality, humanity, and how these relate to the reality of life.
Don't see this movie if all you want is to be entertained by a fun story with great acting and special effects.  It is, however, a must see for anyone who is interested in a movie that will cause some serious personal philosphical contemplation.

Thanks to producer Jack Hafer and director David Cunningham for NOT holding back on the cruel, inhuman conditions in a Japanese POW camp. Yet it was not a bloodbath like a silly Torentino flic. Add to that, the casting of Kieffer Sutherland, the monstrously gifted Robert Carlyle, and three of Kirasowa's most ferociously talented Japanese actors. I watched this film first  alone (the day it was released on DVD) and wept throughout, then viewed it in a theatre with 200 other theatre artists at a conference (two nights later) and at the end of the film they all rose to their feet and applauded for a lenghty standing ovation. As the story unfolds there is one dramatic moment after another. Though it is rated ""R"" (for POW camp violence and language) it is less bloody than ""The Passion..."". Just when you think you've ""got it"" (the film's message or forgiveness, redemption, courage) there's another piercingly moving moment from the lives of these remarkably courageous soldiers (British, Australian, American.)

Yes, in many ways, the Japanese acted like ""crazy"" men (so did some POWs), but they were also men - they were human beings - driven to this madness by an ideological world view. The lesson taught in this movie cannot be ignored: the choice to forgive is not a choice of weakness (revenge is a choice of weakness and it does nothing but imprison and destroy a person's spirit); forgiveness is a choice of strength based upon a Biblical ideology (the Cross of Christ) - the truth, power, and grace contained therein generates true liberation.",1087776000,,1086,4.751322751322752

The pity, here, is that this exceptionally moving film never made it to the theaters, probably because it was made and ready to release as we plunged into the war in Iraq - and if ever there could be a time when stories such as this should be related to the public, that time is emphatically now.
About another war (WW II), this story is taken from the book by the man who experienced it - Ernest Gordon: the subject deals with truth and as directed by David L. Cunningham it becomes biographically factual as well as timeless in message.  A Scottish regiment has been captured by the Japanese and along with other Allied Forces, this band of brothers is kept in a prisoner of war camp in Thailand for the purpose of building a railway from Thailand to Burma.  They are led by a sturdy Scotsman (James Cosmo)who early in the story meets his death for his conviction that his men should resist the enemy.  His leadership role is taken over by the major (Robert Carlyle) who maintains a sense of military duty despite the torrid conditions under which he and his boys live.  Ernest Gordon (Ciaran McMenamin) and Dusty (Mark Strong) care for the mental stability of the prisoners by teaching the men the Bible, Plato, and Shakespeare.  The leaders of the Japanese (Sakae Kimura and Masayuki Yui) speak to the prisoners through the Oxford-educated translator Takashi Nagare (Yugo Saso) who we feel early on has more compassion for the prisoners' plight than would be appropriate for an enemy. There is a Yankee (Kiefer Sutherland) who quietly runs a black market, is caught and is severely tortured as his fellow prisoners look on.  The railway is ultimately completed by the prisoners and as they begin their celebration (and graduation form Gordon's humanistic studies) the Allied Forces planes fly over and the beginning of the end is at hand.  How these prisoners and their captors culminate this experience speaks very heavily about the sanctity of the human spirit and soul and though the ending is not expected, it is deeply moving.
The message here is magnificent: War is absurd and cruel and insane and  will always be that as long as wars recur.  But when bereft of all the comforts of life, when faced with inevitable doom, the human heart is capable of forgiveness and communion. This film holds human dignity aloft and makes us all more sensitive to the fragile thread that binds us all.  This is a beautifully directed, written, acted, and photographed film that hopefully will this time move from the DVD to the world theaters for mass consumption!",1087430400,,2713,4.738853503184713
2054497,5,B00021R7BM,"This is a deeply moving, thoughtful film.
Gene Veith, writing in World Magazine, said it is ""one of the powerful cinematic expositions of the Christian faith.... Whereas Chariots of Fire, for all of its virtues, never got around to mentioning the gospel, To End All Wars amounts to a sustained meditation on the core of Christianity.""
Eric Metaxas, writing in Books & Culture, says: To End All Wars is a powerful film that tells the absolutely harrowing tale of a group of Allied POWs conscripted by the Japanese to build the Burma-Siam railway during World War II. Based on a true story told by Ernest Gordon in his book, In the Valley of the Kwai, this movie is bloody, violent, and profound, portraying a raw, full-throated Christianity of the sort that hasn't been much in evidence since, say, Dostoesvsky. It is emphatically not the cinematic equivalent of a Thomas Kinkade painting.""
Highly recommended!",1087430400,,909,4.947712418300654
2054498,5,B00021R7BM,"This movie begins meekly enough. Its beginning reminds one of the first scenes of Bridge on the River Kwai, but then it begins to change. It moves quickly to a study on human suffering to one of kindness and forgiveness. Men who are cold warriors learn the ultimate lesson and learn to forgive, just as all men are forgiven. I was pleasantly surprised by the emotions exacted by this great film. Some would say it is an anti-war movie, but in my opinion it becomes so much better than that. It never comes across against war, but against the hatred caused by war. It is sad that this movie will be missed by so many, due to the limited release.",1087171200,,644,4.375

It was wonderful to hear the reason it was produced and sad that major movie studios wouldn't touch it.  What fools!  This movie changed my life.  It shares the message to ""love one another.""  I would recommend it for your DVD library as a movie to share with as many loved ones as you can! God touched this movie.",1086998400,,388,4.1891891891891895

Its power, its humanity in the face of inhumanity is compelling and inspiring. A must-see!",1086998400,,297,4.228070175438597
2054501,5,B00021R7BM,"I saw this film last year at a private showing in Seattle. I expected the usual war movie and got so much more. The story started out as a typical war story but quickly turned into a movie about human beings and their inner struggles with evil. The lessons brought out in this movie about love, mercy, and forgiveness were totally unexpected and quite moving in the context of a WW II prison camp. It is truly a shame that this movie was never released into theaters here since the message conveyed so powerfully in the movue is one that the world needs to here. It was truly of Academy Award caliber. Maybe if enough people speak out the movie will be released into theaters and the movie will get the praise it deserves. Buy it and share it with others.",1086739200,,755,4.361702127659575
2054502,5,B00021R7BM,"""To end all wars"" is one of the greatest War movies ever made, in fact it's one of the greatest movies ever made, especially in the last few years.
It stars Robert Carlyle, Keifer Sutherland and Ciaran McMenamin  as the main character Ernest Gordon. This is the true story of what happened on with the bridge on the river kwai, it pulls no punches, is very realistic and disturbing but carry's with it an incredible message that really could end all wars. The reason it was not realised in theatres worldwide is because you don't live in a democracy and neither do I. The government and media tell us how to think and they black-listed this anti-war movie before it had a chance. The message of this film is one of forgiving and loving your enemy and  it's heartbreaking when seeing it being acted act rather than just talking about it.
Considering that Sutherland had just become a big star again with ""24,"", I was amazed to see this one shelved and released straight to DVD. It should have been released and would have been up for countless oscars.
If you don't believe me, get this and watch it, it's a great movie with wonderful acting and a superb script which is written by a committed christian. Rated R for foul language and violence but in context it's necessary and not gratuitous.

Do yourself a favor & watch this excellent film.  For the weak of heart, it has some moments that will make you squirm.  PLEASE . . . watch the film anyway.  You will understand why you should watch it, when you see how this film teaches the power of forgiveness.
To give it only five stars is such an understatement.",1082246400,,546,4.161904761904762
