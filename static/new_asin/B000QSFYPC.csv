8197230,3,B000QSFYPC,"My 3yr old loved Dot and the Whale although she did not get the message of saving the planet but she could tell me everything that happened.  This movie was very informative but she could not sit still; therefore, I don't think this movie grabbed her attention like before.  Will save it for next year to see what 4yr old brings us.",1293580800,,332,4.338709677419355
