7923499,3,B00004U29D,"I hope to clarify any confusion - there are many versions of ""Kimba"" available. The original (English) version of the ""Kimba the White Lion"" TV show which premiered in the US in 1966 on NBC featured Billie Lou Watt as the voice of Kimba, a nice theme song sung by a male (with female chorus) which starts: ""Kimba (8x), Who's the King of deepest darkest Africa . . ."" and music by Isao Tomita. There have been several versions released in the past years, with REVISED soundtracks, a totally different theme song, & perhaps even ""re-cut"". In 1993 a Canadian release by UAV Enterprises had Yvonne Murray do the voice of Kimba, and music by Paul J. Zaza. In 1994 another version appeared with Kathleen Barr, Paul Dobson, & Brad Swaile. I have nothing against these talents & companies, but if you want the ORIGINAL as it aired in 1966, look for Billie Lou Watt & Isao Tomita in the credits. So far I have only seen (& purchased) these versions on VHS & DVD's available from ""The Right Stuff International"" (RTS) - Amazon has them (thank you Amazon!).",1187568000,,1046,4.5396825396825395
7923500,5,B00004U29D,"In these days of re-editing classic TV shows to suit some mysterious agenda, it's refreshing to find that this wonderful show from the 1960s has been preserved in its original form. Four episodes are on this tape, taken directly from the same film prints that were shown on TV stations all over the US.
The shows are classic Kimba, focusing on strength of character and love for all creatures. It's fun to watch kids watching this show--they pick up on the heart and soul behind the stories. Kimba becomes a TV show that means something in their lives.
With no current announcement of a DVD release for these particular episodes, this VHS tape may be the one and only chance to grab this TV classic.",1067472000,,699,4.6
