8494910,5,B0068ORPB4,"This is perhaps my favorite live album from Fernanda Brum! Featuring special guests Kleber Lucas, Jairo Bonfim, Pregador Luo, and Afrolata, this DVD contains some great songs praising our great and magnificent Lord. Though there are a few songs that could have been left off (the ones which Fernanda's husband sings during her costume changes), the concert is highlighted with grand performances of songs from her album of the same name. Very enjoyable, and as Fernanda is my favorite Brazilian gospel singer, I loved it. Gloria a Deus!",1334016000,,536,5.1022727272727275
