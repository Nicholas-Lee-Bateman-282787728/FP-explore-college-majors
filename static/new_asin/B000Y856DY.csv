8231189,4,B000Y856DY,I bought this bundle before the series collections were even available. It was purchased overseas and was a unique border that isn't even in circulation. The dvds were purplish in color and came in a sleeve.  one doesnt play too welland pixelates but that was a bit expected for the cheap price.  Just think of that when purchasing these types of products.,1353801600,,356,4.725806451612903
8231190,1,B000Y856DY,This product claimed to be new but other than the shrink wrap did not seem to be. There was mold growing on the inside of the packaging and though the dvds do not appear scratched they sometimes skip.,1220313600,,200,4.2894736842105265

8231192,1,B000Y856DY,"Don't buy from this seller.  Product came directly from China and doesn't work.  Seller will not respond to my requests for refund and I'm stuck with an expensive dvd bundle that doesn't work.

Be warned!",1218844800,,204,4.771428571428571
8231193,3,B000Y856DY,"Scrubs is the best sitcom ever! And the only way to really enjoy it is on DVD without commericals or station pop-ups. That said, buy the single season DVDs only. On these cheap copies the bonus features do not work on all the disks, and the resolution on some disks looks second generation. Then again, if a few bucks is more important to you than quality... enjoy.",1215648000,2,365,4.462686567164179
8231194,5,B000Y856DY,"...Scrubs is a fantastic show. I am not a big ""reality TV"" fan and usually they are all the same to me with a different name. While of course this can't be completely realistic to a hospital situation, the show is more focused on the relationships formed between the characters and how it progresses as they age, grow, and mature. The show is very diverse and so are the characters--one episode is funny and the next might be tragic, but it's not close to soap opera tragic. The lives are fairly realistic--the characters deal with things like the death of a family member, being afraid of their vulnerability, and light-hearted events that bring the characters closer.

""Scrubs"" is a fantastic show that many people can relate to, whether they're in the medical field or not.",1208822400,2,776,4.7481481481481485
8231195,1,B000Y856DY,"I have NOT bought this product, but I just added seasons 1-6 individually to my shopping cart, and it came to $190.44, so I'm not sure why someone would pay $243.10 for the bundle, unless there is something extra being offered here that I'm not seeing.",1197936000,15,252,4.5
