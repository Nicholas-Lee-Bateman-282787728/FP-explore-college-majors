7987180,5,B00008V6XK,I felt that the DVD gave a representation of John Paul's life as a priest and servant. It showed his background in a true light.,1395878400,,128,4.16
7987181,4,B00008V6XK,"This is a remarkable remembrance of an extraordinary life!  I thought there should have been more about the video clips - who, where, when, etc.  Detailed identifications were skimpy.  Perhaps all that is in the 5-DVD collection from the Vatican, but this DVD certainly sparks interest in learning more from whatever sources.  A wonderful addition to the library of anyone who loved this man - no matter your nationality or religion!",1162512000,3,433,5.056338028169014
