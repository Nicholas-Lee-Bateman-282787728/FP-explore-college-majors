7753847,5,B01G3MC2X6,Some great songs -- remember Target used the theme son some years ago. This movie still makes me uncomfortable and uneasy like it did almost 50 years ago.  Eerie premise and seems possible with our youth oriented culture,1487808000,,220,4.7894736842105265

7753849,1,B01G3MC2X6,"A dated and laughable film about a so-called hippy / revolutionary / performer who is campaigning for the voting age to be reduced to 14, etc., etc. Problem is, he looks and behaves more like a preppy frat boy. And his lyrics are mind-numbingly banal. Give this one a miss.",1484784000,,273,4.48
7753850,5,B01G3MC2X6,"I have loved this movie since I was around 12 years old!  So, I finally bought it.  Unfortunately I haven't been able to watch this specific dvd.  I loaned it to a friend, who let his daughter (~100 miles away) borrow it, and she still has it.  But the movie is awesome unless the subject matter is against your moral compass.  It is consider a 1960s counterculture movie which promotes drug use.  Some people consider it a comedy, as ""Reefer Madness"" usually is today.  It has some good music such as ""Shape of Things"". Love that song also!  If you grew up in the 60s & 70s, buy it!  Peace Out!",1483747200,2,595,4.288288288288288

7753852,5,B01G3MC2X6,"One of my favorite movies when I was a teenager. The book was a blast, and the movie got it all right. Sure, it's over the top, but considering the last election, eerily prescient.",1480723200,2,180,4.323529411764706
7753853,4,B01G3MC2X6,"A romantic version of the sixties.  Not the way I remember those years. Loved the film; just didn't feel it was an outstanding film.  Of course when it was made, Hollywood had powerful censors. When I saw it, shortly after its premiere, I thought it quit sensational for a film  but tame compared with theatre and books at the time.",1478217600,,332,4.5
7753854,5,B01G3MC2X6,"I was 9 or 10 and my sitter Diana Short and I went to the Jose Theatre to see this movie when it opened and at the end I knew and could feel within me the dividing line of the old and new world battling all round me! I still feel it and effects me every day. Black and White/Psychodelic Color. It will blow your mind! Thank You Diana, I miss you.",1475884800,3,346,3.8194444444444446
8762247,1,B01G3MC2X6,"i love acid and revolution and the 60s, but this movie just sucked. The writing was bad, the songs were bad, conceptually it was weak. Even as a satire, it was pointless. This movie would be good to have as background in a club or party, where you get the visuals of the time period, without having to pay attention too closely.",1532044800,,328,4.306451612903226

8762249,4,B01G3MC2X6,"Pretty cool version of 'What if Hippy ideals took over outdated politics?'. Plus the consequences of extremism; Karma may bite you in the @ss. Big name stars (back then) elevate this above similar B-movies of the time; plus there is some good music, and an early movie appearance by Richard Pryor. Some lame episodes, but still balanced out by better moments. It would be nice if people cared about honest politics today too. Please vote, every election, well-informed; forget propaganda & B.S.",1517788800,,494,5.036585365853658
8762250,5,B01G3MC2X6,Placing everyone over 30 on LSD and in encampments at the demand of and rock star president!  That sounds about right!  And the music is great!!!,1510790400,,145,4.538461538461538
8762251,2,B01G3MC2X6,"I saw this when it came out, but not in a state that I would remember much.  It was in a college auditorium, but I was much younger than the audience.  Sure, I thought it was great to think that at 14 I could vote, that adults were squares, etc.  But seeing it now, I realize that even satire can be over the top:  this is so outlandishly ridiculous that I barely enjoyed any of it and it certainly isn't an interesting reflection of the 1960s.  It's like, put everyone on acid and throw out everything.  OK, it's a cult classic, get it if that is your bag, but really, it's pretty dumb.",1499904000,,587,4.150442477876106
8762252,5,B01G3MC2X6,One of the all time greats. They just don't get any nuttier........a plus to see a very young RICHARD PRYOR in what i think is first movie role.,1499817600,,144,4.178571428571429
8762253,4,B01G3MC2X6,"This was an enjoyable flick made in the late 60's. I discovered this movie while reading the book 'The Dream Life' by J. Hoberman. A counter-culture classic by AIP, anyone who remembers that time should like it. Take it with a grain of salt, but the underlying theme is that the youth have power in numbers.
