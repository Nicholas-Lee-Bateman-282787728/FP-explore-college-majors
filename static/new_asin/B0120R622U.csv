8725204,3,B0120R622U,The exercises are great but the instructions I find hard to follow as the instructor does not allow me enough silent time to find my breathing pattern. So the learning takes much longer and for me lots of confusion as to where my chin or toe tips should be; though it eventually worked (I think). I have also been told by my Feldenkrais therapist and many others that I should be able to find similar instruction videos on YouTube though I haven't found any. Surveying a few may be a good idea.,1482969600,2,494,4.380434782608695
8725205,5,B0120R622U,"Since I have tension in the neck and shoulder area I thought I'd try these Feldenkrais methods.  Surprisingly the DVD was helpful for so many more areas of the body, including the back, jaw,  and clavicle areas and was just so helpful for body scan awareness of knowing where tension lies, and how to relax those areas. Since everything is related to each other, Feldenkrais methods help for overall well being and treatment of discomfort, and this DVD is a great  introduction to the methods.  It's amazing how such gentle movements could make such a difference!",1461715200,3,563,4.833333333333333
8725206,5,B0120R622U,"I've had much pain in my left should for many years. This video is informative and easy to learn. I learned more about how breathing and listening to my body is connected to how I can ease my shoulder pain. I was truly amazed how much better I felt after following along with the lessons in this video. I don't even notice my shoulder hurting anymore! Shara Ogin's techniques are amazing. I have benefited from watching Shara's video, and recommend it to anyone who needs pain alleviated.",1458172800,3,488,4.620689655172414
8725207,5,B0120R622U,Right away I had a clearer sense of where the tension in my back was and I felt it released the tension as I was performing the lesson.  I immediately felt the connection between my body and my brain.  Just as I experience in my yoga practice.,1457654400,2,243,4.148936170212766
8725208,5,B0120R622U,"The breathing exercise really ground me.  Each of the exercises had the intended healing impact, sometimes the healing was profound and other times subtle, yet effective.",1451174400,,170,5.538461538461538
