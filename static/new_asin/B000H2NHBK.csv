8136041,2,B000H2NHBK,"This video is great -- I saw it on a premium channel and that's why I bought it.  I gave it two stars just to draw the attention of fellow Amazon purchasers because the description does not draw sufficient attention to the fact that this particular version is intended for a High Definition DVD player.  If you don't have a High Def player, then it likely won't play on your machine. (You can probably play it on your PC; it will auto-download certain Active X software.) Unfortunately, I found all of this out after giving the DVD as a Christmas gift.  And of course, because the item had been opened, Amazon's return policy precludes a full refund.  Also unfortunate.  Live & learn.  (It's a good video, and I'll be buying a non-High Def version for my brother, to replace this one.) Happy shopping to all.  :-)",1198713600,,813,4.527397260273973
8136042,5,B000H2NHBK,"Until I saw this DVD,  I thought jazz was supposed ""to swing"" in the traditional sense.  However, watching and listening to Herbie's Possibilities took me to a new level of musical understanding.  It demonstrates how the music evolves  among those artists-from generation to generation-who refuse to ""rest on their laurels, and play it safe!""  The musicians in this film ""swing"" in their own contemporary way, and have an emotional impact on the listener.  Isn't that what all great art is suppose to do?

This DVD deals with process. At the beginning, Herbie explains, ""I'm looking for people from various genres...I feel who might be interested in exploring the territory that could possibly develop from a collaboration with me...and maybe something totally different might happen.""  He points out ""...the hip stuff is outside the comfort zone.""

Nothing is pre-planned.  It's all ""in the moment,"" as the music emerges from the collaborative effort of those involved.  The artists prove when you work with great musicians, no matter what your status, the experience tends to ""bump your performance up a few notches.""

A prime example of this is Sting, a Rock star.  On this DVD they do a new arrangement of his ""Sister Moon."" The final product ""blows the mind!"" It's the phrasing.  He gets into some syncopated jazz phrasing I didn't know he was capble of.  Again proof that the environment and its participants shape the outcome.

Lisa Hannigan dispels the myth that you ""need to live long enough to have the experiences that allow you to do justice to Billie Holiday's `Don't Explain."" `Tho she looks like a teenager, Lisa has the gift of intimacy.  She pulls it off.

I learn something new each time I listen.  If you're a musician, it will inspire you to ""reach for the stars!""",1188950400,2,1784,4.906354515050167
