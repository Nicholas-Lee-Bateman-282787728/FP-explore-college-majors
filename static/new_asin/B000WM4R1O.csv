2984034,5,B000WM4R1O,"A great story reflecting the truth about Enron. One of the biggest scandals ever to happen, viewed from the point of an employee who fell into the culture of that company and almost lost his fiance in the process.",1322179200,,213,4.487179487179487
2984035,3,B000WM4R1O,"The movie is about Brian Cruver who hired on to Enron in 2001. His life at Enron runs parallel to the company as he over extends his credit based on future earnings. About the best thing you can say about the movie is it shows us how the microcosm reflects the macrocosm, or vice-versa. This is a dummy down version of what happened.

It is not political, nor does it do justice to havoc Enron did to the world, but rather focused on a small group of people in one department and how it affected their lives, including buying more Enron stock as it was tanking because they were all drinking Enron Kool-aid. Don't expect a hard hitting docudrama.

This is a rather lame, made for TV type movie, which also focuses on how Enron ruined ""the relationship."" Mike Farrell (Alan Alda light) gives us a stinker of a performance as Ken Lay, clearly miscast for the role.",1289174400,4,862,4.449367088607595
2984036,4,B000WM4R1O,This was a good behind-the-scenes look at the downfall of Enron.  Christian Kane as always provides a great performance.,1280966400,,120,5.315789473684211
2984037,1,B000WM4R1O,"Since I began working at the company later known as ENRON before Ken Lay was working there and I was in the next room in 1985 when he got his job, then I feel well qualified to say that the ONLY part of this movie that is accurate is the term...SHREDDED and that is what you should do with this movie. Shred it. It does in NO WAY come close to tell the story of Enron.  It is regretable that some of the good actors hired to portray this movie and now associated with this shameful attempt to tell the story of the greatest corporate crime in the history of mankind. The total loss due to the criminal actions of the executives of ENRON surpassed SIXTY-EIGHT BILLION dollar costing 24,000 people their jobs AND their life savings.",1273968000,5,730,4.328467153284672
2984038,4,B000WM4R1O,"I enjoyed this movie, in a serious sort of way. It was certainly insightful. It would have been good if it had shown the actions of the whistle-blower and the consequences faced by this person. I suppose the ending was somewhat predictable but it was a good movie, nevertheless.",1261440000,,278,4.6938775510204085
2984039,4,B000WM4R1O,"Honestly, I think the more negative reviews are because the subject of the story is so painful to watch. Then again I watched this because I LOOVE Christian Kane. I almost didn't though because it was such a depressing and sad memory but acting-wise, it was really a pretty good movie.

And of course, Christian was excellent. He played a young college-grad who got caught up in the big leagues and big money and ignored the warning signs of pending doom; he was progressively horrible to his fiancee and finally see the big e falling. You had to get through the beginning of the movie but I actually liked it in the end. Worth watching. Well done, CK.",1237248000,8,652,4.52542372881356
2984040,3,B000WM4R1O,"For a movie about naked, corrupt greed that by rights should make you angry, ""The Crooked E"" is still fun because it won't let you forget it's a formulaic, cheesy TV movie. It's billed as starring Brian Dennehy, but he's really a peripheral character who shows up less than half a dozen times as a mentor of sorts for the main character, a fresh-faced, newly hired Enron underling. Dennehy elevates the movie every time he shows up, though. Because the movie revolves around the underling's ups and downs, Mike Farrell as Ken Lay is also mostly wasted in a largely two-dimensional role, giving pep talks to the troops about the stock even as he was dumping it.

If you go in understanding that this movie isn't about Brian Dennehy's or Mike Farrell's characters, and is rather cliched in its moralizing, you'll have a good time.",1219190400,10,828,4.710344827586207
2984041,2,B000WM4R1O,"Plays with the story line in a book in attempt at epic greatness, but falls short.  The executives in this movie are extremely unconvincing, when compared to footage of the real people.",1218758400,,185,4.78125
2984072,3,B000WM4R1O,"The Crooked E is a fairly entertaining story (key word being story) of Brian Cruver and his experiences in the year he worked at Enron. It's interesting in that it gives some insight to what it was like to work there, the cult of personality that existed and how the employees (for the most part) blindly followed Management into the abyss. It's fairly light stuff, decent but unspectacular acting though I would have rather seen more about the interworking's of Enron instead of his silly relationship with the girlfriend. That could have made this movie so much better. Overall, it's not a great movie but it is entertaining.

I think it's rather funny reading some of the 5 star reviews which are mostly from women pining for Christian Kane. Shannon Elizabeth actually looks a bit anorexic in the movie when compared to what she looked like in American Pie. She didn't look good.",1407283200,,882,4.764705882352941

2984074,5,B000WM4R1O,"Awesome movie, bought only for Christian Kane.  Well worth the purchase as he does an amazing job playing someone who had the world and lost it.",1396396800,,144,4.538461538461538
2984075,4,B000WM4R1O,There is a lot to the story of Enron that can't be told in one movie but I have to admit that this did a good job at getting to the crux of what happened from Brian's perspective. It was well acted and the narrative style helped to move the story along but there is so much that was left unsaid. The movie left me wanting to know what has happened to the people--including Brian Cruver--since the fall of Enron. The fact that I'm still interested as opposed to not caring is a testament that this is a wet-your-whistle good movie.,1391990400,,530,4.257425742574258

It gave me a much better understanding for my Financial Management class, and it was entertaining as well.  I would recommend it to anyone...not just for school.",1368316800,,368,4.53030303030303
