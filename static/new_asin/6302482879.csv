471003,4,6302482879,"William Talman (he reminds one here of a poor man's Joseph Cotten) who portrayed Hamilton Berger on television's PERRY MASON plays Emmet Myers, a psychotic killer who hitch-hikes, rides, then robs and murders his benefactors. Fleeing from the police, he meets two men on a fishing boat en route to Mexico and keeps them hostage until he can find safety south of the border...Parental hatred seemed to be much of the cause of Myer's curious personality, that coupled by a deformed right eye - which doesn't close even during sleep - makes for a creepy character indeed.  Based upon an unpublished story by Daniel Mainwaring which was reportedly based upon fact, the story wasn't so much a warning to beware of hitch-hikers, but rather a study in fear which prevailed in audience pleasers of the 1950's; ""thinking"" people were entranced by science fiction, aliens, nuclear attacts, etc. - this made for more intellectual conversation among fifties folk.  Generally regarded as being the only film noir directed by a woman, Ida Lupino's THE HITCH-HIKER is also a good example of the genre.",1030233600,5,1086,4.994475138121547
471004,4,6302482879,"The only film noir directed by a woman, Ida Lupino's Hitch-Hiker benefits from her great decision to pare the movie down to its final length of 71 minutes.  This makes it a tightly wound thriller that does exactly what it should---and makes you wish she had directed more films in the same genre.
Two middle class working guys go on a fishing trip and make the mistake of picking up a wacko hitch-hiker, convincingly played by William Tallman, who quickly proceeds to force the two at gunpoint to take him to a remote town in southern California where he can hide out safely, he thinks.  The wacko is a convicted killer who's wanted in a few states for murdering unsuspecting motorists.
The interplay of the three characters is what gives the film its punch and is a powerful, non-cliched take on why you should never pick up a stranger.  This is also one of the first American films to feature characters speaking in Spanish (although a brief scene, it lends some intrigue; the Spanish is not translated), that unfortunately contrasts with the Mexican police officials whose English is so perfect you know they're American actors.
Nevertheless, this is a great entry in the film noir canon and worthy of seeing, if not owning, if you're a film noir buff.",1017100800,6,1255,4.7214611872146115
471005,4,6302482879,"Sure, the script seldom rises above potboiler status and the locations are familiar from a thousand Lone Pine cowboy shoots. Still, this unpretentious little suspenser really delivers the goods that will keep you on edge. The cast of three is outstanding. Was there ever a more low-key performer than Frank Lovejoy or anyone better at representing Joe Average. Edmond O'Brien calibrates as usual, making a credible companion to the laidback Lovejoy. Then there's William Talman in his pre-Perry Mason days, scaring the heck out of everyone with his bug-eyed psycho bit -- too bad he gave up the nuthouse for TV and a steady payday. Put a gun in Talman's hand and pack all three into a tight little car traveling to nowhere and you have a good view of 1950's middle-class nightmare.

William Talman, five or so years prior to his role of a lifetime on ""Perry Mason"" as always-pissed off D.A. Hamilton Burger, is the evil Emmett Meyers, a fugitive from justice.  Talman is perfect in the role.  I'm surprised Edmond O'Brien agreed to be cast in this particular role though.  He is excellent in it but he has hardly any dialogue.  I didn't like the ending, and I would have liked to see the two guys try to tackle Meyers at least once...after all, he was just a spineless wimp with a gun.

concerns  two average Joes, played by Frank Lovejoy and Edmund O'Brien, who go on a fishing trip near the Mexican border and happen to pick up a hitch-hiker who turns out to be  highway serial killer Emmitt Myers played by William Talman. THE HITCH-HIKER is a suspenseful film noir played to the hilt for all the tension that can be wrung out of the based on truth story written by Collier Young.

Rather, she uses the dialogue to give the viewer insight into the character and the plot twists are not so sudden where they seem unbelievable. Not the least bit predictable, The Hitch-Hiker tells us the story of two men held captive by a serial killer.  The victims, who were on their way to am out-of-the-way fishing locale, are diverted to Mexico, but not without a couple of failed escape attempts and a radio broadcast that keeps viewers abreast of the manhunt.

As the film opens, we see a series of brutal murders committed by an unseen hitch-hiker and the police on both sides of the border are on the lookout for the murderer.

Of course, they stop and pick up a hitch-hiker, played by William Talman, and, guess what?---he's the psycho all the cops are looking for.

471089,4,6302482879,"My continuing explorations of noir have brought me to this exciting low-budget affair featuring the unknown-to-me William Tallman giving a stunning performance as multiple murderer Emmett Myers, who kidnaps a couple of old war veteran buddies (Edmond O'Brien and Frank Lovejoy) in the desert and forces them to drive him to Mexico. This is superbly done, and along with the other Lupino films I've seen (""The Outrage"" and ""The Bigamist"") offers strong proof that she was one of the great directors of the early 50s; she builds suspense slowly and steadily -- it's hard to believe the film is only 71 minutes, and not because it is in any way ""slow"" -- and her eye for the landscape and for the psychology of fear gives even the obvious rear-projection sequences in the car a feeling of authenticity.  Location shooting was still pretty rare in the early 1950s and it's nice that Lupino got a chance to get out of L.A. for this effort, which really profits from the desert desolation and loneliness.

Talman's performance and character -- the bum eye that causes a twitch in his face, the sadism, the sick sense of humor and the constant threatening of his companions -- is what is going to stick with most people, though O'Brien and Lovejoy are both fine in rather thankless roles; he is never so over-the-top that he becomes unbelievable, and he is given just enough depth through some vague comments about his past that you can practically trace his decline into insanity. We also are made uneasy enough that we never really are sure how things will turn out, as the captives become more desperate and their captor more crazy -- all the way up until the powerful climax on a pier in a port town in Mexico.

471092,4,6302482879,"The great Warner Brothers film actress Ida Lupino started a low-budget film company with her husband, Collier Young; when a director for their company, Elmer Young, became sick and couldn't do work on a project of his (based on Billy Cook who murdered a family of four from whom he hitchhiked a ride), Lupino stepped in and finished it for him. The result is this great film noir, the first ever directed by a woman, and Lupino's own favorite among all the films she directed. The tone is so incredibly assured that even where the film does not entirely satisfy you feel you're failing Lupino rather than vice-versa. One of the singularities of the film is that even though the narrative focuses almost entirely on three men--the psychotic serial killer Emmet Myers (the terrifying William Talman) and the two friends on a fishing trip he holds hostage--Lupino gives us almost no background for any of them. Their sparse dialogue is focused almost entirely on what Myers wants the two hostages to do and their accomplishing of their tasks; the two friends' complex relationship (one endures his terror almost entirely stoically, while the other slowly breaks down) is conveyed solely through subtle facial gestures and body language. The film's setting is a kind of nightmare vision of Baja California, devoid of almost all people or vegetation; almost all we are left with is the three men and the radio they listen to in order to pass the time. After a while the three men become more and more indistinguishable from one another (particularly when Myers forces one of the men to change clothes with him at gunpoint). We are to understand that, stripped of any civilized context, the three men become nothing more than three animals, separated or linked to one another solely by their bonds of affection or of loathing. This is a film that's almost impossible to forget, and all the more remarkable that it came from one of the rare women directors of the Fifties (there are no women whatsoever in the film other than one of Myers' first victims, of whom we see only her slumped body and open hand).",1231977600,3,2100,4.787878787878788

471122,4,6302482879,"""The Hitch-Hiker"" is a 1-hour-and-10-minute low budget suspense that has the distinction of being the only classic film noir directed by a woman. It was directed by Ida Lupino, who starred in a few film noirs herself, and went on to direct many television series. The screenplay was based on an unpublished story by Daniel Mainwaring, who wasn't credited by RKO, because Howard Hughes didn't like his politics. The film is introduced with the declaration ""This is the true story of a man and a gun and a car."" It was inspired by a real crime that took place in the early 1950s.

Two friends, Roy Collins (Edmund O'Brien) and Gil Bowen (Frank Lovejoy), are seeking some rest and relaxation on a fishing trop to Mexico, where they pick up a hitchhiker. The hitchhiker immediately pulls a gun on them and identifies himself as wanted killer Emmett Myers (William Talman). Myers holds the men constantly at gunpoint as they make their way toward Santa Rosalia, where Myers intends to evade pursuit by crossing a river. Myers plays sadistic games with Roy and Gil, and reminds them, ""You guys are gonna die, that's all. Just a question of when,"" as both Mexican and American authorities hone their search for the missing men. In a comically cruel twist of fate, Emmett is afflicted with an eye that doesn't stay shut, so no one can tell if he is awake or asleep.

I found the opening of ""The Hitch-Hiker"", when we see the atrocities of a ruthless, faceless murderer, to be the most effective part of the film. Director Ida Lupino really creates a sense of menace in a few minutes. After that, the film is fine but predictable. Collins is hot-headed and emotional, while Bowen is more even-tempered and less impulsive. It is unclear which strategy is best under the circumstances, which adds a little interest. But this is not one of Edmund O'Brien's more memorable performances. There's just not much to it. William Talman is more memorable as thoroughly sociopathic Emmett Myers. The film's perspective on Mexico and Mexicans is interesting. Conversations that take place in Spanish are not translated. Gil Bowen appears to be fluent in Spanish himself. And Mexico is not the haven for American criminals that it usually is in movies. Mexican authorities work hard to catch Myers. ""The Hitch-Hiker"" didn't always keep my interest, but it's a solid B-movie, intended for the second half of a double bill. 3  stars.

The DVD (Kino Video 2000): This print is unrestored but acceptable. There are some white specks and the sound could use a little cleaning up. There are no bonus features or subtitles.",1125705600,6,2594,4.82247191011236

  This Hitch-hiker (William Talman) is a killer.  He bums a ride from anyone, even couples, kills them and ditches the car somewhere.  The police now know who it is, but they just can't catch up with him yet.

471124,4,6302482879,"Thanks to modern technology, another film noir classic has escaped from Hollywood's vault of too-often-overlooked or forgotten films.  Albeit a minor classic, ""The Hitch-Hiker,"" directed by Ida Lupino, is a taut drama notable for it's realism, as well as a haunting performance by William Talman.

Reputedly based on a true incident (""Penned from the headlines""), the story traces the movements of a hitch-hiker, Emmett Myers (Talman), who repays his highway hosts by robbing and murdering them.  Initially, we are shown mere glimpses of Myers and his victims, which successfully sets the stage for the introduction of Roy Collins (Edmond O'Brien) and Gilbert Bowen (Frank Lovejoy), two friends on their way to a fishing trip in Mexico, when, unawares, they pick up Myers.

What follows is a realistic depiction of what most likely would transpire when ordinary people are suddenly faced with such extraordinary circumstances.  And the strength of the film lies in the fact that when Collins and Bowen are kidnapped, held at gunpoint and forced to do the bidding of their captor, they react and behave in a manner that is both consistent with their current state of affairs and believable.  There are no feigned heroics or superhuman contrivances that allow the two captives to effect an escape; instead, the story plays out in much the way one would, in reality, expect in such a situation, which, when extrapolated, effectively drives home the true horror of Collin's and Bowen's circumstance.

The lion's share of the credit for the success of this film must go to director Ida Lupino, whose almost documentary-style approach to the story lends it the necessary grit and intensity.  She scores double points, as well, for not only delivering a memorable film, but doing so at a time in which few women were afforded the opportunity to perform at such a level behind the camera.  Lupino's success no doubt helped pave the way for the likes of Jane Campion, Jodie Foster, Gillian Armstrong, Allison Anders and a host of other women who have since proved that gender alone does not equate to excellence and ability in the director's chair.

In arguably his best performance, character actor William Talman turns in a memorable performance as the sociopath, Myers.  Forget your Freddys and Jasons; Talman's portrayal creates the kind of character that nightmares are really made of.  Myers is a guy you could pass on the street, or-- yes, even give a lift to if you saw him with his thumb out on the highway-- without giving him a second thought.  And that's what makes him so scary; his disguise is that he doesn't have a disguise, and it's so much more effective than having a hockey mask or hands with steel fingers could ever be.

O'Brien and Lovejoy also turn in credible performances, creating characters who, like Talman's Myers, are real.  Watching them, you believe that Collins is, indeed, an auto mechanic, and Bowen a draftsman; two friends off together to do some fishing.

The supporting cast includes Jose Torvay (Captain Alvarado); Jean Del Val (Inspector General); Clark Howat (Government Agent); and Natividad Vacio (Jose).  The 71 minute running time is perfect for this film; rather than resort to superfluous filler, Lupino stays on task without ever straying, and in the end makes ""The Hitch-Hiker"" a ride that will leave you wondering what you would do in a like situation, and hoping that you'll never have to find out.  It's the magic of the movies.",1117238400,4,3473,4.97923875432526
471125,5,6302482879,"""The Hitch-hiker"" is a largely forgotten and overlooked gem in the thriller/film-noir genre. It is also Ida Lupino's best directorial effort for the big screen. For years, Lupino graced the silver screen as an actress, most notably in ""They Drive by Night"" and ""High Sierra"" (both with Bogart). In the late 1940s, Lupino formed her own production company, The Filmakers with producer/writer husband Collier Young.

The movie follows a pair of war vets, Edmond O'Brien and Frank Lovejoy who get some R and R from their wives to go fishing, and sneak off to Mexicali to troll for dames along the way. As you might well guess, they pick up even worse trouble in the form of hitchhiker Emmett Myers, played with a menacing edge by William Talman.

Myers forces the two to provide safe passage in their beat-up car down the Baja California peninsula to Santa Rosalia, where he can catch a ferry to the Mexico mainland.

The ride along the way is a harrowing trip, the suspense notched up by Young and Collier's excellent screenwriting. Daniel Mainwaring adds a lot of excellent noir dialogue in his uncredited contribution.

While O'Brien gives his usual competent good guy performance, Lovejoy and Talman really make this movie. Lovejoy gives this movie its heart: We sympathize with his character when he attempts to protect and reassure a little Mexican girl when the three stop at a dry goods store to stock up on groceries. Talman plays the killer Myers a bit off-kilter, his lean, elongated figure dominating the other two, his lazy, all-seeing eye holding them hostage while Myers yet sleeps. Talman's powerful performance looks forward to Rutger Hauer's portrayal in Robert Harmon's 1984 ""The Hitcher"" and Dennis Hopper in most everything he's been in since ""Blue Velvet.""

What most rings true with ""The Hitch-hiker"" is Lupino's use of actual shooting locations as opposed to set backdrops, and the cinema verite feel she gives in having her Mexican actors -- most importantly, the DF trooper who hunts down Myers -- speak in Spanish, without subtitles and without caricature. It almost has a documentary feel.

But what really makes this movie gel is RKO's sterling crew, which Lupino hired to put this movie together. One of the reasons this movie has more of a 1940s than 1950s feel is the unparalleled cinematography of Nicholas Musaraca, who was cameraman for many of RKO's best productions, most notably ""Cat People"" and ""Out of the Past"" (both directed by Jacques Tourneur). Who else but Musaraca could make a workaday Plymouth sedan appear so dominating and intimidating at it looms over the lonely dirt roads of the Mexican back country?

Musaraca's use of key lighting and deep shadows to heighten the tension really have you sitting on the edge of your seat, as does Leith Stevens' brass-heavy scoring, brimming over with trumpets as a counterpart to the car's horn and string basses portending doom with what legendary movie composer David Raksin called ""fifthboding.""

C. Bakaleinikoff, the great unsung conductor of RKO's soundtracks, directs with his characteristic Sturm und Drang he used in ""Out of the Past"" and Hitchcock's ""Notorious"" (1946).

Sound technicians Roy Meadows and Clem Portman mix the score, sound effects and dialogue superbly, employing a rich bass and a full, robust midrange. Characteristic of 1940s and 50s sound, you can identify every line of dialogue without any neck craning. Compare that with today's special effects extravaganzas, full of Foley effects and swoosh and clang aural graituity, in which most whispers are yet barely audible. Try as they might, today's Hollywood still can't produce a film comparable in technical consistency to the old studio system.

Personally, I rank ""The Hitch-hiker"" in my Top 10 favorite noir movies of all time. It belongs in such august company as ""Double Indemnity,"" ""DOA,"" ""White Heat"" and ""Out of the Past.""",1098835200,25,3896,5.0639625585023404

Enter two guys on a fishing trip (Frank Lovejoy and Edmund O'brien) who've just gotten away from the wives for some R&R. Well, they stop and give our traveling murderer a ride, and become his captives. The rest of the movie concerns the trio's journey through the desert of mexico. How can two normal joes possibly escape from a maniac, who not only has a gun, but sleeps with one eye open? How can they even hope to survive a man who has already killed everyone else he's come in contact with? I liked this one. It would make a great double feature with THE SADIST. They both have that nerve racking ""if only we'd never met this guy"" sort of vibe. Not bad...",1092268800,4,795,4.342281879194631
471127,4,6302482879,"In The Hitch-Hiker, Ida Lupino presents a tense noir thriller that kept me engaged throughout.  Released in 1953 as the second of a double bill, and not promoted as it should have been, this movie languished in movie land limbo for quite awhile.
Edmond O'Brien and Frank Lovejoy star as Roy Collins and Gilbert Bowen, respectively, two men embarking on a hunting/fishing trip.  The trouble begins when they pick up a hitchhiker named Emmet Myers, played by William Talman.  Turns out Myers is a sadistic killer who's being sought by numerous law enforcement agencies for a string of murders.
The tension and suspense start to build almost immediately, and are sustained throughout the movie as the men travel the southwestern deserts of California into Mexico.  The men try to look for a means to escape, but Myers keeps a tight lease on the men, and due to his unpredictable nature and complete lack of remorse, they know he would kill without regard.  Also, Myers has a paralyzed right eyelid which causes it never to close properly.  This means he actually sleeps with one eye open, giving the appearance that he's always watching, even when he's sleeping.  Very creepy!
As the manhunt for Myers increases, the pressure increases, and the men know that once Myers decides they are more of a liability than they're worth, he will dispose of them, as he tells them this every chance he gets.  There was just enough character development provided for Myers in the tight script to give viewers a glimpse into what drives the man and his contempt for life in general.  The three leading actors all play their parts very professionally, but Talman really sells his performance.  He provided a brutal yet subtle picture of a remorseless, psychotic killer and reminded me of a coiled rattlesnake that could strike at any moment.
The oppressive desert locations, a well-written script, and taut directing work together nicely, creating a sense of anxiety and forboding right up to the end of the movie.  I was surprised, but pleased with the outcome, as it didn't seem in line with other crime dramas of the time.
There were some minor flaws in the print, and I noticed the audio dropped out very briefly on two different occasions, but that took away none of my enjoyment of this film.  And given the condition of the original prints, this restored version looks really great.  Included is an interesting introduction by Robert Clarke, in which he details some of his experiences working with Ida Lupino.",1069113600,12,2499,4.865566037735849

7826369,5,6302482879,"Not only was Ida Lupino a fantastic actress of which Roadhouse (1948) was an exceptional example , she was also an excellent and groundbreaking female writer and director . Growing up in the 1970's after entering the scene in 1963 , I rather thought hitchhiking became a dangerous undertaking beginning in the 60's/70's . Not so . Winding back the clock to 1953 , Ida shows us , as starkly as possible , that this mode of travel is one civilized people should always be wary of .
In addition to other favorable things you'll read about this film , Ms. Lupino shows us the Mexican people both collaborating with American authorities and to great effect and with proper reverence in their own country . We encounter store owners  , farmers , police and ordinary citizens who interact with one another entirely in Spanish and sans subtitles . This adds great realism and richness to the film . Entire conversations occur in Spanish , much to the anger , fear and resentment of the film's villain .
Details such as this alone make for highly recommended viewing . As gripping for me now as it must have been for audiences of its' day .",1504137600,,1131,4.544117647058823

This is due to the masterful direction of Miss Ida Lupino, and the amazing acting of Hamilton Berger from ""Perry Mason"". Yes William Talman from The Perry Mason TV show is the hitch hiker/serial killer, who kidnaps Edmond O'Brian and Frank Lovejoy in an attempt to escape to I believe, a town called Santa Rosalia on the mexican coast. The sadism he exhibits and visits on the kidnapped fishermen is close to ""Criminal Minds "" as I have ever seen in film. If you get this film you will watch it again, just to see how good of an actor Mr. Talman really was. And how amazing a director Ms. Lupine was.",1477872000,,676,4.121212121212121

7826374,2,6302482879,"Great film. Worth watching if you are at all interested in film noir or early women filmmakers. However, this DVD was a total waste of money. I bought it because I thought it would be better quality than the free internet archive version. It was barely better. Extremely dark, fuzzy, many scratches and film decay. This is not a remastered version. There are cleaner copies up on YouTube, which I should have checked first. Luckily I only spent 4 bucks including shipping on this turd.

The film noir society did a really clean version of it but didn't distribute it. This film is very much historically significant and a well made, tightly paced film noir piece. It deserves a high quality DVD or Blu-Ray release from Criterion or Arrow or some other reputable distributor.",1443225600,2,774,4.776119402985074
7826375,3,6302482879,"Apart from Jack the Ripper, films about serial killers were rare in the first part of the 20th Century (e.g., M) although there were a few films about spree killers, the most famous of whom were Bonnie and Clyde whose exploits were covered in You Only Live Once (1937), They Live By Night (1949), and Gun Crazy (1949). But Bonnie and Clyde were bank robbers first, and did not kill for the sake of killing. This film, The Hitch-hiker, is the true story of spree killer Billy Cook who murdered 6 people during a 22-day rampage in 1950-51.

Edmond OBrien (1915-85) plays a guy driving on a vacation with his friend. He does his usual good job but its not up to his excellent performances as the passionate insurance investigator  in film noir classic The Killers (1946), the grizzled Freddy Sykes in The Wild Bunch (1969), Oscar Muldoon in The Barefoot Contessa (1954), the fiery Senator in Seven Days in May (1962), and the newspaper publisher in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962). He won the Oscar and the Golden Globe for Barefoot Contessa and was nominated for Seven Days in May. OBrien was best when he was passionate, and here is too subdued to give his usual bravura performance.

Square jawed Frank Lovejoy (1912-62) plays OBriens friend. Hes best known for the TV series I Was a Communist for the FBI (1951-3) and for his many war films (Home of the Brave, Retreat,Hell, Strategic Air Command). In 1956 he had his own TV series Man Against Crime. Lovejoy does his usual good job in this film.

William Talman (1915-68) plays the spree killer, but hes most famous as Perry Masons DA foil, Hamilton Burger, on the long playing TV series (1957-66). Talman did a few films, almost all of them crime dramas, before moving to TV. Talman is aided by some facial makeup in the film, but he really isn't all that menacing by todays standards.

Ida Lupino (1918-95) directs and co-wrote this film. Lupino is perhaps best remembered for her Emmy nominated role in TVs Mr. Adams and Eve (1957-8) although she won the New York Film Critics award for The Hard Way (1943). In the 40s she was known as the poor mans Bette Davis and put in some gritty performances in films like High Sierra (1941) and The Hard Way (1943). Lupino turned to directing in 1949 and ultimately did 7 films before concentrating on TV.

Cinematographer Nicholas Musuraca (1892-1975) was a master of the film noir visuals (e.g., ""Stranger on the 3rd Floor"", ""Cat People"", Out of the Past). Musuraca was a Val Lewton graduate and worked with Fritz Lang (They Clash By Night, The Blue Gardenia). Unfortunately, while the black and white photography is very good, Musuraca shows none of his great skills in this film. Ironically he received an Oscar nomination for his work on I Remember Mama (1948).

The NY Times called the film An unrelenting but superficial study of abnormal psychology coupled with standard chase melodrama, it moves swiftly to an obvious conclusion. They added Miss Lupino's brisk direction and the solid portrayals by the three principals overcome, to a large degree, the film's cops-versus-killer format.

Although called film noir, there are few film noir conventions being used. Classic film noir involves urban settings, a motley crew of criminals and their associates, a double and preferably a triple cross, a femme fatale, lots of rain and dark shadows, and a hero who enters into the underworld reluctantly and inadvisably. This film has none of these conventions and it would be a mistake to refer to it as film noir, which many people do.

Despite not being film noir, the film is perfectly adequate, with good performances and good direction. The best feature is the desert location shootings, and the fact that its the first of Lupinos films and one of the few films directed by a woman up until that time.",1440288000,3,3811,4.753403933434191
7826376,5,6302482879,"An unexpected treat, this film is a minor masterpiece in the crime genre of the 1950's.  Not a dull moment from beginning to end.  With Ida Lupino's masterful direction, who also co-wrote the screenplay which is based on actual events, she maintains the steady suspense to its anticipated climax.  Edmund O'Brien's emotionalism balances Frank Lovejoy's stolid, almost stoic character.  The real star of this gem is William Talman.  He gives a chilling performance of the psychopath, who kidnaps O'Brien and Lovejoy and orders them to drive to Mexico.  Menacing, cunning, sneering, contemptuous of humanity, his acting is on a par with Robert Mitchum's character in Cape Fear, maybe even better.  This is one scary dude; he made his character utterly believable.",1439942400,3,761,5.239669421487603
