I really like 'Bollywood' films and although this was met with some opposition in India, I really like the input of the two cultures that are recognized in this film.",1357171200,,305,5.0
8315003,5,B000HX3RF0,"I love this movie! The story is beautiful no matter how many times I watch it, I end up crying just because it is so easy to fall in love with the characters.",1268265600,,158,3.8181818181818183
8315004,4,B000HX3RF0,"The story takes place in north Indian Kashmir.  Zooni (Kajol) a young adult woman desires to experience the world: its places, smells, relationships like a ""normal"" girl would ... you see, Zooni is blind.  While taking a ""sight-seeing"" tour, she meets ""Rehan"" (Aamir Khan) an outgoing flirtatious tour guide who takes a special interest in her.  Rehan ""shows"" Zooni the city of Delhi for the first ime in her life.  He promises that the time she spends with him will be the most precious moments of her life.  And so the adventures begin.  What Zooni does not realize is that Rehan has another, more sinister, occupation, the result of which may destroy all the hoped-for love.  I shall not give away the rest of the plot.  Given the geographical setting, there is some stunning photography, and we see parts of India's great beauty.

Enough to say that this is a romance ... and a tragedy.  Unlike many of the ""song and dance"" Indian movies, this is a well-thought-through plot brought to life by Aamir Khan and Kajol.  Don't get me wrong, this one also has ""song and dance"" - part of India's great movie tradition, but it is woven meaningfully into the forward movement of the story.

I only gave Fanaa four stars, because, although there are moments that are captivating, compared to those films that Aamir Khan himself directs and produces, this lacked something in its story-line and even in the acting.  Still, it is well worth watching, even if you don't end up adding it to you personal DVD library.  The choice of English subtitles makes it possible to follow along without much trouble.",1263686400,,1596,4.7355072463768115
8315005,5,B000HX3RF0,I loved the movie. It changed my perception of cinematography forever. It was so beautifully and meticulously crafted to the detail.  It takes so many turns that makes the 3 hours go like 10 minutes. I do recommend it.,1255132800,,218,4.589743589743589
8315006,2,B000HX3RF0,"The first half of the movie is a light hearted romp in the Bollywood tradition. I truly enjoyed it. The actors sing and dance their way through a tour of the beautiful places in Delhi. The lovers meet, sparks fly, and they fall in love. The production is very polished and professional, the actors and actresses attractive, the setting spectacular.

Spoiler Alert! In the second half of the film, we discover that the attractive ladies man is actually a terrorist, who coolly murders dozens of people, including some of the most sympathetic characters in the film. In spite of this, the song and dance routines continue, becoming truly absurd in the midst of what might have been a thriller about a nuclear bomb. The terrorist sings and dances almost  to the end of the film, in a whimsical children's song, which is like a scene out of Dr. Strangelove. Bollywood asks for a suspension of disbelief, which I usually give effortlessly, but this is a suspension too far. A muslim terrorist who sings and dances, cavorts with women, drinks alcohol, playing the lothario? I was embarrassed that I rented this one, and promoted it to my family. One by one, they all got up and left, and I watched the ending alone, in the mistaken belief that there would be a late return to a viable story.

The most troubling aspect of the film was the attempt to portray a mass murderer as a sympathetic figure. I am familiar with the attitude in modern Hollywood films that fair is foul, and foul is fair. It is disappointing to realize that Bollywood suffers from the same disorder.",1192233600,3,1565,4.663043478260869
8315007,5,B000HX3RF0,"I am not from India, however, I just love Indian music.  I purchased this movie, after seeing the movie on my neighbor's DVD.  I fell in love with the story and the music.  It's a long movie but wonderfull...I enjoyed every minute of it....A must have!!!!!",1187308800,2,256,4.521739130434782
8315008,3,B000HX3RF0,"Released in `06 'Faana' (meaning: ""destroyed in love"") begins as an endearing romance between a beautiful blind tourist Zooni (Kajol) and her glib, poetic tour guide Rehan (Aamir Khan), sounds good doesn't it? What more could you ask for than two of the most popular stars in Indian cinema, production values to rival ""Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham' and some of the most magnificent, intoxicating landscapes for the musical sequences I've ever seen. Definitely a promising start to a film that appeared to have everything in place to deliver a truly memorable viewing experience.

Unfortunately the plot takes a drastic and totally unexpected detour in the second half of the movie and the touching romance is overwhelmed by political upheaval, terrorism and separatist issues that smother the original storyline and ultimately my interest in the film.

Bottom line, `Faana' is worth at least one watch to see the radiant Kajol and the exquisite musical numbers. My Rating: from the beginning to intermission: 4  Stars, from intermission to ending: 2 Stars. Overall Rating: 3  Stars.",1183334400,4,1078,5.213872832369942
8315009,5,B000HX3RF0,"I have a special regard for this movie, because I had the enormous luck to see it in the faboulous, incredibly ornate and atmospheric Raj Mandir theatre of Jaipur. Watching not just the film, but also the reactions of the audience -who were obviously enjoying the experience enormously and constantly and spontaneously expressing so- was a great delight.

""Fanaa"" is a concept taken from mysticism. In the world of mystic poetry ""fanaa"" was the point at which the mystic's own sense of self was destroyed or anihilated by his/her union with God. We are talking deep religion here and, in this context, that someone uses this word as a title for a Bollywood film can even sound a bit like sacrilege. The concept is, though, brilliantly used by the writer and applied simply to ""True Love"" a rare event which, arguably, contains a spark of the divine, and that ordinary people can, ever so rarely -but not so much as mystic love-, experience in this life.

Zooni (Kajol) is a blind girl who has lived protected -and isolated- all her life by the love and warmth of her family, who have raised her like the fragile maiden princess of a fairy tale. When she must set out for the big city, Delhhi, and be appart from her parents for the first time, she jokes with them about the possibility of finding there ""her prince"". Big poetic irony -we, the audience, realize instantly. ""And what shall I tell my prince when I find him?"", Zooni asks her mother; ""May my life be destroyed in your love!!!"" answers the mother, quoting poetry.

And Zooni meets Rehan (Aamir Khan)whom nobody would take as a prince at first, or even second or third, sight. But Zooni, being blind, is not blinded by appearances, and soon recognizes the prince in Rehan...even though he is bent on proving otherwise. What will you have from the clash between the innocent, virginal princess who believes Love is everything and the worldwise, cynical casanova who believes in nothing? Comedy or drama? This being Bollywood, you are served, but of course, both.

Thus, the story begins as a romantic comedy, and I must declare right now my profound admiration for a writer who choses a ""verse war"" as the first confrontation between the protagonists, and has them trying to outwit each other in a rhyming challenge. My admiration peaks when, in the first song, the composers and writer manage to use the concept of ""fanaa"" inside a teasing, seductive piece, full of sensuality and inviting temptation, in which Rehan expresses the -very unromantic- attraction he feels for Zooni.

But soon the easygoing romance becomes drama when Zooni, fully aware of Rehan's lack of belief in love or any other thing human or divine, fully aware of his intentions, decides to follow her own beliefs unto the ultimate consequences: she decides to love, even if hers is unrequited love....And Zooni pronounces the magical words, ""May my life be destroyed in your love!!"" Symbolically, what she goes through in Delhi makes her SEE....and also literally. But then, fate strikes in the very contemporary form of terrorism and the story takes a sharp turn...after the intermission.

The second time the writer and composers use the concept of ""fanaa"" is very different from the first, and one of the most beautiful love songs I've ever heard, but I can't explain any more without including several spoilers.....

This film suffered from some controversy in India. One of its main stars, Aamir Khan, made some public comments about the eviction of entire villages in the state of Gujarat towards the creation of a gigantic water reservoir. He commented particularly on the unfairness of having thousands of people thrown out of their houses, living on the streets. The BJP (nationalists, ruling the state of Gujarat) were instantly incensed, and so was the Congress Party (ruling India), and they asked the actor for a public apology. Aamir Khan, quite a politically-minded person, refused. As a result, ""Fanaa"" was banned in the state of Gujarat and, when one theatre owner dared go against this ban, the consequences were quite horrid.

What else can I say? Everybody in this film (and regarding the actors I must say that Kajol is charming and very princess-like, but Aamir Khan definitely RULES and totally steals the show) have managed to create here a classical Bollywood, one that touches several genres from comedy to drama and thriller, throwing in, as Bollywood will usually have it of late, a pinch of politics, patriotism, terrorism -maybe the Furies that control our fates in the present times-....and all apparently effortlessly revolving around the concept of ""fanaa"": the limits to which one is prepared to go for love, and the power of a feeling that can give or take life.",1167264000,16,4730,4.889027431421447
8315010,4,B000HX3RF0,"Over the years I have familiarized myself with Indian/Bollywood movies. Some of my favorites are the modern romance ""Kuch Naa Kaho"", empowering ""Shakti - The Power"", family favorite ""Kuch Kuch Hota Hai"", epic-style romances such as ""Devdas,"" and more politically minded films like ""Yahaan"" and ""Veer Zaara"" etc... I will say that although I enjoy watching the lovey-dovey, overtly cheesy Bollywood films out there, its nice to see those rare ones that exude maturity and uniqueness in every way.

Can I say that for Fanaa? Absolutely. 100%.

It starts out as a typical love story, but with twists all the way. First off, Zooni (played by Kajol) is a blind woman seeking independence from her slightly over protective father and loving mother. She sets out for Delhi to participate in a performance with friends in honor of her country, India. Yet through her visit to the city she meets a tourguide who is smitten the minute he lays eyes upon her. Rehan (played by Aamir Khan) is a loose man in all his ways. He finds it easy to woo many women, a flirt and he's a bit arrogant, but his words win Zooni over. It seems like their newfound relationship is destined, but as in any Bollywood love story, expect the unexpected.

Rehan has a secret that may come between them. But what is he hiding from Zooni? He's not what he seems.

Khan's role play of Rehan is amazingly easy to fall in love with; he is able to step into the shoes of who he is portraying onscreen and master that personality. In ""Fanaa,"" you don't want to take your eyes off of him.

Kajol has improved with age and beauty and is strikingly perfect in imitating one without sight. This role was empowering for her and shows that she has always been capable of compelling drama and romance.

The two have an undeniable chemistry that make you want to see more.

What I most loved about this film is that the actors act differently. No longer do they stare off in space while recounting events or tears flow uncontrollably. This film is mature in everyway, in direction, content and acting abilities.

The songs are so well orchestrated, catchy and moving. The opening number ""Chand Sifarish"" increases in intensity when Rehan figuratively SEES Zooni. She's blind of course, which makes the irony even more heartfelt.

Don't waste time in buying this movie now. If you are a fan of Indian movies, this one is worth every penny.",1156291200,11,2390,4.671428571428572
