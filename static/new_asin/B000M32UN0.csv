8166214,4,B000M32UN0,Basic elbow and knee fighting instruction is hard to come by; this DVD does it well.  The demonstrations are useful and the techniques look like they would inflict serious damage on an opponent. The description above on this does it no justice.  This is a quick learn of strong strikes.  Too bad there is no Kata or long sequence to learn on this DVD.,1187136000,5,351,4.453125
