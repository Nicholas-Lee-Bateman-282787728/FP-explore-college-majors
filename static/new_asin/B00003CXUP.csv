1306455,4,B00003CXUP,"VALENTINE is a new horror-thriller about five young girls who are being stalked by a Cupid mask wearing killer who could possibly be the same guy they all rejected back in middle school. There are many plot twists, lots of action, lots of action, many suspects, and a high body count. This movie turned out to be much better than I expected, and I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of horror movies!",989539200,12,401,4.36
1306456,4,B00003CXUP,"If Critics could get over the fact that... Yes, Girls are Chased down dark hallways by a Mask wearing Serial Killer in ""Valentine"", they would actually realise that the film Does bring a few New Tricks to the somewhat Tired Formula.
For Example, There are No Killer Monologues at the Climax... You know what I mean. Eg, ""Yes, I killed all those Scantily Clad Teens, and you Know Why... Because Blah Blah Blah."" They tend to get on my Nerves and Spoil a Perfectly Good Horror film. They Slow the Pacing down to a Crawl and they turn the Scary Killer into a Cry Baby. ""Valentine"" Cleverly does away with them.
The most Original Thing the film does, the thing that sets it apart from All the Others is the fact that it doesn't make Any Pop-Culture References... Not One. (some may count the ""Angel"" reference, but I wouldn't, that was probably just Coincidence) Pop-Culture References (Eg. Mentioning Jamie Lee Curtis' Horror films in ""Scream"", mentioning the OJ Killing in ""Urban Legends - Final Cut"") drive me Insane, they are thrown in my Young Screenwriters who Think they are being Hip and Clever, it May have worked in ""Scream"" and ""Bride of Chucky"", but it Doesn't work in ""Scream 3"" or ""Urban Legends - Final Cut"". Quentin Tarantino does it Extremely Well, Kevin Smith does in Extremely Poorly. (in ""Clerks"" he had the right idea, in all his other films he has Blown it) ""Valentine"" showed a lot of Class leaving them out and I Thank the Makers from the Bottom of my Heart.
The film cleverly sets up Many Characters with the Opportunity and the Motive to be the Killer; they also play Twenty-Something's, which Is a Nice change. I believe we've All seen enough Teens Bite the Big one lately. I Also Loved how the film takes itself Totally Seriously, that is Good, it is Daring to do that these days as it's Safer to poke a little Fun at the Genre.
The Story involves 5 Beautiful young women getting Stalker by a Serial Killer. The Detective on the case my have a Suspect, but the Girls believe it is a boy that they used to Tease at School. They receive Gruesome Valentines day cards that are Followed by Many Murders, Buckets of Blood, Sexy Stars and Cool Camerawork.
The Performances are Good, as the film Is a Horror film. If the film were a Drama, I wouldn't be so Lenient. Marley Shelton stars as Kate (the Nice one). She basically has to Carry the film and she does an Adequate job. Jessica Capshaw is Dorothy (the Big one); she acts much like Marley, lots of Smiles and Stares. Denise Richards is Paige (the Sexy one); she acts with her Eyebrows and mostly just replays her ""Wild Things"" role. Jessica Cauffiel is Lily (the Funny one), she may be the funny one in ""Road Trip"", she may be the funny one in ""Urban Legends - Final Cut"", but she is Not the funny one here. (Jason is, but I'll get to him later) Lastly, Katherine Heigl plays Shelley (the Smart one), she doesn't get much Screen time, and it is Quite a Shame, as I am quite a Fan of hers.
The Five of them are Very Beautiful and Quite Watch-able; the Guys are Also quite good. David Boreanaz plays Adam, Kate's On-again-Off-again boyfriend. He may not have the Largest Range of Emotions for a Leading man, but... well... He's just Cool. Daniel Cosgrove is Believable as Campbell, Dorothy's Live-in boyfriend who may be a Conman. He is Believable as a Nice guy and Believable as a Conman. The Best Actor award goes to Adam Harrington, he plays Jason, a very Small role, but he makes the Most of it. He may only get about 6 minutes of Screen time, but that is all he needed to make one hell of an Impression on me. He is Hilarious.
Jamie Blanks' Directing is Assured and Effective. He Knows the Genre, he knows where to put the Camera, when to Cut away for Maximum Effects. He is a Natural Born Horror Director. The Death Scenes are Elaborate and Original and no matter How Tired you might be of seeing Slow Killers catching Fast Kids, you will Not be Bored by this film, it Keeps you, and the Characters on your toes.
Overall, ""Valentine"" may be very Similar to many other Stalk-and-Slash flicks, but it Does bring a few new Bits and Pieces to the Genre, as well as being Daring, Fun, Sexy and Scary. The only other Modern Horror film that can Honestly say all that without cracking a smile is ""Scream"".",989280000,14,4275,4.468030690537084
1306457,5,B00003CXUP,This movie was alot better than the recent 90's slahser films. It had a bit of a hitchockian style with the touch of some of the 80's films. And I believe that this film has reawaken the horror genre. For once we have gotten a good horror film that lives up to it processors. I love this film and can't wait for the DVD that will have the 30minute fooage that was taken out of the movie. I give this film an A-,981763200,3,410,3.9518072289156625

1306725,3,B00003CXUP,"I loved this movie as a kid. I watched it for the first time in about 15 years the other night. It definitely did not hold up. The cast is gorgeous (particularly David Boreanaz), and it's interesting to see a pre-Grey's Anatomy and fame Katherine Heigel and Jessica Capshaw, but this is a generally formulaic, by the numbers slasher. That being said, I do still enjoy formulaic, by the numbers slashers on occasion, and David Boreanaz is really really good looking, so I'll probably watch it again at some point. Not any time soon though.",1501113600,,538,4.673684210526316

1306732,5,B00003CXUP,"This was a REALLY fun movie. I do NOT understand all this ""hate"" this film received when it came out. So what- it's ""modern"" it isn't 1981 anymore. Whoever is hating on this film has never seen or appreciated the Italian GIALLO genre of slasher films. ""VALENTINE"" is a perfect hybrid of an Italian giallo and an American slasher film. I can't say much without spoilers but I will say that I took a chance on this on a friend's recommendation, which surprised me, I had always assumed this movie was awful. It certainly looked like it from the TV spots. I WAS WRONG! I really liked this- the characters are deplorable but at least they are fleshed out and the kill scenes are really well done and pretty brutal. It's standard fare in many ways but what a FUN standard it is. ""Valentine"" will certainly be in my annual rotation of holiday horrors from now on.",1487030400,6,857,4.464968152866242
1306733,5,B00003CXUP,"Underrated movie, one of my favorite thrillers. A slasher movie mixed with a who-dun-it? Jeremy Milton, the class nerd, the boy that wore thick bifocal glasses and buckteeth. He likes all the girls but the girls didn't like him. He was always overlooked and picked on because of his lanky body and nerdy appeal.

A box of ghoulish maggots filled chocolates sent by JM? Could it be Jeremy Milton? Dead bodies pile up, could it be Jeremy Milton return from all the hellish pranks back in high school?

1306846,1,B00003CXUP,Terrible,1481414400,,8,8.0
1306847,3,B00003CXUP,"A throwback (or throwaway) nod to slasher flicks of old.  Valentine suffers from too many rewrites from too many writers, casting woes (the original cast was tossed aside for the cast that finally ended up on the screen), and a change in film companies.  When the director later apologized for this work, that alone was not a good sign.

The story is fairly basic: revenge!  But.  Theres far too much reliance on jump scares as opposed to genuine terror.  Theres almost zero suspense as you know at the outset that these women are targeted for gruesome deaths based on the putdowns they used on poor Jeremy Melton during the opening dance sequence/flashback.  Its no surprise when later the accuser becomes the accused.  And.  The restricted number of characters guaranteed a limited body count, mores the pity.

As a slasher flick its a bit on the timid side but its serviceable/entertaining enough in its own right.",1478822400,,917,4.858064516129033

1306852,5,B00003CXUP,"Like other slasher films, Valentine became one of my most favorite horror films to come out in some time. I first saw this film on the Syfi channel back in 2011 ten years after it's release in 2001. I know the film was given a majority of negative review back then but it is still a good movie to me.  I got this on my 15th birthday back in 2013 and I was 2 years old at the time of it's release into theaters. To me it's like a modern day ""My Bloody Valentine"" with the flavor of Hospital Massacre. Overall, Valentine is worth a watch.",1473984000,,536,4.056603773584905
1306853,3,B00003CXUP,I love the movie but I think the sound on the DVD is poor. It gets quiet and loud like someone is turning the volume up and down,1473984000,,128,3.607142857142857

1307004,5,B00003CXUP,"Love this movie! It really gets a bad reputation, but it is kind of a staple for slasher movies of its time. It kind of never gets old for me and maybe that is maybe more about nostalgia rather than actual quality, but either way it's a fun who done it movie that always makes for a good time. It's one of my favorite underrated jems!",1473465600,,334,4.075757575757576
1307005,3,B00003CXUP,"""Valentine"" does it's best to combine the straight slasher thrills of 1980's horror, combined with the who-dunnit slasher thrills of the 90's ""Scream"" era horror, and succeeds for the most part.

In the 1980's at a junior high dance and nerd, Jeremy Melton, is rebuffed by several girls, even framed by Dorothy, the last girl he approaches, as some kind of perv when the two are caught kissing. Flash forward a decade plus, the girls have grown up and are in college (and just about to star in ""Grey's Anatomy"" apparently??) when someone begins sending them creepy Valentines day notes, and begins hunting them down one-by-one.
Has Melton come back for vengeance or is it someone new in the girls' lives?

""Valentine"" has a great cast, almost all of the major cast has gone on to one network television show or another (and then there's the one that married Charlie Sheen?!), and that's the best thing this film has going for it. Unfortunately, the kills are pretty tame, the F/X aren't even as good as what you would see weekly on ""CSI"", and the soundtrack/score is forgettable.

I think the biggest drawback this film has though is it's Southern California setting. I think February when I think of Valentine's Day, I think snow, I think cold...I don't think of palm trees and hot tubs. Seems like if you're going to set a film around the Winter Holiday, and you're hoping to create the same type of feeling Carpenter invoked with his Autumn-set ""Halloween"" or the chilly atmosphere of ""My Bloody Valentine"", they should have moved this film to colder climates.",1471305600,,1563,4.781481481481482

1307114,3,B00003CXUP,"Does a great job with dramatic irony. Enjoyed the red herring at the end. It plays on several tropes in the slasher genre at the time, falls short with a few of them. Would have enjoyed it more if the Final girl was more of an action girl. Couple scenes were cringeworthy, but that was most likely intended with the aforementioned dramatic irony.",1455580800,,346,4.507936507936508
1307115,5,B00003CXUP,"Valentine's Day is one of the most bittersweet days of the years. For couples, it's a time to celebrate their love for each other. For singles, it's a time to either seek love or reminisce on a lack of it. Jeremy Melton would unfortunately be a part of the latter. At a 1988 middle school Valentine's dance, Jeremy Melton, a nerdy, social outcast, seeks out a dance from 4 popular girls he has a crush on: Shelley, Lily, Page, and Kate. He's coldly rejected by Shelley, Page, and Lily, while Kate kindly turns him down.

A mutual, overweight friend of the girls, Dorothy accepts Jeremy's invitation and they both discreetly kiss underneath the bleachers. When a couple of bullies catch them in the act, Dorothy quickly frames Jeremy for sexually assaulting her, leading to Jeremy being humiliated by the bullies in addition to being sent to a reform school. More than a decade later in 2001, the girls--now grown women in their 20s, reunite after one from their clique is brutally murdered while studying for her pre-med final--all upon finding a threatening Valentine's card. Soon after, while on a quest to find love, the rest of the girls all begin receiving similar grisly, threatening Valentine cards as Valentine's Day approaches. Is their former middle school classmate out to seek revenge for their wrongful ways? Perhaps the answers they seek have been slapping them in the face all along

Overall: I've seen a lot of mixed reviews on Valentine and I'll be one of the ones to say that I enjoyed every minute of it. In a way, this is your typical slasher teen/young adult slasher in terms of the plot....somewhat, but one interesting thing to note about it is that the cast of main characters consists of females which was rare as the slasher genre usually consisted of a fair ratio of men and women. Despite the basis for the plot being slightly cliche, the way it plays out throughout the duration of the film is captivating. As the story unfolds, it keeps you watching until the end. And just when you think you have the answers, the film changes things around to get the audience to second guess themselves. The acting in this film is no masterpiece but it's plausible. There aren't a whole lot of sympathetic characters in this film either. Most of the women, aside from 1 or 2 are spiteful and for some reason, just about every guy that appears in the movie is the same. The killings in this movie are kind of unique but there's not a whole lot of red going on. While the movie is rated R, the blood level suits a PG-13 rating. In addition, while there is a sex scene, there are no nude or erotic scenes in this film--so it's not all that much of a typical slasher. There are a few comical scenes here and there, but overall, Valentine maintains a serious and pleasing tone. If slasher horror films are something you enjoy, you may just find yourself enthralled with Valentine",1455408000,,2890,4.631578947368421

Nothing complicated or unrealistic. I liked the fact that the characters are adults, and not high school teens. Besides being a slasher flick, the movie alone is pretty good.

I would watch it all that time. By the time this one came out I was sort of used to how things worked in a horror movie. This one was different. But in a good way. I loved the plot line. This nerdy kid was picked on by girls of a surtin nature and bullied at the Valentine's day dance when he was a kid. Then 13 years later the same girls who are now grown up (plus u wouldn't know who the killer is since he's grown up too obveously) gets killed off one by one by a killer who weres a cupid mask and a butcher knife (director Jamie Blanks clearly states in the commentary for the DVD that the butcher knife used in the film is inpired by Michael Myers from the original 1978 classic film ""Halloween""). They have tried doing slasher flicks soon after this was released but they weren't murderer mystery's. Everything about this movie is classic. I just hate the fact that Warner Bros. and Hollywood decided to shelve any future sequels for this. It clearly had a big oppening at the end for a 2nd. Bottom line if you are a slasher horror movie buff this one (along with ""Scream"" and the first two ""I Know what you Did Last Summer"" films) is the film for you.",1350518400,2,1331,4.142857142857143

Whereas the book was a five star thriller, the movie is just another cheap slasher film with absolutely nothing to redeem it from the crap that it is. I have been disappointed many times by movies made from books I have read, but never on this grand a scale. Tom Savage has written only a handful of books, but they are all edge-of-your-seat thrillers, so I was very excited to hear ""Valentine"" was being made into a movie. And if it had been made properly it would have been good. Instead, a horrible script in the hands of a truly terrible director turned this masterpiece into a shameful mess. I urge everyone who saw this movie and hated it as much as I did to read the book. It is nothing like the movie. In fact I recently reread the book and realized, with the exception of the title, the book is an entirely different story.

1307633,1,B00003CXUP,"So at a Valentine's Day dance in 1988, a nerdy guy named Jeremy Melton keeps asking girls for a dance and they sharply turn him down, however a fifth girl who was a little bigger than the previous girls agrees and they end up making out under the bleachers. When some bullies happen by, this girl claims he attacker her so they beat him up and rip off his clothes, so now in 2001 all the girls who rejected him and the one who got him beat up are in their 20's and with Valentine's Day fast approaching are trying to get their lives going.

One of these girls ends up dead after a bad date, the killer wears a cherub like mask and even gave her a warning that something would happen to her when he sent her a valentine's card death threat. So the remaining girls keep wondering who is the killer and who is next, which is fairly cliche and would normally work if not for the bad pacing, lack of suspense and even a lack of interest in who the killer is.

Actually its fairly obvious who it is and the ending is quite funny (which I imagine is not what the film makers intended), the death scenes aren't really inventive and its a pretty bad story.

1307636,4,B00003CXUP,"In my quest to absorb every slasher movie in the realm of cinema, I finally had the opportunity to watch ""Valentine"" last night. Which was of course was Valentine's Day Eve.  Made in 2001, the only thing I knew about it was David Boreanaz starred in it and that the movie was panned.  Nevertheless, I allowed myself to be accosted by cupid and watched this by the numbers horror flick.

The movie opens in 1988 at a middle school dance (man do I remember those) and we find little Jeremy Melton asking a variety of girls if they would dance with him.  It should be noted that Jeremy is a bit of a nerd.  Therefore it isn't too surprising that all of the girls shoot him down in a manner that is very cruel. So Jeremy ends up being humiliated in front of his peers.

Fast forward 13 years later and all the girls, rather women, who tortured Jeremy all those years ago, are being stalked.  They aren't sure who is stalking them, but whoever he/she is their goal is kill each one of these girls.  Donned in black and wearing a cupid mask, this homicidal maniac is the perfect symbol of anti-love.  Is the killer Jeremy or is there someone else shooting deadly bow and arrows? As with many slasher movies, the plot is rather simple, but that is okay.

I am not sure why this movie was received so negatively.  I found the kills to be rather creative and some of the scenes were creepy. The movie truly followed the ""slasher"" formula with the usually gallery of characters and personalities.  The movie was both predictable and surprising.  The acting was average for this type of movie.  Notwithstanding, I have yet to watch a slasher movie that is renowned for the performance of its actors and actresses.

David Boreanaz know for playing on the  TV shows ""Angel"", ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and ""Bones"" did a good job.  I mean nothing to get excited about but good nevertheless.  Denise Richards did a wonderful job being the sultry, stuck up, and been around the block vixen.  Marley Shelton and Jessica Capshaw also did a decent job in their performance.  It was also interesting to see a much younger Katherine Heigl in this movie, way before ""Grey's Anatomy"" and her mainstream success.  Heigl had more curves in this movie than she does today; I found this very refreshing as well as her performance. However if she ever wins an Academy Award I doubt this movie will be a career highlight.

I found this movie to be really enjoyable, maybe it has aged well or I have watched so many damn slasher movies that I just put my brain on cruise control.  The soundtrack is also pretty suitable for this film. I have seen worse (horror) films than this one and am glad that there is a horror movie that I can now watch every Valentine's Day.",1329177600,3,2736,4.493927125506073

1307740,3,B00003CXUP,"Sitting down to ramble off a few thoughts on this rather generic piece of teen slasher fun, I'm reminded of a review my friendly neighborhood twin posted not too long ago.

RIPPED IT A NEW ONE!

Now, I don't hate this film that much.  It does what it sets out to do.  I mean, what else do you expect from a film that draws any and all inspiration from `Scream'?  I think the problem with these films is that they bring absolutely nothing new to the table outside of fresh bodies.  The plots always revolve around a woman and revenge being sought out against her by a scorn man (or woman).  All her friends are picked off one by one instead of the killer just going to her house and doing her in.  Instead, everyone around her has to suffer first.

This film twists that a little bit (as in they were all kind of punishable) but you get my drift.

The deaths here are pretty cool, and the ending culminates in a nice fright fest, but overall this film is a tad bland and predictable.  I will never complain about looking at Denise Richards (unless you're putting a colon after her name) and so I'm happy she was in this.  My wife is happy that David Boreanaz is in this.

I guess we are both happy.

Sort of.

The logic behind this film is kind of illuminated in the sites personal review.  A group of women get death threats in valentines and decide to throw a party, despite the recent deaths of some friends.  It's all kind of comical, but these films are never really supposed to be realistic.  They are just supposed to be scary.  This film handles that to a degree, and it has some intriguing death sequences (why are we so fascinated with stylized murders?) to keep us `entertained'.

Don't seek it out, but if it comes on cable and you are bored then by all means dig in.",1275436800,2,1778,4.282282282282282
1307741,5,B00003CXUP,"It's moody and atmospheric, and avoids 8 ot 9 of the 100 serial killer movie cliches, so I give it four stars.  I found the Cupid cherub mask sort of scary, though the bloody nose that the killer sprouted seemed like--DNA?  It's a little bit like SCREAM in that the best known cast member gets bumped off first--only at the time of release, VALENTINE's first victim wasn't anywhere near as well known as she is today, so what does that say about the movie's originality?  Not much I guess.  The victim in question has red Lindsay Lohan hair, and weighs about 25 pounds more than she does today in the age of her superstardom.

The main story in the movie revolves around Marley Shelton and her inability to trust her boyfriend who drinks too much.  I think that the movie's writers probably had some personal experience of the 12 step kind, because no matter how much product David B. puts onto his hair, you just can't trust him to stay on the wagon.  The movie is set in San Francisco and I will watch any set-in-San-Francisco, filmed in Vancouver movie two or three times, and this one really holds up.  Not because of Marley Shelton's acting--she is uncharacteristically terrible here, perhaps uncomfortable in having to play a girl with an unpleasant past.  All of these I Know What You Did Last Summer movies, where now grown adults suffer for an act of cruelty they committed while teenagers, have the same ambivalence towards repentance and retribution.  Not once do any of the girls admit they did anything wrong to Jeremy Melton.  Pity that.  It might have made all the difference in the world, and prevented wealthy Dorothy's Valentine's party from becoming a bloodbath.

My favorite character is Kate's crazy neighbor down the hall who speaks only in rhymes to her, ""Want a date, Kate?  I think you're great, Kate.""  The scene where we find out what this guy, dressed in his underwear, *really* wants from Kate is the only scene that reminded me of actual life in San Francisco.  They should have thrown the rest of the film away and just started building on that one scene.",1249603200,2,2086,4.658469945355192
1307742,5,B00003CXUP,"I have always liked ""Valentine"", an interesting slasher film from 2001 that was not a boxoffice hit. The film has also not been very popular in recent years and fans have pretty much forgot about it. Still, ""Valentine stands out as a good popcorn scary film that is a great whodunit movie.
 ""Valentine"" is about a bunch of people being killed around Valentine's Day and as the audience it is up to us to figure out who the culprit is. Most of the victims are untalented actresses so it's a joy to see some of the caracters being dispatched. It's obvious from the beginning of the movie that the killer, as a young child, was teased by his peers, and now as an adult is seeking revenge on those who tormented him.
 David Boreanaz, from TV's ""Bones"", steals the film with his great looks and good acting. The only other good actor in ""Valentine"" is Denise Richards. The rest of the cast is pretty much unforgettable.
 The DVD comes with audio commentary by the director Jamie Blanks, there are cast interviews, and more. The film is in widescreen and is single layered. Subtitles are in english and french.

1307743,1,B00003CXUP,"Another dull entry in the slasher film genre. This one has a decent cast, but little else. This film's only saving grace is the ending even if it's a bit predictable. My biggest problem with this film is that we've seen it all before and done better. You don't have to look to closely to see the obvious similarities to 'Halloween' and many other superior films.",1242432000,,362,4.5
1307744,3,B00003CXUP,"This isn't as horrible a movie as some people would like you to believe, but on the other hand, it's not particularly ""scary"" for a horror film, and once you see it a second time, you see all the clues that are dropped right in your lap.  This is one of those films that deliberately doesn't set itself up for a sequel, as everyone dies in the end (more or less).  It follows the silent, masked killer gimmick, which is fine, as no one wants someone wisecracking while he's trying to kill you, because only certain actors can pull it off.

Speaking of actors, let's talk about the cast.  The cast is entirely composed of hot young stars that clearly are cast to attempt to appeal to the younger audience.  So, in theory, with the star power that this film was able to attract, this should be a terrific movie (and really, it isn't a horrible movie in the slightest, and not nearly as cliched as people would lead you to believe, either.  However, the problem is that Hollywood loves to cast ""pretty people"" in TV and movies, and this film is no exception from Beverly Hills 90210's Daniel Cosgrove to Rosewell's Katherine Heigl to always reliable Denise Richards to popular attractive star Marley Shelton to Buffy the Vampire Slayer's David Boreanaz.

The problem?  Pretty people are nice to look at in the looks-obsessed movie business, but not all of them can act.  David Boreanaz is great as Angel because the role requires him to be wooden.  That's the biggest letdown of this film, as it seems obvious that Mr. Boreanaz was hired to basically be Angel in a different film.  Hopefully, he wasn't told by the director to be stiff.  He shows so much more personality as evil Angelus on Buffy than any other time.

The other actresses are fine, but Katherine Heigl is wasted in her too-short part that was only about 20 minutes long.  It is said she had commitments to Roswell, so she could only afford to film for a few days.  Her part could have been edited out and it wouldn't hurt the movie one way or the other.

If you're the kind who likes to play whodunnit, you'll figure it out soon enough.  The film does drop some red herrings to attempt to throw you off track, but the few false clues it does leave are kind of obvious in the fact that they are fake.  At about death #2, you'll start putting together the pieces, so really, that was the worst death, since that was the one that was the most obvious tip-off to the killer's identity.  Really, if you pay attention, you'll figure out the killer before you're halfway through.  The deaths also follow a certain trend, set up at the beginning of the film, so pay attention.

The film does leave a little mystery at the end, but the mystery that is set up isn't the mystery that people want to know.  The mystery that the film attempts to set up kind of falls on its face.

That said, some of the deaths are really kind of creative and a lot of fun, really.  Perhaps some people, having grown up on Jason and Freddy and that sort of thing, with tons of gore, won't like it.  On the other hand, while not as cerebral as Psycho, the killer is grounded in reality and doesn't magically manifest his weapons, it's all there if you look for it.

Not a lot of gore, but there ARE some fairly violent deaths.  It doesn't follow the typical formula of psycho killer kills everyone because he can, this is a killer who is a definite sociopath, and has a very specific target for his wrath.  He does deviate a slight bit, but it's necessary to make sure no one can identify him.

For the ladies, there's hunks like Boreanaz and Cosgrove, and for the men there's all the lovely ladies, especially Richards in her bikini in the hot tub (and the pseudo sex-scene before it, which is actually kind of funny, unless you're a guy!) and Marley Shelton wearing a terry-cloth towel.

Overall, a fun movie.  Definitely a film to watch with your significant other (to comfort her during the scary parts)!",1240617600,,3941,4.462290502793296

1307748,5,B00003CXUP,"This review is really like a companion piece to Daniel Jolley's Amazon review of October 12, 2002.  He has already expressed everything I could about this movie in the best possible way.  So many have panned it which is why I found Daniel's review to be so refreshing, and it inspired me to chime in my own two cents and up the review average in favor of this highly entertaining and very fun horror movie.

Some have said that ""Scream"" reignited the slasher genre in the mid '90s but I have never been a big fan of that one as it is to me almost like a play or satire on the familiar slasher movie formulas rather than a bona fide slasher itself.  ""Valentine"" director Jamie Blanks however, clearly a die hard slasher fan just like I and perhaps you are if you're reading this, seems to realize that those same familiar formulas that ""Scream"" pokes fun at are formulas that work, and have made for some great entertainment since the late '70s and early '80s when the slasher wave first broke.  Blanks even admits in the director's commentary track of the DVD that ""Valentine's"" plot is not the most original but boy does this one ever deliver.

And just what is that plot.  It concerns revenge for cruel taunting in junior high school, with each of the young women involved years later receiving warped Valentine's greetings from the unknown perpetrator, who proceeds to stalk and pick them off one by one.

And how beautiful each of those women have grown to be!  To echo what Daniel said in his review, from the male perspective ""Valentine"" is a delight to behold.  You get the brief early appearance by Katherine Heigl, who looks awesome and fetching as a med student in a tank top; Marley Shelton, a stunning blonde who plays nice girl Kate, and Denise Richards, who sizzles as the not so nice Paige.  Oh yeah, and for the female contingent, I'm told that David Boreanaz (as Kate's mysterious alcoholic-leaning boyfriend) is not unpleasant on the eyes.  True, as compared to the early '80s, in these slightly more enlightened and dare I say ""politically correct"" times, there is no out and out nudity in ""Valentine"" but as Daniel stated, the sultry bedroom bondage scene and Denise Richards in the hot tub scene to me more than make up for it.

But at the heart of it, ""Valentine"" succeeds in large part because of its sense of fun and that it presents hip humor (like the bit on the perils of speed dating) in place of the usual stomach-churning gore.  In the spirit of my favorite slashers, it does not take itself at all seriously and is played mainly for fun.

That's not to say there is no gore or sleaze to behold here; it is a slasher movie after all.  Blanks directs the film very stylishly and presents the perfect update on the classic slasher template for a new generation.  The killer wears a very cool cherub mask and the stalk and slash scenes are great and very inventive and quite suspenseful.  While the premise may not be too original (which again, Blanks readily admits), to echo the proverbial saying, if it ain't broke, why fix it?

I love slasher movies and for all the reasons stated here and in Daniel's earlier review ""Valentine"" is a new classic for a new generation that stands up with the best slashers of the past.",1207440000,8,3248,4.549828178694158

Denise Richards (Starship Troopers, Wild Things) and co. are all knockouts, even while being knocked off!

The body count is high and the death scenes are immaginative.  The actors/actresses are gorgeous, the settings are beautiful, the musical score rocks, and the action is well paced.  However, I strongly suspected who the killer was early into the movie because of a lack of surviving male characters.  Therefore, it succeeds as a Jason-type slasher (the killer wears a Kewpie doll mask in lieu of a hockey mask) but fails as a mystery thriller/giallo.  ""Valentine"" tried hard to have a ""twist"" ending but never succeeded because the viewer knows the killer has to be male due to their nose bleeding everytime they kill.

1307899,1,B00003CXUP,"Wow,this movie is quite possibly one of the most uninteresting slasher movies in years. At no time does this create even a small amount of suspense. The actors appear to be uninterested in the movie and look almost ashamed to be in the film.
  After the tired cliched opening of a young picked on boy being beat and humiliated at a school dance we flash forward 13 years and find that he is now looking to get even with the girls who rejected him. The fact that the girls are made to look like horrible mean spirted witches almost has you cheering for their demise. The final revelation of who the killer is is a big let down and raises questions as to how he was able to commit some of the murders.

It's not original by any means, but it makes the regurgitated scare tactics it uses seem somewhat fresh and with a cast as beautiful as this one your willing for forgive the many mistakes.  The film follows a group of friends as they try and decide who is trying to kill them.  These girls were all horridly mean to a boy in school and it appears that he has come back on Valentines day to exact his revenge.  As the body count rises their fear grows stronger, and with a large Valentine bash on the way things start to escelate rappidly.  It's far from perfect but it's far from dull and that counts for a lot.  It's a nice deversion from the mundane and serves up some decent scares, some hot bodies and some bloody aftermaths (if your into that kinda thing, and judging on the fact your interested in this type of film tells me you are).

1307902,5,B00003CXUP,"Valentine is a great slasher-style flick done in the same style as Scream and those type of movies that dominated this genre for a while. And it's a fun movie too. 5 girl friends become the target for a killer cloaked in all black and a cherub mask. This is my favorite movie to watch for Valentine's Day. Denise Richards as Paige is my favorite of the characters. She's funny and sexy and does a great job with the part. I also liked that Marley Shelton's character, Kate, had excellent delivery with some of her typical dumb-blonde lines. The movie has plenty of funny parts to it, like the speed dating, Kate's scary neighbor, and the scene at the party with Paige and Brian to name a few. It also has interesting little elements woven throughout, like a touch of red in an otherwise drab room. The sets and costumes all convey this (if you don't believe me, just watch for Ruthie's sweater at the party...it's red) and that's really interesting to see. I've seen this movie no less than 20 times and I just love it. It certainly delivers the goods, but of course I've seen much scarier movies than this. It's just fun and not meant to be taken too seriously, much like the Scream trilogy. I also love to hate Daniel Cosgrove in this, as per my tradition of hating him since Beverly Hills, 90210 (most of you, however, will probably remember him best as the jerky frat guy who was the boyfriend of Ryan Reynolds' love interest, Tara Reid, in Van Wilder). He just does a great job playing jerk characters...it's like he's in his element. One thing that is quite shocking to me though is this sticker price. I paid $6 for this DVD 2 years ago and I have no idea why Amazon has it priced so highly now. I do truly adore Valentine and I highly recommend it to those that enjoy movies of this sort, however I also recommend that you look for a better price on it and then it will be a very, VERY worthy addition to your DVD collection.

Cast:  Denise Richards, David Broeanaz, Marley Shelton, Jessica Capshaw, Jessica Cauffiel, Katherine Heigl, Hedy Burress, Fulvio Cecere.

Running Time:  96 minutes

Rated R for strong horror violence, some sexuality and language.

""Valentine"", the over-slasherized version of the excellent Tom Savage suspense novel, starts with a pre-teen valentine disco set in 1988. A bespectacled young boy heads on the dance floor looking for a young female to share a dance with. First he approaches Shelly (later played by Katherine Heigl) who embarrassingly rebuffs him. His charm doesn't seem to work with Lilly (Jessica Cauffer), Paige (Denise Richards) or Kate (Marley Shelton) either; they all send him packing quite arrogantly. His luck changes when Dorothy (Jessica Capshaw) actually acknowledges him and the twosome leave hand in hand. They are later caught kissing under a bench by a gang of bullies. In order to save her own self from persecution, Dorothy accuses the youngsters of attacking her and so the gang decides to take their own revenge. They cover him in red gooey stuff (""Carrie"" anyone?), strip him, and chase him onto the dance floor where they proceed to beat him up.  Fast forward ten years and the girls are now women; no one is sure what happened to Jeremy (the bullied brat from earlier) as he disappeared after that dance. It's close to Valentine's Day (of course) and they each receive a card signed with a poetic threat to their lives. They soon realize to take them seriously when Shelly is found with her throat sliced. Before long a mysterious masked madman stalks each of them leaving Kate and her boyfriend Adam (David Boreanaz) to work out that she's next on the psycho's list.

The acting is standard horror fare. Denise Richards once again shows us her amazing and wide-range acting talents: Those two large things attached to the front side of her body that we like to call ""breasts."" David Boreanaz gives a fair performance, but definitely shouldn't give up his day job on the WB's ""Angel."" Newcomer Marley Shelton can't do much with her underwritten role, and she comes off as extremely annoying and whiny for the most part. The rest of the acting is close to pitiful. Another problem with Valentine is that the characters are all so self indulgent and morally extracted that it's almost impossibility for them to win over the audience. In the beginning they're shown as mockers to any child that's unfortunate enough to be less pretty than their egotistical selves and actually possess a brain. This discrimination continues throughout the movie as they brush off the men who are trying to woo them out on a date, simply because they're not up to their high standards. How can anyone want such pompously arrogant characters to survive? In a typical slasher movie, the `final girl' is usually the shy reclusive type that the audience feels sympathetic towards, like Laurie Strode. These characters have no such power, leading you to believe that the world would be a better place without them anyway.  Director Jamie Banks (""Urban Legend"") has proved that he has the potential to become a fair filmmaker; however this is his first feature failure. It's a shame that he couldn't have made more of the talented cast and competent budget, but in the end, Valentine just feels empty. A couple of talented cast members are not really enough to warrant the many obnoxious ones. Cupid certainly missed when he fired the arrow of fortune at this heart.  This one's destined to escape our memories in the not-too-distant future.",1138492800,3,3576,4.97319932998325
1307904,3,B00003CXUP,"While not quite a landmark original, Jamie Blanks ""VALENTINE"" is still a very solid & underrated slasher flick with a bit more substance & a better ending then most from the mainstream flock of 'SCREAM' clone flops such as 'Urban Legend''I Know What You Did Last Summer' or every sequel & threequel that they can sqeeze out of the bubble-gum machine. There is nothing new or original about this film but what makes it better then the other 'SCREAM' clones is the some what old-school 80's vibe that comes from a mix between a good Director,the very spooky masked killer(Cupid) & a guessing game with a great pace that actually keeps you on your toes guessing till the very tippity top of the end.",1137283200,3,696,4.620967741935484

But Valentine looked like it would be good and it was actually until the ending.

The pretty boy being the killer again is just played out.  Scream was good everything else is just redundant.  Imagine if the geeky boy who was attacked by the bullies actually got burned or his face was horribly deformed in a fall or something like that.  He goes to the mental institution and years later he escapes or is released into society, but escaped is much better.  This masked figure then chases down the mean kids and kills them one by one, then the climax when we see his face it shows the reason he is so angry and deranged.

I give it 2 stars because it could have been so good and I can always pretend the ending was good.",1136678400,,917,4.3274853801169595

1308023,5,B00003CXUP,"This movie is about a boy who gets badly insulted at a school dance in Junior High he ended up getting beaten up by a bunch of macho boys and all the popular girls who asked him to dance are all forgiven and there isn't any consequences.

Many years later they all become succesfull people struggling with work and relationships. When one of the friends turns up murdered at the hospital where she works they start to think that the boy that they insulted as come back to get them. They don't remember what happened to him and have no idea to what he looks like. Denise Richards, Marley Shelton, Jessica Cauffell, Jessica Caupshaw, David Boreanaz, and Katherine Heigl star in this terrifying movie. The good thing is you get to see Denise Richards character Paige Prescott in a bikini. Soon the killer starts attacking all of the girls in a mask in bizarre places. For example in a jacuzzi at the spa, in a morgue while doing an autopsy, in an art gallery when taking a quick break. The deaths are pretty vile and brutal there is lots and lots of blood spilled everywhere you can tell this movie was filmed very quickly and rushed into release. The attack of the killer is very predictable and there is only one twist at the end when Marley Sheltons character finds out that her boyfriend Played by David Boreanaz was the one who was behind all the masked killings even though she was friends with them he let her live because she didn't hurt his feelings at the dance. Denise Richards character bites the dust hard i believe its after the art show when she goes to take a bath in the jacuzzi the killer attacks her with a nail gun and tries to suffocate her she shows a lot of ressistance to the killings but he still shows no mercy the nail goes right into her shoulder and then finally the kille throws the gun into the water which electrocutes her. It was very scary. But the movie itself isn't scary it wasn't as bad as Urban Legends: Final Cut or I still know what you did last summer. It was still a very good movie over all. This is not a movie to watch on Valentines day its a movie to watch around Halloween and isn't really meant for kids below 14. This is a teen slasher flick but it is indeed violent and it can easily scare people. Parents trust the R rating on the back and don't let them watch it. Its mainly for adults to laugh over. The weird thing is that Denise Richards was listed first on the credit line up and she was 3rd to last to get killed. It was bizarre. But still this movie was really good and not really scary it was like a freaky show",1132531200,,2568,4.294845360824742
1308024,2,B00003CXUP,"This is probably one of my least favorite horror films ever. What really makes it bad is that it could've very easily been a modern horror classic if there had been just a few changes because this movie really had some good stuff in it but the good just didn't outweigh the bad.

PLOT:

The plot is simple enough. It revolves around a group of five women who have been friends since middle school. At a sixth grade valentine's dance they were particularly mean to a nerdy kid named Jeremy Melton. One of the friends who used to be fat got caught of guys making out with him and she says that he attacked her to avoid embarassment. The boys that caught them then pour something on him and rip his clothes off down to his underwear and beat him up. Well years later the group of friends start receiving threatening Valentine's cards in the mail and are then routinely picked off one by one.

CAST:

Denise Richards(Paige Prescott): Richards is credited first but she isn't the main star of the movie. She is okay for what her role requires but brings nothing spectacular to her performance. She plays the sexy kinda slutty one of the group.

David Boreanaz(Adam Carr): Boreanaz is easily the best thing about this movie. I have never really watched any of the tv shows he was in but I can see him having a future in movies especially in roles like this. From little I have saw of him on tv I thought his performance would sort of wooden but he was actually charasmatic and brooding all at the same time. He plays Kate's recovering alcoholic boyfriend who isn't above suspicion.

Marley Shelton(Kate Davies): Davies is just good enough in her part for me to mention her. She doesn't really bring anything to her performance but she is cute enough to bring a little sympathy to her performance

Adam Harrington(Jason Marquette): I've got to give this guy an honorable mention. He is only in the movie for a few minutes but is memorable which is less than I can say about the rest of the cast except Boreanaz.

PROS AND CONS

I din't really hate this movie but the reason it just doesn't is because I saw trace of a good horror flick but some things just were not right about it. 1. The acting. I know, I know I shouldn't expect brillant acting from a movie like this but I have seen good acting in horror films before and if this had had better actors it would've been a lot better. 2. One of the characters, I'm not saying who, is only in the movie to throw the viewer off. Those who have seen it know who I'm talking about. 3. One of the girls has on the killer's outfit but is not the killer. I don't know why she has it on but it is a BIG plot hole that really makes this movie go from bad to worse.

4. Something I think they should've done is made more main guy characters that way there would be more suspects because most of the guys in the movie aren't in it long enough and aren't important enough to really be considered a suspect.

There were some good things about this film though. Most notably the killer. The whole nose bleeding thing and that mask were REALLY creepy and the ending and I'm talking about the very last scene is effective and gets under your skin.

FINAL WORD:

Even I gave this film a bad rating I still recommend it but with caution. If you can stand a few plot holes and some pretty bad acting then you might really enjoy this film because it did have a few positives.",1128556800,,3399,4.333858267716535

1308026,2,B00003CXUP,"While there has indeed been a long line of teen slasher movies, they have tended, over the years (with the notable exception of some good scares in the Scream series) to be predictable and formulaic.  Well, Valentine is no different; however, I do have to give better than average marks to the acting in this one, and the deaths in this film are perhaps a bit more creative and interesting than in the usual movie of this genre.  The storyline does indeed keep you guessing until the end, which is rare these days.  This one won't be on anyone's Top 20 horror films list, but it is fun, watchable, and worth a rental.

Just by way of background, and while other reviewers seems to prefer to reveal much of the story and plot, I think that sort of ruins the film in many cases. So, you'll want to look for other reviews and reviewers if that is what you are looking for...",1125964800,,871,4.3580246913580245
1308027,3,B00003CXUP,"The history of the slasher film constitutes one of the most intriguing yet ultimately disappointing evolutions in all of filmdom. Forget about the development of the noir film, or the romantic drama, or the all important war flick. You need go no further than the good old-fashioned hack and slash film to witness the intellectual bankruptcy of Hollywood and its affiliates. At one time what would become the slasher film was an inventive area of moviemaking, allowing directors and writers wide latitude in coming up with original themes drenched in the red stuff. How about reinforcing a conservative message--such as telling kids not to drink, smoke, or engage in pre-nuptial contact--with a machete buried in a forehead? ""Friday the 13th"" developed this theme so well that it soon became a much beloved joke picked up by the late 1990s satires of the slasher genre. The best era for the slasher film, outside of the late '90s resurgence that still reverberates today, was the early 1980s. Ahhh, the good old days of ""My Bloody Valentine"" and ""Happy Birthday to Me""! I miss 'em, but at least DVD is resuscitating all the good stuff.

Sadly, DVD also brings us recent misfires like ""Valentine."" A slasher flick in spirit if not in effectiveness, here's a movie that exemplifies all that is wrong with today's mainstream efforts in the genre. Bring together a bunch of hot young chicks in tight clothes for a series of relatively bloodless encounters with a masked killer, throw in a holiday theme, and sit back and watch the bucks roll in. Well, not exactly. ""Valentine"" bombed at the box office and, if other reviewers' opinions are any indication, continues to bomb on DVD. The storyline is fairly easy to follow, at least initially. Five busty babes--Paige (Denise Richards), Kate (Marley Shelton), Dorothy (Jessica Capshaw), Lily (Jessica Cauffiel), and Shelley (Katherine Heigl)--die horribly at the hands of a nut whose nose bleeds after he offs his victims with a series of sharp objects, all while wearing a cheesy looking cupid mask. Shelley is the first one to go when she runs into the evil one at medical school. After her funeral, her friends come together in an attempt to figure out what happened. One of the girls' boyfriends, the alcoholic Adam (David Boreanz), shows up intermittently to provide us one of his patented megawatt smiles. He also serves to provide the audience with yet another possible suspect.

The film begins by showing us a troubling incident that most likely led to the current killings, a dance during the girls' childhoods that resulted in a rather embarrassing series of events for Dorothy and a nerdy looking kid named Jeremy Melton. The resulting confrontation obviously gave someone a serious complex that must find bloody retribution years later. Melton seems suspicious, especially when the girls discover that his life after this incident consisted of a series of stays at state run facilities. Too, the arrival of grim messages to future victims signed ""J.M."" also seem to point to this troubled young man as the killer. Even as the girls try to tie the murders to Mr. Melton, their numbers drop as the killer relentlessly goes about his bloody work. Things aren't quite as they seem in ""Valentine"" as director Jamie Blanks goes for a film that resembles more closely a Dario Argento giallo than Wes Craven's ""Scream."" Alas, the twisty and turny series of events leading to the eventual unmasking of the real killer is often sabotaged by a cardboard cutout cast, pedestrian pacing, and uninspired kills that bore with their lack of sauce. Arrows in the chest? Death via hot tub? I've got one word to describe ""Valentine"": YAWN!

What happened here? A gorgeous cast mixed with giallo elements should have worked like a charm. The biggest problem is Blanks's insistence on crafting an Argento thriller without over the top gore (scenes were cut, apparently, and the movie suffers for it). One thing you almost always get with Dario Argento is cringe-inducing gore, and ""Valentine"" just can't match up. It's probably got something to do with those nasty old hags over at the MPAA, who won't hesitate to slap an NC-17 rating on a film with Argento level violence. Thus we have a gore lite movie that must rely on Argento's other contribution to the horror genre: the twist ending. At least ""Valentine"" does do a good job of keeping us guessing as to who is responsible for killing these young ladies. But you'll need to stop laughing long enough to appreciate the conclusion, and that's a mighty difficult thing to accomplish. The giggles start during the opening flashback sequence when we notice that the younger versions of the film's stars sport the exact same haircuts as their older versions. Wow! I guess the filmmakers think we're too stupid to realize these are supposed to be the same people! Then there's Jessica Capshaw's (yep, Kate's kid) performance. What's up with the clinched teeth, Jess? At first, I thought she'd sat on a corncob. Then I thought she had lockjaw. Then I realized she's just a bad actress. Loosen up, girl!

Yep, ""Valentine"" delivers more in the way of laughs than shocks. It's worth watching, I suppose, for fans of Denise Richards (who plays wicked and catty here quite well), but most other viewers will spend far more time looking at their watch than the movie. A film that would have worked far better had the director ramped up the gore level, or at least insisted on releasing an uncut version of the movie on DVD, ""Valentine"" as it stands doesn't get more than three stars from me. Oh yeah, I almost forgot: not one of these lovely ladies goes about in her birthday suit. What's up with that! A crime, I say, a crime!",1120867200,,5705,4.866255144032922
1308028,2,B00003CXUP,"Come on guys, why use your acting talent on an average script like this one?

David Boreanaz basically transplanted his Angel good-guy persona onto this movie. We never see him being bad. He is capable of much more complex work, as he showed several times in the Angel TV series.

The same can be said of Denise Richards. She is beautiful, and she plays the vixen well, but the complexity is beneath her talent.

The script is average, and the premise is tired. I know you moviemakers and team all have to earn a living, but we live for your work, so don't disappoint us so!",1117238400,,574,4.39622641509434

Then he comes back 13 years later with an intricate revenge plot and kills off the girls who turned him down 1 by 1.  But in my opinion, the guy who is supposed to be the ugly loser at the beginning of the movie is really hot, the hottest guy in the movie.",1115683200,2,529,4.038095238095238
1308030,2,B00003CXUP,"Jamie Blanks is a fan of slasher films and was trying to pay homage to people like Carpenter and Craven with this film.  But it just goes to show you that just because you toss in a few name actors it doesn't guarantee that you'll have a good movie.  The film is technically sound and looks pretty good, but it's filled with all the overdone slasher cliche's, is ridiculously predictable, and rather dull.

As the story goes a nerdy 6th grader is laughed at by all the girls in his class.  He's unjustly sent to reform school and we cut ahead 10 years where presumably the killer is back for his revenge on all those that wronged him.  Whooppeee!  I got laughed at by plenty of girls in the 6th grade.  What boy didn't?  Didn't send us off on a murder spree.  Well two of the girls are murdered after receiving death threats in their Valentines cards (cool)and the rest throw a Valentine's party.  Great idea right?  Get all the targets together in one place.  So much easier to kill all of them, all the while wearing an oh so cute cupid mask.

Denise Richards is along as the ubiquitous horror film eye-candy but don't get too excited.  There's nothing to be seen here on the part of any of the women and one wonders just what the ""R"" rating was for.  She does die a fairly neat death though.  I liked David Boreanaz as Angel but he's essentially playing the same, stone-faced, single-expressioned pretty boy here as he did in Angel.  It would have been nice to see a little depth.

Technically the film looks good.  It's filmed well and they try to throw a lot of red herrings at you to disguise the killer's identity but if you're a slasher film vet you probably won't have too much trouble figuring it out very early on.  Valentine is not entirely horrible, but it's so unoriginal that you'll be sure you've seen it a dozen times already.",1113436800,,1843,4.41246290801187

1308209,3,B00003CXUP,"This seemed 'appropriate' to watch on Valentine's. I keep getting told it's 'appropriate' to watch certain movies at certain times. The only movie I've ever tried that with (apart from Christmas movies), is Sweet November, which is the perfect movie to watch in November. This seemed appropriate to watch alone (gimme some sympathy please) on Valentine's night.

During the first few minutes, it very obviously steals ideas from a few other movies: the Halloween-style score at the beginning; a guy getting a red liquid thrown over him, similar to the infamous pigs blood scene from Carrie and the young guy's character being called Jason. There are also quite a few, probably unintentional, references to other teenie movies, particularly Scream.

I am not the biggest fan of Denise Richards, as her eyebrows are a little overpowering, and definitely need plucked. Plus, she's too perfect - hopefully not anymore, considering at the time of writing, she has one kid, and another on the way! The rest of the characters were your stereotypical teen slasher cast: the fat girl, who's now thin; all the girls wear tight revealing tops, with everything pushed up around their necks; and the guys look suitably easy on the eye.

However, the movie left you guessing right to the very end, and ends in such a way, that you're still looking confused as to who the killer really was when the credits are rolling. Everyone is thrown in the frame at one point, as it is with all slasher flicks. You're wondering at the end, how some people ended up being there though.

In one scene, Kat tells Dorothy that her boyfriend, Adam Carr (David Boreanaz), is 'no angel'. This is, of course, referring to Boreanaz's hit TV series, ""Angel"".

The movie looks glossy enough, however it was filmed in only 42 days. David Boreanaz shot his entire character role in less than two weeks. Katherine Heigl had only 3 days to shoot her scenes. She was already committed to TV's ""Roswell"". And at a cost of $10 million this is the cheapest film to ever have a Superbowl spot.

Jessica Cauffiel's character Lily is set to go to Los Angeles the day after she's killed. In Urban Legends Final Cut (done by the same director?), Cauffiel's character is also set to go to Los Angeles the day after she's killed.

The order in which Jeremy asks the girls to dance is also the order in which they die. The girls' responses to Jeremy's asking them to dance foreshadows their fates. Lily acts disgusted when asked to dance, and is later disgusted when she bites into a chocolate with maggots inside. Paige says she'd rather be boiled alive, and is electrocuted in a hot tub. Dorothy ends up blaming Jeremy for her actions, and Jeremy/Adam later frames her for the murders.

This is an instantly forgettable movie, apart from Denise Richards' (Paige) scene in the hot tub. I will not be setting foot anywhere near a hot tub after watching that. Not that I ever would, but you never know when it might arise. It's your typical teen slasher flick, with no surprises, and a subtle twist at the end. Not mind-blowing, but not falling in the god-awful category either.",1108425600,16,3124,4.750922509225092
1308210,3,B00003CXUP,"""Valentine"" was pretty much the last film made during the ""Scream"" revived, self-aware, slasher genre era, and also a movie that single-handedly put the nail in the coffin of the four year trend. Too bad though, as it is much better than other ""Scream"" rip-offs like ""I (Still) Know What You Did Last Summer"" and ""Urban Legend."" Australian director Jamie Blanks (who also directed the latter movie) has a little more style and flare than the average slasher director, and he injects his film with enough subtle nods to more inspirational and original pieces, without being over-the-top ironic (something that was consistent in the genre). ""Valentine"" isn't rocket science. I knew who the killer was before the movie was over, and all of the red-herrings presented were too phony and obvious to fall for. The story revolves around a group of young, successful and bratty women, childhood friends who find themselves being haunted by an event that took place at a junior high dance years ago. Seems there was this nerdy kid that kept hitting on all of the girls, and in turn was viciously humiliated in front of the whole school (all this in the opening sequence, one of the best parts). This angle of the story was probably the most interesting, and oddly enough, it wasn't explored much. Oh well, seems the little nerd grew up to be a bit psycho and is now stalking each of the girls with disgusting, and clever, valentine gifts (these gifts often include bodily harm). It's basically another who-dunnit, but at least this time, the killer doesn't spill the beans for fifteen minutes about why and how he did it. The cast is so-so. I always like watching Denise Richards, especially after ""Wild Things"" and she is spot-on in her performance as the leader of the group (but can you say typecasting?). Katherine Heigl (""Bride Of Chucky"") is also nice to look at, but is dispatched of very quickly, leaving us with a few no-name actresses and David Boreanaz, who I don't like in ANYTHING. Blanks' directing style makes the film very nice to look at, with a soundtrack full of obvious hard-rock and heavy metal tunes from the likes of Rob Zombie and Marilyn Manson. The murders are also pretty interesting and there are actually a few well-done moments of suspense. I would label this movie as competent. It's not perfect, and I don't tend to watch it much, but it entertains. Among the DVD features are a commentary by Blanks and a video for Orgy's ""Opticon"" -- which would be interesting if it weren't just clips from the movie. Bottom line: it's better than most of the movies that it fits in with, and certainly better than Blanks' own ""Urban Legends."" Worth watching.",1108252800,4,2668,4.764578833693305
1308211,1,B00003CXUP,"Jamie Blanks' 2001 ""Valentine"" is a recycle bin of a ridiculous psycho-killer plot seemingly pasted together from several previously made films, predictable ""boo!"" moments, character stereotypes, bad jokes, stale dialogue, and unoriginal killings.  Not that I actually expected much from this movie, coming from Blanks, responsible for 1998's ""Urban Legend"" and starring a bevy of Hollywood C-listers including the dude from ""Angel"", David Boreanaz, Denise Richards, Marley Shelton, Jessica Capshaw, and Katharine Heigl.

In this horrendously bad faux-horror flick, we start off at Valentine's Day 1988 when a bunch of nasty girls make a poor geeky kid, Jeremy's, time at the V-Day school dance absolute hell for him through rejection and embarrassment.  Fast-forward to 2001 when the girls from the dance are now being tormented by a psycho-killer (obviously Jeremy) and slowly killed off in successively dumber and unoriginal ways.  The execution of this stupid-yet-still-had-some-potential-to-be-scary-script is simply awful.

Where is the suspense? Where is the empathy (or at least interest) for any of the characters?  Where is just an ounce of intelligence, people?!  I know that this is a slasher flick and you're supposed to suspend disbelief to a certain extent, but this pathetic plot soon degenerates into an utterly ridiculous mess that will insult your intelligence if you are anywhere over the age of ten.",1107043200,3,1420,5.546296296296297

Although there have been no signs of a sequel yet, the window of opportunity remains open, and with the well-deserved global success of ""Freddy Vs. Jason"", the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and so on, there's still hope they'll get to do at least 1 more of the planned entries.

  Opening up with one of the most disturbing and uncomfortable beginnings big studio horror movies had seen in years, ""Valentine"" promises to cut like a razor and not a butter knife, and doesn't disappoint.  Managing to transfer over all the best elements of the late 90s 'hip' horror subgenre with none of the shortcomings into a scarier, more interesting (in my opinion), less sterilised (and non-self-parodying) package, it boasts A+ level production values, a uniformly talented cast, original horror scenes and a menacing atmosphere.  Distinguishes itself from most horror 'revenge' movies in that the initial mutilation of the character who'll return years down the road (to plague both the guilty and the innocent) is no accident.

1308337,3,B00003CXUP,"OK. This will not go down as a great horror classic. Even Denise Richards as the main eye candy can't really raise this film above mediocre.
A kid is humiliated at a junior high dance and seeks revenge. Not against the guys who beat him up, but the girls who wouldn't dance with him. The only person J.M. should have went after was the girl who lied and said she was attacked when it was obvious she liked what was going on behind the bleachers.
The kills are OK, the body bag neck slice could have been better though. The arrows to the stomach and dumpster fall was OK. Denise in the hot tub was by far the best kill. It kind of reminded me of those arcade whack-a-mole games. (I'm up! Drill!)
The ending had a cute little twist, but it wasn't hard to figure out. So not only is her boyfriend an alcoholic, he's a psychotic killer who not only kills her friends, but gets her friend blamed for it.
Advice for future horror film makers. A hockey mask works. A Michael Myers mask works. A burned up face and a dirty hat works. A retarded cupid doll mask.....does not work.

Following in Scream's footsteps, this film aspires to be part of the whole teen horror flick craze, I just think it came a bit late. I think since I saw Urban Legend a few years back, I realized that this trendy type of formulaic teen horror flick was on its way out finally. Since movies like Urban Legend, I Still Know What You Did Last Summer, The Faculty, and Final Destination came out, people no longer have faith or interest in this type of horror film anymore and that is why this film was mostly overlooked. Although this film is better than most of those films I just mentioned, it still kind of falls short, although it did provide some entertainment value. Sometimes I did feel like I was watching Scream 2 and I noticed that some the opening shots of some scenes were heavily reminiscent of Craven. Altogether, not a bad film. I admire the film's aspirations more than anything, but I think this film belongs in 1997 where it could have wetted our thirst for more teen horror flicks more successfully.",1058832000,2,1121,4.527093596059113

1308471,4,B00003CXUP,"I saw Valentine quite a while before Valentine's Day, and I thought that the Cupid guy gave off kind of a Michael Myers vibe, mixed with a little bit of the Hellraiser type of cloak.  The cast members are pretty good actors, and I thought it was pretty creepy how he had a bloody nose every time he killed.
The most fitting of the deaths in Valentine was probably when Shelly got shot repeatedly in the chest (by the cupid mask guy) with a bow-and-arrow.  But, the film didn't drag it out like it was that big of a deal, but it was the most fitting death.
However, the beginning was a little odd, I mean, in an average horror film, you don't see 6th Graders making out behind a set of bleachers in a prologue, but I guess Warner Bros. had to put it in to tell why the killer is the way he is (you must see the movie to find out his name, I will not be spoiling anything for you).
It was a while ago since I saw this, but the music was pretty good, and I liked the look of the killer, however, I was told prior to seeing this that the cupid mask was made of resin instead of hard rubber.  But, I liked the killer's look nonetheless, and the deaths were creative, and this movie did not rely on pointless gore to make it good.
The acting was superb, that Dave Boreanze guy or whatever pretty good, and so were the girls who portrayed the one-by-one victims of Cupid Mask (I'll call him that).  The only thing I really didn't like about the movie was that it was a little too campy, and there is a lot of joking around even though there is a maniacal mass murderer on the loose.
Overall, I liked Valentine, it's a good Holiday horror, and it just barely made it up there with Jason X, Halloweens 1-8 (except parts 3 and 5), and Jeepers Creepers.  Purchase Valentine and get a good piece of Horror Heaven (kind of an odd way to put it, ain't it though?)",1044921600,,1849,4.139275766016713

The killer's mask just adds to all the tension the movie builds.  He's not like any ordinary killer either.  His slyness keeps you wondering, ""How come he doesn't get caught?""  I know that's what I was thinking.  The plot is very well written and the cast is excellently chosen.  I recommend this movie to anyone who has been rejected or loves Valentine's Day.
P.S. In the end, pay close attention to what the supposed killer lacks... and what Kate's boyfriend doesn't lack that the real killer had.  I probably gave the ending away, but everyone I know that saw this movie got a wee bit confused about that tid-bit of info.  Happy Valentine's Day everyone!",1043798400,,920,4.449101796407185

1308610,5,B00003CXUP,"I think Valentine is a vastly underrated, thrilling horror movie.  At its root, it is obviously a slasher film, but this movie features great pacing, true suspense, quite effective musical transitions, and, most importantly, a terrific finish.  Valentine not only has a recognizable plot, it incorporates some dandy instances of symmetry that really help tie everything together in the end.  I wish I could tell you just how satisfying the ending is.  I had my suspicions about the identity of the killer, but several late twists made me doubt my theory, change it, and finally just applaud the filmmakers for essentially keeping me in the dark up until the very end.  I know the clues are there all along, and many people may discover the secret well before the final revelation, but this experienced horror fan was kept off-balance throughout.  I also have to admit that this movie made me jump a couple of times (and I can't say that about very many horror movies).  With significant help from the musical score, suspenseful scenes were really presented well-just long enough to make you grit your teeth but not long enough to become tiresome.  In trailers, the movie looks like another Scream (and there are definite similarities), but Valentine stands head and shoulders above the great majority of slasher films.
A lot of horror films feature attractive women, but Valentine is in a class all by itself.  What you get here is Katherine Heigl, Marley Shelton, Jessica Cauffiel, the charming Jessica Capshaw, and-drum roll please-Denise Richards.  Denise Richards is absolutely stunning in this movie-the smoldering, sultry looks, the prayer-answering hot tub scene, and the bedroom scene I won't even attempt to describe.  Watching the creepy old detective put the moves on her is rather comical, but you can't blame the guy for trying.
I must say I really love the killer in this movie.  While the concept of the masked killer is far from original, the cherub mask is a cool, creepy look.  This killer also enjoys variety, employing a number of different, equally effective implements of death.  He works his way up from your basic knife across the throat and crossbow to broken shards of glass and a couple of really innovative weapons.  No two deaths are remotely alike, and you can just tell how much the killer enjoys his/her work.  The DVD's energetic club reel of Orgy's song Opticon is great, but I would caution you not to watch it before watching the movie because it does give a little away in terms of who lives and who dies.
Valentine has almost everything I want in a horror movie-a creepy killer, gorgeous actresses, all manner of killings, miscellaneous laughs, an actual plot of some complexity, nail-biting suspense, and a less than obvious ending that totally satisfied this horror fan.  I would not have objected to some nudity, but this movie really doesn't need it.  It's hot, it's sizzling, it's sexy, it's smart, it's a carnival of murderous delight.  You won't find many slasher films better than Valentine.",1034294400,37,3037,4.942913385826771
1308611,1,B00003CXUP,"Valentine is just one of the many new teen-slasher thriller movies that are plagueing the horror genre.  It seems ever since Scream was a hit that we have just been bombarded by these totally non-scary, predictable, and overly stupid films that are trying to establish franchises such as Valentine, Jeepers Creepers, Urban Legend, etc.  The storyline isn't half bad on paper; a group of popular girls who shunned a boy years before are being sent some disturbing valentines and are then picked off one by one by a masked killer.  While this may seem like a neat idea, the delivery fails miserably.  While Denise Richards isn't really a bad actress underneath it all, her co-stars are horrendous and don't come off as believeable for one minute.  David Boreanaz seems to just brood his way through the film from start to finish, and the wanna-be twist ending isn't so twisting because anyone with a brain can figure out who the killer is in the first half hour of the movie.  The fake scares (hands on the shoulders) are just more annoying than suspenseful, and the film is not scary at all.  All in all, Valentine is just another teen thriller that tries to be better than what it is, but is a failure in an overbloated genre that is becoming an insult to true horror fans.",1034121600,2,1273,4.631111111111111
1308612,5,B00003CXUP,"I saw this in the theater the same day as Hannibal.  One movie made a truckload of money and stunk, the other was good with only a modest profit.  Can you guess which?
Valentine freshens the masked person killing teens genre and mixes in a great soundtrack with good acting and great cinematography.  We have seen this plot before, but it is perfected here and given a sense of style that carries it far beyond the films that came before it.
The plot is old as dirt... Spurned guy vows revenge and people start dying.

1308615,2,B00003CXUP,"It's a shame that Valentine is the first big-screen appearance of David Boreanaz (that I know of), because its one of the more dismal offerings in the post-modern slasher flick genre.  I noticed in the credits that ""Valentine"" is based on a book, and I can only wonder about it, given the hogwash the film turned out to be.
If this chap Jamie Blanks is such a fan of the genre, he sure doesn't show it, since he ignores both the tricks of the genre and innovative twists on them.  Cupid or Jeremy Melton or whatever the masked killer is supposed to be called lacks the meance of even ""Scream's"" Ghostface, let alone one of the titans like Michael Myers.  Blanks dispenses with the ways in which said menace can be established, as well as the ways in which Scream turned the nature of the killer on its head by keeping the villain all too human.  No reason why the killer wears a mask or kills the way he does is ever given.  Further, the killer seems to be something of an amateur, taking lives in ways that are neither efficient, horrifying, nor ironic.  The relationship established between Boreanaz and the killer in the final minute of the film is, in turns, both painfully obvious and a let down.  Its too obvious for the film's 'big star' to have this relationship.
The character building of the five lead actresses is a nice touch, but we're never given a reason to care for them, and, thus, never give a damn about what happens to them.  The audience could identify with Jamie Lee Curtis or Heather Langenkamp all too well, but with these ladies, not at all.  Its only the strong, if unsympathetic, preformances by these actresses and the high production vales which keep me from giving ""Valentine"" a single star.
Keep trying Jamie.  Michael and Jason and Freddie don't have anything to worry about just yet.",1025049600,,1816,4.56

1308763,3,B00003CXUP,"Tom Savage's book is much better than this twisted adaptation.  First of all, the only resemblance to the book is the fact that a nerdy kid was abused by some sassy younguns.  Everything else is completely reworked.  Director Banks opted to make the nerd a middle school student, and the girls are all young teenies too.  In the book, they were mature college graduates who had done something pretty despicable to a nerdy college student. Guess Banks figured he couldn't attact the all important ""youth"" audience if he casted anyone over 30.  Oh, well, with that aside, this movie suffers from a very pedestrian ensemble cast.  David Boreanaz is completely wasted in the role of Adam Carr, an alcoholic suitor to one of the heroines, played woodenly by Marley Shelton.  Denise Richards is around to prove she cannot act her way out of a paper bag, and she doesn't even look as beautiful as she obviously thinks she is.  Her demise is campy and incredibly staged.  The characters all do dumb things (like the first victim---working alone in a morgue with no one else around?  a student at that!).  They go into rooms they shouldn't, try and find people they shouldn't, etc., etc.  Yet within this amateurish framework is a subtly told story of what can happen when people pull the ""Carrie"" tricks on less ""beautiful"" people.  Jessica Capshaw deserves kudos as Dorothy; she's the only actress who seemed to understand her role.  And, what about the ending---who is (are) the killers.  The nosebleeding stunt is completelly confusing, and why weren't we given a little more information on what exactly happens with Dorothy?

That's what I liked less about this movie, it's just not believable at all. It reminds me of ""Fear"" a bit (if you haven't seen it, it's the kind of horror movie when you're laughing from the first scene to the last while you're supposed to be scared because it's just so silly and unbelievable).

1308766,4,B00003CXUP,"""Valentine"" (2001)
This is a typical teen slasher movie. It delivers where it counts, makes us jump out of our seats on the occasional bump in the score, has girls with big breasts that never care to show them, and overall its one of those movies with the 1 dimensional characters and endless amounts of blood and guts, but, hey, that's what I expected. Don't expect too much with Valentine and you'll probably find it fun enough. I know I did.
The best thing about Valentine is that it takes on a daring new premise and is able to succeed in making us scared quite a lot at times and provides tension and suspense in the atmosphere, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Valentine actually had my muscles very tensed at times and I found a couple of killing sequences right near the end particularly suspenseful. The killings are also very creative and gory, and the camera-tricks used when the killings are been shot are very attractive and impressive, and add to the atmosphere of the movie.
Valentine's acting is not exactly superior to other teen slashers such as the Scream series or I Know What You Did Last Summer, and we don't care for the characters an inch because they aren't developed, but storyline and characters aren't exactly a big thing with slasher films. Valentine doesn't actually have bad acting; it just could've been improved. Denise Richards plays the typical sexy bad girl, and does it well, although it would be nice to see her try something different. She looks good in a bathing suit, though. David Boreanaz has a lot of on-screen charisma but he doesn't have enough screen time. Marley Shelton is the head and shoulders of the movie, she is a fairly good horror actress, but unfortunately she can't anchor an entire film alone. I hate Jessica Cauffiel (from Urban Legends: Final Cut) and never will like her. She overacts horribly. Jessica Capshaw is probably the best actor in the film; she is one of the funniest characters and also one of the most emotional.
Jamie Blanks has proven himself as a good teen horror movie director. He knows how to provide mystery, have good set-ups, direct his cast well, pick neat tools for killings, and overall he impressed me with this movie. His directing in Urban Legend was also impressive. I would actually like to see this director take on something a little more challenging, because he has quite a lot of potential and I don't want to see him stuck on teen slashers for the rest of his career. He just needs that script with more ""oomph"" and he'll be on the road. I do applaud him for always bringing new life to the teen horror genre; first he makes legends scary, and now its Valentine's Day. Who'd of thought?
I enjoyed this movie. Sure, it had plot holes, some of the deaths are too fast, the characters aren't developed and we don't care for them that much (it's not like I wanted all of them to die, just some of them, but I was keen to see who would survive) and there is zero nudity. Not exactly the best flaws for a for a teen horror. Alas, the slick style, incredibly clever ending (especially for this genre) neat killings, fun premise, fantastic ideas and concepts, cool editing and camera tricks and an awesome atmosphere throughout kept Valentine on its toes for me.
Or maybe it's just because I saw it on Valentine's Day.

1308767,1,B00003CXUP,"...I just finished watching this tragedy of a flick with my sis.. I rarely write reviews and usually they are all goodness and light, recommending a particularly good product. Sorry to say not so in this case, this movie is proof positive that having slick casting, beautiful sets, and a great premise for a killer are not necessarily enough to make a good slasher flick. This film which based on the previews I saw of it looked like another take off on the Scream idea of witty and really well written horror flicks, comes nowhere near its potential. First of all starting off you have very little empathy with any of the victims; everybody that gets killed deserves it, in spades. (I am not even sure why the one girl survived other than the fact that her character was perhaps the least scummy of the group.)Which comes to point two, the acting in this movie was royally bad . To give you an idea how painful the acting was think of standing in the middle of a pile of razor sharp glass with no shoes on, then drill several screws under your thumbs for good measure.. (I know David Boreanaz can do better than this so I was generally dissapointed.) Point three too much was going on, you didn't get to know any of the characters well at all this sorta goes back to the empathy part except that even most of the shallow characters in this film were cardboard cutouts with no depth at all.( Only Dorthy really seemed to be fleshed out really well and she majorly deserved what she got in the end.) Point four The killer really didn't mess around with his victims much, he tended to kill them simple and straight foward there was no suspense only inevatability. Final point it was pretty easy to figure out who the killer was in fact it was so stupidly easy that it slightly shocks you that at the end. Not a good kind of shock by the way , nope this was the shock of the person who has been kicked in the teeth. You will be saying to yourself ""That was it? You gotta be kidding me ..."" Well I have said all I am going to say about that. Buyer beware if you are looking for a good movie steer clear. (Those who are looking for a new movie to add to their B movie collection this will fit right in.)",1019088000,6,2198,4.2860576923076925
1308768,1,B00003CXUP,"I still can't believe that Jamie Blanks (the director of Urban Legend) directed this movie!!! This movie failed in every element to provide a scary movie. The first weak element was the directing.
The second weak element was the plot. The story did not deliver anything new. It was a big failure, because it was just a bad mimic for the best scary movies Halloween, Scream, Urban Legend & I know What You Did Last Summer.
The third weak element was that everything was very much predictable, even the ending too was weak & predicatable.
The fourth weak element was the lack of suspense. Of course when the directing, plot & events are weak how can there be suspense?!!

The story starts off in the past and then shoots into the present day. We already have a slice of what happened to provoke the killer...but we have no idea who it is.
Using a topic such as love can be a really good basis for a movie, especially a horror. In this movie we are faced with the power love has on people...love can kill.
4 women who ignored a boy in high school are now faced by a killer, a killer who is unknown, a killer who definately knows them and wants them dead.
The cast really works well. Denise Richards as the one who loves men and romance - will her love of men lead her into murky waters?
David Boreanaz as the ever so cute Adam Carr. Are his charms a way of covering up something or will he end up dead before Valentines day is over?

1308772,4,B00003CXUP,"This is a refreshing, if somewhat bleak, entry into the plethora of late nineties pop/horror movie things.
This movie is a revenge tale with a seethrough double-twist at the end. It is seemingly a movie about a young man who was heart broken by shoddy treatment received from some popular girls at a school dance and so decides to kill all of them years later.
He is really peeved however at Dorothy who claimed that he had been sexually harrassing her when 3 bullies saw them making out underneath the school bleachers. This lie led to the boy being thrown into Juvey.
He ends up pinning all the murders on her at the film's end, elevating the film above the level of a lot of other late nineties slashers.
The mystery of Who the killer is will never really get off the ground for anyone who's ever sat through an episode of Angel and would recognise David Boreanz's way of walking, but this takes little away from the film. The selfishness of his quarry is viciously exposed and you find it pretty hard to feel sorry for any of them, particularly the brutal Dorothy.
No one sees these films for the acting so I'll merely mention it in passing. Kate Capshaw is solid as Dorothy, Boreanz is on the whole invisible, but has the obvious menace that comes with playing an uncompromising crime fighting vampire on TV for 2 years. Denise Richards doesn't really act, she just says a few lines and tries to look seductive. Anyone who finds her attractive would like her death scene. The main female character in the story is very easy to look at and isn't annoying in the least.

1308893,2,B00003CXUP,"There have been audiences for horror films for generations. In the 1930s Dracula and Frankenstein were so popular they spawned sequels, which were rarities in those days. Valentine's origins don't go back that far. They date to the 1970s, when cheaply produced movies like Friday the 13th and Halloween were making producers rich. These were so called slasher flicks, in which cute and not very bright teenagers were done in by predatory fiends with unearthly powers. Valentine's characters are a bit older, but they are also cute and rather dimwitted. As movies in general go, it isn't that good, but judged within the horror genre, which has fallen on hard times lately, it's decent enough.
The movie starts in a school gymnasium where a group of sixth graders are attending a dance. The class geek asks several girls to dance with him and is quite rudely rejected. Later, a much less attractive girl agrees to dance with him. They wind up smooching under the bleachers. A rowdy group of boys catches them, and when the frightened girl says the geek attacked her, they beat him up. The poor kid winds up being sent to reform school. [Horror buffs already know where all this is headed.] Thirteen years later, we find out that the girls involved in the incident have grown up to be best friends. Life is good, and all of them have bright futures. Or they think they do. Someone, however, has held an awesome grudge all these years and is out for murderous revenge. Is it the boy or is it someone you'd least suspect? The movie does a reasonably good job of keeping us guessing until the very end. That ending is not nearly as clever or as logical as the movie's makers hoped it would be, but it's no sillier than others in films of its type.
The cast is somewhat above par for this sort of thing. The most interesting performance is given by Jessica Capshaw, whose mother, Kate, is Mrs. Steven Spielburg. It's a bit unsettling to see Denise Richards in yet another horror flick. She's proved several times she can do better career-wise.
Director Jamie Banks, who also did Urban Legends, keeps the action moving at a brisk pace and provides a reasonable amount of jolting moments. Much of the movie was filmed in someone's huge house in California. Its rather Gothic decor makes a suitable backdrop.",1016150400,,2299,4.693069306930693

""Valentine"" is basically about a nerdy high-schooler who was beaten and humiliated at the junior high prom who gets sworn revenge against the five women who have rejected him twenty years after. A simple plot for sex, beautiful women and plenty of gore.
""Valentine"" has some good points about it. One is one of the bitchy girls, played by the always sexy Denise Richards, who enjoys chewing on the scenery and the wafer-thin dialogue, while David Boreanaz gives the movie a fresh look and feel, while still wearing his traditional ""Angel"" smile. The last good thing mentioning about this movie is that it has about some good moments of suspense that go along with its constantly meandering plot. Not enough for a five-star rating, but it's enough.

This movie has more than a dozen characters and they all have a reason to be the masked killer, so you constantly wonder who is the killer. This is less like a horror movie, and more like suspense, because you see the killer stalking the characters, but never any real gore (you know how they get killed, with a knife, axe, glass, drill, but you never see it happen).

1308901,2,B00003CXUP,"Many can be said about this dismally bad horror flick.  It tries to do something unique, but in fact retread the old, battered road.  It tries to imitate the chill of ""Scream"" and other post-modern horror movies, giving some surprise twists, but, no, it only irritates the audience.
Think about this.  Four girls are supposed to be threatened by a murderer stalking behind them.  But none of them takes it seriously.  Not a detective from the police, who instead would  sexually harass Denise Richards.  Many people around them (including very one of them) are suddenly missing, but they don't seem to worry about it.  Ok, so they are such irresponsible, cold-blooded chicks who bullied one poor boy long time ago.  But, then, why should we care about them?
The whole premise is totally nonsense; at ""a maze video party scene,"" guests that were swarming around the room suddenly are gone from the scene, and the killer can appear without being seen, even moving some objects and walls as it wishes, and finally desposes the body very automativally.  On top of this risible development of situation, at another party scene, AGAIN, the people vanish while our heroine is taking a bath ALONE, and the killer chases its target ALONE, and hides the bodies wherever it wishes.  No, no.
Pick any great horror films in the past, and they all tell you that you cannot make a good, bone-chilling flick without paying attention to logics during the course of the entire film.  ""Valentine"" never does.  Consequently, scares come occasionally, but not with enough impact.  As Denise Richards is gorgeous, I give two stars, but otherwise it is unbelievably bad.

1309010,3,B00003CXUP,"Drop this rating down to 2 stars if you're not really a slasher movie fan.
Director Jamie Blanks, who helmed Urban Legend, directed this very typical but stylish slasher.  Like Urban Legend, Valentine is is not the sum of its parts.  While both films feature some classic slasher movie pieces, they both try to throw in twists that they don't follow through on.
In many ways, I'm glad to see Valentine appear, as a I feared that absolutely no one would want to make a slasher movie after the Screams, the Last Summers, and the spoofs that followed.  Being a big fan, I loved some portions of this film, but ultimately I was left wanting.
The story?  Well, basically a grade schooler is shunned by a clique of girls at a Valentine's Day dance.  Years later, someone is stalking the girls and bumping them off in imaginative ways.  But who is it?
The ending doesn't seem to make too much senes, but maybe I'm thinking too much.  (Like most slashers and indeed most horror films, Valentine inevitably unravels under even minor scrutiny).
But enough of the story and the plot.  We know they're going to be second rate to the stalk-and-slash of the genre.  And in my humble opinion, there are at least 2 excellent sequences in this film.  The first involves the first victim of the cherub-masked killer.  Working in a morgue late at night a young doctor (or was she a med student...does it matter?) is stalked.  The killer bursts into a room that is lined on either side with gurneys.  On each gurney is a zipped-up bodybag.  Naturally, we assume the girl is hiding in one.  In a very spooky and stylish sequence, the killer slams a hunting knife into each bag, waiting for a scream or some real blood.  You can guess what happens when he gets to the last bag...
The other sequence is Denise Richards' death.  Playing a very unlikable, bitchy gal she gets a particularly cruel death involving a hot tub and an electric drill.  (Echoes of Body Double?)
Both of these sequences are atmospheric and creepy, which counts for a whole lot in a horror film to me.
The rest of the film could have certainly been better.  I would think that director Blanks learned something from Urban Legend, but this is a weaker effort all in all.  At times there is a little too much attention paid to the set (the lavish party, the art gallery installtion (which was impressive nonetheless)) and not enough attention paid to real suspense, let alone scares.  The killer looks pretty good actually, not an easy chore to pull off since the mask is a cherub face.
A point of recommendation is the soundtrack.  Culling a lot of populuar ""nu-metal"" and dark tracks, it features Static-X, Linkin Park, Amanda Ghost, Snake River Conspiracy, Marilyn Manson, Orgy, etc.  Though you might not remember all of these tracks from the film, it's a very solid disc to pick up.
I'll give credit to this DVD though.  Nice transer, good sound, and a good job on the extras.  Least they could do for a so-so film.
Last but not least, as if I need to mention it, the ending sets up a Valentine II...",1013040000,,3053,4.557798165137615

Later on he gets beat up at the dance by some boys that think he was trying rape this girl. Later on in the movie when each girl starts getting vicsious Valentine cards that buy immiedetly comes to each of their minds of course. ""Hey remember that kid we were mean to at that Valantine's dance ?"", meanwhile this is like years after, that's just a dumb. I mean I doubt anyone that picked on me at High School or Jr. High immiedetly thinks of me when they're pranked or Harrased, lol.
  Well anyway they start getting hunted one by one by someone in a cupid mask. Plus the killer stops to make some pointless other kills too of course.
 Spoiler:  What makes no sense to me though is that there's 2 killers that aren't in cohoots but they both just happen to kill wearing the same mask.
  So there's some things in this movie that just don't work. However it still is kind of entertaining I guess. Makes a good popcorn movie at least, that you could sit down with friends and make fun of. Some of the killing scenes can be pretty scary too actually. So don't expect another Scream or even another I Know What you did Last Summer for that matter and maybe you might enjoy this B-Movie Horror film more.",1012348800,,1322,4.289156626506024

1309017,1,B00003CXUP,"After Valentine, Jamie Blanks would have to be considered one of the worst directors working at the moment. And coming from  Australia, he's doing great damage to the country's growing film industry. First Urban Legend, mediocre at best, now he's (...) Valentine into existance.
You might know some actors in this film, I'll save them the shame of mentioning them because you'll never see them again after this film. A geek is tormented at school by 5 girls and they won't dance with him. BOO HOO! Anyway he does his block and is shipped off to the nut house for the next 15.
Despite being 9-10 when this happened the girls stay friends, yes all five, never losing contact, until they star getting knocked off by some hooligan (guess who?) in a Valentine mask.
Now Blanks could have tried to scare but he's employed every tired directorial technique making it obvious where the killer would be and what action he'd take. Oh look we're in a mortuary, maybe he's hiding in a body bag?
This film seems to be filmed inside a bubble (streets are bare, on one else seems to exist) Hello cheap porn look, which combined with terrible acting, make most scenes look daytime soap.
Blank's seemed intent on taking this seriously, when he may have saved the movie if the girls got nude. And it could have been justified in the campy horror/slasher/nudity take. Thus distracting us from the rest of the film.
No matter what, this is studio driven trash, fronted by a few pretty girls (and a few not so pretty) and helmed by a director who'll do what he's told. Although Blanks can't take all the credit, someone had to write this trash and I'm sure he's happy to have friends to take the heat.",1008115200,5,1680,4.5813953488372094

It remains a mystery to me why David Boreanaz, who was so good as Angelus on TV show 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer', wanted to branch out into movies with such an awful role.  Furthermore, the teen actors are terrible.  Denise Richards is so terrible in every movie that she's in that you begin to wonder whether the director was trying to be ironic.  Still, her eyebrows reach new heights of acting in this film.
The deaths are all spectacularly stupid and every clich is employed to maximum use.  So the question pops up again - is this a self-knowing, clever teen slasher flick?  Maybe the director was aiming for this but he left out any actual scares or any of the black comedy that the 'Scream' movies were jam-packed with.  Obviously every recent teen horror movie is going to be contrasted with 'Scream' and then it obviously can't compete.

Anyways, a cherub masked killer shows up and starts knocking each one off one by one. Is it the poor kid they tormented in school?. Is it somebody else?. I think the answer is pretty obvious right from the start. I can't imagine anyone not figuring it out. It has all the deep mystery of a Scooby Doo cartoon. Besides it's faults, there are some good points this movie has. The first one, is the women. Their all lovely to look at. The second is the producers' attempt to make the characters more grown up. Out of high school and actual career business women in the real world. The opening sequence however, is quite nice. It's a shame that David Boreanaz from ""Angel"" had to pick this as his first major film role. He's a good actor with incredible presence and that should've been used in a much better film debut. Some of the kills are quite fun if you like that sort of thing. The ending is definitley no surprise. Trust me.

Obviously, Denise Richards is one character I won't be forgetting and her portayal as ""Paige"" really made me feel sorry for her when she met the killer at the end of the movie.
All the characters are played by good actors and I would love to see a sequel. Jamie Blanks also produced another amazing horror film ""Urban Legends"" and ""Valentine"" is another thriller where you'll jump from your seat a few times.
The extras on the DVD aren't great but the movie is v.good so buy it.
Believe me, the mask the killer wears is seriously freaky.

1309153,2,B00003CXUP,"I rented this movie expecting something much more then I got. Maybe I just wanted to see it because of its female cast, or I expected another scream, but there were so many things wrong with this script. First comes the part when Shelly runs from the killer and into the morgue, then hides in a BODY BAG. Predictable and forshadowing about what will happen to her in the next moment. Next, when Lilly dies after being shot with three arrows and falling from a balcony into a dumpster, no ever knows she's dead but the killer. Then comes the part when people who had nothing to do with Jeremy in the sixth grade start getting killed(like Dorothy's boyfriend and Kate's crossdressing neighbor), which proves that the killer is in fact NOT Jeremy. And when exactly did the detective get beheaded and have his severed head thrown in the fountain? Finally, the worst part was when the killer is shot dead before the mask is removed, so you have no idea what the motives were, and when Kate and Adam hug and nosebleed, the blood comes out at an awkward angle, displaying a poor job on special effects.
Now the film is not atrocious like I Still Know What You Did Last Summer, so it could be worth watching more than once, and any red-blooded male can dig Denise Richards, maybe more so than Jennifer Love Hewitt, but good-looking actresses cannot save the film when it is poorly written. Hell, I think I could have written a better script and storyline. I'm also real bored with all this ""nu-metal"" that dominates the soundtrack. (I Think) the underground of extreme metal features much more skill, but the general public hates it and when the script is already meant for the paper shredder, a bunch of uncommercial death and black metal will not get the film the audience that Hollywood craves.",1004918400,,1789,4.61128526645768

1309155,3,B00003CXUP,"If you're one of the people who're going to spend all their time bashing this movie, at least read the book. It's better, trust me. I didn't catch this movie in theaters, mainly because of the blink-and-you'll-miss-it theatrical run, and because it opened a week before Hannibal. Instead I caught the DVD, and was rather disappointed, to say the least, since I am a fan of Tom Savage's novel and director Jamie Blanks' first film, Urban Legend.
The movie begins with a nerdy, bespectacled boy named Jeremy Melton (standing in for Victor Dimorta from the novel) asking some of the prettiest girls to dance at a Valentine's Day social in 1988. He's rejected by all but one, Dorothy. Jeremy and Dorothy are later caught making out under the bleachers, and Dorothy, out of shame, claims Jeremy attacked her. Jeremy is ""Carrie""-d with a bowl of fruit punch dumped on his head, stripped and savagely beaten by his male classmates.
Fast forward 13 years and Shelley Fisher (Katherine Heigl), all grown up, is the first of the girls to be slaughtered a few days before February 14 by a cherub-masked Cupid killer as she carves up corpses at med school. Her former friends, Paige Prescott (Denise Richards), Kate Davies (Marley Shelton), Dorothy Wheeler (Jessica Capshaw) and Lily Voight (Jessica Cauffiel), are all somewhat-successful career women in vaguely-defined jobs who are scouring the San Francisco dating scene, 21st-century style, when they hear of Shelley's demise. Before long, Dorothy and Lily also receive threatening Valentines and Kate finds a Cupid mask in the elevator after someone breaks into her apartment. A local detective (Fulvio Cecere) inquires of the Valentines, which are all signed simply ""JM."" This of course brings up memories of Jeremy Melton, who apparently hasn't forgotten about the vicious Valentine's Dance from hell. But who does Jeremy Melton look like nowadays? Kate's on-again, off-again boyfriend Adam (David Boreanaz)? Paige's Turbo Dating pickup Brian? Dorothy's quasi-boyfriend Campbell? The detective? The answer is revealed at a huge Valentine's bash at Dorothy's mansion, where the killer drops by uninvited to create a Valentine's Day massacre, 2001-style.
I like Marley Shelton. Not only is she cute-as-a-button, but she does have talent, appeal and charisma to burn (but is not allowed to simmer with projects like this and Sugar & Spice). Denise Richards seems at home playing the man-eater again and I did sympathize with Jessica Capshaw's Dorothy (since I too was the fat kid nobody wanted to dance with in grade school). Jessica Cauffiel redoes her Urban Legends: Final Cut shtick and Katherine Heigl does a somewhat presentable job as this film's Drew Barrymore. David Boreanaz finally gets to smile and wear a colour other than black for a change from his show Angel, which is nice.
The movie was good, but having read the novel first, I was rather disappointed. I also didn't understand Hedy Burress' character Ruthie and why they even bothered to put her in here. Jamie Blanks doesn't do as quite a good a job as he did in Urban Legend but, hopefully, with the right project, he will show people he's not the directorial hack everyone perceives him to be. The score by Don Davis left a bit to be desired but served its purpose well. One thing I couldn't help noticing was the lack of red in the movie, apart from Dorothy's mansion. You'd expect a horror movie set on February 14 to be swamped with the colour but I guess it would've been an eyesore. My advice is to see the movie first and then read the novel, therefore disappointment won't be so high. BTW, I love the Valentine clips shown with Orgy's song Opticon.",1002672000,3,3668,4.946515397082658

The plot is as thin as the paper it was written on (a waste of paper if you ask me, someone needs to call Fraud, Waste and Abuse on these guys).

The story is very simple.  A young boy, Jeremy Milton, was rejected by several girls at a dance back in junior high school.  Several years later, the girls, now beautiful women are being stalked by someone.  This someone is leaving them cruel and deadly Valentine cards.
The acting in the movie isn't very well done, but it's not bad to say the least.  Katherine Heigl does a very good job with what she's given.  David Boreanaz is shamefully underused, and the main lead, played by Marley Shelton, is weak in my opinion.  The only one that did exceptionally well is Denise Richards.  She pulled off her role with great brilliance.
Most of the scenes in the movie could have been better, but they weren't anywhere close to being bad.  The movie could have also used some stronger character development.  But even despite all this, I still enjoyed Valentine a great deal. If you're looking for a decent movie to pass time, then Valentine may not be a bad choice.

The ending would of been nice and surprising without the obvious clues. If you want to see a good scary movie see Scream, Urban Legend, Halloween, etc. Valentine could of been better.

There WERE a couple of loose ends, and quite a few things about this movie that were just WAY too close to other movies (particularly 80's flix). Also - I am a bit sick of the unpopular kids in school being pinned as the killers. I was one of those unpopular kids until college and really am pretty sick of the implication that WE would do things like this. After being treated really badly by other children growing up, it is upsetting to me that kids like me are ""thanked"" in this way.

The only male appearing high on the cast list is David Boreanaz, who plays Kate's alcoholic boyfriend, Adam.  We had to rent this movie because Boreanaz plays Angel on TV, and it is in her performance that you most note the FOUR writers are not giving the characters anything new to do.
Director Jamie Blanks' commentary track makes it clear that he is a devotee of slasher flicks, but perhaps he ended up being too careful in the construction of this movie.  Only the final scene constitutes anything approaching a significant twist, and given the one dominant clue in the film it ends up being pretty much telegraphed.  The photography is certainly more luscious than you expect in a slasher flick and Marley Shelton stands out as the young woman obviously slated to survive, but when all is said and done ""Valentine"" is devoid of scenes of any decent suspense or horror.  This ends up being an average slasher film and that means it is not very good.

BUT - this movie (which perports to based on a novel) is nothing but rip-offs of low budget slasher films from the 70's and 80's. We open on a middle school dance (later we will find out that this was supposed to be a Valentine's Day dance, but it is never mentioned as such at the time). And since when do you where masks at Valentine's parties? Anyway, a school nerd is traumatized by having red punch thrown on him (nod to Carrie) and then humiliated (ala Prom Night). Years later a girl is killed while working on a cadaver (this is supposed to be a unique situation I suppose, but is nothing more than a slight rip off of the Reanimator). More girls, more deaths, more boys, more deaths - each one is so predictable and quite frankly, boring. I've seen all these deaths before in Friday the 13th, the Burning, Nightmare on Elm Street, etc. ad nauseum. Are we to assume that the characters in this movie have never before seen a horror film? If so, please tell us this important tidbit of data. Otherwise, Denise Richards wandering off in the middle of a party to take a bikini clad dip in the hot tub is just a bit too droll.

I was stoked about VALENTINE.  Denise Richards, Marley Shelton, Katherine Heigl, Jessica Capshaw, Jessica Cauffiel & Hedy Burress all in the same movie! How could it possibly be anything but good.
Not a bad concept. A series of murders centered around a group of girls that have been friends since grade school.  I won't give anything way..(even though there isn't much to give away), but nothing is done with it.  The story is straight forward.  I've never seen a horror movie that was so void of suspense in my entire life!!  I'll just say this.  If anybody ever walks off by themselves..... kiss'em goodbye.  yawn....
Oh... and despite all the beautiful people involved in the film, it's also void of anything sexy or remotely risque.
I'm a writer, and either the original writers idea was butchered by sensors and executives, or Hollywood has proven once more that it isn't what you know, or how well something is written, but who you know.

The movie just spirals downhill getting worse and worse until it finally ends in a STUPID UNINTERESTING INSULTING MESS.  Denise Richards is beautiful, but her character is really very dull.  This is basically a cheesy teen slasher that insults anyone with even half a brain.  I gave it two stars because it had some decent moments in the begining.  I'd pass on this terrible movie.

1309417,1,B00003CXUP,"There comes a time when one can only watch the same washed up, tired out storyline without beginning to poke fun at the tactics the filmmakers use. Watching ""Valentine"" was a much more interactive experience for me. I found myself grimacing in complete contempt for its reliance on horror clichs and a morality lesson that is phony to the core, while also screaming at the characters for their outright stupidity.
The movie is one of the worst post-""Scream"" features I've seen, and that includes ""Urban Legend,"" which was also directed by Jamie Blanks, who brings nothing but banality, predictability, and boredom to his latest venture. There is no mystery to be hashed out, no suspenseful moments that are worth biting nails over. In fact, the movie goes so far as to evoke the audience's sympathy for the killer, and not his victims. And that just the beginning.
The film opens with a junior high dance, as a misfit boy walks up to various girls and asks them to dance. Each of them turns him down, one politely, the others in demeaning fashions. Moving ahead thirteen years, the movie introduces us to those girls many years later, and wastes no time in getting rid of one (if the bimbo doesn't have enough sense to leave the building instead of corner herself and become a slab of bloody meat, then she deserves to die).
Not that any of the other girls are any smarter or interesting. There's Paige (Denise Richards), Kate (Marley Shelton), Dorothy (Jessica Capshaw), and Lily (Jessica Cauffiel), and from the get-go, they do absolutely nothing of interest to us or of importance to the movie. After they attend the funeral, they get some insider information from a detective who has a horny eye set on Paige. That, coupled with some very unconventional Valentine cards and gifts, and they begin speculating as to who could possibly be the murderer.
If there's one thing I hate, it's a blonde trying to figure out a murder mystery, especially when the rest of the group can't seem to help her out. As if the whole thing isn't blatantly obvious to the audience, yet the characters are required not to piece it all together too soon because this is a mystery, and we have to find out piece by piece who's behind the supposed mayhem.
There's just one problem: most of the audience already knows who the killer is, who's going to be left in the end, and so on. The script throws various possible contenders into the picture to try and give the film some mystery, hoping to keep us waiting for who the final killer is going to be. This may have worked, had they kept it to a minimum, but by the time the nine male rolled onto the screen, I was already making my own predictions.
The movie has a lesson behind its fodder, one about teasing and how it catches up with you. Of course, it takes a backseat to the social lives of our four starlets, who seem more concerned with throwing a Valentine's Day party instead of keeping their lives. We come to despise these females so enormously that we feel a certain sense of sympathy for the killer, once a teased child. I don't think this is what they had in mind, but so it goes.
What makes it even worse is how many trite sequences the movie contains, from panicked girls running up the stairs instead of out the front door, to cheap shocks involving hands falling upon shoulders and people darting out from behind corners to a jump on the soundtrack. We've seen it done a million times, therefore diminishing any effect that moments like this have on horror buffs.
""Valentine"" is like a bad dream you'd have after eating too many heart-shaped candies. There's nothing interesting about a movie that continually and shamelessly embraces old-school tactics. I sincerely hope that this is the last of the teenage horror genre for a few years; we need a breather.

I'm not going to review it like everyone else because it looks like people got it covered as to the base and plot of the movie.

I take it as there are 2. . . . . . :::spolling statement:: I mean you would have to see the movie...but why would Dorothy wear the mask as well? Unless she's a killer as well (as she pointed out she was the ""fat"" one and, moreorless, the least liked one of the group of her friends, in her mind). Or else the guy injuried her enough to put the mask on and she was in too much of a shock to take it off but I wouldn't give people that much credit to think that one up.

1309534,1,B00003CXUP,"This movie is terrible. Don't be fooled by these positive 4 star reviews on Amazon like I was, it stinks. It is formulaic to the nth degree, the director even rips off the Halloween films with gimmicky shots (some might call them an homage, I call them a rip-off). There is no sense of fun or cleverness in the whole film. People randomly come into the story and then are killed before you even know who they are or why they are there in the first place. There doesn't seem to be any main character or hero in the story, the hero seems to be the only character that's left alive at the end, thus being the hero only by default.
The direction is disjointed, certain scenes seem to be in the movie for absolutely no apparent reason at all (i.e. the candle wax scene). The methods of murdering the victims in the film are generic and uninspired, even for this type of ""teen shocker"" film. Oooooh! A stabbing! That is original stuff.
The acting is mediocre at best. But then the characters don't have even the least bit of substance for the actors to work with either. Why does this group of people continue to hang out with each other years and years after they left school? And are they 20-something professionals? Because they act like teenagers. Except they live in clearly expensive homes and apartments, seemingly by themselves. The male characters just wander into the plot. Are these men the same junior high bullies at the beginning of the film? You never really know for sure. And why did the overweight, socially ostracized girl suddenly become friends with the so-called ""popular"" girls? And when did this happen? Why did they suddenly accept her into their ""cool"" circle? Because she lost weight, therefore becoming ""cool""?

You can tell that Jamie Blanks (Who also directed Urban Legend) mostly paid homage to all of his favorite slasher and horror movies. He even admits to it himself in the commentary given on the DVD. And Blanks also sounds like he has fun doing what he does.
 Valentine has also been classified as a teen slasher, when in fact, it isn't. Sure it has some of today's hottest ""Teen"" stars -- who are actually in their early thirties and late twenties - but the characters themselves are adults over the age of 25. And I do admit, some of the acting was quiet bad, but that only added to the fun of the movie. Marley Shelton did well as our heroine. She acted best when she was running or was terrified, but did well when she wasn't. David Boreanaz is her recovering alcoholic boyfriend. He was really underused in this film. Katherine Heigl, Jessica Caulfiell, Jessica Capeshaw, and Denise Richards round out the main cast.
 There are some very interesting chase scenes in this movie. The first is suspenseful, while the second wasn't much of one. The second could have really been good if they'd played it out longer. The true highlight of the movie is Denise Richards. Not because she acted well or flaunted her cleavage the most. It's because . . . well, if I said, I'd give away some of the movie.

1309732,4,B00003CXUP,"""Valentine"" is a bad movie that could have been good.
Blessed with the most attractive (female) cast in recent memory, this movie could have been a smart whodunit; rather than the pointless, slasher ""Carrie"" knock-off that it is.  And, while ""Valentine"" seems to have had more screenwriters than Time Magazine has correspondents, most of the blame must go to Director Jamie (Urban Legends) Blanks.
Like the recently-released ""Whipped"" and ""Saving Silverman"" ""Valentine"" has an anti-female under-current that is surprising several decades after the Women's Movement caught fire in the 1960s.  What this movie says, more than anything is:  ""I'm mad at the pretty girls who rejected me, so I'm going to KILL them!""
Plotwise, we have a rejected grade-school boy, who grows up to become a serial killer, taking his revenge on a group of (twenty-something) girls, who, while not Model Citizens, are not deserving of the death sentence.  Philosophically, ""Valentine"" is a case of cinematic road rage!
What's most troubling is the fact that ... the audience is encouraged to identify/sympathize with him as he takes his revenge.  Hitchcock always had a strong sense of morality in his thrillers; but, today, directors don't seem to ""think"" anymore--just load up the screen with enticing image after image.  The idea of a ""moral compass"" is completely foreign to the advertising and music-video trained directors.  Thus, ""Valentine"" is in the tradition of the recent ""Charlie's Angels"" and ""Tomb Raider""--brain dead!
As stated before, however, the female scenery in ""Valentine"" is very, very impressive.  Denise Richards seems to get better looking with each movie, though she has yet to live up to the acting promise of her ""Wild Things"" performance.  In ""Valentine"" she, again, plays the bad girl, and gives the most interesting performance of this young cast. It is also interesting that in today's Hollywood, classic beauty, like Richards', is usually equated to evil; whereas, ""edgy"" beauty, like Angelina Jolie, is viewed as okay.
Marley Shelton, Jessica Capshaw (Steven Spielberg's step-daughter), and Jessica Caulfield also brighten up the picture.  Finally, Katerine Heigl, the best reason to watch TV's ""Rosewell"", does a cameo in this picture, and has grown into a breath-takingly beautiful young woman.
David Boreanaz and Daniel Cosgrove are the two male leads; and, while they will never be mistaken for, say, Jude Law or Jared Leto in the looks department, are still a visual relief when you consider that Pam Anderson is dating Kid Rock.
All things considered, however, most viewers will come away from ""Valentine"" with a bad taste...of having seen fresh, young talent wasted in an ill-conceived story that may have worked in the hands of a more talented director, say, Brian DePalma.",996364800,,2790,5.249438202247191

1309735,3,B00003CXUP,"Valentine is a average slasher flick. It's not half as good as Scream, but it's a hell of a lot better than Urban Legends Final Cut. The acting is actually somewhat decent, and the film does get the viewer interested with the characters. The main problem with Valentine is that it is just another run of the mill slasher. There isn't anything that spectacular about it. There's some gore, but nowhere near as much as the gore found in Scream. Also, it's low on suspense. There is only one interesting suspenseful scene, and that is the begining murder scene in the mourge. Otherwise, it's just another rehash of people getting offed by a masked killer. Still, it's enough to keep the viewer entertained, and maybe not feel ripped off by paying the price to see the film.
Valentine opens with a scene at a 6th grade dance. Here, we see a nerdy kid named Jeremy asking a handful of girls to dance with him. After a few just blow him off completely, he asks the film's protagonist, Katie. She replies ""Sorry, not right now, maybe later"". He then asks a chubby girl named Dorothy who sitting on the bleachers. The next scene shows them kissing under the bleachers, when they are then found by the big bad older kids. Dorothy screams rape, and we are followed by a carrie rip off, and then to Jeremy being sent away.
The film then shifts to about decade later, one of the girls who blew off Jeremy at the dance is working late at a mourge. Guess what happens next? The girls at the dance are now being stalked by a cupid masked killer who offs them one by one.
The death scenes are interesting enough to keep the viewer entertained (pay attention ULFC!). In one of them, the killer actually uses a bow and arrow and offs a victim Robin Hood style. Others include a red hot iron, a severe back ache, a sharp pain in the face, and the grand daddy of them all, the drill in the jaccuzi.
As the movie progresses, it's fun to watch. We actually get a sense of each of the film's characters and what is going on in the movie. However, when the film's climax is reached, it's gets a bit silly. I'm not giving anything away, but just to let you know, THE ENDING DOES NOT MAKE ANY SENCE AT ALL!
In all, Valentine is fun, but it's main problem is that it just dosen't hold anything to any other movie in the slasher genre. Still, it can be fun, it just isn't as entertaining as some other slashers.",996105600,,2383,4.357303370786517
1309854,1,B00003CXUP,"After 'Valentine' concluded I was at a loss for words. It took four screenwriters to write this absolutely atrocious mess? Not only is the script highly unoriginal and ridden with embarrassing plot holes, but it also sports some of the worst acting in the horror genre.
 Have you seen the excellent thriller ""Halloween?"" Which is coincidentally another horror movie with a ghost faced killer, that slowly stalks it's victims, was tortured during his youth, has parents that died under mysterious circumstances, was in an insane asylum and the happenings take place on a purely commercial holiday? Well than you've seen ""Valentine"" and you've seen it done much better. ""Valentine"" is the horror movie for the brain-dead TRL generation that has no patience for originality in any form.
 I'm gonna summarize the four credited screenwriter script in 3 sentences. Ugly kid gets bugged when he was young by pretty people. Fast forward thirteen years and pretty people start dying. Pretty people wonder who's doing it while dealing with half realized sub-plots. The story not only rips pages shamelessly from ""Halloween,"" but also many other horror movies. For instance similar to the ominous note giving in ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" the main characters get Valentine cards saying such things as ""Roses are red, violets are blue, they are going to need dental records to identify you."" That's just the tip of the iceberg.
 Let's talk about the acting in ""Valentine"" because the dialog honestly sounds like a first-time script read-through. Denise Richards is especially dreadful. You thought her acting couldn't get any worse than her outing as a possibly handicap nuclear scientist in the Bond flick ""The World is Not Enough?"" Well, unfortunately for her, it does! Her line delivery is honestly worse than the Olsen twins when they were 5 years old on Full House. The other actresses are nondescript blondes that look frighteningly similar to one another from a far. They are neither remarkable nor unremarkable actors; they are just there to eventually die in an unimaginative manor. One blonde gets a threatening Valentine and doesn't even seem to care. Another eats maggot filled chocolates and doesn't seem to overly mind either. On top of that, neither calls the cops. That is just stupid, plain and simple. Lastly, the killer is so painfully obvious even from the promos that there is no point in watching this movie at all. The predictability is tremendous.
 Don't bother with ""Valentine."" It's a huge waste of time. I would go as far to say it is one of the worst movies I have seen in my life. That's saying a lot considering I used to work at a movie store and I'm a big horror movie fan.",996105600,6,2700,4.9144736842105265
1309855,4,B00003CXUP,"Following in the tradition of the ""Scream Trilogy"", ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" and it's sequel. And, ""Urban Legends"" (Jamie Blanks,directed this movie also!)and it's sequel, comes along ""Valentine"" yet another Jamie Blanks' teen horror film. Whenever these type of movies come out now, what most critics and even the public does is, we compare them to ""Scream"". Are these new movies as hip and smart as ""Scream""? Do they have that wit, and feeling of not taking themselves too serious? Well, if you look at this movie in that sense, then ""Valentine"" actually works. People are always shocked when I tell them I love these ""teen"" movies. I'm not a film snob are something, but, I usually like to watch movies by Woody Allen, Bernardo Bertolucci, Martin Scorsese, Franis Coppola, and Ingmar Bergman. So, when I tell people I liked ""Scream"" and ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"", it's as if they're talking to someone else. I can't really explain why, but I really do enjoy these kinds of movies. I've out grown that age where these movies are scary for me. None of these movies scare me. So, why do I like them then? I like them because I like the people in them, and by people I mean the people who are playing the parts and even the characters. Because I'm a teenager (18) I get more fun out of these movies than adults for sure. Before watching this movie I heard a lot of bad word of mouth from people. I heard this movie was a complete waste of time, lucky for me, I usually don't care what the popular opinion with movies are. If I like a movie and not everyone else does, I don't care! Or if it's the other way around. ""Valentine"" isn't as hip or as smart as ""Scream"" for sure. It's not even as witty. But, the movie keeps you going along with it, despite the fact, you'll probably know who the killer is in the first 15-20 minutes. It depends on how many of these movies you've seen before. ""Valentine"" is a very formulaic film. The ONLY real suprise is, when will everyone else find out who the killer is?! If I said this is a ""great"" movie, I'd be OVER doing it, but, yet at the same time, if I said I hated this movie, I wouldn't be honest. There is some fun to be had with this movie which is about a group of girls; Denise Richards (Paige), Jessica Capshaw (Dorothy), Marley Shelton (Kate) and Jessica Cauffiel (Lily) who recieve life threatening valentine's cards. The main suspect is and a young nerd they all picked on durning grammer school. They think he has waited all this time to get some revenge. The plot is not Oscar worthy stuff, and may even seem dumb to just about everyone, but, if you enjoy ""teen horror"" films. Well, this should fit the bill quite nicely.
 p.s.-The ONLY ""smart"" plot twist that happens, is at the end. It's the ONLY time durning the whole movie that will have you question what you felt to be true. Even if you only doubt yourself for less than 10 seconds.",994291200,15,2908,4.405204460966543
1309856,5,B00003CXUP,"look, i went to this movie a week after it first opened with a group of my friends..i had reservations about this movie because of the bad reviews that i had seen in a local paper. i went with my friends to this movie with low expectations. i like similar movies like the scream trilogy (though at times it seems a little played out), i know what you did..., and i thought urban legend wasn't bad at all. this movie can now be added to that list...i left the theater satisfied with time i spent watching this movie and i can't wait to pick it up when it finally arrives on DVD",993427200,,576,4.151785714285714
1309857,4,B00003CXUP,"""Valentine"" might not win the Oscar for Best Horror Film, but it still is in line with other slashers such as ""Urban Legend"" and ""Cherry Falls,"" the latter of which received very positive reviews.  This is still a good, scary movie, although not as clever as the awesome ""Scream"" Trilogy or the ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" movies.
The movie starts with a dorky, ugly kid, Jeremy, asking five popular girls to dance with him at the school Valentine's Day dance.  All of them meanly turn him down, except for two -- Kate, who tells him maybe later.  And Dorothy, who ends up making out with him under the bleachers.  When a group of kids see them, Dorothy claims he attacked her and Jeremy is sent off to reform school, never seen again.
Flash forward nine years...the girls are all in college when one of them is viciously murdered by a cherub mask-wearing killer.  Then they all start getting threatening notes, and then more people die until the big climax -- a Valentine's Day party at Dorothy's huge mansion, and the killer is revealed.
Yeah, it sounds very cliche, I know.  But there is actually some originality in the script, and the actors play their parts surprisingly well for a somewhat low-budget horror flick.  Marley Shelton in particular stands out as the sweet heroine Kate.
So, all in all, not a bad scary movie.  Not a fantastic one either, but not as bad as reviews have made it out to be.  Give it a chance, and you'll be surprised.
Oh, one more thing:  to the person who said all of the good reviews for this movie have incorrect grammar and spelling....I know that's a cutdown for all fans of the movie, and it's your opinion if you like it or not, but maybe you should worry about the MOVIE instead of our spelling mistakes.  Because last time I checked, you were supposed to review the movie, and not our spelling.
Thank you.",993340800,2,1854,4.520958083832335
1309858,4,B00003CXUP,"I loved Urban Legend, so when I found out that Jamie Blanks was directing Valentine I was thrilled.  Fact of the matter is I LOVE horror movies!  This movie was great!  It is too bad that during its theatrical run, the competition was just too much.  I mean come on, we had J-lo's booty amuck in the Wedding Planner, and Hannibal prancing about in a European Country.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I forgot the name of the country because the movie bored me, so I paid little attention to it.  Anyway, I loved Valentine because the production value was great.  I just love the look of the movie, and the mansion they used for the party was simply stunning.  On top of that I liked the story line, and come on let's face it we have all been rejected at one point or another.  It's tough, although most of us are sane enough to deal with it in a healthy way...at least I hope so.  Anyway, the acting was great, and the movie just kept me wanting more.  I especially loved the scene in the hot tub with Denise Richards.  I think drowning is a horrible death, but what they did to her, to terrorize her like that, was creative and thrilling.  I don't want to spoil the movie for those who have yet to watch it, but I love horror movies, especially the slashers, and this one is really good.  I must say that I like Urban Legend better, but Valentine is still a GREAT follow up for Jamie Blanks.  I know it did poorly at the box office, but like I mentioned earlier, look at the competition.  Had the movie been released at another time I know it would have done better.  I would love to see a sequal, but given the little box office intake, I doubt that.  If someone choses to do one and have it be a mess and bolt it straight to video, then you know what, spare us.  Either do it right or don't do it at all!!!  So if you like horror movies, give this one a try, you won't be dissapointed.  And you know what, Give the movie CHERRY FALLS a try too.  Unfortunately this movie was sold to USA network and by passed the theatrical run because of all the clout hanging on horror films these days.  It had a theatrical run in England, and did well there.  I have the DVD of it and I love it!  Have a good one guys and thanks for reading my review",992908800,10,2227,4.147196261682243

1309862,5,B00003CXUP,"The recent Hollywood slasher genre, post-Scream flicks, have become so old that I watched this and found it really cool and refreshing.
So you could knock holes in the plot with a feather, ANNE ROBINSON is scarier on THE WEAKEST LINK and it's 'humour' is almost non-existant... but I watched it with a clear mind, and I felt totally absorbed by it.
All the cast were likeable if sometimes wooden... but in what slasher films (other than SCREAM)do you find faultless acting... but that's not the point. Director Jamie Blanks seems to be carving his neiche as Wes Cravens protege. The glossy dull-ness of his debut admirable URBAN LEGEND has evolved into this, almost a cross between Beverly Hills 90210 (with the cast: ALL seem to have just walked out of a 'worlds most beautiful people' competition) and the classic 'anything-for-a-body-count' slasher-thons of the 80's, with a touch of classy thrillers thrown in. I see a big future for Mr Blanks.
The connections to Valentines Day is a touch sketchy, and the ending confused me a tad (who was the killer? both of them? did they know about the other one? were they in on it togethar?), but the death are interesting, creepy, gory, and I even spilled popcorn at one point (the very first jump in the morgue)... and that's something I never do!!
It may sound like I wasn't too keen on this film. But... for some reason... I loved it... every single second of it.
