7786660,5,B01HH7KC60,"The Shallows revolves around Nancy, a surfer girl who goes on a secluded beach where she meets some guys there to surf with. Everything goes well for Nancy until one day when she goes surfing alone and gets horribly bit by a shark and gets stuck on top of a big rock while simultaneously losing a lot of blood from the nasty wound she took. With no one around to help her, she must put herself in the ultimate test for survival and must come up with a plan to get to shore safely without the shark killing her. The Shallows is a movie that constantly had me on edge. There is plenty of suspense that gets you worried about what will happen to our main character. While this isn't a flaw with the movie by any means but one thing I did find a little surprising was the amount of gritty content shown on screen like the shark attacks and the amount of blood shown. For a PG-13 movie, it can get pretty intense. Blake Lively's performance as Nancy was excellent as well. The movie isn't perfect by any means as it is relatively predictable and some of the other characters aren't as well developed as Nancy. Aside from these minor flaws, The Shallows is the best shark movie we've gotten since Jaws and I'm glad to see a shark movie that actually takes itself seriously.",1467504000,2,1267,4.350210970464135
7786661,5,B01HH7KC60,A really great survival movie! Incredible performance by Blake Lively whose only real supporting characters were the shark and a seagull.,1467417600,,137,5.571428571428571
7786662,3,B01HH7KC60,"OK, it's stupid, but so is Jaws.  It's fast and fun and the filming is pretty good.  But people have apologized for Jaws portraying sharks as villains.  But this movie does the same thing 40 years later.  OK, not to give stuff away but there is a dead whale involved.  If a shark has a dead whale, it sure doesn't give a crud about chasing down a healthy human.  Even a bleeding human is not comparable, it's been shown that sharks don't really care about human blood, they like fish blood.  Sharks don't wait out prey either, bears have been known to do so but not sharks.  At least not in that way.  So we go back to pretending sharks are evil after so much work to show they are just fish.

It's not like most other movies are realistic anyway.  Cars hit other cars and jump 20 feet in the air, people fall off buildings and walk away, if a car is in more than a fender bender, it bursts into flames and explodes, guns that hold six rounds fire 8 times, etc. etc. etc.",1467417600,,971,4.166666666666667
7786663,5,B01HH7KC60,"If you liked any or all of the movies in the headline of this review, then there is a pretty good chance you will enjoy this film. It's the perfect balance of horror, suspense, and intensity all crammed in under 90 minutes. Blake Lively puts on an incredible performance as you really feel the pain she endures throughout. For only being PG-13 I feel as though this movie plays it safe yet at the same time uses its rating to the fullest extent. It's about as dark and gruesome as a PG-13 movie can get, which isn't a bad thing.

With ""Jaws"" being one of my all-time favorite movies, and being a huge shark fan since I was little, I would definitely say this movie will please most shark fans out there. Especially since it has been a long time since we've actually gotten a really good shark film!

Definitely worth watching!

OVERALL: 4.5 / 5",1467244800,6,844,4.397435897435898
7786664,4,B01HH7KC60,"Lets not kid ourselves, Blake Lively is not a great actress.  She will NEVER be a great actress.  But if you need a young, blonde, all-American, physically fit actress, Blake Lively will fit the bill.  She exudes health and vitality.  Its easy to believe that she would be up to tough physical tasks.  Shes friendly and expressive.

So she has found perhaps the perfect role for her talents with the gripping THE SHALLOWS.  Shes called upon to play an American surfer who has come to an obscure beach in Mexico do enjoy the very waters her mother remembered so fondly.  She chats amiably with her driver, then arrives at beach.  She is filmed somewhat lingeringly getting changed into her surfing gear, and then she has some fun with a couple of local surfers.  The scenery is gorgeous.  The people are gorgeous.  Its all wonderfully tranquil.  Until, suddenly, it isnt.  Lively, late in the day and now all alone, is attacked by a huge shark.  The movie is now one of survival, man-against-nature.

The film clocks in at a crisp 87 minutes.  It tells just enough story, for the most part, and nothing more.  Livelys adventures, while certainly quite unlikely, have just enough credibility to draw the viewer in.  There are brief moments of humor (the film features a wonderful seagull!), and plenty of moments of terror.  If the ending is a bit of stretch (and the coda that follows it a bit ham-fisted), my feeling upon leaving the theater was of having been well and professionally entertained.  Its not quite a horror film, nor is it an existential crisis film (like ALL IS LOST, Robert Redfords excellent film).  It follows a competent, determined but fearful character that we like as she tries to figure out a way past her deadly dilemma.

There are a few flaws, of course.  These vary from unavoidable (a few of the CGI effects are not great, no doubt due to the films tiny budget) to unneeded (sorry, but I just don't buy Lively as doctor-in-trainingand the script didn't have to make her one).  A few times the shark perhaps acts with more intelligence than it should (despite what JAWS: THE REVENGE suggested 30 years agosharks don't carry grudges).  And the ending feels a bit tacked-on and unneeded.  Weve spent nearly the entire film alone with Lively.  We should have been able to end it that way too.

But these are minor annoyances.  If you want some heart-pounding fun, set in a gorgeous location (with some beautiful views from above)  and prefer to get your frights without supernatural elements, THE SHALLOWS is highly recommended.  This film came somewhat out of nowherebut it is well worth discovering.",1466985600,,2625,4.764444444444444
7786665,4,B01HH7KC60,"""The Shallows"" (2016 release; 87 min.) brings the story of Nancy (played by Blake Lively). As the movie opens (following a pre-credit scare), Nancy is in a pick-up truck being driven by a local towards a 'secret' beach in Mexico (the local refuses to give the beach's name), where Nancy's mom went all those years ago when pregnant with Nancy. Once at the beach, Nancy is ready to go surfing, the only other people being there are 2 local guys also surfing. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from director Jaume Collet-Serra, best known for the recent Liam Neeson action movies Non-Stop and Run All Might. Here he takes a tougher challenge, namely how to bring a great white shark attack survivor-thriller in a way that makes it original, believable and entertaining. It is hard to believe that the original movie in this genre. ""Jaws"" is now over 40 years old. Let's get the obvious question addressed right away: is this movie terrifying? The unequivocal answer is a resounding YES. There were quite a few scenes that I could barely look at the screen, hiding my eyes. One of the biggest lessons we learned from ""Jaws"" is ""less is more"", and Collet-Serra basically follows that formula, as we don't really get all that many open looks at the shark up close until very late in the movie. Also helpful is the outstanding photography, which is pure eye-candy from start to finish (the movie was filmed entirely in Australia). Last but certainly not least is the strong performance by Blake Lively, who is by herself for much of the movie. This role might very well catapult her to the top tier of actresses, at least financially. Bottom line: I head seen the trailer of ""The Shallows"", and the actual movie lived up to my high expectations, and even surpassed them. The perfect summer movie: both terrific and terrifying at the same time.

""The Shallows"" opened wide this past weekend. The Sunday matinee screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended very nicely. Box Office Mojo has reported that the movie grossed much better this past weekend than had been projected, but that doesn't surprise me. This movie is bound to get fabulous word-of-mouth and this will play very nicely in theaters in the weeks to come. If you loved ""Jaws"". you will liked this one too. ""The Shallows"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",1466985600,,2442,4.730046948356808
7786666,5,B01HH7KC60,"I went and saw this and the Shallows was an excellent film. It has a lot of tension, good plot , and is scary.",1466985600,,110,3.625
7786667,3,B01HH7KC60,"The Good:
Blake Lively plays a great survivalist. You could tell she worked out for the part and immersed herself in the world of surfing to prepare for her character. She managed to display a fair range of aspects to her character. She was vulnerable when times seemed bleak, but tough when danger presented itself. The mere fact that she's able to keep your attention while being one of the only people on screen for about 75% of the movie speaks highly to her performance.

Kudos to the shark. It was convincingly terrifying to the level that you wouldn't want to trade places with Blake's character on any occasion. The suspense the shark brought to the table was probably equivalent to that of the shark in Jaws.

The Bad:

My biggest issue with the film was that it was incredibly predictable. You knew what was going to happen with almost every character, every time. The only minor surprises were probably the actual interactions with Blake Lively and the shark towards the end of the movie. The story and characters are pretty straight-forward and fit almost too perfectly. (Rather convenient for her that she went to a certain school.)

The Reason:
If you've heard news or reviews about this movie you'll hear that this is the best movie since Jaws. I will agree to that, only because what other shark movies does it have to compare with? Sharknado? If that's the case, then yes, by default this was as good as we get since Jaws.

What you see in the trailers is exactly what you get. The Shallows isn't a terrible movie by any means. I enjoyed it. I just don't think it's worth paying a lot of money to go see. I'd probably recommend catching it during the matinee or if your local theater is doing one of those discount movie days. Otherwise, if you happened to watch this at home on DVD or streaming, I think it would be perfectly fine as well. I get the feeling that this would be a good Saturday night movie to watch when there's nothing else to watch.

The Rating: 6.5/10",1466812800,18,1987,4.5363128491620115
7786668,4,B01HH7KC60,"""The Shallows"" is great. This is how the story goes: A mere 200 yards from shore, surfer Nancy is attacked by a great white shark, with her short journey to safety becoming the ultimate contest of wills.

The cast led by Blake Lively (as Nancy) is great. The directing by Jaume Collet-Serra (who also executive produced) is great. The story & screenplay by Anthony Jaswinski is great.

The music by Marco Beltrami is great. The cinematography by Flavio M. Labiano is great. The film editing by Joel Negron is great. The casting by Ben Parkinson is great. The production design by Hugh Bateup is great. The art direction by Fiona Donovan & Nathan Blanco Fouraux is great. The costume design by Kym Barrett is great. The special make-up effects designed by Sean Genders is great. The special effects supervised by Ronald Grauer is great. The visual effects supervised by Scott E. Anderson, Allan Magled, David Nelson, Gregory D. Liegey, Nathan McGuinness & Jos Manuel Weil, designed by Ashley Beck and coordinated by Joe Greenberg, Lee Maher, Paul O'Hara, Emily Pead & Johanna Lange is great.

This is a great, well-done and entertaining thriller that is smart and well-crafted. Blake Lively gives a solid performance as Nancy. Jaume Collet-Serra has directed another entertaining and solidly-crafted film. This is one of the better films of the summer season and also one of the better films (also one of the best thrillers of the year) of the year, as well, too.",1466726400,,1462,4.887096774193548

Its towards sundown and the 2 guys leave but Nancy wants to catch one more good wave and its after she sees something unusual floating in the water that things really start to get moving and the rest of the movie goes at a pretty good pace. Very exciting and as for me I wasn't very good at predicting what would happen next and I don't want to blow it for you.

PROS: The best part of the movie was the tension. It was electric! You were set up in very basic, very improbable location (with very little recourses) and you were tasked with thinking creatively. That was the fun part. And even though there was so little that could actually take place because of the location, it didn't stop from building up the tension that was inevitably there. Another thing that critics disliked, but I really enjoyed, was the acting. BLAKE LIVELY took a difficult role and made it her own. There was so little room for creative character development, emotionally wise, but she did the best she could which I saw.

CONS: The biggest problem I had with this movie was the faults with the conclusion of the film. The end was super abrupt, and it wasn't able to connect with the way the characters were set up before.

Overall, the movie was great but the ending fell flat.

+ Blake Lively (married to Ryan Reynolds FYI), does a fine acting job and is believable in her role.
Her character is female, tough, and independent. She's smart and brave, yet knows when a situation is bad. She's likable without being witty and sarcastic, but simply because she has good relationships with family and friends and is friendly to others.

+ Gorgeous beach area!

> There is a situation with a whale, that seems to come out of nowhere, considering there are other surfers around who should have known about it. Seemed like a plot hole. But we're able to move past it without too much difficulty and experience the events.

+ Good enough suspense.
What makes the suspense (non-spoiler), is even in the trailer and the title you know she's in the shallows...meaning she's not to far from shore, but sharks can easily swim in the shallows in real life. Thus the shore is so far away even when it feels within reach.

+ Shark special effects were very cool and well done.

+ I didn't see the end coming till 30-sec before it happened. I liked how it ended and I was able suspend any disbelief because I was caught up in the scene.

OVERALL: Not a 5-star...I reserve that for the must own, must watch movies like Lord of the Rings extended edition versions. But definitely, a watchable movie that reminds me even in clear waters, dangers can lurk. Check it out.",1496275200,,1570,4.546099290780142

Surprisingly, there is something special and unique about THE SHALLOWS. First of all, the beach setting is beyond gorgeous. A stunning beach on an isolated Australian island doubles as  Mexican beach in the film. Hey, that that is the wonders of Hollywood.

Blake Lively does a fantastic job as the injured surfer on a desolate beach spending most of her time on a rock outcrop in the water. Somehow it all works and we feel her anxiety and struggle to survive. This is one hungry and determined shark. Yes, there is a bit of JAWS in our shark but aren't all sharks movies compared to JAWS? Most of the visual effects are great. Just the beautiful setting makes THE SHALLOWS worth a view. Lively is in top form here. The extras are well worth the time to learn about real sharks and attacks, and how and where THE SHALLOWS were filmed.

7786775,5,B01HH7KC60,"Fans of shark attack films and fun yet nerve-wracking movies that make you yell at the screen and smile.

Let me just start by saying this film is GORGEOUSLY shot.  Taking a break from Liam Neesons never-ending old man action film comeback, Jaume Collet-Serra (Run All Night, Non-Stop, Unknown, Taken) does a phenomenal job capturing the hidden beauty of such sights cameras typically fail to do justice.  Yes, there are some camera angles favoring the curve of Blake Livelys butt and, well, other curves.  But don't let that distract younot too much anyway LOLfrom the elegance of all else the camera captures when not swooning her form.  The colors and lighting are crisp perfection.  This feels like watching Blue Planet (2001) or Planet Earth (2006) in HD.

After losing her mother to a long battle with cancer, Nancy (Blake Lively; Age of Adeline, Savages) visits the very Mexican hideaway her mother once surfed.  Exquisite use of screen-on-screen phone tech gives us a sense of Nancys unflagging independence and determination during her personal walkabout while identifying her desire to remain connected.  Almost instantly, Nancy is a most personable character and we understand the organic relationships she has with her hungover travel mate and her kid sister.  I was also impressed with the likability of her kind driver (&Oacute;scar Jaenada; Pirates of the Caribbean: On stranger Tides, The Losers) who, despite an endearingly moderate language barrier, had a lot to say.

Once dropped off at the secret beach that perfectly matched her mothers photos, she takes to the waterthe fantastically serene, perfect, beautiful waterwith some of the action-shots of her rides rivaling Blue Crush (2002) and admonishing marginal glimpses of the oceans rocky floor.  She makes some passing friendly acquaintance and submits to the call of the waves until shes the last one in the crystal water.  Everything was just sobut then it happened!

Clouding the water with lacy wisps of blood, she claws at the gaping wounds of a nearby mauled whale (of all things), terrified of her unseen assailant.  Her independence is all she has now.  Shes in for the fight of her life. With a wounded leg, a desperate sprinting swim to a submerged rock finds the company of an injured seagull, unable to fly and nervously chirping with every little tidal splash.  Chittering all affright, I was so warmed when Nancy fed the gull a crab.

This movie has taught me a few things about myself.
1. Never in all my life of being plagued by these birds while eating my lunch on the beach would I have thought this, but Ive never wanted to adopt and love a seagull so much in my life!  That bird deserved a Best Supporting Actor nod but got robbed like Wilson (Castaway).  I kept shifting from being nervous for Nancy and awing over the bird. We even discussed the gull in our podcast (Ep 83: The Best Non-Human Characters of 2016).
2. Flare guns no longer offer me any sense of security.
3. Apparently, I yell a lot during buoy scenes.
4. I have a newfound fear and respect for jellyfish.
5. This shark was sent back from the future fully equipped with a T-800 cybernetic endoskeleton produced by SkyNet. Thats literally the ONLY explanation I have for this things strength and unwavering focus.

Lets be honest. We all know whats gonna happen. Shes going to get in the water to make a run for it, the shark will appear, and shell scramble back to safety.  Itll probably even happen more than once. Yes, we all know this. So, imagine my pleasure when it happens and I instantly clench up and get nervous for her as if I didn't see it all coming.  Jaume Collet-Serra (also House of Wax, Orphan) is no stranger to horror and he seems now to have a better grasp of it than everand well-complemented by his skills acquired in recent action-suspense films.  So, every time Nancy dips her toe in the water, we are nervous!  And when the shark attack scenes come, they are intense!

Enjoy this film. Its the kind of nerve-wracking suspense you know and see coming, but its still fun to experience every time.  Plus, its fun yelling at the TV if you're like me and get really involved. Dont trust me? Then check out Marks reviewhe loved it, too.",1494979200,,4216,4.763411279229711

7786782,2,B01HH7KC60,"I saw this on On Demand as I like shark films (well most shark films). It started out dippy, slow, and the main character, who's a surfer--I thought surfers had this innate ability to tell where a shark would be found--like oh I don't know near a whale carcass and get the heck out of there (I'm not a surfer, but even I know where sharks reside).  But of course our main character doesn't and that's where the action picks up.

The actress is okay in her role and there's a Seagull too, who you're really hoping doesn't get chomped by the shark.  The shark antagonizes Nancy the whole way and there were some pretty dumb scenes....oh and she's studying to become a doctor so she knows how to torque her leg and help out with her other injuries....which I don't know seemed convenient for the movie or the writer was sloppy.  ""I have to have this character go through something and ride out a few days and she can't bleed to death....hmm...oh I got it, she'll be studying to become a doctor!""  *rolls eyes*

It was interesting though to see the character smarten up especially when she swims to the buoy and afterwards.  It's not the best shark film, but it's certainly not the worst. If nothing is on, go and see it.  If ""Jaws"" or another good shark movie is on, I'd recommend you instead watch those films.",1493942400,,1308,4.420833333333333

7786786,1,B01HH7KC60,"I'll preface this review by saying Face Off is the worst movie ever made (well maybe Rocky 5 too) so I compare all bad movies to that.  And after watching this, Face Off has some competition!  I'll admit that I didn't even pay for the rental because it was on at the lake house where we were staying.  But unlike Face Off, you HAVE TO WATCH THIS MOVIE!  I don't think I've laughed so hard at a movie since Superbad or 40 Year Old Virgin but those were supposed to be funny.

SPOILER ALERT!  I always wanted to write that lol.  Now the premise was good.  Girl surfing, gets attacked by shark and swims to safety but safety is on a rock away from shore.  After that, it goes horribly wrong.  Shark can eat a dead whale like 30 seconds away but nooooooo, it wants humans to eat!  And not any human but it wants a nice blonde surfer girl.  Almost had a seagull too but the seagull managed to make it to the same rock and hang out like 2 feet apart from the surfer.  So naturally they become best buds in a matter of hours.  Surfer girl can even diagnose that the seagull's wing issue is a dislocation and she snaps it back in place.  In return (because they are now friends) the seagull alerts her to people on shore that can save her life!  It's amazing!

Oh and the end... I laughed sooooo hard (not going spoil that treat for everyone).

So unless your choice is to slam your privates in a door jam, there are many better choices out there.  The fact that I see over 300 reviews averaging out to a 4.5 out of 5 makes me shake my head at what the general public feels is good entertainment worth our hard earned dollars.",1492992000,2,1618,4.17799352750809

7786794,4,B01HH7KC60,"Blake Lively is pretty but don't let that stop you from enjoying ""The Shallows"" which is a singular satisfying shark survivalist movie.  Lively plays Nancy, a daughter who has lost her mother and in a sense her own way as she has given up temporarily on her dreams, and she is has come to a beautiful bay in Mexico to be alone with her thoughts and memories and mother's spirit as she channels and focuses all of these things through surfing in this idyllic slice of Eden.  Mind you there are a few other human actors that share screen time in this short movie but Lively is the primary and almost sole actress in this film.  It is no mere shallow nod to acknowledge the truth that she carries this film, and she does a fine job.  Her acting requirements require her to be strong while betraying vulnerability, brave and decided in the midst of an impossible situation, and warm in her connections to family and others and nature.

But did you come to ""The Shallows"" for all of this?  No!  Of course not.  You came for the terror of the great white shark that stalks the shallows and has an unnatural desire for human meat and blood.  Lively's Nancy is the main course on the menu though the shark finds a few others to chow on.  The shark is an ominous and unknowable force of nature in this movie.  It is relentless like in ""Jaws"" but is also more of a natural than a supernatural force.  There are some great moments with the shark and it looks good and adds to the intensity of the scenes.  When we see the shark feeding on a whale carcass, when we see its shadowy outline under the water as it feeds, we can see how immense it is.  Nancy at one point is atop this bloated whale carcass, at another time laying on her surfboard, for much of the time across a small rock crop that has the tide swallowing it, and sometimes scrambling around a metal buoy.  Nancy's resourcefulness and bravery and determination is at once realistic and completely unrealistic but despite the unrealistic elements ""The Shallows"" remains relatively grounded.  It's a tight, short little thriller that offers exactly what you think it does, it appreciates the natural beauty (including Lively's) but doesn't ogle it (or barely does), and it offers that catharsis of facing our demons that lurk just below the surface and surviving them.

Review was done on a 2016 LG OLED 4K TV using an Oppo UDP-203 Ultra HD player

I won't go much into the movie details but will say that the movie itself was very enjoyable. With limited Ultra HD titles available, I've found myself buying some great looking movies.. even if the movie isn't that good. This movie was a great mix.

The movie comes in a 2-disc set: Disc 1 is the 4K version of the movie (requires an Ultra HD Blu-Ray player), disc 2 is the 1080p Blu-Ray version of the movie with the extras.

The movie is in 2.39:1 ratio (black bars on the top/bottom) and has Dolby Atmos audio for those with an Atmos receiver.

The movie itself looked great. Being a mix of shot in 4K and 2K, with the effects mastered in 2K.. I was surprised with how great it looked. Being an outdoor movie, it really shows off the great location they shot it in. Grain/noise was relatively low throughout while the HDR really made the beach/water pop. Definitely a ""demo disc"" to show off the 4K quality while also being a very enjoyable movie.

One of the top 10 titles I've viewed so far, right up there with The Revenant and some others.

Highly recommended for anyone with a 4KTV and 4K UHD Blu Ray Player!",1490832000,7,1268,4.30672268907563

7786813,4,B01HH7KC60,"The Shallows is one of those movies where you might think the plot wouldn't work, but it ends up surprising you.  I mean, the premise has a single character stranded on what's basically a rock in the water for most of it's duration.  How is that going to work?  Well, it does.

A young woman surfer (Blake Lively) travels to Mexico in search of a beach her now-deceased mother once visited, long ago.  Finding this idyllic spot, she heads into the water with her board, unaware that a great white shark has recently taken up residence in the area.  Attacked and wounded, she manages to make it to a shallow part of the water where some big rocks jut up out of the ocean.  She finds refuge there, but with the tides coming in, the rocks start to slowly get swallowed up by the coming tides.

And that's where she spends much of the movie, as the waters rise and the shark continues to prowl menacingly about, alone except for a single wounded seagull.  I know some people are going to snicker at the bird angle, but I thought it worked well.  As this is still largely a one-womam show most of the time, a lot falls onto Blake Lively's performance skills to keep things interesting, and she excels at it.  In the movie several other characters appear from time to time but their total screen time is minimal.  The filmakers manage to make each character's brief scenes count to maximum effect though.  The Shallows is generally very believable, with only the ending seeming a little far-fetched.  Overall, I think it's my second-favorite shark movie, after Bait, and I'd rate it about an 8 or 8.5 out of 10.",1489017600,,1605,4.508650519031142

There is no comparison - this is much more (excuse me) shallow - or should I say a more simple story line. It lacks the scope and depth of Jaws.

7786869,4,B01HH7KC60,"After losing her mother, medical-studend 'Nancy Adams'(Blake Lively) travels back to a secluded Mexican beach her mother
had visited whilst pregnant with 'Nancy' to soak-up the feel of the place and enjoy to her hobby 'surfing'
After enjoying the waves and the company of a couple of fellow surfers, 'Nancy' decides to have one last surf, whilst out there
riding the waves she notices a carcass of a humpback whale, heading back to shore she is bumped off her board by a 'Great-
White' that sets about attacking her, with leg injuries she scrambles onto a rock jutting out of the sea.
She first has to stop the bleeding as best she can, then contemplate how she reaches the shore some 200 yards away.
The two surfers she'd surfed alongside earlier were preparing to leave the beach, he cries for help are not heard.
She'll have to spend the night on the rock sharing the space with an injured seagull.
The next morning a figure appears on the beach, a chancer who sets about stealing 'Nancy's' belongings, he notices her board
bobbing about in te sea and wades out to haul it in unaware of the sharks presence....not hearing 'Nancy's' warnings or pleas
of help, he becomes a victim.
As the tide begins to rise 'Nancy's' hopes of survival deminish.....the surfers from the day before return to the beach, she desperately
try's to warn them to stay out of the water...they don't hear her.
A helmet with an attached camera is left floating in the sea, she manages to grap it, she now, with all hope seemingly gone records
a final message for her family to hopefully see....
With high-tide getting closer and the rock quickly being submerged she has to find a way to out-wit the 'Great-White' who certainly
has by now aquired a taste for human flesh.
This in truth, though very tense at times, is just another Shark-Movie....there have been so many since the highly successful 'Jaws'
movie, none quite living upto the splendour of the 'Speilberg' classic.
The film is worth a viewing, though i suggest perhaps catching it on the movie-channels rather than buy.",1482796800,,2056,4.729805013927576

I wasn't sure how I'd react to Blake Lively as a medical student/heroine, but she held her own in the movie. Awesome special effects and cinematography. I don't want to give anything away because the plot is simply woman vs shark, but the movie will make you think twice about being in the ocean!",1482105600,,399,4.2631578947368425
7786886,3,B01HH7KC60,"...maybe this one film will try to be good?  It starts out ok enough.  But before I get to the movie itself, imagine being interviewed by a studio head today. You are an up and coming screenwriter and have written a script about a girl vs a shark.  You then try to sell your idea to a movie studio. The reaction might be ""What? Why are you even wasting my time? EVERYONE has a shark script!""  ""Go to SyFy channel with this stuff if you really think someone would invest in it.""

That is pretty much where shark stories are today.  Now, having said that, someone apparently did buy into this script and this flick got made.  It is better than most shark films today but has some major flaws. POSSIBLE SPOILERS: A dead humpback whale provides plenty of food for predators and scavengers alike .  Surfers should never surf alone if they are smart.  The seagulls and dolphins fleeing should have been a warning from the beginning.  Anyway, not too shabby if you like shark movies. At least it's not Sharknado. 3 stars.",1482105600,,1014,4.461956521739131

7786890,4,B01HH7KC60,"This isn't a complicated storyline for a movie, it's simply a human verse predator movie, where the human, a med school dropout surfer who has been searching for a beach she doesn't know the name of her deceased mother had visited and photographed in Mexico, must try and use what scarce resources she has to firstly not die from an initial wound from her first encounter with a huge shark, and secondly survive as the sadistic shark instead of swimming off like a normal shark would, decides to even though it could kill her easily, torment her with many near misses.  That's the only thing that lets the movie down, what is the shark's motivation here, she didn't run into it on a wave with her surfboard or anything, yet it acts like a psychopathic human who just wants the human to spend it's last hours in fear until it decides it's grown bored and finish the job.  But you couldn't really have a shark vs human movie if a shark just behaved like a real shark, so you can't really complain too much about that.  Perhaps he was just weeding out of the gene pool someone stupid enough to get in a car with a complete stranger and ask him to take her to a remote beach, then think she's going to somehow call Uber when she doesn't even know what this beach is called, and then also goes off surfing by herself where no one knows where she is if something like this happens.

Even though the movie is mostly Blake Lively on a rock of an exposed reef, with the tide getting higher it wasn't really boring.  Granted it did take about twenty minutes for the shark to appear in the film and at just an hour 16 minutes long (before the credits roll) that's pretty lengthy.  Although you've got to hand it to Blake who does a brilliant job as Tracey, the best performance though has to go to Sully, who played Steven another character also stranded on that rock with an injured limb who constantly tried to help her, and even coped the abuse of being told to shut up when he was trying to convey she should warn some others entering the water.  I hadn't seen Sully in anything else but loved his work, you can check out his profile on IMDB on his link as one of the few actors in this film.

The ending wasn't the greatest, her plan relied on predicting the shark's behaviour down to the second, but you never really see great endings with this sort of man verse creature movie.  There's also a fire scene earlier in the film that really makes no sense unless a whale carcass is somehow highly flammable.  Not sure why set this in Mexico when it the external visuals were filmed on Lord Howe Island in Australia (the rest on a flooded sound stage on the Gold Coast). There's plenty of shark attacks here in Australia, why not just set the movie here.  She still could have been an American, trying to find some remote beach her mother visited in the 90's.

But it's faults aside, this was still a really entertaining movie and a great contribution to the human verse relentless animal killer movie genre.",1481846400,,2999,4.403254972875226

7786897,3,B01HH7KC60,"Good premise, good cinematography , great acting and a good attempt at trying to create a tense feeling ..... BUT .... one problem......
Far too unrealistic to be truly frightening.

The shark in this movie seems to have been given a brain transplant with a human serial killer's brain.
Totally unrealistic shark behaviour that gets more over the top as the movie goes along.

By the time we reach the finale, it has gone way over the line into being outright silly and almost campy with several unbelievable acts of nature , circumstances and images.
Imagine a shark being given the brain of Michael Myers or Freddy Kreuger and that is how this shark behaves.
I think it was a matter of trying TOO HARD to be frightening and thus getting a bit silly.

I feel if they had been more realistic with the shark behaviour and shifted to other elements of the survival challenge (infection, sun exposure, lack of food and water , a longer time stranded, etc .... it would have been a more powerful film instead of trying to make it ""Girl -vs - Super-intelligent, mentally demented and obsessed shark on steroids.""",1481328000,,1107,4.666666666666667

7786904,4,B01HH7KC60,"I am a huge Jaws fan and didn't have high expectations for this movie. The trailer looked good, but it's competing with Jaws, after all. Still, my nephew recommended it, so I picked it up on Black Friday. I was very pleasantly surprised. It's a good show.

The filming of the water is beautiful. The underwater shots, in particular, took my breath away. I love the ocean and this film displays its beauty wonderfully.

I thought Blake Lively did a good job portraying Nancy, the med student/ surfer girl.(I was impressed by her preparations for the film as talked about in the special features.) I liked that this character used her training to deal with her wounds and with the shark. I like strong female characters who try (and hopefully succeed) to deal with a situation rather than passively waiting for help to arrive.

I have read in several reviews that other people found the movie unrealistic. Their points are probably completely valid, but I knew I wasn't watching a documentary and didn't bother trying to dissect this feature with logic.

7786910,4,B01HH7KC60,"Brilliant shark movies are rare to come across nowadays. The first Jaws set the bar for this sub-genre (and perhaps the summer blockbuster, for that matter), but you can say that its legacy was somewhat tarnished by the sequels, especially the last two. Infamous schlock films like Shark Attack 3: Megalodon and Mega Shark vs Giant Octopus proven to be insultingly terrible. And even though contemporary movies like Sharknado and Deep Blue Sea are too unintentionally hilarious for us to hate, you have to admit that the shark movie sub-genre is ripe for a good representation during these times. Enter The Shallows, which was directed by Jaume Collet-Serra. In this film, Nancy (Blake Lively) goes on a surfing vacation to an island that is secluded, but has a significant memory tied to her late mother. As she catches a late wave, she gets attacked by a shark and left stranded on a rock in the middle of the ocean. Nancy has to use only her smarts and skills to find a way back to shore. The Shallows isn't just an excuse to show off lead actress Blake Lively in a bikini. It's a female-centered version of All Is Lost, the 2013 solo sea-survival movie featuring Robert Redford. While Blake Lively isn't the lone acting talent in the movie, she uses the solo time she has to command the screen with a passionate, intelligent performance, along with a small amount of help from a seagull called Steven Seagull (think of it as her own version of Cast Away's Wilson). In a role where she finally gets to shine, Blake gets to kick the ocean's butt and look pretty good doing it. It also helps that the film itself looks pretty good as well. The cinematography's vividly and colorfully alive, the digital effects puts the electronic devices to good use, displaying the surface screens of the cell phone apps and the stopwatch as pop-up projections, the action scenes come packed with intensity, and the script keeps a short, yet simple story going without any drifting. At a running time of 86 minutes, The Shallows is slim, trim, and to the point, resulting in possibly the best shark movie in over 40 years.

7786921,5,B01HH7KC60,"I would confidently describe this Great White shark focussed film as the best of its kind since ""Jaws"" (1975). It has been cleverly crafted to make us feel intensely concerned for the safety and survival of young surfer Nancy (played by Blake Lively). The running time for my DVD is 83 minutes and for at least 60 minutes of that time Nancy is under threat or subjected to ferocious attacks by a massive Great White shark.

The cinematography, both above and below water, deserves the highest marks. It can be fairly said that the film has some truly frightening moments, and the sense of unrelenting menace creates almost unbearable tension and raises this film above many shark films on a scare factor rating. ""The Shallows"" has been brilliantly filmed, and recreates ferocious attacks on surfers by a huge Great White shark with frightening realism. The shark and its ferocity have been depicted with incredible faithfulness to the attack mode of Great White sharks, and this film lifts CGI depiction of the Great White to a new high level of realism.

The product of at least 15 million years of evolution, the Great White is probably the most intelligent shark in the sea, and noted for its ability to lift its head out of the water to appraise its prey in small boats or those who are hunting it, and this frightening characteristic was accurately depicted in ""Jaws"". The film makers have not erred in placing this monster in the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico. A careful Google check will show that Great Whites have been frequenting the Gulf of Mexico in greater numbers over recent years.

Another urban myth, fostered by some marine biologists, would have us believe that Great Whites attack humans in the mistaken belief that they are seals, but this view ignores the fact that Great Whites have very good eyesight and could not possibly mistake a human on a surfboard for a seal. Viewers can safely discount any suggestion that the Great White in this film was mistaking surfboard riders for seals, but we cannot discount the very real possibility, suggested by Nancy herself, that the shark was protecting its territory and its food source (a dead whale) by ferociously attacking intruders. Compelling evidence to support Nancy's view that the shark was killing to protect its whale food source, rather than to supplement that whale food with humans, can be found in the discovery of a largely intact dead human body by Carlos close to the water line.

Nancy seeks refuge from the shark on an offshore metal buoy and we are shown ferocious attacks by the shark on the buoy as it attempts to reach her behind her makeshift cage. Some viewers might question whether a Great White would attack a metal cage-like object protecting a human as fiercely as depicted in this film, but the Great White is notorious for attacking and crunching metal objects with its teeth, especially when the metal is a cage protecting divers or a small metal boat. Great Whites have torn outboard motors off small boats.

I strongly recommend this film to those who like their shark films to be both exciting, frightening, and realistic.",1480636800,,3129,4.808550185873606

Of course, there is but 1 problem with this tropical paradise:  a rogue Great White shark has chosen the lagoon as his own private hunting grounds, unbeknownst to some surfers who just want to catch some waves.  Nancy (Blake Lively) is a beautiful blonde with an athletic, beach-ready bikini body.  That plays into her favor in this story as she needs every bit of strength & adrenaline she can muster to outwit the shark.

 Generally, sharks simply hunt for food.  If they end up gobbling you up, it is simply because they're hungry ~ it's nothing personal.  This shark, however, is cut from a different cloth.  It seems to have an extreme dislike for humans & is intent on finishing off any human it attacks.  Oh, and it is relentless.  It sort of takes on the guise of an aquatic Michael Myers or Jason:  it just keeps coming.  Ultimately, this is a contest between a bikini clad Texan and a ruthless, sadistic, man-eating Great White.  Boy, do I ever feel sorry for that shark!!!",1480550400,,1217,4.4840182648401825

7786948,5,B01HH7KC60,"Director Jaume Collet-Serra's accomplishment here cannot be understated recalling the work of Hitchcock and Spielberg.  This is more than an homage because Collet-Serra injects his own artistry to the proceedings.  The tension on display is palpable building to a crescendo resulting in a satisfying conclusion.  It's not just the great white shark that portends danger.  You also have the jagged coral reef, jellyfish, and the rising and lowering of the tides.  This is also a case of an actress being in synch with a filmmaker's unique vision.  Blake Lively much like Brie Larson in last year's ""Room"" is called upon to virtually carry the film by herself and she does a masterful job.  Lively assays the gamut of emotions her character goes through amidst the harrowing peril she finds herself in.  It's a full bodied performance and the strength in Lively's portrait is demonstrating Nancy's toughness, ingenuity, and intestinal fortitude. Nancy's friendship with the wounded seagull recalls Tom Hanks' relationship with the inanimate Wilson volleyball in ""Castaway"".  It's not the kind of work the awards givers recognize but that doesn't diminish its formidability.  Lastly the great white shark that the effects people manufactured is genuinely fearsome more than the mechanical one Spielberg utilized in ""Jaws"" some forty years ago.

The shark moves a bit faster than what we usually see of Great Whites in documentaries or even ""Jaws"".  But mostly, the entire ordeal comes off as being fairly realistic. There is one scene that is pretty unbelievable and this somewhat undermines the rest of the film towards the end.  Other than that though, it's a good watch and a fairly scary movie.  You may want to be careful if you have kids because there are some rather intense and bloody moments; but again, these add to the reality of the movie.  If you were scared or bothered and yet enjoyed ""Open Water"" - Well, this is somewhat like ""Open Water"" meets ""Jaws"". With better special effects.  The shark looks quite real.
If not for the one scene (I won't spoil it for you - But you'll catch it) I mentioned, this would be a pretty great movie.  However; this one short scene takes the movie down a notch and spoils what would otherwise have been a pretty decent shark movie.  It's still good.

7786985,4,B01HH7KC60,"I really enjoyed this movie. I have read some less than stellar reviews and I am I just don't get them. I thought Blake Lively did a wonderful job having to pretty much carry the movie. Her character was smart. At times you could see the wheels spinning as she was trying to think her way out of the situation. The scenery was incredible. It's worth seeing just for that alone. If there was complaint, it was the Shark. CGI is great when it's used to enhance a practical effect. When that's pretty much all there is, it becomes obvious that's a CGI shark. It was, however, well done. It's just that I'm not a fan of CGI. That being said the shark was otherwise fine. It looked like big scary Great White shark.

As someone that has watched Shark Week every year since it began, I love sharks. I know some people that complain when sharks are made out to be the bad guy. I get it. I also get that it's just a movie. The producers took great care in their marketing to express that sharks are not monsters, they're not evil, they are just trying to survive like everything else on this planet. Blake Lively even makes mention of something similar in the spacial features. And, before the film came out, she talked about that very thing during last summer's Shark Week.

And, speaking of special features, I do wish it had more. But, what is there is really good and informative. I was amazed to learn that the stunningly beautiful island they filmed on wasn't the coastline of some South American paradise. It was actually shot off the coast of Australia on Lord Howe Island. Lot's of fun facts and behind the scenes tidbits to enjoy.

This movie has action but it's not an action movie. It's a story movie. It's more about thinking, it puts you on that rock in the shallows and makes you wonder, ""How would I get off this rock."" Personally, I think this movie is closer in comparison to Castaway than it is to Jaws.

7787014,3,B01HH7KC60,"If you don't have some idea of the basic story line from the DVD cover alone, well, you're just not paying attention.

I have to say right off that I have no idea how to rate this film, it could easily be anything from 1-star to 5-stars.  I have to give the film makers credit - the opening scene was gripping and entirely in character with the way white sharks hunt.  As for the movie as a whole, it hits all the right buttons for a thriller - isolated location, scary villain, beautiful heroine and a treacherous situation with shocking jump-out scenes, but the story wears thin after about an hour.  It's almost like they developed this situation then hadn't planned how to wrap things up.  I could tell it was starting to drag and sag because this was when I started watching the clock to see how much longer this could go on.  That's when I was grateful to see the the film has a run time of less than 90 mins.

I tried and tried to suspend reality as I watched, you know like you usually have to do while watching most sci-fi and many action movies, but I just couldn't do it.  In full disclosure I'm a marine scientist so I am usually a push-over when it comes to movies about the sea and I'm usually especially interested when sharks are involved, but as this film progressed I told myself over and over again that while a shark COULD act this way, they just don't.  As the shark's behavior became more and more contrived our eyes rolled more and more.

OK, let's get down to it...do white sharks ever attack people?  Yes, they sometimes do.  Are these deliberate attacks on humans?  Well, they may be deliberate attacks but evidence shows that most attacks are cases of mistaken identity often mistaking a human on a surf board for a marine mammal like a seal or sea lion at the water surface.  Is there any evidence of sharks being vindictive or vengeful (you'll see why I say this when you watch the movie)?  As far as I know, no, no evidence for this.

There were just too many inconsistencies for me to buy in.  For one, if a large white shark had an entire whale carcass floating there it would spend it's time eating instead of patrolling the area.  A large white shark can slice off chunks of whale blubber and meat the size of entire hams in one bite.  It would gorge itself on whale meat...white sharks have been observed doing this.  That's not to say that you'd be entirely safe in the water in that situation, because you wouldn't be, but just not in danger the way the movie portrays things.

Don't get me wrong about sharks, they are highly evolved and especially well adapted predators.  They have been among the top predators in the oceans of the world for literally hundreds of millions of years, but they simply do not act like the one in this film is portrayed.  This is sadly another movie that, like ""Jaws"" vilifies sharks and makes them out to be eating machines just cruising the world's oceans looking for humans to eat.  That's just not true.  Even Peter Benchley, author of ""Jaws"" has said that if he knew then what he knows now about sharks he never would have portrayed the shark in his book and movie the way he did.

Back to the movie...I won't give away the thrilling conclusion, but let's just say at the makers of the ""Sharknado"" franchise would have been proud.  In fact, both my wife and I laughed out loud...you'll know when we did that when you watch this movie.

In the end I was sufficiently unimpressed by the film that I couldn't wait to take it back to the place I rented it.

On the plus side, I think that the main character did a great job with what she had to work with.  I liked how she talked herself through things and she was a strong character, professional, competent...all pluses...it's just too bad that this was the film she ended up in.

All in all this movie is a combination of being a great thriller and laughably unbelievable.

Though part of me wants to give this movie one star, the acting was IMO actually quite good so I have to take the middle ground and give it 3-stars.  ""It's OK,"" but I don't need to see this movie again.",1475625600,,4099,4.37962962962963

7787017,3,B01HH7KC60,"I'd give it a four for the acting and for the overall quality of the picture and the basic idea.  However, the plot is something one would expect from a horror movie.  The personal decisions of all the actors but the young boy who found the Go-Pro and his father who finally rescued the girl and took her to the beach in the first place.  Both of them had common sense.  All other actors acted like they had brain dis-connects and great amounts of stupidity to get themselves in trouble.  My dad was in the Sea Bees during WWII in the South Pacific so I have been well aware of the danger of sharks in shallow water from the stories he told me about his trials during the war.  I really like deep sea fishing but I won't swim in shallow ocean water.  So, I expect surfers to know the difference.  The star of the movie did not display any common sense at the beginning of the movie and she was nearly killed.  She got a lot smarter as the movie progressed but if she had used her head, she probably never would nearly have died.",1475539200,4,1028,4.204081632653061
7787018,2,B01HH7KC60,"After a slew of good reviews from critics and much audience buzz, I expected this to be much more than it was. This movie left me bored half of the time and only mildly entertained the rest of it. The beginning of the film is an unpleasant mix of teenage surfer flick (complete with annoying techno-pop tracks which killed any tension that needed to be built up front) and Hallmark movie-of-the-week drama fluff. I understand her struggle with being a fighter, and I think it worked well enough for this plot, but it just was not presented in a way that I found appealing at all. Many people have written about how ""Jaws""-like the shark is, held away from view just enough. And while this is technically well done (the shadows are useful for building suspense by withholding the shark's full look) it does not have the same gravitas that one expects from that kind of approach (the shadows were very obvious, no subtlety, and the technique felt very technical and run-of-the-mill).

I'll give it enough credit to say that it did build some tension when she is racing the shark from one place to another. Another good point was that you were never entirely sure when the shark was going to finally just lunge out of the water at her. I was not entirely enthralled though, and these things have been done in better monster or man-vs.-nature movies. Sadly, I found it all rather predictable. Ever play the app ""Hungry Shark"" or any of its spin-off apps? The plot felt like it was taken from a person playing that game for the first time (even the jellyfish!).

Then the ending brings us right back to the same Hallmark and teen drama stuff I had hoped we'd left behind.

Ultimately, I bet this will be a happy departure from SyFy Channel shark films and all their goofiness, getting shark movie fans back to a serious shark film. Sadly, I cannot say this film was anything more than technically good. Even the scenery, which was shot well, got boring after they reuse the same shots over and over. I didn't feel like I wanted my money back, but I cannot say I felt that this was an hour and a half well-spent. I was rooting for the shark after 15 minutes just so the movie would end.",1475539200,,2180,4.5

7787025,3,B01HH7KC60,"There was plenty of suspense and the storyline was fairly decent, but the graphics in the movie took away from a lot of it. I would venture to say that half of the movie was made using CGI and it was noticeable. You could easily tell when graphics were used. For a movie that was hyped up, this felt like an above average low budget movie.

This movie is essentially about a young woman, who is struggling to figure out her future after the passing of her mother. So, she visits a remote beach in Mexico to go surfing and ends up putting herself in the path of a great white shark. This shark has an amazing appetite for humans apparently. The ending basically comes down to whether or not she can outsmart the great white shark; I won't ruin the ending for you.

Blake Lively was alright, but I'm pretty sure they picked her more for how she looked in a bikini and her name. It's not to say her acting was bad, which it wasn't. But as stated earlier, this movie felt low budget compared to other movies out currently.",1475366400,2,1018,4.296875

7787027,5,B01HH7KC60,"I collect Shark movies and Shark Week DVDs, pretty much anything to do with great white sharks, I love, and let me tell you, this movie is amazing! The CGi shark is beautiful in its rendering, it appears just like the real thing, swift, fierce, and graceful as well as relentless and terrifying, yet at times when you get an overview shot you can't help but marvel at the beauty of this ancient predator that outlived the dinosaurs.  At times, yes, the animal in this film seems relentless to the extreme, but  I think based on the injury to its mouth shown by the helmet camera, we are to believe it was severe wounded by a spear fisherman or diver and the animal has gone rogue as a result, explaining his  repeated attacks on surfers while ignoring the massive. Humpback whale carcass floating nearby. Considering sharks use those carcasses as feeding grounds and it draws several of them in at once, honestly I would have to think the sheer size of this animal and his overly aggressive nature must have been so intense he scared the other white sharks off.

Blake Lively is lovely and enthralling in her role, not merely a scream queen prone to shock and hysteria, but rather a smart, calculating, believable heroine worthy of being rooted for. (Although, I do always cheer the shark on too)  some people complain that her backstory is too convent or detracts from the thriller pace of the film, but honestly if she were not proficient at medical studies how could she have believably survived that long with so much blood loss and such a severe wound? People need to remember that most shark victimless are not eaten, they die from blood loss and bacterial infection.  Also, why would we care if she lived or not if she has no empathetic backstory? Okay, admittedly, most people will love her just because she talks to and saves the seagull, but I digress.

Regardless, I consider this possibly the best shark thriller yet produced, and yes, I'm saying it is better than Jaws, because while the acting was superb in Jaws and it is an eternal classic,  come on, he blew the shark up with a shotgun and s scuba tank! It's not only impossible, it's overkill, and we all know it. At very least, this is the best shark film since Deep Blue Sea, and it revives my faith in Hollywood after that mess that has been the hilarious but also horrible Sharnado trilogy.

I would highly recommend it, because it does the animals justice for their cunning, beauty, and grace, and it's also riveting and fun, and just the right amount of gasp worthy gore without becoming and over the top blood bath, and if nothing else, the scenery, the dolphins, the crystal clear water, the surfing!

7787035,4,B01HH7KC60,"Believe it or not its been 41 years since JAWS was released to theaters. That movie has become a classic, as thrilling a ride today as it was all those years ago. Since then a few movies about sharks have come and gone, most of them low budget films or the occasional sharks in a tornado. Now along comes a movie that tries to take the fear of sharks to a new intensity. Does THE SHALLOWS work?

Blake Lively plays Nancy, a young woman trying to find herself after the recent death of her mother. Shes left behind her father and younger sister as well as her medical schooling. Vacationing in Mexico and trying to locate a beach her mother told her of, a beautiful shore that offers tremendous surfing. Her friend having ditched her for partying in their hotel, Nancy is taken by a guide to the beach and left to discover its beauty.

She suits up, grabs her surfboard and heads out into the water. Once on the waves she meets two guys also there for the surfing, one with a GoPro camera mounted on a helmet. They strike up a cordial camaraderie on the waves and enjoy the great surfing there. Nancy goes in for a while and then heads back out while the other two head to shore.

Once back on the waves Nancy sees something in the distance. She paddles her board over to it to discover its a whales thats been partially eaten by a predator with a large bite. Realizing she might be in danger she tries to head for shore only to be sideswiped and bitten by the huge shark responsible for the dead whale. Gathering her wits and climbing up on the whale, she watches as her broken board drifts away. She calls to the two fellow surfers about the leave the shallows to no avail.

With a lacerated leg she waits until the timing is right and swims to a nearby rock formation only to cut her foot on the jagged coral at its base. The coral and the tide moving out were things she was warned of. Now, with leg and foot bleeding, she must use every resource she has to survive. Her first effort is to stop the bleeding from her leg, a rather gruesome sight for some.

On the small outcropping barely 8 feet wide, she makes a friend of sorts in a seagull with a broken wing. As the pair struggle to survive, 200 yards from shore, Nancy will find out if she has the determination that made her mother a survivor in life and a woman who faced death with courage. Various events happen during her time on the outcropping including the attempted rescue by her two new friends, an attempted rescue by a drunk and her eventual decision to swim to a life buoy nearby in hopes of finding something she can use to survive.

So lets talk about the shake first. Most of us recall the mechanical shark we grew up watching in the movie JAWS. It was terrifying at the time but subsequent viewings have made it seem not quite what it seemed that first time around. With the effects capabilities we now have today a CGI shark not only looks real but is far more capable of feats and actions that the mechanical one couldn't accomplish. Does it work? I would say yes. When viewed from above looking straight down it is an enormous beast of a great white shark. The attack moments will put you on seats edge. So yes, it works.

Lively does a great job without someone to toss lines back and forth to. Her acting skills are used to display what this character does in order to survive as opposed to just looking pretty. The combination of pain from wounds and determination not to die alone on a small rock make her performance one that stands out and yet will no doubt never be nominated for anything. Perhaps its not Oscar material but its better than some Ive seen win.

What really makes this movie work is that it is an old movie. By that I mean that it is made like movies used to be made. The story slowly unfolds. The desperation seen by Nancy isn't something that lingers only on the immediate situation but plays out over the 80 some minutes of the film. Its never rushed, the movie never presses forward at breakneck speed in order to placate MTV generation film goers with fast and furious images. Instead it takes the time to tell a story.

THE SHALLOWS is a movie I could see watching again. It entertained from start to finish. It kept you guessing what would happen next. In todays world there is no guarantee that the star will survive. Another shark film, OPEN WATER showed that. And perhaps this one does too. I won't spoil that for you. Youll have to watch to find out if all of Nancys attempts to make it through this have a happy ending or not. Dont worry, it will be worth the watch.",1475107200,2,4578,4.326340326340326

Now, with a severely bitten leg and a tiny rock just above the water line Nancy must survive long enough for someone to find her, but she isn't the only one fighting for survival. This is a very tense movie that is scary in the fact that this is something that could actually happen. Looking back on the movie I realized there wasn't a whole lot of dialog but I didn't notice it when I was watching. You really feel for her and live and die with every scene. I found myself holding my breath in certain spots and actually willing her to survive. That is the sign of a good movie.

7787044,5,B01HH7KC60,"I thought (The Shallows) was a good addition to the ""There's something deadly in the water"" genre. The scenery was beautiful ,as it was filmed in Australia and not Mexico, the location it is supposed to take place.

(Blake Lively) who plays Nancy, a  busy young woman finally gets to go to a section of beach in Mexico that her deceased mother said was Paradise before she died. Apparently the location is somewhat of a secret to keep tourists away,even  a nice local named Carlos (Oscar Jaenada) won't tell her the name of the beach but drops her off there.

Nancy just wants to catch some tasty waves but unfortunately she gets more than she bargained for when a great white ""comparable to the size of the shark in Jaws"" attacks her and she has to try and survive for almost 48 hours wounded, thirsty and weak!

(Blake Lively) is very attractive and looks great in a bikini so the director takes full advantage of this with much of the camera time devoted to her. There are thrills and some chills and even a little gore for a PG-13 film. Most of the time is spent watching Nancy plot to outwit or out swim the shark.

The shark itself looks good ,not like the horrible SyFy shark movie variety. It's a really good shark movie but I enjoyed (Bait 3D) & (The Reef) just as much.

Bottom line,If you want to see plenty of (Blake Lively) up close and personal in a bikini ,beautiful scenery and a good shark attack flick,I recommend it.",1474329600,6,1435,4.433460076045628

7787057,3,B01HH7KC60,"No thanks to SyFy for turning sharks into laughable sideshow acts with their ridiculous Sharknado movies, but it's good to be reminded that we're actually supposed to be terrified of these aquatic predators. That's what Jaume Collet-Serra's survival thriller The Shallows does, to modest effect anyway, by having a lone surfer come face-to-nose with a hungry shark. The setup is lean, the star is Blake Lively, and for 60 of its 80+ minute runtime the film has some serious teeth, until the final stretch bites off more than it can chew.

Lively, whose stark Hollywood beauty causes many to either hate or underestimate her, commits fully to the role of Nancy, a Texas gal on vacation in Mexico to surf a beach that held special relevance to her late mother. Everything we need to know about her is wrapped up in five minutes: med school dropout, kind of a boring homebody, strained relationship with her father. What more do we need to know? Get to the ""Shark Week"" portion of the show, already.

It doesn't take long. Nancy hits the waves with a couple local dudes, but decides to stick around for just one more ride. It's the cinematic equivalent of ""one last job""; it always goes sideways. Literally in this case as Nancy is knocked off her board by a massive and seemingly-brilliant shark that proceeds to chomp through her leg. Much of the film finds Nancy stuck on a rock, bleeding, contemplating her escape options, and conversing with an injured seagull. There's a chance you may care more about the seagull than Nancy, or at least just as much.

Cinematographer Flavio Labiano knows what he has in Lively as his camera never stays away from her beach body for too long. But she's more than just a pretty face, adapting to some of the film's cornier elements, such as the chatty relationship she has with her feathered companion, and fully committing to the physical aspects.  The most difficult of those to stomach is Nancy's improvised stitching of her wounds, using pretty much whatever she can find. It's not pretty, but it goes to establishing Nancy as smart and resourceful when in an unusual jam, and they don't get much more unusual than this.

Screenwriter Anthony Jaswinski finds humor in some unusual places, such as a potential savior who turns out to be a drunken, larcenous bum; or a flare gun that might as well have been designed by ACME. What Jaswinski doesn't do is trust that the shark is enough of a menace on its own. The final stretch, in which Nancy confronts the beast in a last ditch effort to survive, is piled on with one unbelievable aspect after another to artificially raise the stakes. What had been a tense, taut thriller about one woman's attempt to outsmart a primal force becomes something to be chuckled at. The Shallows isn't quite scary enough to keep you out of the water, but it'll at least make you think twice about it.",1470182400,32,2870,4.6978131212723655

7787059,3,B01HH7KC60,"The Shallows is a pretty decent movie, of course any movie about sharks will always be compared to JAWS and have similarities.  Hollywood just cant help itself but put in references like the red channel marker buoy and flare gun scenes along with the sharks front dorsal fin above the water for half the movie.  At least the Shallows is interesting if not predictable and like the film Open Water gives us some suspense and succeeds in what it is aiming for a more realistic ocean experience.

I enjoyed the movie and would recommend the film.  For  of the movie I thought it was very good then the climax seemed utterly ridiculous and nearly derailed the whole movie.  I felt like ok here comes the Hollywood BS part instead of a more realistic ending.  (AE Visions of the shark eating the helicopter in Jaws 2 type of thing).

The film gets a lot of the mood correct it is terrifying not knowing what is beneath you.  Watching Blakes character get beat up by the coral and cut herself I found very well done and totally realistic the ocean is not a flat sandy plane it is full of different shapes and rock formations.  The movie shines in that area the rock that she gets stranded would be very dangerous besides the shark circling.  What was the name of the beach I don't think we are ever told maybe it was big white shark cove.

Minor spoilers ahead don't read if you haven't seen the movie

I thought the CGI dolphin fake scare scene was kind of ridiculous and just thrown in there.  It would have made more sense if it were sting rays or a sea turtle that live that close to a reef especially off the gulf coast.  It would have been nice to see the weather elements take more of a toll on her.  At night freezing was correct they did get that right, but I was expecting her to be sun burned from all the sun exposure on that rock.  Her face and arms would be bright red like a hot tamales candy after several hours in direct sunlight her lips would be chapped and bleeding.  Eating that crab would make her throw up like crazy especially with all the acid in that little thing.

I was waiting for that seagull to be chomped to bits by the shark once she sent it adrift on the surf board.  I was thinking maybe she would use the seagull as a diversion to make it to the bouy or make a break to swim towards shore if she could get enough distance knowing where the sharks location was.  It is highly unlikely the great white would be on the surface for half the movie.  Sharks are not whales and don't need to come up for air.  Maybe if Blake saw a seal near the surface of the water get eaten with the shark coming up like a torpedo would have been cool to let the audience know it is still out there.  I liked the surfer scene when one gets chomped right out of the water but I was thinking the other dude should have turned around and paddled back to shore instead of out to sea where the chick was stranded out on the rock, kind of stupid logic going further out to sea instead of in towards the shallow water.

So what did we learn from this experience kids if you see a dead whale floating in the ocean get the hell out of the water and on dry land.  In reality there would probably be a school of sharks pecking and eating that corpse the ocean is not like the savanna where only the biggest lion is in the area.  More likely there would be sand sharks, blues and tiger sharks eating that whale carcass as well.  Another thing it sure seemed to take forever for the high tide to come back in.  I thought it was every 12 hours not a full day for the tide to come in.

It would have been nice to see Blakes character lose her leg from gang green at the end of the movie and not go back in the water again.  Instead of the happy happy joy joy ending the director chose.  More likely is that she would be terrified ever to go back in the water again and have reoccurring nightmares waking up in cold sweats from the traumatic experience.  Or go the other route and have her make a mad swim to shore and not make it having the shark get her yards before making it to the shoreline similar to  Creepshow 2 with the pool of sludge trapping some swimmers on a floating dock.

Overall I may seem a bit nit picky about the movie, but it is a decent film I would rate it 4 stars.  Much better than Deep Blue Sea which was garbage and Sharknado which is a comedy, but it does not have the realism of Open Water or adventure elements of JAWS.",1468454400,,4441,4.171361502347418

The big surprise is that even if at first sight""The Shallows"" feels a bit formulaic, the truth is that this is how you do a shark movie right! (This is for you, Shark Night).
Blake Lively already proved that she can do drama with The Age of Adaline, and this time she proves she can do horror as Nancy, a young woman that finds herself trapped at the middle of the ocean, with a shark lurking out there waiting very patiently to have her as his meal.
The movie builds up fast, and there are a lot of tension moments that will keep you at the edge of your seat, the special effects are stunningly made, and there's not any dull moment during the whole movie, but the best thing about it is that Blake Lively proves again that she can carry a movie by herself and that she can do pretty much any role flawlessly, providing a believable performance. It's been a while for me to see a horror movie that had me covering my face with my hands, screaming and leaving the theater feeling completely satisfied!

She decides to go to the Mexican beach where her mother was at her happiest to surf and forget her troubles. They follow her anyway as her sister calls her wondering why she's basically run away and her father laments over her decision to drop out of med school. Nancy brushes them off, enjoying the sun and surfing the waves. The locals go home for the day, but she wants just one more wave. She stumbles upon a whale carcass and the shark that killed it. Trapped on a rock in the shallows of the sea, Nancy struggles to find the will to live and ways to outsmart this killer shark.

The Shallows has an interesting concept and a different visual style. The shark is a metaphor for Nancy's grief and likely depression. If she sits idle, she can't move forward in her life and lets the grief consume her. This film has more in common with movies like Gravity and The Babadook than Jaws. The idyllic setting contrasted well with the violence. Although a fairly minor point, I liked how the images on her phone screen and watch were displayed. It was clear and different than I've seen. The visual effects are pretty good. The shark in particular looked realistic and Nancy's physical deterioration and injuries were impressive. Unfortunately, this is about all the film has going for it.

The movie would have been better as a short. So much of the film is stagnant. The first bit of the film is filled with creepy, lingering shots of Blake Lively's body. The latter half of the film has her laying on a rock doing pretty nothing for way too long. The plot is very basic and is stretched thin to fill the length of a short feature length film. While the shark seems to be largely metaphorical, it would be nice if the shark attacks made sense. Nancy is pulled under by the shark, but only has a rather large gash on her leg to show for it. Others are bit in half by the massive shark's jaws, so her injury doesn't really make sense. The ending is overly saccharine and unsatisfying.

The Shallows could have been a fun thriller, but a lack of momentum, dull and static scenes, and unrealistic leaps in logic make it a fairly unenjoyable film. The theater experience was also awful as a bunch of bored eight year olds chatted loudly through the entire film. I was fooled by the hype and the generally positive reviews.",1468022400,3,2396,4.478260869565218
7787063,5,B01HH7KC60,"Theatrical review. Possible spoilers. For me the summer blockbuster season has been a disappointment. Numerous sequels, super-hero retreads and the usual string of horror films has left me wanting. Then out of nowhere comes this one woman vs. a Great White thriller and Im revitalized. Blake Lively co-stars with a big sharka really big shark and a wounded Sea Gull named Steve in 87 minutes of white knuckle terror.

Nancy (Lively) has dropped out of medical school, overwhelmed with grief after her mother dies battling cancer. Shes decided to go to a remote beach in Mexico, where it is quiet, beautiful and has some great waves. Nancy is an experienced surfer as was her mother and this was one of Mom's favorites spots. The young woman she came to Mexico with is hung over and stayed in the hotel. So its just Nancy and the ocean.

Dropped off by a local named Carlos (Oscar Jaenada) Nancy takes in a couple waves and meets briefly with a 2 young surfers. They leave and she decides to make one last ride. While waiting for the right wave, Nancy notices gulls circling a whale carcass and decides to get a closer look. Bad idea. Shes just intruded on a Great Whites dinner plans. Recognizing her mistake that she might be dessert, she heads for shore, only a couple hundred yards away. She doesnt make it but manages to climb on a small rock island, her leg bitten and with several other cuts and bruises from coral and other collisions.

The film directed by Jaume Collet-Serra has some great photography, both above and below the water. As anyone who has ever seen Jaws knows, the greatest seat squirming tension occurs when you don't see everything. A shadow here, then there. A dorsal fin coming at you then disappearing. Trapped on the island for a night, Nancy knows her injuries are serious and she only has her wits about her, medical and otherwise. As the tide comes in, her little island slowly disappears so she decides to make a 40 yard swim, through a school of jellyfish to an old iron buoy. It is there she will have to make her last stand.

Lively is terrific in the film, armed with only her bikini, a wet-suit top and a few pieces of jewelry, she must use her smarts and will to live to survive. Yes, this is summer fun for the movie goer, but this is much better than your typical B movie affair. Highly recommended.",1467936000,41,2340,4.551068883610451
7787064,5,B01HH7KC60,"I just saw this movie today at the cinema and I thought it was awesome.  I love sharks and have been a fan of shark films since I was a kid.  While shark experts might argue that it Is unlikely for a shark to stake out a human being once they've tasted human flesh, I found the movie to be very thrilling and entertaining.  This was not at all like the B productions of Sharknado or Shark Lake or any of those films.  I'm not sure what those who said it was saw, they didn't see this movie.  I'm looking forward to owning this movie for sure and will watch it many times.  I totally loved the story and concept and the cinematography was gorgeous.",1467849600,,647,4.136
7787065,3,B01HH7KC60,"Action and Horror newcomer Jaume Collet-Serra brings audiences an innovative aquatic thriller that is heavy on drama and suspense, thanks entirely to a stellar performance from lead actress Blake Lively, but a bit light on the science and plausibility.  This is Castaway meets Jaws, in many ways, with Lively consuming most of the screen time and rightfully so.  The director crafts a visually stunning indie style film that captivates from its first scene to its nail-biting, seat clinging conclusion.  With an ample supply of believable twists and convincing unpredictability, mixed with genuine performances, this could quickly become Collet-Serra's best feature.  This is how you create real tension and thorough audience engagement.  If it were not for some of the more glaring scientific inaccuracies, this would have been an absolute win and very possibly the Jaws for the next generation.  A movie you can truly sink your mental teeth into....and, yes, I just went there.",1467763200,2,979,5.324675324675325

#1 I'm a Blake Lively fan she is America's Sweetheart. #2 I like movies where the scenes are in a remote location #3 I love movies with a lot of water.

Ok, for people that like water sports I'm sure you know once you enter the water you are no longer top of the food chain! That being said there is a chance that you might be eaten or severely hurt.

Very good movie, however I was shocked when she approached the dead whale knowing it would attract predators. I watch shark week and this is a fact sharks/dolphins/whales etc can smell blood or rotted flesh miles away.

The story-line is extremely simple beautiful girl travels to Mexico to surf on a remote island where her late mother visited. During her visit she enjoys herself, surfing and enjoying the view. Until a great white shark joins the party.",1467763200,2,830,4.440789473684211
7787067,4,B01HH7KC60,"In hopes of reconnecting spiritually when her deceased mother, Nancy visits a hidden beach in Mexico and spends the day surfing. Unfortunately, she ends up in the feeding ground of a large Great White Shark. Suddenly, Nancy finds herself stranded on a large rock in the ocean, not very far from land, but the shark has no plans on letting her leave.

In wake of the cheesy and not even remotely serious shark films weve seen on the small screen, and following the disaster that was Shark Night, we are given a new shark film for the big screen. This film, directed by Juame Collet-Serra, is a thrilling survival film that breathes new life into the shark horror subgenre. Its definitely not a body count film like most shark films, although there are a few deaths. This is purely a single person survival story. For the most part, the shark is kept hidden throughout the film until well towards the end. This doesnt ruin the film in any way. Although I do have a problem with CGI shark, and especially the horrible CGI dolphins. Sure, it was a small budget film, but I was hoping for better. That aside, the scene with the shark are very intense.

As for us being stuck on a rock with our main character the whole time, it works just fine, because she really doesnt stay on the rock the whole entire time. She tries to use her wits to try escape, but fails several times, and thanks to the short running time. The thrills are there but what I felt the film was lacking was dramatic depth, it had a little bit thrown in, but they could have given our lead character much more background in order for us to see her become stronger. Instead all we get is that her mom died, and as a result she drops out of medical school. Had it shown how genuinely her moms death affected or some other type of event, the drama could have been used to make the character of Nancy, while very likable, but more rounded. However, my biggest complaint comes in the final action sequence in which Nancy faces off with the shark. It does have all the ingredients to make this sequence thrilling, but at the end of it, it had me groaning with how far fetched it was in the sense that no one would think of doing the things her character did. I just find it hard to believe that humans are that smart, and it just made the character seem slightly less realistic.

Blake Lively carries the movie perfectly. She can easily play the strong female lead with ease, and with the little dramatic scenes she does have, she does make you feel for the character. Oh, and she has great chemistry with her seagull companion Steven Seagull.

The Shallows, despite its disappointments, is the shark film we needed to revive the subgenre. Its beautifully directed, acted, and thrilling. Lets hope we can get more shark/aquatic horror films like this, and less like the SyFy channel crap were getting too used to.",1467676800,35,2872,4.48565965583174
7787068,2,B01HH7KC60,"The Shallows had all the feel of a poorly made MTV movie...from the soundtrack to the terrible acting.  It starts out with some really nice cinematography and surfing scenes, but then it drags out too long...it felt like it was nothing but time filler...there was no substance to it at all, nor did it do anything for the movie.

Skipping all the bs, let's get right to the shark.  First off, he's a bit of an jerk...has anger issues for sure.

So we're supposed to believe this shark, for some unknown reason, is REALLY pissed at this girl and will stop at nothing to get her...all the while a huge whale corpse with enough blubber to feed a village is floating 40 yards from her.  Yeah, OK.  And while there's a rotting smorgasbord filling the water with scents of goodness, he's the ONLY shark in the area.  And he wants her.  And only her.  Apparently she did something to REALLY piss off this shark...I must have missed that part.

It's one thing to make a shark out to be ""the bad guy""; however, when you give a shark human traits and expect the audience to buy it, it gets comical.  I was half expecting to see the shark with some tattoos and a pack of smokes rolled up in his sleeve.  Think of a really cheesy movie where the boyfriend is a grease-ball scumbag that won't leave his ex alone...now replace the guy with a shark and the asphalt with water and you have this movie.

This *could* have been a great movie had it not been for the ridiculousness of a lot of scenes.

I gave it 1/5 stars because the first 30 minutes were just so lame...had all the makings of a low-budge MTV piece of garbage.  Terrible, terrible acting...almost laughable.
I then gave it 4/5 stars for a few shark scenes there were really cool.
But then I gave it 1/5 stars for most of the shark scenes that were really, really stupid.  I actually laughed out loud at when she killed the shark....it was really THAT stupid.
Avg it up and it's a 2/5 star movie",1467590400,16,1943,4.355555555555555

8765442,4,B01HH7KC60,"Blake Livelys never really been on my radar in the past.  I knew she starred in the series Gossip Girl (which Ive never watched), is married to Ryan Reynolds, starred in The Age of Adaline and appeared in some internet fashion stories but that was it.  She delivers a strong performance and is more than capable in carrying this thriller from start to finish.  Lively is on camera for the entire film; there are 5 other actors who have about a dozen lines between them and one spunky seagull for her to interact with besides the animatronic/CGI shark.  Its a role similar in some respects to Robert Redfords lost at sea sailor in All is Lost where he is the only person in the entire movie.

  The Shallows is an intense and suspenseful movie that pits an intelligent and resourceful young woman against a great white shark off a lonely Mexican beach.  Nancy takes a break from medical school after the death of her mother and goes on a journey to discover the remote beach where her mom went surfing while pregnant with her.  Nancy finds the secluded beach and hits the waves with only a couple of local surf bums in the area.  The scenery (actually Australia) is spectacular and its an idyllic scene to begin with.  The guys are leaving but she makes the fateful choice to take one more ride when the shark attacks wounding her leg.  She barely escapes to a small rock island where she and a seagull are stranded far from shore with the shark circling.

  The story shows us how a resilient individual can persevere in the face of very daunting odds.  Lively is beautiful and charismatic as she refuses to give up and fights back against the apex predator.  Running about 90 minutes long its just the right length, the situations and her ingenuity feel realistic and you believe these are things you might do if in the same circumstances.  The only weak part is how the shark is dispatched at the end but other than that The Shallows is a thinking viewers shark movie.",1538092800,,1970,4.53257790368272

8765448,5,B01HH7KC60,"The story was really fun to watch. Fun in that anxious & nerve-racking kind of way. It doesnt have the stunning intensity of Jaws but it is still visceral. Jaws had the ability to make you use your imagination to scare yourself. The best movie that does that lately is a quiet place. This movie does not do that. The shark looks great thanks to current special effects. The shark in Jaws can look dated, but its still a great story (& don't you dare pull a George Lucas on Jaws, Mr. Spielberg), & to this day, anytime you hear that theme you know somebodys about to become dinner. This movie doesnt have anything to really make it memorable. Of course there would be comparisons, what did they expect? Jaws is the shark movie that all other movies after it must to live up to. Not happening. After Jaws, I wouldnt get in the swimming pool for quite some time. The ocean was out of the question for years. That phobia lingers to this day and I was on the swim team, I love to swim. And I love the ocean but you won't get me out into it more than knee-deep. Thank you Stephen Spielberg!  Its kind a like what Stephen King said: you know that there is nothing under your bed & if your foot is hanging off the edge, there will be no cold, clammy hand that is going to reach up and grab it, but just the same you make sure its tucked safely under the covers! My boyfriend at the time liked to swim in the dark without the pool light on. That was unacceptable. This movie doesnt quite have the same effect, but is close. Blake Lively is believable in her role: she is strong, intelligent and independent, but still friendly and likable. I don't want to give away any spoilers but, you do get a little tired of cut after scrape after bite after bruise after bump etc. etc. etc.  I found the ending abrupt and unsatisfying. Also, I don't know if any other versions have better extras, but the extras on my copy just sucked.
Then, Of course you have to have the token drunk Mexican, (Thats called racism Mr. producer/director/writer). I say Mexican as I believe she said she was in Mexico, so great big thanks to the writer/producer/director ... that was unnecessary, because not only was he intoxicated but there was also a language barrier. Just having a language barrier would have been just fine. The effect wouldve been the same. It was stupid in the same way it would not be funny to show a Native American Indian in that kind of situation now. (and by that I mean falling down drunk clich type of crap). It does have its flaws and it does have its good points which are mostly all Blake L. If you can find it on sale, get it.
I still enjoyed it, there were just a couple of things I found offensive in our current climate but thats just me.",1533772800,,2738,4.304263565891473
