8596450,2,B00DQUQJTW,"I agree with Movie Lover's review that Soviet Storm is the best series on WWII on the Eastern Front. Unfortunately, this collection is NOT Soviet Storm. If the viewer knows nothing about the Great Patriotic War, this is as good a place as any to start. But it tells the story from the German perspective and includes whiny narratives by German Privates. Soviet Storm goes into much greater depth, the German weapons employment and tactics versus the Red Army employment and tactics, like the anti-armor defenses at Kursk. This film doesnt even mention Rzhev where the Red Army took over 200,000 casualties, but prevented the German mobile armor reserve from reinforcing Stalingrad. It also omits most of the Soviet Generals. Chuikov, Konev, Rokossovsky, Vatutin and many others deserve a place in any history of WWII in the East. Zhukov was a great general, but he did have a little bit of help. It is akin to telling the story of the Western Front centering on Eisenhower and leaving out Montgomery, Bradley, Patton and the rest. Having seen Soviet Storm and thinking this was it, I was very disappointed. If you want to learn about WWII on the Eastern Front don't buy this. Watch Soviet Storm on Youtube.",1466121600,3,1206,4.830917874396135
8596451,2,B00DQUQJTW,"Better than any of these (American broadcasters just borrowed the UK-origin films, which depended on German general memoirs!) is the 2011 Russian-produced ""The Great Patriotic War"" available on YouTube in 18 episodes as ""Soviet Storm.""  After glasnost in the early '90's, the Russians broke their silence, opening up their WWII records to which American military scholar went to study.  This ""Soviet Storm"" series films are fascinating to watch, don't hesitate to include Russian failures.",1432684800,5,489,5.594594594594595
8596452,1,B00DQUQJTW,"The Distributors should be ashamed.
This documentary only uses old and recycled material, that has been seen in many other documentaries. It does not justify the high price, you as a customer has to dish out. The narration for the mildly interested History fans, has the effect of a sleeping pill, nothing new and exciting to be learned here. I only give it 1 star, for the fans that need an introduction to this theater of war, and that where not exposed to other productions, dealing with the eastern front or as the Russians call it: The Great Patriotic War"". And of course for viewers that feel only comfortable with American or British narrations. But I believe they get cheated here too.
If you want to venture out, there are the better Documentaries ""The Unknown War"", ""Blood upon the Snow"", ""Death on the eastern front"", ""World War 2 - The Eastern Front (Region 2 from UK)"" but much better and more elaborate : ""RED ARMY"" (Liberators of the Red Army) released by the UK Discovery Channel. If you feel very curious I highly recommend ""Soviet Storm: WW2 in the East"", A high production Documentary, most modern appliction of CGI special effect, mixed with reenacted scenes, and original footage. The only problem , this Documentary is only available in Russian language on DVD.",1387152000,14,1283,4.783783783783784
