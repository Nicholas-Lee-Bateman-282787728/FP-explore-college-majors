6797801,5,B00PCSVO6E,"This quiet, reflective film is a meditation on how members of a family together and individually grieve the loss of their beloved matriarch. I appreciated the scenes depicting the undertaker and funeral industry, a side of death rarely observed or discussed in American culture. Gorgeous cinematography and superb performances by Robert Graham and cast make this independent feature a real gem.",1423440000,6,394,5.475409836065574
6797802,5,B00PCSVO6E,I saw this movie at the LA film festival.  It was such a beautiful story of a family supporting each other during a trying time.  I'm excited to see it again.  I highly recommend this movie.,1421107200,6,190,4.222222222222222
6797803,5,B00PCSVO6E,"This is a beautiful film about love and loss and family. Amazing cinematography, brilliant acting, and and absolutely touching heartfelt story.",1421107200,6,143,5.857142857142857
6797804,4,B00PCSVO6E,"Long and dragged out story of one man's dealing with grief.  As a chaplain, I worked with people dealing with grief for many years, so the process was not new to me.  Otherwise, if one is interested in understanding the process, this movie a good study on dealing with grief in a time of loss. It would also be a very good movie to use as a discussion group topical study.",1475884800,,372,4.225352112676056

6797807,3,B00PCSVO6E,"So realistic!  ... Very emotional, the professionalism in the attention to detail in the processing of someone recently passed was very well done.",1463875200,,146,5.3478260869565215
6797808,2,B00PCSVO6E,I just couldn't understand why some scenes were necessary to portray this man's loss of his wife. Seemed very obtuse to me.,1463184000,2,123,4.636363636363637

6797813,1,B00PCSVO6E,Very poor quality with no real story other than a man's wife dying and he just stands there with the funeral home rep staring at her. Terrible writing and acting.,1437436800,,162,4.433333333333334
6797814,1,B00PCSVO6E,"Anybody who rates this movie higher than one star should pull their head out of their posterior. HORRIBLE. The only reason I do not use curse words is because my review may not get published. TERRIBLE. If you wasted your precious time watching this, I just could not live with myself. God-awful! Unfortunately, I cannot rate this with ZERO Stars. That is most certainly what the quality of the movie and 'storytelling' would dictate. TOTAL GARBAGE.",1435449600,,448,4.907894736842105

6797816,4,B00PCSVO6E,"I prefer movies that either make me feel good, or make me think. This one did the latter. I don't see death as a horrible occurrence, my faith tells me it is simply a passage. But if death is hard for you, if it depresses you, then I wouldn't recommend this.",1432857600,,258,4.078431372549019
6797817,5,B00PCSVO6E,"One of the most delicate films I have seen.  It was fairly easily watchable, now in my 60s.  10 or 20 years ago, it would have wrecked me, I am sure.",1431561600,,149,3.774193548387097
