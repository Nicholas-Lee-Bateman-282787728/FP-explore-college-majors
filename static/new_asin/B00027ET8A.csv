8023171,4,B00027ET8A,"I think this is a great DVD for beginners. However, the instructor/musician's name is Alex BAch, not Boch. She knows her way around the guitar, and has a nice singing voice. At the risk of sounding essentialist, sometimes it makes a real difference to see a *woman* playing and teaching. There are so many wonderful instructional DVDs with men but Alex might make it just that much more accessible to a young girl starting out; she is a very positive music role model in my opinion. However - the lessons DO move very fast, especially the scale (I am not sure that was a necessary inclusion) and the fingerpicking sessions. She shows the chords, then plays along with pretty quick changes between chords. Someone starting out should understand that they will *not* be able to do everything the first time, and to stop and rewind until they get the chord changes right.

The DVD also has a section on stringing and caring for a guitar in the special features.

Edit: this is the SAME DVD that is included in the book, ""Guitar for Girls"" ISBN 0825627494 - I think the book version might be a better deal.",1133568000,4,1102,4.588832487309645
