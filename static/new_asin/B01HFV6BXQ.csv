7786494,5,B01HFV6BXQ,Great video! My 3 year old loves Doc McStuffins!,1478822400,,48,4.444444444444445
7786495,5,B01HFV6BXQ,"This is an adorable DVD. I watched this DVD with my 5 year old and she was glued to the screen. We had actually caught the title episode on television when it premiered but haven't been able to see it again since. It is a Doc McStuffins episode unlike any other as it is more like a movie. Doc learns she is part of a family of doctors who can treat toys in a special town. She is able to go back and forth there into a whole new land. It is honestly my favorite episode of Doc McStuffins. In addition to the title episode, there are four more episodes to watch. It is broken down by episodes so you can watch as many or little as you want. Perfect for the car too if you have a DVD player as its perfect to get the Doc McStuffins fix your kids want on the go!",1477440000,,760,3.9096774193548387
