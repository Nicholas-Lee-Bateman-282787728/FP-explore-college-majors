2559117,5,B000FBFYXC,"It is so cool seeing the old videos from 1943-on and to flashback to see some of the greatest players of all time running around during the fall classic.  The old footage from the 60s & 70s was really great for me since i was a kid then and remember a lot of those players.  The 1940s and 1950s is also classic for the very reason if to see joltin Joe and Whitey Ford, Larson's perfecto.  I want to mention one thing I noticed in (I think) the 1943 highlights.  Did anyone else notice that someone for the Yanks was wearing number 3?  Also another player was wearing numger 5 that is Joltin Joe's number???  I know Joe was off in the WWII so I find it odd they let someone else wear his number and then to see Babe Ruth's number being used just 8 years after he is retired.  There may have been more number swaping but those are the two that I noticed.  Anyway a great package for any Yankee fan or Baseball fan in general.  Get it if you can.  I got mine for $25 so I could not pass on that.",1269561600,3,992,4.01530612244898

2559120,5,B000FBFYXC,"Whether you are a Yankee fan or not these videos contain rare footage of the Yankees 17 World Series wins from 1947 to 2000. You will see rare footage of Shibe Park, Ebbets Field, The Polo Grounds, Crosley Field, Original Milwaukee County Stadium, and of course, old Yankee Stadium before the renovations. These are complete highlights of each of the 17 Series wins. If you were to purchase these individually you would pay several hundred dollars. The quality is very good considering the age of the original broadcasts. I have thoroughly enjoyed watching these classic games from the past. They are a must for avid historical baseball fans who would like to add to their collection. The 1958 World Series on are broadcast in color.",1202428800,3,733,4.872

2559125,3,B000FBFYXC,"vintage, classic, nostalgic.  all words sum this box set up.  very good set to have for the avid fan.  i saved it for a rainy day.  only wished the coverage of some of the old games were a bit longer, as you don't get the whole game, just key moments... and the more recent seasons, i already had from another box set, so was a little disappointed with that, but that was my own doing.  and not every world series is covered... i think only 17 out of the 26.  overall, a great buy to have all the yankee classic moments preserved on dvd.  go yankees!",1156723200,14,550,4.132075471698113
2559126,5,B000FBFYXC,"If you are a baseball fan you will love this collection.  You won't get the complete games of other DVD's by A&E, but in this collection of 17 Yankee championships you will get all the key moments in the World Series games.

When you see the old Yankee Stadium in the old stock footage you will notice the grave tomb stone monuments in centerfield (in the field of play) where they buried Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, and Miller Huggins.  When Mickey Mantle and Joe DiMaggio died they buried them next to Ruth, Gehrig, and Huggins.  You can see thier tomb stones when you visit Monument Park in Yankee Stadium.

There are a lot of ""if's"" in Yankee lore.  Being a Yankee fan is hard, very hard...there's been hardship.  For example, the Mazerowski home run in 1960, the George Brett home run off of Goose Gossage in the 1980 ALCS.  The Gonzalez 9th inning hit in the 7th game of the 2001 World Series...the list goes on.

All I can say is that those Yankee shortcommings broke my heart and scarred my soul.

Our New York Yankees HAVEN'T won a World Championship in OVER 6 years.  It will be 7 years after the 2006 World Series:

The St. Louis Cardinals will defeat the Detroit Tigers 4 games to 1 game in the 2006 World Series.  The odds in Vegas are 12 to 1 for St. Louis which is very surprising.  I'm not a betting man, but if I were I would bet the house on the Cardinals.  Do yourself a favor and go to Vegas and win yourself some money.  If you bet $1,000, you will get $12,000, if you bet $3,000 you will get $36,000.  You will win. Take my word for it.

In the past 30 years I've named the World Series winner 29 times before the start of the playoffs.  The only time I came up short was in 1988.  I took Oakland that year.  My record is great because I know the game of baseball like no other human being who has ever analyzed the game (recently, I called the 2004 Red Sox Championship in June of 2004 and the 2005 White Sox Championship in May of 2005).

Our Yankees don't have the starting and middle relief pitching to compete for the World Championship this year.  I wish they did.  Furthermore, they have a cancer at 3rd base in a sulking, overrated, prima donna, ""me only"", and vastly tumorous player.  Many teams don't have to deal with that major problem and headache.  Call him Mr. Dissension.

Being a lifelong Yankee fan is an everlasting bond with the past and present; with a franchise who has had it's ups and downs (mostly good times). When my childhood idol Mickey Mantle passed away, I had the same feelings of sadness, grief, and loss when my father passed.

When Yankee Captain Thurman Munson died in the 1979 plane crash there wasn't a dry eye in my household.  To me it was like losing a brother, a sister, an uncle.  When Billy Martin died prematurely the world stopped for me.

The New York Yankees are the class of American sports and when personal tradgedy strikes it hits a nerve with all of us who grew up rooting for our beloved team.  I don't think any other franchise can conjure up the deep sentiments and emotions a true Yankee fan can.

Someday, hopefully soon, our New York Yankees can return to glory.",1154217600,12,3138,4.355172413793103

He received them on December 22, 2012, only 1 1/2 days after I ordered this item.  (Great job Amazon!)  And, even though they were a Christmas present, he opened them that day and started watching.  Well, he watched almost non-stop until they were finished.  He called the first time to tell me how great they were that very day.  Then he called me Christmas day to tell me he loved them.  Finally, the day after Christmas, when he finished watching them, he called me again to let me know how much he absolutely loved them and how great they were.  This is a man who dreams in pin-stripes, so that is one awesome rating.  Thanks Amazon and of course, thanks to the NY Yankees!!!!!",1357171200,,843,4.346153846153846
