8292647,5,B001DB6J6E,"I mainly got these for the movie Excess Baggage cuz I love that movie, but I'd never seen Hideaway before but once I watched it I found it was pretty good too. They are not meant for kids to watch.",1356912000,3,197,3.95
8292648,5,B001DB6J6E,"Fast shipping....ordered this for Excess Baggage because I love that movie, and it was cheaper to buy the combo pack from this seller than it was to get the one movie from another seller....Hideaway is SCARY!!!",1324425600,,210,4.861111111111111
8292649,1,B001DB6J6E,"Most of the film is painful to watch mostly because Ms Silverstone is a spoiled brat who is irritating throughout.  The last quarter of the film is the most tolerable and the ending a satisfying relief after a dull previous 3/4 of the film.  Standout performance by Christopher Walken as the bad guy, and even Harry Connick Jnr is passable, but the two leads are sadly mismatched and the vast majority of the film is a mishap.  Poor Benico del Torro for having to star opposite the over indulged Ms Silverstone.  He deserves credit (and some eye drops for those red eyes) just for staying the course.",1239321600,,600,4.579439252336448
