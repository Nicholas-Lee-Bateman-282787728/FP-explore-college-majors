3966127,5,B002Q02FRS,"Jason Bushman's 'Hollywood Je t'aime' is full of charm. The depiction of a French gay man coming to the world of Los Angeles is whimsical, poignant and funny. And as he  traverses this new world, his outsider perspective, on a place I think I know so well, is often hilarious. The film reminded me of Truffaut with its subtle humanity, funny moments, and charm.",1265500800,,361,4.640625
3966128,5,B002Q02FRS,I loved it! I curled up on the sofa with a glass of wine and thoroughly enjoyed watching the eclectic mix of characters and this Hollywood story unfold.,1260748800,7,152,4.464285714285714
3966129,3,B002Q02FRS,"Smarting from a hurtful breakup with his twinkish lover, 29 year old Parisian Jerome (Eric Debets) decides a change of scenery is needed, so he decides to pursue his dream of going to Hollywood and try to become an actor. He takes a room at a seedy Hollywood hostel, takes the bus to the beach, where he meets Ross (Chad Allen), a stoner who hangs out at the beach and introduces Jerome to someone who gets him an audition for a commercial.  In the interim, Jerome befriends a tranny prostitute and, through her, meets an older, bitter drag queen who lets him stay in a room at her big house in Silverlake.  Jerome samples the gay nightlife, plays at a sex club, has countless flashbacks imagining his ex Gilles is with him, and gets very disillusioned with the prospects of staying in the States.

The film shows the gritty side of Los Angeles and West Hollywood, and I give it credit for being brutally honest in showing how Americans are often not welcoming of people from foreign countries.  I'm guessing the filmmaker was going for a ""Wizard of Oz"" effect in having the film change from Black&White to Color when he left Paris, but the film was poorly edited throughout, in my opinion. I thought the characters were poorly developed and came across rather bland, especially Debets' deadpan, emotionless delivery.  Chad Allen is wasted in his role, but Michael Airington steals a few scenes as Jerome's drag queen landlady ""Norma Desire."" Unrated, but would likely be at least a heavy R for full frontal nudity and simulated sex. DVD extras include commentary, a brief featurette and a few short deleted scenes.  I give the film three stars out of five.",1260576000,7,1657,4.696551724137931
3966130,3,B002Q02FRS,"Romantic comedy?  I didn't see much romance or comedy.  ""Will make you fall in love with LA all over again""?  It made LA look depressing and dirty to me.  ""Hugely entertaining""?  Mildly entertaining, somewhat boring.

Good cinematology, fine acting, interesting characters.  But when the movie was finished, we looked at each other and said, ""What was the point?""  A French gay man comes to LA, has a few experiences and meets a few people, most of whom aren't very pleasant, and then goes back home to Paris.  Hang on, it's a rollercoaster of emotions! NOT!

""Hilarious and touching"" I didn't find anything hilarious, and the only thing touching was Jerome's innocence, or perhaps the sad, sad people he encountered.  I can say I did enjoy the few nude scenes in the movie; they almost made it worthwhile.",1260576000,14,806,4.810218978102189
3966141,3,B002Q02FRS,"THis movie is funny, good acting, and a beleivable storyline. Its better than some of the other comedys ive watched. Wouldnt pay alot for this dvd. An ok movie.",1347148800,,160,4.551724137931035
3966142,1,B002Q02FRS,"I like Chad Allen a lot and rented it because it seemed...inaccurately, as it turned out, from the misleading cover...that he'd have a big role in this...thing. Depressing. Trite. Creepy. The French lead had all the charm of a mannekin. And LA's underbelly even less. Really, what are people thinking when they write and then produce this stuff?",1339286400,,345,4.9655172413793105
3966143,2,B002Q02FRS,"I bought this film based on other reviews and the fact that it featured one of my favorite actors: Chad Allen.  While he did a good job, I can only imagine how it felt for him to be stuck in such a ""less than stellar"" role.  May I suggest that you will really enjoy any of the other films he appears in.  The ""Donald Strachey"" detective mysteries, (any of the four), or even ""SAVE ME"".  These allow him to command the screen with a presence that is not unlike a young James Gagney! As for this film, I'm glad that I saw it, but do not need to repeat the experience!",1320796800,,565,4.063063063063063
3966144,5,B002Q02FRS,"Awesome movie, captures the immigrant experience beautifully, especially when you have California dreams. Loved it in the theatre so had to buy the DVD. Totally enjoyable when watching again.",1303344000,,191,5.620689655172414
3966145,4,B002Q02FRS,"This is a shoe string budget film which benefits from it, as indeed most do. There are some lovely unsubtle stylistic twists, like using black and white for the 'in France' shots and seeing everything Californian in glorious Technicolour.

This is not a full on gay film with regular bedroom trysts and the like. It is about the experience of a disgruntled with life gay Frenchman who goes to Hollywood to become an actor. There are some lovely scenarios and some excellent acting. The plot is a bit weak but the sub strata keeps the momentum up. The main character comes across as being too french at times which is fine cos he is, most of the interest comes with the supporting cast of misfits and lifes failures who keep managing to bring sparkle and hope to the world. I won't ruin the plot by saying what happens, just say it does have a bit of a feel good factor going on. Whilst it plays up on the humour, this is not a comedy; it is much more a study of realtionships in a gently, unfolding manner. All in all a great little film.",1302652800,,1038,4.350515463917525
3966146,3,B002Q02FRS,"A type of movie you can watch once and that's it. I found nothing funny in the movie. Starting with a really depressing picture of Paris, through hostile welcome at the airport in U.S. (which is, unfortunately, very true), to the departure of the main character back to Paris, the film is quite sad.
I think what makes the movie something exceptional among others gay theme films is the acting quality. It is not bad, in some part very good indeed.
I cannot give more than 3 stars, 'cause I am not completely satisfied with what I got. Nevertheless, it was not a waste of time to see it.",1283990400,,587,4.394495412844036
3966147,5,B002Q02FRS,"Without doubt Hollywood Je t'Aime is above the average of the gay themed movie, the story is funny and cute at the same time, the main character, Jerome, grows into the heart of the spectator as he grows in the movie, and in the end, you are cheering for him, maybe even realizing that the ""standard"" happily ever after is not the one that probably it's better for him. Sometime the reality of a life in black and white is better than the glittering full color of something that it's not true.",1278288000,,493,4.369565217391305
3966148,2,B002Q02FRS,"Four stars? Are you kidding me? This makes no sense until one notices that the few five-star ratings appear to have been made by the film's marketing department. The positive ""reviews"" have so clearly been taken from the film's promotional material. It's a good reminder of how easy it is to inflate an Amazon rating.

The film itself is fairly boring and simplistic. A gay Frenchman gets depressed with his life in Paris, so he decides to follow a lifelong dream and go to Hollywood--where he discovers (shocker!!) that life is just as depressing in California.

The movie's climactic, epiphanic line: ""A sunny day isn't special when it happens every day.""

Commence vomiting.",1275609600,2,677,4.9734513274336285
3966149,3,B002Q02FRS,"This is a cute movie, worth watching, but it does not live up to the quality of most (gay) French films.  If I had been expecting less, I probably would have been thrilled.",1272326400,,172,4.212121212121212
3966150,3,B002Q02FRS,"Unfortunately, this movie is just plain boring and simplistic.  Beyond all of its L.A. cliches, I do have one major issue with the movie.  If you're going to have a tranny character, you could at least use an actual tranny....NOT a natural born female.

Also, it was quite obvious that the director/producers brought Chad Allen in as a recognizable name, but his role was deceptively small.....and pointless.  Even then his acting was all over the place...from ultra butch when Jerome first meets him, to bitchy queen, to sensitive nelly, to zzzzzzzzzzz.

Watching this movie is like watching lesbians discuss fashion....painful.",1266883200,,629,5.25
8377389,5,B002Q02FRS,"Love love this!  A truly great film, just wished it was a bit longer.  Would be awesome if there could be a sequel.",1509062400,,115,3.9565217391304346

8377395,4,B002Q02FRS,"Lovely little viewing movie. Jerome (Eric Debets) leaves France to live in L.A. Moves into a hostel, that doesn't work, meets a transsexual who introduces him to a Drag Queen who lets him live in a room in her house. With me so far? he goes to the beach (it is winter and even in Cali it is cold by the beach) and meets pot smoking Chad Allen. That is the thrust of the movie. The particulars...performances are terrific by the supporting cast. Moving, funny, cute or catty. The always sexy Chad Allen? I am such a huge fan of his. He is the confident and charming guy who takes a liking to Jerome...his best line to Jerome ""you're French, you're sexy and I want to get in your pants"" love that line, he's great! As for Eric Debets...his understated and very laid back almost ""whatever happens"" performance is right on. Fun movie (not laugh out loud) good story and likable characters make this one a good to see. Some very poignant moments too.",1413158400,,945,4.436781609195402
8377396,2,B002Q02FRS,"I am sorry, but I was bored with this movie. I found nothing of excitement in this movie. Maybe I just picked the wrong nite for me to watch it, but I got over half way thru it and turned it off. That's just my personal opinion.",1370304000,,228,3.872340425531915
8377397,5,B002Q02FRS,"A delightful film to watch any time.  Story line fun - characters delightful.  And fun to see the ""old neighborhood"" of Echo Park in Los Angeles.  And Chad Allen!  Love that guy - who wouldn't after seeing the Donald Strachey series.",1360368000,,233,4.609756097560975
8377398,3,B002Q02FRS,"I saw this movie for the first time on Hulu and really enjoyed it. A French gay man breaks up with his boyfriend and moves to Hollywood to become an actor. Along the way he enconters some interesting characters who teach him valuable life lessons about how to survive in Los Angeles. Some other reveiwer said that it pays homage to ""The Wizard Of Oz"" and I have to agree now that I think about. I was disapotined that he didn't stay in LA and create a new life for himself and that he and Chad Allen didn't end up as boyfriends. It would have also been nice to see a make up seen with his boyfriend  when he returned home. It kina leaves you hanging.",1355184000,,650,4.158730158730159
