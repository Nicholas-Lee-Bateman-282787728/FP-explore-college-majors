2600428,2,B000G6BLEW,"Jeffrey Hunter and Robert Wagner, together in one movie. That's enough to send me running out of the room all by itself. The 1950's were an interesting time for Westerns, and we saw some good ones and some stinkers, too. Hunter and Wagner combined together in one movie would overpower any good that could possibly come out of it.

And this movie looks like the 50's, sounds like the 50's, was costumed like the 50's, was casted from what was available during the 50's, and takes horrific liberties with the facts, as many Westerns made during the 50's did. Does all this make this movie a ""stinker"".  Well, I gave it two stars, and that was about right.  I mean, moviemakers in the 50's didn't realize how stereotypical and shallow their movies were, so, in a sense, these movies weren't even Westerns -- they were 1950's renditions of Westerns. If you understand the enormous difference, you'll understand immediately that I'm certainly glad movies aren't made that way any more.

See the Pitt/Affleck version of the Jesse James story (or at least, the end of the man's life) if you want to see a thoughtful, realistic, artful rendition of the time, and the men who were part of the real story.",1208131200,,1196,4.680952380952381
2600429,4,B000G6BLEW,"**** 1957. Directed by Nicholas Ray. After the failed bank heist of Northfield, Minn., Jesse and Frank James try to come back home. Flashbacks show us the important moments of Jesse's life. Even if the 20th Century Fox producers carved up the movie, Nicholas Ray's hand is still visible in numerous scenes of THE TRUE STORY OF JESSE JAMES: the hero's longing for a quiet anonymous life as he understands that his legend is a decoy, the gang's heists which are shot in a so anti-heroic manner that the film radiates a melancholic mood. The flashbacks, imposed by the producers and introduced by ridiculous floating clouds fortunately don't spoil the power of such a sublime scene as the murder of Jesse that the director patently delays as if he wanted to struggle with the Legend. Highly recommended.",1207008000,,800,4.846715328467154
2600430,4,B000G6BLEW,"In the movie ""The true Story of Jesse James, the plot is certainly following the  traditions of Jesse and Frank being Robin Hoods, when in effect they may have just been Hoods Robbin for Frank and Jesse and no one else.  Still it is a good movie for the time and tells much of the story about the ill fated attempt to rob the bank at Northfield Minnesota.  They should have never gone into that area in the first place as it took them totally out of their land of sympathizers and into the jowls of Northern veterans and citizens,  Be that as it may, I have for years tried to find out who the blind balladeer who sings at the last.  The choreagraphy of that final scene with the balladeer and his aid is very story telling and a fitting end to this episode.  I wish i could find this song by him in its entirety. You cannot take anything from this movie but good thoughts about all the direction and acting that went ito it.  Definitely a classic and worth the money.",1203811200,5,968,4.228260869565218
2600431,2,B000G6BLEW,"Although this version of the Jesse James story is more factual than most, it's at the expense of entertainment.  Robert Wagner simply does not have the charisma that the character needs for us to believe that so many men, older than he was, were willing to follow him.  Nor are any of the characters particularly well drawn, which doesn't give the actors much to do.  The story is told in flashback form, starting with Northfield, but this does not seem to be to the film's advantage.  The first 10 or more minutes are spent with the Northfield posse trying to track and find the gang, and because there are no characters to be invested in, it's rather dull.  Later, when the flashbacks catch up to the present, we see some of the same material again.  Interestingly, the screenplay credit says it's based on Nunnally Johnson's screenplay for the 1939 version with Tyrone Power.  That version took a lot of liberties with the history, but is far more entertaining.

Technically, the DVD looks fine.  It's a clean print, nice transfer with decent color.  A trailer and a newsreel clip comprise the extras.",1174348800,16,1104,4.732984293193717
2600432,4,B000G6BLEW,"Well I finally got to see this on DVD the other day, after waiting years to see it.  The True Story of Jesse James is a great psychological western.  You could tell that the budget wasn't very high, but this was compensated for by some wonderful character moments.

Unlike what had been listed on this site for months before its release, this DVD is in widescreen.  I'm glad that the earlier info on here was a misprint (listing it as full screen), because there is some really great widescreen composition in this film.  Check this DVD out if you're a fan of psychological westerns or the work of director Nicholas Ray.  Kudos to Fox for releasing this film, and I hope that eventually they release Nicholas Ray's best directed Fox film, Bigger Than Life.",1156809600,5,756,4.604477611940299

I, too, am a Nicholas Ray fan.",1155945600,6,366,4.7936507936507935
2600434,4,B000G6BLEW,"Essentially a remake of the film ""Jesse James"", this  version has a fine cast.  Robert Wagner and Jeffrey Hunter portray Jesse and Frank. In comparision, it is hard to fill the shoes of Tyrone Power and Henry Fonda, but the leads do well.  Supporting cast Includes Hope Lang , Agnes Moorehead and Alan Hale.  Look for John Carradine who was in the original.  A good turn by Nicholas Ray make this a good bet to see.",1154649600,7,415,4.407894736842105

But, I didn't and it went off without a hitch. It was a good story and I'm certain you will like this movie if you like westerns.

I had worked with RJ before on a water picture called BENEATH THE 12 MILE REEF. We became good friends after that. I think they stayed with accuracy as much as possible regarding the James boys. There are so many versions but you will like this one.",1397260800,8,548,3.936936936936937

This review is for the non-MOD DVD and for the original release DVD, so I can't say anything about the Fox Cinema Archives. This movie is presented in Widescreen and runs for about 92mins (1hr 32mins). This movie has a pretty great cast, which includes: Robert Wager, Jefferey Hunter, Hope Lange, Agnes Moorehead, Alan Hale Jr., Alan Baxter, John Carradine, Frank Overton, plus others!

2600453,4,B000G6BLEW,"There's more than a passing resemblance between this version of the life of America's most famous outlaw and that given almost 20 years earlier in Tyrone Power's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jesse-James/dp/B000G6BLDS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jesse James</a>; in fact this screenplay is said to be ""from [one] by Nunnally Johnson,"" who was responsible for the Power incarnation.  Robert Wagner and Jeffrey Hunter, who had teamed two years earlier for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/White-Feather/dp/B000NO1XMC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">White Feather</a>, join forces again to play Jesse and Frank, who as in most retellings of the story are more sinned against than sinning, though certainly not without stain.  Walter Newman's script mends some of the earlier version's omissions (the Jameses' service with Quantrill is included, as is the existence of their stepfather, Dr. Samuel (Barney Phillips), the death of Jesse's half-brother Archie in a Pinkerton raid on the James/Samuel farmhouse late in the gang's career and the loss of their mother's (Agnes Moorehead) arm (not her life) therein, and the important role of Zerelda Sims (Hope Lange), Jesse's cousin and later wife, in restoring his health after he was seriously wounded in the latest days of the war), and also includes a lively recreation of the great Northfield, Minn., bank robbery which did indeed result in the capture of the Younger brothers and the virtual destruction of the original gang (although it's placed in 1878, not 1876 as was really the case).  But it also perpetuates some of the first movie's errors, most notably by giving the impression that Jesse's death followed closely on the Northfield raid (it was really almost six years later) and that he was planning to give up outlawry at the time, as well as by locating his marriage at an earlier date than was the case.  Wagner, too, is a bit pretty for the role, though he does manage to make his Jesse sympathetic--almost more so than Power did.  Alan Hale, Jr., has a small but important and nicely done part as Cole Younger.",1306800000,,2154,5.615384615384615
2600454,2,B000G6BLEW,"""The True Story of Jesse James"" is a 1957 western film directed by Nicholas Ray and stars Robert Wagner (Jesse) and Jeffrey Hunter (Frank) with Agnes Morehead, John Doucette, and Alan Hale Jr.

Robert Wagner has built a career around good looks and a suave manner. He's best known for the TV series ""Hart to Hart"" for which he received several Golden Globe nominations, and he earned an Emmy nomination for ""It Takes a Thief"" (1968). Younger viewers know him as ""Number 2"" from the ""Austin Powers"" films. Wagner plays Jesse, but he looks more like James Dean (who was supposed to play the part, but he died) than the famous outlaw.

Handsome Jeffrey Hunter is best known for his role as Jesus in ""King of Kings"" (1961) but I think his best performance was opposite John Wayne in ""The Searchers"" (1956). Hunter plays Frank James, Jesse's older brother.

Agnes Morehead earned 4 Academy Award nominations as Best Supporting Actress (""Magnificent Ambersons"", ""Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte"", ""Johnny Belinda"", ""Mrs. Parkington""), along with 6 Emmy nominations for her role in ""Bewitched"" and a win for a role in ""Wild Wild West"" (1965). She won two Golden Globes. She appeared with Orson Welles in her film debut in ""Citizen Kane"" (1941), and then in ""The Magnificent Ambersons"" (1942), and ""Jane Eyre"" (1944). She plays Jesse's mother and her acting in this film is probably one of the worst performances she ever gave.

John Doucette's chubby face and heavy set frame are familiar to everyone from his 200+ films, usually as a heavy. He was distinguished by his husky voice and being the fastest draw in Hollywood. He was equally at home in film and on TV and was comfortable in Westerns as well as biblical epics. He plays the Sheriff - uncharacteristically  he isn't one of the bad guys in this film.

Alan Hale Jr. is known to everyone as ""the skipper"" from ""Gilligans Island"". Like his dad, he was in more than 100 films, appearing on screen almost from the time he was born (1921) until his death (1990). Hale plays Cole Younger.

The great impersonator Frank Gorshin appears as Charley Ford.

Jesse James has been played by just about everyone, including Tyrone Power (1939), Roy Rogers (1941), Clayton Moore (1947), Audie Murphy ( 1950 and 1969), Macdonald Carey (1951), Lee van Cleef (1954), Wendell Corey (1959), Robert Duvall (1972), James Keach (1980), Kris Kristofferson (1986), Rob Lowe (1994), J.D. Souther (1999), Colin Farrell (2001), and Brad Pitt (2007). My personal preference was Tyronne Power.

The film is directed by Nicholas Ray. Ray is best known as the director of ""Rebel  Without a Cause"" (1956) for which he received an Oscar nomination (winner Delbert Mann for ""Marty""). He also received a Cannes Film Festival nomination for ""The Savage Innocents"" (1960) and Venice Film Festival nominations for ""Bitter Victory"" (1957) and ""Bigger than Life"" (1956). My absolute favorite Ray film is the western ""Johnny Guitar"" (1954). Unfortunately, none of Ray's considerable skills are on exhibit in this film. Indeed, ""The True Story of Jesse James"" marked the start of the decline of Ray's career, and the 10 films he made after this are all unremarkable from a directorial POV.

The great Nunnaly Johnson wrote the screenplay. Johnson was nominated twice for an Oscar (""Holy Matrimony"", ""The Grapes of Wrath"") and won at the Cannes Film festival for ""Man in the Grey Flannel Suit"" (1956). His notable films include ""The Dirty Dozen"" (1967), ""Three Faces of Eve"" (1957), ""How to Marry a Millionaire"" (1953), and ""The Desert Fox"" (1951). One is tempted to wonder how much better the film might have been, given  the same script, with better acting (Dean instead of Wagner, Anybody instead of Morehead), but alas, we can only wonder.

All things considered this is a rather ordinary western, adequate acting in most cases, and adequate photography. Nothing stands out. This is a shame, because the writer and director were at the peak of their powers, as were many of the actors. Moreover, the idea that this film is any more ""true"" than other films about Jesse James is debatable - there are many errors in the film (e.g., calling the Pinkerton agency the Remington agency,  blaming the failure of the Northfield robbery on a failure to cut a telegraph line, etc.).",1275696000,2,4278,4.907202216066482

8129072,4,B000G6BLEW,"The goal of this film is to present Jesse and Frank James in the most favorable light possible by saying that what they did was not their fault; they were provoked to do it. The film claims that ""Much that you will see here is fact and much is as close to what actually happened as any man can testify."" The film calls Jesse James a quiet Missouri farm boy  who became Americas most notorious outlaw.
As if to debunk this introduction, the film then portrays Northfield, Minnesota on September 7, 1876 when the James gang killed many people during a bank robbery during which many members of the gang were also killed. The towns people were outraged. About a couple dozen members of a posse pursue the gang. A $30,000 reward is posted for the capture of the James brothers. The sheriff is so enraged that he throws dynamite at the gang. The Younger brothers are captured. They were badly wounded.
Then the film goes back on time and shows how the James brothers and their family were mistreated. For example, Jesse is shot when he held up a white flag and tried to surrender. Another of many such examples is that the James family were attacked by their neighbors after the Civil War who were northern sympathizers because the James boys fought for the south.",1504224000,,1259,4.546255506607929
8129073,3,B000G6BLEW,"This is definitely not the true story of Jesse James, but if you like Robert Wagner you'll enjoy this movie. Robbing banks was not too hard and killing people was a little too easy.  Wagner had a romance with a young Hope Lange and they supposedly lived in a house with a white picket fence under aliases.  Alas, Jesse was betrayed by a ""friend.""",1496534400,,346,4.390625
8129074,3,B000G6BLEW,"Ive long been a fan of legendary characters from the old west.  I don't know if this story is actually true, but its the one I remember seeing as a kid on TV.  Like most of these tales, Im sure there is an element of truth in it but most likely much is also fiction.  In any case a couple things seem to be historically accurate.  Frank James participated briefly in the Civil War but Jesse was too young.  Their family was living in Missouri which had split allegiance to the North and South.  Being from the western part of the state, the James boys were Confederate sympathizers.

As their families finances dissipated, Jesse (Robert Wagner) convinces Frank (Jeffrey Hunter) and a handful of cousins led by Cole Younger (Alan Hale, Jr.) to rob the Missouri banks that foreclosed on their homestead.  Eventually, Jesse marries his first cousin, Zee (Hope Lange) who was named after Jesses mother, Zerelda (Agnes Moorehead).  The James Gang now flush with money and still free, settle for a while but eventually, Jesse decides it would be a great idea to head north 400 miles to a mining town in Minnesota called Northfield.  His scout tells him it would be easy pickings.  It isn't and it begins a downward slide.

By now the Remington Detective Agency led by Barney Remington (Alan Baxter) has been hired by the banks and is closing in.  The film features some up and coming actors (Wagner, Hunter and Lange) who are all fine.  I was most impressed however with Wagners horsemanship.  Directed by legendary filmmaker Nicholas Ray who has films like In a Lonely Place, Rebel Without a Cause and King of Kings on his resume, this would seem like one of his lesser films.  Much is borrowed from the 1939 version called Jesse James including some film footage.  A few other notables, include a young Frank Gorshin playing Charley Ford, brother of that dirty little coward who shot Mr. Howard, Robert Robbie Ford (Carl Thayler).  Also watch for John Carradine as a preacher and Bing Russell, a Jayhawker Sergeant and father of Kurt Russell.",1495324800,,2038,4.709039548022599
