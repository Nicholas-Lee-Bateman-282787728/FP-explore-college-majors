8460414,4,B00578J4BQ,"Valery Gergiev and the World Orchestra for Peace - a first-rate ensemble composed of principals and prominent musicians from a great number of countries - have given us a stellar DVD recording of Mahler's fourth and fifth symphonies (see my review), and the present concert, recorded live in fine video and good, if not always transparent, audio at the Emirates Palace in Abu Dhabi in January 2011 therefore raises high expectations. I must admit that I am not exceedingly happy with the program selections. Rossini's ""Guillaume Tell"" overture and Prokofiev's little tongue-in-cheek ""Classical"" Symphony are, musically speaking, relative lightweights and orchestral showpieces. They are played with great panache and gusto, likewise the encore, Johann Strauss' ""Tritsch-Tratsch-Polka"", and smiles abound among the musicians and the conductor. These works, however, are not particularly memorable, and the focus is therefore on Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony, the concert's high point. It is very well played, indeed, with particular attention to shifts in tempo and mood, especially in the brooding first movement, gracefully elegant in the second and third, and appropriately triumphant in the finale. If the performance strikes me as not overwhelmingly exciting, and if I fail to find new insights into the score, this may be my problem. It seems to me that the hall's acoustics are not kind to secondary themes and solo instruments: they don't always come through clearly, though you know they are there. Regardless of minor quibbles, this DVD can be warmly recommended, especially if you are relatively new to the music. It will, however, not displace my favorite Tchaikovsky Fifth on DVD: Vladimir Fedoseyev's twenty-year old recording with the Moscow Radio Symphony Orchestra (disk 5 of the Arthaus Tchaikovsky cycle, still in very decent audio and video) which explores the work's whole emotional range from the ferocious to the sublime.",1315180800,2,1942,5.45514950166113
