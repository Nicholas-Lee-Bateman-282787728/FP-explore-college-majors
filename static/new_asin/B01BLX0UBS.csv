7663885,5,B01BLX0UBS,"When I wrote my review of the first two volumes of RWBY (which you can find on the Amazon page for the Volume 2 DVD), I started by saying that this series was something. I followed that up by saying I wasn't sure if it would turn out to be an amazing or merely adequate thing, and that its progression would reveal that in due time. So, with Volume 3 now fully releasedIm going with amazing.

Up until now, this series appears to have been having trouble deciding what to do with itself. Dont get me wrong, the first two volumes of RWBY were very, very good. But while they had a lot of great character set-up and intriguing world building, they were remarkably slow-paced and constantly shifted from action scenes to a bunch of different sub-plots without doing much to elevate the story. Still, despite the inconsistent pacing and focus, RWBYs first two installments were nothing short of fun and entertaining. There was plenty of eye candy in the revolutionary animation, the masterfully choreographed action scenes were always cool to watch, most of the characters were very fun and likable (with some being slightly more compelling than others), and the music was a special kind of awesome.

The late creator and lead animator Monty Oum had plans for several volumes worth of story before his sudden and tragic passing in February 2015. Luckily, this turned out to be enough material for the other writers and producers to work with in order to continue what was always meant to be a very long journey through a stylish, albeit fairly derivative, fairy tale-inspired fantasy world.

Enter Volume 3, the shows return from a prolonged hiatus following the death of its creator. Our third venture into the wondrous world of RWBY opens with the Vytal Festival Tournament, an epic event that has been built up since the first volume. This season spends a great deal of time on this event, while at the same time introducing some new characters, providing some much-needed exposition to further the main story, and expanding on other characters story arcs. For the first five episodes, its mostly more of the same stuff weve already seen; more action, more light humor, and more vague hints at what the villains are planning. Enjoy this while it lasts, because judging from the much darker opening credits sequence alone, you know something serious is going to happen before this volume ends. Starting with the sixth episode, RWBY appears to have an epiphany of sorts; from this moment until the season finale, its almost nothing but twists, revelations, and Avatar levels of emotion. The tone of the show suddenly becomes infinitely more dark and mature, and the events that take place in the last few episodes feel like they were really worth the extended build-up. Theres fighting, theres shocks, theres crying, theres some minor relief, and most surprisingly, theres quite a lot of unexpected gut-punches. The second half of the season is like a toned-down Game of Thrones episode (without the gore, sex, or colorful language). All this to say, the show is finally, truly evolving. What once seemed to be nothing more than an innocent, light-hearted, low-stakes action serial has become a fully qualified fantasy epic packed with emotional drama. And to top it off, this volume showcases a willingness to take risks that Ive rarely seen in any American animated series. My faith in this show is definitely paying off.

The most outstanding aspect of the third volume, without a doubt, is the evolution of the characters, specifically the life-changing events they go through. While the first two volumes gave us ample opportunity to get to know and love the main heroes, this volume finally puts them to the test. We witness some of our favorite characters hitting rock bottom, as well as others discovering new and interesting things about themselves, with relationships being tested all the while. In all honesty, seeing what certain characters experience in this volume, especially towards the end, is absolutely heartbreaking. There is a particular event in the final episode that took a devastating toll on my feels. I dare you to sit through the whole thing without tearing up at least once.

I noted in my review of the first two that the tone of this series, for the most part, was surprisingly light and feel-good despite the dark nature of certain points to the story. This is true for the first two volumes; the third volume is pretty much the creators telling us that yes, really bad stuff does still happen in this world and a lot of people get hurt both mentally and physically. What makes this all the more heartwrenching for certain scenes is that they make you realize how easily innocence can be stolen. Emphasis is also placed on the fact that not everyone lives happily ever after (adding an interesting contrast to the fairy tales that inspired the show), and the way certain characters' arcs leave off at the end is even rather poetic. The shift in tone also reflects how RWBY is, at least in part, a coming-of-age story; as the characters change and evolve, so does the show itself.

The effectiveness of so many emotional moments and character development in this volume is largely due to the increasingly exceptional voice acting. You really notice a change in how certain characters start to sound as they evolve along with the story. Some of the voice acting could still be better, as there are still occasional lines from a few characters that sound fairly flat and lazy, but it is an overall outstanding cast of actors and actresses who have done an amazing job putting themselves in these roles and really drawing the viewer in. Jen Brown, Miles Luna, and Barbara Dunkelman are some of the ones who really stand out in this volume.

The only real complaint I have is that we still know next to nothing about the villains and their motivations, at least where character is concerned. On one hand, they do get a lot more screen time for badass moments and impressive showcasing of their powers; hell, theres even an episode which is almost entirely a flashback focusing exclusively on the villains activities prior to the events of the series. We also finally find out what they were planning to accomplish all alongwell, sort of. But the issue is that we still don't know why. What are these maniacs fighting for? Why did they go to all this trouble? These are questions that Im sure will be answered in the following volumes, assuming the villains are retained. But for now, its still a bit of a conundrum.

As for the technical aspects of the show, nothing has really improved or degraded from the last volume to any significant degree; which is not intended as a criticism, since more of the same stuff is a good thing more often than some people may think. The 3D cartoon-like animation and action sequences still look incredible, and the new characters, locations, and weapons all still have very creative and fascinating designs. There also seem to be less animation glitches than the first two volumes had, which is very refreshing. However, one minor gripe I have is that the character motions seem noticeably less fluid and more puppet-like than they used to be. This could just be a result of frame-rate issues however, and I've only gotten a chance to watch the Blu-Ray on a PC where it is generally extremely difficult to play back Blu-Ray discs without any loss in quality or performance.

And of course, the score by Jeff Williams is PHENOMENAL as always. It compliments this volumes darker tone perfectly, and a lot of the pieces are downright haunting. Its also nice to hear the tune of some of the earlier non-score songs incorporated into the score and established as themes for the main characters, as well as being re-imagined with different tones in appropriate scenes; for example, the darker take on Yangs theme (I Burn) at the end of Episode 6 gives me chills every time. The new songs performed by Jeff and Casey are still amazing, with songs like When It Falls, ""I'm the One"", Divide, and Cold standing out in particular. I have to compliment Casey Lee Williams for her fantastic singing; she did an awesome job on the first two soundtracks, especially on songs like Sacrifice (my personal favorite RWBY song) and All Our Days, but I cannot begin to describe how much she kills it on Volume 3. Shes consistently improved with each volume and she has never sounded better. Casey truly has an amazing talent. I almost can't decide which songs I like more than the others, because they're frankly all incredible. I will say that I am generally not a fan of modern pop music (my soul belongs to hard rock and metal), but I was surprised to find the more pop-oriented songs from the first two soundtracks (such as ""Gold"" and ""Dream Come True"") surprisingly good and well written, even if some of the lyrics were rather corny. Then again, they do sound more like traditional pop than the crap a lot of other artists do nowadays, so that might explain things. The ones from Volume 3, namely ""Neon"" and ""Not Fall In Love With You"", are as stellar as ever, and ""Not Fall In Love With You"" is definitely my favorite of the more poppy tunes (it sounds like something The Beatles could have done). The song I May Fall from the V1 soundtrack also makes a surprise appearance in the penultimate episode, which is a nice touch as that song was woefully underused previously. I would strongly recommend the soundtrack album, which includes both the songs and most of the episodes' score as the other two releases did. As a whole, I'd definitely say Volume 3's OST is the best so far. This one also includes the scores from the four ""World of Remnant"" videos that were published during this season's tenure, which the Volume 2 soundtrack did not have (I haven't watched the World of Remnants from V2 in a while however, and I don't remember if they had original music or recycled music from the episodes). If you liked the first two RWBY soundtracks, I guarantee you will love this one. Go buy it now. DO IT.

So, is this the best RWBY volume yet? Hell yes. In just about every way. It feels less like a threequel and more like the last part of one really long introduction to a big franchise, like Phase 1 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe; in other words, it feels like the first three volumes were intended to make up the complete first season, which makes a lot of sense considering how long the series is supposed to be. The ending is very open-ended and leaves a lot of burning questions unanswered, but it still manages to tie things together rather nicely. It has kind of a Fellowship of the Ring vibe to it; its clearly the end of the beginning and its a very bittersweet ending (with emphasis on bitter), but the stage is set perfectly for the next chapter and there are endless possibilities of what could come next. With any luck, the next few volumes will be RWBYs Two Towers.

All things considered, this installment of RWBY has touched me in ways I did not see coming. It shocked me, it excited me, it made me whisper profanities when bad stuff happened, it shattered my heart into a million pieces, and it even made me happy on occasion. And I will rest well knowing that it is only the beginning and that there is so much more to come. Rest in peace Monty Oum; thank you for starting us on this beautiful and epic journey, and thank you Rooster Teeth for allowing it to move forward and evolve. I cannot recommend RWBY: Volume 3 enough, and the same goes for Volumes 1 and 2.

Bring on Volume 4; my body is ready.

Edit 05/09/16: DVD/Blu Ray Combo Pack Product Review

If you've read my review of the Volume 2 DVD, you may remember me being extremely dissatisfied with the god-awful visual quality of RWBY DVDs in general. Those DVDs were what finally compelled me to start buying certain things on Blu-Ray, starting with Volumes 1-2, because the amount of pixelation and interlacing those DVDs fell victim to was frankly unnacceptable. As I said in that review, I've never seen a DVD with video quality that bad. As in ""how could anyone possibly think this is anything resembling presentable""-bad. It is for this reason that I strongly discourage prospective purchasers from buying the stand-alone DVDs, and highly recommend going for the combo packs (Volume 1 is sadly not available as a combo pack, but the BD is better anyway). We should not encourage such lazy manufacturing. When it comes to RWBY, the Blu-Rays are the only way you will truly get your money's worth. Unfortunately, the Volume 3 DVD is no exception.

On a happier note, let's talk about the Blu-Rays. While these discs do indeed do RWBY's animation full justice, they aren't without quality issues of their own. The first two volumes have a number of very specific episodes that are plagued by the most horrendous aliasing effect I've ever seen; it's so pronounced that it's hard to tell whether it's aliasing or interlacing (let's call it the Alias-Interlace Larva). Tragically, this effect pollutes two episodes in Volume 1 (""Forever Fall"" and ""Black and White"") and four in Volume 2 (""Extracurricular"", ""Search and Destroy"", ""Mountain Glenn"", and ""No Brakes""). For the life of me I can't figure out why this was added in, because it doesn't show up in the online episodes at all. I still have yet to determine if this occurs on all devices the discs are played on; all I have is a cheap external Blu-Ray drive for my computer and not a dedicated Blu-Ray player.

Volume 3, on the other hand, is a bit different. The online episodes of this volume do have some pretty nasty aliasing (regular aliasing, separate from the Alias-Interlace Larva) that is still present on the Blu-Ray. Banding is also still a bit of an issue, as well as heavy interlacing on certain characters' hair (most notably Pyrrha's). These are issues that were also present in the first two volumes, occurring in both the online versions and the Blu-Rays, with varying degrees of noticeability depending on the scenes. While I do feel that quality issues of this nature should really be touched up during the transfer to the home media releases, I'm very glad that the Volume 3 Blu-Ray doesn't *add* to the quality problems like the last two did. We get just about the same amount of quality issues on the Blu-Ray that we saw online, and it's refreshing to not have to endure the Alias-Interlace Larva for the entire duration of numerous episodes like we had to sit through during Volumes 1 and 2. That being said, after comparing some scenes on the Blu-Ray with their online equivalents, the aliasing and interlacing does appear more pronounced on the Blu-Ray than in the online versions; this is most likely due to some degree of quality loss stemming from my external BD drive and I just need to get an actual Blu-Ray player.

All in all, the Blu-Ray is outstanding in terms of quality despite its few shortcomings, and I highly recommend it. And at the end of the day, this is a show that is never going to look perfect or completely lack quality issues no matter what medium you watch it on (but they will hopefully be improved as the series continues to progress). It does not disappoint in the content department either, as it includes three very interesting behind-the-scenes featurettes, four ""World of Remnant"" history videos narrated by Shannon McCormick (voice of Ozpin), and three commentaries from the cast and crew.",1455494400,45,15431,4.736881280238184

7663930,2,B01BLX0UBS,"First, let me say that I LOVED Season 1, and was on the band wagon from the first Red Trailer!  And I've even supported Rooster Teeth by purchasing products from them, and even their own RWBY Grimm Eclipse game which....while enjoyable for a time, get's repetitive fairly quickly.  Suffice to say, I'm not just a random person disliking the turn the series has taken, but a fan whose been there since the beginning, and has supported them in areas where even some hardcore RWBY fans haven't (IE, their new game which a lot of people have overlooked....)

I'll start with the good things first!  The art style is definitely improving with each season, and season 4 it improved even more!  The voice actors are really getting into their roles, and the introduction of some new big names like Vic Mignogna and Chris Sabbat is mind boggling, and I'm so proud of how far Rooster Teeth has come with getting huge names on board now!  Also, the soundtrack remains a strength that hasn't waned in the least.  I don't know if it was shear luck that they got such a talented people for their soundtrack (like their singer!) or an impressive talent search that got them her...but either way, fantastic job with the sound track!

But unfortunately, I have to get into the cons now and why I gave it such a low score.  I'll start with the main issue to save people time.  The loss of Monty Oum is so horribly felt that....in every area I look on RWBY videos for this particular area....you either see people seeing the same thing I'm seeing...or people who are saying ""Well, the entire story isn't JUST about that one aspect"" IE, their defense is to deflect the problem, not deny it exists >< That problem is.....the fight scenes have gone downhill, extremely badly :/

In volumes 1 and 2, Monty Oum created fight scenes that you don't see ANYWHERE else, and they were huge hooks to bring in new fans!  Any fans of Monty Oum knows the man created incredible action scenes, and by advertising his name on the front of RWBY constantly, it was obvious that RWBY was being advertised....sadly, for it's fight scenes >< With the death of Monty Oum....the new fight scenes are so radically different and poor, that anyone whose not aware of what happened to Monty Oum....will at least still take notice of such a drastic new style of fighting >< And that new fighting style....is one more similar to shows like Naruto, where no one fights in majestic and mind blowing martial art scenes....but instead now uses extremely flashy one hit explosive moves, to match the enemies flashy explosive moves....and sometimes, God forbid, even YELLING OUT the name of said flashy explosive move.  Then when X flashy explosive move fails, the two fighters tend to jump apart or get interrupted in some way, and may then prepare their SECOND flashy explosive move to attack the other with >_> Rinse and repeat until one is defeated by X flashy explosive move.  It's...it's just a real shame to see this kind fighting style for Monty Oum's work :/ Granted, I knew they couldn't just pick RIGHT up where they left off, but I was really hoping for them to not go the COMPLETE opposite in terms of the way everyone fights O_O The hope was they'd stick to martial arts and fast paced fighting (instead of ""trading X explosive moves, that the character names the attack of, on each other""), and that maybe the action wouldn't be as...'polished' as it would with Oum.  Not....this :/ And for anyone saying ""Well, it's just the action!  Judging it so harshly on it's action is so foolish!""  And while I'd normally agree with you in about 95% of all cases....I do have to say that this show was advertised, not for it's story, but for it's action.  Oum's name everywhere, the R.W.B.Y. four trailers, etc; NOWHERE was the story advertised >< The story was, oddly enough, a nice bonus ^_^ Oum almost never focused on stories in most of his work (yes there WAS a story, but his desire was first and foremost, showcasing his incredible talent for action scenes).  So, RWBY is the rare case where action is the center of it, and the story is the nice topping.  You can deny this all you like, but from the getgo....RWBY was always meant to bring fans in with it's awe inspiring action!

Which brings me to the next small issue.  To lose that huge center piece in their ability to weave incredible scenes, we have to rely on the story now.  This, is hit and miss here.  The comedy is gold, the characters are great (mostly), and the world building is fairly interesting in most cases!  Not perfect, but interesting enough that a lot of people, myself included, find themselves watching the World of Remnant videos to eat up more ^_^ But as for the story this season....it's got a lot of clichs, and the plot twists were so obvious, that it kind of felt hard to feel the full impact of certain scenes that were meant to shock.  While many may not be a fan of the extremely quick tone change of the story, I wasn't too surprised or put off by it (and I will admit, Rooster Teeth does this a lot.  Creates a very lighthearted show that has a solid idea and garners a lot of fans, and a couple seasons in, DRASTICALLY changes it's tone to dark just out of the blue ><) It's done for story purposes, but the extremely sudden process ALWAYS turns a lot of people off.  It's not gradually done, nor is this kind of tone advertised anywhere in early episodes...it just happens.  Understandably, it turns a few people off and not everyone 'transitions' smoothly with the tone change.  Anyone who knows Rooster Teeth, knows this is the direction they always go with their stories.  And they tend to follow a formula that a LOT of other people use, hence why it can kinda be clich sometimes.

For instance Pyhrra; no shocker she died >< In so many other anime out there, when you have a ""supporting character"" whose stronger than the MAIN characters, is a paradigm of good with almost no flaws, and the (seemingly at the time) main villain openly says they want to kill said character.....well....said character dies 99% of the time XD her death was written in stone all the way back when Cinder said ""Leave Pyhrra to me"" and well...that's why I, and a lot of people I know, weren't shocked in the least that she died >< She'd been dead to us since season 2, it was just a question of how long they were gonna drag it out.  Which leads into why it was so badly done.  The long emo trip with her where she spends 50% of the season down and where the sad plays every time she's on screen; it kinda dragged her inevitable death that everyone saw coming out a bit >< In the end, her death was less a shocker because of 'good story writing' and more just a shocker for a small few because they were new to how RT operates with it's sudden tone shifts for it's lighthearted shows.  Some will like how a lighthearted show suddenly became dark, others will not.  I was just hoping they'd be a little more....original with it, and maybe do something a little more surprising :/ Destroying Beacon was a nice surprise though!  Although, they missed out on a golden opportunity to capitalize on Pyrrha's death by not showing Jaune's reaction :/ Maybe the voice actor didn't feel confident enough in his ability to have an immediate reaction to her death.  Hard to say what happened there.

But a final clich I'll list that really was unfortunate was Ruby's deus ex machine power >< The random Silver god eyes that wreck everything apparently XD That one was so cringey >< That REALLY felt like something you'd see in ""insert X cheap anime."" Main character suddenly and randomly receives god-like-power that one shots main villain of the season!  (Again, tying back into the X character uses X flashy move against enemy, rinse and repeat deal....).  And for anyone saying ""It was perfectly setup!  Ozbin said ""huh, you have silver eyes"" in season 1!  So OBVIOUSLY she'd get a god like power later"" I'd simply roll my eyes and say....you could probably excuse just about every deus ex machine power up in every anime if you're that easily swayed....It's just extremely unfortunate to see that Ruby isn't going to train to become a beastly warrior with her weapon....she's going to train to unlock her random Naruto Doujutsu eyes that give her.....wait for it.....a flashy explosive powerup attack that she can use to one shot main villains because.....wait for it again....she's some kind of chosen one >_>.....'sigh.'

Yeah, I'm sorry to say here but....the story is not this show's strong point >< Well....maybe it is NOW, because the action scenes are no longer it's strong point, but saying the story is it's strong point when they've done so many silly clichs, is...not much of a strong point :/ Unfortunately, whether people are willing to admit it or not, the show is more riding on the momentum of it's first season and it's very humble origins that made the show a bit of a lovable underdog.  But if this show was made by a big name corporation, I PROMISE YOU that most of the fans that are defending it right now, would be tearing it apart for all the obviously poor things it's done lately....",1479686400,,9131,4.585125998770744

7663941,5,B01BLX0UBS,"I love this series, period. From the characters and the storyline, to the backdrops and music. It alls works beautifully together to make a series that I will continue to watch for years to come. The show does have its flaws, some pacing problems, and an entire cast of magazine cover starlets, but that doesn't detract from the premise. It a bit of a slice of life anime, with healthy doses of action and fantasy/horror genres thrown in there. Oh and its also really nice to have the behind the scenes and commentary in there, keeps you satiated with all things RWBY until vol 4 starts up next Oct.",1474329600,,599,4.504587155963303

7663982,4,B01BLX0UBS,"The things on this disk that you can't get online (cast and director commentary, primarily) are excellent. If you already enjoy the series, highly recommend. The season itself... well, it starts pretty badly with a notable downgrade in animation quality since the last season, likely due to a combination of now having a significantly long fight scene every episode and the death of one of the show's best animators after the end of season 2. The writing is a real mixed bag too. But half-way through the quality starts picking itself back up and the final third of the season is absolutely phenomenal, better than ever before. So if you've already seen season 3, and you probably have, get it. If not, still get it, but know that you'll have to be a bit patient.",1470787200,,763,4.659259259259259

The first few episodes have a few rough spots as the staff got their feet under them again, but then it regains all the strengths of the earlier Volumes but with better animation and voice acting.
I bought all three volumes digitally, on DVD, and even bought all the soundtracks. This is the only Anime so far to go against the flow and be exported to Japan.",1470700800,,570,4.438095238095238

The team that made this season has done an incredible job with this season and I can happily expect more great things to come from them. The score is as intense as ever, composed by the incredible Jeff Williams and sung by his daughter, Casey Lee Williams. The season flowed well between the multiple different plots.

7664104,5,B01BLX0UBS,"This show just keeps getting better and better.  Volume 3 really kicks things into high gear for Team RWBY--nefarious plots are unfolding, and things are getting real for our heroes.  This volume quickly became my favorite; between the plot picking up pace, the introduction of more information of the World of Remnant, more characters, and a thrilling combat tournament, the action just keeps coming.

Volume 3 marks a change of pace for the RWBY world.  Viewers can see a big improvement in the animation and choreography, and it looks *great.*  The fights look so cool, which is huge for a volume featuring a combat-based tournament.  More than that, however, the volume also gives viewers a deeper insight into character- and world-development.  Volume 3 includes the World of Remnant interludes--which help develop the universe in more depth without slowing down the show--as a Special Feature, which is awesome.  The characters also get more depth; without going into spoilers, we get to see more about the families of some of our main characters, as well as learning more about each characters' desires and goals.  All in all, Volume 3 develops *so* much about the RWBY universe, and it's hard to look away.

Definitely a must-buy for RWBY fans.  The directors' and actors' commentaries are fun and informative to listen to, and the special features are always so much fun to go through.  Having the Volume to watch and re-watch is definitely worth it, especially as we wait for Volume 4.",1465603200,,1495,4.983870967741935

7664162,5,B01BLX0UBS,"Rooster Teeth; vaunted creators of the longest running web series in history, Red vs. Blue. In 2013 they debuted RWBY, the animated series created and produced but the late, beloved, and sorely missed Monty Oum. Released originally as a series of short webisodes on their website (and later to other streaming services like YouTube, Crunchyroll, and Netflix). RWBY's first ""season"" was released on Blu Ray as Volume 1, which combined the first 12 or so episodes into something of a feature-length film. Near the end of 2014, Rooster Teeth released Volume 2, the combination of ""season 2"" and after a year of frothing at the mouth, Volume 3 was released on May 3rd, 2016. I was fortunate enough to grab a copy of the latest Blu Ray release and true to form, am thoroughly impressed with Rooster Teeth Production's latest RWBY release, the first after the passing of Monty Oum.

Prior to digging into the latest release I want to throw out there a bit of a synopsis for both Volume 1 and Volume 2. Minor spoilers may occur from this point down (though I will avoid them if I can), so consider yourself warned.

Volume 1 synopsis: Volume 1, as a continuous ""feature length"" film feels a bit disjointed at times, as it is difficult to combine multiple arcs into a single, unbroken 2 hour long film. The first third of the film, or ""arc,"" introduces the primary characters for the series: Ruby Rose, Weiss Schnee, Blake Belladonna and Yang Xiao Long (Team RWBY, pronounced ""ruby""). Character development is solid, though the second ""arc"" (or middle third of the video) focuses on the secondary characters, Jaune Arc, Nora Valkyrie, Pyrrha Nikos, and Lie Ren (team JNPR, pronounced ""juniper""). The third and final arc introduces a series of sub-plots and a general overall ""arc"" that the series would presumably work towards resolving.

Volume 2 synopsis: Starting off directly after the end of the first Volume, Volume 2 introduces more villains, amongst whom is Cinder, voiced by the incredibly popular cosplayer Jessica Nigri. Over the course of nearly 2  hours, team RWBY is given significant character development, especially Blake. The pacing for Volume 2 is far better than the slightly disjointed Volume 1 and ended in a more satisfyingly manner.

On to the meat of today's review  Volume 3 on Blu Ray comes neatly packaged in the traditional Blu Ray case and contains a pair of monochromatically adorned discs. Like most Blu Ray movies, you receive an actual Blu Ray as well as a standard DVD, and when viewing in their respective players on appropriate displays, both are stunning. This is likely lent to the CG-style animation that is used throughout the series, but the DVD version looks sharp and crisp on my old 1200x800, 2010 MacBook Pro, though the colors are significantly more vibrant, lines are sharper, and the overall look of the Blu Ray disc played in my PlayStation 4 on my 1080p television still puts the original DVD to shame.

On the subject of animation quality, you can certainly tell that even between Volumes 1 and 2, Rooster Teeth animators and artists significantly improved. Backgrounds are especially noticeable when comparing the first season to the third, but that is not all. In Volumes 1 and 2 the action sequences are to die for, but the times between action scenes feel a bit wooden at times; forgivable in my opinion, because the action is simply THAT GOOD. Volume 3 steps it up a notch and truly looks like a tradition CG+painted anime, which gorgeous models, wonderful lip syncing, and utterly stunning backgrounds.

Running along the same vein is the voice acting; RWBY started strong with voice acting, but the series has only gotten better (Weiss especially; I am utterly smitten with Kara Eberle  and am fairly certain I would be reduced to a gibbering idiot were I to ever meet her). The actors' growing experience is definitely showing, as there is far more feeling in each character. In terms of audio the series is excellent, and Volume 3 is the crowning example of quality American voice-acting, however  The music, which was stunning in Volume 1, seems to have taken a back seat in Volumes 2 and 3, foregoing the voiced punk/rock motif of the first Volume, and moving towards a more instrumental aspect in the later Volumes. Not terrible, but a step backwards, and while not distracting, the music does not have quite the punch that it did in the first volume (though the songs with lyrics do appear occasionally in Volume 2, they do not appear as often as Volume 1).

Given how Volume 2 ended, I was unsure how Volume 3 would start; while the overall arc has yet to be satisfied, Volume 2 ended at a fairly solid arc ending. Volume 3 opens with an anime classic  a tournament (that is briefly mentioned in passing in Volume 2) and while the action is superb and art stellar, what I was completely not expecting was how freaking funny the first half hour of the show is. I am fairly certain that the single best line in the series is ""Silence you boob!"" Said by the ultra stern big sister of Weiss; the way she says it is just  hilarious (helps that it is accompanied by a hearty open-handed slap). Setting the relatively light tone at the start keeps on throughout the Volume while balancing some relatively heavy actions and an arc that is by far the best in the series to date. Frankly put, I can only imagine Monty Oum would be proud and honored.

In addition to the feature length ""film,"" there are a handful of trailers and extras on the Blu Ray disc. I strongly recommend spending the hour or so it takes to poke through the trailers, the audio commentary (which is great) and the Behind the Scenes featurette.

RWBY Volume 3 on Blu Ray is absolutely a must have and shows the growth and evolution of Rooster Teeth Productions, as it contains the best of all of the aspects that made Rooster Teeth who they are today.",1464048000,,5871,4.7197265625

7664169,5,B01BLX0UBS,"It's RWBY. If you have not seen it, DO!

I highly recommend Red VS Blue, and RWBY. These 2 are the best thought out, and worked out shows Rooster Teeth put out IMHO.

I own all of them. Every season. Every Soundtrack. The storyline just grabs you, the characters have steady personalities, and the jokes are endless. The action is never a let down. If I were to ever give a negative point, it would be that they don't spend enough time making these for us. Each season is about an Epic feature length film.",1463011200,,506,4.315789473684211
7664170,3,B01BLX0UBS,"It's...fine. The fights, as usual, are impressive. The additions to the cast are welcome. The character designs are a wet dream for any passionate cosplayer.

However, I feel like we may need more in future seasons than simply cool fights and flashy clothes. The tournament plot is fun for awhile, but it grinds to a halt rather oddly. Actually, a lot of things this season got thrown out before they were ripe, I think. Again, the tournament, which feels like it just ended the way it did because that's the way these stories are supposed to go. Some characters leave us before we even get to properly know them. And the entire premise of the show since the beginning pretty much gets uprooted before much could've been tapped from it, as well as rendering a fair number of established plotlines moot. It leaves me shocked and confused, as opposed to enthralled and curious like I'm guessing was intended.

Obviously this show is not going anywhere anytime soon, but I do hope Miles and Kerry are willing to break away from the planned story at least a tad. Monty's loss was an absolute tragedy, but these scripts aren't set in stone.",1463011200,2,1135,4.67

This volume was filled with suspense, action, amazing character development, and one of the best season finales I have ever seen. This season has the most in terms of cohesive plot and story, and a more driven storyline than previous seasons.

The animation is also a step up. There are not many mistakes in the animation that I saw and the movement of walking has grown much better.

I cannot recommend this series enough. It's absolutely... Ruby-tastic!",1462233600,,514,4.764044943820225

7664208,5,B01BLX0UBS,"RWBY as a show is only getting better. From animation, sound, acting, everything. It was good. Now it's GREAT!

Volume 3 is the latest from Rooster Teeth and is by far it's best. We catch up with Teams RWBY, JNPR, SSSN and meet some new teams as they all compete for their Kingdoms in the Vytal Festival, but something is lurking. Evil is in our midst. Will our heroes rise to the challenge or will everything fall to Ruin?

I cannot Stress HOW good this Volume is. Everything is great. You will laugh. You will cry. Feelings guys. FEELINGS! This is easily my favorite show in the last 5 years and it brings me boundless joy to see it grow and become popular worldwide! If you are on the fence then I recommend watching it first on the Rooster Teeth website.
