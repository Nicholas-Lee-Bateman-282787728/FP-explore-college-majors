8334362,5,B001PR023M,"by far the most informative and interesting video that depicts these heroic women-a must buy!  i was glued to the tv, i only wish it was a bit longer, but very informative nonetheless",1326585600,,183,4.545454545454546
8334363,5,B001PR023M,"Saw this video at a local civic meeting and was fascinated by the stories of these women soldiers on both sides of the Civil War.  Had to have my own copy & I've watched it twice by myself & then invited several friends over for a viewing.  After the first group showing--they all agreed they wanted to watch it a second time back-to-back.  WE DID!!  Excellent content & extremely well done. Gets my highest rating.

8334364,5,B001PR023M,"The material covered in this fascinating video production is few and far between in the Civil War video world.
It should be better known and Forgotten Grave goes a long way to this end.
It is the story of some very brave and very determined women.
I loved it and recommend it highly to any Civil War buff, student or casual viewer.
Buy it. You won't be sorry!",1253232000,4,359,4.294117647058823
