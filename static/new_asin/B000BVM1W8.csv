2443433,4,B000BVM1W8,"I was a little surprised to see it was a cartoon (apparently the whole ""Greatest Adventure Stories"" series are cartoons). As a cartoon, it takes liberties with the story, but sticks pretty close to the bible stories. Entertaining, but not exactly what I was looking for.",1285372800,,270,4.891304347826087
2443434,5,B000BVM1W8,"I've been waiting a long time for this DVD series to appear .Its not available in the UK for some strange reason. A nice cartoon for all ages to learn about the Bible Moses. These days its difficult to find good Bible cartoons that are faithful to the scriptures , but this series seems to be the exception. There are 13 Hanna-Barbera Bible cartoons in this series called ""The greatest Adventure-Stories from The Bible"". All 13 titles are as follows ,Daniel And The Lions Den ,Joshua And The Battle Of Jericho ,Noah's Ark, Samson And Delilah ,The Nativity, Jonah , David And Goliath , Joseph And His Brothers , Moses , Queen Esther , The Creation , The Easter Story and The Miracles Of Jesus.

2443435,5,B000BVM1W8,I loved these as a teenager and used the entire series at summer camp.  My daughter really loves them now and I still enjoy them.  We love Hanna Barbera Cartoons.  I only wish they were sold as a complete set.,1204329600,3,209,4.175
2443436,5,B000BVM1W8,3 kids travel back in time to interact in the culture of the time. Animated & interesting for my boys.  My 3 & 6 year old really enjoy these VHS & would watch them daily but we watch them 1-2 times a month.,1198972800,4,206,3.7906976744186047
2443437,1,B000BVM1W8,Completely destroyed! No way we could watch it!,1414886400,,47,5.0
2443438,5,B000BVM1W8,Great tool for teaching grandchildren about Bible stories!,1410566400,,58,6.375
2443439,5,B000BVM1W8,"I watched this movie as a kid, 15+ years ago.  It is exactly as I remember it, in all it's poor animation glory. :) Love rewatching it and sharing it with the kids I nanny and niece and nephew.",1385942400,,193,3.948717948717949
2443440,5,B000BVM1W8,"I enjoy the Hanna-Barbera versions of the Bible stories very much. The fact that modern day kids return to the past is a little far fetched, but basically this follows the Bible story of Mose's life, although a lot is left out.",1384560000,,227,4.428571428571429
2443441,5,B000BVM1W8,I purchased several of these bible videos for my daughter. I had these on VHS when I was growing up & they did a good job of teaching the bibical lessons and stories in an entertaining way.,1368230400,,189,4.135135135135135
2443442,4,B000BVM1W8,I remember these from childhood and they are just as good as I remember. My daughter cannot get enough immediately after watching The Greatest Adventure Stories From the Bible: The Miracles of Jesus she asked to watch it again. I've found them to be very close to scriptures and even having the teenagers transported back in time doesn't detract from the stories. I only wish all the ones I remember as a child were available on DVD.,1345420800,,433,4.636363636363637
2443443,5,B000BVM1W8,"My wife and I grew up watching this series, and we wanted to share it with a girl's orphanage in Haiti, so we purchased any we could find with French language or subtitles. The videos are now with the girls who love such Biblical cartoons.",1334188800,,239,4.333333333333333
2443444,5,B000BVM1W8,This video was exactly what I wanted. I remember watching these bible stories as a child and it helped me understand the written word the Bible.,1334188800,,144,4.576923076923077
2443445,5,B000BVM1W8,"when I was a child I had the entire collection of these videos.  I watched them more than I watched my disney movies!!!! And it was not because my parents were super religious and made me, it was because I genuinely thought they were excellent movies.  The videos have 3 young characters in the movie that take a time warp back to Biblical times and experience biblical events first hand. All the movies are great.  Not like some of the secular cartoons today.  If you want your child to learn the main stories of the Bible, I highly recommend these.  They worked for me.  Granted they are over 20 years old, they still accuratly represent the Bible even if they don't have the best animation.",1325635200,,693,4.504
2443446,5,B000BVM1W8,"My kids (ages 5 and 2) loves the Greatest Adventure series. I grew up watching these on VHS, and I was so happy to find that a few of them have been made available on DVD. These are far superior to Veggie Tales and other modern sugar-coated kid-friendly interpretations of Bible stories. My kids are actually learning the true story of Moses, and they love it. They'd rather watch this than anything else.",1307577600,,405,4.561643835616438

8093334,5,B000BVM1W8,"This episode is funny, entertaining, and very close to the bible. The animation, music and performances were good.
There is only one thing I can complain about, and it's the fact that the complete series needs to be released on DVD, instead of just 5 episodes.",1473984000,,260,4.673913043478261
8093335,5,B000BVM1W8,"I bought this book for my daughter in law, who is from Thailand. She was just becoming good at English, and was also interested in Bible Stories. This was a perfect way for her to navigate the larger print, with simpler explanations, AND the Bonus of colorful illustrations to help imprint the story in her memory. I would recommend it for young people, or those who are not yet fluent enough in English to study the Bible.",1464912000,,423,4.5064935064935066
