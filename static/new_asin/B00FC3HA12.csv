5974993,5,B00FC3HA12,Basically agree with everyone else--they said it better!  Also want to register my request for an American version with English subtitles.,1407283200,4,138,5.571428571428571
5974994,5,B00FC3HA12,"I should perhaps start by saying that I rarely watch a series of anything, but I started to watch this one, and then, promptly, ""couldn't put it down."" The costumes, scenery, clothing and automobiles, though true to the period, become almost a footnote to the drama and relationships which ensue. From 1905, when the series starts, up to  the story's cliffhanger on New Year's Eve of 1907, one is taken on a journey of intrique, jealousy, passion, power, manipulation and murder. The powerful and woven storylines pale, however, compared to the passion and romance throughout the series,none so intense, involved and lasting as Alicia and Julio's. Up to this point, this can all be seen on Netflix,comprising the first 2 seasons in Spanish with subtitles. The third and last season can be seen on YouTube, without subtitles.
Unbelievably, all the passion, intrigue and plot twists work. One starts with a very rigid caste system, which slowly evolves as Alicia and Julio begin their passionate friendship, as Alicia is grudgingly asked to help Julio find his missing sister, who was last heard from as she worked in the Hotel. With very few kisses in between, their relationship is finally consumated in chapter 26, about 35 hours into the story. Another perhaps 60 hours of viewing later, their three year relationship has shifted so many relationships that when they publicly kiss one another on the balcony of the hotel, everyone smiles, even the Matriach of the family and the head housekeeper. At this point, only the guests are shocked to see a highborn woman kissing a waiter, something that until that point had been painstakingly avoided, as all clandestine relationships usually are.
This is not, however a Wuthering Heights or a Pride and Prejudice, though it certainly has some of their best features. There are dozens of characters, in addition to the Alarcon family, and enough plot twists to keep the most fidgetty person rivetted to the Spanish countryside. It's intelligent and sentively played. Even though there are too many unexpected plots to mention, the story doesn't become labored, boring, trite or predictable. Julio and Alicia are gorgeous, but have depth besides chemistry. Jon Gonzales,as Julio, who was once a model, is given a fantastic haircut, which is short and modern in the back, but gives him a thick mane in front with a prominant cowlick. This works beautifully, just one of thousands of details which work in the story. I'm quite sure the actors had bittersweet feelings about ending the series, just as I did when I read Gone With the Wind more than 20 years ago. To me, this is far better.
There are those who are watching the 3rd season, not understanding the Spanish,yet too umpatient to wait until it is produced with English subtitles... I believe that says it all !",1407110400,135,2812,4.945031712473573
5974995,5,B00FC3HA12,"They hit the ball out of the park with the bases loaded.

The actresses are world-class. Alicia, Belen, Sofia, and Dona Teresa are fantastic. Angela is very good too.

Is there a version with English Subtitles for the U.S.?",1406764800,21,133,4.782608695652174

The Spanish name for the series is Grand Hotel Colera. IMDB = ""Grand Hotel"" Colera 2013.

5974999,5,B00FC3HA12,"Music from the Bernard Hermann school...it is superb
Wonderful airy well lit and colourful filming
Very high production values, sets, period costumes, extras and genuine hotel setting
Amazing number of tightly woven plot lines and loads of pace and nail biting climaxes
Wonderful pair of central characters, handsome and sexy...plenty of romantic live interest
.....and underneath it all a sort of rich man poor man story involving murder, mystery, inheritance, fraud and conspiracy

....All of Europe is raving over it!  Seek it out on pay to view. I am watching it on SKY ARTS and it is an artistic programme...it is so well done. I missed Season One, but will eventually get that.

If you haven't got Sky, get the box.",1392595200,44,721,4.9421487603305785
5975000,5,B00FC3HA12,"I have also seen this series on Netflix with English subtitles and it is the most fantastic series Ive ever seen!! Luckily I am a native Spanish speaker, but am much better at English and had a slight difficult time with the accent or should I say dialect of Spain.
Bottom line, I ordered this entire series from Amazon.
Being that Netflix has removed this series all is not lost. This series was remade in Mexico with Mexican actors and it is just as Fantastic. The Mexican series is called El Hotel de Los Secretros (The Hotel of Secrets). This series is also available here on Amazon, which I just ordered.
El hotel de Los Secretros series has all the same characters and the main premise of the series is the same. The difference is majority of the plots are different or go in different directions than Grand Hotel. I thought I would see the same plots as Grand Hotel b, but boy was I wrong. I is different and I enjoy not knowing what will happen as to me it is a totally new series and just as enjoyable.
If you are unable to purchase El hotel de Los Secretros you can now view it on Netflix. And yes El Hotel de Los Secretros does have English subtitles.
So if youve already watched Grand Hotel give El Hotel de Los Secretros a try in watching the same characters involved in plots with all new twist and turns.
If you lost your chance in seeing Grand Hotel you now have a chance is viewing El Hotel de Los Secretros.
BTW, did I mention that El Hotel de Los Secretros is FANTASTIC!!!! It is in the same league as Grand Hotel",1483228800,,1532,4.286206896551724

At least for me. Seriously?! Julio & Alicia are my all-time favorite couple! Ayala & Hernando make me laugh out loud. Javier & the scoundrel that he is & all the nonsense he gets himself into. I went MIA while binge watching this, completely sucked in, & was so sad when it came to an end. Reading the subtitles didn't bother me in the least. I found it just got all of my senses even more involved. This show is my absolute favorite! Love, love, love it! I was swept away with all the characters & drama!

I'm so sad that the license with Netflix is ending this month & it'll no longer be available (11/15/16) here in America.

I have really enjoyed watching all three seasons on Netflix with the English subtitles, but with it leaving (Netflix) in November 2016 I really want to buy the series. However, so far I haven't been able to find a US (region 1) version with English subtitles. With how popular it is here in the States I'm surprised they haven't released one yet.

Everything is done to set up a torrid, molten climax, but at the end of season one they [SPOILER ALERT] share a fairly dry kiss and (I think, although I'm not done) part ways for a while. Julio looks more engaged with sister--heck even his room mate-- than with Alicia.  Can I get an amen?",1475712000,,382,4.232876712328767

This was thrilling. The writing, the acting, the light hearted nature of the themes albeit at times nail biting, even bringing in Agatha Christie for an episode or two to play up the time period as well as other historical references. Superb! Better than most English language tv I watched this year and may be one of my favorite series of all time.

Plenty of eye candy, but the character development and entertaining stories is what gets you. Excellent Spanish and good English subtitles. I really want to purchase this series and hope a great quality bluray is made of it to play on all USA bluray players. I hope the price is way less than $89 because I know it will sell. I recommended to anyone who loves a good mystery, drama, soap operas, period movies or even for curiosity. I dare say it equals Downton Abbey. I do say it had more umph! Passion!

That being said, **I'm going to get it, and I've already seen it, it's *that* good.** For anyone interested in watching a truly captivating time-period drama, you must have this.  It's a turn of the century Spanish soap opera and whodunit as well as a period piece. If you like Downtown Abbey or if you like the books (or the movies) Pride and Prejudice, Jane Eyre, Love in the Time of Cholera or the Downtown Abby series...or even the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series in some ways, then you will like this. Be warned...once you begin watching you will be drawn in and it is very tricky to stop! One of the main characters, Julio, is quite handsome and both men and women alike are drawn to his charm. Sometimes the violin music (during tense scenes) can be a little overplayed and the sets are a wee but repetitive (only if you really look or if you were binge-watching like I was) but the wardrobe, development of the characters and their personalities and the way they're drawn into the script is *excellent* You'll be hearing about this series in the next year so you'll want to own it. :)",1437350400,3,1188,4.525581395348837

Impossible to leave it, and every episode finishes with a cliff-hanger, and you simply have to watch the next episode. I watched all 66 episodes (44 minutes each) in just over 3 weeks, neglecting much else. Everything everyone has written is true: wonderful and gorgeous looking cast, and beautifully and sincerely acted. Production values just as good as DA, and the story has so many twists and turns, to make everyone dizzy. This is soap opera and soap operetta at its best. Lots of listening at doorways; no one seems to lock their doors, and truly incredulous people being where they shouldn't be, yet just at the right time. Great entertainment.

At first I thought it might be a little cheezy but I kept watching and before i knew it I was hooked.  Yikes!  It's terrific entertainment, has gorgeous sets, beautiful costumes, a plot with action, suspense, romance, pathos and humor.  The action is very fast with so many unexpected and shocking events crammed into short periods of time that it makes your head spin.  At times I wondered how many times people would sneak into other's bedrooms and search through their drawers or how many faces would get slapped, but even the silliest of the plot devices were completely forgiven in light of the overall production.  Special mention must be given to the terrific cast.  Since I'm not familiar with Spanish actors, to me these people were the characters.  They must have had a wonderful time making this show.  The characters were very well written, most of them were well rounded and completely believable even when doing
unbelievable things.  It was good to see them change and grow, especially dear Andres and his wonderful mamma, Dona Angela.
 The romantic leads  lead couple is perfecto!  Julipo is truly a star....what a sweetie and oh-that-hairdo!  Alicia is every bit the fairy tail princess with her tiny waist line  and  huge blue eyes. Javier gives much needed humor at just the right moments.  I could rant on and on but I 'll just say that it's a totally terrific, satisfying series.  It's just about the right length, too.

The brotherly love between Andres & Julio was so touching, couldn't hold back the tears. The chemistry between Alicia & Julio is so sweet & passionate that one would believe that these two actors really love one another.

This series is as other people have said, addictive! The opulence of the scenery, clothes, and the hotel
itself is pure eye candy. The romance of the lead characters are so intense and tangible.
The story takes you into twists and turns, through love, hate, envy, greed, mayhem and murder.

You will find it hard to leave an episode for another day, I have lost precious sleep to watch just one
more episode, that turns into two or three. The actors were great and believable. Kudos to the writers
of the series, they have done a great job in making a superb story come to life.

On Downton, several of the main characters haven't had a good story in 2 or more seasons. Also, all of the stories are woven together extremely well. One murder ties into another and another.

The romance was perfect -- lots of kissing and moderate, tender intimacy, instead of the tiring in-your-face sex that is in so many shows these days. The setting was lovely and I'm sure boosted vacation trips to Spain to see the lavish hotel. There wasn't one character that I tired of seeing, especially the Inspector and ""Agent"".

5975070,2,B00FC3HA12,"I selected this series to watch on Netflix because the blurb suggested it was a murder mystery and because I also like costume dramas such as Downton Abbey.  But Gran Hotel is really a soap opera, with very little compelling material aside from the addictive dovetailing and elongating of stories characteristic of soaps.  The romance between the major characters lacks spark, and the set up for their eventual consummation is ridiculous.  The costumes and sets are a delight, but the music is irritating because its lack of subtlety intensifies the soap opera vibe.  The inclusion of emerging technologies and police procedures in that historical period gives the series some potential (and bumped my review up a star).  But this potential is completely undermined by the exasperating fact that eavesdropping is the primary plot propellant in multiple scenes in every single episode.  The repetition of this situation, where the audience watches the characters watching each other, is boring.  It hinders character development and results in wooden acting.  I admit that I couldn't look away from the twists and turns, which were simultaneously far-fetched and predictable.  But ultimately I felt Id wasted my time watching this series.",1417910400,2,1237,5.302564102564102

This is not a movie that you can step away from the television and keep up with what is happening as things are moving right along.

 It was full of mystery, and drama, with a wonderful balance of humor in every episode.

The characters were fabulous, and really fit the parts that they played.  Wonderful chemistry between all of them.
If you see season one and two, you absolutely must see season three.

When the series ended, my husband and I were so please at how they ended the series.  We are hoping to find another series out there that will be as wonderfully done as this one.  I don't think that we will as this was so fabulous that I hope that it won every award available.
