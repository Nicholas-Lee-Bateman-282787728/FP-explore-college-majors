8483957,3,B005R12PAK,"This is Freddie Mercury in Review 1946-1991 by Chrome Dome.  I'm not sure why they keep repackaging and renaming the same information.  If you've seen the first one, don't waste your time or money.  Thankfully I checked this one out of the library and discovered I already had the original one at home.  I like the video, I just wanted something new.",1332979200,19,350,4.596774193548387
