7991401,1,B00009MEDZ,"I write this in order to hopefully be a voice of reason in comparison to the obvious shill reviewers pumping this movie up as something fantastic. I am ASTOUNDED that any reviewer would even consider this a decent movie. Importantly, I like indie films. I don't require a movie to have the polish and bells and whistles of a big-time Hollywood production to like it or see it's merit. But this is just BAD.

I am not including a spoiler because it doesn't even really matter. Essentially what you end up with is a nonexistent plot about some douche-bag that carries around a straight razor that he fondles almost sexually at any opportunity. The performance is scary, but only in the sense that it is totally without nuance and talent and is painful to watch. ""Anna"" is an embarrassing mess of a portrayal. She's meant to come off awkward and shy, but the result is just simply CONFUSING.

The lines of both the main character and his would-be girlfriend are delivered in very stilted fashion, clearly shot one line at a time. The inflection changes awkwardly from shot to shot. Almost NEVER are the two characters seen interacting with them both in the frame. The script is terrible too! The dialog is beyond awkward and is written like a first, rough draft, without thought for the implications of the wording of the lines.

I could get into the way the movie is shot in more depth, but there's really no point. The plot is confusing, the (albeit limited) special effects are trash, etc. etc.

I wouldn't ordinarily take my time to trash somebody's movie, but this was worse than anything I've seen in recent years. I spent 54 cents renting it (truly!) and I wanted to demand my money back. Avoid this camcorder masterpiece or watch it just for laughs. The problem with that, though, is that it is just BORING.",1301270400,,1812,4.635514018691588
7991402,4,B00009MEDZ,"Zach Hansen's KILLER ME is a chilling psychological study of two people building a very unusual relationship. Even when you think you see what's coming, this film keeps you off-balance and draws you in to the emotional turmoil of the two lead characters.

George Foster makes his character, Joseph, come alive in all his technicolor torment. Christina Kew gives a great performance as the strangely bold-yet-timid female lead (Anna) who sometimes seems almost to take her own breath away with her actions.

Watching the relationship evolve between these two is fascinating, and only becomes moreso as the story unfolds.

This film is not for everyone, but will appeal to a broad range of film fans, while refusing to neatly fit into any single category. There are things in this film that we never figure out or know for certain, but one thing that is certain is that Joseph is emotionally disturbed, and suffers from post-traumatic stress syndrome. Anna is obviously not only attracted to but somehow drawn to Joseph.

This is one of those rare films that succeeds in leaving the viewer satisfied without answering all the questions and filling in the blanks.",1096416000,,1160,4.994818652849741
7991403,4,B00009MEDZ,I've seen a lot of films in this genre. The film was at times slow but had a purpose. I liked the character development between the leads that I didn't really expect. At times the film was very chilling. If you like the serial killer type genre you'll really like this.,1066867200,2,269,4.294117647058823
7991404,5,B00009MEDZ,"I actually saw this movie during Method Fest and I have two words to describe this film: great experience. There are a lot of independent movies that are made each year. Very few get distribution, and of those, very few make an impact. ""Killer Me"" has conquered the two. It does not surprise me. Skillfully directed, the film reveals itself as a treasure. Specially for those who like to observe human nature. I forsee ""Killer Me"" becoming the next cult movie for horror and thriller fans. Even for those who just stumble upon it and don't count genre films among their favorites I have to say you won't be disappointed. The film will make you fall in love again with filmmaking.",1053388800,8,679,4.619834710743802
7991405,5,B00009MEDZ,"I saw this at the Telluride Film Festival a couple summers ago and it is one of the most truly unsettling films I've seen in recent memory.  It's reminiscent of ""Henry: A Portrait of a Serial Killer"" but has moments of tenderness between the two leads that rivals the best Hollywood romances.  I don't want to ruin the climactic scene, but it's quite astonishing.",1053302400,5,363,4.65625
