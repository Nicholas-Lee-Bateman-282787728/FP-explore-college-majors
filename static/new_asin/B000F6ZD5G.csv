8118317,5,B000F6ZD5G,"As descendant of Juan Ponce de Leon found this story very accurate ,fascinating.
However they failed to mention that Juan encouraged this tale of the fountain of youth to persuade  the sailors  to keep exploring when they noticed  the natives  did not carry gold jewelry, which was the motivator to keep traveling in very difficult conditions.
Juan distinguished himself fighting against the  Muslins armies in Spain and in service of the crown.
Probably if he was not killed by the native poisoned arrow, the east coast may have been speaking Spanish today.
Have fun.
