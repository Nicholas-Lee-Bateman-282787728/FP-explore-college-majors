2520280,5,B000EHQ86O,"Vince McManhon is so stupid ritre now. Look

he doesnt care about how other company is catching up rite now but all he does is f*ck Shawn Michaels up. if wwe doesnt do anything, TNA will be better than WWE in upcoming years. Every talent that WWE fired or didn't need, TNA hired them(Dudleys, Stings, Christian, Rhyno). And in the future it will be Brock Lesnar, Goldberg, The Rock). Christy Hemme is talking to TNA officials also.

I don't know if WWE loses those like the Rock or Austin, who the hell is gonna watch WWE

Why the hell doesnt McManhon stop caring about money and care about their talents a lil bit more. Why don't you make HBK the champ instead of that stupid piece of crap John Cena, cant rap cant wrestle, This is World Wrestling Entertainment, not World Rapping Competition

if i were Vince McManhon i would let these be champs: Taker, HHH, HBK, Ric, Big Show, Kane, JBL(much more talented than CENA), Shelton but honestly any would not care if anyone becomes champ except for Cena.",1139616000,,1002,4.55

2520295,4,B000EHQ86O,"The sole reason I bought No Way Out on DVD was because of the main event world title match between The Undertaker and Kurt Angle. These guys delivered on so many different levels that it's almost hard to describe how well they gelled on this night. Anyone who thinks that The Undertaker is too old will be proven wrong with one watch of this match. Another review put it best: these guys put on a straight-up wrestling clinic. I'm hard to impress, but this was a classic bout.

Another match that impressed me was the U.S. championship match with Benoit and Booker T. I never had the honor to see any of their three-of-seven fights, so this match was relatively fresh in my eyes. The angle of Booker being injured severely annoyed me, and so did Tazz and Michael Cole's commentating (for once), but the match itself was enjoyable and worth the price of admission.

The rest of No Way Out 2006's card was forgettable and mediocre at best, but the two aforementioned matches are worth the twenty dollars for the DVD. It gives me hope that guys like Angle, Undertaker, and Benoit will be around long enough to give WWE a much needed surge of energy.",1148601600,,1146,4.531400966183575

2520299,4,B000EHQ86O,"The show starts with a video that shows that this PPV is the most important night on the road to WrestleMania. Michael Cole and Tazz welcome you to The 1st Mariner Arena in Baltimore, Maryland and they give you a some history about wresting in this arena.

Match 1-Cruiserweight Championship- Gregory Helms vs Paul London vs Scotty 2 Hotty vs Nunzio vs Brian Kendrick vs Super Crazy vs Psicosis vs Funaki vs Kid Kash-This is a very exciting way to start the show. A lot of high flying moves and near falls make this match one of the best Cruiserweight matches I've seen in a long time- 8/10

Match 2- JBL vs Bobby Lashley- The match starts when Finlay carries Krystal out to the ring and is about to hurt her when Lashley shows up and gets in to a fist fight with Finlay. JBL comes out and the match begins. This match is pretty much a fist fight with the exception of a few wrestling moves from Lashley, includng a cool suplex outside of the ring. This match is nothing special but pretty decsent. 7/10

Batista come out and gives a truly spine tingling speech. I can't wait for him to return!

Match 3- MNM vs Matt Hardy and Tatanka- This is pretty dull tag team match that was made worse by the fact that the belts weren't on the line. The match was halfway descent when Hardy was in the ring but Tatanka's contribution to this match was mediocre at best. At one stage in the match the crowd started a 'boring' chant. 5.5/10

Match 4- United States Championship- Booker T vs Chris Benoit- Even though this rivalry is getting a little bit old, I can't take away the fact that this is a very good match and probably one of the best matches they've had in WWE. Near falls, outside action, top rope moves, clean submission holds and an interesting storyline, are all the ingredients for a first class performance. 8.5/10

Match 5- Rey Mysterio's WrestleMania 22 Title Shot  on the line- Rey Mystero vs Randy Orton- I was expecting a much much better performance by both of these men. The majority of the match consists of Randy Orton beating up Rey Mysterio, with the ocassonal fight back by Rey. When Rey finally started to get on a roll towards the end of the match, it became somewhat exciting. I was not happy with the result as I felt once the match got exciting, it should've gone on a bit longer. Overall this match is Orton beating up Rey for 10 minutes, Rey building some momentum and then Rey getting screwed out of WrestleMania 22 title shot. 6/10

Match 6- World Heavyweight Championship- Kurt Angle vs Undertaker- WOW. What can I say? This is the best match I've seen since Angle vs Michaels from WrestleMania 21. Angle reverses the Chokeslam, Last Ride, Tombstone and a leg drop outside the ring into The Anklelock. There were so many exxciting moments in this match. During the match I needed to go to the toilet, but I didn't want to leave my seat because every second of this match was exciting. The fact that the title was on the line made the match even more exciting (if that's possible). 10/10

*By the way, if you've seen Taker and Angles match on Smackdown! in 2003, I'll tell you now that this match is better!

No Way Out 2006 is one of the best brand only PPV'S I've ever seen. I encourage any wrestling fan to buy this DVD. I hope that this is a sign of things to come at WrestleMania 22.",1147305600,2,3314,4.409165302782324
2520300,4,B000EHQ86O,"I said this on my Armageddon review but usually, SmackDown PPV's are just really bad for various reasons but this one was the second one in a row that it was something I would actually watch again.  Again, it's not perfect but it's still good.

Crusierweight Champion Gregory Helms vs. Scotty 2 Hotty vs. Paul London vs. Brian Kendrick vs. Super Crazy vs. Psicosis vs. Nunzio vs. Kid Kash vs. Funaki - Well, the yearly cruiserweight push is in full effect here.  It's a great opening match for everyone to go ahead & get their spots in.  Crusierweights will always get a PPV off to a great start.

Bobby Lashley vs. JBL - One of JBL's best performance I've seen from him because he doesn't just to his usual ""slow brawling while I bleed"" formula and also doesn't make Lashley look ""green.""  The story with Finlay in the beginning was also a nice twist to not make Lashley look weak in defeat.

MNM vs. Matt Hardy & Tatanka - This was was suprizing good as MNM are the best tag team in WWE today (hey, they even carred ou of shape Animal & Heidenrich to decent matches), Matt Hardy is a great wrestler when he's allowed to be, and even Tatanka kept up with everyone else eventhough he's been out of the WWE for almost a decade.  A great tag team match.

U.S. Champion Booker T vs. Chris Benoit - Honestly, these two don't have a bad match but after seeing them face each other so many times (best of 7 in WCW, best of 4 in WWE, along with other matches here & there setting up these series) that there was nothing new here & the match just seemed repetative.

Randy Orton vs. Rey Mysterio - I won't waste space about the Eddie Guerrero storyline going into this except for the fact that I didn't like it PERIOD!  As for the match, it wasn't horrible but it wasn't anything memorable.  You would think they would have the whole ""Mysterio's gonna kill him"" mentality but no, Mysterio had no emotion in this match & just ""walked through"" his performance while Orton just DOMINATED the whole match and got a cheap pin at the end.

World Champion Kurt Angle vs. The Undertaker - This match was worth the money alone.  With the exception of their Fully Loaded 2000 match, these two have NEVER had a bad match and always tore the house down.  This is a step below their SmackDown match (on Undertaker's DVD) but still great.  Mat wrestling & their typical spots...it's just something great to watch and the ending is something that just came out of nowhere.

Also somewhere on here, Batista makes a special appearence to which got one of the loudest pop of the night just to thank the fans & say a few words.

DVD extras include Mark Henry confronting Batista backstage, Booker T & Sharmell being scared off by Boogeyman, and Kurt Angle's post-match interview being interrupted by Randy Orton.

Overall, I would get this because I was pleased overall after I watched this.",1146960000,10,2864,4.4836223506743735

Nice Batista promo that gives one message when I come back I'm getting back the world heavyweight championship.

3-MNM vs Matt Hardy and Tatanka- Nice match that has some well done tag team moves and nice teamwork. MNM takes a loss when Takanka delivers a samoan drop. winners Hardy and Tatanka 7/10

4. Booker T vs Chris Benoit- Great match with a lot of reversals and near falls. Funny start with Booker T saying that he is goona forfeit his title due to his so called injury. winner-Chris Benoit 9/10

5. Rey Mysterio vs Randy Orton- Good match with Mysterio taking some big bumps. Nice move outside when Orton sits Mysterio on the post like a baseball bat. Could've been longer but with the time given this was a  good match. winner- Randy Orton 8.5/10

6. Undertaker vs Angle- WOW what a match. Lots of reversals with Angle giving Taker the ankle lock numerous times. Taker's Angle must be very soar. Great effort by both men and very nice energy in the match. I've never seen anyone control the Undertaker like the way Angle did. Just buy the dvd for this match alone. Perfect match with a suprising ending. Winner- Kurt Angle 10/10

RATING: 85/100

Undertaker vs. Kurt Angle

Wow! What a setup this match had! It really did deliver for me. I feel that the only thing missing here was some high risk moves (perhaps an Angle moonsault) and maybe a few of each other's finishers thrown into the mix. A phenomenal match that has to be appreciated. Well done to my 2 favourites!

2520303,4,B000EHQ86O,"I was Ringside for the NWO 06 in Baltimore. The last two matches made this PPV, with the other matches either being boring or lack of storyline.  I was disappointed with MNM vs Matt Hardy/Tanakka match. What the hell was that? This is pay per view. This match seemed like it was dark match. If WWE is going to put Matt Hardy back in Tag Teams, he needs to be with his brother.

Randy Orton/Rey Mesterio  storyline was amusing with Randy treading on Eddies memory to get additional heat from the fans. I was actually surprised WWE didn't put Eddie's family at ringside and have Randy diss them right there. Along with the Hell in the Match with Undertaker at Armageddon, Orton has proven he can headline/carry a PPV.

Undertaker/Angle match was an Instant Classic. These matches are the reason WWE is so entertaining.

1. Gauntlet Match For The Cruserweight Championship: Gregory Helmes defended the cruserweight title in a nine man gauntlet match, pretty fair back and fourth action with some respectable high spots, Helmes eventually retains

2. JBL vs Bobby Lahsley: Curiously, Lashley dominates the match with good strong power moves and is kept firmly hidden in terms of weaknesses with such capability and timing, but his momentum pays a price as he jobs for the second time (he lost to Kane and Big Show as part of the Survivor Series team, but they dont' bother mentioning that), but officially, loses his one on one winning streak. Odd booking, but good power based match that JBL sells convincingly.

3. MNM vs Matt Hardy and Tatanka: Well at least it wasn't Road Warrior Animal agai, but another broken down legend who has no buisness wrestling on the rosters, Hardy is screwed, after having intense wars with Edge he could easily have main evented Wrestlemnania against the R-Rated ratings drawer, but due to a slight mishap involving The Undertaker backstage, has been treated poorly in the undercard. Hardy and MNM make the most of this and the match comes off strongly better due to their efforts carrying the match for Tatanka, who contributes what he can and is used well enough to make the match watchable ***1/2

4. WWE United States Championship: Chris Benoit vs Booker T: Bookers' real life injuries had forced a long stroyline of Booker using substitutes to fend off Benoit, Booker, now forced to defend it himself began this solid match by almost forefeitin the title, only to attack Benoit. For a guy with a groin tear Booker holds his own well in this back and fourth intense match, or that could simply be the miracle of how well Benoit sells and works with an opponent. Sharmell is knocked from the ropes and a crossface forces Booker to tap. Benoit wins the belt ****1/2

5. Wrestlemania 22 Title Shot Challenge : Randy Orton vs Rey Mysterio: As muchas Mysterio didn't deserve to go over on Eddies' memory alone, Orton gained nothing from being booked to spit on the same guys' legacy, he was over wlel enough without it, and here, it shows how well. Orton dominates half of the match, odd booking for a match involving your top player babyface. Mysterio finally gets the advantage, eventually leading into some great high spots like Orton drop kicking Mysterio in mid-air. Orton gets the win when Mysterio botches the 619, using the ropes as leverage. Orton is going to 'Mania, but then, so is Mysterio, who blubbers on SD, forcing Theodore Long to add him to the main event anyway. Solid outing with a poorly booked beggining and too much offense from the heel ***

6. World Heavyweight Championship: Kurt Angle vs the Undertaker: An amazing match that told a story, 'Taker and Angle have ""never"" tapped out officially, to one or the other, and the match was built on a decisive win between the two, they never really have had one. Highlights include the psanish announce table being demolished, Angle reversing most of 'Takers' finishers into the ankle lock, and the contraversial finish where Angle pins 'Taker when he puts Angle in a triangle choke. *****",1140739200,,3365,4.833333333333333

In 2000, No Way Out shocked the world with the brutal Hell in a Cell match between Triple H and Cactus Jack. In 2001, No Way Out became a hugely enjoyable pay per view in its entirety. And in 2004, SmackDown! presented a single brand Pay Per View that glorified Latino wrestlers and their ability when Eddie Guerrero won the WWE Championship. This year, No Way Out promised an amazing main event and an enjoyable undercard, but was it good enough?

1) Nine Man Elimination Match for the Cruiserweight Championship

Gregory Helms vs. Kid Kash vs. Super Crazy vs. Psicosis vs. Nunzio vs. Funaki vs. Scotty 2 Hotty vs. Brian Kendrick vs. Paul London

SmackDown! hasn't been about Cruiserweights for a very long time, but this match suprises and turns out to be an enjoyable bout. Not as good as the Cruiserweight Invitational at the Royal Rumble, but has its momemts, with lots of high flying moves and close falls.

  3/5

2) J.B. Layfield (w/Jillian Hall) vs. Lashley

Lashley has a bright future in the WWE, but he is still very green. Nothertheless, this match really suprises. JBL is a power wrestler and watching the former WWE Champion being thrown around by Lashley could be painful but here its done very well.

  3/5

3) Matt Hardy and Tatanka vs. MNM

Tatanka was Matt Hardy's suprises partner, but he wasn't very suprising. Tatanka is old and shouldn't be wrestling, but MNM have a bright future ahead of them as a young tag team. Matt Hardy really needs a push by the WWE, he's stuck in matches like this. Still, this match also suprises and doesn't make itself a card filler.

  3/5

4) United States Championship

  Chris Benoit vs. Booker T (w/Sharmell)

I was very skeptical when I first heard about this match. After all, we've already seen it eight times in the space of two and a half months (that's not an exaggeration) why do we want to pay to see it again? However, when I saw the actual match, I realised it was being used as a kind of final encounter match. Chris Benoit and Booker T are both amazing wrestlers, and all their matches have been so. This is no different. It's certainly not their best encounter, but it is one of them.

  4/5

5) For Rey Mysterio's Title Oppurtunity at WrestleMania

  Rey Mysterio vs. Randy Orton

The fued that built this up was just tasteless. Randy Orton spitting on Eddie Guerrero's great legacy just shows that the WWE Creative Team have no ideas. They had battled before on SmackDown! a few months back, and this was not as good. It was very one-sided and had a terrible tasteless ending.

  3/5

6) World Heavyweight Championship

  Kurt Angle vs. The Undertaker

Angle promoised that this match would be match of the year. To be honest, it would be hard for anything to top this. Both men used all their technical abilities and their amazing arsenal of moves and battled for an astonishing twenty-seven minutes. These men used everything on each other, and Angle must have used the Ankle Lock a good nine times. This is what SmackDown! Main Events should be about. No stipulations, no interference, just two people battling for the title. Amazing.

Gregory Helms(c) vs Paul London vs Brian Kendrick vs Nunzio vs Kid Kash vs Funaki vs Super Crazy vs Psicosis vs Scotty Too Hotty

More excellent cruiserweight action out of these men. After absorbing 3 finishers from Kendrick, London and Scotty, Helms was still able to walk away with the Cruiserweight title

Winner and STILL Cruiserweight Champion: Gregory Helms

John Bradshaw Layfield vs Bobby Lashley

They could have done so much more with this match, in my view. JBL gets a nasty cut near his eye, but picks up the win with some help from Finlay

Winner: JBL

Matt Hardy and partner vs MNM (non-title)

Hardy's partner turns out to be Tatanka. Not a horrible match, but one that's ok to skip. Hardy and Tatanka win with simultaneous Twist of Fate/Samoan Drop

Winners: Matt Hardy and Tatanka

Match rating: 2/5

United States Championship

Booker T(c) vs Chris Benoit

Booker tries to put one over on the fans, saying he'll forfeit the US title, but attacks Benoit and the match begins. Booker was mostly dominant, but Benoit comes back, locks in the Sharpshooter and switches into the Crippler Crossface for the US title

Winner and NEW United States Champion: Chris Benoit

Randy Orton vs Rey Mysterio

Winner Goes to Wrestlemania

Great match. Randy uses his size to dominant Rey, but Rey uses his unorthodox style and quickness to keep the Legend Killer off balance. Randy wins by using the ropes

Winner: Randy Orton

World Heavyweight Championship

Kurt Angle(c) vs Undertaker

Match of the year in my view. Both men were equally agressive and both deserve to be the World Heavyweight Champion. Undertaker goes through the announce table and escapes the Ankle Lock at least 4 times. Angle reverses the Triangle Choke into a jack knife pin to retain the World Heavyweight title

An awsome way to start the show and a great showcase of what the Crusierweight can do when there given the time they need. 8/10

2520336,5,B000EHQ86O,"This is the way every single PPV should be. No fluff matches. No waste of time segments. I pay my $35, I want good solid wrestling from beginning to end. It is very rare that we get that but we got it here! This is an excellent show...probably Smackdown's best in a long while. Here's the card:

Crusierweight Championship Battle Royal:

Gregory Helms (Champ) vs. Brian Kendrick vs. Paul London vs. Pyscosis vs. Super Crazy vs. Funaki vs. Scottie 2 Hottie vs. Kid Kash vs. Nunzio:

Besides the fact that they had basically the exact same match at Royal Rumble 3 weeks earlier, this is a good high energy performance by the endangered species known as the cruiserweight division. High flying, none stop, spot-fest type of action as would be expected....not as good as Royal Rumble, but good way to open....7/10

JBL vs. Bobby Lashley

Is Lashley the next Brock Lesnar or what? Hopefully they use him right, he seems to be getting over. This was better than I expected. Both men came out of this looking good, especially JBL who basically got screwed at the Rumble by having to job to Boogeyman in under 2 min. Slow paced at first, with some good suplexes by Lashley and JBL as his usual hard-hitting style. Fit Finlay actually came out first carrying a diva on his shoulder, and Lashley made the save....7.5/10

Next, Batista came back out after having surgery and having to vacate the title. This was just a great little segment. Crowd went NUTS for him. I personally am not this guy's #1 fan (I prefer the more ""pure"" wrestlers Angle, Benoit, HBK, Orton, Rey, etc.) But this segment shows just how much Batista loves the fans and misses performing for them. His sincerity really showed through.

Matt Hardy & Tatanka vs. MNM

Yes, TATANKA was the ""mystery partner."" ...okay. It would've been off the chart if Jeff Hardy came back but oh well. This was probably the weakest match of the night, but MNM were able to make it as good as it could have been. And Melina was as hot as ever with the ""best entrance in the history of the game."" MNM is damned impressive and they basically ARE the tag team division right now. They remind me of a Edge/Christian of 2000 with the cocky ""cool guys"" gimmick. I hope they get a good match at Mania....7/10

United States Championship:

Booker T (Champ) vs. Chris Benoit

Wasn't their best match...they have wrestled each other WAY too much by now. But what can you say? Benoit..Booker = solid wrestling and good psychology. They're best was probably at Armageddon '05 which I saw LIVE! and some in WCW. Still, they mixed it up a little bit and made it entertaining. Surprisingly, the crowd wasn't really into it for most of the match. Don't know why....7.5/10

Rey Mysterio's Wrestlemania Title Shot on the Line:

Rey Mysterio vs. Randy Orton

Okay..yeah, I know. Everyone is offended about the Eddie storyline and all that. Well, Vince is a real class act...but didn't you know that by now?? I didn't care much about all that. Eddie's wife and Chavo were there, and they gave the OK for the storyline anyways. So, on to the match...the second best of the night. These two mesh real well together (Technical/grappling of Orton vs. High flying/Lucha of Rey rey) They had one of the best matches of the yr in '05 on Smackdown in my opinion. This could've been done a little better if Rey was given more time to fly around the ring as he does so well, but was still excellent. Some real clever moves such as Rey reversing an electric chair off the top rope into a powerbomb, Orton dropkicking Rey in mid air as Rey jumps off the rope, and swinging Rey into the ringpost like a baseball bat!! Ouch! The ending was a bit too sudden and unremarkable but still great stuff....8.5/10

World Heavyweight Title Match:

Kurt Angle (Champ) vs. The Undertaker

Angle guaranteed this would be MATCH OF THE YEAR and it's gonna be hard for anything to top it!! 30 min. of the best wrestling you're likely to see. These two had an instant classic on Smackdown in '03 which ended in DQ and was half the length of this one. This one had no interference of any kind. Just two of the best ever bringing out the best in eachother..what more can you ask for! The first 10-12 min. was methodical and psychologically sound with Taker working on Angle's arm and Angle doing damage to Taker's leg. Good submissions, including the old-school Bret Hart figure four around the ring post! Soon, these guys kicked it into another gear with an Angle Slam through the announce table and some brawling. Angle probably used the ankle lock 7 or 8 times in the match..he reversed the chockslam, last ride, and tombstone into ankle locks! Many near falls towards the end before a very well done pinfall finish. Great, great, great stuff!!....10/10

Overall, like I said, solid stuff from top to bottom..very rare for WWE or any company. BUY IT when it comes out! I know I am!!",1140393600,3,4874,4.595622119815668
2520337,4,B000EHQ86O,"No Way Out 2006 continued the rivalry of Chris Benoit and Booker T for the USA Title as both men showed another great technical battle, Randy Orton got the chance to main event his very first WM, and Kurt Angle and the Undertaker put on a great match that went back to their old WWE days.....

Crusierweight Championship
Gregory Helms [Champion] vs. Brian Kendrick vs. Paul London vs. The Mexicools vs. Funaki vs. Scottie Two Hottie vs. Kid Kash vs. Nunzio:
Don't blink, or you will miss something in this high flying match. I love it when the crusierweights get more than 5 minutes to show their high flying ability, and this is one of the best CW matches in quite some time. Highlights include Gregory Helms staying out of the way while the other CWs continued to pummel one another. Watch Psichosis dive over the tope ropes onto three or four guys in an exciting moment. Gregory Helms still kept the title after pinning Psichosis. 8/10

JBL vs. Bobby Lashley:
Strength and Power met Strength and power. Fit Finaly actually distracted Lashley in the beginning as JBL tried to gain the upper hand, but Lashley would fight back and give three Belly to Belley Overhead suplexes to JBL, even busting him open. Fit Finlay comes back into the ring and distracts Lashley again to allow JBL to hit the clothesline from hell for the win. 7/10

Open Challenge Match
MNM vs. Matt Hardy and Tatanka:
This was an okay match, but I hope Matt Hardy and Tatanka do not win the belts in the coming weeks. No offense to anyone, but MNM deserve to hold the belts untill they face a legit tag team like the Mexicools or London and Kendrick. The match was back and forth and Hardy and Tatanka win after a Samoan Drop and a Twist of Fate on Mercury get the pin. 8/10

USA Championship
Booker T [Champion] vs. Chris Benoit:
As much as I like seeing these two wrestle each other, I think it's time we saw others challenge for the title. The match was very back and forth and very hard hitting. Watch a huge superplex by Benoit onto Booker T in the middle of the match. Sharmell tries to distract the ref but Benoit knocks her off the apron and applies both the sharpshooter and the Crossface for Booker T to tap out. 8/10 [Good match but just like the previous ones.]

Winner Faces Champion at WM 22
Rey Mysterio vs. Randy Orton:
I don't see why after all the hype, plus the fact Rey now holds the record for in ring time in a RR back in January, Rey losses his chance to face the champion at WM. [There is a rumor that it will be a triple threat match] Anyway the match was very fast paced and the crowd was really into giving Randy a hard time. All through the match Randy worked on Rey's arm, including whacking it against steel steps, but Rey fought back and even cut Randy above the eye as he gave a big senton drop off the ropes onto Orton on the outside. The end comes when Rey misses a 619 and Randy scoops him up with the help of the ring ropes for the win. 8/10

World Heavyweight Championship
Kurt Angle [champion] vs. The Undertaker:
The last time we saw these two fight for a title was in September of 2003, but unfortunately Brock Lesnar beat up both men causing a DQ and ending the match. that was 2 and a half years ago and now these two fought once again, and this time there was no interference.

The match was long and very methodical. Both men used submission holds, the ankle lock and the triangle choke, and both men used a lot of brawling. Highlights include Angle and Taker being sent into steel steps and then Angle hitting the Angle Slam onto Taker through an announce table! Both men reverse submission holds until Angle rolls up Taker for the surprise pinfall, retaining his title. 9/10

I would reccomend this ppv for the Crusierweight championship, for the ending of the Benoit/Booker T match as the entire crowd chants, ""You Tapped Out!"" to Booker and the Rey/Orton match and the main event. Not a bad No Way Out. Not the best but definately worth checking out.....",1140393600,,3974,4.426812585499316

---My review is a bit outdated, because it was typed the night of PPV.  The only thing I've changed is my final comments at the end of the review.  Hope you like - Enjoy!

ORIGINAL REVIEW
The ""No Way Out"" PPVs are given the unenviable task of hyping of ""WrestleMania"", and often not given much of a chance to strut their stuff.  I can now say that this is the best ""No Way Out"" PPV since the spectacular 2001 edition.  But is that saying anything?

1) Cruiserweight Championship
Gregory Helms (champion) vs. Scotty 2 Hotty vs. Paul London
vs. Brian Kendrick vs. Super Crazy vs. Psicosis vs. Nunzio vs. Kid Kash vs. Funaki
---I was very surprised when I learned that this wasn't a Gauntlet match, where there would be one-on-one matches until the final fall declared the winner.  However, this is a match that continues the rejuvenation of the Cruiserweight divison.  Every wrestler gets enough spots and showcase time to prove their worth as a Cruiserweight champion.  Even wrestlers that I don't usually care for, like Nunzio or Scotty 2 Hotty, give good athletic performances in this crowd-pleasing opener.  Long two-counts, high-risk moves, energetic crowd...what more do we want in an opener?  It's not the best light-heavyweight action I've ever seen, but it's the best this year.
""7.5 out of 10""

2) Bobby Lashley vs. JBL
---Fit Finlay actually comes out first, brawling with Lashley.  When JBL finally enters, he puts on a decent performance as he tries to keep up with the dominant rookie.  Lashley has been on a roll since his debut, and his career looks brighter after this one.  There's nothing really ""must-see"" about this, but it's way better than I thought it would be.
""5.0 out of 10""

3) MNM (WWE Tag Team champions) vs. Matt Hardy & Tatanka
---Yes...sadly Jeff Hardy is not the mystery parnter...but Tatanka is a more-than-worthy secondary pick.  Every one of these guys gives a good show here.  Joey Mercury and Johnny Nitro are continuing to prove themselves as one of the best Tag Teams around today.  Tatanka is impressive, and can still keep up with the young guys.  Matt Hardy, as always, is a solid wrestler, and this match proves that Tatanka and he deserve the ""SmackDown"" spotlight.  I don't know why this wasn't for MNM's tag titles, but stay tuned, because MNM are about to face some serious contenders.
""8.0 out of 10""

4) U.S. Championship
Chris Benoit vs. Booker T (champion)
---Booker T and Sharmell almost pulled the jip of the decade when Booker first announced he was going to forfeit the title.  He had me convinced, but thankfully it was just a cheap ploy to sucker-punch the Rabid Wolverine...and off we go.  The positives pretty much speak for themselves, as Booker T and Benoit always know how to wrestle each other.  They have great in-ring psychology, and they show some neat counters to each other's holds.  But to be honest, there really wasn't much I haven't seen before.  If you've missed out on most of these two athletes' previous matches against each other (they've had TWO Best-of-Seven Series), then you'll like this one a lot.  For me, a longtime fan, this wasn't very original.  This match has ""final act"" written all over it, and I can't say I'm upset about that.  But I overstate the negatives too much; these two work hard and put on a good match.  What more do we need?
""7.0 out of 10""

5) Winner Goes To ""WrestleMania 22""
Randy Orton vs. Rey Mysterio
---First off, I was one of those fans who didn't care for the Eddie Guerrero backstory.  I loved Eddie as a wrestler, and admire the human being that everybody has claimed him to be.  But Orton is a gifted enough athlete who didn't need that kind of heat.  He's a cocky jackass who's got the moves to back it up.  Rey Mysterio didn't need the storyline either, because he's one of the best superstars in today's business.  But enough of the storyline, because the match is all that counts --- for me, it doesn't meet its potential.  Both men take some hard bumps and deliver some vicious strikes and maneuvers.  But those jaw-dropping spots happen too infrequently, as half of the match consists of Orton beating up Mysterio.  This match could've been a fast-paced, high-risk extravaganza...but instead it's too slow-paced (in a bad way).  I like how the match ends with a shocking conclusion, but while this isn't a bad contest, I won't watch it again.
""6.0 out of 10""

6) World Championship
Kurt Angle (champion) vs. The Undertaker
---Even though this rivalry came out of nowhere, it developed into a strong main event.  The Undertaker and Kurt Angle are both hard strikers, smart grapplers, agile, strong, and tough.  These two have matched up before, but this is their best match ever.  I have to admit that they play off the count-out rules a little too much, as often either wrestler keeps restarting the 10-count to prolong the match.  But Angle and Taker are always doing something new, so it's not unbearable.  In other words, when they restart those 10-counts, they don't just stomp away or punch, they lock on a new submission hold, or get countered by the opponent.  This match is not repetitive because Taker and Angle have a huge arsenal of maneuvers, and know how to use them.  The Undertaker's limit as a submission-resistant competitor is put to the ultimate test.  Angle's resiliancy is pushed harder than ever before, even when compared to Shawn Michaels or Big Show or Brock Lesnar, or anybody for that matter.  Will Taker tap?  Can Angle survive?  Even if you know the ending of this match, the closing minutes are breathtaking!  There's something --- that indescribable ""something"" --- missing to make it a classic.  But please, don't pass this match up!
""8.5 out of 10""

OVERALL
I liked this PPV a lot more than I thought I would.  It's a wrestling PPV, with very little time wasted on backstage segments or promos.  ""No Way Out 2006"" has 6 matches, each with enough time to tell its own story.  I ordered this on PPV, and it holds up incredibly well on DVD --- a rarity, for sure.  Sadly, I don't SmackDown had a very good showing at ""WrestleMania 22"".  After watching this event, you'd never guess that the Friday Night team were going to drop the ball.",1140307200,26,6197,4.698235840297122

8110082,4,B000EHQ86O,"This event continued the streak of successful PPVs from SmackDown as I have not actually enjoyed many of them in the past year but this one was clearly the best one to date as there was nothing horrible on this card with one classic match standing above the rest (and unless you have been living under a rock, you know what I am talking about).

Cruiserweight Champion Gregory Helms vs Kid Kash vs Psicosis vs Super Crazy vs Paul London vs Nunzio vs Brian Kendrick vs Scotty 2 Hotty vs Funaki. This was a great way to start the show as the cruiserweights always put on a show when given the chance & that was the case here as this was a great opener with non-stop action & everyone getting a chance to shine in this match with the story being Helms trying to be desperate to retain his title.

J.B.L. vs Lashley. This was one of both men's best performances in their careers as J.B.L. showed more effort here than I have previously seen from him while Lashley held his own here in what was a good clash with Finlay playing a factor in the end.

Right around here, Batista made his return to the ring to thank the fans & recieved a loud pop for his efforts.

M.N.M. vs Matt Hardy & Tatanka. Well unfortunately for die-hard fans, Jeff Hardy was not the mystery partner but this was actually a great tag team match as Tatanka didn't show any ring rust & held his own with the younger guys while we all know what Matt Hardy is capable of doing when he is given an opportuninty & the fact that M.N.M. were the best tag team in the WWE at the time.

United States Champion Booker T vs Chris Benoit. Before the match, there was a nice twist added to the match that actually added some more tension to the match. These two have never had a bad match but this was just the exact pattern that both men established in their previous matches with the difference being that Booker relied more on his heel tactics here while Benoit just would not be denied this time.

Winner Goes To WrestleMania: Rey Mysterio vs Randy Orton. First of all, the storyline leading into this match was tasteless since it revolved around the recently deceased Eddie Guerrero but past that, this match was mostly dominated by Orton with Rey getting some offense here in there before being cheated out of his title opportunity.

World Champion Kurt Angle vs The Undertaker. This match is worth the price of admission as we all know to expect a quality match between these two. Both men took a different approach than their previous encounter as they mat-wrestled with Angle targeting Taker's leg at various times that lead to some exciting sequences from both men countering their submission holds & even exchanges from both men's finisher holds. This was my favorite match of the year as Taker & Angle didn't disappoint in what was a classic encounter & probably their best match together.

DVD extras include an interview with Kurt Angle after the match along with the confrontation with Randy Orton & Booker T with his wife, Sharmell being scared by the Boogeyman.

Overall, this event is worth getting your hands on as again, there wasn't a bad match on the card while the main event is worth the price of the DVD alone.",1188950400,3,3188,4.492227979274611

Kid Kash vs Psicosis vs Super Crazy vs Paul London vs Nunzio vs Brian Kendrick vs Scotty 2 Hotty vs Funaki vs Gregory Helms:Since naming the opponents takes so much room, let me sum it up: Little Cruiserweights run around doing their neat flips for 25 minutes and then the match closes with it's painfully predictable ending. 6.5/10

Lashley vs JBL:This match could have been a great fight between 2 great superstars, but instead JBL cheats and wins. (Surprise!) 5/10

Matt Hardy and Tatanka vs Johnny Nitro and Joey Murcury:Better than you might expect. A good length and pace make this near PPV quality stuff. MH and TTK make a great team. 7/10

(United States Championship)
Chris Benoit vs Booker T:Anytime Chris Benoit steps into that ring, you know you've got one hell of a match. This is no exception. 8/10

(Wrestlemania Title Opportunity)
Rey Mysterio vs Randy Orton:This was simply a great match. Surprises were around every corner. That's what we've come to expect from little Rey. In the end, you think you've got it all figured out, and then.... 8.5/10

(World Heavyweight Championship)
Undertaker vs Kurt Angle:This match was long, a good 30 minutes. It got slow at points, but never failed to please. I loathed the ending, but even I can't deny the quality of the match put on by the 2 superstars. 9/10

Overall:The pacing could have used some work (the first 3 matches were really dull, and the final 3 were edge of your seat exciting) but still, this is a great PPV that would be a great addition to your collection. 8/10",1173398400,,1566,4.781481481481482
8110085,5,B000EHQ86O,"This PPV will change to be a joint PPV, as Smackdown are battling to have a good PPV by themselves.

I expect it to be something like No Way Out 2003, where there are some legends who come back.

Match 1 - Benoit vs Chavo Guerrero

 This should be a great match, something like survivor series 2006, I expect Chavo Guerrero to win, this will allow Benoit to have a title shot at wrestlemania 23 ( 8 - 12 min )

Match 2 -  Mickie James vs Maria

Just your average Women's match. Very short maybe 2min. Winner : Mickie James

Match 3 - Crusierweight Invitational

Again a very short match, I expect Gregory Helms to retain ( 4 min )

Match 4 - Undertaker vs Mr Kennedy ( No DQ )

Expect a good match, Mr Kennedy will win again. Expect there to be a lot of blood ( 15 min )

Match 5 - John Cena vs Umaga

Quite a short match, as Cena gets himself DQ because Umaga was kicking hi a**. ( 9min )

Match 6 - King Booker, Finaly, William Regal vs Batistia, The Hardy's

This will be simaler to No Way Out 2003 match. A good match winner Batistia, The hardy's ( 14min )

Match 7 - The Rock vs  Randy Orton

Probaly match of the night. The Rock will turn face again ( Winner : The Rock ) setting up a gimmick match for wrestlemania 23. ( 13 min )

Match 8 - New World Order vs DX & CM. Punk ( Elimination Match )

Match of the Night by far. Scott Hall gets eliminated first in a about 10 min, then CM. Punk and Kevin Nash go on for another 10 min, before both of them get eliminated by each other,( DQ elimianation ). Then it comes down to Hogan vs DX. Vince comes down to the ring a gives a chair to HHH. Who then hits Michaels and Hogan with it on purpose.. This turns HHH into a heel again and get DQ. Michaels will then get up first a sweet chin music Hogan, but he can only get the two count, then Hogan starts to Hulking up. I delivers shawn Michaels the leg drop, but Michaels still kicks out. Hogan does it three times in a row. And gets the win ( Winner : Sole Survivor : Hulk Hogan ( 31 min )

This will be the greatest No way Out ever.",1165017600,,2036,3.8932038834951457
8110086,5,B000EHQ86O,"This ppv was the best No way out since 2004. The matches I loved the most were

Chris Benoit vs. Booker

U.S Championship

5/5

Benoit wins back the title

Rey Mysterio vs. Randy Orton

(Winner to go to WM)

4/5

Great Match, Shocking End

Kurt Angle vs. Undertaker

World Heavyweight Championship

6/5

When I heard about this I thought Alot of sit ups and taker getting the win via tombstone. But Boy I was wrong. This is a great match. Lots of Back and forth action. Taker and angle are 2 of the businesses greats. Angle retains but it is a match of the year canidate.",1156377600,2,571,4.283018867924528
