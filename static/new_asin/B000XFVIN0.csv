3002321,5,B000XFVIN0,"""December Boys"" is a sweet, gentle tale set in Australia in the 1960's. Daniel Radcliffe, who stars as ""Maps,"" puts in a steller performance - his delighted and delightful grin when Lucy offers to teach him to kiss is one of the cutest and most true-to-life things I've seen in a film in a long, long time.  The other boys do a wonderful job as well.  It's a bit hard to understand their accents at times, but that isn't a serious problem (or wasn't for me).  The ending brought tears to my eyes.  A touching, lovely film, and a wonderful ""branching out"" role for Dan Radcliffe!",1200700800,,578,4.4245283018867925
3002322,5,B000XFVIN0,I just watched this movie and loved it. It is a really good story of friendship and love. If you like Harry Potter for the story of friendship and love then you will like this movie. All the acting is excellent. The cinematography is awesome. I just wish it was in HD. The scenery is amazing.,1198972800,4,292,4.232142857142857
3002323,4,B000XFVIN0,"Poorly promoted as ""Harry Potter's break out film"", December Boys  was a gorgeous film to watch, its story sad and compelling.  Anyone with an affection for the beauty that is Kangaroo Island will appreciate the stunning scenery in the film.  I have not read the book, and apparently the story in the film is a radical departure from its source literature.  The setting is the 1960s Oz Outback, an orphanage housing 4 boys ranging in age from 9-16, all of whom were born in the month of December (though they don't know their birth dates).  When a special donation is made to the orphanage, all 4 boys are taken on their first excursion to the sea, where the rumor awaits that one of them will be adopted by a family there.  Having been best friends all their lives, the boys spend the summer competing for the family's affection.  The obvious pressure of being scrutinized and inevitably separated so that one of them can gain a family is hard to watch.  The added experiences of the change in environment and meeting new people lightens the mood, though bring new hardships, as well.  The narrative is the memory of one of the younger boys, Misty.  I enjoyed the interjections of Misty's young lucid mind having shaped his interpretation of events without the adult clarity to fully process them.  Along that vein I loved how it wasn't always evident how Misty's imagination was interpreting events, as the film blurred odd surrealistic visuals.

All said this film was an excellent next move for an emerging child-to-adult actor. Radcliffe did well in it.  He does restrained emotion very well, which allows viewers to be involved in the story but keep an emotional detachment from its progress.  In that respect, the film isn't over dramatized. It accomplishes allowing viewers to identify with each of the boys without being sentimental, which I think shows the craft of the writing and direction more than any other facet of the film.  It's clearly a very sad and traumatic time, in the adult mind watching it.  But for the young ones living it it's just...  life, a time that when processed later as adults, they realized how pivotal it was.

I must say that I was not impressed with the portrayal of the femme fatale character in the film, who was the love interest of the eldest boy, Maps.  The story gave no indication for [i]why[/i] she behaved as she did.  I felt that part of the story needed to be told in order for me to have any sympathy for her.  There was an air of things not being quite right in her personal life, but without it being rooted more firmly and evidently into the main arc of Maps, she just came across two-dimensional.

No, it's not a blockbuster, and I see now why it was never promoted as such.  It is what it is--an indie film whose subtle artfulness would go the wayside for many mainstream audiences.  I was, however, struck by the fact that a lot of people who would otherwise find Radcliffe to be narrow in his skills will not see this film; thus, it will take him even longer to break out of that HP type to which the general public and industry holds him.",1198713600,21,3099,4.582577132486389
3002324,4,B000XFVIN0,"DECEMBER BOYS is a fine little Australian film based on the novel by Michael Noonan (to whom the film is dedicated), adapted for the screen by Marc Rosenberg, and directed by Rod Hardy, and while the story takes place in the 1960s, it remains warmly contemporary in its message. And for once it presents the good side of orphanages, rather than the Dickens view.

In the Australian outback there is an orphanage run by nuns, a spot in the dry country where the arid landscape flattens everything until an occasional storm provides temporary lakes for fishing and playing. Four young lads are bonded not only by the fact that they are orphans dues to various sad reasons, but they all have birthdays in December -  Maps (Daniel Radcliffe), Misty (Lee Cormie, Sparks (Christian Byers), and Spit (James Fraser. Fearing for retribution for their smoking and other mild infractions at the orphanage they are called into the headmaster's office where they discover that a benefactor has decided to give the orphan boys a holiday each year. The four lads are to spend time with a family at a tiny ocean cove setting. Delighted, they are off to meet their family - Bandy (Jack Thompson) and his wife Skipper (Kris McQuade) - who live in a small shack beside a few other neighbors. The world seems to have opened to the boys and each finds first time joy in living - fishing from neighbor Shellback's (Ralph Cotterill) old boat, riding a motorcycle with neighbor Fearless (Sullivan Stapleton), spying on the nude bathing wife of Fearless, Theresa (Victoria Hill), and finding first love with the young, seductive Lucy (Teresa Palmer). The boys are in heaven until Misty overhears Fearless and Theresa bemoaning their childless marriage and plan to adopt on of the boys. Challenges occur in physical, emotional, and spiritual ways: who will be the chosen 'son'? The manner in which the answer is decided opens a whole new meaning to the concept of family.

The cast is ingratiating and the settings and the music are lovely. The supporting cast of nuns and priest (Frank Gallacher, Judi Farr, Carmel Johnson) are particularly fine. The screenplay fails to fully investigate the motivations of all of the characters and there remain holes in the plot line that could have easily been remedied: symbolism in the form of a wild stallion, a huge fish named Henry, and surreal appearances of the Virgin Mary become a bit obscure. But despite these flaws (and an ending, or epilogue, that is pure corny Hollywood), DECEMBER BOYS is heartwarming and a fine movie for the entire family. Recommended.

I won't lie; I rented this movie solely because Daniel Radcliffe was in it and I wanted to see if he was any better in this than he was in Harry Potter (I'm a big HP fan, but not a big Radcliffe fan).

The answer was that Daniel Radcliffe's acting was still pretty awkward, but tolerable. The rest of the kids and adults were incredibly good actors, and I loved the story. I'd definitely recommend it.",1394236800,,550,4.382352941176471

3002370,2,B000XFVIN0,I enjoyed the movie all the way to the end. The ending was really inappropriate. The movie depicts boys who grow into men following the Catholic faith.

Four Catholic orphanage boys are chosen to go on ""holiday"" at hidden ocean cove. The true purpose is for a middle-aged couple to chose one of them to adopt, but the boys are bonded like real brothers. The oldest boy has his first sexual experience with a local girl.

3002375,4,B000XFVIN0,"Set about 1970 but seeming to be from a decade earlier, this film centers on Maps (Daniel Radcliffe of Harry Potter fame), the oldest of four orphan boys, and Misty (Lee Cormie), the narrator and smallest of the four.  All four born in December, they're the orphanage's December Boys.  Maps does most of the coming of age, with a summer romance, while all four learn about what family is for them.

There's a moral to this movie, but the main interest is in the engaging way the story is told.  It seems real, not too gauzy in its sentiment, with a share of hardness.  The only part that struck me as false, not because of how it turned out but because of how it was played, was the resolution of the family issue, which seemed a little forced and rushed.  The geographical setting is mostly an ocean cove, very scenic.  There's some nudity and sexuality, PG-13 stuff.

The extras are additional scenes.  They must have been cut for time, but they're good scenes.",1262822400,2,963,4.520231213872832

3002378,4,B000XFVIN0,"I picked up ""December Boys"" (2007) for two reasons: I like (non-raunchy) coming-of-age flicks and the fact that it takes place on the Southern coast of Australia (atually it was shot on Kangaroo Island, part of South Australia). As for Daniel Radcliffe, the star of the popular Harry Potter films, I've never seen him in a movie before and have no interest in him or Potter.

THE STORY: Four boys from an Outback Catholic orphanage get to celebrate their December birthdays by taking a Christmas holiday on the coast. They discover that a young childless couple are interested in adopting one of them, which creates a bit of rivalry, although the oldest one (Radcliffe) could care less and spends his time learning about girls and romance. Their time at the coast becomes a cornerstone experience as they ultimately discover what family means.

Unless you're Australian, I encourage you to utilize the English subtitles to understand the nigh-unintelligible Australian dialect. Otherwise you'll only comprehend about half the dialogue and the story will be lost to you. No kidding.

WHAT DOESN'T WORK: After seeing the film I only remember two of the boys -- Maps and Misty. The others might as well have been phantoms. The plot is interesting, but the story as-played-out is not very compelling (although the epilogue is slightly moving). Scenes come and go with largely ill-defined characters with little dialogue or explanation. This is definitely a picture where you'll have to read in between the lines to appreciate, which might make it good for repeat-viewings.

WHAT WORKS: The Kangaroo Island locations are fabulous, especially the high shots of Remarkable Rocks in Flinders Chase National Park.

The picture really comes alive when Teresa Palmer is on screen; she plays femme fatale Lucy. The DVD cover is deceiving in that Teresa looks to be about 12 years-old. Actually she was 20 during filming and plays an about-16 girl with curvy legs from here to New York. Lucy's scenes with Maps are the highlight of the picture (and not at all ""awkward"" as another reviewer contends). Lucy is aware of her tantalizing feminine powers and skillfully utilizes them to bewitch Maps with her spell.

In addition to the Remarkable Rocks and Lucy, other highlights include a secret cave high up on the rocks, a wild black horse who seems to fish, an Evel Knieval-type character who may not be as ""Fearless"" as he lets on, a colossal fish named Henry and the cantankerous old man fascinated by it.

The DVD feature about 10-minutes of deleted scenes that should have never been deleted. Make sure you catch 'em as they help explain the story better.

BOTTOM LINE: Although the story is merely okay as far as captivating and moving cinema goes, the highlights noted above compel me to give ""December Boys"" a decent rating, in particular the scenic rocks/coast and Lucy.

If you like Teresa Palmer in this picture be sure to check her out in ""Bedtime Stories"" (2008), ""Restraint"" (2008) and ""The Grudge 2"" (2006).

I wanted to like this movie, but it was a big let-down.  The entire thing feels like a movie trailer, random scenes fading in and out with minimal dialogue, leading nowhere.

He struggles through some young-boy-coming-of-age stuff that feels really awkward. The other boys don't fare any better; they're all blandly interchangeable and we never get a sense of the deep bond they're supposed to have.

3002384,4,B000XFVIN0,"The only reason I rented this movie was because Daniel Radcliffe [of Harry Potter fame] was in it, but there are other stand-out performances in this tender coming of age story about four orphans who over the course of a summer circa 1960s, discover what being a family truly means.

The four orphans are in an orphanage run by a band of Catholic nuns and have sort of resigned themselves to the fact that they may never be adopted due to their ages. One day, they are called in to the head's office, and think they are about to be punished for misbehaving, but it turns out that being ""December boys"", i.e. born in December, they are to receive a treat of spending a summer by the seaside, a dream come true for four sheltered Outback boys who have been bred on a steady diet of boiled lamb.

They are taken in by a kind couple and find themselves getting well-acquainted with the other inhabitants of the idyllic cove - in particular, the oldest boy Maps [Daniel Radcliffe] develops a crush on an older girl, Lucy [Teresa Palmer] who initiates his sexual awakening. The boys are also drawn to a young couple, a motorcycle stunt performer Fearless [Sullivan Stapleton] and his beautiful French wife, Teresa [Victoria Hill]. Soon, a rivalry develops between the boys when one of them, Misty [Lee Cormie] finds out that the couple is keen on adopting one of them.

The acting is above average for all the characters, in particular, Maps [Daniel Radcliffe] and Misty [Lee Cormie]. Both these characters are well-developed - Misty's intense yearning to finally be part of a real family, with a dad and mom comes across as genuine and heartrending in his portrayal. His deviousness is also credibly portrayed, as he tries to outshine his 'brothers' in appearing to be the best choice.

Maps is a well-drawn character - here is a young adolescent who always puts on a brave front, the leader of the band of brothers, the oldest of the pack, but who is also very vulnerable, especially when he suffers an unexpected 'loss' towards the latter part of the movie. His sexual awakening at the hands of the lustful Lucy is not overly sexed-up but subtly and beautifully done.

The soundtrack is simply beautiful with the songs staying with me long after the credits rolled. And the cinematography of the scenic South Australian seascape is just breathtaking. This may seem a tad sentimental to some, but it struck a chord within me and I highly recommend it.",1228694400,4,2447,4.694638694638694

December Boys was not the most sophisticated movie. It was actually very simple in most aspects, but that was all it needed to be. It was just a touching story about four boys who, when they had no one else, always had each other. But I will warn you that it might take one giant tug at your heartstrings at the end.

I hope you have one or more people in your life for which you are thankful. If you have that, this movie should remind you somewhat of how fortunate you are.

3002390,2,B000XFVIN0,"December Boys was only premiered in four theatres, one was in Boston where I viewed it with a very eager audience to see Daniel Radcliffe break out from the forever mold of being Harry Potter his whole life. Sadly, he fails in every attempt to try to bring some sort of professionalism to his career. Just because someone is plucked from obscurity, like Eddie Furlong, does not make them an actor. Even with the proper training, a person can still blow at the craft, and although Daniel does have some potential, as his timing is good and his voice is solid, he finds no solid ground amongst an ensemble of other youth, who far carry their roles and the movie much better than he did as the eldest 'December Boy.'

Based upon the crown jeweled-award winning Australian Novel by Mike Noonan of the same name (more or less the equivalent to our (U.S.) 'Catcher in the Rye'), the screenplay missed the wonderment of the novel that so many kids and adults fell in love with and the boys (Fido, Spark, Misty and Maps) who escaped their hell of catholic oprhanage waiting for parents to bring them a home.

While the cinematography is breathtaking, the movie fails to ignite a fire in wanting the boy to find a home. The movie had no wide release, and clearly it shouldn't have, and while Daniel tries to escape from the eventual end of his Potter life, one wonders where his next turn will be.

December Boys is a family film, which lacks conviction and detail to directing, not only does it have a mediocre DVD cover, but the potential of this being a film to cherish for the ages, left me wondering what it would have been like with a director who has visionary capabilities. What a shame.",1207440000,5,1686,4.521311475409836

They are known as ""December boys"" since all four of them celebrate their birthdays in the same month.  Due to unexpected generosity of one of the orphanage patrons, these boys get to spend a little vacation in the little cove away from their environment.  When one of the boys learns that there is a couple considering adopting one of the boys, the inevitable race and competition between the boys ensues.  What happens in the process is what defines the true friendship between these four boys.  The bond they make in the summer will remain for the rest of their lives in spite of the fact that they grow up and live all over the world.

3236820,4,B000XFVIN0,"Poorly promoted as ""Harry Potter's break out film"", December Boys  was a gorgeous film to watch, its story sad and compelling.  Anyone with an affection for the beauty that is Kangaroo Island will appreciate the stunning scenery in the film.  I have not read the book, and apparently the story in the film is a radical departure from its source literature.  The setting is the 1960s Oz Outback, an orphanage housing 4 boys ranging in age from 9-16, all of whom were born in the month of December (though they don't know their birth dates).  When a special donation is made to the orphanage, all 4 boys are taken on their first excursion to the sea, where the rumor awaits that one of them will be adopted by a family there.  Having been best friends all their lives, the boys spend the summer competing for the family's affection.  The obvious pressure of being scrutinized and inevitably separated so that one of them can gain a family is hard to watch.  The added experiences of the change in environment and meeting new people lightens the mood, though bring new hardships, as well.  The narrative is the memory of one of the younger boys, Misty.  I enjoyed the interjections of Misty's young lucid mind having shaped his interpretation of events without the adult clarity to fully process them.  Along that vein I loved how it wasn't always evident how Misty's imagination was interpreting events, as the film blurred odd surrealistic visuals.

All said this film was an excellent next move for an emerging child-to-adult actor. Radcliffe did well in it.  He does restrained emotion very well, which allows viewers to be involved in the story but keep an emotional detachment from its progress.  In that respect, the film isn't over dramatized. It accomplishes allowing viewers to identify with each of the boys without being sentimental, which I think shows the craft of the writing and direction more than any other facet of the film.  It's clearly a very sad and traumatic time, in the adult mind watching it.  But for the young ones living it it's just...  life, a time that when processed later as adults, they realized how pivotal it was.

I must say that I was not impressed with the portrayal of the femme fatale character in the film, who was the love interest of the eldest boy, Maps.  The story gave no indication for [i]why[/i] she behaved as she did.  I felt that part of the story needed to be told in order for me to have any sympathy for her.  There was an air of things not being quite right in her personal life, but without it being rooted more firmly and evidently into the main arc of Maps, she just came across two-dimensional.

No, it's not a blockbuster, and I see now why it was never promoted as such.  It is what it is--an indie film whose subtle artfulness would go the wayside for many mainstream audiences.  I was, however, struck by the fact that a lot of people who would otherwise find Radcliffe to be narrow in his skills will not see this film; thus, it will take him even longer to break out of that HP type to which the general public and industry holds him.",1198713600,21,3099,4.582577132486389
3236821,4,B000XFVIN0,"DECEMBER BOYS is a fine little Australian film based on the novel by Michael Noonan (to whom the film is dedicated), adapted for the screen by Marc Rosenberg, and directed by Rod Hardy, and while the story takes place in the 1960s, it remains warmly contemporary in its message. And for once it presents the good side of orphanages, rather than the Dickens view.

In the Australian outback there is an orphanage run by nuns, a spot in the dry country where the arid landscape flattens everything until an occasional storm provides temporary lakes for fishing and playing. Four young lads are bonded not only by the fact that they are orphans dues to various sad reasons, but they all have birthdays in December -  Maps (Daniel Radcliffe), Misty (Lee Cormie, Sparks (Christian Byers), and Spit (James Fraser. Fearing for retribution for their smoking and other mild infractions at the orphanage they are called into the headmaster's office where they discover that a benefactor has decided to give the orphan boys a holiday each year. The four lads are to spend time with a family at a tiny ocean cove setting. Delighted, they are off to meet their family - Bandy (Jack Thompson) and his wife Skipper (Kris McQuade) - who live in a small shack beside a few other neighbors. The world seems to have opened to the boys and each finds first time joy in living - fishing from neighbor Shellback's (Ralph Cotterill) old boat, riding a motorcycle with neighbor Fearless (Sullivan Stapleton), spying on the nude bathing wife of Fearless, Theresa (Victoria Hill), and finding first love with the young, seductive Lucy (Teresa Palmer). The boys are in heaven until Misty overhears Fearless and Theresa bemoaning their childless marriage and plan to adopt on of the boys. Challenges occur in physical, emotional, and spiritual ways: who will be the chosen 'son'? The manner in which the answer is decided opens a whole new meaning to the concept of family.

The cast is ingratiating and the settings and the music are lovely. The supporting cast of nuns and priest (Frank Gallacher, Judi Farr, Carmel Johnson) are particularly fine. The screenplay fails to fully investigate the motivations of all of the characters and there remain holes in the plot line that could have easily been remedied: symbolism in the form of a wild stallion, a huge fish named Henry, and surreal appearances of the Virgin Mary become a bit obscure. But despite these flaws (and an ending, or epilogue, that is pure corny Hollywood), DECEMBER BOYS is heartwarming and a fine movie for the entire family. Recommended.

There's a moral to this movie, but the main interest is in the engaging way the story is told.  It seems real, not too gauzy in its sentiment, with a share of hardness.  The only part that struck me as false, not because of how it turned out but because of how it was played, was the resolution of the family issue, which seemed a little forced and rushed.

3236875,4,B000XFVIN0,"I picked up ""December Boys"" (2007) for two reasons: I like (non-raunchy) coming-of-age flicks and the fact that it takes place on the Southern coast of Australia (atually it was shot on Kangaroo Island, part of South Australia). As for Daniel Radcliffe, the star of the popular Harry Potter films, I've never seen him in a movie before and have no interest in him or Potter.

THE STORY: Four boys from an Outback Catholic orphanage get to celebrate their December birthdays by taking a Christmas holiday on the coast. They discover that a young childless couple are interested in adopting one of them, which creates a bit of rivalry, although the oldest one (Radcliffe) could care less and spends his time learning about girls and romance. Their time at the coast becomes a cornerstone experience as they ultimately discover what family means.

Unless you're Australian, I encourage you to utilize the English subtitles to understand the nigh-unintelligible Australian dialect. Otherwise you'll only comprehend about half the dialogue and the story will be lost to you. No kidding.

WHAT DOESN'T WORK: After seeing the film I only remember two of the boys -- Maps and Misty. The others might as well have been phantoms. The plot is interesting, but the story as-played-out is not very compelling (although the epilogue is slightly moving). Scenes come and go with largely ill-defined characters with little dialogue or explanation. This is definitely a picture where you'll have to read in between the lines to appreciate, which might make it good for repeat-viewings.

WHAT WORKS: The Kangaroo Island locations are fabulous, especially the high shots of Remarkable Rocks in Flinders Chase National Park.

The picture really comes alive when Teresa Palmer is on screen; she plays femme fatale Lucy. The DVD cover is deceiving in that Teresa looks to be about 12 years-old. Actually she was 20 during filming and plays an about-16 girl with curvy legs from here to New York. Lucy's scenes with Maps are the highlight of the picture (and not at all ""awkward"" as another reviewer contends). Lucy is aware of her tantalizing feminine powers and skillfully utilizes them to bewitch Maps with her spell.

In addition to the Remarkable Rocks and Lucy, other highlights include a secret cave high up on the rocks, a wild black horse who seems to fish, an Evel Knieval-type character who may not be as ""Fearless"" as he lets on, a colossal fish named Henry and the cantankerous old man fascinated by it.

The DVD feature about 10-minutes of deleted scenes that should have never been deleted. Make sure you catch 'em as they help explain the story better.

BOTTOM LINE: Although the story is merely okay as far as captivating and moving cinema goes, the highlights noted above compel me to give ""December Boys"" a decent rating, in particular the scenic rocks/coast and Lucy.

If you like Teresa Palmer in this picture be sure to check her out in ""Bedtime Stories"" (2008), ""Restraint"" (2008) and ""The Grudge 2"" (2006).

3236881,4,B000XFVIN0,"The only reason I rented this movie was because Daniel Radcliffe [of Harry Potter fame] was in it, but there are other stand-out performances in this tender coming of age story about four orphans who over the course of a summer circa 1960s, discover what being a family truly means.

The four orphans are in an orphanage run by a band of Catholic nuns and have sort of resigned themselves to the fact that they may never be adopted due to their ages. One day, they are called in to the head's office, and think they are about to be punished for misbehaving, but it turns out that being ""December boys"", i.e. born in December, they are to receive a treat of spending a summer by the seaside, a dream come true for four sheltered Outback boys who have been bred on a steady diet of boiled lamb.

They are taken in by a kind couple and find themselves getting well-acquainted with the other inhabitants of the idyllic cove - in particular, the oldest boy Maps [Daniel Radcliffe] develops a crush on an older girl, Lucy [Teresa Palmer] who initiates his sexual awakening. The boys are also drawn to a young couple, a motorcycle stunt performer Fearless [Sullivan Stapleton] and his beautiful French wife, Teresa [Victoria Hill]. Soon, a rivalry develops between the boys when one of them, Misty [Lee Cormie] finds out that the couple is keen on adopting one of them.

The acting is above average for all the characters, in particular, Maps [Daniel Radcliffe] and Misty [Lee Cormie]. Both these characters are well-developed - Misty's intense yearning to finally be part of a real family, with a dad and mom comes across as genuine and heartrending in his portrayal. His deviousness is also credibly portrayed, as he tries to outshine his 'brothers' in appearing to be the best choice.

Maps is a well-drawn character - here is a young adolescent who always puts on a brave front, the leader of the band of brothers, the oldest of the pack, but who is also very vulnerable, especially when he suffers an unexpected 'loss' towards the latter part of the movie. His sexual awakening at the hands of the lustful Lucy is not overly sexed-up but subtly and beautifully done.

The soundtrack is simply beautiful with the songs staying with me long after the credits rolled. And the cinematography of the scenic South Australian seascape is just breathtaking. This may seem a tad sentimental to some, but it struck a chord within me and I highly recommend it.",1228694400,4,2447,4.694638694638694

3236883,3,B000XFVIN0,"Being a Daniel Radcliffe fan, I waited months for this movie to finally be available for purchase on DVD.  While it is a cute film, I was disappointed.  Maybe my expectations were too high, but it wasn't anything spectacular and I didn't enjoy the ending.  It is worth watching, but unless you are a Dan Rad fan, I would say just rent the movie.",1219104000,3,345,4.359375

3236886,4,B000XFVIN0,"An older couple decides that it would be nice to have some youthful energy around and offers four young, orphan boys the opportunity to spend the summer with them on the beach. As the boys get a taste for what life would be like with the family they have always wanted, they begin to understand how much they mean to each other.

December Boys was not the most sophisticated movie. It was actually very simple in most aspects, but that was all it needed to be. It was just a touching story about four boys who, when they had no one else, always had each other. But I will warn you that it might take one giant tug at your heartstrings at the end.

I hope you have one or more people in your life for which you are thankful. If you have that, this movie should remind you somewhat of how fortunate you are. I thought it was comforting in how the movie reinforced the importance of family while encouraging you to look beyond constraints of legal relation when you consider who your family is.",1207699200,6,991,4.32258064516129
3236887,2,B000XFVIN0,"December Boys was only premiered in four theatres, one was in Boston where I viewed it with a very eager audience to see Daniel Radcliffe break out from the forever mold of being Harry Potter his whole life. Sadly, he fails in every attempt to try to bring some sort of professionalism to his career. Just because someone is plucked from obscurity, like Eddie Furlong, does not make them an actor. Even with the proper training, a person can still blow at the craft, and although Daniel does have some potential, as his timing is good and his voice is solid, he finds no solid ground amongst an ensemble of other youth, who far carry their roles and the movie much better than he did as the eldest 'December Boy.'

Based upon the crown jeweled-award winning Australian Novel by Mike Noonan of the same name (more or less the equivalent to our (U.S.) 'Catcher in the Rye'), the screenplay missed the wonderment of the novel that so many kids and adults fell in love with and the boys (Fido, Spark, Misty and Maps) who escaped their hell of catholic oprhanage waiting for parents to bring them a home.

While the cinematography is breathtaking, the movie fails to ignite a fire in wanting the boy to find a home. The movie had no wide release, and clearly it shouldn't have, and while Daniel tries to escape from the eventual end of his Potter life, one wonders where his next turn will be.

December Boys is a family film, which lacks conviction and detail to directing, not only does it have a mediocre DVD cover, but the potential of this being a film to cherish for the ages, left me wondering what it would have been like with a director who has visionary capabilities. What a shame.",1207440000,5,1686,4.521311475409836
3236888,3,B000XFVIN0,"Cute little movie setup in Australia about four boys growing up in orphanage in Australia's outback.  They are known as ""December boys"" since all four of them celebrate their birthdays in the same month.  Due to unexpected generosity of one of the orphanage patrons, these boys get to spend a little vacation in the little cove away from their environment.  When one of the boys learns that there is a couple considering adopting one of the boys, the inevitable race and competition between the boys ensues.  What happens in the process is what defines the true friendship between these four boys.  The bond they make in the summer will remain for the rest of their lives in spite of the fact that they grow up and live all over the world.
While the story is heartwarming, the references to Virgin Mary, etc. are a little too much.  That is why I gave this film only three starts.",1206489600,11,880,4.573248407643312
3236889,5,B000XFVIN0,"This is a great film, and I think I will like it even more once I read the book. I agree with another viewer, that I think some of the characters need more explanation to understand them.

Daniel Radcliffe shines as Maps, the eldest orphan of the four boys. He brings both powerful emotion, and heartwarming scenes to the movie.",1206316800,13,328,4.466666666666667
3236890,5,B000XFVIN0,"This lovely film was so undeserving of the low ratings it received.  The cinematography was stunning, the story heart-warming and beautifully acted by the four young actors.  Harry Potter made Daniel Radcliffe a star, this movie made him an actor.  It was a brave choice to follow up HP with this ""little"" film but he should be extremely proud of it, as should all involved.  The end was unexpected and left a huge lump in my throat.  This movie no doubt will end up in my collection to be savoured over and over, I loved it.  Highly recommend it.",1204934400,4,547,4.474747474747475
3236891,5,B000XFVIN0,"I watched this mainly because I was curious how Daniel Radcliffe's acting fares in a non-Harry Potter movie. For his fans, be assured that Radcliffe acquitted himself very well: his performance was appropriately calibrated to the character, subtle and effective. But I grew to love ""December Boys"" as I watched. It is a wonderful respite from the special-effects laden products churned out by Hollywood today. The story is interesting: how 4 orphan boys spent a ""summer"" in the 1960s by the sea, far from the desolate dry outback of their orphanage; the characters they met; the boys' competition to be chosen for adoption by a young couple; triumphs and disappointments; a near drowning; and a life-changing decision. Everything was done well--the beautiful cove setting, the writing & directing, the acting, and musical score. The movie ends with a flash forward half-a-century to our present day, which is unexpected and very moving. This is one of those movies that stay with you. I love it.",1203811200,3,995,5.073170731707317
3236892,5,B000XFVIN0,"I thought ""December Boys"" was a very sweet and charming film. It showed how the four main characters handled being orphans and how they bonded and became more than just best friends.",1203292800,,182,4.71875
3236893,2,B000XFVIN0,"The movie bombed in the USA, grossing only $50,715 according to Box Office Mojo. It has a number of problems. The writing is not very good, it consists of haphazard episodes none of which lead much of anywhere, and the direction also could be better. The main problem in my view is that the speech is largely unintelligible to Americans. It could just as well be in Japanese or Chinese. The movie needs subtitles to understand what the actors are saying. Only about 30% is clear. That would explain why it never appeared in more than 13 theaters nationwide.",1203033600,7,557,4.636363636363637

8228190,4,B000XFVIN0,"Decent movie,
probably better as a one time rental than to buy it.
(I paid $14.95 for the DVD, it's since dropped to $10.95)

The part of ""Lucy"" is played by the Teresa Palmer, who also played the part of Doss' wife in Hacksaw Ridge.

Of course Daniel Radcliffe was Harry Potter & Swiss Army Man (lol!)

PG-13 rating is for a couple thinly veiled breasts,
and one intimate scene that is somewhat graphic (2nd base without nudity)

Overall I enjoyed this movie,
it had the feel of a much older film
if not for Radcliffe, I might have thought it was filmed in the 70's or 80's.

The movie itself doesn't jam the subject matter down your throat,
but it does take a look at the life of orphan kids.

The beautiful shoreline of Australia makes a fantastic backdrop to this movie,
the scenery alone is a reason to watch.

Acting was decent, characters fairly well built up, and their interactions were interesting.

Probably a 3.5-4 star movie,
 I don't know if I'll end up watching it a second time,
but I might.

Worth the time and a few bucks for a rental",1496707200,,1052,4.376288659793815

The story revolves around four orphans who cement their bond as a family while on an extended summer holiday (and since this is Australia, it occurs in December). What can you say about the boy who will always bring Harry Potter to mind? Daniel Radcliffe plays his role to perfection as the leader of the pack who experiences his coming of age summer against the background of Kangaroo Island off the coast of South Australia. The boys romp through spectacular scenery as they wrestle with their desire for parents against the growing bond of their relationships with each other.
