8015021,4,B0001N57QI,"I was intrigued by this video when I was browsing one of my favorite actor's (Josh Lucas) filmography.  I finally tracked a copy down through Amazon's used videos, and ordered it.  I was actually quite surprised; some other reviews I read said the movie was moronic and cheaply made.  I wouldn't go so far as to agree with the first statement, but it was done on the cheap using a 16mm camera and the actors forgoing their usual pay. Suffice to say, I ordered a copy (available only on VHS from what I can gather, and formerly available only through the filmmakers now-defunct website -- if there's a DVD version out there I haven't tracked it down).

To me this is the spirit of independent filmmaking.  The plot, such as it is, involves the misadventures of Eric Traber (Josh Lucas), a 25-year old recent college graduate who gets fired from his first job by his tyrannical boss (Bob Balaban).  He then gets kicked out of the apartment he's been living in with a stoner friend and the friend's shrewish girlfriend.  Enter Ziggy (Jeff Buehl), his old school and lifetime friend, who has quit the Peace Corps under dubious circumstances.  Ziggy convinces Eric to indulge in a scheme to buy back his late father's Long Island beach residence, which his stepmother has put up for sale.  To do this, they must raise a million dollars to buy the house.  Ziggy's inheritance is apparently solid, but not solvent so he can't just buy the house outright.  Over the course of Easter weekend, they drive out the house; break in and stay there illegally much to the consternation of the local realtor (Teri Garr in an understated performance) who's having an affair,it turns out, with his old boss who is buying the house before it comes on market (apparently illegal in its own right).  While Ziggy tries to con his old friends and acquaintances out of their family inheritances to loan him the money, Eric becomes involved with an older woman (Claudia Rocafort), who seduces him and turns out to be in one of the funniest moments, his old boss's wife.  He shows up Easter sunday to his former boss's dismay and the wife's delight. Eric then makes the mistake of telling the wife her husband is having an affair with the realtor from whom he's buying Ziggy's father's house.  She confronts her husband who eagerly admits to the affair and offers a no-contest divorce on the spot, with the new house thrown in as a bargain.  She of course wants their current house, and decides to kill the husband and frame Eric in the process.  She spikes his drink with some kinds of powder (from the looks of it and the result, sleeping pills) and invites Eric over while the husband falls asleep in the hot tub. She thinks he has gone off to bed to die.  She steals Eric's wallet to frame him for the murder while they're kissing and tells himto join her in the hot tub.  The next hilarious scene ensues as Eric does a strip-tease for her and then discovers his boss's body in the jacuzzi.  Ziggy shows up as Eric is reviving his boss with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation while only wearing his boxers.  By the end, all is set straight and Eric and Ziggy return to the city to start a new lease on life.

I have never seen Josh Lucas do physical comedy to this degree (not even some of the facial contortions he did in Sweet Home Alabama compare).  Granted, this is way before he became a fairly big-name star and you can tell he's younger and a bit green here and there.  However, his attempts to get in bed with Claudia Rocafort are genuinely funny, including a scene where he follows her to the beach and then pretends he's a boxer by jogging up to her and doing boxing jabs, all the while wearing khaki Dockers.  He also has a Steve Martin/Peter Sellers moment where he (successfully) performs a self-Heimlich maneuver after choking on a brownie.  Of course, the final scene in the hot tub is a hoot.  Bob Balaban is drily funny, when he's not berating and verbally abusing Josh; the Easter Sunday dinner scene is so understated that you almost expect a blowup.  Roy Scheider has a cameo as Ziggy's rich uncle who tells him it's time to grow up. And so on.  If you find a copy of this, buy it or rent it.  Granted I only spent $5.00 total with shipping and handling but it was a $5.00 well spent.  Of course, unless Josh Lucas breaks out as a major star in the next couple years, I don't see this getting released on DVD.  In fact, that would probably be against the filmmakers wishes.",1122768000,3,4464,4.521793275217933
