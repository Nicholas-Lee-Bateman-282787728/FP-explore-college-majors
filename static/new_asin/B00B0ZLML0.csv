The positives of this episode.

1. The artwork is actually great, and the animation does measure up to the time it took to make this episode.
2. The Story is a perfect development of the characters before the final episode next year. The story for those who have not read the manga is nothing I am going to spoil but we finally get Full Frontal's plan in this whole thing. Along with some big developments for not just Full Frontal but Mineva, and the other characters. Again one thing later.
3. The Combat when it is present is very crisp and actually quite well done, but more on this later.
4. The Music is also well done as always and there is not much difference from the previous entries.

Negatives.

1. There is a lot of conversation in this episode and some will find it lacking for all the time they waited for it. While I would say differently because of this overall story and the length of the OVA I say this story needs it. Not the episode 4 MS combat porn we got.
2. Now some characters get the short end of the stick. Notably Riddhe as he seems way too emo this episode.
3. The Tristars got the short end of the stick too but they did have a good scene.
4. Whiners that complain about their crazy expectations for this episode. Let me explain reasonably.

1. 2 episodes left before this one was released. You had to expect this story filled episode. You had to know they had to advance it to make up for the one crap episode they had. Now the little longer run time was a god send and for those all for crap blowing up wait til the 70 minute finale.
2. There has to be some development for the villain and the others as there was a lot that happened in the last episode as well as burgeoning relationships. Each installment is a piece of the story and not really the same as the rest.

The episode while slow at times, it moves the story along, and gives the tension needed for the story and for us.",1365465600,,1942,4.235135135135135
8560445,2,B00B0ZLML0,"I've been waiting months for the release of episode 6 and was very excited when it arrived last night. The first thing I noticed was the artwork was not up to par with the rest of the series. Not much happened action wise and you could tell that they were just trying to drag out the series for another installment. The most action came from a review of the last episode battle. With a lot of extra dialogue and the art being markedly down I was really disappointed. You expect a lot more for the cost. I'm still taken back for spending over 50$ for one episode but I'm a big fan of Gundam UC. When you take in account that full seasons on bluray of the Clone War, Transformers Prime, and other Japanese anime series are a lot less and you get so much more in terms of art, CGI and multiple episodes...One episode of Unicorn Gundam is...well...a rip off.  I'm a fan growing up with Gundam so I foolishly spend the money but for the fans sake I hope they really give us a glorified ending, with better art work, action, run time and a lower price for the last episode 7.",1364515200,,1069,4.240196078431373
