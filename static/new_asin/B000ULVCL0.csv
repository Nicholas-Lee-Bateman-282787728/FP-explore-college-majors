8213762,2,B000ULVCL0,"I don't know if the DVD is the same as the CD set I bought some years ago, but the audio quality is terrible.  Dr. Wolf obviously recorded it on a home recorder and then the tape was transferred to CD, but only one channel.  I don't recall now if it was the Right or Left, channel, but there was no stereo, or dual-channel recording.  The mic Dr. Wolf used was cheap.  So there is just poor audio fidelity all around.

I re-mastered the original CDs and was able to get a two-channel recording.  It's not perfect, but it is better than the original.

Dr. Wolf gives two 30-minute meditations.  They are quite good and use standard hypnosis techniques, even though it's obvious he is making it up as he goes along.  Still, he's bright and it works.  He says a couple of things that are fascinating.  First, that the human brain has the ability to amplify itself, via suggestion.  I never considered this, but apparently it's true.  Once amplified, Dr. Wolf suggests that now, with a more powerful brain, one can send out signals to alien beings and contact them.  Does it work?  I haven't seen any aliens, but maybe I will one day.

It is also interesting that The Gateway Treament shares a similar name with The Gateway Voyage, a program at The Monroe Institute in Virginia.  Both Gateways emphasize that humans are quite capable of expanding their faculties and horizons with the use of the repective products.

Wolf was fascinating.  Pity he died before good recordings could be made.",1307836800,4,1486,4.603053435114504
8213763,2,B000ULVCL0,"This was a poorly made DVD. The first section is a series of radio interviews with various hosts. The info is in tune with M. Wolf's book, The Catcher's of Heaven. Sometimes it is thought provoking, often it is just annoying. I have no idea if aliens are visiting here or not and this did not help in either direction. It's the usual 'we're so in the know and cool' ufo geek stuff. I so want to sit ufo sorts down and ask them to spill something surprising and truly alien. Put up or shut up. Stand and deliver, as the old highwaymen used to declare :-) No deliveries here. The so called Gateway Treatment is a very long do it yourself hypnotic blather that goes on and on and on and shows no intelligence whatsoever. If this man has been hanging out with ET for years... shouldn't something interesting or even... alien... sneak into his chatter now and then? hm. It doesn't. Ergo... caveat emptor. Still, if you have his book and want to hear him talk, the better to get a read on the guy, then get this, or better, his other DVD, Cosmic Secrets. There are no Cosmic Secrets in either DVD, but you can listen to him and decide what your measure of the guy is. At least on the other one you can see him and study his body language etc. Not so on this one. It is voice only, over lame slides",1230249600,6,1291,4.209677419354839
8213764,1,B000ULVCL0,"I can't bring myself to put any kind of title before this guy's name so I will refer to him as Wolfy.

I've wanted to believe in aliens for many years.  Woolfy is the first person who makes me doubt their existence.  He makes me think they are just a way for wackos like himself to make money selling books and lecturing.  And if he's not making money, perhaps he's doing it for the popularity.  I dunno.

The cover of the DVD is an accurate depiction of it's contents.  It is merely a piece of paper printed on by an inkjet printer with very poor graphics.  It also contains grammar errors.  Opening the DVD case reveals two DVDs, again amateurishly printed, without even the attempt to paste  amateurish graphics (we've already bought the DVD - no more need to impress).  One DVD had the unimpressive title of ""FREE Bonus DVD - Paranormal Experiences""

One of the many claims on the front of the DVD is ""Wolfy was an advisor to presidents.""  The only president I can imagine would seek this guy's advice would be perhaps the president of the Guinness Book of World Records attempting to fill the category for worst DVD ever produced.  And indeed, I could never imagine anything so poor could end up on a DVD for sale anywhere.

This DVD is not a movie, so it could have been sold as a CD, and should have.  It contains only poor quality radio interview segments, extremely cheesy intro ""music"" and a slide show of poor quality pictures.  One thing I have found about wackos is that they know how to surf the Internet and download pictures and they also must think that we can't.  This DVD barely plays.  Windows Media Player won't touch it.  Nero 7 will touch it, but not for long.  I got it to run for 87 minutes before it finally quit (after excessive dropouts and weird groanings from my DVD player).  And they were 87 agonizing, painful minutes of tedious stupidity.  I had to take it in doses because there was no way my psyche could survive the 87 minutes continuously.  Each time I had to fast-forward to where I left off because there is no menu (until I figured out there are undocumented chapters).  The only reason I continued listening is to perhaps hear something of this mystical ""Gateway Treatment"" which is why I bought the DVD which was recommended by someone whom I used to think was reputable.  Of course, the DVD died before I ever got there, and there was little mention of it.

The first interviewer did not stay in synch with Wolfy, or Wolfy didn't stay in synch with him.  They often ignored each other.  Sadly, this made an already bad situation worse.

Here are a few ""profound"" gems straight from Wolfy's mouth:
...I was a laboratory hanger outer...
...there isn't enough time in the world...
...I'm writing a trilogy of 4 books...
...this is the tip of a very big iceberg, symbolically speaking...
...I've been working to suppress my ego for a long time...
...I visually saw him...

The DVD mostly consists of Wolfy's aimless ramblings.  At one point (around 69 minutes) he confused himself with some of his titles...not sure if he's a neurologist, pathologist, or both.  He also mentions his books a lot (the trilogy).  I immediately looked up the reviews of ""The Catchers of Heaven"" which contained phrases like ""incomprehensible gibberish.""  In that respect, this DVD matches his books, and I couldn't have said it better.

I actually kind of glad it would not play.  I would have ended up listening to all 200 minutes of this !@#$%.  Fortunately, Amazon is allowing me to return (GO AMAZON!!!  YEAH!!!).  So I only lost my valuable time.  But, if I sacrificed my time and saved some of yours, it was worth it.

Also, Amazon, please give us the power to assign zero stars.  Here is an excellent case where that capability would have been valuable.",1191715200,13,3780,4.5874439461883405
