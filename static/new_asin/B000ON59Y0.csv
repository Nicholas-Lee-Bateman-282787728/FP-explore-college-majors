8185710,1,B000ON59Y0,"To start with, the viewer is told that they are seeing this video as the clips were seen originally on television. If true, the tracking, contrast, sound and picture would have turned millions of fans away from watching, and instead, would have turned their radios on to listen to their favorite teams. There are some noticeable errors, like when Bobby Thomson hit his famous 1951, playoff game#3 homerun, the first time it was shown, the narrator said he hit it during the 1952 season, and they showed this clip, corrected, 2 more times. Also, they called Roy Campanella, who played catcher, a 'power pitcher'. When Willie Mays' clips were shown, offensively, they showed him hitting 3 homeruns vs. the Milwaukee Braves(in actuality, it occured on April 30, 1961);There are some other voice-over errors, included.
  There was no original audio broadcasts over the dramatic moments shown, just a lot of musac, and the drone of the narrator. This tape is 38 minutes long, copied at EP speed, and I have watched other tapes copied at the same 'slow' speed, but they sure looked and sounded tons better.
  The end result is a total waste of any purchaser's money, and a big dissapointment to watch.",1292889600,,1195,4.87192118226601
