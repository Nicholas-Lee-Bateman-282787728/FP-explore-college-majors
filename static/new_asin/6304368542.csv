851310,5,6304368542,"TRIVIA & BEHIND THE SCENES: Tom Tryon was selected for the lead role right after he had completed a western television series for Disney known as ""Texas John Slaughter"".  The film is directed by James Nielson, the first of many movies he helmed for the Disney Studio after directing 2 episodes of Zorro. His movies for Disney included Bon Voyage, The Moon-Spinners, Summer Magic, The Adventures of Bullwhip Griffin.. The 3 songs in the movie were composed by those Disney wonders, the Sherman Brothers . Dany Saval as the female lead Lyrae, Saval was an actress from France. Disney regulars Tommy Kirk, Brian Keith and Edmond O'Brien turn in great performances. Screenplay by Maurice Tombragel, based upon an original story by Robert Bruckner from his novel ""Starfire"".  Disney's first feature film about outer space, it features some nice special effects and gadgets. The FBI filed a complaint to Disney about their portrayal in the film.  Disney hoped for some future success for the their female lead, and had her sing a song from the movie on the next Annette Funicello record.  Running time 98 minutes. Premiered  on February 9, 1962, general release on April 5, 1962.  It later aired on the weekly Disney television show on NBC's  ""Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color"", on January 16 & 23, 1966. It  then re-aired on February 21 & 28, 1971 with the show's new NBC title ""Wonderful World of Disney"". First released on VHS in 1986. Disney also produced an episode for their television show that was a behind the scenes peek at the making of the movie, titled ""Spy in the Sky"".

PLOT:  A space scientist is assigned, reluctantly, to an important space mission, but a mysterious young woman keeps appearing everywhere he goes trying to give him a message. Even more unusual, she seems to know all the top secret details of his upcoming mission. He finally reports her appearances to the authorities, and while they are looking for her, HE disappears.  So who is this girl, is she a Russian spy?  The Air Force, and FBI clash as they try to figure out what is going on, and the blame game begins. Much of the films jokes come from poking fun at our government institutions, all shown as bumbling fools. No one escapes the skewering which includes the Air Force, FBI, Secret Service, Senators, and other agencies.",1263945600,24,2316,4.791457286432161
851311,5,6304368542,Great movie it's a good old Disney great. Glad I found it for my collection. If you are a Disney fan it is a must. This movie brought back the time when I was a kid and seen it at the theater. Gee I wish they made more movies like this. Again get and enjoy with the whole family.,1252454400,12,279,3.7457627118644066
851312,4,6304368542,"I use to think Mr. Dean Jones was the leading funny man for the Disney studios, but Tom Tryon gives it his best as a rather clueless volunteer to the mission of orbiting the moon. He has been given a few days leave before the mission resumes, but not without it's security difficulties and comic mayhem. He also ""encounters"" a beautiful foreign female who begins to follow him wherever he goes, and almost always out of nowhere. I won't give out the result of this plot, but Mr. Tom Tryon should have done more for Disney as he shows positive comedic acting skills in this Moon Mission mishap. Fun to watch all the way.",1251676800,13,619,4.43859649122807
851313,3,6304368542,"Hollywood never quite decided how to handle Tom Tryon with the result that his roles ranged all the way from ""I Married a Monster from Outer Space"" to ""The Cardinal."" ""Moon Pilot"" represents his only foray into farce and while he might seem miscast, his very ""out-of-place"" quality probably anchors this film more securely than had it starred other actors, (such as Dean Jones or Dick Van Dyke), who would have been thought more adept at this sort of thing. As for the movie itself, its scientific hardware and special effects may seem either delightfully nostalgic or painfully dated -- depending on one's point of view -- but all will probably agree the film's pacing now seems slow and even a bit tedious. Livening up the proceedings, however, is a scene in which Tom Tryon is shown stripped to his boxer shorts -- something you might not expect to find in a family comedy from Walt Disney. Hollywood may have been puzzled as to how to cast the sexually-ambiguous Tryon, but they certainly knew a prime hunk of muscular, hairy ""beefcake"" when they saw it and thus Tryon's shirt manages to come off in virtually all of his movies.",1116028800,6,1132,4.693467336683417

851420,5,6304368542,"This is a classic and enjoyable movie for all ages. It is good clean fun. And it might be a little dated by today's standards, but it is still fun to watch",1404086400,,155,3.875
851421,5,6304368542,The plot is thin and the action is nill but the actors and actress try to bring life to this movie.  It starts out with a Astronaut who has problems when he is in space and a beautiful alien who wants to tell the U.S. Space people that it dangerous unless they coat the space craft so the guy doesn't go crazy.  Of course the alien is beautiful and Dean Jones is the Astronaut.  The americans think the alien is a Russian spy but her and dean jones fall in love and she saves the day.,1398988800,,484,4.020833333333333
851422,5,6304368542,"When this film was first released, I was a boy only 12 years old and obsessed with aviation & space.  (I grew up to be an airline pilot).  Naturally, I had to see the film over and over again.  It cost my whole allowance.  I thought at that time that it was the greatest film in the history of moviemaking.  Travel to the Moon was difficult to imagine way back in the early 60's and Moon Pilot led the way of our imagination as our space program was in its infancy.

I'm sorry that Dany Saval was not given more credit for her brilliant performance.  I would have loved to see her make more American films in the years following Moon Pilot.  All the actors were excellent in this film, but Dany Saval was unforgettable.

Little did I know that just several years later, I would be watching Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin make the first Lunar footsteps, and I would be able to actually ""own"" this old movie and play it whenever I want.  We do live in a magic era.  Here in the 21st Century, Moon Pilot looks dated, scientifically inaccurate, campy and a bit silly, but it was, and still is - a lot of fun.  I hope everyone enjoys it.",1392595200,5,1132,4.238317757009346
851423,5,6304368542,"Saw this when I was kid, and also bought the comic book, great movie, the dialogue if you listen closely is very well written, perfect casting here with both leads, and solid backups.

 They just do not make movies like this anymore, period, interesting space shots and endingwell worth the price to see it again.",1386028800,,313,4.672727272727273
851424,3,6304368542,"Some of the comedic situations were cute and somewhat zany. The overall story is just plain out there. And the characters are not really believable except Brian Keith who is probably the best actor in it. I wouldn't watch it again nor would I purchase it. If you want a zany, goofy comedy to rent it might do the trick for some. Also the cover shot makes you think that the chimp plays a major role in the film. He is only in the first part and that's a shame because his presence in ALL of the film would have been much more hilariously funny. Too bad THAT wasn't the plot instead of the one they chose -- ET contact with human astronauts with some half-baked story about friendly collaboration concerning the space program. And not only that the aliens have French accents! You wonder if this might be the original idea behind the coneheads on SNL.",1382918400,,850,4.420382165605096
851425,3,6304368542,"This movie features a gorgeous alien who speaks with a French accent.  She has some unusual powers and shows up rather suddenly during critical point in an astronaut's career.  Cute movie.  There is a bit of sexual innuendo that wouldn't be appropriate for smaller children.  And it lacks the sophistication for a romance movie or the witty dialogue of something with Carey Grant in it.  But still, it is charming.",1378684800,,414,4.857142857142857
851426,5,6304368542,"With the help of a well placed fork, Capt. Richmond Talbot (Tom Tryon) volunteers to make the first manned flight around the moon.  On one condition, that he first goes home to say goodbye to his mother.  From that point on, it's a weird game of hide and seek.  Is he being followed?  Is a spy (""the enemy never sleeps!"") after him?  Does he need protection?  In steps McClosky (Edmond O'Brien) a Fed with dubious intelligence and a whole lot of curiosity (""they don't tell me a thing!"").  When O'Brien and Brian Keith (as Major General Vanneman) go nose to nose, snarl for snarl, it provides some of the biggest laughs in this quirky little comedy.  My favorite sequence is the beatnik lineup (""dig that bottomless pit man!"").  Sally Field is supposedly one of these beatniks but you couldn't prove it by me.  Whether it's treason, mutiny, or petty larceny, this is a very funny film (although at times it does have the feel of a 60's sitcom).  Tom Tryon is adept at playing gullible, Dany Saval (as Lyrae the spy/alien) is sweet and charming.  Pure joy all around and a great addition to my DVD library.",1377820800,,1105,4.553299492385787
851487,5,6304368542,"The subject of a man on the moon may not still be a futuristic big deal but this classic, with an alien subtheme, reminds one of Jerry Lewis' film ""Visit To A Small Planet"".  Part of the Disney Vault Collection, ""Moon Pilot"" completes my Disney live action comedy collection!",1369872000,2,275,4.612244897959184
851488,5,6304368542,Great Quality and enjoyable watching it.  It is amazing how the pilot volunteered!  When leaned over to pick up the spoon the chip dropped on the floor and he stab the future pilot with a fork.,1366156800,,193,4.333333333333333

the movie changed in 50 years!  If you liked
this when it came out, keep your memory of
it intact and don't watch it again.  Not much
of anything going for it.",1358294400,,206,3.880952380952381
851491,5,6304368542,"I really enjoyed this film. It captures that ""Space Race"" era (the early 1960's) in an urgent and simultaneously delightful way. It is rare to find the time preserved in such a film so wonderfully.",1355184000,,197,4.6571428571428575
851492,3,6304368542,I have to admit I watched this because Tom Tryon was a friend and neighbor of one of my friends- and I had never seen him in a film- and was mostly curious how he would do.  It was kind of cute- naive.  There was very little chemistry with the girl- who was quite forgettable.  I don't regret seeing it- it is amusing in its own way- and if you like old Disney screwball comedies it is fun if you don't expect much.  Tom Tryon seems a little more intelligent than the film- and perhaps gives his role more weight than one of the typical actors they used in this genre.  He seems like a good actor who is lost in a ridiculous farce and seems genuinely bewildered through much of it.  One of these days I'll get around to seeing one of his more serious films or reading his books.,1350518400,,778,4.119205298013245

851494,3,6304368542,"I just saw this on TCM (very good picture and sound).

This is the most unusual Disney Movie I have ever seen. Sort of a serious, romantic, science-fiction, comedy, drama. It's really different, and a lot of fun.

While I enjoyed this movie a lot for the beautiful, sweet, mysterious woman (mistaken for a Russian Spy with a French accent), and the amazing on location filming in San Francisco at a time when The City was so clean, it's really too bad it wasn't directed better, because the story idea really is top notch.

Since some of the actors in the movie are really pretty great, and the script was OK, one can only blame the director, and upon checking I did find that his entire career consisted mostly of directing TV Episodes (and very few from each series at that)!

Moon Pilot is a bit dull and silly at the beginning, but definitely give it a chance, because it becomes much better as it goes. No matter how good the second half seems though, I must compare it to true 5 Star Disney films, such as Mary Poppins, Pollyanna, and Escape To Witch Mountain, and come to the conclusion that this movie Cannot be given more than 3 stars, unfortunately. That's the way the rating systems work. One must think of the best films in the genre and then try to give a fair assessment based on them.

FASCINATING FACTS ABOUT THIS MOVIE:

Three different major fictional works are predicted in ""Moon Pilot""...

1. The overly serious military men acting in a comical way would be done to perfection two years Later in Dr. Strangelove.

2. A conversation during this movie reminds one of First Contact Rules (which would not be introduced to the Star Trek franchise until many years later).

3. There is a fairly distinct similarity to the entire ""I Dream of Jeannie"" concept, which would begin three years later.

The Incidental Music is by Paul J. Smith (Thomasina, Pollyanna, 20,000 Leagues, The Vanishing Prairie, So Dear To My Heart, Melody Time, Saludos Amigos, Song of The South...)

And there is even a song by the Sherman Brothers at the end.

Even though I only gave it 3 stars, definitely see it for it's uniqueness, and other gems.
