4673001,5,B005F650D6,"One of the most amazing movies about Christmas that I've ever seen. The plot was refreshing and a deviation from the normal Christmas cliches. A unique and original script that combines suspense,humor, a good dose of the Ghanaian Christmas spirit and wonderful graphics.

I would watch this over and over again. A great value for money!",1312329600,8,336,5.0

8469658,2,B005F650D6,Acting is not very good and voice and picture quality poor - I will finish watching it but only because I paid for it...,1391299200,,120,4.041666666666667
8469659,5,B005F650D6,"Loved the fact that I could watch a Nollywood movie on my Kindle Fire!!!!!!!!

Amazon needs to look further into delivery of more Nollywood Movies to Kindle.

Move was clear and sharp---with no streaming problems or stops.",1389830400,,222,4.972972972972973
8469660,3,B005F650D6,"I'm conservative. I'm not about watching the sex, and I hate hearing cursing. Whilst not disgusting like in Nigerian and ESPECIALLY Ghanian movies, it was enough to give me pause. I did buy it before watching because Shirley Frimpong-Manso is a genius and I love her work, but this movie was not my favorite from her and I am not sure I would have bought the movie had I seen it first. It was good, don't get me wrong. There was humor and the acting was amazing, but I was not expecting what I got. It was good.",1388793600,,511,4.224489795918367
8469661,5,B005F650D6,This was a well written script. You could not guess what was going to happen next. The story line will make you think next time about cheating on your mate.,1376006400,,156,4.233333333333333
8469662,5,B005F650D6,"With Tv gone digital there are so many additional channels to watch. I tuned in unawares to a tv channel where this movie was televised. I was so captivated by this movie that after watching it I had to get online to Amazon.com to buy my own copy. HIV/Aids is a harsh reality. I say harsh because even today people after the discovery of the disease in 1988 people  are taking risks with their health with risky sexual behaviors. Women are blaming the down low men instead of taking responsibility themselves. People do not communicate and ask the ""it"" question before they indulge in a night of passion. Is it worth the risk?  Talk about cheating hearts or the one that you love is the stranger you never knew. You may have seen the movie COVER or even COLORED GIRLS whereby Janet Jackson played that role in which she tested positive for hiv with her contracted from her dl husband. But 6 hours to Christmas is different as the drama is ongoing as it  heats up to a spell binding climax! I will not give the movie away with its plots and its twists  but I would suggest for couples to watch it together or even that single man or woman can watch it too. Girl, invite your girlfriends over and watch this movie.  Parents should watch movies like this with their teenage children. Young children/teens are having sex too! Love is Love but we must not let others make ""the choice"" for us. Choose life!",1355184000,,1400,4.453125
8469663,2,B005F650D6,"I bought this movie based on the review and I love Christmas movies.  So I thought that it would have some
Christmas spirit or theme to the movie,

IT DID NOT. NOTHING ABOUT CHRISTIMAS, BUT THE WORSE WRITTEN MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN.

THIS WOMAN WHO WROTE THIS MOVIE, NEEDS TO GIVE IT UP.  SHE IS NOT A WRITER OR DIRECTOR OR PRODUCER.

GET A NEW JOB.

THIS WAS THE WORSE MESS I HAVE EVER SEEN. FROM PLOT 2 PLOT, AND SOME OF IT I COULD NOT EVEN UNDERSTAND THE
SUPPOSED 'ENGLISH'.

I WAS FURIOUS.

PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.  I'M MAD I DID,",1329004800,,540,4.115384615384615
