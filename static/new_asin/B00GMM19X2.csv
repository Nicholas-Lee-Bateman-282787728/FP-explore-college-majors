6087133,5,B00GMM19X2,"Hamlisch was a gifted and terrifically talented musician and composer. His skills and his ability to play anything, in any key at will made him the hit of everything from fraternity get-togethers to concert performances. I loved this tape.",1407110400,,239,5.153846153846154

6087135,5,B00GMM19X2,It is a stirring and nostalgic experience to review the achievements and challenges in the live of Marvin Hamlisch.  I saw it on PBS and decided to get a copy for myself and my brother.,1389312000,3,185,4.285714285714286
6087136,5,B00GMM19X2,"I watched the PBS show on public television and await release of the DVD with its bonus material and unaired clips about the making of A Chorus Line.

The outstanding PBS American Masters documentary on the Peoples Composer, Marvin Hamlisch, lovingly celebrates the extraordinary life and talent of a magnificent mensch.  Through his unforgettable music and the video clips of Hamlisch himself and the many artists and performers who were his friends (among them, Barbra Streisand, Lucie Arnaz, Carly Simon, Quincy Jones, John Lithgow, and Idina Menzel), PBS paints a sensitive portrait of the triumphs and travails of an irrepressible world class composer and entertainer who left us far too soon.  Particularly poignant are the backstory about the creation of A Chorus Line -- a Broadway musical that broke all molds and records of its time -- and Hamlischs telephonic courtship with the love of his life and future wife, Terre Blair Hamlisch.  Although he is gone, his music  and his passion for people  will endure.",1388880000,8,1019,5.108433734939759
6087137,5,B00GMM19X2,"The story of Marvin's life is told with love!
Marvin's own words tell much of the story-from his first hit
""Sunshine Lollipops and Rainbows"" to the overwhelming success of ""A Chorus Line""
to ""The Sweet Smell of Success"" which didn't make it on Broadway.
Marvin's story is told by his writing collaborators,and stars like Barbra Streisand, and warm, loving  thoughts from his
beautiful wife Terre.
Everyone talks about his big heart, generosity, and talent!
Marvin truly was a musical genius and his rise to fame is documented with insight and honesty by his friend and movie producer Dori Berinstein.
It is well worth watching!
Truly Marvin Hamlisch was ONE SINGULAR SENSATION!",1388275200,17,677,5.099099099099099
6087138,5,B00GMM19X2,"This review is based on the PBS TV show as the DVD will not be shipped until Jan 14.  I was in ecstasy, tears of joy running down my face, for the one and half hour show and had to order the DVD so my wife could experience it also.  Fabulous depiction of the man, his music and his relationship to American show business.  Done with great love and insight!  I pity his wife (he married late) because he was really married to music as expressed in theater and movies.  Everything they played in this show brought back memories for me.  The depiction of Marvin's difficulties in writing for ""A Chorus Line"" and how his mental block was resolved was marvelous!  I did not know that this show was a major factor in the decision to clean up the theater district in New York.  They said in this show that the audience for the premier of A Chorus Line stood and cheered and refused to leave the theater!!  I never saw the stage show.  I think it must have been much better than the movie version.",1388188800,18,989,4.268817204301075
8624719,4,B00GMM19X2,"One problem I have with all the American Masters progams is the fact that the subjects seem to have no human frailties. Friends and associates go on, and on, and on about how fabulous this person was, how kind, how charitable, etc. etc., as if they never had a single negative trait. To me, this is a two-dimensional approach. I don't want to hear ""bad"" things about someone, but at the same time, I would like to hear that they were human. I call this ""PBS-itis"" and I have turned off American Masters due to this endless, sometimes gushing effusiveness. The only remotely negative thing was talking about his poorly-received Broadway plays after A Chorus Line, but it was as if the expectation was that ALL his subsequent works would be as successful. Also, I have to say that I found his personality brash and a bit obnoxious, and the music not very deep. He fancied himself a latter-day Gershwin, but his music lacked depth. Getting a lot of major awards doesn't make you a genius - it makes you popular. It was worth watching, but I had reservations about it.",1484784000,,1064,4.575916230366492
