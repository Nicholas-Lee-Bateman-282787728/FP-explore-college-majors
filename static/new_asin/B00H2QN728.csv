It DOES play in Region 1 players (United States) and this is the only one I have found that does.  Al the others are formatted for Region 2. But the aspect ratio is a little messed upon this. The whole image is there, but it's like the image is squeezed in from the sides. It's not horrible. Still watchable, I'm sure your eyes will get used to it after a while. By the way, I wanted this movie because Tom Hardy is in it...I'd watch it even if the image was upside down just to see that man on action ;)",1406419200,,600,3.918032786885246

The way certain aspects of this movie were described to me, I knew this would be a little cheesy. However, I know plenty of great movies that are a little cheesy but because of the love of the characters and the love of the story it doesn't matter. The movie as a whole was great. This is not one of those movies. Started off really slow and once it reached the climax it didn't make that much of an impact. As much as I love Tom Hardy, truly he was the only thing worth seeing in this movie and they don't utilize him enough. It's an ok movie to rent, not sure about buying it though. Let's put it this way, when the ending credits rolled I had the.....do what, huh? look on my face.",1362355200,,775,4.139072847682119
