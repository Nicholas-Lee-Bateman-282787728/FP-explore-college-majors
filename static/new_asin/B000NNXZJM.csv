8179478,5,B000NNXZJM,"We bought my son's first Toopy and Binoo DVD (Big Parade) on impulse in a toy store while visiting Canada. The cover of the DVD looked like nothing we have seen before (and he has a very extensive DVD collection). Since then my son has collected almost all available Toopy and Binoo DVDs. Unfortunately, very few retailers sell Toopy and Binoo in the US, so it is not an easy task.

All Toopy and Binoo DVDs, including this one, are of high quality. The stories are funny, imaginative, innocent, lighthearted and full of wonder and happiness. The pace of action is neither too fast nor too slow. Some episodes include excellent musical pieces. Color combinations and drawings are amazing. Toopy and Binoo is undoubtedly one of the best children's shows.",1215907200,8,753,4.792307692307692
