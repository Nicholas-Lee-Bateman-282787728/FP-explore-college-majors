8412237,5,B001HL00YM,"I found this film very charming.  The kids were very well spoken and the content presented was very informative.  I wish, however, that there were subtitles.  The average speaker of English will have no problem whatsoever understanding these precocious kids, but English learners can benefit a lot from this title, as well as the hearing impaired. I have been buying a lot of documentaries lately, and find that many great ones (Transgeneration, Party, King of Kong, American Hardcore, Afropunk) do not contain subtitles or captions.  Documentarians, don't sell yourselves short!  You have a wider audience than you suspect.  : )",1235952000,6,629,5.24
