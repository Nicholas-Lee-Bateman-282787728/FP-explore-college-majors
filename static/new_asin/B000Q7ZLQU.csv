2833918,5,B000Q7ZLQU,"I love all the Barbie movies, but this has to be my favorite! It has a lot of similar aspects to some of my favorite Disney (and non-Disney) animated movies, which I loved. The story flows well and the characters are endearing. The animation is, in my opinion, the best in the series; the colors are more vibrant, which makes it less jarringly CG, and I love the character designs (such as Ro's braid and Prince Antonio's face, which was different than all the other ""Kens"").

What really makes this movie a winner, though, is the soundtrack. Just TRY and tell me that those songs don't get stuck in your head. I've been listening to them OVER and OVER. The best song in the movie by far is ""I Need to Know."" The duet between Alessandro Juliani (Antonio) and Melissa Lyons (Ro) is absolutely GORGEOUS. Their harmony is amazing, I got goosebumps! The other songs are good too, I can't get ""The Rat Song"" out of my head.

These movies are good for people who like visually pleasing stories that don't make you think too hard. Call it predictable, but it's nice when you can count on everyone living happily ever after. While deep, dark, thought-provoking movies serve their purpose, when you're stressed out or just want to relax, sometimes you just need a good cartoon. That's what Disney movies USED to be about, and the Barbie movies have taken over in their stead. This movie has excellent values in it, such as respect for animals, the value of caring for others, and the importance of sharing  (the lyrics to the song ""Always More"" are really good for this), and following your heart. I would definitely show this movie to little girls, as it's movies like this that provide wholesome entertainment with good values to children, while being entertaining to adults as well.

I encourage you to try this movie out before you make up your mind that it's ""silly"" or ""kids stuff.""",1190764800,12,1879,4.633633633633633
2833919,4,B000Q7ZLQU,"What I liked:

1) The story was cute
2) The other woman wasn't a jerk
3) Ro's reunion at the end with someone who missed her all those years
4) barbie's animation was good (not creepy like the earlier barbie movies)

What I didn't like:

1) The obligatory 3 kelly dolls - one blonde, one brunette, one red-head.  Marketing so obvious even my 8yo figured out their ploy

2) The ugly peacock dress and accompanying song.  Who goes to a party after being showered with glitter? And how come the feathers didn't look like feathers by the time she put them on her dress?

3) The mother was very much an absentee mother in the roles of her children, choosing instead to obsess over her monkey

4) A missed opportunity for the queen to learn to treat the intelligent animals as friends rather than pets

5) The very stereotypical ugly villainess with a bad pompadour and insane pets

6) The prince's animation lacked soul

7) Tika's nightmares. What were they all about?

8) When the prince danced with Ro at that party, it was a direct slap in the face to Luciana, who didn't care that she was being humiliated.",1190764800,7,1105,4.47
2833920,4,B000Q7ZLQU,"I'm amazed at some of the detailed reviews about this kids movie.  My 5 year old liked it and that's great.  It had a cute story and some nice songs.  I don't think she really cares that much about character development, etc.  So if you want a nice fun movie for your child, get it.  If you are looking for something deeper, move on.",1190332800,7,333,4.140625
2833921,4,B000Q7ZLQU,"Okay, this is not going to win any awards by any means, but really what barbie movie is? I really enjoyed Princess and the Pauper and the Dancing Princesses was pretty good, but the rest were hard to sit through.  I'm giving it 4 stars because my kids did seem to enjoy it. As an adult, the plot was very bland and predictable, but it had a few fun songs I enjoyed. Although it wasn't wonderful, it wasn't terrible either. If you have a barbie fan, it's worth a look.",1190246400,6,467,4.188888888888889
2833922,4,B000Q7ZLQU,"I once heard a definition of integrity as something you are when nobody's watching.  I also once heard someone comment that there must be no honor among filmmakers because apparently nobody in a high-budget production cared that the movie made was terrible.  Well, I have to say, this movie is yet another shining example of the Barbie movies' integrity.

  They could get away with SO much--they don't NEED to put a plot or characters or even any kind of acting into this, honestly.  BUT THEY DO.  The reason I pick this movie out of the crop is that (a) it was just released, and (b) it's a great example of the integrity that is so lost among high-end studio productions these days.  Why?  Think--what movie is similar to this?  Can you think of any parallels?  Especially in the Disney array?  It's a movie with striking similarities to the Little Mermaid.

 BUT, instead of making the heroine a selfish brat and saving it with appealing sidekicks and great music, the characters themselves are likable (or hate-able) and they DON'T have to make the person trying to marry the prince a creepy person either.  It's so great!  The music, as in the Princess and the Pauper, is shockingly good; the animation and visuals just keep getting better and better; and the storytelling and character development are far above the par of the so-called ""best"" of Hollywood today.

If you have already started collecting the Barbie movies, get this one too.  If not, start right now! Little girls and you(!) will ACTUALLY enjoy them together.  This is a worthwhile movie to see, as are the other Barbie movies.  Even the weakest of them (story-wise) is morally strong and is better quality than most Hollywood fare these days.

Enjoy this film integrity!",1190246400,78,1744,4.785234899328859
2833923,3,B000Q7ZLQU,"Okay, I will admit up front that my five-year-old daughter and I have only watched this DVD once, and sometimes movies grow on you the more you watch them.  But our initial reaction is one of disappointment. I thought the songs were very forgettable and the main characters weren't very interesting (Prince Antonio, in particular, is pretty bland and the villaness is not as colorful as in past Barbie movies.) My daughter had been so excited about finally getting to see Island Princess, especially since it is a musical, but she wandered away several times while it was on (something she doesn't do while watching Princess and the Pauper or Swan Lake, her two favorite Barbie movies.) I have a feeling Island Princess is not going to join the list of her most-requested DVDs.",1190160000,19,777,4.798507462686567

As many of the Barbie movies do, it suffers from a lack of diversity, but it does have positive messages about being true to yourself and the dangers of classism/prejudices.

The animation is not great (as my husband says, it looks like late 90s video game quality) but this doesn't bother my daughter. I am more interested in the content and this is a pretty good movie on that count. Here are some of my favorite points. The Barbie character (Ro) considers the animals she lives with to be her family, and when she explores a new place and tries to find her human family, the animals come with her. When Ro meets the prince, she saves him from some alligators. The prince is impressed by Ro's skills and abilities, not just her beauty. The prince has three small sisters whom he seems to adore. When the prince argues with his father and gives up his crown, he says that he will step down and his sisters will rule. The baby elephant is worried that Ro and the prince will get married and not have a place in their life for the animals. Ro explains that she will always love them and their family will just expand. When the villain is revealed at the end of the movie, the prince and Ro both chase her but Ro actually is the one who apprehends her. The music is fairly good and there is decent dialogue. Overall this was well worth the price and my daughter loves it. I have been picky about which movies I'll allow my daughter to watch and I appreciate the detailed reviews of other parents, so hopefully this will help someone else out.",1421107200,2,1464,4.327272727272727

2834208,5,B000Q7ZLQU,"Yes, another good Barbie movie added to my daughter's collection. However, my order of 4 DVDs arrived 3 days late and two of the cases were damaged.

2834209,5,B000Q7ZLQU,"My 9 year old loves these movies - and this one is no exception - they have all been good - usually with a nice character trait built in as well.  She really enjoyed this movie about a princess who did not know she was a princess.  She had lost her memory.  She fell in love with the prince, but did not want to give up her simple island life to become a princess.  There is an evil queen, and animals that can understand the princess and a missing mom.  All kinds of fun drama for a young girl!  Great songs & cute movie.",1393891200,2,522,3.9711538461538463

Island Princess is her favorite so far.  In fact this is the 3rd copy I have purchased because my daughter wanted to give them as birthday presents for her friends.",1392681600,,323,4.440677966101695

2834226,5,B000Q7ZLQU,My daughter (age 4) is sitting next to me and wanted to tell everyone she loved this movie.  I would compare the quality of this Barbie movie to the 12 Dancing Princesses movie.  She has shelved pretty much every other Barbie movie but those two after watching one or two times.  This one was a favorite.  From an adult (Dad) perspective I have to say it was well made.  The songs are really well done and the story is unique and entertaining for a 'princess' movie.,1386806400,2,466,4.372093023255814

2834230,5,B000Q7ZLQU,"My daughter who's 1.5 yrs old, loves barbie movies to begin with, but this one she especially loves. I actually like it too. It's pretty entertaining and the theme is colorful and interesting. It isn't repetitive like some of the Barbie movies can be. Overall great movie with lots of talking animals which keeps her attention and has plenty of soothing pretty music too. No scary parts so its good for little ones.",1382832000,,415,4.698630136986301
2834231,5,B000Q7ZLQU,"This is a high quality, first-rate animated musical. It is as good as the Disney Classics. The music is original and performed with a great deal of perfection, and very memorable. The characters are excellent. My children have memorized a number of the songs and the sayings from this movie. They ask me to do the Red Panda's voice, and the kids love mimicking the Elephant's silly childish voice.

Barbie movies have surprised me with their level of excellence. Celebrity voices are often employed and Kelly Sheridan is Barbie.",1382572800,,528,4.932584269662922

2834256,5,B000Q7ZLQU,"As much as Barbie is a toy icon she's also decried by some as an unrealistic and misguided symbol of sexism in our society.  All political considerations aside, we own a ton of the Barbie movies because we've found that they unfailingly have very positive messages for girls and really have very little to recommend against.

I won't go into the specifics of plot, which can be found elsewhere, but my daughter is 6 and anything involving princesses and music is where her main interests lie.  She loves this movie and has watched it multiple times.  She loves the music and the humor - it makes her happy, so it makes my wife and me happy.",1374019200,,640,4.491379310344827

2834329,2,B000Q7ZLQU,"I love this movie's music and the overall plot is fine. I would enjoy it without the outright murderous villainess.  But showing it to little kids I'd feel the need to fast forward probably 20 percent of the movie. The evil queen is very clear in her intentions to poison and murder, she's not nice to her rat henchman, and she's got a creepy monkey. Not a fan of any of that. I get that she's the villain, but for little kids I don't feel the need to teach them about murdering, poisoning, and animal cruelty so blatently at age 3 or 4.",1353888000,2,537,4.213592233009709

2834331,5,B000Q7ZLQU,"I gave this movie to my daughter yesterday, she loves it, and didn't want to turn it off, as soon as she got up this morning, she started watching it from the beginning again today.
She has a Barbie Island Princess book, has read it many, many times, she loved the little hair piece that came in the book, she fell asleep wearing it last night after watching the movie.
With so much junk out there now that is aimed at kids, and family, as family entertainment, it's nice to be able to know that the Barbie movies are going to be safe for everyone, they might be a little cheesy for adults, but the content is always reliable for safe viewing, and always has a positive message in them, never anything I question, or have to regret letting her see.
As long as my daughter is entertained by Barbie, I will keep buying the Barbie movies.",1331424000,2,835,4.32484076433121

Not her favorite. 12 Dancing Princesses and the New Charm School movies are her favorites.  Diamond Castle gets watched a lot as well.  However, for me personally, it is no different than the others. Maybe a little more boring or unimaginative but not significantly.  Worth no more than $5.",1324944000,4,411,4.575342465753424

I just wish that Barbie movies were more... innocent. Can't Barbie just play with her friends and do fun things instead of having a ""fall in love"" theme to almost every movie?

The thing that bothered me the most with this particular movie was the mother of the princess who is a disgrace to humanity. She sings about marrying an old guy so he'll die quick and she will inherit his wealth. I just don't understand why they need to put this stuff in a kids movie.

Can't anyone come up with a good, child-appropriate story line for young girls?!!!",1323734400,10,740,4.340579710144928

Like all Barbie movies, they are kid friendly, with NO sexual innuendos, adult humor, drinking, or smoking. The characters are lovable and have strong personalities. The story is well done and the music is enjoyable. Macy's Thanksgiving parade actually had a float dedicated to this movie if anyone remembers. The animation is, of course, not Pixar, but it is still well done. Oh, right, our kids also love this movie. :-P",1322352000,,539,4.869565217391305

All in all, they did a great job with this one.. the storyline was very good, and the villain was not too scary for the young ones, which has been a problem for us with some of the other movies.

If they are age appropriate, enjoyable, the children enjoy them - then the movie has met it's goal. Life's too short to not just sit with the kids, a bucket of popcorn and sing along with Barbie.

The story is strong, the characters are believable, the animation is beautiful, and (best of all) the music is outstanding!  This movie is a musical, and it is the quality of the musical numbers that sets this movie apart - it is Broadway quality.  In fact, the lead singers are indeed Broadway stars.

2834408,2,B000Q7ZLQU,"Barbie stars this time as the shipwrecked young princess who grows up lost but not alone on a fantastic island where she learns to talk to the animals. After the arrival of an intrepid young prince who is an adventurer, Barbie returns with him to his kingdom only to find herself a bit of an outcast. With the help of her animal friends, Barbie and her kindness win over the prince and defeat an evil woman bent on revenge.

I thought this Barbie flick was sub par. The story starts off okay, but I quickly got a bit tired of the campy Peacock character and the sheer sueness of Barbie. No one is more perfect, kinder, or more enlightened than Barbie. Even the rival for the princes' affections isn't much of a contender. This is a kid's film, so I can understand such black and white characterizations, but there really isn't much more to Ro's character than sweetness, and not much to the plot other than predictability.

I would've liked to have seen more development of Ro's family. And whoever designed the Queen's monkey? That thing  was seriously creepy. It looked like a little person.

Anyway, the Barbie in this movie is anything but vain; in fact, I am happy with the morals taught in this movie-friendship, loyalty, grace, and perserverance, among others.

Not my favorite of the Barbie movies, but a fun addition to the arsenal of girl movies that are wholesome and fun, with strength instead of 'tude, and romance instead of sex appeal.

Pros: Likeable characters (even if a little one-dimensional), positive messages, catchy songs, beautiful animation, cool blue peacock dress (take that, you fluffy pink stereotype!), fun karaoke feature

Cons: The ""impossibilities"" of plot, etc. seemed a little more jarring in this real-world/human setting than in the previous movies, perhaps because the others took place in settings of ""magic"" wherein one is already suspending disbelief.  This is a problem for adults (but you didn't buy it for you, though, did you?) and possibly girls over 7.

I find them very well done, they could easily make them cheap and boring with unimaginative CGI (as someone else mentioned)but, I think they put a lot of heart into these movies. I thought this story had a unique twist to it(in terms of Ro's struggle to be accepted) and visually all the Barbie movies are very beautiful, escpecially this one. My only complaint is that the main character is always blond, blue eyed, caucasian Barbie and I think children deserve more reality, they've done the blond thing over and over (and there's nothing wrong with it) BUT it's time to move on and give a more realistic view of women. Maybe in the next movie Barbie could take a sidekick role so we could have a little healthy cultural variety, they do it with their dolls why not with their movies?

2834487,5,B000Q7ZLQU,"It is great to see Barbie returning to the musical format. Much of the plot of the movie might be trite, but the format is clever, and there is a great deal of appeal in these for adults and children. My 4 and 5 year old girls really enjoyed the film, and I loved the music.

The basic story is that a young girl is washed up on an isolated island. She grows up with animals and learns to speak `animal' so she can communicate with them like we would with each other. The island is visited by a Prince who is rescued by Ro and then takes her back to his land (with her animal friends of course), she wants to find out where she comes from (a great song accompanies this!) However once there Prince Antonio finds that he has been betrothed to a princess from a neighbouring kingdom. Unbeknownst to them all, the mother of the Princess has a score to settle with Prince Antonio's father, King Peter, and intends to exact revenge on them all once the wedding has happened. Ro gets dressed for the royal ball, (another fabulous song!) but feels out of place there. Ro, realizing she is out of place wants to go back to her own island. Prince Antonio is forced to give her up and she gets put on a boat, but is betrayed and nearly dies when she is knocked into the water. She manages to survive by calling the dolphins. Making her way back to land she rescues everyone from the evil queen discovers what she needs to know about herself  and marries prince Antonio (of course) - the final song is just amazing.

The colours of Barbie movies are incredibly bright, and this is no exception, perhaps a bit too bright, but it does set them apart

The animators of these movies are clearly developing with each movie, and the animation is in this is really very good. We see greater range of movement depicted in this than in any other movie and the characters manage to move in fairly realistic form. I like the way the camera plays at different angles making it feel much more like modern film-making (the scene when Ro is in the ballroom talking to Prince Antonio is a case in point) but also when Prince Antonio jumps off the moving carriage to rescue the girl knocked off the bridge - very smart and `die hard' action style scene - most impressive!

My only real dislike in this movie is the animals - the Red panda, Saj is fine, but the Elephant (Tika) and the Monkey, Tallulah are just plain freaky. Tallulah really scared my children she looks almost human but in a totally unnatural way. Please a little more realism there!

The Music is just extraordinary. These are great sing-along style songs. There are some which are incredibly witty in almost Cole Porter style - the song about getting dressed for the ball is a case in point - smart, sassy and snappy lyrics. The music for it has great harmonys and style. It might be trite at times, but it is great to sing along with and we have been using the Karaoke section to learn them (great idea thanks!)

The various comments in other reviews about Tika the Elephants' nightmares. This isn't absolutely obvious, but Tika is scared of being left alone, of Ro leaving her. She expresses this when they leave the island, and again on the boat when she admits to hiding Prince Antonio's note from Ro. The ending shows that she has come to terms with this.

Anyway, there are some drawbacks to the movie, holes in the plot you could drive an elephant through. On the other hand, there are things in here such as the music which take the movie up to a new level. This is overall a great movie and gets a 5 out of 5 easily from my family.",1192320000,4,3581,4.35832083958021
2834488,5,B000Q7ZLQU,"We have all of the Barbie movies except for Nutcracker, but we have rented it and watched it as well.  My daughter, my mother, and myself all enjoy watching these Barbie movies together.  This one is up there at the level of our favorite - The Princess and the Pauper.  Although the songs aren't quite as catchy as that one, we rank Barbie as the Island Princess as number 2 in the growing list of Barbie movies.  Their animation is getting better and smoother looking as time goes by, and they offer great role models for young girls.  Mattel is on the right track for girls with these Barbie movies.  I just hope they can keep up the momentum offering this new generation of girls a code of ethics, a can do attitude, sharing of thoughts and communication, along with a consideration of others.  Bravo to one toy maker who's getting it right.  I wish the rest would follow.  And my daughter asks, ""When will they have a Barbie movie in theater?""

2834489,5,B000Q7ZLQU,"Let me start off by saying like most Barbie movies the color and animation is beautiful. Viewers really get a look at the colorful and magical island Barbie resides in. In this movie Barbie has new original songs! Much like her Princess and the Pauper days we not only see Barbie dance on her island but sing!

All her animal friends as always have a ton of mascara on with long eyelashes..must be that type Queen Latifa always be talking about!

There is an evil gold digger mother who sings about marrying the ""oldest king she could find"" and then he died the next day leaving the kingdom to her and how she wants her daughter to forget about ""those other clowns"" and concentrate on ""boys with crowns"". She not only drugs all the animals in the kingdom using a Lunesta or Valium type drug called ""sunset herb"" but manages to also hijack a carriage and almost run over three maidens causing one of them to almost fall of a cliff!

Next Barbie's elephant is very odd..she is obsessed with Barbie to the point of destroying a romantic letter the Prince left for Barbie and finally when she confesses to it she says things like ""what about us"" and ""if you married the prince then you would not love me"". The elephant even wants to follow them on their honeymoon saying ""maybe we can stowaway"". I think the elephant is a lesbian. She just acted strange throughout the whole movie like looking at herself in the waters reflection and having nightmares?

Barbie looks really pretty in this movie, in Fairytopia her face looked older. I even thought her bitchy mermaid friend Nori was better looking.
One thing though..she did need some lipstick in this movie..I mean the animals wore more makeup than her..

Of course there is a very touching moment at the end and not to mention great songs, romance and laughs along the way. If you love Barbie and all the amazing things she can do, add this to your collection!

Three year olds (at least mine) have very short attention spans and by the time the movie starts she's begging for something else because the Barbie movie isn't on. I then tend to reach for and redirect my daughter to other movies other than this DVD for this very reason.

This was not Barbie's strongest movie.  In fact, I was disappointed.  I was excited for Island Princess because it was a musical.
We really enjoyed the songs and my girls liked the movie, but the storyline was poorly developed.  All of a sudden a prince comes to the island and Ro not only decides she will sail away with him, but has ""feelings"" for him too.  How is that possible when all they said was hello?  Also Arianna's desire for revenge was merely mentioned in a song, again, poor development. Additionally, all the women in this movie looked about the same age.  I know Barbies always look good, but come on.  Arianna, in particular, hardly looked any older than her daughter.  This has never been an issue in Barbie movies before.  None of these things seemed to bother my daughters though.
Despite these flaws I know I will watch it again and again, mainly because my daughters will ask for it, but why not?
