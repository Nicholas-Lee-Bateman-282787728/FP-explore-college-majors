7995217,5,B0000A0PXW,"Lt. Dillon made two DVDs, volume 1 and volume 2
and they are packed with practical, actionable
techniques for self defense. Years later the
lessons taught in this DVD are still sound and solid,
because they are smart, simple, and highly effective.",1377388800,,247,4.904761904761905
7995218,5,B0000A0PXW,This is part 2. I loved part 1 and this is a great companion. Both videos cover the topics completely and easy to understand.,1356739200,,125,4.25
7995219,5,B0000A0PXW,"The DVD can be divided into two sections (one which focuses on physical maneuvers, the other on law enforcement concepts of unarmed defense). There is a menu that can be utilized if you only want to review a specific technique or concept. The material presented was based upon gross motor skills rather than fine motor skills which degrade in adrenalized situations. I do think that the techniques presented could be executed by most people with practice. The Lt. makes the maneuvers look so fluid and easy. He thoroughly explains each technique and they are designed so there are similarities between most of them so you don't need to learn 101 techniques. While not absolutely necessary, I'd recommend Vol. 1 also be purchased if you are thinking about buying this DVD.",1225324800,2,771,4.938461538461539
7995220,4,B0000A0PXW,"I have recently viewed this DVD and found the information provided by Lt. Dillon to be excellent.  The concepts are realistic and easy to learn.  Lt. Dillon is very articulate and thorough in his explanations.  The movements are demonstrated several times and from different angles giving the viewer a full view.(very professional)  As police officers, tactics must be effective and simple to learn, this is exactly what this production offers. I highly recommend this DVD to any police trainer.

7995221,2,B0000A0PXW,"This is the second film in a two part defensive tactics series aimed for police officers. In this film, Kevin Dillon concentrates more on actual techniques, rather than basic concepts and ideas. There is some more general discussion, also (like levels of awareness, and effect of stress on fine motor skills), but the emphasis is on techniques.
As this is a second part of a series, you are better off if you have seen the first part already, but it does not seem mandatory. The techniques in the film deal with situations like escaping from a chocke hold, defense against knife attacks, and handcuffing techniques. Dillon also presents the best target areas in a human body, where you should concentrate your attacks to have maximum effect.
The techniques presented in the film don't seem very realistic, in my opinion. Of course, Dillon can make them seem easy, but for an average, non martial artist street cop, they are not realistic. And there is a severe ""uke effect"" in play here, meaning that the target person is very co-operative (he is a good uke, as in traditional martial arts), by freezing his attack to help Dillon finish his moves. It does not work like that in real life, folks! I am not a martial artist, but as a police officer I have had my share of fights, and I can tell you that if your opponent is that co-operative, you don't have to fight him at all.
The production is average: the sound is good, but many times the camera zooms too close, making it difficult to get a clear view of the technique. They have used only one camera in filming the tape, so there are no multiple angle viewing, which would have made the film a bit more interesting.
This is not a bad tape. Personally, I think that the techniques presented are not very good, but there are some neat ideas and principles presented.
