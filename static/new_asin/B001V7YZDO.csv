3819334,5,B001V7YZDO,"As all the other reviewers have said this is a great slice of Americana. Mr. Kuralt had a great sense of bringing a ""common man "" attitude that brought the show to life. You could tell he enjoyed doing this show and learning everything he did which in turns pulls the viewers in. It's therefore my pleasure to announce a second series will be coming out, ""On the Road with Charles Kuralt"" set 2 arrives on May 10th 2010.
Support the releases so we'll get the whole series out on dvd.",1263772800,,483,4.318681318681318
3819335,5,B001V7YZDO,I got this as a gift for my in-laws anniversary.  They are REALLY enjoying these DVD's.  They said you not only see lots of interesting areas of our country but there are really great human interest stories to go with it. This was a GREAT GIFT!,1261180800,4,244,4.282608695652174
3819336,4,B001V7YZDO,We were fortunate enough to have seen some of these when first aired on television. It's great to see them again and reminisce.,1260057600,,127,4.565217391304348
3819337,5,B001V7YZDO,"These episodes of ""On the Road with Charles Kurault"" will bring you right back to America as we remember it.  I bought one set for each of my kids, for my Mom and for my sister.  The series presents interesting people, kind ones, odd things, all of which are presented with respect.

It is a pleasure to watch them again after all these years.",1259798400,,343,4.328125
3819338,5,B001V7YZDO,Terrific.  You won't regret a single penny of the purchase price!  News is not always made on the coasts.,1259625600,,105,4.473684210526316
3819339,5,B001V7YZDO,"I took the advice of another reviewer & bought this DVD set. Glad I did. Not only is this informative, but I like looking at the little things in the background of Mr. Kuralt's stops on his journey through America. The price of gas back then, the make of cars, the clothes, haircuts, etc. The spice of life that adds up to a real treat of culture that is fascinating, but sadly, no longer with us in many places. You'd be surprised how fast this set plays out because you don't want it to stop. For folks who like to travel or history buffs exploring our culture, this is a must. Also considering buying for future generations to show them ""how it was once-upon-a-time-in-our-era"". I hope more sets are coming. OUTSTANDING!",1259452800,5,723,4.526717557251908
3819340,5,B001V7YZDO,"This is an historic, personsal, colorful, presentation of American points of interest that are seldom seen by tourists unless time is taken to stop and visit ""off the tour"" presentations.  There is lots of things to learn about America and Americans that are not book written.  We enjoyed it and hope many others do the same.

The collection is better than the CBS series as seen many years before.",1259280000,,398,4.739130434782608
3819341,5,B001V7YZDO,Hope there are more to come...would love to see some of his audio books get released on cd as well!,1257724800,3,99,4.0
3819342,5,B001V7YZDO,"I am so glad someone is finally giving us chance to watch Mr Kuralt again, it is long overdue. We are awash in a dvd sea of F Troop, Sex In The City and their like and Heaven help us- we need Charles. A colleague of his once said ""Charlie sees things most of us don't see"". That is possibly the best way of summing up his enormous gifts. These are the stories most of us walk by everyday and barely notice but they say more about America, its history and its people than a million hours of contemporary reporting or roomful of history books. Charles Kuralt's way of telling the stories draws you in and seals the deal... NO ONE ever did this as well. I could bore you endlessly bragging on Kuralt but it wouldn't add anything, you just need to watch what he does.
  I hope this has been encouraging. Please get the set and encourage them to release more. One last note to the producers- There is a story Kuralt did on a Russian dentist that was in a Nazi prison camp with Americans and his own countrymen -please include this... PLEASE!  It is a fantastic piece and it's just the sort of thing most journalists pass by as less significant.",1257379200,17,1139,4.288372093023256
3819343,5,B001V7YZDO,"CHARLES KURALT and his ON THE ROAD ""lifetime achievement"" is, simply put, pure fun. The best way to describe ""ON THE ROAD WITH CHARLES KURALT"" is repeating the title. For those who remember watching the segments on CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite, this is nostalgia at its peak. For those too young or anyone who somehow missed all of the weekly segments over the 20 years, this is a slice of perhaps the best reporting ever broadcast on TV. It is nostalgic in segments from early days because of the dress of the Americans interviewed. Never, however, out of date. Kuralt, amazingly, shows some sign of aging from one to another story, but not what you'd expect over the 20 year span.  He was as timeless as the stories he found along the by-ways of Americana. The common man's poet.

Kuralt and team wore out six motor homes over the years beginning in 1967, when CBS gave Kuralt a 3-month ""trial"" of his ""On the Road"" journalism idea. Only the reporter's death would end the famous and enjoyable good-news segment weekly awaited upon by millions of Americans. It helps one forget troubles and simply enjoy moments in America that are centered around ordinary people. Why was it not duplicated? It is so perfect, who would dare try mimicking Kuralt's award winning achievement?

It is funny at times because of the oddity that is being reported or the way Kuralt has of presenting it. It is often quite heart-warming, touching, and home-spun. It is, upon occasion, patriotic, not political--there is a huge difference and Kuralt knew it. Sometimes it shares a life-time achievement of an individual that made a difference only in his/her own neighborhood, never flashy stars. Athletic achievement is in the form of people, like the 104 year old man who out ran almost everybody in town, including Kuralt when he visited. Amazing at time. Historical at others. Surprising. Challenging. Intellectual once in a while and informative always. A reviewer could come up with a superlative for every segment of every episode. Let's just leave it as history has done and simply say this set is ""On the Road with Charles Kuralt.""

The numbers: 1 set, 3 DVDs, 18 21-min. episodes (all with subtitles), 76 different stories, 378 minutes. We planned on watching an episode a day but couldn't do it. Enjoyment kept us going at the pace of a DVD a day. Extras of updates on some segments, On the Road history, and Charles Kuralt bio.

The cover states ""Set 1"" so there is hope that Set 2 will one-day be produced.
This DVD content was 20 years in the making thus the box statement of ""Due to the age of these programs and the improved resolution that DVD provides, you may notice occasional flaws in the image and audio on this DVD presentation that were beyond our ability to correct from the original materials."" It's hardly noticeable and not a problem, the program's too enjoyable.

As C.K. says: ""We've heard about a story up the road here, but we kind of hope we never get there. With luck, we'll stumble upon something more interesting along the way. I can see the road is bending--wonder what's around the bend.""

Now that she can't go as much, she can relive her adventures and remember places she has seen.  I loved this series when it was just an audio tape.",1419897600,,243,4.260869565217392

3819390,5,B001V7YZDO,"This set (and set 2) were exactly what I hoped they would be.  As a photographer I have a love affair with the United States. I was inspired and delighted to watch this set of stories from Charles Kuralt. It amazes me that he found these people -- from young horseshoe flinging champions to senior citizens with big hearts for their communities to a gun-toting lady mayor -- on the back roads of America.  As he says, these are people you know, not from the headlines but from down the street and around the block.  Mr. Kuralt's journalistic style is old school, a very refreshing change from the flashy sensationalist BS we're now bombarded with at every turn.  He proves that there is news worth reporting that doesn't include horrific crimes and the latest bad behavior from so-called celebrities. I believe that even in the 21st Century there are people down the street and around the block who uplift their neighbors and communities and make the world a better place. Those are the stories and people I want to seek out.",1356825600,2,1025,4.6464088397790055

3819392,5,B001V7YZDO,"This show on the dvds has been a hit with our children (ages 12 through 8). They have completely been enchanted by the little vignettes about various places and people.

The story about Missouri and the Mark Twain Days has been completely captivating to our young children and has served as a jumping off point for reading Mark Twain stories and novels and learning more about his life. They have been fascinated to learn more about making molasses, different grades of Molasses and kite flying based on some of the shows on this set of dvds.

We have completely enjoyed watching this set over and over again and will probably continue to watch it again and again.",1311465600,,664,4.666666666666667

3819442,4,B001V7YZDO,"It was great watching a bunch of Charles Kuralt's ""On The Road"" segments again.  For those who are too young to remember, in the 1970s (and 1980s?) CBS news used to end one of their evening news shows with vignettes of America called ""On The Road with Charles Kuralt"".  For many of us that was the best part of the news.  We loved the stuff.  The material is still very good and not dated by a long shot.  Every segment will put a smile upon your face and make you feel good about America and it's basic strength and yes, goodness.

There is one issue I have with this set and that is how the ""episodes"" are organized.  Since these were part of a half hour news program each segment is only about five to ten minutes long.  However the DVD repeats the ""goodbye"" that used to end the segment.  Consequently after every five to ten minutes one has to view the same goodbye over and over again.  If one fast forwards to the next group then more often than not you miss the very first segment in that group.  This may be nitpicking but having the goodbye portion just once after the last segment would have been great and would save folks the annoyance of having to watch the same thing over and over again.  Also let the buyer be aware that the repeated goodbyes are included in the total run time of the DVDs.

But please don't let this quibble stop you from watching this series.  It is just plain great because of its simplicity, honesty and the joy of watching America and Americans go about life.",1264032000,8,1498,4.32258064516129
