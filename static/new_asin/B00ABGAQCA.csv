8549793,5,B00ABGAQCA,"I bought this PAL/region 2 set, produced by Acorn Media UK, before Acorn released their significantly cheaper US version in January 2015; now at twice the price, I doubt anyone will opt for this set.  This set has a 'play all' option and some bonus features;  only series 3 and 4 are subtitled.
As with other offerings from Lynda La Plante (Prime Suspect, Trial & Retribution, Widows and She's Out, Supply & Demand),  these stories are all excellent.  Others' comments and the product description give details.  However, the tarty dress and manner of the female lead seriously detract from her credibility -- unbuttoned blouses; too-tight, too-short skirts, stiletto heels and model poses belong more to Hollywood than to British crime scenes and investigations.  The gruff, craggy male lead is as expected and a few other familiar faces round out an otherwise good cast.",1439251200,,871,5.055944055944056
