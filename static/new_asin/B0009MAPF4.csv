8063140,3,B0009MAPF4,not the best Sesame Street video but the 2 yr old seems to enjoy it.  doesn't ask for it as often as other SS DVDs.,1368057600,,115,3.6
8063141,5,B0009MAPF4,"I think that I enjoy this as much as my kids do as some of the skits are taken from when I was a kid.  This timeless, fun, sing-along, DVD entertains and educates my 4YO son as much as my 2YO daughter.  I only wish it had a longer play time.",1315699200,2,241,3.7058823529411766
8063142,5,B0009MAPF4,"I highly recommend Play Along Games and Songs because it features the very popular Elmo while also introducing kids to Old School characters like Forgetful Jones. In addition to learning about shapes, numbers and memory, this special also teaches never giving up and supporting your friends. This is a Sesame Street DVD every parent should introduce to their child. :)",1181088000,5,368,5.15
