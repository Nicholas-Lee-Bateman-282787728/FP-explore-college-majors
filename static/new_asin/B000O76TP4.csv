2792626,5,B000O76TP4,Truly a cool anime. Would definitely recommend. A anime lovers haven for truly unbelievable fun and enjoyment. Thumbs up for this anime!,1403049600,,136,5.2272727272727275
2792627,5,B000O76TP4,"Classic and beautiful Chinese legend. This ancient and traditional tale goes to great extents to provide in depth coverage of how politics work as well as the relationship between the people and the government. Truly a wonderful tale that will keep you entertained. Full of magical creatures, beautiful art and fantastic animation. It is an entire journey of one particular girl and those she encounters along her way. Twelve Kingdoms one and two are an all time favorite. This series strays away from the common mecha, harem, comedy, and all around fun anime and dives deep into ancient folklore. There is plenty of action, mystery, magical creatures and fun loving characters. The series has a very serious tone to it and the creators establish well the world and all of its workings. The characters show excellent growth and development from the beginning to the end and you will have your favorites.",1366156800,,903,4.986754966887418
2792628,5,B000O76TP4,"I don't care what anyone says, the 12 kingdoms is everything I want from an anime. Well developed characters, fantasy, fight scenes, good plot twists, and hints of romance and comedy to keep it from being too dull and dramatic. Though the rest f the anime isn't as amazing as the first 13 episodes, I love it to no end.",1354838400,,319,4.333333333333333
2792629,3,B000O76TP4,"Ok, first of all I really love this show. Definitely one of the best anime shows ever. However I am very disappointed with the quality of the discs in this set (thats why only 3 stars instead of 5). I had to buy replacement discs for 2 of the DVDs in this set because they were defective. Each had what looked like a small indented/melted area on the back of the disc which caused at least one episode to be completely unplayable. On top of that there appears to be no way to contact the manufacturer to get replacement discs. I don't know if this is just an issue with the cheaper box set, or if I just have terrible luck.",1273881600,,623,4.1570247933884295
2792630,5,B000O76TP4,"It's really weird. When I first started watching this series, I thought I was stuck with a dud. But now that I'm done, I consider it one of my all-time favorites. I'm not sure at which point it won me over (probably when we met the sexy King of En), but it ended up being great. I only wish there were more since there were a few unanswered subjects.",1209427200,2,350,4.086956521739131
2792631,5,B000O76TP4,This is the absolute best anime I have ever seen. It is in depth and completely captivating. I love classics the that Studio Ghibli has produced but Studio Pierrot has out-done them and touched another area completely. I cannot agree more with the previous reviews they are absolutely correct. My only regret is that it ends so abruptly and all research I have done on when they will animate episodes 45-68 is when the author finishes the books. I have seen the titles of the upcoming books and they appear very promising. Strangely I am more drawn into the story of the Black Kirin than that of the main character Yoko. I cannot pull myself away from this series and have gone back to analyze and refamiliarize myself on different aspects numerous times. Bottom line: I am very picky about quality anime and hardly like anything I come across...this is an incredible series and I am extremely anxious to get the next 23 episodes to finish the series.,1201564800,7,951,4.666666666666667
2792632,5,B000O76TP4,"I agree wholeheartedly with the previous review.  Twelve Kingdoms has an excellent, well developed plot with interesting character development & beautiful artwork.  The story-line always kept me interested as opposed to so many of the other animes which almost put the viewer to sleep at times.  With 12 Kingdoms one stays on the edge of one's seat...& each new release is eagerly anticipated.  My only complaint is that the series was not completed...and with the same artist because I love the artwork in this series.",1198713600,,519,5.070588235294117
2792633,5,B000O76TP4,"12 Kingdoms is one of the fascinating anime ever-Great story, suspense and action. The main story is about Yoko who experiences a great transformation from a shy ideal high school girl to a poweful empress in another world. However, the end is a cliff-hanger since they didn't complete the anime. I hope they will finish it one day. This box set is very beautiful and well-organized. If you want to own 12 Kingdoms, this is the best box set for you.",1193356800,3,449,4.555555555555555

8183921,5,B000O76TP4,"How can one describe The Twelve Kingdoms? Well, you could say that it's ""Narnia set in China"" and it would more or less be true.

If I have to praise one thing about this anime is how intricate and believable its lore is. The amount of world-building is incredible, almost second to none in the realm of Japanese cartoons. People with nerdy tendencies to memorize all the intricacies and details of the Twelve Kingdoms' world will fall in love with it, and at the end of the day you only get to ""know"" well basically two and a half kingdoms!

In spite of being a DVD release the picture quality is very good. If you're starved for a good, fantasy adventure with great characters that strays from conventional anime tropes, then this is the show for you!",1466208000,,753,4.489051094890511
8183922,4,B000O76TP4,"This is a fantastic anime, and arrived quickly. Too bad the case was broken, and the dvds were floating free in the case.",1466035200,,121,4.304347826086956
