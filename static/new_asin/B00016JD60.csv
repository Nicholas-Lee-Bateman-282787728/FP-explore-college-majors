8007206,1,B00016JD60,"True Confessions, 1981 film

A car from around 1956 drives along a highway and stops at a church. The driver asks for Fr. Spellacy. ""I'm going to die."" [This happens to all, the good and the bad.] We see a marriage in a church earlier. Latin is spoken, the old rituals are in use. Two LA detectives visit a house that is not a home. A customer expired. He is a clergyman. The movie switches scenes. One rich contractor dances by himself. [Symbolism?] Later the police find the body of a woman with a rose tattoo dumped in an open field. She was cut in half. There is no blood there, the murder occurred elsewhere. Then there is another celebration. ""Vaya con Dios."" Mr. Amsterdam offered land for a parochial school. What is his background? Next we see the coroner doing an autopsy on that woman's body. An elder priest is pushed into retirement. Who will take over the Building Fund?

Detective Spellacy visits a restaurant. He talks to his brother and Mr. Amsterdam. Could Amsterdam have a secret past? [No! Things were different then, this would be too much of a career change.] The police check out places that sell sharp knives. The police watch a movie for clues. Who made that ""stag film""? They hear a woman scream and investigate. The scene shifts to a golf course and the locker room. A priest is reassigned to another parish. Lois wrote poems. The detective notices a telephone number in Lois' notebook. A reverse directory says the number was for Amsterdam. Sgt. Spellacy talks to the manager of that house; she is leaving town. She did a ""scrape"" and nicked her patient. She survived, she said.

There is a dinner to celebrate Jack Amsterdam, who helped build convents, schools, and churches. [Do you know why they were needed?] There is an undiplomatic conversation between Amsterdam and a man who is not as admirer (Sgt. Spellacy). He is working on the case of the ""Virgin Tramp"" (sounds like the title of a book). Dan talks to Fr. Spellacy about Lois. Fr. Spellacy is tired of ""fixing things"". Hostesses are picked up, one was in that film and tells about the location. The man in that film died the day after Lois died. Detectives go to that deserted building; they find bloodstains - the murder site. They find a handwritten note from ""Jack"". The police go to look at another body; she talked to ""Jack"" before turning on the gas in her room. A coughing man goes to Confession after twenty years. ""Go in peace."" Jack threatens Fr. Spellacy with a scandal. [Believable?] Sgt. Spellacy enters the confessional box next. He says Jack will be picked up and this will create a scandal. [Does this suggest envy and jealousy""] Fr. Spellacy is ready for his end. He talks to his brother, they visit a cemetery. ""This is it.""

I never read the novel by John Gregory Dunne. Was it better than this movie? It takes a good story to make a good movie, this doesn't have one. It tries to cover too many topics in one movie. There are better movies about 1940s LA than this one. The Defense Dept. spent 25% of its budget in Southern California, it enriched this area but deprived the northeast. Those who came to this area with their families needed housing, schools, churches, etc. and other construction. Erle Stanley Gardner wrote a novel that warned against the Beauty Contest rackets. A business would hold a local beauty contest, the winner would be used in business promotions, then given a one-way ticket to Hollywood. But without acting experience or talent and contacts she would wind up as an exploited worker in one of the various service businesses in the Los Angeles area.",1449878400,,3587,4.644094488188976
