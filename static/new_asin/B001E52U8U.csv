8296385,4,B001E52U8U,"Informative episode on the Hiss case. May want to do some research and reading beforehand, as (predictably) the conversation gets complex.

Also, I can't tell if Athan Theoharris is simply poor at presenting his argument or just spewing sophistry.",1428796800,,247,5.333333333333333
8296386,4,B001E52U8U,The guests were polite and intelligent. They had a good debate. I thought the sound quality could have been better.,1390348800,,115,4.8
8296387,5,B001E52U8U,The esteemed professor Theoharis could only babble incoherently about FBI filng systems when confronted with the exhaustive research of author Weinstein.  Obviously his mission (self-directed or otherwise) was to get the conversation bogged down with minutiae and thereby lessen the clarity of Weinstein's conclusion that Hiss was guilty.  At long last Buckley shut the pedantic professor down.  The show is an entertaining example of lefty attempts at obfuscation.,1389139200,2,465,5.8088235294117645
8296388,5,B001E52U8U,"What's amazing is how completely and finally the defenders of Hiss would be destroyed by the release of the ""Venona"" intercepts. That Hiss was guilty was proved beyond all doubt and that McCarthy in his ""Witchhunt"" ultimately vindicated.",1386806400,,237,5.2631578947368425
8296389,4,B001E52U8U,"So happy to see the ""Firing Line"" series available to stream. Truly miss Mr. Buckley. He of all journalists left us wanting more. I had to pause this particular episode to review the history of Alger Hiss and Chambers.  Buckley always had the most interesting guests and topics. He also knew enough to pose the questions and then sit back and let his guests respond. The history behind this topic is so intriguing that it makes you want to learn more about McCarthy.  This show is worth viewing more than once.",1379030400,,510,4.593406593406593
8296390,5,B001E52U8U,The wonderfully named Alger Hiss and the conservative Icon Whittaker Chambers locked in battle at a key moment of the Cold War and Chamber's Witness helped turned the tide of opinion in favor of resisting and then defeating Soviet Communism.  It is one of the most critical battles of the Cold War and yet few of us can remember it and fewer still of my generation or younger know much about it.  This program is a great primer into that great historical event will inform of the fact that Alger Hiss and his friends were spies for the Soviet Union and did great damage in to the US in the name of communism.  If you do not know much about this event you owe to yourself and to America to learn about it this great battle of the Cold War and how it was nearly loss but for the brave and often times lonely witness of Whittaker Chambers.,1372291200,,836,4.2784810126582276
8296391,5,B001E52U8U,"Progressive, Liberal, Communist icon was thoroughly demolished by Allen Weinstein who served as Archivist of the United States and who began his research thinking Hiss was not guilty.  Three cheers for honest scholarship!",1366588800,,221,5.696969696969697
8296392,5,B001E52U8U,"It is widely understood among all political persuasions that the progressives (advocates of Marxist economics and political methods) have captured the United States university system. The progressive point-of-view has become the only permitted political position allowed in universities. Truth as a concept never had standing with Lenin, Stalin, or Mao. Absolute values and mores were not permitted. Nor was dissent. Not surprisingly, with the universities promoting such thinking, we see the primacy of postmodern philosophy. Understanding this is fundamental to understanding the reviewed video, and its setting.

The Marxist takeover of the curriculum of the US school system from the bottom to the top was engineered early in the last century. One need not look far to see the overwhelming evidence that America's schools are now the fiefdoms of Marxist apparatchiks, whose behavior differs little from the USSR's ruling class in the 1980's. The destruction of the US school system is undeniable on a purely factual basis, comparing results worldwide. We are producing functional illiterates--they can't even read.

After the US had won WWII, long-planted Soviet spies in important US government posts strove to hand the weakened Balkans to Stalin's Russia and all of China to Mao's party. They succeeded and we had the debilitating Cold War until the collapse of the USSR in the early 1990's. The story of these planted Soviet agents was exposed by Sen. McCarthy and the HUAC. One key exposed agent was Alger Hiss. A key witness against Hiss was Whitaker Chambers, himself a Soviet double-agent who repented. The other closet Marxists, the progressives, howled that Hiss was falsely accused and wrongly convicted. The full story is well chronicled in Chamber's book: Witness -- which is available on Amazon and should be U.S. High School required reading. The video from W.F. Buckley's Firing Line TV show deals with pinning down the circular arguments of a die-hard Hiss defender.",1366243200,,1986,5.34185303514377
8296393,5,B001E52U8U,"It is so nice to have these finally come out on DVD.  Thank you Stanford!  This is a particularly good episode in which an academic/political fraud is revealed and proved.  Compare ""Firing Line"" to ANY talk show on the air today and you'll see why it was so revered.  THANK YOU WHOEVER WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR BRINGING THESE DVD'S TO MARKET!  And thank you Amazon for carrying them.",1229472000,12,378,4.582089552238806
