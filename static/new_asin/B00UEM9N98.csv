7036566,5,B00UEM9N98,"I don't know the first thing about hockey but this was one of the best films I've ever seen--  a brilliantly laid out human story, surrounded by a shattering political milieu.  You get a keen sense both of the sweep of history and the very personal pain of these players during the last decades of the 20th century and early 21st.  Everything about it, including gorgeous graphics, great music, and an exciting pace make me very curious about young director Gabe Polsky's future projects.  You'll be moved and entertained but your world will be significantly wider for watching this.",1432771200,5,583,4.858585858585859
7036567,5,B00UEM9N98,This is an incredibly told story. Whether you like hockey or not you will be mesmerized.,1432684800,,88,4.5625
7036568,5,B00UEM9N98,"I saw this movie after a friend recommended it - It was a great movie, and I will definitely buy this DVD when it comes out - I would even dare say it might be one of the best hockey movies ever made - Highly recommended! Especially the insight into Russian culture (and politics)... Enjoy!",1431561600,,290,4.290909090909091
7036569,5,B00UEM9N98,"Absolutely delightful. This is by far one of the best documentaries I ever saw. Holds you in grip all ~80 mins running time. It is cut excellently. Besides tons of rare Soviet footage (priceless; I wonder how did Gabe Polsky ever get all this licensed? :)) ) and focus on telling the story through interviews, it sometimes looks like a thriller. Plus good old drama moments, but surprisingly a lot of humor as well. Before going to see the movie I read the reviews in press to get a glimpse of what to expect, but still was amazed by how good it is. There was well-deserved round of applause after the screening from the audience in the theater. I, too, hope that word of mouth would bring more people to see it. Indeed, you don't have to be hockey fan. It's a movie as well about history, differences in culture, personal stories of the people, and much more. I can't help but buying DVD when released - at least to get a thorough look at all the unique footage. Highly recommended!",1431561600,8,983,4.43646408839779
7036570,5,B00UEM9N98,Amazing insight to the lives of these athletes. Fetisov did a great job at telling his story. A must see for all fans of hockey.,1431043200,4,128,4.16
7036571,4,B00UEM9N98,"""Red Army"" (2015 release; 78 min.) is a documentary about they heydays of the Soviet national hockey team (nicknamed the ""Red Army"") of the 1980s. As the documentary opens, we are introduce to Slava Fetisov, the poster child of that hockey team during that time. After some quick introductions to the tensions and rivalry between the US and the USSR in the cold war-era, we quickly get down to business and are told the story in a pretty straight-forward manner but which showcases again that at times facts are stranger than fiction. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first and foremost, this is NOT a documentary about the ""Miracle on Ice"" 1980 Olympic game between the US and the Soviet Union (it is deal with in a matter of a few minutes in the documentary), so if you're expecting major attention to the Miracle On Ice, you are bound to be disappointed. Indeed, the beauty of this documentary is that the focus is almost entirely on the Soviet hockey players, as the documentary advances based on their own retelling of the events. Second, you may wonder whether this documentary is worth watching if at best you are a casual hockey fan, no worries. I am at best a casual hockey fan myself, but the documentary is so much more than about hockey: it's about the state of the USSR in the 70s and 80s, it's about people living within that system, it's about the prison-like conditions in which these celebrated hockey stars/national heroes lived day in, day out (they lived away from home in ""hockey camps"", which truly were like prisons, 11 out of 12 months of the year, just mind-blowing), etc. In short: this is a HUMAN story/documentary, not a SPORTS story/documentary. Kudos to writer-director Gabe Polsky for his laser-sharp focus on the Soviet characters, all along while displaying a nice sense of humor and tongue firmly planted in cheek. The amount of propaganda for the hockey team in the Soviet media was unparalleled. At one point, we see a group of younger/junior hockey players sing a song on Soviet TV, where they deliver the lines ""Real men play hockey/Cowards don't play hockey"" without any sarcasm. Just priceless. The last part of the documentary deals with the possible approval by the Soviet politburo to allow these player to go to the NHL. Fetisov's tale will have you shaking your head... Last but not least, I noticed that Werner Herzog is credited as an Executive Producer of this documentary. I am a big fan of his non-fiction films, and he rarely is off the mark. As soon as I saw his name in the opening credits, I was quite certain that I'd be in for a good time. And I was.

""Red Army"" opened in late February without much pre-release fanfare or advertising at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and I'm happy to report that the evening screening I saw this at a few days ago was surprisingly well attended, given that it was a weeknight. Hopefully the positive word of mouth will carry this ""little documentary that could"" to a wider audience. Bottom line: ""Red Army"" is a delightful documentary that will entertain and amaze you from start to finish. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1430179200,18,3218,4.714031971580817

7036575,3,B00UEM9N98,"About male youths in the former Soviet Union who were indoctrinated into hockey for their country. When their squad looses the 1980 Olympics to a group of college players a new (mean) mean coach is brought in and they LIVE as hockey players--hockey only!

They win the 1984  and 1988 Olympics then one player is told he can leave, then he is told he can not. he essentially retires and is given the cold shoulder. Meanwhile, another player defects and then it becomes a mess with U.S.S.R. saying they will allows players to leave but they have to pay a percent of their contract to the government. Some people in North America question to value of the players as their play is different than NHL play.

When the Soviet Union collapses the players are finally free to leave. Detroit is able to obtain five players for their team and they play together like they did in the old days and win a championship.

Insightful but depressing to see the drama they had to endure, sick treatment of citizens. Some do return in an effort to help their country.",1513814400,,1047,4.553191489361702

7036577,5,B00UEM9N98,"A fascinating history of the background of the shocking success of the SOviet hockey team over the best of the NHL in the early seventies. Very moving - a deep story of loyalty, team-building, sheer genius coaching and playing, cold-war politics and the difficult decisions made by individual players in a complex political situation where sport is a proxy for national rivalries. ALso a window into the current Russian national rebuilding process through the example of Mr. Fetisov - a truly great man.

HIghly recommended. Be sure to watch the extras, including the interview with the director - a real hockey fan who made this film in a labor of love, an homage to the greatest hockey players of their time.",1507420800,3,710,4.867768595041323

7036579,5,B00UEM9N98,"This is ultimately the merging of two of my favorite subjects: political science and hockey. Although he played against my country and my favorite team, I have developed a great admiration for Fetisov and the hardships he went through. As the film said, most of the time the soviets are characterized  as the villains of the story--but he along with the other players were victims of the system. He was humanized through this film, as were his teammates such as Tretiak. So if you are a fan of hockey and history I would recommend this film.",1504569600,,541,4.635416666666667

7036618,5,B00UEM9N98,This is a masterful documentary. What makes it impressive is the use of so much footage of actual hockey time. You get nearly all of the competing perspectives packed into one bag and I appreciated the interviewers courage for asking the tough questions and expecting insightful answers. This felt like a journey and I can truly see the brilliance of the team's ice play as well as the politics and regime that affected their lives greatly.

Would highly recommend this movie to any hockey lover, especially those who enjoy learning about the style of hockey that was played. Interesting concept Fetisov gives at the end when asked by the producer if he missed his team/country. For those who cannot understand Fetisov and many of the Russian players attitudes againast the Americans, it was not for what happened in Lake Placid, it was for the constant abuse they endured during their early years of playing in North America.",1457913600,,606,4.950980392156863

7036655,4,B00UEM9N98,"During the Cold War the Soviet Union took sport very seriously and ice hockey was a particular favourite. This film sets out to tell the story of the most successful five men produced by the Soviet system and they were all Red Army soldiers.

It has interviews with the players as they are now including Fetisov who was one of the most driven of the men. It also uses archive footage from the era and uses the history of the time to contextualise what the men were going through. Some of the best bits were the Russians in action  they played with such grace and pose that it is a joy to watch  and I am not a sports fan in the least.

The politics on and off the ice are covered too and there are more than a few tough memories brought to the surface. It is mainly in English but there is some Russian that is mostly translated. This is just a fascinating documentary about a little piece of history that I was totally unaware of  highly recommended indeed.",1455926400,,958,4.2707182320441985

Unlike their North American counterparts, apparently the government underwrote the expenses of their training by making them members of the Army.

Gabe Polsky, director and writer, is the son of Jewish immigrants from Ukraine, a part of the USSR when they left. Gabe himself had an interest in hockey as a youngster. His interest in shooting this documentary is a natural, with insider knowledge. His parents made a fortune after arriving in the U.S. with $500, according to news stories. His father is in the dubious industry of wind turbines, a rip-off of the American taxpayer, who know little to nothing about the science, along with their clueless, bought-and-paid-for politicians.

Getting USSR hockey great Slava Fetisov to cooperate was a major coup. Fetisov lived in North America a number of years, so he speaks in English, a bonus. There is nothing in the film about Fetisov deliberately striking opponents near their eyes with his hockey stick, causing serious injuries, which was called to the nation's attention by sportscaster Don Cherry. He was suspended a couple of times for these. A request for Fetisov to explain himself would have been a plus. Nor is there anything about the limousine accident in Birmingham, MI, in which Fetisov was a passenger. It ended the career of his teammate Vladimir Konstantinov, who was severely brain damaged, as was another passenger, the team masseur.

The film ends with Fetisov back in Russia, happy to be home, a high ranking political official and a friend of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

7036708,4,B00UEM9N98,"I play recreational ""beer league"" hockey once a week.  I was hoping to see more clips of the amazing Red Army hockey team playing.  The clips that are in the movie are truly impressive.  But the movie is really the story of the politics... the expression of Soviet power through athletics and how the players (in particular Federov) suffered, dealt with the system, and in some cases achieved sorts of personal triumph.  Overall, well worth watching. But there is less actual play footage than you might expect from the trailers.  A must for anyone interested in hockey or cold war politics.

One thing that I did pick up was that when the US NHL teams started finally picking up the Soviet hockey stars, those players did not do well because they were used to a completely different system of passing and play.  It wasn't until Detroit wisely got a full offensive line of 3 ex-Soviet players  that they were able to work their hockey magic together and win a Stanley Cup.  It kind of supports the ""Miracle"" coaching theme of adopting an entire system of play.",1441324800,2,1060,4.655913978494624

7036723,5,B00UEM9N98,"You don't have to be a sports fan to appreciate this documentary.  What Gabe Polsky's film does well is create a view if not a whole picture of the importance of hockey in Cold War era USSR through the eyes of one of the most iconic players of the time, Slava Fetisov.  Having a focus certainly helps the narrative because it seems like, at just about any time, it could go completely off topic, but somehow just manages to stay on track.  Fetisov is a polarizing figure.  He talks about his early playing days with a fondness that gets tempered by the realities of a tyrannical coach and eventually his desire to play in the NHL only to come back to the more or less here as a brusque politician in charge of sport for a whole nation.  One of the real points of interest is the all too short bit about the Soviet side of the Miracle on Ice but the effects through the rest of the film are all the more astounding.  This is a slice of life deal, but a well done one that harkens back to the Soviet propaganda machine with just the right critical eye.  A compelling story that unfolds like the game the Russian Five played - you never quite know where the play is going to go, but more like than not, there's a goal at the end.",1440460800,,1226,4.191489361702128

Sure you have some history,  but what you don't have is the most covenant trophy in all of sports,  the purness of the game and the political aspects of how the game has changed the world.

7036773,4,B00UEM9N98,"This is a wonderful documentary about the Soviet Union's Red Army hockey team, generally considered the best in the world during the period of the Cold War.  Written and directed by Gabe Polsky, the film focuses on perhaps the team's biggest star, Slava Fetisov.  He's about the only Russian interviewee who has a handle on English, if spoken haltingly.  He's also pretty funny when he wants to be.

In the opening scene, we hear Polsky asking him questions but Slava maintains his focus on his smart phone.  He just stares at it.  Polsky says something to the effect of ""can we get back to the interview"" and Fetisov says to wait, eventually giving him the finger and laughing.  He and his ""Russian Five"" were the stars of world hockey during the period, never losing, even to the NHL's best teams.  Much time is spent recalling the brutal training the players endured, some from the time they were in grade school.  It is clear that the players were patriotic and for country and all but essentially had no personal life.  They were essentially required to remain at the training camp, ignoring wives, children and even dying parents.

Things started to become unhinged to some extent, when the American team, consisting mostly of college players, upset the Russians in the semi-finals of the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid.  I was surprised that we never get into the personal recollections of any of the players interviewed.  Polsky does ask Fetisov what his memories of the event are, but he never answers.  A close up shows his eyes welling up.  Obviously he can't talk about it.  So anyone else?  Guess not.

The Russians reorganized and got back to work, but when Gorbachev came into power, he instituted policies of glasnost (""openness"") and perestroika (""restructuring"") which brought down the Belin Wall and broke up the Soviet Union.  In turn, people were give more freedom.  This included several Russian hockey stars going to the NHL in North America.  The style of play was much different in the NHL.  More roughhousing, less hockey finesse that the Russians were used to.

Even if you aren't a hockey fan or even a sports fan, there are enough parables in the film to the Cold War that it is well worth seeing.  Recommended.",1438041600,2,2245,4.786458333333333

You get to see how these men grew up what it was like growing up in the soviet union, there training practices, coaching the pressure of having to win all the time and the unfair and sometimes inhumane practices that the political side of the soviet union put on these players.  Also discussed is when the Soviet Union fell and Russian players were allowed into the NHL.  The one negative I have is this video is being conducted by an American, and has alot of American questions.  The USA had very little influence in hockey especially the 70s and 80s when the Red Army team was at it's strongest.  Americas one big win at the 1980 Olympics is talked about but the games against Canada the 1972 Summit Series, The various Canada Cups,  were not even discussed.  These were one of the few tournaments the Soviets lost, except for the 81 Canada Cup, and after that tournament the Soviets trophy was taken away and then Canadian fans paid to have a replica made for the Soviet team, that would be something interesting thing to ask about but it is not.

More on Mr. Krutov's difficult post-Red Army career and early death would have been interesting.",1434153600,,286,5.195652173913044

My wife has never watched a hockey game and has never had any interest in it, yet she thought every minute of this film was fascinating. If you're a hockey fan, this is a must-see.

8705520,4,B00UEM9N98,Bought this dvd to get a better look inside the success of the Soviet Unions hockey teams. Had some nice footage of some of their training regimens and mental psyche. They were the best because they paid a huge price to be the best. Was very interesting especially if you are a hockey fan.,1523836800,,289,4.37037037037037

8705522,5,B00UEM9N98,"A fascinating look into the history of Soviet ice hockey. They achieved as close to perfection as a group of humans can, I think. Just astounding. Kudos to the interviewer for keeping his patience with a few of the Soviet players.

The price of the DVD is worth it just for 20 seconds. The reaction of Fetisov when he saw the 1980 Olympics replayed when the Reds lost to the United States was PRICELESS!!!",1519862400,,405,4.472972972972973
