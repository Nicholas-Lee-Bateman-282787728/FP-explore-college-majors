For those who are browsing and wondering what this is about well, Pick it up and you won't be sorry! R&R comedy all the way from Brooklyn, NY baby! Pick up season 1 and all 3 of the cd's as well. You won't be sorry!!!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Z-Rock-Season-2/dp/B0038RSIFG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Z-Rock: Season 2</a>",1279152000,,455,5.909090909090909
4092197,5,B0038RSIFG,"Season two was even better than the first season! With such guests as Joan Rivers, Chris Jericho, Darryl Hall, Steel Panthere and so many more, this show just gets better and better. Absolutely hilarious that every episode will have you nearly choking laughing. And the amazing performances of Lynn Koplitz and Big Jay Oakerson are not to be missed. But of course the best part of this show is the real life band of ZO2, Paulie Z, David Z, and Joey Cassata. They are like old pros at the acting game here and are guaranteed to impress. But the music is what hooks you and reels you in. If you love Z Rock, go buy their albums Tuesdays and Thursdays, Ain't It Beautiful and the newest release Casino Logic. Not to mention hopefully you already have Season one of Z Rock. Great true rock music, a killer cast, great guest stars, and a ton of laughs. What more can someone ask for? Oh yeah, hopefully a Season 3!!",1277164800,,910,4.4226190476190474
4092198,5,B0038RSIFG,"I finally got my copy of season 2 and it doesn't disappoint.  The guyz are practically seasoned pros now in the acting department.  The guest appearances are even better than the first season.  You gotta love Joan Rivers, Lynne Koplitz and Jay Oakerson reprising their roles from season 1.  I hope there is a season 3 because I want more!  The songs are almost a tease because we only get snippets of them but lucky me I have the band's CDs so I can hear them longer then what we hear in the show.

If you like This Is Spinal Tap and Curb Your Enthusiasm you'll love this show.  Buy it!  You will laugh yourself silly.",1276819200,,618,4.267241379310345
4092199,5,B0038RSIFG,"Obviously from the date of this review, I haven't bought the dvd yet, because it hasn't yet been released, so I am basing this review solely on the actual aired episodes of Zrock season 2. The episodes alone are worth the price of the dvd, never mind the extra features that are sure to be included.

Can I just say, that I love this show?  Like the first season, this season was hysterically funny and cool.  The stars of this series (real life bandmates of the band ZO2) Paulie Z, David Z and Joey Cassata who share a great chemistry along with a long list of guest stars bring this series to life.  The humor is raunchy and fun and Lynne Koplitz as band manager Dina and Jay Oakerson as club owner Neil definitely share their own brand of crude humor.  Not for kids, Zrock gives the adults a full 30 minutes of hilarious entertainment.  Sprinkled throughout is some of the band's actual music.  If I had to change anything, it would be that more of ZO2's music would be showcased.  Check out ZO2's cds, Tuesdays and Thursdays, Ain't It Beautiful and Casino Logic, all available here on amazon.  And cross your fingers for a season 3 of Z rock.",1271376000,2,1146,4.419047619047619

8391724,5,B0038RSIFG,"This is a funny, realistic group of episodes about the rock band ZO2.  Love the music and interactions of the boys with each other.  The guest appearances of major stars is an added bonus.  I have Season 1 and this second video Season 2 is a must have if you wants more laughs from Paulie, Joey, and David.",1392076800,,306,4.241379310344827

8391727,5,B0038RSIFG,"My wife and I watched this show when it was on IFC and loved it. But of course, as with most sharply written, funny shows, it was cancelled (half way through the 2nd season no less). So a friend of mine one day mentioned Steel Panther, and I recalled that they appeared in one of the Z Rock episodes. Made me want to watch them again, so I ordered both seasons. Watched them straight through on a marathon Sunday and laughed my butt off all over again. Really funny and at times a little vulgar, but it made me yearn for more episodes.",1334793600,,535,4.203883495145631
8391728,5,B0038RSIFG,"I was a fan of season 1 but was a little cautious about this season . When i read the description of this season i didn't think it would measure up to the first season . Was i ever wrong ! I have been lucky enough to have seen ZO2 live several times , and they are truly down to earth & a riot to hang out with . Once things got rolling this made me laugh out loud several times each episode . My favorite is the one where they go to Neil's hometown . Joey's conversation with the father just killed me ! Very good stuff . Just as good if not funnier than season 1 at times .",1317945600,,575,3.760330578512397
