8668495,5,B00LW8APIQ,"CESARE MORI THE IRON PREFECT is a true story about an Italian policeman who took on the scourge of the Mafia. This recent mini-series from Italy is one of the latest acquisitions for distribution in North America by MHz International Mystery, a company that is fast making its name by making such quality European programming available.

Running approximately 200 minutes, the series attempts an epic scale in the telling of its tale which only partly succeeds, but when it does succeed, it really succeeds! Much of the credit for this goes to Swiss actor Vincent Perez in the title role. Perez is a distinguished, theatre trained actor whose impressive film credits include Queen Margot, with Isabelle Adjani and Cyrano de Bergerac, with Gerard Depardieu. In other words, Perez knows his way around period pieces and lends a special bearing that makes him wholly believable in such roles.

Without Perez' presence the series might've been strictly B material but once again the validity of star power proves what a difference it can make. When a star as photogenic, as grounded as Perez is front and centre, the hub of the dramatic wheel is firmly established. Everything revolves around him and keeps things in perspective. Thus, when moments in part one almost threaten to slide into pseudo-Spaghetti Western territory, particularly with the Morricone-like guitar riffs of composer Pino Donaggio on the soundtrack, Perez brings the story and the style back to where it ought to be. And Mori's story is important, historically, as is anyone's who has stood up to corruption and violence.

This is not to say the real Mori was a saint, but the occasional softening of his ""iron fist"" approach is acceptable in telling his story, if only to remind the viewer that he is the good guy here and not the iconoclastic Clint Eastwood character of the Dollar films, for example.

There are some wonderful moments of inspired artistry throughout. The most vivid example that comes to mind is when Mori and his wife adopt a young orphan boy. Unable to have children of their own, little Saro brings a great deal of comfort to Mori's wife, Angelina. In one poignant scene, Saro has a nightmare. Angelina comes to him and props him up on the bed with her. Their positioning almost resembles a birthing position and is a moment of real beauty in a story that is mostly violent.

The shared stars of the series, along with Perez, are the wonderful Italian locations and the costuming. There isn't a false note anywhere to be discerned. Even when occasional lapses in direction keep CESARE MORI THE IRON PREFECT from being a masterpiece, the series manages to convince and convey its setting and importance realistically.

Admittedly not as polished cinematically as some of the outstanding European programming MHz is offering, CESARE MORI still manages to stand on its own as an important addition to their ever-growing library of entertaining alternative television.",1408752000,9,2955,4.995934959349594
