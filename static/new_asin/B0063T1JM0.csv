4948473,4,B0063T1JM0,"With Rhys Darby and Sally Hawkins in a somewhat subdued romantic comedy/dramady taking place in Middle Earth, how can one lose?

Rhys Darby loses his love- she walks out, a wounded duck crashes in.  He seeks help from a reluctant Sally Hawkins.  Will love bloom and conquer all?  Of course, enjoy the ride and the obligatory bumps in the romance and happy ending- well, perhaps, happy.  Stay tuned.

We loved Sally Hawkins in Happy-Go-Lucky and, even more so, in the zany, romantic comedy, Happy Ever Afters.  Here, she is much more reserved and cautious, but still charming, funny and vulnerable.  Just don't expect the intensity of those other flicks.  This is a gentler story with some silly duck antics filmed in a beautiful country with Queen music to pick it up now and then.

Nice change of pace.",1358208000,,803,4.753623188405797

4948476,5,B0063T1JM0,I really enjoyed this movie. I love the fact that it was without bad language or inapporpiate scenes. The storyline was interesting and although somewhat predictable it was cute and sassy. I love the accent.,1351728000,,207,4.942857142857143
4948477,4,B0063T1JM0,"When I saw this trailer I knew this movie would be one I would thoroughly enjoy.  As a professional Pet Sitter & Dog Walker (not to mention animal lover of all kinds) ~ I hunt out movies like this one, but this time I happen to stumble across it.  I usually don't like romance movies that are overly sweet ... this one toed the line a bit, but the sweet bits with the duck won me over.  I highly recommend this cute flick!
I must confess that one of the best parts is not only Sally Hawkins but the Queen song that all the actors & actresses sang to at the end - as the characters they played in the movie ~ Loved it!",1347321600,2,617,3.9596774193548385

She has that rare ability to always be herself & yet have something new to show off her wonderful talents. I wish this film had been longer to develop more fully the ending ( especially since there would have been more of her to watch ) it's still a great romantic comedy. And of course, the most important thing is, the guy gets the girl in the end plus the girl is Sally Hawkins. Lucky bastard........",1343347200,,495,4.221052631578948

4948485,5,B0063T1JM0,"Sweet, funny comedy around the parallel stories of an injured duck (Pierre) and the man who is led to become his friend (Doug), and an injured man and the duck who is led to become his friend. Based in Auckland New Zealand, this is a rom-com that escapes the usual storylines of rom-coms with the story of the duck being as featured as the story of Doug. If you love animals, this is a 5 star movie; however, if I did not love animals, I'd probably give it 4 stars.",1523059200,,465,4.177777777777778

4948493,1,B0063T1JM0,"I loved Rhys Darby in ""What We Do in the Shadows"" and ""Flight of the Concords"" and of course Sally Hawkins is one of the best actors out there, but even they could not save this bland, meandering movie. The two most common character traits are ""dull"" and ""unlikable"". The characters who don't display those traits are simply underwritten. Darby's character, Doug, works on a four man construction crew and the other three guys' basically are ""The Sikh Guy"", ""The Maori Guy"", and the ""Young Horny Guy"". That's it, no other character development. Bryan Brown and Hawkins are totally wasted in their roles. All the other characters are simply useless, especially the roles of Doug's riches to rags best friend and his former girlfriend. It's too bad, I watched this all the way through, hoping it would improve and it never did.

The duck was okay.",1521072000,2,845,4.787671232876712

I enjoy the storyline of, ""I was enjoying my simple life and then I'm told it's boring.  How can I recover?"".  I enjoyed the recovery.  I agree with a few other reviews that mention being in New Zealand, the end of the world by a meteor spin, and the party of all the actors at the end all adding to the fun.

4948501,4,B0063T1JM0,"Don't be put off by the title or the cover image, Love Birds isn't really a romantic comedy chick flick as both imply.  It's really a comedy about an average guy and his love for a feathered companion, that landed in his responsibility.  Doug (Rhys Darby) is content with his Auckland council maintenance job, and living in his deceased parents house.  He's just been dumped by his superficial girlfriend who wanted him to change and aim for more wealth and prestige.  He's depressed about this and reluctant to get out of bed the next morning but a stray dog keeps barking outside his front door.  He chases the dog off then notices what it was barking at.  A paradise shelduck is injured and on the gutter of his roof. He is not a wildlife expert, or possesses any knowledge in the area of what to do with the bird, (he thinks it's a duck for one) but does care about its welfare.  The movie for the most part is his trying to do the right thing by the bird, but encountering many obstacles from general society when carrying a duck around everywhere on the way.  One of those obstacles is Holly (Sally Hawkins) a bird keeper at the Auckland Zoo who he takes the bird to in hopes of a new home, she basically tells him to get lost, the bird is not her problem.  But he still carrying the duck everywhere he goes, keeps coming back for various reasons, and her colleague keeps pointing out he's a cute guy, she's single and not getting any younger.

It's a pretty fun movie, it only doesn't make five stars for me because the ending didn't seem complete, and the fact that neither Doug's ex, or Holly were particularly likable characters.  Spoilers - I mean Holly acts like she's just found out he has a number of corpses buried in his backyard, when all he did was agree to have dinner with his ex, since as he'd already told Holly he didn't understand why she had broken up with him.  He'd been trying to get somewhere with Holly for ages (not to mention putting up with the behaviour of her son) and she wasn't committing to anything but hanging out so she can't act like he's cheating on her or anything simply by having dinner with his ex, even if Holly (and he) thought there might be something there to rekindle, and even then didn't just go out and meet up with his ex, but told Holly he was going to.  She could have, at that time said well instead of doing that, why don't we take our friendship to the relationship level, why not call her back and tell her to bring someone as a double date so you can talk about why she dumped you. Having worked in the captive wildlife industry, I also found Holly's attitude towards the injured paradise shelduck before she became friends with Doug to be completely unrealistic.  People who work in that industry tend to care about the welfare of animals, not just the ones they are being paid to look after.

Still it's a really fun New Zealand movie.  Also has a lot of Queen songs as the soundtrack, the cast all (both major and minor characters) mime to one of their songs during the closing credits. It's a lot of fun.",1516406400,,3071,4.380281690140845

She lived by a lake in Florida and took it walking to it until the duck never came back home to my sister lol.

4948510,4,B0063T1JM0,"I usually don't go out for romantic chick flicks, but, ""Love Birds"" is a real hoot! Set in far away exotic New Zealand this movie grabbed me from the first second. Yes, it's a boy is left by girl, boy finds duck, boy meets new girl, boy and new girl finally fall-in-love, romp. From Pierre the Duck (aptly played by Trey and Arnie the wonder fouls) to the ""Shagg'n Wagon"" this flick has it all: confused (almost dopey) leading man, a host of his funny mates, a cute (yet plausible) romance, loads of laughs, a quacky duck side-kick, and interesting glimpses of Auckland. And Freddie Mercury's and Gin's music sweep the screenplay off it's feet into stellar portents! (The music alone is worth a watch.) Darby and Smythe have real on-screen chemistry. This flick made me laugh and want to hangout down-under with a duck! It's a great date-night movie. If you like romances with a fun twists, and quirky kiwi humor (be sure to watch the closing credits where the cast gives new meaning to Queen's ""We Are the Princes""!), then try out this fun flick.",1411171200,,1047,4.60427807486631

It is set in New Zealand and Rhys Darby does a great job of being a sensitive bloke who anyone would love, except his current girlfriend. He has alot of talent and was the main reason I watched the movie all the way to the end. But I can't say I would buy it or watch it a 2nd time.",1405296000,,472,3.9789473684210526
