8176912,5,B000NDEWSA,"Out of all the cheerleading video's that I ordered, all the cheerleaders perferred this one the most.  Great video especially for starters.",1310947200,,139,5.318181818181818
8176913,3,B000NDEWSA,"I wasn't able to see the back of this DVD before I bought it, but it's okay I will keep it. This entire DVD is on youtube in sections by categories, and the dance routine is on 5min.com I used the routine last year for my tackle cheer squad's end of season performance. Stretches and motions are very helpful though it is a good beginner DVD but why buy it when you can see it for free??? lol",1244073600,4,392,4.038461538461538
8176914,5,B000NDEWSA,"even though this item was not a original dvd
it still played very well
i enjoyed the material on it",1238371200,,99,4.0
8176915,3,B000NDEWSA,"You get 2 jumps, 1 chant, 1 cheer and 1 dance. I was hoping for more but I do have to admit that I like the Motions drills they had. The dance is long, 8-8counts and the moves are good. All in all it's a good DVD, I just wish it had more material in it.",1179187200,12,253,3.5357142857142856
