8663858,5,B00L5MFG8S,"After BabyMetal and Wagakki Band, Doll$Boxx is the best Japanese band I have discovered.  All three are very different but just as awesome at what they do.  Dolls Collection contains nine videos of the songs from the CD Dolls Apartment, a short documentary, and part of a Doll$Box concert. The women are excellent musicians and all can sing, but Fuki has an amazing voice.  The standout video in this collection is Take My
Chance, a performance just as shocking, surprising, and satisfying as BabyMetal's Gimme Chocolate!",1489622400,,521,5.034883720930233
