8154558,5,B000K7BS40,"This project held by Patrick K. Freer, music educator, shows practical and fun ways to start a chorus for adolescents. He plays games and has children move and approach music in non-threatening ways. Everyone is a part of the group regardless of how talented, untalented, skilled, or unskilled they may be in singing. Easy to watch and quite intersting.",1376092800,,353,5.0
8154559,1,B000K7BS40,"Too long, boring and uneffective. Dr Freer talks too much and shows no results. He achieves no  choral sound with a group of talented kids. I purchased it in order to enrich my research on adolescent voices and had to return it. I strongly discourage any choral conductor or music educator to use this approach to choral music.",1372636800,,327,4.637931034482759
