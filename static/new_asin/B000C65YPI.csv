2453848,3,B000C65YPI,"Another mutated, inbred, mountain ""family"" who like to chop up and eat stupid college hiker kids who just insist on getting lost in the woods in the dark.  Jenna had a funny scene when she gets caught and is being cut up by one of the mutant mountain men and he reaches into her chest and pulls out a silicone boob enlargement sack, which he sniffs and tosses into a pile of bones.  Hilarious! Other than that this one is pretty forgetable, rent Devils Rejects for a real mutant inbred treat.",1170201600,,492,4.395604395604396
2453849,1,B000C65YPI,"If the uncut version ever gets out I'll definitely check it out because this released version had a lot of potential, but was a real disappointment. The ending made no sense and so much seems to be edited out at the end that many scenes don't seem to make much sense. Also, the words ""Samhain"" and ""Celtic"" are grossly mispronounced. The movie itself reminded me of a cross between ""The Hills Have Eyes"" and ""Evil Dead"" only made with an appeal to MTV fans.",1165449600,,457,4.4523809523809526
2453850,1,B000C65YPI,"I've been waiting since late 2003 to see this film which was then known as Samhain. What originally caught my attention was the likes of Jenna Jameson, Chasey Lain, Ginger Lynn Allen, and Taylor Hayes making appearances as what I thought at the time, were leading roles. A few years and a title change later and I have just this moment finished watching it. I've never bothered to write a review before but feel it is my duty to warn others that may be duped into buying this for the same reasons I did.

Jenna Jameson is on screen in total for less than a minute and has about 4 short lines of dialogue and yet she appears all over the front and back covers of the dvd case.
Chasey Lain is in the film slightly longer at the very beginning with Richard Grieco (Billed on the front cover as a major star) as campers who are quickly disposed of in the opening 5 minutes. Taylor Hayes makes a short appearance towards the end of the film as one of the cannibals hostages used for breeding. Having been held for possibly over a year, she looks quite good and clean despite being chained up in a cave.
Ginger Lynn Allen appears as the sister of the cottage caretaker. Her acting ability isn't too bad but as another reviewer pointed out, her Irish accent quickly diminuishes as the film progresses. The Irish caretaker Gary appears as the typical local looney who warns the tourists of the perilous dangers that await them and is even said to be clairvoyant, yet ironically, can't forsee is own miserable death which I couldn't help but think was something out of a Troma film. He has got to be one of the worst actors I have ever seen, and his accent is not so much laughable as it is sad and pathetic.
The rest of the cast are not much better with the character of Steve being frustratingly annoying whilst constantly picking on and tormenting the frigid Shae but somehow gets to bone the hottest girl in the movie, Barbara.
Shae who we know right away will survive but unlike most ""heroes/survivors"" doesn't get a great deal of screen time, as does anyone else really for that matter.

The villains/monsters of the film look very much like the Toxic Avenger meets the Jason Voorhees Part 2 (As once again, another reviewer has pointed out).

There is a scene at the end when Shae is killing one of the monsters and whilst pounding his skull with a frying pan is having brief flashbacks of her friends that have been killed. This wouldn't be too bad if it weren't for the fact that in her flashback are characters that she did not meet in the film such as Jenna Jameson's character and also of a character that she in fact killed, although accidently!).

The ending is typically bad in that all that you can think about when the credits begin to roll is ""What the **** just happened? Why did she do that?"" It's as if the makers decided ""Hmmm, this movie isn't quite bad yet, what can we do to make it worse?""
The director has appeared on the boards at IMDB as stating that this is not the film he intended to make and that massive edits were made without his consent and blah blah blah. He states much of the gore and humour was removed from the film. This is all too obvious as the film has little gore and even less humour (Why do so many supposed horror films try to be funny? Can't they just focus on being scary and bloody?).

All in all, Evil Breed: The Legend Of Samhain is just plain bad and does not deliver what it promises. Known names and faces on the covers that are barely in the film, very little gore, and poor acting.
You have been warned.",1153785600,,3554,4.3706505295007565
2453851,3,B000C65YPI,"This is one strange movie.  A teacher and her students have rented a house for a project.  The house is very remote and the local caretaker is full of scary tales and warnings.  Seems there used to be sacrifices in the area and one old family practiced incest and became extremely inbred.  Oh, and they turned to cannibalism.  The family has hunted down and wiped out but it is still unsafe to stray from the path.

Well, the legends and warnings should have been paid more attention to.  The family is not all gone and they are starting to become very active.  In what seems like a quick blink of an eye nearly the entire cast runs into the deformed cannibals.  These scenes are definitely not for the squeamish and faint-hearted.  The question for the viewer is will anyone survive and if so, how?  Things move pretty quickly until the final scene.

This is a gory movie in the extreme.  Many of the scenes seem included strictly for shock purposes.  Two uncut scenes are available in the special features although whoever set it up needs to study their English as they don't seem to know the difference between silicon (glass, computer chips) and silicone (rubber, breast implants).  The acting is average but not as bad as in some films.  The scenery is pretty basic.  The plot, which is an old one, is not freshened except in the brutal nature it is portrayed.  Still, if you are looking for a real gore-fest then this should be a finalist.",1148428800,,1445,4.556420233463035
2453852,3,B000C65YPI,"This movie wasn't that bad. There's a beautiful cast of porno star's that make the movie. There is really good special effect too. The gore is all there. The scene with Jenna Jameson is my favorite. The story could have been a little better, but it was a great B-Movie. Well worth a watch.",1141430400,,289,4.37037037037037
2453853,1,B000C65YPI,"This movie isn't even worth watching with Jenna Jameson in it. Just like the movie ""Creep"", it didn't explain exactly what the creatures were. The costumes were so bad and the killers looked like sea creatures. The acting was s**t too. The fat kid really mad me mad because he was one of the worst actors I have ever seen in my life. The dialogue was off two. The women began to speak english than switched over to speaking Irish, are you kidding me? The kid also had a really bad Irish accent too.",1140825600,,498,4.308510638297872
2453854,1,B000C65YPI,"Basic slasher film that doesn't even rate one star. But I do give it one star for the 2 uncut scenes added to the disc. The one with porn queen Jenna's inplants being so durable that the guy no matter how hard he tried to chew on them couldn't make them leak. The second scene of the anal probe with the knife was a prime biological example that the human body has one hell of a long intestine. That guy's intestines even flatulated during the removal process. Although extremely gory ya cant help but laugh at this whole globby mess. Im still in the dark what the ending was about it made no sense at all. But I guess chewey implants,  farting bowel removals and bouncing breasts was what the whole plot line of this film anyway.",1139788800,,730,4.328467153284672
2453855,3,B000C65YPI,This is an OK movie if you if your a horror fan but not a must see. The best acting in this movie is done by all the adult film stars. Jenna Jameson isn't in the movie long enough for my taste. The cannibals in the movie look like a cross between The Toxic Avenger and Jason. The movie has some impressive fx's but the story falls short before it gets going.,1138665600,,358,3.986111111111111
2453856,3,B000C65YPI,"UNfortuately.  Tons of ""offensive"" footage (nudity and gore) was cut so the movie suffered trmendously.  This movie was trying to be released for years and years now ...this was the only way to get it mass distributed: cut everything. its sad.",1138147200,,243,4.902439024390244
2453857,1,B000C65YPI,"Let me tell you some of what you will get with this flick:

1. Ginger Lynn Allen doing a VERY bad Irish accent which gets thinner as the movie goes along.

2. The first half is a bore with bad ""Scream"" inspired dialogue. The second half is pure silliness.

3. Porn queen Jenna Jameson is in the movie for about 3 minutes. So is Chasey Lain.

4. Jameson's death scene is hysterical. First, the look on her face when she gets cut open. Then, when the creature begins pulling out her organs, he begins to chomp down on, of all things, her BREAST IMPLANTS!!!!!!

5. More boring teens, except for a cute, naked blonde.

6. The final scene, which makes absolutely ZERO sense.

But there are a few good moments. The story of Samhain and the Druids rituals that created Halloween. The uncensored, bonus scenes (one of which is the aforementioned Jameson death scene.) The other scene sees a guy getting his intestines pulled out through his rear end!!! They are both gory and hilarious.

Yes indeed, this one is something to see. (The second half anyway.)",1137801600,,1047,4.561497326203209
2453858,2,B000C65YPI,The two uncut scenes added can give it one more star than it probably deserves. Don't spend too much if you have to buy it out of curiousity like I did.,1137110400,,152,3.935483870967742

8096200,5,B000C65YPI,"Jenna Jameson and Ginger Lynn star in this scary movie that resembles The Hills Have Eyes but it is set in the U.K. in a forest. A horribly deformed man who is also cannibalistic hunts people who dare venture into the forest at night. Richard Grieco(21 Jumpstreet:TV Series, Booker) stars in this for about the first ten minutes. VERY bloody.",1395360000,,342,4.716666666666667
8096201,3,B000C65YPI,"Not a very new twist on an old theme, a group of college kids and their teacher go to this resort in the middle of nowhere for whatever reason, they meet a crazy who tells them they are going to die and beware of the druids, People are killed, first just the ones who enter the stay out zones and them the killer goes to the house where they are staying. Jenna jameson is sexy but not impressive as an actress.  The best scene is watching Ginger Lynn kick the crap out of the monster/killer while screaming and running away. This movie is so bad its good. Not strong on plot but the action gradually builds to the climax.",1331078400,,621,4.218487394957983
8096202,5,B000C65YPI,"I absolutely LOVED this movie!! If you watch it and think it's going to be a great movie you will most definitely be disappointed. But if you watch it thinking of it as more of one of those bad movies that's so ridiculous it's good, then it's great. My friends and I watch this while drinking and have created numerous drinking games to go with it. We often refer to this movie as a ""horror/porn/comedy"" which I feel properly describes that it's going to suck yet still be entertaining. While watching it make fun of how horrible and unrealistic it is and you will actually enjoy it.",1247788800,,583,4.457943925233645
8096203,1,B000C65YPI,"Wow, this was not a good movie. I expected cheap B horror, but this movie just didn't come through. It was really kind of insulting the way they implied the hideous monters had anything to do with Druidism. The only bright spot was the correct pronoucation of the word Samhian.",1231027200,,277,4.56
8096204,2,B000C65YPI,"This film is pretty much like every other camping-trip-ruined-by-inbred-cannibals movie you've ever seen - except Evil Breed: The Legend of Samhain does it with aging pornstars.  I have to question the filmmaker's reasoning here.  Young pornstars I could understand.  I don't care how hot Chasey Lain, Jenna Jameson, and Taylor Hayes were back in the day, all of the body reconstruction work is beginning to show, as are the effects of various substances they've probably injected into themselves at one point or another.  Furthermore, why do I want to go through the torture of watching a horrible movie just to see a couple of them topless when a quick Google search could take me right to video clips of them getting their freak on when their implants were still new?  I will grant the filmmakers a little leeway when it comes to Ginger Lynn Allen, since she has actually done a fair share of mainstream films over the years.  But get this - these guys have Ginger speaking with an Irish accent.  You just have to laugh at this nonsense.

Okay, getting back to the actual film.  I don't know what college these folks are from, but their teacher, Karen (Bobbie Phillips), has eschewed the classroom setting in order to bring them to Ireland and show them real history.  Her entire lesson plan, I must note, seems to consist solely of a few moments spent cracking jokes around a circle of rocks.  Only one girl, Shae (Brandi-Ann Milbradt) is even interested in the subject; the others just want to have sex.  Everyone soon goes their separate ways, get attacked by cannibals, yada yada yada.  The whole thing would be excruciatingly unbearable were it not for one man, this film's one and only saving grace.  And that man's name is Gary (Simon Peacock), who turns up again and again, right out of the blue, to warn the Americans not to stray off the path in those dangerous woods.  Say what you will, but I think more horror films could use weirdo Scotsmen popping up now and again to utter dire warnings in a distinctively brogue tongue.

Let's be clear: this is a lousy horror movie with an atrocious ending.  Yeah, it's good for a few laughs but that's it.  The only good thing about it is the gore, but I obviously didn't find the film nearly as gory as some.  Yeah, there's blood and entrails and all that good stuff, but it all looks fake.  No one loves a good beheading more than I do, but the one in this film is just ridiculous.  Of course, the gore would have been much more satisfying if we had been able to see the film as it was originally made.  Sadly, Evil Breed: The Legend of Samhain is what is left after a significant amount of gore and nudity got snipped out of the original version.  Why you would heavily edit the only two things going for you (in this case, nudity and gore) is beyond me; it's cinematic self-castration.",1220486400,,2844,4.566074950690335
8096205,3,B000C65YPI,"The DVD, which arrived today, is in wide-screen letterbox format, as advertised, but it does not have closed captions (or optional subtitles), and the aspect ratio is not 2.35:1 (it looks closer to 1.66:1). I ordered the DVD chiefly on the basis of its advertised features and I am very disappointed. Caveat emptor.",1183766400,,315,4.962264150943396
8096206,2,B000C65YPI,"Not bad if your a horror fan looking for a simple horror movie. Don't look much beyond that though. Really I would only give it one star, but I was able to grab a copy with the two deleted scenes, which alone where enough to bring it up a slight notch. Not much, but it does at least show you the potential the movie could of had with better actors and less editing.

Don't pay any attention to the cast for this movie, as all the stars that are billed, namely porn stars, have about 5 minutes of total screen time, all combined. For the most part it's all based around the other much less known actors, which is for good reason, cause they are not very good. The Barbara and Shea are good on the eyes at least.

The others have already stated enough encompassing reviews that another is not needed, but the ending to this movie leaves far to many questions. Apparently this was do to heavy editing. But they should have just scrapped it at this point. I watched and re-watched the ending about 10 times, and I still stand there wondering what the f*** is going on. It makes absolutely no sense, what so ever. None. Zippo. Perhaps if you see it and understand you can let me, and apparently the other reviewers know.",1174176000,,1216,4.328947368421052
