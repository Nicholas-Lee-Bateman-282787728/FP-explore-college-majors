This biography/documentary DVD is nearly eccentric as its subject, modernist composer/art provocateur Erik Satie. With its combination of rare still photos, interviews with Saties contemporaries, cartoons, and brief, oddly staged performance pieces, this film should probably be viewed more for its entertainment value than as an attempt at serious biographical or musical analysis
.
As such, it works very well. Given the deliberate attempts on Saties part at both image building and obscuring the facts of his life (especially with his contemporaries), a straight, chronological narrative would likely have proven unsuccessful anyway, so why not go with snatches of early films, reproductions of Saties calligraphy put in motion, and anecdotes from famous contemporaries like Man Ray and Jean Cocteau? Throw in oddly staged musical performances (string quartets on a factory floor, duets played on upright pianos stacked one atop the other, etc.) of rarely heard Satie music and the package is complete.

For fans of Erik Saties music, the film Satiesfictions may provide many intriguing moments; its rarely seen still and motion pictures are worth the price of admission alone. However, its greater value may lie in serving as an introduction to the uninitiated.
