8223198,5,B000WGLARE,"This is a mixed bag of three separate stories all woven into one DVD. The first is titled Scream for Me, this one is a truly shocking brutal twisted little masterpiece of depravity and violence.

The acting is stunning and shocking on just how perfect it is. You get a brutal story of murder and sexual torture. Its deep and gets under your skin and makes you want to take a bath.

All three films are a wonderful example of descriptive and powerful incidents unfolding as if the reality is happening in front of you. At the start of the first story it starts out strong and never lets up with suspense and terror reality that comes together as if in harmony.

Awesome vivid film making of a high quality nature. Stunning and Grade A +++ direction and written script. Flawless in the darker nature reality of the hidden world of violence and the macabre.

8223199,5,B000WGLARE,"Christopher Alan Broadstone's three short films, Human No More, My Skin, and Scream For Me are the best short independent films I've seen in a long time.  Tony Simmons stars as the main character, in three very different roles (one as Death, one as a Detective, and one as a serial killer known only as Madman), and is so convincingly real that you ever realize its the same guy.  The cinematography is incredible and these films are as artistic as they are horrifying.

Scream For Me is my personal favorite.  Chris accomplishes something more horrifying with a low budget and in 20 minutes that mainstream horror has failed to do in decades - truly terrify his audience.

All of these films have won multiple awards from best film to best actor to best score.

I highly recommend them.  These are three must have films for any true fan of horror.",1208995200,,848,4.613333333333333
8223200,5,B000WGLARE,"Christopher Alan Broadstone's THREE DEAD GIRLS announces the arrival of a filmmaker with the dark sensibilities of a David Lynch or a David Fincher, but unlike Lynch he has a sense of narrative that is (thankfully) more linear, and he's willing to go just that one heartbeat further into darkness than Fincher has gone, even with movies like SE7EN. At times, the ambitious storytelling is sometimes hamstrung by the limited budget, but the combined effort of Broadstone and his willing muse, actor Tony Simmons, more than makes up for it. This is a great calling card, and I can't wait to see what will happen when this dark, Dynamic Duo - as potent as the teaming of Corman and Price in their heyday - will do with bigger budgets and better resources to commit more twisted visions into the human psyche to film.",1195948800,,813,4.6923076923076925
8223201,4,B000WGLARE,"Any given week, I'll get a call from one of my friends, saying, ""Hey, did you get *insert hot new Hollywood film or television series here* on DVD?"", to which I always reply, ""No. I'm too busy watching all these low-budget horror movies people send me all the time."" I'll admit, sometimes it gets to me. Sure I'd like to sit down and check out some nice, polished zillion-dollar slick production. But I always know they'll only go so far. I always kinda know what I'm in for. Not so when you're talking about indie horror.

However, once in a while, I'll see one of these no-budget productions and think, ""now why the hell aren't THESE people working in Hollywood?""

Such is the case with filmmaker Christoper Alan Broadstone, and his leading man Tony Simmons. MY SKIN! takes place in one room, at one desk. At that desk sits death itself (Simmons), and on the floor behind him is the dead body of a woman, her hands and feet bound. Her head all bloodied, covered in a plastic bag. There's been a murder, and the grim reaper has come for her soul. But he's got a treat for the guy who committed the crime, and he makes a little phone call to the killer before wrapping up his business at the scene of the crime.

Think an episode of THE TWILIGHT ZONE, as directed by David Lynch, shot and edited by Sam Raimi, and that's kinda what the experience of watching MY SKIN! is like. The atmosphere is maddening, the lighting and sound crisp yet nightmarish, and the acting is 100% hide-under-the-covers scary. Tony Simmons is one of the best actors I've ever seen grace and independent production, he reeks of talent and energy. His performance matches the pro-level editing and camera work beat for beat, making the whole piece effective and enjoyable. I'm not nit-picky, but even so I would be hard pressed to find anything resembling a flaw in this production.

Also on this disc is a 22-minute short entitled SCREAM FOR ME, which again takes place in a single room, but is stylistically different from MY SKIN! and decidedly more brutal and disturbing. Without going into detail (buy the DVD ya cheap bastards!), I'll say that when I watched it, I actually felt relieved when the poor girl was murdered, and wishing the same fate for the unfortunately still-conscious guy lying beside her on the floor. My my my, is this one rough going, largely due to Tony Simmons' once again amazing performance. You can't even tell it's the same guy from MY SKIN!, a testament to the man's abilities. He and Broadstone seem all too ready to dive into really REALLY dark territory.

When my friends think they're cool with all the latest 2 disc special editions and season whatever of the hit TV show of the moment, I invite them to sit down and spend a little time in the world of independent cinema, where anything can happen to anyone at anytime. Where, in the case of Christopher Alan Broadstone's work, psycho killers are the least of your worries.",1195948800,3,2937,4.597328244274809
8223202,4,B000WGLARE,"The short films of Christopher Alan Broadstone, all with an intense macabre bend, take on Death himself (My Skin), psycho-sexual mind games (Scream for Me), and the devil inside us all (Human No More).  I'm relieved to say that Broadstone delivers very intriguing work and shows a mountain of promise as a developing artist for the genre.

The three short films, all featuring performances by Tony Simmons that eclipse that of mainstream actors, are fascinating pieces of filmmaking, but what really makes this DVD worth it is the experience of the whole package.  Each film is accompanied by at least 3 commentary tracks, as well as a boat load of behind the scenes interviews, set tours and still photography.  The amount of information contained here is indispensable to any aspiring artist.  Broadstone goes into depth about all manner of production; his artistic intentions, his technical limitations, his work with actors, his budget, his equipment -- everything.

Even if you have no intention of working as dark a seam as these films do, there will be plenty of insights to transcend the horror genre.  Anyone who takes the art of the genre seriously is going to find more than enough to sate their hunger here.",1195862400,3,1219,4.946078431372549
8223203,5,B000WGLARE,"As a big fan of horrors I've bought a few movies of Christopher Alan Broadstone and I have to say it was really a great time, that I've spent enjoying these films. ""3 Dead Girls"" is a wonderful collection for every horror fan. :) The movies are short, but each of them has a special idea that is so original!! After watching the DVD I was really provoked to think, and I'm very excited to watch it again and again!! And all the extras are amazing.  A+++",1194652800,,453,4.206896551724138
