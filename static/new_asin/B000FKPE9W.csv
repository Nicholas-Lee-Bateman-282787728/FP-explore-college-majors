8124367,5,B000FKPE9W,"All Zatoichi's movies and television shows are magnificent and brilliant. These productions always include beautiful Japanese countryside scenes from the 60's and 70's. Particular emphasis is spent on ancient traditional cultural dress, language and events that is not prevalent in today's movies and TV productions. This take place during the waning era of the Samurai if you like. Of course there is the eventual sword fight with the blind swordsman and dangerous rivals and vagabonds in each episode, which Zatoichi always wins, but there is always a different moral lesson pertaining to the episode that is the actual meaning of each film. These episodes also pertain very strongly to the common man of the time who basically was left to fend for themselves against a society of onerous taxes and legislation by a corrupt officials of the time. Also the ""Yakusa"" rears its ugly head in most of the chapters and Zatoichi is a part of that group yet not a part of the underworld life. Zato is an itinerant gambler fooling all with his seemingly ""country bumpkin"" ways. You will enjoy this series no doubt...!!",1410825600,,1111,4.978494623655914
8124368,5,B000FKPE9W,"Having seem most all the ZS stories I can say, they're mostly all the same, the same format from meeting villains seeking revenge for Z-slashed brethren, lost orphans, abused Gheiha, cheating gambling houses -  basic plots, themes, action, kinds of characters and of course, Shintaro Katsu.

AND THEY'RE ALL BRILLIANT, EACH ELEMENT FULL OF SURPRISES: LUSH AUTHENTIC JAPANESE LOCATIONS (RURAL COUNTRY AND VILLAGES)/ SCENERY, CLOTHING, ARCHITECTURE, VILLAGES, SHRINES, KATANAS, KIMONOS, MUSIC/ DANCING, MORALS, VALUES, ATTITUDES, GAMBLING, SAKI, HISTORICAL, BARS, YAKUZA, BROTHELS, GEISHA, FLASHING SWORDS (Z'S, MOSTLY) BODY COUNTS, MASSAGING . . . WELL, MOST EVERYTHING IN ZATOICHI'S LIFETIME. FICTIONAL LIFETIME. Whew, I gotta go watch some more Zatoichi.

That list contains no spoilers because it's just the structure of a constantly changing authentic tapestry of life in the days of feudal Japan. In every film in each medium chronicling the wanderings of the world's favorite most famous Blind Yakuza slasher masseuse swordsman gambler wise justice-seeking protector of cheated put-upon poor peasants spiritual hard-drinking mostly-smiling gracefully wandering incredibly laughing funny fat guy tapping his way through dirt roads and dangerous waters. Who often ends up in hot water from mistaken identity gaffs to hot tubs naked men and beautiful women.

Every Z story seems new even with such similar elements; they never get old. That Z kills 20-30 bad guys per show is something fans expect, look forward to, and would miss. Most Z stories I have seen over an over. And never fail to enjoy them, regret seeing Z walk off into the sunset.

Zatoichi is the most-collectible action hero series in the world. In Japan, where Shintaro Katsu's (was Ichi) funeral was held, I'm not sure but over 40,000 or 400,000 admirers came to pay their respects. Just search Amazon using 'Zatoichi' and see the very long list of his wonderful adventures. There is even ICHI, a tale of a blind woman masseuse, which is wonderful too. (She slashes almost as many villains as the bearded Ichi. Hie!? Hie!

No need for me to review any more Zatoichi stories. This review pertains to all Ichi stories.

Another Asian hero, this time mythical. A newcomer and very different from Z, very surprising surp<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Daimajin-Triple-Feature-Collector-s-Edition-Blu-ray/dp/B008L0YMSW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Daimajin - Triple Feature Collector's Edition - Blu-ray</a>",1383782400,2,2508,5.7077747989276135

8124371,5,B000FKPE9W,"The Zatoichi TV series continues where Volume 4 leaves off. As with the entire first year of the series' episodes, they are ALL in chronological order. These episodes are very good, with quite a lot of drama in the series too. Also, because of the age of these TV episodes, Media Blasters/Tokyo Shock does warn the viewers that there are some imperfections with the transfer. However, many of the episodes are very good in terms of quality. And besides, for those who like Zatoichi, you will find the imperfections not at all bothersome, and well worth having in order to complete your Ichi collection. Moreover, this Volume has some very good episodes. [Stars: 5] The episodes are as follows:

#18: ""RUSH TRIP."" This particular episode borrows some elements from the Zatoichi motion picture film series, but not too much: As you will notice at the beginning of this film. In this episode there is a boss who is slain by a former prison inmate. Why did he do it? What were his motives? He never knew the man! However, in his escape he encounters Zatoichi. Moreover, he is in a rush to get back to where he came from. Why? This particular episode has great cinematography and Ichi is his usual playful and humorous self. Plus, his sword skills have not dulled a bit [Pun intended]. There is a lot of back stabbing in this film, and I found this episode to be very, very good. And as usual, Ichi can see through the all deception, even though he is blind. The ending action with Ichi is good. [Stars: 5]

#19: ""A RAINBOW OVER MY HOMELAND."" This episode boasts some very beautiful scenery. And as with the previous episode, there is much deception and betrayal. In the beginning, Ichi is already flashing his sword, dispensing with a group of yakuza who think they can take him down. They just never learn. There are some light-hearted parts in this episode too! Ichi has just met a man who has left his village after 3 years. He is now returning home. It is here that he meets Ichi. There was a reason for his departure, and the film is about why he left. Moreover, there is quite a bit of swordplay by Ichi in this particular episode--and he is quick too! The stranger that Ichi meets realizes that it was a mistake to leave, and behind this are the usual cadre of corrupt yakuza bosses. Great swordplay by Ichi. [Stars: 4.5]

#20: ""A FEMALE BOSS AND HER WOLVES."" This episode is a very complex one, as far as the TV series is concerned. A female boss wants her clan dissolved, and for her clan members to voluntarily leave and make a new start. She has even sent her son away to become a metalworker in Edo. However, her son Kosuke has other plans. Moreover, to complicate matters, her sons best friend, Matsugaro, who has a sister Kosuke is in love with wants to take over the territory of the female boss. Plus, this character Matsugaro learned all he knows from this female boss. She is tired of the yakuza life, and wants what is best for the village: Hence her decision to disband her yakuza clan. Ichi has a back seat in this episode, but when something happens to the female boss, he swings into action. [Stars: 4.5]

#21: ""THE LITTLE FLOWER BY THE LAKE."" This is a very good drama and action episode. Plus, their are some splendid colors in this particular TV episode. The cinematography is great! In the beginning, Ichi saves two lovers who are about to commit suicide, telling them to live a better life. But there is more to the male than meets the eye. As Ichi leaves these two lovers, he enters a village where a woman has been waiting for her lover to return: He departed 3 years ago. Moreover, this woman, named Okiyu, has been eking out her life in a brothel, waiting for the day Sentaro will return. Yet, there is more to this man than meets the eye too. [No spoilers] There is something sinister about the men in this town, and the deception in this episode is loathsome. This is a great episode, and boasts great action, and comedy thrown together. Plus, there is a very strange ending. Once again, too, the scenery in this episode is just great. [Stars: 5+]",1188691200,15,4077,4.505405405405406
