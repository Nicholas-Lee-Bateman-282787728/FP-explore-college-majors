8672016,5,B00MFVHPLO,I have given this series 5 stars even though we are not able to play it on our DVD player.  The box says it is for Region 2.  We have seen some on Public TV and wanted to see more,1509235200,,179,3.45
8672017,4,B00MFVHPLO,well thought out plots,1500336000,,22,4.75
8672018,5,B00MFVHPLO,"1) These are Region 2 DVDs (Europe), and will not play on 99% of American DVD players.*
2) This is NOT the ""Complete Inspector Lewis""
There were 33 episodes total - this box is missing the final three.

CONFUSION: There were nine seasons of Inspector Lewis in the United Kingdom, but only eight in the US.
PBS broadcast the original UK Seasons 1-3 as US Seasons 1-2.
The complete 33 episode series in the UK is Seasons 1-9, versus Seasons 1-8 in the US.

The official North American ""Complete Inspector Lewis"" box was released in October 2016.
Recommended -
- All 33 episodes  are included and are uncut (92-96 minutes per episode, not 80 minute PBS broadcasts)
- The original extra features are included.
- Widescreen picture.
- English SDH subtitles.
- Inexpensive: 18 DVDs for $67

WARNING:
Amazon has screwed up the listing of the North American Complete Series box (released 2016), confusing it with the Season 1-4 box (released 2011) which was a disaster - edited episodes, no subtitles)
The top posted reviews on Amazon are for the Season 1-4 box.
Ignore any review dated 2011-2015.
The reviewer complaints are no longer valid.
All problems were fixed by the time the Season 1-6 box was released, and remain fixed for the Complete Series box.
-- all 33 episodes in the Complete Series box are the unedited UK version.
-- all 33 episodes in the Complete Series box have English subtitles.

The first posted review of the ""Complete Series"" box was my review titled ""REVIEW OF COMPLETE SERIES IN 18 DVD BOX"" (dated October 15, 2016)

I hope it clears up the mess Amazon has made of this.

* Region-free DVD players are available on Amazon - I strongly recommend you look into them.
(stores don't sell them.)
They will play any DVD from Europe, Asia, or America, and cost less than $75.
