8127595,5,B000FWHVRI,"Great Spanish-language, Mexican-made double feature. La Horripilante Bestia Humana aka Night of the Bloody Apes, made in the late 1960's, is a color film about a doctor/scientist who, with the best of intentions, tries to cure his son of a fatal ailment and with his treatment unintentionally turns him into a murderous, raping ape-man. A female wrestler and her detective boyfriend go about trying to solve the series of strange, BLOODY murders. My beef is that there is a LOT of blood. There is also stock footage of actual operations in all their GRAPHIC glory. The second film is better. Munecos Infernales aka Curse of the Doll People, made in the early 1960's,is a black-and-white film about a curse laid on a bunch of scientists/adventurers who steal an idol from some natives. They are then killed and turned into possessed doll people who go about killing the guilty parties with poisoned needles. The curse is orchestrated by an evil voodoo priest and his zombiefied henchman who looks like he has a wrinkled towel for a face. The actor who plays the voodoo priest is the most compelling character. The female doctor who tries to solve the whole mess is the strongest character, a welcome change from the usual damsels in distress from that era. I ordered the BCI/Eclipse DVD release. The quality of the DVD is very good, probably the best out there. It also has English-language alternatives. Highly recommended.",1465689600,,1423,4.933333333333334

This is one of the best of the black and white mexican horror films of all time. Extremely atmospheric and quite macabre. Unfortunately, CasaNegra was unable to procure an un-edited english version, and as such, the English version given, excludes two great scenes. However, the scenes are included in the Spanish version.

The beautiful, statuesque Elvira Quintana, former Miss Mexico and Miss Universe contestant, leads the cast, and steals the show. Watch out for that zombie ghoul! and no,  bullets will not stop him! I would have given this five stars if the English version was full length",1245110400,4,650,5.05607476635514
8127597,5,B000FWHVRI,"This is an excellent double feature! NIGHT OF THE BLOODY APES is about a mad doctor attempting to save his son's life by transplanting the heart of an ape (!!) into his chest cavity. Of course, all goes awry, causing the son to turn into a rampaging ape-man! This one includes copious amounts of nudity, fake blood, and ultra-cheezey gore effects. There's also lots of masked, female wrestling footage as well as not one but TWO open-heart surgeries to gawk at! Yes, NOTBA is a true masterpiece of schlock-o-matic cinema! CURSE OF THE DOLL PEOPLE is the old b+w classic about a group of explorers who steal a sacred idol from a voodoo priest, only to have the evil guy send forth living dolls to assassinate them! COTDP has loads of creepy atmosphere, a 7' tall, flute-playing zombie-slave, and a secret lair for the voodoo dood complete w/ cobwebs and skeletons! This movie scared me into near hysterics as a kid. It remains one of my favorite oldschool spookers.  This CRYPT OF TERROR presentation contains both films in their original spanish versions, and their updated americanized editions. In the case of BLOODY APES, this is like two totally different movies! With DOLL PEOPLE, we get extra scenes in the original...",1199491200,12,1224,4.828571428571428
8127598,2,B000FWHVRI,"I'll review Night of the Bloody Apes separately. Curse of the Doll People is okay early 60's Mexican horror cinema about the fulfillment of a voodoo death curse using dolls inhabited by the spirits of those they murder. It has a long, boring introduction followed by some creepy scenes when the dolls are featured. However, the voodoo priest looks like he escaped from a Las Vegas lounge magic act. There's also a zombie that looks like something out of a Scooby Doo cartoon. Typical for Mexican flicks, it features an atmospheric set design. The voodoo house, though, features a hypnotic device later to strike horror into our world in the 70's- a disco ball! If you're a genre fan , you'll enjoy it. Please note that this DVD has both American TV and original Spanish-language versions. Both are excellent quality. The former runs about 69 minutes, the latter about 83. You should scan through the latter for two important scenes together near the middle- a scene where the dolls attempt to steal back the idol that explains why one doll is considered disobedient by the priest (you have no clue in the U.S. version) and a scene where a doll of the murdered nurse is created by the priest (this is probably the best scene in the movie, but it doesn't exist on the U.S. side!). This movie is better than 90% of the films in those 50-pack collections, but remember it's best suited for those of us who love the genre.",1156291200,14,1417,4.626984126984127
