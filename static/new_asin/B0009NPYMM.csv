8063574,4,B0009NPYMM,"Jack McCoy has given us a look into two different approaches to professional surfing through the examples of Andy Irons (may he RIP) and Dave Rastovich. This is Andy in 2003 as he is gearing up to his peak performance as a WCT surfer. It is Rasta experimenting with different boards and traveling around the globe in search of new and better waves as a sponsored professional ""free"" surfer. I love how McCoy starts the movie at Teahupoo where these two go head to head, wave for wave in BIG surf. That scene removed any question I had about the validity of comparing Rasta to AI in terms of their abilities. But that is where the similarities ended. For the rest of the film, McCoy contrasts Rasta's mellow, soul-surfer approach to life with Andy's amped and business-like (materialistic in my opinion) approach to the sport. While I enjoyed the documentary style of this film over the typical surf movie (all surfing and no story), McCoy barely breaks the surface of the complex personality of Andy Irons - if you hope to see any revealing scenes of him partying or losing his cool, you won't find them here. This is not an expose, and how could it be? The film's main sponsor, Billabong, was also the sponsor of both these surfers. Nevertheless, for what it lacks in journalistic digging into the underbelly of AI's pro career and personal life, it makes up for with incredible, artistic footage and a soundtrack that will make watching it over again a joy. Definitely worth your time and $$.

[Note: I did get a bit tired of watching both surfers go left, grabbing the rail through some serious barrels. If you are regular foot like me and prefer right-handers, then the footage gets a bit repetitive at times. On the other hand, after watching this movie, I have the image of what to do permanently etched in my brain should I ever find myself going left in an epic tube. ;-)",1357776000,,1879,4.592261904761905

Blue  Horizon  has  excellent  water  footage  and  is  a  profile  of  both  a  competitive  and  a  free  surfer ,
In  the  newer  21st  century  style .
I  am  now  a  major  fan  a  Rasta's  dad .
Only  adverse  side  effect  is  you  may  want  to  become  a  serious  surfer  and  it  is  probably  Not  advisable  for  us  geezers ,
{ but  ya'  want  to  anyway ! } .
The  Rasta  mantra  { Think  it  ,  Feel  it  ,  Do  it }  can  be  applied  to  any  activity  tho ,  not  just  surfing .
Loved  this  totally .

8063577,4,B0009NPYMM,"A surf story that follows Andy Irons and Dave Rastovich through a surf season - contest surfing vs. free surfing. Great scenery, surf, music and narrative. Although this doesn't make it into my top favorites, it's definitely worth watching a couple of times.
