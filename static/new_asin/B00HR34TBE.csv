6198888,5,B00HR34TBE,"I am reviewing JUST the Hugo movie since I have not seen the other two. Hugo is one of those 'Kids' movies that is really just as appealing to adults. This film blends a fantastic look-and-feel with an exceptionally fine multifaceted main story, capped in  the last 4th of the film with sub-story involving the history of the early film era, including a nod to the classic short film ""A Trip To The Moon', which to this day is regarded as the main representative of the birth of motion pictures. Hugo, like another masterpiece, 'Bridge To Terabithia', is an example of what truly great kid's films should aspire to, rather than than the mundane and mindless assembly line cookie cutter material that is so common these days.",1499904000,,724,4.700787401574803

6198900,5,B00HR34TBE,"For lack of descriptions of the product, I was reluctant to buy the set of 3 discs with a movie plus features each. But the movies intrigued me for the offered price. Each disc/movie has very good 5.1 audio and subtitled for several languages. I found the English for hard of hearing subtitles on each disc accurate to the dialog.
Hugo: 16 X 9 aspect. Fills a flat screen. An extra includes interviews with the principal actors and director. It gives depth to the movie. It is a visually splendid production even though the disc is not in 3D which was how the movie was filmed.
Spiderwick and Inkheart are both in Letterbox. Each movie is a story well told. Mind that Inkheart is accurately rated PG13 for a child, pre-teen, in peril. No gory stuff but a bit of intense violence.",1478822400,6,779,4.492957746478873

That part is fantastic.  Story very good.  Spiderwick is for those of us who demand happy endings.  Best actor goes to a non-human.  Again, excellent story with great special effects.

6198974,5,B00HR34TBE,"$8.99 for these three movies is a ridiculous steal! SUCH a great deal! Three quality movies wrapped into one awesome purchase under $10.00. I hadn't seen any of these movies prior to buying this set, but I have to say they are definitely three of my family's favorites now that we've watched them.

HUGO:
This is the story of a young orphan boy who lives in a train station. He has a mechanical-man that he's trying to fix, and fate brings him together with a young girl that may be able to help him. This story is very sweet, industrially-inspired, and artistically filmed. It doesn't have a lot of dialogue and focuses a lot of it's filmography on the inner mechanical workings of the train station. With the dialogue that is shared, a sincere and heartfelt story evolves that teaches the true meaning of 'family' and 'friendship' and 'fighting for your dreams amidst all adversity'. Age appropriate for children of all ages, but I think kids 8 and up will get the most out of this film.

THE SPIDERWICK CHRONICLES:
A delightful fairytale-esque film with a lot of auction, this film was definitely one of the children's universally well-liked movies. Kids of all ages definitely enjoyed this one. The tale follows three siblings as they move into a new house and discover that it's filled with much more magic than they bargained for. When one of the siblings discovers a magical book, they are thrust into a world where they're the only ones who can save the creatures within it. There are fairies, goblins, little creatures, magical creatures, sprites, time-travel, and many more magical things. The special effects in this film are among the best I've ever seen. Beautiful, breath-taking, and do a perfect job of capturing the imagination of toddlers, without being too 'child-like' and deterring the teenagers. This is an ageless film full of action and comedy and age-appropriate quirky-ness. It may be a bit frightening at time for kids under 6, but aside from the few small 'very action-y moments', it's a great film for all children.

INKHEART
This movie starts with a man reading, and the book that he's reading begins to come to life. Fast foreward 14 years, and he has a daughter- but his wife is mysteriously missing. While at a book fair he and his daughter encounter a strange story-character-like man who demands his help 'getting back home'. As the story goes on you discover that the man read a book, and released characters, who never got put back in. Those same characters are either trying to rule the world, or get back into the book from which they came- and he's in the middle of the controversy. Trying to keep his daughter safe doesn't work- and he finds himself, and his daughter, trying to reverse the words he's read aloud and put the characters back into the stories from which they belong. There is a lot of action in this film, and it was definitely a huge hit with my teenagers and younger boys. This is definitely a great movie for kids of all ages. Once again there are a few parts where the action gets intense and possibly scary for younger kids- but aside from those moments it's a movie all kids will love.",1424390400,19,3146,4.685352622061483
6198975,5,B00HR34TBE,I bought this for my godson as a Christmas gift. He likes movies and books and since all of these movies are based on books.  I thought it was a good choice.  I also bought him all the books that go along with the movies.,1422576000,3,221,3.888888888888889
