8522282,1,B007VQ2OI2,"I'm sorry, but the message is absolutely out the only thing powerful about A HARD LESSON. I saw the cover page and noticed a few well known actors would appear in A Hard Lesson and thought I'd give it a try. The sound was inconsistent and poor, the acting was near elementary (with a few exceptions), and the cinematography seemed like it was shot by a college undergrad drop out. The power of the message is diluted by the budget and unpolished delivery of this move. As a matter of fact, I wouldn't doubt that the makers of A Hard Lesson thought just that; maybe the audience recognize the two famous faces and will subsequently  overlook the lack of budget and professionalism and see the good message in the story.",1493856000,,718,4.523076923076923

8522286,4,B007VQ2OI2,"This film is the African-American version of ""Stand and Deliver."" This is a re-release of the 2007 film ""City Teacher."" Jeff Solomon (Jonathan Sale) is a parole officer who is asked to teach a class of 12 troubled unruly teens how to read. He has to buck the teaching system as well as having to gain the trust and respect of his class, all who have criminal records.

Jeff is white and Jewish. His wife Marsha (Heather Tom) leaves him because she wants him to be in a job that makes more money. Jeff is also unusual in that he was adopted and raised by African-American parents in a far fetched story. He gets advice from his dad (Glynn Turman) who was also a teacher. Meanwhile there are robberies going on in the neighborhood.

Heart warming ending in a film that has border line acting. Like so many produced African-American films this one contains excessive amount of dialouge and discussion about the problems facing the black and Latino communities rather then just let us experience it. 3 1/2 stars.

Parental Guide: F-bombs, a grope scene, married couple briefly in bed, no nudity.",1341619200,3,1091,4.671875
