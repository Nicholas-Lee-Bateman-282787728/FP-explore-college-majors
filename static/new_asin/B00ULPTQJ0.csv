8707341,5,B00ULPTQJ0,"This DVD is very well presented for beginners to Krav Maga, easing into the moves with warm ups that are easy to follow and perform.  I am finding it very easy to get started and enjoy the work  outs very much.",1456185600,2,210,4.097560975609756
8707342,5,B00ULPTQJ0,Pretty detailed,1447027200,,15,7.0
8707343,3,B00ULPTQJ0,This is good. But it assumes you know the basics. I thought I was getting a basic DVD because I have had no prior exposure to Krav Maga,1436745600,7,135,3.857142857142857
8707344,4,B00ULPTQJ0,"The instructor is really animated. Like, distractingly so. The drills are good, but they are two person drills. It's not like you can watch at home alone and work out. Still, there are good basic moves here that you can do to refresh your memory between classes. It's definitely beginner level though.",1434931200,5,301,4.8076923076923075
