4861155,5,B005RVF5XE,When will it come out in Region 1?  I prefer watching it on my TV.  It is a wonderful series and I love the writing and the acting.,1364428800,5,131,3.642857142857143
4861156,5,B005RVF5XE,"Death in Paradise is a fun series, but the producers should let the public know if there will be more coming so they can make the financial decision as to whether it's worth buying a Region Free Player. More series = more justification for doing so.",1363564800,3,249,4.434782608695652
4861157,5,B005RVF5XE,"What a perfectly wonderful series!  The first four reviews cover all of the important points.  I just want to encourage anyone who loves comedy, intelligent writing and humor, puzzling mysteries, superb acting and gorgeous scenery to watch this series.  You'll be hooked from the opening credits and music.  D.I. Poole strolling the tropical beach in his black business suit, white shirt, dark tie - and his polished dress shoes - is an image that I'll cherish for many years.  And it's great advertising for Guadeloupe, which does indeed look like Paradise here. I love the Caribbean and this is a hymn to its beauty and people.

But what will it take, BBC, to convince you to release this encoded for Region 1, USA/Canada/Bermuda?  Just tell me and I'll do it!  This is far too good to keep hidden from the North American market.  I'm a would-be customer, BBC....",1361577600,55,865,4.79054054054054
4861158,5,B005RVF5XE,"PBS picked it up and I am so glad! This is a wonderful Saturday night show, I totally agree with the other reviewers a lighthearted version of Poirot with more humor and tropical vistas!
I wish all the CSIs (that I don't watch but that abund in prime time TV ) would stop trying to outdo the gore and bring in some humor for once! The problem lays in the acting too, all the ""pretty faces"" that can't deliver a pun!
By contrast a low keyed Danny John-Jules ( remember Cat from Red Dwarf anyone?!) ,is great to watch in his exchanges with Gary Carr as the local police.
And can I say enough about Ben Miller? He is superb, he makes the show possible and carries it brilliantly! Just watch the way he can be incredibily funny, inspire awe and be completely pathetic at the same time! All with a very British stiff upper lip!
Watch him wearing those suits on the beach!
I noticed him in Primeval, then in Doc Martin, Johnny English, etc... Now I can't get enough of him, there is something about the way he keeps his face straight as he delivers the quirkiest things ever! It was about time he got a show to revolve around him, he can definitely step up to the challenge.
PS I stopped watching series 3, sorry, I liked Kris Marshall in Death at a Funeral but I don't think he can carry a show.",1360368000,115,1290,4.247967479674797
4861159,5,B005RVF5XE,"You would have thought that police series have been done from every conceivable angle over the years, and it is almost an achievement in itself to come up with one which is at all out of the ordinary. However, the script writers have managed to achieve just that with Death in Paradise which is quite an offbeat drama. The series is set on the fictional Caribbean island of Sainte-Marie, but was in fact filmed in Guadeloupe.

Episode 1 sees DI Richard Poole of the UK Metropolitan Police seconded to the exotic island from less than exotic London suburb of Croydon, to assist the local police in investigating the murder of an ex pat detective. We quickly get the Caribbean flavour of the island with an under resourced and often laid back police force - as an example, in the first episode we have a goat wandering around the local police station, presumably to emphasise the informal nature of the operation. Poole is quite unaffected and goes about business in what one presumes is his normal modus operandi whilst constantly mopping his brow. How he survived the climate decked out in a dark lounge suit without going down with heat exhaustion is quite a mystery in itself!

Murders appear to abound in this tropical paradise. However, it is hard to take it all too seriously between the stereotypical locals and the quintessentially British Poole. I think that some of the plots are so convoluted that they are often more humorous than tense which I imagine is intentional and does make for quite reasonable entertainment. Although in a very different time and setting, Poole's style put me in mind of Poirot - carefully taking everything in and then employing the 'little grey cells' to analyse and pronounce his verdict.

This first season consists of eight episodes and we have a second season and hopefully more to come. The final episode finishes with Poole softening his straightlaced outlook somewhat and being reluctantly set to stay on Sainte-Marie.",1360195200,13,1964,4.874251497005988
4861160,5,B005RVF5XE,"When I was little, I read pretty much the complete works of Agatha Christie--and so the comparison between her usual formula and this show immediately hit home. Quirky detective falls into an interesting story where the clues seem random and the suspects are a tight group of people who all have motive. Then in the final ten minutes, said hero pulls everyone together and reveals all. Kinda like Sherlock Holmes in that regard, except this isn't a show really about intricate plot twists or even the ""clues"" necessarily.

Each episode is a character study, both of the suspects as well as the detective and his three officers (They live on a small island--and this contributes mightily to the whole series, what could otherwise be a boring police procedural turns into something really fresh as there isn't many of the modern police norms that you see in say CSI all the time. But not like in a ""wow they live in dark ages way"",  more like in a ""wow, they have to send the DNA to a bigger island with a real lab and will have to wait on the results for a few days instead of instantly magically knowing."")

This show really works for me. It's similar to Christie's works (which I love). It never gets too dark even when dealing with murder, rape, betrayal etc. The chemistry between the detective and his three police officers is simply delightful (proper English fellow with no social life slowly gets pulled out of his routine yet his officers also really develop a lot of respect/affection for him as well). And between him and his gorgeous police partner--goodness gracious, its the perfect romantic situation where two polar opposites are forced to spend large amounts of time together and then realize that they're not so opposite and actually they kinda might like each other. I sincerely hope this show gets renewed enough to finally see those two kiss or even just hug for that matter.

This is just fun. Not too serious, kinda different yet engaging and with occasional moments of hilarity and real feelings. Would love for this to be released in the US!",1357862400,44,2065,4.71191135734072
4861161,5,B005RVF5XE,"If you ever need a reason to purchase a multi-region DVD player, they don't get any better than this. I purchased this sight-unseen from Amazon UK based on recommendations, and I definitely hit the jackpot with this one.

This is one of those fun, old-fashioned whodunits with twisty plots and clever detectives. None of the grit and darkness and realism you see in most modern cop shows. It is without a doubt a breath of fresh air for those of us who really want to just kick back and ENJOY watching TV.

I watched the eight hour-long episodes over a rainy weekend, and knew I had found a real gem. But the magnitude of how much I enjoyed it didn't hit me until afterwards ... when I kept going over it in my mind, wishing there were more episodes to watch. Rarely have I wanted to put the DVD back in and start over, but this was one of those times.

In a nutshell, the show is about an English detective who is sent to an island in the Caribbean to solve a tricky (read: impossible) murder. In truly predictable fashion, he refuses to stop wearing a suit and tie, complains about the heat, finds a tree growing through his living room and a lizard that keeps popping up, and clashes (initially) with his fellow cops. But he is truly brilliant, solves the case, and promptly gets assigned there permanently, much to his dismay and the sergeant who has to work with him.

It's such a simple, predictable premise it hardly seems likely to work as well as it does - but it does, due in no small part to the talents of the actors. DI Poole is somehow completely likeable, despite his obstinate refusal to ""loosen up"" and his complete lack of social skills. I give Ben Miller full credit for this. His comic timing is perfect, and he manages to be charming even while he's incredibly frustrating. Huge thumbs-up also for Sara Martins, who was previously unknown to me. Flamboyant and belligerent, she manages to be somehow sweet and thoroughly likeable. The ""minor"" characters Dwayne and Fidel are likeable also, and all of them very easy on the eyes. Lots of very well-known British actors make appearances, among them Nicholas Farrell, Colin Salmon, Miranda Raison, Danny Webb, Clare Holman, Rupert Graves, Sarah Smart, Shirley Henderson, and Paterson Joseph. And who can blame them?

Perhaps the real star is the location. Paradise? Personally, watching poor DI Poole sweating and nearly passing out every five minutes doesn't exactly encourage me to visit the Caribbean myself, but it makes a really fantastic backdrop for some very clever whodunits, and provides most of the humor along the way as two very different cultures continue to clash.

I don't know when or if this series is going to be released in the US, but for those of you out there who enjoy good, FUN British mysteries and have (or are thinking of getting) a multi-region player, you really CAN'T go wrong with this. Only buy it direct from the UK, it'll cost you a lot less.

4861173,5,B005RVF5XE,"With Ben Miller as the uptight British detective who is being ""punished"" by being assigned to the beautiful Caribbean Island of 'Saint Marie', this is one of my favorite light detective series ever.  Huge fan of Ben Miller, who isn't?, but the beautiful Camille who is a mixture of casual-beachy, sultry, smart and strong is his perfect foil.  And the supporting deputies are just delightful.

Ben is just miserable there in his beachfront cabin with the sun, heat, sand and humidity....while always wearing a suit and tie, and wingtips.  When Camille convinces him to take off his shoes and socks to wade in that beautiful Caribbean water...his pasty white feet and legs are pretty hilarious.

I am not so enamored with his replacement in later seasons but, to be fair, my love of the perfection of Ben Miller in this role probably clouds my judgment.  The replacement of Camille, Fidel and Dwayne in later seasons has steered me away from this series completely.

A GREAT series!",1499904000,,981,4.873493975903615

4861261,4,B005RVF5XE,"I quite enjoyed this first season (I still have 2 or 3 episodes to go).  Now, part of this series is forced--Ben Miller is very ""professional"" and he wears a suit and tie no matter what the weather is and no matter that there is no air conditioning.

There are two things which I appreciate about this series.  It is not littered with swearing or profanities (I do not recall hearing any, although I could be wrong); and it is reasonably well-plotted.  This is no Agatha Christie (it is not easy to plot out an hour-long tv show week after week), but the plots are reasonably interesting and the characters are fun.

One thing that is a consideration for me is, can you watch this show with your teen?  Will you need to cover their eyes or ears?  Will you be embarrassed to watch it with them?  There is no nudity; there is some adultery and adult situations, but, so far, it is nothing compared to most of the US prime time shows here.

One more thing: the female  co-star is gorgeous and engaging; but she is not overly-sexualized as is found on so many programs today.  She is, of course, counterpoint to Miller's character, but not to a point of being obscene or uncomfortable to watch.",1451779200,,1190,4.43778801843318

4861276,5,B005RVF5XE,"The first two seasons of Death in Paradise are superb.  Ben Miller is a treat playing Detective Poole who would rather not be assigned to the Caribbean.  He is homesick, missing English food, weather, and seasons.  He does like the challenge of a murder investigation, and he comes to like his team.

The team makes the show enjoyable.  Each supporting actor adds a distinct flavor to the show.  Sara Martins is delightful as the smart, beautiful assistant, Camille, who demands respect for her gender and French background.  She is gorgeous but never poses for the camera.  Gary Carr is the studious young officer, Fidel, who works hard to do things right.  With a mere look or gesture, he brings depth to his character.  Danny John-Jules is the resourceful Dwayne Myers, who hardly works.  His brings the lazy 'don't try too hard' style to the show.  It is the Caribbean after all. Don Warrington plays the Commissioner who connives to keep the team intact.  The Commissioner reminds me of Colonel Burkhalter from Hogan's Heroes, always aware of happenings but more into authority than action.  And Warrington plays this part to a T.

In addition to the acting, the show brings gorgeous scenery, upbeat music, ingenious crime detection, and a lizard. The computer-generated lizard is so much fun as the unwanted pet of Detective Poole. Their interactions add sparkle to the show and highlight growth of the main character.  At first he hates the lizard as unnatural.  As he becomes more comfortable (although never fully comfortable) he worries about its care and names it Harry.  I love it.

After Ben Miller left the show at the start of Season 3. The things I loved about the show slowly faded. The team of actors who fit so well together seemed incomplete (and in Season 4 start to leave). The Commissioner doesn't fight for the new guy to stay. The lizard is forgotten.  And, the title ""Death in Paradise"" starts taking on a whole new meaning.

I own the first three seasons and rewatch the first two seasons often. Much like Inspector Lewis, the episodes bring gorgeous scenery, music, and thoughtful teamwork together.  No guns, blood or deviant crimes, just a well-rounded story and good old-fashioned detection. I highly recommend watching Seasons One, Two, and the first episode of Season Three.",1445731200,14,2307,4.906976744186046

4861285,5,B005RVF5XE,"I got hooked on this series just recently and watched it on Netflix. Unfortunately, Netflix showed shorter versions of the episodes and I was furious. Seven minutes or so is a lot and they were essential to the episodes as a whole especially if it involves character development. So I got the DVDs and was happy to re-watch the full versions.

The things I love about this British-French TV series (yes, it's a collaboration and not just BBC) are the actors who played the main characters brilliantly. Mind you, I have no idea who they are before this series (had to read up on them after I watched Season 1 to know more). I just thought their performance and rapport in the series made every episode enjoyable to watch. British comedian Ben Miller is fantastic as DI Richard Poole, the detective character that I can't help compare to Adrian Monk. French actress Sara Martins is gorgeous and smart as DS Camille Bordey, Gary Carr is young and eager as police officer Fidel Best (who, btw, played the jazz singer Jack Ross in Downton Abbey, who knew?) and Danny John-Jules nails it as street smart and ladies' man Dwayne Myers (who, btw, played the Cat in Red Dwarf if you're not familiar with it, Google is your friend). They made a good cast and Season 1 is a very strong start for a murder mystery series that doesn't take itself seriously. I mean, what's not to love? There's the paradise locale, funny cast of characters and intriguing enough whodunnits that will make you want to go barefoot and sip rum cola under the sun.

4861324,3,B005RVF5XE,"Minus two stars because Camille is SO distracting and annoying; she's constantly and contemptuously rolling her eyes at everything Richard says and does. We liked Lenora Crichlow's character Lily SO much more, plus she wore a police uniform instead of a tank top and shorts, had a sweet demeanor, and had a Caribbean accent which was nice. It's too bad she is not the female lead.

Then there's the forced sexual tension between Camille and Richard who have no chemistry. He has way more chemistry with Camille's mother; she's great and not perpetually angry and smug like her daughter. Fidel and Dwayne are the best characters and it would be much better if the show were about them. But I guess they're just thrown in to have SOMEONE who actually seems Caribbean.

The reason to watch this is because the mysteries themselves are decent and not gruesome, like the current trend. And the location is fun.",1432684800,,905,4.794871794871795

4861336,5,B005RVF5XE,"Once again, the sun never sets on great murder mysteries put together by the British. I'm a sucker for these who-done-it shows 'and finding Death in Paradise has been a television treat.

Ben Miller plays DI Richard Poole, a detective sent from Scotland Yard to an island in the middle of the Carribean to investigate the murder of one of their own. Arriving in a suit and tie in scorching weather, he soon starts to complain about the heat, bright sun, terrible food, and a world where there are no seasons.  Just when he thinks he can go home to foggy London and the corner pub for a decent meal of beef and potatoes, his superiors have decided he should stay.

DI Poole is a character who is quite the nerd but a brilliant nerd, who is extremely unpretentious and private about his life and emotions.  He manages a team of three other locals (two men and a woman), all of who are native to the area.  If you can get past their sometimes difficult to understand island accents, their characters will grow on you quickly.  After a few episodes, you will be an expert. Prepare to be immersed in the culture of voodoo, pirate treasures, miracle waters, jabs at the French, abundance of seafood, and a friendly lizard.  Ben Miller is a hoot in his role. You will see a lot of familiar British actors each episode, who have obviously taken roles to enjoy the sunny location.

Dead bodies are discovered with the usual British television lack of gore.  Only an occasional machete or knife in the back, strangled necks, clean shots, and suspicious drownings are seen.  One reason why I love British murder mysteries -- they lack the graphic bloodbath scenes of U.S. television. On BBC, it's a clean kill, and then we get to find out if it's the butler with the candlestick in the library who did the ghastly deed.  DI Poole gathers all the suspects at the scene of the killing.  After bringing out the truth about their individual involvement and secrets, he reveals the killer. There are some pretty good laughs in each episode, too, that add to the entertainment value.

Ben Miller left after season two via a not-too-popular episode bringing in season three, which left a bad taste.  Nevertheless, they didn't ask me to write it on how I would have loved to see him return to his homeland.

His character has been replaced with Kris Marshall.  Kris is fantastic.  I fell in love with that buffoon on My Family (another British comedy great).  I'm sure he does the show justice as it continues to bake in the sun on a sandy beach.

For me, Death in Paradise is an entertaining winner.  With 8 million viewers in the U.K., it appears to be a hit over there too.  Perhaps it's the draw of sandy beaches and sunshine.",1429574400,,2711,4.5484536082474225

I find it very difficult to like the guy and he seems to hate living is paradise....  His partner and the rest of the police department are pretty much worthless.  The chief's boss seems to be so quick to chew him out when he actually solves 100% of the murders on the island...  The partner is a babe (nice to look at), but rarely contributes anything to the solving of the case.  The chief is always the one who puts it all together, so what use is she?  If the chief is really this good, why the heck would England ship him off to an island in the Carribean?  You can't tell me that they are full of investigators who solve 100% of their cases...  After about 5 episodes, it became pretty easy to predict who was guilty.  In the first 5 minutes of each show, watch closely and the murderer is usually the one that you least expect.  Everything became predictable and old very fast.

4861343,3,B005RVF5XE,"If you want to get back to a kinder and gentler world in which nice two-dimensional characters solve murder mysteries in a very formulaic manner, this is a good series to watch. Set not in grimy gloomy London or dirty New York, nor in hilly San Francisco or gritty Marseilles, the formula unwinds pleasantly in balmy Saint Marie (actually the French Caribbean island of Guadaloupe) to a backdrop of shanties and palms waving in the breeze. The script writing is basically on autopilot and there's not much call for anything strenuous in the acting front, but it all rattles along much as if we've been transported back to the ""good cops, naughty villains"" TV crime shows of the 1960s. And just like back in those days, the writer feels no need to do research or strive for authenticity. Hence a metal detector can find a lead bullet, a DI can proclaim that a victim fell unconscious from a bullet graze to the skull because of blood loss, and... well, you get the idea. Spurious nonsense doled out by the ladle-full. It's the sort of thing to watch after a hard day at work when all you want is light entertainment that doesn't require any engagement and offers no surprises. Indeed, by the third or fourth episode most viewers will be familiar enough with the all-is-not-what-it-seems formula to work out whodunit before the Big Reveal and subsequent minute or two of light relief before the credits roll. In other words it's splendid nonsense suitable for all the family and will offend no one.",1428624000,3,1496,4.713740458015267

I got both seasons, and was soon VERY unhappy to learn that Ben Miller would not be continuing in the lead. He's a wonderful actor, and this is one of his best roles ever. All the other characters are equally fun and charismatic, and the plots are excellent. I hardly ever guessed who the bad guy was, not that that's even important since the show is so enjoyable.

4861349,4,B005RVF5XE,"Murder mysteries are a staple of both film and television and have been since forever. So how do you take the old warhorse and and get it to win the big race? Check this out and you'll see.

Here's the scoop. Deputy Inspector Richard Poole (Ben Miller) is from London and is sent to the Caribbean Island of St. Marie because his Island counterpart has been murdered and he needs to solve the case. He hates it there. The heat, sand, lack of good tea et al drives him crazy. The kicker is, that once that has been accomplished he is relegated the post of D.I. on the Island at the behest of the Island's commissioner. Now he needs to make the best of a bad situation.

This is a newer take on an old scenario. The fish out of water bit works well because Poole is an OCD type who insists on wearing a suit, even in the unrelenting heat. The man simply cannot relax, even in these idyllic surroundings. But he's one sharp cookie and manages to solve some remarkably complicated cases. He has a colorful crew to boot. A gorgeous second detective Camille (Sarah Martins) who is real easy on the eyes and, though she is supposed to be sharp as a tack, seems to not contribute as much as one might figure she should. She plays a distant second fiddle to Poole. Then there's Fidel (Gary Carr), the young officer who is dutiful in following orders. Finally there is officer Dwayne Myers (Danny John-Jules) who hangs in loose, likes to party but always steps up to the plate and gets the job done.

Each episode contains a single case. As in the old days of murder mysteries, Poole gathers all the suspects in one place as he runs over the scenario and uncovers the murderer. This is all played on the light side and the cases are generally clever. That is one of the problems. For such a small, lightly inhabited Island, it seems to contain an awful lot of more than clever murderers. I also wish Camille were sharper. I think things would be better if she gave Poole a run for his money. She's wrong way too many times.

This did manage to hook me early on. It's a lot of fun and, though I'm not generally given to this sort of thing, I do find the old brain cells humming to try to figure out where all the clues lead. The writers manage to keep things up going until the last minute. Pop some corn and set yourself up for a good time.",1428278400,,2329,4.286363636363636

Ben Miller is a master at portraying the fish-out-of-water DI Poole, who find himself suddenly stuck on what would be, for anyone else, paradise. Danny John-Jules (whom I last saw in Red Dwarf) is similarly brilliant as Duane, the deceptively laid back policeman who knows more about the island and everything and everyone on it than anyone else. Don Warrington is the perfect police Commissioner,  always hovering in the background, but keeping a close eye on everything and turning a blind eye when appropriate. Sure, it's not exactly realistic- there's an awful lot of murder and intrigue for one little island with one tiny police station- but every show is an hour of sheer entertainment.",1425600000,,792,4.954887218045113

4861378,5,B005RVF5XE,"Although it took  a while for this show to grow on me, I did enjoy it.  DI Richard Poole is sent to the Caribbean to investigate the murder of a fellow police officer.  He HATES everything about the island and finds it very difficult to settle in.  However, he uses his experience and powers of observation to solve the case, only to find that he has been permanently reassigned to his own personal hell on earth.

As someone who grew up on the beaches of central Florida, I can totally sympathize with DI Poole...I hate everything about the beach:  the sand, Sun, heat and especially the humidity.  I also can understand his aversion to the constantly sandry home, tree growing through the middle of his house, and his reptilian roommate!!  This is a lighthearted mystery with humor thrown in .  There is no foul language or nudity and violence and sexual situations are minimal so appropriate for teens as well as adults.
UPDATE:  If you love this show and have only viewed it on Netflix or Amazon VOD, then I would recommend purchasing the DVDs.  On Netflix, each episode is edited down to 52 minutes while on Amazon, each episode is 55 minutes but the episodes on the DVDs are 60 minutes or longer (at least for the first season).  While the deleted scenes don't affect the eventual outcome of the mystery, they do provide some context to the overall story.  I've read some complaints about the closed captioning and I too have noticed the same issues with the CC of season one on Amazon however this is NOT a problem with seasons two and three on Amazon.  For some reason, the CC of season three has been displayed on season one and only started happening recently so hopefully Amazon will fix this.",1424908800,6,1704,4.580858085808581

I'm sooo glad Amazon is offering this show because it didn't last long enough on my PBS station for me to see both seasons. The programmers at PBS don't know a good thing when they see it.

4861416,5,B005RVF5XE,"This British series which combines a sitcom with a crime program is very well done-excellent actors, excellent plot, and excellent panoramic views. The setting is in St. Marie- a Caribbean island in which there are British people. The lead actor, portrayed by Ben Miller, was asked to go to that island to solve crimes involving British citizens. He has to adapt to a completely different culture including the weather. I laugh a lot with the situations presented in each episode. I recommend it to any British program lover.",1418601600,,525,4.9772727272727275
4861417,4,B005RVF5XE,"DEATH IN PARADISE, SEASON 1. This BBC television series, made with the support of the French  Caribbean region of Guadeloupe  and filmed thereis a quintessentially British mystery.  In a light-hearted, humorous crime drama that has been playing on some PBS channels in the United States, stalwart strait-laced Inspector Richard Poole is a fish out of water when Scotland Yard  sends him to the tiny  fictitious-- Caribbean island of Saint Marie to solve the murder of his predecessor.  He does so successfully, then  finds himself seconded to this small hot island. Unfortunately, he hates the sun, sea, sand and seafood. Nor is he suited to the pace of life on the island.

And, at this new post, Poole encounters a very different type of policing than what he is used to: it challenges his more buttoned-up sensibility. His new partner, Camille Bordey, is instinctive, feisty, insightful.  The rest of the  fictional, though I suspect it resembles St. Lucia --Saint Marie police force  two cops!  has their own unique way of doing things in this police procedural. But, though Poole would never admit it, together, they make a perfect team.  The season 1 box set consists of two DVDs, each holding four new mysteries, totaling about 466 minutes of entertainment.  And thank goodness, and the BBC, subtitles, for who would want to miss a moment of this delightful lilting Caribbean-accented dialog.  Though, wonderfully enough, the sound quality is quite good; even I was able to make out the entire dialog, without shaking the house on the volume meter.

The acting is fine, from Ben Miller, PRIMEVAL, playing Detective Inspector Poole, the hapless, yet brilliant detective, to Sara Martins, PARIS, JE TAIME, as his gorgeous new partner Detective Sergeant Borday. Other series members live up to the high acting standards, including Danny Jules-John as Officer Dwayne Myers; Gary Carr as Officer Fidel Best; Elisabeth Bourgine as Catherine, Camilles lovely and charming mother and Don Warrington as Police Commissioner Selwyn Patterson.  Both series are also packed full of new pretty faces, British and Caribbean.  And many, many well-known British stars/supporting players: I clocked, among others Colin Salmon, (PRIME SUSPECT); Adrian Dunbar, (LINE OF DUTY); Robert Pugh, (GAME OF THRONES); Philip Jackson, (POIROT); Sharon Small, (INSPECTOR LYNLEY).  Also Gemma Jones, Joanna David, Julie Graham, Phil Davis, Claire Holman, Cherie Lunghi, Nicholas Farrell, Rupert Graves.

The episodes are:
Arriving in Paradise
DI Richard Poole arrives on the tropical isle of Saint-Marie to investigate the death of a fellow British detective.

Wicked Wedding Night
A bride dies minutes after her wedding.

Predicting Murder
A woman predicts her own murder and describes her killer.

Missing a Body?
A woman confesses to murdering her husband but the lack of a body brings her claim into question.

Spot the Difference
A prisoner is stabbed to death while handcuffed to DI Poole.

An Unhelpful Aid
Dwayne and Fidel have to solve a murder without the help of an ill D.I. Poole.

Music of Murder
A band member is murdered at the band's comeback gig.

Amongst Us
Dwayne is framed for a murder. An homage to Arthur Conan Doyles Sherlock Holmes The Silver Blaze, a short story, famously known for the plot point of the dog that didn't bark in the night, when it should have.

The scenery is, of course, to die for, looking hot-hot-hot on the screen, and I adore the soundtrack, as I have apparently always adored Caribbean music.  You can any time give me an interlude of doing the Rock Steady to Blondies The Tide is High, of which we hear snatches here.  The mysteries: well, they're not down, dirty and depressing in the latest British style, more old-fashioned fun Agatha Christies Marple and Poirot style.  Some might consider them a bit clunky. But rather original, some even unique in my experience.  And Ive been noticing that some of the most charming interludes, local color mostly, have been trimmed from the broadcast versions.  Well worth getting.",1418342400,14,4046,5.100303951367781

4861470,3,B005RVF5XE,"Detective Inspector Richard Poole, a no-nonsense Scotland Yard detective, is loaned to the police of a Caribbean island to help solve a case. Poole arrives on the island wearing a dark business suit, carrying a briefcase, and is unable to hide either his annoyance at having been sent there or his eagerness to wrap up the case and be gone. To Poole's consternation, the local police request, and Scotland Yard grants, an extension of his stay so he can assist with other cases. Will his easy-going colleagues in the local police, and the island's tropical climate and laid-back pace of life lead Poole to ditch the business suit and lighten up? Alas, no, and to the series' detriment, I thought, as increasingly I found his inability to adapt to be gimmicky rather than humorous.

The series' eight one-hour episodes are self-contained cases that are fairly interesting and that have an Agatha Christie feel: they tend to end with Poole gathering the suspects together, dissecting the clues, and identifying the culprit. It's pleasant entertainment, but a tad too family-friendly for my taste.",1411430400,3,1094,5.044198895027624

4861513,5,B005RVF5XE,"Take one uptight, terribly British detective and dump him on an island in the Caribbean. Stir slowly and then add a sexy female detective sergeant (with a French accent), a lizard, a couple of island-born cops and you have what can either be stereotypically stupid or charming.
  ""Death in Paradise"" is charming. The story lines are precise, the acting stops just short of being overdone, there is both drama and comedy with just the tiniest hint of sexual tension between the Brit and his detective sergeant and the locale is both exotic and familiar at the same time.
  I write mysteries for a living and I've found that one of the hardest things about turning an idea into reality (okay, turning an idea into a fictional reality) is the need to avoid the old ""deux ex machina"" trick that playwrights routinely used centuries ago when they couldn't figure out how to get their characters out of untenable situations. Faced with that obstacle they either introduced a last-minute character who saved the day (sometimes this was a god of one sort or another, hence the term) or some improbable leap of deductive reasoning that no one could have made without divine inspiration. ""Death in Paradise"" never falls victim to that trap. The mysteries are solved by sound police work, the knowledge that the detective sergeant and the island-born cops have of a society quite unlike that of London and the Brit detective's experience.
  Looking for a series that's in the best tradition of English mysteries?
  If you are, I urge you to give ""Death in Paradise"" a look. I think you'll like what you see.",1407801600,3,1596,4.799270072992701

4861542,5,B005RVF5XE,"IMPORETANT NOTE: As I post this review there are already 47 reviews posted here. But many are of other versions of this release.  That is because Amazon combines ALL reviews of ALL formats (broadcast TV, Streaming, Non-US region versions and US DVD) when they list the reviews. I always recommend that prospective buyers sort by newest first and then look to see what format is being reviewed. With that said, on to my review of the US DVD release (2014)

Its a good thing that the town of Honore on the French Island of Saint Marie, where this delightful mystery series from the BBCs French Division (Yes, the BBC has a French division as well as one in Ireland and another in ) is a a fictional town on a fictional island, because there are so many folks being murdered there.  In the first season of the series which aired in 2011 in the UK, but just now making its US DVD debut, there were eight murders in the the course of eight episodes.

What makes DIP unique is that, while it takes place in the Caribbean (actually filmed in Guadeloupe), the main character is a British detective who gets transferred there and becomes a fish out of water.

If youve read my other reviews here on Amazon, you will know that I am not a big fan of spoilers  especially mystery series. Too much info takes the fun out of discovering what happened, who did it, and why.  I also never understood why there are lengthy plot summaries for each episode posted. Again, this spoils the fun. So you won't find those in my reviews, yet I hope I can provide some basic info to guide you and my reviews of DVDs are always of the US releases on Bluray and DVD. So with that in mind:

Each of the 8 episodes here runs about 58 minutes.  The series was shown on US TV on regional PBS stations, not nationally, so it was new to me.  If you saw the show on PBS, it was probably edited because they need time for promotional and funding spots. But there is no nudity or strong language or graphic violence more than is usually shown on PBS.

The lead character  played by Britisher Ben Miller  is sort of a hybrid (in my opinion) of David Frost and John Cleese. They play up his need for a suit and tie (when its always in the 90s) or a regular cup of HOT tea. Miller is great, especially if you enjoy British humor.

For each episode, there is a murder in the first few minutes and it is solved by the end. The private lives of Millers character and his police team are covered too, and this creates a thread through all episodes. While  and I hope this is not a real spoiler  the series continued into for at least four series (Im not saying any more about that!), this series ends with all the loose ends tied up. No annoying cliff hangers  to deal with.  I really appreciated that!
The DVD set in the US has English subtitle option but  unlike many British mystery DVDs, I didn't have any problem understanding every word and the characters do not have heavy accents. There are no bonus features on this set either, though a short one with the cast might have been fun.

This series was a nice change of pace from some of there darker crime series Ive been watching and there is a lot of friendly humor here. Im glad I found it and am hoping that BBC Home Video moves up the release dates for the next couple of seasons. Im really looking forward to them

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

4861545,5,B005RVF5XE,"A little gem of a series.  Don't bother following the case, its fine and workable, but this is not Sherlock, it's much lighter than that.  Just enjoy the people and setting, and how the cast really seems to be having a great time.

Has many guest stars you will recognize from current shows, and a really cool Lizard.  One reviewer stated that some scenes have been trimmed, and it kind of plays that way, a little choppy and light in the content, but this show is rare in that it does the job of providing pure entertainment without ugliness. I'm not Just talking about language, there isn't any bad, but I care more about how the characters are designed, fun loving happy people that try very hard not to hurt others feelings. Nice Human people, you will want to move to this island!.

 This is Light  entertainment at the end of the day,  to bring a little sunshine into your life.  Not bad sit com junk, filled with embarrassing situations,  and selfishness,  but cute little stories,  with a lovable cast.

Watch the pilot, as always if you like the lead, you will love the show.  Lately American shows have been casting  supporting actors as series leads that are not up to the task. , This guy has the depth of talent and charisma to keep you interested. Our guy is stiff, but has a big heart, and goes along with things , even when he doesn't want to,  as not to be mean. The SD is  low quality, but still beautiful to watch.  I'm thinking about doing something I never do, buy the DVD to get the whole show,  in good quality as the locations, photography are fantastic. I'm falling in Love with this show, can you tell?",1404864000,3,1628,4.402684563758389

4861548,5,B005RVF5XE,"It's the small Caribbean Island of St. Marie, hot and sultry. In the city of Honor, Lord and Lady Solcombe are holding a pool party at their mansion. All of a sudden, a shot cuts the air. Then an alarm rings. Cut to the Honor police station, where a constable takes a call and tells his coworker that the Solcombe ""panic room's gone into lockdown. We've got the codes to open it in our safe.""

They rush to the house and open the room, only to find the British Chief Detective, their boss, dead on the floor from a bullet. But there's no gun in the room, and no way in or out that wasn't locked down tight.

A new temporary Chief Detective is needed, and the London Met sends Richard Poole. Poole makes it clear that this is a temporary assignment, as the sun is too bright, the beach too sandy, the heat too brutal, the police station too antiquated, and, worst of all, about 30% of the people and lots of the culture is still French, from when the island was a French colony. What's an Englander to do? Well, for one thing he insists on wearing his wool suit, buttoned up, shirt and tie and polished shoes. When he has time, he searches for a decent cup of tea.

Poole may be initially pedantic and inflexible, but he is also a brilliant policeman. In the first episode, he solves his predecessor's murder. By the end of the 1st season, he and his 3-person staff have learned to appreciate each other and work together well. There are lots of comedic moments as well as good mysteries, and the recurring characters are wonderfully portrayed. The series is filmed on the island of Guadalupe, in the Caribbean's Lesser Antilles, and its vibrant culture is like a fourth cast member.

This series is EXCELLENT viewing, highly recommended. The biggest question is - where did they find a lizard with such great acting skills? When you're done with Season 1, start in immediately with Season 2. That's what we did!

Season 1 premiered on air in England in October 2011, and took until January 2013 to air in the U.S. There are 8 episodes for a total run time of 466 minutes. It's presented in 16:9 aspect ratio with English subtitles. The show as aired did not have episode names shown, nor do the DVDs. For convenience, I'll give the episodes title names that are popularly used.

The Season 1 DVD set has no bonus extras, which is a real shame. You get two DVD discs with four episodes each.

PART ONE: Arriving in Paradise.
Poole asks the police sergeant to describe the murdered detective. She replies, ""Not your typical Englishman. You know, charismatic.""
Trivia: To explain a MET police officer on the island, they have St Marie be a British territory. However, it's filmed on Guadalupe, a real island that is a French territory. So, vehicle drivers are on the left.

PART TWO: Wicked Wedding Night
Dan and Lisa have a beach wedding at a big resort on St. Marie. Unfortunately, the bride shortly afterwards falls from a 5-story hotel balcony, skewered by a spear gun. Poole's personality and culture clashes are a real irritant to his staff.

PART THREE: Predicting Murder
After dark. Dwayne (Constable Myers) and a lady friend join a group sitting around a fire pit on the beach. An elderly woman stands next to the fire and speaks with a style to raise the hair on the back on your neck - and that's watching it safe from your living room. The party breaks up when she scares everyone with her last words: ""The scarred man... He's coming... He's a killer... He's killed before... Silence me. I'm to be murdered. I'm to be MURDERED!""
The next day, our heroes are called to a school, closed for break, where an old woman has been killed by cyanide. Yes, it's the same woman as the night before. The Voodoo connection/prophecy makes the very British Poole most uncomfortable. Even when the school headmaster turns out to be the victim's son-in-law. With a scar on his cheek.
Detective Camille to Poole: ""You are the most annoying man I have ever met.""
Poole: ""Well, it's a small island.""

PART FOUR: Missing a Body?
On a dark beach, a man sneers, ""You haven't got the guts. Little mousy Megan. If people only knew. That gun's not even lo...""
And the woman holding the pistol shoots him.
The next morning, after spending the night collapsed near a pier, she wanders into the Honor station, saying, ""Can someone help me? It's my husband. He's dead. I shot him.""
Unfortunately, when they take her back to the beach, there's no body. The normally stern Poole almost melts into a puddle at her feet, Megan is so sweet and innocent and soft-spoken. riiiiiiiight!

PART FIVE: Spot the Difference
St. Marie is too small for an airport. People fly into the near bigger island, Guadalupe, and then take a ferry to St. Marie. Poole is at the Guadalupe airport to meet Vincent Carter, prison guard, and Leon Hamilton, prisoner. Hamilton is to serve the last part of his prison sentence on St. Marie, the place where he defrauded hundreds of people. Poole takes custody of Hamilton by being handcuffed to him, though, to be safe, Carter will escort them to the Honor jail.
Unfortunately, there's a little problem on the ferry, as the Commissioner later booms to the humiliated Poole: ""I could understand if he was secretly poisoned. In fact, secretly anything. I could even forgive a gunshot from another boat or a jet-ski or a helicopter. But no. A knife was plunged into his back while YOU were standing next to him, JOINED at the wrists!""

PART SIX: An Unhelpful Aid
Camille is in Paris on an IT course. Poole has come down with tropical fever. It's up to Constables Dwayne and Fidel to figure out how a scuba diver drowned in a few feet of water. This episode has some great comedy with the feverish Poole insisting that he still can work.
Trivia: Sara Martins, who plays Camille, was originally a bigger part of the script. Unfortunately, she had an injury and missed most of the filming.

PART SEVEN: Music of Murder
Camille and Dwayne have dragged Poole to the biggest musical event of the year. The group, The Venerators, hasn't been on stage for 10 years, and this is their big come-back. The excitement is crazy, so crazy that Poole attempts unsuccessfully to escape. But at last, the show is about to start. Just like in the old days, the charismatic lead singer is carried in, inside a closed and decorated coffin. The crowd cheers as the coffin is set upright on the stage, opened, and there he is, in his dance of death make-up. But something's wrong. He's not moving. For a good reason - there's a bullet hole in his temple. Good thing Camille forced Poole to stay.

PART EIGHT: Amongst Us
It's a balmy evening, and Poole is relaxing at home in his jammies, doing a crossword with the lizard. In the meanwhile, Dwayne, the charmer, picks up a woman at a bar and walks her home. She invites him in for coffee and this leads to that, etc.
Unfortunately, the next morning, her neighbor finds her dead, lying in bed with coins stuffed into her mouth. And Dwayne's police badge under the bed.
Other clues point to Dwayne, too, and Poole is hard pressed to figure out who is framing his constable.

Trivia: I didn't want to believe it, but Harry the Lizard is 100% CGI. I'm heartbroken.

This is a great series with lots of humor and heart and well-plotted mysteries.

One star is because it isn't the whole show. Scenes that are present in the DVD version are missing on amazon's streaming version. I can't tell you how disappointed I am. When I buy a movie or a tv show I want to see the WHOLE show.",1403827200,17,353,3.9027777777777777

I love it that the main character is brilliant, socially inept, yet still a caring human being, learning as he goes.  He's a bit cranky from home sickness, but soldiers on, solving cases as best he can and taking small risks as he slowly adjusts to his new environment and co-workers.  The supporting cast is fun and although bewildered by their new boss, they do their best to help him adjust.  This is a great team, with lots of rapport and loyalty toward one another.  (They give you the feeling that they all hang out together after a day's shooting is done!)  I'm looking forward to the second season.",1403222400,2,717,4.5546875
4861556,5,B005RVF5XE,"I love this show and have been waiting for it for almost a year. Thrilled to finally have it. However, the box was crushed, the cardboard sleeve bent badly, and so was the case itself. Fortunately, the DVDs were not damaged. So, I recommend this for the series which is great fun, but watch that packaging!

There are 8 perfect episodes in the box and I am now extremely pleased with the set. Just can't hardly wait to get the 2nd season order!!!

Update 8/17/2014
Taking 1 star off of the original rating due to the fact that it has become obvious to us that the aspect ratio is not as in the original TV series. You may begin to notice that people and things tend to be taller and thinner than they should be.",1403136000,3,619,4.201680672268908
4861558,5,B005RVF5XE,I found this wonderful show and I just cannot get enough of it. Everyone in the cast is marvelous. What humor and a really good story line for all. I love all the human interaction and good ole police work to get that bad guy. It is not predictable and it is really nice to see how it all gets solved. Goodness why would anyone want to leave the cast? Oh well hope it stays as fun and interesting no matter who they cast. Thanks guys you are all great (cast). ;-D,1389916800,,463,4.043478260869565

4861560,5,B005RVF5XE,"PBS picked it up and I am so glad! This is a wonderful Saturday night show, I totally agree with the other reviewers a lighthearted version of Poirot with more humor and tropical vistas!
I wish all the CSIs (that I don't watch but that abund in prime time TV ) would stop trying to outdo the gore and bring in some humor for once! The problem lays in the acting too, all the ""pretty faces"" that can't deliver a pun!
By contrast a low keyed Danny John-Jules ( remember Cat from Red Dwarf anyone?!) ,is great to watch in his exchanges with Gary Carr as the local police.
And can I say enough about Ben Miller? He is superb, he makes the show possible and carries it brilliantly! Just watch the way he can be incredibily funny, inspire awe and be completely pathetic at the same time! All with a very British stiff upper lip!
Watch him wearing those suits on the beach!
I noticed him in Primeval, then in Doc Martin, Johnny English, etc... Now I can't get enough of him, there is something about the way he keeps his face straight as he delivers the quirkiest things ever! It was about time he got a show to revolve around him, he can definitely step up to the challenge.
It is great that PBS is offering now the US version!
I am disappointed that Ben Miller is leaving the series, I am not sure of what will become of it without him!",1389571200,5,1331,4.244094488188976

death in paradise's humor is sometimes subtle and, then wham, I am falling on the floor.  I have seen both seasons and it has not slacked.  from what I gather from the bbc grapevine, death in paradise will return for a third season but ben miller WILL NOT be among the cast.  I will watch the first show to see how they pull that off!

4861568,5,B005RVF5XE,"You would have thought that police series have been done from every conceivable angle over the years, and it is almost an achievement in itself to come up with one which is at all out of the ordinary. However, the script writers have managed to achieve just that with Death in Paradise which is quite an offbeat drama. The series is set on the fictional Caribbean island of Sainte-Marie, but was in fact filmed in Guadeloupe.

Episode 1 sees DI Richard Poole of the UK Metropolitan Police seconded to the exotic island from less than exotic London suburb of Croydon, to assist the local police in investigating the murder of an ex pat detective. We quickly get the Caribbean flavour of the island with an under resourced and often laid back police force - as an example, in the first episode we have a goat wandering around the local police station, presumably to emphasise the informal nature of the operation. Poole is quite unaffected and goes about business in what one presumes is his normal modus operandi whilst constantly mopping his brow. How he survived the climate decked out in a dark lounge suit without going down with heat exhaustion is quite a mystery in itself!

Murders appear to abound in this tropical paradise. However, it is hard to take it all too seriously between the stereotypical locals and the quintessentially British Poole. I think that some of the plots are so convoluted that they are often more humorous than tense which I imagine is intentional and does make for quite reasonable entertainment. Although in a very different time and setting, Poole's style put me in mind of Poirot - carefully taking everything in and then employing the 'little grey cells' to analyse and pronounce his verdict.

This first season consists of eight episodes and we have a second season and hopefully more to come. The final episode finishes with Poole softening his straightlaced outlook somewhat and being reluctantly set to stay on Sainte-Marie.  Its really good news that these are now being produced in Region 1 North American format.",1379980800,6,2055,4.862857142857143

4861570,5,B005RVF5XE,"Who is an excellent comic, shines in this series; his side kicks are also very good. All-in-all, the whole enterprise is very funny despite the fact that they are about murder investigations. Ben Miller can make anything funny and great.",1378252800,,237,4.95
4861571,5,B005RVF5XE,"Perhaps THE best and freshest mystery I've seen.  Wit, humor, murder and puzzles galore.  I like a dialog that keeps me guessing, and with this show, you seldom see the responses coming.  For instance:  Camile says with teeth gritting frustration ""You are the most annoying man I have ever met!"" and Richard responds, ""It's a very small island.""  You do not get this unpredictability in US shows, at least not since Bob Newhart.  The only predictable thing about the show is that Richard will figure it out and nab another killer at the end.  I cannot believe they would not make a third and fourth and fifth season of shows.  I will be very sad if they stop at two seasons.",1377993600,,674,4.512396694214876
4861572,4,B005RVF5XE,"I happened across Death in Paradise on one of the local PBS station late one night and that was it. I was hooked. I'm actually surprised it's not on BBC America.

At its essence it's a police procedural but it is refreshingly different. Not just from US shows but from most UK police shows as well. While it is not a comedy it is done with tongue squarely in cheek.

Ben Miller is perfect as the stayed, proper Englishman on a laid back Caribbean Island working with folks who's personalities are the polar opposite of his own. I was sorry to read that he will be leaving the show next season.

In any case I will definitely be adding set to my collection when it becomes available.",1376956800,31,682,4.354330708661418

4861577,5,B005RVF5XE,"I am a great fan of BBC productions and this is one of my favorites.  I purchased an all-region player just so I can watch this and it was so worth it.  The stories are light, amusing and very picturesque - the Caribbean locale is an authentic island (Guadaloupe, I think) with the fictional name of Sainte Marie, and is so pretty it makes me want to book a flight south every time I watch this.  The stories are basically modern day Agatha Christie who-done-its, with the usual murder, round of suspects, clues and observations before solving the seemingly impossible crime, which Detective Richard Poole does brilliantly.  Richard is a London transplant that is completely out of place in the sun, sea and sand of Sainte Marie...or is he? There is a smoldering relationship between Camille Bordey, his beautiful assistant, and Richard that is charming and refreshing, but never corny.  Their relationship Is ever evolving as the series progresses- who knows how it will end - we can only hope that it works out for them.
