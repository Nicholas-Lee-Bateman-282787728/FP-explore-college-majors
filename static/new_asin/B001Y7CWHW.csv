8347969,1,B001Y7CWHW,"Save your money, and your 40 minutes. This is hardly an odyssey. Stock footage and b-roll, albeit in hi def, cut together with interviews of a creepy foreign guy who I think is ACTUALLY in love with a shark. Blah blah blah, it sucks, waste your money elsewhere.",1368835200,,261,4.458333333333333
8347970,4,B001Y7CWHW,"I enjoyed this documentary and I wish their were more series like this out there. I don't believe it's a good idea to give a totally wild shark a name like Nicole, because it was not a personal pet. That's one of the few negatives, I can think of about this movie. This documentary also shows the other negative cruel inhuman treatment of sharks, with shark fin hunters that catch sharks to remove the fins, and throw about 95% of the dying, struggling, fish body back into the ocean to drown.

At times I also knew they used a second shark, because the white  marking on the underbelly of the sharks were different if you did not pay close attention. I have always liked the Great White Shark, because of their famous cute grin. This movie is a good family adventure, and education. Since the movie Jaws aired in 1975 Sharks have been given a bad rap, to create fear and a justification to indiscriminately kill them.",1314748800,2,918,4.491017964071856
8347971,5,B001Y7CWHW,"This is a great DVD -- it's the journey of ""Nicole,"" a great white shark in Australia.  It's a wonderful and beautiful tale, well made, and the viewer will definitely enjoy it.  I recommend it to any shark, aquatic or nature lover.",1282867200,2,231,4.476190476190476
8347972,2,B001Y7CWHW,"This is a Disney-like 'documentary' from the NG Channel, in which a cute, nubile female shark named 'Nicole' exhibits rogue behavior in the seas of South Africa, and is tagged by her jealous, scientific admirer who wants to know why she leaves him for 6 months a year.

I must admit, I was 'hooked' when I saw the footage that suggests that Nicole was letting herself be 'petted' by her hunky scientist, maybe a trick of the cameras. But, as the video progressed, it was clear that the cameramen  had only filmed Nicole in the water before and during her tagging (as well as a bit upon her return), and, through the editing process, sought to create the impression that they followed her on her migratory journey. What ensues is an embarrassing assortment of CGI recreations of bioluminescent creatures and stock footage of humpback whales, all designed to give color to Nicole's journey to the Australian continent.  The cameras didn't follow her, and they weren't there when she arrived. (No shot of her shows the tag after the start of the journey.)  And, as also 'filmed', the tag just ejects itself from her body, the cause of which is not questioned.  The scientists just seem to accept it as standard...

Drama above all!  There are questions as to why she dives so deep at a certain point, and why she heads to Australia, but these go unanswered.  (Sex with better-gened partners is suggested as a possible motivator for the migration.) We also get some stock footage of Nicole's stand-in eating a seal and a duck, and are shown the dangers for a top-of-the-food-chain-predator in the unprotected waters outside of South Africa, the greatest of which is the threat of becoming soup for the Asian shark fin hunters (truly the scum of the earth).

I was so relieved (really!) to know that Nicole returned to her SA waters that summer, after the Australian migration.  But then the narrator, as well as Nicole's admirer proceed to tell us, matter-of-factly, that she was never spotted again afterwards. For me it was like Bambi's mother and Old Yeller and Thomasina all combined! Nicole, are you still with us?",1258070400,8,2115,4.785714285714286
