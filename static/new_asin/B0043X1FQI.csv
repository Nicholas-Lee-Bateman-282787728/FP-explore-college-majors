8415400,3,B0043X1FQI,"Two concerts from the seventies (and not from 1964 as the coverphoto) with brass and doagirls. Ray Davies, always a charismatic and enthusiastisc spearhead, leads the ensamble through a slice of his fab material (the exeption is when Dave raves through ""Good Golly Miss Molly""). Of course its joyfull but the material deserves  better treatment. The overall impression is a band quite erratic, untight and dissipate. Maybe they didn't really know what they where at the time: a rockband, a music-hall orchestra or a theatergroup. Some songs gets the throwaway-treatment (like ""Dedicated Follower Of Fashion""), one song gets the theatre-treatment (""The Hard Way"") and even thou I appreciate Rays dramatic radiation in ""Alcohol"" they just skip the relieving hornsolo from the studioversion. A sin!

 The point Im making gets very clear when The Kinks in ONE song gets everything right: ""The Village Green Preservation Society"". Here there is focus, they take care of the potential of the tune and the brothers sings so fair and beautiful its absolutely warming. The whole ensamble with horns and choir falls to the right places. A revelation god damn it! You could hear it in the audience reaction. And now when its getting real fun and they just start to play ""Village Green"" the concert is cut off! A crime of culture! Give us the rest of the show right now please!
