8337223,4,B001R23GFQ,"At first glance, THE OUTSIDER documents the creation of a $2 milion film in less than two weeks, a movie that in fact had only a partial script and was greatly improvised by its cast. We also witness the struggles its creator has in getting his movie distributed. Conversely, this 84 minute study can be interpreted as a ""making of"" infomercial for writer/director James Toback's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WHEN-WILL-I-BE-LOVED/dp/B0006HC00U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WHEN WILL I BE LOVED</a>&nbsp;(2004).

Toback's spotty track record as an independent producer/director doesn't indicate brilliance, yet he's greatly respected by his contemporaries. Best known for writing Warren Beatty's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BUGSY/dp/B000H5TH20/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BUGSY</a>&nbsp;(1991), as a director the gambling-addicted Toback can be unorthodox and overbearing, according to some who comment here. Toback's writing class background betrays him, for at times during interviews he seems to be delivering a Filmmaking 101 lecture.

One thing is certain. Nick Jarecki, who took eight months creating ""The Outsider,"" is an unabashed James Toback admirer. He somehow manages to downplay Toback's numerous shortcomings, presenting him instead as a precocious genius. There's enough pro-Toback commentary here from very familiar faces to support Jarecki's premise.
