8218378,2,B000VE4UI8,"I need to learn precalculus for a CLEP exam and gave this a try. Its not for the serious learner at all. The skits are really over the top and in between them they put out a problem that they solve so quickly without explaining how they got the answer. If you really need to be taught the subject and not entertained I recommend something else. Maybe this is for some people, but not the really serious that really need more instruction and less drama.",1329868800,5,452,4.329411764705882
