8151449,5,B000JK8O86,"As parents of a 2 year old boy, 4 year old girl and a 7 year old girl

we are always looking for DVDs that educate and have age appropriate

content for our children. ""Bees Buzz & Lions Roar: A World of Animals

Just for You!"" is perfect for our kids in that it presents a variety of

animals from around the world, each matched to a letter of the alphabet

and a variety of beautifully illustrated stories. Each section of the

DVD is colorful with excellent animation and illustrations and the

narration quality and sounds are top-notch. Unlike other DVDs that

present too much too fast, this DVD is perfectly paced allowing our

kids to quickly process each part in to their memories. They later

recall the alphabet, animals and stories easily and accurately when

away from our TV. We have found that watching it often, either on the

road or at home, helps reinforce the learning experience. We are always

exploring the Spanish version bundled on the same DVD allowing our

family to learn another extremely valuable language. We recommend this

DVD highly to anyone with kids of all ages 1-100!",1161734400,,1104,4.647668393782383
8151450,5,B000JK8O86,Both my 1 year old and 3 year old daughters love this DVD.  They love the graphics and the voices used.  It is rare to find a DVD that entertains both of them.  I highly recommend it!,1161561600,,183,3.891891891891892
8151451,5,B000JK8O86,"My 3 year old son can't get enough of this DVD!  The animations are beautifully rendered and colorful which adds to my son's delight and they're all about animals which he loves.  Professional voice overs and music add to the production value of this title.  The layout, use of icons, colors and geometric and organic shapes are well executed.  It is obvious that a lot of thought went into the production of this title and is appropriate for children of all ages.  It is a bilingual DVD (English and Spanish) which is great as it exposes my son to another language in an entertaining setting.  Well designed with animal sounds, fun facts, animal alphabet, stories and more.  This DVD has merit and educational value while being entertaining for my son.  That is not a combination that is easy to find.  I highly recommend it and I don't take the time to write many reviews.  We look forward to the next title.",1160611200,,910,4.596273291925466
