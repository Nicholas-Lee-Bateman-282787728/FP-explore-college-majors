8325602,4,B000PC72H2,"East Wind is a very entertaining documentary with lots of extras and certainly worth the money.  If you like paragliding stories, you won't go wrong with this.  What I really liked was that I could choose to have it ""burned"" to order.  There are lots of short films out there that I wish would investigate this new service.  It worked flawlessly !  I'm glad I bought it !",1360108800,,371,4.397058823529412
8325603,5,B000PC72H2,I feel this will give you a insight of what it will be like to own a flyke .  This does not cover some aspects of powered paragliding related stuff but is definitely a good dvd to have .  I have several dvd paragliding movies and I get something different from each . I have no regrets about buying this dvd and would reccomend it to others .,1285977600,,342,4.014705882352941

Generally I used to delivered all my previouse order within 10 to 12 days after it was shiped. I don't know why this time it's taking so long and the estimate delivery was on 29th July 2008.
