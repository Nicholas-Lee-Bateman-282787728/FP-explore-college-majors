1853042,5,B00008MTXJ,"We had seen this movie many years ago when it aired on TV and had missed one or two parts of it. Really glad to be able to get this DVD. Fantastic ""true story"" and an almost unbelievable event that lasted more than 20 years. I would recommend this dvd to everyone as it shows how a seemingly ordinary family at first, could all become part of such criminal espionage against their own country. You'll have to purchase the dvd and set aside a couple of hours for a truly engrossing experience as you watch in amazement at how the whole plot unfolds and ends. One of my all time favorite movies and excited that I could actually purchase it online, because believe me, you would not be able to find this in any of your local dvd stores or any retail store for that matter. Buy it today, and if you're like us, you'll tempted to view it more than once.",1338508800,10,849,4.246913580246914

Family of spies illustrates how greed, lust for power and betrayal of ones country can do to a family, ones country and public opinion of our nations( Naval )security systems.

1853046,3,B00008MTXJ,"Having essayed at least two books on the Walker family spy ring, I found this TV mini-series historically suspect in the finest tradition of ""made for TV movies"", and yet surprisingly entertaining.

WHO THE WALKERS WERE: Though referred to as a case of a family of spies, much of the work was really done by patriarch Johnny Walker, a naval cryptologist whose access to USN code keys and related material allowed him to inflict damage against the US military.  From 1968 at least until the mid 1980's, Walker turned over volumes of classified encryption material to his Soviet handlers - a career that began when he approached the Russian embassy in 1968.  Never arousing much suspicion from his supervisors, Walker left the Navy fearing a routine background check might uncover his treason.  (He also feared that his wife would turn him in, and he was unluckily dead-on in that respect.)  Though initially motivated by desperate finances, Walker underpriced his product - clearing a million dollars only near the end of his 17-year career.  Before leaving the Navy, and after being reassigned to an area lacking access to sensitive and lucrative cipher material, Walker recruited Jerry Alfred Whitworth - a naval communications specialist - to carry on his end of the business.  Though a weak character, Whitworth is a superb spy, who excels largely because he willingly served in high security areas like Diego Garcia - an unpopular spit in the Indian Ocean reviled by those who serve there, but also possessing strategic importance to the Americans.  Walker's brother Arthur, who worked for a defense contractor after leaving the Navy, also provided some classified material.  Walker successfully recruited his son as well.  Michael Walker had only recently begun collecting classified material as a sailor on an aircraft carrier when he was seized by investigators.  Though Michael and Arthur could have matured into prolific suppliers of classified material, Whitworth was likely Johnny Walker's most important partner.  Walker's wife, long aware of her husband's espionage, alternated between silent compliance and threats to betray him.  Ultimately she did approach the FBI, sealing the Walker spy ring's fate.  Until then, the Soviet's made the most of their access to America's encrypted communications - mostly shadowing military units like carrier battle groups.  American military planners grew frustrated as Soviet forces became perennial spectators of allied war games prepared and executed in apparent secrecy.  The prospect of treason, however, was never seriously considered - treason is something people in other (read: communist) countries do.

THIS FLICK ROCKS: because it looks more like a parody of the Walker spy saga and fact-based movies in general.  Though Walker was a treasonous weasel, Powers Boothe plays him as a darkly charismatic manipulator, one who wraps attractive women around his finger like James Bond.  Even more outrageous are elaborate sequences in which US Naval strategists determine that they've been compromised.  (In this version, high-tech American subs are tracked by unsophisticated Russian subs - leading analysts no choice but to conclude that the Soviets have broken their codes.)  While the above may one day prove to have been true, it currently clashes with known accounts in which the Americans disregarded clues of Russian code-breaking (Soviet technology lacked the computing horsepower to break codes on their own, and of course nobody wanted to believe that one of our own had turned on us.)  In short, it's fun if you've read the true story and can point out where actual treason becomes fun TV.",1106784000,33,3657,5.268965517241379

1853106,4,B00008MTXJ,"I was interested in finding Walker's motivation and how he got away with it for so long.  The movie answers that.  It also shows how he recruited family and friends.  Artistically, it's a 70's / early 80's style movie ala ""Columbo"".  Cardboard sets, acting, and general production, but it does the job.  Very slow beginning and could have shown more of the spycraft both for general interest and artistic suspense.  The last half was much better.  Unfortunately, the topic itself - the betrayal for nothing but greed - is difficult to watch.",1480291200,,541,4.815217391304348

1853111,5,B00008MTXJ,"This has is it all.  A true story.  A guy that sells his soul and that of his family members - grossly mistreating those closest to him.  Espionage. KGB + the Russians.  Deceit + Patriotism.  The 'feel' of the late 80s while the story takes you from the 60s+70s.  A long enough work to dive into what drives someone to engage in such drastic measures and somehow find a way to justify it, making it seem 'normal'.  A business of selling secrets with little or no philosophical motive whatsoever.  This is definitely based on fact - if you want more information the Navy made a cautionary instructional video - just search for: THE WALKER SPY RING - LESSONS LEARNED.  I wasn't expecting much, and while cringing at so much awful behavior, I guess that was a sign that the film is compelling.  I feel so sorry for the son.  He certainly committed a crime but was led astray by his father, reaped little benefit, and paid a severe price so early in life.",1475798400,3,951,4.4393063583815024

1853177,3,B00008MTXJ,"I normally like Powers Booth.  He brings a certain understated element to his movies, but this seemingly made for TV piece was not up to his capability. The story was interesting, but rather doubt the simplistic premise as Walker going to the Soviet Embassy in DC and saying I want money and have secrets to sell. This was a time before the Internet. Access to classified information was not as capricious as the movie would suggest. Everyone was checked and CIA/NRO data/codes were not as available as the movie would suggest.  Also they called Booth ""Chief"" several times, while his uniform said Warrant Officer.  While the movie was based on fact, it did not do justice to the actual story.

Hopefully at some point this movie will be made better..............",1458086400,,763,4.846153846153846

I won't spoil the ending, but the only reason they got caught was not due to internal security measures.
