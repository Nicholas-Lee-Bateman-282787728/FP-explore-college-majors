4674148,4,B005FHXHGM,My children love moesha because of the comedy. My son and oldest daughter said they can relate to Moesha and Myles and I like how I teaches moral lessons in mostly every episode.

4674177,5,B005FHXHGM,"I love this series. Like someone said it IS a bit pricey for only 1 season but I'm glad I have it. I'm actually watching right now :)I wish they played the original songs in this series. Part of the reason why I LOVED Moesha was the music. but it's cool! At least the guest performers actually perform their original songs so it's all good. I enjoy the trip down memory lane.

4674202,5,B005FHXHGM,I love the earlier seasons of this show and was glad that they finally decide to release on DVD. The last season when they was making all those changes lost the appeal to me. It lost it originality. But the first seasons were great. It was different from other sitcoms and i enjoyed watching the show.  Looking forward to getting the other seasons to add to my collection.,1318032000,12,372,4.470588235294118
4674203,5,B005FHXHGM,"I was 6 yrs old when this show graced my television set..
I had no idea the impact it would cause.. the fact that im a young black male in America that has so much to look forward to, yet so much against me.. this was one of the shows that helped me escape all of that for a while..
i really dug into the characters like I actually knew them..

Moesha: she really reminds me of my cousin I grew up with.. so I felt very connected to her character. she's has a magnetic, one of a kind personality. she carries bookooz of knowledge that she doesn't mind vocalizing. she cares about her family & friends, but she's very head strong & see things in a different light, unlike most - which brings her at odds with her love ones sumtimes.

Kim: she like an around the way, LOUD MOUTH, 'oooooooh I know u didn't' kinduh girl.. she's mad funny & brings A LOT of life to the show, like a comic relief. she trips me out crushing on Hakeem, stalking & annoying him all the time.. she can sing her ass off & bottles bookoo of hidden talents. she's kinduh one of those girls where u have to bring your A-GAME, personality wise when you're around her, cuz hers will run all over u if u don't.. she should've been had her own show!! MUCH LOVE COUNTESS AKA KiM!!

Hakeem: he's like a homeboy you've known all your life, that's always at your crib & stays in your refrigerator. he's around so much you consider him as apart of the family & it took me by suprise when he & Moesha fell for each other & eventually got together.. but it made the show more realistic, because sometimes thats what happens with different sex childhood friends. he also brought comic relief to the show.. R.I.P. Lamont Bentley

Niecey: she's a girl a lot a ppl can relate to.. she's also a ghetto female who cannot keep water, so dnt tell her your business.. or something you dnt want the world to know.. other than that, she real kool & when her & kim join forces it is comedy heaven. LOL

Frank: he's a very protective, devoted father & husband..  he can be a little suffocating towards Moesha & in my opinion, he takes Dee's side everytime she & Mo have a stand off moment & he plays the role of perfection a little too often.. but that all dwindles down when his past comes back to haunt him, revealing his closest full of secrets & lies.. but that also makes the show more relatable to everyday life & makes Frank a little more human & it makes a statement that we all make mistakes & should be given the chance to redeem ourselves.

Dee: she's a beautiful, strong willed & trying stepmother & wife.
she tries very hard to pull & hold her own as the woman of the house, even if that means wrecking Mo's program.. I must admit, i didn't like her at first.. but she shows promise & loyalty to the Mitchells well being & we ALL eventually accept her into our hearts.

Miles: he's the adorable, annoying, yet humorous & full of life little brother of Mo.. he's never up to no good & always has prank or something up his sleave.. he's a snitch.. but he's kool at the end of the day with me.. he knows how to dance & keep the show rolling & his impressions of Michael Jackson are classic

Andell: she's another comic relief, she's an adult who understands the life of adolescence & the youth of today.. that's why Mo & the gang confide & depend on her alot for support & advice.. SHE KEEPS iT REAL!

Q: he's Moesha's first real love.. Quentin is obviously not the boy next door & he has mad thug appeal.. but is proven to be a legit, stand up guy that is constantly put in a bad situation with Mo's father, who won't give Q the chance to earn his blessing to date Moesha. Frank's forbidden laws push Q & Mo closer together.. im not gone front, i didn't wanna see them make it either, but they made magic happen with the chemistry they shared together.

Dorian: he's first portrayed as Moesha's troubled cousin, but later It's revealed that he's Frank's son that was conceived in Frank's infidelity years ago before his wife's death. Dorian is a misunderstood teenager, who I feels gets himself in situations for attention & he's just screaming for help in his own way.. [i use to be this kid] so i know how it feels... I hate the fact i never saw how he ended up. I hope he got it together.

I HOPE SEASONS 2, 3, 4, 5 & 6.. ARE RELEASED ON DVD!!!!!

MOESHA is an important part of my childhood & a thousand others & it means the world to me that a portion of it was released.. i thank whoever was responsible for this release.. KEEP THEM COMING! the characters are like family & friends of mine, that i rarely get to see.

Thank You Again, YOU ARE APPRECIATED!",1317945600,20,4618,4.250855188141391
