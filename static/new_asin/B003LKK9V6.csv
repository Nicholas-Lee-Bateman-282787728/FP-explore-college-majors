4153222,4,B003LKK9V6,"CARGO is a thought-provoking film that will stay with viewers for some time afterwards.

It explores the future of humanity and the consequences of our survival with an atmosphere of weary entopy and fatalism. Yet in a genre that is already far too over-saturated with dark dystopias, CARGO has something quite original to say that is as much about the subtle (yet crucial) difference between seeing and perceiving, as it does about ecological collapse and corporate malfeseance.

It is a methodically paced, often quite beautiful film that is suspenseful and superbly acted by a very de-glamorised German cast. Anna Katherina Schwabroh plays the main character, Laura, and her transformation from one of passive voyeurism (much of the opening scenes focus on her videoing others or watching messages from her sister) to active radicalism is very satisfying and lends more than a little significance to the cargo ship's name of 'Kassandra', where most of this film occurs.

It is only in some of the action sequences towards the end where the director(s) appear less certain but these moments are not strictly crucial to the experience of CARGO, which is focused more on ideas and suspence than outright action.

The ending leaves a lot of room for discussion including Laura's personal growth, the Greek myth of the unheeded prophetess thAt no doubt inspired the film and even the so-called Cassandra complex of contemporary psychology.",1325980800,11,1437,5.181034482758621
4153223,4,B003LKK9V6,"Cargo is a German speaking film (with English subtitles), for the most part set on a space craft bound for the outer limits of the solar system. Complications arise and secret plots are revealed, before heroes steps up and do what must be done (apparently). The film is quite descriptive and has little spoken exposition, which means if you're a non German speaker you need to pay attention or else you'll be lost. The film looks very good and has much atmosphere, and with the exception of a few scenes, the CGI is fantastic. The film borrows much of its atmosphere and look from Alien and Aliens (including some musical themes and ""scare sounds"", and even one or two scenes), and a major part of the story is influenced by another big Science Fiction franchise of the not too distant past (I won't reveal which one so as not to spoil the plot). Despite what some reviewers have said, the plot is original enough to make a good story, although it isn't particularly dramatically acted (i.e. people do not act very theatrical, which in my book is a good thing). There are one or two strange logical inconsistencies in the film, such as space stations needing to generate artificial gravity by spinning while the space craft apparently does not, and people tend to wear clothes and carry weapons from the 21st, or even 20th century, but these are minor points that does not distract from the story.

A film needs to be rated according to its premise and the budget, which was 5 million Swiss francs in 2009 (which I figure was about equal to $5.000.000 back then), and for that budget you get a LOT of good SciFi here. There isn't much bad to be said about this film, really, and it is well worth buying. I give it ""only"" four stars because it isn't as engaging as it could have been and some people might find it a bit slow (which is probably a homage to 70s movies, as well as to 2001: A Space Odyssey).",1309564800,2,1904,4.471264367816092

4153225,5,B003LKK9V6,"This is not an action adventure space romp. This is a wonderfull mystery/suspence tale that takes place in outer space. Everything seems realistic and accurate, no over the top props or lazer fire. You watch this movie and you will have an idea of what life on a space cargo ship will be like in the future. As this ship nears it's destination, some strange things begin to happen. People get brought out of hyper-sleep to deal with it. As they try to solve the mystery things start to get tense, then people start dying. It reaches an edge of your seat experience, all while you are trying to figure out what is happening.  A very visually entertaining movie, that makes you feel like you are there. I was still thinking of this movie a couple of hours after I finished watching it.  You will hardly know it  was an indi film with a poor budget, all I can say is, I hope they make more like this movie.",1394582400,3,903,4.331360946745562
4153226,4,B003LKK9V6,"I read about Cargo online someplace, a while back.  What I read made it sound kinda like Alien - y'know, there's a creature on board that starts killing the crew, etc.  While the movie starts out with that sort of a feel to it, that's not at all what it's about.  Without wishing to give too much away, it's a sort of a dystopian conspiracy story.  It's really a very good film, all in all.  As for the disc itself, it says its the French version on the cover, but fortunately English is one of the available dubs.  Going through the language setup screen is apparently the only way to play the movie - as selecting 'play film' on the disc's main menu only plays a bunch of previews for some reason!  Good movie, though a bit pricey.",1380153600,3,733,4.268115942028985
4153227,5,B003LKK9V6,"This is a rather excellent German science fiction film. The world has become uninhabitable through ecological failure, humanity has escaped into orbit and lives in overcrowded space stations. Their only escape is the new colony on Rhea, a planet paradise. Travel to this colony is expansive so a young daughter desperate to rejoin her family signs up for an 8 year voyage hauling cargo to the colony. On her solitary shift on the ship she thinks that she's not alone and discovers that what they are transporting isn't what they thought.

The film opens with a glorious shot of the space station in Earth orbit, a veritable city in space. It's a wonderful opening sequence and while the rest of the film has a more claustrophobic feel it certainly drags you in to the world it creates.

It also does a good job of the voyage, the life aboard ship is lonely and stressful, but doesn't drag too long before the story gets going. From that point it builds with some effective tension, the audio design adds to the atmosphere, in fact it reminded me of Dead Space in that respect.

For me there were only minor issues with the film, first and foremost was while the future tech looked good, it also lacked a practical aspect that jars slightly. Not a big issue, but hard sci-fi buffs will notice it.

Overall though it is an excellent watch, one I'm happy to recommend.",1379808000,4,1365,4.604938271604938
4153228,4,B003LKK9V6,"An apocalyptic sci-fi film set in space. Great acting and special effects. Beautiful soundtrack. It is visually stunning. In the far future the Earth has become unhabitable. People live on spacestations. Laura a young Medic has joined the team on board cargo ship Kassandra. There is a planet called Rhea which maybe can be a new beginning for the human race. Plenty of suspense throughout. You won't be dissapointed.

4153233,5,B003LKK9V6,"Germany has historically given us some of the BEST scifi ever produced. And like the silent film METROPOLIS, CARGO provides cutting edge special effects, an emotional script, and gigantic sets which dwarf the individual, into a sea of collectivism, in which humanity loses its purposeful individuality. At this point, its impossible to imagine a futuristic scifi film, which ISNT based on an ecologically ruined earth, and a distopian human society enslaved to technology. CARGO fits that discription well. In the 23rd century, humanity lives on HUGE spacestations, each about the size of Manhattan. The earth is a wasteland, destroyed by acid rain, uninhabited, unable to sustain life. Life on the space stations is horribly over-crowded, squalid, and psychically oppressive. The ONLY hope people have, is to win the lottery and move to the off world colony of RHEA, some 5 light years away. LAURA, our heroine, is a medic who is employed on the KASSANDRA, a cargo ship that takes supplies to Space Station 42. Her goal is to save money, to move to RHEA, to be close to her sister's family, who moved there about 7 years previous. And of course KASSANDRA, like her greek namesake,  will end up bearing a horrible message for humanity.
Two areas allow CARGO to be considered great science fiction. First, its a well thought out, deep analogy for the social problems facing earth today. Overcrowding, dehumanization, the threat of global corperations destroying not only our ecology but also our human freedoms, are the underlining themes here. The other area great science fiction needs, is some attempt at realism, when it comes to projecting what humanity's technological future holds. The space stations rotate to provide gravity, and apparently the space ship uses acceleration. Long space voyages require cyro-sleep, since there is no faster than light warp drives. The food is bland for those awake, and the space ship cold, to conserve energy. Many mechanical devices are half broken, undependable, and badly worn. A message to Rhea from earth takes 5 years to send, since its 5 light years away. So light speed is observed. In fact, except for the ongoing debate about the mind-body connection, and how REAL virtual reality is to the mind, CARGO is scientifically realistic. I appreciate that a lot.

The visuals, ship design, are HUMONGEOUS. The space station circuling earth is five miles wide, and 20 miles long. The KASSANDRA cargo ship is also huge, with the cargo doors, for example, some 60-70 feet high. The gigantic size helps to show humans overpowered by technology, a fundamental theme of futuristic scifi first explored in METROPOLIS. Humans are also enslaved spiritually by the greed of the corperations. You either tow the line for the corperations, or you're some kind of terrorist. Propaganda is rampant, mostly as advertising, tho little else exists as entertainment EXCEPT propaganda. Is it any wonder that RHEA is such an enticing dream world, that people would do ANYTHING to obtain? The script is believable for the most part, the characters well acted, the film well directed. The normal questions like ""Do people really fall in love/go crazy/sacrifice themselves/become evil so quickly?"" remain in CARGO. The nessecity of dramatic compression requires these devices, no doubt.

The BEST CHARACTER in the film, is the soundtrack. I've never watched a scifi movie where the soundtrack defines the atmosphere of the ship so completely, and defines the angst of the characters so convincingly. Its excellent KOSMISCHE krautrock, merging ship sounds, with the sonic landscape of the soundtrack. The film comes with an entire DVD of extras, that includes standards like MAKING OF, BEHIND THE SCENES, OUTTAKES, AUDIOCOMMENTARY with the director and producer, and other goodies. All in all, CARGO will be enjoyed by anyone who loves space ship adventures, deplictions of distopian future societies, and action adventure. The love story between Laura and the ship's cop, and the relationship between the two sisters, helps to humanize the heroine. Her choices and behaviors consistantly come across as realistic, and humane. I don't know why American scifi fans aren't more aware of this film, cos I loved it.",1356912000,,4232,5.175182481751825
4153234,4,B003LKK9V6,"This suspenseful sci-fi features a derelict cargo ship carrying supplies to an idealized planet called ""Rhea."" A newly hired young doctor has taken this job because she wants to join her sister and her niece some place habitable, as Earth is considered a lost cause.

Our heroine remains on active duty while the rest of the small crew is placed in suspended animation. As they near the end of their journey, she begins to suspect that there might be a stowaway on board.

There are rebels on Earth called Luddites. (...smile...) who think Earth can be saved, but our space ship is already under way. The photography/CGI is impressive, e.g., humans look like ants as they climb up ladders in the cargo hold. The suspense is palpable as they tentatively search the rusty ship down leaky corridors. The sound is very well matched to the visuals: Thunderous roars of the ship's thrusters, metallic clangs of the hold doors, and gasps in the respirators as they encounter alien conditions.

As the evidence mounts, so does the tension. This 2010 Seattle International Film Festival entry from Switzerland (with English captions) is great and I'm glad to see it available on Amazon.com!",1335139200,9,1181,4.924623115577889

The movie itself has story elements that reminded me a bit of a cross between Alien and The Matrix, but more so the 2001 Space Odyssey movie. Very slow pace to build the story to it's final conclusion. The CGI was good, maybe just a tad dated in spots. I thought the physical sets were really believable - with maybe the exception of the interior cargo door (did it need to be that big).

A good late-night/week-end movie.",1410048000,,661,4.5
