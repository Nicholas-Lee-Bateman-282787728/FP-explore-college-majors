5020974,2,B006VJI6IM,Not what I thought it would be. Not an interesting movie at all. Slow to start and slow to end. Not a good movie at all. Waste of money for sure.,1337472000,,145,3.7096774193548385
5020975,4,B006VJI6IM,"""The Seminarian"" is a drama about a closeted gay seminarian's search for love.  Ryan, the title character, is completing a thesis on ""The Divine Gift of Love"" at an evangelical seminary while struggling in a relationship with a man who won't commit. Questions of love, loneliness, faith and suffering are illuminated by Ryan's interactions with his distant gay lover, two gay classmates, and the devout mother who doesn't know about his sexual orientation.

Surprisingly, these evangelical seminarians apparently feel no conflict over being gay and Christian. The Bible passages used to condemn homosexuality are barely even mentioned. They don't worry much about whether to stay in the closet either. Coming out issues do arise, but in true 21st-century style, these young gays show no paranoia about hiding their sexual orientation, even in a hostile seminary setting. They're not even worried about using their degrees to get a job after graduation. Ryan focuses on a more universal question: How can love be a gift from God when it causes so much suffering?

This is a sweet, slow-paced film with no gratuitous sex. It would probably qualify for an R rating based on brief male frontal nudity and some low-key sex scenes. The film grows out of first-hand experiences at a conservative seminary. Writer-director Joshua Lim recently attended Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, California, where the movie was shot. Lim was born in Malaysia and raised in Singapore.

Viewers with seminary degrees will get a kick out of the film's valiant efforts to show the drama within such intellectual labors as library research and writing a master's thesis in theology. Many may find understated inspiration here.",1334275200,34,1710,5.2299270072992705
5020976,4,B006VJI6IM,"Seminary student Ryan is doing his Master's thesis on the working of God's love, a topic that he is somewhat confused about in his own life.  Ryan is among a handful of closeted gay seminarians, though none of them are close enough to him to really confide how he longs to have a real boyfriend. He is close with his mother, but has not opened up to her about his sexual orientation.  He did confide on a girl he trusted, which may have been a bad idea.  Meanwhile, the closest thing that he has found in looking for a life partner is Bradley, a guy he met online, but there seems to be issues there that threaten it from developing as he would like.

Writer/Director Joshua Lim presents an emotionally intense look at life and love, as well as raising some theoretical (rather than strictly theological) questions about how we reflect God's love through our relationships.  The acting (especially Mark Cirillo as Ryan) is first rate, and it is easy to see why this was a favorite at many gay film festivals over the past year and a half.

DVD to include audio commentary and interview with Cirillo, not rated but would be a light R for sexual situations. I give it four stars out of five.",1331337600,28,1189,4.456221198156682

I was expecting something more along the lines of a man who was  making a commitment  to a religious life and then finding out that was not what was right for him. And I suppose this film still does that but not with the intensity that I was hoping for. Cirillo  does his part very well and once you get into the film and understand what is going on, it does make sense.

5020988,1,B006VJI6IM,"I just don't know what to say about these movies where the supposedly twentysomething protagonist looks older than my father.  Was it really necessary to hire a 45-year old man to play the main character?  (Nothing against real-life seminary students in their 40's, but the character in the movie was supposed to be 21 or 23.)  I recently watched an old episode of the original BEVERLY HILLS 90210, from like 1990, and I found it to be totally ludicrous for the same reason.  I don't understand how anyone could take that show seriously, when the actors who played Dylan and Andrea, who were supposed to be in high school, were obviously in their 30's.  THE SEMINARIAN is much worse.  I couldn't watch past the first half hour because it totally creeped me out to see a guy who looks like my Dad pretending to be a college-aged kid.",1442102400,,832,4.587837837837838
5020989,2,B006VJI6IM,"What an opportunity to say something. A seminarian that is struggling with his sexuality. Good idea, but not here. Nothing is developed in this story. The fact he's a seminarian is not well established in cinematography, locations and are confined to a couple of scenes with his professor. Useless dialogue goes nowhere. Ryan's crucial heartbreak is based on a one trip, one night stand with a young man he hardly knows and dates mostly on his cell phone, It's not well developed with no real ruinous scene such as catching his love interest with another guy. There is no paradigm, no plot points, the screenwriter probably doesn't know what they are and why they're needed to move the story to its logical conclusion. Some of the shots are good, but mostly they're made with very few setups, you hear characters but don't see them, that's movie making 101. Nothing is established. Not a very good effort. Casting of actors, in some cases, is good, but others lack experience.  A really nice musical score and some nice nude shots are not enough to carry the plot in this directionless story. I wanted to like this film but it didn't happen for me.",1428883200,,1148,4.711442786069652
5020990,2,B006VJI6IM,"The movie is so slowly paced and monotone that you get bored watching it. It's more like an ameteur production that should have been a short movie rather that feature length. Seeing a nude Ryan (Mark Cirillo) is the most redeeming part of the movie and there should have been more of it. The movie has potential, but the characters are never fully developed and there are too many loose ends between events that watchers of this movie might get the impression that it was just slopped together or the director didn't know what he wanted to do.

The characters make a big deal of things like ""heterosexual marriage posters"" and it ends up nowhere and never addressed. You don't know what happens with the side characters, and the ending is awkward.  With how secure Ryan and his friends are, it's not really believeable that these are characters who are not already out of the closet. If you're dating online, that's public domain - you're exposed, you're out.  The movie ends with a coming out party, which shouldn't be the surprise to the mother that it is made to be.

I'm not discouraging anyone from watching. But it just wasn't a very good movie in that you have certain expectations for film as a standard. Slow paced and boring. Main character is straight enough acting but not surpringly gay. If you met this character you might ask yourself in your mind after seeing him, ""I wonder if he's gay"".
Not enough character development or multi-dimensions of supporting cast. Don't even get me started on the real process of writing a thesis, which was a mishmash here.

5021005,2,B006VJI6IM,"The film is a very slow story of a gay student in a conservative Christian seminary where pre-marital sex and any homosexual activities are discouraged.  Yet Ryan and his 2 other gay seminarians move in their small group fairly freely, including among other gay students at the university.  Ryan is obsessed with an on-line relationship that has been going on for a year with Bradley, a man who lives only an hour away.  At last, Ryan has a date with Bradley, but after that Bradley increasingly avoids him and breaks every subsequent date.  Ryans near despair impacts the important paper he is writing for his last semester and to help him get into a doctoral program at a prestigious school.  He ignores his fellow student Gerald, who does love him, while pining after someone any intelligent person would drop quickly.

Even though the writer/director attended seminary and had key actors study evangelical theology for a week to understand their lines, the theology presented is mishmash. For instance, Ryan tells his professor that the paper will be a combination of Reformed and Trinitarian doctrine, as though Reformed theology, indeed all orthodox Christian theology, is not Trinitarian.  His paper, also, mixes up the different types of love portrayed in the Greek New Testament:  Gods love (agape), brotherly love (philos), physical love (eros), and family love (storge).  Any first semester student in a seminary where the Bible is studied would know these different meanings.

Technically, the movie is shot almost as a stage play with long, close-up scenes of Ryan on the telephone, the computer, and on-line.  Conversations are either shot at a distance or focuses on one person for nearly the entire conversation.  One gets to see a great deal of the actor playing Ryan, walking, talking, and in various stages of dress or lack thereof.
Unlike many other small films, this one was two commentaries and two questions/answers sessions with the lead actors and writer/director.  While helpful in understanding more of what the film is about, going through 2 commentaries means seeing this slow film thrice.  It is a task only for those devoted to the topic and setting.  One should watch this film with low expectations as well as regret that the potential for a meaningful review of issues raised or could be raised is never close to being reached.",1388707200,,2361,5.017948717948718

Working on his thesis paper, which is about the nature of love and whether God IS love, Ryan tries hard to balance his own desire to be in a committed relationship with his love for his friends, with the lust he occasionally succumbs to that leaves him feeling empty and alone afterward.  The film is about Ryan's quest to find love, what love is, and what all of it has to do with God, so the film is slower-paced but never boring.  Low budget yet, and it shows in some of the direction and performances, but overall this is a polished production that - for those who appreciate it, as well as its targeted audience - also proves to be thought-provoking via the issues it raises.",1356912000,,924,4.520958083832335

5021011,4,B006VJI6IM,"I will not try to offer a recommendation either way on this film, as it deals with subject matter that everyone must determine for themselves whether or not they wish to view. I DO HOWEVER feel that a different kind of review is necessary for this film. A viewpoint that no-one else seems to be offering. Perhaps a side that no-one else seems to have caught, as most will either love a film, or hate it, with no middle ground. And thus, I give you my review to add to the mix.

Ryan, (Mark Cirillo) is a student in his final semester of seminary studies. He has to complete a solid theological thesis in order to continue his studies at the university of his choice. To receive the grade, his thesis must be solid, factual and based on biblical beliefs, not just personal feelings. Ryan is also gay and struggling with those feelings and his desire to stay true to his religious beliefs. Can he convince his professor that he has a full understanding of the subject of his thesis: ""The Divine Gift of Love""?

The film is directed by Joshua Lim and based on his own life and the lives of other students he met during seminary studies. There is some interesting reading online about Joshua Lim as well as the making of this film. You can find it easily through Google. As I read the reviews for this movie, everything inside of me told me to move on and don't waste my time and money on it. However, the subject matter intrigued me for some reason a bit more than other films which deal with the same feelings. There are MANY films out there which deal with the issues of confliction between a person's same-sex desires, and religious beliefs.

With most of those films, I have been left either feeling outcast for having same-sex attractions, or feeling that my religious beliefs had been mocked. This film however is the first of it's kind which I have seen, which offers an honest and fair approach to both issues. It doesn't seek to indoctrinate the viewer in either direction.

The connection between love and forgiveness leads to the idea that whatever life we live, in order to find real, true love, we must first find forgiveness. Forgiveness of ourselves for things we feel we have done, and perhaps even forgiving God for at least what we think he has done to us.

To be fair to ourselves, we must come to terms with both sides rather than turning to one and disposing of the other from our life. But can this really be done? Only you the viewer can make that decision for yourself. This film however gives some thought provoking challenges to finding that place of fairness and honesty with oneself. The rest is up to you.

I am not at all regretful for making this purchase. The film is well done, the acting is for the most part very good as is the picture and sound quality, casting, etc.. It isn't top notch, but it held my attention all the way through and didn't make me feel I wasted my time or money with it. I found it both entertaining and thought provoking.",1353110400,22,2977,4.453211009174312
5021012,2,B006VJI6IM,"Thinking himself only good enough to fall for and cling to an emotionally broken wreck of a man (""Bradley""), this work's Anti-hero lead actor (Mark Cirillo, playing an increasingly irritating and progressively boring ""Ryan"") will, at film's end: deny...reject...and break the heart of an emotionally stable fellow seminarian (""Gerald""), who actually loves him.

Along the way through this ""goes nowhere mess"", our Seminarian calls / texts us to death with a myriad of cell / computer messages---which never amount to much of anything.  And don't forget to add in the several ""feeling-sorry-for-myself"" visits home to Mom.

2-Stars for fairly good production values and some decent side-character acting.

5021013,1,B006VJI6IM,"The Seminarian has all the depth, subtlety and dramatic flair you'd expect from a Christian Youth Camp play.  It's a tedious meditation on the angst of gay christians, without having anything original to say on the subject.  It's certainly well-intentioned, but also mind-numbingly, at times even hilariously earnest.  The dialogue is gratingly banal and predictable, though several of the actors frequently don't seem to understand their own lines.  The pace is glacial.  And, most annoyingly, the characters rarely speak face-to-face when a phone call will suffice.  So watching the movie is a bit like working for a few hours at a call centre.  If you're a gay christian in need of affirmation, then skip this and watch Prayers For Bobby.  Better yet, read The God Delusion and really expand your mind.",1350777600,4,805,5.091603053435114

5021015,3,B006VJI6IM,"This was a great attempt at tackling the perenial tussle between the Judeo-Christian God and homosexuality but the pace was excruciatingly slow. In addition, while the cast, to me, was superb, the story-line wasn't. I felt that it was a pity the producers did not take the opportunity to beef up the maturity level of the gay characters - this was not the stereotypical, party-drugs-and-sex gay setting so, I just don't understand why the gay characters were not given greater depth, e.g. for the protagonist, who's a seminarian steeped in the quest for transcendental knowledge, to fall head over heels for a player like the character, Bradley, was difficult to watch. That kind of folly would have been more typical of a shallow, Hollywood wannabe but I certainly wouldn't expect that of a supposedly level-headed, deep-thinking seminarian. The message I got from this depiction of unrequited love seemed to be : ""When it comes to love, gay men, whether they're preachers or party boys, are still ruled by their dicks"". But, who doesn't already perceive that, right? It was such a pity the makers of this otherwise beautiful movie didn't capitalize on the chance to depict love between two men from a more mature, less dick-driven perspective.",1345420800,,1245,5.019323671497585
5021016,2,B006VJI6IM,"The film concept was interesting and held the potential to be very thought-provoking and innovative. However, the writers appear to have a poor grasp of theology or the nature of academic research, making the writing inauthentic and unbelievable. This also killed any of the theological import it could have had.

Further, the production values were poor at best. The camera was kept almost exclusive at a middle/close-up, with very few to non-existent cut-aways or alternate shots. Long takes cans be effective when they have a reason, but here they were merely dull. Further, the sets were bare and inauthentic and uninteresting. The shots were almost uniformly too long (each one could have lost a few seconds at least), making the pacing unbearably slow.

5021018,1,B006VJI6IM,"Do not be fooled by the carrot of ""Theology"" in this story. The film lacks all depth and entertaining value. Theology here becomes an inarticulate excuse to develop a very slow and superficial plot with a very unappealing main character (nothing to do with the looks of the actor). For the mature viewer, this is a poorly told story of young men rehearsing some of the stereotypical conflicts that affect gay men as they start living out their sexuality. There is no character study  or development to make one's time worth in viewing this film; the plot is so weak and predictable that I found myself yawning and debating whether to push the `stop' button or to suffer to the end of the movie (I ended up enduring to the end, hoping against hope to find any redeeming quality, to no avail). The acting is so poor that even the sex scenes-which I hoped would at least compensate for the entire lack of interest of the rest of the movie- are shallow and unconvincing. This film would have been a commendable effort for a High School movie production project, but it is a rip off to be packaged and offered to the general public to be sold as a real, marketable film. For those of us with real background in Theology, if not insulting this is at the very least laughable. Do not waste your money as I did with mine.",1343606400,2,1313,4.448132780082988

With a title like 'The Seminarian,' I expected to see a drama revolving around the conflicts of a seminary student between his personal convictions and the morality system of a very traditional church.  This movie, to the contrary, is about a young 20-something who is frantically searching for a loving relationship, the guys he falls in love with fail him, and he ends up in a state of painful disappointment and confusion.  There are 2 or 3 shallow references to God along the lines of, ""What does this say about God?"", with no further development or insight.  The seminary is just a backdrop to the story:  the setting could easily have been a high school.  Think ""Glee"" without the good music.

5021024,4,B006VJI6IM,"this is one of the better gay movies out there. the production value was very high, acting was above average and the story was emotional and intense.

the pace of the movie takes getting used to but twenty minutes into the movie, i was very comfortable with the pacing and enjoyed the movie thoroughly.

the movie focuses on the emotional struggles of Ryan, a Seminarian who is finishing his thesis on love. His relationship struggles inform his thesis writing and meets a very satisfactory ending. This is a very sweet movie when you can reach the powerful climax.

i highly recommend this movie to discerning viewers who want a serious gay movie about love and suffering.",1339027200,,673,4.7844827586206895

8505040,3,B006VJI6IM,"During most of the film, I thought I would buck the tide and give it a 4-star rating. Although it moved a bit slowly, I appreciated the depth of the main character and the realistic portrayal of relationships. How many people have met someone online, got along well with them, had a great date, and then SILENCE?  Lots of folks. That was so realistic. Ryan was lonely and trying to struggle with being in the closet in a religious environment. That's a well worn theme, but having it take place in a seminary was different. Anyway, the major problem was the ending. It was too abrupt and let too many things unresolved. After patiently watching this very long movie, I expected and deserved more from the ending (hence, 3 rather than 4 stars).",1527984000,,743,4.586466165413534
8505041,3,B006VJI6IM,"I have read many other reviews and many have valid technical points.  The movie is often slow moving, has some weaker acting and has some awkward video angles but there was a story to tell.  It took me back to my youth when I was trying to be a good catholic but was blocked in nearly every way possible by the loudest christians.  I would volunteer but never get selected.  It took me a very long time to realize the un-christian biases that were always placed in front of me.  The gay characters in the seminary are fighting many of the biases that still exist.  It was not surprising to see the self proclaimed christian friends who were quick to judge Ryan when he came out to them.  I went through many of the same situations in my life.  When I was their age, being gay was still against the law so I grew up completely closeted and untrusting.  I still am closeted in many ways even today.  What took Ryan and others a long time to realize is religion is not the answer.  Religion is the problem.  So I found the movie okay even with its technical flaws.  So many people, especially many who profess to follow Jesus' teachings, really hide behind small, vague passages in the Bible and ignore the big picture Jesus tried to teach us.  Love, don't judge.",1527379200,,1260,4.375

8505045,3,B006VJI6IM,"This was an interesting movie. It was better than I expected, although it sort of left me with blue balls. Backing up a bit, I think the subject of a gay seminarian was a really good choice that has lots of potential for character development. We see Ryan at all different stages of relationships: A casual hookup, a long-term romantic (but asexual) relationship, feeling rejection, causing someone else to feel rejection, bouncing back and forth between guys, etc. I think the movie captures a young man exploring his sexuality really well. I also think it was a good choice to showcase some of the repressive aspects of Christianity without painting everything in a negative light. It made the movie not so one-dimensional, which a lot of LGBT films tend to be.

My biggest complaint with this movie is that it is pretty slow. There are lots of long shots of characters staring off into the distance, or scenes where Ryan is just talking on the phone. I still found the movie interesting, but it could have moved a bit quicker. My other complaint would be the resolution. It's a bold move to end the movie on a sad note, although it would have been interesting to see how Ryan's coming out to his mother would have gone. I also would have liked to see more with Gerald, even if it was just one last scene where Ryan and Gerald meet up for coffee or something. Or for Ryan to get his acceptance letter to Yale. I don't know, the ending left me with lots of questions.

So overall, it was a decently good movie. Obviously it was pretty low budget and not the best thing ever, but it was pleasantly enjoyable compared to a lot of other LGBT films out there.",1498521600,,1656,4.498338870431894
8505046,2,B006VJI6IM,"So let me say this first, for a movie called the Seminarian we really did not spend too much time discussing the Seminary portion of this idea. The filming of this move was awful. For instance, we have 2 people having a conversation and instead of a wide 2 shot we get one person on camera and some disembodied voice replying to him and these shots happen all the time. A shot of another conversation from behind and only seeing the backs of their heads. The dialog is awful and certainly must have been written by a child and very insipid. The acting is barely watchable and I hope that no one in this movie every acted again. The story is barely watchable and I would not recommend this to anyone at all.",1495411200,,706,4.315789473684211
