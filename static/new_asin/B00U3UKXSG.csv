7028964,5,B00U3UKXSG,"This series continues to mesmerize and impress me. The writing, acting and story are the best on Television. Lizzy Caplan and Michael Sheen share a chemistry unlike many couples on Television and both deserve Emmy's for their performances. Episode 3 Titled ""Fight"" is the most effective and revealing episode of the season and by far one of the most impressive hours of television you will ever see. I cannot wait for the DVD Extras and for Season 3 to come soon! Brilliant Series.",1425340800,16,481,4.807228915662651

And, the struggles that Jeff Bridges' character is facing is very eye-opening to understand what gay men had to deal with 60+ years ago. I am so sucked into this series!

7029028,5,B00U3UKXSG,"Masters of sex is one of those rare shows that catch you off guard, expecting nothing, but getting the ""Gold standard"" for how well a show can be created.  There are all the elements of a great drama, brilliantly written, superbly cast, and it has humor as well as heart break.  Go for a ride through the often entertaining, hilarious, sometimes tear Jerking history of  America's transitional period of sexual ignorance to its startling discovery that we are all just human beings with the same wants, needs and desires.",1470700800,,521,4.831460674157303
7029029,4,B00U3UKXSG,"So continues Bill Masters' (played by Mike Sheen) continuing quest to make the study of human sexual habits a mainstream scientific endeavor.  With this pioneering research comes many perils:  people don't take him seriously, people start to think he's a quack and his life's work is belittled.  Well, at least he gets to 'engage' in his research with his beautiful assistant, Virginia (played by Lizzy Caplan).  That's one heck of a consolation prize, if I've ever seen one!!

It goes without saying that if you're watching season 2, then you watched season 1 1st.  If this is not the case, then you are going to be lost w/what is going on.  For those who did view the 1st season, chances are you figured that Caitlin Fitzgerald (who plays Libby Masters) would never strip down.  Must not be in her contract, you think.  Well, that may have been the case for the 1st season, but not the 2nd season!!  And, I must say that she looks breathtaking when she's topless!!

To that end, Lizzy Caplan & Caitlin Fitzgerald contrast with each other nicely.  Both women are beautiful, but in different ways.  Lizzy has a warm, engaging girl-next-door beauty (although she's captivating nonetheless).  Caitlin, meanwhile, has a regal, aristocratic, more ""serious"" beauty.  Both actresses are delightful in their own way.  Oh, and did I mention that they both look terrific topless???

This is not a great series, but it is a good series.  Season 2 offers sub plots of racism in the late 50s / early 60s and the seeds of the coming civil rights movement in the mid-60s.  And, of course, it also bears witness to the changing norms regarding sexuality, which led to the sexual revolution (also in the mid-to-late 60s).  For a period piece, there's more to this series than just sex.....although that most assuredly is what is bound to draw you into the series in the 1st place!",1470268800,,1864,4.765625

7029043,5,B00U3UKXSG,"This series is so well written and well acted, and it thoughtfully explores intersecting conflicts in race, gender, and social mores during such a pivotal era. It's fascinating to see how the characters and their relationships evolve. I've laughed out loud probably at least once per episode, but it's also frequently very moving.

Often though I think the writers here  have nothing to say and just throw in the sex to fill time making  the sex  just boring.  Both Masters and Johnson are now dead and I imagine they would plotz if they knew how melodramatically this series  portrays their lives.

On the other hand  ""Masters of Sex"" reminds us that we have come along way baby . We do owe alot to M and J for their perseverance in the face of harsh social censure.",1459296000,,580,4.238532110091743

7029106,1,B00U3UKXSG,"MoS Imposes values of 2015 on 1955. Guess what happens? The folks of the earlier era come up way short. But, then again, in the tradition of most cable, especially HBO, liberalism prevails: in 1955 women are smarter than men, blacks are cooler than whites, and gays are repressed but enlightened. MoS S2 is a poorly dramatized soap opera dressed up as revisionism, heavy on the victimization of the three groups mentioned above. If you can slog through this show, chances are you already feel superior and progressive. This show is GLBT run amok with heavy doses of feminism & civil rights. Nothing wrong with those values, mind you; but hammering them home from 2015 takes no guts at all. If this were done in the 50's or 60's as in the films The Children's Hour or In The Heat of the Night or The Pawnbroker, that would be courageous. MoS is self-congratulatory and breaks old ground as if it were new. Tell us something we didn't already know.

7029110,5,B00U3UKXSG,"Being from St. Louis, I have always been aware of Masters & Johnson. This is really a historic documentary, filled with emotional entanglements, and relational challenges. It is so incredible to see how much they brought to the table regarding sexuality, and their own growth and learning about how emotions, family upbringing, and chemistry play into sexual response. Sex is more than just sex. It is a complex interplay of mind, body and spirit. The character development is one of the shows highlights. And, it is a historic view into the 1960s and the struggles for racial equality. Lots of nudity, as many of the sexual scenes are really acted out. So, if that is a problem for you, it might get in the way of the story line. As the shows progresses, I am drawn more and more into each of the characters and their struggle to come to grips with who they are, and their desire to make a difference in the world, heal their own past, and create meaning out of their lives, and loves.",1442361600,,986,4.544943820224719

Michael Sheen and Lizzy Caplan have the hottest and most believable chemistry on t.v. They bring so much emotion and complexity to Bill and Virginia. Even Caitlin Fitzgerald was absolutely brilliant in season 2. Her character, Libby (Bill's long-suffering wife) really got a chance to shine and flex her acting muscles. I think my favorite episode of this season was ""Fight"". I enjoyed dark and intense storylines especially with Bill's problems in the bedroom halfway through the season. I LOVE this show!

7029160,5,B00U3UKXSG,"+++WARNING+++ this will contain some spoilers from season 1, but no major giveaways from season 2.  If you have not seen the first season, skip past the first paragraph.

The second season picks up after the events that closed out season one that led to Masters being fired from the hospital, and telling Virginia how he feels about her.  It then follows through roughly a three year time period up to Kennedy's inauguration in 1960.  This includes a time jump (albeit a very subtle one) in the middle of the season  The jump ends up eliminating or pushing to the backburner many of the season one stories (Barton's arc dealing with his homosexuality for example is almost non-existent after the first couple episodes) and Ethan is heard from in the first couple episodes and does not resurface until the very end.

The big theme of this season are the character's relationships with each other, whether they are strengthening or deteriorating.  Intertwined with that is the backdrop of the civil rights movement, and racial issues in general, for the most part involving Libby.  Sexual dysfunction also becomes a major theme as the study begins to look at people with sexual problems instead of rejecting them.  And of course the entire sex as a taboo subject is ever present as it was in the first season.

It is very important to note that this is not a documentary or even a docudrama.  It is a very fictionalized version of the story of Masters and Johnson's work.  There are many made up characters, story lines and plots that are added in the show that never occurred in real life.  It is telling the larger story, but takes a lot of liberties getting there.  This is even more apparent in the second season than in the first.  There is a lot added for dramatic effect, and if that is something that would bug you, it is best to skip this.  There are also some ancillary plots, like one involving the sale of diet pills that Virginia starts out in that ends up involving doctor Langham, a story between Lester and a new character, Barb, played by Breaking Bad's Betsy Brandt, and a story involving a new character played by Sarah Silverman.  Some of them work better than others, and while none play a dominant role in the show they are all given time to play out.

For those who get the Blu Ray discs, the show looks and sounds great as you would expect.  For extras there are deleted scenes on select episodes, a History of Sex feature where the show runners and some of the actors talk about the second season, and where the show has been and overall where it is going.  Then there is a Women of Sex feature that focuses on the female characters, and a Men of Sex, which is a roundtable discussion between the male actors and their characters in the second season.  All in all, good for what is there.",1435795200,8,2811,4.548707753479126

An emerging theme regarding the treatment of sexual problems, is the need for conjoint sessions with a male and female therapist present. This is consistent with Masters and Johnson's conjoint sexual therapy (another ground-breaking work). The season has a number of subplots and story lines that don't seem to be related to the main storyline.

7029177,5,B00U3UKXSG,"Hope there is a Season 3 as there are at least three unresolved issues in this excellent series. By nature of the subject of this DVD,, and sophisticated Europeans in their  adult films, the producers of the next series should show natural front nudity as appropriate to the scene..",1433462400,,282,4.755102040816326
7029178,5,B00U3UKXSG,"An enjoyable 2nd season of a well done show.  I thought that it was a little light on the ""extras"" (no commentaries for any of the episodes)",1433289600,,140,4.185185185185185
7029179,5,B00U3UKXSG,I started watching this series to understand the study of Masters and Johnson.  I wanted to know the persons and their personalities behind the study.  The two lead actors who portray Masters and Johnson are superior in their acting.  This is an excellent series.  I certainly hope the producers have another season.  Really enjoyed it.,1433289600,,336,5.036363636363636
7029180,4,B00U3UKXSG,"What is the difference between art to tell a story and the actual facts of people's lives?  It appears that the writers have followed the art rather than facts.  I enjoyed watching the series but in real life they published a medical text book that became a best seller.  That book contains vast quantities of very small details about people's sexual response.  The amount of time required to write that book may have involved a 120 hour work week, which would have been very stressful on the lives of the people around them but would have left Masters and Johnson too tired to do much else beyond, eat, sleep, and write.  The drama in the second season in ""interesting"" but I'm not sure that I want to watch the 3rd season.",1433289600,,724,4.4961832061068705

7029184,5,B00U3UKXSG,"Just watched all 12 episodes of the 2nd season of Masters of Sex on DVD.  I own the 1st season too.
Sex is an act that encompasses all the components of humanness--physical, emotional, psychological--and melds them together into a dramatic few moments in time that often--in good and bad ways--changes one's life, their everyday reality.
As does this incredible show.
It has it all---drama, comedy, emotions, riveting plots, award-winning acting and scripts, naked bodies and naked souls!
As an almost 71 year old man, I lived through the 50's and 60's as an adolescent and a teenager.
My sexuality emerged in all its fierce and scary energy through my changing body and my growing knowledge of the world.
Those were historic times.
We saw the beginning of so many ""revolutions"", you became dizzy....or stoned!
And this show has touched on many of them.
The liberation of women, gays, black power, and the more widespread awareness of sex.
And it was Bill Masters and Virginia Johnson who really set the path for us to follow.
Their book, Human Sexual Response, guided us and taught us what sex was about...and what it could be.
This 2nd season draws a clear linear line through the period of about 1958 through 1960, and John Kennedy's inauguration as President.
I experienced the subtle (though often more explicit!) racism that defined the black experience then...even though I'm white.
And while I won't spoil it for you, what happens when Libby volunteers at a CORE center in St Louis is not only shocking, but is so wonderfully played out in the show, that it brought me to tears in the final episode.
But the history of the times aside, it's really the story of the relationship---both at work and in the bedroom-- between Masters and Johnson that defines and makes this show so powerful.
And so worth purchasing from Amazon!
I will watch this second season (AFTER watching the first season!) again....and I KNOW I will find it just as captivating and stimulating (pun intended!  LOL) the 2nd time around!",1432080000,24,2012,4.862973760932944

7029187,5,B00U3UKXSG,"Great show.  Brilliant acting and the era is very well expressed.  I did not, however, appreciate the female humiliation via sex and violence inference in ep. 2.

7029188,4,B00U3UKXSG,"Well-acted, well-directed, well-produced! A mesmerizing account of the professional accomplishments and fascinating personal dynamics of Masters & Johnson. Virginia Johnson's emotional clarity and inspired treatment innovations were more than a match for Masters' scientific acumen. The genius of their collaboration was to open the study of human sexuality in a way unheard of previously.  If Freud had really wanted an answer to his famous question, What do women want?,  he should have asked Virginia Johnson.",1431648000,3,512,5.8133333333333335
