8254868,4,B0014BJ1C2,"The video was entertaining in its very original approach. I liked the medieval
Mysterious gendre that drew one into a master student relationship.",1387411200,,146,5.391304347826087
8254869,3,B0014BJ1C2,"This DVD is particularly helpful if you already own the book. As you would know, then, Adam must have OCD, because his books are so incredibly complete/complex, that it makes it hard sometimes to see here he is going. Well, in this DVD he tells you. Most of it I already knew, but there were some nuggets.

BTW - the red envelope people have this for rent! And the whole wizard thing is, IMHO REALLY cheezy :-P !",1375142400,3,412,4.282051282051282
8254870,4,B0014BJ1C2,The Grimoire Series Books are incredible guides for playing guitar as well as learning musical Theory. My only complaint is that the videos are a little dry. They do enhance one's understanding of the books if you do not have a strong background in Music Theory. The video as well as the book have both given me a different perspective on the music I play and have helped me learn to see notes better on the fret board. This DVD is worth watching if you have no background in improvisation and would like to get a start at how to do it.,1336089600,,536,4.264705882352941
8254871,5,B0014BJ1C2,"Each DVD is rich with guitar playing concepts and theory. The DVD flows extremely fast, but armed with a ""pause"" button a user can absorb a lot. Each DVD is jammed packed with viable information and technique, even though there's a cheesy Grim Reaper explaining these lessons throughout the DVD.
I recommend these DVD's to anyone interested in learning or getting better at playing guitar.",1284681600,5,389,5.0
8254872,5,B0014BJ1C2,"I bought this dvd even with the above (negative) review, because I liked the BASS GRIMOIRE DVD, yes I'm a bass player.
Well, whenever I read * GRIMOIRE reviews everybody seems to be concentrated on the
Wizard who presents the DVD. I think the most important than the Wizard is the what
the DVD can offer to you, and in this case the Guitar Grimoire - Progressions and Improvisation
is very usefull. The ""Wizard"" shows you the progressions and how to use then, give you
""tips"" on how to create your own song.
Regarding his playing , well I think this DVD doesn't intend to show you the best guitar
player you've ever seem/heard... he just show you how to compose a song a solo with the
theory explained during the DVD and his book.
I liked this DVD a lot and I'm now buying the book Guitar Grimoire - Progressions and Improvisation
so I don't have to memorize all patterns.
Hope this helps.
