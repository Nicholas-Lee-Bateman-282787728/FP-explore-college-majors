6577527,5,B00MH26N32,I bought the Halloween one and I love this one too. Really I hope Mill Creek will keep making these! Would love to have more Holiday themed shows or even Thanksgiving shows on one DVD to watch. Great job Mill Creek! And thanks for making it affordable!,1413331200,12,252,4.382978723404255

6577529,5,B00MH26N32,"A great trip down memory lane. It's been a long time since I thought about the Ellen show, or Third Rock from the Sun, or even News Radio. Christmas special episodes are often dull, but most of the ones in this collection are quite good. I even shed a tear at the end of Roseanne. (Skip the terrible ""Bewitched,"" which is not only lame but out of place here in 1990land.)",1482969600,,371,4.23943661971831

6577538,4,B00MH26N32,"Fantastic compilation; one of the best out there. Granted, there is some duplication with others on the market, but that's likely to be expected with such a broad offering as this.

High points are the episodes of ""That '70s Show,"" ""Married...With Children"" and ""Bewitched""; even the ""Third Rock From the Sun"" episode is a good one, though this series never appealed to me. Low point is the episode of ""The Cosby Show"" which hardly mentions Christmas at all--it's pretty much an afterthought.",1450310400,2,492,5.0

6577544,5,B00MH26N32,"It made coming home from the hospital a whole lot better following my knee surgery.  Christmas was very different this year, which is why the DVD was so great.  I needed to laugh, and laugh I did.",1423180800,6,196,4.27027027027027
6577545,4,B00MH26N32,"Nostalgic and seasonal fun.  I watch for the background accessories and time period clothing.  But mostly, the stories evoke a more innocent time in American history.  I do not like that there is not a ""play all"" option.",1421366400,4,220,4.7368421052631575
6577546,2,B00MH26N32,"Given the number of seasons many of these shows were on the air, one would think they might try and select the best of the holiday episodes.  This did not seem to be the case.  The ""Christmas"" episode from the Cosby Show was one of the most pointless, boring episodes from the entire series.",1421366400,,291,4.37037037037037

8672168,4,B00MH26N32,"If you enjoy watching Christmas episodes of beloved sitcoms like ""Bewitched,"" ""The Flying Nun,"" ""The Partridge Family,"" ""Roseanne,"" ""The Cosby Show,"" ""Married with Children,"" ""3rd Rock from the Sun,"" ""The Ellen Show,"" ""Just Shoot Me,"" ""The Nanny,"" ""Newsradio"" and ""That '70s Show"" among them.

I enjoyed the first season of ""Bewitched"" with the Stephens and Kravitzes taking in some boy orphans for the holidays. The first season Christmas episode of ""The Flying Nun"" with Sally Field's Sister Bertrille wants to fulfill an ill nun, Sister Olaf, whose wish for a White Christmas to come true. ""The Partridge Family,"" has a memorable episode with guest star, Dean Jagger, as a Charlie. The family gets stranded in a western ghost town. ""Roseanne's"" Christmas episode is from the fourth season where she played Santa Claus at the department store. Lee Garlington has a guest appearance.

""The Cosby Show"" has the final season Christmas episode where the Huxtables find a room for Clair. After ""The Cosby Show,"" they are followed by the unforgettable ""Married with Children"" in their first Christmas episode of the long running series. ""3rd Rock from the Sun""'s only Christmas episode has everybody in and out of the Christmas spirit especially Professor Dick Solomon. ""The Ellen Show"" includes ""Ellen's First Christmas"" in her hometown of Clark with mom, Cloris Leachman and aunt Mary Tyler Moore in a surprise visit. Mike Gaffigan and Martin Mull play fellow colleagues at the school.

""Just Shoot Me's"" Christmas episode includes Maya (Laura San Giacomo) trying to make a night worker's dream come true and it doesn't end up that way. ""The Nanny's"" first Christmas episode has the family wishing for the patriarch Maxwell Sheffield stay home for Christmas. ""Newsradio's"" first Christmas episode has Mr. James being generous to his employees. ""That '70s' Show"" has the first Christmas episode of the long running series.

12 episodes all on one DVD. It's a great buy and memorable episodes. You can watch some or all of them to get in the holiday spirit.",1484611200,,2053,5.119402985074627
