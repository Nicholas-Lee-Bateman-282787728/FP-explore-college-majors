3695346,5,B001MBTSJ0,"Truly wonderful to watch  great minds debate with out the screeching hysteria of today's political shows. Fun to watch the give and take and the subtle and not so subtle insults. It is like watching a heavy weight championship bout. Buckley from the get go attacks and insults Susskind and throughout tries to get Susskind on the ropes, but Susskind takes the punches holds his own and punches back. At the end it was a TKO victory for Susskind, but you have to admire Buckley's wit. Again really fun to watch. Miss the intelligence of these two men.",1370217600,,550,4.612244897959184

8320930,5,B001MBTSJ0,"Amazing piece of history. This takes you right back to 1968 in a very immediate way. Buckley is aggressively hostile to Wallace right from the starting gate, but Wallace does a great job of holding his own.",1461974400,,206,4.594594594594595
8320931,5,B001MBTSJ0,"I remembered seeing this episode as available, and after hearing 2016 presidential candidate Donald Trump repeatedly being compared to George Wallace I decided to watch it and make my own conclusions. In terms of civility, logic, and the ability to argue a point Wallace far outshines Trump.

The premise of the debate is Buckley's contention that Wallace isn't really a conservative, and that his conservatism is merely a ploy to support segregation. In support of this Buckley cites various social programs in Alabama which Wallace supports, such as pensions for the old and destitute. Wallace points out that these programs were only established after unsuccessful attempts were made to put this burden on children, who could not be found. Buckley then concedes that under those circumstances the pensions are acceptable to conservatives.

Wallace also points out that the South has traditionally suffered economic discrimination far beyond Reconstruction, particularly in the federally mandated transportation tariffs which essentially placed a large tax on goods being shipped out of the South while providing a subsidy for those being shipped into the South. As such, Wallace said he had no qualms over the fact that Alabama was accepting federal money, although he made it clear that the thought the federal government should eventually be removed as a middleman by converting first to block grants to the states, which would be phased out and the tax burden shifted to the individual states who would have the responsibility to provide these services.

I found especially interesting Wallace's repeated challenge to Buckley to ""Tell me something that we're doing in Alabama that you don't like."" Buckley seemed to be unable to identify any Alabama specific spending program that was absolutely unacceptable under conservative doctrine.
Many people are under the impression that George Wallace was running on a segregationist platform in 1968 and thereafter. This was not the case. Desegregation had already taken place; the issue was whether the federal government would impose forced busing and other extreme measures in an effort to achieve ""perfect"" integration. Wallace was opposed to these extreme measures. The federal courts went absolutely nuts with plans designed to make the lives of white students miserable, and whites fled en masse; the result is that our schools are far more segregated today, with virtually no way to integrate them. You can't have integration without white people. If Wallace or his views had prevailed in 1968, we might not have full and ""perfect"" integration in our schools, but in all likelihood we wouldn't have the almost total segregation that now exists.

Given the current political climate, I found this exchange refreshing in the way two people who disagreed strongly could still be civil even when they reached the point of anger or frustration. It's worth a one-hour investment of your time, and for a younger generation who have never heard Buckley or Wallace speak at length, this is your chance.",1458604800,2,3051,5.284536082474227

8320933,5,B001MBTSJ0,"Though Wallace is perceived as a legendary segregationist, it is interesting to get a 360 degree view of the man's mannerisms and creative responses to questions regarding discrimination and his policies regarding the issue. Buckley did an effective job at circumventing Wallace's evasive tactics regarding the issue of segregation and other topics that condescended the image of Alabama and the South as a whole. I think that they could have done without the mediator, though, as I feel he caused more interruption to the men's dialogue than order. Overall a great historical moment in America.",1400198400,,595,5.273684210526316
8320934,5,B001MBTSJ0,"Wallace wasn't the least bit intimidated by Buckley. They talked over each other throughout interview / debate as the moderator did little in the way of moderating. It's a shame that Wallace wasn't asked direct questions nor asked to defend some of his indefensible positions that he held and events that occurred during his time as Governor or Alabama. Nevertheless, it was still a good episode. It just could have been better.",1397779200,,428,4.958333333333333
8320935,5,B001MBTSJ0,"Wallace and Buckley go at each other like pro wrestlers. This really is Firing Line at its best. The one-hour fight begins with Buckley's introduction of Wallace, which Wallace spends a good deal of time repudiating.

Wallace is mostly known for being a segregationist Democrat of old. However, it is probably fair to say he was wrongly characterized by elite media in large cities in the Northeast. Wallace denies being a racist and says the much-maligned actions he took in Alabama to enforce segregation were overblown by the media. He also says, interestingly, that more race riots and social problems happen in the North and West than in the South.

Then we move on to Buckley challenging Alabama's receipt of disproportionate amounts of federal aid. Wallace defends by saying the money went to help the poor, specifically poor and elderly black families. He also states that the reason Alabama is poor is in part due to unfair trading & commerce laws against the South, laws from the anti-South Reconstruction period after the Civil War, laws which are still in existence ""today,"" i.e. the late 1960s.

To me it is clear that Wallace is a good lawyer, good populist and defender of the South. He has a clear historical disdain for northerners, especially northern Republicans in the style of Rockefeller and Buckley. He believes they (a) want to deny altruistic federal aid to poor Alabamans, and (b) have bought into the media's absurd characterizations of social conditions in the South. In the final analysis, Wallace was a ""New Deal"" Democrat who likely tried to do a great deal for the poor, who voted for Roosevelt and Kennedy, but who also profited himself, surely politically and possibly economically.",1386547200,3,1716,4.993006993006993
8320936,3,B001MBTSJ0,"Mr Buckley seemed little interested in Mr Wallace's views or his stature as a national candidate.  Mr Wallace is exceptional in stating the facts as he sees them and often challenges Mr Buckley to produce evidence of ""prominent conservatives"" or ""ratio of taxes paid vs federal aid"".

These programs are a snapshot in time and by today's standards seem politically unacceptable with the use of the word Negroes, people in the audience smoking etc. In 2013 this type of interview would not be possible because of the polarization of the viewpoints.

I disagree with Mr. Buckley's political ideology but I miss his presence, his impish grin and probing mind.  He forces you to be that most coveted of people.  The educated and reasoned person that can support their argument not with sound bite responses but with foundations grounded in the social contract etc.",1386547200,,860,4.986013986013986
