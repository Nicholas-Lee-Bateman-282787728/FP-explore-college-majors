4067777,4,B0034JKZ8G,"Disney's ""The Princess and the Frog"" had quite the controversy over the past few months, with many activists crying foul over its contents.  After seeing this film, I believe I have the proper response in regards to its most topical subject:

Are the fireflies rightfully depicted in this movie?

Short answer, no.  Is this how lighting bugs are viewed in the early 20th century, acting like dimwitted neanderthals with improper vocabulary?  The fireflies back then were an impoverished species, living through the muck and grim everyday of their life.  Many didn't want to live the swamplands, but they were forced to migrate in these harsh conditions.  It took many years of hard work and perseverance for them to be accepted and live among other bugs, and today's generation are treated with an ill-fated 'comic-relief' with an interest in large glowing abdomens?  This is a travesty to Lampyridaes everywhere...but besides that, everything else is safe.

When Disney announced that Princess & Frog is going to be a revitalization of the classic animated tale format once upon a time ago, one side of me gleed 'YAY!' while the other side of me declared 'why?'.  To explain my view of the latter, ""The Princess and the Frog"" has all the common ingredients of a classic Disney tale: the strong-willed female lead and her contrasting love interest, an unambiguously evil villain, the couple bickering before admitting their loves followed by a kiss, convenient misunderstandings, wacky animal/object sidekicks, and the good ol' fashion tragic death. Disney brought back back the magic, but the company's pulling old tricks.  The film, however, did take the kissing approach to another level when Tiana (voiced by that third Dreamgirls singer) kisses the frog and she turns into one, which when I saw it on the trailer was a pretty good twist; still, it then follows the same recipe.  When I think how the movie ""Enchanted"" had clever ideas on the fairy tale formula, this film is a step backwards on the aspect.

Nevertheless, all I'm doing at this point is bickering, and there's still a part of me that embraces the film's return to 2-D form.  As a person who grew up during the Disney Renaissance, watching musical numbers with well-animated choreography and vibrant colors, nevermind that some force the plot along like the frog-transformation number, has made my heart flutter like it hasn't for a while; I especially like the Almost There song where the art shifts into different styles.  The movie did a fine job of capturing the energy and wildness of N'Orleans.

Praising the look doesn't mean that I'm putting second on story, because that would make me sound like a hypocrite&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/after-my-last-review/dp/B001PR0YBM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">after my last review</a>.  Although the tale follows a familiar path, it does shift certain gears for the better.  The main message of the film is you should earn your way to make your dreams a reality, rather than just praying for them to happen, which is a positive thing to say to kids.  At the same time, it showcase that too much work can overlook the simple pleasures of life, and when the story pairs up a girl who works too hard and a prince who does nothing, seeing the two work out their opposite traits is effective.  As for the characters, while I have nothing against any of them (including Ray the Firefly, all joking aside), I was surprised by how much I like Tiana's friend, Lotte.  Or rather, I like how the movie depicts Lotte as a spoiled gal who glorifies in romantic fantasies due to her overcaring father, which is an amusing allegory for self-enamored prissy girls of today.  However, she's not just a living social commentary, nor is she viewed as a negative character, as she does shown concern for her friend and support her dreams; her character is pretty refreshing.  Neither of those girls are actual princesses, so to see the story play out the fairy tale from technicalities had a good chuckle from me.

Music-wise, I can't say they left an impression on me.  Randy Newman's score fits the tone of the Louisiana setting very well, but the songs aren't really memorable; can't say I have a clear favorite that meant a lot to me.  I'll have to wait a while to see if ""When I'm Human"" has a lasting effect like ""Under The Sea"" and ""Hakuna Matata"".

""The Princess and the Frog"" isn't as good as ""Up"" in terms of profoundness and emotional input.  It didn't renovate the formula, but then why should it?  It delivered the sensation that has almost been forgotten, and when I saw a child next to me dancing to that witch doctor song, I was reminded that Disney still hasn't lost its touch.  Then again, I also saw a child dance to ""Alvin & The Chipminks"", so maybe children are just easy.",1260835200,5,4837,4.91389913899139
4067778,5,B0034JKZ8G,"I took my 4-year-old and 7-year-old girls to see this at the theater. It is great that the movie teaches that you can't get what you want from just wishing on a star. The movie has outstanding visuals, too, and many funny moments. IMO, however, many of the songs are just so-so. Both of my daughters absolutely loved it, more than Enchanted, more than Sleeping Beauty and more than Snow White. For my kids it ranks up there with Beauty and the Beast.",1260748800,26,450,4.433734939759036
4067779,5,B0034JKZ8G,"Disney's taken the old fairy tale and given it a new spin.  This time, the story takes place in 1920's New Orleans at the height of the Jazz Age. The heroine is a little African American girl, Tiana (voiced by Anika Noni Rose).

Tiana's the daughter of New Orlean's best seamstress, but she actually wants to follow in her father's footsteps.  Her loving Dad (Terrence Howard) is the best cook on the bayou and he dreams of opening up a fancy restaurant where people of all walks of life will come and enjoy his good food.

Her unlikely friend, Charlotte or Lottie (Jennifer Cody) is the daughter of the wealthiest white man in New Orleans.  She dreams of marrying a Princess.  The girls were first exposed to the classic Princess and the Frog story quite young.  Charlotte's very willing to kiss a frog to get her Prince.  While Tiana does wish on a star, she believes like her father that hard work's the only way to get ahead in this life.

Even after her father's death, Tiana continues to work two jobs saving every penny to get her dream.  The last few dollars to put the downpayment on her dream restaurant come into her hands when word comes that Prince Naveen (Bruno Campos) has come to town seeking a bride.  Charlotte's having a Mardi Gras party that night and she needs a whole lot of beignets to win that man's heart.

But, the Shadow Man has other plans for the Prince.  Dr. Facilier (Keith David) puts a spell on Naveen exchanging him for his manservant.  The prince, who turns out to be a pauper looking for a wealthy woman to marry, is now a frog.

When Naveen sees Tiana clad as a princess, he believes that she's the answer.  All he needs is one kiss, but that kiss turns Tiana green and slimy as well.  The mismatched pair are off on an adventure in the bayou that is going to include characters as diverse as horn playing frogs and philosophical fireflies before the tale is told. Oprah Winfrey makes a brief, but very memorable, appearance as a swamp witch,  Mama Odie.

This Disney children's tale was spot on with the telling.  While we had an evil voodoo villain, Dr. Facilier didn't scare even the youngest kids in the audience because he was done in more of a comic fashion. Randy Newman's jazzy soundtrack was excellent, too.  This is one children's film soundtrack that I suspect many parents will enjoy as well.  I'm definitely buying the soundtrack myself!

4067780,5,B0034JKZ8G,"What strikes me most about this film was not the fact that it was a ""first"" in that this Princess was African American.  What strikes me most is that this Princess is a first for other reasons...she was an independent girl who had a great sense of self, she knew what she wanted, she wasn't afraid of hard work and she wasn't sitting around dreaming and waiting for her Prince to come and save her.  She was practical, hardworking and I LOVED HER!  She is just what our young girls today need to see.  Not some beautiful blonde hanging her hair out of a castle window, or crying for a man she only glimpsed from afar.  We need a girl who rolls up her sleeves and knows what she wants out of life and isn't afraid of the hard work it takes to get there.  I applaud Disney for making a film about a real woman, not some love sick teeny-bopper who wants to marry a man just because he's handsome and he's a Prince.  Bravo!",1260748800,6,919,4.1875
4067781,5,B0034JKZ8G,"this film was so much fun! I definately enjoyed it & would recommend it to anyone. Both the story and the visual effects of the film are beautifully put together - after watching it I was like, ""this is now one of my favorite disney movies"" LOL. I love how all the characters all have a personality, especially the prince (usually in a disney movie there isn't much too the prince) but in this film each character really stands out as their own element and it was truly a joy watching them all interact w/ each other. the film will make you laugh and maybe even cry but i won't say why, no spoilers in this review! :)",1260662400,2,617,4.237288135593221
4067782,5,B0034JKZ8G,"Take the classic fairy tale of the princess who has to kiss a frog to turn him back into a prince, set it in New Orleans, throw in a few practical lessons, like, it's not enough to wish on a star, hard work is also involved, set it to a great score by Randy Newman, with Cajun, Gospel, Dixieland Jazz, and for a little spice, a dash of voodoo; and voila! Gumbo is served.

This return to the classic animation style and musical not seen in these parts since Beauty and the Beast is fun for the whole family. The grown ups might even secretly enjoy it more than the kids. In fact, the young kids in the audience where we saw it were a little frightened by the voodoo, and then grew a little restless as the romance between Tiana and Prince Naveen reached its d&eacute;nouement. But what do they know?

It's great to see the Disney style animation, with the hand drawn characters over the hand painted backgrounds. One scene was even done in Art Deco style. The Art Work was complimented by Randy Newman's songs and score, covering a lush and fertile musical terrain--New Orleans, the birthplace of Jazz, and also Cajun music from the Bayou.

Prince Naveen (Bruno Campos) of Maldonia sounded strangely familiar, so I googled him and found that he had played Diego Vasquez on Christina Applegate's sit com, ""Jesse."" Both characters had the same cadence and accent. I never knew Diego was from Maldonia. Anika Noni Rose, who played Tiana, was in Dreamgirls and From Justin to Kelly, which both had an American Idol Connection. Michael-Leon Wooley, who was also in Dreamgirls, voiced Louis, the trumpet playing gator; but what I wanted to know was, who played Louis' trumpet? Answer: Terence Blanchard. Jim Cummings, who played Cajun Firefly Ray, has done the voices for Winnie the Pooh, and Tigger, too. Oprah Winfrey, chef Emeril Lagasse, Terrence Howard, John Goodman, composer Randy Newman, and Keith David also lent their voices to the project.

Bottom line is The Princess and the Frog is a welcome return to the classic Disney animated musical style that will be enjoyable for the whole family.

Princess Tiana: I mean I didn't even know frogs had lips. How 'bout a nice firm handshake.",1260576000,,4397,7.283018867924528
4067783,5,B0034JKZ8G,"Bam! It's appropriate that Emeril Lagasse plays a (bit) character in The Princess and the Frog, voicing Marlon the `gator. This film proves that Disney's once-vaunted hand-drawn animation is back with a vengeance.

The film has gorgeous visuals, engaging characters, a palpably evil villain and gags galore. Randy Newman's New Orleans-influenced score perfectly complements the story. It is laugh-out-loud funny. The romance between leads Tiana and Prince Naveen is touching and believable. The film's strong, down-to-earth message: You can't just wish upon a star for your dreams to come true. You'll have to work. Hard.

Folks looking for a quality, old-school Disney film will not be disappointed. Like all the best Disney classics, The Princess and the Frog adapts a classic fairy tale and adds twists and wit. This story of hardworking Tiana, aspiring New Orleans restauranteur, and her froggy adventures will engage children and charm their parents. It's a movie that both kids and adults will enjoy.

The supporting characters nearly steal the show. Tiana's friend Charlotte is a hoot: ""I'm sweating like a sinner in church!"" as she sops up the armpits of her Cinderella-esque ballgown. A trumpet-playing alligator, a jowly old lady steeped in hoo-doo, and, especially, a cajun firefly named Ray are originals. Ray's fantasy girlfriend: Evangeline, the evening star.

The visuals have such power. One shot of dandelions covered with droplets of dew is as sumptuous as anything in Disney's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fantasia/dp/B00003CX9W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fantasia</a>&nbsp;from 1940.

A silent funeral in a swamp has a misty, magical beauty.

As the first major Disney movie with African-American lead characters since 1946's The Song of the South, the film doesn't sidestep the race and class issue. At the beginning of the movie, young Tiana and her seamstress mother leave the opulent home of Big Daddy La Bouff to travel to their tiny tract home. Tiana's daddy has to work multiple jobs to support his family; as does the grown-up Tiana, trying to save up enough money to realize her dream of opening a restaurant. Later bankers tell Tiana that a girl of her ""background"" may be better off not having such a dream.

Where have these gifted Disney animators been all these years? It seems they've picked up right where they left off, adding another thoroughbred to the stable of modern-day Disney classics such as 1989's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Little-Mermaid/dp/B000F8O35U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Little Mermaid</a>, 1991's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beauty-and-the-Beast/dp/B00003CX8Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beauty and the Beast</a>&nbsp;and 1994's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lion-King/dp/B00003CXB4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lion King</a>. Maybe it's producer John Lasseter's influence, with his insistence on excellence, especially with story and visuals. Whatever the reason, Walt Disney himself must be smiling in the heavens. Right next to Evangeline.

4067784,4,B0034JKZ8G,"In an age when most animated films are computer generated (including those produced by Disney), ""The Princess and the Frog"" comes along, and it's like witnessing a rebirth. First and foremost, it marks the return of traditional hand-drawn 2-D animation, a process Disney has not used since 2004's ""Home on the Range."" It's once again possible to see an animated film and really appreciate the artistry that went into it - the backgrounds, the color schemes, the articulation, the lighting, the special photographic effects, the form of the line. It doesn't matter that many of the old time animation techniques have been replaced with computers, including the cels and the Ink and Paint department; the style remains true to the classic Disney animated films, as does the manual use of pencil and paper.

The film also marks the return of the animated Disney musical, with a playful and jazzy collection of songs by Randy Newman that play true to the story's New Orleans setting. While nowhere near as memorable or charming as such Disney standards as ""Under the Sea,"" ""Be Our Guest,"" ""A Whole New World,"" or ""Colors of the Wind"" (all scored by Alan Menken, who probably would have been a much better choice for this film), they hold their own in ""The Princess and the Frog,"" expanding the settings and allowing the characters to be even more expressive and appealing.

The plot is perhaps formulaic. But then again, even the most beloved Disney animated films, from ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" to ""Cinderella"" to ""Beauty and the Beast,"" made use of formulaic plots, so I don't see any reason for reinventing the wheel. A reinterpretation of the classic fairy tale ""The Frog Prince,"" it tells of a hard-working waitress named Tiana (voiced by Anika Noni Rose) who dreams of someday opening her own restaurant and doesn't put all her effort into wishing on a star. One day, she crosses paths with the broke Prince Naveen of Maldonia (voiced by Bruno Campos), who was hexed by the conniving voodoo practitioner Dr. Facilier (voiced by Keith David) and turned into a frog. Naveen, believing Tiana to be a princess, begs her to kiss him so that he will return to human form. She agrees to help, but because she isn't royalty, the hex backfires - both Tiana and Naveen are now frogs.

Thus begins a journey through the swamps of Louisiana, where they will not only learn more about each other but also run into a group of colorful side characters. We have Louis (voiced by Michael-Leon Wooley), a trumpet-playing alligator who longs to be human so that he can play in a jazz band. We also have Ray (voiced by Jim Cummings), a Cajun firefly deeply in love with a star in the sky he has named Evangeline. Finally, we have Mama Odie (voiced by Jennifer Lewis), a 197-year-old blind voodoo priestess who may be able to help Tiana and Naveen. Other characters include Naveen's sniveling valet, Lawrence (voiced by Peter Bartlett), Tiana's spoiled debutant best friend, Charlotte La Bouff (voiced by Jennifer Cody), and Charlotte's kindly father, Eli ""Big Daddy"" La Bouff (voiced by John Goodman).

I was especially taken with Dr. Facilier, the most stylish and entertaining Disney villain since Hades from ""Hercules."" Imposingly tall, sinisterly thin, and with an appropriately outrageous getup, he's given the nickname The Shadowman, and for good reason: Much like Gary Oldman's version of Dracula, his shadow is an entity unto itself, able to move freely away from his body and move objects by clutching onto their shadows. His song is delightfully scheming and given some of the best visual treatments, with puffs of lavender smoke swirling mysteriously as voodoo masks come to life and chant in harmony. His manipulation of a deck of tarot cards is fascinating; it's always fascinating to watch a slight-of-hand master at work, even if he happens to be a cartoon character. I leave it to you to discover his evil intentions, but chances are you already have a pretty good idea.

Indeed, ""The Princess and the Frog"" delivers just about everything you've come to expect from a Disney animated film, from the romance between a prince and a commoner to the struggle between good and evil to the belief in dreams someday coming true. But in all honesty, I didn't go into this expecting an original story with newly explored themes; what I was expecting was a fun movie with good characters, and that's exactly what I got. And the artwork is just extraordinary, especially during a fantasy sequence revealing Tiana's vision of her restaurant; stylistically simplistic yet expressive, it evokes the look and feel of a colorful storybook drawing come to life. The scenes in the swamp are also striking, not only because of the actions that take place but also because of the attention to detail, right down to the algae skimming the surface of the water. This is a bright, charming movie, a definite must-see for the entire family.",1260489600,14,4923,4.876941457586619

4067839,3,B0034JKZ8G,"Disney did a valiant effort with this film. 10 years ago kids became enamored with the dazzling colors of 3D animation thanks to Pixar. At the time the technology seemed fresh and studios suddenly realized they could make 3 3D flicks with less cash and time than a full-fledged 2D animated movie. In the world of economics, this meant the death of classic 2D.

Now that it seems like everyone, even 17 year olds in mom's basement are making homemade 3D short films, the novelty has seemed to worn out and kids are growing more receptive to 2D animation. If done well, I really like 3D and feel glad that the cost cutting technology has allowed countries such as Mexico and Argentina to produce a handful of 3D animated blockbusters with increasingly good visuals that are now comparable to the big US studio flicks.

There is something endearing about Tiana's film. It tries to salvage the rich visuals of old school 2D with a huge cultural influence in New Orleans. She has a haughty personality and after being transformed against her will into a frog, she has to team up with a detestable African prince to find a cure to the spell. It gives memories of the oldschool Disney princess films with a huge twist in the plot. There is no more hunky and unidimensional Prince Charming that is merely the end goal of the protagonist. The Frog is a selfish character that probably deserves what happened to him that causes nonstop tension in the story. Visuals are stunning and I enjoyed the scene where both heroes are captured by a group of hunters for dinner.

For all of the good of the movie, the villains unfortunately didn't carry sufficient weight in the story. They cursed the Prince initially to get a ransom from his family and then epicly screwed up. Fair enough, but their personalities are never evolved beyond being bad guys being bad guys. This was a sad surprise given so many of Disney's classic princess flicks had unusually compelling villains. Malificient is angry because Sleeping Beauty's parents didn't invite to their daughter's baptism (still a silly reason to curse their infant daughter but okay enough), Cinderella's Mother-in-law merely puts up with her as a sort of burden from her marriage to her wealthy father and Snow White's Mother-in-law considers her a true threat to her political power.

The second flaw in this film is the slow speed of the plot. The best minutes of the film are the beginning and then while it does sort of move forward, its rather slow and tedious. The movie indeed has a lot of very good things going for it (mainly the quality animation), but it is a bit boring to watch more than once.",1514937600,,2643,4.689655172413793

4067878,2,B0034JKZ8G,"The animation for this movie was lovely, and I love Princess Tiana. She is hard-working and determined, as well as an incredible singer. However, the Voodoo ruined the movie. When the movie was first released, the movie had kids screaming in theaters. I do not see how this was rated G. Other Disney animated movie have been rated PG, so why not this one? Wouldn't you be frightened at the age of 4 if you saw singing, hollow masks with deep voices, or dark and evil spirits moving around? It being frightening for children is not the only thing wrong with it; it just makes the movie darker. EVIL SPIRITS, and what seems like WITCHCRAFT. C'mon. Though there are spirits in Mulan, they aren't evil, and there is plenty of witchcraft in Harry Potter, but it is in a fun and imaginative world with things like Floo powder. THIS takes place in the real world, in a very specific place, New Orleans.

Besides the Voodoo, I didn't like that Tiana was a frog for most of the movie. Is that all we get with an African-American princess?!!

I don't completely dislike the movie; I love Tiana, and the music is real fun. But with the Voodoo and how long Tiana was a frog for 60% of the movie, it's not worth keeping or watching again.",1503705600,,1225,4.44

4067978,5,B0034JKZ8G,"Everyone will love being transported into this creative, inspiring movie, Princess and the Frog. Once you're in, you feel the magic of the movie and you're captivated through every scene. Princess and the Frog has a truly inspiring message that hard work really does pay off. The characters find themselves making new friends, going on exciting adventures, and making their dreams come true. If youve ever wished upon a star, or dreamed of your happily ever after, this movie is perfect for you.
Tiana, never thought of finding her prince charming She had her heart set on working hard to buy her own restaurant, like her and her father had always dreamed of. Soon, the Prince of Maldonia comes to Tianas town in search of a rich, young girl to marry. Hed been cut off from his parents money, and now has to search for his own way in life. When he arrives he meets Dr. Facilier, who uses voodoo to essentially make people's dreams come true. Prince Naveen is convinced that this man can help him find the wife hes looking for. But once he shakes his hand, he his pulled into a different plan. He finds himself turned into a frog and trapped with nowhere to go. During the ball that is thrown in his honor, he has escaped and was on his way to transform back into his human form. He stumbles upon Tiana, wishing upon a star. He mistakes her for a princess, so they kiss in hopes that he will change back into a Prince, but instead, Tiana transforms into a frog too! They go on an exciting adventure together where they meet new friends and discover themselves. They construct a plan to turn back by having Naveen marry Tiana's friend that is a princess, but Naveen cant do it because he is truly in love with Tiana. In the end they eventually kiss and end up transforming back into their human forms. The voodoo doctor is destroyed and Tiana finally gets her happily ever after (and her restaurant.)
With great directors (Ron Clements and John Musker) this movie makes you feel like a kid again. It gets you excited! It makes you feel happy and it teaches important life lessons like developing good friendships and working hard. Some children, however, get scared when ghosts and other scary things are involved in movies like this. In this movie, the voodoo doctor has a lot of ghost type helpers, who contribute to the darkness factor. I think that lots of children could potentially see this as a scary movie. But, other than the voodoo and dark times, this movie has happy, fun-filled, magical moments! At some parts it makes you want to laugh, cry, and even sing! There are catchy songs and awesome characters. This movie was very well put together. There were very distinct, enjoyable characters throughout the whole story line.
The message of this movie is very special. It makes you want to work even harder at everything that you do. It shows that you should have confidence in your work and your decisions and that you don't have to be afraid of being who you are.
This movie is definitely not perfect. There are some flaws to it. But overall, the meaning is touching and the whole movie was put together really well. This is just a feel-good movie with great acting and a wonderful theme. It also centralizes around real world problems too. The movie is set in the 1920s and Tiana lives in an all black community. I think it throws the tiniest bits of history in there, but doesnt over power the movie and story line.
Overall, this movie is a great one. You could watch this movie over and over without getting tired of it. It is so good and it just makes you feel good!",1487721600,,3581,4.5363214837712516

4068007,5,B0034JKZ8G,"Delightful!  A feisty lead with better values than dressing up & marrying a prince -- but enough princess-y and romance-y parts for my girls to love it.

My kids and I are white and it's important that the movies I select for them feature people of color.  The world we live in is not all-white, nor should movies be.

Only drawback: the voodoo was too scary for both my 3yo and 5yo -- though both objected when I suggested turning it off.  It'll be fine -- and they'll understand it better anyway -- when they're a little older.

My 5yo wished Tiana spent more time being a ""princess"" (I could not resist correcting her an saying ""waitress""!  Ha!  Thank you Disney!) and less time being a frog.  I, on the other hand, appreciate any break from all the princess clothing/glamour aspects.

Excellent voice-acting.",1484006400,2,812,4.615384615384615

 The storyline is set in the early 1920's in New Orleans. The heroine is strong willed and determined and thru a series of chance happenings she encounters a self absorbed Prince whose greed gets him turned into a frog and then in an attempt to help him as well as herself she ends up a frog as well. They meet a few unforgettable friends along their journey to become people again and fall in love!!

4068139,4,B0034JKZ8G,"I feel like Disney missed an opportunity here.  This is an ok movie.  Could've been really cool, but they kind of missed the mark.  However, my 4-year-old girl loves it, and it's about GD time Disney had a black princess.

If you're interested here's Roger Ebert's review of the same movie.

The opening scenes of Disney's ""The Princess and the Frog"" are like a cool shower after a long and sweaty day. This is what classic animation once was like! No 3-D! No glasses! No extra ticket charge! No frantic frenzies of meaningless action! And . . . good gravy! A story! Characters! A plot! It's set in a particular time and place! And it uses (calm me down here) lovingly hand-drawn animation that proceeds at a human pace, instead of racing with odd smoothness. I'm just gonna stand here and let it pour over me.

WATCH NOW

The movie, which is sweet and entertaining, doesn't quite live up to those opening scenes. But it's a demonstration that the Walt Disney Studio still shelters animators who know how to make a movie like that, in an age when too many animated films are like fast food after memories of mom's pot roast. My guess is that afterward the poor kids won't feel quite so battered by input overload. The film dances on the screen and doesn't come into the audience and shake you to make you like it.
The story is set mostly in an African-American community in New Orleans, America's most piquant city, before and after World War I. We meet a young girl named Tiana, who is cherished by her mother Eudora (voice of Oprah Winfrey) and father James (Terrence Howard). Her mom is a seamstress, her dad a hard-working restaurant owner who stirs up a mighty gumbo. He goes off to the Army and doesn't return. For Tiana as an adult (Anika Noni Rose) life is a struggle, but she holds fast to her dream of opening a restaurant and serving up her dad's gumbo (with just a soupcon more red sauce).
This is all shown in flowing, atmospheric animation and acted with fetching voices, but the songs by Randy Newman are -- I dunno, do you think he's getting sort of Randy Newmaned out? And the absence of a couple of terrific musical numbers is noticeable, I think, although younger viewers will probably be drawn into the story.
You've heard it before. A princess kisses a frog, and it turns into a handsome Prince Charming. But what if instead she turns into a frog? (Spoiler: That's what happens. ) So now Tiana and the visiting Prince Naveen of Malvonia (Bruno Campos) are both amphibians, although, of course, they retain all of their moral principles and do not perform that act of which frogs are more fond than anything apart from croaking and eating flies.
They're captives of a spell cast by the evil voodoo villain Dr. Facilier (Keith David). But life in the swamp is enlivened by two friends, Louis (Michael-Leon Wooley), an alligator who plays jazz saxophone, and Ray (Jim Cummings), a firefly who fills the Jiminy Cricket slot. They seek the occult Mama Odie (Jenifer Lewis), who may have the power to offset Facilier, and whether Tiana and Prince Naveen are restored and settle down to happy lives of slurping gumbo, I will leave for you to discover.
It is notable that this is Disney's first animated feature since ""Song of the South"" (1946) to feature African-American characters, and if the studio really never is going to release that film on DVD, which seems more innocent by the day, perhaps they could have lifted ""Zip-a-dee Doo-Dah"" from it and plugged that song in here. Though the principal characters are all black (other than the rich man Big Daddy and the Prince, who is of undetermined ethnicity), race is not an issue because Disney adroitly sidesteps all the realities of being a poor girl in New Orleans in the early 1920s. Just as well, I suppose.
""The Princess and the Frog"" inspires memories of Disney's Golden Age it doesn't quite live up to, as I've said, but it's spritely and high-spirited, and will allow kids to enjoy it without visually assaulting them.",1472342400,,3995,4.642149929278642

4068192,5,B0034JKZ8G,"This film is set during the early 1900's in New Orleans. Eudora (Tiana's Mother), is reading a story about The Frog Prince to Tiana, and her friend, Charlotte.  Charlotte has always DREAMED of marrying a prince.  It's all she wants in life, and she is willing to do almost anything to get it.  So now,  fast forward about 15 or 16 years later.  Tiana has grown up now and is working as a waitress at a local restaurant so she can save enough money to start her own restaurant, a dream she shared with her Father who passed away when she was very young. Prince Naveen is in New Orleans trying to find a rich southern belle that he can marry. (Hello, Charlotte is a Rich Southern Belle who wants to Marry a Prince, Perfect combination right!?)  This is where the magic begins!

Prince Naveen was turned into a frog by the witch doctor, Naveen goes to the masquerade ball and meets Tiana who he believes is a princess because of her costume. Naveen asks Tiana to kiss him believing it will turn him back to a human, However when Tiana Kisses him something else happens and she is turned into a frog herself. Now the 2 are on an incredible adventure together in the Bayou.  Will the two become human again like they once were? Will they fall in love!? Will this destroy Charlotte and Tiana's Friendship? Will Naveen end up marrying Tiana's Rich Southern Belle Best friend Charlotte? Oh the questions.  You have to watch this movie to see.

I first saw this movie in theaters with my whole family.  I loved the music and dancing.  The songs just made me want to get up out of my chair,  dance and shout for joy.  I felt like I really was back in early New Orleans.  I loved it so much.  There are very few movies that can keep me glued to my seat the whole time. This was one of them!!  I think I am going to go watch this now!

I bought this movie for my own collection because I think it's a Disney classic!  It's definitely a ""BUY ME MOVIE"" Get it while you can before it goes into the vault.  This is a film like the kids I can watch over and over and never get sick of it. In fact I am not sure who likes this movie more, me or the kids.",1468368000,18,2137,4.178484107579462

4068208,5,B0034JKZ8G,"As an adult, I find this Disney Princess movie very interesting.

Pros:
Tiana is Disney's first African American Princess. Tiana works hard to fulfill her dreams. Hear dream had nothing to do with finding a prince and getting married, hurrah! She is strong and driven. Tiana has a close relationship with her father. Her mother is not an evil step mother. It is a very light hearted movie.

Cons:
Some bloggers have commented about Disney's long over due African American Princess spends a majority of the time as a green frog, along with Prince Naveen, and does not touch on racial issues. Also, I am left wondering if Tiana's mother is or was a slave to character Charlotte La Bouff's family. That's what I thought when I initially watched the movie. Disney does not even try to tackle racial or slave issues in this movie. The animation is not CGI, it is traditional, which in my opinion, makes the movie feel cheap. Also, voodoo is involved, but is probably the least of the issues with this movie.

Overall, I am glad to finally see African American women portrayed as hard working, driven, accomplished and focused. I also appreciate there being a Disney princess who's initial dreams do not include marrying a prince (although it happens anyway.)",1466899200,2,1253,4.791666666666667

4068269,1,B0034JKZ8G,"Disney really shows their intent in this movie that portrays every single white person in a bad light, from fat white male buffoons to a white female IN BED receiving a crown for her SERVICES, to a shallow southern white prima donna chasing after a black prince who is really another fat white buffoon in disguise. The only people to be desired or looked upon kindly in the movie are non-white.

But don't think for a second that this is a good movie for children of color. From start to finish, the movie portrays a black woman as unable to attain her goal, despite being hard-working, single, childless, employed, and living with Mom, thanks to the evil dished out by fat white males, and the mistreatment and manipulation by her own race through voodoo culture, until she marries the frog-prince, thereby obtaining the cash she needs to get what she wants. How shallow, uninspiring, and whiny.

Not-so-subliminal hints in the movie suggest to Tiana (and your child) that she should dig deeper and work harder,"" or just be satisfied with love, not worry about success, when what Tiana really seeks is affirmative action from those evil whites who did nothing more than out-bid her on a property.

How despicably patronizing to push acceptance of failure on a person who is trying to rise off the bottom. Furthermore, Tiana never does get what she wants by working hard. She marries a prince and uses his money to fulfill her dream, which is ok for a fairytale ending, but not so idealistic as some commentators here would have us believe.

This theme is not in any way comparable to the previous princess tales, all of which are based on character, while Tiana solves her financial woes to obtain what she wants by marrying a prince. Furthermore, all the evils in previous princess tales were perpetrated by villains of the same color. Not so for Tiana, who, instead of going to college or working 2 jobs, gets to blame white bankers, who have more money than her, for her problems. It's all about race, all the way through.

I wasn't as put off by the boring but very inappropriate voodoo nonsense. But I did find it terribly disappointing that a dark N'awlins was all Disney could imagine for a black princess theme. There was zero romance, zero feelings from or for any character, nothing endearing said or done by anyone, nothing original. Just a lot of jibber-jabber from start to finish. Even the villains (all the white people) were unconvincing, as was the idea of a prince in New Orleans. (Why not Africa?)

The Princess and the Frog has no foundation beyond (SPOILER ALERT) a waitress expects to buy a restaurant on minimum wage, gets understandably outbid by Whitey, then gets kissed by a frog and turned into one herself. The 2 frogs marry after being traumatized by days of Nawlins voodoo, then turn back into humans. He turns out to be a prince, and now that shes rich, she can buy the restaurant. There is no moral, no lesson, no evil to conquer, no consequences, no LOVE, just a bunch of disconnected nonsense to get rich quick.

Save your money until Disney can set aside their obvious prejudice to produce an African princess who can stand on her own character without resorting to the race card.",1463011200,5,3216,4.691489361702128

4068285,3,B0034JKZ8G,"The Disney princess movies, Hunchback of Notre Dame and Annie 1999 are the main movies I like from Disney, but I put off watching this one for a good while. I wasn't overly interested in watching a movie saturated with feminist preaching about putting off romance for work, with a lazy, inferior male protagonist and a type of music I'm not a fan of. I did watch it out of curiosity last night. Some parts were cute and charming; I didn't fully understand the villains' plot or everything that was going on mainly because of the poor quality of the video I watched, but I understood enough. Black girl lives in old time New Orleans, does menial work to make her dreams come true, ridicules the idea of wishing for your dreams, puts off romance and falls into misfortune because of a lazy, spoiled wisecracking prince. He ends up being told off, ordered around a bit and educated by her and they both realize its the sexiest thing ever, leading to a predictable and kind of forced romance. The ending of the villain was quite disturbing; the movie didn't have enough charm to make up for it. It may be 2d, but its not on par with the Renaissance movies.",1461888000,,1152,4.4904761904761905

4068371,4,B0034JKZ8G,"I loved this movie by and large.

It was annoying that the plot shifted back and forth, and that the demons or whatever that were hunting our friends had inexplicable setbacks.  Instead of the usual magic, Disney invoked superstition.  I think I prefer magic, actually!

Anyway, the voices were wonderful, including all the swamp characters.  I was also unsatisfied with the art of the big alligator (Louis?) and the two frogs; it seemed that they were slapped together rather carelessly.  It's also funny seeing big white teeth in a frog.

<sigh> But I suppose, the artists and animators did the best they could with what they had.  But I wish the entire movie had gotten the full treatment, instead of just a few stills being drawn in stunning detail.",1455753600,,753,4.782945736434108

4068587,5,B0034JKZ8G,"My 2 y.o. and I watch this movie at least once a week (for a while, it was once a day). LOL. She loves the songs and can quote you the film from top to bottom. She has a host of other Disney movies (what child doesn't?), but it wasn't until after watching this film that she started calling herself a Princess.

I don't think she quite understands how important it is yet, to see a character that looks like you shown in a LEAD part, who is complex and strong but also vulnerable, but I do. Many of us WOC grew up with Disney where the # of non-White princesses that have led films in its 95-year history can be counted on one hand: Princess Jasmine, Pocahontas, Princess Kida, Mulan, and Tiana (Moana will join them in 2018), in a world of Barbie dolls with whitewashed features (even the supposedly ""ethnic"" ones) understand the implicit message of such marketing-- that we are undesirable, unworthy of love-- and it's well overdue media began to correct it.
While I wish Tiana spent more time on-screen as a human rather than a frog, there is plenty to love about this story and kudos for setting it in Louisiana.",1439078400,,1116,4.41747572815534

Colors are bright and vibrant as there's different parts in the movie that have cydelic movements of colors.

But the voodoo is portraying the bad guy to which every movie has a ""bad guy"" per say. I liked the movie myself. I will warn you to the fainest of heart and fragile little one's like my own 7 year old daughter, there is a part that will/can make one cry, as she did and does every single time she watches it. But all in all it's a good movie with a good ending.

4068638,3,B0034JKZ8G,"When this movie first came out, our family didn't like it and we found it boring. At that time, our family had never visited New Orleans where this movie is set. Fast forward some years and our opinion of this movie has changed from yuck to it's okay. After a trip to New Orleans we can understand and appreciate this movie and it doesn't seem so dark.
When we see the cable cars, we can remember seeing and riding in one. When the scene goes through the garden district, memories of those southern homes and their iron fences are brought forth. The swamp scene reminds us of swamp tours and the movie's dark cemetery scenes are the cemetery that tourists like to visit.
We even think we saw Jackson Square in the movie and of course beignets with lots of powdered sugar are present. Food, and her wanting to open a restaurant, is big in the movie because good food is big in New Orleans.
Someone at Disney obviously loves New Orleans and they put the time and energy into bringing their love for this city alive.
As for the prince, yes, he was a jerk in the beginning but wasn't the Beast also a jerk in Beauty and Beast?  Yet Belle and the audience fell in love with him. Unfortunately, a frog isn't as warm and cuddly as a beast who looks like an overgrown dog with tender eyes, but he's still a beast in his own way.
Disney recently showed this movie on their cable channel and we decided to watch it again with our three year old granddaughter. She was not frightened in any way and  she asked to watch it again the next day. Fortunately, we had a copy of the movie.  What also was unique about the movie was this was a princess that didn't look like any other, she became a princess in a America and after she became a princess, she and the prince rolled up their sleeves and worked. There is no horse and carriage, people in waiting, balls, etc. but it's still a satisfactory ending.",1434844800,,1890,4.333333333333333

We have all these other princesses set in their times with most everything true to form in historical and ethnic settings.  So, why this monstrosity?  I refuse to show it to my children because This film is in no way true to the classic literature by the same name.  I understand wanting to give a portrayal of an African American princess, but if they are going to do that they need to honor and respect everyone involved and choose a African princess from an African tale.  That would be a film I could support and show my children.  That sort of film would get the interested in other similar works of African stories and tales.  This film has none of that.  This film is not set up to encourage children to read or pick up any book.  It comes across as a weakly done film, only done to please a select few.",1431648000,5,908,4.2631578947368425

4068723,4,B0034JKZ8G,"Remember that shout of joy you heard when Disney announced they were returning to 2D animation?  That was me.  Don't get me wrong, I've enjoyed many of the computer animated movies being produced these days, but I find hand drawn animation to be a wonderful art form.  There is something about it that is just magic.  So you'd better believe I planned my schedule to go see The Princess and The Frog on opening night.

Our story is set in jazz era New Orleans.  Tiana (Anika Noni Rose) has inherited her father's dream of opening a restaurant.  She's taken two jobs to not only pay the bills but save up enough money to buy the property she needs.  And just when it looks like her dreams will come true, they are horribly dashed.

Tiana finds herself at a masquerade ball to welcome the visiting Prince Naveen (Bruno Campos).  Alone on a balcony, she is horrified to find a frog talking to her.  The frog claims he is the prince but transformed through voodoo by Dr. Facilier (Keith David).  Tiana overcomes her revulsion to frogs to kiss him, only to find herself transformed into a frog instead of Naveen freed from his cursed form.  Then, the two find themselves in the bayou.  Can they find a way to undo the curse and return to New Orleans?

One of the things that excited me most about this story was that it was a fresh twist on the traditional fairy tale.  I mean, this isn't how the story is supposed to end.  The twist did allow us to see some of the usual Disney notes like the crazy talking animal sidekicks, but they really added to the story.  And speaking of twists, I was surprised by a few turns of the plot.

The traditional fairy tale, even as encompassed by Disney, teaches that dreams come true.  This one goes a step beyond that.  The moral here is that you must work to see our dream come true.  In fact, Tiana is contrast with a friend who spends her whole life wishing and reading fairy tales.

The other half, however, is to enjoy life.  As such, Naveen and Tiana make a great balance.  He is all fun all the time while she is all work and no play.  As you can imagine, they do have something to teach each other here, but we get the benefit of both without any preachiness.

More than any previous Disney film, I felt like I was transported to another time and place.  This was New Orleans during the 20's.  While it occasionally came through in the dialogue, it was most noticeable in the costumes and the look of the film.  The background artwork was truly beautiful.

On a related note, there were several money shots in this film.  At times I found myself sitting back and enjoying how scenes were constructed.  One moment in the swamps took my breath away.  The animators weren't just going through the motions.  They truly put their heart and soul into their work.

The Jazz Age influence also comes through in the music.  There are quite a few new songs, all of them with a definite jazz feel that makes you want to get up and dance, or tap your foot at the very least.

The voice actors are perfectly cast.  To be honest, I wasn't too familiar with many of the leads.  But the important thing is how they do, and for that it is perfect.  I got caught up in the characters, and that's the most important thing.  They do have some big names like Oprah, Terrence Howard, and John Goodman in supporting roles, and they are all great.

Considering that voodoo played a large part of the plot and the shots I had seen of the villain, I was a little concerned he might turn out to be scary.  I don't think he was that bad.  Jafar from Aladdin or Ursula from The Little Mermaid are actually scarier than he is.  Not that he's not effective as the villain.  He's just not as likely as some to give your kids nightmares.

So with all this praise, I must admit I was slightly disappointed by the film.  I'm sure part of it is because I was expecting too much from it.  I'm not sure any film could have met my overblown fan boy expectations.  And the others might have been caused by the three-year-old girl sitting next to me who insisted on talking the entire way through the film (and yet somehow I was the bad guy for being annoyed).

As much as I enjoyed the songs, there were just too many of them.  Just about every character got their own song.  While none of them were bad by themselves, they added up to too much of the movie for me.

Secondly, the predictable character transformations came too quickly.  It seemed like in one scene Tiana and Naveen were one way and the next thing you know they had changed.  While I liked how they ended the story, spending a little more time developing their changes would have made it better.

Again, I was probably expecting too much from the film.  It was certainly enjoyable, and I will add it to my collection without hesitation.

The Princess and The Frog will become a Disney classic.  And with its realistic and balanced approach to making your dreams come true, that's certainly a great thing.  I just wish a couple of things had been smoothed out before it was released.",1430179200,,5050,4.381877022653722

4068752,4,B0034JKZ8G,"I like this one so much more than tangled, and even frozen to be honest. I like that this movie shows that hard work and having what you NEED rather than what you WANT are  what's best for a happy life. Just what kids need to hear in an instant gratification society.

Lots of sad and a bit scary parts which need parental guidance. I struggle to keep it together during the parts with tiana's dad, I lost mine recently and his life story is very much like tiana's father's in the movie. He never got what he wanted but he had what he needed.

Unfortunately the songs aren't that catchy (I love them but my daughter is like 'whatever') and the story goes over her head. I'm thinking this movie is best for ages 7-12, in order to get the most from it.",1427587200,,750,4.194444444444445

Some of the story elements may be a little scary for very young viewers (the Shadowman's connection to the spirit world), but all in all, it's very family friendly.

4068858,5,B0034JKZ8G,"When I first saw this in theaters, I wasn't disappointed but I was extremely impressed either. Now after watching this movie multiple times at home I can say it stands with any of the Golden or Renaissance era films. One thing of note is that the music isn't as cute and immediately catchy or singable as songs like Under the Sea, Can't Wait to Be King or Let It Go but they fit the movie perfectly. It also has a dark tone and subtle humor which might not resonate with some. I also don't think some will like the colloquial Louisiana speech/accents of the characters if you're not used to it.

The good points: the leads voice actor is an amazing singer and does an especially good job giving the final number punch.
The animation is lush. I read that a lot of the art is actually 2d digital but you'd never know. My favorite scene is the gazebo scene with the wisteria, it looks so beautiful!
I think they did an okbalancing act with trying to make an all audience film and still include some racial elements, but was a little disappointed. I was of the camp that wanted Tiana to be a maid and did wish they had atleast said ""black"" or even ""African American"" one time.
Being from Louisiana I really enjoyed the influences and at parts felt life it was made just for us ""Y'all from Shreveport?!""

All in all a great movie and deserves a watch.",1419724800,3,1346,4.3585657370517925

The characters are fun and endearing.  While some of the scenes with the voodoo villain may be too scary for the really young kids, most of the story will engage the children.",1419292800,,349,4.88135593220339

4068899,5,B0034JKZ8G,"First off, BEWARE, this disc is REGION ""A"" LOCKED. Although the back cover clearly indicates this would play on A-B-C players, my region free Blu-ray player still couldn't play it and I got a message that the disc is region locked. It will let you choose your language and then the message will pop. I'm in the process of returning it to Amazon and have already ordered the region B disc from Amazon UK. I was very surprised by this as I have about 15 Disney Blu-ray movies from Amazon.com and they all play fine but after a bit of online searching I found out that this movie was the last one to be region locked, meaning an earlier film like Bolt would face the same problem but later films will play just fine.

As for the movie, it is absolutely fantastic. One of my favorite Disney movies of all time, right up there with their 90's stuff. The voodoo and the New Orleans settings inspired the filmmakers for some breathtaking imagery and the film is therefore very atmospheric and visually dazzling. The songs are top-notch, my personal favorites include Almost There and Down In New Orleans.

Highly recommended.",1416700800,,1118,4.613065326633166

4069083,3,B0034JKZ8G,"The film stars the voices of Anika Noni Rose, Bruno Campos, Keith David, Oprah Winfrey, Jim Cummings, and others. The film veers from little kiddie naivete to tragedy. One of the good guys (a firefly named Raymond) dies and stays dead [unusual for Disney to do that]. Also, for a time, the two humans turned frogs stay as frogs (by choice), but unexpectedly turn into humans again after a voodoo lady marries them. No ""Shrek"" ending. Too bad. There are way, way, way too many songs in this Disney cartoon. Funny, because for a while Disney stopped making musicals [see their ""Atlantis""], but this is a deliberate throwback to the princess movies of the Disney early years, with lots of copying from The Jungle Book transferred to the Louisiana bayous [No Creedence Clearwater Revival ""Born on a Bayou""? Too bad]. I have to say I did like it, but not too much. Has too much singing. The animation has classic Disney 2-D cell animation. This time, however, the character Tiana was given lots of faults (overly practical, focused on her job, workaholic, no time for partying), while her erstwhile lover Naveen was a party boy with no career skills at all. So they traded off their virtues and faults as frogs. There were a few weird scenes, especially involving voodoo shadow man Dr. Facilier [best part of the movie] and the blind witch in the swamp. They had their usual comic sidekicks, such as Louis the trumpet-playing alligator [who reminded me of the fat cat who played the trumpet in ""The Aristocats,"" a funnier movie]. Actually I'm glad I waited for the video before seeing this movie, as so many songs would have gotten me impatient in the theatre. Stop singing--do something! Funny scenes: In which they start to take on froglike behavior, such as flapping their long tongues and using their tongues to escape humans. In fact, lots of tongue gags in the film. Funniest scene is when Tiana first looks in the mirror and sees she is a frog and screams. The setting is Dixieland 1920s New Orleans. A fantasy landscape as there is no racism shown. The whites accept the blacks and the blacks accept their position in life. In the film blacks and whites get on just fine, though there is a hint of segregation where Tiana's parents live. But the producers wanted to keep that G rating, so no racial conflict was shown. Surprising that it had that rating considering one of the characters dies. Animation style changes according to mood, and especially when they break into song--then some of the drawing becomes crude and flat. So, no-time-for-parties girl marries a once rich, rich ne'er-do-well party animal. Will the marriage last? Will Dr. Facilier come back to bring excitement to the plot? This is a film in which the villain is the best part of the story.",1398729600,,2765,4.738589211618257

4069112,5,B0034JKZ8G,"Disney Studios 49th full length animated feature film The Princess And The Frog is a return to the hand drawn animation that made the studio what it is today. Looking at The Princess And The Frog it is clear that this type of animation is not dead, outdated or quaint. It's simply gorgeous to look at and full over vivid characters and lively music, it is is also the return to Disney's traditional musical.

Like many Disney films this one has some dark moments and could scare the really,little ones, but characters like Raymond are sure to relieve some of that anxiety. The Blu Ray looks and sounds fabulous, but the bonus material isn't as extensive as some other titles, what is here is pretty good.

Last night, I decided to sit back and give it a look see, and what a surprise it was!  I loved the story, the music, the animation, you name it.  This movie is top notch.  The excitement and action seem to pop off the screen!  There were a few places where I wondered if the film might be a little scary for young ones; like when the voodoo monsters do their thing.

4069132,3,B0034JKZ8G,"At first I thought it was weird that the only disney movie with a black princess movie has predominantly Jazz music in it... as if to say you can only have black characters if the music is ""black"" too.  But that notion quickly faded for me.  The setting is New Orleans so that helped the Jazz make more sense and make it seem more about place than race.  (although the random R&B music that starts when the credits roll is highly suspect)

Tiana is adorable and very likable.  As a character she can easily be people's favorite disney princess so I think the reason this movie isn't as well known is perhaps because of lack of marketing.  I never heard of this movie and didn't know it existed until I stumbled upon it accidentally. Her best friend is a little nuts and spoiled, but in a cute kind of way that makes you like her too.  I did not like how the voodoo villain was drawn.  It just looked cheesy to me.  A skull and bones top hat?  Really?  And they spend a little too much time in the beginning trying to show how ""evil"" he is with over the over the top gestures he makes.

Overall this film probably has the best message out of any disney film so far.  As others have noted there is a message of - if you want something, you have to work for it rather than only sitting on your butt and wishing on a star.  But the REAL moral of the story that is repeated throughout is - The things you want in life are not the same as what you NEED in life.  Tiana's father lived his life unable to realize his desires, but she realizes that though he never achieved what he wanted, because he had a loving family, he had everything he needed- and he knew this.  It's a very spiritual movie in this sense.  I recommend it.",1391299200,4,1720,4.179331306990881

4069138,5,B0034JKZ8G,"+

  We don't see too many movies about black, African American Princesses, in general, which is one of the things that makes

this movie so unique and different from all the other Disney Princess movies, as well as all -other- movies, generally speaking, of

course.

  Still , she -is- a Princess, deserves all fair treatment that any Princess should, despite really trying, tough, seemingly impossible

obstacles, that she -overcomes-, and -that- is one of the many things that I see that makes this movie -similar- to other Disney

films, generally speaking, of course.

  I believe that it would be great to see more of this kind of thing in the future from Disney, and -anywhere-.

  It's -nice- to be included sometimes,

  whether or not others somehow happen

  to know you are a

  beautiful

  interesting

  imaginative

  person.

  Thanks for reading.

I love the twist of Tiana becoming a frog and experiencing the same thing prince naveen does. And I love how they both learn that it's not always greener on the other side. The story takes place in New Orleans. She's poor and works very hard to save money to purchase her own restaurant, he's royalty but has been cut off family money due to being irresponsible, they both haven't taken the time to realize that true happiness is finding love and building something on that. But their journey together in the bayou with unexpected friends along the way makes them realize what's missing in both of their lives and it ends very sweetly.

There is also a ""Good Guy Death"" scene and a major character looses their father (not seen, but mentioned a few times).

I really wanted to love this story but it had no redeeming points. The prince was a jerk throughout the entire movie, even to the end. The racial stereotypes are sad and exaggerated, as if having an african american princess makes the rest ok. Then there's the voodoo. Magic is one thing, but the extent of voodoo and dark spirituality used was disturbing - certainly not something suitable for children.

I would have preferred that she spent less time as a frog and actually found an African-American prince. Love is love but ancestry is so beautiful and it does matter. Clearly kids and adults are heavily influenced by the images they see. I think it is great to see more beautiful African-American couples loving and respecting each other even if it is in an animated film.

I think this is the first Disney princess to be from a distinctive place--United States.  Mulan technically isn't a princess and Brave is in Scotland but was released after The Princess and the Frog.  But like Ariel, Aurora and the others I don't think they are ever given an extant geographical location--Once upon a time in a land far far away I guess lol",1380844800,,501,4.595505617977528

My niece also loves watching it with me! Some crazy people are concerned about the voodoo scenes being too scary I'm sure, but I would disagree, and my princess and rainbow loving 3 year old niece has never had a problem with it. These songs stay with me for days, and there was a period of time when I was watching this movie at least once a day with my little girl! It'll never beat out ""Tangled"", I'm sure, but this could be her 2nd favorite movie, and it's definitely one of my top 10 disney favorites.",1380412800,2,848,4.208588957055214
4069194,5,B0034JKZ8G,"A) Don't listen to the religious fanatics who have negative things to say about this movie. Those who live by the code, ""Thou shalt not judge"", are usually the first to cast stones. What good is the testimony of a hypocrite? Trust me, The Princess & the Frog has absolutely nothing to do with encouraging the use of dark magic. Voodoo is simply used as a cinematic device to emphasize the overall life lesson of the movie. And that is the very hard fact that nothing worth having is achieved through magic or wishing. It teaches children the value of hard work & not taking ""the easy way out"". Your children will not become evil & join a cult after watching this. And it will not give them nightmares. My 7 year old niece & 4 year old nephew LOVE this movie. Should a child be accompanied by an adult while viewing this? As with all tv, YES. People should stop counting on TV to raise their children the way they want them to be raised. Tv cant take the place of your duties as a guardian.

B) This movie is not racist. People are only saying it's racist because for the first time in a Disney movie, predominately white characters are not at the forefront of the plot. There is nothing wrong with highlighting a specific race or culture in a Disney film. Disney's been doing it with American whites for years... And for anyone saying this movie is racist towards African Americans, no dice. I've been to New Orleans & I'm quite the history buff. The portrayal of both AA & white cultures in 1930s New Orleans society is right-on-point. Nothing vaguely racist about it.

As a bi-racial person (both African American & Swiss American), I personally enjoyed this movie the million times I've watched it. It has fantastic meaning & the story-line truly is captivating. If you can get past the restraints that religion places on society & just watch this movie with an OPEN MIND, you'll enjoy it. Trust me.",1380326400,,1902,4.526162790697675

As far as the story goes I am not going to bother with the navel-gazing exercise on the racial issues, who cares? This is simply a fun, joyous, warmhearted movie that anyone and everyone can enjoy; I am a 54 year old man, not the typical target audience for the movie, and I just love it. Beautifully rendered on Blu-Ray, great score by Randy Newman, HAND DRAWN (I just cannot say that enough!), great cast of characters,  and if you are not cheering wildly for sweet little Tiana at the end and getting a little misty-eyed at the wedding...well, you must be a communist and go back to the USSR, that's all I gotta say.....",1378512000,3,932,4.482352941176471

We listen to the Cd which i think is fun and has great songs too. she gets a little scared with the demons from the other side and we hide under a blanket for second but otherwise its a good hearted love story with cute characters, a little stereotypical, like the lightingbug Ray being a bit toothless from the Bayou but all Disney movies seem to have that element in them. Overall super cute with a strong female lead that stands on her own 2 feet without being ""rescued"" by a man! Yeah!!!",1378166400,,542,4.221153846153846

This movie was actually hand drawn using digital tablets so it has that traditional hand-drawn Disney look but because they did it digitally, it still has that stunning saturated digital appearance.  The storyline is typical Disney princess but the voice actors are wonderful and the soundtrack is amazing!

4069223,4,B0034JKZ8G,"Bowling for Movies Score: 192 of 300
What is Bowling for Movies you might ask - it's a score that I, just your average dude, have come up with to rate and score movies.  I gotta lot time on my hands and I watch movies - many MANY movies.  Using the latest technology and a mixture of pseudo and quasi science, I have developed a formula (which literally has nothing to do with bowling) to capture the pure essence of Hollywood magic... displayed as a score ranging from 0 to 300.  A score of 108 would be a ""just ok, not particularly good / bad"" movie, where a score of 192 would tell you it was a very good movie.  Now, break 200 and you've got something really special.  Throw too many ""gutterballs"" will land you under 100 and well - you get the idea. :]

The Princess and The Frog - We have the 1-Disc DVD - soon to be upgraded to BLU RAY

Movie Explanation (no-there is too much, let me sum up):
""Jazzed up"" (literally) retelling of a classic fairytale set in the happening town of New Orleans during the golden age of jazz... standard Disney fare with plenty of story spins, new friends, exciting locations, good music, and even some tragedy.

Overall I really liked this movie - it was set in a fun time and in a fun place (New Orleans).  The marketing campaign didn't do this movie any favors and I really didn't want to see it but my daughter got her way (and I got mine because I bought the cheapest version I could get my hands on) and I was so corrected.  I headed into this movie with a bad attitude and quickly found myself lost in the magic of the city and time and riding a rollercoaster of emotion - from happy, sad, scared, enchanted, amused, horrified, stupefied, and frankly cheerfully exuberant (and I'm a dude).  We have a running joke in this house - If it's a Disney flick - SOMEONE HAS TO DIE  - how many parents have to die for a Disney story (at least one per film, right ha!) but this film had a seriously tragic spot worthy of a rather large snot bubble and some mournful blubbering (my daughter was right there to comfort me).  This movie has more heart than, um, your average earthworm?  That sounded better in my head but you get the point.  I have few purchasing regrets and this was one of them - I went cheap when I should have gone all the way - this movie is slated for a BLU RAY UPGRADE :]

What I loved:
1.  Fits right into the Disney family of movies with modern sensibilities
2.  Truly funny character doing funny things  - a chipped tooth has never made me laugh more
3.  Disney captured the essence of southern Louisiana culture from The Big Easy to the backwoods bayou

What I did NOT like:
1.  Traditional animation with many spectacular scenes gives way to less than great segments with poor detail, no shading, and a straight to home video feel
2.  Very young children could be scared of the many voo-doo sequences and spooky shadow spirits
3.  Surprise twist ending left me feeling sheepish - I should have seen that coming (because it really was that obvious) yet, nobody here figured it out

The second time through I was better able to appreciate how amazing the plot truly is. This movie makes excellent use of the full color spectrum, creating an animated film more colorful and vibrant than any I can remember. The characters are believable, the setting (at least in animation) is new and interesting, and the villain is unique both in his methods and personality.

4069229,5,B0034JKZ8G,"I had read some reviews on Amazon before buying this that said kids were scared. It was not any scarier than any other kid's movie. It taught a good lesson about what's important in life, and finding balance. Unfortunately there is evil in the world, but I thought this movie did a good job addressing that in a kid friendly way.

4069232,5,B0034JKZ8G,"I respect the philosophy of Walt Disney, and ""The Princess and the Frog"" continues in his tradition. It has messages all through it, to have a dream, never to give up, racial tolerance, kindness, forgiveness, on and on. I also appreciate that it advocates the Christian aspect of values such as marriage, family, prayer, love, etc. without alienating non-Christians. I love the contemporary cartooning style, which gives such lifelike and amusing expressions to the characters--much more recognizable as those seen in friends and acquaintances. I loved this production so much I bought it after seeing it.",1372896000,,605,5.3125

Sure, I was raised on your Snow Whites and Little Mermaids, but once I started making my own decisions about movies, I moved onto manga and Tarantino flicks. Princess and the Frog, however, is a beautiful exception. Not only does it feature a headstrong, lovable lead character that doesn't fall into the ""damsel in distress"" tropes that Disney is often known for, but it has a lively, unique story with great music and a wonderful message.

This movie is a lot of fun.  I think the music was my favorite aspect of the movie.  The music was so happy and upbeat, which, in my opinion, helps make disney movies so great.

4069247,5,B0034JKZ8G,"The Princess and the frog is one of Disney's questioned movie. Most people dislike the need for the shadow man, who tricks the Prince's butler into doing his will. Some people feel that the shadow man and ""his friends on the other side"" are not appropriate to be showing to children. That may be true for some children who would cry from very minor scares. I chose this rating because the shadow man is just another bad guy in another disney movie. It just shows that there ARE bad guys out there that are going to trick you and make your life harder than it is. I also chose this rating because Tiana teaches young people the value of hard work and ""that star is only going to get you part of the way"". The Princess and the Frog is a great movie that I enjoy watching. I  love it all. I recommend this movie to all ages, but it would be great for children @ least 7-whatever age children are developing their own values.

4069255,4,B0034JKZ8G,"I was accidentally tipped off two a few crucial details early on so a large amount of the plot was a bit ruined for me tried as I might avoid knowing anything. Despite this, the movie was incredibly enjoyable. <No spoilers below>

The film started off quite well, introducing the main character, her role, and passion was very important before threatening it to jump-start the story. The supporting character (blond chick can't remember her name), was excellent. I thought she was going to be a witch or sub-villain, the snobby up-nosed friend. But she wasn't. That's what I liked about her so much, she was a real good friend. I was quite horrified to see her after the intro when the characters are grown up as giddy as she was, but she was really fun.

I did not care for the villain. Classic Disney isn't the best with villains IMO (Gaston and Frollo the exceptions), but this guy was downright shallow. His motives were unclear and very poor. Sure he was a bit scary and clearly evil but I was hoping that maybe he would've been introduced early on in the beginning as well. Instead he just sort of, popped up.",1369094400,,1115,4.54228855721393

The New Orleans setting is a nice change from the usual fairy tale fantasy, and the strong female lead makes for a good role model.  I have to say the ""shadow man"" scenes were a good bit scarier than they really needed to be, but our daughter wasn't bothered by them.  Hard to say what is/isn't scary for a young child, they're all different, but you may need an itchy trigger finger on the remote just for these couple of scenes.  The songs in the movie are awesome, best music ever in a Disney kid's movie IMO.",1368576000,,644,4.211382113821138

There is a lot of voodoo references and there are dark spirits at the end of the movie that may be scary for some kids.  We didn't care for the voodoo aspect at all.

4069314,4,B0034JKZ8G,"I loved this movie, so much that I actually wanted to re-watch it the day after I saw it on NetFlix.  I am so glad Disney decided to use the classic animation for this film - it makes Tiana blend in with the other princesses, rather than stand out like a glaring CGI character.  I think that this film filled a gap in Disney's repertoire of animated classics.  Little girls watching Disney movies want to identify with the princess, after all, and until this film, there were no African-American heroines in Disney's lineup.  Sure, the film stereotypes both white and black people, but that's nothing new; every Disney movie exaggerates a stereotype...or three or four.  The ending was predictable, but isn't every Disney movie?  It's a children's film, after all.
However, I was a little put off by certain elements of the film.  First, this is a princess fairytale movie...set in 20th century U.S.  This seemed like an odd choice, because the U.S. has never participated in a royal system, and princess stories don't usually take place in the 1900s.  Second, I was perturbed by the excessive use of voodoo throughout the film.  As a Disney fanatic, I am well aware of the use of magic, spirits, etc. in every film.  However, unlike other films, voodoo wasn't an explanation for a magical carriage appearing out of nowhere, it was a central theme to the story.  The Shadow Man repeatedly cast spells, communicated with ""the other side,"" summoned evil spirits, and was finally dragged by said evil spirits to ""the other side"" after he failed to repay a debt.  There were musical numbers celebrating his love of the other side.  Even the version of a ""fairy godmother"" Disney bestowed upon Tiana was a voodoo woman.  As an adult, I was uncomfortable with the heavy-handed application of voodoo.  Unlike other forms of ""magic"" portrayed in Disney's films, voodoo is a real-life practice that many people still participate in, silly or pointless as it may seem.  I suppose Disney had to come up with some way to transform a New Orleans girl into a fairytale princess, and due to the lack of enchanted forests or special lamps, they grabbed voodoo for its link to New Orleans' history.  I took away one star for the creepy voodoo, but overall, this is a must-see film, and one of my new personal favorites.",1363132800,,2302,4.755667506297229
4069315,5,B0034JKZ8G,"This is a good movie with a good lesson - don't jump to conclusions about people because of their looks. It was a fun, funny, and a good new princess tale.",1362787200,,155,4.032258064516129

4069324,5,B0034JKZ8G,"I would give the film itself about 4 stars, but the high def presentation of it takes it all the up for me.  Next to Sleeping Beauty, this is the best looking cell-animated Blu-ray disc I own.

About the film: I was pleasantly surprised that Disney embraced what some would hypersensitively label stereotypical black characteristics: voodoo, street dancing, and the little display the cook puts on while he's making fun of Tiana's dream of a downpayment is almost a self-mockery of blacksploitation theatrics.  They really took some chances, and the results are thrilling.  I think black culture is too important and genuine to tiptoe around, and Disney, of all entities, actually did it right.

The cajun accent of the lightning bug sounded contrived I thought, but it's growing on me.  I've seen the movie three times now, and so far it keeps getting better.  I think this one will age very well, and will be considered a top 15-or-so all time Disney animated feature (not counting Pixar) when it's all said and done.  Maybe even top 10.  And for high def presentations, top 5.  Highly recommended. This movie is a blast and a treat for the eyes.

Oh, lastly, I should put in a word for the sound.  I don't have a fancy set-up, but even on my little Sony sound bar, this is one of the richest sounding blu-rays I've heard.",1362268800,8,1324,4.6594827586206895

4069328,3,B0034JKZ8G,"This movie would have been great if the voodoo elements had not been so dark and scary. I am frustrated with this trend in Disney movies of making the scary parts too scary for their intended audience of young children. My kids are 6 and 8, and I had to have them close their eyes and plug their ears for 2 or 3 scenes that are downright occult-ish and demonic. We wanted to watch the movie because we are going to see Disney on Ice and the Princess and the Frog story is included in the show, so I thought it would help them to know what was happening during the show. And like I said, it's a good movie overall, but the occult stuff (blood magic, tarot, demonic shadows, etc.) really freaked me out as an adult - definitely not okay for children!",1361404800,2,748,4.201388888888889

4069345,2,B0034JKZ8G,"This is by far the most disappointing Disney movie I have seen. The animation, story and acting all lack creativity, polish and originality. My wife and I are big fans of animation and this was a big disappointment for us both. It felt much like a direct to DVD sequel of another movie but it wasn't. Disney had actually released this in theaters but it had a very short run. The film is available on NetFlix now and is hardly worth the time. The drawing in the animation felt rushed and unfinished. The story was a mixture of something classic with a modern twist but very poorly executed. It might pass for the youngest of minds but even then, it's a bit to frightening for young children, and for older kids it's certainly not the best of the bunch.",1358985600,,752,4.41726618705036

Still, with no intention of dissuading anyone, I have to say I was instantly put off by this cartoon.  It didn't help that I've read the book that supposedly ""inspired"" this movie ""in part.""  From what I could tell that meant they only liked E.D. Baker's title and felt the need to make a nod in that direction......buried deep in the closing credits.  I suppose this absolved them of their usual penchant for ruining so many brilliant children's books; it's their forte.  Regardless, I couldn't find much about this movie that I did enjoy, just one song (Dig a Little Deeper), and a couple of fun moments I completely forgot once the movie left them behind.  For me, this movie was unusually dismal, too much evil and way too much spite.  I was totally unimpressed and quickly gave it away, no desire to ever want to watch it again.  To put it bluntly, it was simply a stale recycling of old themes handled in the usual fashion with the expected results, few surprises along the way.

4069378,5,B0034JKZ8G,"Laurine T. says:
I absolutely must chime in. The music in the movie: I love the music myself. It is upbeat and always manages to put a smile on my face. Given the plight of African Americans in this country, upbeat is good! The music does not rival the music in previous disney movies. However, I personally think that is acceptable. The music in previous Disney Movies was a classic and as time goes on many classic things are hard to reproduce. This may have something to do with the dumbing down of America. A NATION THAT FORGETS GOD SHALL PERISH. DEUTERONOMY 8:1-20. It is just like the classic TCM Turner movies. We will never see movies like Sidney Poitier did ever again. Sean P Diddy Combs and Phylicia Rashad did a remake of the movie, A Raisin in The Sun. It did not even come close to the original play or movie. It was 100% forgettable! On another note, Taye Diggs was compared to Sidney Poitier at the beginning of his career. I did not see the comparison at all. There will never be another Sidney Poitier. He walked into Hollywood and took it by storm. He proclaimed that he was not a black man. He was just a man! He knew something about his identity (who are you?) He refused to accept society's devaluation of him.
I think it is great to critique movies and all. However, I hope we can be very joyful and super glad this movie has been made. A milestone was reached in America and it is in the aftermath of a horrible slave trade that should have never happened in the history of mankind. Our African ancestors should have never had a price tag put on them and sold!!! This is preposterous and an abomination! If anyone has not studied up on the origin of mankind and how humans begin in Africa, please research this. You will find out why our hair is different from everyone else and our skin pigmentation. This information was life changing for me. Please read about the rivers mentioned in Genesis that are in Africa and come to your own conclusion about the first humans on earth and how they looked. (Jesus had hair of wool. All the photos I saw as a child portrayed him incorrectly.) During your reading please consider whether God just made humans or was God about making some people look better than others. You will be as astounded as I was to find out that God was all about geography and protection only when it came to skin pigmentation, hair type, and eye color. (All are Equal in the sight of God.) Man looks at the outside, God looks at the heart. Mankind starts out close to the equator and deep skin pigmentation and thick curly hair are needed to ensure the survival of mankind.
As always, Tiana was made the last Princess when she is suppose to be the first princess that ensures the survival of all mankind. Please do the research and reclaim your heritage that was stolen when our ancestors were taken against their will and enslaved. Please notice I said enslaved. They were not slaves. They were enslaved against their will.
In addition, the words black and white are used quite often in our society. I researched this and found out it is incorrect. These words create devaluation of God's creation and separate and divide. If you think about it, these words oppose one another. They are polar opposites and will always create separatism. I don't think either"" people group"" resembles the color black or white. These colors are in a crayola box and should have stayed there! Please research the word race and find out God did not create races. God created human kind only. It all began with Adam and eve. We (meaning all mankind) are the daughters of eve! Eve was the first woman on earth, the first wife, and the first mother. She is known as the ""Mother of All the Living.""
Lastly, the movie was long overdue and Tiana is the first princess and not the last. The bible clearly states that the First shall be last and the Last shall be first. This has clearly played out in America with Disney princess movies. Therefore, I must with great intrepidation (A feeling of complete daring and utter adventurousness) move Tiana to the top of the Disney Princess List:
Tiana, from The Princess and The Frog (2009)
Snow White, from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)
Cinderella, from Cinderella (1950)
Aurora, from Sleeping Beauty (1959)
Ariel, from The Little Mermaid (1989)
Belle, from Beauty and the Beast (1991)
Jasmine, from Aladdin (1992)
Pocahontas, from Pocahontas (1995)
Mulan, from Mulan (1998)
Rapunzel, from Tangled (2010)
Hats off to Anika Noni Rose who did a stellar job of portraying Tiana.
It would be remiss of me not to mention 'Sofia The First': Disney's First Latina Princess. Many were upset because she does not look Hispanic Enough. I am sorry that happened and many got to experience what my people have been experiencing in the U.S. for years. I viewed this princess and I agree, she does not look Hispanic at all. I must remind the Hispanic community that many things are hard fought to get. Hence, the civil rights movement, NAACP, and the segregation of Little Rock Central High School. It is interested to live in a society where people are trying to make everyone look just a like or similar. I do believe God got it right. There is no need for renovations.
Lastly, I am overjoyed that Tiana is deep brown sugar skin pigmentation. (I did not say dark skinned because this phase annoyed and lowered my self-esteem as a child. We need to burn it.) In a society that values the mundane, silly, irrelevant things such as a hue, It is refreshing to see the first African American princess have deep brown skin pigmentation rather than light brown.
There were some complaints about Tiana's prince being of another people group or not African American, but I personally loved this. It destroyed any hint of devaluation of Tiana and elevated her to a royal status of equality! She is good enough and she can marry anyone she falls in love with! The Prince saw Tiana's inner spirit and fell in love with her! Isn't that what love is all about? Blessings.",1355961600,,6013,4.584029712163417

4069385,2,B0034JKZ8G,"Warning: Rant and spoilers ahead.

Let me first say that this movie was a capital effort.  It's very obvious that they cared a lot about the characters and put effort into putting in lots of cute character moments.  However, it fell so far below the standard of what I've come to expect a Disney princess story to be.  I mean, dang, Sleeping Beauty almost bankrupted Disney when it came out, and yet it still turned out with fewer plot holes than this.

But first with the good.
- The animation was grand.  A lot of people here on Amazon complained about it, but quite frankly, it's honest to goodness hand drawn animation.  Absolutely nothing wrong with it at all.
- Dresses!  Not only does Tiana get more dresses than most other princesses, but her friend Charlotte has several as well.  And dresses are awesome.
- Fun side characters.  I simply adored Duke, the cook at the cafe, because he was just so hilarious.  Tiana's dad was cool, and Charlotte was just plain nuts.  Good times.
- Avoiding racial issues.  Honestly, a Disney movie really isn't the place for discussing that sort of thing, and it was handled properly without being offensive.  I've read other reviews where they claim it's somehow racist or racially demeaning, but this is simply untrue. The only people it stereotypes is hicks, and well, everybody in Hollywood does that.
- The concept.  Expanding on the fairy tale of old and setting it in New Orleans was a great idea.  Fault the movie all you like, but it had the potential to be good.

And that's the end of the good.  Honestly, so much of this movie just went so wrong. Princess movies have high standards of being fun, having good writing, and being child friendly.  This movie is none of those.  I was not nearly as entertained or wrapped up in the story as I would be for any other princess movie.  This happened for several reasons.

1. The music was not that great.  While I do love the scene where Tiana is singing to her mom about her restaurant and the animation changes, in the end none of the songs stuck with me.  They weren't catchy or emotional.  None of them had the fun of ""Under the Sea"" or the simple sweetness of ""Beauty and the Beast"".  The tunes didn't stick, and neither did the words.  Also, the song Tiana sung in the swamp with the croc and the prince was just unnecessary.  It added nothing to the story because we already know that Tiana wants a restaurant, Naveen is a playboy, and the croc wants to play jazz.  And did the croc seem like a rip-off of the crocodile in All Dogs Go to Heaven to you?

2. Voodoo is not appropriate for a children's movie.  The entire reason we buy princess movies for kids is so they can have something to watch that isn't full of all the grown-up junk modern movies like to stick in there just to be ""rebellious"".  Parents don't want their kids exposed to black magic, tarot cards, and other spiritual hazards.  Especially not if their children are spiritually sensitive or prone to nightmares.  That leaves this movie without a target audience, because while the rest of the movie is intended for children, no sensible parent will put on a movie with voodoo in it.

3. While the villain had a lot of potential, Shadowman was just wasted.  Besides being way too scary for the target audience, his motivation was unclear.  First of all, he has a clear character moment near the beginning where he sells a malfunctioning hair potion to a bald man just for the sake of money.  However, this is contradicted by his later admission to the spirits he works with that he wants to take over New Orleans.  So which is it?  Is he motivated by conquest or cash?

Also, if Tiana and other characters know better than to talk to Shadowman, then he obviously lived in New Orleans for a while.  If he really wanted to conquer the city, why did he wait until then to do it?  Why did his plan hinge on a foreign prince, the prince's doofus caretaker, the Mardi Gras parade, and a whole bunch of spells?  Couldn't he have come up with something more straightforward, especially since he was able to send the shadows after Naveen?  And if he's motivated by money, he could get it from Big Daddy a lot easier than by voodoo.  After all, he saw the big stack of cash Big Daddy gave the newspaper boy.  Surely he could put himself in a position to get a constant stream of cash from Big Daddy without having to stop BD from making more money.  That would be more practical.

What's more, they never explain why Shadowman is doomed if his necklace breaks.  It ends up just being a cheap way to get rid of the villain.  What they should have done is let him get away and then cause trouble in sequels.  Tsk Tsk, such a waste.

I could go on about Shadowman, but I'll finish with this: the movie is not him vs. Tiana.  In every other movie, the bad guy was a direct villain of the princess in question.  However, Shadowman mostly antagonizes Naveen (and that from a distance) and doesn't even know that Tiana is trying to stop him until the end of the movie.  Come on, the very point of a princess movie is to overcome something.  This movie really should have been Tiana's practical mind versus Shadowman's crazy head.  That's what this movie needed.

4. Despite the fact that Tiana gets so many dresses, she never wears any of them for very long.  In other stories, dresses had significant plot reasons for existing and were setpieces for the princess in question, ie Cinderella's ballgown, Aurora's birthday present, and Belle's dancing dress.  Instead, Tiana's best dress is only worn for about thirty seconds during the movie.  Come on, now.

5. So...yeah...anybody else notice that Naveen is not really good enough for Tiana?  She's worked really hard all her life, and Naveen is just some wasteful playboy whose only credit is that he can play a little guitar.  There was no real reason for them to fall in love, and the idea that after only a few days with a girl a playboy would decide to propose is laughable.

6. I personally found the firefly creepy.  The idea with him in love with a star should have been cute, but it just really creeped me out.  If he had to have been in the movie, then he should have been just some side character in the swamp that goes away after a while.  There's actually no reason for the firefly to be with Tiana and Naveen after all.  The croc wants to become a jazz musician, so he has an excuse, but why would a firefly go along for a spell breaking session?  His home is in the swamp, not the city.

7. Plothole city.  I have never seen a more plot-hole filled film in my entire life.  They spent so much time animating and coming up with all these characters, and they even went so far as to cast Oprah in this film, but they couldn't get the story together.  Let me think of all the plotholes I can mention off the top of my head.

- If Shadowman turned Naveen into a frog, why was Naveen's servant dumb enough to go along with Shadowman's plan?  How does he know Shadowman won't betray him?

- If Charlotte is such good friends with Tiana, then why wasn't she at all worried about her disappearance?  She surely would have noticed when she saw the mess the frogs left in her room.

- How come Tiana's mom didn't worry about her daughter's disappearance?  Or heck, why wasn't Duke worried?  Surely he'd notice if his hardest working waitress didn't come in.

- Why does Shadowman need to make Charlotte marry fake Naveen just so he can stab a Big Daddy doll with needles?  Can't he just do that anyway?

- Does Naveen really think Tiana is a princess in the beginning?  She was just another girl in a fancy dress at a fancy dress party.  Surely he realizes that America doesn't have official princesses.

- If the shadows can go after Naveen and be all scary-like, then why can't they take over the city by themselves?  They don't need Shadowman's help.  And if they do, then why do they kill him after one slip up?  Can't he just go to another city and try again?

But there is one plot-hole that eclipses all the rest.  It is the biggest plot-hole I've seen in a movie since Star Trek: Generations.  Namely, why is Tiana going about getting herself a restaurant the hard way?  She's even willing to kiss a frog for it, when it's already been established that she doesn't like frogs.  However, she has Charlotte.  Charlotte doesn't even care that Tiana is working all the time; she'll just rush right on in and tell Tiana all about the arriving prince.  She even stopped dancing with the guy she thought was her prince just to get Tiana a new dress.

So why doesn't Tiana just ask Charlotte for the money to make a restaurant?  I mean, if she's willing to kiss a frog, she won't be too prideful to ask her friend, right?  Or she could just skip Charlotte altogether and go right to Big Daddy with her business plan, convincing him to loan her the cash by saying that her restaurant will increase the property value of the other nearby plots?  Starting a business is about more than just raising a bunch of cash.  It's about who you know.  Heck, Big Daddy might even make money out of investing in Tiana's work so that he can pay for all that nonsense he buys for Charlotte.  Everybody wins.

Oh, and it was pretty uncouth of Tiana to threaten those real estate agents (I think that's what they were...) with a crocodile.  The entire point of free enterprise is to avoid being threatened into doing business deals by either the government, other businesses, and Disney princesses.  Sure the guys were jerks, but that's not appropriate.  You can threaten them, say, with Big Daddy's presense, but nobody should be afraid for their lives if they don't make a deal with you.

So yeah, this plothole really ruined the whole movie for me.  She didn't even need to kiss the frog in the first place.

8. It was pretty contradictory to have themes of working hard instead of depending on luck alongside themes of not letting work take over your life.  In an adult movie, these themes could possibly have worked out.  While I'm not a fan of dumbing things down for children, it's really best for child-like Disney movies to have more or less straightforward themes.  These just got confusing together.

So, there's my big ol' rant.  Two out of five stars.",1355097600,2,10256,4.472207231516459

Basically, your Disney villain this time around summons spirits using Voodoo. He happily walks around with Tarot cards and flashes the all-seeing-eye. To enhance my complaint"", I shall say that his voodoo friends come up from death and drag the villain to Hell, where  us Christians understand him to be. Now the latter scene mentioned here is done in a very dark way and is advertised as a children movie to lure in kids! Kids are watching this and learning.
If you let them watch something once, you are planting the seed of voodooism (a seed of evil) into their minds and into their thoughts.

4069403,4,B0034JKZ8G,"I could definitely tell Disney was actually TRYING in this movie. They knew people's interests in Disney would not be the same as it was back in the early 90's, but they used what people liked in ""Little Mermaid"", ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Aladdin"", and ""The Lion King"" for something new. I admit the story wasn't quite as easy to follow, but I figured it out and I had no problem with it. They were just trying something new. They tried to make new musical songs even though most were not as good as the other songs. The characters and theme are awesome, though. A hard-working young waitress who yearns to have their own restaurant, a lazy but fun-loving prince, a cajun firefly who is in love with a star, an evil voodoo magician, and my personal favorite, an alligator who plays a trumpet. The idea of the main characters ending up in the bayou  and need to get back to town is great! It reminds of me of some of the earlier enjoyable classics like ""The Aristocats"", ""101 Dalmatians"", and most likely, ""The Rescuers"". I do admit, the only thing I criticize about this movie is Dr. Facilier killing Ray. Ray is not my idea of a main character to die, unlike Kerchak from ""Tarzan"" All I can think to myself is, why couldn't Disney just have Ray just injured like Trusty from ""Lady and the Tramp"" or have him crippled like what the PS2 company did with Bentley in ""Sly 2: Band of Thieves""?! Oh well. Since Ray got to be with true love in the end, I guess Ray's death is kind of important in the story. But the good stuff in this movie is just too darn good.

However, why does she have to be a frog for half the film?  I think Disney would have been better off taking a Cajun culture fairytale and bringing it to life in a movie.  That way the New Orleans flavor could be still infused into the storyline. All of the other Disney princesses, except Mulan, were princesses in their own right and didn't have to kiss a frog to do so.

If you are a business owner, or struggling through thick and thin to create a successful business, than you will certainly get more out of this film, than perhaps others who aren't.

I also really enjoyed the fact that it took you all over New Orleans.  While understanding that it is reimagined for a particular time period, and then on top of that, created in the film's image, for someone who has never
been there, it was really beautiful to see it all.

As always, and being an artist myself, I totally appreciate the craft that goes into these things.  This film certainly exemplifies the part of Walt's dream of creating art out of animation.  Well done!

As well, the fact that it has a princess who is African American is truly precious, and a rallying cry for the entire race.  Themes form ""it's a small world"" come to mind!

There really wasn't any character that annoyed me, or any that I didn't like.  Mama Odie is the perfect grandmother.  Her boat in a tree, in the bayou is spot on.  The gumbo in the bath tub is hilarious.
Prince Naveen's arc is well done, and Tiana's driving of that arc is a fantastic touch.

The end always makes me cry.  To see that she gets her dream, is, well, pure Disney.

If ever you enjoyed any Disney film at all, I say go for it.  The musical numbers are show stopping, and this film certainly doesn't disappoint!

Now..... If Disneyland could ONLY have that Mardi Gras parade?!  And, somewhere in the world, we need a Tiana's Palace!  New Orleans would be perfect!

In the film, Tiana(Anika Noni Rose) is a young woman with a heart of gold, always aiming to live out her late father's dream to open a restaurant. With her mother(Oprah Winfrey)always giving out advice, Tiana never gave up that dream, One day, at the masquerade ball, Tiana, dressed up as a princess, meets a friendly talking frog, who happens to be a Prince named Naveen(Bruno Campos)whose has been cursed by a demented witch doctor named Facilier(Keith David). So in order to break the curse, Tiana must reluctantly kiss Naveen to revert him back to a prince, but she ended up become a frog herself! So Tiana and Naveen sets of of an adventure in the Bayous of Louisiana, meeting all sorts of interesting characters like Louis, the jazz trumpet-playing alligator and Mama Odie, a 197-year-old blind voodoo priestess and her guide snake Juju, and Ray(Jim Cummings), a wise-cracking firefly. They eventually meet up with Facilier and fight to restore their human forms.

I saw it on an ANALOG TV set, definitely NOT the right format for blu-ray. I was STILL extremely impressed with how gorgeous this movie is. I LOVED this movie, I really did. The character is independent, not dependent on some non-existent prince to come and save her, which is beyond stupid, and next to never happens anyhow. She thinks for herself. she knows what she wants. This movie is SO pretty, if you don't have the LED 1080 type TV, I'd say this movie alone would make it worth it. A Samsung 5000 series is very nice, and doesn't really need an expensive sound bar for most applications or most people, with a 32 inch size, and right around 400.00 isn't at all ""undoable."" With my new TV, I have more than enough sound, decent sound quality, and a really impressive picture. I only wish I'd bought a 55 inch screen, but not really practical for a movies-while-cooking kitchen TV set. It's so pretty, I want to just crawl inside it like that old Twlight Zone episode, ""the 16 millimeter shrine"" first season, where she wants to crawl into her old movies. If it were that pretty in 1959 it wouldn't have taken her a whole episode to do it.

Only a few films are this nice. Cars. nemo. Toy Story. Oh, the Pixar shorts are also gorgeous. LED and the new Blu-ray stuff REALLY makes you want a GINORMOUS TV set and just marvel over great movies like this one. Big enough to need a crane. Bigger than a video screen for Journey in 1980.

She's been working hard and saving money to buy a place for the restaurant when Prince Naveen comes to town. Of course, Charlotte's father invites him to stay with them, and Charlotte is determined to rope him into marrying her.

But there's trouble in the form of Dr. Facilier, a wicked Voodoo man, who turned the prince into a frog. Tiana is wearing a princess tiara Charlotte loaned to her with a gorgeous gown for the Mardi Gras ball. So the prince figures she is a princess, and talks her into kissing him. Unfortunately, he turns her into a frog instead.

How they turn back into humans is the rest of the story. It's got plenty of great music, lots of colorful magic effects, and amusing characters that reminded me a good bit of ""The Little Mermaid.""",1336694400,,1255,4.447826086956522

Seriously, this right up there with Pinocchio and the middle of Dumbo for awfulness for kids. Why Disney would EVER think it was ok to have demons, voodoo and essentially the devil all in the same movie is beyond me. That witch doctor was beyond creepy and if they wanted him to be the villain in the movie, they REALLY should have lightened up and not made him so scary, creepy and basically seeming as if he's coming from the depths of hell. And I am totally fine with characters like the ""under god"" in Hercules and all the other bad guys for the most part in Disney movies, but this went way too far. I think too many people are over looking some Disney movies as not being completely suitable for small children because it's made by Disney, so it MUST be fine.

4069445,5,B0034JKZ8G,"When I ordered this I expected that we would enjoy it but I never figured it would be this wonderful.

The cartooning is great fun, and there are salutes to some earlier films in the characterizations, as well as there being the signature Disney flying light (this time with fireflies).  The sinuous curves of the dancing minstrels within the detailed architectural background early on make it obvious that the film is going to be visual joy, and that promise is kept.

But what is best are the messages, both subtle and overt and the truly fun way they are imparted.  The movie allows the environment to often be much larger than the main characters like in real life, a feature too sadly often lacking in children's films.  Yet, at the same time it delivers the hope that kids need and desire, but by teaching how to make the real world work for them:  by knowing the difference between needs and desires, and being willing to work for dreams.

As the Stones sang, ""You can't always get what you want, but if you try sometime you just just might find, you get what you need.""  This film says much the same thing in a very different way and for a very different age bracket, and it does so beautifully.",1335052800,2,1203,4.486238532110092
4069446,5,B0034JKZ8G,"There was just so much hype about this movie when it came out--so many grown women crying and people talking about the black princess and complaining about her being a frog--I just had no desire to see this.  Despite the fact that I'm black.

But we saw a preview on our Snow White DVD and I was charmed. So we bought it. Boy was I surprised.

Now, all three of my kids (aged almost-5, and 2.25 years) love this movie. But they love anything that says Disney in the front. In fact, they really love the Disney logo itself, and that castle sequence at the beginning of every movie where Tinkerbell sprinkles fairy dust or whatever. This is their current favorite, though.

No, what surprised me was how much _I_ loved this movie. And not just because Tiana is the most beautiful Disney princess EVER. I loved that her family was poor but happy. I loved that her best friend was a rich, white girl who was NICE. I loved that self-absorbed (Charlotte and Naveen) did not mean evil.  I loved that none of the evils perpetrated in this movie were about LOOKS--in fact, they were all about money and power (pretty realistic). I love that Naveen and Tiana did not fall instantly in love. I love that Naveen, Tiana, and even Charlotte all grow. All of the secondary characters are interesting and fun, but I LOVED Raymond the firefly. He's your typical slapstick sidekick except that he's intelligent (also great, with the Cajun accent). I loved that there was no evil woman, and that the evil voodoo man wasn't an idiot. Of course, it was awesome that Tiana didn't care at all about being a princess, and that she works hard and has a reasonable talent. There were lots of other things to love, but I don't remember them all right now.  Oh yeah, I even loved that Naveen could play an instrument! And that the evil voodoo man was a real show-stealer, kind of like Ursula in _The_Little_Mermaid_. And I thought it was GREAT that race was a non-issue in the whole movie and that the couple at the end was interracial and unremarked (not at all realistic for the time period, but it's a morality tale for today's youth, not the 1920s).

A lot of people have complained about the music, which I don't really see. The songs grew on me, even though I don't like jazz or zydeco or gospel. My favorite piece was Facilier's ""Friends on the Other Side"" with that awesome line ""You got what you wanted/But you lost what you had!"" But all of the songs forward the story and are stylistically appropriate, and they certainly get us all singing along. Whether you like them is a case of personal taste, not of the writer's technical proficiency.

The only thing I didn't like about this movie, was a throw-away line by Tiana when Mama Odie asks her to taste the gumbo. She says it needs Tabasco. It feels so pat to me, like the only thing special about Cajun cooking is Tabasco. Couldn't it have needed more Okra, or something? It bugged me.  But it lasted all of 5 seconds.

I thought this movie was great and is a great movie for kids to see (with parental supervision in the younger ages, until they are used to the scary bits). Its values are modern and well-conceived, and the quality is on a par with any other Disney animated feature, in my opinion.  I hope you enjoy it as much as we do!",1334966400,,3274,4.449081803005009
4069447,3,B0034JKZ8G,"Disney movies have a long and well-understood history.  They began with serious, epic stories of fairy tales to enchant young children, degenerated to less-than-epic fare after a while, then came roaring back with awesome animation, mixed up with a little believable character-comedy in the Little Mermaid, and Beauty and the Beast.  After that, the intended secular message of certain films ruined them, and in others, the comedy kind of took center stage, and the quality of Disney films in general declined.  I was more than a bit skeptical of those who said I should give this film a chance, but I wasn't going to reject the possibility of another Disney revival, if they could pull it off.

I've heard people say this film was great, but complicated in its plotline.  I've heard people say it took its characters seriously once again, but had plenty of side-comedy as well.  I've heard people say the only thing they really disliked about it was all the magic thrown around by the bad guy.  Well, I -loved- Sleeping Beauty, and the bad guy in that movie threw a lot of magic around as well, so I was at least interested in what this film had to offer.

Now for the bad news.  For all that this movie sometimes attempts to be yet another masterpiece, and does make an effort to treat the central relationship seriously, it's also very much a product of its times.  By this time, 20th Century Fox and Dreamworks had saturated the movie market with unfunny, immature, toilet-minded films, laughably marketed as ""kids movies.""  You know the kind of rambling, aimless, hyperactive trash I'm talking about.

The Princess and the Frog had a lot of potential, and much of it was used.  Its main characters are actually interesting and believable people for the most part, and each changes for the better over the course of the film.  It could actually be a charming relationship, if you can ignore the fact that they're both frogs.  In addition, the main villain, while not as physically-threatening as someone like Maleficent, is still a serious and tangible threat to the main characters, and has big plans to do horrible things to them.  He's not a goof; he's a serious, believable villain, and to be honest, of everything in this movie, all the evil voodoo and demons he throws around are probably the things I take the least issue with.  Disney has rarely sugar-coated the reality of evil in their movies, and it's one thing I like most about the majority of their productions.

I also disagree with those who say the plot was too complex.  It did have a lot of weird twists, and you didn't know exactly what the plot was going to be from the start of the film, but that's good.  Kids will benefit if you ask them to think a little bit about what's being fed into their brains, and adults certainly won't be confused by it.  It made perfect sense to me.

However, I do have two problems with it, and they're big ones.  The side-characters, and the treatment of man-woman relations.

First, the second one.  The prince begins his journey as an impenitent philanderer, and never really seriously repents of this later on.  He learns to care about someone, and to work harder, but not to treat women in general with greater respect because they're people too.  That's a moral message that's missing from this movie, and it would really have benefitted from it.

However, I'm more concerned with the ""marriage,"" because last time I checked, blind voodoo ladies weren't priests.  They don't have the authority to wed two people in holy matrimony, and therefore, the ending really is something of a head-scratcher when you think about it.  The treatment of mere human institutions as though they can substitute for legitimate marraige is a pervasive sin in our current society, but endorsing that sin is by no means cool, especially when it's subtle and unobtrusive like this.

With regard to the side-characters, as I said, this film is very much a product of its times, and although many of them get serious moments, for the most part, they exist to be goofy and ridiculous, and to have no real relationships or motives beyond a single desire each, which, this being Disney, they'll need to have granted by the time the film ends.  Louis, Ray, the baiyou hunters, and especially Mama Odie are all goofiness-personified, and this just makes adults feel uncomfortable, because the characters seem to be having a good time, but are impossible to sympathise with.  It doesn't help that some of them (Ray, for example,) get a bit of toilet-humor added to the mix, which no mature adult can appreciate.

Now, when I say ""the side-characters,"" I don't mean -all- the side characters.  Charlotte is goofy too, but she actually demonstrates legitimate love and caring for the main character, and her father isn't the goofiness-engine that some of the others are.  He's a weak human being, but not in an over-the-top way.  In fact, I found him somewhat likable.  I don't remember any of the other characters really standing out in particular.

I guess I could say that what strength the film has comes from its relationship between the two main characters, but actually... there isn't much of anything there.  Oh, don't get me wrong, it's nice to see Disney taking a central relationship seriously again, and they do treat it with all the seriousness it deserves, but I never got the impression that the leads had much of anything in common; not even any real common interests.  They really don't have much reason to even like one another, and the scenes that they have together feel just a little forced as a result.

Lastly, I can't be the only one who felt that the near-complete excision of the human element hurt this film's central relationship a little.  All the really meaningful scenes happen while both are frogs, and really... that's a tough bar to get past.  Likewise, the swamp that most of their development occurs in feels more like a mood-vacuum to stick goofiness into, rather than any actual location with its own flavor or features of consequence.  Then, too, I don't really see why ""last two-hundred years New Orleans"" was judged to be a better location for this story than medieval Europe, where it traditionally took place.

I was expecting less from this movie, but hoping for more.  It hurt a little in certain points, but there's no real harm done, and despite the complaints that some others have had, I wouldn't worry about the evil magic and demons.  My main concern is with the treatment this film gives to romance, and the overall lack of strong character it contains.  For these reasons and others, I'll probably never bother watching it again.",1334966400,,6663,4.767218831734961

She an her family are willing to work hard  toward their life goals.  Most of all, her love for her ""frog prince"" makes her willing, if necessary, to remain and live her life as a frog rather than to lose him and the love they have together.

All I have to say is this movie, although it has some good messages, is overall DARK...VERY DARK for young ones to try to comprehend and not be completely scared of!  I understand that the movie is set in New Orleans and that is part of the ""culture/history"" there, but Disney did not have to highlight the voodoo to such an extreme as to make the movie totally scarey for children!

Now, even though I liked it, I still don't think it was up to the quality of previous Disney animated films. When I say that, don't think I'm referring to the quality of the animation, because the animation was excellent in this film; but I just didn't enjoy it as much and I didn't have that good ol' ""love it"" feeling afterward. But, I still liked the film a lot.
The villain in this one was certainly darker than any other Disney villain I've seen; not the coolest or most evil of the Disney villains, but certainly the darkest. They did a good job at adding to his creepiness with the way his shadow acted and certainly gave you that dark feeling when he did his voodoo stuff.
There were some really funny moments in the film and I think the voice acting and music were elemental in the success of this film. The lasting message of the film was inspiring and the movie was good fun for everyone. Thank you, Disney, for bringing the magic back from where it originally came from.

As far as questionable content:
Some of the scenes dealing in voodoo might be a bit scary for children. Just a head's up.

4069485,4,B0034JKZ8G,"This is one of the odder Disney animated features. Disney clearly wanted an African American princess, but couldn't find any appropriate stories in European fairy tale traditions. Thus, in The Princess and the Frog it combines Louisiana Cajun flair with the story of the princess and frog. I think the mix works fairly well, given the odd combination. It never feels too forced. Nonetheless, it does rely a lot upon racial and other stereotypes, probably more so than other Disney films. The villain is a creepy Voodoo worshipper whose philosophy seems eerily satanic for a kids movie. The alligator is voiced by an African American and is also really fat, which seems a bit too coincidental. Moreover, none of the songs are really memorable, except perhaps for the villain's ""Are you ready"" piece. Still, as a kids movie it's not half bad. It won't be a Disney classic, but is certainly entertaining.",1313712000,,901,4.934210526315789

Characters weren't memorable or even well-developed - Tiana is a FROG for 80% of the movie, for crying out loud! Plot is too complicated, humor is forced and slightly awkward. Disney movies (good ones anyway) always have certain sparkle that makes them enjoyable for people of all ages. This movie DID NOT have it. It pales in comparison to Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast, Pocahontas, Aladdin, everything. I had hoped for the Princess and the Frog to at least match the classics in terms of music and storyline. Sorry Disney, it didn't work for me.

Here's where I think it went wrong. 1)The producers tried way too hard to cater to the black community. Anticipating the premiere, I read all the articles about how Disney revised and revised Tiana's name, appearance, and occupation. Relax! The story matters way more than the texture of Tiana's hair! I'm black and that doesn't even concern me. 2)Poor choice of fairy tale. The princess and the frog is literally a two-sentence long story! The producers were forced to add that dumb twist about the spell not working - sorry excuse for a storyline! 3)Way too much time spent on scenery and special effects, not enough on music and plot. Right now I can't even remember what the story is even about, let alone recall one song.

It's not like Disney lost its magic touch. Mulan and Aladdin are fairly recent films, and I love both. Tangled, made in 2010, is a beautiful, hilarious film that actually deserves to be mentioned along with the other classics. It was even made Pixar-style. Yes, Disney still has the potential to create modern classics. It's just that when race gets tangled into the mix (we all know Walt Disney was an unashamed racist) everyone gets uncomfortable. Truthfully, I'd trade a black princess for worthwhile entertainment.",1313452800,14,1873,4.85

The Art is half-assed and Sloppy. The Character design is not even creative the princess looks like Belle from Beauty and the Beast, and the rest of the characters were drawn by an artist who had a hangover.

For the people who didn't like this film, or make an issue about this movie not being family oriented, what the heck?  Cruella Deville - hideous to look at; AND even worse, she wanted to make coats out of those cute little dalmatian puppies.

The dark, beautiful, evil and ULTRA vain woman in Sleeping Beauty scared me to death as a child.  That woman wasn't messing around.  The fact that she turned into this deceptively 'sweet' old woman was even scarier because, who would be afraid of a sweet old woman?

I'm kind of hoping these negative reviews about this movie isn't what I think it is.  I've already read one ignorant post mentioning color, even going so far to mention the scatter brained white people in the movie.

But there is one thing that prevents it from joining the ranks of ""The Little Mermaid,"" ""Beauty And The Beast,"" ""Aladdin,"" ""The Lion King,"" ""Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs,"" etc. as a classic: the voodoo.

The plot, the music, it's still Disney grandeur. The latest one I watched was Tangled. It's not as good as the big timers, but I could still see charm in it.

Not The Princess and the Frog. This one has finally hit bottom. There is not a piece of magic in there. The plot is totally predictable and yet lacking sense. The music is uninspiring. The only thing cute in there is the girl frog. The prince frog is ugly. Their romance is totally unconvincing. The dark side is incomprehensible. Some people claim that it's scary; I think it's just absurd. Everything moves too fast, with too much ""flash the audience with nonstop action so that they don't realize what a crummy piece of junk this really is."" The movie has no point: is the girl doing the right thing working so hard, or is she supposed to lighten up? It is not clearly convey, like nobody really knows where this is all going, but somehow we got to the end and let's make it stop right there. Supposedly, this cartoon is made by the same guy who made Aladdin. Well, I guess Phantom Menace is also made by the same guy who came up with Star Wars. Can't expect them to keep coming up with miracles.

I thought the head of Pixar is heading Disney's cartoon division after Pixar got bought. So why doesn't he teach them how to make up a good story, like Up? Finding Nemo? But perhaps he's too busy doing Pixar stuff to give a rip about the old fashioned cartoons. Even then, Disney needs a good plot! Don't just crank something out because summer is near. Make it good!

The Princess and the Frog - Pleasure Book

Amazing, creative, and historical. All these words can explain the Disney movie called The Princess and the Frog. This movie was made in 2009 and received a 7.3 out of 10 rating. It was inspired by E.D. Baker's novel, ""The Frog Prince"".
The main characters in this movie where Tiana, Prince Naveen, Dr. Facilier, Louis, Charlotte Labouff, Big Daddy Labouff, and James. This movie took place in New Orleans.
In the beginning, a young girl named Tiana lives in a small house with her mom and dad. Her dads dream was always to have his own restaurant. He passed away before his dream came true, she finally gets enough money but someone else brought the place for more money. In the end gets kissed by a royal frog and eventually ends up liking him and they get married and live happy ever after.
This is a modern day retelling of the classic story of the Frog prince. A young girl named Tiara was a strong woman who never gave up on what she believed in. His goal always was to own the restaurant her dad never had because he passed away. Her mom, Endora, always supported her in anything Tiara wanted to do. She had a good friend named Charlotte Labouff who helped her get her ""dream place"". Once Tiara had enough money to buy the place, the owners told her she couldn't buy it because someone offered a higher price. She was depressed but the next day she went to her friend's party. Charlotte is rich and her dad has a lot of money, she gets whatever she wants, and the prince, named Naveen is at her party. She is supposed to get married with the prince until a certain person gets in the way of all that. The prince makes a bad decision and ends up turning into a frog, while Lawrence looks exactly like him. The only way for him to turn back to himself is to kiss a princess. He mistakenly kisses Tiara, thinking that she is a princess, and she turns into a frog as well. Now with the help of a alligator named Louis, a firefly, and an old lady named mama Odie, they dug a little deeper into the heart and realized that they loved eachother. The two frogs end up getting married and both turning human again and living happily ever after.
My opinion on the movie is that it is truly one of a kind. It was unique as well as entertaining. This great movie always kept you thinking what was going to happen next. I recommend this movie to children 15 and below, it reminds me of something I would watch when I was younger. I also recommend this movie to people who enjoy fantasy and happy endings.",1308441600,,2581,4.354771784232365

Having the story set in New Orleans should have been interesting (especially the music, one would think) but instead it was just plain terrible. It would be difficult to identify what the worst part of the movie was: the satanic themes, the scary shadows and death scene (not fit for young children!), the painfully slow plot development, the obnoxious poorly written songs, the incredibly boring dialogue, the stereotypical characters (which I'd imagine could be offensive to some), the lame prince, or just the overall bad experience. Will definitely never see it again or recommend it to anyone. The highlight of the movie was when the firefly shot out of a person's nose. Seriously.",1302566400,14,849,4.862068965517241

I bought this movie thinking that disney movies are generally safe and innocent enough.  They usually have one evil character that can be scary and that is fine.  What separated this movie from others though was the repeated dark themes throughout.  I didn't like the voodoo magic things, the tarot cards, or the spirits.  So, call me over reactive but this movie would have been much better if they left all that junk out and just made it about the princess and the frog.",1302220800,16,583,4.5673076923076925
4069507,5,B0034JKZ8G,"I do have qualms with the storyline of this film. Tiana was already a hard-working, well-rounded character with her head in the right place and a focus perfectly acceptable for her time and even moreso in our time. Yet she, according to her friends, her mother, and the wise ol' witch in the Bayou, had to stop reaching for her dream just to dally in the matters of love?? There's plenty of time for that afterward, not before, and anyone with an ounce of sense on the subject will know that when it comes to a career, love simply has to fall on the back-burner, at least for a little while. And of all the people for such a strong, driven woman fall in love with, why did it have to be such a selfish, pennyless, egotistical character like Naveen? He has nothing to offer her, lied to her, could not even protect her, and enjoys flirting with other women. Of course he'd fall in love with HER, she has everything to offer him. But her, for him? Doesn't make sense, Disney. Just doesn't make sense...

In lieu of that, this movie is excellent. I am a big fan of 2D animation, and The Princess and the Frog was a welcome sight after years of stagnancy in the pool of this apparently long-lost art. The animation itself is spot on, and I am a big fan of frogs myself. The musical numbers in this movie were also quite excellent, and I was delighted during the Friends on the Other Side scene with all the brilliant voodoo color and feel. Also, the Evangeline song scene was beautiful and enchanting, and held up splendidly to all the other classic Disney love scenes.

Definitely worth the watch, worth the buy, and worth promoting!",1301529600,,1630,4.43
4069508,4,B0034JKZ8G,"The music and animation are lovely.  Most characters are well voiced and well developed.  Tiana is endearing, Prince Naveen is (in his non-frog form) quite attractive.
I won't be buying this one for my 6 year old princess loving niece (yet) because the villains and voodoo are a little too dark for her to handle.  Many six year olds would do fine, but she barely makes it through the Little Mermaid and Ursula and I don't know that she can can handle the ""friends from the other side.""  Just be prepared if your child scares easily.
I wish that the first African-American princess had had a little more human air-time.  I wish the beginning scene wasn't one that showed the African-American family working for a white family.  The scenes of Tiana watching the houses fade from Lottie's fancy neighborhood to her own humble one was sad to watch.  Even more sad was the scene watching Tiana and her mom move to the back of the trolley....  I wish Disney had suspended a little reality there....  Or set it in another time.
However, I did love that it was an American tale, and I am pleased that we finally have the first African-American princess; I cannot wait for another.",1300665600,,1173,4.600961538461538

Even as an adult, I've always loved Disney - Lion King, Aladdin, Hunchback, Mulan, Beauty and the Beast, to name but a few - and I was so excited when I heard that Disney were releasing a new movie.  I didn't get chance to see this at the theaters, so I pre-ordered this as soon as the blu-ray was announced, and couldn't wait to sit down with my husband to watch it.

I really don't understand why the movie has such high praise.  Based on the reviews given on Amazon, I was extra excited to see this movie, expecting something enjoyable even if not quite a classic.  Perhaps the movie is better suited to children (though I really doubt I would have enjoyed this any more as a kid) but I certainly could not find a single thing to like about this movie.

The storyline was promising-I thought that the slightly original twist on the classic ""Princess and the Frog"" story would be a guaranteed hit, but it was so poorly executed that it all fell flat.  The characters were forgettable, and for the most part, I didn't like them (except for the crocodile, who had some funny moments at times).

The artwork didn't really appeal to me-I found it a bit drab and boring.  The music was forgettable and the songs----awful!  A lot of them didn't seem to add much to anything at all, there were far, far too many of them, and not one of them was memorable.  I cannot even hum a single line of tune or remember any of the words at all.  The songs of this movie are nothing like the classic tunes of Aladdin, Lion King, etc.

One thing that really hindered this movie was that there were far too many characters.  I felt as though Disney threw in as many characters as possible just to make up for the poor script, weak songs and boring story.  A lot of the characters felt pointless, and the whole movie felt crowded.  Because there was so many of them, I didn't care for what was happening to any of them.  A certain scene at the end, which I believe was meant to be effective and moving, just left me thinking ""oh well.""

This movie was difficult to get through.  It had promise at the start, but quickly failed to deliver.  I felt as though it were the longest 90-something minutes I've spent all year.  In fact, it felt more like 900 minutes.  My husband and I cheered when the credits finally came around, and not because the movie was any good at all.

I was initially excited as I thought it meant the return of good Disney movies (before Pixar joined) like Lion King, Little Mermaid, Pocahontas, etc. There was so much hype. After watching all the previews there I knew the film sucked.

I saw the film twice. Second time was just because I kept falling asleep while watching it, due to how dull it was, the first time. I thought it might have been just me at the time so I gave it another go. Wish I hadn't.

The characters are really hard to fall in love with. I was annoyed by how one dimensional they were. The film is predictable, The singing was nothing special-- and in fact, I often wonder what happened to the gorgeous singing/orchestra they used to have for the early 90's films. I don't see how kids would enjoy this. There's nothing flashy in there and in this day and age, you really need that. Don't waste your money.",1296518400,14,933,4.35632183908046

There are parts that have scary shadow figures coming to get one of the main characters and that can be frightening. Thankfully I watched it before my kids and knew that would cause nightmares. I would suggest either fast forwarding through these parts, or explaining them to your children BEFORE you watch the movie.

4069525,5,B0034JKZ8G,"I couldn't wait for this movie to come out.  I love the wonderful new graphics that Disney has been using in their newer films, but the classic and age old charm of The Princess and the Frog captured my heart.  This is the film that makes one remember the beauty of Disney's artwork, and the hand-drawn animation wows the eye.

The movie is gorgeous, filled with enchanting characters and believable villians.  The romance is there, as charming and romantic as the Disney films of the past.  The lovely Tiana and the egotistical Prince Naveen light up the screen from the moment of their first encounter, charming the viewer with their dialogue and antics.  The moral, as is evident in all Disney films, is so blatantly apparent---dream as much as you wish but, if you don't work at it, it ain't going to happen.

The Princess and the Frog is a stunning bit of classic Disney that appeals to young and old alike---and the musical score is one that will leave you humming the words to  Evangeline for long afterward.

In return for the power he promises to deliver lost souls to the ones he calls his 'friends on the other side'.

This movie was really cool, and I loved the music. I'd heard complaints that Prince Naveen was a typical white prince, and that now different racial little boys had to wait even longer for their role model. By the commercials I was skeptical of this 'outrage', and after seeing the movie I just shook my head at those people's stupidity. Naveen is in no way 'white', and when watching the previews I'd thought him as Middle Eastern. But besides this point I didn't agree with, I really, really enjoyed the movie.

4069533,5,B0034JKZ8G,"This has been quoted as ""the best Disney film since The Lion King"", and by God, it's really true. Putting the Disney/Pixar films aside for a minute (we all know they're the future of Disney and cartoons in general), let's step back into the realm of 2D animation. The Disney of the 90's left us with some truly terrific animated films including The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King, and after that they left us with some not-so-great ones. In fact, since Toy Story was released in '95, I don't think there's been a single traditionally drawn cartoon produced and released theatrically worthy of greatness at all. Even The Simpsons Movie, which had seemed destined for greatness since its conception, fell flat on its face in the wake of the CGI revolution. It was as if all the good stories were being put on hold specifically for computer-generated cartoons.

Now I must admit, there probably weren't many people less interested in The Princess and the Frog when it first started being advertised than me. Not only was I well past the age of seeing a Disney movie without the name ""Toy Story"", but the concept itself brought nothing but skepticism to my mind. ""They've changed the original story's name?! And they made the princess black?! And they're doing it in 2D??!!"" were the first thoughts to enter my head, and they stayed there until I actually watched the movie from beginning to end. Boy, was I wrong to be skeptical. This is a true Disney Classic.

The story really isn't all that groundbreaking. Everyone is at least somewhat familiar with the prince-turned-frog who needs the kiss of a princess to be human again. It's the same basic thing here; but it is the characters themselves that truly make this a masterpiece. All of the voice acting is superb, the humor is just right, and the romance is heart-stealing. In my opinion, the pedestal is overtaken a little bit by the supporting characters. Louis, the trumpet-toting crocodile; Mama Odie, the new take on the fairy godmother; and of course Ray, the Cajun firefly madly in love with ""Evangeline"" (who just so happens to be the wishing star from Pinnochio) are some of the best original characters Disney has yet to come up with, right up there with Lumier and Cogsworth. And if you harbor any sentimentality for love stories, prepare to have your heart broken and re-warmed several times.

If you were ever a fan of the old Disney movies, do yourself a favor and see this one. There are plenty of skepticisms about the Voodoo themes and the Louisiana Bayou setting, but they're entirely in vain. The magic in this movie is no more offensive than Ursula's magic in The Little Mermaid, or the Fairy Godmother's magic in Pinnochio. And if you have any reserves about the racial implications of the movie, get over it. This truly amazing work of art deserves at least that much.",1292976000,2,2875,4.734530938123752
4069534,5,B0034JKZ8G,"THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG is a very loose adaptation of the classic fairy tale, THE FROG PRINCE.  Disney took the story of the prince who has been turned into a frog and can only be saved by a kiss, and launched a story all its own.  The story itself is pleasant enough, but frankly, it is nothing special.  What IS special about this film is Disney's return to a 2D, hand drawn animation style and the wonderful idea to set this film in bayou country in Louisiana.

First, the story.  In this film, a plucky but poor young lady named Tiana desires nothing more than to open a restaurant and prepare the food she and her dear departed father used to enjoy making for their friends and neighbors.  She has remained friends with spoiled but kind-hearted rich girl...and this puts her into contact with Prince Naveen, who is visiting New Orleans in search of a rich girl to marry (because his parents have cut him off from their money).  Unfortunately, by the time Tiana meets him, he's already been turned into a frog by the local voodoo specialist, Dr. Facilier.  He convinces Tiana to kiss him...but rather than break the spell, Tiana is ALSO turned into a frog.  This launches the two into an unlikely but fun adventure in the swamps, where they meet a friendly gator and a very amusing (and very Cajun) firefly.  Leave it to Disney to come up with great sidekicks.  And the idea of the fireflies is not only creative, but leads to some absolutely gorgeous scenes.

And those gorgeous scenes are rendered ""old school"".  I'm sure some of this was aided by computer...but the look is hand-drawn, just like the days of SNOW WHITE or SLEEPING BEAUTY.  While I heartily enjoy the Pixar films and many other 3D-esque animated features...PRINCESS AND THE FROG reminded me that these 2D images can feel like masterpieces of art come to life.  The lush and colorful backgrounds somehow feel more ""real"" than the sometimes photorealistic backgrounds of a film like TOY STORY.  I frequently found myself simply marveling at the gorgeous, watercolor backgrounds or the sumptuous, evocative color choices.  The whole film feels like a Mardi Gras.

The story certainly could have been told in other settings...but putting it in New Orleans at what feels like the time between the two World Wars was genius.  We see the stark contrasts between rich and poor.  Between black & white.  Yet New Orleans has a sparkle and energy that is unique...and that comes to vivid life too.  It's a melting pot like no other...and the film captures that mood and ambiance.  And this setting inspired Randy Newman to write some of his most un-Randy Newman-like music...and it works great.  I FREQUENTLY found myself tapping my toes to the beat.  The songs are simply terrific.  None really became breakout hits...but they all wonderfully accent the film.

The voice work is generally top notch.  A few famous folks drop by, such as Oprah Winfrey and the unmistakable John Goodman (both in small roles).  But led by relative unknown Anika Noni Rose as Tiana...we spend very little time ""recognizing"" famous voices, and most of the time appreciating the uniformly excellent acting and singing.

The film was a modest hit in theaters.  It just didn't generate huge excitement.  Heck, it took me over a year to see it.  But truly it is a throwback to Disney's glory days, and while it doesn't quite achieve the heights of PINOCCHIO or CINDERELLA...it is a very, very worthy entry into that pantheon.  While it's great for adults, please try to see it with a child.  They'll thank you.",1292889600,5,3550,4.745098039215686
4069535,5,B0034JKZ8G,"I didn't have high hopes for this movie before it came out, thinking Disney had little originality or beauty left to share, but I was quite mistaken. This movie was enchanting in every way from start to finish. It is without a doubt top shelf material (surprisingly, Tangled was also a great movie).

People complain alot about the voodoo in Princess and the Frog. I don't quite get the problem. Most Disney villans use black magic of some sort so why should this one be a problem when all the others aren't? And even the films with villians who don't use magic... why should any sort of abuse be ok, whether it's based in magic or not? In real life it's not ok, but in a movie it's the foundation for the bad guys so it gives the movie plot, drama and something to grow from.

Too scary for kids? Some youger kids will be scared, but some won't. We took our daughter to see the movie in theaters for her 3rd birthday. She didn't have a problem with it and was enthralled throughout the movie. You should know if your child gets scared easily or not. And even if they are too young now, they will grow up.

This movie was fantastic. I like to think that our culture is progressive and mature, but I'm dissappointed to see how scared many of us actually are. In my opinion, this film is not to be missed. It's one of Disney's best!!",1292803200,2,1331,4.294820717131474

4069538,4,B0034JKZ8G,"I heard mixed reviews on this movie from family and friends, seems they either love it or hated it.  So I got it for my girls, 5 & 2.  It kind of reminded us alot of Aladdin; with the bad man and some dark scary parts, I could live without the voodoo scenes; but I guess how else could they have turned the Prince into a Frog without it??  I did have to answer a lot of questions from my oldest about what is voodoo, coming up with creative ways to answer that as to not scare or confuse her more.
Overall, they both really enjoyed the movie, the songs were really cute.  There is one song in particular that when we watch the movie, they beg me to go back and play it over and over (Going down the Bayou sung by Ray Ray)  Speaking of loveable Ray Ray the firefly...he does get squashed in the end and dies, and my 5 year old did cry the first time, it was sad, but it did have a purpose when he turns into a ""star"" and ends up next to his true love in the sky.

I really ended up liking this movie and seem to like it more each time I watch it.  I like the message in it; work hard, have big dreams, and don't give up or take the easy way out.

4069540,4,B0034JKZ8G,"I loved it. I thought the music was wonderful, the characters were wonderfully illustrated and voiced, the film moved at a good pace. It was great ensemble cast. Even though the story was focused on Tiana, the film really did a good job of engaging and making me care about the supporting characters.

But let's get to the controversies:

1. Black prince: At first, I was a bit put off by the fact that Tiana didn't marry a black prince, but I quickly got over it. It would have been nice, but it took decades to get a Black Disney princess so I couldn't complain too much.

2. Is it too dark for children/voodoo: I guess I look at it this way, Disney has always had questionable content in their films. As a child I never noticed it, but as an adult I see it more. For example: as a child Ursula was just an octopus, but as an adult I took more notice of the fact that she was an evil witch. Disney has always had witchcraft in their films, so if you don't want your kids seeing the Princess & the Frog because of voodoo references, then you probably should take issue with Sleeping Beauty, Snow White & the Seven Dwarves, The Little Mermaid, The Sword & the Stone, etc because it all deals heavily with witchcraft.

Bottom line: I loved it. And I think that it is a child-friendly movie. But at the end of the day, parents need to know what their child can & cannot handle. In the end, parents need to decide what is acceptable and unacceptable for their child. But I feel like the movie was fine.

This movie is based off a specific time period in which blacks and whites were segregrated. I'm not saying I agree with what was going on in that time period but it is the reality of our history. Coming from the south and having been to New Orleans they do have accents and specific foods and music to the region. I think its almost comical to the people who refuse to watch this movie do to the voodoo aspect and yet Snow White was poisoned by the Queen who was a witch,Mufasas brother threw him off a cliff,Cruella wanted to skin a bunch of puppies and wear them for a coat,Disnay has always had some scary elements in their movies.

Some people were upset at the voodoo  that Dr. Facilier uses, but it's honestly along the same vein that Jafar and Ursula used against the protagonists from their respective movies. It's really no difference. If anyone did their homework, Louisiana has a deep history of voodoo because of the multi-cultural background it has.

I would definitely have loved to see more back story about Facilier and how he came to know his 'Friends' in the first place. I felt that area was lacking and even rushed.

4069558,3,B0034JKZ8G,"I'm very lucky to have been the perfect age to experience, firsthand, Disney's early 90's Renaissance. I remember finding out about Aladdin for the first time in the previews of the VHS copy of Beauty and the Beast. I remember hearing the song ""Circle of Life"" for the first time in the groundbreaking (at the time) trailer for ""The Lion King,"" before anyone had ever seen a mandrill holding a lion cub on top of a rock over kneeling animals. I actually remember wondering what Sebastian was saying when he sang ""Unda-da-sea,"" and whether King Triton was a good guy or a bad guy. These movies shaped the consciousness of my generation. Just go up to anyone between the ages of 22 and 28 who grew up in the Western World, any frat boy, any prissy girl, any former cheerleader, any computer nerd, and find me one who doesn't know the lyrics to Hakuna Matata. From 1989 to 1995, the question of next year's Disney movie was an exciting topic for everyone I knew. What would the next one be about? And, more importantly, would it be as good, both in my eyes and at the box office, as the one before? And (allowing for the less well-known Rescuers Down Under in 1990) the answer was always ""yes,"" until 1995 when suddenly Pocahontas hit the screens, leaving everyone to think, for the first time, ""Meh.""

Starting with Pocahontas, with the exception of Mulan, the films showed a slow and steady decline, trying too hard to be zany (Hercules), dark (The Hunchback of Notre-Dame, possibly the worst subject choice ever for a Disney movie), action-packed (Tarzan), expensive (Dinosaur), or offbeat (Lilo and Stitch)... In short, trying too hard to be anything but the instant classics of the early 90's. Things went from bad to worse (in a curiously correlated decline of quality and box office performance), until finally, following the fiasco of ""Home on the Range"" (am I the only one who saw it?), Disney announced it would no longer make traditional animated films, in a move that, to me, still sounds like Ferrari announcing it's going to keep making everything except cars. Yes, there were still Pixar movies, but for all their wit and beauty, these always felt like high-tech consolation prizes for anyone who grew up with magic carpets and singing candelabras. With the end of 2-D animation came the end of a collective, global childhood, and for a few years it looked as if, much like the real one, the Disney childhood was gone for good.

Until John Lasseter, the brilliant visionary behind Pixar, announced a new dawn of hope for Disney animation. The first project for the newly revived traditional feature animation department would be a real fairy tale, hand-drawn for the screen, with an old-school villain, a love interest, a fairy-godmother figure, talking animals, and, yes, even song-and-dance numbers in which the characters suddenly break into music. In short: a real Disney movie. And the result, ladies and gentlemen, titled ""The Princess and the Frog,"" just came out in theaters yesterday, following a two-week limited release in NY and LA. Of course, as anyone who's read this post so far must have already guessed, I wasted no time in seeing it the day it came to my city.

And here's what I thought:

""The Princess and the Frog"" is good. Yes, it's actually good, and anyone who's prayed for the return of traditional hand-drawn animation should see it without fear of disappointment. The movie looks beautiful, without even a hint of CGI (though I'm sure there must be some lurking here and there below the surface). The characters and backgrounds exist, seamlessly and breathlessly, in the wonderfully lawless physical universe where Ariel sang under water of her longing for the human world, where Mrs. Potts managed to look plump and made of porcelain at the same time. The movie is a visual journey through the glorious folklore of New Orleans, making ample use of the mythological arsenal at its disposal, from the dangers of the bayou to the double-edged dealings of voodoo, from Mardi Gras to gumbo. All the best Disney movies create self-contained universes where you simply want to immerse yourself, and ""The Princess and the Frog"" achieves this with class and charm. The stylized characters who walk down the street and into the restaurant where the heroine works wouldn't belong in any other movie, not even Aladdin or The Little Mermaid, and yet they're unmistakably Disney.

The entire feel of the movie is as bouncy and buoyant as its visuals, thanks in great part to its hardworking and determined heroine, Tiana. Much has already been said about her historical role as Disney's first African-American leading woman, but few reviewers seem to mention another very important aspect of the character: she's an exceptionally admirable protagonist. Regardless of race, color, or background, few Disney leads of either gender show as much pluck, energy, and perseverance as Tiana. As the movie points out, she's been so busy working all her life that she can't even dance! Why does no one consider that to be innovative for a Disney princess? Yes, Tiana's black, but that's just one of several reasons for which she's such a great addition to the canon. The characters around her are all serviceable, at the very least, but the movie's most memorable character is undoubtedly Tiana.

Now, I've mentioned my two favorite aspects of the movie, but I chose my words carefully when saying ""The Princess and the Frog"" is good. Sadly, it's not great. It's obviously head and shoulders above any hand-drawn feature the studio has released in the past 10 years, but it's little more than halfway to the brilliance of the early 90's pictures. One very noticeable difference lies in the music. The movie has numerous songs, and they all contribute to its overall stylistic cohesion, but they sadly justified my misgivings when I first heard they would be written by Randy Newman (of the ""Toy Story"" soundtrack) instead of Alan Menken (of everyone's favorite songs ever). What can you tell me about the song ""You've Got a Friend in Me"" from Toy Story? How does it compare, say, with ""Part of that World,"" ""Kiss the Girl,"" ""Prince Ali,"" or ""A Whole New World?"" Fatally, the show-stopping production numbers in ""The Princess and the Frog"" invite comparisons the music just can't live up to. This isn't a statement about the quality of the composer's work, but there's something distinctly lyrical, memorable, and infectious about other Disney soundtracks that just doesn't happen in this movie.

There are also some weaknesses in the story and character department. Most of the great Disney stories can be summarized in a very short sentence that every character's motivations can be deployed around. Though it's very clear what Tiana's conflict is (she wants to open a restaurant but doesn't have enough money), the balance of the plot is surprisingly complicated. Even the bad guy, Doctor Facilier, who's been given all the trappings of a great Disney villain (and score: even a song!), has too many agendas, too many tricks, and too many issues of his own, to seep under the viewers' skin. The love interest raises more questions than he answers (Where's he from? Why, if he's a Prince, does he have no money? Whom does he want to marry? Why?). For all the crap good old Prince Charming in Snow White received for having no personality, at least everyone knew exactly what he was about. The movie's comic relief is, though it pains me to say so, unfunny and forgettable, and it's instantly obvious why these characters are there. The genie, for example, had soul beneath all the jokes, and, from a purely pragmatic point of view, there'd be no Aladdin story without him.

Characters' motivations are not the only issue in the story department. The plot involves many deals, many conditions, many detours, many distractions. For example, before anything has even happened to her, Tiana finds that she can afford the down payment on the building she wants for her restaurant by selling cakes to her friend Charlotte, who wants the cakes in order to win the Prince's affections - but then Tiana is outbid and she must match the other prospective buyer's offer before it's too late. What happened to straight up ""Belle needs to break the spell!"" or ""Simba needs to reclaim the kingdom?"" There are so many technicalities in this movie that I'm still not sure what exactly sealed the characters' fates at the end (for both the good guys and the villain). And the vast majority of the plot seems to rest on the shoulders of Charlotte, the ditzy rich childhood friend, who's unwittingly at the center of several convoluted schemes simply because her dad has a lot of money. Again, the simple universality of Ariel's dream, or Cinderella's, for that matter, is far more engaging, not to say intelligible (especially for children, while we're at it).

Nonetheless, the Princess and the Frog is pure, well-intentioned, and fun. It's not grand, it's not spectacular, it's not haunting, and it's trying to resume the legacy of movies that were all of these things. But in spite of its shortcomings, its release is still the best news that's come out of Disney in a long time.",1287187200,61,9181,4.8688419705694175
4069559,5,B0034JKZ8G,"HELL YEAHZZ!!!! This movie was way better than I expected! I'm gonna confess now. I was never a fan of Disney Princess movies. Snow White bored me, the best part of Little Mermaid was Ursala, Beauty and the Beast was good, and Cinderela was tolerable. Princess and the Frog on the other hand not only entertained me all the way through, but wasn't as cliche as most princess movies. For one this is the first Princess movie to have a sista as the main character. Usually its either a white girl or minority girl who falls in love with a white guy (Pocohantas, Notre Dome, ect.). It takes place in 20th century New Orleans and not during the 1800's or farther like most of the Princess movies.

 On top of that I just really love the characters and setting. My mom watched this before me and actually cried on that part near the end involving the firefly, which I'm not gonna explain because I don't want to give spoilers. I love how it captures the feel of New Orleans. The colors and animation were just gorgeous. It shows how long its been since I've seen a hand drawn animated movie. A really huge breathe of fresh air from these CGI animated movies Disney and other companies concentrate on. Don't get me wrong I love many CGI movies, but in a way its taking away from the magic, art, and charm hand drawn animated movies provide. ITs becoming kind of dull too. Just look back on the diversity in artstyle in movies like Watership down, old Don Bluth films, and Miyozaki movies(I could go on) and compare them to the diversity in todays CGI movies. Heck look at some anime too. If you look at CGI movies some of them replicate each other expecially in how the humans look. I think its because some of them try to look too realistic, but thats just an assumption.

 I assume PATF takes place between the 1920-1940's. According to Spill.com the movie even starts out with an old Orleans song and alot of songs in the movie are done in a New Orleans style. As you who already saw the movie all ready know the best song is definately the Shadowman song. ARE YA READY!!! ARE YA READY!! Man I might need to MP3 that. Its definately one of the best villians songs ever. Plus voodoo scares me anyway, so thats a plus.

 Princess and the Frog is an extremely good movie. ITs nice to see Disney get back to its roots and actually make a cartoon. Its kind of a let down that the first in so long is a Princess movie, but its still a great change. Hopefully other companies will start doing handdrawn animation too.

""The Princess and the Frog"" has almost as much fun lampooning the conventions of the someday-my-prince-will-come genre as it does endorsing them.  It inverts the formula right off the bat by having its heroine turn INTO a frog when she kisses one rather than the other way around.  Tiana (Anika Nani Rose) also defies convention by being an African American heroine whose main ambition in life is to open up her own restaurant in the bustling metropolis of 1920s New Orleans.  The last thing she's waiting around for is some old Prince Charming to come riding to the rescue, bringing meaning and purpose to her life.

One would think that, with all this iconoclasm floating off the screen, ""The Princess and the Frog"" would be a more interesting and intriguing movie than it ultimately turns out to be.  Yet, as though through some kind of reverse magical spell of its own, the more ""different"" the movie becomes, the more familiar it feels.  Perhaps, the reason lies in the simple, old-school style of animation (cell as opposed to computer-generated) that the filmmakers have chosen to employ in this instance - or perhaps in the fact that this inverted fairy tale shtick has already been done so many times before, especially in the more imaginative and biting ""Shrek"" films, that it's bound to seem less than fresh here.

Whatever the cause, ""The Princess and the Frog"" never quite lives up to its potential, ultimately becoming weighted down by a rambling storyline, a surfeit of less-than-fascinating subsidiary characters, an undistinguished Randy Newman score, and a stock villain - a shadowy practitioner of the Black Arts - who fails to generate any real quality of menace or threat (certainly not in a manner comparable to the great Disney bad guys of yore).",1285891200,2,1776,4.916387959866221

When I went to see ""The Little Mermaid"" in the theater 20 years ago, I was struck by its innovative animation, grandiose music and most of all - its sheer heart. It touched me like no other Disney classic had. Here I felt like I was watching something that had already been done better in the past.

Think of the scene in Ghost where the bad guy gets dragged off by the shadows and ask yourself if you want your little kids watching that. Same thing here. Maybe even worse.

Next, the characters were flat and boring. They were so stereotypical I found myself wondering what was for dinner rather than wondering how the movie would end.

Finally, the real hook for this film was to present the first black princess. And yet she spends most of the movie as a frog. What is up with that?

[WARNING!: Philosophy, skip if this bores or offends you]
I have to say, I was a little bit surprised to see how Disney portrayed the first African American princess in their animated features.  Yes, I know Disney has a long history of re-telling classic fairy tales with their own take on things, and that many of those tales include a rags-to-riches main character.  But ... for the first African American princess ... a poor New Orleans (complete with southern accent) girl ... really?  I consider myself a fair-minded person, and I can see that this type of story is fair game.  They have been telling the same basic story featuring Western European princesses for decades now: Cinderella being the one that comes most immediately to mind.  I was just surprised that they chose this type of story to feature their first main character African American princess in.  But I guess that shows that society really is making progress towards being color blind?
[/END PHILOSOPHY]

ANYWAY, that being said, the story is charming.  Their firefly hero, Ray is charming and endearing.  His love for ""Evangeline"" (a bright star) is sweet and poignant.  We all loved Louis, the horn blowing jazz player-at-heart.  Tiana, the main character is also believable in her motivations and flaws, as is Prince Naveen as her love/hate interest.

My wife and I agreed that the character of Dr. Facilier is both creepy and scary, and that he is also not well explained.  The voodoo magic that he does during the movie, and the things that happen because of it, are most likely to severely frighten small children aged 6 or younger.

Overall, the story is good, and has all of the classic Disney touches: rise and fall, true motivations playing out, precarious situations, reversals of fortune, etc.  But is it still a good film, with a decent message, and it is well implemented.

I have heard all of the criticism: prince Naveen is too light skinned (what a light skinned man can love a Black woman?), that it shouldn't have been set in New Orleans (that person is an idiot) and should not have had voodoo (uh hello, have you ever been there?!)

As a Black (well, biracial) woman whose adored father died before he could see her transition to greatness, this film delivers.

Disney has the grace to go old school with gorgeous hand drawn sets that made me smile huge. When they get on the street car, I got excited. When they drove past mansions, I thought, ""hey, I've been there!"" and when they showed a loving family sharing dinner with their neighbors, it gave me a warm glow.

One of the messages of the movie is clear: sometimes what we want and what we need are different. Oh and sadly, sometimes hard work is not enough. The former is a lesson I know well. The latter, I'm still working on.

The vivid, vibrant colors, the voice of Anika Noni Rose and the characters Tiana encounters are fun and just what you would expect from a Disney feature. The Shadow Man, played with style by Keith David, is a tip of the hat to that Voodoo Trickster god Papa Legba (and if I was you, I'd stop talking smack.)

Personally, I loved it. The vibrancy and spirit of this film fits not only one of my favorite places on Earth, but works with 1920's vivid cultural panarama. One of the characters I truly loved is Lotte: say what you will, but I promise you, I know many a Southern girl just like her. Funny, vivicious and spoiled rotten! I thought Lotte was pure fun.

At the very end, Tiana sings the final line of the movie ""Dreams come true in New Orleans"" and my heart simply welled up and overflowed: because dreams do come true in New Orleans and that is why the movie was set there.

Focusing on it being the site of a terrible tragedy and overlooking its rich and magnificent history is a travesty.

Don't focus on how long it took to get a Black princess or any of the silly, trivial little things that people jumped on (really? the prince is too light skinned? *rolls eyes*)

This movie is not represenative of the black experience for most.  Only people with roots in the creole culture might relate to this movie but that is only a fraction of the African American experience.  What happened to the fantasy framework of all the other Disney princess movies?  Film makers persist in portraying African Americans steeped in the stereotypes of the antebellum south. The very over played setting of The black servant's child playing with the rich white plantation owners daughter needs to be put to rest. The south, the massa/servant relationship, the dixieland music, the gumbo, the dialect, the voodoo, the caricatures, the prince, of course, couldn't be a black male to save the black princess and other stereotypes galore made for an incredibly disappointing cinema experience and disappointed with Disney --again. Blacks have progressed eons beyond the black slave/servant image ..just look around in the real world and step outside of racist stereotypics perceptions of black people in the USA .

4069589,4,B0034JKZ8G,"Disney's ""The Princess and the Frog"" isn't one of the absolute best films in Disney's 70-plus year legacy of animated movie-making, it does stand up as one of the better ones. I wouldn't put it in the same league as Beauty and the Beast, for example... I would probably put it roughly on par with (or just slightly below) Aladdin. But regardless of how good the movie is (and it is good), it is an important film for both Disney and fans of animation alike.

When it was revealed that Home on the Range would be Disney's last hand-drawn flick due to the increasing popularity of CG movies (and thus, the decreasing popularity of 2D), many fans of the Disney classics, including myself, were more than a little disappointed, to say the least. Disney had built their legacy by making fairy tale masterpieces of traditional hand-drawn animation, and Home on the Range hardly qualified as ""masterpiece"" material. It was quite a downer to see that legacy end on such a decidedly average note - it just felt incomplete.

After five long years and three non-Pixar CG films that failed to set the world ablaze (Chicken Little, Meet the Robinsons, and Bolt), Disney has gone back to their roots and realized what made them great in the first place. And right from the get go, there is an air of distinction about the movie: For starters, it's set in New Orleans in the 1920s, hardly the sort of European setting one would expect from a fairy tale. Oh, and Disney finally has their first black princess. Yes, after decades of Caucasian princesses, then dabbling a bit with other cultures (Native Americans with Pocahontas, Asians in Mulan, and even the Hawaiian culture in Lilo & Stitch), Disney has crafted a hard-working all-American woman for their newest princess - and a woman of color at that. Sometimes culture integration like this can feel forced or pandering (the latter comes to mind in the case of Pocahontas), but the story in The Princess and the Frog is written for the characters rather than the other way around.

The previews for the movie set the stage pretty well - everyone knows how the fairy tale story of The Princess and the Frog ends - she kisses the frog and he becomes human. Disney sets up the premise in this movie so that when our heroine kisses the frog, she turns into a frog herself, and the bulk of the movie features the two of them learning to work together to find their way back to being human.

The villain in the film that sets the whole thing in motion is a voodoo doctor named Facilier, often referred to as ""the shadow man"" for his association with the dark arts. Of course, the voodoo magic performed in The Princess and the Frog has practically no relation to actual voodoo practices, but it's a novel attempt to try and make a villain with unearthly powers that also fits the New Orleans setting. And when he gets his comeuppance at the end of the film (as pretty much all Disney villains do), it's quite possibly the most satisfying dispatch Disney has come up with to date.

Naturally, there are some elements that have been ""Disneyed up"" to make the movie more palatable to the family audience - racism is only touched on ever so lightly and only in the briefest of moments, and it would have been VERY prevalent in the 1920's, particularly in the south. There isn't even the slightest bit of outrage by anyone in the movie at the concept of the rich white daughter of the cotton baron potentially marrying a dark-skinned prince. Of course, the movie is a somewhat modernized re-telling of a fairy tale, and thus is not meant to be a wholly accurate portrayal of America's history, so it really doesn't negatively impact the movie. It just takes a wee bit more suspension of disbelief from those of us who are familiar with America's past (and, unfortunately, the present) than it would for a child. At the other end of the spectrum, however, Disney has no problem making jabs at the stupid, bumbling ""rednecks"" in the film.

Really, if there's anything that disappoints about the movie, it's the pacing. It moves a little too quickly from one perilous situation to the next - our heroes get out of the proverbial frying pan and into the fire in such rapid sequence, there's sometimes too little down time between the action scenes.

In the times Disney does break up the action, it often does so by returning to another hallmark of the great Disney classics - high-energy musical numbers. The music this time around is a eclectic mix of Jazz, Gospel, Cajun and other southern styles. The music and lyrics are written by Randy Newman, and they have his trademark style, for better or worse. I'm not a big fan of his music, but I have to admit his style of composition is a perfect fit for the film, and so I was able to enjoy it (also because although he wrote the music, he doesn't sing it). Some of the songs are much weaker than others and seem more like filler (""When We're Human"" comes to mind), but most of them are quite well-written and completely appropriate for the movie.

The Princess and the Frog is a strong addition to the Disney lineup, and whether you're a die-hard Disney collector, a fan of animation in general, or just want to have a good time watching a movie, I would pretty much be able to recommend this movie to just about anybody.

I purchased the Blu-ray + DVD combo pack of the movie. Disney has been releasing it's Blu-ray movies this way for a while now, and I personally think it's a fantastic idea. People with Blu-ray players may wonder why they would need or even want a DVD included, but there are some valid reasons: First and foremost, portable DVD players are fairly inexpensive nowadays, so having a Blu-ray disc for the home theater and a DVD for the kids to watch in the car might be a pretty solid deal for parents. Likewise, if you have a Blu-ray player, but maybe your friends don't, you'd still be able to loan them the DVD copy if they want to watch the movie. Secondly, if you don't yet HAVE a Blu-ray player, but you are considering getting one, you may want to pick up the combo pack because you'll be able to watch the DVD now, and then when you get the Blu-ray player, you'll already have the disc to watch it in high definition - you won't have to ""re-buy"" or ""double-dip"" or whatever the kids are calling it these days. And of course, it is also available as a single-disc Blu-ray as well, if you don't want to spend the extra few dollars to get the Blu-ray + DVD bundle.",1278892800,3,6465,4.528253424657534
4069590,5,B0034JKZ8G,"The Princess and the Frog is a superbly animated, imaginative family film that shows what Disney can still accomplish with good old 2-D, hand drawn animation to tell a powerful and emotional story. The plot moves along at a very good pace yet there's still room for plenty of character development; and the decisions of which actor or actress should voice which part on screen were thoughtfully made. Indeed, this movie grabs your attention right away and it never lets go until the final frame--this is all THAT good. The music by Randy Newman and others is excellent; and when the actors voicing the characters sing, they sing flawlessly, too.

When the action starts, we meet rather young childhood friends Charlotte (voiced by Breanna Brooks) and Tiana (voiced by Elizabeth M. Dampier) nearly spellbound as they listen once again to Tiana's seamstress mother Eudora (Oprah Winfrey) tell the story of how a frog was turned into a handsome prince when a young woman kissed it. Charlotte, who comes from wealth, wants to make that fantasy a reality while Tiana chooses the more traditional route of hard work to get ahead, a choice practically made for her since she comes from a poor African-American family in New Orleans where this all takes place. However, Tiana learns the importance of love through her parents; money isn't everything. Tiana also wants to open her own restaurant just like her father always wanted to but never had the money to actually do.

And there's more to the plot that I can tell you without giving too much away! One year as Mari Gras approaches, Prince Naveen of Maldonia (voiced by Bruno Campos) comes to New Orleans with his personal assistant Lawrence (voiced by Peter Bartlett). Prince Naveen is soon tricked into becoming a frog by the evil Dr. Facilier (voiced by Keith David) who wants to keep the Prince a frog so that he can have a grown up Charlotte (now voiced by Jennifer Cody) marry Lawrence who is magically made to look like the Prince--and then Dr. Facilier can control all of New Orleans with his buddies ""from the other side.""

Add to this a huge New Orleans party thrown by Charlotte's ""Big Daddy"" (voiced by John Goodman); a trumpet playing crocodile named Louis (voiced by Michael-Leon Wooley); a Cajun firefly named Ray (voiced by Jim Cummings) and an elderly blind woman named Mama Odie (voiced by Jenifer Lewis) who weaves magical spells to do good from her home in the bayou and you've got one heck of a movie. There's plenty of suspense, too! Will Charlotte be fooled into marrying Lawrence? What happens when the grown up Tiana (now voiced by Anika Noni Rose) kisses Prince Naveen after he's turned into a frog by Dr. Facilier? Will Tiana and Prince Naveen ever achieve happiness when up against Dr. Facilier and his evil buddies--and how could they do it as mere frogs? No spoilers here--watch and find out!

The DVD comes with deleted scenes; and I also liked the music video for ""Never Knew I Needed,"" one of the major songs in the film performed by Ne-Yo.

The Princess and the Frog is a remarkable comeback for traditional animation at Disney and that's grand. This is a story with characters that are real--even the good people have their flaws and no one is portrayed as perfect. I highly recommend this movie as a fine family film although I must admit that there are a small number of scenes that could be somewhat scary for very young children.

4069597,4,B0034JKZ8G,"After watching this movie, I've finally come to understand Disney's movie strategy every year.  Basically, every year Pixar releases a movie with either all of the lead roles being male, or half of the lead roles being male.  The same year, Disney's traditional cartoon will have a female lead, or a male-female shared lead.  So for 2009, Pixar's release was Up, starring all male leads.  And Disney's traditional cartoon was another ""princess"" movie with a female lead.  To complete the separation, the Pixar releases are non-musical CGI extravaganza's geared towards boys while the traditional Disney cartoons are musical masterpieces that spawn talking books, soundtrack sales, etc... that are geared towards girls.

Now to the movie itself.  Featuring Disney's first ever black leading lady, this is a great family movie.  Yes it is a ""princess"" movie, but there is nothing prissy or girly about it.  Instead, it is more of a ""lift yourselves up by your own bootstraps"" movie that would make Oprah proud, which might be why she has a small role in it.  The leading role is voiced by Anika Noni Rose, the lesser of the trio from the DreamGirls movie several years back.  She does a great job leading the movie, and her singing voice is excellent.  The songs are great; not catchy like those from Lion King but instead more modern, rhythmic and entertaining.  The supporting cast is also great, and includes a jazz-playing alligator, a backstabbing butler, a voodoo witch doctor, and a firefly among others.  And unique among Disney cartoons, a principal character actually dies at the end.

The film is just over 1.5 hours long, which is just right for a children's movie.  The story is both original, yet derived from familiar themes that Disney has used before.  Overall, a great movie and maybe the best movie for kids in 2009.  I would say it was better than Pixar's Up.",1277424000,,1877,4.886075949367089
4069598,3,B0034JKZ8G,"I am probably going to piss quite a few Disney fans off by not giving this movie a glowing review. Just remember before you see red that I am not saying The Princess and the Frog is a bad movie, on the contrary it is quite good. What I am saying is that it lacks something compared to other Disney films.

The Princess and the Frog is about a young woman named Tiana who struggle to earn a living as a waitress in 1920's New Orleans. Her dream is to open up her own restaurant. At the same time a prince from a non existent Slavic sounding country arrives in town. (Ever notice that whenever American movie makers need a royal person they invent some nation with a name that ends with via, like Moldavia, Moldevia and so on.) The prince have been disowned by his parents for his outgoing lifestyle and he is looking for a wealthy woman to marry so he can continue his jet set lifestyle. Unfortunately this Prince end up in the claws of an evil Hoodoo sorcerer called the Shadow Man which turn him into a frog. Later he meets Tiana who have borrowed a dress from her rich friend Charlotte. The Prince talks Tiana into kissing him believing her to be a princess, however as she is not she is instead turned into a frog to and the movie is mostly about them trying to find a way to become human again. Along the way they pick up a half mad Cajun firefly and a music loving alligator.

Now all in all this movie is fun. The story is interesting and the animation as always with Disney is perfect. The characters springs to life on the screen and it has obviously taken allot of pepole enormous amounts of time and effort to animate them. However the movie do have some problems. Let me list them.

Problem 1: Who was the target audience for this film? It seams far more directed towards adults than children. First off all the movie's princess is as boring as boring can be. Let us have a look at other Disney princesses and other female leads, they all had something special about them, something which made them interesting. Tiana is an everyday girl, she is poor, but she is not so poor as to create the fighting against injustice type character like with Cinderella. She is an average, lower class girl who works to jobs trying to realize her dream to start an restaurant. Had this movie been set in modern times she could have been your next door neighbor. Realism is well and good but not in a Disney animated movie, they are supposed to be about magic and wonder. Let us see, Esmeralda is a fiery Gypsy dancer who fight for the freedom of her downtrodden pepole, Ariel is a mermaid and the daughter of the King of the sea himself who sacrifice it all for love, Aurora is a princess raised by three fairies, and the list go on and on. Tiana is a waitress.

This movie did not do that well in the cinema and I can definitely see where the problem lies. Adults might like the realism of this movie, however the biggest target audience for a Disney cartoon is children, and for a princess movie, little girls in particular. Well the princess in this movie spend most of it as a frog, and most of the time when she is human she is not wearing pretty dresses and doing things that are attractive for little girls, she is just a waitress.

Now there are Disney films more directed at boys, usually with a male lead. But in those there are at least some fights and action, though off course not worse fights than to be acceptable for children. In this movie there is hardly any of that, even defeating the main villain is not done with any kind of action so the movie is clearly more geared towards girls, but there is really nothing for little girls to enjoy in it.

The Princess and the Frog do have some interesting and funny side characters. Including the Shadow Man the main villain, but these characters are given so very little screen time as the movie focuses so much on Tiana. For adults the story of a poor girl who works hard to get what she want in life an finally succeeds is interesting. However I do not see that this movie will really be that attractive to children.

Problem 2: In most Disney movies the music is wonderful and memorable. I mean how many pepole do not know the music of the Lion King by heart, and after watching a Disney cartoon I always find myself humming the tunes for weeks afterwards. When I had finished watching the Princess and the Frog I found that I remembered none of the songs, not as in the text had not stuck but as in I remembered nothing about them. The music in this movie is not bad, it is just that it extremely generic, which is strange for a movie which has music as a central theme.

Problem 3: Where the hell is that Disney magic? I am not here talking about magic power in the film as it are plenty of that with two sorcerers and some evil Spirits thrown in the mix. I am talking about that special touch which make Disney cartoon movies special. For example in one of the scenes in the film there is a Mardi Gras parade. It would have been a perfect opportunity to show some of the details and dazzling animation skill that Disney is so famous for, however instead they show one or two attractions in the distance with no details and then straight to the character's doing stuff. Most Disney cartoons is a feat for the eyes, there is so much detail that you can see the film 100 times and still not catch it all, not so with this film, it plain and simple skimps on the details at times.

Problem 4: This movie should have been longer, it uses so much time setting up Tiana's background story that there is no time for the secondary characters to shine or for about anything else. The movie feels rushed. And extra 20 minutes would have made this movie oh so much better.

Problem 5: The plot off this movie is so extremely contrived that even a child of five would loose suspicion of disbelief. Ok situation: The prince have been turned into a frog, and knowing the story of the frog price he decides he have to kiss a princess. He sees a girl in a pretty dress and a tiara at a masquerade party and then just assumes she is royalty. Yes for there are so many princesses in USA and every girl in a evening gown in royalty right? I mean seriously they could not find some other way for the misconception to happen something a bit more believable?

In conclusion. I am not writing this to bash the Princess and the Frog, as in all honesty it is a good movie. It is colorful, and at times it shines, as with for example the fireflies or the Shadow Man. However it is just that this movie is far under the standard for Disney it is probably the worst of their animated movies, that still makes the Princess and the Frog a pretty good movie, but it is not what I would expect from Disney.",1277337600,5,6738,4.29763779527559

'The Princess and the Frog' is a vibrant and colorful joy ride through Nawl'ins with some very endearing characters(Raymond the Cajun firefly is one of the best comic relief characters I've seen in a long time).

It's actually nice to see a hand drawn 2 -D cartoon again, especially when it's Disney doing it with a full passion. I can tell you honestly that the film looks beautiful and the Blu Ray makes it all that much better. I love CGI animated films, but there is a nice old fashioned quality that these hand drawn 2-D animated films have, that is lost in CGI films.

The 3 discs Blu Ray is really nice with a great Blu Ray transfer, a equally nice standard DVD, plus a treasure trove of goodies on the bonus disc and of course the new standard digital copy(who really needs this?) In closing, if you're looking for some good old Disney fun, 'The Princess And The Frog' delivers the goods, it may not be their best of all time, but it's a welcome return to what made Disney the animation giants 70 plus years ago.",1275782400,,1157,4.351851851851852
4069606,4,B0034JKZ8G,"All Tiana (Anika Noni Rose) wants is to make enough money to open the restaurant her father always dreamed of but died before he accomplished his dream. But when spoiled Maldonian Prince Naveen (Bruno Campos) comes to New Orleans and has a run in with The Shadow Man Dr. Falicier (Keith David) that turns him into a frog, Tiana gives him a kiss to turn him back into a prince only to find herself a frog as well. Now they must find The Shadow Man before his greater plot of New Orleans domination unfolds.

It seems like it's been forever since the last time we've actually seen a hand drawn animation from Disney, or course part of the reason for that is that the last hand drawn feature film from Disney was the forgettable Home on the Range. After that Disney closed the doors on hand drawn animation, that is until the new president and chief creative officer of Disney Animation reopened the doors in 2006. After reassembling the animators who were laid off or left the company they started work on a movie idea that borrowed from E.D. Baker's novel The Frog Princess and The Brothers Grimm's Frog Prince.

The Princess and the Frog is a welcome return to form for Disney animation, which outside of Pixar hasn't really had a great animated movie in years. Basing the style of the film on Bambi and Lady and the Tramp gives the film a physical style that recalls the greatest era of Disney animation, while using a mix of jazz and blues in the musical arrangements for the film gives it a fresh flavor and distinction from previous animated musicals created by Disney. Also the story and script for the film also gives off a very old fashioned vibe, fitting in superbly with the more innocent times of Disney animation, but with fresh locales as well as strong characters that are very modern also give set the film apart as something new and exciting.

Another great thing about the change in locale is the chance for many of the voice actors to experiment with the various types of accents that you can hear in and around New Orleans during the period the film is set in. Even John Goodman, who won't be heard using an accent in his new show Treme on HBO, uses an accent that perfectly suits him for the role. Stealing the show is the firefly from the bayou Ray, who has that quirky role that can be seen in most Disney films (think Rafiki from The Lion King) who's crazy, but wise and fun to watch whenever he's on screen.

While the music in the film is great, and fresh for a Disney film, nothing seems to hit the ear the way songs like ""Whole New World,"" ""Be Our Guest,"" ""Under the Sea,"" or ""I Just Can't Wait to be King"" did in the late 80's and early 90's animated musicals from Disney did. Also, I felt the moral of the story was a little to ""in your face"" something I can't really say that I felt with Disney's previous offerings. Fortunately, these minor quibbles don't detract from the film, and most likely just stem from me being overly critical based on what I expected from the high standard set from Disney's last golden period of animation.

Overall, if you enjoy a good Disney animated feature (and I know your kids do) I highly recommend this. It has all the earmarks of a classic Disney film: great music, great characters, comedy, great story, and a moral for the kids. Even if it is a little bit on the lite classic side, it is still a very enjoyable film, and definitely one that can hold it's own against Disney's earlier films. Welcome back Disney!

4069609,5,B0034JKZ8G,"I was a child during the Disney Renaissance when Lion King, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast and Little Mermaid were released and captured the hearts of children all over the world but Princess Tiana has streamed straight into my heart and ranks up there with my 2 other favorite princesses Belle and Aurora (from Sleeping Beauty).  Not just because she's African-American (although that's a huge plus) but I can relate to her having a dream and sacrificing a lot to accomplish it.  Her strong relationship with her family especially her father instilling a hard work ethic exactly mirrors my family life.

The animation is absolutely beautiful!  I'm so glad to see Disney return to classic 2D animation from when I was a child.  I took my 11-year old sister to see this movie and she absolutely loved it!  It's a winner with children although the motives of the antagonist Shadow Man may be too complicated for really young kids but he's still entertaining.  There are so many comedic moments between Naveen and Tiana in their first meetings.  Louis and Ray are charming and hilarious as well.  Mama Odie was okay but VERY stereotypical.  On Disney Channel's The Proud Family, the character o SugaMama is almost an exact replica of Mama Odie.  But this is New Orleans so I'm almost willing to give that a pass.

Another issue is the race of Naveen as Tiana's love interest.  As much as I love interracial relationships in movies I was hoping for a black prince.  But I quickly got over it.  Naveen has his moments but his personality doesn't really do anything for me so his race becomes irrelevant.  Disney movies are about the princess after all.  I do want my black prince at some point though.

The animation, music, cast and historical landmark should be enough to win any Disney fan over though.  Anika Noni Rose really brings Tiana to life and the rest of the cast is spectacular.",1275436800,,1885,4.709480122324159
4069610,1,B0034JKZ8G,"'The Princess and the Frog' delivers on all levels.  It showcases the magic and art that is Disney hand-drawn animation.  It gives us a sublime soundtrack, returns to the wonderful, musical format that all long-time fans of the studio know and love (we all grew up with it!).  I cannot recommend this film highly enough! (Ray the firefly is fantastic!!)

Why then only a 1 star rating for the Blu-Ray DVD 3 disc set, you ask?  Simple:  the amazing and vibrantly creative business that Walt Disney created and nurtured has become a money-grubbing, greedy empire.  Children may watch Disney films but they certainly don't BUY the DVDs...ADULTS in their lives do.  ADULTS shell out their hard-earned (in most cases) bucks for these DVDs and believe it or not there are adults who DON'T have kids that are fans of the films too (myself included).

I enjoy the behind-the-scenes extras that Disney Studios includes on most of their DVD releases.  They are the main reason I BUY the DVDs instead of just renting them.  I have a perfectly good DVD player.  I do not want or need a Blu-Ray disc player and I resent the fact that I would be forced to buy a (very expensive) 3 disc package that includes a useless (to me) Blu-Ray disc in order to get a plethora of behind the scenes special features.  The regular DVD release of this film includes one brief and not so special making of featurette. Keep this set, I'll be renting 'PATF' instead.

4069614,5,B0034JKZ8G,"In the early 20th century down in New Orleans, there lived a lovely waitress/chef named Tiana (Voiced by Anika Noni Rose) who has dreams of owning her very own restaurant that is as she keeps collecting money to make that a reality. However when a prince named Vaveen (Voiced by Bruno Campos) with his assitant Lawrence (Peter Barlette) come to town, they are invited to a special party to meet the local mayor's lovely daughter Charolette (Voiced by Jenifer Cody) with her father Big Daddy La Beouf (Voiced by John Goodman) that is until they meet up with a fiendish yet sly Vooodoo witch doctor named Dr. Facilier (Voiced by Keith David). He gives them an offer they can't refuse, unfortunately it turns the prince into a frog as he meets Tiana who remembers the old story of the Frog and the Princess who's kiss has to turn him human but it turns her into a frog. The two set off in the Lousiana swamps to meet up with a lovable jazz loving alligator named Louis (Voiced by Michael-Leon Wooley) joined with goofy firefly Ray (Voiced by Jim Cummings) as they head to Mama Odie (Voiced by Jenifer Lewis) so they can find a way to be human again and get back to New Orleans to stop Dr. Facilier's plans for the city.

A very refreshing, hilarious and delightful animated comedy from Walt-Disney Pictures sets a new comeback for 2D animation is perfect for the whole family and is the best animated movie of the year besides ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"", ""Ponyo"" and ""Coraline"", although ""Up"" was very good but very overrated. The makers of ""Aladdin"" and ""Little Mermaid"" has crafted an original Disney animated masterpiece even if it's inspired by the title story as it has a New Orleans flavor and the first ever African American Disney animated heroine. The animation is just breathtaking and quality with the storytelling, the score and songs by Randy Newman are just great and it has the feel of 90's disney animated movies. The film co-stars Terrence Howard and Oprah Winfrey as other voices, this one has pure heart with crowdpleasing laughs and thrills that is a must see.

This Blu-Ray offers brilliant flawless picture and sound much like you saw at the movies with great extras like deleted scenes, audio commentary, featurettes, music video, art galleries, and BD Live plus a digital copy and regular DVD.",1274313600,3,2307,4.722084367245658
4069615,5,B0034JKZ8G,"Disney has done it again.  I didn't think I'd like it as much as others in the past, but I was wrong.  Good stuff.  Our 3 and 8-year-olds both liked it, too.  Our 3yo sat through just about the whole thing - which doesn't happen often.",1274140800,2,235,4.043478260869565
4069616,5,B0034JKZ8G,This is up there with the Little Mermaid and the Lion King!  Stunning animation and incredible music.  And the story is smart and relevant.,1274140800,2,139,4.75
4069617,5,B0034JKZ8G,"It only took a couple of huge misses like Valiant and Pixar bringing in all the money and critical acclaim to get Disney back on the right track. That's not to say I'm one of those people who is anti-CG and thinks anything hand-drawn is good just because of how it's animated, but face it, Disney's own CG animated movies are best forgotten. And most of their 2D animated movies after Lilo and Stitch were a joke. I finally watched The Princess and the Frog tonight, after hearing my 3 year old daughter rave about it and how cool the Shadow Man is. And you know what? This IS a pretty damn good movie. To me, it seems like this could've come out in the early 90s along with Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast and The Rescuers Down Under and fit right in. There really isn't much I can say as far as the negatives go with this movie aside from that I wanted it to be a little longer, and that I wish Shadow Man would've gotten more screen time.

The story is pretty basic, but still fun. Tiana is a lower class girl trying to save up enough money to buy a building and turn it into a restaurant, which was a dream her father had. She's working two jobs as a waitress, and saves every cent she can, filling a bunch of coffee cans with tips. One day, Prince Naveen comes to town in search of a rich princess to marry since his parents cut him off, and it's either that or get a job. Tiana's friend Charlotte just happens to fit the bill, but before he can do anything, he takes a chance at getting rich an easier way thanks to the sinister Shadow Man. Long story short, Naveen turns into a frog and Tiana turns into a frog as well when she tries to turn him back with a kiss just like the old fairy tale. The two set off to find a way to turn human again before it's permanent, and before someone else marries Charlotte.

I really did love everything about this movie. Most of the songs are memorable, especially Almost There and Friends on the Other Side. Though if you think about it, the animation during the latter is an awful lot like the Genie's song in Aladdin- A Friend Like Me. Regardless, the Shadow Man is one of the coolest Disney villains, animated or live action, to appear in a long time. He's kind of a cross between Ursula and Jafar, and the fact that he uses his shadow to control other people via their shadows is just plain rad. I was just disappointed that he got little screen time compared to other Disney greats like Scar, Ursula, Jafar and even lesser ones like Clayton. The animation, while it did have a lot of CG bits here and there (magazine covers and cards stood out like a sore thumb), was beautiful, and the character designs are a lot like those in the early/mid 90s, before Disney started to get weird like they did with Mulan and Hercules. The cast of characters is great, and characters I thought were just going to be comic relief ended up having some truly heart warming moments. What can I say? This is a great movie, and anyone who had doubts about Disney's future needs to check it out.

Both the audio and picture quality on the blu-ray are perfect. 'not much else needs to be said here. As for the extras, well, go look at the list of them, 'cause there's a lot and I don't have enough room to talk about them all. But each extra covers nearly every aspect of making the film, though most of them are a bit on the short side. It's good to see that a newer film like this is getting the same treatment as the Platinum and Diamond editions of Snow White and others. If a special edition of this comes out in a few years, I really have no idea what extras they can throw in aside from a retrospective or something. And hey, you're also getting the dvd and digital copy here too, so you can keep the blu-ray at home to enjoy on a nice tv/sound system, bring the dvd in the car for trips, and have an extra copy on your computer or portable media player. This is a great deal.

Do yourself a favor and get this movie, if not for your kids, for yourself if you're a fan of animation and good jazz music. I've seen a lot of reviews talking about how kids were scared by the Shadow Man, but really, it depends on what your kids like. My daughter loves 'scary' things like the Nightmare Before Christmas, Skelanimals and Dia de los Muertos style art, and she's only 3. Needless to say, when another kid would say that he's scary when watching the movie with her, she'd go ""no, he's cool!"". But aside from that, there's not much here that should be questionable for anyone. Thanks for making this movie Disney, now keep up the good work with the next few and we'll see if you can get back on the road to greatness that you once were.",1273968000,7,4660,4.238470191226097

As much as I love CGI movies such as Shrek and Bug's Life, I have a close fondness to 2D animation.

The music in the Princess and the Frog is also an added bonus.  I was afraid Randy Newman was going to sing the songs like in Toy Story, but was very excited the voice-actors also did the singing for their characters.  Mr. Newman wrote some beautiful songs which worked perfectly with the mode of the story.

I do recommend getting the Blue-Ray combo pack because it comes with the DVD and digital copy--especially for those who will watch the movie in all 3 formats.

4069631,2,B0034JKZ8G,"After seeing Hercules come out in my youth and then Brother Bear in my teens I thought Disney would never make any decent hand-drawn films again. Turns out I was probably right. This looked like a horrible idea from the get-go and the end result managed to be somehow overly politically correct, racist, original, and a dull re-hash all at the same time. While it is very nicely animated and seems to have a so-so storyline, this movie is just not very enchanting. Entertaining enough to keep my attention sustained, but full of flaws that Disney will probably never escape from. They are just past their time.

Point number one: Race. The first African-American Disney princess is certainly beautiful, but it's obvious that her very existence had nothing to do with making a good story and everything to do with PR. I bet everyone on the story team was white, because I got the strong sense from the atmosphere of the film that they didn't really WANT to be telling a story about African-Americans. The portrayals of black culture seem thrown in as an obligation rather than being central to the storyline. And somehow this movie, while trying to be inclusive and politically correct, manages to stereotype cajuns, santeros, Haitians, and just about everyone else. I don't understand why a Disney movie would try and tell a story that had to do with race or ethnicity while at the same time being so contradictory. And if it's NOT about race, then this is an insincere attempt at pandering to an African-American market.

Point number two: Artistic quality or lack thereof. Character designs were totally bland. Prince charming was a hybrid of Aladdin and Cinderella's prince. No redeeming qualities whatsoever and it seems Tiana just falls for him because he's there and kind of cute. Tiana herself doesn't have many distinguishing features except for being black. The firefly looks just like the burned out dragonfly from The Rescuers. I've seen that alligator before too. The frogs, as another reviewer pointed out, look just like the one in The Swan Princess. During the musical scenes they borrowed heavily from Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King to provide entertaining visuals. Additionally, there is not a single memorable musical number in the entire movie. Disney has produced some great jazz tracks before (Aladdin) but this fell completely flat. Louisiana has an incredibly diverse and rich musical tradition and they really missed out on an opportunity to shine by neglecting this aspect of the film. What? No Scruggs-style banjo?

Point number three: Voodoo. Lots of people seemed to be upset that this movie was too dark and ""satanic"" for little kids. This is not my beef with the voodoun theme, although I can certainly sympathize with anxious parents. My issue is with the completely inaccurate and stunningly bland portrayal of this fascinating religious tradition in the movie. The main villain talks to African masks which are possessed by shadow demons and makes blood pacts with them while promising to deliver them lost souls. Weird little Chucky-esque dolls pound on drums (poorly animated) while he leaps around psychedelic tribal imagery for no apparent reason. All this for what? He is the most boring villain ever! His goal is to get a lot of money and take over New Orleans. Never mind that actual voodoo traditions are about ancestor worship and drawing power from the earth. Mama Odi, the ""good"" witch-doctor, is also weirdly boring. Like a stereotypical western witch, her best trick is staring into a boiling cauldron to gain ESP.

And seriously Disney, the ""people-turning-into-animals-as-punishment"" thing is getting so old. Shrek already did the exact same thing, followed by Brother Bear. This is not a plot device you can use over and over again without consequences. Now, this is not the worst Disney flick I've ever seen. It's okay, just barely. But I feel that as a company they should stop making films until they actually feel inspired to create as artists and aren't just trying to live up to their glory days to roll in the dough. Will this ever happen? Not likely.",1272585600,12,4115,4.950795947901592

In fact, none of the songs I can remember nor will I find myself humming their tune or singing their lyrics.  Perhaps it has to do with the setting and the style of songs.  When I can remember every song from The Little Mermaid, The Lion King, Aladdin, and the other 80-90's Disney films and I have no desire to remember the songs from The Princess Frog, then I know that it is not in the same caliber of movie.  Certainly Disney did an excellent job at the animation, but this movie should be compared to other mediocre films from Dreamworks...or even another Land Before Time film.  The entire movie was predictable and frequently ripped off other Disney films.  Some will say it is paying tribute to the other Disney films, but it seems more like they did not have original ideas so they just pulled from the movies that were infinitely better.

Again, it is not a bad movie at all and I enjoyed the experience, but it cannot be classified as Classic Disney.  The Blu-ray/DVD/Digital Copy bundle is the best deal as it gives you more movie than any other bundle you can buy for the movie.",1272326400,,1212,4.472727272727273

Having magic, black magic and or voodoo, most disney movies have this theme, example: Aladdin, little mermaid,sword in the stone,snow white*which I didn't like*...and murder lets not forget murder.*lion king* You need a villan and Dr. Facilier was perfect. He just takes advantage of the human weakness of the heart and mind. But the good thing about some movies, it only shows that in the end evil never wins.

The obvious problem is that the princess/prince spend most of the movie as frogs, but that was no big deal.  However, it could have been a very cute movie and was not.  The worst part of this movie was the highly offensive ""shadow man and his demons,"" constant references to the dark side/demons as well as all the voodoo references that were not appropriate for young children.  I also didn't appreciate the New Orleans/LA stereotypes and I am not even from LA.  Our 4yo was scared.  With each evil scene, we assumed/hoped it was the last, but this theme continued through the entire movie.  We are accustomed to the ""evil"" plots of most Disney movies. There is always at least one evil character in each one. However, this movie takes it to the extreme.  This is a very disappointing Disney movie.  Don't waste your money. I only gave two stars for the animation. That was good....the rest awful.",1271721600,,976,4.568965517241379
4069650,4,B0034JKZ8G,"It's a well-known term that you have to miss something to really appreciate what it means to you. That's also the case with hand drawn animation from Disney. Between the years of absence of a hand drawn flick (2004 to 2009), I re-discovered and re-appreciated Disney classic hand drawn features again. While 2007's ""Enchanted"" had some animated parts (which were wonderfully animated), it was a sign of relief when I heard about Disney planning to make a full-length hand drawn feature again. And hardcore Disney fans have no reason to worry; ""The Princess and the Frog"" is definitively worth a watch and it's more compelling than Disney's recent hand drawn features, which were ""Brother Bear"" and ""Home on the Range"" (in spite of enjoying the latter movie a lot)

This movie may not be one of Disney's very best features, but it's still a watchable and enjoyable feature which is worth to recommend to every Disney fan. Just don't expect a sweeping, grand adventure - this is after all John Musker and Ron Clements', which were behind ""The Little Mermaid"", ""Aladdin"" and ""Hercules"", work. If you're going in for a lighthearted, fun adventure, then you'll be certainly pleased.

""The Princess and the Frog"" does certainly have the feel of a Classic Disney Movie (at least those from the 90's), although the segments on the Bayou does bring back memories to a Don Bluth movie as well, without that being a disadvantage. Although the beginning is a little slow, the screenplay is mostly quite solid, bringing humor, adventure, romance and emotion into a cohesive unit. Since this after all a Disney movie, there ought to be a moral and a nice one as well, although you would wonder how a Disney could possibly work without a moral.

The characters are quite passable and the directors have made them appealing to the youngsters, but they've also made Prince Naveen the strongest Disney male in a long time and Facilier one of the most charismatic villains ever. Although the supporting characters may not be the most memorable ones in Disney history, they still appear as acceptable and evocative. They share great chemistry together, especially the two lovebirds.

With the exception of some badly drawn townspeople, the animation is top-notch, both scenery and character design. As other Disney fans, I worried about Randy Newman's music, since I've never found his work for Pixar particularly noteworthy or memorable. But fortunately that isn't the case by ""The Princess and the Frog"", the songs are listenable and fun and flow nicely with the movie.

BONUS FEATURES

This review is based on the Combo Pack Edition, which is definitively recommendable for fans who want the film on both blu ray and DVD - and an extra disc with a digital copy. But for those who want to check out more special features, should definitively go with the Blu ray edition, since most of the extras lie there.

Both the DVD and the blu ray edition include an Audio Commentary by directors John Musker and Ron Clemens, along with producer Peter Del Vecho. The trio provides an informative and listenable commentary, full with details of the production, story and character insights and animation. Not the very best Audio Commentary I've heard in my life, but neither far from the worst and it's the most recommendable of the features on the whole Combo Pack Edition.

Next up are a few deleted scenes, the music video from Ne-Yo's ""Never Knew I Needed"" (which by the way doesn't includes clips from the movie) and a game called ""What Do You See: Princess Portraits"", which is fun on its own merits, but nothing memorable.
On the blu ray is where the most interesting stuff lies. Or is it? Well, at lest you can play the movie in two versions; one regular one and the other with ""Work in Progress"". The latter is quite interesting, if you're a hardcore fan of the movie.

""Bringing Life to Animation"" is some life-footage references of two of the scenes in the movie; The Proposal and the musical sequence ""Dig A Little Deeper"", along with the director's commentary. It's quite informative and interesting to look at.

Next up is ""Magic in the Bayou: The Making of a Princess"" (22:11), which looks at the production as a whole. Although some parts of the production are interesting, the whole featurette comes off as a mild disappointment. Not that it's a bad featurette, but compared to other ""Making of""-featurettes from Disney DVD's, ""Making of a Princess"" feels rather slight in many ways and could've been more informative in some parts.

The other featurettes comes off as bigger disappointments, since the blu ray includes several videos that have already been released on the Internet. Some of them are a little informative, while others are pure promotional. But still, they've already been released on the Internet and in this new YouTube-era, those featurettes would be easy to find on YouTube and just exists as to refill the blu ray-edition. With a heavily promoted and successful movie (although it took a while for it cross 100 $), couldn't Disney have made more interesting featurettes?

OVERALL REVIEW
""The Princess and the Frog"" proves that Disney is still capable of making enchanting and captivating features. Although this isn't Disney's very best film, it's still a entertaining and heartfelt movie for families to enjoy. Although both the DVD and blu ray edition are surprisingly light on bonus material, I still give the Combo Pack Edition four of five stars, mostly because of the movie itself.
Now my only wish is that Disney will continue making good-quality hand drawn animation again.",1271721600,,5590,4.9162248144220575

As my wife braided our daughters (preschooler and toddler) hair even she enjoyed the dvd movie.  The movie was made for todays modern black woman.  Tiana is a young black girl growing up to believe in her self and to follow her dreams.  When times were difficult she focused on the finish line which was becoming a restaurant owner and not her present dilemma.  Throughout the movie she did not wait on a handout or a man (Prince) to fulfill her goals but when the prince finally came to his senses he realized this beautiful and independent woman was truly a treasure worth giving his heart and love .  Once the prince started acting like a good man Tiana realized there was more to life than business and with a good counterpart they both could love and support each other.

Even though I have two girls I would recommend it for boys as well, I would let them know in todays society women are to be respected as a counterpart and not like property such as these tasteless videos.  As they get older just being a true gentlemen that cares about others and is willing to work and follow their own dreams they would be sought after for being the person they are.

2. Disney's first black princess spends an hour as a frog. I think people are being way to picky on this and are missing the point. My white five year old loves this movie, watches it at least 4 times a week and wants to be like Tiana. She does not see Tiana as black, white or green----she sees a lovable character she can look up to and isn't that the true fulfillment of Dr. King's dream?",1271116800,5,802,4.369127516778524

4069678,5,B0034JKZ8G,"Why on Earth some ""genius"" at Disney ever made the decision to stop making traditional hand-drawn films is beyond comprehension to me.  Nevertheless, I am glad that it has finally made a comeback.  After all, what somebody apparently failed to realize is that it's not the MEDIUM that make a movie but the important things like STORY, CHARACTERS, and SOUND.  That seems like a fairly obvious statement but I guess it's one that needs to be made.  Speaking of story and character, this movie has plenty of both.  Despite what may be alluded to, Tiana is not really a princess at all but a girl from New Orleans.  The prince is turned in to a frog by a voodoo man and is looking for a princess to kiss to make him human again (which is what should have happened according to a classic fairy tale).  Tiana is mistaken for such a princess and once she kisses the frog prince she is turned in to one herself.  This leads to a journey of self discovery for both the ""princess"" and the frog.  The characters are all hilarious but my favorite is Louis the jazz trumpet-playing alligator which brings me to the music in this film.  It's done by Randy Newman and it accompanies the New Orleans setting perfectly.  It is so vibrant and full of life that you'll be singing all day long.  The visuals are so breathtaking that it seems like it breaks new ground.  Watching it in HD on Blu-Ray really makes you appreciate it for all it's worth.  The Princess and the Frog sits nicely along other hand-drawn favorites and it definately doesn't fall short of what many picture as classic Disney animation.",1271030400,3,1588,4.526315789473684

4069681,5,B0034JKZ8G,"The following review was published on Rancho Santa Fe Review, Carmel Valley News, We Chinese in America, and (...). I also reviewed it on Fox 5 San Diego, wsRadio ""Perry Previews the Movies.""
--------------------

What if the girl that the Frog Prince kissed in the fairytale was not a princess, would the magic still work?  You will find the answer in the magical new Disney animated musical, ""The Princess and the Frog,"" directed by the same directors who brought us Aladdin and The Little Mermaid.

The story is about Tiana, an African American little girl who wished upon an evening star in hope to get a restaurant of her own called ""Tiana's Place.""  She suddenly saw a frog staring at her!  She screamed and ran away.  When she grew up, she had finally saved enough money to buy a place for a restaurant.  It was a rather disheveled and shabby looking house.  Tiana's loving, nurturing mother Eudora helped her tidy things up.  Tiana had vivid plans for the future, but they were erased by another man who offered a much higher price.  The land owners reneged on their promise.

Tiana then again wished upon the evening star.  She was shocked to see the frog again, sitting on the balcony!  ""Ha ha, very funny,"" she said, ""I suppose you want a kiss?""  ""That would be nice!"" said the frog.  And that is where she flipped out.

It turned out that the visiting prince of Meladonia was stuck in a frog form after the evil Dr. Facilier transformed him by voodoo magic.  The frog prince promised to make Tiana's wish come true with just one kiss from her.  Tiana unwillingly kissed the frog, but something queer happened to HER!  When she looked in the mirror, she screamed in horror and jumped very high.  She saw her hand turn into a green web foot and she was secreting mucus all over her body!  She became a frog too!  Tiana and Naveen must now use their wit to navigate through the dangerous bayou in search for a cure to their spell.

One of the amazing achievements of this movie is in the large number of superb supporting characters, each with a rich and unique personality, including:  Ray, a lovesick Cajun firefly who is in love with Evangeline, the evening star; Louis, a jazz-crazed alligator who wants to play with ""the big boys;"" Dr. Facilier, a charismatic evil voodoo fortune teller with friends from the other side; Mama Odie, a buoyant, playful, 200-year-old seer who lives in the bayou on a boat stuck in a tree; James, Tiana's inspirational loving father who believed that wishing upon a star can only do half of the job, the rest has to come from hard work.

My favorite character is Tiana.  She not only has big dreams, but also works hard to achieve them.  She is very attractive and a great cook since she was a little girl.  I loved how Tiana made a delicious, tantalizing swamp gumbo and taught the carefree, fun-loving Naveen how to mince mushrooms.

I think Naveen looked better than Tiana when they were frogs.  He had expressive eyebrows and gleaming white teeth.  He is livelier as a frog too.  I liked how he made musical instrument out of a tree branch and spider web.

I love the storyline because it is fascinating and keeps you guessing what is going to happen next.
I have many favorite scenes, one of them is when Ray the firefly died, he became a star, right next to Evangeline, the evening star!  This is the first Disney movie that I know to have a character who is not a villain who died.  The funniest scene was when Tiana said, ""Just one kiss,"" then Naveen the frog prince said, ""Unless you beg for more!""  I thought these two scenes are genius touches.

The visual style is stunning. I especially love the multi-colored bottles in Mama Odie's place.  In the end, I liked when the golden light and the water surrounded Tiana and Naveen.

When I was very little, there were many frogs in our backyard that I often caught after it rained.  I named one of them, a tiny green tree frog ""Chile,"" who is my favorite, and wrote stories about him.  I never kissed any frog myself because I wouldn't want to turn into one!

I watched the first 30 minute preview of this amazing film at the Disney D23 Fan Expo in Anaheim in September 2009 as the youngest credentialed media representative.  I had a prediction that this could be a five starfish film if the rest is as good as the preview.  I was right!  I was thrilled to meet and interview directors John Musker and Ron Clements immediately following their panel discussion at D23.  Both enjoyed my drawings of frogs and dragon, and autographed for me.  I asked why they chose an African American girl as their heroine for this movie.  John Musker said, ""It has not been done before.  We thought this would be something new.  The story is set in New Orleans where there is a large African American community.  We thought it would be fun to have a heroine that is different from the other ones.""

What a difference indeed!  When I compared Tiana and many other Disney princesses from older movies, I noticed an immediate difference:  The other princesses were mostly wishful and lazy, waiting for some prince to deliver them to salvation.  Tiana, however, is self-reliant, who also reforms a lazy prince and teaches him why work is important.  Why would a prince from other Disney movies want to marry a princess whom he doesn't really know, and who doesn't know how to do anything useful except flirting around and looking pretty?

The Princess and the Frog is about love, sacrifice, dreams, and how to make your dreams come true.

When you know what your dreams are, you must pursue them with hard work.

4069685,4,B0034JKZ8G,"Apparently Disney's new ""The Princess and the Frog"" underperformed at the box office, and after watching the film on DVD, I think I see why audiences were underwhelmed.

No, the problem isn't the Afro-American heroine or the interracial romance.  In fact, I think the ""humans"" in the film are swell.

Where the film falls short, in my opinion, is the design of the swamp denizens.  Though their characters are appealing, these are some UGLY critters, from the jazz-playing gator to the Cajun firefly to the frog couple itself.

The cartoons that have made it big have always featured well-designed characters.  Think of Bugs Bunny, the Peanuts gang, or even the Simpsons.  Even if Homer Simpson isn't much to look at, he's a clever and eye-catching caricature of a shlumpy shmoe.

Here the romantic couple are frogs walking on their hind legs, and I don't think you can make such an odd and unattractive duo the focus of a romantic comedy.  Tiana is charming and charismatic in human form, but as a female frog -- yuck!

In addition, the film falls flat in its art design -- literally.  Even the Simpsons have a more three-dimensional appearance than the characters and sets in this film.

Finally, the songs in TPATF aren't much to write home about -- Randy Newman has done much better before.

TPATF is definitely worth a rental, but a purchase?  I don't know...",1270857600,,1364,4.773504273504273

I would definitely give this movie an A+.  It had everything to entertain children.

4069689,5,B0034JKZ8G,"The ""Yheas"" Have it over the ""Nahs"". The biggest issue with the ""nah"" sayers ,is the Voodoo thing in the film.
HEY, This was New Orleans back in the day. But I can understand  if some folks think its a bit too scary for smaller children.
You have a right to protect your child from things that may be a little too frightening for them.
But what puzzles me is some of these same people who say the voodoo was a bit too scary in this movie, overlook some of the scary stuff in a lot of  Disney
movies.... Plus a lot of other movies aimed at children as well. Lots of Disney and other so called kiddie pictures  have evil characters in them, especially Witches. Is witchcraft less evil then voodoo?
Non Disney movies like ""The Wizard of Oz"" terrified my little sister when we were kids. ""Alice in wonderland"" always seem like ""Alice in A Nightmare"" to me.
And the new Version in theaters now look more freakish and nightmarish then ever. To some kids as well as adults some things may be a bit too much, to others it won't bother.
But I give the ""Princess and the Frog"" 2 Thumbs up ,My kids enjoyed it, voodoo and all. The shadow man and his shadows were creepy but funny to them. Me too!",1270684800,,1185,4.234513274336283
4069690,5,B0034JKZ8G,"When my wife and I married almost 15 years ago, I became more acquainted with very unique world that is New Orleans -- particularly the food. I had not seen very many flattering portrayals of the city in movies and TV (Live and Let Die springs to mind) but it is truly an amazing city with lots of rich history, wonderful people and did I mention food?

Food figures prominently in The Princess and the Frog, since Tiana, the lead character, dreams of opening a great restaurant and fulfilling the wishes of her father. There are more than a few scenes devoted to cooking and cuisine. One scene in particular uses the proper dicing of vegetables for gumbo as a way to bond Tiana and Prince Naveen.

Music is also a core component to both the city and the film and Randy Newman delivered a full ""book"" score that touches each musical style of the region and add much-needed songs to the recent Disney catalog. My particular favorite is ""My Evangeline,"" a stunningly beautiful ballad sensitively sung by the amazing Jim Cummings (also the voice of Pooh, Tigger, Darkwing Duck and many others). By the way, every speaking actor also sings his or her songs.

There have been those who have expressed comments about what The Princess and the Frog is not, rather that what it is. Perhaps the hopes for Disney's return to hand-drawn animation created overly high expectations, but it's wonderful to see this style executed in such exquisite, classic style. I think it will hold up to the test of time and become a Disney staple.

Don't miss the audio commentary by the directors because they are very generous in their background information as well as generous in giving credit to those involved in the film. It's interesting to note their story about how, when faced with creating an animated feature after the division was all but shuttered, were looking for animation desks and were led to a secret ""stash"" collected by Christopher (son of Disney Legend Winston) Hibler -- somehow he knew they would be needed.

The Blu-Ray not only offers a more detailed and brilliant image and sound, but there almost a dozen features there that are not included on the regular DVD. Plus you get a download disc so you can watch it on your iPod. Who would have thought such things were possible only a few years ago?",1270598400,,2299,4.666666666666667

4069692,5,B0034JKZ8G,"THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG is a different sort of Disney princess movie.  Oh, all the iconic trappings are here:  ""wishing upon a star"", ""the handsome prince"", ""a fairy godmother"", ""an ugly stepsister,"" ""an evil villain"", and ""a Cinderella-like princess"".  But this time, Disney digs a little deeper, taking these icons to newer, more modern, stronger heights.  In THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG, ""wishing upon a star"" AND hard work make dreams come true, ""the handsome prince"" is a bit of a scallywag, ""the fairy godmother"" is a Bayou voodoo queen, ""the ugly stepsister"" is a bit shallow, but also beautiful, warm, caring, and the best friend of ""the princess, ""the evil villain"" is a down on his luck voodoo huckster, and ""the Cinderella-like princess"" is a waitress who works too hard and has forgotten how to have fun.

THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG is not your standard the-prince-saves-the-princess-and-they-all-live-happily-ever-after fairytale.  Rather, it is a story of the prince and the princess working together to solve their problems, each complementing the other, and helping each other to grow.  The choices are hard and not always clear.  This princess is very strong and capable; she works hard for her dreams, but still learns to risk wishing upon the star.  What a wonderful new role model!  And along the way, she has her family and friends to lean on.

I have already watched THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG twice with my nearly 5 year old daughter, and she has declared the evil villain ""not scary.""  The scenes involving ""the shadow man"" are a little dark, but at the same time they are vivid and colorful.  They are also a bit vague, which detracts from their scariness.  (If you aren't paying attention, you will miss things.  Which may be how Disney planned it.)  Overall, I would put those scenes at the same scary-level as the ""Heffalumps and Woozles"" song from Winnie the Pooh.

And let's not forget the wonderful music from THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG.  Again, Disney has gone in a completely different direction from its norm.  THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG is set in New Orleans, and the music is everything you can imagine it should be:  jazzy, bright, bold, and bouncy with a Cajun spice.  Toe tappin' and head boppin'!  What a great change of pace!  Also of note is the fact that THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG is hand-drawn like the original Disney animated movies.  And I must say it is quite a vibrant and lovely masterpiece.  Computers are NOT always better!

My entire family really is really enjoying THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG (even my nearly 13 year old).  I anticipate many more viewings in the weeks to come.  Quirky, unique, and a little bit odd-ball, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG.  I think this movie will surprise you.  It sure surprised me.",1270512000,,2778,4.775210084033613
4069693,5,B0034JKZ8G,"This movie is a bit different.  It does have vodoo in it, but as the movie is set in New Orleans, that is a reasonable choice to have for the basis of the villian.  While many people have posted that it is too scary, both my 3 year old and 6 year old girls love it, as does my 2 year old nephew.

For the people screaming about racism, this movie is set in an older time in classic New Orleans.  The rich guy is a white which only makes since for the time.  Tiana and her mom both come from a poor section of the city, but it shows strength of character to work hard and go after her dreams.  The complaints that America does not have royality really do not make sense to me, because the movie does not claim that anyone in America is royality.  They do mention the Marty Gras Princess to change the spell.

For those that worry about the religion, well, the vodoo parts are dark.  They shoe the shadow man being dragged off, but not necessarly to hell as many posters claim.  He fell victim to his own schemes, something they have done to many villians in Disney movies, examples including Beauty and the Beast, Tarzan, and Hunchback.

As soon as I heard about this movie, I immediately started telling my friends and WE dragged our kids to the movie to see it. My daughter is 3 years old and WE watch it repeatedly. In fact, we went to the movies twice to see it.  Even my husband enjoyed it!

It's not your typical rags-to-riches story. I really like the fact the story line wasn't ""the prince saves the princess"" but rather ""we worked together to solve the problem, and met some great friends along the way.""  It was a wonderful blend of dreaming and hard work, and the importance of friends, family, and love.  I loved the contrasts they used in this storyline - poor, rich, hard-working, idle, serious, fun-loving, black, white - so many tend to shy away from these issues.

4069695,4,B0034JKZ8G,"It was a slow burn. When we watched The Princess and the Frog first last week, my 7 year old had shadow man induced nightmares. I think that Dr. Facillier is the scariest Disney villain yet. All those shadows creeping around every corner look and act like demons.

The movie grew on my oldest daughter and me. At first, we both had attitude that Tiana was not only not a princess, but was poor and struggling. She had a problem with Charlotte because she was a spoiled little rich girl, but I thought she was painted with such broad strokes that you had to love her. Then I had a problem with the alligator and the lightning bug. Those accents were a bit much to take, and hadn't we already gone there in the Jungle Book with a buffoon named Louis?

And don't even get me started on the weird spirituality of Mama Odie. So, the shadow man did bad voodoo, but Mama Odie did good voodoo? Whaaat? There's good voodoo?

But lets forget about all that junk and talk about the love story, because that is what captured our hearts.

The frog prince had a very smoove voice, and from the first dialog, ""a kiss would be nice. . ."" to ""Tiana is my Evangeline,"" he was utterly charming. Tiana was so good, she effortlessly transformed the slothful ladies man into a devoted champion. And she cooked, too? I loved her from the moment she hit the screen.

The special features stank. They left me wanting much more. Where's the making of special? Where's the long-winded discussion of animated brilliance? Why do they think viewers of this movie would love to play a princess game that features other Disney princesses, but not Tiana? Well, my little girls like that game. . .

This was not very kid friendly at all, and honestly I was very surprised that the main storyline of this show was all about the voodoo man tricking the prince.  Good does win in the end, but this movie was just way to dark to be marketed for kids.  I was really disappointed in it.",1270339200,27,538,4.2772277227722775

4069698,4,B0034JKZ8G,"I was highly anticipating this movie, but I was disappointed to a degree. I felt this movie didn't have the same magic, for the lack of a better word, compared to the other Disney movies featuring princesses. Maybe because I'm a little older than I was when I saw the other movies or maybe because this particular fairy tale occured outside of ""once upon a time,"" and somewhere in a far away land.

However, that doesn't mean the movie was horrible, it was enjoyable, sweet, and did make me teary. It's refreshing seeing Tiana head out to try and make her dream come true. Her trials getting there are realistic. At first, I didn't know what to make of Prince Naveen, but he grew on me. Tiana and Prince Naveen are cute and funny together - brillant chemistry. I've got a soft spot for ""aruging like a married couple,"" sort of thing and I enjoyed the fact that not only did Tiana speak her mind, but that these two learned a thing or two from one another. Tiana's friend Charlotte is hilarious, a bit of hopeless romantic (but then, so am I), and her antics when it comes to love just makes me laugh (she's adorable).

This movie is worth the watch with beautiful animation and music. This is the Disney that I like, taking us all back to the good ole days of Little Mermaid right up to Snow White. I'm looking forward to the next installment of Disney's remakes on fairy tales.",1270252800,3,1378,4.421259842519685
4069699,5,B0034JKZ8G,"This movie exceeded all expectations. It is visually stunning, musically a work of genius, thematically sophisticated, and story-wise told in a refreshingly different way (some actions are pre-motivation) which makes the ride an unpredictable one.

Visually, Disney has gone above and beyond. They have invoked the steamy feeling of the city of New Orleans in shades of gold and lavender, and in the swamp scenes, some of the backgrounds are so expertly rendered it's like you're looking at a photograph. But what stood out the most with this artwork was the colors. They are a study in thematic contrast. In the scenes with the villain, the bright colors of Mardi Gras are used to reveal a darker, sinister side. The effect is wonderfully jarring and creates an appropriate emotional response: rather than hating the villain, we're led to mistrust him. He's pretty on the outside, but there's something awful lurking underneath. It's like that sixth sense you get sometimes with certain people in your life. In Mama Odie's scene, the color scheme is subtle and muted--until she reveals her inner goodness, and the scene explodes with color; another comment on how purity can hide in the most surprising places.

To say that once again Randy Newman has done an expert job with the music would be an understatement. He had a lot to work with here--the musical tapestry of New Orleans is a mix of Dixieland, Zydeco, and Spiritual. He could have easily chosen one of those styles and stuck with it--instead, he blends all three, and the effect is seamless. The musical numbers tend to stay in one vein or the other depending on the character - which also works to help tell the story -- but the underlying score, while you'll instantly recognize Newman's hallmark sound, is a genius integration. To top it off, because this film takes place in the golden age of jazz, he has deftly inserted musical references to Gershwin. Amazing. With so much to work with, it could have easily been a confusing or even chaotic train-wreck. Not in his hands.

Thematically, this film has taken some of Disney's classic themes and examined them more deeply: they are two-sided and complex. The choices these characters make are never easy--more so than in other films--and that updates these themes so that modern audiences can more readily identify. Similarly, Disney's newest princess, Tiana, is the strongest, most interesting princess to date. She is intelligent, complex - and oozes passion, something that, in my opinion, has only been approached (and I do insist, ""approached"") in Belle and Ariel. Tiana is a princess for today's woman. Little girls of the world have quite an exciting and refreshing new role model.

Disney's writers have chosen to tell this story in a different way, as well. It's not your typical spell-it-all-out up-front story, and some story elements are never even vocalized, they're visual, and back story and motivation are sometimes revealed after the relevant action rather than before. It was really refreshing to see Disney choose a slightly different construction--it leads to keeping the tale unpredictable and much more engaging. But I'm a writer, so I know it's hard to do this well. For the most part, Disney succeeds. However, there is a bit of a downside to this. Constructing a story in this manner can lead to a lot of subtlety in the way the story is told, and because of this, some of the characters' motives are not always clear right away. This seems to happen the most with Dr. Facilier, the villain. When he's on the screen, it's really important to concentrate or you might miss some key story elements.

All in all, don't miss The Princess and the Frog. It's the best 97 minutes I've spent in a theater in a long, long time.",1270166400,5,3759,4.885579937304075

The visuals are hands down DAZZLING; joyful explosions of color but all with a very unique aesthetic that avoid being psychadelic.

The colors were vibrant and the animation is so very familiar of how Disney used in their classic animated films. I'm very happy Disney did something different than the typical Broadway type of song. Great jazz feel to the whole thing with the colors, accents, dialogue etc. It seems Disney did a lot of research on Louisiana culture before doing this movie, which made it incredibly believable.

To some, the voodoo aspect may be ""too dark"" for kids. However, not everyone grows up the same. Voodoo is a part of Louisiana culture, and maybe the kids in that area grow up learning about it. All in all, great movie for EVERYONE and gives people an open and none judgmental feel of how others grow up/perceive the world",1269820800,15,871,4.768211920529802

And to be completely honest, I was entertained.
It was funny, colorful, the songs are contagious, and most importantly the characters have something important to say. Triana is one of the few Disney heroines that actually does something in order to come out on top at the end (let's face it Snow White and Sleeping Beauty just laid there waiting for their prince to come and save them, don't get me wrong I still love those movies but there's no denying that that's basically what they did). The ""Princess"" in this movie wish's on a star but then remarks that wishing can really get you nowhere if you don't work hard. I find this a good lesson for my daughter's to hear, and they are having fun while learning it.

4069708,4,B0034JKZ8G,"All I can say is this: It's about time!  Once again the 2D animation department at Disney has completed a theatrical release.  Now, I may not be young, and I may not have children of my own, but I know as a fact that everyone can likely attest to how important Disney's animated musicals were to their childhood.  At the age of five the first film I ever saw in theaters WAS a Disney film.  I don't support the company for the most part, but I'll be darned if I don't expect quality from their 2D department.  The Princess and the Frog is a return to that warm-hearted spirit that made Disney great to begin with.  It isn't on par with The Lion King, Beauty & The Best, or Aladdin, but it is a real success.

The story as most will know is based on the classic fairy tale, The Frog Prince...With a twist!  Our story begins with a wide-eyed dreamer by the name of Tiana, a young black girl whose mother works as the tailor for a wealthy - ...well, he looks like Colonel Sanders.  We then are taken from the mansion, through the streets of New Orleans, all the way to the shacks of the city's black community.  Here we are introduced to Tiana's daughter, a kind-face, hard-working man who looks like a cross between Denzel Washington and Barrack Obama.  Tiana dreams of opening a restaurant with her father...sadly, being in the classic Disney formula he has to die (presumably in World War I).

In her twenties (or so I'd like to believe) Tiana (Anika Noni Ross) is working a harsh job still trying to save up for her father's restaurant.  When she's ""almost there"" she attends a ball where she meets a talking frog claiming to be the playboy Prince Naveen (Bruno Campos) who has had a bad run in with a voodoo witchdoctor.  Mistaking Tiana (who is borrowing a fine dress from her rich white friend and sporting a tiara for a costume party) for a princess Naveen encourages her to kiss him in order to make him human again.  The voodoo curse seems to backfire transforming Tiana into a frog.  Together, the two of them must hop into action to stop the evil witchdoctor before he condemns all the souls of New Orleans to his ""friends on the other side"" and become human again.

There are many admirable traits about this new animated Disney feature, especially its leading...frog and frogger.  I love how this movie seems to possess a gender-role reversal as Naveen is the one being cursed Tiana is the hardworking hero.  Having a female lead in a Disney film that can actually fend for her is a great change of pace in their long line of helpless damsels in distress.  Now, I think its well worth that I have no idea who Anika Noni Ross is, but I'd be a fool not to note that she is one heck of a singer.  Her voice captures beauty in even the film's worst songs.  Bruno Campos lacks some singing talent, but his Naveen is very funny - think Peppy Le Pew only as a frog.

Of course they're joined by a colorful cast.  Ray the lightning bug, Louis the trumpet playing alligator, etcetera.  As an adult viewer these characters had their moments, but they were clearly aimed at pleasing younger viewers.  By far my favorite of the supporting cast is Keith David as Dr. Facilier (or as the characters tend to call him: The Shadow Man).  This is just a cool villain, and given Disney's history of cartoon villains that's certainly says something.  His musical number of `Friends On The Other Side' was for me the highlight of the film.  Dark, intimidating animation and backgrounds merged with David's booming voice made for a really cool song that might even scare children when it goes into its final fifty seconds; the part where everything begins to burst into blazing lights and explosions to David's cry of ""Are you ready!"" before a skull mask appears on his face just above the jaw.  Just top notch stuff.

My main complaints rest on the songs.  Aside from `Almost There' and the previously mentioned `Friends On The Other Side' most of the songs are pretty dull and uninspired.  Not to say they're bad, just that Disney has done so much better.

The Princess and the Frog is great family entertainment!  ...though the title is misleading as she's not actually a princess...Probably should have stuck with `The Frog Prince' as the title, but I guess that wouldn't be able to sell as many dolls...Curse your profit making schemes, Disney!",1269388800,2,4338,4.532133676092545
4069709,5,B0034JKZ8G,"The Princess and the Frog was one of the most anticipated films of 2009. After Disney new management (under Pixar's John Lasseter and Ed Catmull) decided to reverse that terrible decision of stop producing hand-drawn animated films in favor of the all common CGI ones. Chiken Little was awful, Meet the Robinsons and Bolt were fine but nothing compared to the Pixar films which all are excellent. I waited long to see this film and went to see it the day it opened in theaters. I wasn't dissapointed, the film felt like a return to the 90's Renaissance with beautiful animation, good characters, heart and excellent music. I just hope this trend of quality will continue in future Disney animated films.

The Blu-Ray combo pack does not dissapoint. It offers top-notch picture and sound plus a bunch of bonus features that add to the film value. The DVD looks pretty good and perfect for SD. It also comes with a digital copy. (for me is just a waste of money).

With the last 2D film from Disney being ""Home on the Range"" back in 2004, Disney talents wanted to work on a film to bring back the hand-drawn animated style and the film is titled ""The Princess and the Frog"".

The 49th animated feature film, the film is directed by John Musker and Ron Clements, known for their work in ""The Little Mermaid"", ""Aladdin"" and ""Hercules and features music composed by Randy Newman.

""The Princess and the Frog"" which was budgeted at $105 million was released back during the Thanksgiving holiday week and was quite successful, earning $246 million worldwide and was nominated for eight Annie Awards and also three Academy Awards.

VIDEO:

With what we have seen from Disney when it comes to animation in the past decade, they have set the bar quite high in terms of animation and especially within the past several years of what one can expect from a Blu-ray release.  When you have a good number of significant animators from Disney working on this film, you're going to expect quality and nothing less than that.  Fortunately, they deliver with this beautiful, vibrant film.

""The Princess and the Frog"" just boasts of wonderful colors and impressive detail for its artistic backgrounds.  Presented in 1080p High Definition (1:781 aspect ratio), we see the details from the plants, the tree trunks in the swamp area, the beautiful surroundings of the La Bouff mansion and beautiful detail in terms of the character's movements.  I personally didn't see any artifacting or edge enhancement during this film.  Overall, Disney has once again gave us a film that looks magnificent on Blu-ray!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""The Princess and the Frog"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (48 kHz/24-bit) and also French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital. It seems like it's been quite a long while, but the film boasts an exciting musical with fun and entertaining jazz music courtesy of Randy Newman and musicians.  Dialogue and music are crystal clear from the front and center channels and a good amount of surround use and LFE for the more dominant action scenes.  Every character has its share of contributing to the soundscape with Tiana and Prince Naveen hopping through the swamp, Ray buzzing through the air and Louis jamming on that trumpet. And of course, any scene that features a crowd is nicely heard through the surrounds.  A good dose of musical and action scenes that keeps the soundscape quite immersive.

Overall, magnificent lossless audio for ""The Princess and the Frog"".

Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""The Princess and the Frog"" is another wonderful animated film that I have no doubt will become a classic.  It's also one of the most modern animated films from Disney as the female lead is not wanting to become a princess, nor is she looking for her knight in shining armor.  Tiana is an independent, hard working woman who wants to start her own restaurant and she wants to become a business owner.  She's an intelligent character and for the most part, I also enjoyed that Disney has created an African-American, female lead character for this film.

Also, I found it quite exciting to see Disney return to its hand-drawn animated roots.  Not to say that I'm not enjoying the CG animation from Disney/Pixar but it was great to see John Lasseter and team working together in bringing those magical and music Disney hand-drawn animated films back.  Using today's modern technology and today's animators, they were able to create a film that just looks magnificent and also a soundtrack that is just incredible, fun and energetic.

As for the Blu-ray release, this is a solid release as you get an awesome Blu-ray filled with special features but also included is the DVD of the feature film and also a digital copy that works great during those long commutes (and also to keep the children busy).

Overall, ""The Princess and the Frog"" once again achieves another masterpiece and creating a film that will no doubt become a classic.  Highly recommended!",1269302400,,7524,5.005636070853462
4069712,5,B0034JKZ8G,I had a nice time watching this movie. I could not wait until I seen it. This movie I think all the kids will love to see. This is a movie you have to have around for all times.,1269302400,,177,3.5641025641025643
4069713,3,B0034JKZ8G,"This is not one of the best Disney animated movies out there, nor is it the worst. It kind of just falls right in the middle which is why I give it 3 stars. The movie starts out with a lot of promise but then gets bogged down and slow half way through it with by going off track just so they could add a few more songs. There are some scenes that may be too scary for younger kids (2-6) with themes about selling your soul to the devil and sacraficing lives which is a complete 180 from their main theme which is that you can acheive your dream with hard work.

Even that theme gets bogged down with ideas like marrying into money, and money can still get you happiness over hard work. I think the Prince actually had the ""best"" life. He was able to enjoy most of his life mooching off his parents. Then he found the love of his life, and was able to settle down with her and do what he was passionate about(music) without having to learn much about hard work....so Luck> Money > hard work> day dreaming?",1269216000,,1004,4.148717948717949
4069714,5,B0034JKZ8G,"I grew up watching The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, and the like, and while I absolutely adore all of the stuff that comes out of the Pixar studio, I was missing some of the classic Disney. I have to admit that before I watched the Princess and the Frog, I was a bit concerned. A lot of fuss had been made over the fact that the princess was African American, and while I have no problem with princesses of any color, I hoped that they didn't focus more on the ethnicity than on the story.

Thankfully someone at Disney got their head screwed on straight and the story is superb. Not only is it fun to watch, but there are a number of life lessons that you can learn from the movie. While I enjoyed the entire movie (and yes, I cried) I really liked a few specific things, including the fact that the ""spoiled little white girl"" in the movie wasn't a bad person. She, in the end, while definitely being spoiled, had a very sweet personality. I loved the music (can't go wrong with Randy Newman) and the fact that they selected actors who weren't hugely famous (save Oprah and Emeril, of course) so that the voices didn't immediately bring that person to mind. Instead you were able to connect the voice to the character, which always makes an animated film better.

This movie has already been watched five times in our house since we purchased it - and I'm not ashamed to admit that twice I watched it for my own private viewing while the kids were at school. Well done Disney! You definitely were able to go back to your roots while, at the same time, bringing some great lessons.",1269216000,2,1578,4.382252559726963
4069715,2,B0034JKZ8G,I was very disappointed with this movie. I thought it was very dark and evil in some parts. My 7 year old said that this was the scariest cartoon he had ever seen.

I am not Cajun or African American, but if I were I would be offended at the way they are portrayed in this movie.  The Cajuns are made out to be stupid idiots roaming the wild.  I thought the African Americans would be the successful ones the story was about and was sorely dissapointed to find out that they were the average Joe's and the white people were the successful, rich people.  I really had hoped that Tiana would be the princess that was successful.

It is somewhat dark though.  I appreciate the VooDoo that was included since that is true to the story of New Orleans, but for a kid, it is a little scary.",1269043200,,759,4.186206896551724
4069718,3,B0034JKZ8G,"OK, who remembers outstanding Disney animated films?  I sure do.
This last decade Disney dropped the ball after they reclaimed their standards in the late 1980's.
If it had not been for the Pixar films the last decade would have been a failure.

This film was much talked about.  Then, underperformed at the box office.

Anyone remember good Disney characters?  How about memorable Disney music with their films?  Gone are the days.

The film is good BUT not up to the old Disney standards.  Some humor.  NOT enough to carry the film.  In my opinion they went back to the standard of 1996's  The Hunchback of Notredame which just was OK.  Watchable but not outstanding.  Not a film you look forward to watch again nor do you talk about.

Copied, used ideas.

Same here.  A few minor characters like Louis the alligator.
No Disney songs you will remember.  Notice no Oscar wins for Disney music in years.  Jazz.

Good looking animation is a plus.

Now, Disney has just gone cheap in their DVD releases.

Pushing or better said shoving blu ray down everyone's throats.  The DVD was like original DVD releases after the format came out in the late 1990's.
A plain Jane silver disc.  WHERE is artwork from the film on it?  No chapter search list.  NO good extras.  Just plain cheap.  DISNEY, TAKE NOTE, NOT EVERYONE IS SWITCH TO MORE EXPENSIVE BLU RAY.  I am sure NOT.  I want to see extras on Disney DVD's.  Not you have to spend a lot more money to get a blu ray or blu ray combo pack just to get any extras of worth.

Just a watchable animated film.  You will not be talking about it or remembering the songs.",1269043200,5,1608,4.4567474048442905
4069719,5,B0034JKZ8G,"I'd like to begin in saying that if you're looking for a film that can be described as the modern-day classic Disney, then this is the movie for you!  Naturally there will probably never be another 'classic' quite like Snow White or Cinderella, but The Princess and the Frog does a fine job of living up to the classic Disney name.

I first seen the film in theatres, and though a bit skeptical in how much I'd be into an animated, 2-D musical formatted like the oldies of yester-year, I found myself thoroughly enthralled by the perfection of the animation, the plotline, and the over-all quality of the film; considering the film was brought to us by the directors of such films as ""Aladdin"" and ""The Little Mermaid,"" we can only expect as much!  I'm in my early 20's, and I was just as giddy about the film as the little girl sitting next to me in the theatre was.  It's filled with wonderful music, spectacular scenery, and a very nice streak of comedy that will keep you asking for more!

Over-all ""The Princess and the Frog"" has, to me, turned out to be a true masterpiece which I am sure will be treasured in the years to come.  (Especially since it's the last 2-D film that, may possibly, ever be created by Disney.)",1269043200,,1224,4.441964285714286
4069720,4,B0034JKZ8G,"In my view, Disney's golden age of hand-drawn animation was when they pumped out memorable hits like ""Little Mermaid"", ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""Aladdin"". These movies were followed by a series of lower quality relatively forgettable films like ""Emperor's New Grove"" and ""Hunchback of Notre Dame"".

When I saw ""Princess and the Frog"" I felt like it ended Disney's down streak and ""Princess and the Frog"" might even rank it among the more venerable modern classics - sort of. The story is fresh and interesting, the characters engaging and the music is pretty catchy, even if it doesn't live up to the unobtainable legacy of Alan Menken and Howard Ashman, who wrote the Oscar-winning scores of what I call the ""golden age"" classics.

It's also a good change of style to the Pixar hits, as much as I love them, and makes me feel a bit nostalgic about how cartoons used to not all be rendered by computer.

My toddlers love it, and I myself find the film entertaining! It isn't quite on the level of a ""golden ager"", but pretty close! Bravo, Disney!

As far as this particular package (the ""Three Disc Blu-ray/DVD/Digital Copy""), I'm a big fan of being able to take my movies with me on my iPhone for the kids to watch on car trips so I love the iTunes copy!

Also, while I hold the controversial view that some hand-drawn Disney Blu-ray films don't really shine at 1080p (the antiquated cel animation of Snow White, for example, feels too basic to make the picture really pop), ""Princess and the Frog"" looks phenomenal! Cool lighting effects, shading and detailed scenery easily make this the most impressive feeling Blu-ray cartoon that doesn't use clay or silicon as the basis for its animation.

All-in-all a great movie and an excellent package. I highly recommend it!",1269043200,,1772,4.737012987012987
4069721,5,B0034JKZ8G,"Music has always been a part of Walt Disney cartoons, going way back to Steamboat Mickey in 1928! But Disney never seemed to acknowledge jazz until now. The studio's newest feature film, The Princess and the Frog, has New Orleans jazz all over it! From the jazz based score by Randy Newman, and a jazz-talking alligator named Louis (who has the unmistakable voice of that cat named Satchmo) who plays ""Dippermouth Blues"" and a tribute to Sidney Bechet, this is one truly delightful film. The story takes place in the 1920s French Quarter and features the high quality hand drawn animation Disney is famous for. For the zydeco and cajun music fan there's a bit of that too, courtesy of Terrance Simien. Dr. John also gets a song and he's on the soundtrack CD too! Okay, there's the pop vocal love song by Ne-Yo to attract the teens, but there's plenty of other great music and a fun story line for adults. This may be my favorite Disney movie in years!  Highly recommended for anyone from 8 to 80! Check out the companion Soundtrack on CD too!

It marks Disney's exciting ""return"" to hand drawn animation, which has been sorely missed by this reviewer. Since the glory days of Aladdin, Lion King, Little Mermaid, and my personal favorite, Beauty and the Beast, the momentum of hand drawn movies slowed to a virtual standstill. But as shown in the Princess and the Frog, there is a place, if only for the beauty of the art, and the stunning quality that it brings. Welcome back!

The story, set in 1920's New Orleans, spells Tiana's desire to open her own restaurant, is a charming riff on the whole kissing a frog who changes into a prince story. Tiana is strong, independent, and forward thinking, and delightfully afraid of frogs. Initially tricked into kissing the frog, she pays her price by becoming one herself. The music is a rollicking embodiment of New Orleans style jazz.

Even better, Tiana is African-American. Why is that better? Because it's about time that movies, especially ones with the Disney prestige, show all types of Americans in their movies. Tiana serves as a positive role model for some of our youngest citizens of color, and can also serve as a role model for any child of any color.

That all being said, watching this movie on our home movie screen, I was stunned by the color, animation, and visual complexity of this film. It's stunningly beautiful. Perhaps the only movie that comes close to this quality is the recently release, Up.

This is a great movie, with great music, and a look that is all it's own. Highly recommended!",1268870400,,1774,4.654952076677317
4069727,4,B0034JKZ8G,"First off, I must comment on the blu-ray triple pack of this film. I like that Disney movies have been coming out in these jumbo packs that come with both the dvd and the blu-ray. If you're not interested in one or the other, you can give either as a gift. For example, I had no use for the dvd; so I gave it as a gift to my niece and nephew who love the movie, and I saved myself the twenty dollar price of the DVD by itself. All in all, great bargain.

Now, I want to review this movie. For those of you debating whether this movie is buyable or not; stop thinking, and buy it, especially if you have kids. This film has a lot of the charm that made the classic Disney movies so great, even though I do not think it will be on the shelf with films like The Little Mermaid, Lion King, or Beauty and the Beast; but it may make it as a secondary classic on par with Hercules and Tarzan. The film has many catchy tunes, tunes I memorized within the first week of seeing this film, and I sing them to my niece and nephew any chance I get. The film strays away from many of the Disney film cliches in the way that it breaks away from the tradition of ""happily ever after."" For one thing, the protagonist is not a rebellious or snobby young woman who thinks solely of herself; she is a hard-working and independent African-American woman striving to make her own dream come true in a world where it's been denied to her. In any case, she is relatable and honorable. When other princesses were unrelentingly wishing upon stars, this princess felt ridiculous doing it. She takes herself too seriously, therefore creating a character that seems too clever to live inside the realm of fairy tales. On the other hand, the prince, rather than be an accessory or one-dimensional (as he is portrayed in films such as Cinderella or Sleeping Beauty), is surprisingly really funny and delivers some really good one-liners (he's finally given a personality we can sympathize with). Just here alone, Disney already broke away from a certain mold. The villain actually plays a really small role in this film, unlike Ursula in Little Mermaid or Jafar in Aladdin. This, however, does not make him a boring adversary. On the contrary, he is interesting since he has quite a debt to pay to his ""friends on the other side."" The sidekicks, a trumpet-blowing alligator and a Cajun firefly, are very funny and provide some interesting comic relief as well as enhance the theme of looking deep within yourself to find what you need. An interesting character in this film is Mama Odi, an old, blind voodoo witch who practices ""white"" magic.

Before this film was released in theaters, I heard a lot of speculation that Disney was typecasting and stereotyping African-Americans. That was not what I believed, but I accepted peoples' judgement. When I saw this movie, I did not see anything racist about it. I heard complaints that the princess sounded too black, but I think it would have been insulting if Disney casted a white woman to voice the protagonist. They didn't get a black woman to voice Belle in Beauty and the Beast. I think the voice of princess Tiana had the accent of Old New Orleans, and I think to get insulted from the little things is quite ridiculous. Secondly, I think people should feel honored that finally a princess representing African American women has come along with a lot of depth in her character and a lot of culture and spirit in her heart. Another thing I thought might upset some people was the fact that the villain, Dr. Facilier, was a Voodoo doctor, who they also called the ""Shadow Man."" I'm sure there are many people who practice voodoo who would argue that Disney made it look like a bad thing. However, the storytellers are quite smart; instead of showing one side to voodoo, they show two, with Mama Odi. Dr. Facilier's positive counterpart in this film is Mama Odi who practices good magic, and is full of insight and wisdom. Therefore, in cancelling each other out, no room is left for speculation or debate. The film was being true to a spirit, a spirit they tried to capture by hiring musicians who spent a great deal of their life in New Orleans. I personally think the film did justice to New Orleans and America, in general. They, the filmmakers, applied various aspects of old African-American traditions to make a film that paid homage to that lush culture.

See this movie; you'll love it, your kids, nieces, nephews, and cousins will love it. It's got zing, it's got heart, and most of all, it's got gumbo. Enjoy.",1268870400,2,4541,4.542124542124542
4069728,4,B0034JKZ8G,"As many reviewers have pointed out, ""The Princess and the Frog"" is Disney's welcome return to the traditional hand-drawn-style animation. What is more important is that the film is helmed by Ron Clements and John Musker, a director team responsible for two great Disney animations - ""Little Mermaid"" and ""Aladdin"" - and, well, less impressive ""Treasure Planet."" ""The Princess and the Frog"" marks the ""comeback"" of the creator pair since the ill-fated sci-fi action adventure, and their latest work, though not perfect, is entertaining enough to remind us of the glorious days of Disney animation.

Tiana (voice by Anika Noni Rose, ""Dreamgirls"") is a hard-working girl dreaming of one day owning a restaurant in New Orleans. One night she encounters a talking frog begging for just one kiss. This is actually Prince Naveen (Bruno Campos), a spoiled prince magically turned into a frog by voodoo master Dr. Facilier (Keith David). She does, reluctantly though, like in a fairy tale she once read - which is only the beginning of adventures and a romance for Tiana and the prince.

Though ""The Princess and the Frog"" is an enjoyable tale with colorful designs and talented cast, it doesn't quite reach the height of classic ""Little Mermaid"" as the film lacks two major characteristics: a compelling story and memorable music. The story starts out interesting with a few unexpected turn of events, but it sags a bit in the middle part. The musical part (songs penned by Randy Newman) is good, but not as great as Alan Menken/Howard Ashman's original songs like joyful ""Under the Sea.""

What you have instead is Jazz-age New Orleans and everything associated with the city turned into animation - the swamp, the French Quarter, Mardi Gras and Tiana's Cajun cookbook. The goofy trumpet-playing croc steals every scene from the two leads. Maybe not as great as ""The Lion King,"" but ""The Princess and the Frog"" is a pleasant fantasy tale.",1268784000,,1930,4.987577639751553

Honestly, it felt like a re-hashed mix-matched version of every other Disney movie that has come before.  I've grown up watching Disney movies and had high hopes for this one, but instead saw bits and pieces of every movie I've loved thrown together to a new soundtrack.  A soundtrack that sadly sounds like Phil Collins doing jazz.... I can't bring specific moments to mind (I watched it in the theatre when it opened and haven't seen it since), but if you've seen Disney movies several times, you'll see what I'm saying.

I did like aspects of the movie.  Princess Tiana is beautiful and gorgeously voiced.  But, I find it interesting (and disheartening) that Disney's first BLACK princess is forced into a FROG form 3/4's of the movie.  I wish there'd been more African-American culture included in the movie.

I liked the villain.  He was scary, but so have ALL Disney villains.  I liked the hoo-doo Voo-Doo.  It may have been theatrical, but at least it was different than all the other villains (even though this villain looked like Jafar redrawn and had a similar sidekick).

And, I LOVED Lottie, Tiana's friend!  She was hilarious, the only character who made me laugh out loud!

The kids liked it, I didn't mind it.  I'll buy it and we'll watch it a lot I'm sure, but it will never gain the place in our hearts held by movies like The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast.",1268784000,,1630,4.623693379790941

There was an EXTREMELY scarry scene where the prince makes a ""blood pact"" with the devil in order to find true love. They actually show him pricking his finger and FEEDING the blood to a statue. Umm....all I can say is wow. And people are comparing it to the ""evil"" in other disney movies. NO WAY. This is actual satanic rituals being played out on a children's movie. I bought it without seeing it first...and now my copy is for sale at Amazon.com. The only reason it gets a 2 out of 5 for me...was because it was the closest thing to a good Disney fairy tale we have had in a long time.

I love all the Pixar films, but Princess and the Frog is another reminder of why Disney needs Pixar so much!!! I felt like the movie had some good moments, but I would have to say the Voo-doo magic and villianous moments ruined the movie for me. This is supposed to be a children's movie targeting young girls, but I don't feel it is at all appropriate for young children to watch. I am quite surprised Disney would produce this and market it to kids given how much the movie entertains the dark magic theme. I am disappointed in the story development, lack of good songs, fear factor for children, and would never consider this a great film.",1268784000,6,747,4.45985401459854

How this gem only grossed under half of what that dreadful Chipmunk sequel did last winter I have no idea, but its to our under shame for sure. Warning though you must come with a sense of logic and rational thought process and not live in superstition as this film tries to up the standards of animation storytelling it also cant necessarily be aimed at all 1-4 year olds. I grew up watching Disney and my most favorite film was the very dark Sleeping Beauty and very eerie Maleficent who was symbolic of her dark magic. Sure it scared me as a kid but I had rationale parents that knew how to intelligently understand that its pure fantasy and relay that. There was no real witchcraft in 16th century salem or anytime on this planet. Its very sad to see how much we are regressing, depriving and sheltering our child so much that folks are giving one star to this because it uses voodoo. It reminds me of all those sad people that had issues with Harry Potter. Its New Orleans, Disney movies always have magic and darkness and Voodoo totally and completely makes sense here. By gosh Bambi scared me as child, as did Rescuers and The Great Mouse Detective. And that's perfectly fine, I came out okay. I dare argue most of us spend the rest of our lives trying to find movies that will scare us again like that and give a response for just one night. Enjoy this film, it could very well be the last hand drawn disney film outside Pooh bear we ever see. If not I surely hope we respect the art better next time.",1268784000,2,1587,4.419795221843003
4069735,5,B0034JKZ8G,"I truly enjoyed watching ""The Princess and the Frog,"" not only because it is quite an entertaining movie, with all the traditional Disney elements, but also because it provides evidence that good, old animation is still alive and well. This is important because, despite the greatness of computer-generated animation, Pixar's style, the classic animation should never die. ""The Princess and the Frog"" is delightful and colorful, spiked with an excellent jazzy soundtrack.

As in any other Disney film, this is a story about good versus evil, with a dose of true love. The main star is beautiful Tiana, whose working-class parents do the best to provide for her. However, it is her father's cooking that she inherited, and her dream is to open a restaurant - ""Tiana's Place"" - in her native New Orleans when she grows up.

The years pass by and Tiana indeed becomes a beautiful woman, who divides her time working as a maid and as a waitress. One day, she learns through Charlotte, one of her closest friends, that Prince Naveen is visiting town. Charlotte's father is rich, and he is hosting the Prince with a party.  Enter the Evil Dr. Facilier, a powerful voodoo practitioner who sees money in marrying Prince Naveen and Charlotte. For that purpose, he transforms the prince into a frog. That same night of the party, Tiana goes to the balcony of Charlotte's mansion and asks a star for her dream to open a restaurant to come true. It is then that the frog appears out of the blue, and tells Tiana that if she kisses him, he will transform into a prince, and that he will help her open her restaurant. Bad move. That's when Tiana's problems begin.

""The Princess and the Frog"" is just precious - a treasure --, and brings back Disney's tradition of quality animation. It is also an important film in terms of political correctness, because the main characters are all African-American (voices included). This intelligent design follows the footsteps of ""Mulan"" and ""Pocahontas"" of significant roles for minorities in animated movies. The Blu-ray edition reviewed here, in addition to the film, also includes deleted scenes; a making-of feature; the documentaries ""The Return of hand-drawn animation,"" ""Conjuring the Villain,"" ""The Disney Legacy,"" and much more  This fantastic set includes a disc with the DVD version of the film, and another one with a digital copy.

4069736,4,B0034JKZ8G,"Prince Naveen might know the differnce, bit I'm not sure I do. Nor am I sure that Ron Clements and John Musker know the difference between this film and their previous films, because there isn't much of one.

Maybe I'm just getting old, but practically everything in ""The Princess and the Frog"" seems a bit stale. Not only does the story resemble a mash-up of ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"", but there are more than a few moments and characters that seem to have been lifted from previous Disney films. For example, Tiana has a dangling lock of hair that resembles Belle's. Dr Facilier (who isn't given enough time for us to really learn to hate him) comes across as a voodoo Jafar, etc, etc, etc.

The only real surprise is that one of the ""good"" characters dies. This is the first time this has happened since ""Bambi"". (Trusty was supposed to die in ""Lady and the Tramp"", but Peggy Lee supposedly talked Disney out of it.)

""The Princess and the Frog"" isn't as good as ""Lilo and Stitch"", a considerably more original and charming film. It's second-rate Disney. But, to be fair, second-rate Disney is better than anyone else's first-rate. The kids will love it, and as is typical of Disney, there's nothing in it to make adults wish they weren't watching it.

Ok. I will admit that I am 31 and I've already watched this movie 15 times in the Cinema, and that's not because my niece made me. This movie really brings back 2-D classic animation but not through elaborate action. What is surprising about the Princess and the Frog is how real the characters appear (from animation style to acting). There are emotional gestures performed by ""Princess Tiana"" that I had not seen in other Disney films. From a Plot perspective, the film is actually more mature than one might expect. It was interesting for me to see how much more I could identify with The Main characters (Tiana & Navin) then My own niece could. As a musical, It really is a Jazzy treat and a wonderful tribute to New Orleans' heritage.
This story is about dreaming big and working hard and mixing a little faith in the middle. In times like this, where adults seem to feel like we're loosing more than we gain and question where our hopes have gone, The Princess and the Frog brings a wind of hope for all.
It's innocent but mature. it's fascinating yet practical.

There are many great lessons in this movie to be learned for both children and adults.

By Olivia

The movie The Princess and the Frog is about a girl who has a dad and a mom. Her dad wants a restaurant, but never gets one. The girl takes his place and earns the restaurant. Before she earns the restaurant, when she prays a frog appears by her window. If you see the movie, you'll find out what happens next.

My favorite part of the movie was when the crocodile came on the boat like a fox. He went on the boat because he wanted to play jazz with the people but they just scattered him off like a cat. When I saw this I was eager to see what was going to happen next.

A movie that inspired me to go see The Princess and the Frog was the movie Cinderella. It has romance and balls in it just like The Princess and the Frog. The part with romance in Cinderella that inspired me was when the prince and Cinderella get married.

If you are someone who is looking for a fairytale with romance then the movie The Princess and the Frog is the movie for you. The movie is sweet and weird. It is sweet because Princess Tiana finds love. It's weird because this girl kisses the frog and gets kissing marks all over the frog.

By Telisha

In the Princess and the Frog, a princess has to sweep and clean. Her name is Princess Tina. When she is all grown up, her dad dies and she promised him that she will get the restaurant that he wanted. Princess Tina had to get something from her friend to make this happen.

My favorite part is when a frog kisses the princess, and she turns into a frog! I laughed so hard that I fell out of my chair. At the end of the story, they kissed again, and they became humans. They got married and lived happily ever after.

My name is Telisha Bovell, and I am telling you this is a great movie. You don't even want to stop watching it. This movie is just like Cinderella. They both met princes. You could find it in your local theater now.",1268179200,2,1898,4.108108108108108

4069746,2,B0034JKZ8G,"I watched this movie during the weekend and did not expect it the way it is.  The interaction of the frog stories is very cute and the whole idea of a princess having to kiss a frog to make him human again.  However,  this story is about Voodoo magic and it is something a lot of kids will not understand and are going to become frightened when they see several images as the movie goes along.  Besides the scary images (which also include showing the bad guy walking around and a completely different image of its shadow against the walls) there is also references to Satan as the Shadow Man mentions during several occasions his 'master' (or something like that).

I would not buy this movie to any kid.  I strongly recommend an adult to watch it first before showing it to a kid. I do not think Disney should have gone to the extremes with the Voodoo and black magic stuff.",1268092800,5,876,4.3765432098765435
4069747,3,B0034JKZ8G,"As animation, fantasy this was a good movie.  As themes go, I must say that this movie smells.  Typical racist attitude, that Disney has exibited forever.  An up and coming young Black Princess, unable to find that ideal man to make her life complete, circumstances lead her to...

A great deal has been written about the fact this is an interracial situation.  As usual it is the White guy with the woman of color.  As if it does not occur in the other direction.  Oh yes that continues to be taboo in 21st century America.  Like many of the early Westerns, the White guy gets the beautiful Indian Princess, the Asian beauty, or the beautiful Mexican dancer.  We only want your women.

Why an exploration of interracial dating with this film aimed at mainly young Black impressionable girls, and in this manner.  Why not both ways to tell our young people there is nothing wrong with a Black man having a wife that is White, or even a White man with a Black wife.  Or maybe that is the point.  It is ok for the White man to marry outside the norm, but not the White woman?  Or worse yet the Black man is persona non grata.  This is a theme I have observed a great deal in Hollyweird, Hollywood, of late, since ""The Body Guard.""

In a great many movies of late we will see one Black woman, and she just happens to be the love interest of a White guy, and hang out with only White guys.  Not one Black male in the entire movie.  Disney has even placed this theme in some of it's for children weekly animation series.  Then there is Nickelodeion's ""True Jackson,"" and ABC Family's ""Lincoln Heights.""  All aimed at young people containing the same theme.  Why?

Please Hollywood, wake up realize that this thing called interracial dating, and marriage happens both ways, and being racist about the theme is a horrible way to show our young people how life happens to be.  Sad that we cannot get past these sterotypes, built into our outlook so long ago, and this animated movie does nothing to empower society to look past color.

Do I wish this movie had been all Black, maybe.  Just why was not ""Prince Charming,"" Black?  Should Snow White have had people of color included, or Sleeping Beauty, of course.  But when the first movie for Black children comes to being, why must it have this theme? I wonder how many behind the scenes people with a little power were Black?  I do not know, but I dare say none.  Thus the insensitivity of this presentation.  So what if a bunch of...",1268092800,3,2478,4.442222222222222

4069749,5,B0034JKZ8G,"The Disney Studio has made a return to its hand-drawn roots (with the aid of some computer technology of course) with its first hand-drawn animated fairy tale in many years. It is also the first time the studio has set one of their fairytales in America. Tiana (voiced expertly by Anika Noni Rose of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dreamgirls-Blu-ray/dp/B000O179FO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dreamgirls[Blu-ray</a>]) is a young girl in 1920's New Orleans. She is focused on making her late father's dream come true of opening her own restaurant; this leaves no time for love or fun. Enter Naveen of Maldonia, a handsome prince who has been disinherited by his family for his laziness. Tiana and Naveen are brought together even though they are polar opposites because of the black voodoo magic of the evil Doctor Facilier. The two are forced to journey together to get what they both think they want...which naturally changes along the way. No plot spoilers here...this rich movie needs to be experienced personally. Although I am generally not a Randy Newman fan, his music here is memorable and toe-tapping. New Orleans provides the perfect atmosphere for the music showcased here: love songs, blues, jazz, and more. You will end up singing more than a few of the wonderful tunes you hear. My very favorite number is ""Almost There,"" which is sung by Anika's Tiana as she helps her mother (voiced by Oprah Winfrey) envision her dream restaurant. This sequence is done in an art deco poster style and just blew me away.

The hand animation is also memorable; the frogs come to life and you believe the emotion that they express; the eyes...the smiles...the movements, all delicately rendered with time and love by the Disney animation team. New characters also join the classic library of Disney: Mama Odie (the blind voodoo priestess), Charlotte (a rich girl looking for her prince voiced by Jennifer Cody), Ray (a firefly in love with Evangeline the Evening Star), and Louis (trumpet-playing alligator). A trumpet playing alligator? Sure sounds stupid, but the animation team pulls off every unbelieveable thing you could imagine with their talents. On Blu-ray, the lush painted backgrounds bounce off the screen, and the music will make your speakers rock. Note of caution; as with almost every Disney movie, there are some dark and very sad elements. Parents should definitely be nearby for the young ones.

Specs:

Bluray is 1080p High Definition/1:78:1 with English 5.1 DTS HD Master Audio (48kHz/24-bit) * French and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital * English SDH and English 2.0 DVS, French and Spanish Subtitles. Bonus features on bluray are 1080p High Definition/1:78:1 with English 5.1 Dolby Digital * English SDH, French and Spanish Subtitles.

Bonus Features: Quite a few here shown in high definition on blu-ray; interestingly enough though, the clips from the older Disney library are still in low pixelized quality.

-Deleted/Alternate Scenes: with introductions by co-writers/directors Ron Clements & John Musker. These are shown in rough storyboard form with ""scratch dialogue"" (not voiced by the actors in the movie). 4 scenes are shown: ""Advice from Mama,"" alternative version of Louis' introduction, ""Stop and smell the roses,"" and ""Naveen confides in Ray."" The last one is the only one that I would say is missed; it is a different version of what is scene on screen of how Naveen reveals his feelings to Ray (and the audience) about Tiana. It is more touching and tender than the final version. The other deletions were made wisely!

-Music and More: ""Never Knew I Needed"" music video by Ne-Yo. Shot in New Orleans, this really has very little if anything to do with the movie. Ne-Yo is shown romancing a girl, and other than them eating beignets and seeing the evening star at the end, there is not much of a connection to the film. This is the one musical number that really doesn't fit stylistically; mercifully it is shown over the credits at the end.

-Bringing Life to Animation: live action reference footage is shown and introduced by Clements & Musker. They stress that this footage was not traced, but used as an aid and point of departure especially for the dance numbers. See the live footage for ""Dig a little Deeper"" (Mama Odie's showstopping number) and Charlotte's proposal scene. Very interesting to see how the movements of the live dancers and actors inspired nuances that translated to the animation. Sherry Butler, in her 20's, takes on the role of dancing Mama Odie the voodoo priestess.

-Audio Commentary by Musker, Clements, and producer Peter Del Vecho

-Magic in the Bayou: The Making of a Princess (22:11): Excellent featurette! Executive Producer John Lasseter tells of how he wanted to bring back hand-drawn animation to the Disney Studio, and accomplished this by bringing back Musker & Clements. Don Hall, in charge of the story, relates how the classic elements of a fairy tale were twisted here, such as the typical fairy godmother becoming Mama Odie, the sassy voodoo priestess. Mark Henn, Tiana's supervising animator, tells how difficult it was to convey a frog without having the frog look ugly. A similar situation was handled back in 1940 with Jiminy Cricket in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pinocchio/dp/B001ILFUDM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pinocchio</a>."" New Orleans is a character itself, although the animation team stylizes it as well. Because of the choice of New Orleans, the rich ""gumbo"" music (a plethora of styles) fits like a glove here. Animator Eric Goldberg tells how they painted what it ""feels like"" to be in New Orleans, capturing its essence rather than some of the uglier details. Anika Noni Rose is pleased to be part of the production that uses African-American characters; she correctly feels that it's important for ALL people to be able to feel the ""fairy dust"" fall on them too. Thrilled to work for Disney, she talks about how they have a way of teaching children about hope, dreams, and perseverance. She also wisely tells us how this movie isn't necessarily about finding a prince as it is about finding love, whatever that is for each person. You'll also see Betsy Baytos, the choreographer responsible for the ""eccentric dance"" (comedy in dance) of Mama Odie and the other memorable characters. Most of all in this featurette you'll learn that hand-drawn animation is an art form that is back with style!

-The Return to Hand-Drawn Animation (2:43): Andreas Deja leads off with a recreation of his victory dance that he performed when it was announced that the studio was returning to hand-drawn animation with ""The Princess and The Frog."" Making drawings come to life is the ultimate magic and illusion. As animator Bruce Smith says, ""We're back!""

-The Disney Legacy (2:31): very short featurette about the influences of the Nine Old Men on the younger animators who are carrying on the legacy for Disney, ""The Rolls Royce of Animation.""

-Disney's Newest Princess (2:51): Princess Tiana's supervising animator Mark Henn is interviewed here as well as Anika Noni Rose who says that working on this picture ""was a dream come true.""

-The Princess and the Animator (2:26): featurette about Mark Henn, who has animated other famous Disney princesses such as Ariel, Belle, Jasmine, and Mulan. ""I carry a soft spot in my heart for princesses."" Tiana is a strong character because she is proactive; rather than waiting for her dream, she works hard and is determined to get it on her own.

-Conjuring the Villain (1:50): Animated by Bruce Smith and powerfully voiced by Keith David, Dr. Facilier is Disney's latest villain.

-A Return to the Animated Musical (3:13): Randy Newman is the man behind the music of this film. Having spent summers as a youth in New Orleans, the music there is in his blood. Local talent from the area was used in the movie, including Dr. Johnny. It is related that the theme of gumbo in the movie also applies to the music's diverse mix of songs: gospel, blues, cajun waltz, and romance.

-Art Galleries: quite a few images to see here; the only disappointment is their size. Plenty of room to have made them bigger. Galleries are: Visual Development, Character Design, Layouts & Background, Storyboard Art

-Game: What do you see? Princess Portraits: Guess which princess (or non-princess) the lightning bugs (Ray's family) are creating bug-by-bug.

-Sneak Peeks: Genuine Treasure: Tinker Bell, Disney Movie Rewards, Old Dogs, James & The Giant Peach Special Edition, Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Treasure, Fantasia & Fantasia 2000 Diamond Edition, Disney Parks, Beauty & The Beast Diamond Edition, Toy Story 1, 2, and 3

4069750,5,B0034JKZ8G,"I had been waiting to see this movie, and I finally got the chance when I went to the theatre. I have these things to say:

Don't ignore the one star review that complains of the use of dark magic. There is dark magic in the film, but it is not ""half of the whole movie"" and there are no incantations, chants or anything, just a lively song. Most of the young kids I've seen had no problem coping with this, and my family adored the movie inspite of the magic element.( This is coming from someone with a deeply religious family). In short, unless your child is very sensitive and might be frightened this is nothing to worry about.

The characters in this film are realistic and well rounded, If they don't start out that way they are quickly brought down to earth. The theme of Princesses living happily ever after with the help of the forces that be and without any effort on their part is destroyed. Unlike Cinderella, Snow White, Or Princess Jasmine, Princess Tiana works for everything she gains in lieu of having a fairy godmother or some other convienience. A good theme for young children.

Yet another good fact is that most of the characters don't get what they initially WANT in the end, but what they NEED. and they find themselves to be a lot happier.

This movie is also very comical, particularly the protagonist's best friend, Whose witty, clueless comments and actions can even make adults laugh.

American black culture from New Orleans. It was a rich movie all around!",1267315200,,437,4.382716049382716
4069752,5,B0034JKZ8G,"I was a bit of a skeptic when it came to this story and this film.  I have a 4 year old daughter and she LOVES Princesses.  I was absolutely thrilled to see an African American girl as the main character of this ilm and that it was set in the burgeoning period of jazz in New Orleans.  The GREAT things about this film are too numerous to mention; the songs are ALL fantastic (they get stuck in your head and my daughter's head); the animation is absolutely beautiful and, for someone who likes to spare his kid from nightmares, I found the evil Dr. Facilier to be one of the better bad guys Disney has ever created.  The shadows are a bit scary for the young ones, but no more scary than Ursula from Little Mermaid or the old hag from Snow White.

The thing about this film is that it is infectious through and through.  The characters are hilarious and wonderfully rich, the music is full of New Orleans flavor, and the message is one that Disney has been lacking for years...wishing upon a star only gets you half way to your dreams, you have to work hard to get what you want.  Tiana is a spectacular role model for young girls while Naveen, Louis and the Cajun firefly, Ray, are thoroughly entertaining.

Your kids will LOVE it!",1267056000,5,1233,4.3304347826086955
4069753,5,B0034JKZ8G,"Most of the reviews both by Disney fans and critics alike are all focusing on the wrong viewpoint of this film.
The point is not that Tiana is African American (my children don't notice because children don't see ""colors""on skin) or that this is not exactly traditional Disney fare. The point is that a modern character faced modern problems and that love and the timeless story of The Princess and the Frog prevailed. Tiana is a frog for nearly the entirety of the film because that is who she was in life. In fact, she's a frog from the beginning until the last 15 minutes of the film and becomes human long before the surprise ending of the Dr. Facilier's frog spell. True it was Prince Naveen who ""transformed"" her but Tiana's refusal to see love or friendship was caused by ambition. This ambition wasn't bad or for selfish reasons, but in pursuit of her fathers dream she ignored everything he had tried to teach her. If you look past the political correctness or the ""coloring issues"" within the movie you can see this clear as day! My four year old got it and when Tiana goes in search of Naveen to tell him that she's fallen for him, my son declared loudly in the middle of the theater, ""he love her mama!"". When the Charlotte tries to break the spell without ""getting her prince"" he was ecstatic and when he saw the impostor prince ""marrying"" Charlotte he was heartbroken.

The magic is not Disney fare but it fits in perfectly with a cultural immersion of New Orleans. It goes without saying that the animation is GORGEOUS and the music is good too. The gospel number with Mama Odie is by far my favorite!

The secondary characters almost steal the show. Charlotte in all her spoiled glory is actually a big-hearted, cute and hilarious Southern Belle. Mama Odie is lovable and zany and goes around nearly killing her beloved pet snake and smacking ""young 'uns"" on the arm for their ""stupidity"". Big Louis is funny and gives the movie a faster pace. Ray is by far my VERY favorite ""supporting actor"" and will belong in the same pantheon with Jimminy Cricket and Tinker Bell. I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it, but Disney's second star to the right will be immortalized forever thanks to Ray.

All in all the modern retelling of the fairy tale is needed for this generation. Times are hard, we have to work harder and our dreams may not come true in the way we thought they would, but LOVE is still worth fighting for. Disney thinks that Love is worth the revival of hand drawn animation, actual orchestra's composing the soundtrack and YEARS working on a modern story board.
This is not the revival of hand drawn animation, it is the revival of the Love story for a generation who forgot how to fall in Love. It's a modern example of what poets, writers and legends have been in pursuit of for centuries. The idea of Love without bounds that can defeat any obstacle.",1266796800,18,2889,4.530651340996169
4069754,2,B0034JKZ8G,"I was excited for my little girl to see this movie, but was greatly disappointed. The movie has alot of very dark magic, not the cute disney magic but dark and evil and scary. (They had to get blood from the prince for the magic to work, and they brought back spirits from the dead.) My daughter got scared and had a hard time understanding the movie. The princess part of the movie was cute, but almost half the movie was the evil magic. We will not be watching this movie again.",1266796800,18,480,4.228260869565218
4069755,5,B0034JKZ8G,"I am 31 and I grew up LOVING Disney movies. My kids (4 1/2 and 2 1/2) love em as well. I own all of the major titles and have acquired a very large collection of Disney soundtrack music as well. I was pumped to take my 4 1/2 year old to see a 2D original style Disney film or at least a good excuse to pay theater prices to see it. Unfortunately it just was not good. The story was okay but the characters were forgettable and what's worse is that there weren't ANY good songs! Every good Disney film has a catchy, memorable, or fun song (or several of them in most of the films). This movie definitely did not. I will buy it just because I'm such a fan, but I'll leave it up to the kids to watch it because I was flat out bored with it. Bummer..........
Well, my kids are now 7 and 5 respectively and I have watched this film probably 6-7 times and I love it. My kids love it too. They both have all the songs on their iPod's and we all enjoy watching this movie together. I guess some things just need to grow on you at times. I change my 1 star rating  to 5.",1266537600,19,1061,3.912037037037037
4069756,5,B0034JKZ8G,"Okay... First off:  My girls (ages 4 and 6) and I LOVE this new Disney movie!!  It has all the classic Disney elements along with some new and modern themes as well.  The messages of The Princess and The Frog are excellent for children and adults alike:

  1-Wishing really does only take you halfway... hard work is what helps to make dreams become a reality.

  2-Too much of one thing is never good.  Too much hard work for Tiana and too much play for Naveen gives neither of them true happiness.

  3-The tried and true:  Be careful what you wish for and don't try to take the easy way out!  Naveen thinks the Shadow Man is going to give him what he wants... he gets turned into a frog.  Tiana thinks kissing Naveen is going to get her the restaurant she wants... she gets turned into a frog.  Sometimes you spend so much time trying to get what you want, that you neglect to see what you truly need.

  4-And of course, Love above all else.

There are some scary elements to the movie.  Like Dr. Facilier using the shadows to do his dirty work.  And of course the voodoo.  But it is New Orleans, and if you're going to have a movie based in New Orleans, voodoo has to pop in there somewhere.  Unless you want your villian to be a flasher for some Mardi Gras beads, but Disney doesn't really do the gratuitous nudity thing do they?  ^_^  So you just have to trust that this movie really brings back that Disney excellence from olden days long gone in this digital world.  The animation, the music that helps the movie along instead of being just filler, and of course, the characters.

The secondary characters in this movie really do steal the show.  Especially Charlotte and Ray.  Charlotte IS a spoiled girl who always gets what she wants, though when Tiana knocks the table over and gets dirty, Charlotte leaves the party and her ""prince"" to help Tiana get cleaned up and changed.  She is truly a good friend.  And Ray... the lightning bug.  He may be small, but when he talks and interacts with the main characters, he really takes over the screen.  So if you want to laugh out loud, cry, gasp and cover your eyes, and have a GREAT time;  Please watch this movie!",1266364800,6,2172,4.369346733668341
4069757,5,B0034JKZ8G,"Being in my mid-twenties, I think I'm much older than the intended audience for this movie, but I have fond childhood memories of Disney, so the rave reviews for this one led me to see it in the theatre. And I absolutely loved it! It had everything I wanted in a Disney movie: fun songs, a creepy villain, and a touching plot that made me cry at least once but ultimately left me fully satisfied.

The best part for me, though, was the rich historical setting--1912 New Orleans. Disney has been praised for taking a bold step with a  black heroine, but even more important for me was the fact that her station in life was portrayed realistically. Rather than trying to hide historical injustices, The Princess and the Frog faces them head on and shows that it's possible to achieve happiness despite all difficulties.

Tiana is not only black but poor, working multiple jobs in the hopes of one day saving enough money to start her own business. The ditzy white Charlotte, on the other hand, has plenty of money and gets everything she wants from her indulgent father. We see at the very beginning that white people lived in fancy mansions, while black people lived in tiny shacks. And yet we also see that Tiana's childhood was a happy one, with a loving family and a close-knit community. There are some powerful messages throughout the movie about how hard work is important, but a loving family is more important by far.

I don't want to spend too much time summarizing the plot; suffice it to say that one character's greedy attempt to use voodoo for personal gain results in both Tiana and a foreign prince being turned into frogs. The majority of the movie consists of their travels through the bayou, searching for a voodoo priestess to turn them back. Of course, they encounter all sorts of interesting creatures in their travels--the firefly Ray was possibly my favourite character in the movie--and learn some valuable lessons about themselves on the way.

I was really intrigued by the whole voodoo aspect; it's a belief system that I don't know anything about, but just being aware that the magic system of the movie had a whole history behind it gave the story a satisfying sense of depth. I came away from the movie wanting to learn more about both voodoo and the general history of race relations in the American south (and have, in fact, purchased books about both topics since then). This, to me, is the mark of a good story: The Princess and the Frog not only is rewarding in its own right, but leaves the viewer inspired to explore related areas. I'll definitely be purchasing this movie once it becomes available, because I know it's one that I'll want to see again.",1265846400,35,2687,4.648421052631579
4069758,4,B0034JKZ8G,"As a twenty plus year old, I have to say it  was nice to reminsince about old Disney films, particularly the ones I have grown up with Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and of course the Lion King. All of these movies told a beautiful story with interesting characters and villians.
  The Princess and the Frog is a wonderful trip back to Disney's traditional animation, but I have to say it definitely was not what I expected, it was better. The plot at times seemed a little rushed, but it was still refreshing to see something old in our computer digital age.
  Tiana spent most of her time as a frog,:(, but the story still held many positive themes nevertheless, one of my favorite saying nothing is worthwhile if there is no love sort of faith without works is dead. It is definitely worth the full ticket price.",1265500800,3,814,4.472972972972973
4069759,1,B0034JKZ8G,"I had high hopes for this movie, as it has really bothered me that Disney has not had an African-American princess -- it's positively shameful -- and I was excited about the hand-drawn nature of the movie. I also thought the music was going to be wonderful as the film is set in New Orleans.

Well, what a disappointment. I was hoping for a spoonful of magical Disney sugar on par with ""Beauty and the Beast"" or ""The Little Mermaid"". What I got was a dried-up packet of NutraSweet.

Meticulous animation cannot save a cold story with no emotion or soul. As other posters have remarked, the writing for this film is on par with a Saturday morning cartoon. There's no flash, dash, or cleverness; no laugh-out-loud moments or times you want to cry. It's all been done before, and better ... the movie is full of worn-out cliches.

There's no plot to speak of, just aimless wondering around. Where is the excitement of mise-en-sc&egrave;ne and personalities we felt in the bayou of ""The Rescuers""? The animation is Hallmark-card perfect (too perfect), and the characters are boring, underdeveloped, and goody-goody. Dr. Facilier, the character everyone says is so thrilling, overacts so badly I felt like I was watching an avatar in a cheap video game. The director should have told him to add some nuance. Poor Tiana is a cardboard cutout on par with a character you'd find on a box of cereal. Where is the soul we saw in Belle, Arial, and even Meg from ""Hercules""?

The story itself is full of holes that you could drive Cinderella's carriage through -- for example, at the end of the movie, a major plot point revolves around someone inexplicably failing to kiss a frog before a clock chimes -- it makes no sense. She had the frog right in her hand -- huh? And the clock -- come on. You can never top the clock in ""Cinderella"", so why in the world make a half-baked attempt to even try?

I am disturbed that we do not see much of Tiana as Tiana. It is nonsensical that she is a frog for most of the movie -- I have my suspicions that Disney was afraid that having an African-American face on the screen was just too daring, so they made her into a frog for almost the whole movie. Someone pinch me, is it 2010 or 1810? This character and the little girls who came to see her deserved better.

The music ... don't get me started. Where were the big hits that we heard in movies like ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""Sleeping Beauty""? Why couldn't they give us magnificent music like in ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame""? Is this pap the best the very highly-paid Disney people could command? I could write better songs beeping the buttons on my cell phone.

This movie is not only soulless, it's a crying shame. This is not what Disney is all about. If only the Blue Fairy could swoop down and wave her magic wand and give this cartoon a soul. She brought Pinocchio to life but she would not be able to do a thing with this dud.",1265414400,47,2915,4.437383177570093
4069760,4,B0034JKZ8G,"I don't understand why people complain about the lack of good family fair and then shy away from going to see ""The Princess and the Frog"", the new traditionally animated film from Disney. This is a good film and the lack of business it is creating may cause Disney to rethink their current change in course.

A few years ago, John Lasseter, the force behind all of the Pixar hits, was promoted to oversee many different aspects of Disney. He did something I don't think a lot of people expected. He restarted production of traditionally animated, hand drawn feature films, a type of filmmaking all but abandoned (due to cost; computer animation is a lot cheaper) at a studio now making digital animation. He hired the team behind ""The Little Mermaid"" and they chose to make ""The Princess and the Frog"", the first Disney film featuring an African American heroine.

New Orleans, the 20s. Tiana (Anika Nani Rose, ""Dreamgirls"", ""The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency"") is a practical girl. As a child, she accompanies her mom (Oprah Winfrey) when she goes to Big Daddy's House (John Goodman) to make a dress for his daughter, Charlotte. Tiana and Charlotte are best friends and listen enraptured as Tiana's mom tells them the story of ""The Frog Prince"". Charlotte immediately announces she will kiss every frog and find her prince, but Tiana can't stomach the thought of kissing a frog. Tiana also shares her hard working dad's (Terrence Howard) dream of opening a restaurant. Flash forward ten years and we rejoin Tiana as she works multiple jobs trying to save enough money to open her first restaurant. She wants to keep her dad's dream alive and has found a spot she knows will be perfect, an abandoned waterfront warehouse. Prince Naveen (Bruno Campos, lots of parts on TV shows), the prince of Moldavia, arrives in town with his aide, Lawrence. Naveen wants to play jazz and has all but given up his ties to the throne of his country. A witch doctor, Dr. Facilier (Keith David) spots an opportunity. If he gets Charlotte to marry a fake Prince Naveen, he can take over Big Daddy's fortune. But first, he has to turn the prince into a frog and find a replacement to play Prince Naveen. Charlotte hears of the prince's arrival and gets her dad to throw a costume ball during Mardi Gras. Big Daddy is only too happy to oblige for two reasons; he has been chosen the King of Mardi Gras again and anything his Charlotte wants, she gets. Throw in Louis, an alligator who also wants to play jazz and Ray, a wise Cajun firefly and everything starts to get complicated.

Written and directed by Ron Clements and John Musker, the team behind ""The Little Mermaid"", ""The Princess and the Frog"" bnngs the same sort of magic and beauty back to the silver screen.

There are a lot of things to like and celebrate about ""The Princess and the Frog"".  The animation style seems almost romantic, in a way, perhaps because it has been so long since we have seen this type of animation used to any great extent. It also allows the film to look softer, almost as though it is glowing, which helps evoke the rose colored portrait of New Orleans the film puts forth. Everything about the film helps to give a romanticized vision of the great city and it is nice to see this celebrated.

One of the best and most consistent things about Disney animation is the music. In a time when there were virtually no other musicals being created, Disney Animated features continued the legacy, allowing some of the best and brightest performers, composers and writers to work, to continue their craft. In the last few years, live action musicals have started to enjoy a small renaissance at a time when animated features began to cycle away from using music. In ""Princess"", each song seems to celebrate a different kind of music which is fitting and a great idea as New Orleans is also a melting pot of music. In this way, the filmmakers celebrate and pay tribute to all of the different musical influences of this city, zydeco, ragtime, jazz, Cajun and more.

The characters are all funny, memorable and interesting. A few years ago, someone in the Disney Marketing Machine came up with the idea of marketing all of the ""Princesses"" from the different films plastering their pictures on every conceivable piece of merchandise. Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Jasmine, Belle, Snow White and the Little Mermaid are extremely popular so putting them all together is an even bigger draw for the millions of little girls who snap up their merchandise. So, any new animated film with a Princess is going to be considered a boon to the ongoing marketing machine that is Disney. Add Tiana to the group and everything can be redesigned, remade and resold. But Tiana is also the first African-American princess providing even more attractive marketing possibilities. She is a great marketing tool. When you become a fan of Disney, you quickly realize that everything in the kingdom is about marketing: if a film is a success, the characters go on to live in television, theme park rides & attractions, video games, clothing, DVDs, costumes and so much more. When you realize this, you can quickly move on and allow the films to create memories and magic. And Tiana is a very good addition to the Disney family.

Tiana is head strong, independent, goal-oriented and very busy. From her early days, listening to her dad talk about his dreams of opening a restaurant, she quickly adopted the same dreams. Now that he has gone on, she continues to press forward, working two jobs, saving every penny for a down payment. Only when the two men who promised to sell her an abandoned warehouse for her restaurant threaten to pull out, does she become desperate and start to look for some more money. Early on, Tiana brings her mom to the space and they sing a song about what the restaurant will become. Throughout this number, there are references to the sacrifices the young woman has made and it becomes a celebration but also a poignant illustration of this character's strong will.

Anika Nani Rose is very good as the voice of Tiana, giving her a lot of energy, a lot of pluck and a lot of intelligence. When Tiana meets the Frog Prince at Charlotte's house, she is reluctant to believe the talking frog, but her need for financial help gives her the little push she needs. She reluctantly bends down to give him a smooch

Bruno Campos is good as Naveen, providing a soft accent for his character. But he is unremarkable. So many others could have done the role, his performance isn't distinctive enough.

Keith David is fantastic as the voice of Dr. Facilier, the witch doctor who hatches a plan to steal Big Daddy's fortune. His big musical number helps to illustrate his connection to the dark arts of voodoo. His character brings to mind some of the elements of Jafar from ""Aladdin"" and his number brings back memories of Oogie Boogie in ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"".

As ""Frog"" is a Disney animated film, there are talking animals. When Naveen is turned into a frog, he talks and Tiana understands him. Later, they meet Louis, an alligator who just wants to play music for people. Voiced by Michael Leon-Wooley, the character is funny and fun to watch, especially every time he tries to sneak into a jazz band and begin to play, trying to remain unnoticed.

Ray, a Cajun firefly, has been dubbed the Cajun Jiminy Cricket. I guess there is a little truth to that. Ray is the guide for Tiana, Naveen and Louis, helping them navigate their way out of the swamp and back to New Orleans. Voiced by Jim Cummings, Ray is funny and touching.

While in the swamp, the team decides to try to get Mama Odie to help them. Odie is a Cajun woman who lives in the heart of the Bayou with her pet python and is basically the good counterpart to Doctor Facilier. Voiced by Jennifer Lewis (the original ""Dreamgirls""), she provides a couple of funny moments and even some sage advice.

John Goodman is also very good as Big Daddy. A New Orleans native, he clearly understands and has met people similar to Big Daddy.

I am only touching the barebones of the story. There are a number of twists and turns that should even keep the adults entertained. In fact, it might be a little too complicated for most kids. And because there is a lot of story, it seems slightly rushed at times, like they are trying to get too much story into a running time of 100 minutes.

But these are small complaints for a film that is this much fun to watch, to listen to, to experience.",1264982400,118,8505,4.651797603195739
4069761,5,B0034JKZ8G,"Disney has done it once again. I absolutely love this movie. The characters, the atmosphere, and the music were just fantastic.

Bravo Disney for making another classic that will be enjoyed for many years to come. I will definitely pre-order this movie and add it to my blu-ray collection.",1264982400,4,409,4.694444444444445
4069762,5,B0034JKZ8G,"After the ""Third Golden Age"" of Disney Animation ended a decade ago with ""Tarzan"" and then with the ""end of hand drawn animation"" with ""Home on the Range,"" many thought Disney had abandoned the medium that it basically created and built up.  Then came a number of things that lead to this film: Michael Eisner was fired, Disney acquired Pixar and Pixar lead man John Lasiter was put in charge of Pixar AND Disney animation.  The best move that could have been made.

The result ultimately was this film, Disney's return to hand drawn animation, the way Walt did it.  But, it wasn't just a return to classic animation, but also to good old fashioned Disney-style story telling, complete with Princess, Prince, evil villain, cute side kicks and show stopping songs you'll never get out of your head!

Best part about this film was that Disney updated their message and it works.  From now on, wishing on a start alone will not be enough, you have to work hard to achieve your dreams.  But, you do still need to wish, you can't just leave it to work alone.  It's a hand in hand kind of thing, you need both.  A VERY positive message to children today.

As for the Blu-Ray or DVD, both seem rather skimpy on extras.  Clearly the DVD is skimpy because Disney wants people to buy Blu-Ray (which is ridicules in my estimation), however the Blu-Ray could have had more to it itself.  I predict a double dip later on down the line with this title, which sadly is also a classic Disney tradition.

But extras aside, if you enjoy classic Disney animation, this film is for you!  If you enjoy good movies you can watch with or without your family, this film is for you!  I highly recommend it!",1264896000,10,1681,4.5016501650165015
4069763,5,B0034JKZ8G,"This is a beautiful movie that harkens back to all of the wonderful things we expect to see in a classical Disney movie.  It is artistic, creative, the music is beautiful, and everything is well done.

Good things to focus on:
  The overarching theme in this movie is the importance of having a balanced life.  The heroine believes hard work is important and can make dreams happen.  But she also learns that we can't be consumed by work.  We have to have margins in our life for family and fun.
  The prince learns that an excess of fun with no hard work results in limited options in life, a lack of purpose, and even loneliness.
  There are a few implied lessons as well.  We see the importance of treating all people kindly and respectfully as a minor villain works against the prince in retaliation for being mistreated.  Also, other characters are sometimes careless in how they treat their neighbors and friends.  We also see an example in the importance of helping others as the bayou animals work together to help the heroine and the prince.  The prince also learns that he should be wiser in choosing who he trusts, as he is pathetically duped by the villain, even though he was warned by his companion.

Things parents might want to know about:
  There is definitely a dark element in this movie with the `voodoo'.  I do not personally know much about it, but the villain uses tarot cards and talks to and makes deals with spirits.  It might be kind of scary for very young kids.
  The villain does kill one of the lovable supporting characters.
  The outfits many of the girls in the movie wear leave little to the imagination.  Even compared to The Little Mermaid, I think this movie has more cleavage and tight fitting outfits than any other Disney cartoon I've seen.  Some things are drawn very realistically.  At one point a bouncy female character (and I mean `bouncy') takes up most of the screen to quite vigorously adjust her bosom.",1264896000,3,1952,4.598837209302325

4069765,2,B0034JKZ8G,"This laudable attempt by Disney to return to the days of 2-D animated glory sadly falls short. Instead of surrounding its newest character - the first black Disney ""princess"" (which is rather deceptive, since Tiana is not a princess at all) with fresh new ideas, characters and music, Disney chose to use the hoary old schticks and gimmicks it's used in the past. The ""I want"" song - check. Prince - check. Talking animals - check. Funny sidekicks - check. Musical numbers - check. A dash of tragedy to give the the script some heft - check. Charismatic villain - check. Yep, all the stock Disney characters and plot points are abundant in this film, but the result is less than satisfying. Tiana herself is a charmer - when she's human - but once she becomes kin to Kermit, she becomes bland and humorless, perhaps to avoid upstaging her equally bland and unlikable Frog Prince Naveen. Granted, he's self-centered enough to generate more personality than many Disney animated leading men, but when it comes to warmth and appeal, he's no Aladdin. Even worse, the sidekick and ancillary characters are hardly memorable: a Baloo-wannabe oafish alligator, a spoiled Southern belle, a feckless firefly and an old hag who likes to kiss her pet snake on the mouth. Ecchhh. The music is subpar, with only one song that stands out: ""Almost There"", a decent addition to the Disney catalogue of ""I Want"" songs, but which pales in comparison to similar songs from Disney's past anthems of ambition, such as ""I Just Can't Wait To Be King"" (The Lion King) or even ""Someday My Prince Will Come"" (Snow White). All in all, ""Princess and the Frog"" (worst Disney movie title ever) is not a bad film, but it's far from being a Disney classic. I'd rank it in the same class as ""The Lion King 1 1/2"" or ""Cinderella 2"", both of which were decent efforts, but not worthy of inclusion to the roster of Disney-dusted classics such as ""Pinocchio"". 2 stars.",1264636800,19,1930,4.696165191740413
4069766,4,B0034JKZ8G,First let me say i'm not anti-3D animation or Hannah Montana but in recent years Disney has been lacking major quality in their movies and programs although UP and The Incredibles are some exceptions I just don't think movie's like Meet The Robinsons or Hannah Montana The Movie are gonna stand the test of time like Lion King Or Beauty And The Beast not that their terrible movies well maybe the latter of those is But they just don't have the creativity or imagination that the movies i grew up watching had most of what kids watch today is garbage. NOW to the Princess and The Frog i loved this movie it was so much fun it has a lot of great characters my favorite is Ray a cajun firefly and Louis a trumpet playing alligator Most of songs were catchy and had a great jazzy flavor to them this is probably one of the better Disney musicals I think Randy Newman did a great job Alan Menken Who? Tiana is a very independent princess she doesn't need any prince charming to save her and shes a very hard worker probably to hard And the prince Naveen is the polar opposite he's a lazy playboy who just want's to have fun Dr. Facilcer is the bad guy in the movie and i didn't really think of him as a villain until near the end of the movie If you saw it you KNOW what i'm talking about I was in the theater and i was like OH HELL NO!!But i want spoil anything There are a few more characters i like Tiana's best friend Charlotte Or as tiana calls her Lotte and Mama Odie who's sorta like a fairy godmother but not I thought Charlotte deserved more screen time her and Louis were very funny The animation in this movie is amazing i was mesmerized a couple times during the movie especially during Dr Facilers performance of Friends On The Other Side it was just beautiful the whole movie was The people who hand draw these movie are true artist. Now to rap this up i'll say that PATF is a very good movie i've already pre-orded it However it's not on the same level as the Lion King or Beauty and the Beast but it's really close It's a step in the right direction for 2D movies to comeback and if Disney continues to make 2d movies like this one there shouldn't be any reason for them to disappear again  i'm looking forward to seeing more great movies like this one from Disney.,1264636800,4,2277,4.246543778801843
4069767,5,B0034JKZ8G,"My daughter is almost 3 years old and has seen just about every other Disney cartoon movie out there.  She LOVES them!  The music engages her, the stories are daring, romantic, educating...  We went to go see The Princess and The Frog in theaters when it came out and she simply loved it!  We were both dancing to the music, laughing at the ""silly froggy"", and worried when the shadows were chasing them.  The emotion and story-line was so realistic that I was near tears several times during the movie, and dancing in my seat at other times.  The shadow scene was probably a little frightening for my daughter, but she knows that it is only a movie and was only worried that someone might get hurt.

Some have criticized the story for not being very original or exciting. I disagree. It's a Fairy Tale, and Fairy Tales have to adhere to certain basic elements; however, I thought the filmmakers devised some wonderful twists on the formula. The characters are genuine and appealing. I was sort of surprised at how fond of them I'd grown by the end of the film -- unlike, say, the obnoxious characters in ""Monsters vs Aliens."" One of the strengths of ""Princess and the Frog"" is how unpretentious the story is. They weren't trying to create an epic like ""Lion King"", or hammer home some social message. It was simply a fun, sweet story that had me leaving the theatre with a smile on my face and a song in my heart. Kudos all around!

But at the recommendation of some friends that boys will like it too I took him to the matinee. Well, he didn't like it because it was too scary. I haven't seen a Disney film in decades, and I was actually quite surprised at the dark references and shadowy figures all throughout the film. The forces of good and evil are replete throughout the film, and I thought surely there must be some better way to get the point across than to put voodoo and dark references in a Disney princess film. I absolutely loved the beginning, with the scenes from Tiana's family and her wonderful father. It was actually quite realistic, that contrary to popular belief there are many good black men out there who are wonderful fathers like that. So I enjoyed the film, but it didn't do anything for my son except scare him. We'll be sticking with Thomas the Train, Sid the Science Kid, Dinosaur Train and the other great programming that comes on PBS.

4069770,5,B0034JKZ8G,"From my wife Sarah: Here's a review with an adult perspective. Having seen just about every movie playing in theaters, my girlfriend and I decided to catch this movie. It was very charming, full of laughs, and plenty of cuteness. I think that other adults will enjoy this film.

There was plenty of laugh out loud humor in the story, and ultimately a very uplifting message about how important it is to work hard for your dreams, but to balance your life, putting love above everything.

The music was beautifully composed, and Anika Noni Rose has the voice of an angel. When she sings, you feel all the emotion that goes with it, and her voice is so special. It's worth seeing this movie just for the music alone. Another show stopper was the song sung by a Cajun firebug named Ray. It was really lovely. I think some of these songs will become classics.

The animation was often so beautiful that many a time I wished I could buy the film cells to put the still images on our walls. There were also times when the animation became flat and much less interesting. I'm not sure why they did this, but I'm sure most people won't notice it.

The movie reflected the culture of New Orleans from the architecture to the food. This was certainly a new twist, and something I've never seen in an animated movie.

One thing that people should know is that there's a lot of voodoo used in the story line. Not only was the evil character using voodoo, but the ""fairy god mother equivelent"" character was a voodoo high priestess who used voodoo to put things right. I personally wasn't thrilled with this. There are also demonic characters that the very sensitive might find scary.",1263427200,2,1671,4.538205980066445

Liked that the herione is not helpless and is a strong woman and sure of herself. Although the nine year old was a little afraid of the voodoo plotline,and my boyfriend thought the singing was annoying.",1263340800,3,464,4.535714285714286
4069772,4,B0034JKZ8G,"Though I've skipped most of Disney's animated features post-POCAHONTAS, I'm always glad to see traditional animation stay alive, and given the pedigree of the filmmakers involved in this one - and the fact that Disney dropped traditional animation for several years - I felt I needed to get out and see this in the theater, just hoping that it would deserve my support.  It did - and it deserves yours too, I think.

THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG is probably my favorite since BEAUTY AND THE BEAST - though I have to mention that the period since then hasn't been my favorite in the Disney canon - call me a traditionalist who thinks that PINOCCHIO still reigns supreme.  And THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG I don't think achieves any real greatness - but it also doesn't have many of the problems that to me make many of the studio's more recent efforts just ""kidstuff"".  This is an attempt I think to really get back to the ""all ages"" approach and reel in some adults, and for me it worked.  None of the songs (mostly by Randy Newman, who also wrote the instrumental music) were outright bad, smarmily cutesy or overly mushy - though I have to say none were extremely memorable either.  They don't go overboard with celebrity casting (John Goodman and Oprah Winfrey do secondary roles) and the voicework overall is excellent.  The animation is never slipshod, never looks like shortcuts were taken, and the storyline makes sense more or less and moves along well.  Much of the credit belongs, I think, to directors Ron Clement and John Musker - responsible for THE LITTLE MERMAID and ALADDIN among others - two filmmakers who really do know how to tell a story and not waste a huge amount of time on too many side bits.

The main problem that the film has is that it isn't really all that compelling. The villain, a voodoo practitioner called ""The Shadow Man"" is just never very scary or exciting - he's more humorous and sly than actually nasty.  The film never goes into the scary and intense areas that THE LITTLE MERMAID or BEAUTY AND THE BEAST went to - which made the heroine's eventual triumph much more exciting.  And the main character, Tiana, who dreams of opening her own restaurant only to become a frog and have to struggle to reclaim her humanity along with the snotty frog-prince whose kiss turned her amphibian, is obviously destined for love - yet again, Disney gives us a girl whose heart's desire is always, deep down, love rather than career.  Sigh, I suppose it's too much to ask for anything else?  But the film does to its credit work out the traditional Disney princess ending and a more modern approach simultaneously, so kudos for that.

On the other hand the leading man, Naveen, is pretty well-developed and complex for a Disney prince, and his moral transformation in the film really works pretty well.  The typical cutesy supporting characters (a blues-playing gator and a cajun firefly) are reasonably amusing and there was only one really cloying moment near the end involving a new star in the heavens - I won't go into detail and spoil that for you.  The much-heralded racial element - Tiana and the prince are both dark-skinned in case you hadn't heard - is barely touched on, not surprisingly.  I think there's one line that can be taken to be about skin color, and it's played subtly.  On the whole it's lively, energetic, has a better worked-out romance than most Disney films - it just lacked something to really catapult it into the upper echelons.  Maybe they were just playing too safe.",1263168000,2,3520,4.6575121163166395

This was one I had to see in theaters as opposed to waiting to see it in my dvd collections.  I can tell you after just seeing it I have not been dissappointed.  It lived up to my expectations, jazz music and all.  Can't say I predicted the ending with any accuracy.  But well worth seeing if you are a kid, or an adult that still watches cartoons as much as I do.  No spoilers here.",1262217600,,490,3.85
4069774,5,B0034JKZ8G,"I remember reading a while back that Disney intended to cease making hand-drawn animated films.  With the great successes enjoyed by its Pixar-partnered films, such as ""Cars"", ""Finding Nemo"", etc., the company apparently felt it was no longer necessary to devote the time and work to producing hand-drawn animation.  I was sincerely upset by this news.  I'll never forget what was, to me, the golden age of Disney, with the slew of wonderful and beautiful hand-drawn films it released in the 90s.  I really enjoy the Pixar films, but I didn't want to see the death of the hand-drawn animated feature as an art form.  And make no mistake, it is an art form, and one at which Disney really excels when they do it right.  They really do it right with this film.

From the moment the film began, I had that same feeling I had when I watched my 90s favorites, such as ""Beauty and the Beast"".  The films done with computer animation are technical marvels, but there is something so special about watching the evolution of characters and scenes drawn painstakingly by hand.  Disney more or less invented this medium, and I hope to see them continue to master it.  I could say so much about the sheer beauty of this film.  Some scenes are awash with colors, as when Naveen and Tiana are literally taken out on a limb by Mama Odie.  I was also in awe of the stately New Orleans homes in Charlotte's neighborhood.  How can anyone watch something like this and not appreciate the sheer artistic talent required to make something so lovely?

The appeal of the film certainly doesn't end with the visuals.  Though it's admittedly a sanitized version of what real world New Orleans would have been like during the era, the film has a very lovely story.  Charlotte and Tiana are genuinely friends, despite the class and racial differences between them.  Big Daddy may be obscenely rich and fond of frittering away his money on frilly princess dresses for his daughter, but he's also a sincerely nice man who shares his wealth with others and treats Tiana and her mother not like servants, but like valued employees.  The animal sidekicks aren't silly and cloyingly sweet, but genuinely interesting with amusing and sweet backstories.  It's hard not to laugh when we get to witness poor Louis's attempts to play jazz with the ""big boys"".

As for the main characters, I really loved them.  Tiana is lovely both inside and out.  Though most of us would perhaps wish our children to be a bit less of a workaholic than she is, I admired her hard working attitude, her determination to see her dreams through to their fulfillment, and her independence.  She is a very, very welcome addition to the Disney princess line as, let's face it, not all of those princesses are the kinds of girls most mothers would want their daughters to be.  Tiana is smart, sweet, comes from a beautiful family, and has an excellent moral compass.

I thought that Naveen was probably the most interesting of the princes, many of whom are little more than a presence on film.  Though the Beast certainly had a personality and a backstory of his own, I think Naveen may have been even more developed.  He's a bit of a stereotypical royal playboy, but that's also actually kind of an interesting change for Disney, where the princes tend to be a bit bland.  Mostly, they just exist to rescue the heroine from her situation.  Tiana doesn't need rescuing, but she would benefit from the help of a loving mate.  It's interesting to see Naveen grow up and learn about taking responsibility.

Maybe some viewers will think the film is a bit too pat, but I don't think so.  Yes, things do work out magnificently for the good characters and terribly for the bad, but, to me, that's not a negative thing.  Wouldn't it be nice if that's the way it really worked in the real world?  I loved the film's message about the importance of genuine love, family, and friendship over material goods.  I loved the idea that the two leads could come to understand that the things they thought most important in their lives could actually be considered trivial in the grand scheme of things.  I truly enjoyed this film and hope that Disney will continue to produce more gems like it.  Sure, the Pixar films are marvelous, but there's definitely plenty or room for good old hand-drawn films as well.",1262131200,12,4332,4.660079051383399
4069775,5,B0034JKZ8G,"My rating?  This was the most enjoyable movie of 2009 and - make no mistake - it was an excellent year in film.  First of all I totally enjoyed the soundtrack.  It has exciting tunes such as ""Friends on the Other Side"" but also dreamy music such as ""My Belle Evangaline"" and lots of good ol' time music influenced by Cajun folksongs, New Orleans jazz, and even gospel.  Then again, the animation is very creative. Even the main characters are more charming in their frog form than as adults.

Last but not least, the message of the film is so positive.  Others have talked about the importance of an African American heroine. But more than that, we have someone who does more than ""Snow White"" and merely prays for her dream to come true.  Tiana has to work hard for it.  That's a lot more realistic.

Adults who are used to the classic Disney films should be entranced by the film. And children need to experience the old Disney magic without CG enhancement.  There was hardly a moment I was not delighted in the theatre.  Since other reviewers have talked about the plot,  I will not repeat their comments here.  But who could resist the
strange voodoo magic of Mr. Facilier? Indeed.",1262131200,2,1185,4.533018867924528
4069776,5,B0034JKZ8G,"After movies like Bolt, and sitcom ""gold (rolls eyes)"" like Hannah Monterrible, Wizards, and the Jo Bros, I had almost lost hope for Disney. But now there is hope, and this movie is proof of it! The Princess and the Frog is awesome!

The Story: The story is a very good twist on the fairy tale ""The Frog Prince"". The story is about a waitress named Tiana who is a workaholic trying to raise money to open a restaraunt, a dream of her father's that never happened. But at a costume ball, she finds out that someone else placed a bid on the restaraunt and she has until the following day to outbid him. Desperate, she wishes on a star for a miracle....and meets Prince Naveen who was turned into a frog by the villian Dr. Faciller. When he offers money if she kisses him, Tiana kisses him and gets turned into a frog herself. Together, they travel through the bayou in order to break the spell. The story is great, and the character's development through the story is nice and smooth. It's a great musical love story that is just as great as Beauty and the Beast (my favorite Disney movie). There are also great morals. This story never got boring or slow and while it wasn't LOL, it did make me laugh at parts.

The Characters: All the characters were either good or great, none were annoying. But I want to talk about two: Ray and Louis. Ray is the hillbilly like firefly. Now, I thought I was going to be annoyed by this character, especially when in the trailers, he says ""Don't make me light my butt!"" and ""Just follow the bouncing butt!"". I thought, great! Another Mater (Cars, Pixar). But I was wrong. Ray is a sweet character, not just a silly sidekick that is there to entertain the kiddies and make problems for the characters. He even helps the two main characters fall in love. Remember the ballroom scene from BatB? Well there's a scene similar to this where Ray sings ""Ma Belle Evangelline"" while Naveen and Tiana dance. This scene is beautifully done, and Ray's song is beautifully sung. Ray is definitely a character you will grow to love.

The other character I want to talk about is Louis the alligator. I also thought he would be annoying. He wasn't annoying, but he did seem kind of unneeded. He didn't really do much throughout the film. However, his trumpet solos were beautiful. Louis is a good character, but I think the film could have done without him.

The Animation: Yes! The 2D animation is back! The animation is beautiful, and you know that someone actually drew it, not just doing it on a computer. The 2D animation adds just a little bit more magic to it all, and it is fantastic!

The Music: Oh my god, finally some real Disney music, not just HM or the Jo Bros singing! I've seen all the Disney animated musicals, and this is just another great one. The music will get stuck in your head, but you won't care because it is just so great! I got the soundtrack for Christmas, and I listen to it almost everyday.

The Cons: Everything in this movie was awesome, however I was surprised at how dark it was. There was witchcraft, voodoo, and a graveyard scene that could really freak little kids out. I was sitting in a theater with the sound system turned up, and there were times where I felt just a tiny bit scared. Parents with little kids should make sure they can handle it. But my little 7 year old cousin watched this, and she loved it. The ""scary"" scenes didn't really bother her. It just depends on if you think your kids can handle it.

Overall: This movie was great! I loved it, and I hope the future Disney movies are like this. The future looks bright people!",1261958400,2,3600,4.429003021148036

4069778,4,B0034JKZ8G,"""The Princess and the Frog""
(Walt Disney, 2009)
----------------------------------------
We went to go see this as a family -- Mom, Dad and Disney-addicted little girl -- and we all thought it was pretty good.  The messages of hard work and honesty (and a de-emphasis on magical thinking) were all welcome.  The music was good: ragtime and trad jazz are a breath of fresh air after the cascade of bad pop-soul that have dominated the kiddie movies of the last few decades, and the gal who plays Princess Tiana is a very good singer, Broadway trained and not another dreadful Whitney/Celine/Beyonce soul melissima showboater leaping from note to note without bringing meaning to the words... Thank goodness!  This was actually good music!  Yay.

I do have to say, though, that if Disney was going to make such a big deal about Tiana being their first African-American princess, it might have been nice if they'd given her more than ten minutes on-screen time as an African-American woman, rather than as a green-skinned frog.  The big twist of the story -- having the frog-kiss turn the heroine into an amphibian -- is clever and funny, but still, having her dark-skinned face disappear from the screen so quickly and so thoroughly was a little weird, especially with all the stereotyped voodoo stuff on top of that.  Couldn't they have had their first black princess turn up in, say, Atlanta, or New York?  Or Kenya? Without the bone-shaking hoodoo?  Disney is to be applauded for breaking their own racial barrier, but it still seems a little uneven, in relation to the well-marketed white faces in all the other movies.

Regardless, this was a good movie, another mildly scary but overall un-gun filled animated alternative for parents with little kids to latch on to while they still can.  And the music was fun, too. I wouldn't mind a sequel, with more of the human Tiana in it. (Axton)",1261785600,,1890,4.838509316770186

4069781,4,B0034JKZ8G,"Note: The following is a review of the movie (and not of the DVD - the review will be updated upon the DVD release in future):
My husband and I took our almost 5-year-old daughter to watch ""The Princess and the Frog"" this afternoon, and we all loved it! It was heartening to see Disney go back to old-school 2D animation which gave us some of the most memorable animated classics. As to whether ""The Princess and the Frog"" will become a classic remains to be seen, but it certainly is getting my vote. It's refreshing to finally see an African-American being the lead character in a Disney production (we had an Asian lead in ""Mulan"" and a Native American in ""Pocahontas"", so it's high time we had an African American in a leading role here). The way these characters are animated in this movie shows a great level of attention to detail, especially in depicting the facial features, the mannerisms, etc. The vibrant and throbbing culture of French Quarter New Orleans is gloriously depicted in a rainbow of colors that mesmerize and dazzle - the sights, sounds, food, etc.

Set in 1920s New Orleans, the story follows the adventures (well, misadventures really) of Tiana (voiced by the lovely Anika Noni Rose) who as a child learns to love cooking, nurtured by her own gifted father (Terrence Howard). Her father dies and Tiana is raised by her seamstress mother (Oprah Winfrey). She grows up into a lovely young lady, working two jobs to save money in pursuit of her dream of opening a restaurant, just as her late father had envisioned. To cut a long story short, Tiana finds herself transformed into a frog, when she kisses a frog (who is actually a Prince). Prince Naveen (Bruno Campos) is a victim of voodoo magic by the infamous and evil Shadowman, Dr. Facilier (Keith David), and together the pair undertake a desperate quest through the beautiful yet treacherous Louisiana Bayou, hoping to find something or someone that might change them back to their human forms. They are aided in their quest by a benign and musically gifted gator, Louis the jazz trumpeter (Micheal-Leon Wooley) and an aging Cajun firefly, Ray (Jim Cummings). There are plenty of twists and turns here to keep the adults entertained and enough visual eye candy to satisfy both the kids and adults. The songs (score is by Randy Newman) are catchy and entertaining, though I don't see them becoming real classics.

Tiana is a strong personality - determined, feisty, independent, and ambitious which is quite refreshing from some of the older Disney princesses that were more stereotypical in their characterizations. She makes a great role model for young girls. However, I did feel kind of let down when the story reverts to the traditional princess and prince live happily ever after formula, which seems staged for commercialization purposes (got to have that Disney princess doll, mom!). There are also some scenes which depict the more gruesome aspects of voodoo that might scare young children (black, almost demonic looking shadows menacing the innocent). Parents of the under-5s may want to take note of this. For this reason, I have taken one star off. But, on the whole, this is quite a breath of fresh air in the Disney princess stories, and hopefully signals more creative and unique stories (with equally unique and strong female leads) to follow.",1261180800,5,3339,4.856140350877193
4069782,4,B0034JKZ8G,"I think Disney is back in good form with THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG, but what it seems to lack is a a more frightening villain and a better quality of songs. The songs are catchy enough but quite forgettable without a single standout to match the musical numbers in BEAUTY AND THE BEAST or THE LITTLE MERMAID.

The backgrounds are superior with a good suggestion of New Orleans and the bayou in some gorgeous visuals. The fireflies are effectively used and all of the background art is exceptionally well done. But what the story lacks are characters to really care about and a stronger overall story.

Disney fans should enjoy it and I'm sure most of us prefer the hand-drawn aspect of Disney's best films rather than all this computer technology animation so lacking in visual values and imagination.

As usual, the voice work is excellent and there are some gags that really make you appreciate the humor injected into many scenes. Still, the lingering feeling is that a better script would have made the brilliant art work more worthwhile.",1261094400,5,1042,4.745856353591161
4069783,4,B0034JKZ8G,"I was very skeptical when I saw the trailers for this movie proclaiming that it was a 'new Disney classic'.  I grew up with the original classics and so I took it upon myself to judge this movie based on those expectations.  Here are those expectations I had when walking into the theater:

The old-school Disney musicals played a lot with the idea of a dark and gritty storyline.  Look at the Lion King for a perfect example.  The story contains death, manipulation and murder.  Many of the movies are like that, ranging from the 101 Dalmatians (not technically a musical, but just as gritty...who would want to hurt puppies?) to Beauty and the Beast, considered by many one of the best.  As part of those sad and depressing scenes seared into our brains, there was a lack of outright humor.

Now take a look at the spin offs and sequels of Disney that have popped up in recent years.  The Lion King 2, although slightly dark, contained a lot of slap-stick humor with characters leaping high in the air and constantly slamming into each other.  Yes the classic musicals had some of this, but the humor was more implied throughout story and situation rather than thrown in our faces like today's modern movies.

So where does this leave the 'Princess and the Frog'?  Quite honestly somewhere in the middle.  The beginning of the movie starts off quite well, with wonderful character development, a beautiful setting, and immediately likable characters such as Tiana, Navine and even the Shadowman in his own way.  Tiana's song is quite brilliant, showing a darker side of life while still keeping the spirit of hope.  The Shadowman's song, although not quite as devilish as 'Be Prepared' and 'Poor Unfortunate Souls', contains enough eye candy that we can overlook its faults.

The middle is unfortunately where the movie falls a little flat.  As I outlined  above the older Disney movies didn't rely so heavily on slap-stick comedy but still put in situational humor.  The escapades of Tiana and Navine are filled with comic reliefs and half-baked notions of 'dangerous escapes'.  The worst in my opinion has got to be the frog hunters who are so campy the audience never gets a clear sense of danger.

The ending thankfully pulls the movie up by its bootstraps and includes a darker twist with a very impressive final encounter with the villain.  I won't spoil anything, but I have to say that the Shadowman, although he may not be quite as powerful as previous Disney devils, definitely is one of the most interesting to look at during his final scene.

So why after slamming the movie quite a bit I say 4 stars? Had I based my review solely on my personal enjoyment I would give it 3, but only because I went into the theater clearly looking for a 'Disney classic'.  Whether 'The Princess and the Frog' achieved this goal remains to be said, only time will tell as that is the mark of a true classic.  For today the decision on whether or not to watch it can be based on this: the movie is enjoyable, contains some fantastic New Orleans-inspired music and nicely develops a sweet romantic story about dreams and what we as humans truly want/need in life.",1260921600,2,3158,4.6672694394213385

8388398,5,B0034JKZ8G,"I only recently watched this movie for the first time and I am impressed. I love that they went with the classic animation style insead of the newer Tangled or Frozen animation (although those are also good movies). It just added to the classic Disney princess theme to me. Although I'm not a child anymore, I still enjoy watching new Disney animations. I can honestly say I was excited to see that Disney had decided to broaden their horizens a bit here by having an African American princess. I love that they have other ethnicities in Pocahontas, Aladdin, and the newish Moana. I think it's great for children to have characters to look up to and connect with, someone they can see themselves as. Tiana has an amazing work ethic and is an incredibly strong woman. And all while showing that, Disney created catchy songs and a beautiful New Orleans world. One thing that is wildly important to me, really a make or break for a good film, is the villian. The Shadow Man exceeded my expectations, and his song is probably my favorite of all in the film. There are parts of this film that can be seen as stereotypical but I choose to chalk this up as a step in the right direction of adding more diversity.",1527033600,,1205,4.506849315068493
