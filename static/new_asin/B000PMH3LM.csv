8192562,5,B000PMH3LM,I can't imagine an easier way to understand this Great American Conflict than this basic course and lecture series from Professor Gallagher. He is now the number one authority on the Civil War. I could listen to him all day. These thirty minutes glimpses of 48 topics allow an even deeper understanding of our Bloodiest War. Should be on every Civil War buff shelf.,1352937600,,365,4.71875
8192563,5,B000PMH3LM,"Listen to an excellent professor, an acknowledged expert lecture on the Civil War.  This is an opportunity few of us have.  Even fewer, can have this professor waiting for us and lecturing whenever we find the time to attend.  Gary Gallagher has an excellent speaking voice, clear, easy to understand and listen to.  This is not a droning voice on a hot afternoon but an animated, interested person talking about a subject he loves.  The result is an enjoyable learning experience for the novice and experienced listener.  This is NOT an advanced course.  The twenty-six half hour lectures cover the Civil War from a social, political and military perspective.  This course works as an intermediate to advanced introduction or as a full review for the experienced student.  Our local round table purchased this set, we use it when no speaker is available and loan it to members.  Everyone is happy with the lectures and the selection of subjects.  This is a good solid mainstream history that takes no sides.",1255046400,7,1008,4.905325443786983
8192564,5,B000PMH3LM,"Professor Gary Gallagher teaches this Civil War course and makes all the nuances of the period understandable. You learn advantages and weakness of both sides, the impact of the war on people back home, and the way battles influenced politics in Washington.  Great series!",1196035200,5,272,5.181818181818182
