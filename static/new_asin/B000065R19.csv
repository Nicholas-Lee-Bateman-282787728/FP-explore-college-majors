Or at least bring it out for it's 25th anniversary cheaper. This was and still is a comedy gem and should not be missed",1524528000,,290,3.9322033898305087

Annie Potts steals the show. It didn't have any special features, but it should at least have some subtitles in case a deaf person would like to watch this title.",1398470400,,338,4.380952380952381
