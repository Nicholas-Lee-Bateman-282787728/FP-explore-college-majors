8162417,4,B000LNH8DI,"We were planning a first-time trip to Montreal, and I was surprised to find nothing available in the way of a travel shows at the video stores or the library. I was very happy with the ""Montreal"" DVD I ordered. It was intelligently written, and showed a number of the top tourist areas in Montreal (lots of emphasis food and eating). It was definitely an asset in planning the trip, and I was able to locate many of the places shown in the video when we visited. My only criticism is that it was too short - something like 28 minutes.",1181260800,5,534,4.297029702970297
