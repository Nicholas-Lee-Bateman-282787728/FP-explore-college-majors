4658952,1,B005DEUES6,"I bought this DVD based on the one review that it had and the fact that Sam Elliott is one of my favorite actors.

I did not like Aspen on any level.  The story is thin although the parts where Elliott shows his depth as a master manipulator is fun.  I found myself thinking that the producers got the green light for a mini after filiming started and put in edited cuts to fill the very loonngg space.

Slow, poorly written and woodenly acted.  The DVD though crisp shows that the master was not cleaned there is substantial dirt.  Skip it.",1322179200,16,541,4.306930693069307

4659101,5,B005DEUES6,"If I could, I would have given the part of this miniseries *before* the murder occurs 3.5 to 4 stars because although well done, I didn't enjoy it.  That part didn't have the flavor I expected based on other customer reviews.

*After* the murder, I give it a full 5 stars!  (Especially for the performances of Sam Elliott, Perry King, and Roger Davis.  Davis didn't have a large role, but one of his scenes near the end deserved an Emmy.)  The reviews describe Defense Attorney Tom Keating (Sam Elliott) as being the friend of Lee Phillips (Perry King) who believes he's innocent and works for years to prove it.  That's actually not the way I saw it.  The two men developed a rapport, but I'm not sure Keating would have called Phillips a ""friend"" and I'm not sure he was fully convinced that Phillips was innocent of the crime.

It seems to me that one of the most important character developments for Tom Keating was in learning (late) that it should have been much more important to him from the very beginning to know for certain whether his client was really innocent.  Keating was a brilliant defense attorney, but it seemed to be as much about ""winning the case and building his reputation"" as about ""serving justice.""  A wonderful, wonderful scene near the end is, I think, when Keating learns this lesson (though I very much liked his character throughout).

Anyway, for me the movie was pure brilliance and fascinating from the actual murder to the end.  Sam Elliott (who has long been one of my very favorite actors), Perry King (most of whose work I've never seen), and Roger Davis (wonderful in the old western series ""Alias Smith and Jones"") were all brilliant.  I also very much liked the character of Tom Keating's father.  This movie is very thought provoking, raising many issues that are every bit as valid in 2015.  It also managed to make me understand opposing points of view equally well, without making me feel confused about my own opinion.

The two things I really didn't like were the musical score which seemed at best bland and at worst downright inappropriate (for example, when two men are racing to outrun a huge avalanche that's bearing down on them, the music score remains very breezy and light and relaxed), and there was too time spent on footage of skiers enjoying the dry powdery snow Aspen is famous for (I'm sure the Aspen Tourism Industry loved it, but there was just too much of it).

I'll definitely be re-re-rewatching this, but probably will skip over most of the pre-murder part and then watch with rapt attention.",1440892800,3,2562,4.683035714285714

4659174,4,B005DEUES6,"If this 1977 three-part miniseries (1 and 2 on Disc #1, 3 on #2) had been filmed 10 years earlier, it might well have been framed as a Western, for the huge land deal that hovers in the background--and is a subtle influence on much that happens--could just as plausibly have been a ""grab"" in the 1870's or '80's.  In 1964, 18 years after the first lift was put in, the former mining boom town of Aspen, CO, has found new life as a skiing mecca for ""the beautiful people,"" or ""the Jet Set;"" drugs, which haven't yet invaded college campuses, and casual sex are their chief apres-ski amusements.  The older residents, descendants of the original ranchers and miners, aren't sure what to think of the newcomers, but they're smart enough to know that the money the skiers bring in is fast becoming the town's lifeblood.  Into this simmering stew comes Carl Osborne (Gene Barry), a billionaire land developer, with his daughter Gloria (Michelle Phillips), son John (Doug Heyes, Jr.), and plan for a vast recreational development to be called Wolf Run.  He immediately bumps heads with Owen Keating (John McIntire), a ranchowner and former sheriff (an office held by his father before him), whose land is right where Osborne wants to locate his ski runs, and whose 30-year-old son Tom (Sam Elliott) is an associate at the local branch of a prestigious Colorado law firm.  Following after the Osbornes comes Lee Bishop (Perry King), a 22-year-old tennis pro who met Gloria, and fell in love with her, at a Mexican resort, despite her father's attempts to discourage him; looking for a job, he hooks up with his old Army buddy, Budd Townsend (Bo Svenson), who gets him a job running lobsters, and probably drugs, in from Denver for Alex Budde [pronounced bute] (Tony Franciosa), a Mob-connected wheeler-dealer and local mover and shaker.  When Gloria stands him up on the night she'd promised to elope with him, Bishop gets drunk, and the next thing anyone is really sure of is that Angie Morelli (Deborah Richter), a 15-year-old nympho whom Bud considered ""his"" girl, is found raped and brutally murdered.  Though Lee maintains that the blood on his skin and clothing is the result of  spinning his motorcycle out on the icy roads, he finds himself up for trial, with Tom and his boss, the pretentious Joseph Merrill Drummond (John Houseman), as his court-appointed attorneys.  Tom doesn't know whether Lee is guilty or not, but he's indignant at the younger man's treatment--a 72-hour interrogation without food or clothing, no legal representation--and at the behavior of the trial judge (William Prince), who happens to be the father of his best friend (Roger Davis), and his own superior.  Soon he's drawn into the effort to overturn Lee's guilty verdict, a process that will take more than eight years and 11 appeals and by the way destroy Budde, Judge Kendrick, and the prosecuting attorney (George DiCenzo), as well as Wolf Run.  But just when victory appears within their grasp, they run up against the one barrier Tom never saw coming...

Elliott, at the center of everything, is worth buying the set just for himself: long-leggedly graceful, fiery-eyed, a true ""cowboy lawyer"" in his tall-crowned Stetson, fancy boots, bandanna ties, and hand-tooled briefcase, tough, clever, media-savvy, passionate for his cause, yet driven to cynicism by a youth of watching his hometown change over the years to something he doesn't like.  As his father, McIntire's part is small but telling; it's he who explains to Tom that sometimes you have to ""look wrong to do right.""  Perry King (who a few years later would play Cody Allen on the buddy-detective series ""Riptide"") is surprisingly effective as the railroaded youngster who proves to be (with clandestine coaching from Tom) a natural genius at managing his own appeals process and publicizing his story.  Franciosa makes a wonderfully believable former mobster, soft-spoken, well-groomed, smiling and glad-handing, but brought down by his own certainty that money will buy anything.  Still, anyone watching is sure to notice a couple of rather annoying threads left hanging (I won't spoil the story by telling you what they are), and that's why I give it only four stars instead of five.",1420416000,,4233,4.966053748231966

Watching it as a grown-up was quite different; however, I enjoyed every minute of it.  It brought back many wonderful memories of my mother and how she thought Sam Elliott was the hottest thing on this planet, lol!  I guess that is why I love Sam Elliott too...he is very easy on the eyes!

4659297,4,B005DEUES6,"I had never seen this mini series before. It was typical of the multipart minis of that time. Very entertaining, but tame by today's offerings",1361923200,,142,4.72
4659298,5,B005DEUES6,"This 1977 mini-series is one of my all-time favorites.  I got hooked on it in the early 1980's when it occasionally ran on Denver TV.  It ran on Starz cable around 1995.  Since then the show disappeared from the airwaves as far as I can tell.  Finally it's issued on DVD and I'm glad somebody in the corporate entertainment world made that call to do so.  It's a mini-series deserving of wider exposure.

""Aspen"" features a great performance by Sam Elliot as the cowboy-hatted, ambitious, publicity-seeking defense attorney Tom Keating.  The central part of the movie is his defense of Lee Bishop, framed for the rape and murder of a 15-year-old girl.  The heinous crime and its fallout seems to pull in the entire town of Aspen, including the press, the cops, the legal system, the Mob, an imperial wealthy resort developer, Hollywood stars, and plenty of corruption, family resentments, greed, sex, drugs, personal ambition and skiing to go around.  The changing morals of the late 1960's, The Vietnam War, the youth movement, the rise of environmental consciousness and the decreasing respect for older authority also figure in the background.  1960's and 1970's Aspen, Colorado is a perfect setting for this fictional tale, though as the movie points out, Aspen really does exist (along with its continued rep for greed, sex, drugs and great skiing). It's a nice reminiscence to see how the town looked then, compared to now.

Part of what makes this movie so good is the supporting cast, including one of my favorite actors -- John Houseman, who later won fame for his performance as the intimidating law Professor Charles Kingsfield in The Paper Chase movie and TV series.  In ""Aspen"", Houseman plays Joseph Drummond, a past-his-prime law firm partner and Keating's boss.  Also, there is Tony Franciosa as a mob-connected businessman.

Part I of the mini-series sets the background for this complex story, and it's kind of, well, sleazy TV.  But please get past that, because parts II and III shape up as a legal thriller that makes ""Aspen"" so very entertaining.  Elliot's portrayal of Keating is terrific as a defense attorney who wakes up to the gentlemanly corruption around him and finds a way beat it.  As you might expect (and without giving away any of the creative twists and turns of the plot) Keating winds up being the only guy who cares about Lee Bishop.  The ending is not a total win for everybody.  But it's worth 5 hours of watching to get there!

The video transfer to DVD is ok quality but not great.  Occasional dirt shows up, and I wonder if modern-day computer processing could have improved the color and sharpness somewhat.  Audio is mono.  The scene selection does not include chapter marking - once you get part the opening title sequences there are no further chapters, so you have to slowly fast forward if you want to revisit a favorite scene.",1361145600,,2877,4.826530612244898

4659319,5,B005DEUES6,"One of the most inspirational actors of the time Sam Elliot originally inspired my writing career, particularly the ""Sheriff Wyler Scott EBook Series"" with his movie series Aspen from 1977. I related to this, because at that time I was also getting into Alpine Snow Skiing which is the main industry that Aspen was and remains about to this very day. I felt that Sam Elliott would also make a great no nonsense sheriff too, but that's another story.

This story centers around a tough and eager attorney in town who saves a friend's life. Tom Keating is a very human and powerful character and one that Mr. Elliott easily fit into. I don't think they could have cast a more talented, nor perfect acting talent for this role. Of all the Sam Elliott movies I have watched, this was it. The story centers around a young man pursuing a wealthy woman whose father plans to develop Aspen into a resort in the year 1964. But not all goes well as the man soon is framed for a murder he didn't commit. Worse, Tom Keating's boss played by another great actor (John Houseman - Paper Chase) flubs up in court, do to his aging old arrogance, asks the wrong questions, ignores warning signs an astute attorney would have seen, resulting in a murder conviction for this innocent client, because of bad representation. The story really moves from here as Attorney Tom Keating (Elliott) continues for almost a decade gaining a stay of execution for his client. Eventually Tom's friend whose life he saved back-stabs him, but there is a poetic justice at the end.

The settings and atmosphere of this period of time that I grew up in the 60's shows a lot of a previous culture long gone, and also a part of the United States that at that time is rare in media formats too. It also touches on how western and remote cowboys changed with the time in Keating's daddy who owns a key piece of property that Franciosa wants as well as the mob from Chicago. So there is definitely a bit of the wild west or modern wild west tossed in. I found the story to be great back in 1977 when ABC TV aired it as their mini series. I have to admit I was glued back then and was this time as well. One disappointment I did experience with the DVD though was that in the lodge scene with the late great Tony Franciosa as a gangster and Elliott. They played the 1964 Motown hit Four Tops song ""Baby I Need Your Loving"" and in the DVD this was cut out for hippy folk music. There weren't many other issues but I did feel a bit shortchanged that this scene was different than what I remembered as that Four Tops tune was also a part of that era with the late Levi Stubbs and the gang. Other than that, it played as a great movie and it is something you will watch, long as it is, more than once for many, but not all folks. I hope this was informative, and thanks for reading. Now break out the pop corn, kick back for a nice mini series, a few logs in the fireplace and Sam Elliott as a tough mountain outdoorsy type. Who could ask for more :D

As a film, Aspen was a three night fest of murder and mayhem,  Tom Keating (Sam Elliot), an attorney who defense Lee Bishop (Perry King) for killing a 15 year old.

The pilot of this tele-film seems like well worn Perry Mason episides. Sorry Sam, You are NO Raymond Burr. Perry King seems to over play his role as Bishop.

AS a film is does seem over-long. However in the late 1970's, this is standard three night gig for a mini series. So  understand it was drawn out due to its format of what it was used for.

The trick about the mini-series of the 1970 and 1980s is the film is fill the show  with many guest appeances of familar stars in smaller roles. Aspen's guest cast includes such actors John (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Paper-Chase-Season-One/dp/B001O4KBMI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Paper Chase: Season One</a>) Houseman, Gene (&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Burke-s-Law-Season-1-Volume-1-First-16-Episodes/dp/B0013PVGGI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Burke's Law: Season 1 - Volume 1 (First 16 Episodes)</a>)Barry, Anothony Franciosa, Roger (Dark Shadows) Davis, Joseph Cotton, and  Bo (Dynasty) Hopkins,

This tele-film tranfer to DVD is not the cleanest master recording I have seen. So the TV film seem muddled and washed out in its trasmission onto DVD.

It is worth watching if you are a fan of legal thrillers or Sam Ellott. Otherwise miss this piece and  watch Perry Mason or Matlock.

4659327,1,B005DEUES6,"This video is a huge disappointment! I bought it because it stared Sam Elliot, and he is usually great.  This made for TV miniseries is very poor quality video and the acting stinks. Filmed at a lodge back in the 60's or early 70's; there is a lot of ""prior filmed footage"" much like the earlier war movies used official news video from WWI. I only got as far as about 20 minutes into the first disc and turned it off.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE.",1325203200,8,456,4.112359550561798
4659328,5,B005DEUES6,"Bought this DVD of ASPEN: with Sam Elliott, because I really like Sam. I was not disappointed. It was a very good movie. Everyone who has watched this movie really liked it.
The story is a good one. There is a murder of a young girl, the wrong man is accused of murdering her and sent to Prision on Death row. Sam takes over his defence and he doesn't disappoint you. Lots of twist and turns in the movie. You like Sam Elliott, you will like this movie, he is true to form. Wish I could find more like it. I would recommend this move to anyone.

An absolute abomination for what supposedly was made for entertainment.  Lame, comes to mind as does miscast, hokey, etc.

Nothing dramatic about this production as we found ourselves anticipating the obvious as the story unfolded.

We enjoy Sam Elliott, but this particular venture had us wondering what in the world possessed him to take on such a role? Money - yup, just that.

Bottom line: A soap opera that fails to lather.  Even the music seemed to be misfit for the gist of it all. Ugh.
