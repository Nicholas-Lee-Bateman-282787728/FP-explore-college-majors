4337560,5,B004EI2NWM,"""A Film Unfinished"" is a documentary of the Warsaw Ghetto in 1942 just prior to the Nazi's start of the ""resettlement"" of Jews from Warsaw to concentration camps and a ""better life.""  This documentary by Yael Hersonski, is composed of raw footage found untouched in an East German archive after World War II with a simple label ""Ghetto.""  ""A Film Unfinished"" is a powerful and moving historical account of how the Third Reich used staged scenes of Jews in Warsaw for propaganda purposes.  The film's narration describes how the scenes were orchestrated by the Nazis, using the threat of beatings to coerce Jews to look shameless (forced mixed-sex nude bathing), callous (passing bodies on the street uncaringly), licentious (filming Jews enjoying lavish meals while they were actually starving), and as though life was acceptable and pleasurable in the ghetto.

Who could be fooled by this deception?  Apparently many were because the Third Reich machinery was a master of propaganda and used many other edited films to vilify the Jew and hide the depravity they subjected them.

However, watch this film and look at the eyes of those being filmed.  It is there that this raw footage reveals the anguish and terror felt by those being told how to appear before the camera.  One can see the hopelessness as many of them stare at the cameras or off into an unknowable distance.

By including the multiple takes of many scenes from the raw footage, often with other Nazi cameramen inadvertently filmed, we can see the intentional deception being perpetrated.

Along with the narration the documentary has interspersed film clips of individuals who survived the Warsaw Ghetto of 1942.  As they watch the survivors give comments on the horror from their past and the film.  At times watching them is very painful.  But then, their presence in this documentary gives tribute and significance to those who faced the dreadfulness of Nazism against the Jews.

This film is not only for those interested in the Holocaust, this is a film all humanity should view to see how propaganda has been and still can be used by the media or governments to deceive and sway citizens opinions to fit one's own need.  Many of those on the film lost their lives latter at concentration and forced labor camps.  This documentary shows we should not have short memories when it comes to history.
I recommend this DVD; everyone should view it no matter how many stars it receives and decide for themselves.",1302220800,74,2479,4.908872901678657

4337562,5,B004EI2NWM,"""A Film Unfinished,"" a documentary by Yael Hersonski, features 60 minutes of raw film found undisturbed in an East German archive at the end of World War II.

Shot by the Nazis in Warsaw in May, 1942, and labeled simply as ""Ghetto,"" this footage became a resource for historians seeking an authentic record of the Warsaw Ghetto.  However, the later discovery of a long-missing reel, including multiple takes and cameramen staging scenes, complicated earlier interpretations of the footage.

""A Film Unfinished"" presents the raw footage in its entirety, carefully noting fictionalized sequences (including a staged dinner party) falsely showing ""the good life"" enjoyed by Jewish urbanites, and probing deep into the making of the infamous Nazi propaganda film.

Included are an interview with author/film researcher Adrian Wood and a study guide.",1299456000,56,845,5.427480916030534
4337563,5,B004EI2NWM,"I saw this documentary in the move theater, and I thought it was incredible. It is a must-see for anyone interested in the Holocaust.

In 1942, the Nazis began making a documentary film about life in the Warsaw Ghetto. They captured the sheer horror and misery of daily life in the ghetto. But they also staged scenes to make the Jews look venal, corrupt, decadent, and cold-hearted. The Nazis would round up people on the street and make them gorge themselves at lavish feasts while beggars looked on. The Nazis made pedestrians walk over/past corpses lying on the sidewalk. The Nazis staged scenes of vamps preparing for a night out and nude co-ed bathing. The Nazis arranged a carefully choreographed meeting of Jewish Council chairman Adam Czerniakow and orthodox rabbis. It was all filmed for their documentary. But Nazis also filmed multiple takes of staged scenes and unfiltered images of daily life in the ghetto as it really was.

""A Film Unfinished"" effectively shows the entire Nazi documentary as well as the outtakes. Moreover, the scenes from the Nazi documentary are juxtaposed with commentary from eyewitnesses who saw the filming or participated in it. They explain exactly what the Nazis were up to in staging and filming these scenes. As a result, the viewer sees still-shocking footage of life in the ghetto and gains insight into how the Nazis managed life in the ghetto to further degrade the Jews and to present them in an unfavorable light for propaganda purposes.

Because the Nazis' documentary was never fully edited and released, ""A Film Unfinished"" -- presenting the Nazis' film and historical commentary on it -- may be the most accurate cinemagraphic record of ghetto life.",1294272000,184,1704,4.992957746478873

4337582,5,B004EI2NWM,"If you wish to begin to understand what civilized people did or allowed to be done to the Jewish people, especially the Jews of Poland, in the mid-20th century, be certain to see this film. Filmed in the Warsaw Ghetto over a few months in 1942, it is one of the seminal documentary works about just one of the many atrocities of the Shoah, the Holocaust. While many scenes are manipulated for Nazi propaganda, it nevertheless gives unbearable glimpses into those horrific times in the Warsaw Ghetto. There, 100s of thousands of uprooted Jewish families were systematically starved for years before being deported directly to the gas chambers of Treblinka and other industrialized extermination facilities. The documentary is entirely comprised of film shot in the Ghetto during the internment of the Jews, many of whom held out hope of being resettled in the East or perhaps to Madagascar. A few children who lived in the Ghetto during those unimaginable times and somehow managed to survive watch and narrate some of the scenes as does one of the original German Nazi cameramen (through court transcripts).",1451174400,,1107,5.021739130434782
4337583,5,B004EI2NWM,"This film is a documentary based upon footage taken by the Nazis in the Warsaw Ghetto during May of 1942. As noted by the title, the intended work was never completed, and lay for decades hidden in film cans in a secret storage bunker.  It shows both the poverty and degradation of those forced into the ghetto, and staged propaganda footage meant to demonstrate a parallel, luxurious life enjoyed by some, at the apparent expense of others.  Some of the scenes are repeated, slightly varied, demonstrating the staged nature of those scenes.

What is special, and moving about this documentary is that a few individuals who survived the ghetto are shown watching and commenting on the scenes, and their recollections of the filming taking place. In some moments, we see the images on the screen. In others, we see the flickering reflection of the projected images on the glasses of people watching and remembering the horror and the truth and the ghetto.

The great irony of this film is that footage originally intended to demonstrate the sub-human status of the Jews forced into the ghetto ultimately serves as a document of the inhumanity of the Nazi's themselves , and their own moral decrepitude, the result of hatred and power combined into a sickness of mind and society never equaled in human history.

The film is well made.  The original footage was silent. A Film Unfinished adds well narrated commentary and description, and just enough background sound effect to support the silent images flickering on the screen.  The sole cameraman who was traced talks, in recorded testimony taken years earlier, that the purpose of the film was never told to him. But the filming designed to show the extreme differences between rich and poor certainly suggested to him that its sole purpose was propaganda.  It seems highly unlikely that footage of a woman applying lipstick and smoking a cigarette in front of a vanity mirror could have been filmed without some purpose - and given the circumstances, propaganda (at which the Nazis were masters) is quite likely.

It's a chilling, and moving film. Very well put together, well narrated.  Scenes are juxtaposed with narratives created by German reports filed to Berlin about the ghetto, and comments and recollections by the survivors viewing the silent footage.

While the original intent may have been to demonstrate the depravity of the Jews crammed into the Warsaw Ghetto, to me, it is, instead, an example of the gross depravity of the Nazis who intended to make this final film, probably in an effort to justify their Final Solution.",1449273600,15,2591,4.9607390300230945

4337601,5,B004EI2NWM,"The story of the Warsaw ghetto is one of the hallmarks of the Holocaust saga. Further distinguished as a resistance movement that rose against the Nazis by Jews with little to fight with and nothing left to lose. Heroism at its historical best, the Warsaw ghetto stands as a testament to the durability of man in the face of unbeatable odds, and the consequence of malevolent politics.

There have been many books, plays and novels about the Warsaw Ghetto and its uprising.  The new documentary A Film Unfinished is not about Warsawit is Warsaw.

Directed by Israeli filmmaker, Yael Hersonski, a special screening was held on August 2, at USCs School for Cinematic Arts, in Los Angeles, in the Ray Stark family theater. An eclectic crowd gathered consisting of film students  mixed in with both Christians and Jews who come to events like this on a continual search to try and understand the phenomenon of evil.

After the Nazis walled in 500,000 people in a three square mile area, they wanted to chronicle their achievement through photos and film. Although most of this documentation has been lost or destroyed there is one 62 minute reel that was discovered in East Germany in 1954, left over after the Soviets had ransacked the entire archive, and hauled everything left to Moscow. Why this was one reel was left behind is only speculative at this point.  Produced in May of 1942, only a few months before the massive deportations began, it covers the bulk of the raw footage in A Film Unfinished.

Shot as a propaganda film until very recently it was thought to be truth. Studied by western historians for decades it was the only primary source film available.

Then several years ago, a second reel was found. Showing the Nazi filmmakers doing scenes over and over again, from different angles and different set ups, the outtakes reel caught the Nazis in their deceit 60 years after the fact.

Nevertheless, the original 62 minutes has infinite primary historical value and Hersonski exploits that asset in her work. One example of this is identifying who these victims are. Since so many families and whole communities were completely wiped out by the Shoah, and have no one to speak for them, it is the never ending task of Holocaust students to try to put names and histories to these individuals. The film did exactly that on two occasions, a woman who was known to be begging for a piece of bread while she held her infant in her arms walking up and down the street and a street performer dancing  on a corner with lots of people huddled around staged for the Nazi cameras.

We know now that by the time this film was being produced hundreds of thousands of Jews had already been murdered in Byelorussia, capped by the incident at Babi Yar and with the Wansee conference in January of that year, the final solution had already been decided.  Its all too overwhelming how the efficiency of the Nazi machine went about taking its notes and making its mark for the thousand year Reich. The ones who ordered this film were well aware  by May of that year what would be the fate of Warsaws Jews.

The barbarous nature of Nazi brutality is well documented and its further codified in this film.

Of course, they wanted the world to see that they were not mistreating their Jewish wards as rumored, so they staged scenes of Jews in normal daily activities, eating in restaurants, sunbathing in the warm May sun, and buying food from a market place that is about as packed with foodstuffs as any in the world. The narrator tells us that maybe 20-50 people could actually afford to buy food in the ghetto.

The sea of humanity on Lezno st., and other main thoroughfares staged to show that it may be crowded but life goes on for Jews even in a wartime economythey will all be dead in a couple of months.

Unforgettable are the scenes that show Jews one or two at a time, and with each the director tells them to turn their heads slowly one way or the other. Each four or five second spot is obvious that this is an attempt  by the Nazis, preoccupied with racial theories to show that Jews were inferior to the Arian physique.

Unable to forget  these images, the close-ups throughout the film reveal the vicitims vacant death on  expressionless faces that haunt the viewer and clings to the minds imaging well after the experience ends.

Remember the original footage is unfinished so all the raw cuts are still part of the reel. The subsequent piles of human bodies waiting for mass burial, corroborates the historical axiom that  any Jew left behind Nazi lines after the war started in 1939 was marked for extermination. They never had a chance.

One of the most disturbing scenes was the mikveh. Both men and women were subjected to a degrading display of being forced to disrobe and enter the pool. Mortified faces deprived of even the simplest human modesty, the women were obviously being told how and where to move. Sixty eight years across time and still, that humiliation is not lost on the viewer.

Hersonski explained that Germans were obsessed with the camera. They took extra pictures, some for their own personal use. This explains a color reel discovered which Hersonski shows in her film. It is so out of place though, it probably could have been left out of this particular story.  But, Germans taking photos and filming on their own opens up the possibility that there are others, reels of historical gold sitting in someones attic somewhere waiting to be discovered by descendants who didn't know it was there.

Hersonski makes good use of survivors to tangibly connect our world to that past. From memories as children and teenagers, now mostly in their 80s, several of these people watched the film and commented on what they remembered. Showing the people up close, getting every little facial expression of nightmares ingrained so deep into their psyche, even to the point where one woman shielded her eyes during the mikveh scene.

As the survivors continue to die out and the events of the Holocaust transform from a physical real life experience into an historical past, its incumbent on the present generation to do what is necessary to preserve that past. Yael Hersonski has done that with A film Unfinished.  It stands on its own as a primary document of a few weeks of life in the Warsaw ghetto before it was extinguished.  Its an important film, one that inspires us to remember and implores us never to forget.

Distributed by Oscilloscope Pictures A Film Unfinished opens around America starting on August 18th. The DVD date has yet to be announced. Check below where it will be playing in your city.

4337615,4,B004EI2NWM,"In July 1942, a team of Nazi film makers arrived in the Warsaw Ghetto, where around 300,000 Jews lived amid squalor and misery and starvation. The goal was clear: make a work of propaganda designed to show the Jews were not fit to live. They filmed dying children in the street and impoverished beggars, always making sure to show people at their worst, and also forced a few Jews to dress up and pretend to be eating at lavish banquets while the majority of the ghetto inhabitants starved. Yet something went wrong along the way and the film was never finished; instead, four reels languished in a storehouse in eastern Germany and were not discovered until long after the war. Film Unfinished plays the four reels, as well as a reel of outtakes, and tries to clear up as much of the mystery as possible. Who sent the team to Warsaw? Why? There are few firm answers, yet by using post-war testimony of one of the cameramen as well as the wartime diary of the city administrator, it's clear the team had instructions to show Germans that the ghetto was full of diseased people living in filth while a few privileged souls moved from rich meal to rich meal. The documentary also interviews a handful of survivors as they watch the four reels. The scenes are mesmerising, not only because they offer a candid look at how appallling life was, but because the people are clearly terrified and (although they don't know it yet) were about to be shipped off to the death camps at Treblinka. We are looking at the dead as they spend their last few months alive on earth. It's quite possible that propaganda chiefs looked at the rushes and concluded they were unsuitable for general viewing. Rabbis are forced to watch as emaciated corpses are dumped in a communal grave. Children lie dead and dying on the streets of the city. German soldiers, who must have had young children of their own, manhandle and beat young kids caught trying to smuggle vegetables into the city. Naked men and women are driven into the communal baths, no doubt to demonstrate how the Jews had no morals. Some of these shots are tough to look at.

This is highly recommended. The only reason I give it four stars rather than five is that although we're told the film was silent, the documentary makers add a sound track approximating to what we're seeing. Sad and spooky music plays in the background and quickly becomes a distraction. The film is quite harrowing enough as it is without sound and should have been left that way.",1363478400,3,2497,4.61123595505618
4337616,3,B004EI2NWM,"When it comes to WWII especially anything to do with the war in Poland I'm interested, this was a collection of unedited footage taken by German cameramen regarding the Warsaw Ghetto, it does give a realistic picture of the lengths the Germans would go through to show the west that the Jewish population was doing well under their control, and also shows a lot of the misery these people went through before being shipped off to their eventual deaths. It is worth the watch and I would purchase it again.",1359676800,2,505,4.622222222222222

4337618,4,B004EI2NWM,"I am always amazed at film I have never seen before on the Nazi atrocities and their cruelness, perpetrated on the Jews and other ethnic groups. What the Nazi's did and what the Serbs did in Bosnia are light years apart. Light years away from the completeness of the Nazi game plan. Several million sadistic Nazi soldiers and officers, chosen, to sadistically snuff out tens of millions of children, women, young and old men, who gladly did what they were asked or ordered to do, by the upper sadistic bastards of the Nazi Party. This was a bunch of criminals, that would make Mafia members look like the Mickey Mouse Club. When the Jews were sent to the Ghettos, was actually the first step of the finality of the Jews. The level of cruelness, specifically of children, whose job was to go and seek some type of nutrition, food for others to eat, was a daily ritual. Most children were caught with the smuggling of food stuff, by Nazi guards, whose job was to confiscate the food, then take the child away, never to be seen again, usually hung immediately or shot even quicker. The family waited and waited and waited but then concluded that their child was never to return. I cannot imagine what Mothers and Fathers went through, while waiting for their child to return, knowing well what the outcome was, after so many hours. This film is a wonderful record of what took place in the Ghetto, however, it would better serve those few remaining Jews, who can identify and relate to their time there as well. It is certainly worth owning, which serves as yet another record of the Nazi dream and the Jewish nightmare. As it is titled, A Film Unfinished, serves the film well, for it is just that, A Film Unfinished, and perhaps a film never to be completed.",1356307200,8,1757,4.563291139240507

4337620,4,B004EI2NWM,"**Some Spoilers**
 I really don't understand people who trash this film or any film dealing with the holocaust. I am indeed well aware that NOT only Jewish people suffered at the hands of that Ape escaped from a zoo known as Hitler but most of the comments I've read are reeking with antisemitism. Perhaps they wanted to see the Jews being deported on their way to death camps like Treblinka, Auschwitz, Bergen-Belsen. That wasn't a movie set, those weren't actors playing a part. Sadly, that was the REAL DEAL and it broke my heart to see all those corpses of mostly children on the streets. The scene of the grave sight was just too much to bear. I didn't sleep for two days because of this film and I couldn't care less if someone thinks that's being over dramatic. If being human and not some HEARTLESS Wench or Jerk is being over dramatic than I'm proud to be that way. This isn't something I would watch again, not because it's bad which it isn't, but because it left me emotionally distraught for a couple of days. The question that kept racing to my mind was; Where was God when all this happened or WHY did it have to happen.",1347321600,7,1134,4.425837320574162
4337621,4,B004EI2NWM,I enjoyed watching this sad story of the treatment of the Jews.  It showed that one must always resist Evil no matter what the cost to your personal freedoms.  Otherwise your Doomed.,1331769600,5,182,4.65625
4337622,3,B004EI2NWM,"Cons: When I first got this I think I was expecting somewhat more than what was here, I fully expected something a little more groundbreaking... I expected at least a detailed explanation of this film ie: some sound(none)on the original, More details with regards to interviews(few), then without more information from interviews it leaves a big hole wide enough to fall through... The lack of information here is severe, This is definitely a film unfinished (waiting for part 2 :( jk..) This is a nazi propaganda film unedited from it's creation but was also never used, whats it for? I'm not sure and it seems nobody else is, I would have loved to see what the nazis were using this for.. It could have been an ss training film to, whos to say it was a public propaganda film, it doesn't have that flair for the dramatical feel that you almost always see when you watch anything produced by the nazis....

Pros: On the upside you do see original footage from Warsaw that not many people have probably seen, it is as always good for someone to put out a film that shows the continuing hatred of the nazis.. As long as they put the film out there is a chance people won't forget the holocaust.. Even though the nazis are basically telling the jews what to do while filming, how to do it and with much of the same hatred ( just minus the public beatings or executions)..The jewish on this were forced to do whatever the nazis wanted so you see what they want you to see, it's a chilling depiction of the holocaust and to see it in this manner( well, it makes me glad to be an american and to have not lived through this)

In the end... It's a nice piece of history, you see raving people obviously pushed to the brink, you also get a view on what the ghetto was like for real people..Very rarely do you see the ghetto in this manner, usually it's during train arrivals or during nazi roundups..It was very disturbing to see the dead and decaying laying about in the street with people milling around them ( including children) like they aren't even there.. You see how depraved it was to live in the ghetto, I mean how can you get used to death so much that even a child could walk past a decaying corpse and act as if nothing is wrong.. It's chilling and very disturbing

This is not a film to buy if you are looking for entertainment or for the horrific executions on video that you would normally see in a holocaust film...

4337624,5,B004EI2NWM,"I was somewhat skeptical when I received Amazon's suggestion of this film for me, but having seen it, I highly recommend it.  Since it was originally produced for the Propaganda Ministry but never shown (having lingered in an East German archive during the Cold War) the commentary as well as eyewitness accounts do an excellent job in placing the original footage remnants in proper context.  With its original footage, it gives the viewer a glimpse into life in the Warsaw Ghetto, including the levels of complicity and coercion of its perpetrators and vicitms.  In short, for anyone who has an interest in this history as well as professionals in the field, this film is an important addition to the overall knowledge and understanding the events surrounding the development of the Holocaust.",1315785600,7,795,5.0534351145038165
4337625,4,B004EI2NWM,"This program is both disgusting and well worth watching. When the producers show film reels, though, they show 35mm reels and the cameras in use clearly were 16mm.

4337626,5,B004EI2NWM,Why would they film their atrocities? What kind of people would do such a thing? And then the people who turned the other cheek. They're all guilty! They're not people! They are worst than animals...,1308009600,4,199,4.714285714285714
4337627,5,B004EI2NWM,"After World War Two ended, huge amounts of film were discovered which had been hidden away by The Nazis. Among these films was something of great importance--a film simply entitled ""The Ghetto"" filmed in May of 1942. It was never released by the Nazis but their intention was clear: they wanted to prove to the world that the Jews imprisoned in the Warsaw ghetto were actually living under ""reasonable conditions."" Some of the footage is not well preserved or restored; but it doesn't need to be restored in order to have a most powerful, horrifying and infuriating effect.

While the Nazis documented the horrific conditions of the ghetto; we also see how they had their cameramen stage elaborate events to make it appear that the conditions in the ghetto were tolerable when, of course, the truth was anything but that. For example, there is footage of what is actually a make-believe funeral procession; theater shows for which the ""audience"" had to laugh just right or they would be beaten by the Nazis; wealthy Jews ignoring impoverished children begging for just a tiny amount of money or just a slice of bread to eat--in this case, to demonstrate to the world that Jews were truly sub-humans who had neither heart nor soul. Other scenes included making Jews dispassionately walk over corpses as if nothing was wrong or disturbing about it and humiliating men and women by making them take a ritual bath together on film. There are even several different ""takes"" of many ""scenes"" so that the Nazis would capture just what they wanted to show on film!

In addition, we get commentaries from survivors watching the footage; obviously it has a tremendous impact on them. The flood of emotions they experience makes them cry and shut their eyes because it is so painful. We also learn about a cameraman, Willy Wist, who was assigned to film many of the ""scenes"" of ""The Ghetto."" The interview reenactments with Wist are enlightening and sobering at once.

The DVD comes with a few extras that are quite worthwhile. It's tough to take; but it's important to watch a short film directed by Billy Wilder entitled ""Death Mills"" in which Wilder exposes the horrors of the systematic Nazi killing machine. Michael Berenbaum offers additional commentary in another brief extra; and I the interview with author and film researcher Adrian Wood is informative.

Overall, ""A Film Unfinished"" is a must-have for anyone studying the Holocaust, World War Two or the evils of the Nazi regime. It's powerful and upsetting but the true story must be told; this documentary about what would have been a Nazi propaganda film is very well done.",1307577600,22,2626,4.881165919282512
4337628,5,B004EI2NWM,"YES.  It really happened.

And proof that the Holocaust really happened can be seen not only in eyewitness testimony preserved by groups like the Shoah Foundation but also records like this film created by the Nazis themselves.

It all started in May 1942.  That was three months before the Jews of the Warsaw ghetto were to be expelled to their deaths in concentration camps.

In order to create a propaganda film which attempted to show in part just how nice life was for Warsaw Jews, German camera crews were sent into the ghetto to create staged scenes for film.  Every life cycle event from Jewish life was to be recorded using only Jews who showed the least signs of starvation from their forced presence.

However the camera's eye also managed to capture the process of Nazi propagandists in the act of creating their lie.  In many cases out take footage actually showed German cameramen and others directing the activities of Jews so that the scenes produced would look more realistic.

Out takes also included real depictions of life in the ghetto.  Outside of other concentration camp footage and of course the works of Bosch, there have been no other more vivid depictions of Hell on Earth than those shown in this film.

Thanks to narration and editorial inserts, viewers are provided with helpful information surrounding the film's creation.  They are also shown scenes of Warsaw survivors viewing footage of once familiar street scenes and faces.

Sadly, outside of these reels, the massacred Jews of Warsaw now exist no where else but on film.

Seeing this movie does what little we can now do to preserve their memory and maybe even to avoid their fate.",1306972800,9,1669,4.830985915492958
4337629,5,B004EI2NWM,"this film is most profound when it shows only the moving images of life in the Warsaw ghetto.  the narration allows insight into what the people were thinking--both those who lived in the ghetto and those who filmed the reels of propaganda.

but the faces of the children, women and men who inhabited this place tell the story best of all.

we are witness to a historical document, no matter how deceptive the original intent, of how human beings were placed in horrific circumstances beyond our imagination and yet tried their best to maintain their dignity and will to live.

the American war department film, Death Mills, is worthy in its own right.  it gives a glimpse into the aftermath of the concentration camps and the toll on its captives.  it is hard to watch, but it speaks in its own way to the value and sanctity of human life.

the holocaust is truly a story that must never be finished.

if you are interested in learning more about the holocaust, i strongly recommend a visit to the holocaust museum in Washington D.C.  it is one of the most profound and respectful museums i have ever been to.",1306713600,5,1110,4.565656565656566
4337630,5,B004EI2NWM,"In ""A Film Unfinished"" footage from an unreleased Nazi propaganda documentary provides a macabre view of the Warsaw Ghetto in 1942. The Germans delight in contrasting the misery of the poor Jewish inhabitants with the more priviledged. Malnourished, unattractive Jews are sinisterly presented as spectacle. Jewish religious practices are exhibited as grotesque superstitions. Director Yael Hersonski countervails this devilish perspective with interviews of ghetto survivors along with dramatization of the testimony of one of the filmmakers. Viewers will be haunted by the knowledge that within only months of the completion of filming, the vast majority of Jews seen in the documentary will be transported to Treblinka and put to death. ""A Film Unfinished"" is an extremely valuable witness to the depravity of Nazi Germany.",1305763200,7,825,5.661290322580645

4337632,5,B004EI2NWM,there are other reviews describing this feature which shows how a people can be beaten down to submit to anything to live just one more day. The fact is this was not meant to be seen until editing. If the Nazis thought they were doing the right thing by eliminating the jew why would they feel the need to cover up their methods and try to hide from the world their ultimate plan to kill all jews. Pure evil exists today as well as then and must always be stopped by any means possible. Many other acts of genocide have occurred and are occurring in this world but are seldom given the attention as much as the Holocaust which I feel is a grave mistake. If we are to rid the world of evil the rest of the world should always be informed of the truth and more should be challenged to rid the world of evil.,1305417600,7,805,4.13375796178344
4337633,4,B004EI2NWM,"This movie featured the filming of one of the Nazi run ghettos used to segregate Jews before they were shipped to the camps.  The Nazi film was propaganda to show how well the Nazis treated the Jews.  It was never completed.  However, they staged  rehearsed scenes with ghetto inhabitants. The out takes which were never intended for the propaganda film make for interesting viewing.  In this film we watch as the Germans staged the scenes in their perpetually cruel manner. This is a documentary about the horrors of life in a Jewish ghetto during the holocaust.  Some scenes are horrific so people with small children should be warned.  We bought it because we missed the one day showing at the JCC.  The Angelika which was supposed to show it for a week or longer closed before it came to our city.
