4332641,2,B004DK8UVE,"MGM's big-budget talkie extravaganza was a decadent (and deserved) flop. Compared to other Cecil B. DeMille spectacles, ""Madam Satan"" (1930) cannot escape its static presentation. The director's bizarre romantic musical goes on forever, with no editor in sight. Little wonder that DeMille returned to religious epics. Worth a look for Lillian Roth's delightful performance, Cedric Gibbons' Art Deco sets and Adrian's lavish costumes.",1387497600,,433,5.888888888888889
4332642,5,B004DK8UVE,"Ceec B DeMille at his best.  Back to the bedroom comedies - the acting is fantastic.  None of the filthy potty-mouth that passes for entertainment today.  The party scene is like living a fantasy.  I love b&w because it keeps one focused on the acting, drama, set design, costumes, lighting and all the other variants that make up great craftsmanship.  I spend some amount of time scrolling through other reviews and found this gem of a movie by reading what other people have to say.  Good transfer quality.",1375488000,,508,4.715909090909091
4332643,5,B004DK8UVE,"Greetings & Salutations! Cecil Blount DeMille (1881-1959) was a creative genius and his masterpiece was a musical titled ""Madame Satan,"" released in 1930 at the height of the Great Depression, a time when such films inspired those affected by the hard times who needed entertainment to cheer them up, the songs in this film were remembered by many who saw this great film! ""How am I to know"" was one of many songs that were well written and sung! A zeppelin was also included, a brilliant touch considering these flying machines were coming into their own and the scenes of the patrons aboard the airship performed their scene very well and it ranks up there with ""Gone with the wind,"" etc. This is a must have DVD no MGM fan should be without, you'll be entertained every time you view the DeMille masterpiece and don't forget to serve hot buttered popcorn, milk duds, and soft-drinks. Have watched this DVD many times and it being remastered restore it to when it was first shown on the silver screen in theaters nationwide. If this DVD is sold out, place your name on the waiting list msbe you get lucky too! Enjoy!",1371772800,,1118,4.623115577889447
4332644,3,B004DK8UVE,"I like what DeMille does a few years past this, thinks like Cleopatra, Sign of the Cross etc...and he was cutting his teeth here - talkies were just coming in and they threw lots of ""musical"" parts into films as they tested the waters as to what would bring the crowds in.  This film would have been much better, without that aspect.  Nice premise and the end-part of the film when the floating hedonistic party, takes the thunderstorm damage and ---(spoiler alert)--- they have to parachute off it to survive.  But the film, while a morality play - IS irritating as the people are such weak morons.  What is the premise for the whole ending seems to be, God giving them the smack-down.  But they get away with it and there is little satisfaction ---- or as to quote from another movie ""well, maybe they needed some killing"".  Good film for a collector and cleaned up VERY well -- but don't expect the usual DeMille drama - it is not here like you would anticipate.",1359676800,,965,4.485714285714286
4332645,4,B004DK8UVE,"Plant your toungue firmly in your cheek-rouge your knees and bob your hair its the end of the 20's and Cecile B De Mille takes us to the penthouse apartments of Park Ave and even higher to a high fling costume ball in a Dirigable. Don't expect anything more than campy fun and some exciting costumes and sets-experimental miniature shots-sparkle and feathers and lots of warbly period voices.

The good girl wife discovering her philandering husband is cheating with a chorus girl named Trixie decides to win hime back by out jazzing the jazz baby.

JIMMY (the husband) is smitten by the sexy and seductive Madam Satan who is his wife in a somewhat suggestive devil costume) at the airborn costume extravaganza that is the finale of the picture...it has an arte deco steam punk kinda feel and lots to interest the eye---going head to head with Triie the wife wins back her man and gets a promise from Trixe that she will stay away from Jimmy in exchange for a parachute.

If you must take a picture seriously and want to look for symbolism and substance this isn't the film for you but if the bathtub gin is ready to swig and you have a pack of tailor mades light up get a buzz on and laugh your way through Madam Satan-a terrible bedroom comedy musical but a lavish good time for lovers of the Jazz age complete with the sim sham, charelston and an electricity ballet---whoopee!!!

The guests parachuting off the disintigrating blimp dangling from silk parachutes in many suggestive poses is worth the price of admission.

Lavish, good fun from the man who brough you the parting of the red sea and samson bringing down the temple.",1320710400,8,1632,4.613793103448276
4332646,3,B004DK8UVE,"Not restored but good quality DVD-R, which Amazon usually labels as such, but not in this case. First half of movie is typical De Mille morality play but the second half is fantastic Buck Rogers musical. The problem with DVD-R is not just player compatibility problems but also longevity issues, will it last 2 years or 5 years?",1301184000,8,328,4.672413793103448
4332647,1,B004DK8UVE,"I'm on my second copy, and my Sony (the only one I have) dvd player refuses to recognize that ther is a disc in the player. This is very frustrating, as I've looked forward to seeing this since excerpts were shown in the special features on one of the Forbidden Hollywood Collections. Frankly I hoped it was coming on the next Forbidden Hollywood Collection, along with Jeanne Eagles', The Letter. I guess we can forget that, but why won't these discs play? Is there some kind of extra encoding? Please fix this problem Warner Archives.",1292457600,5,536,4.652631578947369
4332648,5,B004DK8UVE,"Madame Satan is an early talkie musical that was Cecil B. DeMille's second try at a talking picture. The first half of the film is your basic precode bedroom farce, made particularly amusing by that spitfire Lilian Roth, here at only age 19. The second half is the bizarre musical portion set on a dirigible. We're in Golden Dawn territory here folks, so prepare for lots of jaw dropping moments.

My problem with this product was that the first one pixelated on two of the four players in my house. Believing that since I shelled out Warner's highway robbery price for their remastered DVD-R's I should be able to watch this film in any of my DVD players, I requested a replacement. This one played on three of the four players, but refused to even be recognized by the fourth. The rejecting DVD player was not one of the two that rejected the original disc. So if you get this one, try it out immediately and make sure you don't have a bad disc.",1291420800,15,947,4.442528735632184
8425488,5,B004DK8UVE,"One of the most craziest, but most amazing movies of all time!",1513382400,,62,4.25
8425489,4,B004DK8UVE,"Not the greatest film ever. Basically a semi-screwball romantic farce whose main plot line is pretty thin. But stay with it and you'll be rewarded near the end with the blimp scenes where Madam Satan shows up. The movie goes from a rather normal comedy to a downright bizarre romp that plays much like a drug-addled dream sequence. The costumes are outlandish. The stretches to the plot are beyond belief. But it doesn't matter - it is so much fun to watch, it is worth sitting through 3/4 of the rather listless film to get to the insanity of the blimp event. Madam Satan's dress, practically the star of the show, is a mix of stunning nude silk with dark flames barely covering all the important bits (can you say pre-Hays code?). In researching the film later, I found documents that describe the flames as being red - though they come across as dark as the grave in glorious black and white, which, honestly, I think makes for a much better visual. Yes, it is a horribly sexist film, but geez, it was 1930 where guys were guys and dolls were dolls (not saying that's better...it's just the way it was). The best acting in the film is from the comedic foil Roland Young.",1495584000,,1173,4.485981308411215
8425490,4,B004DK8UVE,"Bottom Line: Cecil B. DeMiles is the main thing that will sell Madam Satan. But there are more reasons than just the name of the director. There is some snappy patter, more than a little suggestive and what would have been for the time a major production number. Over all this is a fun movie and it is a definite collector piece for someone tracking American Movie History. There are no bad words, even if the topic and treatment of infidelity and a woman having Quote smooth round heels Close Quote is treated rather casually. There is no violence or gore. Madam Satan makes for a just barely risqu date night movie and perhaps a family movie. For the film buff this is a movie to keep on your shelf, for many another it is a rent when and if you're in the mood.

Plot summary: Idle Rich Married Playboy Bob Brooks (Reginald Denny) has a mistress and wants to keep her. To modern eyes his qualities are: he is rich, he is good looking and not much else. Denny mostly stands there looking handsome, when is not drunk, being jealous or trying to keep busy. His wife Angela, Kay Johnson spends part of the movie deciding how much of her husbands busy extramarital activities she can tolerate and just how far she has to go from being his angle to win him back.

Wing man and fellow rich drunk Jimmy Wade (Roland Young) handles what is a complex back up roll serving as the drinking buddy, cover for his married friends, and sponsor of the huge costume party held aboard a zeppelin. The zeppelin is a clever bit of staging and allows some long ago actress to add to their resumes that they acted the role of Miss Conning Tower, Fish Girl or Electricity. Demille daughter Katherine got herself an un-credited role as a Zeppelin Reveler (Thanks Wiki)

Kay Johnson gets to sing in both an operatic style and a jazz style. Both are good performances.

There is an extended bit of classic bedroom farce and again some suggestive one liners. Altogether the movie is fun, mostly forgettable and interesting as a piece of movie history.",1491350400,,2025,4.509536784741145

8425495,5,B004DK8UVE,"This film was one of Cecil B. DeMille's only films for MGM. He tried to put something for everyone in it, and so you have a film which bridges several genres. It's at once, a bedroom farce, a musical, a comedy and a disaster film. I defy anyone not to have their jaw drop while viewing the many fantastic costumes shown at the zeppelin ball. The acting of Kay Johnson as the title character is fine as are Reginald Denny and Roland Young. This film also features Lillian Roth in what might be the best role of her short film carrer. A unique film and lots of fun.",1432857600,,563,4.222222222222222
8425496,4,B004DK8UVE,"""Who wants to go to Hell with Madam Satan?""

Well, this viewer did & thoroughly enjoyed the trip! Cecil B. DeMille delivers one of his most bizarre films, one that changes constantly, going from risqu bedroom farce to rudimentary musical to Art Deco debauchery to an early disaster epic. Neglected wife Kay Johnson, still attractive but verging on matronly (at least in attitude & dress), discovers that playboy husband Reginald Denny is cavorting about town with sharp-witted cutie Lillian Roth. Accompanied by bachelor playboy Roland Young, who seems a human incarnation of Droopy Dawg in his hilarious line delivery, hubby blames his wife for his own inability to grow up. This being a DeMille film, a stern moral lesson must be taught -- but only after depicting plenty of sin to be renounced first!

And this is where the film goes into glorious overdrive, with a masquerade ball on a zeppelin, filled with rich, spoiled, drunken partygoers & a seemingly endless parade of gorgeous young women in outrageously absurd but sexy costumes. The proceedings culminate with an auction of these all-too-willing women -- for charity, of course! -- that's interrupted by the arrival of hubby's determined wife in the guise of Madam Satan, slinky & purring in a faux French accent that's somehow even sexier for being such a cartoon. No more verging on the matronly here! And she proceeds to seduce her own sap of a husband to teach him a lesson.

Then lightning strikes -- literally! The zeppelin is torn loose from its tower, screaming party guests scramble for parachutes, the band plays on, and DeMille turns up the spectacle to 11. Considering the era in which it was made, the effects still look pretty good, in that dreamlike way of early film FX. And everything is brought to a satisfactory conclusion by the time ""The End"" appears. (Just note where the delighted Lillian Roth's parachute appropriately lands her.)

Now, modern viewers will undoubtedly find parts of the film stagey & stodgy, particularly the first 30-40 minutes -- though even that does have some great one-liners. Just keep in mind that this was an early talkie, when filmmakers were still finding their way with new technology & suitable pacing. But on the whole, it's a lot of ridiculous fun in all of its aspects, the sort of wildly insane film no studio would dare make today. I especially love the avant-garde dance salute to Electricity, which looks like an outtake from ""Metropolis"" as seen through a Dada lens. And Kay Johnson is a perfectly scrumptious Madam Satan -- which makes for an amusing final scene, as dim-bulb hubby slowly realizes that his supposedly dull, serious wife still has that other side to her, as she emphasizes with a knowingly raised eyebrow & a sly half-smile. It's definitely not a masterpiece, but if you approach it with the right spirit, it's a hoot & a half -- recommended!",1423094400,5,2882,4.887525562372188
8425497,5,B004DK8UVE,"This is DeMille's most over the top pre-code film. How it ever got past the censors I can't even imagine. It is a trippy hoot all the way, a surrealist masterpiece (check out the dirigible party) masquerading as a Hollywood feature.",1418601600,,232,4.682926829268292
