It has many interviews such as with the owners of the Little Alien, a restaurant/gift shop/apartment! It is great! The DVD is the BEST documentary on AREA 51!!!!!!!! I bought it of of AMAZON.COM!!! (The best online store in the world!!!)Also if you like this video try Close Encounters: Proof of Alien Contact!!!!",1304812800,,467,4.63855421686747

8287341,3,B000067DCY,"This is a half decent, but short video about the mystery of Area 51.  The interviews are a little annoying.  Why does the director feel the need to put a coffee mug or a ketchup bottle right in front of the screen?  It distracted me from the people who were talking.  Nonetheless, the video films of the UFOs are one of a kind.",1065312000,9,327,4.142857142857143
8287342,3,B000067DCY,"This documentary was made in 1997 about the mystery of Americas most secret base, Area 51 or otherwise known as Dreamland. Area 51 researcher Glen Campbell is interviewed throughout the program and talks about mystery that surrounds this secret base that's not suppose to exist. There is also an interview with the owners of the Little Ale in. There are more up to date programs out there on this topic but still not a bad program. The program runs for 54 minutes.
Transfer is video quality with the occasional line streaming down the image. The audio is Dolby stereo 2.0 and is average. For the extras, there is 58 minutes of ufo footage, the quality is very poor quality, and whoever put this extra on forgot to include audio. This feature runs for 58 minutes.",1030579200,14,762,4.651851851851852
