8100697,5,B000CQQIU8,"Attended a live performance of this video by Larry Vanderveen at the South Pasadena Public Library. last night. (May 7.2013) Approximately 160 individuals attended and about half of them were high-school students from South Pasadena H.S.  Bottom line--they loved it. A ninety minute monologue can test anyone's patience. That said, Mr. Vanderveen held their and my attention the entire time and gave us an amazing inside look at the complexities of a remarkable 20th Century writer, warts and all.  Highly recommended.

8100698,5,B000CQQIU8,"It's true that this production is not a year-by-year recounting of Fitzgerald's life, but if you are looking for that read Wikipedia. I totally disagree with the reviewer who says this is not for students. Unless your goal is to have your students know the author's birth and death years, his principle works, and nothing about what made him tick. This is, in my opinion, a VERY insightful, moving piece of dramatic theatre, which provides a deep look into the man's often lonely thoughts and emotions. For example, when he talks about Ernest Hemingway. Frankly, the other reviewer's comments sum up a lot of what is wrong about today's education; boring facts are emphasized over inner, perceptive truths, which needless to say tell you a great deal more about what has real significance.",1357171200,2,789,4.93984962406015
8100699,3,B000CQQIU8,Meeting with F. Scott Fitzgerald is a long-winded single-person depiction of F. Scott Fitzgerald.  There isn't a lot of enthusiasm in this performance and if you're using it to instruct students on this author - don't get this one!  This is not something students (nor I) will sit through.  I was looking for a solo performance for Forensic kids and drama students but this is just too boring.  Most of the information he presents is better learned in the A&E biography on him - if you're using it for informational purposes for a study on him and his novels.  Not recommended for use with high school students.,1311638400,,611,4.672897196261682
8100700,4,B000CQQIU8,"Larry Vanderveen performs a brilliant one man show as he smoothly assumes the persona of F. Scott Fitzgerald. Elegant in a well cut double breasted blazer, perfectly creased slacks and pristine white shirt and pocket square, Vanderveen as Fitzgerald reflects on his life and work. Vanderveen's gentle recital, effortlessly moving from irony to comic reminiscence to deep regret, conveys a superb impression of the brilliant but tragically star-crossed writer. Honest and unsparing of himself, he describes the struggles to succeed with his books - never truly fulfilled during his life - his terrible struggles with alcoholism and, most poignant of all, the beautiful, self destructive, doomed Zelda. Vanderveen's tone and expressions never pall; this is very well worth watching.",1143072000,4,780,5.563025210084033
