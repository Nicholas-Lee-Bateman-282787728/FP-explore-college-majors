7857547,2,630397256X,"I'm not aware of what version of ""Jack and the Beanstalk"" resides on this video, but not so many years ago, I caught ""The Pied Piper of Hamelin"" on TCM, starring Van Johnson, Claude Raines, and Kay Starr(the singer). Although Kay is no Katherine Hepburn, she really didn't need to be. Most of the program is song-not great ones, but okay. This was actually a TV special in the late 50s and is a perfect example of what television specials for the family were like from the 50s-70s. Not that some weren't better, but the story(many were often fairy tales), music, costumes, and sets were usually similar to this one. Like many of these specials of the time, this one goes on a little too long, but if you're interested in this period of the TV age, this is a perfect representation of that period. As far as 50s TV specials go, there is also a version of ""Babes in Toyland"" from this period that I've looked for, Fred Astaire and Bing Crosby specials, and one of many versions of ""Alice in Wonderland"", from the 70s, with Nanette Fabray, that I've attempted to find for some time now. If anyone knows anything about any of these-or other specials, I would appreciate an email. I would be happy to return the favor, if possible.",1119225600,,1226,4.502242152466367
