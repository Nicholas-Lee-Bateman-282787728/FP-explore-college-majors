8285629,4,B001C1CSRY,"There are a growing number of docs on porn, but few examine porn and race at the same time.  Also, oppressive stereotypes present Asian Americans as asexual.  Thus, a tenured professor proposes that a porn film, really a porn scene, with an Asian-American couple be made.  This work speaks about the production of the scene as well as interviewing well-known Asian-American scholars and actors about the matter.
Talk about tenure setting professors free!  One reason why a Kinsey or Masters & Johnson were considered so revolutionary is because many naysayers deem sex and sexuality unimportant for serious study.  Dr. Hamamoto tries to go against this grain.  However, even a progressive or horny student may be shocked seeing their gray-haired professor obsessed with writing about and making porn.  Part of Hamamoto's project is to promote yellow-on-yellow action.  Along that line you learn that he is in an INTRAracial, heterosexual relationship.  The film tries to walk a fine line and not alienate biracial Asian Americans or those in interracial relationships.
Like ""The Slanted Screen"" and other projects, this work focuses on East and Southeast Asians.  It completely ignores South Asians and that may upset some viewers.
When I saw this at an arthouse screening, they showed the blue scene that was produced.  I don't think this disc include it, unfortunately.  So if you are looking for the real action, you gotta visit a certain type of store or a video store with a certain money-making section, if you know what I mean.
One of the most poignant scenes to me was when Hamamoto and his girlfriend disagreed on whether to film a controversial, though almost requisite, act in blue movies.  The point is that this film doesn't leave gender at the door.  It tries to be gender-diverse, though it is clearly not sexual orientation-diverse.
In brief, I liked this documentary immensely and I bought a copy for my cousin as a Christmas gift.  I think it will be incredibly useful for Ethnic Studies or Asian-American studies majors.  Though risqu'e, this was a needed and quality work.",1241654400,2,2092,5.037790697674419
