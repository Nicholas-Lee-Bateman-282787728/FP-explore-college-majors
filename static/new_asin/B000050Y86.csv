7929141,5,B000050Y86,"This episode of A&E's ""Biography"", hosted and narrated by Harry Smith, covers the life and acting career of the talented Sally Field, one of the finest of all American actresses.

Born in Pasadena, California, on November 6, 1946, the diminutive 5-foot-2 Sally Margaret Field has appeared in more than 75 motion pictures and television shows. Her first TV gig was portraying ""Frances Elizabeth 'Gidget' Lawrence"" in the 1965-1966 series ""Gidget"". Just a year after that show concluded its short 32-episode run, Sally became ""The Flying Nun"", on the TV program of the same name. That series ran from 1967 to 1970 (83 total episodes).

Sally's mother, Margaret Field, was also an actress -- with the elder Field having been seen in 40 films (from 1945 to 1973). Sally's mom was also a common sight on television, putting in guest appearances on many shows from 1950 to 1968 (including parts in ""Adam-12"", ""Perry Mason"", ""The Twilight Zone"", ""The Untouchables"", and ""Make Room For Daddy"").

On the exact day I submitted this Amazon product review, Sally Field celebrated her 59th birthday. Which also means that it has been 40 years since she first entered American living rooms as ""Gidget"". (Anybody else out there feeling a lot older now, after having that statistic sink in?) ~wink~

Sally Field has always been a pleasure to watch on the screen (big screen or small). Some of my favorite movies starring or co-starring Sally include (in no particular order).........

>> ""Sybil"" (1976) -- A made-for-television movie in which Sally turned in a remarkable performance as ""Sybil Dorsett"", a disturbed young woman who has 16 different personalities.

>> ""Murphy's Romance"" (1985) -- Sally and James Garner make a nice pair in this laid-back and thoroughly-engaging comedy-drama.

>> ""Norma Rae"" (1979) -- For which Sally won the Oscar for Best Actress.

>> ""Steel Magnolias"" (1989).

>> ""Smokey And The Bandit"" (1977).

>> ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" (1993) -- Loved Sally in this one too. Her reaction is terrific when she first discovers that Mrs. Doubtfire is, in fact, the father of her own children (""Daniel?!! Oh my God! Oh my God! The whole time?! The whole time??? THE WHOLE TIME??!!""). :-)

>> ""Absence Of Malice"" (1981).

>> ""Forrest Gump"" (1994).

>> ""Not Without My Daughter"" (1991).

>> ""Places In The Heart"" (1984) -- A second Oscar trophy was won by Sal for this film. In this A&E ""Bio"", the writer/director of ""Places"" (Robert Benton) pays Sally the type of compliment that I imagine every actor yearns to hear, and is a tribute to Sally's raw acting talent and ability.

Mr. Benton's quote: ""Sally brought a kind of 'fierceness' to it, which surprised me. I didn't write that. She brought it to the film, and made the character complete in a way I had never imagined. That's the great thing about working with wonderful actors...they make it better than you wrote it. I never once gave Sally direction. She knew the character. She understood that person. She inhabited that person.""

Most of Sally's movie and TV roles listed above are covered in this 45-minute ""Biography"" (a program which sports the full on-screen title of ""Sally Field: Defying Gravity""). Thumbs-Up to this ""A&E Home Video"" production. As the A&E slogan goes -- It's time well-spent. ;)",1131235200,,3275,4.979816513761468
