8277231,5,B000FC2GBO,"Memories!  I was only nine years old and living in Mexico City in 1970, but that World Cup and the magic of the seleo that year, will live in my heart and mind forever.

As far as quality, remember it was not filmed in 2017!  It was filmed 47 years ago!  But it still looks great.

Well packed, quality DVD",1485129600,,306,4.033333333333333

8277233,2,B000FC2GBO,"The problem with this product is that it a cheap direct transfer from a video to DVD product.  I had seen this ""tape"" about 20 years ago and I thought that this Mexico 70 World Cup recap would be good.

What I got was ""selected plays"", no complete games...just highlights of the Game of the Century and the Final.

The narrator IS TERRIBLE!!!..my high school freshman son could do better.

The company that launched this should have done a better job.  What a wasted golden opportunity.",1155772800,5,486,4.604651162790698
