We went to a local magic store and bought a few simple mechanical type items that would work for 5 to 8 years old children and then I searched for a DVD that would not only help us learn since we have never performed magic tricks and one that had simple tricks for young new magicians to perform. Frank's has several of them. We did so good that at the end of the week we put on a great performance for moms, dads, neighbors and grandparents. We were so proud of these children it brought tears to your eyes. Four kids performed 5 tricks each, many but not all from Frank's instructions. From Franks we did the linking paper clips, linking paper clips with rubber band, the sugar packets How Sweet it is, the talking crayons, samari slices, illusionist rope trick, mind reading markers. We taught the kids then sit them down to watch the video and they got super excited when they saw Frank do the trick, yelling we just did that one.
Frank does the trick, then breaks it down for you. The beginning he goes over the rules which are great as well.",1438473600,,1150,4.328703703703703

Thanks Frank for making my job easier and alot of kids (and adults!) amazed.

stuff your grandfather would do like ""Hey. I got your nose.""

This is not full magic, impress your friends, wow party goers, type magic.

Everything on this is simple Curious George  stuff, that you can learn in

about 10 minutes of practice.

He goes through a good number of tricks, and shows how they are done.

If you are a beginner in magic, or under 10 years old, this is perfect for

getting you started.

I sat through this with my nephew (10), and he guessed correctly at 4 of

the 25 tricks.

It's fun, easy stuff.
