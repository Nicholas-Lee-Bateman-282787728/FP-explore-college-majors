I'd listen to Rodney on the Roq on Sunday nights, and every time a new song would start I'd hold my breath, hoping for some punk or hardcore... and then deflate with disappointment when he played some of his ""girl stuff."" Music that I thought of, literally, as ""music only girls like."" The Gun Club was one of those bands. As an adolescent little punker who couldn't get enough TSOL and Discharge, they just didn't seem relevant to my interests. That early impression lasted until... I dunno, relatively recently. A few years ago I was re-reading We Got The Neutron Bomb, and there's a whole chapter on The Gun Club. I don't think I'd ever read that chapter before, pretty sure I skipped it because I wasn't the least bit interested. After finally reading it and finding it somewhat fascinating, I decided to get better acquainted with the band and bought copies of Fire of Love and Miami. Really dug them both, Miami in particular. I found out about this documentary recently, figured ""why not?"" and bought it.

It's... not great. Barely any footage of the band performing, no interview footage of Mr. Pierce. It's basically just a sequence of interviews with band members and friends and most of the time they're bitterly complaining about what a hellish experience it was, and piling on to expose what a loser Pierce was. Everything from claiming he never got any chicks to accusing him of being a feather weight drinker. I was surprised they never mentioned how he almost always sang way off key. (Crap, now *I'm* doing it...) Maybe they all intended it to come off as affectionate foible tweaking, but it didn't seem that way to me.

All in all this was the most disappointing music bio/doc thing I've seen in a long time. Not recommended.",1410393600,3,1791,4.6645569620253164
8343257,2,B001UB3IC0,"The interviews on the DVD were engaging (especially those with Congo Powers), but how can you have a proper documentary of a musical group with no real footage of the group? Ninety six minutes is just too long to watch people talking about the band. The scattered two-second shots of the band on stage about to start a song only make it worse, because for a split second you think ""finally!"" - and then it cuts to commentary. At least there could have been some interviews with JLP (there are some on YouTube so you know they exist). And the ""special appearance"" by Lemmy Kilmister was a tease - he was talking about the music business in general without any reference to JLP or the Gun Club, so I suspect it may have been file footage.

In conclusion, if you are a die-hard Gun Club enthusiast and can get this for less than $20, go for it. Otherwise - pass.",1383436800,9,859,4.36875
8343258,4,B001UB3IC0,"I sincerely enjoyed this as a doc. The people behind it managed to get everyone to participate they could, which is commendable considering how many people were in or around the band.

But part of the problem is so few people were around Pierce or the Gun Club for extended periods long enough to really explain the whole picture and their whole career. A movie of everyone explaining their departures/firings from the Gun Club in detail would have made a great bonus feature!

I understand there not being any music since that can be expensive (and considering how many deals the Gun Club had, a major headache to clear). And to their credit, the were honest enough to mention it in the descriptions and on the cover. But without music, the price point just seems a little expensive.

Buy if you're a big fan, but avoid if you're someone who's just a little curious.",1377734400,3,867,4.616883116883117

""****"" (four stars)

Ghost On The Highway: A Portrait of Jeffrey Lee Pierce & the Gun Club

French Fan Club Films & Powell Factory Films

Against all odds, the mayhem-packed tragedy of Jeffrey Lee Pierce is told by his long-suffering band-mates.

Kris Needs listens and weeps.

There's never been a proper documentary about the Gun Club, the apocalyptic punk-blues death party started in late-70s Los Angeles by Jeffrey Lee Pierce, who suffered a fatal brain haemorrhage in 1996 at the age of 37. Ghost On The Highway holds no pretensions to be the ultimate record. Director and long-time fan Kurt Voss, converted after witnessing Pierce get a kicking while supporting the Cramps in 1981, unashamedly believes that the group, particularly their doomed leader, are, `still in much need of more myth-making...My goal is to proselytize and leave the autopsy report stuff for later'.

This he achieves as band members and friends relate the often harrowing story of the phenomenal talent who exploded into the world with 1981's seminal Fire Of Love album before embarking on a lifelong drugs `n' booze-fuelled career kamikaze, though still managing to create incandescent masterworks like Miami, The Las Vegas Story and Mother Juno.

Pierce's savagely-haunting confessionals and narcotic love songs explored America's dark underbelly hotwired to the eternal artery of the blues. A hopeless romantic, when sober he was an endearingly-passionate sweetheart obsessed with William Burroughs, Blondie and free jazz. Drunk he became a belligerent nightmare, prompting the wrong Jim Morrison comparisons.

Former collaborators Kid Congo Powers, Ward Dotson, Terry Graham, Jim Duckworth and Dee Pop tell their leader's story with rueful humour, exasperated anger or sometimes tears. Their disparate characters engage throughout the 98 minutes, particularly lifelong friend and Gun Club mainstay Powers, who Pierce taught to play guitar, and long-suffering drummer Graham, who confesses, `There were many years I had this recurring dream of hitting him in the face with a golf club'. Over a quarter-century later they smile grimly, even disbelievingly, through tales of wilfully antagonistic gigs, cowardly dismissals and missing money, incredulous that Pierce managed to demolish three Gun Club lineups which could have gone on to much greater things, although still remembering other nights when magic happened.",1333670400,7,3175,5.435845213849287
