5787542,3,B00DBPBQD6,"In the small town of Suddenly, Tod (Ray Liotta) is the town drunk and deputy. He likes the widow Ellen (Erin Karpluk) and is respected by her son Pidge (Cole Coker). Ellen tolerates Tod because he spends time with Pidge.

As it turns out, the President is going to stop in town. Members of some super secret society plan on assassinating the president from Ellen's house. Even when the plots are together, things seem like two films. There is the personal aspects and the dirty little secret why Tod drinks. The secondary aspect is the guys who are planning to kill the President.

Ray Liotta, who I normally don't like, did a fairly decent job as someone who drinks too much, the stagger, the glassy eyes, etc.

Note: The film credits spells Liotta's character name as ""Tod"" while IMDB lists it as ""Todd."" I'm still trying to figure out ""Pidge"" which sounded like Mitch, Bidge, Pitch, and something I call my dog.

The film never grabbed me. Except for the swearing, I felt I was watching something made for TV. An action film for those who like a little Mayberry drama tossed in.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity. Talk of rape.",1378512000,,1138,4.586206896551724
5787543,3,B00DBPBQD6,"""Today is a glorious day. Today I get to kill the President."" Barren (Purcell) has become disillusioned with the President and his policies. He devises a plan that will help deal with his problem. Him and his accomplices pose as secret service agents and take up a position in a family's house that has the perfect sniping position. When a local cop (Liotta) shows up Barren's perfect plan starts to unravel. Uwe Boll's trademark seems to be lame movies with poor acting but decent action. This one had both. The movie itself isn't really that terrible but it is also fairly generic and predictable. There have been many movies about trying to stop a presidential assassin and I usually like movies with that plot. I did like this one too but it's not one of the better ones and I don't think I would watch this again. I have not seen the original with Frank Sinatra but I would guess that one is better. I could be wrong though. Overall, nothing terrible but nothing amazing either. I give it a C+",1378425600,2,998,4.519337016574585

It will be interesting to see if the remake can compare. The five stars are for the original, which had bursts of violence above what was usual for a fifties film. John Baron (Sinatra) was a psychotic, kicked out of the military for liking the killing too much. In one scene, he tells the young boy, one of his captives, that he won the silver star.

5787545,2,B00DBPBQD6,"I gave this 2 stars only because I watched it to the end.
Some movies just shouldn't be remade.
I like Ray Liotta and Michael Pare but they couldn't save this dog from bad direction and writing.
They went out of their way to try and add action to a movie in which it doesn't work.
The original 1954 version had a better script, direction and acting. And if you watch it, go for the B&W version not the colorized version.
The original was more a tense dialog movie. This was done well by Frank Sinatra, Sterling Hayden and James Gleason. The portrayal of Pidge as a younger kid rather than a teenager worked better as well, frankly the little kids' (Kim Charney) acting was better then Cole Corker's.
This newer film also seemed determined to make a political statement against right wing patriots. The 1954 film was not as obvious; we don't know who the president is, it could have been Truman just as easily as Eisenhower, he is never identified. The motivation of the assassins appears to be nothing deeper than money and the employers are not identified. In 1954 the assumption would be a communist source.

Do yourself a favor skip this one and go for the original",1391817600,7,1168,4.535545023696683

5787550,2,B00DBPBQD6,"""House of the Dead"" director Uwe Boll and ""The Killing Machine"" scenarist Raul Inglis have appropriated Lewis Allen's presidential assassination thriller ""Suddenly"" (1954) with Frank Sinatra and updated it.  Basically, Boll and Inglis have preserved the basic plot, but they have altered the characters.  Nobody is truly the equivalent of Sterling Hayden's hero.  Hayden was the sheriff, while Ray Liotta is cast as a County Deputy rather than the chief.  Erin Karpluk shares little in common with Nancy Gates as the anxious mother-in-jeopardy. The filmmakers have added years to the character of Pidge, too.  In the original, Pidge was elementary age, but here he is a teenager.  Ellen hated guns in the original, but she wound up using a gun to save the day.  In the remake, Ellen makes no comments about violence and guns.  Ellen's father in the remake is a goofy home-repair screw-up, while James Gleason in the 1954 version was a retired Federal agent.  Boll has made a respectable thriller with a top-notch cast. Indeed, the performances are all first-rate with Liotta and Dominic Purcell going toe-to-toe for top acting honors.  Clocking in at 90 minutes, ""Suddenly"" isn't bad, but neither is it above-average, thoroughly ordinary but inoffensive.  The exterior scenery is majestic.

Right-wing assassins take over a house high enough above the town of Suddenly so they can shoot an Obama presidential look-a-like.  Ray Liotta plays an alcoholic small town deputy with a dark secret.  Liotta is as close as you can get to a hero in this complicated yarn.  Altogether, Frank Sinatra version of ""Suddenly"" released in 1954 surpasses this polished but pale rehash.  The good citizens of the small town of Suddenly are surprised when they learn that the President is passing through town.  The town fathers stage a reception for him.  Meantime, bogus Federal Agents Barren (Dominic Purcell of ""Prison Break""), Conklin (Michael Par of ""The Lincoln Lawyer""), and Wheeler (Tyron Leitso) take over the house belojnging to Ellen (Erin Karpluk) who has a son named Pidge (Cole Coker) who likes to make up tall tales.  When the film unfolds, Deputy Reed (Ray Liotta) gets into a fight over his gambling debts.  Reed's chief rubs him the wrong way about his drinking problem and then demands that he surrender his gun and gunbelt.  Our trio of villains stashes Ellen, her son, and her father in the basement.  The power has gone out at Ellen's house because her home repair father has shorted out the electrics.  Eventually, Reed comes to check up on Ellen and all hell breaks loose.  The villains capture Reed and recapture Pidge and the President steps up to the podium to speak as the assassins take aim.

5787552,1,B00DBPBQD6,"We have always had some TV and movies that were firstly political propaganda, and secondly entertainment. Maybe not as bad as the North Koreans, but essentially the same idea. This movie has a President who looks exactly like Barack Obama and cold blooded assassins who say exactly what Obama's political opponents say. Without making any political statement of my own,this movie can be objectively labeled hard-core propaganda, probably paid for by the DNC. And that wouldn't be so bad if the movie didn't suck so badly. But it was probably shot in a day. The acting and dialogue is awkward and unbelievable (And I usually enjoy Ray Liotta movies).  It was obviously conceived as quick and dirty vehicle for the DNC message. Yes, it was as horrible as any infomercial you've ever seen.  Of course it's a remake of a classic film from 1954.

8591419,2,B00DBPBQD6,"Oh, how the mighty have fallen. Uwe Boll, who at one time won a Career Achievement Razzie Award for his inept directing career, has now gone from making truly atrocious films that actually play in theaters to making direct-to-video efforts that aren't total embarrassments. The improvement in his work is in part due to working with a better cast and in part to selecting better source material, both of which are on display in the 2013 effort, Suddenly.

If that name sounds familiar, Suddenly is a remake of a Frank Sinatra near classic film noir from the 1950s that is memorable for being Sinatras only out-and-out villainous performance. The plot of Bolls remake is similar to the Sinatra original, even down to the names of the characters. The President of the United States will be making a brief visit to the small town of Suddenly, CA, and a group of assassins led by Baron (Dominic Purcell in the Sinatra role) pose as Secret Service agents checking residences in the area for threats. In reality, they are looking for a good vantage point for Baron, an expert marksman, to take a shot at the President. The fake agents take a local family hostage as they prepare for their attempt, unaware that the towns deputy sheriff Todd Shaw (Ray Liotta) has been trying, with little success, to date the woman whos being held hostage.

The Sinatra film was little more than an hour long and built suspense masterfully as the captured lawman engaged in a duel of wits with Sinatras assassin, who was simply a highly competent hired gun. But for some reason, Boll and screenwriter Raul Inglis felt they needed to expand the original, primarily by introducing some extraneous storylines. Liottas deputy is now the town drunk, and a near laughing stock down to his last chance as a lawman, for reasons that are revealed in the films supposedly big dramatic climax. I give Liotta credit for not phoning in a performance here, but the soap operatic elements simply don't work.

Neither does the political message in this version of Suddenly. While the reason for ordering a hit on the President were never explained in the original, the remake feels it necessary to create a shadowy conspiracy called the Committee, which intends to start making things right again in this country. And, since the President, who appears in the last few minutes of the film, is an Obama lookalike, the nature of what the Committee actually wants is pretty easy to guess.

When Suddenly stays closest to the storyline of the original film instead of going off on political or melodramatic tangents, its a moderately competently crafted thriller, albeit with the low production values you would expect from a bare bones production (ironically, the Sinatra original was also pretty much of a B-movie in terms of budget). There is a decent amount of action, including a final showdown between Baron and Shaw, but overall, its about at the level you would expect on a typical hour of a TV cop show. The acting is also typical for a Boll film, which means that the actors (mostly little-known Canadians), are left to their own devices a lot, leading to wildly varying levels of performance. While Liotta restrains his goofiest film tendencies, Purcell is about as stoic as he ever gets, and thats saying a lot.

The best thing I can say about this version of Suddenly is that its not terrible, and if the political messaging doesnt bother people, they won't feel that their time has been completely wasted. But, on the other hand, it makes little sense to invest money in watching this inferior remake when the much better Sinatra original is available on Amazon Prime (or very cheaply on DVD). Uwe Boll may have graduated from terrible to mediocre as a director, but he hasn't suddenly become a genius.",1520467200,,3772,4.805855161787365

8591425,2,B00DBPBQD6,"Remaking classic films is admirable. It is a great way to introduce a new generation to the classic stories of our culture, when it's done correctly. Suddenly is a remake of the 1954 Frank Sinatra film by the same name, starring Ray Liotta as Tod Shaw. Shaw is an aging, alcoholic cop in a small town, who is at the end of his career. One day, rather suddenly, the President makes a surprise stop in the town where he works. As they make the final preparations for the visit, Shaw comes to realize that a local family has been taken hostage, and the President is in danger. In remaking a film like this, producers should only consider going one of two ways. Either make it a true remake, set in 1954, or adapt the story to fit the times, Uwe Boll did neither. This remake is very much the same story, but takes place in 2013. This is problematic, as it makes the story somewhat unbelievable. There are better ways of doing things, modern technology, many different things the story could have and should have changed, but it didn't. As for Ray Liotta, he's probably the last person I would cast to reprise Frank Sinatra. When Sinatra made this film, he was 39 years old, Liotta is 58 years old, and he more than acts his age. Are we really supposed to believe that at nearly 60 years old, Liotta can even attempt to take on a beast like Dominic Purcell? The whole thing was just way off target, but I am giving it 2 1/2 stars, because of Purcell. This guy just gets better with every performance, weather it's the lovably naive escaped con or the scary cold assassin, Purcell is always believable and fun to watch. Suddenly was never that great of a story to begin with, but for some reason Uwe Boll had a connection to it, and decided to remake it, but the way it is done makes it almost comical and anything but a fitting tribute to the work of Frank Sinatra.",1437264000,,1861,4.36599423631124

The 54 version has long since been in the public domain and there are some pretty horrible copies out there. I am extremely lucky to have a pristine version of the Sinatra movie. That being said, I caught the Liotta remake on Netflix last night and I did enjoy it. The remake stayed pretty close to the original. The only let down was that you didn't get to know who was behind the planned assassination. Dominic Purcell is an absolute menace.",1431993600,,567,4.461538461538462

I watched because Ray Liotta was in it.  A mistake on my part.  It was truly sad to seem him give such a bad performance in such a bad movie.  The other actors are not actors; they are simply people selected to read some really horrible lines.  Along the way, we get some not-too-subtle messages about how the armed forces folk were dumped on in Iraq and how the country is going down the tubes.  I could accept these messages if they were only delivered with more vigor and a bit more intelligent.",1391817600,,669,4.434426229508197
