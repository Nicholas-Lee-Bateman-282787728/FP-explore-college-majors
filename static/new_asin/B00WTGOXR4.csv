All of the DVD's in the order would not display the video portion of the episodes. Only the audio. This was true on my Magnavox Digital Recorder/ Player and my Symphonic DVD Player. I saw a review describing the exact same problem from anther customer. I sent the order back and they sent a new order with the same results. After many contacts with Amazon customer service I received the following reply indicating the following: ""The Survivor dvds ordered are DVD-R discs titles that don't play on certain DVD devices, including recorders, DVD/VHS combo players, and PC drives.'
I replied that DVD-R discs as well as all previous Survivor orders over many years have and continue to play on these devices.

I don't know why, or if, Amazon changed the way these discs are made, but it seems they may not play on older model DVD players.

I don't know what Amazon means by a problem with their inventory, but I'm thinking of trading in my current copies for new ones if and when these seasons are back in stock.

7153918,5,B00WTGOXR4,"Boston Rob dominated this season from the beginning to the end and his performance was the most dominant by any player in the history of the game of Survivor. Like Jeff Probst said, he played a perfect game. Boston Rob played a great strategic game and learned from his past mistakes on Survivor All Stars and Survivor Heroes versus Villains. In my opinion, Boston Rob is the greatest survivor of player of all time, with no disrespect to Sandra who one twice. However, Boston Rob is strategic, clever, physical and has great survival skills. He has the best all around game out of any former survivor and he is also charming and funny. Another great thing about this season is that Boston Rob provides a lot of memorable moments like he always does when he plays. This season is certainly one of the best with Boston Rob's dominance, the redemption island twist, and some other great survivor characters who made it a memorable season, Matt and Phillip. I would rank this season fourth right behind Survivor All Stars, Survivor Heroes versus Villains, and Survivor Australia.",1442102400,2,1076,4.821621621621621

Rob Mariano proved that if you can be a strong tribe leader you can make it to the end and win even if it took him 4 times to do it. Had he been on Zapatera, it might have been a little more difficult but I think he still might have been able to pull it off. My hat is off the Rob, who I believe is the greatest tribe leader to ever compete in the game of Survivor.

8714186,4,B00WTGOXR4,"Starting with this season of Survivor, a lot of people who bought the DVDs said they won't play on their DVD players. I have a newer HDTV and a newer HD DVD player so I took a chance and it does play for me on the new player, but when I tried it in my old DVD player and in my DVDR, I got sound but no picture on the episodes, while the extras played normally. So these discs do work, but only if you have relatively up-to-date electronics. Also, the sound quality on these discs is strange. It's normal on the extras but I had to turn the volume up three times as high as normal on the episodes. I don't know why Amazon changed how they produce these MOD DVDs, but it is not an improvement. Finally, the extras aren't so great. Almost all the episodes contain a secret scene, but it's usually a scene from a different episode. People who were voted off two episodes earlier might be in these scenes. They also show all the tribal council votes, but without the player's comments as they're voting, making it sort of pointless. Minus one star for the technical aspects.

As for the season as a whole, it probably depends on how much you like Boston Rob. I like him, so I liked this season. I've seen a lot of grumbling on forums about how the season was rigged to help him out, but that really wasn't the case. He came into the game with a huge target on his back, and all but two members of his tribe were gunning for him from the start. In response, he either voted those people out or turned them into allies. He played a flawless strategic and social game, which some find boring to watch because there are no real upsets, but I thought there was enough suspense in seeing whether he could maintain that constant control over the game -- especially because the Redemption Island twist threw an extra wrench in the proceedings that he had to maneuver around. By contrast, there's Russell, and I won't spoil it for you, but if you're not a Russell fan, you'll like seeing how it goes for him. The rest of the cast is pretty good too, with three of them returning in later seasons: Andrea, who made a decent showing despite being thrown under the bus by her dumb ally Matt; Special Agent Phil Shepherd and his pink underpants, who was best described by Rob: ""He's not as crazy as he's pretending to be. He is a little bit crazy though""; and poor Francesca/Francqueska/Francesqua who was fun but doomed. Other underrated players who would probably do well if they were to return were Stephanie (she was Russell, but in young, cute girl form), Ashley (a challenge beast), David (a good strategist but on the wrong side of the numbers, and Ralph (actually Ralph was a terrible player, but very likeable, so bring back Ralph!) All-in-all a good season, especially for Rob fans -- or Phil fans for that matter -- but probably not a Top Ten of the series.",1529625600,,2850,4.3977272727272725
