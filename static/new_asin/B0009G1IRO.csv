8060100,4,B0009G1IRO,"This DVD does a good job looking at Springsteen's younger days, growing up into fame. However, beware that, since this is not an official Bruce Springsteen DVD, there are no original Springsteen interviews and no Springsteen music. There is one pre-recorded interview with Bruce from the 80s. A few of Springsteen's closest friends, including Vini Lopez, are interviewed, and they provide good insight.",1209686400,,402,5.396825396825397
8060101,2,B0009G1IRO,"Cheap doccumentary, that's the truth here.

At least it's a honest merchandise, because it makes it clear that this is totally unauthorized. By saying that, you know for sure that there will be no Bruce's original music nor any interviews with E-Street Band actual members.",1185753600,,273,5.066666666666666
8060102,5,B0009G1IRO,"I really enjoyed this DVD, and even though there was no music, it was packed full of interviews from those that knew Springsteen and concentrated on his early years when he was gigging in local clubs. The DVD also has an extras bit with a full discography! Well worth a watch!",1139443200,2,276,4.431372549019608
8060103,2,B0009G1IRO,I was disapointed to find no Bruce music to be heard anywhere in this program. The interviews are ho-hum at best and include people of very little substance who offer nothing of note who maybe sat behind him in school or heard him play once. The quality is low and strikes me as a high school production rather than a full blown documentary. The interview with Bruce is not done by the producers but is file footage of a mid to late 70's Bruce. There are many great resources for Bruce material out there and I recommend the Marsh Bio. Pass this one by.,1126656000,11,553,4.326923076923077
8060104,2,B0009G1IRO,"While some of the interviewees have compelling ideas about Bruce's music, this pseudo-documentary is low-rent and not terribly informative (especially if you have read the Marsh text). Bruce's ""participation"" is limited to minimal footage from an interview he gave backstage circa-""Darkness"" (my guess). Instead of revealing content, you have has-been after has-been telling tired stories about their brush with greatness. Tinker, in particular, drinks openly during his self-serving responses--hardly a flattering presentation considering his legitimate role in growing Springsteen's regional fame. As the previous reviewer pointed out, the absence of Springsteen's music only adds to the tedium. Granted, for die-hards, there is a certain thrill involved with anecdotal info, no matter how trivial. But anybody else would be better served by Marsh's book or any number of actual interviews that Springsteen has given over the years.",1124064000,10,934,5.875
8060105,3,B0009G1IRO,"If you're a Bruce fan this a real treat.  I found out a lot about the man in this documentary that I didn't have a clue about.  Various people comment on Bruce's early days and tell some good stories.  Vini Lopes former band member particularly relates some good inside stories and for a fan this is very informative.

Since this is unauthorised there's no Springsteen music in the background and that's definately a miss.  Still it's interesting from a fan's perspective, it comes recommended if you're a huge Bruce fan.  I don't think others will be all that excited.",1122940800,17,569,4.696969696969697
