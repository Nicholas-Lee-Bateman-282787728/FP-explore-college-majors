4444813,5,B004Q0VR52,I have been a fan of the Virginian since it was on TV  years ago it is great to see that it has been brought back on D.V.D. If you want to travel back in time watch it you'll enjoy it.,1305936000,3,184,3.4878048780487805
4444814,5,B004Q0VR52,"In my opinion, The Virginian was the best Western on TV at the time.  For a 90 min format, the stories were interesting, and they never seemed to ""drag"" on.  Timeless Media has done a great job with these DVDs and I'm looking forward to the rest of the seasons.  The only negative I have, is that they don't have a listing anywhere of the episodes on the set.  You have to look at the DVD and if it's in the player, it's kinda hard to do that unless you stop the dvd and go to the menu.  Other than that, they're great!  Excellent quality, super clear and a lot of fun to watch.  I love the interviews that come with each set. It's always fun to hear the back story.  Maybe at some point we can get a ""blooper"" dvd as well?  ;-)  Thanks Timeless Media.",1305590400,15,752,4.054421768707483
4444815,5,B004Q0VR52,I have watched the first 3 seasons of the Virginian and I'm eagerly awaiting the 4th and so on. The stories have depth to them and the acting is superb. The excellent quality and packaging adds to the set and makes it worth every penny!!!,1305504000,6,238,4.311111111111111
4444816,5,B004Q0VR52,I enjoyed this along with the rest of the shows.  I highly recommend it along with the rest of the seasons starting with season one.  I found a dress in the show that Betsy wore and I was able to make one similar to it for myself.,1304467200,5,230,3.872340425531915
4444817,5,B004Q0VR52,"This is the BEST western on TV. Not because of The Viginian, but because it had so many gifted writers with so much to tell.  It is a pleasure to watch the entire series, keep it coming.",1303430400,11,186,4.027027027027027
4444818,4,B004Q0VR52,"I love The Virginian mostly because it is a 90 minute show and they have so many talented actors although Doug McClure was my favorite. I will say #4 season is not as good as the first 3. The story line is not as good, many of the regulars are not present & most of all McClure was seldom in it. It was on from 1962 to 1971 But I do not know just when McClure was diagnosed with ling cancer. He too was extremely hansome, tall, blonde hair & a beautiful smile. He passed away before he was 60....very sad information for me. I do believe he could have been an outstanding actor as it was all so natural. I will continue to get the DVDs even though I was not that fond of #4. I am sure Amazon will have them all  Amazon is a good company to work with. Do not ignore The Virginian because it is only #4 that ia not that great.",1494892800,2,824,3.934131736526946

4444821,2,B004Q0VR52,"I found the show had changed a lot by them having new actors, the replacement for Lee J. Cobb is not as good a actor as Lee is also they let the young guy, Gary Clarke go also and his replacement was not very good and the girl that replaced Lee young daughter was not that good. Then a lot of the stories were not about the ranch and didn't have the one main charter that was left, Dan Durura. I didn't think a lot of the stories were not that good and didn't make much drama.",1488931200,,476,3.917525773195876

4444838,5,B004Q0VR52,"My husband and I used to watch The Virginia on television on the Western Channel.  One day after the new year, we discovered that it was no longer on the Western Channel and we could not find it anywhere.  It is a great western series and we missed it so much that we bought the entire series, ordered it on Amazon.  We now have ten of them, ten on each disc.  LOVE THESE.  They are wonderful entertainment and great for children since they have no sex illicit or otherwise and no foul language.  The violence is mild and justified.

Buy these for your home library.  Great acting and great stories of the West.

4444839,5,B004Q0VR52,"This season completes our collection of a most wonderful series.  What a treasure and with grateful thanks to Timeless Media for their restoration. We haven't watched all the shows yet---trying to savor them, but we have noticed a few darker episodes as had been mentioned in earlier reviews.  That changes nothing however because the stories are wonderfully written and beautifully acted.  A world of Thanks to all those responsible for this legacy.",1440028800,,450,5.222222222222222
4444840,5,B004Q0VR52,"There are so many good episodes in the first half of the season that you can pass the fact that the second half was not as strong. The show had to deal with the departure of ROBERTA SHORE and LEE J.COBB and their momentary repleacements DIANE ROTER and JOHN DEHNER.If the beginnings of MORGAN STARR in his first episode as the owner of the SHILOH ranch made a good impression, it's as though the authors didn't know what to do with him afterwards. As for JENNIFER,judge GARTH's niece,i liked her even if she didn't have the charm that BETSY had. Overall,THE VIRGINIAN was still the best western serie of the era. I have more fun watching THE VIRGINIAN than the others westerns like GUNSMOKE,BONANZA or THE BIG VALLEY.",1434326400,,717,4.609375

4444857,5,B004Q0VR52,"The 4th Season was a time of change in the show. None the less, it remains one of the very best Seasons as well as very best shows ever on television. Different writers, different directors, different producers all bring their own slant to productions. It had to have been tough though, with the departure of  supremely talented Lee J. Cobb and sweet, gifted Roberta Shore. In spite of the major cast changes, it remains one of my favorite Seasons in this outstanding show.",1404518400,,473,4.698795180722891

4444863,4,B004Q0VR52,"The Virginian is my favorite television Western. As many reviews have said, each 75-minute episode is more like a Western movie of the week with familiar characters as well as great guest stars. This show was a cut above other TV Westerns in terms of its acting, location photography, wonderful music scores, and intelligent screenplays. For television it was a big-budget production, and it shows.  And Timeless does a solid job with these sets, providing good packaging and very good picture quality.

This season has a lot of highlights, but there were also a lot of bumps along the road in the 4th season. Early in the season Roberta Shore wanted to leave the show, and so her character Betsy Garth suddenly got married and was gone. And then in the middle of the season Judge Garth, played by Lee Cobb, also left the show. Garth's first successor was a cold and hard character named Morgan Starr, who was well played by veteran actor John Dehner, but the Starr character just didn't seem right for the show and was gone by the end of the season. Finally, there were a large number of grim stories this season. Some of these are well done, but the mood shifts down a bit from the more upbeat first three seasons. A lot of these changes came about because one of the founding producers of the show, Frank Price, was promoted to the executive suites and turned over producing duties on The Virginian to Norman Macdonnell, who had previously produced Gunsmoke and other shows. Again, it's still the best Western on TV, but it's sometimes a rocky road compared to the first three seasons.

About half of the episodes I thought were good to very good, including A Little Learning, The Claim, The Awakening, Ring of Silence, Jennifer, Show Me a Hero, The Dream of Savros Karas, The Laramie Road, The Horse Fighter, Letter of theLaw, Blaze of Glory, Long Ride to Wind River, The Inchworm's Got No Wings At All, Morgan Starr, Ride A Cock Horse to Laramie Cross, and The Mark of a Man. And even the episodes I didn't care for as much often had compelling performances and interesting ideas.

The season again has some great guest stars, including a very young Kurt Russell, Susan Oliver (who also starred in the Star Trek classic The Menagerie), William Shatner, Royal Dano, James MacArther (Danno on Hawaii 50), Charles Bronson, George Kennedy, Leonard Nimoy, Leslie Nielsen, Simon Oakland, Telly Savalas, and many, many others.

And finally, the most important stars of the show stayed with it, including James Drury, who does an outstanding job in the title role, Doug McClure, who brings great humor and charm to the show as Trampas, Clu Gulager, who has some standout episodes as Sherriff Ryker this season, and Randy Boone as sensitive singing cowboy with a charming accent. Diane Roter, who plays Jennifer Sommers, also has some good episodes in her brief role on the show.

All in all, this is is still a must-see season of this classic show, and comes highly recommended. And although the changes are not all for the better, it certainly keeps the show fresh and makes you expect the unexpected. Finally, they sure don't make 'em like this anymore. The Virginian is a quality show in every way,  and even the lesser episodes of The V are better than most of the stuff you'll see on TV today.",1379030400,17,3295,4.700173310225304
4444864,5,B004Q0VR52,"I look forward almost everyday to seeing my westerns. It can be Gunsmoke, The Virginian, Have Gun Will Travel or any good western. I totally enjoy them all.

4444866,5,B004Q0VR52,"We have enjoyed the early episodes we have watched so far of season four almost as much as we have enjoyed the previous three seasons, except for the changes of cast members, we believe that the show was so much better with Lee J Cobb, Gary Clark and Roberta Shore. We were pleased to see Clu Gulager join the cast as we have been big fans of his for many years. The acting, storyline, quality of the colour and sound makes for very good family veiwing. At this stage I am not sure if we will purchase any more seasons, we will see how the balance of season four goes.

4444880,4,B004Q0VR52,"Here are capsule impressions of episodes aired during the bumpy path of season four.

A LITTLE LEARNING -- Guest stars, Albert Salmi, Susan Oliver
Illiterate, trouble-prone hayseed creates dangerous misunderstandings when he approaches an attractive schoolteacher. Initially unpromising episode turns suspenseful and ultimately gripping. Salmi makes his inarticulate character quite moving, and child actor Craig Hundley earns high marks for an emotional scene with Drury. Bruce Dern is meaner than ever as Oliver's possessive former husband.

THE CLAIM -- Guest star, William Shatner
Trampas quits Shiloh in a huff and goes gold prospecting with a shiftless buddy and a derelict. Obvious rehash of ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre,"" with McClure, Strother Martin and Shatner channeling Tim Holt, Walter Huston and Humphrey Bogart. Captain Kirk beams out of Bogey's shadow with a striking performance. The crew of the Enterprise was no stranger to Shiloh; Leonard Nimoy and James Doohan also appeared during season four.

THE AWAKENING -- Guest star, Glenn Corbett
Betsy Garth falls in love with an ex-minister who sides with miners during a labor dispute. Roberta Shore bids a graceful farewell to Shiloh in memorable episode. Blue-eyed heart throb Corbett performs with becoming restraint, making him a fit partner for the modest Shore. Betsy's swan song was an island of tranquility in the choppy seas of season four, which would only get more turbulent.

RING OF SILENCE -- Guest stars, Earl Holliman, Joyce Van Patten, Royal Dano
A stage with Sheriff Emmett Ryker aboard is waylaid by Mexican marauders bent on vengeance against a passenger. Character-driven tale, reminiscent of the John Ford classic ""Stagecoach,"" becomes a philosophical struggle pitting Clu Gulager's passionate commitment to justice against Holliman's cynical disregard. Good acting, especially by the alert, tightly focused Van Patten, and a bracing climactic shootout compensate for preachiness.

JENNIFER -- Guest star, James MacArthur
Judge Garth's lonely niece moves to Shiloh and is miserable until becoming attached to a young fiddlefoot who is actually a wanted killer. The eternally boyish MacArthur is in top form in deft episode that introduces Diane Roter's character to the series. Her Jennifer is appealingly shy and vulnerable, but the series' writers could think of little more for the complicated character to do, and Roter was shunted into the background of most of her remaining episodes.

SHOW ME A HERO -- Guest star, Richard Beymer
Trampas becomes unwillingly involved in a small town's struggle to preserve its integrity against the forces of corruption. Tired plot is refreshed by observant direction by Leon Benson and thoughtful acting by McClure and Beymer. Character actor Douglas Fowley is a joy to watch as a dignified old sheriff on his last legs. This episode was one of two that season scored by the great composer Bernard Herrmann, of ""Psycho"" and ""Vertigo"" fame.

THE HORSE FIGHTER -- Guest star, Harry Guardino
An aging bronco buster generously mentors Randy but is tempted to turn outlaw. Guardino, who usually played big-city roughnecks, is amazingly real as the fading horsebacker. Randy Boone's mild-mannered character has his edgiest scene in the series, decking the astonished Drury during a bunkhouse meltdown. This episode was as good as it got in season four.

NOBODY SAID HELLO -- Guest star, James Whitmore
The parasitic former despot of Andersonville prison is determined to sink his hooks into Judge Garth. Ridiculous story, haltingly directed, makes a monkey out of Whitmore. Only the foolproof Cobb, Drury and McClure emerge from the muck unscathed. Cobb's imminent decision to bolt the series makes more sense after viewing this turkey.

MORGAN STARR -- Guest star, John Dehner
The gruff and demanding ways of Shiloh's new operator spark friction with The Virginian as a locust invasion looms. Robust episode builds to exciting climax, but Dehner's hardboiled character turned off viewers and was gone after a handful of episodes.

HARVEST OF STRANGERS -- Guest star, John Anderson
Morgan Starr and The Virginian try to quell racial animosity in Medicine Bow after a posse of heavily armed Canadian half-breeds hits town. Pointed attack on mindless bigotry is rare for a series that approached social issues with caution. But noirish, wind-tossed episode that strives for artistry as well as relevance founders. Flailing script is poorly plotted and tone-deaf, hamstringing the actors, including the normally surefooted Drury and Anderson.

RIDE A COCK-HORSE TO LARAMIE CROSS -- Guest star, Nita Talbot
Trampas encounters outlaws and hostile Indians while transporting two children to their mother. Disappointing episode, every bit as awkward as its title, saddles McClure with a twerpy child actor (Clint Howard) and an unresponsive leading lady (Talbot). The series was beginning to leak oil as it creaked toward the conclusion of season four. There would be big changes in season five.",1329264000,20,5013,5.389527458492975

These are shows the entire family can watch because of the decency, morality, humor, honesty -- and all the while in the great ol' west.  The horsemanship is superb.  James Drury and Doug McClure are great actors as are all on the series.  Can't say enough about how great this series is and the quality of these films is A+.  They have been faithfully restored to better than new quality.  I will leave these as a legacy to my family so that they can know how it used to be -- when kids and adults alike could gather in front of the television and be swept away into another era.  Better yet, they are left with the knowledge that good always wins out, even though the ending may not be what is desired.  If anyone is intereted, Doug McClure's family and many friends are signing a petition to enter him into the Cowboy's Hall of Fame.  Please consider signing as 'if he was not a real cowboy, than there ain't no such thing'.  [...]",1310428800,4,993,4.377049180327869

8437863,5,B004Q0VR52,"What a tumultuous season. There was the leaving of Judge Garth (Lee J. Cobb) and the replacement of Betsy's character (Roberta Shore). Cobb left just past the middle of the season. Most of the episodes after that focused on one or two of the main characters such as Trampas, Randy, or the Judge Garth replacement Morgan Star. Morgan Star was a character who was introduced about 4 episodes after Lee J. Cobb left. He created somewhat of a stir in the series. I felt that the series went downhill around the time that Lee J. Cobb left. This was Randy Boone's last season as well, man I miss his singing, he  had the greatest voice. Can't find his stuff on CD.  The writing just seemed to lack something and the stories became mundane. I am hoping that things pick up in the 5th season. It also seemed that the focus was off of Shiloh and onto anything else they could find. In one case a whole episode around Emmet the sheriff played by Clu Gulager. You might remember him as Billy The Kid in Pat Garret and Billy the Kid the series was called ""The Tall Man"" 75 episodes 1960-62.  It sells right here on Amazon of course. Now I like Clu Gulager and he makes a great sheriff in the Virginian, but the show is about or supposedly about Shiloh for the most part anyway. This half season seemed to veer away from Shiloh and focus elsewhere. Not that the Virginian has not done that before, but not for a whole half season in a row. Needless to say this season was a bit of a disappointment, but still I gave it 5 stars because it had a great first half of the season. Though, Lee J. Cobb was not really in that many episodes in the first half of the season either. However, the writing seemed better. Well, I will review the 5th after I watch it. Talk you all then.",1497916800,2,1760,4.2792792792792795
