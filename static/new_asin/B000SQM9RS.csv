8206454,4,B000SQM9RS,"I was pretty pleased with this DVD. It runs through the various katas at regular speed & again in slow motion, and also from different angles. There were only two issues I had - first, I would have liked it if it broke the routines down into segments, or at least focused in on the proper techniques for the more complex manuvers. They go through each kata from start to finish every time without explaining how to do the more difficult spins with the bo, kamas or tonfas. Also, the sword katas were surpisingly short by comparison, often consisiting of unsheathing, making a single cut and resheating.

I would still say this is a fine instructional video, although it seems to be geared more toward the intermediate/advanced crowd than to absolute beginners.",1206403200,4,760,4.757575757575758
