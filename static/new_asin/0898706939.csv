172010,5,0898706939,"This originally aired on CBS and often when books are adapted they lose a lot.  Fortunately this is not the case with BREDE. Diana Rigg is superb as a career woman who in later life chucks it all to join a Benedictine Abbey.  She is ably supported by Gwen Watford, Pamela Brown and Judi Bowker.  The scenes before she enters the Abbey are very very good.",970531200,11,354,4.333333333333333

172012,5,0898706939,"Faithful to the book.  Diana Rigg is superb in the leading roll.  Very moving, thought-provoking story of a woman entering a nunnery in later years and the young novitiate who idolizes her.",1373068800,,189,4.875
172013,1,0898706939,"I have no respect for a vendor who wants to make a 300% profit on a DVD. Amazon should set limits on the profit level set. This DVD cost $19.99 at the most when it was available, but greedy sellers take advantage of film aficionados
who wish to expand their library. Shame on all of you who engage in this despicable practice!",1370476800,13,326,4.274193548387097
172014,5,0898706939,"This would be compared to a woman's Brideshead Revisited in some regard.  A search for a greater and truer meaning in wrapped in a thoughtful and moving story of one woman's  journey that one could relate to on several levels.  It touches on different levels  the intangibles of life such as love, jealousy, greed, passion, and service.  I have found it to be a remarkable story that is totally well-written and acted.  Although a dated performance it holds up well.  A real favorite.",1362182400,,484,4.759036144578313
172015,5,0898706939,"I frist saw this movie thirty seven years ago and have been searching for it ever since. It's not as strong as the made for television movies of today, but in thirty five years the movies of today may be dated as much, if not more, as this one. This one has the advantage of being set a Bendictine monastery where the changing times have little effect. The movie isn't as moving as the book of the same title on which it is loosly based on. If you are fan of Dame Diana Riggs you may enjoy it, it is one of her more unusally works. The movie and the book tell two different stores of Bendictine nuns who happen to share the same name. I recommend both the movie and the book.",1351468800,2,675,4.082706766917293

172017,1,0898706939,"My book club read ""In This House of Brede"" and we were all gathered together anxious to see how the book was adapted into film.  Unfortunately we never got to find out because the tape was broken when we took it out of the sleeve.  Very disappointed.",1309305600,,250,4.297872340425532
172018,1,0898706939,"Having just read the novel, which was spectacular, I bought the DVD. Not only was the story unlike the book, but the acting was stilted, yes, even from the great Diana Rigg! All very disappointing.",1272240000,7,197,4.6571428571428575
172019,5,0898706939,"I understand a lot of you have been disapointed by the movie after having read the book. But isn't often the case with books translated to movies ?

I couldn't recommend this movie enough. It is just pure wondefull acting, many of the actors are no longer alive and none, part from Dame Diana Rigg were known to me. This leaves you thoughtfull about the amount of talent there is in the UK, whatever generation and this coming..........from a frenchman.

Every caracter is real and moving. How not be touched by Diana Rigg and Judy Bowker ? and denis Quilley and Nicolas Clay, both no longer alive and who play men who've lost the women they love to God. You'll see very touching display of love and no tight british upper lip there I assure you.

Dame Catherine ( Gwen Watford ) is the lady Abbot one would wish to have is a nun and Dame Agnes part ( Pamela Brown ) is not an easy one to play and I was very touched to see that Pamela Brown died the same year when she plays her own death in the movie.

I have ordered the book and I am looking foward to reading it.

By all means, do buy it and you'll enjoy a very beautifull and inspiring story played by very talented actors.

I am not a christian but this movie really touched my heart.",1172966400,3,1241,4.215189873417722
172020,1,0898706939,"Anyone who's read the book will be profoundly disappointed with this movie because all the significant issues [e.g., the reason for Philippa's avoidance of Elspeth (sister Cecily in the book, Sr. Joanna in the movie); the relationship with Elspeth & the choir director--forgot this sister's name, etc) never happen in the movie.  It's unbelievable that all these incidents were left out & the movie hooked (not wove!) tiny pieces of some incidents without giving any relationship or connection to the characters.  A fabulous story which would've been an epic movie was ruined to become absolutely NOTHING!!  I'm sorry I bought it & glad I didn't pay $45 or so for it.  What a waste of good acting by a very good cast, but even they couldn't save a movie which really has no story whatsoever!",1162252800,9,791,4.837037037037037
172021,1,0898706939,"I was so excited to receive this DVD as I had very recently completed reading the book.  It took perhaps 8-10 hours for me to finish the book... and this movie is 1 hour, 35 minutes. A total waste of time.

Where to begin - in the book there was magnificent DETAIL and character development. No such thing existed in the film. Nothing was developed.

Names were changed, nuns were completely omitted from the story, the financial mystery was never even hinted at,  the Chicago sculpture was never mentioned... so you didn't see the before/after Altar, or the repaired statue.

Other significant omissions: the cross with a genuine ruby, the way Phillipa's baby died ... for reasons I cannot imagine, the sex of the baby was even changed.  The death of the Phillipa's child introduced such a significant story line and did indeed altar Phillipa's recognition of what was a genuine accident.  For those of you who didn't read the book, the child was not killed by a car.

Even the Japanese representative had a different name. Why? Why not keep it Mr. Konishi?

This film was awful. It was shallow and pointless.  If I had just seen this movie, I would never even be tempted to read the book.  I read some reviews wherein viewers thought highly of this movie.  If they read the book they would bring their rating down a notch or two.  While reading the book, one has such a wonderful view and feeling of monastic life and the struggles experienced.  The introduction of the film just shows Mrs. Talbot gathering her things and getting out of dodge.  It doesn't give any background as to the success of this 40 year-old worldly woman's decision to enter Brede to become a nun.

I'm very confused as to why the movie was even made. The movie doesn't do the proper justice to Rumer Godden's beautiful story.",1139184000,17,1802,4.619496855345912
172022,3,0898706939,"I expected more of this film based on the topic and reviews.  Lizzie Darcy's review makes me suspect that the problem is in the film version rather than the underlying story. The film is just too glib, and doesn't seem to do justice to the important themes.

A 40-something, attractive, successful woman, apparently sincerely loved by a man wooing her, enters the convent after getting well-fortified with whisky and cigarettes. Just unraveling that much and it's aftermath would have been a worthy story. Eventually we learn ""the reason"" but it is not worked out very well. Nor is the process by which she comes to some resolution.

The building tension and then crisis between love and ""duty"" seemed promising but then seemed to almost magically melt away. Perhaps film just isn't the medium to paint the psychological and spiritual journey of contemplation.

For what I think is a much more engaging and thought-provoking, presentation, consider the book, The Hawk and the Dove: A Trilogy, by Penelope Wilcock, which you'll find here on Amazon.",1133827200,7,1047,5.034682080924855
172023,5,0898706939,"This is my favorite movie of all time.  The human and moral values expressed are of the very highest quality, while expressing all the humanity of man.

I wish every person in the world would see this film and realize the uplifting and world changing values.",1122508800,15,258,4.586956521739131
172024,4,0898706939,"This was a very interesting and touching story. There a few flaws,but I think one would have to be familiar with monastic life to spot them. Also, the film is very slow at the beginning, and one might lose interest before the plot is revealed. There are also some other odd things. For example, even though these nuns consecrate themselves to God and serve Him through prayer, God was only mentioned a few times. Their lives seemed mostly to consist of recreation,talking,and little  hard work. Also, in this film almost has a ""soap opera"" style  of acting and plot progression. I think melodrama is narrowly avoided in several scenes. All that said, it is an enjoyable film.",1118620800,14,675,4.760683760683761
172025,4,0898706939,"I have not read the book that this movie was based upon, but from the perspective of watching the movie by itself, I have to say that it was enjoyable! The location they chose for the filming was a perfect stage to tell this gentle story on, and the acting was pleasing. The characters are fleshed out fairly well, and the long time-span that they use to demonstrate the evolution of the main character's vocational life is a nice element.

It's difficult to speak in greater detail without giving too much away, but I can say that this movie is worth a rental for anyone who enjoys stories that focus on interaction, reflection and the dynamics of working and platonic relationships. The characters were authentic and flexible. A good nun movie!",1101600000,15,746,4.694656488549619
172026,5,0898706939,"IN THIS HOUSE OF BREDE is based on the novel written by that most talented author, Rumer Godden. She's also the author of BLACK NARCISSUS, another great novel that was made into a wonderful film.
This movie begins when an attractive, well-dressed woman leaves her home and travels to an abbey.  Phillipa Talbot (Diana Rigg) is a lady who has a successful career and a man who loves her, but is unhappy in that life, and enters the cloistered world of Benedictine nuns.
This is a beautiful production and Diana Rigg gives an outstanding performance as a very worldly and sophisticated person who chooses the religious life. The film is spellbinding and it's one of the few stories that really seem to take you into that unknown world where women become nuns. The relationships among the nuns and postulants were interesting and close friendships were not encouraged since everyone was to be loved equally. This story also shows how committed religious deal with their peers when jealousies arise and personalities are conflicted.
Yes, the book examines the characters more than the film, but that's always the case, and this is a marvelous production",1078531200,64,1149,4.953367875647668
172027,5,0898706939,"Having lived several years of my life as a religious and a Benedictine, I can state that, for under two hours long, this movie gives quite a good picture of religious life.  Nuns, like everyone else, are human beings with all the weaknesses that come with that.  Attachments and dependancies on one another do happen, although discouraged, and they aren't necessarily negative.  The strong can work through them.  And postulants and professed are allowed to speak to each other, at appropriate times of course.  Still, human beings are human beings!!  Overall a pretty good movie.",1075507200,25,580,5.052631578947368
172028,5,0898706939,"I have not yet read the book, so cannot compare the film to it. But, on its own, I found it so compelling and beautiful. This is what true devotion to Christ is about--love. And about trying and trying again until one does finally get it right. The nuns were all very real, in their demeanor, in their foibles, in their interactions and in their strivings to live a holy life. I watched ""The Nun's Story"" shortly after seeing ""In This House of Brede"" and was disgusted with its unrealistic portrayl of devotion to Christ, allowing selfishness and pride to triumph over self-giving love. ""In This House of Brede"" shows us a good deal of the beauty of the Catholic Church through the devotion of the religious life.",1067817600,13,713,4.578125
172029,3,0898706939,"The cast of players did a uniformly fine job of acting in this film, and the visual images of the monastery are lovely and very powerful. However, the plot line was very confusing, and neither the characters nor their relationships well-developed. Considering that the theme of learning to love was central, the puzzling and poorly drawn out depictions of the latter made everything seem haphazard.
Of course, one of the deficiencies from the beginning was that no real motive was given for Philippa's entrance to the monastery. Anyone with the smallest knowledge of convent life would know that neither Philippa's determined bluntness and superiority, let alone her clear expectation of preferential treatment, would be tolerated. Philippa seems to determine her own ways. Nor would the engaging Joanna's pleasant, if childish, ways be greeted with affection in a house of silence - for a postulant to even speak with a professed Sister is unlikely. There is no indication that Joanna's ""adopting"" Philippa as a ""mother"" is anything except innocent and sweet, yet meeting in ""their spot"" would never be tolerated, and Joanna's suddenly being cut off, without explanation, was beyond cruel.
If one knew the book well, and could have imagination fill in the blanks, this basically well-presented drama (which, sadly, becomes melodrama here and there) is enjoyable. However, it is very deficient in plot.",1018310400,10,1402,5.263392857142857
172030,5,0898706939,"Late one night, quite a few years ago, I saw this gem on the tube and enjoyed it so much, I vowed I'd eventually buy it.  After reading the book (which is fantastic, if religious cloistered life, complex characters, and picturesque details interest you at all) I was motivated to see it again. After buying it, I found it to be all I remembered,  and with the added texture provided by the book, the film was especially entertaining.  I grew up with Avenger re-runs and was not surprised to see ""Mrs. Peele"" had lost none of her appeal in those regal habits.",1013644800,11,558,4.450980392156863
7793366,5,0898706939,"For me, this is one of those comfort movies that I put in when I'm feeling down. I love the atmosphere of the film. It is an interesting story about a worldly woman living in London who can no longer deny her vocation to the religious life. It is a beautifully directed and acted film that transports you to England in the 1970's. I agree with the reviewer who said that it takes you into the world of the convent. That's what I love most about movies--their ability to take me out of my world and bring me along into another world for a few hours. If a film can do that, then I don't care so much about a lack of a plot or insufficient character development or whatever. And this film does that for me. It also shows the reality of what it means to live as a bride of Christ. And for a film about a Catholic convent, made in the 70's, one might expect some unorthodox shenanigans but I didn't detect anything like that. Rather, it seemed to celebrate the fullness and beauty of Catholic tradition. I just don't understand why the dvd is so much money. I actually bought it on VHS for a lot less. Someday maybe the price will come down for the dvd.",1517961600,,1148,4.199095022624435

For years, I have been searching websites to see if I could rent or buy it.
  When I saw it was available to purchase for $70.00, I thought It was time to buy it.
This movie was excellent! If you are interested in a woman who hears to the call to become
a nun, at a later time in her life, this is for you.
  Diana Rigg is excellent as the woman who is seeking the love of God, by becoming a nun.
Her struggle with the strict rules & interaction with other nuns is just one part of her story.
