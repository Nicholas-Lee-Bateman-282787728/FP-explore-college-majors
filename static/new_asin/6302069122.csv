420721,5,6302069122,"I often wonder what war-time audiences of the forties thought after leaving ""...Zombie"". Who could have been prepared for what lay behind the penny-dreadful title, surely one of the most poetic renderings of horror in genre history. Books have been written about its creator Val Lewton, and deservedly so. But what's on screen is traceable to the unerring pictorialism of director Jacques Tourneur, and his mastery of the fluid camera. Forget the plot and dialogue, too much of which is half-baked philosophising, and the performances which, excepting Sir Lancelot's lovely sing-song, are barely adequate. Focus instead on the lyrical scenes that unfold like an opium dream as the camera pulls back to reveal the poetic beauty of atmosphere. This is the perfect antidote for viewers max'ed out on the over-FXed, overly literal staple of today. ""Zombie"" shows that Tourneur grasped what Lewton and Hitchcock already knew - that the greatest fright repository is your own imagination.",1002240000,8,982,5.301282051282051

Well I did like this film but I don't agree that this film was what he\she claimed. It did have some decent atmosphere and was sort of creepy, but it wasn't as good or as creepy, atmospheric, scary or haunting as numerous horror films I have seen that were made up till 1943, nor was it as good as Eyes without a face under any of those categories. However it was well directed, had great acting, lighting, camera work, sets, and over all production values were excellent, but it was weak in the creepy, horrifying, haunting, scary department. Classics before it's time like Nosferatu, Dracula, Frankenstien, The Wolfman, etc. were simply better and creepier, moodier, and scarier.",1367884800,,1090,4.652849740932642
420744,5,6302069122,"Warning: this movie does not have hordes of the ravening undead who want to eat your brain (and your face).  Despite its goofy title, ""I Walked With A Zombie"" is actually more like ""Jane Eyre"" with a healthy dose of voodoo, magic and some melancholy ballads. Director Jacques Tourneur and producer Val Newton mingle together the scientific and the supernatural, along with striking visuals and strong acting.

Betsy Connell (Frances Dee) is hired to care for the wife of a sugar plantation owner on Saint Sebastian. She soon encounters her employer, the melancholy Paul Holland (Tom Conway), his strong-willed mother, his alcoholic brother... and finally his wife Jessica, a beautiful woman who seems to be permanently sleepwalking, courtesy of a bad tropical fever.

And after a short time, Betsy begins to fall in love with Paul, and becomes determined to heal his wife to make him happy. When insulin shock therapy fails, she learns that the power of the local voodoo priests might be able to break Jessica out of her permanent trance. But taking her to the voodoo houmfort reveals some startling secrets -- and may cause serious trouble for Paul and his family.

Jacques Tourneur really did a brilliant job with the atmosphere in this movie -- he fills it with eerie, haunting scenes such as the voodoo rituals, or the two women walking through a moonlit cane field with their wraps billowing in the wind. And there are some magnificently creepy moments, such as Betsy's encounter with a zombie standing in the fields.

The one downside is that Betsy and Paul's romance is... well, a bit hasty. They have two conversations and BOOM, they're passionately in love. However, the rest of the movie is beautifully subtle and carefully drawn, from the well-rounded depictions of the St. Sebastian locals to the question of whether the supernatural is truly involved (is Jessica really a zombie, or just brain-damaged?).

Frances Dee has the imposing task of playing the ""nice girl next door"" from Canada, and she's very convincing at it -- one of her most powerful scenes is when she decides to heal Jessica as an act of love to the woman's husband, Tim Conway and James Ellison do a solid job as a pair of brothers divided by Jessica, and Edith Barrett and Theresa Harris are even better as the stern Mrs. Rand and the friendly maidservant.

""I Walked With A Zombie"" is a more subtle, eerie kind of zombie movie, full of melancholy, ritual and beauty. Subtle and weird.",1283212800,2,2468,4.8479809976247035

As with other Lewton productions he got a way with a psychological thriller in the guise of a monster movie.  In the days of sailing ships a nurse (Frances Dee) is employed to go to San Sebastian to look after a plantation owner's wife (Christine Gordon.) She fined that her charge is more than just a victim of a disease that heft her without will. Turns out if you cut the wife she does not bleed. We all know what that means.

The true story is the relationship to man and wife, man and nurse, nurse and wife, brother and brother, brother and wife, need I say more? Could it mean that there is nothing supernatural or is love moving in mysterious natural.

Can this all be straightened out or is Jessica Holland the wife destined to be zomiated for ever and the nurse must learn to love from afar?

Yeah Lord pity them who are dead and give peace and happiness to the living.

420746,5,6302069122,"""There's no beauty here, only death and decay. Everything dies here. Even the stars."" -- Paul Holland

Val Lewton and Jacques Tourneur teamed up to create another atmospheric masterpiece in the horror genre in I Walked With a Zombie. RKO's Roy Webb once again supplied an appropriately moody score in this film of mystery and voodoo. Lewton proved that a big budget wasn't everything with a string of films made during the 1940's now highly regarded as some of the finest in the genre. Photographer J. Roy Hunt gets credit here as well, his use of black and white to create a mood both eerie and real a big plus.

Underrated Frances Dee stars as the Canadian nurse offered a job on a sugar plantation in St. Sebastion in the West Indies. Her thoughts of palm trees and ocean breezes lead her to accept, but the viewer senses danger when she is asked whether she believes in witchcraft before consenting. She meets the enigmatic  Paul Holland on the ship and in no time falls in love with her lush surroundings and the enigmatic Paul. His wife Jessica is ill and unresponsive. She is the reason Paul's half-brother Wesley drinks. Dee learns the real story while lunching with Wes, when a song played by the locals at the cafe reveals all.

Dee is lovely and genuine here, giving a nice performance. She misreads Paul's feelings about his wife, however, and in an attempt to cure her, sets in motion events beyond her control with a walk through the sugar cane on a windy night. She has heard of the voodoo magic, and is shocked to discover Paul's mother deep within the fields. Like many of Lewton's best efforts in the genre, I Walked With a Zombie is dreamlike and darkly romantic, a foreboding hovering over every frame, even in brighter moments. There is almost a gothic feel to this one. If Rebecca or Jane Eyre were filmed as horror stories, on a much smaller budget, they would be I Walked With a Zombie.

This is a cinematic masterpiece and a must see film for fans of classic films. But don't watch it alone on a dark and rainy night.",1267315200,,2042,4.538043478260869

420748,4,6302069122,"I Walked with a Zombie (Jacques Tourneur, 1943)

When Jacques Tourneur, one of the great directors of the forties and fifties, got together with Val Lewton, notorious B-movie producer (before B-movies were invented, even!), sparks just had to fly. The two of them worked on three pictures as a team in 1942 and 1943; I Walked with a Zombie, which adds a Curt Siodmak script to the mix, is the one in the middle, and often considered one of Tourneur's best movies (and the best collaboration between the two). I don't agree, but we'll get to that in a bit.

The story: Betsy Connell, a beautiful young nurse (Frances Dee, perhaps best remembered as Meg in George Cukor's adaptation of Little Women), leaves her native Canada to become a live-in assistant to Jessica Holland (Christine Gordon, who never received another credited onscreen role), the catatonic wife of sugar plantation owner Paul Holland (Tom Conway, of the long-running Falcon series of action movies). Also in the mix are Paul's brother, Wesley Rand (well-known Western actor Jimmy Ellison), and their mother (Jane Eyre's Edith Barrett). The servants start dropping hints to the impressionable young nurse that perhaps Jessica's predicament is not completely medical, and that she may be able to be helped by the voodoo priest...

At a spare sixty-nine minutes, I Walked with a Zombie has enough time to tell its tale, but it's lacking some of the deeper examinations of its theses that elevate Cat People to the level that movie achieves; there's obviously a great deal more to be said about the slave trade and the Hollands' part in it (especially as the slave ship figurehead, looming as it does in a number of scenes, pierced with a dozen arrows and constantly soaked by a fountain, is such a memorable prop in the film), and perhaps more importantly the status of the islanders who are descendants of those slaves; a few allusions are made to there being tension between some factions of freed slaves, but those seem to have been added more for atmosphere than anything else. This subtext (and a few others) seems to have been cut in order to make room for a love-affair subplot that wasn't really necessary, and that weakens the film overall.

All that said, that's not to take away from the fact that this is, in fact, a really good movie, given the infamous Val Lewton budget constrictions; it's a horror movie only in the broadest sense of the term, but there are scenes that work quite nicely on that level. And you'll never forget Carrefour. *** ",1193875200,4,2523,4.804147465437788
420749,5,6302069122,"What a strange, short movie!  Set in Haiti, around 65 years ago, a Canadian nurse comes to the island to care for a woman who appears to be catatonic.  We discover that the patient is, instead, a zombie!  None of the two zombies in this film chase people, eat people, or any of the other typical stuff.  They are just stupified and can be controlled by others.  It is a strange, dark little film that achieves its effect through lighting and excellant editing.  This is a gem of a film -- like a great short story instead of a novel.  The film lasts just a little over an hour, and uses every minute effectively.",1129766400,2,612,4.315789473684211

It is a moody, suspenseful black and white film, skillfully portrayed by all the actors, who play well off each other and off the premise of the story.  Music gives just the right eerie note to build on the apprehension of the audience.  Cinematography is excellent, with superb effect of light and shadow to create the chilling ambience.  Unlike many latterday films, the makers of this film seem to have understood that they were playing to an intelligent audience that would understand the subtleties of the film, with no need for blatant, screaming examples to explain every nuance.  No gore or grue -- no ""special effects,"" just an excellently underplayed manipulation of the audience's own fearful imaginings to create a superior example of this film genre.

Narrative ellipsis, elegance,and modulated low-key performances are the defining characteristics of all the Lewton-Tourneur collaborations of the 1940s. What a meeting of minds and sensibilities must have existed between these two gifted film makers-it's all up there on the screen within the boundaries of RKO's miniscule budgets. This is a truly haunting and mysterious film, Jane Eyre transported to the West Indies with voodoo mysticism in place of the atmosphere of the English moors. J Roy Hunt's creative chiaroscuro and Sir Lancelot's insistent balladeer's chorus help to build a cumulatively uneasy mood which extends to the almost dream-like performances of Frances Dee (the gravely beautiful Mrs Joel McCrea), James Ellison and Tom Conway among others. Tourneur blends all these elements into a poetic tour de force about reason struggling with the unknown. Whyever are the Lewton films at RKO unavailable in DVD?

Unlike its classic predecessor WHITE ZOMBIE (1932) which believes in zombies, Lewton's film lets you make up your own mind. Exquisitely paced by director Tourneur, the film unravels the motivations of its characters slowly, keeping you slightly off balance while trying to decide if the supernatural is fact or only belief. Adding to the uncanny mood is a calypso score plus amazing Darby Jones as a dude you wouldn't want to meet on a dark night! One of the great supernatural mood pieces of the cinema, this cult favourite derives from a series of articles written for a Hearst Sunday supplement by Inez Wallace.

His was not an invalid point of view and yet this Val Lewton production is extremely effective even if it is a morbid and oppressive work at times. Certainly the forces of superstition and darkness are victorious in the end. The death in life theme, so prominent in Lewton's Seventh Victim (a lesser work) is at the forefront. The acting is better than it was in Cat People, photography and set design are excellent. The screenplay maintains a haunting ambience consistently.

The nurse restrained and professional, the jilted husband bitter and remorseful for driving his wife away, Wesley the good looking guy not too articulate and fairly weak-kneed, Mrs. Rand the well-intentioned missionary who as much out of curiosity as so-called necessity dabbled with native beliefs and came to respect them as much as she dismissed them.

And dear Jessica. She got the chance to wander about in diaphanous gowns trying hard not to pay attention to her surroundings. As in the voodoo scene. Which was effective. Someone did their research.

The end, where Wesley was driven under a spell to kill Jessica (nice touch to use a knife from the figurehead) and then walk out to sea to drown himself with her. A little pat and convenient for our hero and heroine but I bought it.

Tourneur uses light, shadow, and wind to create the atmosphere of terror. There is very little horror music. In the end, it's ambiguous whether it's the supernatural or superstition that is responsible for the events.",1487203200,,480,4.454545454545454
7820688,5,6302069122,"One of the best psychological horror films of all time, ""Zombie"" is a study in complex narrative that deliberately contradicts itself, via multiple narrators, to create an extremely subtle yet powerful story of the possibly supernatural.  I say ""possibly"" because nothing ever happens that is necessarily supernatural fantasy, but one is made to wonder exactly what was real, what was imagined,  even though the film is dramatically satisfying.  That is something almost never done nowadays.

Lewton's group of writers and artists, including Jacques Tourneur and Curt Siodmak, represent some of the most brilliant artists ever working in Hollywood even though they were confined to a ""low budget B-film"" unit.  They were left alone to do what they wanted to do, as long as they used the titles sent down by the studio brass, and proceeded to make some of the most unique movies of the entire studio era.

""Zombie"" may be the best of them all, because it is a flawless, poetic masterpiece of fluid camera, wondrously atmospheric black and white cinematography, and great impressionistic music by the underrated Roy Webb who did some of his finest scores for Lewton. His music reminds me of Debussy, it is so beautiful and quiet and mysterious.  The actors deliver restrained, subtle performances which - as Chris Fujiwara in his fine book on Jacques Tourneur points out - actually enhance the interest in the storyline.  Tom Conway, a supremely dignified presence, and Frances Dee, a deeply beautiful woman of great presence, create unforgettable performances in this film.

Also, it must be noted that at a time with African Americans were denigrated in films, the Lewton films not only featured black performers in a positive light, but made them even ironic presences commenting upon the limitations of the white culture they were thrust into.  In ""Zombie"" the ""Ti Misery statue starts to function as an emblem of the oppression of the black people who first lived on the island as slaves, as well as a symbol of what the later white inhabitants came to experience, in an almost mythical retribution.

Perhaps the most interesting aspect of ""Zombie"" is its complex narrative strategy, constantly revising statements made by previous narrators, or contradicting what was said in a previous dialogue.  This creates an endlessly complex and fascinating poetic quality similar to - and perhaps inspired by - Citizen Kane with its complex, contradictory portrait of the title character.  J. P. Tellotte has written a great book ""Dreams of Darkness"" discussing the Lewton films, and Fujiwara's book on Jacques Tourneur is another great insight into the amazing complexity and richness of this and the other films of Tourneur.",1483315200,2,2721,5.142857142857143
