7581678,5,B019RVUFT8,"great acting and characters the writing/ plots were excellent, some episodes were better than others but on the whole I give it 5 stars. they pushed the envelope some times but made up for it with the need to know whats going to happen next. the characters really ""jelled"" and in terms  of a t.v. show it makes all the difference. an original series and a entertaining watch.",1454371200,12,375,4.514705882352941
7581679,4,B019RVUFT8,"The fifth and final season of Lost Girl was increased to 16 episodes and broadcast as Part 1 (episodes 1-8) and Part 2 (episodes 9-16). There is no such thing as a ""Season 6"".",1453766400,72,175,4.176470588235294

7581681,5,B019RVUFT8,I knew about show from being aired on syfy channel but i didn't start watching until i picked up the first four seasons on blu-ray and is one of my favorite shows if you haven't watched it i highly suggest watching,1453334400,8,214,4.2439024390243905
7581682,5,B019RVUFT8,"Lost Girl is a solid unique Canadian import
but, the blu ray sets have always been overly pricey
This is actually a decent price
you get Season 5 and 6 in a box set
But, I have a sneaking feeling Season 6 the final season is a lot like the final season of Continuum
a final season cut in 1/2

One major plus with the home video releases (dvd and blu ray) you get each episode uncut and uncensored
Sy Fi Channel in the States tend to edit each episode before airing them

This price is really good but, i still need season 2-4 on blu ray
I also have a feeling that after the smoke clears Funimation will put out the complete Lost Girl blu ray set
Anyone who has never given Lost Girl a try what's wrong with you?
It's like nothing on basic cable (American tv)
If you are into vampires, mystic magic, and lesbians check it out",1452124800,24,824,4.111801242236025

7581753,5,B019RVUFT8,"I loved the first two seasons on this show.

The third and fourth had some great episodes, but also skewed off into some stuff that qualified as WTF where you thinking?

For me this season rectified that and carried on to a good final season of the show.",1474848000,,254,4.270833333333333
7581754,3,B019RVUFT8,"Well, I'm at a crossroads with this season (it's one season split into two parts, Anna Silk's words). On one hand, it was better than season four, did things more like it's early seasons, characters behavior was a lot better, the villain's were more dynamic, the buildup and ending were fairly intense and the new bits of mythology were good. Also this season resolved a leftover plot thread from the first, which I liked.

Now moving onto problems (yes I have more dislikes than likes here). This season still carries a different feel than the first three, but it's more justified this time. Not all characters behavior was good, Lauren, Tamsin and Mark all had moments that got to me. Dyson and Vex had issues where story arcs involving them were resolved way too quickly (I don't usually put spoilers in my reviews, so I can't be specific HERE). How Kenzi was treated again sucked, for entirely different reasons.

The way some of the villains were ""taken care of"" left the season with an empty feeling as the show teased they might come back, but don't. The final message of the finale I didn't like, but it wasn't a bad way to end the show. There were some ""conviences"" during the final battle and one protagonists fate, didn't have as weight to it as I would've like (I had guessed that fate would happen, but now in that fashion. It's the one that happens just after the final battle).

Still, I don't feel this is a bad season of TV. I feel it is a weaker version of this perticular show. I will admit I'm being somewhat unfair as the first three seasons set the show on a REALLY high bar, but this is how I felt. I am glad I saw this and hope one day I'll like it more. Every other seasons flaws proved not to be as bad on the rewatch, but given how I rewatched the entire show before watching this, coming back to Lost Girl won't happen for some time.

But, do I think you fans should grabs this? Yes, easily.",1474070400,,1919,4.382022471910112

A few tears were shed at the end of season 4... the scene where the Valkyrie gathers the fragile lifeless Human into her arms and magnificent wings...is my favourite scene of all time.

7581867,4,B019RVUFT8,I thought this was a good series overall.  It kept me hooked.  I didn't like the lead up to Bo's father and how he was some evil entity like creature rather than a more humanistic person/being.  I also wasn't a fan of Bo's and Lauren's relationship.  I would recommend it to people who like fantasy/sci fi though.,1460073600,5,313,4.43859649122807

It makes me really sad that I won't be watching a new episode.  Maybe in a far off land there are still new episodes happening and they'll come to find me.  I loved this series.  I hated the end.  There is never a good end to anything even if it's a good last episode because you know, that's it.  No more.  I feel the same way about Dexter, True Blood, Six Feet Under and Penny Dreadful.  And I'll bet many of you out there are not familiar with Kindred-The Embraced.  Another good series cut too soon due to the main character Julian Luna (Mark Frankel) passing away.
