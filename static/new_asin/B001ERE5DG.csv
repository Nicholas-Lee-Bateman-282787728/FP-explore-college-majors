8299410,5,B001ERE5DG,"Tom Waits performance was very humorous and sentimental at the same time!  The broadcast should have won an Emmy award.  I was in my late teens when I first viewed this performance on PBS.  He, Tom Waits can act well, as he did in the movie Seven Psychopaths.",1390435200,,259,4.354166666666667
