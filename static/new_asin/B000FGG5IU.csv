8122295,3,B000FGG5IU,"The Dvd was good, but let me tell you the best part was the BTS Footage of Jane eating everything in sight, that girl can haul down food like a cranky Razorback at a Pigs N Lips buffet.  SUEEEY!",1250294400,,194,3.9743589743589745
8122296,1,B000FGG5IU,I recently purchased this DVD and I must say I was greatly disappointed.  I really enjoy watching different shows of this genre on TV and so I was looking forward to watching this DVD.  Not only was it extremely short (I couldn't believe when it was over) but totally unbelievable.  My advice is save your money.,1203897600,,312,4.535714285714286
8122297,5,B000FGG5IU,I loved the DVD! I'm glad someone finally recorded one of Jane's wonderful seances. It was very professionally done with a great narrator. Jane Doherty is quite a gifted medium and psychic. I have been to many of her seances and enjoy them each time I go. The DVD makes you feel like you are actually there. Kudos to Jane! When is the next one coming out?,1180483200,2,355,4.313432835820896
