8415626,5,B00443FMJI,"What a powerhouse story!.  I saw it on PBS and just had to purchase the DVD.  It is rare that stories are covered about slave rebellions beyond Nat Turner, Denmark Vesey, Gabriel Prosser, Cinque, and Toussaint L'ouverture.
This is a great story about a slave rebellion off the coast of South Africa.  Even more amazing, the slaves were imprisoned on Robben Island once they were captured!  If you have not seen this documentary, by all means watch it!",1397174400,,451,4.743589743589744

This work dealt with a slave ship travelling from Madagascar to South Africa.  Most of us African Americans are of West African descent.  The facts here concerned Southern Africans.  I am soooo excited to learn about a chapter of Black history about which I never knew.

The documentary shows an activist, a historian, and a forensic anthropologist studying the controversy.  Two were white men and one was a Black woman.  The work tries to be diverse.  In fact, a lot of what was mentioned here reminded me of the story behind ""Mutiny on the Bounty,"" involving English and Samoan people.

This work said young people were preferred as slaves, rather than older ones.  That surprises me as I thought I read that transatlantic slavers preferred adults over children.  Parents being enslaved often saw their babies and children murdered, if I read or heard correctly.  Still, other facts were the same.  Slave ships were extremely hot and filthy.  When slaves were sold they were checked over physically in non-humane ways.  This work said that slavers often ""skimmed from the top,"" kept some slaves to sell off the books for their own direct profit.  This is similar to current illegal markets for other products.

This work made me think deeply about communication and the way things are transmitted.  One of the slavers spoke a Madagascar language.  The slavers threw a message in a bottle which Europeans in South Africa actually received and followed.  The Africans intended to communicate with those on land by burning fires.  I think Paula Gunn Allen has criticized literacy, but Europeans were able to use that tool very well in oppressing others.

The Cinque of this mutiny was named Massavana.  Near the end of the work, we learn that he was imprisoned on the same island that Nelson Mandela would be centuries later.  Those interested in Nat Turner, Quilombo, and other Black revolutionaries should try to learn more about him.  Also, those who saw Michael Caine's ""Zulu,"" and remember the Zulu victory of that time, may also be interested in this as it covers the same region.

I have one big critique, however.  The documentary uses computer graphics when reenacting the scenes on the slave ship.  It looked very cheesy and made it difficult to suspend my disbelief.  Do you remember James Bond movies in which you can tell Bond is in an immobile car and a film screen is showing a road moving in the background?  This looked that fake!  I understand paying for ship scenery would have been expensive, but the cut-and-paste graphics used instead were incredibly subpar and risible.",1297728000,2,2719,4.868995633187773
