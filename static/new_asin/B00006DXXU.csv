1745863,5,B00006DXXU,"I have just recently purchased this DVD and let me tell you that it is GREAT! I can't belive all the EXTRA bonus material, like the ""mistakes"", and the radio show episodes, and behind the scenes! It is just a treasure!!! A TRUE MUST HAVE FOR A LUCY FAN!!! (like me)
TRUST ME, It is THE BEST!!!",1041897600,,293,4.157894736842105
1745864,5,B00006DXXU,"I never thought I'd do it, but here I am purchasing (and rating) a DVD of probably the most rerun series in TV history. Makes one wonder why buy it in the first place. In my case I was fascinated (and educated) by the DVD's revelation that the show's presentation was altered after its network broadcasts. Most of us grew up with LUCY, but only in syndication, and many things about the show were changed for syndication, from the opening credits (the Philip Morris sponsor was more predominant, and the ""heart-on-satin"" logo came much later) to background music, sponsor placement, and even one moment of censorship which involved a passionate kiss by Lucy and actual husband Desi Arnaz (drastically pared down by rerun time). The genius of the DVD is that it restores all these elements back to their original 1951 content, and even includes two radio broadcasts of LUCY's prototype, ""My Favorite Husband."" As far as the episodes themselves are concerned: 'Drafted' is the least entertaining and most contrived (the misunderstanding reaches outrageous proportions); 'Men Are Messy' and 'The Fur Coat' are standard Lucy shenanigans; and the 'Girl Singer' episode is the best- although the girl (Helen Silver) is actually a gorgeous dancer, and smolders in the 'Jezebel' number. Lucy goes brunette in the chorus line, and wreaks classic havoc.",1040342400,7,1343,5.081447963800905
1745865,5,B00006DXXU,"I LOVE LUCY continues it's DVD debut with a third volume of episodes from the first season.
MEN ARE MESSY - Ricky and Lucy fight over the subject of neatness, culminating in Lucy sabotaging Ricky's photospread in ""Look"" magazine!
THE FUR COAT - Ricky brings home an expensive mink coat that he has hired as a prop in his new act, and Lucy thinks he has bought it for her!
LUCY IS JEALOUS OF GIRL SINGER - Lucy gatecrashes Ricky's new act when she suspects that he is dallying with the new lead dancer (Helen Silver).
DRAFTED - When Ricky receives an invitation to report to an army barracks to perform for the troops, Lucy thinks that he is being drafted!
Special features include: guest cast info, original Philip Morris opening, episodes of ""My Favorite Husband"" radio show and flubs.",1035417600,8,786,4.621428571428571
1745866,5,B00006DXXU,"The people working hard to restore the original ""I Love Lucy"" episodes on each new ""I Love Lucy"" series DVD to their original content and improved quality deserve a standing ovation, and the quality and material presented on Volume 3 is no exception!
Presented on Volume 3 are four more wonderful episodes from the first ""I Love Lucy"" season:
1. ""Men are Messy"", Episode 8 (aired 12/3/1951).  As soon as Lucy finishes cleaning their apartment, Ricky walks in and proceeds to throw his clothes, newspaper and food everywhere.  Lucy divides the apartment into two halfs: her clean side and Ricky's messy side.  In the meantime, Ricky's publicity agent gets Ricky an interview & photoshoot with a magazine.  Ricky asks Lucy to get the apartment completely clean, but Lucy decides to play a trick because she mistakenly thinks it's only a musician's magazine.  Will Lucy be happy with her decision to trick Ricky in the end?  (Episode includes restored cigarette ""product placement"" scene.)
2. ""The Fur Coat"", Episode 9 (aired 12/10/1951).  Ricky brings home an expensive fur coat that he rented for a club act to show it to Lucy.  Ethel puts it on, Lucy walks in and gets upset because she doesn't have one.  Ricky tells her that it's not Ethel's, so Lucy assumes it hers! She puts it on and never wants to take it off.  Ricky & Fred think of a way to get the coat back.  Will Lucy find out that the coat really isn't hers?
3. ""Lucy is Jealous of Girl Singer"", Episode 10 (aired 12/17/1951).  Ricky's publicity agent writes a provocative article about Ricky and his new, beautiful girl singer/dancer. Lucy gets jealous, especially after Ricky brings home a piece of the girl's black lace costume that he accidentally tore.  Lucy & Ethel go to the club to spy on Ricky and girl.  How close will Lucy try to get to Ricky and girl during a musical/dance performance?
4. ""Drafted"", Episode 11 (aired 12/24/1951).  Lucy reads a letter that Ricky gets from the War Dept. telling him when to report.  Lucy thinks he's been drafted, but he's really just doing a show at a base.  Ricky enlists the help of Fred for the show, so Ethel thinks he volunteered.  Since Lucy & Ether are busy knitting, Ricky & Fred think one or both of the women are pregnant.  Will they figure out what's really going on?  (Restored prologue scene of Lucy, Ricky, Fred & Ethel all dressed as Santa Claus since the show aired on Christmas Eve.)
Before purchasing any of the ""I Love Lucy"" series DVD's, I had some initial misgivings because I have seen every episode multiple times over the years on commercial television.  However, after watching the restored episodes, I could not be more pleased that I did buy them!  To date, I have purchased all 4 DVD's currently available and I plan to buy all of them as they become available.
If you're a fan of the Queen of Comedy at her best (as well as Desi Arnaz, Vivian Vance & William Frawley), you will probably love owning each of the ""I Love Lucy"" series DVD's!  Thanks for all the many wonderful laughs Lucille Ball!",1035331200,7,3032,4.6367041198501875
1745867,4,B00006DXXU,"Volume 3 of the ""I Love Lucy"" DVD collection has what I think is the best of the episodes on these first four DVD collections, along with a trio of lesser efforts:
Episode 8, ""Men Are Messy"" (December 3, 1951) has Lucy and Ethel responding to this fact of life by turning the Ricardo apartment into a hillbilly shanty to teach the boy's a lesson.  This is just standard battle of the sexes fare.
Episode 9, ""The Fur Coat"" (December 10, 1951) is the classic first season episode where Ricky brings home a rented mink coat for his act and Lucy jumps to the conclusion it is a surprise gift for her.  Lucy simply milks this simple premise for everything it is worth, ending up in one of the best early crying jags for her character as the coat is taken away to be returned.
Episode 10, ""Lucy is Jealous of Girl Singer"" (December 17, 1951), who is actually more of Ricky's new dancing partner at the Club.  So Lucy joins the chorus line to keep an eye on the two.  But wait a minute.  Didn't she try to join the chorus line in Episode 3, ""The Diet,"" but fail?  So much for consistency.
Episode 11, ""Drafted"" (Decmeber 24, 1951) is what the girls think has happened to Ricky and Fred when they overhear the boys rehearsing a military number for a benefit show.  This is one of the lamest premises for an episode in the show's entire run and a rare sub-par episode.
All of these episodes were written by Jess Oppenheimer, Madelyn Pugh, and Bob Carroll, Jr., who were often rehashing scripts from Lucy's successful radio program ""My Favorite Husband"" and turning them into televison shows.  That might be the simplest and best explanation for why these episodes are not as good as what we would see later.  After all, Fred and Ethel were not part of the radio series, nor was Ricky for that matter.  Once the writers really had a sense for the characters and their relationships ""I Love Lucy"" would really blossom.",1034380800,2,1907,4.469740634005763
1745868,5,B00006DXXU,"Volume 3 is the one to get! With good and hillarious eps. My favorites are ""The fur coat"",""Men are Messy"" and ""Lucy is jealous of Girl Dancer"" I love all the extra's and the radio shows that was similar to, ""The fur coat"" and ""Men are Messy""
I love this DVD and I'll be sure to get Volume 4!",1034208000,,291,3.9491525423728815

7967676,4,B00006DXXU,"Bought this as part of a ""Buy Three for a Discount"" price.  I was surprised to see there were only a few episodes on each DVD - I didn't read the description closely enough.  Thought I was getting the first 3 years of the show, my error.
I bought the DVDs to use in my work with Seniors at a nursing home.  They have been a hit!  Just as fun to watch as ever and a good stroll down memory lane!",1302480000,,394,3.8271604938271606

7967678,4,B00006DXXU,"I Love Lucy first began to show signs of the sit com we would all come to know and love with these episodes.  While not the height of the show we'd love later, they are enjoyable.
""Men are Messy"" finds Lucy and Ethel trying to break their husbands of being slobs.  While the ending is not up to the rest of the episode, the beginning is hilarious.
In ""The Fur Coat,"" Lucy thinks a coat Ricky has rented for his act is a gift for her.  When she refuses to take it off, he must go to great lengths to get it back.  Wonderful all the way around and the best of the show so far.
""Lucy is Jealous of Girl Singer"" finds Lucy believing the gossip in the paper about the new dancer (not singer) at the club.
The weakest episode, ""Drafted"" finds the girls thinking that the men are entering boot camp.  This is one of the weakest in the series.  Originally airing on Christmas Eve, this episode features a special restored holiday tag at the end not shown in syndication.
The writers are still relying too much are Lucy and scripts from the radio show.  But the other characters are beginning to develop.  While not my favorite, the best is certainly yet to come.
This DVD is a collector's dream. The episodes are presented in their entirety, and they look and sound sharp. There are occasional flaws in the picture, but considering the source material is 50 years old, it really isn't bad at all. Brief things cut for syndication have been added back in, adding to the fun.  (I can't believe the humorous references to the original sponsor they managed to work in.)  The sound is presented in mono.  While it won't challenge your sound system at all, it serves the purpose well and is faithful to the original audio recording.  The extras feature the original opening plugging the show's sponsor (the episodes themselves use the heart we're used to from reruns), info on the guest cast, an inconsistency already in episode to episode continuity, and two episodes of Lucy's radio show ""My Favorite Husband"" that got reworked for the show.
True, the way season 1 was released isn't nearly as nice in terms of sets as other shows have gotten. But this is still a classic comedy with decent bonus material to make any fan happy.",1081814400,,2216,4.498753117206983
