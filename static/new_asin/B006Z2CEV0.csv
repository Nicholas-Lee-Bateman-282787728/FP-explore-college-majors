8506721,5,B006Z2CEV0,"All of their DVDs are great. It kind of goes with out saying. What makes this one stand out are the relatively rare tracks that have not been played live much over the years. Since this is fairly early in their career I suppose they didn't have as big a catalog to choose from. But it's always fun to hear MinHyuk have a chance to sing and be in the spotlight. I also like that they include the keyboard players and strings on stage, it's better to see them there rather than have some one off stage or (heaven forbid) playing a backing track. The strings add a lot to Y, Why btw. And they give them a nice acknowledgement as well.

The English subtitles are the icing on the cake. Although there's less stage banter than there has been added over the years.

Seems to have been filmed over two concerts (the change of clothes is fairly obvious). Unless they just changed costumes in the middle.",1426636800,2,895,4.3532934131736525

8506724,5,B006Z2CEV0,"The DVD contains CNBLUE most popular songs and some songs that I didn't know, but come to know and love now. There's nothing better than watching the band sing live in your very own home, the sound and quality of the DVD is excellent. The DVD come with English subtitled, photo book (great pictures of the CNBLUE boys), and another DVD showing their rehearsal. Must have for all the CNBLUE fans and korean music lovers out there.",1391212800,4,429,4.584415584415584
