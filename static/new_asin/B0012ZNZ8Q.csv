8248584,2,B0012ZNZ8Q,"This film has been copied to DVD and a 1-minute scene of writer of the book upon which this film is based (""Stowaways in Paradise"") talking with a lady at a table CLIPPED from the DVDs.  I've spent my last $30.00+ to get this vignette of Don Blanding.  NOBODY tells in their listing this bit was clipped from the DVD copy made from the film!!!",1393027200,,343,4.2615384615384615
8248585,5,B0012ZNZ8Q,I remember Bobby Breen as heard on an old 78 RPM record when I was working in AM Broadcast many years ago and have had a yearning to find him again.  What a great young voice that appealed to everyone in his day and to all of us today. A good glimpse into the past.  'Fine job of capturing and cleaning from the original for digital use.,1375574400,,337,4.014925373134329
8248586,5,B0012ZNZ8Q,The Hawaii Calls radio program was an American staple from the 1930s until the 1960s and helped put prestatehood Hawaii on the map. This 1930s Bobby Breen film took the title of that program. For those who love Hawaii it is interesting to see this old long forgotten film and to see young Breen especially sing Aloha Oe in Hawaiian. If for no other reason this makes the film well worth seeing as well as the scenes in Hawaii of the 1930s.,1356739200,,439,4.365853658536586
8248587,3,B0012ZNZ8Q,"This movie is a must for any fan of the poet, Don Blanding. It is loosley based on his book, ""Stow-aways in Paradise."" The quality of the reproduction is poor, but the 1930's sets, singing and dancing are good. If you look just hard enough, you can see the cameo made by DB at the ship's rail!",1334534400,,293,4.157894736842105
8248588,5,B0012ZNZ8Q,"I have been looking fo this movie for many year's. I am 66 year's old. I saw this
