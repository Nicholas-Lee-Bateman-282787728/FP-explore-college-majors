5384619,5,B00A6SZS1W,"This is probably one of the few shows I can stand to watch over and over again with my daughter.  It's colorful, great songs, and they actually teach stuff.  My 20 month old has picked up so many words and has learned her colors through watching this show.  I'm a 30 y/o mom and I love the show.  The songs are witty, kind of like phineas and ferb for those who are familiar with that show.",1361836800,,390,4.092105263157895

5384622,3,B00A6SZS1W,"I'm disappointed  that all the episodes are on tv all the time. I thought they would be new ones, but they aren't. But I do like that now we can take them on the road and it also shipped very fast.",1360022400,3,197,3.8048780487804876
5384623,5,B00A6SZS1W,"My girls (ages 3 and 6) love the Bubble Guppies and we have a ton of the episodes on our DVR, including all of the episodes from this DVD.  They are always requesting the show.  The show is great for its vivid colors and fun songs.  It always has a positive message and teaches kids about a variety of things and occupations.  You will probably find yourself with the catchy songs stuck in your head.  The going outside song is the best.

This DVD contains six great episodes.  Amazon doesn't always do a good job on their DVD episode listings so here are the episodes that are included on this DVD:
1.  Build Me a Building - They build Bubble Puppy a Dog House (very catchy song in this episode).
2.  Firefighter Gill to the Rescue - Someone gets stuck in a tree and needs to be rescued.
3.  Fishketball - The team learns about sports.
4.  The Grumpfish Special - The Bubble Guppies help the grumpiest fish in town to a nice meal (this is probably my favorite episode).
5.  Call a Clambulance - A broken tail means a trip to the doctor.
6.  A Tooth on the Looth - Deema loses a tooth and gets a visit from the Tooth Fairy!

We need a new Bubble Guppies DVD for car trips and this one has some favorite episodes so it is perfect.  Highly Recommended!",1359936000,76,1250,4.237288135593221
5384624,5,B00A6SZS1W,"My boys (4 and 6) never get sick of Bubble Guppies and even though they recognized some of these episodes from television, they still enjoyed the DVD.  The DVD features six episodes (over two hours of Bubble Guppies fun) that are perfect to watch for any preschooler.  They are wholesome characters that work together to solve problems all while teaching kids different things.  Different jobs are featured throughout the episodes which is great to show kids how everyone is good at something and about responsibility.  The episodes make kids think too, like in ""Build Me a Building"" the Bubble Guppies are building a building and trying to figure out the best material to use to make the building sturdy.

As soon as I turned it pun I realized it was just a compilation of Bubble Guppies epsidoes from various seasons that I already purchased. I can see how it would be useful for long car rides, but we don't take many.  I think the description should be changed to reflect that this is a compilation of 6 episodes from older seasons to prevent confusion. Luckily Amazon agreed to refund my money.

5384687,5,B00A6SZS1W,"Once upon a time, my child would wake up every morning and say ""hi"" in the most adorable way...now he says ""Buppies??"" [his version of saying Bubble Guppies]. He is sucked into this show...he even cries when he sees the credits! It is Toddler Crack! Which def helps while mommy is trying to clean the house. They teach about all kinds of different aspects of life...even the not so glamorous like working in a restaurant or hair salon. Not just about being a cowgirl, fireman or all the dream things of what we all want to be when we grow up. The singing is awesome...even tolerable for mommies/daddies (yes super cool and catchy)! Perfect for Road Trips: It is like $10 and practically 2hr and 10 min of multiple Bubble Guppies episodes...that just run all at once, vs having to have to fumble to start a new episode while driving.
Only complaint: I, personally, have a hard time with it being underwater and yet they get ""sprayed by fire hoses"" or what not. But I know, I know it is a kids' show",1419206400,9,997,4.453551912568306
