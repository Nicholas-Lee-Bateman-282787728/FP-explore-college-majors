8255040,5,B0014BZSK6,"The truth will out. This is an excellent exposition. Although the two DVDs have some redundancy both should be watched .
Blind belief in the so called experts who have made anthropomorphic climate change --erstwhile global warming--a politico-religious issue in spite of their failed computer programs is at this point a fool's errand. Manhatten Island is still above water in spite of the Tennessee fellows prediction we would be canoeing in the streets.
Viewing these data filled DVDs is a must for those who wish to be broadly informed.",1469404800,,539,5.067415730337078

The climate-change-denying think tank The Heartland Institute pays monthly stipends to vocal global warming skeptics, received $200,000 from the Charles G. Koch Foundation in 2011 and received a total of $3.4 million from corporations in 2010 and 2011, according to internal documents released last night.

DeSmogBlog released the documents Tuesday night to expose its rival in the global warming debate. The blog received the documents from an anonymous ""Heartland Insider."" Here's the inside scoop and more on Heartland:

-Craig Idso, chairman of the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change and other think tanks, receives $11,600 per month from Heartland. Idso's study center is funded in part by Exxon Mobile and he recently spoke on the benefits of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide levels at the American Legislative Exchange Council's annual meeting, according to SourceWatch.org.

-Australian global warming skeptic Professor Bob Carter receives $1,667 per month, but denied doing the bidding of Heartland in an Australian newspaper on Wednesday.

-Fred Singer of the climate-change-denying Science and Environmental Policy Project receives $5,000 a month from Heartland.

-Singer's group helped establish NIPCC [Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change], which Heartland sponsors to ""undermine"" the reports by the United Nation's climate change panel, according to Heartland documents. Two anonymous foundations supply the NIPCC funding.

-Heartland has a ""key"" anonymous donor who gave $1.6 million in 2010 and $979,000 in 2011.

-Heartland's income totaled $4.6 million in 2011.

-The Charles G. Koch Foundation of Koch brother's fame gave Heartland $200,000 in 2011 and promised more money in 2012. The Koch family made much of its riches from fossil fuels and their foundation routinely supports conservative politicians and causes.

-Heartland's proposed 2012 budget includes $75,000 to develop a ""Global Warming Curriculum for K-12 Classrooms,"" as proposed by a government consultant who wants to develop alternative classroom materials. Several states have introduced legislation that would give climate change skepticism a place in the classroom.

-From Heartland's climate strategy: ""Efforts at places such as Forbes are especially important now that they have begun to allow high profile climate scientists (such as Gleick) to post warmist science essays that counter our own. This influential audience has usually been reliably anti-climate and it is important to keep opposing voices out.

-Heartland has a right-wing agenda beyond climate change. The group proposed $667,217 in 2012 for its ""Free to Choose Medicine"" campaign, which wants to give consumers the right to take prescription drugs before they are evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).",1329436800,,2939,5.746543778801843
8255044,5,B0014BZSK6,"I've heard that some powerful people tried to ban this DVD of a British Research Team's conclusions about Global Warming, which was shown on English TV.
If you are of a liberal bent, you will have problems with it.  For the more rational rest of us, it details with many uncontested facts how certain power-interests have manipulated this chicken-little-sky-is-falling topic to turn it into a cash-cow for themselves.  After watching this, I looked up a number of facts they claimed in the DVD, to find them all true.  This whole Global Warming issue has been losing steam for years now, but I believe the same interests will try to pull this one off again in 10 years - perhaps with a Global Cooling Scare.  Watch and see.",1313452800,2,723,4.669291338582677
