4570727,1,B0037HERMA,This is a sad attempt at story telling and I think destroys the Magoo character. I'm okay with revamping things from time to time for series but there's no original hear here.,1377216000,,175,4.5
4570728,5,B0037HERMA,My 8 year old loves this movie!  He watches it through amazon prime.  It's funny and totally Mr. Magoo antics!  He has watched it many times - and laughs each time.  It's a cute kid flick.,1375660800,2,188,4.138888888888889

4570747,1,B0037HERMA,I was looking for a witty Mr. Magoo. This is slapstick and for kiddies.,1419897600,,71,4.142857142857143

4570751,4,B0037HERMA,Magoo is always crazy,1409616000,,21,4.5
4570752,1,B0037HERMA,"As a baby boomer, I was looking forward to enjoying the Mr. Magoo cartoon(s) from the 60's and 70's however, this video was from a later cartoon version of moreso the 90's era. I chose this video because it was free for Prime Members.  The 'real' classics of Mr. Magoo episodes (now in videos) could only be viewed for a price because in my opinion, they are the most desired by people of all ages -- just like most of the classic Westerns' videos can only be viewed for a price.  I closed the video out at the very beginning because I was disappointed that it was not one of the classics.  Why can't wholesome classic Westerns and Cartoons be free, especially for Prime Members.",1408924800,4,679,4.416
4570753,5,B0037HERMA,"I love Mr magoo, my 7 year grandson really enjoyed the movie. I wish there were more movies for children like this one.",1408406400,,119,4.217391304347826

4570755,5,B0037HERMA,"Eight year-old LOVED it!  ... and Dad found it pretty hilarious in a throw-back way also!  Regardless, a very nice, simple yet good, funny story with lots of laughs. My son immediately wanted to search for more Magoo movies on Amazon and watch more!!  That's about as good of a compliment as you can get :)",1405296000,,306,4.428571428571429
4570756,2,B0037HERMA,I am very disappointed in this cheaply produced Magoo film!  Somehow it just doesn't elicit the same kind of belly laughs as in yesteryear.  This Magoo is not as funny or comedic as before and falls flat in my humble opinion!  The artwork and animation is not nearly as good as the ones produced for Movie Theatres years ago!,1401753600,,325,4.47457627118644
4570757,1,B0037HERMA,"I grew up with watching the original Mr. Magoo and this movie didn't remind me of that! I understand that this is a new day and age, but some things you can leave the same and people will still watch it ;-) If it isn't broke, don't try fixing it...lol",1400025600,,251,4.04
4570758,4,B0037HERMA,Old and out dated - a little cornier than the Mr Magoo of my younger days but very fun and entertaining - brings back fond memories.,1390867200,,132,4.115384615384615
