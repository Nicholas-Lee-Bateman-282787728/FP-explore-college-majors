The film begins in Switzerland. Two men enter a caf, and old man meets them to give them orders. They plan to steal a bombsight from Dr. Franz Tobel. [Did you notice the clue?] Will the spies be fooled by an impersonation? Can they be flown out of the country at night? They arrive safely in London. Mission accomplished? There seems to be some trickery here. [Or a lack of security?] What is Dr. Tobel drawing? Who is after him? Holmes explains his deductions. The bombsight is tested on Salisbury Plain [it looks like the western desert of the USA]. Will it revolutionize aerial bombardment? There are scenes of London. Dr. Tobel wants to work independently without unwanted attention. The bombsight is composed of four parts, each one produced at independent workshops. [Are all telephone calls monitored by a government agency?]

When Dr. Tobel goes missing Sherlock Holmes looks for him while disguised. Holmes finds a person who knows something. Will he walk into a trap? Will Moriarity eliminate Holmes at last? Or will his plot fail? There is a trick to raise the writing from an impression on the paper beneath. Can they decipher the code? What if the men named are dead? ""What is the name of the fourth man?"" Holmes figured out the trick. Will Moriarity? Who has the better plan? ""A keen observation."" ""You've played into my hands."" Will Lestrade and Watson arrive in time? Will Moriarity fall into his own trap for an ironic ending? [What about the sequel?]",1453161600,,1518,4.790076335877862
7908323,4,B00000FDX6,"This entry in the Rathbone "" Sherlock Holmes "" series is based on the Doyle short story ""The Dancing Men "" and is relocated to World War 2

It opens with Sherlock Holmes facilitating the escape from neutral Switzerland to England of ""Dr Tobel "" ,the inventor of a radical new bomb sight . This is done under the noses of the Gestapo .

In England Tobel demonstrates ,successfully,the new sight but before he can impart its secrets to the British military he vanishes .He had slipped out to visit his girl friend one Charlotte Everli (  Kaaren Werne )having refused police protection .

He has left a mesage for Holmes ,to be opened if anything untoward happened to him .On opening the envelope Holmes finds a taunting message "" We meet again , Mr Holmes "" It is from his old adversary Moriarty who is working on behalf of the Germans ,to snatch both Tobel and the bomb sight .He has the inventor but not the components of the sight .Tobel has left clues in the form of a cryptographic code as to where the components can be located --there are four and each is in the care of a different man .

As Moriarty too has the code the race is in to be the first to reach them and prevent the code falling into the hands of the Axis powers.

Holmes and Moriarty finally confront each other in a splendidly melodramatic climax in the London docks

Rathbone is as ever splendid ,and makes a splendid Lascar ,in which guise he seeks information on Moriarty .He is matched every step of the way by Lionel Atwill as Moriarty and the scene where they  taunt each other as the climax nears is done with chilling relish .There is a special chemistry at work between the two during these scenes .

The movie is important in the evolution of the series for two reasons .It was the first to be directed by Roy William Neill who went on to direct all the remaining movies and whose economical ,suspenseful style was exactly right for these essentially B -movies .The montage depicting a disguised Holmes trekking the watering holes of the docks is striking .It was also the first to feature the definitive Lestrade in Dennis Hoey ,whos no nonsense homely features and dogged manner were ideal for the role .

It is worth noting that it is a very literary movie .There is a reference to Poe -specifically to The Purloined Letter ,and a reference also to ""the great German writer Wilhelm Shakespeare ""

The Shakespearean connection is emphasised with Rathbone's beautiful delivery of John of Gaunt's great speech from Richard the Second .

"" This fortress built by Nature for herself ,,this blessed plot ,this Earth ,this realm ,this England ""

No true Englishman can hear those lines ,spoken so well ,without being moved.

Great lively little movie and well executed all round",1106956800,,2755,4.561866125760649
7908324,4,B00000FDX6,"Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce may be the definite Holmes and Watson.  Here they are transported from the Sir Conan Doyle's 19th century London, to England during WW II.  Holmes and Watson must match wits with nazi spies and, of course, the fiendish Moriarty.  There's lots of atmosphere, surprising twists, genial comedy, and an exciting climax with secret passages and trap doors.  Lots of fun, and one of the better entries in the Rathbone Bruce series.",986860800,2,456,4.9605263157894735
