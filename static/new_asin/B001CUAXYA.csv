I really like these shows, they entertain me but they end so fast because I like to get away while I am watching and learning the different things that Modern Marvels presents to us.",1467849600,,269,4.1923076923076925

8289768,5,B001CUAXYA,"Very interesting with basic information. I wish that this would have been accessable to me at a much younger age. The basics of engines is always interesting...and yet this broad range of basic information on such an important subject seems to be left out of basic education...and you must grow up some and seek it out in order to find it. I found this dvd so interesting that I went back and bought it for each of my sons. If there was an engines two video available with more information I would just automatically buy it. The only negative about it was that there was no second, third or fourth dvd available in this series....I cant imagine many guys not enjoying this.",1412553600,,673,4.524590163934426
8289769,5,B001CUAXYA,"As this was presented by the History Channel, the focus is on the historical aspect of the development of jet engine technology, and its application to military and civilian aviation. Also, because it was produced in 1999, it does not cover the latest developments. But, it is very thorough and includes extensive archival photo and film footage, plus interviews with Bob Hoover, several aviation historians, jet engineers, and others who have been a part of the development of jet engines. Since I use this video to teach turbine engine operation, I would have liked more coverage on the evolution of the technology and design of jet engines.",1284249600,2,643,5.018691588785047
