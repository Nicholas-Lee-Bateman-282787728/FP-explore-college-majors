2483690,5,B000E1YW9A,"An epilectic family is the perfect foil for this poignant study of italian bourgeois society.. Like Renoir's rules of the game, this movie opened up new doors for cinema and found new ways to look at certain aspects of social milieu..

Amongst the italian new wave and classic neo-realism of the period it takes a new route something which is real and yet unreal.. Like the movies of Pasolini and bertolucci, Bellochio's fists in the pocket would honor italy's cinematic past while doing something new and radical..",1170374400,6,515,4.919540229885057
2483691,5,B000E1YW9A,"Any film that managed to anger equally the Vatican and Luis Bu?uel must be worth checking out -- and FISTS IN THE POCKET had that distinction upon its initial release.  Unlike many scandals of a previous day, however, this spare, beautifully made film has lost not one whit of its power to shock.  Bellochio makes an impressive debut as writer/director here, and a marvelous cast, headed by Lou Castell, create a family of fools, freaks and monsters you won't soon forget.  Brilliant cinematography, wonderful early score by Morricone (who'd think it possible to ring yet another change on the DIES IRAE?), and the expected sharp transfer and informative extras/liner notes from Criterion.  Difficult, spiky and essential viewing for any fan of Italian cinema.",1147392000,16,760,5.154471544715447
2483692,4,B000E1YW9A,"This film, ""Fists in the Pocket"", is virtually forgotten here in the U.S., but is a huge cult classic in Italy. The reasons for this are that it's never really been available here on video. And ,it was so ahead of its time that it shocked audiences when it first came out. However, even though it's forgotten, it is an excellent film.

  It concerns a strange bourgouise family living in a rural villa together. There is the ""normal"" but self absorbed oldest brother, a blind mother, a VERY weird middle brother (a brilliant Leo Castel), a manipulative sister, and a retarded youngest brother. In lieu of a (absent) father, the oldest brother is the patriarch of this eccentric clan, and somewhat tied down by it. The weirdo middle brother, Allesandro (Castel), is a hell-bent, anarchal/suicidal/homocidal maniac with epilepsy who decides to rub out the whole family, including himself, to ""free"" the older brother he claims to admire so much. Thus begins a disturbing, frenzied journey by him to kill his other family members.

  As dark as it sounds, which it is, it's also quite darkly humorous at times, as well. It's also easy to see why it was controversial in 1965: there are murders, hints of incest, sacriligious blasphemies, the two oldest brothers sleep with street walking prostitutes ( who are a constant presence in the film), there are eplileptic seizures shown, etc.. Basically, it has all the elements that would've gotten you condemned by the Catholic church at that time.

 Director Marco Bellochio made a stunning debut with this film, and it is reminiscent of the early works of Pasolini, Bertolucci, and other Italian new wavers of the time. Definitely worth seeing.

  The Criterion Collection has done a wonderful, as usual, job here. The print is sterling, the sound perfect, and there is a great retrospective piece with interviews by Bellochio and Leo Castel (who reminds me of Brando). And there is a wonderful afterword by Bernardo Bertolucci. I do highly recommend this one.",1146873600,30,2004,4.95223880597015

8104407,5,B000E1YW9A,"In ""I pugni in tasca"" (""Fists in the Pocket"" from 1965) Marco Bellocchio provoked and incited a film-going audience not yet ready for the ugly truth about society (ourselves)! This film also marked the beginning of a new and bold cinema too. Here, Marco Bellocchio gave us an insidious indictment against a social structure that has existed for millennia now. And while the film is not really political, I could not ignore an obvious analogy: a dysfunctional family (the State and Society), suffering from the afflictions of inbreeding (nepotism, patronage, corruption, etc.), and self-delusional provincialism.

But the film's true power comes from its composition of images that tells its story in symmetrical and poetic coherence. The cinematography was simply excellent and the editing was flawless, and of course Ennio Morricone's haunting score. Lou Castel's performance was truly mesmerizing for its naked and cathartic genuineness. The film is truly revolutionary for having the courage to paint a true picture of the world and not continue with the same mindless fable, and it should not be confused as an endorsement of nihilist or anarchistic sentiments. I was surprised to learn that even Luis Buuel was supposedly shocked by its premise (here Buuel was being truly hypocritical, especially for someone whose own works were deemed controversial and heretical). But as many of us already know; even artists are full of you know what---Merde! This film should be appreciated as a polemic work of Art that is also striving for the sublime. I'm glad I got the chance to see it again. This is a film that dares to acknowledge humankind's collective madness---figuratively and in actuality.

The DVD picture and sound quality by Criterion was excellent and the film was in its proper aspect ratio (1.85:1). NTSC, Italian (English subtitles), extras (interviews and observations: Marco Bellocchio, Lou Castel, Bernardo Bertolucci, etc.), NR 105 mins.

8104408,4,B000E1YW9A,"A pre-sexual revolution work is the powerful artefact of the sixties last century depicting a boring existence of a provincial family living out a sort of interest-from-capital inherited managed by a blind relatively not-too-old mother while her adult kids could not realize themselves in Italy, growing anger each to other and a common one-to their old matriarch.

Then a movie of young made by the young, surely something very different by twists of suicides, murders and characters involved in, is still of a mere humanitarian interest for environment repeating upon epochs also in forms slightly different.",1357776000,,610,5.354166666666667
8104409,5,B000E1YW9A,"This film is like ""Psycho"", ""All about Eve"" and ""The Royal Tenanbaums"" wrapped up in one beautifully directed film. Also, this is scored by Ennio Morricone! Please watch this!",1344384000,,175,5.068965517241379
8104410,5,B000E1YW9A,"What an awesome and twisted debut film!!! Dark, subversive, and a scathing indictment of bourgeois family values. Family dynamics don't become more dysfunctional than this. Lou Castel's performance as the anti-hero is unforgettable. The camera-work in this film dramaticlly diverges from neo-realism, forging a new language in Itailian cinema.",1280707200,2,343,6.020408163265306
8104411,5,B000E1YW9A,"The originality of ""Fists in the Pocket"" amazes me, espescially as an only child. Certain great artists (and many mediocre and boring people too) have epileptic fits - isn't that a subject that deserves more investigation by art and film?  I'm not a film expert but the subject of intense brilliant very strange sibling interaction seems somewhat under-represented in the literature as well.",1271376000,,391,5.2063492063492065

The acting was fine, the location and filming were very good, but the killing of defenseless family members was disturbing.  I didn't really enjoy this movie, but I'm not one who watches many movies involving violence and murder.",1223078400,,354,4.603174603174603
8104413,5,B000E1YW9A,"This bleak, tragicomic family drama created an uproar after its release in 1968, ostensibly for offending basic moral values and assailing the virtues of Catholicism, and the title is a metaphorical reference to the turbulent psychology of epileptic sociopath Alessandro. Played with burning ferocity by Swedish actor Lou Castel, Alessandro is a loose cannon of teeming hate who seemingly has no qualms about pushing his blind mother off a cliff or penning incestuous verse to his sister Giulia (Pitagora). Perverse but enthralling, ""Fists"" instantly secured Bellocchio's reputation as a coolly assured director, and ranks among the seediest of family-dysfunction tales.",1182902400,,670,5.71
