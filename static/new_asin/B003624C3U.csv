Having never before seen any laser disc, I was amazed at the quality of the image. I expected something blurry, like the VHSs that were released a tthe same time, but even on the HD TV the picture was quite impressive.

Of course, the main attraction for me were the bonuses that are indeed superb. More deleted scenes than in all other releases combined, galleries, documentaries, story boards, lithographies... Why Disney doesn't do anything like that anymore?!?",1322611200,7,633,4.642857142857143
