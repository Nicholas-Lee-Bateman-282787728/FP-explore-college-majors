8585311,1,B00CRJ3XQ0,"Yes this is a DVD but is made by a dentist, not an expert in ""creationism"" which by the way isn't even close to scientific, if you don't believe in evolution, whatever, but isn't God's creation through evolution just as big of a miracle? So all you creationists can just plain grow-up and know that God and science can both be believed.",1499731200,,336,4.435483870967742

8585315,5,B00CRJ3XQ0,"This is an excellent video, especially for children!  It is the first in a three volume set.  The video is mainly comprised of interviews by Dr. Jobe Martin with Dan Breeding (Dan the animal man) who discusses particular animals in detail.  It is very interesting to me to hear Dr. Jobe Martin's point of view as a former evolutionist.  These videos are extremely kid-friendly and are a great resource for homeschooling families as well as anyone interested in animals and creation!",1412985600,3,482,4.91358024691358
