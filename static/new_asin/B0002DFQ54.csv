It was worth the price, our grand kids who have never been to alive racing event thought it was pretty cool so I give it a positive review.

8026660,5,B0002DFQ54,"This DVD is a must for any 1980's drag racing fan.  It is a true nostalgic masterpiece of 1980's nitro drag racing.  Showing some runs by funny car, and dragster drivers from the early 1980's until the early 1990's.  All the drivers and cars you remember, shown close up, all the dry hops, the blow overs, the crashes, and the fire balls.  Theres even a whole section on funny car body explosions.  I believe 1980's Nitro Funny Cars are some of the best looking cars in history.  If you agree this video is for you!",1125187200,3,515,4.368421052631579
