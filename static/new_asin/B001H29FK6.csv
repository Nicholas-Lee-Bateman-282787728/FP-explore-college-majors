8307704,4,B001H29FK6,"The Blue Rodeo Documentary by Chris Mills won the 2009 Juno award for Musical DVD of the Year. Blue Road is a CD/DVD that includes both the audio and video recordings of Blue Rodeo's acoustic set during their 2008 Massey Hall appearance, as well as the behind-the-scenes documentary.

This item is actually listed more descriptively on Amazon.ca as ""Blue Road: Live At Massey Hall 2008 (CD/DVD)"" < http://www.amazon.ca/Blue-Road-Live-Massey-Hall/dp/B001H29FK6/ref=sr_1_2 >.

I would look at the DVD much like a bonus disc. The DVD contents of the Massey Hall show is actually titled ""Bootleg"" dropping a big hint about the picture and sound quality which is mostly what looks like simulated 16mm footage cut with brief bits of higher resolution video and has a single channel Dolby audio track. The Chris Mills documentary has the band playing and recording new material (which does sound great) and lounging around the pool with some organ playing as a backdrop. Aesthetically, it looks like a home movie probably fitting into the concept of the ""Bootleg"" footage of the Massey Hall show.

While not for everyone, if you're a fan, then this is easily an enjoyable experience. Including the CD gives you the live acoustic set without needed to bother with the DVD if you just want to listen to the tunes. The band sounds great as usual and it is nice seeing them live -- I rarely get the chance anymore since they rarely travel to NorCal and I rarely travel to London Ontario or Saskatoon Saskatchewan (the do seem to play those cities a lot).

While a highly produced concert video or maybe a tour video documenting all those gigs around Canada (since Blue Rodeo is such a great live band) would be great to see,  that's hardly the reason to knock the performances contained here.

8307705,2,B001H29FK6,Blue Rodeo has a small fan base in the U.S. and I am one of them; been with them since Diamond Mine. Their music is great but they can't put out a decent DVD; this one is home movies with so-so sound. Their more professional one released a few years ago was so difficult to navigate I just gave up on it. Hey Blue Rodeo; why don't you get a professional crew and do a straight electric concert in DTS or Dolby Digital? Don't waste your money on this one,1243814400,10,453,4.044444444444444
