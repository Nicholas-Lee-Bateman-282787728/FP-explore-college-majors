2736008,4,B000MGUZB6,that I laughed so much since I randomly picked it at the video store and the reviews weren't that great!  I wanted to keep this in my library for when I need a good laugh : ),1275868800,2,174,3.7027027027027026
2736009,4,B000MGUZB6,"I bought caffeine because of mike vogel, and also because I read other reviews and they said the movie was funny. it really was funny, and the blooper reel was hilarious as well. it was cool to see if you really listened to someones conversation at a restaurant, what you might really here. a lot of great actors too like marsha thomason, katherine heigl, mena suvari, breckin meyer, and mike vogel, plus a lot more. the English accents are a little iffy for the Americans, but it just makes it more fun to watch. I couldn't find it anywhere to rent, so if you really want to see it, you should buy it. it's really enjoyable to watch, and not expensive.",1273881600,2,653,4.404958677685951
2736010,4,B000MGUZB6,This movie is a fairly good one. Marsha Thomason is hot. Mena Suvari is decent. The whole movie has a typical understated British plot.,1259020800,,135,4.666666666666667
2736011,2,B000MGUZB6,"I really expected more from this film because of the excellent cast, but other than a few good scenes this film just sits there. The endless chatter is neither funny nor interesting for the most part and I found myself wanting this film to just end.

As independent films goes this is one of most disappointing ones I've seen. There are a few shinning moments in this scattered tale about nothing, but there are so many better films out there, it just isn't worth your time.",1244160000,,474,4.511627906976744
2736012,4,B000MGUZB6,"This film was recommended to me by a friend that has a taste for... well let's just say ""the exotic"" when it comes to movies (one of his favorites is the movie Shortbus).  Caffeine certainly fits into that genre.

The entire movie is set in an English cafe and is centered around the sex lives of it's employees and patrons (all of whom would certainly qualify as guests for the Jerry Springer show).  We have, in no particular order:

*  A young, quirky, hip staff - all of who are suffering with hangovers from an outing the night before
*  A cook who just confessed to his girlfriend (and boss) that he recently had a threesome (""But they were twins, what could I do?"") and then becomes obsessed with a condom wrapper that he finds in her office
*  A sharp tongued waitress who brings her demented grandmother (who mistakes a diner for her ex-husband who she once caught wearing a ""nappy"" while being spanked by a prostitute and tries to shoot him with a shotgun) to work because it was her turn to watch her
*  A customer who is being investigated for exposing himself to a 12 year old girl when in reality he was interrupted by her while he was engaged in public urination and simply forgot what he had in his hand
*  His friend, an attorney who wears his finance's underwear while vacuuming and ironing at home (""well at least he cleans"" a woman remarks)
*  Two stoned patons, one who mistakes another customer for a porn star and the other who's ex-girlfriend just happens to be at that same cafe on the world's worst blind date

And still there is more.  This is a frantically paced movie that kept me entertained for it's entire 88 minutes.  Don't expect greatness but do expect to laugh.",1215648000,7,1697,4.435483870967742
2736013,3,B000MGUZB6,"For an independent film, this is well done. However, it does require a suspension of disbelief to watch and enjoy it. I have never seen a coffeehouse that huge before (maybe they're bigger in England). Nobody gets any work done and everybody swears like drunken truckdrivers on crank. And all anyone can think about are their ""relationships"". Marsha Thomason's character is the only sane one there (and to tell you the truth, she should have shown much more skin). I recommend this for Marsha Thomason fans (like me) or closet Anglophiles, but for others I would buy Waiting... instead.",1198713600,10,586,4.929292929292929
2736024,4,B000MGUZB6,"Maybe not the best or highest budget comedy I've ever seen but it kept me rollin' in the aisles, with it's variously sordid and quirky little awkward and even bizarre sexual scenarios, set amidst the backdrop of a struggling coffeeshop run by the film's ""heroine""... All in all - I call it JOLLY good fun! - and I recommend that anyone should give a GO at least once... :)",1387756800,,372,4.405797101449275
2736025,4,B000MGUZB6,"Cute movie.  My friend, Roz Witt, is the crazy old lady so had to own it!  Wish it had made it to the theaters here.",1386633600,,116,3.6
2736026,5,B000MGUZB6,"I loved this movie - not for kids, but fabulous - laughed so hard I cried. Rented it first and ended up buying my own copy, which I RARELY do.",1358035200,,142,3.7666666666666666
2736027,5,B000MGUZB6,"This is a great English movie filmed by mostly American actors. It has enough levels, humor and drama to appeal to most anybody.
We bought this movie because we plan on seeing it over and over again.",1356480000,,199,4.405405405405405
2736028,5,B000MGUZB6,"This was exactly the type of comedy that I enjoy, it's wacky, but not incredibly crass. The entire reason that I bought this film was that Andrew Lee Potts is in it, but I found that after I watched it, it became my favorite comedy, and I've watched it numerous times since receiving it. Really a great movie.",1354579200,,309,4.344827586206897
2736029,5,B000MGUZB6,"First of all, I am a huge fan of Andrew Lee Potts and Mark Pellegrino. Even if the movie had ended up being a dud, it still would have been fun to watch their performances. However, this movie turned out to be a pleasant surprise! The cast is comprised of wonderful actors and the pacing is handled very well (it's one of those quirky, offbeat films that leaves you wondering why you never heard about it before). The script writers pull off the multi-plot aspect of the story with ease and it is fun to watch the side conversations and mishaps that occur when the patrons of the cafe bump into each other. If the trailer catches your interest or you're a fan of british comedies, I encourage you to at least rent the film. It's definitely worth viewing!",1345075200,2,754,4.431654676258993
2736030,5,B000MGUZB6,I was looking up Andrew Lee Potts who plays in SyFy's Alice and BBC's Primeval. Netflix had it for rent so I watched it. I have to say first off if you really don't like British movies (a real UK movie like Formula 51 with Samuel L. Jackson)  or never really seen them (Harry Potter does count to a point) you may not get it. I laughed so hard my jaw and abs hurt mostly because I was watching it at 2am and I didn't want to wake anyone up. I thought it was 20 times better than Waiting mostly because it wasn't gross like Waiting.,1331683200,,531,4.009433962264151
2736031,2,B000MGUZB6,I kept waiting for this movie to earn the ratings that it had... Total waste of time! The characters are annoying and the storyline make me fidgety and nervous. I do not recommend this film at all.,1327795200,,197,4.351351351351352
2736032,4,B000MGUZB6,"I originally purchased this DVD because I went through an ""Andrew Lee-Potts"" phase. I'm glad I did. (Though if that's why you're thinking of purchasing it, I have to tell you that he doesn't get a lot of screen time, maybe 20 minutes or so.)

This movie is everything I could have hoped for and certainly worth the money. The casting directors made excellent decisions, the cast performed perfectly, and all-in-all it just works.

The only negative thing I can offer is that there is a few spots in the movie where it kind of drags, but it ends quickly.

The movie itself is a series of stories all taking place at the same time, in the same cafe. It's lots of dialogue, so if you're not into that, I wouldn't recommend this one. There are a few secrets, a lot of drama, and a bit of dry/a bit of raunchy humor. There are these ""day dream sequences"" that I found hilarious scattered throughout the interactions of the day, and the end ties things up nicely (so there isn't a lot of those ""unfinished business"" feelings.)

I would recommend this film for a movie night, family night, or for any ol' occasion.",1320278400,,1107,4.465346534653466
2736033,5,B000MGUZB6,love the english accents and very funny story with lots of characters.  was easy to keep track of them all.  will watch many more times.,1276905600,,136,4.4

8169126,4,B000MGUZB6,"Good diversion movie to get lost in a world centered in a British coffee house. I like how they kept the movie going even though touching on each character's story. Even though there are American actors mixed in and some making an accent, it works well (expect Kath H. who is not good at anything). However the cast members are (or who they are), you will find a moment. I recommend to watch for fun and something completely different.",1435708800,,435,4.518987341772152
8169127,5,B000MGUZB6,This was one of those movies that makes taking a chance on an unknown movie worthwhile. The entire cast was excellent and the story well written. Marsha Thomason should be a star and Mena Suvari really took to her role of the very opinionated fiesty waitress. Great little film.,1427241600,,278,4.6938775510204085
