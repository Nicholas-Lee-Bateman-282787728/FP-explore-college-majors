8677282,3,B00NBU45HK,"This blu ray DVD contains 23 choruses from 17 Verdi operas.  The source material is the Tutto Verdi series of the complete 26 operas commissioned for Verdi's 200th birthday.  The Choruses are presented in the order of opera composition.  Since the productions were independent there is considerable variability is staging, costuming and camera work.  In general the images are good with good color balance.  The sound is fine.  There is no linkage between the choruses.  There is no supplementary material on the DVD itself and except for a track list there is no information about the productions themselves.  Some, but not all, of the Choruses can be considered ""great.""  At a very personal level I thought that the rendition of ""Va', pensiero"" which opens the program was the weakest of the several productions that I own or have seen.",1428969600,4,838,4.971223021582734
