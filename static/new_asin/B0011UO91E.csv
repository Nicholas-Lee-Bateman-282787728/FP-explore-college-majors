3068291,5,B0011UO91E,I'm a huge Entourage fan...got every season on dvd...watch then all the time. Season 4 is just as awesome. Can't wait for saeson 5 to come out on dvd!,1222300800,,150,4.206896551724138
3068292,5,B0011UO91E,"You can't go wrong with this season...it's got everything classic about Entourage all over it. Eric is still neurotic, Vinnie is a gambler, Johnny is holding on to his star and Turtle is well...Turtle! If you have seen even one episode of Entourage you know it's worth it to buy the complete season DVD sets. This is a show that's not just for the guys but us ladies love too!  It's definitely not for the kiddies though!",1222041600,,421,4.467532467532467
3068293,3,B0011UO91E,"I've really enjoyed seasons 1-3, even when season 3 couldn't seem to find another storyline that making Medellin.  The first episode of season 4 was awful -- I barely made it through.  By far the best part of season 4 was Ari and his attempts to do good in his devilish way.  Vince was likable as always, but nothing noteworthy.  Eric was in over his head and I get that he's supposed to be growing as a person after spending all this time in LA but I'm just not liking the fact that it's starting to go to his head.  Turtle and Drama are great when they appear, but what happened to real storylines of their own?  Turtle's career and dates?  Seeing Drama in action without Turtle?  I'll keep watching the series, but it's just not as good as the first few seasons.",1221523200,3,765,4.300699300699301
3068294,5,B0011UO91E,I love Entourage. I think its one of the best shows hbo has. The 4th season was very entertaining. I thought it was great how they kept you wondering on whether Medellin was good or not and then there was the ending which had the usual entourage flair and style that we all have come to love. I look forward to the 5th season.,1221177600,,326,4.109375
3068295,5,B0011UO91E,"I've seen all the seasons of entourage and this one doesn't disappoint.  And as for the reviewer that says the Jane's Addiction ""Superhero"" intro is ""nowhere to be found"" is... well, uh wrong.  In the first episode it doesn't come in right away but the intro we all know and love is most assuredly in every episode.

One thing I was a little disappointed in was that Turtle's girl (Rufus' daughter) from the last season is no where to be found.  Not that I really cared if she was on the show again, but there's not even an explanation for her departure.  If she had been kept in though, I feel that Turtle's character could have been developed a bit more.  At least we find out where Sloan and E stand.

There is a repetitive nature to the show that is starting to take it's toll on the enjoyablility of the series.  It just seems that every single episode the boys find some project, or something goes right, then 2 minutes later some little quirk happens that turns it into a complete disaster and vice versa.  It just kind of feels like nothing ever sticks and it can become a little tedious at times.  I've also found that Lloyd's character is starting to become annoying.

All in all it's basically the same entourage that has been a success over 4 seasons so maybe it's a good thing.  I'd actually give this DVD set 4 and a half stars if I could, but I figured I'd round up since I am a fan of the series and the season.  If you enjoyed the other seasons of entourage you're bound to enjoy this one, but there may be times when you start to grow a little tired of the same plot formats.",1221177600,,1593,4.27
3068296,5,B0011UO91E,"I was surprised by how many people didn't like drama's and Turtle's role in this season. I didn't expext drama to cook for the group forever, his career takes off in this season, and he might have finally found his true love.

I do have to admit little has change with turtle. He's just same old Turtle. This is something the writers should change next season

Another major player is billy walsh the director of medellin and QB, and his struggle with producer eric.

Even after a huge hit like aqua man vincent chase still has a hard time getting a movie role.

Ari's character really changes this season as he becomes a little emotional about events that he cant control. By far my favorite character in the show.

Eric is learning more about managing and producing and is trying to establish his career as such.

All and all my wife and I enjoyed the season and this is one of our favorite shows.",1220659200,,899,4.451219512195122
3068297,5,B0011UO91E,"This is actually my favorite season of Entourage. My only disappointment was the disappearance of Debi Mazar and Emmanuelle Chriqui, (I think they were only in like one episode). Anyways, I don't want give anything away, but I am really excited to see what happens. If you are a fan of Entourage, you will enjoy this season!",1220400000,,324,4.701754385964913
3068298,4,B0011UO91E,"I bought the Entourage series on a Gold Box Deal--a whim.  I don't have HBO and had barely even heard of the show, so I had nothing to compare to.  The show starts off in Season 1 as a great watch.  The cast is memorable and humorous, and the story line is pretty easy to follow however I'd be hard pressed to stay attentive week to week after a 30 minute stint for each show.  I tell my friends who've never heard of it that it's a male version of Sex in the City--but not really.  This show doesn't focus on relationships, rather an actor and his brother, cousin, and best friend and their ""lavish"" life in California.  Vince, the main character plays the excellent role in being a ""not so perfect"" actor who in the end tries to stay true to his original game of what he was born to do--acting.  Drama, his brother is absolutely hilarious.  Check out the ""Saigon"" episode; I still chuckle at him in Walsh's hotel room.

Turtle and Eric's characters are true staples in the show. They do more in providing the assists for the humor rather than being the punchlines themselves.

Ari is the absolute quiet thunder in this entire show.  He starts out as ""Vince's Agent"", but is really so much more to the group.  His antics and quips are the most hilarious.  His funniest line (to me) is in one of the episodes where he's trying to land Vince the huge movie.  (I'm not into spoilers)

Watching all the shows together lets you see the evolvement of all the actors.  While Seasons 1-3 had some great runs and a nice ending, Season 4 actually kind of milked itself.  I've got all of one sentence to say about Season 4 (out of them all).  Although it had the same amount of humor as the others--it did evolve in that sense, the actual plot took 12 shows to hash out!  The show kinds of leaves you to carry out your own assessments:  Turtle isn't working with anyone since Saigon and Drama probably isn't cooking because he's so busy with the new show.  There's more, but I won't dwell.  I don't plan to watch Season 5 until it finishes, then I'll probably download it from iTunes or something to that effect.

As I say with all movies and DVD packs, it's better to wait until their cheaper or on sale.",1220227200,,2195,4.352216748768473
3068299,4,B0011UO91E,"I press ""Play.""  The HBO static kicks in.  Yet, the ""Superhero"" theme by Jane's Addiction is nowhere to be found.  Before we begin, ENTOURAGE's 4th season presents a mini-documentary (like THE OFFICE) detailing the trials and tribulations of getting a dream project made.  This change of pace promises great things to come; the premiere episode of ENTOURAGE's fourth season will undoubtedly go down as one of its greatest.

As the show continues, it continues its solid streak for a while.  Although the remaining 11 episodes are shot in the traditional style we've seen this show use for years, things become even more desparate and challenging for Eric, Vince, and Ari than ever before.  Their domestic lives and careers are really put through the ringer this time.

Eric continues to try to expand his career, but struggles to get what he wants most: Respect.  Vince actually matures more than the rest of the cast this season.  His optimism is no longer a boyish laziness; he actually steps up to plate when the line is drawn in the sand.  Ari Gold has plenty of issues on his own.  If you thought his financial woes in seasons' past made him a bitter man, wait until you see how his domestic life tests his aggressive masculinity.

You may have noticed I haven't mentioned Turtle or Johnny Drama yet.  Well frankly, ENTOURAGE really drops the ball with them this season.  While the gang's rapport is still very funny, I'm frustrated that neither of these two characters have shown any growth since the show began in 2004.  Seriously, does Turtle really only think about sex, weed, and assorted materials?  Gimme a break!  Drama's insecurities are becoming pathetic, but at least Kevin Dillon's brilliant performance still sells it.  Never once did I think that Drama wouldn't behave the way he does.

I don't want to give away any cameos, but be assured that they all pay off.  Remember Scarlett Johannson's pointless bit from the Season One finale?  Don't worry, you won't find any of that useless ""Hey-Look-It's-Him/Her"" garbage.

Special mention also has to go to Rhys Coiro's turn as crazed auteur Billy Walsh.  While I can't believe a man like that is inspired by a real person, he's given just the right amount of screentime (and madness) to be effective, but not overstay his welcome.  Also, Perrey Reeves and Rex Lee (as Mrs. Ari and Lloyd, respectively) get to kind of ""star"" in their own individual episode.  While neither really contributes anything significant to Season Four's overall story, they were a nice change of pace.

I guess that last sentence summarizes my overall reaction to Season Four.  I found these 12 episodes to be very entertaining, and with plenty of neat ideas thrown in to keep things from getting stale.  But when I look at the season from beginning to end, the middle patch really doesn't have much to with the bookends.  For example, there's a nice small angle involving Anna Faris.  While it works the way it plays out, there were so many lateral moves the writers could've done with it.  But in the end, very little has changed.

That's the problem with Season Four - Nothing's Really Changed.

The creators had one of their best plots when Ari Gold wasn't in Vince's good graces.  That's why that particular season was so excellent.  The writers and creators took a chance.  But in Season Four, the chances are merely temporary.  For four years, I've watched these characters take small steps into uncharted waters, only to return to shore.  It's time to shake things up again before ENTOURAGE starts getting stale.  That day hasn't come yet, but be assured that this series is still a very slick, entertaining comedy.

SEASON TWO --> 8.0 / 10
SEASON THREE > 8.0 / 10 (Part 1)
SEASON THREE > 9.0 / 10 (Part 2)
SEASON FOUR -> 8.5 / 10",1219795200,20,3803,4.745038167938931
3068300,4,B0011UO91E,"I have enjoyed the HBO series ""Entourage"" since its first episode, but its fourth season somewhat squanders the gains its characters made in previous series.  Turtle and Johnny Drama have very little to do here; Turtle seems to have given up any chance at an outside career, and not only do we see little of Drama's television work, he doesn't even cook this season.  When Eric finally extends his management talent, the enterprise is uncerimoniously squashed.  And forget about relationships this season: Women only pop up here to fill the usual nudity quota.

The series mostly focuses on the post-production and potential sale of ""Medellin,"" the dream project for Vince, Eric, and unhinged director Billy Walsh, and the aside adventures of everyone's favorite agent, Ari Gold (played terrifically by Jeremy Piven).  The Gold plotlines are great but isolated, often making one feel as if there are two different shows going on here.  However, despite the season's narrow focus, you get the sense that these 12 episodes are preparing the viewer for some major changes in the lives of these Hollywood adventurers.

The DVD has a few audio commentaries, a nice making-of featurette of the ""making of 'Medellin,'"" a terrific, complete trailer for the film within the series, and a solid, 45-minute sit-down with show's creative heads and actors Kevin Connolly, Adrian Grenier, and Jeremy Piven.",1219795200,10,1392,5.16

3068337,4,B0011UO91E,"I really couldn't get into this series until episode 3 of season 1. Overall I think this is a good series with good acting, writing and situations. I would have given 5 stars except for one item, the Johnny ""Drama"" Chase character who is totally unrealistic and unbelievable not to mention irritating. Having worked in the industry for over 30 years, mostly in film, I realize we ask the audience to somewhat suspend belief while viewing our product. However, we don't expect them to totally deny reality. I can say with almost absolute certainty that a person like the ""Drama"" character would never get a job in ""Hollywood"". And if he ever did manage to get a job, he most certainly would never get a second. Also related is how the other characters relate to the ""Drama"" character as if he is totally normal. Other than this one character, this is a good series and worth the time to watch it. Do be advised that the dialog contains quite a few obscenities, especially the ""F"" word, so those with tender sensibilities should probably skip this one.",1477612800,,1050,4.650537634408602

3068555,5,B0011UO91E,"Entourage is loosely based on the life and times of Mark Wahlburg & his ""entourage"" that he grew up with.

The episodes are short and sweet. I always have at least one big *GASP* moment, several laughs, & occasionally a bit of anger. Guaranteed laughs, if you like crude humor. Lots of dick jokes & harassing each other over their conquests. That can get a little old here and there.
The star of the show, in my opinion, is Ari Gold, played by Jeremy Piven. Ari is the male version of ME!...if I had his job & his money. He never fails to make EVERY scene that he's in...compelling & full of F-Bombs. That NEVER gets old.
I'd recommended EVERY single season...& of course... ENTOURAGE THE MOVIE! Released 2015...now on Amazon Prime to rent or own!",1453593600,,747,4.492647058823529

3068637,4,B0011UO91E,"Entourage keeps chugging along; they are starting to run into a few of the pitfalls to contrast with their bro-tastic fairy tale life in Hollowwood.  The 'real' celebrity cameos are fun and the situations keep spinning in different directions.  This season centers around Vince's latest ""vanity"" project, Medellin, and how it's marketed and completed.  After being accepted at Cannes, the bidding war begins and escalates while nobody has really seen the finished film.  The season finishes at the french festival and what happens after.  There are interesting (but distracting) subplots about Ari's kids and wife's acting career, but as always the main focus is on the 'guys' and their perpetual search of booty, weed, and success (seemingly in that order).  Still a fun ride!",1444867200,,777,5.225806451612903

3068907,4,B0011UO91E,"Season 4 of Entourage hits a new level. Sure, the themes of party girls, weed, and Hollywood mayhem dominate, but the characters are growing. It kicks off with a ""behind the scenes look"" at the making of lead character Vince's pet project: Medellin. This episode alone is worth the price of the season. Things roll along with boys descending into Hollywood hades as their world crumbles with the vagaries and back stabbing of the business. Interestingly enough, Vince's manager, E, becomes the least likable character, as he strives for more respect but the writers don't give him the depth needed to show the frailties of such a quest in an environment where honor is hard to come by. Nonetheless, I enjoyed this season more than 2 and 3, most of all because it's not a bed of roses and beautiful women all the time but an equal measure of pain and disappointment. Such is life in Hollywood.",1382745600,,892,4.687898089171974

3068918,5,B0011UO91E,"Season 3 made me question why I was still watching this vacuous series but Season 4 gets back on track. Mainly, getting Ari Gold (Jeremy Piven) back as Vince's agent is what was needed.

Add to that gratuitous Gary Busey, and far more interesting angles involving the Billy Walsh as an unhinged semi-genius in his own mind, Johnny Drama and even Turtle's adventures are hilariously good...maybe it's because the series decides to de-emphasize Vince (Adrian Grenier) and make him more the Jerry Seinfeld type calm amidst the storm rather than the main focus or have him go off with a Mandy Moore thereby boring us to tears.

Where the series works is when guys get to be guys period.

The extras are mostly fun, too, including a making of the making of the Medellin ""movie,"" a trailer for the movie (ohh, sorry, Billy Walsh ""fillum"") that really makes you wish this was an actual film, a dopey interview with Doug Ellin's son who plays Ari's son in one scene, another snoozefest sitdown with the crew at some festival and the season 1-3 recaps.",1328832000,,1043,4.688524590163935

As a native Colombian, I did feel disappointed that Entourage also failed to depict Colombia properly. Seems like they followed the stereotype of the small town-village setting (that we do have, but in the rural areas) to make it seem as if the entire country is so underdeveloped. Because of the satirical and comic nature of Entourage, I let it pass. Just a thought.",1289433600,,607,4.780952380952381

Didn't dig this one nearly as much as season three, mainly because there wasn't enough of Dillon and Piven, my reasons for watching the show. Vince and Eric are pleasant enough, but really not that funny. And I watch this show to laugh, so the Medellin story line gets a little old due to its semi-seriousness. I also got more than a bit tired of the Walsh character, who might be accurate as a type but really isn't very funny and grates pretty hard after a while.

Nonetheless, the writing is still strong and there are enough solid laughs to make it worth watching.",1262390400,,579,4.452830188679245

3068928,4,B0011UO91E,"One of the things that surprised me when I first started watching ENTOURAGE was that you saw nothing of Vince's professional life.  He shot movies but the show would end as he left to shoot something and then pick back up again when he returned.  I thought that was a interesting choice and the show still worked.

But as each season appears, we're getting more and more involved in the process of making movies and it's really paying off for the series.

We're not only seeing them ""film"" Vince's projects now, we're even treated to the a ""Making Of"" featurette to kick off the 4th season.

Still love the show, still want to see more...still can't get enough of Ari Gold's antics and profanity-laden rants.  I guess Jeremy Piven has several Emmys and you'll see why when he catch him as Agent Ari Gold.  The idea of giving him Lloyd as a secretary was a gold mine in itself and their scenes, as usual, steal the show.

Perhaps all the great story lines have been used up.  But then a lot of shows seem to flounder a bit after a few years and some success. There seemed to be more focus on Vince, E and Ari(he is starting to get on my nerves big time) at the expense of Turtle and Drama, who I think are the two funniest characters on the show.  Hopefully Season 5 (and 6) will turn it around.",1248220800,,517,3.895238095238095
3068931,5,B0011UO91E,"After 3 stunning seasons of Entourage, the writers and producers seem to be trying to make a transition for the show and the characters.  Episode 1 is the making of Medellin and the show uses a technique where the characters are talking to the cameras as a ""ghost"" reporter takes their points of view.  It is very well done and the Season 4 is off and running.

As the season progressed, I found myself enjoying the shows, and here's the ""but"":  They were going over much of the same territory.  Yes, the guys have made some moves and changes, but there wasn't anything new developing.  Ari is still stealing his scenes, and Lloyd is now coming around.  There are some new character traits that are beginning to show - especially with Ari, but not enough to give the show its edge back.

That is, however, until episode ""Snow Job"" begins.  Everything changes.  The writers have made a successful transition to an entirely new level.  The season's finale, ""The Cannes Kids"" blows the doors off.  The writing is superb, the filming is getting better and better.  This is the best 30 minute show on television.  Can't wait to begin Season 5.",1242259200,,1138,4.625

3068933,4,B0011UO91E,"I enjoyed this season just as much as previous ones, however I do feel the series is running out of steam. Stories get kind of repetitive, there is no real character growth. Ari, Lloyd and Bill Walsh carried this season for me. Unlike many reviewers, I liked the first episode very much.

I also don't look for any kind of moral message in this show. I am a woman and it is obvious that women in this show are mainly portrayed as sexual objects. However, it seems to be a reality in the world of money and fame. Instead I like getting an insight in the world of filmmaking. I never thought it was so complex...

On a negative note, what I don't like about this show is a huge number of dropped story lines. It wasn't that noticeable in previous seasons, but this time it stood out for me.",1235952000,,788,4.246666666666667

3068935,4,B0011UO91E,"I've been following Entourage since the first episode, and let me tell you that this series have never disappointed me.

However, despite the plot improvements (there are some), this season looked to me ""weaker"" than the others...

This is what what I loved:

- We get to know a little bit more of every character (finally Vince gets a little bit more of personality,  and Johnny & Turtle become more familiar and closeer tu us... what would Entourage be without them? It's about the entourage baby, as the name says!. Eric, in my opinion, becomes more annoying, but it's my personal view...). I just love ""Drama"", Turtle & Ari (you can start seeing Lloyd potential as a more regular character in this season!)...

Anyway, I feel that after the first two chapters, the general tone of the season ""weakens"" and becomes ""monotone"". Even Ari, always a great character, is ""softer"" in the chapters.

I asked myself at some point: ""Will we keep seeing the same 'sucess-decline-broke-sucess' predictable plot in the next chapters""?... I hope not, I answered myself.

Well, at least, the season finale is a surprise (and a good chapter, BTW) but only after 10 weak episodes... The good thing is that the finale left me with a good taste of what could be coming next season (I feel it will be better than the first ones!).

Look, Entourage is the ""new Seinfeld"" for men in the 2000's, and after 4 seasons of constant & true entertainment, I truly believe that we have 2 or 3 more years of adventure & luxury from Vince and his true friends. My humble opinion is that the next seasons will show us a drastic change from the usual plot and will get us closer to the characters subplots and more new Hollywood (and out-Hollywood) twists.

Entourage is a show that, no matter what comes in the next episodes or years, I will always remember the best TV show for men of the first decade of XXI century. True!",1233273600,,1895,4.616071428571429
3068936,4,B0011UO91E,"The boys continue their whacky adventures in Hollywood. Perhaps this series is a step up from the last.

The ""Medellin"" film project becomes more tongue-in-cheek as it nears completion. Eventually, the boys take it to the Cannes film festival in France, and several prickly situations result. As a benefit of the focus on ""Medellin"", we get to see more of the odball up-and-coming director Billy Walsh (Rhys Coiro) and his many clashes with important people.

The leads continue in top form. Once again, there's plenty of Ari (Jeremy Piven), as he faces all kinds of new challenges, including getting his son into the right school and handling an employee who has slept with his twin brother's wife (the twin brother is also an employee, who is the beloved agent of major client Mary J. Blige). Oh yeah, and Drama (Kevin Dillon) gets a surprise from an old lady in the spa...

Just like the first three seasons, you can easily polish this one off over a lazy weekend. This time, however, it's just that little bit more memorable...",1233187200,,1031,4.780898876404494

As I watched each episode, I came down with a serious case of deja vu.  Their problems were all the same: Vince out of money, Drama trying to resurrect his career and Turtle just trying to score.  And while something bad might happen, something better would come along in five minutes or so.  I will admit I was pleasantly surprised with the final episode, but it just wasn't enough.  I hope they can heighten the tension in Season 5, because the first 3 have been some of the best TV I've seen recently.",1226793600,2,746,4.292857142857143

Most of the tv shows seems to be the life and times of people within a certain geographic region with a little skin to show as well.  Even at least sex and the city was witty.
But this show is insulting to demeaning to women, and sets a bad example to society.  It seems like the only thing on these boys minds are sex, self pleasure, and how to make a lot of money no matter the ethics and morals involved.  If you can relate to this show and want to live this type of lifestyle, then I can see how you would like it.  Otherwise, there really isn't all that much to this show.  It appeals to the base nature of men, and not necessarily those looking for something a bit less superficial.  Likewise to hbo's new series ""True Blood"".  Rednecks and vampires.. hello?  that is like mixing water and oil.

Vince and Eric have been chasing this script around since Season 2 (Aquaman), but were never able to land it. Now, with Billy Walsh behind the camera, they hope to recreate the magic so wonderfully employed in Queens Boulevard. Certain that it's a hit, and after a leaked trailer stirs up Hollywood hype, Walsh puts the movie on the open market in Cannes for the highest bidder. Ari, being Ari, creates a bidding war even before the film is debuted, and everybody is (about to be) rich and happy. This season entertains beyond expectations, involving more of our beloved characters than ever before. Of course, the boys are always a hoot with their specific antics, such as Johnny Drama faking cancer just to get a hat.

And as for the reviewer that says the Jane's Addiction ""Superhero"" intro is ""nowhere to be found"" is... well, uh wrong.  In the first episode it doesn't come in right away but the intro we all know and love is most assuredly in every episode.

One thing I was a little disappointed in was that Turtle's girl (Rufus' daughter) from the last season is no where to be found.  Not that I really cared if she was on the show again, but there's not even an explanation for her departure.  If she had been kept in though, I feel that Turtle's character could have been developed a bit more.  At least we find out where Sloan and E stand.

There is a repetitive nature to the show that is starting to take it's toll on the enjoyablility of the series.  It just seems that every single episode the boys find some project, or something goes right, then 2 minutes later some little quirk happens that turns it into a complete disaster and vice versa.  It just kind of feels like nothing ever sticks and it can become a little tedious at times.  I've also found that Lloyd's character is starting to become annoying.

All in all it's basically the same entourage that has been a success over 4 seasons so maybe it's a good thing.  I'd actually give this DVD set 4 and a half stars if I could, but I figured I'd round up since I am a fan of the series and the season.

I do have to admit little has change with turtle. He's just same old Turtle. This is something the writers should change next season

Another major player is billy walsh the director of medellin and QB, and his struggle with producer eric.

Even after a huge hit like aqua man vincent chase still has a hard time getting a movie role.

Ari's character really changes this season as he becomes a little emotional about events that he cant control. By far my favorite character in the show.

I tell my friends who've never heard of it that it's a male version of Sex in the City--but not really.  This show doesn't focus on relationships, rather an actor and his brother, cousin, and best friend and their ""lavish"" life in California.  Vince, the main character plays the excellent role in being a ""not so perfect"" actor who in the end tries to stay true to his original game of what he was born to do--acting.  Drama, his brother is absolutely hilarious.  Check out the ""Saigon"" episode; I still chuckle at him in Walsh's hotel room.

Turtle and Eric's characters are true staples in the show. They do more in providing the assists for the humor rather than being the punchlines themselves.

Ari is the absolute quiet thunder in this entire show.  He starts out as ""Vince's Agent"", but is really so much more to the group.  His antics and quips are the most hilarious.  His funniest line (to me) is in one of the episodes where he's trying to land Vince the huge movie.  (I'm not into spoilers)

Watching all the shows together lets you see the evolvement of all the actors.  While Seasons 1-3 had some great runs and a nice ending, Season 4 actually kind of milked itself.  I've got all of one sentence to say about Season 4 (out of them all).  Although it had the same amount of humor as the others--it did evolve in that sense, the actual plot took 12 shows to hash out!  The show kinds of leaves you to carry out your own assessments:  Turtle isn't working with anyone since Saigon and Drama probably isn't cooking because he's so busy with the new show.  There's more, but I won't dwell.  I don't plan to watch Season 5 until it finishes, then I'll probably download it from iTunes or something to that effect.

As I say with all movies and DVD packs, it's better to wait until their cheaper or on sale.",1220227200,,2195,4.352216748768473
3302796,4,B0011UO91E,"I press ""Play.""  The HBO static kicks in.  Yet, the ""Superhero"" theme by Jane's Addiction is nowhere to be found.  Before we begin, ENTOURAGE's 4th season presents a mini-documentary (like THE OFFICE) detailing the trials and tribulations of getting a dream project made.  This change of pace promises great things to come; the premiere episode of ENTOURAGE's fourth season will undoubtedly go down as one of its greatest.

As the show continues, it continues its solid streak for a while.  Although the remaining 11 episodes are shot in the traditional style we've seen this show use for years, things become even more desparate and challenging for Eric, Vince, and Ari than ever before.  Their domestic lives and careers are really put through the ringer this time.

Eric continues to try to expand his career, but struggles to get what he wants most: Respect.  Vince actually matures more than the rest of the cast this season.  His optimism is no longer a boyish laziness; he actually steps up to plate when the line is drawn in the sand.  Ari Gold has plenty of issues on his own.  If you thought his financial woes in seasons' past made him a bitter man, wait until you see how his domestic life tests his aggressive masculinity.

You may have noticed I haven't mentioned Turtle or Johnny Drama yet.  Well frankly, ENTOURAGE really drops the ball with them this season.  While the gang's rapport is still very funny, I'm frustrated that neither of these two characters have shown any growth since the show began in 2004.  Seriously, does Turtle really only think about sex, weed, and assorted materials?  Gimme a break!  Drama's insecurities are becoming pathetic, but at least Kevin Dillon's brilliant performance still sells it.  Never once did I think that Drama wouldn't behave the way he does.

I don't want to give away any cameos, but be assured that they all pay off.  Remember Scarlett Johannson's pointless bit from the Season One finale?  Don't worry, you won't find any of that useless ""Hey-Look-It's-Him/Her"" garbage.

Special mention also has to go to Rhys Coiro's turn as crazed auteur Billy Walsh.  While I can't believe a man like that is inspired by a real person, he's given just the right amount of screentime (and madness) to be effective, but not overstay his welcome.  Also, Perrey Reeves and Rex Lee (as Mrs. Ari and Lloyd, respectively) get to kind of ""star"" in their own individual episode.  While neither really contributes anything significant to Season Four's overall story, they were a nice change of pace.

I guess that last sentence summarizes my overall reaction to Season Four.  I found these 12 episodes to be very entertaining, and with plenty of neat ideas thrown in to keep things from getting stale.  But when I look at the season from beginning to end, the middle patch really doesn't have much to with the bookends.  For example, there's a nice small angle involving Anna Faris.  While it works the way it plays out, there were so many lateral moves the writers could've done with it.  But in the end, very little has changed.

That's the problem with Season Four - Nothing's Really Changed.

The creators had one of their best plots when Ari Gold wasn't in Vince's good graces.  That's why that particular season was so excellent.  The writers and creators took a chance.  But in Season Four, the chances are merely temporary.  For four years, I've watched these characters take small steps into uncharted waters, only to return to shore.  It's time to shake things up again before ENTOURAGE starts getting stale.  That day hasn't come yet, but be assured that this series is still a very slick, entertaining comedy.

3302797,4,B0011UO91E,"I have enjoyed the HBO series ""Entourage"" since its first episode, but its fourth season somewhat squanders the gains its characters made in previous series.  Turtle and Johnny Drama have very little to do here; Turtle seems to have given up any chance at an outside career, and not only do we see little of Drama's television work, he doesn't even cook this season.  When Eric finally extends his management talent, the enterprise is uncerimoniously squashed.  And forget about relationships this season: Women only pop up here to fill the usual nudity quota.

The series mostly focuses on the post-production and potential sale of ""Medellin,"" the dream project for Vince, Eric, and unhinged director Billy Walsh, and the aside adventures of everyone's favorite agent, Ari Gold (played terrifically by Jeremy Piven).  The Gold plotlines are great but isolated, often making one feel as if there are two different shows going on here.  However, despite the season's narrow focus, you get the sense that these 12 episodes are preparing the viewer for some major changes in the lives of these Hollywood adventurers.

The DVD has a few audio commentaries, a nice making-of featurette of the ""making of 'Medellin,'"" a terrific, complete trailer for the film within the series, and a solid, 45-minute sit-down with show's creative heads and actors Kevin Connolly, Adrian Grenier, and Jeremy Piven.",1219795200,10,1392,5.16

I would have given 5 stars except for one item, the Johnny ""Drama"" Chase character who is totally unrealistic and unbelievable not to mention irritating. Having worked in the industry for over 30 years, mostly in film, I realize we ask the audience to somewhat suspend belief while viewing our product. However, we don't expect them to totally deny reality. I can say with almost absolute certainty that a person like the ""Drama"" character would never get a job in ""Hollywood"". And if he ever did manage to get a job, he most certainly would never get a second. Also related is how the other characters relate to the ""Drama"" character as if he is totally normal. Other than this one character, this is a good series and worth the time to watch it. Do be advised that the dialog contains quite a few obscenities, especially the ""F"" word, so those with tender sensibilities should probably skip this one.",1477612800,,1050,4.650537634408602

3303052,5,B0011UO91E,"Entourage is loosely based on the life and times of Mark Wahlburg & his ""entourage"" that he grew up with.

The episodes are short and sweet. I always have at least one big *GASP* moment, several laughs, & occasionally a bit of anger. Guaranteed laughs, if you like crude humor. Lots of dick jokes & harassing each other over their conquests. That can get a little old here and there.
The star of the show, in my opinion, is Ari Gold, played by Jeremy Piven. Ari is the male version of ME!...if I had his job & his money. He never fails to make EVERY scene that he's in...compelling & full of F-Bombs. That NEVER gets old.
I'd recommended EVERY single season...& of course... ENTOURAGE THE MOVIE! Released 2015...now on Amazon Prime to rent or own!",1453593600,,747,4.492647058823529

3303134,4,B0011UO91E,"Entourage keeps chugging along; they are starting to run into a few of the pitfalls to contrast with their bro-tastic fairy tale life in Hollowwood.  The 'real' celebrity cameos are fun and the situations keep spinning in different directions.  This season centers around Vince's latest ""vanity"" project, Medellin, and how it's marketed and completed.  After being accepted at Cannes, the bidding war begins and escalates while nobody has really seen the finished film.  The season finishes at the french festival and what happens after.  There are interesting (but distracting) subplots about Ari's kids and wife's acting career, but as always the main focus is on the 'guys' and their perpetual search of booty, weed, and success (seemingly in that order).  Still a fun ride!",1444867200,,777,5.225806451612903

It kicks off with a ""behind the scenes look"" at the making of lead character Vince's pet project: Medellin. This episode alone is worth the price of the season. Things roll along with boys descending into Hollywood hades as their world crumbles with the vagaries and back stabbing of the business. Interestingly enough, Vince's manager, E, becomes the least likable character, as he strives for more respect but the writers don't give him the depth needed to show the frailties of such a quest in an environment where honor is hard to come by. Nonetheless, I enjoyed this season more than 2 and 3, most of all because it's not a bed of roses and beautiful women all the time but an equal measure of pain and disappointment. Such is life in Hollywood.",1382745600,,892,4.687898089171974

3303415,5,B0011UO91E,"Season 3 made me question why I was still watching this vacuous series but Season 4 gets back on track. Mainly, getting Ari Gold (Jeremy Piven) back as Vince's agent is what was needed.

Add to that gratuitous Gary Busey, and far more interesting angles involving the Billy Walsh as an unhinged semi-genius in his own mind, Johnny Drama and even Turtle's adventures are hilariously good...maybe it's because the series decides to de-emphasize Vince (Adrian Grenier) and make him more the Jerry Seinfeld type calm amidst the storm rather than the main focus or have him go off with a Mandy Moore thereby boring us to tears.

Where the series works is when guys get to be guys period.

The extras are mostly fun, too, including a making of the making of the Medellin ""movie,"" a trailer for the movie (ohh, sorry, Billy Walsh ""fillum"") that really makes you wish this was an actual film, a dopey interview with Doug Ellin's son who plays Ari's son in one scene, another snoozefest sitdown with the crew at some festival and the season 1-3 recaps.",1328832000,,1043,4.688524590163935

As a native Colombian, I did feel disappointed that Entourage also failed to depict Colombia properly. Seems like they followed the stereotype of the small town-village setting (that we do have, but in the rural areas) to make it seem as if the entire country is so underdeveloped. Because of the satirical and comic nature of Entourage, I let it pass. Just a thought.",1289433600,,607,4.780952380952381

Vince and Eric are pleasant enough, but really not that funny. And I watch this show to laugh, so the Medellin story line gets a little old due to its semi-seriousness. I also got more than a bit tired of the Walsh character, who might be accurate as a type but really isn't very funny and grates pretty hard after a while.

Nonetheless, the writing is still strong and there are enough solid laughs to make it worth watching.",1262390400,,579,4.452830188679245

Overall it was a great season of Entourage to watch and if you haven't seen Entourage before, check it out.  It's something that shouldn't be missed.",1252972800,,383,4.602941176470588
3303425,4,B0011UO91E,"One of the things that surprised me when I first started watching ENTOURAGE was that you saw nothing of Vince's professional life.  He shot movies but the show would end as he left to shoot something and then pick back up again when he returned.  I thought that was a interesting choice and the show still worked.

But as each season appears, we're getting more and more involved in the process of making movies and it's really paying off for the series.

We're not only seeing them ""film"" Vince's projects now, we're even treated to the a ""Making Of"" featurette to kick off the 4th season.

Still love the show, still want to see more...still can't get enough of Ari Gold's antics and profanity-laden rants.  I guess Jeremy Piven has several Emmys and you'll see why when he catch him as Agent Ari Gold.  The idea of giving him Lloyd as a secretary was a gold mine in itself and their scenes, as usual, steal the show.

I don't know where they're going with this show...but I'm ready to go!",1252886400,2,991,4.466666666666667

3303427,3,B0011UO91E,"Compared with the first 3, season four seemed to lose a step or two.  Still funny, but it just didn't click the way it has for me in the past.  Perhaps all the great story lines have been used up.  But then a lot of shows seem to flounder a bit after a few years and some success. There seemed to be more focus on Vince, E and Ari(he is starting to get on my nerves big time) at the expense of Turtle and Drama, who I think are the two funniest characters on the show.  Hopefully Season 5 (and 6) will turn it around.",1248220800,,517,3.895238095238095
3303428,5,B0011UO91E,"After 3 stunning seasons of Entourage, the writers and producers seem to be trying to make a transition for the show and the characters.  Episode 1 is the making of Medellin and the show uses a technique where the characters are talking to the cameras as a ""ghost"" reporter takes their points of view.  It is very well done and the Season 4 is off and running.

As the season progressed, I found myself enjoying the shows, and here's the ""but"":  They were going over much of the same territory.  Yes, the guys have made some moves and changes, but there wasn't anything new developing.  Ari is still stealing his scenes, and Lloyd is now coming around.  There are some new character traits that are beginning to show - especially with Ari, but not enough to give the show its edge back.

That is, however, until episode ""Snow Job"" begins.  Everything changes.  The writers have made a successful transition to an entirely new level.  The season's finale, ""The Cannes Kids"" blows the doors off.  The writing is superb, the filming is getting better and better.  This is the best 30 minute show on television.  Can't wait to begin Season 5.",1242259200,,1138,4.625

3303430,4,B0011UO91E,"I enjoyed this season just as much as previous ones, however I do feel the series is running out of steam. Stories get kind of repetitive, there is no real character growth. Ari, Lloyd and Bill Walsh carried this season for me. Unlike many reviewers, I liked the first episode very much.

I also don't look for any kind of moral message in this show. I am a woman and it is obvious that women in this show are mainly portrayed as sexual objects. However, it seems to be a reality in the world of money and fame. Instead I like getting an insight in the world of filmmaking. I never thought it was so complex...

On a negative note, what I don't like about this show is a huge number of dropped story lines. It wasn't that noticeable in previous seasons, but this time it stood out for me.",1235952000,,788,4.246666666666667
3303431,5,B0011UO91E,"This is a great show...fun to watch.  It's also an interesting insight into Hollywood.  I also don't relate to these types of guys at all, but I still really enjoy watching it.",1234310400,,176,4.46875
3303432,4,B0011UO91E,"I've been following Entourage since the first episode, and let me tell you that this series have never disappointed me.

However, despite the plot improvements (there are some), this season looked to me ""weaker"" than the others...

This is what what I loved:

- We get to know a little bit more of every character (finally Vince gets a little bit more of personality,  and Johnny & Turtle become more familiar and closeer tu us... what would Entourage be without them? It's about the entourage baby, as the name says!. Eric, in my opinion, becomes more annoying, but it's my personal view...). I just love ""Drama"", Turtle & Ari (you can start seeing Lloyd potential as a more regular character in this season!)...

Anyway, I feel that after the first two chapters, the general tone of the season ""weakens"" and becomes ""monotone"". Even Ari, always a great character, is ""softer"" in the chapters.

I asked myself at some point: ""Will we keep seeing the same 'sucess-decline-broke-sucess' predictable plot in the next chapters""?... I hope not, I answered myself.

Well, at least, the season finale is a surprise (and a good chapter, BTW) but only after 10 weak episodes... The good thing is that the finale left me with a good taste of what could be coming next season (I feel it will be better than the first ones!).

Look, Entourage is the ""new Seinfeld"" for men in the 2000's, and after 4 seasons of constant & true entertainment, I truly believe that we have 2 or 3 more years of adventure & luxury from Vince and his true friends. My humble opinion is that the next seasons will show us a drastic change from the usual plot and will get us closer to the characters subplots and more new Hollywood (and out-Hollywood) twists.

Entourage is a show that, no matter what comes in the next episodes or years, I will always remember the best TV show for men of the first decade of XXI century. True!",1233273600,,1895,4.616071428571429
3303433,4,B0011UO91E,"The boys continue their whacky adventures in Hollywood. Perhaps this series is a step up from the last.

The ""Medellin"" film project becomes more tongue-in-cheek as it nears completion. Eventually, the boys take it to the Cannes film festival in France, and several prickly situations result. As a benefit of the focus on ""Medellin"", we get to see more of the odball up-and-coming director Billy Walsh (Rhys Coiro) and his many clashes with important people.

The leads continue in top form. Once again, there's plenty of Ari (Jeremy Piven), as he faces all kinds of new challenges, including getting his son into the right school and handling an employee who has slept with his twin brother's wife (the twin brother is also an employee, who is the beloved agent of major client Mary J. Blige). Oh yeah, and Drama (Kevin Dillon) gets a surprise from an old lady in the spa...

Just like the first three seasons, you can easily polish this one off over a lazy weekend. This time, however, it's just that little bit more memorable...",1233187200,,1031,4.780898876404494

There are a few new characters that you will love, a few twists and turns that keeps things interesting, and Drama takes a bigger role (which is kind of fun).  Overall, I think this is a must-have for people who have watched the first three seasons, and it definitely gives the series the bump it needed after a disappointing second half of season 3.

3303438,3,B0011UO91E,"This season is a bit of a downturn for the series featuring vince and the boys from Queens.  This one picks up where Season 3 left off with the gang heading down to South America to film ""Medellin"" and the efforts to get it shown at Cannes.

As I watched each episode, I came down with a serious case of deja vu.  Their problems were all the same: Vince out of money, Drama trying to resurrect his career and Turtle just trying to score.  And while something bad might happen, something better would come along in five minutes or so.  I will admit I was pleasantly surprised with the final episode, but it just wasn't enough.  I hope they can heighten the tension in Season 5, because the first 3 have been some of the best TV I've seen recently.",1226793600,2,746,4.292857142857143

3303440,2,B0011UO91E,"I thought that series on hbo would compare well to series found on regular tv channels, such as CSI on mainstream television.  Boy was I wrong.  Most of the tv shows seems to be the life and times of people within a certain geographic region with a little skin to show as well.  Even at least sex and the city was witty.
But this show is insulting to demeaning to women, and sets a bad example to society.  It seems like the only thing on these boys minds are sex, self pleasure, and how to make a lot of money no matter the ethics and morals involved.  If you can relate to this show and want to live this type of lifestyle, then I can see how you would like it.  Otherwise, there really isn't all that much to this show.  It appeals to the base nature of men, and not necessarily those looking for something a bit less superficial.  Likewise to hbo's new series ""True Blood"".  Rednecks and vampires.. hello?  that is like mixing water and oil.  Trying to mix the charismatic, powerful, and sexy to the stereotypical redneck just doesn't make sense..",1225238400,3,1051,4.365979381443299

3303448,5,B0011UO91E,"Season 4 of Entourage begins and ends with the Boys from Queens finally making the movie Medellin, the story of Pablo Escobar. Vince and Eric have been chasing this script around since Season 2 (Aquaman), but were never able to land it. Now, with Billy Walsh behind the camera, they hope to recreate the magic so wonderfully employed in Queens Boulevard. Certain that it's a hit, and after a leaked trailer stirs up Hollywood hype, Walsh puts the movie on the open market in Cannes for the highest bidder. Ari, being Ari, creates a bidding war even before the film is debuted, and everybody is (about to be) rich and happy. This season entertains beyond expectations, involving more of our beloved characters than ever before. Of course, the boys are always a hoot with their specific antics, such as Johnny Drama faking cancer just to get a hat. Mrs. Ari finds a much larger role as well, and Lloyd (Rex Lee) is credited in the opening title.
