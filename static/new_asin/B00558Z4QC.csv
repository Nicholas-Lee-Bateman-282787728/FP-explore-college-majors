8457646,4,B00558Z4QC,A good horror flick. Definitely worth having in your collection. Its got all the basics of any horror film...a predictable storyline but overall its a good watch!,1344297600,,162,5.037037037037037
8457647,1,B00558Z4QC,"I bought this DVD because of the couple of positive reviews. However, when I watched this movie to me it seemed more like a bad soap opera-no real scares or excitement just a dull slow moving piece of junk. I think they must have made this movie within a span of 24 hours. I like Kane in his other movies -but not this one. The people that gave this movie a five star rating were more than likely involved in making this mess. If you must see this-then just rent it DON'T BUY it like I did. Save your money.",1327449600,11,507,4.08
8457648,5,B00558Z4QC,"AS A LOVER OF LOW BUDGET MOVIES, I WANT TO SAY THIS ONE BRINGS TO MIND THOSE OLD DRIVE-IN HORROR MOVIES THAT SEEMED CHEESY, BUT HAVE THE ABILITY TO GET UNDER YOUR SKIN AND REMAIN MEMORABLE. THINK ABOUT WORKS LIKE ""BLACK CHRISTMAS"", ""MANSION OF THE DOOMED"", ""DON'T LOOK IN THE BASEMENT"", ""CANDY SNATCHERS"", ""SWEET SUGAR"", & COUNTLESS MORE THAT ARE INGRAINED IN THE MINDS OF SO MANY OF US ""70'S"" TEENAGERS THAT SAT IN A SMOKE-FILLED CAR ON A SATURDAY NIGHT, WATCHING THESE AMBITIOUS FILMMAKERS ROLL OUT THEIR TALES WITH LITTLE MONEY AND ENORMOUS IMAGINATIONS. THE LOOK AND FEEL OF THIS ONE HAD THAT SAME EFFECT-I AM READY TO SHOW IT TO MY FRIENDS THIS WEEKEND AND SEE HOW THEIR BEER-SOAKED BRAINS REACT TO IT. IT HAS A VERY DISTURBING PACE AND STYLE, NOT TO MENTION AN UNREASONABLY TWISTED STORYLINE. THE EFFECTS WORK IS UNBLINKINGLY (HA HA HA) PROFESSIONAL AND CONVINCING.
I HAVE SEEN SOME, IF NOT ALL, OF THE BRUNSWICKS' OTHER WORK. THEY HAVE BEEN HIT (""THEY MUST EAT"", ""LITTLE RED DEVIL"", ""BORN OF EARTH"", ""EVIL OFFSPRING"") AND MISS (""WRITER'S BLOCK"", ""THE REMAKE"", ""BIKER ZOMBIES FROM DETROIT""-WHICH HAS GROWN ON ME FOR ALL OF THE WRONG REASONS!), BUT HAVE GOTTEN PROGRESSIVELY BETTER AT THEIR CRAFT. I'LL BET THEY HAVE SOME FUTURE SURPRISES IN STORE FOR FANS OF THE GENRE, IF NOT THE ""INDUSTRY"". I'LL BE WATCHING...",1313798400,5,1318,4.81057268722467
8457649,5,B00558Z4QC,I loved this movie and am glad it's finally seeing the light of day!  Kudos to Kane and the crew for making it possible!  You all busted your chops to make it happen in record time and under incredible conditions!,1308096000,5,213,4.3
