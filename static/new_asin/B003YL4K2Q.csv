4230964,5,B003YL4K2Q,"This is the most realistic TV portrayal of American family life ever made. All the adults in RJ's life are perfect role models. His father shows up to the high school car-wash fundraiser just to point his camera at all the dripping-wet hot chicks. RJ's mother is an absolute doll. She catches him jacking off in bed, realizes what she has done and politely excuses herself. That night at the dinner table, she tells the other couple -- she and her husband are unapologetic swingers -- how cute RJ was when she caught him masturbating that morning. His school guidance counselor advises RJ to grab his dream girl on the rebound and ""hump the bejesus out of her."" His boss, Mrs. Robbins, seduces him. The two are caught in bed by Mr. Robbins who explodes in a fit of anger. When RJ tries to interrupt and explain himself, Mr. Robbins screams, ""Don't you say a word ... ... and ruin this perfect moment."" He then proceeds to strip down and jump into bed with his wife and the high-school boy she is seducing. Yes, the show is twisted.

All RJ wants is the girl his guidance counselor told him to ""hump the bejesus out of."" But not really; he wants her to want him for who he is. Twisted, but in the sweetest way you could ever imagine.",1284681600,9,1232,4.4035087719298245
4230965,1,B003YL4K2Q,"I love this show but didn't get to see every episode.  So I bought it hopes to do just that.  I should have checked the stats about the cd but I didn't. Come to find out there are no subtitles at all.  It's my fault for not checking, but I can't believe they would sell the show on dvd without subtitles for deaf and hearing impaired.  Really upset about spending the money and getting gyped for no subs. :(",1284076800,4,407,4.113924050632911
4230966,4,B003YL4K2Q,"Great show. Pretty raunchy, but HELLA funny! RJ is such a like-able character. You're rooting for him the whole time. He has a sweet heart and he's a good guy. Lily is hilarious and Miles is disgusting, but hilarious. I was really unsure when I saw the previews for this, but it's really funny. Quirky, but awesome. (Then again, I am in college so maybe it's just my age group) LOL.",1283126400,,382,4.394366197183099
4230967,5,B003YL4K2Q,I watched every episode on Mtv and I can't wait to bring it home. I love all the Miles one liners and his shirts!! Where can I get the shirts?????,1282953600,,146,3.9
4230968,5,B003YL4K2Q,"Some of ep2, pilot, got a little weird... when RJ's parents were talking to there friends at the dinner table... little awkward.

For the most part though, freaking hilarious. Especially when his pants fell down. I thought it was going to be cliche, but it was all turned on its head.

If you want to laugh. Watch this.

It'd be nice to see the main character grow as an individual and gain some bravery and put on some muscle as well as loose some of the dorkyness... but that probably will not happen.",1276214400,,503,4.387096774193548
4230969,5,B003YL4K2Q,A nice dirty little indulgence!,1405123200,,31,5.4
4230970,5,B003YL4K2Q,Loved the show.  Too bad amazon prime only give you one episode and makes you pay for the rest.  They should let you view the entire season or none at all.,1379462400,,155,3.967741935483871
4230971,4,B003YL4K2Q,"It's a fun time, and very watchable.  But to be honest I wouldn't have started watching the episodes if it wasn't for Amber Lancaster starring as Jenny; she makes it totally worthwhile.",1379203200,,185,4.78125
4230972,2,B003YL4K2Q,"This is just a silly series that constantly hints of sex and does not deliver.  The acting is weak, the direction is weak,
and the writing is weak.  Not much to like about this one.",1378166400,,181,4.142857142857143
4230973,5,B003YL4K2Q,received this and season 1 both great and was here in no time. no damage worked great keeps you laughing,1376956800,,104,4.25
4230974,3,B003YL4K2Q,"It seems hard to believe that the most pointless network ever would produce original programming worth watching. The show is ok, the actors are good, the writing is so so, the premise funny, although sophomoric.",1370044800,,211,5.057142857142857
4230975,5,B003YL4K2Q,"Such a great show, shame it was canceled.  Great for quick laughs and some hilarious moments.  Its definitely worth a watch.",1369785600,,124,4.857142857142857

4230977,4,B003YL4K2Q,"Three disc DVD ushers a viewer via a couple of months of fifteen year old teen maturing and his exploits since being indecently exposed during sport competition, amusing public with natural advantages dramatically .

Twenty minute segments are filled with bulling, cruelty, swearing and sexism both parents and kids actors don't look like mostly, parade much intensively than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Inbetweeners/dp/B003AYLBV0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Inbetweeners</a>&nbsp;do, and a scene of losing virginity in a hospital bed to a degree of heart-stopping (clinical death, or?) is surely leaves a broad room for speculating the further developments.

Probably, it was too much even for Hollywood after Season Two I intend borrowing at the library.",1369180800,2,810,6.4907407407407405
4230978,2,B003YL4K2Q,I have no idea why I bought this. I guess I just wanted something light hearted and silly. It was pretty dumb.,1367712000,,110,4.045454545454546
4230979,3,B003YL4K2Q,"The series showed some promise, but wish the characters were more developed. Needed more shows to see if granting an additional star is deserved.",1363478400,,145,5.083333333333333
4230980,5,B003YL4K2Q,"When I finally got to get into this series, I was expecting some type of typical teen comedy. Boy was I wrong.

I seek out comedy shows on TV than I do other types of shows and I had to give this a try since I heard great things about it and I was very surprised that such a show could come from MTV. To make my first point, this shouldn't have been on MTV at all. This is the *wrong* station for such a show given that the majority, which is around 90% of MTV, of the shows on MTV are ""reality"" TV shows, and no music, where animated shows and scripted shows should NOT be on. There hasn't been anything good from MTV in the last 15 years, but this show shined and won me over for all the right reasons.

To start out, it's a older teen show which caters to the teens who do nothing but talk about love and sex, but in a comedy format. (Bunch of sexual jokes/innuendo...)

In a nutshell about what the show is, it's about our protagonist, R.J. and him being the loser at the school and the punching bag for the basketball jocks. During a basketball game, I won't spoil why he was on the team, his shorts fell in front of everyone after a big game against a rival school. Little did everyone know, R.J. has, to be blunt, a larger than average penis that shocked everyone at the school. The series has a large variety of animated shorts that tell the story of certain parts in the show that add to the already funny story. Many will be surprised at the quality of work the animation team(s?) did for this series. That's just the start of the crazy events following him and his friends throughout the series.

In all, I just want to say that I'm very shocked that it had to be canceled after the two seasons. The only reason why it was canned is because, yes, again with this, it was on MTV. A station where the majority of people avoid because it has such a horrible line-up of shows, if you can even call some that. I would love to see this show come back on another network that's not run by MTV productions. A network like IFC or FX is where this show would have won over more people.",1328918400,,2086,4.14320987654321
4230981,3,B003YL4K2Q,"I got this episode through a free promotion.  The video quality was okay, but I would not pay full price for each episode.",1328659200,,122,4.304347826086956
4230982,5,B003YL4K2Q,"First a pet peeve.  Why must people continue to provide adverse reviews that have nothing to do with actual merits of the show?  My discs were scratched, the packaging is asymmetrical, etc.  Boo fricking woo!  This would be synonymous with me giving this series a 1* rating because I dislike the Key Grip and the Best Boy!  For a show with a small number of reviews this is a real disservice.

This is a laugh out loud funny show that will NOT appeal to everyone.  The humor is vulgar and for the most part has sexual overtones.  The closest comparable would be the UK series ""The Inbetweeners.""  If you like ""The Inbetweeners"" you will like this.  I watched 2-seasons in 2-days and still find myself laughing at some of the one liners.

There is a reasonable enough outline of the show on Amazon.  My highest recco for anyone that likes this type of comedy.",1315785600,,858,4.5
4230983,5,B003YL4K2Q,"Wow! what a great tv show! Haven't seen one like this in a while! Not many shows in a high school environment are done as well as this. From the cast, to the funny jokes, it's an amazing show. And i recommend watching it. You never know, I didn't think I would like it.",1313798400,,269,4.0
4230984,4,B003YL4K2Q,Love this funny and irreverent show.  This is definitely not for kids but very entertaining for adults.  It would get five stars if they put more episodes on each disk so you don't have to change disks so frequently.,1303776000,,216,4.512820512820513
4230985,5,B003YL4K2Q,"My friend told me about this show and it sounded like it was decent. So, based upon his high recommendation, I got this DVD from Amazon, and I was NOT Disappointed!

First thing is that this is a burn-to-order DVD like others have said, but you could have fooled me! The DVD is a sliver DVD, not a purple DVD-R, with the label painted on, no sticker!

Second the series is hilarious!!!! It reminds me of my High School days more than most teen comedies, as the characters are very believable and the humor is very funny but not over the top zany like say 'American Pie'. (Don't get me wrong, I love 'AP' too!)

Third I was not expecting RJ to be wielding that ""third leg"" of his, and for the whole school to have seen it! The pilot episode had me hooked for that, and I expect that he will start to be less of a geek because of it too, as the series continues and he starts using it more! :-P

Now on to my fourth point, and it's my only complaint. It's still censored which isn't a very big deal as I think the pilot episode is the only one with language that needed bleeping. Still it would have been nice uncensored.

Final I'm very grateful that they are making this available to the fans, and wish more companies would do burn-to-order too! (I'm still waiting for 'King of the Hill' Seasons 7-13, FOX!)
And for the first time in over a decade I have a reason to watch ""M""TV!",1303516800,9,1379,4.208333333333333
4230986,5,B003YL4K2Q,"this show just gets better and better. as with every season on Madmen ( in my opinion) it starts out a bit slow but then you get hooked and BAM, you can't stop watching. a must have for anyone who has the rest on dvd/blu ray",1302220800,,224,3.891304347826087
4230987,4,B003YL4K2Q,I loved the show and thought it was a nice add to my dvd collection amount other things. I'm not disappointed with the lack of subtitles like the other reviewers because I have no need for it. I would have given the dvd a 5 star rating but like for other people the dvd case was poor quantity. Two of the disc won't stay in place!!! Other wise the set is alright.,1300406400,,363,4.055555555555555
4230988,5,B003YL4K2Q,"I thought this season was delightful. The artwork looks professional. The discs don't look like their dvd-r. The only thing that looks unprofessional is the back cover it shows a picture of rj and then on the bottom has a synopsis and a list of episodes. One other thing i thought this set wouldn't have was special features. Overall,I thought this set was very well done artwork, menus, and show is great.",1293580800,,406,4.652777777777778

8409608,5,B003YL4K2Q,"I absolutely loved the series from MTV and was sad when it was cancelled only after the second season. So after seeing season 1 on sale, I had to buy it. Upon receiving the disc set, I was upset the disc was scratched and the inside plastic was cracked so one of the discs wouldn't stay in place. I contacted Amazon and they sent a replacement immediately. The new one arrived within three days, before I sent the damaged one back! I was pleasantly surprised at how fast the issue was taken care of and the whole return process was flawless.

The show itself is a raunchy comedy with dramatic undertones, as a well-endowed and nerdy teenage boy tries to make it through high school. When an incident occurs exposing his secret, he becomes desired, rejected, and the joke of his high school's population. This series is the male equivalent of MTV's Awkward, which stars an awkward teenager who becomes known to her peers after a misunderstood accident happens. Both series feature an awkward teen, inappropriate best friends, a terrible guidance counselor, and an event that skyrockets the awkward teen to popularity. Each series is really great regardless if Awkward came out after The Hard Times of RJ Berger.",1454544000,,1210,4.7894736842105265
