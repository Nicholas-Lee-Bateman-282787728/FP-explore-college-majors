2564325,3,B000FFZ8N4,"Well I expected much more from this DVD then I got but it was still worth watching. Did I learn anything? No, not really but it is good for any aspiring counter to watch. The DVD extra's don't work and it is quite short. Never the less it's exactly as my title suggests. A good quick crash course on card counting. Don't expect to watch this DVD and be on the M.I.T. team level of play but it will help you understand theory of the system they use.",1192579200,6,448,4.1022727272727275
2564326,4,B000FFZ8N4,"This is a very good source for those of you wanting to take their blackjack skills to the next level.  If you typically plop yourself down at a table and play only by feel, you can make your money last longer and even win some if you adhere to the basic rules that Andy tells you.  The fake casino scenes are a bit hokey but the simulated table play is realistic and gives you a good idea of what to expect.  That being said, viewing the DVD is one thing; listening, learning, and practice practice practice are absolutely necessary to improve your skills.  Good luck!",1189728000,7,568,4.380952380952381

2564328,5,B000FFZ8N4,"The Expert Insight videos are all of the highest quality and this one is no exception.  I just wish I could go back to when I had time (e.g college) and have this DVD with my buddies....

A must have for anyone who is serious about playing blackjack.",1159920000,5,250,4.1875
2564329,5,B000FFZ8N4,"I'm a huge Kevin Spacey fan, so when I saw that he was going to be making a movie out of the book BRINGING DOWN THE HOUSE, I was so interested that I decided to read it.  Well, after reading it and learning a little bit more about the MIT Team and Blackjack, itself, I decided to try to learn the method myself.  I'd never been to Vegas before, and bought this DVD just before going for the first time a few months back.  I only had time to watch it once, but I took the Basic Strategy Chart that is included with me to the table in the Casino.

Well, I didn't take any casinos down for millions of dollars, but I did win a few hundred on my FIRST TIME OUT!!  I couldn't believe how easy it was.

The DVD does a great job of teaching you in a very simple, easy to follow way exactly how to properly count the cards.  Andy also gives you tips on how to count without getting caught by the casinos, and how to put together a team of people if you really want to win the big money, though I don't know if I have the guts to try that.

Basically, if you play Blackjack at all, and want to learn an EASY way to improve your game, and even if you don't want to count the cards, but just want to learn and understand basic Blackjack strategy, you HAVE to get this DVD.  I promise that you'll make your money back in the first few hands of playing in Vegas.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!",1155859200,15,1372,4.011029411764706

Even if you have been at it for a month or two it is still a good one to watch. However, I watched it from Netflix so if you have Netflix DO NOT buy it. If you don't have Netflix I would suggest buying it. The DVD covers basic strategy, card counting, betting and camouflage as well as team play. It also has bonus poker videos that I liked.",1373241600,,483,4.094736842105263

2564338,3,B000FFZ8N4,"If you just starting to learn about the game of Blackjack this might be worth it for you. However, there are some good free websites and YouTube videos that you can acquire the same knowledge from. Look at it this way. If your going to take a class in algebra, trigonometry, statistics or even calculus do you need to get the latest edition of the text book. NO! (If you say homework is assigned from the text book your missing my point.) The subject has not changed in hundreds if not thousands of years. It can't and never will either. All you need is a textbook with a description of how to apply the formula and practice problems with answers.

Through computer simulation the best way to beat Blackjack has been statistically proven over and over again. Keep count of the cards, vary your bet according to the count and play basic strategy.",1324166400,2,845,4.522875816993464
