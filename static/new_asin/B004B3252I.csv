4312972,4,B004B3252I,"Primal was fast moving and very brutal.
I enjoyed it and found it to be quite entertaining.
The characters were sexy and the story somewhat original but full of plot holes. The gore was abundant and pretty well done.

Don't go in the water because in about an hour or so you turn into a snarling cannibal with teeth like the teeth in the original Fright Night..There was one male character that was the biggest wimp and I wanted to slap him and say be a man dude..

It's a race for time to see who will turn into one of these Primal beasts and will the others be able to contain them and stay alive.
The ending is great and made me laugh as well..Keep the captions on for that part.
When I give a 4 star rating that means I Liked it,as the Amazon ratings state,1=Hated it / 2=Don't like it / 3=it was OK / 4=I liked it / and 5=I loved it ....it's not like a 9 out of a 10..",1336435200,2,873,3.9828571428571427
4312973,1,B004B3252I,"For years I've tried not to buy into the horror movie cliche that all college students are idiots. But I can't NOT buy into it anymore. In fact, I've come to the conclusion that if portrayed as such so pervasively in film then it must be a cultural truth: college students are idiots.

You certainly won't see anything different in  ""Primal,"" a movie so unoriginal you'd be an idiot yourself to think there's anything new in a horor movie with a description that begins, ""When six college students go camping..."" What happens next is everything you've ever seen in every other horror movie where six college students go camping--the skanky blonde receives a brutal death, the obnoxious jerk annoys people and freaks out, the douchebag gets what he deserves, and the heroine shows enough brains to put up a fairly decent fight against MTV style monsters that roar and bite and make a bloody mess of things.

But what makes this cliched disaster of a movie truly horrible has got to be the editing. From the heavy metal opening montage, to the sped-up fight scenes, to the quick cuts and whip pans, this cookie-cutter horror flick was made with all the right ingredients by a bunch of chefs who REALLY don't know how to cook. Unoriginal, empty, redundant, and not even very frightening, ""Primal"" has some cheap thrills, but little else beyond the requisite sex, profanity, rock music, and macho heroines.

The only way I can conceive of anyone actually watching this movie is, A) they are die-hard horror fans and are truly desperate for a bloody movie to watch, or, B) like me they're too tired to get off the couch, fetch the remote and change the stupid channel.",1335744000,,1663,4.724137931034483
4312974,3,B004B3252I,"Primal (2010), a horror thriller set in the Australian wilderness, is kind of a mixed bag of good and bad, with some predictable elements, and also some surprises.  The threat is an interesting one, although the special effects do falter a bit in the execution of some of the scenes.  If seeing a group of squabbling young people, battling to the death against animalistic creatures sounds like fun, you may want to check out this film.  Spoilers follow.

Anthropology student Dace (Wil Traval), and his friends Anja (Zoe Tuckwell-Smith), Kris (Rebekah Foord), Mel (Krew Boylan), Chad (Lindsay Farris), and Warren (Damien Freeleagus), are in a SUV headed to find a rock wall with some ancient paintings.  They find a tunnel, which they somehow know is a short cut to their destination.  After reaching the site and setting up camp, Mel decides to take a dip in a pond, and soon becomes sick, eventually transforming into a vicious screeching animalistic creature, with sharp teeth and a taste for human flesh.

Insects have disabled their vehicle, stranding the group.  They wander through the woods carrying torches, trying to drive Mel to a trap.  Surprisingly this silly ploy works, but Mel manages to escape, killing Warren, and causing Dace to fall into the pond.  The water somehow is responsible for the strange transformation, and Dace also begins to show signs of turning.  The survivors decide to kill him, but Mel returns and helps Dace escape.  With two creatures to contend with, their chances for survival appear to be very slim.

Primal isn't too concerned with story construction, as a vicious threat is introduced, the campers turn on each other, and overdramatic mayhem ensues.  Besides the primal beasts, there is also a very weird monster dwelling inside the cave, which is apparently nourished by the raw meat that Mel throws nearby.  Why she does this isn't clear.  Later while attempting to escape, Anja is assaulted in the cave, in what is probably the most shocking scene in the film, along with a very gory termination of a pregnancy.

The story has numerous plot holes, and leaves much unexplained.  The group supposedly has no idea where they are going, yet when they find the cave, they know that it leads to where they want to go, and conveniently, there is a drivable route there.  The supposedly 12,000 year old paintings have held up remarkably well.  Insects show up and eat synthetic materials like car tires, but play no other role.  Torches are way overused as a way to keep the creatures at bay, and claustrophobia is a clichd device.  A brief nude scene is shot to show as little as possible.  If you are going to feature nudity this clumsily, just keep the clothes on.

Warped character development, results in some annoying characters, who are constantly changing their behavior, turning on each other in an instant.  Wil Traval is pretty good as the handsome headstrong Dace, who has a brief but stylishly amusing fight scene with Chad.  Zoe Tuckwell-Smith is the featured ""last girl"", but Krew Boylan may have the more challenging role, performing in monster makeup and splattered with blood.

The flesh absorbing monster in the cave isn't explained, but its presence serves to boost the level excitement, when the film is running out of energy.  The special effects are quite cheesy and unconvincing, when the creature engages in a sexual assault, and when Anja escapes through the tunnel, emerging in bright sunlight, when she entered in darkness.  It's ridiculous, but still enjoyable.  Anja has a thing for dropping rocks, and the film finishes splatastically.

Primal doesn't feature the picturesque Australian scenery much.  The believability factor is pretty low, and the characters aren't exactly endearing, but there's probably enough freakish animalistic mayhem, gore, and horny creature antics, to hold the interest of some fans of the terror in the woods genre.",1334880000,,3916,5.004636785162288
4312975,5,B004B3252I,"I really love this movie!  It's very scary!  I love good scary movies and this one is great! The previous reviewer thought is was a horrible movie and I can't relate to his review at all. The only thing that reviewer said that was true, is he/she said that they would have just left.  This is true, the characters don't try to leave, but come on, if they had left, there would be no movie!  (ha, ha)  And by staying, they made an entertaining, frightening scenario for the viewer to watch!  It's awesome! Suspenseful, surprising, and just plan scary!  Cool!",1332374400,,557,4.51
4312976,3,B004B3252I,"I'm saying up front that I liked this movie. For what it was I thought it worked well and fulfilled its mission.

Here's the scoop. A group of six (3 guys and 3 girls) head to a remote Australian mountain where one of the guys hopes to find some ancient cave paintings that will help him earn a degree. While at said mountain, one of the girls takes a dip in the local pond and turns into something non-human. Now the rest need to figure out how to cope with the situation.

For my dollar, fans of ""The Descent"" should like this movie as they are similar in key respects. Both take place in a remote wilderness and involve surviving flesh eating humanoid-ish creatures. Also, a cave plays an important part in both movies though here it doesn't occupy much of the running time.

I liked the set-up. The girl takes a dip. She's besieged by leeches, but are they the cause of problem or are the tiny little bugs that can eat plastic and rubber at the heart of things? Though the separate personalities emerge throughout the proceedings, aside from the claustrophobic gal, the group, early in the movie, is rather homogenous. They're in the car, on the way to their destination, and they're talking, laughing, getting down on one another. They're just a group of kids on a working holiday. I found this to be much like the opening scenes in ""The Descent."" When the first transformation takes place, the actress playing Mel, does a fine job. Her head and body movements rang true to me. Her boyfriend, however, did become more than annoying. He refused to see the situation for what it was. Yes. I love my wife. But, if she became one of these creatures, I'd turn her into a headline. I liked the way the story progressed and I found very few cheap scares. It was just an overall scarey, creepy movie.

The production values were good enough save that some of the CG effects in the climax were suspect. And what's with the gooey creature in the cave? The acting was good as was the directing. I didn't notice the music so it must have been good enough. Some might argue some of the story points and they'd probably be correct. This won't change your life but it does what it does fairly well. It's  a good time for fans of the genre. I'm going to check out the director and see what else he's done or is going to do. For what he had to work with here he did a commendable job.",1320624000,,2372,4.381818181818182
4312977,3,B004B3252I,"Six young people travel deep into the Australian bush, in search of ancient, aboriginal paintings. They arrive at their destination, set up their tents, and... What the hell?? Noooo! EEEK! Aaaaaggghh!! THE END. PRIMAL is a fast-moving, sometimes ridiculous thriller / mutant / monster movie. It has convinced me to never swim naked in a swamp at night! It has also shown me just how dangerous camping w/ friends can be, so none of that! Now, I've always wanted to visit Aussie-land, but no more! Killer rabbits?

4312978,4,B004B3252I,"Primal (Josh Reed, 2009)

Capitol Theatre's recent Twelve Hours of Terror moviefest [note: review written in October 2010] was mostly a return to some old favorites, but they did pop up with a few I'd never seen before. One, in fact, I'd never even heard of: Primal, a 2009 Australian eco-horror flick without any of the usual eco-horror trappings that ended up being the night's most pleasant surprise.

Plot: a PhD student, Dace (Wil Traval in his feature debut; he's done TV time in as a regular in All Saints and Rescue Special Ops), and five of his friends head off into the middle of the Australian outback to find some cave paintings that, we're told, no human has laid eyes on in one hundred twenty years. (That should have served as a warning, no?) Among the pals are Kris (Rebekah Foord, also in her feature debut and also from Rescue Special Ops), who seems to be Dace's assistant; Mel (Krew Boylan... yes, in her feature debut) and her boyfriend, the supremely jealous Chad (Lindsay Farris, and yes, you've heard that refrain before); Warren (All My Friends Are Leaving Brisbane's Damien Freeleagus), the class clown of the bunch; and Anja (Gone's Zoe Tuckwell-Smith) whose grandfather was the last person to see the paintings. All goes well until they get to the mountain where the paintings are and discover they have to traverse a narrow tunnel to get to the other side; Anja is severely claustrophobic, so much so that she blacks out and ends up having to drive the car around to the other side of the mountain. When she gets there, as they're setting up camp, one of the party is attacked by what turns out to be some sort of mutant rabbit, Mel goes swimming in the wild and emerges from the water covered with leeches (don't people ever learn?), all that sort of thing. Nothing big, but when it all adds up... in any case, Mel develops an odd fever that everyone blames on the leeches. And during all this, Kris, who took pictures of the paintings and has been studying them, comes to the conclusion that they aren't telling a story, they're acting as a warning...

I did not know until I pulled up Primal's IMDB page that four of these six actors had never done big-screen work before, and even after reporting it, I'm not entirely sure I believe it; they're all very strong actors, and their characters are written well enough (the screenplay was co-written by Reed and constant co-author Nigel Christensen, and while they've done shorts and TV, once again you know what I'm going to say) to give these actors a whole lot to work with. The infighting in the group is just as absorbing as the outer threat, and considering this is one of those movies where the outer threat doesn't show up until halfway into the movie, I can't stress how important a thing that is. In fact, I was pretty much at the point, by halfway through the flick, of wondering whether this was really going to be a monster movie at all. And then it goes way, way over the top almost instantly, and you're on a thrill ride of survival horror that really works. But Josh Reed is not done with you, folks. This movie takes over the top as a baseline for the next time it ramps up. But let's face it, if you're willing to suspend disbelief enough to handle the first bit, the second shouldn't be that much of a problem.

Now, you may be thinking through all this that what I'm not saying, or saying between the lines, is that the movie isn't all that original, and you'd be right, but to that I say, who cares? So many movies like this have been released that have been so flawed in some way or another that seeing someone take the basic formula and craft it into a top-notch example of the form is, in my eyes at least, enough of a raison d'etre for Primal to exist. But if you want more than that, think about what I said at the beginning. This is an eco-horror flick, and it's painfully obvious that this, like any other monster movie filmed in the Australian outback (and far too many in America), is going to be an eco-horror flick. But there is a complete, and very refreshing, absence of the normal eco-horror tropes. We hear nothing about awful humans despoiling the land. (There is one very, very brief scene towards the beginning that, if you were so inclined, you could interpret with that message, but it is wordless.) There are no awful multinationals crowding into the forest ready to cut down every tree in sight.  Our intrepid campers do not showily use a lot of electricity from generators. Blah blah blah. We are not, in short, given a reason to hate these people; they're just in the wrong place at the wrong time. You want original in a horror movie? As long as you don't look at anything produced before, say, Halloween, it doesn't get much more original than that. *** ",1300233600,8,4779,4.519075144508671

4312981,3,B004B3252I,"I just watched this on Syfy and you know its not such a bad movie. It wasn't the best but it was definitely one of the better movies nowadays that I have watched.

I thought the acting for this movie was good. The main girls crying was a bit annoying but you know she was trying to show emotion which I can slide by. But, the last guy to die was such a pussy through the whole movie, he just let his gf Mel (who had changed) and Dace (the tough guy who also changed) drag one of them like a freaking sacrifice or something. But yet than all of a sudden got balls when he found Dace behind his girl, he freaked out and went after Dace. Its not like they were getting it on! But I was like Really? You choose now to man up and fight? You deserve to have gotten your neck bit off and die doofus!

The effects were alright they were average.

The Plot summary from IMDB: A group of friends travel into the Australian wilds to view ancient cave paintings but soon find a horrible sickness gripping one of their own, which leaves them with nothing in their mind but a primal blood lust.

People have been saying there is a lot of gaps in this movie and for the most part I disagree. I feel like its more of a tighter and well kept story through the whole thing than a lot of other movies. Yes there is things in the movie that you don't know about which makes you go well what about this? or what really is this going on here? But I think it was done to leave a bit of an imagination and let you ponder it. Like a lot of people didn't like the movie The Ruins but I actually enjoyed cuz it was a straight forward film but it left some imagination to it like the why's and what now and how did this get started.  Just like this one does.
Like, you don't exactly know why the girl blackouts at first except for hearing that she was in the basement for a week. You don't know why the ground like sucked in the blood and than the water started bubbling or something. You don't know why or how this all got started. You don't know if that was a huge ass leech in the end or how this girl ended up with a huge belly that had a thing inside her. Those are a few examples but those are the stuff that makes you think and lets your imagination do the talking and I think a lot more things need to do that. And if you are the type of person that wants every single answer straight forward in a movie than this one will just piss you off. and if you like to think a bit and ponder the what if's in life and think what if there really is a unknown place we have in our world that has something like this than this be a movie for you to watch.

I can almost guarantee that this wouldnt' be one of your favorite movies and it be a movie that you were be like well that was a good movie but i don't think i would watch it again. But i don't think it was horrible. And if you did think it was, than you did but there really has been worse and this one isn't one. its an average in the middle one!",1407456000,,2974,3.940099833610649

Enter a motley crew of idiots and you can practically hear the dinner gong sing out..........FEEDING TIME!  Add one mutant bunny and let the games begin.
I must say, as campers go this lot shouldn't have been sent off without serious instructions in camping.  Although one or more may have had some college experience, as a whole, they were disorganized morons, not an astute one in the bunch.  They soon learned, the hard way, that getting bit from a mutant gets you nowhere while swimming in the local pond proves quite transforming.  The mutating phase though, proved to be very inconsistent (although at this point, if you're winning to accept that people can lose their teeth one minute and grow a new set of fangs out of whole cloth seconds later, then you're willing to believe anything).  I know this movie wasn't meant to be funny but it was impossible to take it any other way.  One scene alone was worth a guffaw: the manic search for a machete in the backseat of a car.  Machetes in general are not something you can easily overlook.  The plot was grievously underworked in any case.  Basically, this film was based on the game Hide and Seek.  If they were willing to run around in a forest at night then they should have been willing to run for their lives in the opposite direction.

4312990,3,B004B3252I,"For an Aussie production I'd never heard of before, it turned out better than I thought it would be. For a good while, I thought it was going to turn into another The Ruins. I was prepared to get really mad with a super bummer ending but I was quite happy with the way it turned out.

I saw other reviewers call it an eco-terror flick. Huh? I am completely stumped by that as I never got the slightest hint that it had anything to do with that. To me it was more of an ancient curse. After all, if it's been around for 12,000 years, how can it have anything to do with eco terrorism? I just don't get it. Maybe I missed something there.

I do agree with others that the plot holes were so huge as to make the movie ludicrous on so many levels. The one girl figuring out the paintings were a warning was pretty stupid because she never explains what kind of warning. Plus, the fact that they all just didn't pack up and get out of Dodge was a biggie. Then there was that last guy that was such a wimp, I wanted to reach into the screen and kill him myself. I couldn't wait for him to die and he was the last male cast member to bite it. He deserved the horrible death he got. Another thing were those bugs. How come they ate all the rubber off the tires on their car but not them while they slept in the open in camp? Duh!

The thing that redeemed the whole movie was the ending. If not for that, I would have been royally upset and this two hours I spent would have ended with one star. However, the gore, colorful metaphors galore, censored of course on SyFy, and the blatant stupidity of the characters was all part of the good time. Plus, the chicks were pretty hot.

8421377,5,B004B3252I,"Primal sees a college student, along with his girlfriend and four other friends, heading into the Australian rainforest, where previously undiscovered aborigine rock paintings have been discovered, hoping to write a thesis on them.  The close-knit group of friends is also looking forward to a genuinely fun weekend in the woods, away from the city and studying.

In the tradition of so many of the best horror movies, though, this is one discovery that shouldn't have been made: the very rock paintings that draws the group in was actually meant to warn people away from this area and what lives in the caverns and underground.  When one of the girls goes for an innocent midnight skinny dip, she's horrified upon emerging to discover leeches have attached themselves to her.  What nobody knows, though, is that the leeches of that particular dark pond have infected their victim with a very unnatural poison.  And the transformation of the first victim begins.

Primal has strong acting and characterization as well as high production values, and it makes one wonder why it hasn't been able to attract a higher profile for itself.  There's a well-told story, thrilling frights, some great special effects, and the feeling that despite how horrific and freaky some of the things you see are, there's bigger and badder still lurking in or under the forest and the mountains.  I for one would love to see a sequel, and even though this was released several years ago, maybe if enough people discover Primal, there's still time.
