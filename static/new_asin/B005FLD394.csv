4681654,3,B005FLD394,"The film opens with a family murder/suicide. It claims these happen every full moon in clusters in different communities. The reason is the apparent urban legend pirate radio station which eerily operates during that one night from sundown to sunrise, granting callers their wish in what is an apparent monkey's paw type of fashion.

Sweet Angelica (Catherine Munden) wants to go to a party with the kids from high school. Mom (Kate Enggren) has her grounded for missing curfew. Angelica's best friend and bad influence is Staci (Sarah Christine Smith) who post provocative photos on the web (mom says it's porn) and specializes in conversations with men behind bars. She claims, ""Having a job is sooo Mexican.""

The sad acting and dialouge can be seen in the mother-daughter conflict scene. Angelica is mesmerized by the Oracle radio transmission on FM 99.9 as she sits at home grounded. Riled by a staged photo sent by her ""friend"" Staci, Angelica calls the Oracle. Then low budget things start to happen which might make you say, ""I wish I had never seen this film.""

The real dark characters are the voices at The Open Door. They remained voices and never achieved the cult status that bad guys need to produce viable sequels. They missed a golden opportunity.

Occasional F-bomb, no sex or nudity. Killing, not much blood.",1327708800,3,1327,4.910714285714286

8470204,2,B005FLD394,"Man, some movies are just painful.  It's bad enough to have a clich story--in this case, 18-year-old Angelica (Catherine Munden, OBSESSED) has been grounded from attending the Party to end all parties, wherein she plans to ""hook up"" with a her crush, Scott (Ian Kitzmiller, THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO).  So her ""BFF"", Staci (Sarah Christine Smith, jeez, her first three movies credits, for AUSTIN POWERS, SCREAM 2 and SHE'S ALL THAT credit her as ""Dancer""  Then in ""Boy Meets World"" she played Sarah, then she appeared in AUSTIN POWERS 2 (Scene Break Dancer), ""Nikki"" (Dancer #12), NOT ANOTHER TEEN MOVIE (Cheerleader on Football Field), ORANGE COUNTY (Dancer), LIKE MIKE (Cheerleader #10) and THEY SHOOT DIVAS, DON'T THEY (Dancer).  She's probably just happy she got an actual name this time!), who is secretly envious of Angelica, talks another girl into kissing Scott while Staci takes pictures with someone else's phone and sends them to Angelica anonymously, prompting Angelica to call into a pirate radio show featuring ""the oracle"", who convinces Angelica she needs to take charge of her life.  Angelica makes a series of wishes, including her parents will stop interfering with her life, school jock Owen (Ryan Doom, ""Raising Hope"") and his buddies will leave her alone, Scott will fall in love with her, and whoever is tormenting her with cell phone pictures will pay for bothering her.  Angelica cuts her finger on a broken glass, spilling her blood, and the Oracle tells her they have a deal.  Later, Staci, Owen and his jock friends, including Timmy, who insists everyone call him Spike (yawn), show up, telling Angelica since she couldn't come to the party, they brought the party to her, but their actual intention was to scare her--Staci's idea--while an unseen force is out there, dispatching and possessing Owen and his friends one by one--but to add to that clich story with acting this weak, and you've got a sure recipe for LAME.

Doc Duhame's THE OPEN DOOR is an exercise in every horror clich you can think of.  The script is another grown man's attempt--and failure--to write convincing teenage characters, turning everyone into a stereotype and eliciting some of the worst acting I've ever seen.

The plot is ridiculous and uninteresting and there was a fifteen minute chunk at the beginning that could have been deleted and explained better with dialogue later on, which causes the movie to be a lot longer than it needs to be, and the action to take a WHOLE lot longer to get to.

Duhame's direction is also a horror clich and he's lifting techniques from better directors who made better movies--Carpenter, Raimi, Craven--but offering nothing of his own to suggest he possesses any true skill behind the camera.

The effects were pretty good, I'll give the movie that much.  The deaths weren't very imaginative, but the execution--no pun intended--was handled well in almost every case.  Unfortunately a handful of awesome effects doesn't elevate a crappy story with terrible acting.

I was hopeful when I read the premise for the movie on the Netflix website, ""When a high school beauty reveals her secret desires during a phone call to a mysterious radio host, her wishes start coming true in diabolical ways.""  Unfortunately what followed was unable to live up to the promise even of that, which, admittedly, wasn't much.

The production design seemed decent enough, it didn't look like the filmmakers were working with too small a budget.  I could easily imagine these resources being put to better use on a different movie.  This just wasn't the one.  The story was boring and predictable to a T, but holy jeez, the acting here just killed any hope this thing had.  This was a total was of 92 minutes.",1384300800,,3738,4.9298245614035086
8470205,1,B005FLD394,"the movie is a B movie so the acting is pretty bad but the lame plot and dialogue don't help.  pacing is also a problem since the first half of the film is about a group of teenagers talking about an urban legend radio station, being grounded and missing the party.  the urban legend about the pirate radio show is rather uninspired as is the blood bond and the ghosties that haunt the caller's house. the special effects are nonexistent and there is poor make up and no suspense or gore.  if you really want to watch a movie where people die due to an urban legend try watching the movie urban legend.",1374883200,,602,4.3097345132743365
8470206,4,B005FLD394,"THE OPEN DOOR begins w/ a bang. No, literally, as a family is shot to death by a gun-toting dad, who then shoots himself. The scene then shifts to a high school, where we are introduced to sweet, innocent Angelica, and a host of teenage reaper-fodder, all getting ready for a big party. We are told about a pirate radio show that only broadcasts during the full moon. Enter the mobile radio van, w/ its antenna aimed right at Angelica's town! Actually, I found the radio announcer to be quite interesting, and pretty creepy. Meanwhile, Angelica gets herself grounded, and can't go to the bash. Poor Angelica tunes into the dreaded station (999 FM!), and hears a strange, esoteric tirade / sermon about getting what she wants, just by taking it. So, she listens for hours to a soothing, Oprah-ish voice called THE ORACLE, eventually ""embracing the power of her mind"". Well, Angelica calls THE ORACLE, and makes a mega-wish over the phone that just about covers everything going on in her life! Unfortunately, for Angelica, this story is along the lines of THE MONKEY'S PAW, and she soon finds out that getting your wishes granted isn't always a good thing. I like this movie, as it is different from the typical teen horror of today. It sort of reminded me of WISHCRAFT, w/ a bit of the supernatural darkness of THE RING, and even some EVIL DEAD tossed in for flavor. I'm surprised that more people haven't heard of it...",1364601600,,1420,4.661354581673307
