8587489,5,B00CYI4KAW,"It's great having these episodes to easily accessible! And one thing that's neat or might just be a fluke is that in the final episodes of the season: Dungeon Dice Monsters, for parts two and three they have the symbols for the crests from the second time it was aired but the final episode, part four, the symbols are from the first time it was aired. It's nice to be able to see both because the original symbols are extremely hard to find online. Everything is from the second time round and not many people even realized they changes symbols.
Also, I'm looking forward so season three with Noah and Seto's past very much!",1387324800,,625,4.491228070175438
