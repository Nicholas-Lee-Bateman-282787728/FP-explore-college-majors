1238796,3,B00000JWXK,"Dubbed in English. Decent story and okay fight scenes.  Jet Li just arrived in Hong Kong from Mainland China four months ago.  Without much money he lived with a bunch of guys who share a room.  He desperately wants a job, but doesn't know how to find one.  One of his roommates jokingly suggested that Jet Li should go to a downtown hotel where the Japanese mafia is meeting to hire assassins.  Jet Li went and met a short guy who just paid $500,000 for a chance to be in a competition to be the first to assassin an ""assassin of assassins"" in order to win $100 million.  Jet Li used to be a soldier and is a great fighter, so he helps the short guy to do his bidding for a chance to get 10% of the short guy's reward.  However, as the story progress, the viewers learn the short guy has a daughter and he, himself, is not rich at all.  There is a story behind the story as to how the short guy is involved in the assassination of the Japanese mafia's headmaster/grandfather.

1238811,1,B00000JWXK,"It would have been better if left entirely in Chinese.  I would rather listen to something I couldn't understand at all than have such a horribly dubbed translation that made the actors seem like blithering idiots.  They had mobsters dubbed by moronic clowns who made them out to sound even more two-dimensional and absurd than a children's cartoon character.

On top of this, the racial stereotypes of both Chinese and Japanese came across as if they were written by someone with a deep-seated hatred of both of these East Asian peoples.  What kind of warped self-hatred could prompt someone to create this sort of a movie?  Or was it instead written, produced and directed by people who hate them, using pseudonyms?",1499904000,,717,4.892561983471074
1238812,5,B00000JWXK,"So entertaining!
The words were probably way better in English than the original Chinese.  Even the growls were dubbed which made it even funnier.
The Jeo Pesci/Lou Costello voice and attitude of Jet Li's partner stole the show.
Great choreography on the elevator flip flop scene, many Jackie Chan like MacGyver moves with whatever is at hand no matter how unsuited for combat (Imagine the process: Hmmm... what would be funnier?  Using a banana or a squirt bottle of ketchup?) The final combat scene was hilarious.
I loved it.  One of the most entertaining movies I have seen in a very long while.
Stop bashing the purity of his moves and his character development.
This is a bash em up ironic comedy where they tried really hard to use Western values and expectations to dub over a Chinese movie, and because of, not just in spite of, the incongruent mannerisms they managed to put out a very funny movie.

1238815,3,B00000JWXK,"Jet Li often played willfully emasculated tragically nerdy near-mute man who has an awful way with women. He's a highly trained fighter with a stunted emotional intelligence. It's an odd characterization that is on terrible display in this film that has more light romantic comedy scenes than actual smart fighting. Jet Li's characterization plays up a white Western European and American stereotype of Asian manhood that is never trotted out in the venerable martial art films of the Shaw Brothers. In fact, Jet Li is a seasoned, highly intelligent, strong man and I wish his more mainstream films showcased his enormous emotional as well as physical intelligence. There were times when I just wanted to hit the hit men in this oftentimes cartoonish film full of buffoons, clowns, and also-rans. But, it's a warm hearted diversion with a ridiculous plot straight out of a weird screwball comedy mishmash of Japanese gangster flicks, kung fu flicks, and light romantic comedy.",1499558400,,976,5.144654088050315

1238857,4,B00000JWXK,"I enjoyed this action comedy. Starring 3 of my favourite actors, Jet Li, Eric Tsang and Simon Yam. I think it has a good enough plot and some funny comedic scenes. I liked the fights and gunplay. I wouldn`t complain, if they made a good sequel to this.

Picture quality: 3/5

Another DNR job by Kam and Ronson. Not much film grain left after the over use of DNR. Some details and sharpness are left, but could have looked better with no use of DNR. Kam and Ronson must be afraid of film grain. Stupid and unnecessary over use of DNR. At least it looks better than my UK DVD.

Audio quality: 3.5/5

I was suprised Kam and Ronson didn`t use new foley effects like they normally do. Too bad, because it sounds hollow and dated. 1 consolation is that this is not the worst I've heard.

1238862,3,B00000JWXK,"While Contract Killer was somewhat entertaining, there were still some elements that kept this film from being as strong as many of Jet Li's standards.  For one, Li's character ""Fu"" never really clicked for me.  Fu is not a homeless character, but close to it, and suddenly finds himself with the opportunity to collect a $100 million reward for capturing a murderer known as ""The King of Killers"".  Now we know Jet Li has some of the best martial arts around, but when he unleashes in this film (which honestly felt like hardly ever) it just seems to come out of nowhere from the kind of character he plays.  His fighting does seem very limited, and well, it is.  There is only one noteworthy martial arts fight scene, and that would have to be the ending of the film.  Even that scene wasn't too rememberable compared to most Li films.  Still, the plot had some interest and Eric Tsang's character as Li's agent kept things rolling, along with a surprise on who the King of Killers turned out to be.

This is what I like to call a very Americanized release of a H.K. film.  In addition to the English dubbing (though it wasn't the worst I have seen) the soundtrack is rap heavy at times.  Amusingly, there was even a rap song written for the credits titled ""Contract Killer"". Go figure.  If you are into the whole adding hip-hop to Asian cinema, you should enjoy this as some of the beats and rap were decent.

The plot barely held together what was considered a long hour and half watch for me.  The fact was that there just wasn't enough action to glue it all together like most Jet Li films, or action films for that matter.  I was hoping maybe it was all being saved for the end, but even then the final fight scenes that lasted several minutes didn't do their justice.  I enjoyed the 2 main villains in this film, but had hoped for more of them in the fight scenes.  The 2nd villain - and English looking fellow - provided some originality to the fights, with a laser flasher attached to his rings and shoes.  When flashed in Jet Li's face, it blinded him momentarily, leaving him open to an attack.  But once he learned his way around it, the fight was pretty much over.

Contract Killer is an average Jet Li film.  It has good moments here and there, but in the end you may be left with the feeling of ""That was it?""  Afraid so.",1190851200,,2337,4.375870069605568

1238864,3,B00000JWXK,"comedy isn't that good . . .

1998 R-rated Hong Kong Martial Arts film (set in Hong Kong, with Japanese criminals; R-rated for violence and some language). Also known as ""Sat sau ji wong,"" ""Hitman,"" and ""King of Assassins.""

DVD Features: The DVD contains the movie and some special features.  The movie can be heard in English (Dolby Digital or Dolby Surround), or Spanish (apparently no Chinese option), and has a ""English for the deaf and hard of hearing"" subtitle option. The special features are: Director and cast filmographies, film trailer, ""Jet Li Bonus Trailers"" (""The One,"" ""Meltdown,"" and ""Legend of The Red Dragon""), and a photo gallery.

Credits: The movie stars Jet Li (Fu; ""Romeo Must Die,"" ""Once Upon a Time in China""), Gigi Leung (Kiki; ""A True Mob Story""), Simon Yam (Kwan; ""Casino""), and Eric Tsang (Ngok Lo; ""The Accidental Spy"").  The director is Tung Wai (also known as Wei Tung; ""Fox Hunter"").  Written by Chan Heng Ka, Vincent Kok, and Cheng Kam Fa.

Plot: Jet Li is a contract killer (or an ex-soldier willing to kill for money) after an assassin of a Yakuza boss.  The boss had set up a reward for the one who catches his killer.  A reward of One Hundred Million Dollars ($50 million for catching killer, $50 million for finding the ones who hired the killer).

Review: Like ""Romeo Must Die,"" this film uses rap music as its movie music.  Unlike that ""Romeo"" movie, I've never heard of this Jet Li film, and am confused by it.  Due to the lack of Chinese language options, and based on the type of movie music, the movie seems as if it was intended for USA release (or rerelease), but I've never heard of it (though the movie appears to be badly dubbed and I believe that at one point, Jet Li's voice changes (odd they wouldn't have Chinese language option)).

I think that the movie is supposed to be something of a comedy, and there are some funny moments, but the humor seems a little off (especially considering the enormous blood spillage). This movie is not at all like I expected.  I expected Li to be, and act, like an assassin.  Instead he is mostly a novice (a skilled one, due to be an ex-soldier), and seems at first to be incompetent (maybe ""slow"").  Despite these comments, the actions scenes are interesting, while the comedy scenes, for the most part, are not (and the evil guys have some neat tricks).

The acting was average, the plot was somewhat interesting, the action scenes were good, but the comedy and music were, mostly, off-putting.  Overall, I would give the movie 3.20 stars.",1118361600,,2531,4.63677130044843
1238865,2,B00000JWXK,"The original, Cantonese, title of this film is 'Sat sau ji wong'.
Also known as: 'King of Assassins' (1998), 'The Hitman'(1998) and 'Contract Killer'(2002).
This film is in many ways similiar to other HK action drama films however it does have a more unique premise: an aging Japanese corporate magnate and WW II veteran (he boasts of raping Chinese women) is assassinated by a mysterious hitman in black. This hitman, known as the King of Killers, is infamous for both his skill in killing as well as not accepting any payment for targeting people of rather suspect morality to kill.
The Japanese corporate director has established a special Revenge Fund which will pay $100,000,000 (USD) to whoever tracks down his killer.
Fu (Jet Li) is a mainlander in Hong Kong doing errands for a minor triad boss when he comes hears about the Revenge Fund and subsequently comes across Mr. Nor (Eric Tsang) a hustler who takes Fu for a skilled killer and decides to be his agent. He is really trying to cheat Fu out of most of the reward money.
The Japanese director's grandson Eiji (Keiji Sato) is out seeking revenge for his grandfather as well as greedy for the reward.
Kwan (Simon Yam) is the CID inspector who is also tracking down the mysterious King of Killers. Which itself has irony, but I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen the film ;-)
The plot develops as the principal characters above interact in a frantic race to find the King Of Killers.
This was Jet Li (Mandarin name is Li Lian Jie) last Hong Kong film (1998) before he moved on to greater paydays in Hollywood.
I prefer Jet Li's earlier films but this movie had a certain charm to it even though some plot elements were rather formulaic and charcter development was at times only 2 dimensional (Eiji in particular is portrayed rather over-the-top) while others are under developed (KiKi - Nor's daughter). I prefer Simon Yam's performances with Chow Yun Fat though he certainly did a good job in this film.
On a positive note the ending of this film has a nice twist to it. For those not accustomed to watching Hong Kong action/police films you may be a bit shocked by the level of violence. For example in a shoot out scene in a children's amusement park in the film there is a rather high body count as people are shot almost at random in a melee of gunfire. While it is a bit diturbing to see such levels of violence without proper context you must understand that there are different cultural moors at work in HK cinema. Many in the East would be similarly disturbed by the explicit sexual content of many Western films. So try not to let that sour you when watching this film.
Overall I recommend this movie, there is some well done sentimental moments buried inside the action. As a caveat I urge you to NOT buy the dubbed version. Instead, get the original version in Cantonese (with some Japanese) with English subtitles distributed by Tai Seng Video Marketing Inc. at [...]

1238866,3,B00000JWXK,"Columbia released Contract Killer in 2002, but this movie is actually a Westernized release of Jet Li's final Hong Kong film Hitman (1998); this explains some questions that anyone watching this film today may have.  It's obvious from the beginning that this is a Hong Kong film because the voices are all dubbed (not all that impressively in spots), making it strange to listen to the hard-driving, rap-heavy soundtrack of English-language songs.  As you may have guessed, this is not the original soundtrack.  The whole movie has a weird feel to it: Jet Li's character Fu is not really the hired killer type, and it's hard to interpret the character in a good-bad dichotomy; the movie also seems to morph back and forth between action and comedy, eventually combining the two into a hybrid that entertains but doesn't feel exactly right.
The film opens quite impressively, with the assassination of a rich Japanese business man; the killer is good, having basically outsmarted and defeated a whole building full of bodyguards.  Then we meet up with Fu (Li), a seemingly quite nice but cash-poor ex-soldier whom we find in the strange company of a gang of young assassins for hire.  There's never really an adequate explanation for how he got in this unexpected business.  Anyway, he's looked down upon because he has never really done a job.  When he gets wind of a $100 million reward for the capture and murder of the man soon to be known as The King of Assassins, he tries to infiltrate the proceedings.  There, he meets up with a con man named Norman (Eric Tsang), who for some unclear reason brings Fu to the meeting with him and tells him he will be his new agent.  Fu is an unlikely choice for such a big job, and his first test shows clearly that he does not really have the heart of a cold-blooded killer.  Still, he stays with Tsang and mixes it up with some major league assassins and criminals in an attempt to find the killer and claim the reward.  There isn't a whole lot of action until the final third of the film, and only one scene stands out in terms of its impressiveness and length.  The identity of the King of Killers did come as a surprise to me, although I'm sure it will be obvious to some.  The end of the film, I might add, only further exacerbates my problem with the movie's concept; Fu's occupation just doesn't jive with the character's personality.
This is apparently as much of a comedy as it is an action film, thanks largely to Eric Tsang's character Norman the agent.  You can't help but like the guy, especially given the fact that he doesn't seem cut out for the whole business of contract killing; he is pretty funny for the most part, but he does ham it up a bit much in several scenes.  I think Jet Li did a fine job of acting here, but the character of Fu is by no means one of his better roles; Fu is just too vague and self-contradictory in nature.  This is not really a martial arts film, I might add.  There are several hand-to-hand contests, a couple of them involving a bad guy equipped with blinding light beams on his fingers and boots, but this is more of an action flick that just so happens to feature a few kung fu type encounters.
Contract Killer does offer a good view of Jet Li in the time period immediately preceding his jump to American movie stardom, and the contrast between this particular Hong Kong film and his American films is rather striking.  You can't get the full Hong Kong experience, however, because of the dubbing and the new soundtrack used in place of the original.  Contract Killer is probably best suited for Jet Li fans because the movie itself just doesn't seem to click on all cylinders.",1065916800,,3672,4.536363636363636
1238867,5,B00000JWXK,"Of all the movies I have seen Jet Li in this one is my favourite. Dont get me wrong I have enjoyed Jets movies a lot, but I put this the top of my list. Hired as an assassin (which you know full well he would not hurt a fly let alone kill) Eric Tsang takes him under his wing only things don't go as planned. However, there are long action scenes where Jet gets to show us some excellent fighting, comedy scenes, and an good story to go with all of this. I must add that I did not think I would enjoy it much, but I proved myself wrong, and I am glad that I did.",1058313600,,562,3.7711864406779663
1238868,4,B00000JWXK,"God's hitman. That is how people describe a killer who has been eliminating rich bad guys for little or no fee. It seems one particular bad guy covered himself pretty well, establishing a super fund that pays off to anyone who finds his would-be killer, a smart form of insurance. Fu (Jet Li) and the ""Crocodile Man"" (Eric Tsang) join in the hunt, and the story goes from there.
Surprisingly enough, this is a very complete movie in terms of emotions; it's not all shoot, kill and kick. Crocodile Man Tsang steals the movie, pulling off a convincing con man who manages to convice Fu that he needs an agent. His acting verges on overkill, but his portrayal of a betrayed, repentant father, a hardened ex-killer, a fearful target and a saddened friend all invite the viewer to share in his emotions. Actress/Singer (aren't they all?) Gigi Leung provides a pretty face for the movie, and actually adds a dimension to the personalities of Li and Tsang's characters.
Jet Li's acrobatics are showcased not only for fighting; the opening sequence shows him weaving in and out of traffic and pedestrians to retrieve some change that had dropped through a hole in his pants. He is also asked to beat up some restaurant patrons to prove to Tsang that he is worthy of the job. His skills are also showcased in escape scenes, more protective roles, and even ice skating--not your usual Jet Li fare. His portrayal of a broke, extremely selective ""killer"" is both hilarious and frightening when it needs to be.
The fight scenes are on the same level as Bodyguard From Beijing or The Master, not quite Fist of Legend or Twin Warriors (Tai Chi Master) good, considering that the last two were kung fu heavy. It's a much more rounded film, where the light-hearted moments contrast nicely with the darker fight scenes.
Watch this in Chinese to get the full range of Tsang's vocal gyrations and swearing. Highly recommended for any kung fu collection.",1054771200,,1933,4.738872403560831
1238869,2,B00000JWXK,"It's been a long time since I've watched a good chop-sokky flick, so last night I rented Jet Li's Contract Killer.  Apparently, it was his last Hong Kong movie.  Until now, I thought Jet Li's Hong Kong films are vastly superior to his North American ones.
My opinion has been altered a bit.
In general, his Hong Kong flicks are better.  Contract Killer, however, is a big load of bad.  I will give the benefit of the doubt, though.  I watched a dubbed version (why are dubbed movies always so incredibly awful?), so perhaps part of the problem was the translation.  There were many places in the film where character reactions and plot points really made no sense at all.  This could have been because of horrific dubbing and translation.  I'm sure it's much more watchable in Cantonese.
Nonetheless, even barring the translation barrier, this film had several strikes against it.  First of all, what was with the camera work?  One of the cameras had a badly-scuffed lens, and black scratch marks distracted me from quite a few scenes.  Also, the big fight in the elevator shaft was so dark that I really didn't have a clue what was going on.  I had no idea who was hitting who, or how.
Next, the story (as in most martial arts flicks) was pretty silly.  This one seemed to be an Asian knock-off of The Boondock Saints, right down to the name of the mysterious vigilante (The King of Killers) and his over-the-top appearance during a hit (like in The Boondock Saints, he appeared from the ceiling hanging by his feet from a rope with guns blazing).
Fu's (Jet Li's character) motivations seemed blatantly artificial, as well.  He's a poor ex-soldier from China who has promised to buy his mother a big mansion.  He decides to come to Hong Kong to become a hitman, yet his people-loving ways mean he doesn't want to hurt anyone.
As a minor point, yet one which did distract me many times throughout the film, Jet Li has an AWFUL case of acne.  In most movies, the makeup people will do a half-way decent job of covering up blemishes, but it looks like no one bothered even trying for this movie.  Jet Li has an amazing crop of blackheads and whiteheads.  His face looks like a horrible pizza.  Poor guy.  And poor me, when I keep thinking, ""Pop it, already!"" during closeups of the pus-filled bumps on his neck and cheeks.  Eeeurgh.
On the plus side, the fight scenes that were visible (like the climactic end scene) are solid.  I was pleased to see a dearth of wire tricks.  I really prefer movies with unadulterated martial arts.  It really showcases the actors' abilities.",1051056000,,2573,4.592105263157895
1238870,5,B00000JWXK,"I was amazed, absolutely amazed by this movie.
  Jet Li stars in his ever-lasting hero as a contract killer. But he never got a single job done yet. Why? 'cause he only kills those who really deserves it. One day a multi-million assignment came upon him---a Japanese businessman was murdered, his family posted big reward for anyone who could get the killer and finish the killer off. At the end, Li wins and gets the money after a brutal battle.
  This movie was quite amazing, I watched it over fivety times and still enjoy it, don't you think it's amazing now?!",1045008000,,564,4.554455445544554
1238871,5,B00000JWXK,"I love this movie, I really do. In my opion, I'd say this is one of Jet Li's best movies ever! If you haven't seen the movie before, buy it right now! You won't forget it, I'm telling ya! IT IS ABSOLUTELY THE BEST!!!",1044835200,,216,3.9318181818181817
1238872,5,B00000JWXK,"For non-wire fans, one of the better movies Jet Li has done.  So far, my favorite is Fist of Legend with this being a close second.  The action is not senseless or gratuitous, like someone might expect...there is not as much action in this movie as in others by Jet Li, but there is enough, and ALL of it is great.
The story is good too, but the voice acting for Jet Li's character is only passable (not too annoying, but not quite convincing...one of the things you have to put up with in all HK movies unless you want to read subtitles).",1042329600,,539,4.223300970873787
1238873,5,B00000JWXK,"Anyone else upset  at the release of dubbed HK films? I don't mind the subtitle option but don't release movies ONLY in english. That's why I'd rather spend a little more money and get the REAL ones from HK,",1036454400,,207,4.3076923076923075
1238874,4,B00000JWXK,"Fu played by Jet Li, an ex-soldier who gets hired by a low-rent triad member played by Eric Tsang,to chase a hundred million dollar hit: to kill the King of Assassins, who was responsible for the murder of a powerful Japanese crimelord. Thing is, everyone and their brother is after the reward, including the Japanese guy's son, who's damn intent on getting that 100 million for himself.
Fu seems to have the ability to get the job done, but he's too damn nice, which is a perfect fit for Jet Li the actor. This is actually the best character Jet Li has played in a while, eschewing his humorless acting for a gentler personality. This film effectively dodges the previously inescapable Jet Li bullet: no personality. Eric Tsang and Jet Li make a good team, with Tsang edging Li in the acting department. However, Li isn't too bad, and we hear his real voice for the first time.
Gigi Leung shows up as Tsang's daughter, a budding lawyer who takes a small shine to Fu. As always, she's incredibly cute but she doesn't do all that much. Simon Yam is on board as the cop intent on catching all the hitmen entering HK.
There are some good action sequences that are weighed down by a sometimes confusing and slow/boring plot. But, this film has a definite HK charm that it deserves credit for. This isn't your normal Jet Li crazy fight after fight after fight but it's worth your time, the chemistry between the actors are just GREAT",1034640000,,1428,4.538759689922481

1238876,1,B00000JWXK,"Contract Killer is the dubbed version of the film with the English title Hitman. Hitman is a good action comedy with excellent performances by Li, one of the few times he's not dubbed in the Cantonese soundtrack, and Eric Tsang with the two showing excellent chemistry.
When preparing Contract Killer for release, Columbia Tristar appears to have gone that extra mile to remove the funny, cutting scenes where Tsang expounds on how to be a killer diluting his rapidfire monologs.",1029542400,,479,5.0
1238877,5,B00000JWXK,"The dubbing in this version is excellent.  None of the voices seem out of place and they are expertly melded into the movie.  I kinda wish they had put the Chinese voice track and English subtitles on this CD, but the quality makes you forget about that.  Jet is awesome as usual.  It may not be jam-packed with fighting scenes, but you'll be satisfied by the end of this movie.  Also, Jet pays homage to Fist of Legend in part of his last fight where he uses his belt.  The movie keeps you guessing who the ""King of Killers"" is til the end.  All in all it's pure Jet Li joy and I recommend it to hardcore fans and newcomers alike.",1028419200,,631,4.1652892561983474
1238878,4,B00000JWXK,"At the end of the movie, Jet fought with a tall American and fierce Japanese. It is both exciting and enteraining. If you love Jet, You will love the movie.",1025395200,,156,4.233333333333333
1238879,3,B00000JWXK,"Not sure if someone decided Jet Li needed to try to be more like Jackie Chan, but that's what this film felt like. Wonderful chemistry between Jet and his sidekick....some truly funny moments. I expected a lot more action, but got a lot more laughs. Not a bad rental. ....",998784000,,272,4.46
1238880,4,B00000JWXK,"This movie is worth more for its comedy than its fighting.  Eric Tsang is a riot to watch with Jet Li...they have fantastic chemistry...esp. the scene where Jet Li decides to move in with him and Tsang pretends that he wants him to. lol.  As for the fighting elements:  Jet Li pulls a few moves throughout the movie, but nothing spectacular...then at the end, he tears it up!!  The movie has several hilariously memorable characters like the head of the trust board who insists ""Yes, I'm afraid of you, but I'm more afraid of starving""...I honestly felt that Simon Yam's character was a bit extraneous, he certainly doesn't have the skills that Jet Li has and he's very unimpressive without a gun in his hands.  The scene with Eric Tsang fighting the Japanese woman is too funny.  Esp. when he says ""I'll take on the toughest one - the girl in the kimono"".  The final fight scene is great enough to buy the movie and the very end has a nice feel-good sentiment.  No stupid romances to clog up the movie.",989366400,,1003,4.502762430939226
1238881,5,B00000JWXK,"This is truly a real Jet Li movie. Li acts as a merciful young killer from mainland China. However, he never kills a good person. This film actually is a reflection of Jet's personalities: simple and honest; seemingly ignorant yet full of wisdom. This film is suitable for people of all age. In a word, it teaches us that a great man must be a humble and honest person.
The martial arts in the film is great too. Although the fightings are a little slow, they are wonderful.",976665600,,474,4.3977272727272725
1238894,5,B00000JWXK,"This is the last HK film of Jet Li, at least for a while. Compared to Dr. Wai, Black Mask, My Father is a Hero, this movie should be extoled. The action will be dissapointing, Jet Li actually fights an american guy. Not the martial arts you wanted to see, so forget the action. The suspense and mystery will get you glued to the screen. The story is even better than Fong Sai Yuk. It is about a clan that will assassinate a killer who killed a Japanese ambassador. The story gets more and more twisted that Jet Li even thought that his agent is the killer. I won't spoil it for you but this is just a great story. Every film has its interstices, in this one, there wasn't a lot of action, there were hardly any action. They were overshadowed by the plot. You have to pick this up",974937600,,779,4.1655629139072845
1238895,4,B00000JWXK,"Neat action scenes, nice interplay between the characters and actors, and some excellent comedic touches add up to a movie well-worth getting.
Jet Li is one of the most charismatic Chinese action stars and he is put to  good use in this film as a would-be assassin with a kind heart. The  supporting cast is also excellent.
One weak spot in the film is the  plotting. While some of the film's plot twists are well done, others seem  arbitrary and out of left field. On the other hand, there was at least one  predictable twist that they stayed away from (Li's character was handled  differently than one might have expected from the first act).If you liked  'Romeo is Dying,' you will almost certainly enjoy this film as well.",956188800,,726,4.625
1238896,4,B00000JWXK,"I heard terrible things about this from Li fans, but it's really quite good: worlds' better than ""Black Mask,"" or ""Once Upon a Time in China and America."" It starts out slow, but the climactic fight  scene is superlative. Check it out!",949795200,,235,4.595238095238095
1238897,4,B00000JWXK,"Hitmen are apparently big business in this action hit about an anonymous worker (Li) who decides to become a hitman in order to be able to bring his family to live with him. The details get complicated as the designated  ""hit"" puts out a reward for the person who kills them that killed  him.  A HUGE sum of money put together by a conglomerate of people all  working for this guy, is posted out to all prospective hitmen. Jet is  coerced by a friendly con-man who wants a percentage of the reward and sees  Jet Li as his pot of gold.  Jet befriends (I say this loosely) a cop who  is also on the case, looking for the person who murdered the businessman.  They form a semi-alliance as they seek out the perp for their own reasons.  Put in an excellent performance by Paul Rapovski for his role as the  super-coolest bad guy with what I like to call ""light sabre  rings"" that blind his opponent and give him a clear advantage.  This  makes very clear that there will be a major showdown between our unlikely  hero (Li) and this delicious villain. The fight scenes are beyond amazing,  technically perfect and not too unbelievable as I have found over the years  with most of the HK action fight scenes.  One gets jaded after a couple too  many loops in the air.  The fight scenes in this film were very well  choreographed and had me cheering.  All in all, an excellent action movie  with a good story and a great sense of humour to boot.",916963200,,1438,4.363636363636363

The only thing I could complain about is the voice delay because its using other voices to replace Chinese/japenese (whatever lang.) and some graphics but judging the fact that the movie was released when it was I cant complain to much because that was quality in that time. This movie has just enough action to keep you watching and a great story to follow along. The dad of the daughter was a real funny smart elic con-man (also Jet Li - ""Fu"")'s agent.

7913620,2,B00000JWXK,I don't know why people are giving this movie four stars. If you stretch your rating it might make it to 2.5. The people who gave it a four must love Jet Li. The action scenes are ok except for the elevator sequence. It's slow paced and his side kick was a poor actor. It seemed really forced and unbelievable. I think the plot is a fairly good one.
