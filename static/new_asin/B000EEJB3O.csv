4107854,5,B000EEJB3O,"Synopsis:
A series of brutal murders takes place at a secluded mountain lodge. Could it be the local legend of a knife from hell be behind it?

Review: Satan's Blade will never be mentioned in the same breath as such classics as Friday the 13th or Halloween but for enthusiasts of the genre there is much to love.

Sporting a large body count, copious nudity, a catchy synth score, cheese galore, and a couple of twists that will keep the jaded slasher fan on their toes.

Audio/Video:
Making its debut on dvd and blu for the first time it is likely Satan's Blade will never look better. Remastered from the original negative shows a major upgrade from the fuzzy vhs.

The movie was originally shot in fullscreen and is presented here as such which may prove to be annoying to some. Furthermore, it appears that the vhs releases were slightly cropped, which hid the numerous boom shots now available.

Extras:
Typical of Slasher Video's releases, the disc comes packed with special features. For fans of the movie, hearing the director L. Scott Castillo Jr will be the highlight. He does tend to go on tangents a bit and some stuff is mentioned twice between the two of his interviews but I never lost interest.

He also mentions the prospect of a Satan's Blade 2! *fingers crossed*

One more thing of note the back of the package lists a faux trailer for Satan's Blade 2 which wasn't included but can be viewed here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o_DxoBf2tw",1433980800,4,1462,4.732283464566929
4107855,1,B000EEJB3O,"Dear god, this was excrutiating.

I've seen a lot of horror films.  I was there back in the 80s when home video first became a thing and all those obscure horror flicks I'd been reading about since I was a kid were finally within reach. Terror films I'd never even heard of were popping up everywhere. Truly it was a golden age for the trash film connoisseur.

When Satan's Blade recently became available on Bluray, I was intrigued. The box cover art looked vaguely familiar and the ""be kind rewind"" sticker that adorned the Bluray packaging promised a little slice of yesteryear. There are no promises, of course, with this sort of thing, but I figured it was worth gambling twenty or so dollars to experience an obscure slice of slasher cinema from the sub-genre's golden age.

I gambled... and I lost. And then the dealer punched me in the face... And stuffed a rabid badger down my pants.

Lots of cheap 80s horror movies require a little forgiveness. Sometimes the occasional lapse in logic or actor of questionable skill needs to be overlooked if the film has otherwise worthwhile qualities. Satan's Blade has squat. This is obviously a first (and only) time production for most of the cast and crew, and I respect the effort that must have gone into it, but nothing worth a damn ended up on screen. The bare bones slasher story plods along at a glacial pace, strung together by dialogue that does not move the story forward, but apparently exists solely because ""someone needs to say something here."" There's a fair amount of nudity, but the gore is so half-hearted one questions whether the filmmakers were really committed to the idea of making a horror film. There's a review over on IMDB that says ""the acting isn't that bad,"" to which I respond, yes, yes it is.

Make no mistake, Slasher Video's Bluray presentation is really crisp, making everything (including all those boom mic shots) far more visible than they ever were on VHS. The sound is quite good too. So good, in fact, that the flute player providing the background music at one point can be heard repeatedly inhaling.

I had hoped the experience could be recovered by some worthwhile extras. There are two video interviews featuring producer/director Scott Castillo Jr. Both are shot in a hotel room on consumer grade video. One is badly lit, the camera does not move, and there are no attempts to edit out the dead weight. The second video is marginally better, with better lighting and the camera moving around to follow Castillo as he displays various bits of memorabilia, but his head is out of frame through most of it. The things he has to say regarding film distribution and the making of Satan's Blade are quite interesting, but the shoddy videography is really distracting. There are clips from the Japanese and Dutch home video versions of the film, which consist solely of clips from the film with subtitles in their respective languages, so I honestly don't see the value. The fan trailer for Satan's Blade 2 promised on the box cover is nowhere to be found.

There have been so many excellent 80s horror Blurays from Scream Factory, Vinegar Syndrome, and others, that this one just felt like a kick in the teeth.",1432944000,8,3200,4.722222222222222
4107856,1,B000EEJB3O,"I was so regret... Because I bought this garbage Blu-ray movie! and I wasted 82 minutes... Story was unbelievably boring! Murder scenes were so fake and terrible! HD picture quality was great. But I saw so many scratches and I heard really annoying noises from the beginning to the end! Screen size was 1.35:1, so I saw so many unnecessary screen areas and I saw microphone over and over again... Cute girls showed their big breasts and very sexy. But movie was really terrible and boring, so I didn't care about nudity... Ending was big disappointed... Anyway don't watch this movie! One of the worst movies ever made in this entire world! Oh special features were really bad too! Director looked really hideous... Boo! Boo! :-(",1432598400,4,729,4.7936507936507935
4107857,1,B000EEJB3O,"Remember THE CREEPING TERROR (1964)? The producers lost the soundtrack to that film and released it with voice-over narration to compensate for the loss. If only SATAN'S BLADE were so lucky. This film should have been made without sound. The actor's (to be polite) body mikes are always coming into contact with their arms, chairs, kitchen counters, or anything that was near them. It sounds like they are being smacked with gusts of wind, even in the interior shots. The story contains a bank robbery, murders, a ski house complete with the ugliest women this side of the Ukraine, and a cursed knife that possesses whomever possesses it. Sound confusing? It is. Confusing sound? You bet. This is really amateur hour stuff. Get the Tylenol ready when you push the play button. Directed by L. Scott Castillo Jr. and starring Stephanie Steel and Thomas Cue. A Prism Entertainment VHS Release. Believe it or not, this is also available on DVD & Blu-Ray from boutique label Slasher Video. It looks great but you know what they say about putting makeup on a pig: It's still a pig. Rated R.",1432339200,6,1084,4.7712765957446805
4107858,1,B000EEJB3O,The worst movie I have ever seen. The acting was beyond terrible. The dialog and special effects were laughable. This movie could have been a Saturday Night Live parody about terrible slasher movies of the 1970's. Do not buy this. It is waste of time in all possible respects.,1431993600,5,276,4.653061224489796
4107859,4,B000EEJB3O,"This is truly a must see experience for this 80s slasher film. This has not looked any better. Gorgeous wrap around VHS cover artwork. A Blu-ray packed with special features. The video quality and audio is stunning considering this film is 30 years old and was filmed in the classic style of 35mm. It lovingly brings back old-school horror, MA and PA video stores and the 80s horror movie reality. This is being brought out by Martini Entertainment which is a division of one of my favorite DVD and Blu-ray companys, Olive Films. Olive Films has joined with Slasher / Video to release this unique forgotten horror. I was so excited when I learned that Satan Blade was getting a Blu-ray release through Olive Films. What makes this shine and is a must see, must own experience is that this is digitally mastered from the original 35mm film which director L. Scott Castillo JR supplied. This process allowed this forgotten 80s slasher Drive-In to be seen in a whole new light.

Now this 80s Drive-in slasher, was written, produced and directed by L. Scott Castillo Jr. This was his first film. Like the director, most of the cast had never acted in a feature film before and since. You can also see the director in the film towards the end as the fisher man, hiker in the woods.

I cant speak enough about how much work must have went into transferring this to High Definition. I have seen this movie on VHS and the quality was absolutely horrible. Looking at this Blu-ray and seeing what went into cleaning and bringing this forgotten Drive-In, Late Night style horror film, to a new generation, and new outlet, is absolutely stunning. This is one of the best fixer uppers I have ever seen from an old and clearly damaged negative. I have seen some really bad transfers of really bad recorded films onto DVD and Blu-ray, but this is not one of them. I was iffy at first when I heard this was going to be coming out on Blu-ray. I thought to myself, the film it was recorded on was not that good in the first place and I wondered, what they could do. Well Martini Entertainment/Olive Films clarified that answer and aced this film on a new outlet that utterly shines.

4107860,5,B000EEJB3O,"For the first time since the VHS era, this film comes to DVD & Blu-Ray for its 30th Anniversary. It has been remastered (2K) from the directors personal 35mm print and it looks fantastic. The colors are very bright and the picture quality is great. This release is the full 82 minute uncut version, other territories that previously released the film in the 80's cut nudity and some violence, bringing the running time to 76 minutes. There are some VHS tapes that say 87 minutes, but those are errors. This is the first in a series of releases from Slasher // Video who has partnered with Olive Films.",1427932800,25,601,4.574074074074074
4107861,4,B000EEJB3O,"A definite obscurity from the big slasher flood of the early 80s. This one employs a supernatural element which gives it a slightly more original twist than similar films in the genre. Watch out for a truly creepy dream sequence replete with a deformed killer and those nasty-sounding synths that we've all come to know and love in low-budget horrors of this sort. Misogynists are in luck as most of the victims are women (and lots of them nude!); a detail which ups the sleaze content considerably higher than usual. Overall, not a perfect film, but if you're nostalgic for 80's slashers it's definitely worth a look. Thank you for this little treat Satan... I love you!",1306454400,32,671,4.743589743589744

8394194,3,B000EEJB3O,"This seems like it was a forgotten 80s slasher as must seem to not have ever heard of it. Its an ok movie but far from great. I like that the killer has a supernatural element to it. Acting ranged from ok to kind of bad, the kills are ok also, there is some blood in here but not too much of it. The basic story is some friends vacation at a cabin & there is a killer on the loose. A legend is told by a character in the film that expands on this more, I don't want to ruin it for anyone. One funny thing I have to point out is at around the 60 min mark, if you pay attention to the upper left corner you will see the sound mic hanging there. Its only about 80 mins so its pretty short. If you've never seen it & are a fan of 80s slashers its not a bad watch & you can certainly do worse when it comes of horror films in general. Special features include commentary, trailer, gallery, 2 instrumental tracks & a look back at the film.",1444867200,,933,3.8645833333333335

8394197,1,B000EEJB3O,"I'm a horror junkie and (as others have stated) I seen my share of just plain BAD movies along with the good or, at least, tolerable. Why anyone would release this high-schoolish directing project mess (in Blu-ray no less) is beyond me. Especially when there are so many good titles waiting to be re-released. To say this film is a mess is an understatement. Painful to watch on so many levels, I don't know where to being.

The acting is straight-out of Acting 101. There are so many pauses between the dialogue, one could run a train through them! It appears as if the actors sometimes are trying to remember their lines as the scene progresses. You could go out and get a coke from the kitchen and come back and they are still on the same scene! Absolutely no pacing.

Sets and lighting look like they are filming at a friend's house. Barely any furniture and totally inappropriate costumes fill the camera's lenses. An example: a scene with two county deputies (or were they cops??) closing in on a front door, one cop wearing gym sneakers!! PLEASE-ee-ee!
The scene with two sets of guests arriving at a lodge near the beginning is hilarious, they are bumping into each other trying to fit in the frame. The old lady (mother) looks scared to death to recite her speech describing the urban legend.

Why this film has achieved a ""cult"" status is beyond me. Most ""D"" movies have some redeeming quality, this has NONE. The director should be ashamed this piece was ever released. As I said I have hundreds of horror movies in my collection, and this one is down in the cellar of the list.
It was impossible for me to get involved in the story which is a sign of a good film. The film print had ""ticks and pops"" looking like it came from a 16 mm print. I am aghast that some reviewers thought the print was beautiful.

The biggest disappointment is that I had to pay $20 bucks on this piece of . . .",1435449600,4,1899,4.417142857142857

8394199,5,B000EEJB3O,"I read reviews and felt almost like I'd made a mistake ordering this. Everyone was telling me it was dull as dirt and painfully slow. I put the new disc in my player and honestly, by the end of the runtime, I realized I'd thoroughly enjoyed the picture. It's not something I'd recommend to casual genre fans, it's not something I'd even recommend to huge horror fans. It's mostly poorly acted (despite a few of the leads being okay), and it is a bit slow and practically oozes cheese. But it's FUN. It's captivating in that its like a bunch of friends got together and made a movie. And I've got to say, the setting was BEAUTIFUL. I love the 'winter' slasher films so much. This film deeply benefitted from it and it gave it a creepy atmosphere. Despite the meh acting, it's not really a bad film. It's got a few fun characters, a nice little synth score and quite a nice atmosphere. And it really does turn some of the genre clichs on their head, so I respect it for that. BUT you must enjoy cheesy slashers, like Honeymoon Horror and Don't Go In the Woods!
Recommended to slasher completists and those who enjoy cheese.",1433980800,8,1121,4.420289855072464
