8726215,5,B000MYACRK,This documentary is an amazing story. It is all about the birth of a genre and how it grew in the United States/Chicago. While other documentaries may discuss its presence in other countries. This one focuses on the start in it's initial community. We all know where the House Music movement ended up. It's really nice to be able to see where it all began in detail. This is quit possibly the best Documentary EVER.,1372291200,2,415,4.546666666666667
8726216,2,B000MYACRK,"Although the documentary gives a fair account of Chicago house music, it somewhat fails to show the international impact of the music genre.  The best documentaries on house music are the 2001 documentary Pump Up the Volume and the 2006 documentary High Tech Soul.",1371513600,,264,5.0
8726217,5,B000MYACRK,This is indeed a collectable piece of House Music history with great footage! Some in the documentary have passed on since the release. I have a copy autographed by Chip E and the extended limited run international release. I wonder what price the autographed copy will fetch?,1364601600,,276,4.8936170212765955
8726218,5,B000MYACRK,"Not only is this a great film about House Music (something I love very much) but it's a great documentary film as well. All of the interviews are laid back, and very interesting. The background music is PERFECT. If I could say one bad thing about this film is that it's a little grainy at times, but the sound and stories make up for it.",1252281600,6,337,4.2
