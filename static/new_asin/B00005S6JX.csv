1658555,5,B00005S6JX,"I have just finished watching the final `episode' of the Daria series, ""Is It College Yet."" Daria was hands-down my favorite show on MTV. It was smart, crude, sarcastic and socially conscious at the same time. It had a quality to it that latter MTV animated attempts like ""Spy Groove"" and ""The Undergrads,"" (Remember them?) didn't. That's probably why Daria lasted for five whole years and still went out in its prime.  Anyway; that's pretty much wanted to say, but I'm forced to write a review of some kind, so here I go.
""Is It Fall Yet?"" Originally aired on August 27th  2000. I haven't been able to get the DVD yet, but I taped the show when it was aired commercial free. Jane's ex-boyfriend, Tom just started to date Daria, and junior year ended in a... um... bang, I guess. Jane was accepted to stay at an art colony over the summer and Quinn's PSAT scores were low, forcing her to get a tutor. The thing I love is that ""Is It Fall Yet?"" evaluates each and every character so well in the short time (75 Min.) that it has. It'll still keep you laughing every time you see it.
I recommend that all Daria fans should pick it up as son as you find a copy. I know I will when I see it.",1011830400,10,1186,4.243362831858407

This movie itself is really cool - you see the characters' transistion as they move up in life, and they do tackle real world issues. Grab your copy now!
I am really amazed and I give two thumbs up to the creators of Daria, and their whole cast and crew, for making such a wonderful series. And I do hope somehow, Daria comes back after college - wouldn't it be nice to see 'Daria: Is it 5pm Yet?'. Or maybe a real Daria movie w/ real people to act...hmmm... ;-)",1011571200,,466,4.131868131868132
1658557,4,B00005S6JX,"Daria was one of the best things to come from MTV.  I would buy the complete set of all seasons if I could on DVD.
This particular video, while interesting and a must for any true Daria fan, was a bit somber, but an interesting twist for the heroine of all misfits and nerds.
I'd like to see more DVDs.  I've been outta the U.S. for a year and a half and don't have cable at present. Apparently it's no longer in production?  So Sad! I must contact MTV.",1011484800,,453,4.067415730337078
1658558,5,B00005S6JX,"As a Daria fan living in England I rarely get to see the series in an uncut form (on TV they often censor it here, as stupid as that sounds) thankfully the videos released here are UNCUT. We have only JUST got to 'Dye, dye my darling' here and many of us are DYING to see it through to the end.
Releasing this gem of a series entirely on DVD will be a noble move on MTV's part and will make up for all the trash they usually peddle. To their credit they've released this DVD which I snapped up in a shot (I'm still waiting eagerly for the postman to deliver it to me here in London) and I hope when these sell like hotcakes they'll see the light and release all of it on DVD.

1658560,5,B00005S6JX,"A great movie of one of the best cartoons ever created. MTV's Daria was a hillarous spoof on modern high school culture. It has sadly ended though, with a 2nd movie ""Is It College Yet?"" coming soon. I don't have this item yet, but I taped it when they showed it on MTV. ""Is It Fall Yet"" is about the struggles of summer break, with Daria's signature sarcastic outlook. This is my all-time favorite TV show and I would love to see the entire series out on DVD. Without Daria, MTV is mostly just Real World re-runs and overplayed music videos.",1009152000,8,541,4.366336633663367

1658569,5,B00005S6JX,"Right there, the opening line on the back of this DVD, tells you ""Daria"" does not break from her snark just because she is not subjected to the daily annoyances and humiliation at Lawndale High. Nope. But that does not preclude her brand of cynicism from being shared elsewhere! This happens when her mother, Helen, deciding that Daria will not sit around all Summer, has ""volunteered"" Daria's dubious services at a summer camp for sensitive kids. Along for the ""fun"" is overly-emo English teacher Mr. O'Neill and sanity-hanging-by-a-thread history teacher, Mr. DeMartino. This leads to restless campers stuck indoors while Mr. O'Neill wants to do his usual self esteem schtick, last seen in detail in the first episode Esteemsters. Thankfully for them, ""Uncle Anthony"", as Mr. DeMartino is dubbed by the kids, takes matters into his own hands via a homage to ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" and liberates himself and the kids to have some fun. And all is great - except for Daria and an alienated boy named Link, who hates the world...much like Daria sometimes does. Daria tries - in her way - to reach out, without success. Or so she thinks. This leads her to question opening herself up to other people.

Of course, it may be just as well that Daria has that time at camp, as her relationship with best friend, Jane Lane, has hit a rather rough patch. This, naturally, is due to preceding events in the 4th season, when Jane's boyfriend, Tom Sloane, found himself attracted to Daria - and acted on it with a kiss. The matter got even murkier when Daria must have decided she liked it, since she, too, kissed Tom back. Of course, despite the point that the relationship between Jane and Tom had been in a downward spiral before this, Jane was understandably hurt and betrayed. So, while Daria was at camp, Jane made her own plans.

Jane ends up at a sort of avant garde art retreat/art colony, where she seems to go from the frying pan with Daria/Tom into the fire when she meets a fellow artist named Allison, voiced by punk rocker chick Bif Naked, leading Jane to question her sexual identity and realizing that some people are out for themselves. Of note, one of the instructors/artists is voiced by Dave Grohl of Foo Fighters fame.

Speaking of guest voices, Carson Daly also lends his vocal cords as David. David has the unenviable task of playing tutor to the girls of the Fashion Club, to raise their dismal PSAT scores, with disastrous results...until he gets to Quinn. Quinn ends up surprising even herself when she begins to take her studies seriously. Of course, Quinn being Quinn, she also develops a somewhat surprising crush on her tutor. Surprising because, unlike those that Quinn likes to tease, he is not conventionally ""cute"" by her criteria. Ironically, his reaction to Quinn's budding affection only helps her growth and shows that Quinn may be just a tad more like her sister than she thought, i.e. not totally without insight and depth - and by the end of the movie, leads to better understanding between Daria and Quinn, with their mother using Daria's own words of advice to her sister as a tool to give dating Tom a serious try, and not dismiss him due to Daria's prejudice about his family.

As if that weren't enough, we also see the very hapless Kevin and Brittany playing lifeguards at a local neighborhood pool with expectedly horrible results, Mack driving an ice cream truck to repay a loan from his father, Jodie swamped with ""volunteer"" work (her parents push her to do so) in a soup kitchen and helping various local officials, and Kevin and Brittany eventually ending up in Mack's place, delighting the kids. Watch the DVD to find out why.

Add in Trent taking matters into his own hands and helping Jane and Daria to reconcile while his band ""Mystik Spiral"" has a gig, and the movie has the requisite ""All's Well That Ends Well"" scenario, complete with Jane encouraging Daria to give Tom a chance, leading Tom and Daria to a close moment at the end with the decision to date.

Heck, even Helen and Jake have a little fun!

There is also bonus material, the two prior episodes before IIFY, ""Fire!"" and ""Dye! Dye! My Darling"", bringing viewers up to speed with pertinent events that dominate the film. Of note, however, the music in these episodes has sadly been altered, either with generic music or downright silence. But it is still worth watching.

Also, unlike the other DVD of ""Is It College Yet?"" which was inexplicably edited, ""Is It Fall Yet?"" is the broadcast version from August 2000.

If you love ""Daria"", buy this! Or...wait for the Complete Set due out on May 11th: Both movies will be included, as well.",1269129600,,4658,4.705521472392638

1658577,5,B00005S6JX,"I'm a huge fan of the Daria series, and the same goes for its two movies on DVD...Highly recommend it.

Each character as his or her own distinctive personality- from Daria, her best friend artsy Jane Lane, Jane's slacker musician brother Trent, Daria's over-achieving workaholic mother and scatterbrained father, her shallow sister Quinn, etc etc etc...
The animation is very good too in my opinion.

It is a spin-off of Beavis & Butt Head, and Daria was probably the perfect character to do that with. Other than that, Daria has nothing to do with B&BH, other than the background that the Morgendorfer family moved from Highland to Lawndale early in Daria's high school years. She retains the same dry wit and droll personality (as though everything going on around her is somehow surreal) as she had in B&BH - its just better developed here.

Both DVDs give a couple of bonus episodes from the MTV show. I wish they included more, or better yet, that the whole series could be marketed. Its ashame that hasn't happened yet...",1188950400,,1028,4.796610169491525

1658584,5,B00005S6JX,"I saw the preview of this cartoon on Netflix. Seeing the teen characters dancing and having fun on the beach (minus Daria, who sits by herself reading a newspaper - with interruptions), I knew I had to buy this. And I love it!

""Is It Fall Yet?"" deals with the main characters' experiences during Summer vacation. The highlight: ""The Tom Thing"" -as Trent Lane, Jane's musician brother, nicely puts it.  Daria and Tom have fallen in love, and are dating.  Tom and Jane have broken up.  This situation dents the friendship of Daria and Jane.

The two bonus episodes on the dvd (""Fire"" and ""Dye! Dye, My Darling!"")  show how ""The Tom Thing"" happened.  It's recommended to watch those two bonus episodes FIRST as they lead up to the emotional turmoil and love triangle of Daria, Jane and Tom that is carried over into the movie.

Adding to Daria's anguish, her mother enrolls her to be a camp counselor at the `OK-to-Cry Corral' summer camp.  Working with her are her teachers, dorky Mr. O'Neill and Anthony DeMartino (with his trademark bloodshot eyeball that widens when he's very irritated).

The other `Daria' characters have their own situations.  Lovelorn Jane goes to a bohemian artist retreat that's out of Lawndale.  Dim-witted lovers Kevin and Brittany provide comic relief as they both work as lifeguards at a local pool.  They only have eyes for each other... and I won't go further than that.  Watch the movie, and see for yourselves!  Daria's spoiled brat sister Quinn and her `Fashion Club' gal pals get tutored due to low scores on their PSAT exams.  (How I remember my high school days!  I was a Junior when I took my PSAT exam - and passed it!)  Lead `Fashion Club' member Sandi (with the deep voice) reminds me so much of Khan from Mike Judge's ""King of the Hill"" series.  Like Khan, Sandi is often sullen-expressioned, and complains a lot!

Mack and Jodie also have their share of the `summertime blues'.  Mack takes a job as an ice-cream vendor, in a truck, and has to put up with bratty kids who aggravate him as they buy ice cream.  His girlfriend Jodie has her share of difficulties as she volunteers at an office, and is up to her neck in work.  The pair doesn't have time to date.

I love the opening 'beach' number with the `Daria' cast frolicking on the beach... and with Daria not participating, of course. It is reminiscent of the ""Beach Blanket"" 1960's movies with Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello. Jane, too, is seen isolated on another part of the beach, painting. Her isolation gives proof of her rift with Daria.  The song ""Turn the Sun Down"", sung by the female band Splendora (who provide the theme song for `Daria'), is playfully catchy! Splendora sounds like the female version of the Beach Boys. The 'beach' segment concludes with the sun going down at the beach at dusk, with the frolickers still dancing...followed, in a dissolve, by the ""Daria"" logo in a similar 'dusk' color, with the film's title; and Splendora's melodic singing as the song concludes. This is a nice effect.

Another nice effect is in the dvd's Main Menu, with a scene taken from the opening of the `Daria' t.v. series.  A somber Daria is at the movies.  Her fellow moviegoers, surrounding her, are laughing at the scenes from the opening `Beach' segment. ""Turn the Sun Down"" is played in the background.

At the film's end, there are `Outtakes', which are cute and amusing involving the `Daria' cast.  There are a few gross outtakes also included.

""Is It Fall Yet?"" got me interested in the ""Daria"" t.v. series.  To admit, Daria looks much nicer in her own series than when she was on Beavis and Butt-Head"".  I purchased her ""Daria Diaries"" and ""Daria Databases"" books to help me get to know the Lawndale characters.  I'm presently reading her `Diaries'.  And I, too, hope that the complete ""Daria"" series gets released on dvd in the very near future.

But treat yourself to the interesting summer experiences -- as well as the summer fun -- at Lawndale with ""Is It Fall Yet?""  And savor Daria's sweet smile at the near-conclusion of the opening sequence in the two bonus episodes.  A little girl in the film asks camp counselor Daria ""Do you ever smile??""

The answer is Yes!  And this movie is sure to make you smile.  It's a gem in the ""Daria"" series!",1159142400,3,4269,4.661311914323963
1658585,5,B00005S6JX,"I love anything to do with Daria, so I'm a bit biased. For those who don't know this cartoon series. It is about an anti-social teen with a razor edge wit which means if your a person that needs clever jokes repeated to you this isn't for you. I just wish that they put the whole series on dvds instead of just the two 90 minute movies that they made from the series. If you have never herd of Daria before you will be lost if you buy either movie. This movie serves as a bridge between the second-to-last season and the last season of this series.

1658588,5,B00005S6JX,"Of course I would recommend this DVD - it contains some brilliant moments from a timeless series.  I never tire of watching it - but sadly, it will only leave you hungry for more.  When you're done watching, petition MTV for box sets of the full 5 seasons.",1123200000,6,256,4.3125
1658589,5,B00005S6JX,"It's a bit of a paradox to think the station that brought us such tripe as The Real World and Tough Enough could have produced such a sharp, witty and well written show.  The first movie ""Is It Fall Yet?"" is a magnificent turning point in the series as well as a stand-alone movie-length episode.
The movie centers on each of the characters' summer activities ranging from Quinn getting a tutor for the summer, Daria being forced into volunteering for a lame summer camp and Jane taking a two month stint at an artist's colony.
Even if you're not familiar with the characters, you'll be rolling at all the jokes and dry wit that Daria and Jane spout.  What makes the movie a step up from the series is that several of the characters start to grow, especially Quinn.  With a little help from her tutor she finds that she doesn't have to be as shallow or dumb as her fashion club friends.  Some of the minor characters don't end up doing that much (Mack, Brittany and Kevin, for example).  But I defy you to try not to laugh hysterically when Mr. DeMartino snaps, pulls the sink from out of the wall and throws it through the window after all of the campers are cooped up inside.
As a little bonus on the video, there's a music video for Mystik Spiral's ""Frickin Friends"".  I only wish I could have seen the DVD to see what other extras there might have been.
""Daria: Is It Fall Yet?"" is an excellent movie packed with great wit, humor and characters.  Do yourself a favor and give it a look.  You won't be disappointed.",1047600000,14,1518,4.396428571428571

This would be a nice place to start another Daria series regarding her college life.
I love this girl's spunk and complete lack of respect for her classmates.  While this is usually obtained after some problematic experiences as an adult, it is quite palatible.

1658592,5,B00005S6JX,"This is a wonderful DVD.

The movie is about Daria's summer. Her mother doesn't want her sitting around all summer vacation (again, ""like last time"") so she signs her up to work at a camp with Timothy the principal and Anthony the teacher with the strange eye. LOL

She is a councelor at the camp. Timothy never lets anyone go outside and makes them stay in to do crafts. Timothy is later disappoionted when they all like ""Uncle Anthony"" better than him.

Daria becomes close with a boy who hates summer like she does. He later thinks that Timothy told her to talk to him and gets mad at her. You'll have to see the movie to find out how that works out :)

Of course it contains everyone's fav characters like Brittany & Kevin, and of course the famous Fashion club with Quinn, Sandy, Stacey, & Tiffany.

Quinn is being tutored over the summer, and the rest of the club decides to too. That doesn't work out well though, LOL

Quinn ends up being the only one of them still being tutored, There is more controversy with this, but I don't wanna give too much more away :).

THE DVD also contains two bonus episodes that aired right before the movie was on TV. I recommend watching the two episodes IN ORDER before watching the movie. Just to refresh your memory.

And of course in THE MOVIE Jane Lane is still upset with Daria over the whole Tom thing (if you don't know what I'm talking about, you should DEFINATELY watch the episodes first! LOL

So far it has my pick as the 2nd best series(Animated and overall!!) of the 1990's..(Not to far behind ""The Simpsons"") Unlike alot of cartoons out there today (""South Park"" in particular!! Hasn't Kenny died enough yet?!?)The show and the characters developed and showed that everybody has there good sides and bad sides. Even the supposed ""Villans"" like Miss Li and Sandi showed possiblities of having a good side. Its an Absolute shame that the show has recently come to an end. But thankfully its going out on a high note!! We are going to miss you girl!!",1012953600,,1069,4.747311827956989
1658597,5,B00005S6JX,"""Is It Fall Yet?"" is more than just a Daria movie. It's a turning point for our young heroine. Daria has grown up from who she was in Season one, and Jane has been there every step of the way. But suddenly, she's made a choice--and Jane isn't standing beside her any more. What will Ms. Morgendorffer do?
A great peek at what the characters do during their free time and a statement about the bond between Daria and Jane. They'll stick together, come hell or high water...or Tom.",1012176000,,479,4.393258426966292

She enjoys watching it whenever she can, which I should add is hardly ever, but she was still so happy to get this as a Christmas present.",1490313600,,290,4.351851851851852
