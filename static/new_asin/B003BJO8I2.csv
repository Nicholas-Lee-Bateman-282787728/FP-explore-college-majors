VIDEO:

Lewis Black's ""Stark Raving Black"" was shot in HD and is presented on DVD via Widescreen Format enhanced for 16:9 TV's.  This film features a camera focused directly on Lewis Black, a camera behind him, one near the audience and we get closeups of the audience reaction to his jokes.  No dizzying cuts, editing was well done as well as lighting.  Black is not one of those comedians that does a lot of moving around the stage, so the shots are well-planned and you get a good balance of close-ups, full body shots and audience reactions.  Since the original source was in HD, picture quality is very good on DVD and I wouldn't be surprised if ""Stark Raving Black"" receives a Blu-ray release in the near future.

As for ""BASIC BLACK: The Lewis Black Story"", the documentary ranges from new footage to really older comedy video clips, so PQ definitely varies for the documentary.  But overall, the older scenes are watchable.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Lewis Black - Stark Raving Black"" is presented in DTS English 5.1 Surround, Dolby Digital English 5.1 Surround and English 2.0 Stereo.  This is pretty good as most comedy DVD's are presented in Dolby Digital Stereo.  Subtitles are in English SDH.

I was absolutely pleased with the audio and once again, because it was shot in HD, I wouldn't be surprised if the film does receive a Blu-ray release in the future and the audio gets a lossless track.  Surrounds are good in bringing out the crowd reactions, center and front channel does a good job in bringing the dialogue out and dialogue is clear and understandable.  Rarely do you see comedy performances with a DTS soundtrack, so I thought that was pretty cool to see this audio feature included.  And if you have a modern home theater receiver, one may want to try to have stereo on all channels for a more immersive soundscape.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Lewis Black - Stark Raving Black"" comes with the 70-minute documentary ""Basic Black: The Lewis Black Story"" featuring the life of Lewis Black.  Featuring never-before-seen footage from Black's earlier career, interviews with friends, fellow comedians, his touring crew and also his family, from his love for food (and accidentally mistaking sand dollars for cookies) and more!  The documentary definitely is a wonderful inclusion on this DVD!

EXTRAS:

""Lewis Black - Stark Raving Black"" comes with a slip cover.  Also, included is an insert which is folded up and is actually a poster for the ""Stark Raving Black"" film.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Lewis Black is one of those comedian's that stays in your memory.  Similar to how Sam Kinison is remembered for his ranting comedy, Lewis Black is more on the intellectual side as he takes on politics, religion and the absurdities of life but once he begins his monologue, we see his transformation to a man in rage.

For those familiar with Lewis Black's rants on the ""Back in Black"" segments from ""The Daily Show with John Stewart"" should know that Black has a lot to say about the nation's politics and his disgust for both parties.  For fans of Lewis Black's work, fans will be entertained by Black's comedic presentation.  There is no signs of laughs waning with his performance, nor are their boring spots throughout the whole performance.  Black makes sure that with each topic he is discussing, the rhythm is right and the rants are perfectly timed.  He knows when to use it and the audience responds.  This is a man now in his 60's and the year's haven't made him mellow, in fact, all the stupidity in the world ignites him even more.

When Lewis Black is asked by people that since President Bush has left office, what is he going to do?  Black is a logical performer and as if Bush's leaving the office is going to end stupidity in America?  Lewis is also not afraid to let people know what he thinks about both Republicans and Democrats.

Black also talks about taking part in the USO Christmas tour and how he was chosen as entertainment for the troops and to make things more crazy, he had to follow Vince Gill and his wife Amy Grant (both are Christians) and for the first time in his life, he felt a taste of Christianity and he had to get away.

Black just doesn't miss a beat as he talks about hitting 60, talking about the recession and economic times, having an iPhone and using AT&T's crappy mobile service and more.  And even though Black is known for being a ranting madman, his comedy does make sense, it's smart and hilarious and it makes him one of the unique comedians out there and his film ""Stark Raving Black"" definitely shows him at the top of his game.  No signs of slowing down and as long as their is stupidity in the world, Black will be there to call it like it is.

So, ""Stark Raving Black"" is an entertaining comedy DVD and what I found wonderful about this release is that his career is celebrated through the documentary ""BASIC BLACK: The Lewis Black Story"".  Everything one would want to know about Lewis Black is in this documentary.  Classic clips from Black's earlier years, discussions with friends and family about working with him when he first started and working with him today.  Fans of Lewis Black will want this DVD not only for his fine performance but also for the documentary.

Overall, ""Stark Raving Black"" is a wonderful Lewis Black comedy DVD.  If you are familiar with his style of comedy and have been enjoying his comedy for many years, this DVD is more than just a comedy film, it's a celebration of Lewis Black's comedy career!  Definitely recommended!",1276560000,16,6698,4.707149009474591
4106372,5,B003BJO8I2,"1 Disc Widescreen, being released June 15, 2010.

""Stark Raving Black"" was directed by Adam Dublin and is Lewis Black's stand-up comedy concert at the Fillmore Theatre in Detroit where he goes off on social issues and political commentary on current events. Black chose Detroit under the assumption that if anyone had a reason to be mad, it would be Detroit so they would like his angry humor.

Black vents on a series of topics from the perspective of a grumpy 60 year old man who is fed up with the system. At one point, he points out that anyone who declares themselves a Republican or Democrat these days with the minor differentiations in the parties and mistakes made on both sides is basically an idiot.

He goes into a very entertaining story about discovering that he had become a mainstream comedian by having to follow up country legend, Vince Gill and his wife, Amy Grant at an event and being unable to compete with their pure goodness and talent.

He talks about everyday issues like aging, parents, birth and death. He talks about political and social issues of greed, how everyone knew the country was going downhill, the economy, the issues with alternative energy, and the message of hope.

He has some great stories and presents them in a very funny perspective and even more impressively manages very smooth transitions from one topic to another very naturally. Black is a very angry person who manages to rant in an entertainingly funny way and is a great release to watch!

Bonus Features:

The Lewis Black Story is a documentary feature that runs a little over an hour and begins with a gag reel of him attempting to do his radio spot for the show in Detroit and transitions into the story of his tour and the people behind it. He introduces other people who work on the tour with him like his sound guy. He talks about his parents, especially his mother who has a ""black-belt in sarcasm."" This history of his career starting in theater at Yale and gradually moving into stand-up reveals a lot about how his particular style developed.",1276214400,34,2058,4.668508287292818

4106391,5,B003BJO8I2,"This is Lewis at a moment that I would not describe as professional comic.  Although he is that.  He really gets into his feelings and there are at times minutes that go by without a laugh.  But everyone is listening.  And then he will hit the audience with something that will make them laugh.  But it's more the message.  And Lewis appears to be feeling a lot of things here in Detroit.  He talks about his generation and its inability to deliver the goods.  Social Security is failing.  Solar power has not come to pass in the US like it has in places like Germany.  He talks about his parents who are clearly one of the most important things in his life.  This is more like a talk than a polished comedy session and for those who  love Lewis Black it is very satisfying.  In my humble opinion Lewis and Bill Burr are the two greatest comedians in America today.  They are both very angry and, at the same time, extremely skilled at making people laugh.  They allow us to feel that life is both tragedy and comedy at the same time.  That is an ability that is extremely uncommon.  And most precious.",1421020800,,1102,4.349753694581281

Recommended to the few ""snowflakes"" out there who want a further insight into the ""Black World"".

While most of the reviews seem positive, I've seen a few that weren't, and I ordered this yesterday, so we'll see. Generally I find him to be entertaining, not to mention spot on. He's an equal opportunist, calling BS when he sees it, regardless of political affiliation. And I feel it comes as high praise that George Carlin states Black as one of the funniest comedians in the last interview he gave before his death. Lew is angry, but for the right reasons.",1382832000,,561,4.456310679611651

4106458,5,B003BJO8I2,Well worth the price if you are a Lewis Black fan at all.  Beware numerous f-bombs as would be expected but otherwise not too offensive as stand-up goes.

4106459,5,B003BJO8I2,"Lewis Black takes everyday situations and points out the oddities that make the topics so funny. He uses strong language at times, so if this offends you then do not buy it.

4106464,5,B003BJO8I2,"This is the latest in a line of video performances by the curmudgeonly Lewis Black. No sacred cows here! Black manages to be critical of just about everyone. Sometimes, he is so overcome by his rants that he just stands on stage and shakes for a second or two, but it seems like minutes. If you like your humor on the rough side, I highly recommend this video!",1326326400,,360,4.3088235294117645
4106465,3,B003BJO8I2,"One of the funniest things was Lewis holding up his phone and talking about all it;s features.....Outrageously funny because since then I have heard that Walmart can count every toothbrush that gets sold in any Walmart in the world, but MF Global 'lost' 1.2 BILLION and Corzine and JP Morgan have no clue where it went.....

I think we need to put Lewis with his bi partisan bite in Washington somehow....These clowns that we have keep screwing it up ROYALLY,,,notice I said ROYALLY because they do not loose one penny, they expect the GRUNTS to bail them out after they have mugged, raped, and screwed them......Lewis is Mark Twain Reincarnated....",1324944000,3,649,4.9

I to Love the comedy of Lewis Black but the problem was... There wasn't any !
I find It very sad when a comic has run out of material but creates a video or cd
anyway.  What's the matter Lewis?  Are you broke or did you just want to trash
your reputation. Might I suggest instead of buying this piece of crap that you simply flush the money down the toilet.  If thats stand up  then Lewis needs to sit down",1296691200,3,478,4.0

But nevertheless Lewis Black for me is the greates living stand up and I hope he will release lots

4106475,5,B003BJO8I2,"Very typical of Lewis Black stand-up, but a little bit more on the depressing side of things. Seemed to be closer to just a speech about his life and his values as opposed to performing comedy.
