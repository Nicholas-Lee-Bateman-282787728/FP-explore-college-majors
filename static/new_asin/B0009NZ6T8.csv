It's a enjoyable fluff style flick I seen it years ago on showtime then again maybe 5 years ago on some other pay channel
It's still a fun silly 1980's style film wasn't sure about the name until i looked into it
It has two U.S. Names Lauderdale & Spring Fever USA (which is very odd)
I'm guessing it was distributed on dvd under Spring Fever USA

The biggest draw about this film is a young struggling actress Janine Lindemulder
who would go on to be a massive iconic adult model/ film actress
she looks amazing in this film she can also act better then early Pam Anderson and Anna Nicole Smith sexploitation films
It's a 80's style sleazy comedy aimed at males 12-50
If you love other genera films like Zapped, Hard Bodies 1+2, , Porky's 1-3, Losin' It, The Malibu Bikini Shop you'll love it

I thought by now there would be a Collector's edition dvd or even Blu Ray  it deserves it for being one of the last films of this kind
get Janine to do a audio commentary come on Shout Factory!",1449014400,,1114,4.215962441314554

Next, the plot is basically a `nerd tries to get laid' story but it gets ridiculously complicated the longer the movie goes on.
Lastly, there's not a lot of nudity but there's plenty of women in bikinis and lingerie, so if you were going to get it just for the eye candy, Spring Fever gives you your money's worth.
My favorite parts of the movie were the oil wrestling match, the bikini carwash, and watching a guy stop a threeway to answer the phone.
Spoiler alert! Animal is the Big Kahuna.",1357862400,2,549,4.392156862745098
