8136061,1,B000H2NHHO,"After waiting to see John Denver's first appearance on Bob Hope for so many years, I can not tell you the level of disappointment.  Wow, John is on screen for 2 minutes singing an awful parody with Hope.

Only for just Hope fans.",1205798400,,229,4.3023255813953485
8136062,3,B000H2NHHO,"...if you're old enough to understand the topical references.  Also, if you're purchasing this item to see John Denver or The Jackson 5, be advised that their appearances are very brief; Denver has one comedic number with Hope, and Michael and the boys don't get to sing at all!  Presumably songs aired in the original telecast were cut for this DVD release due to the complexities of copyright law.",1196812800,,399,4.768115942028985
8136063,5,B000H2NHHO,"As a Hope fan I bought the entire collection of his specials.  Hope provides a funny snapshot of American culture, stars, and politics from the 50's through the 90's.  This is fun, clean, nostalgic humor with a lot of great celebrities of the period.",1154995200,,250,4.659090909090909
