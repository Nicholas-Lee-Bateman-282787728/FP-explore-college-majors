8093637,5,B000BWFWF0,"Everyone should have this set.  One of the greatest series ever on TV has it all, comedy, drama and lots of action.",1389225600,,115,4.2272727272727275
8093638,5,B000BWFWF0,"I love this series! If you love it, you should buy these DVDs. I have every available DVD for this show!",1324944000,,104,4.0
8093639,5,B000BWFWF0,"Best show ever seen and it lasted for 11 years. There are not many things that can claim the same.  I especially love the finale, which tied up a fantastic series in a big bow while you laghed and cried at the same time.",1229558400,,220,4.0
8093640,1,B000BWFWF0,I decided to check Amazon for this set after having seen the set at Walmart a couple months back. What I'd like to know is why Walmart was selling these for $10.99 each and Amazon is almost 3x more??? I think I'll wait a little longer til the price drops some more or the studio releases the complete set as a package.,1143590400,10,318,4.145161290322581
8093641,5,B000BWFWF0,Love the 1-9 season.  Can't wait for all the others to come out.,1142121600,2,64,3.923076923076923
8093642,1,B000BWFWF0,"EDIT: Don't bother with this anymore, or even buying them individually!  The ""M*A*S*H: Martinis and Medicine Collection"" on Amazon includes the complete series of M*A*S*H on DVD for $139.99, a much better deal.

I love M*A*S*H, so my low rating is not for the show, but for the price they are trying to get away with here.  If you purchase this nine-season bundle you will pay $323.99 (the price Amazon is charging as I write this review).  However, if you purchase each of the nine seasons individually on Amazon instead (it just means a few more clicks and additions to your shopping cart) you will pay about $270 total.  So from one M*A*S*H fan to another, save your money for the next two seasons, which should both be coming out in 2006.

Also, according to a very reliable website, 20th Century Fox plans on releasing a M*A*S*H special collector's edition complete-series box set, but after they finish releasing the 11 seasons in their standard packaging (as in what this bundle is).  So if you want to avoid double dipping you might want to hold off for a while!",1141344000,41,1070,4.659574468085107
