6225266,5,B00HUTPK4U,"I thoroughly enjoyed this dvd, with Peter Greenberg hosting this tour of Israel with Prime Minister Netanyahu.  It was a wonderfully different concept and they showed many places in Israel that shows it's beauty and diversity.  The Prime Minister afforded access to things the average tourist may not see, but his narration of the sites really added a lot to the dvd.  I highly recommend this dvd.",1398556800,,397,4.895522388059701
6225267,5,B00HUTPK4U,"I originally saw this on Public T.V. Enjoyed it so much. i wanted to show it to some family members so I purchased it . I like the all out pass you get , that as an average person you would never get the opportunity to see. This dvd takes you to private places in the country . I also like the history of all the places you see. Its a great film. I would & will recommend this dvd.",1398038400,,381,3.775
6225268,5,B00HUTPK4U,"As a Jewish person and as a Christian, I have watched documentaries and films of Israeli culture, history, and nature since I was a child, but none of the documentaries I've seen even come close to this one.  It is AMAZING!  Prime Minister Netanyahu leads us on a stellar tour through Israel, and into the heart of an ancient land which is arguably the most fought-over piece of real estate on planet earth.  With inside access to places such as the underground Western Wall tunnels and Masada, Netanyahu and the camera crew capture brilliant footage of the beloved country of Israel.  It's the next best thing to being there yourself!",1397779200,122,635,4.745454545454545
6225269,4,B00HUTPK4U,"Israel: The Royal Tour is one of a series of personalized travelogues hosted by correspondent and editor extraordinaire Peter Greenberg.  This installment has Greenberg cozying up to Israeli prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in what amounts to a 1 hour travelogue/fraternity reunion between the two.  While it's certainly fun to see Mr. Netanyahu ""let his hair down"" and play soccer, ride bikes, and go rafting (with a multitude of security in tow), the consistent casual interplay and glib asides between the two gentlemen detracts from the historic settings they visit.

For the most part Israel: The Royal Tour is a competent, if superficial look at Israel and its rich heritage and multitude of religious and ethnic groups at odds with each other, yet somehow making it work and function as a fairly ""normal"" society.  The highlight of the program comes last, when correspondent Greenberg and the Prime Minister take in Masada, with its rich and emotional history retold in abbreviated form by the obviously emotional Netanyahu.

A fine introduction to the land and less so to its people and religions, negatively impacted in a minor key by some silly repartee between the two.  However, that's a minor complaint as I left knowing more about Israel and its Prime Minister than I did previously.  I came away very impressed by both.",1397520000,7,1335,5.068493150684931
6225270,5,B00HUTPK4U,"I was so anxious to receive the DVD, I was not disappointed! PM Netanyahu is a fantastic tour guide with a great sense of humor, very enjoyable. I would recommend this to anyone who loves to watch history uncovered. PM Netanyahu takes you to places that are not on any tour.

It is too bad that the film is focusing on my corrupt prime minister and not on what Israel has to offer for tourists, which is more than politics, religion and conflict.

6225315,1,B00HUTPK4U,I was disappointed because Israel should be one of the most interesting places on earth to learn about..  This was all about Benjamin Netanyahu and not really much about Israel.

6225316,5,B00HUTPK4U,When Bibi was at Masada it brought back my wonderful memories of my trip there. It was like being on another planet as you looked out on the expanse of land so foreign to my eyes.  This film will make you want to visit.,1516752000,4,219,3.977272727272727

6225320,4,B00HUTPK4U,"Very good documentary about Israel. I visited Israel a few years ago so it was very enlightening to see this place through the eyes of a former leader of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu. He was very animated and entertaining in promoting his country. Peter Greenberg was very good as his ""tourist"". They visited many important sights in Israel and background information was interjected for a historical perspective. A personal touch was shown as the viewer was able to meet Mr. Netanyahu's family and his home. We also got a glimpse of life through the different religions of Christianity, Jewish, and Islam and how the struggle for peace continues. I enjoyed watching this documentary and recommend taking the Royal Tour.",1516147200,,717,5.084745762711864

6225346,1,B00HUTPK4U,Israel is the single biggest wolf in sheeps clothing the world has seen in the last century.  This is total propaganda.

6225383,2,B00HUTPK4U,"The visuals are stunning but it seemed less like a travel documentary and more like political propaganda. The interviewer throws softball questions left and right and in the end the movie feels vacuous. Why does the film begin with a 10-minute homage to the ""triumphs"" of Benjamin Netanyahu? I thought I was watching a documentary about Israel, its culture and its sights, not about a corrupt politician, his corrupt wife and the sycophants who praise him at every step.

There's even a scene where the PM is kicking the weakest soccer balls at a goal, and the interviewer purposefully misses all but one. And a scene on the Jordan River where the PM is sung to by passers-by. And there's a scene where Sarah Netanyahu talks about how hard it is for her as the PM's wife. I guess she forgot to mention all the expensive jewelry that magically comes with the job.

A decent movie for the visuals. But it spent way too much time on the PM and had political overtones I would rather avoid.",1512864000,,986,4.564971751412429
6225384,5,B00HUTPK4U,"Everyone should see this because alot of people have no idea what it's like in Israel. Israel has something America has very little of, history.
The architecture, stone work, labor .. They also have high tech, fashion, nightlife and everyone should take an hour to see it. Very good documentary about one of the best countries in the world.",1512864000,2,340,4.779661016949152

6225394,2,B00HUTPK4U,"Would have liked it to be more about Israel and less about the personalities.  Dont really need a boost for the present Prime Minister, whether or not you like him.  Dont care if he hurt his leg playing soccer, and certainly don't need to see his wife tagging along.  And don't really care about the person of the narrator, and his easy parley with the PM.

6225466,2,B00HUTPK4U,"The trailer is an accurate sample of the video editing.  And, it sucks all the way through this.  Flash! Flash! Flash!  No time to digest what you're seeing until the last ten minutes or so discussing the events at Masada.

I was expecting more of a 'tour' and less of the 'royal' indicated in the title.  That said, it was nice to get to know Benjamin better without stumbling through the words of a remote broadcast journalist in the west.  What really pissed me off though about this presentation was how it was mercilessly hacked to pieces in editing.  Time was short; I get that.

6225766,3,B00HUTPK4U,"Most of the people giving one-star (and maybe higher, I didn't read any two- or three-star) reviews have ""missed it,"" I think.

If the video is all about Bibi, he might not be the one responsible for that being so--he is not the one who wrote and produced it. I did not view (no pun intended) the video as being about Netanyahu, however. Is he narcissistic? I don't know about that. I see him as being just a gregarious, truly friendly, Israeli politician who deeply believes in what Israel has done and become.

I certainly do believe that the video is much more of a political statement than the travelogue that the video description suggests that it is. The political statement is something like this: ""We (Jews) have had a tough go of it throughout history. We are a tiny nation surrounded by nations that haven't always been friendly with us. Even now,security for our nation is a pervasive concern. In spite of it all, we have prospered and we have treated other people in a magnanimous way and better than we have been treated.""",1444348800,2,1035,4.589189189189189

However, this travel tour was interesting, especially the historical accounts of people and structures over thousands of years.  The video was well done, but I'm not planning on a visit.",1444262400,,367,4.703125

His wife accompanies him (and the co-guide) on parts of the tour -- their relationship seems warm and loving, and you sense a deep and sincere love of country in both of them. Mr. Netanyahu's stories about his own family add perspective to Israel's history. The overall tone is fairly light-hearted and even jocular, but it works well for this tour. The tour shows a good cross-section of the Israeli population, though there is nothing in-depth about any. At an hour long, it's a short tour and the pace is too fast for my taste. I would have liked more information and a lingering camera many places, but it was well worth watching and added a new dimension to my understanding of Israel.",1430956800,3,887,4.620253164556962

6225947,5,B00HUTPK4U,I think the Prime Minister did a great job of showcasing his country and the people. He brings a modern viewpoint and shows where they are trying to go and what they have accomplished. He really brings the human aspect into focus but also touches on the ties to the past. Very well done. I found myself really liking him and his approachable manner plus you see things that aren't in the other videos I have. I also have the Visions of Israel DVD which is also very good. That one has more of the biblical sites but I found viewing both of them gave me a better sense of Israel and the people.,1430956800,2,593,4.2105263157894735

6226469,5,B00HUTPK4U,"I really enjoyed this.  I didn't read the contents so I didn't know the tour entitled ""Royal"" was because Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was hosting the reporting journalist.  The PM seems to be a very likable guy and his wife was too.  I really enjoyed listening to him.  I was surprised to hear him mention some of the things Jewish people do in a 3rd-person kind of reference; almost made me believe he himself didn't practice some of the Jewish traditions, but other than that, he gave us a tour and he seemed to know his history and his geography and geology.  I was impressed!!  I will watch it again actually.",1419984000,,619,4.531531531531532

6226473,2,B00HUTPK4U,I wasn't too fond of this one.  It seemed more like a political opportunity for Netanyahu to show the world how down to earth he was rather than a real 'inside' tour of Israel.  This one just didn't capture me at all and I was kind anticipating it being over.  I would not recommend this to anyone as there are significantly better documentaries on Israel available.,1419984000,,366,4.515151515151516

I loved the personal love that the Prime Minister showed for Israel.  I enjoyed the REALNESS of the interview, and It felt like anyone could have popped into the dialogue and felt at home.  I suggest this for anyone that would like to see some beautiful things in Israel through the eyes of a man that has literally had his destiny tied since his brother's death to this piece of property.",1419897600,,528,4.46875

6226539,5,B00HUTPK4U,"We watched this documentary the night before we left for Israel for the first time; and found it fascinating and relatively thorough for an hour tour, especially narrated by a person with the individual and family history and physical presence as Binyamin Netanyahu. He came across as very warm and friendly, and provided a good framework for seeing the highlights of the country. The production quality is excellent and beautiful to watch.

Gethsemane was the setting of Jesus' passion prayer, Judas' betrayal, and arrest, but the traditional location of the last supper is the Cenaculum, inside the city of Jerusalem.

Otherwise, this is a friendly tour of Israel where the viewer is introduced to Israel from the viewpoint of the Prime Minister. You learn some key moments of Israel's history, and also visit some unique places, like the Prime Minister's family home and grandparents' tomb.

Everyone who cares about the State of Israel, and even those who don't, should watch this to see how such a tiny country is able to survive and thrive in such a harsh region surrounded by so many enemies. You will  be amazed at the contributions the State of Israel has made to the world in the areas of medicine, making paraplegics walk, nano technology, giving sight to those who we're once blind. The scenery is breathtaking, from Eilat to Rosh HaNikra to the Jordan River; seeing where John the Baptist baptized Jesus of Nazareth and seeing Matzada where 960 Jewish men women and children made their last stand against thousands of Roman soldiers in 73 C.E. I lived on a Kibbutz near Rosh Ha Nikra and visited the caves and the grotto often and climbed Matzada, and was able to gaze upon 4 countries from Eilat. The cinemetography is so vivid, it's like I was there in Israel once again.  I highly recommend this video to people of all faiths and political persuasion.",1419292800,,1054,4.6310160427807485

Benji is a likeable guy; I wouldn't mind having a few beers with him and listening to his war stories. And he'd be a hoot to have along on a high country elk hunt or a fishing trip. But other than a pretty good segment on Masada, it's not all that useful or interesting as a 'tour' of Israel.",1418169600,,416,4.085365853658536

I also liked to watchh interact with his people!!  I hadn't realized his brother, Janni, was the only person to die in the Israeli raid  on Entebe to rescue the Israeli hostages from the evil Idi Amin.  I realized the Israeli struggle has gone on for thousands of years.  They have truly struggled to survive and they, the Usraeli have survived.",1417910400,,516,4.730337078651686

6226789,3,B00HUTPK4U,This is a beautifully photographed program with an informal presentation. The program visits a number of interesting locations in Israel some of which are not generally given much coverage. The program has the weakness of not going into much depth on any given topic. This results in an entertaining program that does not provide much in the way of thought provoking material. The viewer may find this somewhat unsatisfying given the unsettled environment in a part of the world that is critical to world peace. As a piece of light entertainment this is an engaging program.,1417824000,,574,4.989583333333333

Whether you are new to Israel or revisiting previous experiences, you will find something to awaken new desires to visit.

6226898,5,B00HUTPK4U,A very unbiased insight into current Israel with a definition of the 3 different religions position from the past too today.

6227000,5,B00HUTPK4U,"I have been always interested in the history of Israel as a nation probably from bible studies, but also because I am old enough to remember when their nation was created.  This fairly light hearted trip around Israel showed many of the fascinating areas and a bit of the history.  This is not an in-depth study, but rather a quick look at the country and a touch on the close proximity of their neighbors.",1416182400,,406,4.472972972972973
6227001,5,B00HUTPK4U,"We really enjoyed watching this PBS documentary about Israel hosted by the Prime MInister and Jeff Greenberg.  We enjoyed the tour of Israel. It better put in perspective the size of Israel, and the Changing Middle East it is a part of.  I particularly enjoyed learning the history of Masada, and the reasons the Dome of the Rock and the Wailing Wall are so important; much of it the site in many events or stories from Biblical History.  The labyrinthine tunnels under the Wailing Wall were a real surprise.  It will always help in envisioning Israel and their problems as they are today.",1416182400,,589,4.689320388349515

6227052,3,B00HUTPK4U,"Overall this movie does give a good perspective of the layout of modern Israel; its posture towards the future and its relationship to it's ancient past.
It is unique to be given a tour of a country with it's Prime Minister as a tour guide, however a decent portion feels like a campaign ad for Netanyahu and his policies, and like any good politician he doesn't let the opportunity pass without plugging his administrations successes.
The amount of time given to Netanyahu and his political history does take away from the purpose of the film and takes away from the credibility of the interviewer. They made a lame attempt at addressing the Palestinian conflict, for this film it would have likely been a better decision to say nothing at all than what little they discussed. ""Israel wants peace"" ... got it...
It was interesting to see the amount of geographic and ethnic diversity in such a small area of land, and it certainly presents a different picture of Israel than I had going into watching it. I went into this film wanting to get a good look at some of the more ancient sites, but was surprisingly entertained learning about some of the modern attractions Israel offers. I would have never thought of visiting Israel for its beaches before seeing this.

If the overall goal was for the watcher to gain an interest in visiting Israel, it succeeded. If you wanted an indepth history and ancient tour, it failed.",1415836800,,1422,4.710843373493976

Otherwise very interesting to see parts of Israel most people won't ever see.",1415491200,,265,4.638297872340425
6227085,5,B00HUTPK4U,"It's the best doucumentary I've seen about Israel. The best is to see the prime minister Netanyahu being so nice and so reachable to the people.

6227086,5,B00HUTPK4U,"This presentation illustrated (at least to me) how so much history, culture, conflict is happening is such a small geographical area.

They took you to as many of the most important and enjoyable places that they could in that short amount of time, and even having been there numerous times, I learned a few new things as well!  Further, having Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu guide the tour was an added treat. He is not the stuffy head of state one might expect. If you wish to get a true view of Israel, watch this.",1415145600,,592,4.285714285714286

6227135,4,B00HUTPK4U,Politically Correct but very interesting,1415145600,,40,7.2
6227136,1,B00HUTPK4U,One of the worst pieces of its kind ever. Concept: Israel through an Israeli politician's eyes. Hammy chumminess between the host and Israel's current leader Netanyahu is barf bag level over-the-top.. I learned almost nothing new about Israel. Could have been interesting had this juxtaposed Israel through a Palestinian politician's eyes. But that wouldn't have served the interest of this film which seemed to me to be more pro-Israel propaganda than travelogue.,1415145600,6,464,5.458333333333333
6227147,4,B00HUTPK4U,different from what I expected. since this is a private tour by the PM it panders a bit too much. would have thought it would include more spiritual focus and history.,1415145600,,167,4.419354838709677

6227150,5,B00HUTPK4U,"Offering much more than a typical travelogue, Benjamin Netanyahu guides the viewer with personal and historical insights. Often light-hearted (floating on the Dead Sea or playing soccer with students) the film covers the nuances of life for Israelis.

In light of recent derogatory comments by the current White House, those statements could not be further from the truth. This unbiased documentary by the BBC not only shows the beautiful geography of the country, but describes the history of it as well, including its current leader Bibi. This is a man that totally believes in peace through strength and a fierce defender of his country. It would do everyone good who is interested in the Levant middle east to view this.

6227281,2,B00HUTPK4U,"This state sponsered 'royal tour' is clearly an attempt for Israel to draw in more tourist dollars and netanyahu's attempt to have some smiley face time on camera for all the times his face is going to show up in the news the upcoming months for operation protective edge.  Netanyahu's son is seen in three scenes and in the one where they are going under the temple he is clearly tired of hearing his dad talk, he really looks so bored like all this historical mobo jobo means nothing to him.  Then in the next scene with him, he shows up at dinner around midnight ready to party and he is messed up on something, his pupils are mighty big *sniffff*.  Maybe all this footage will be used to sell the condos Israel is going to build in what was Gaza.  I would really like to visit Nazareth, Bethlehem, and Jerusalem since I am a Christian but I don't think it will be anytime soon with all the recent events.  Maybe I'll go one day when the middle east calm down, I gotta subscribe to that mid-east violence weather app.",1414281600,3,1020,4.347368421052631

The Prime Minister takes you on the tour and you get see a lot of Israel through his eyes and experiences as a citizen and not just as the Head of State. The reason it didn't get 5 Stars was because I feel it was rushed and possibly some locations were never visited or even mentioned.  Other than that you do get to see and hear some stuff that just seems fun and inviting. I want to go!,1414108800,,481,4.117021276595745

6227440,5,B00HUTPK4U,yet I see the prime minister is a regular kind of guy. I believe the Israeli people deserve to have the land they occupy. I also believe the Palestinian people do as well.

At first, I figured it would be confined to the lengthy biography and interview at the beginning, but no...about 2/3 of this is pushing Netanyahu and his policies with very little time spent on Israeli landmarks or history. And obviously, given the nature of the piece, don't expect anything close to a balanced view of what history there is.

6227635,3,B00HUTPK4U,"OKay, so this was a light propaganda piece, but it did give some unique perspectives about Netanyahu the man, his life, his ideas on Israel, and some of his background.  Netanyahu sees Israel as his land and his legacy, and for that he shows his pride in the accomplishments thereof.  And, there are some really interesting Israeli and Palestinian places sprinkled in, although it was hard to distinguish if you've not been there.  It was obvious that the director was careful not to show security walls separating the Israelis' from Palestinian Arabs; and that couldn't have been easy to do.

Modern Israel is such a rich land within an area of rich human history.  It's real estate coveted over millennia in a way that no other land has been sought.  Still, the documentary left wondering why $78 form my 2013 tax bill goes toward financial support, when Israel is so fabulously wealthy.  Tel Aviv is no Ramallah, and Cleveland is no Tel Aviv !!!",1412640000,,948,4.7439024390243905

Netanyahu is beloved as the leader of God's chosen, and this documentary sheds more light on him than any other I've seen.  This is a welcome feature indeed.  While the tour leads us through some beautiful and unfamiliar territory in Israel, there is so much more that is not explored onscreen.  Truly, I would have been glued to four straight hours of this content.  Not for a moment is this viewing dull, repetitive or uninformative.  If anything, it brings our hearts closer to Jesus' own people.  God promises a blessing to those who bless Israel.  Videos like this make it all the more desirable to do so.",1412294400,,714,4.5234375

I sure hope Masada will not fall again into the hateful hands of those who are antiSemitic, anti life.

I fell asleep through part of it so I watched the whole film again.  Humor was integrated very naturally.  My favorite part was when John Feist told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, ""Yeah, I'm going back to the hotel now"", as the Prime Minister and his wife go back home to rest so they would be refreshed for work the next day.  And when they left, John gave a fist-pump to the Netanyahu's oldest son and said ""Let's party!""

Israel is a place I have wanted to travel to.",1411430400,,130,4.24
6227911,5,B00HUTPK4U,"More folks should see programs on Israel such as this one, to realize that Israel is a great country despite its size, the size of New Jersey!!!!!! and most arab nations around it could learn a few things from this tiny piece of land.. not try to destroy it and throw its citizens to the sea... I hope I can live long enough to see peace in this region.",1411430400,,353,4.130434782608695

6227928,5,B00HUTPK4U,"I never heard of the PBS Royal Tour series. The general idea is that one is giving a personal tour of a country by one of the leaders of the nation. In 'Israel; the Royal Tour' we see Israel through the eyes of the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Along the way we see sights that are rarely included in other video tours, learn about Israel, and about Netanyahu's family.  This is not a travelogue. It is not meant to be a memento of a trip if you are a  recent visitor to Israel. There are better videos for that such as another PBS production titled 'Visions of Israel'. Instead we get to hang out with the current Prime Minister and his family as he takes a trip through this tiny country as if it were a little family vacation (accompanied with a lot of security and photographers). He visits places that are important to him; vacations in Eliat, takes us through the Kotel tunnel, parties in Tel Aviv, walks us through the old city, and drives through the Negev.

You will probably be enticed, like I am, to find other videos in this series. Highly recommended.",1411430400,,1069,4.4438775510204085

6227933,5,B00HUTPK4U,"I would give a 5 star rating for ""Israel--The Royal Tour"". Not only did it show famous historical and Biblical
sites, but it also lets the viewer become acquainted with Israel's leader, Benjamin Netanyahu. What a wise, gracious, articulate man he is! I was very impressed with him and the highly significant holy land of destiny--Israel. I also enjoyed the sense of humor of the interviewer-reporter.

Walk where Jesus walked, tour Israel and see what this great country is all about.  Wonderful, and Mr. Netanyahu is so humble and such a great host.

Peter Greenberg did an excellent job on this one. Kudos.,1410739200,,331,4.1875
6228135,5,B00HUTPK4U,"A viewer should be aware that the first 10 minutes or so of this documentary are a paean to the Israeli prime minister,  Benjamin Netanyahu, and much of the rest of the video appears to be a vehicle to put him in a positive light.  Having said that, I thought that the tour narrated by Peter Greenberg was captivating and that Netanyahu came across as a much better individual that I had previously thought.  The photography was excellent.  I have been to Israel three times and found this film thoroughly enjoyable.",1410739200,,516,4.637362637362638
6228136,2,B00HUTPK4U,"While most of the programs that PBS produces are wonderful, this one fell short.  The scenery was great, but there was not enough of it.  It would have been better, I think, to have shown and discussed more of Israel's historic and biblical landmarks and less of the social coming and goings of the host and the Prime Minister of Israel.

6228148,3,B00HUTPK4U,"It seemed like a little bit more of a propaganda film than a documentary, but at the same time it was done well and I believe showed some good history of Israel and a glimpse into the PM's thinking and personality.  If you want to get a better sense of Bebe's and Israel's history, watch The Raid on Entebbe (where his brother was killed leading the rescue operation).

Side Note - there seems to be a BIG LACK of understanding the historical context of the world situation.  If we don't understand what happened 2-4 generations ago (much less 500 - 2000 years ago), it is impossible to understand what is going on now.  I was talking to a group of just graduating Navy Seals and asked them about the attack on the Pueblo, and they did not know anything about it.",1410652800,,763,4.390070921985815

6228174,4,B00HUTPK4U,"Although clearly staged, this program illuminated many areas of Israel that I was unaware of. The short history lessons with the locale visits made the program more poignant and enjoyable.

It went off subject at times and became tedious as they spent too much time on certain aspects i.e. soccer game and penalty kicks. I wasn't interested in seeing the host learn about the game of soccer, and just wanted ""the facts ma'am."" That is my main criticism, but they are few.

The visuals, and especially the aerial shots are stupendous, and well worth watching. And there were many to enjoy, which I did. What was a bit funny was watching the Prime Ministers security team jammed into small places, but even funnier was them crammed on the small rafts. So tight, they couldn't even flex their muscles.

Aside from some tedious moments, this was a pretty good program to watch.",1410480000,,873,4.768211920529802

6228394,5,B00HUTPK4U,I loved this video.  I showed it at my Bible study and they loved it.  Nice to see a fun side of the things to do in Isreal and the Prime Minister was fun to watch in a more relaxed atmosphere.  It showed historical sites and also the new things to do in Isreal.  I also found out things about the Prime Minister that I didn't know before.  It was worth watching this movie.,1407542400,5,374,4.0
6228395,5,B00HUTPK4U,"I have never been to Israel or had any strong desire to go. With the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas, I became fixated. I listened to the news incessantly and tried to find out what I could through the welter of chatter about what was happening. The strength of the feeling I have for Israel's success did not come to me as a surprise. I wanted to do something a little more than follow the news and worry, and so I watched this short documentary film of about an hour, ""Israel: the Royal Tour"", here on Amazon.

The film features Peter Greenberg, an American Emmy-award winning reporter and producer and a respected travel news journalist.  Greenberg has travelled to Israel many times during his career. On this trip, however, he toured Israel with the Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.  The resultant film of Greenberg's ""royal tour"" with Netanyahu first aired on public television in March, 2014, before the beginning of the current conflict. Greenberg in fact had two tours with Netanyahu. Early in the first tour, Netanyahu injured his leg playing soccer and the tour had to be rescheduled for some months later.

As a tour guide, Netanyahu shows himself highly articulate, intelligent, and friendly, qualities befitting a politician. He speaks perfect English, as a result of spending most of his younger years in the United States. He puts Greenberg at ease and the pair soon behave as old friends. In a talk between the two men at the outset of the film, Netanyahu expresses his hope for peace in the region and his optimism that it can be achieved.

The brief tour covers a great many sites in Israel. (It does not include the West Bank). The film stresses Israel's stature as a holy land for the three Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam and it shows some of the places sacred to each.  Sites covered include the Jordan River, the Red Sea, and the Dead Sea together with the Negev. Netanyahu guides Greenberg through the Technion, Israel's technological center, through Tel Aviv and its nightlife, and through the ancient port of Caesaria.  The pair visit the Wailing Wall and the site of Masada, the scene of a major Jewish resistance and martyrdom subsequent to the destruction of the Second Temple. Netanyahu and his wife graciously host Greenberg at their home.

The photography and scenery in the film are lovely and on occasion take the viewer off the beaten path. The Prime Minister shows a mixture of humor and deep feeling for his country and his responsibilities.

I don't know if I will ever visit Israel. In this time of war and difficulty, I did want the brief contact with the land and its people the film provided. I am glad Israel is there and I want it to survive and thrive in peace. I was reminded of Israel's promise and gallantry in these times of trouble.

6228422,5,B00HUTPK4U,"This DVD has humor. Usually, every time we see Prime Minister Netanyahu, the discussion is serious.
We see the Prime Minister's family as well as the beautiful sites in Israel in this tour.
We visit the Prime Minister's grandparents' grave site, something which was formerly off limits due to
political geographic fighting. The final resting place is now open to Israeli's to visit and pay homage to their ancestors.
The Prime Minister can crack jokes, but become serious immediately when his political talents are needed.
At the end, we see how difficult filming for this tour was; since the Prime Minister was frequently drawn away
for governmental demands. His numerous aides are insistent, the movie director is as well. Greenberg shows his usual snappy quick wit. The Prime Minister keeps up with it. No one will sleep through this tour. One learns a lot from the two men. A good way to see Israel from your armchair.
Very informative DVD. We recommend it.",1403308800,39,961,4.901840490797546

She and my mother and I went on a tour of Israel in 1989 and saw many of the places Netanyahu and his tour guide went to on the video. The video is very well done, informative, colorful and fascinating. It is Bibi (Netanyahu), to a large extent, who makes it so. He is very laid back, and there is a neat camaraderie between him and the tour guide. Bibi knows his own country very well and so obviously loves it. One of the fascinating things to watch was Bibi playing soccer with a bunch of young fellows. He did very well! I will let you learn yourself about the little ""accident"" that occurred. If you have any interest in Israel--in its history, in its place biblically, from a past or anticipated future visit, or from just plain curiosity--see this video. For only around $22 it makes a wonderful gift, too.",1400198400,,895,4.3017751479289945

This to me was a wonderful and very informative tour of Israel. It was a positive video, without any political viewpoints, just basic information and Netanyahu's love of Israel.

I would be far more into the religious tour-what an AMAZING place. To know you were in the country that Jesus lived and taught. To stand on the Mount of Olives and read the Beatitudes, to see the tomb, to see the Dome of the Rock and the Mount of Olives. To see the dusty, rocky mountainous roads that Jesus and his disciples walked every day for 3 years. Getting back to the film, I was amazed at what a hip, thriving city Tel Aviv was. I would love to float in the Dead Sea. Israel has so many different aspects to it. To see where Herod built his house in the desert. There was so much interesting information and history in this film. You can see Bebe's pride in his Jewish culture. It was so solemn and beautiful seeing the Jews worship at the Western Wall. And to know it is God's chosen land and people.....how much more special can you get than that?",1524182400,3,1020,4.209183673469388
