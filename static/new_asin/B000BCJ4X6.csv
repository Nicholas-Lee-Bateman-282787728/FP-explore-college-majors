My wife, buddy & I are set up to visit Bonaine in 3/07 with our scuba group, Parrot Island. I've been researching it to make the most of the trip. I bought this DVD from Amazon to get a look at it. It had a long run time (a competitor was ridiculously short), and focused solely on diving Bonaire.

It named several dive sites, showed video diving each, and had a main menu where we could choose to jump to a given section. You have the option for the 2 Canadian divers to narrate as the video runs, sort of a pleasant chat-style (not a dry documentary) and onscreen names & designations showing you what some displayed sea creatures are. And that's the one thing that threw me off.

At least on my old DVD player, the narration & identification features had to be activated by going to the main menu, each was in a different section of it, and from the menus it wasn't clear whether I'd turned it 'on' or 'off' without watching some video. The opening part of the video doesn't include narration or I.D. even when they're enabled, so I instead went to specific dive location segments & could shortly tell.

I make an issue of that because the narration & identification features are worthwhile, and without them the DVD plays with a pleasant sound so you could easily buy the DVD, watch & enjoy it without ever realizing these extra features for your money.

I liked this DVD well enough to make this my first 'Amazon review,' since I benefit from these reviews when I'm shopping & no one else has reviewed this.

P.S.: I bought a DVD on Florida's springs & it had no narration. I saw an advertisement elsewhere for another Bonaine DVD by a different company and it was ridiculously brief. When you're shopping for dive DVD's, it's worth seeing if they have those features. DVD's can hold way too much for us to pay good money for a short video, or solely video.",1166659200,,1878,4.441860465116279
