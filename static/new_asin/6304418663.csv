7871723,1,6304418663,"Wow, really bad.  Storyline contains numerous flaws and holes which destroy maintaining any interest on that level.  There's a naked scene at the beginning which is about all you get, and the action scenes are pathetic.  Skip this one.",1148688000,,235,4.9743589743589745
7871724,1,6304418663,"Maria Richwine is cast as Rosanna, a prosecuting attorney who, after being raped early in the film, does not report the crime due to her distaste of adverse publicity and, after being appointed as a superior court judge and therefore committed to strict interpretation of laws, the criminal cases she must reject because of technicalities, when added to her recent victimization, cause her to assume various disguises while searching for career criminals who have preyed upon women and, after locating them, she kills them. This plot is, of course, outrageous and is not blessed with capable execution as the screenplay is a disorganized mess of cliche and confusion, the direction is agonizingly clumsy, the acting is, for the most part, shallow and production values, even after allowance is made for an obviously scant budget, are of a very low level, notably the sound track. Sound mixing, dubbing and editing during post-production are abysmal, with the scoring not only boringly derivative but obtrusive to the extent that dialogue is often drowned out; at other times the track completely disappears; conjunctive with the production's many other weaknesses, the product is a poorly made work that clearly attempts to justify violent, sadistic, and grisly sociopathic activity by its female juridical protagonist.",1104624000,2,1319,5.346153846153846
