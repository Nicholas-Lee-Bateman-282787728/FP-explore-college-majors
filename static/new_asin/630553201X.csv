1042522,5,630553201X,"Fine, sweet, understated, modest.  A small story, and a small movie.  If you require large explosions, or edge-of-your-seat car chases, this movie is to be avoided; on the other hand, if character vignettes please you, you'll be well satisfied.  O. Henry-ish, and intentionally stageplay-like.  Approaches my all-time top ten.  (Thanks, JAG, for introducing me to it.)",1038096000,28,368,5.5
1042523,5,630553201X,"What a great collectible item for someone who appreciates subtle, clever acting! No earthshaking tragedy here, just a delightful, poignant and wistful premise that is beautifully realized  and portrayed by two of Hollywood's most intriguing actors, Christpher Walken and Susan Sarandon, in the earlier part of their careers. I always watch anything with either of them in it, as I know I will always be rewarded.",1002240000,5,412,5.242424242424242
1042524,5,630553201X,"This movie is excellent not only for entertainment for instruction as well.  As a professional Drama Instructor, I use this as a complete training aid for my students.  Every class is moved by the performance as well as the subtle way you are carried through the dynamics of this peculiar town, hardware clerk and secretary's lives.
There is quite a bit to glean from this picture - most of which is relational in nature but also in underplay.  Christopher Walken powerfully embodies the essence of potential energy in a quiet package.
I recommend this to anyone for Drama instruction and disection.",1000339200,10,599,4.910891089108911

1042598,4,630553201X,"This is a charming movie that hasn't lost a bit of it's gloss as some movies from that period can.  Two fine actors, as already noticed rising stars, along with decent direction for, what I'm sure, was a low budget undertaking.  I wouldn't mind a sequel, come to think of it.  It's an interesting premise and one that, I think, could be explored and expanded going forward.  Only 4 stars instead of five because, hell...it's not Casablanca.",1486166400,2,440,4.675324675324675
1042599,5,630553201X,"Susan Sarandon and Christopher Walken show us they are already shining stars, back in 1982!  Unbelievably great performances from both of them.  I've watched this one-hour program at least five times over the years, and it gets better every time.  Based on a short story by Kurt Vonnegut, and directed by a young Jonathan Demme, the story is an argument for the importance of literature!  The story is about the fact that sometimes great lines of literature can speak for those who have difficulty verbalizing their feelings. It's both comic and deep.  No fancy production values, no car chases, just one simple hour of inspired acting by two greats of the cinema world.",1486166400,2,670,4.893805309734513
1042600,4,630553201X,Cute story.  Susan Sarenson and Christopher Walken are powerful actors.  It was fun seeing them so young-- talented from the get go. Anyone who has been involved in stage acting or stage production would appreciate this.  Literature buffs as well.,1485820800,2,247,5.125
1042601,4,630553201X,"It is well known to the North Crawford Mask and Wig Club that Harry Nash (Christopher Walken), the reclusive local grocery clerk, comes to life on stage, but then reverts to sheer social ineptitude at play's end. Helene Shaw (Susan Sarandon), new to town, on a brief training stint at the phone company, is also painfully constricted socially. But it gets pretty hot and steamy for the 2 in the town's production of ""Streetcar,"" when Harry fully inhabits the loud, sexual, animal spirit of Stanley, and Helene, as Stella, breaks out of her emotional and sensual confinement. The clever Helene births an ingenious plan to provide Harry with all the confidence he needs. Adapted from Kurt Vonnegut's short story, directed by Jonathan Demme, and with precious little runtime of 55 minutes, this is an artistic treat. The acting is first-rate.  Recommend.",1485561600,,851,5.035460992907802

1042624,3,630553201X,"This is a somewhat hokey little movie; the moment when Walken's and Sarandon's characters first meet, for example, is incredibly cheesy, and the ending is pretty corny, too. Walken and Sarandon act well, but several of the supporting cast members seem stiff and at times awkward. Still, the movie has a nifty premise, and to be honest I don't expect much from made-for-TV short films, so I'm satisfied giving this three stars.",1485302400,,426,4.930555555555555

1042675,5,630553201X,"Jonathan Demme(Silence of the Lambs) directs this adaptation of Kurt Vonnegut's excellent short story- one of his more upbeat pieces of writing. Susan Sarandon is the new woman in a small town with a community theater planning its next production. Christopher Walken is the painfully shy(to invisibility) home town boy who somehow always winds up in the theater's productions. Boy and girl meet and the mystery unfolds.
This is Walken after The Deer Hunter, but before he became identified with movie psychopaths and Sarandon after Rocky Horror Picture Show, but before Bull Durham. They work wonderfully together in a production that should make you curious about the rest of American Playhouse's eleven seasons.
It makes me wish Demme could direct a new version with a new cast to see what might emerge from this story.",1482796800,,821,5.088888888888889
1042676,5,630553201X,A fabulous little movie I've remembered since seeing it on TV in the early 80's. I think it was a Hallmark Hall of Fame movie or something like that originally. Well worth the view!,1480809600,,181,4.352941176470588

1042720,5,630553201X,"Just beautiful & touching with an amazing cast. It is totally realistic as anyone involved in theater could attest. I've got to say, as much as Christopher Walken likes his Quirky roles, this was his most endearing. He and Susan really fit their parts so well, with neither character having much in the way of stability in their lives to show them how, they both had to stumble upon finding out who they were. Two pieces that finished the puzzle. The woman had to use her intuition and be motivated to follow through., with a little coaching from the director. Totally beautiful. It's a wonderful surprise that this was available.",1476489600,4,630,4.736363636363636
1042721,4,630553201X,"An enjoyable little movie, with a one-tone premise: people like Harry Nash (Christopher Walken) can be social beings only through make-believe characters, but recede into painfully shy, clumsy selves in real life. Harry can relate to Helene (Susan Sarandon) only as Stanley to her Stella in the play A Streetcar Named Desire. In the movie, there is a successful resolution to this predicament, through an ingenious device Helene (Susan Sarandon) uses to draw out Harry. One would have wished there was more to the film than this. But the outer curtain falls, and we are left with a partial satisfaction. 3 1/2 stars",1475366400,,615,4.980582524271845
1042722,5,630553201X,This is a marvelous portrayal of Kurt Vonnegut's short story. Christopher Walken and Susan Sarandon are superb. The supporting actors are perfect.

1042726,3,630553201X,"This little film is aged, but for what it is, it was entertaining.  It was cheaply made and a little too short.  It was an interesting take on the way some actors get into their roles so deeply, they actually live the character off the set.",1471910400,,240,4.195652173913044

The program had just started and we were captivated.  In fact, as the credits began to roll at the end, we stood in our living room and applauded.  The same thing happened when we intentionally watched it a second time a few years later.  By today's standards ""Who Am I This Time"" is old television.  It's not HDTV quality, but the storyline and the performances of young Susan Sarandon and Christopher Walken make this a ""must watch"" television special.  Stream it or buy it.  Watch it.

She's a new girl in town and discovers the community theatre as a place to meet people, especially the shy guy who only connects with people when he is playing a role.  The girls in town dote on him, but get no response.  Susan hits on the idea of shoving a script in his hands - a romantic script - whenever she meets him and helping him make connections with other people -- especially her.

If you are a fan of Christopher Walken and/or Susan Sarandon than you will enjoy seeing these actors early on in their careers.

""Who Am I This Time,"" is based on the character of Christopher Walken,  who is more comfortable playing different characters in local plays than being himself.

Susan Sarandon's character comes to town and is cast as Stella in ""Streetcar Named Desire"" opposite Walken playing Stanley and sparks unite. Unfortunately, at first it is only on stage. But she draws him out.

Helene Shaw (Susan Sarandon) has always been in love with actors in films. Hardwar store clerk, Harry Nash (Christopher Walken) is a method actor who has played many characters hence the title ""Who am I this time?

It has a spectacular cast, and we have the advantage of seeing Christopher Walken as an amateur actor with no real private life playing scenes from Cyrano de Bergerac, The Importance of Being Earnest, and -- most importantly -- Streetcar Named Desire. Susan Sarandon is a colorless telephone company employee who falls in love with him as Stanley Kowalski, only to realize that he is someone else entirely - in fact, that he is apparently no one at all. Having taught all these plays in my classes, I would have given a lot to own this CD in years past. Walken nails Cyrano, and he nails Stanley. Why not? He's Chistopher Walken. As a sometime actor, I am also experienced in the issue of falling temporarily in love with one's costar in the heat of the production. What one learns from this seemingly simple tale is priceless.

Walken and Sarandon are brilliant in roles that could have been over-played, over-sentimentalized, turning a tight, cohesive script into melodrama.  Of course Jonathan Demme was known for his superb direction.  And the beauty of the story is that a youngster, not yet quite able to abstract, may enjoy the work on a simply surface level.  The adult thinker will probe the layers of meaning that some unseen writer has scripted for us and help us try to understand who we are this time.

1043209,5,630553201X,"This tiny jewel about a romance between two community theater actors was made in 1982, but the costumes, hairstyles and setting place it vaguely in an earlier time.  It doesn't matter.

The Kurt Vonnegut story is low-key.  A telephone company employee played by Susan Sarandon in town on temporary assignment, is co-opted into performing Stella in a community theater production of A Streetcare Named Desire.  Her Stanley, a pathologically shy and inarticulate hardware store clerk played by Christopher Walken comes to life only when playing a role, but when he does, stand back! He's brilliant.

Everyone in town takes the situation for granted, but Helene/Stella falls for Harry/Stanley in a big way.  The only problem is that Harry is absolutely tongue-tied when he's not delivering lines.  What wil happen?  Will life imitate art and will this relationship end in Tennessee Williams-esque frustration and tragedy?  It seems likely, and this little hour-long movie keeps the viewer in suspense for its duration. Mr. Walken and Ms. Sarandon's performances are simply amazing although everyone in the cast is splendid. Look for a Vonnegut young lady as one of Harry's fans.

I wouldn't spoil the ending for anyone, but will just say that the combination of Vonnegut, Demme, Walken and Sarandon is spectacular.  This is one of the best hours you'll ever spend with a movie.",1295740800,,1374,5.1441441441441444

Sure, it's not the best film that Walken and Sarandon have starred in, but it comes very close. With a condensed length, it features a fascinating chemistry between the duo's characters, and I truly think it's one of the more realistic ones in all of cinema. Walken plays Harry Nash, a methodical stage actor who happens to be awkwardly shy. He takes part in a local theatrical production community, and he happens to be the big star. Enter Sarandon as Helene Shaw, a lonely employee who decides to audition for the female lead in the next small-town production, A Streetcar Named Desire.

1043245,5,630553201X,"This utterly delightful Vonnegut story, dramatized exquisitely by Jonathan Demme, was first aired as part of the American Short Story series on PBS.  (Others of note include Fitzgerald's ""Bernice Bobs her Hair"" with Shelley Duvall and Bud Cort, Anderson's ""I'm a Fool,"" with a youngish Ron Howard (he still had hair!), and Richard Wright's ""Almos' a Man,"" with Levar Burton (following his ""Roots"" stardom).  Depending on which season, the host was an aged Jimmy Stewart or Colleen Dewhurst.  Each was a jewelbox of small treasures.

Set in small-town America in the 50s, the story centers around Walken, a clerk in a hardware store, who is painfully shy and awkward but who blossoms on stage in the community theatre productions where he portrays Cyrano and Abraham Lincoln with aplomb and brilliance, but is too timid to even linger for curtain calls.  When Susan Sarandon's character arrives in town, a traveling rep for the phone company installing new billing equipment, she is encouraged to audition for the company's upcoming production of ""Streetcar Named Desire"" with Walken, of course, playing Stanley.  Much like Walken's character, Sarandon's is a somewhat shy and reclusive young woman, good at her job, but never in one place long enough to make personal connections.  In her audition held at the high schoo library with the director, Walken stops by and is trapped into reading with her; her first read as Stella was halting and emotionless.  But Stanley, who removes his shirt--yes, they would have seen Brando's performance on screen-- while Stella stares in admiration, evokes repressed emotions of our burgeoning Stella into giving the reading of a lifetime!  She is cast!  Opening night is stellar---but of course Walken disappears after one bow.  Sarandon, who is now smitten but has come to know that Walken can only become more ""socialized"" with a script in hand!  Her ""device"" to keep him after the last night is clever and appropriate to the title and Walken ultimately proposes to Sarandon, as Earnest Worthing and she accepts!

The other company members gather on the sidewalk outside the hardware store to congratulate the couple.  When the director asks them if they would consider starring in the next production, Sarandon, with Walken behind her in an affectionate embrace, asks ""Who are we this time?""  It is warm, romantic, clever (Vonnegut, you know)and quietly and subtley treats the human need to discover our roles. And any viewer who has been involved in community theatre will identify! If ""all the world's a stage,"" then we are, indeed, but small players.  We just need the right script!  The acting portends the continuing successes of both stars.  Walken, following the ""Deer Hunter"" and Sarandon, after ""Rocky Horror Show,"" continue to give us these ""great performances"" they did in ""Who am I This Time!""",1229385600,,2846,5.0969827586206895

I simply adore Christopher Walken as a shy store clerk that isn't quite sure how to express his feelings toward Susan Sarandon.  It became one of my all time favorites immediately after watching it.  It is a wonderful movie and I recommend it to anyone.",1199923200,,389,4.287671232876712
1043291,4,630553201X,"I remember watching this movie in English Lit class in high school.  Great romantic story...I think this might have even been filmed before Susan Sarandon made it big.  And a fabulous performance by Christopher Walken.  Tony Shaloub from Monk should rent this and take notes...anyway, great rental for anyone who loves a simple romance or just to see two great actors chew up the scenery.",1199059200,2,388,4.938461538461539
1043292,5,630553201X,"A very sweet and endearing comedy with Susan Sarandon and Cristopher Walken playing young, neurotic love early in their careers and at the top of their game.  Sarandon is an inhibited TelCo employee who, while visiting a small town to train local staff, is 'discovered' by the local theater club director desperate to find his Stella for a very, very local production of Streetcar.  Her first appearance will be opposite Walken, who plays Stanley with complete abandon and fire to burn.  Sarandon discovers not only a hidden talent but also a burning and first-time-ever passion for Walken, who can only turn it on when he is onstage.  Can these two ever overcome their inhibitions in real life, their on-stage heat notwithstanding?

Production values are rather low as this was a made-for-TV movie in the '80s.  However, Vonnegut's writing is tender and revealing, the supporting cast is completely charming and dry, and the two leads just burn the house down.  Demme's direction is sparing and right to the point.  Running time is on the short side at 60 minutes, yet the powers that be manage to round it all up very tightly by the end of the show.  A gem of a date movie you never heard of.",1191715200,2,1194,4.729468599033816
1043293,5,630553201X,"I first saw this movie on PBS in the early 1980's, when I was a young teen. The film is directed by Jonathan Demme and stars Christopher Walken and Susan Sarandon, all three Academy Award winners. It's based on a Kurt Vonnegut story. What a combination! Great film!",1188432000,2,265,4.541666666666667
1043294,5,630553201X,"First of all, if the names Walken, Sarandon, Demme, and Vonnegut haven't intrigued you enough to buy this unseen, I don't know if my review will convince you. I had seen this short film on cable almost 20 years ago, and have been telling people about it ever since, so I bought it as soon as I found it was available on DVD. Then before I got a chance to watch it, I lent it to my neighbors who are involved in community theatre; they loved it so much they called to ask if they could keep it to give as a graduation present for a party they were going to for a young actress. She evidently loved it as well, so I had already turned three people onto it before even having a chance to watch it myself. So, I bought a second copy.
I had always raved to people about Chris Walken's performance, but found when I finally watched it again that I couldn't take my eyes off Susan Sarandon. Both performances are simply wonderful, but what else would you expect? The story by Vonnegut is sweet and sentimental and funny and romantic. Jonathon Demme's direction is wonderfully intimate, and the supporting cast is definitely up to the level of the leads. The DVD even has a study guide, which would make it a great tool to use in high school English or Drama classes. Some may not want to invest in such a short film (it was made for TV, under an hour), but this is a gem of a film.",1187913600,3,1374,4.208333333333333
1043295,5,630553201X,"I first saw this short film on PBS in the early-80's when Susan Sarandon and Christopher Walken were young (and so was I)!  Written by Kurt Vonnegut, one of my favorite authors, it is like nothing any of these people have done before or since.  Many actors become their characters, yet are shy off-stage. This story takes that idea to extremes in a touching way.  Who Am I This Time takes place in a small town, and involves its community theatre, in which Christopher Walken's character is always the heartthrob leading man.  Susan Sarandon travels with the telephone company, which brings her to this same small town for a few weeks. I hesitate to say much about the plot beyond this, so as not to give it away. Suffice to say, that the character development is superb, through the writing, the directing and the acting.  Highly recommended if you are a fan of Walken, Sarandon, or Vonnegut, or even if you just want to see a great little film.",1173484800,7,946,4.57396449704142
1043296,5,630553201X,"I have acted and directed for many years and just saw this film.  It is an extraordinary piece that provides a demonstration of how acting works -- and it does so in a very short amount of time and in an engaging way.  Walken is pure genius in his body language, facial expressions, use of his voice, everything an actor needs to perform well.  I don't think I have ever seen (or ever will see again) such amazing acting.  The story is cute and touching, but it is merely a vehicle for the stars to shine, which they do - brilliantly.  See this movie and -- please, someone, put it on DVD.",1101427200,34,589,4.223214285714286

This little flick did that to me, when I was a young and impressionable student who stumbled across a PBS film festival, and I'd love to have the same experience again -- preferably with a DVD version of ""Who Am I This Time?""  Twenty years ago, I had no idea who Christopher Walken or Susan Sarandon were, but their understated yet passionate -- pulsating! -- acting left a big impression.

It takes them away from deep hurts into situations where they can get outside themselves. It also is very humble in its premise, its length, the setting, the community.
