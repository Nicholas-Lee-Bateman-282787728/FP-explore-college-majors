4675439,5,B005FISC0C,This is a must have. This show really has you capitive and lot of drama love Ringer Glad that CW picked it up since CBS was going to air it and then decided not to. Thank you CW this show makes you want more,1328572800,3,207,3.727272727272727
4675440,5,B005FISC0C,"I finally caught up on Ringer via DVR recording. What twists and turns! The plot thickens! Sarah Geller is a superb actress as Buffy and now in Ringer. Amazing two-faced roles she plays. Now I wonder who is on the side of the evil sister? Her husband, her boyfriend or the husband's secretary? Can't wait to see the end or maybe not so it can continue to next year! Looking forward to getting the DVD to review again.",1327622400,3,417,4.358974358974359
4675441,5,B005FISC0C,"Ringer is one of the greatest surprises of the new shows 2011 brought us. While normally the CW focuses on shows for young adults, Ringer is a show for mature audiences, providing a refreshing alternative drama to the typical crime dramas flooding the small screen. The show is mysterious, riveting, delivers superb acting and great suspense. Sarah Michelle Gellar is at her best lending a sensitive, nuanced dimension to her role, and combined with the genius of the writing, the complex plot, always keeps you guessing, but you really what will happen next. The result is an immersive drama thta never lets go. This is one of the best adult dramas CW ever had (or ever will have). For mature audiences, I would rate it a cut above CW's other shows (with the exception of Nikita and One Tree Hill). Good drama at its very best, and more original than the majority of dramas airing on the small screen this season. A true delight.",1323388800,5,930,4.676829268292683
4675442,5,B005FISC0C,Ringer is THE BEST SHOW EVER... I LOVE Sarah Michelle Gellar!! She is AWESOME! I'm dying to buy the DVD! That's all I have to say.... :) PRE-ORDERING IT! xo,1316563200,14,156,4.233333333333333
4675443,3,B005FISC0C,"The following enthusiastic review was based on the pilot. After the sixth episode I gave up, heartbroken. I so wanted it to be a ""winner"". The show is very well done and the premise was promising but the writing is weak. Gellar is still luminous and I hope she finds a better vehichle. Having said that, here is my ORIGINAL REVIEW: ""She's back and the show is super--great premise, good dialogue, great FX, great cast, costumes, sets, locations, music. Top-of-the-line and Gellar looks absolutely fantastic! What a glorious WOMAN she has become!""  (The foregoing quote was written in Sept 2011. This revision was written in Sept2012.) A huge dissapointment; this lovely actress deserves better...",1316217600,20,696,5.105263157894737
4675554,5,B005FISC0C,"With the exception of one poor cinematc shot in France I loved this series.

Well thought out even if it is based on circumstances and events following upon each other that is hardly plausible, this had me riveted to the screen.

I really hope a second season is about to air soon!

4675556,5,B005FISC0C,"This show is amazing. I loved, it just lost a lot of viewers because of timing. They need to make a season two and revive it",1352073600,4,124,3.8076923076923075
4675557,5,B005FISC0C,Awesome show. They need to bring it back. There are a lot of fans that want to see this come back.,1351382400,2,98,3.7142857142857144
4675558,5,B005FISC0C,Ringer is the only show that had so many twists and turns that the audience became infatuated with this fun drama! The CW put on a show that was different from its normal teeny bopper hit. That's why we want a DVD release and a second season!!!,1342051200,2,244,4.212765957446808

4675561,5,B005FISC0C,"Ringer it's a great show, have a great story and talented actors. I feel like the CW had thought it would be a hit show a la ""vampire diaries"" and would have a legion of  fans, and even they were not wrong about the numbers,but Ringer fans are PASSIONATE about this show, and I think it deserves a second chance.

For instance, take Firefly, it was (and is) a great show, but they expected more from it and cancelled it... bad idea. Many fans fought for it and they even got a motion picture named serenity!!

I hope this is the case of Ringer. The show has potential and a growing fan base. CW needs to see they have made a huge mistake.",1340236800,4,638,4.170731707317073

I know SMG (who is perfect btw) is pregnant, so I understand why there won't be a season 2 in September 2012, but I really, really, really hope there will be one in 2013 (and then many many more!)

4675594,5,B005FISC0C,"I love Ringer and hope somehow another network does pick up this amazing show.  It's one of my all time favorite shows and is one of the only shows that had me begging for more each week.  Ringer defiantly deserves to be continued for a season 2.  It's iTunes 3rd highest show of the CW, it has been nominated for 14 awards before, during, and after its run and is airing in more than 40 countries worldwide.  CW you made a big mistake for cancelling this amazing show.  Please Amazon release the DVD using your on demand service it deserves to be on DVD at least!",1340064000,3,564,4.283018867924528
4675595,5,B005FISC0C,First Hellcats and now Ringer.  What's up with these network execs that keep cancelling shows before a giving them a decent chance.  Ringer was one of the best new shows this season.  I would have really loved to have seen what becomes of these characters that I genuinely cared about.  Can't wait for the Blu-Ray.  Maybe enough will sell that the CW execs realize what special show they had.  Kind of like how FOX did with Family Guy (Oh yeah I went there),1339632000,5,457,4.445783132530121
4675596,5,B005FISC0C,"""Ringer"" is a great show.. so OF COURSE the CW canceled it.. I just wish that this DVD may come with a bunch of special features to let you know how everything ended, since it leaves a lot open for a 2nd season. Just wishing that these studios would actually give a television show a chance to build up a following. Seems like they expect to see a HUGE number of viewers right away or it's the ax! I know they averaged about 1.8million viewers, guess that's not enough. I'll definitely buy the DVD when it comes out though, since it really was/is an awesome show.",1339027200,10,563,4.320754716981132
4675597,5,B005FISC0C,"""Ringer"" quickly became my one favorite shows of the new season. It was nice seeing Sarah Michelle Gellar on my TV again. Although be no means perfect, it was a fun escape to enjoy for an hour each week. I think where they went wrong was they  didn't keep up the pace after the pilot. How they thought slowing things down was a good idea, I'll never know. They should've hit the ground running & kept going. was the show far fetched? Yes. Were the stories campy and over the top? Yes. But that's alright. I hope that there's a wrap-up episode on the DVD when/if it's ever released. Ringer will be missed along with Missing, GCB, etc. Bottom line, Ringer was fun, but flawed.",1337558400,7,674,4.392

4675599,5,B005FISC0C,I'm so disappointed this show has been cancelled after only one awesome season.  Here's hoping CW rethinks its decision to ax this before it had a chance to establish itself.,1336780800,3,174,4.8

4675602,5,B005FISC0C,"I never watched Buffy...not because I was too young (definitely not!) but because I just wasn't really interested in the concept. So, this was my first time seeing Sarah Michelle Gellar in a TV series and I have to say - I'm a fan. I wathced Ringer from the very beginning and I am SO hopeful that there will be a second season. At the very least, I'd like to be able to get the first season on DVD. I felt genuinely interested in the fate of the characters and many of the plot twists were truly surprising. Team Bridget all the way!!!",1335657600,3,536,4.213592233009709

I loved that they gave us small clues throughout and you had to keep a close watch not to miss any. I was so disappointed when they didn't even give us at least one more episode-- for closure -- that I never watched the CW again.",1526947200,,403,4.17948717948718

8470024,5,B005FISC0C,"CW, you were my nightmare after I found out you canceled RINGER. What you did not like a major star in a very interesting show that kept viewers rapt until next week?

8470025,5,B005FISC0C,"I really think that they really should have given Ringer the chance to have a season 2. All the actors in this show did an amazing job. When I watched the last episode of season one all I wanted was to see  more seasons. I think that the season 1 finale was a cliff hanger. I really wanted to see what happens to both of the sisters. I was going for Andrew divorcing Siobhan for everything that she has done and put him through. Only for him and Juliet to later realize that they both miss having Bridget in their lives and that even though he thought she was his wife he really did fall in love with the Bridget for how she was and how she treated his family. I think that Siobhan should lose Andrew and Henry for being obsessed with getting revenge on her sister for the accident that killed her son. I think that Henry should have a second chance of getting his life back. I am really going to miss this show. I really enjoyed watching. I do believe that producers made a huge mistake for cancelling that show, they really should have given it a second chance with bringing back a season 2. There are shows out there that really do suck but yet you still see some of them on TV. I strongly say that this show SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN CANCELLED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1372896000,6,1256,4.2552301255230125
