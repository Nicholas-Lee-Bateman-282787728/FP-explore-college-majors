3176129,5,B0017X6ZUI,"This is the best movie ever for teaching kids some basic physics concepts, and it had the added bonus of the great how-to section on building the fastest pinewood derby car possible.  I learned some physics concepts, even!  This movie is appropriate for kids or adults and kept my scout's attention through to the end.  This was the best money spent on scouting or movies in a long time!

We popped popcorn and watched this as our family movie one Friday night about six weeks before the big race.  Our nine-year-old scout absolutely loved it, and actually learned some physics.  He was explaining physics concepts to the older boys and the scout leaders, and was able to apply these concepts to his car.  I am a physician, loved physics and math in college, and I was enthralled!  Some formulas I don't even remember learning, and there was a review of the formulas I actually remembered.  There were really fabulous explanations of the concepts, all presented in a child (and adult) friendly manner.  My teen girls watched and learned, as well as my husband.  We will watch this several times again before we make next year's cars.

This video also helped our children make some FAST cars!  This was our first year in scouts.  Our son placed second in his division and is heading to districts in a few weeks.  One daughter placed first and the other daughter tied for second in the adult and siblings division.  We had our children do much of the hands-on work (we bought coping saws so they could cut and sand on their own), but Dad still had to help with some of the more dangerous parts (power tools).  We spent the extra money on titanium putty and did not melt the lead as demonstrated in the DVD, but appreciate the demonstration of mold making that was included in the DVD.

The DVD also included a template for the design shown in the movie.  We simply popped the DVD into the computer and printed out the design templates.  This did simplify the process somewhat.  The author's car-making process was very complicated, but we were able to use most of the ideas he demonstrated and still make some very, very fast cars.  Next year we're planning to start even earlier and use all of his ideas that he presented.  Don't get overwhelmed, though!  Even just using some of the key components of his recommendations will still make your child happy with how fast his car is.  And he'll be the smartest scout in the pack!",1302134400,2,2425,4.596736596736597
3176130,5,B0017X6ZUI,"really excellent product.  We found this after our very first tiger pinewood derby experience.  My 6yr old son loved watching the DVD and really did learn and has been able to apply some physics.  We then had a ball planning and then making our own 24 ft track in our crowded basement, so that too was a great project together. the step by step instructions were clear and worked!  I suppose we are ready for next year and we now understand how we can make that car go fast!

3176131,5,B0017X6ZUI,"This is a very useful product!

Our 7 and 8 year olds learned about the physics of car design just as the description says - for instance: center of gravity; why running on 3 wheels can be better.

They were also very methodical about the build
- Tallying up the weight of each part to decide how much to add to get up to 5 ounces.
- They chose the wheels to use based on how cleanly they roll.
- They made design decisions (one chose to have all 4 wheels touch and came in a few hundredthes of a second behind the other, and knew why after the fact).

They could even comment on what made other ""good looking cars"" seem like bad designs from a speed perspective (they were correct!).

And while winning was by no means the main goal for me as compared to learning, they HANDILY took 1st and 2nd place overall.

So the derby turned into far more than a simple wood working project.  You will spend the same $$ on lots of things that get far less value to you.",1300233600,2,959,4.129032258064516

his design won the best design in my son's pack.

the process to build the best car is involved. and takes some tools to get done properly. but if you follow his system to the T your pinewood car will be the fastest in your pack.( make sure to follow the rules of your race n some steps)

our car came in second place. now this may sound like a not so good finish, but we had a rule change half way thru the week before the race which forced us to run 4 wheels on the track and with totally unmodifid wheels. others only ran 3 wheels on the track and had modofed/lathe wheels and we beat all of them by a foot or more except for one that only finished .0016 of a second ahead of us on average of 3 runs.",1265500800,2,722,3.838926174496644

8267686,3,B0017X6ZUI,"Very informative but makes promises it cannot keep

I enjoyed using this video to explore with my son the physics behind the race. I was extremely annoyed by the focus on winning. It is simply impossible to promise a kid his car will win. Loved the physics and the focus on how to experiment.",1487030400,,292,4.407407407407407

8267688,4,B0017X6ZUI,"I bought this as a direct download (about 1GB), and both my son and I greatly enjoyed watching the video.  The production quality is very high and Dr. Acton does a good job trying to teach the science to the viewer.  One of the best aspects of the video is that Dr. Acton shows the power of the scientific method and how careful experiments with repeated measurements can guide your design decisions.

Is the video perfect?  No, but it is easily worth its cost for people looking for an educational view into how to build a faster pinewood car.  There is a youtube video that cites Dr. Acton's video, and it is also worth a watch, but I don't think it replaces Acton's video.

Why 4 stars instead of 5?  As other people have noted, Dr. Acton uses lead (Pb) in his construction techniques.  While my father and I used lead when I was a child 30+ years ago, I think we should be wise and avoid its use.  Secondly, some of the construction techniques, such as the set screws, are probably beyond most people.  Finally, I think the video places too much stress on winning and should have instead of talked more about doing your best and learning as much as you can.  Winning is great for one person, but the rest of us can still learn lots and do our best.",1421625600,,1252,4.330472103004292

I sent two emails spaced a week apart to the seller and he never responded. It is now 12 May and it still hasn't arrived.

8267694,5,B0017X6ZUI,"This video describes the physics and engineering behind the pinewood derby.  I am very pleased with its content.

Dr. Acton, a physicist, explains and illustrates the science and experiments used to construct and optimize a fast car for the pinewood derby.

Some of the material uses freshmen college-level physics, and will go completely over the head of a young cub scout.  But I wouldn't change the content of the DVD to dumb it down one iota.  I watched this video with my 8 yo son, and would pause the DVD whenever complex subjects such as ""Lagrangian Mechanics"" were introduced.  Don't worry, most of the video doesn't involve partial differential calculus.  The main concepts are summarized in simple easy-to-implement ideas.

I especially enjoyed and learned something from Dr. Acton's center of gravity lecture (so even dads with engineering backgrounds can benefit).  I found his wheel alignment method clever, and might employ something similar to my son's car, if I have the patience and time.  (I am guessing that Derbyworx's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pro-Body-Tool-2/dp/B005PU01EA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pro Body Tool 2</a>&nbsp;is the more-effective tool for drilling axle holes in the car's body for proper axle alignment.)

Is this overkill?  I guess it is if you don't care about the science. But as a home-schooling father of an 8 yo cub scout, I appreciate this video on many levels.
a)  It teaches engineering dynamics, and illustrates experimental engineering.
b)  It illustrates experiments that my son can replicate.
c)  It illustrates fairly sound construction principles in building a car.
d)  It introduces the young scout to the ""scientific method"".....which is a gate way for earning a ""science"" belt loop and activity pin.
e)  It illustrates engineering sweat and attention to detail that goes into optimized designs (Edison's 99% perspiration, 1% inspiration).

And as a bonus, if the young scout applies the principles illustrated in this video, he will probably have a highly competitive car.  But to me, winning the derby is secondary, and the educational value is primary.  This video was exactly what I was looking for.  And for this, I give Dr. Acton's video 5 stars.  I don't desire to compete above the pack level anyway.  :-)",1354406400,,2318,5.395543175487465
8267695,5,B0017X6ZUI,Great learning resource for science and the scientific method. This video goes through all the variables needed to perform a scientific investigation.
