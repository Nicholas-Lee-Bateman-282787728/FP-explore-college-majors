8183094,5,B000O5LZK0,"I borrowed this videos from my bellydance teacher and have now added it to my own wish list with the highest priority. I own several basic bellydance instruction videos and enjoy them very much but for truly understanding exactly what you can do in every nuance her sizzlin videos simply cannot be beat.

Each video begins with a section on posture. How to avoid hurting yourself and where your weight should be. She does an excellent job of showing you both good and bad posture and exactly how it appears from all sides.

The main instruction on the videos begins with a break down of exactly what muscles you will be using. That is followed by the difference between muscle and skeletal based movement and the difference between creating space and creating movement. From there you learn the beginning to advanced versions of moves and the differences between them.  From larger skeletal based movements to smaller movements to complete muscle control in the upper chest and isolations.  It was all very impressive and I enjoyed it immensely.

Instructions are followed by drills you can use to imprint them on your muscle memory.

I have yet to actually finish the video since I have trouble with layering arm movements etc. over isolations so eventually I hit a point I was out of my league but I am looking forward to improving enough to be able to follow along.

The only flaw in the entire video I could find was that the chaptering left something to be desired.  It just isn't that easy to use if you want a specific part rather then an entire lesson. Even with that I still give it a full 5 stars because it is just that good.

It may be a little more expensive then other instructional videos but if you are a serious student, and not just learning to bellydance for fun or as a social activity, it is worth every penny and then some.",1238371200,3,1845,4.566666666666666
8183095,5,B000O5LZK0,"This is an excellent video to develop the muscles necessary for torso movements in belly dance. The instruction is clear and Ava Fleming demonstrates her perfect isolation technique. She has another video in the same series that covers hip movements.
Chapters include: theory, basics, drills, combinations and a lovely performance at the end that illustrates well the material covered.",1217376000,3,385,5.5423728813559325
