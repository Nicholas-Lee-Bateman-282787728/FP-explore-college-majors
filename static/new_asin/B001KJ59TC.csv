8315011,4,B001KJ59TC,"I purchased this dvd having seen CC before on television. It is not a disappointing dvd at all from an investigation standpoint. I don't exactly believe in all her methods of divination, but to each his own. I would have really loved to see more episodes on this.
Just remember that all Ghost Hunters have to start somewhere, and not all of them have an expensive film crew or equipment to work with. This needs kept in mind while viewing this tape. CC prefers to work with a minimal crew, which to me is better than some of the full crew dvds I own. Definately worth a buy.",1258848000,,574,4.324074074074074
8315012,5,B001KJ59TC,"Watching CC go on paranormal investigations was pretty interesting. Similar to what is on television right now, CC has her own little twist to dealing with the paranormal which in my opinion is refreshing to see. Her dvd will fit nicely in any paranormal dvd collection.",1243555200,,270,4.891304347826087
8315013,1,B001KJ59TC,"When I first viewed it, I liked it, but the more I look at it, the more I realized, this is not such a good thing. The acting is shallow, yes, I said acting. There is alot of chatter about nothing. And to be honest, I am finding any of this to be believeable. The building owner of the ice cream factory pretending to be scared gave the whole charade away.

Ultra low budget...so low a young tween kid is the camera man.

At first I felt the EVP's were the spookiest I had heard in awhile, but now I am wondering if they too were not faked.

You be the judge.",1241049600,,559,3.9732142857142856
8315014,5,B001KJ59TC,"Awesome dvd, and and it was entertaining from start to finish. I highly recommend this to anybody who is interested in the paranormal.",1231891200,,134,4.869565217391305
8315015,5,B001KJ59TC,"I was pleasantly surprised after watching the CC The Huntress DVD.
She is a brave woman. I wouldn't go into the places this girl goes into.
Great Job! I highly suggest you watch this DVD. Scary stuff and real just like she says it is.
