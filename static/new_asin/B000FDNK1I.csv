8121286,1,B000FDNK1I,"I wanted to see these Cuban pianist in action with Cuban rhythms and such.  Except for one or two, all performances were strictly classical style with one or two grand pianos only.  No rhythm section. No band.  Cuban music is great dance music.  These performances were not dance mucic at all.  These perfomances were by great Cuban pianist but they were playing classical style piano instead.  No Cuban style music with it's complex rhythms, montunos and such.",1389657600,,461,4.922077922077922
