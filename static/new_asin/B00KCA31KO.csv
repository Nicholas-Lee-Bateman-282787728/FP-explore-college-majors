6414508,5,B00KCA31KO,"I have waited a long time for these to be available. Simon Dutton was the first actor I knew to play the Saint. I had read the books first, then saw these movies when originally broadcast on tv, then attempted to watch both Roger Moore and Val Kilmer. I still think Simon Dutton is the best Saint.

Regardless of who your favorite Saint actor is, the stories are excellent. Sadly, the image quality is of a 1980s videocassette. I'm pleased with this purchase. And if you are a Leslie Charteris fan, I think you'll be pleased with the purchase.",1409875200,9,543,4.484848484848484
6414509,5,B00KCA31KO,"I have been noticing this was judged very harshly from those who loved Roger Moore in the role as the saint. I have been a saint fan since it was re runed in the eighties on wwor TV Mon thru Fri. I happen to like Simon dutton in the role a lot he is a very good actor. I remember when he did by the sword divided in 83. Dutton also brings a whole new style to the role he is much tougher because the villains are very cruel but also very smart. The Brazilian connection & the blue dulac are my favorites in the set enjoyed seeing John Astin playing the head villain good actor as well. I also like the theme music to it am looking forward to the next set of the three remaining TV movies the software murders, the big bang & wrong number in which the action & the villains are just as sinister & good the romantic seens get better as well I remember when wwor aired them on Sunday evenings at 8pm rotating with the dick Francis mysteries. the way people cant stand cops this should be popular on DVD because Dutton has the cops chasing him around even more especially in the Brazilian connection clode teal character will remind you of Clouseau a klutz.",1408924800,3,1153,4.198198198198198
6414510,3,B00KCA31KO,"This is only OK because I was a big fan of ""The Saint"" with Roger Moore. The stories are good but that's all I can say decent about it. These are three full length films one three separate discs, all in one package. Most of the acting is terrible with the exception of Simon Dutton as Simon Templar (The Saint) and two or three character in each movie. The fight scenes are even worse. Since I didn't know that these even existed I was more than curious once I found out. But if you are not a true fan of The Saint and watching him figure out how to overcome the odds. Then don't waste your money or your time.",1408320000,12,610,4.091666666666667
6414511,5,B00KCA31KO,"The saint is back there is no qualms about it. I actually love Simon dutton in the role he was the Templar of the eighties. The action & the story lines are good with good suspense & excitement. I remember seeing this on wwor TV 9 when it first premiered in the US use to rotate on Sunday evenings with the dick Francis mysteries. Simon played the part superbly also remember when he did by the sword divided back in 83. The thing that really makes me love this version of the saint is that the villains are much smarter & much more sinister in there evil deeds.am looking forward to the saint set 2 when it gets released which will include the three remaining TV movies the software murders, big bang & wrong number. My favorite eps from set 1 are the blue dulac John As tin from the Adams family played a cool villain & the Brazilian connection where he made a fool out of the cops more then once. Simon Dutton incarnation of the saint is more superior to the kilmer film.",1407456000,,974,4.27027027027027
6414512,5,B00KCA31KO,"4.5-stars for Simon Templar (Simon Dutton) as something of a modern London Robin Hood/Bond blend. A most successful thief, debonair, cunning, and who often can best the police while helping them. Its an irregular crime show with a thief as the protagonist. It works well enough. Intriguing. Simon is a solo regular character. The series moves from city to city using many international actor guests

SDH SUBTITLES for three features, each over 1  hr.
1, THE BRAZILIAN CONNECTION: London: Simon Templar interrupts crime at a construction site. A baby abduction leads to an international crime ring. Many guest stars including David Ryall (Harry Potter); Gayle Hunnicut (A Woman of Substance); Nicholas Jones (Little Dorrit); & Danny Webb (Land Girls).

2, THE BLUE DULAC: Paris: A bomb kills 2 Templar friends in their Paris home ending possible testimony against George Lafosse (John Astin Addams Family). The Saint travels to avenge his friends. He poses as jewel thief Lamont, with a plan to heist the Blue Dulac necklace. Personally, I had just a smidgeon difficulty seeing Mr. Addams as a gangster. My problem because I watched 'The Addams Family' religiously in the 60s. Weakest of the 3 features, but OK.

3, FEAR IN FUN PARK: Sidney: a friend's daughter goes missing. Arriving in Sidney for a search, Simon bumps into old flame Felicity, whose family needs help with a questionable entertainment real-estate situation. Blackmail, murder, girl slavery and the beauty of Aussie city life all play a part.",1405814400,6,1509,5.121951219512195

8657544,5,B00KCA31KO,"If you are a fan of Roger Moore's portrayal of the Saint, you may have some trouble adjusting to Simon Dutton.  If you can do that, you will probably enjoy these programs.  Dutton makes a good saint.  Not as good as Moore, but good.

I streamed this series via Amazon Prime with no problems.",1505174400,,291,4.333333333333333

8657550,1,B00KCA31KO,"'The Saint' doesn't do well in this early --1980s-- BBC series.  Poor interior sets, poor supporting actors and a sort of awkward attitude.  Still Simon Dutton delivers the Saintly flair better than any other TV Saint.",1428537600,,218,5.027777777777778
8657551,2,B00KCA31KO,"I might be too generous here, but the 80's production value and poor visual quality make this a chore to watch. I loved the Saint's earlier incarnations, but the acting is often ludicrous, costumes are hilarious (John Astin's wig in one movie would have been turned down by Uncle Fester) and the stories are poor and contrived. Additionally, transfer issues with the source material leave gaps, jumping screens and (worst) horrid voice synchronization to the point of being one of those silly old saturday morning kung-fu flicks.

All said, the lead actor is okay, and it was worth watching if only for the Jensen-Healey Interceptor he drives. Other than that, it is a bad version of Remington Steele.

Oh, and I really didn't like it much... ; )",1424390400,,746,4.8203125
8657552,3,B00KCA31KO,"It's decently acted series but is a bit dated. It follows the Saint mythos but the storylines are a tad weak sometimes.

It's an ok series but in comparison to the other BBC series that are out there, it's one of the weaker series. If you're a fan of the books, it's a decent companion to the books.",1412985600,3,299,4.155172413793103
