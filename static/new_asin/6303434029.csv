7846252,4,6303434029,"I'm not a ballet fan, particularly; I picked this up because the cast includes Adam Cooper (of Matthew Bourne's ""Swan Lake"" and others), and I wanted to see him dance in a more traditional setting. I enjoyed the video [even though Cooper's role is secondary]; very ""Masterpiece Theater in dance"".",1034035200,,296,4.94

7846254,3,6303434029,"This ballet set in a house and garden where the three sisters and their family lives. Its a series of short dances by individual or groups of dances in the garden while the rest of the casts are residing inside the house. There are nice moments but the overall ballet is disappointing compared to other Macmillan ballets. Darcey Bussell and Irek Mukhamedov doesn't really project the level of passion and intensity as a couple, like the choreography suggests.  There is a short documentry on Mukhamedov's early days in the RB. It is very interesting if you are a fan of his dancing. There are clips from Spartacus and a couple of other ballets as well as an interview with him.",984009600,3,677,4.641666666666667
