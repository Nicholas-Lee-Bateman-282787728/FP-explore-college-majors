A spectacular journey into the depths of outer space, when in August 1977, NASA launches one of its most daring missions in space.  The Deep Space Spacecraft Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 are shot into space.  The task of the two probes: research into the outer gas planets of our solar system.  More than 30 years later, the two probes have already covered a distance of 15 billion kilometers and still send more unique

Data to the Earth. Countless recordings of these probes are today the only footage of the two planets Uranus and Neptune and their moons.  After 30 years of flight Voyager 1 is the farthest from Earth object that mankind has ever created.

ACROSS THE UNIVERSE: THE VOYAGER SHOW illustrates all technical, historical and astronomical details of the fascinating Voyager missions, which continue to this day. Narrated by Paul Kreshka.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Cape Canaveral, August 20, 1977. One of humanitys most daring missions of space age takes its beginning. Appreciating this truly unique moment the deep space probe Voyager II is sent into space on a Titan-3E-Centaur carrier rocket. 16 days later NASA sends the twin space telescope Voyager I in pursuit. Both space telescopes have one task: to explore the outer gas planets of our solar system.

Only by using the Swing-by or Sling-shot methods, based on the constellation of the planets at that time, the engineers managed to bring the Voyager space telescopes onto their course  this constellation only reoccurs every 176 years and not before the year 2153 another such mission would be possible. In 2009, more than 30 years later, both space telescopes already have covered a distance of 100 AE (15 billion km) and still are sending unique data to the earth.

Innumerable photos are still the only picture material of both planets Uranus and Neptune as well as their moons. The knowledge gained from this Voyager mission has influenced greatly and even facilitated any other space mission. This voyage is still going on and after 30 years of flight Voyager I is the object furthest away from the earth created by humans.

This is a very nice 30 minute computer generated documentary, which was a shame it was not produced in 3D. But what we get with the first 15 minutes is describing all of the the equipment of the two Voyagers space probes journey, which is totally amazing for the time the Voyagers were built, as by now all the equipment is so out of date compared to todays technology, but despite this, the equipment is still functioning 100% and sending data back constantly. But what I did like is the person who did the audio commentary, as he described everything in precise detail without making it too complicated for us non-scientific virgins, but what you also gain is a detailed description of the findings of the mission and technical explanation of the structure of the probe, that is helped with brilliant computer animated images.

As a final thought on this Blu-ray, despite it having great computer animation, nice music and a brilliant informative audio commentary, I wish they would release THE VOYAGER ODYSSEY onto the Blu-ray format, as this would be my ultimate Blu-ray Collection, as it is far more superior in computer animation, brilliant composed music and very informative information, without being bogged down with an audio commentary, so come in IMAGE Entertainment, get your act together and release it on the Blu-ray format, as you would have a winner on your hands.

Blu-ray Video Quality  BUSCH Media Group presents this Blu-ray disc in a stunning 1080p encoded image and an equally impressive 1.78:1 aspect ratio presentation. The computer animated images really stand out and the details of the Voyager and its different technical parts of the different components of the space probe are well defined and easy on the eye. So all in all this is a great image presentation and the people who did the computer animation did a really brilliant professional job. Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  BUSCH Media Group has released this Blu-ray with a German: 2.0 DTS-HD Master Audio Stereo and English: 2.0 DTS-HD Master Audio Stereo and is very clear and precise audio presentation, but what a shame they could not of upgraded it to 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, as then the sound would have been more appropriate for this science documentary, but despite this, it is still a good clear audio presentation. The running commentary can be listened to in either German or English, which you have to go to the menu to choose the language you require, as the German commentary starts automatically. But what you hear is very fascinating details of all the components that makes the Voyager work and is explained in great technical detail. What thing I found very strange is that despite the audio being in 2.0 DTS-HD Master Audio Stereo, I was getting some surround sounds via my back speakers.

With the left side of the panel you get to view computer animation moving images of the said solar objects listed above.

Finally, ACROSS THE UNIVERSE: THE VOYAGER SHOW documentary is totally fascinating and also informs us about the historic milestone in space travel that has been produced by the Voyager spacecrafts, and especially being given all the intricate fascinating detailed descriptions of finding out about its long journey mission in space and again all the technical explanation of the structure of the Voyager probes, and especially how long they expect the two Voyagers space probes journey to last. The only disappointment is that I wish the whole documentary lasted for at least 60 minutes, as it really only touched the surface of each planted Voyager visited and I would of loved to of seen more computer animated images featuring more in depth look at all the planets that the Voyager visited and really will only be of interest to fans of this sort of scientific space documentary. As a final thought is that when you check out on most Amazon web site you have to type in The Voyager Show  Across the Universe [Blu-ray] which is wrong, because it should be listed as ACROSS THE UNIVERSE: THE VOYAGER SHOW very strange. Because the Blu-ray is not long enough on giving us more stunning computer animation and even more technical detail of all the different planets that the Voyager space vehicle visited, I can really only give it a 3 star rating, which is such a shame and again I can only recommend this Blu-ray to people who are interested on the subject of space travel of this genre.
