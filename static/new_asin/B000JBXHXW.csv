8149482,5,B000JBXHXW,"This is an EXCELLENT DVD for anybody interested in the Lamborghini automobile. It covers the creator of the car, the reason he created it, the factory & the various models made. The disc goes from 1963 thru the new millenium & moves along at a good pace.",1363564800,,254,4.425531914893617

8149484,2,B000JBXHXW,This was a very quick review of older and newer models of bmw's. There is no 2002's and no 8 series. What a shame but i am still glad to have it.,1193011200,,145,3.5625

8149486,4,B000JBXHXW,"If you're interested in BMW cars, motorcycles & aircraft this DVD is a good start. It gives the whole history of the company from before the war all the way up until today. Though if you're interested in learning more about your specific BMW you may be slightly disapointed. It gives a very brief and I mean 'BRIEF' description of most of the models. The DVD is 90 minutes long yet I felt it was over very quickly. I own the car featured on the cover and expected a LOT more. All it does is talk about the Z3 & Z8 and its for about 5-10 minutes, as with the rest of the cars. It was very interesting seeing the older models though. Some of the models shown Ive never seen before and enjoyed learning about.

 I recieved a DVD from the company itself after purchasing my BMW and I found that one to be more informative and longer. I prefer the DVD the company sent me. If you don't own a BMW and are interested in learning more about these cars then buy it but if you do own one, a newer model for instance the company might have already sent you a DVD of the history and its better than this. Overall, its a good DVD for anyone interested in learning more about the company but I expected more.",1172620800,7,1194,4.1645021645021645
