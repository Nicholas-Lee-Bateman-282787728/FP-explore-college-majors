8603258,2,B000053V7K,"Playboy comes out with a new video called California Girls.  It has Suzanne Stokes (POM 02/00) on the Cover.  Sounds like a pretty hot video, with fresh new faces right?  Not really.  Suzanne's segment lasted one minute and forty-five seconds.  That's it!  I timed it.  The scene shows Suzanne in various skimpy bikini's, and every once in a while the camera pans past her and she isn't wearing the bikini.  Before you know it, the scene is over.
Playboy defines this video on the back of the cover as a collection of playboy's greatest California scenes from the past. There's no new stuff here.  Ninety percent of the video consists of segments from previous videos.  Maybe it's 100%, and I just haven't seen all the scenes before.  Some of the scenes date back to the late 1980s and early 1990s.  As you can imagine, this results in very poor and grainy DVD quality for these segments.
There are scenes from more recent videos, such as Playboy's Pajama Party.  The scene of the girls lying around the pool from the Pajama Party is included on this video.  Nice segment, but I already have it.  Also included in this video, are various scenes from the Wet and Wild videos.  Once again, some of them are nice, but it's old stuff. The only thing new in the video, as far as I can tell, is Suzanne's short appearance and a four or five minute scene featuring Summer Altice. Summer's segment shows her running and posing on the beach in and out of a bikini.  This was probably the highlight of the video because it was new, or should I say, it's new to me.  This segment will probably appear in the 2002 Playmate Calendar.
Overall, not much if anything is new here.  If you are a collector, you should probably pass.  If your new to Playboy video's, you can get a decent assortment of scenes with beautiful naked women.",977270400,29,1817,4.515337423312883
