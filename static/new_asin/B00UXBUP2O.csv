8708614,4,B00UXBUP2O,"The original ""The Umbrellas of Cherbourg"" was a musical film directed by Jacques Demy with music by Michel Legrand. According to Wikipedia the film dialogue is all sung as recitative, even the most casual conversation, similar in style to an opera. In the film, the actors voice was dubbed by singers.
This Blu-Ray presents a semi-staged, live production.  The actors are the actual singers. The stage is shared by the orchestra and directed by the composer, Michel Legrand. It effectively uses some props to make sure we follow the story.  This will be the best question for any student to argue; is The Umbrellas of Cherbourg an opera, a musical, theater or anything in between.  To make the argument even more lively, Madame Emery is cast by a known, and certainly great, opera singer, Natalie Dessay.
The result is a pleasant and enjoyable presentation.  The music is lovely, although the main melody repeats itself many times.  The singers/actors are up to the challenge.  What did bother me were the very visible microphones in their faces.  For a live audience it may be appropriate, but when it is recorded with many close-ups, it becomes too distracting. Dessay does a great job as Emery.
In summary, a pleasant and enjoyable symphonic version of an old film with nostalgic music.",1466121600,,1289,4.912442396313364
8708615,5,B00UXBUP2O,"This is a semi-stage performance of the theatrical version of Michel LeGrands famous movie from the 1960s which was a through-composed work which generated a number of popular cabaret songs.  Monsieur LeGrand, who must be at least 80, is represented in my collection of musicals by two efforts after the turn of the century, Amour (2002), and Marguerite (2008).  These both ran on the London stage.  Neither was particularly successful.  Both albums are pleasant for listening, particularly Marguerite with its compelling wartime story.
Concert performances of modern classic musicals, specifically Chess, Les Miserables and any by Andrew Lloyd Webber, provide some decent theater for some truly glorious music.  This story does not have a particularly epic scope, but it is marvelously realized on the French stage (and thus is sung in its original French).  LeGrand himself conducts the performance.  The cast, including one singer, Natalie Dessay, who was well-known to me, is uniformly excellent both for the singing and the dramatics.  The younger female lead, Marie Oppert, is beautiful and terrific with her facial expressions in this closely-shot video.  Whether you knew this show as a movie or just know that this song you know is from the movie, you will enjoy the 110 minutes that it takes to watch the DVD and enjoy the ravishing music in your theater sound system.",1459382400,,1378,5.171171171171171
8708616,5,B00UXBUP2O,"Fantastic! Beautiful, unique and romantic! Les Parapluies de Cherbourg on stage is as fascinating as was the movie fifty years ago! It has become a classic! Michel Legrand's score is so enchanting, it stays with you. Every line of dialogue is sung and you can't help humming along as soon as start the well-known songs. The sets, in their simplicity and elegance, let you through the story. Very fine performances from all the cast, they are highly trained professionals. A special mention for Vincent Niclo, a french tenor, whose talent and sensibility are behind his success.",1441324800,3,577,5.020833333333333
