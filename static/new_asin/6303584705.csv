7851246,4,6303584705,"UFC 5 saw the return of Dan ""The Beast"" Severn and honestly, a more focused and better rounded Severn because this time around he picked up some strikes and some finishing holds.  After his disappointing defeat in UFC 4 to Royce Gracie, you could tell that Severn was not only here to win it all, he was here to bust some heads.
The main draw was O.k.  The 1st quarter match was between Andy Anderson (Tae Kwon Do) and Jon Hess (SAFTA) and I have to admit, this was one of the dirtiest fights in the UFC.  There were a lot of rules infringements in this match by Hess like scratching at the eyes, fish hooking the nose and the mouth.  I will admit that this was a TRUE FIGHT but at the same time, it was very dirty.
2nd fight, Todd Medina (Jeet Kune Do) vs Larry Cureton (Kickboxing).  This match was a little disappointing as well because this was a match between 2 strikers and immediately it went to the ground.  Match 3 was very impressive from a grappler's point of view.  Oleg Taktarov made his debut here against Ernie Verdicia (Karate) and Taktarov showed the same calm and comfort level on the ground as Royce Gracie does.  And the final quarter match was between Severn and Joe Charles (Judo).  Severn made his presence felt by bringing out the big guns in this one and he showed off some new things that he learned.
The Super Fight was a return match from UFC I between Royce Gracie and Ken Shamrock.  This match is really long and a bit on the boring side, even for a scientific grappling match.  At first there are shades of a few strikes but for the most part this is a match dedicated to ""the guard"".  Another small highlight was from Canadian wrestler Dave Beneteau who also made his debut here as well.
All in all, UFC 5 was O.k.  I wouldn't call this one of the better ones but if you're a big fan of Severn's, this was for you because this UFC is all about Severn.  Oleg Taktarov also had a great showing but other than that, this one is for the grapplers.  For all of you striker fans, check out UFC 2 and UFC 6.  There is a lot of striking in those 2 and for you grapplers, check out the ULTIMATE ULTIMATE and UFC 4.",1044576000,,2137,4.239506172839506
7851247,4,6303584705,"After 4 consecutive UFC tournament appearances, Royce Gracie gets a Superfight against Ken Shamrock. Royce is psyched because of the one fight, and is at least on camera, very confident. The result: was a very  long/technical fight. These types of fights are not the most exciting to  the untrained eye, but should be respected. As far as the tournament; a  bigger, and  a little smarter fighter class. Dan Severn returns, while  others like Sambo champion Oleg Taktarov fall short due to bloody  circumstances. All in all, a good tournament, but the last we see of Royce  Gracie. Even with the new rules(Time -Limit), the 100% Jiu-jitsu style  became too ""one-dimensional"". But those who practice it will tell  you, 'BJJ isn't one dimensional', and I certainly agree. The birth of  cross-training sort of began in this tournamant.",963446400,3,831,5.044117647058823
7851248,2,6303584705,"Don't waste your money on this one.  The first fight is exciting, and it gets very bad after that.  The Superfight between Royce Gracie and Ken Shamrock is the worst fight in UFC history.  One good match, one OK fight,  and the rest make you sleepy.  Don't get it.",914630400,,264,4.3061224489795915
