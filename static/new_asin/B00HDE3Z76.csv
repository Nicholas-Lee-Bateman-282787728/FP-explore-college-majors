8631618,5,B00HDE3Z76,"This year, 2014, is the 300th anniversary of the birth of the great composer Christoph Willibald Gluck (1714 -- 1789). In celebration of Gluck, Art Haus Msuik has issued this 3-DVD compilation of live performances of three Gluck operas: ""Orfeo ed Euridice"", ""Alceste"" and ""Iphigenie en Tauride"".  Each of three has been released separately, but it is good to have them presented together as a tribute to Gluck for his anniversary. Gluck deserves to be celebrated and to be better known. He continues to be more revered as a name than for his music. For many years, only his ""Orfeo"" was part of the standard opera repertoire, but gradually several of his other operas, including the two in this compilation have received attention.

Gluck is best-known for the manner in which he fused text and music together in opera. He did so in a variety of ways, as the operas here show. He reduced empty, virtuosic gestures, and combined recitif and arias into a musically coherent unity. Gluck set Greek myth and was a humanist of the Enlightenment era. He showed varied passions and human characters in his music, which tends to be both strong and detached. He offered portrayals of strong women, as shown in two of these operas. The operas and the performances in this collection show Gluck in different ways, and I will comment on each briefly below.

1.  Orfeo ed Euridice remains Gluck's most famous opera. It tells the story of a musician who enters hell to rescue his wife only to lose her at the last moment. Gluck's opera was a revolutionary work, first presented in Vienna with an Italian text and then later revised in Paris. The version presented in this DVD is in Italian with some additions from the subsequent version.  The DVD is of a 1991 performance at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, directed by Harry Kupfer and conducted by Hartmut Haenchen. Kupfner's direction was highly controversial.  He set Gluck's opera in a large urban area with his hero a young rock singer in tight jeans and leather jacket slinging a guitar. He loses Euridice in an auto accident and enters into an urban hell. I sympathize with those who are uncomfortable with such adaptations, but I found this setting moving and convincing.  If the setting is debatable, the musical performances are outstanding, particularly countertenor Joachin Kowalski's passionate performance of Orfeo. He offers a dramatic rendition of the famous aria ""Che Faro Senza Euridice?"". The sound and the videos are of high quality with a great deal of ambience in the presentation. Running Time: 83 minutes.

2.  Alceste premiered in Vienna in 1767 with Gluck essentially recomposing the opera in Paris in 1776. Both the Vienna version and the Paris version have partisans.  The French version is presented here in a rare complete version.  The performance is by the Staatsoper, Stuttgart in 2006, Constantinus Carydis conducting. Based on a play by Euripides, Alceste tells the story of a heroic wife who offers her life to spare that of her husband, Admete whom the gods have decreed must die.  The heroine is at the center of Gluck's opera in a difficult multi-faceted part with large roles as well for Admete, chorus, and a walk-on part for Hercules who arrives to save the day.

This production also is presented in contemporary dress, with the two primary characters presented as modern day career, upwardly mobile individuals. There seems to be a fear that modern audiences will not be able to relate to the Greek figures.  Gluck was more interested in conveying feelings and motives than in conveying historical periods. I found irony in the presentation here, setting the conventionally modern characters against Gluck's heroism. But I loved seeing the production. Catherine Nagelstad is an effective Alceste. Of the rest of the cast, I enjoyed the chorus which plays a major role in the opera and its dynamic leader, Catriona Smith. The music to this French version of Alceste is beautiful throughout. Running Time: 165 minutes.

3. Iphigenie en Tauride was once neglected but has had frequent revivals in recent years. Many lovers of Gluck consider it his greatest opera in its seamlessly integrated music.  The opera premiered in Paris in 1779.  It is not a story of romantic love but rather tells of the friendship between two young men, Orestes and Plyades and of the heroism of Iphigenie, a Greek woman and sister or Orestes who serves as priestess in a pagan court. The king,Thoas, directs Iphigenie to put Orestes and Plyades to death.  Iphigenie is a strong heroic figure, as is Alceste in her opera.

This presentation dates from 2001 at the Zurich Opera House.  William Christie, the renowned conductor early music, conducts the orchestra ""La Scintilla"".  This opera does not use a contemporary setting, but the staging is still highly imaginative. The two major characters, Iphigenie and Orestes are each followed by a large, sinister puppet-like double which marks and pantomines the characters' feelings.  The doubles add a great deal dramatically to the setting.  Gluck, as a man of the theater, would, I fell, have appreciated this setting of his story. This is a heroic opera of the victory of Enlightenment over barbarism with strong performances from Juliette Galstian as Iphigenie, Rodney Gilfrey as Oreste, Deon van der Wait as Pylade, and Anton Sharinger as Thoas. Running Time: 108 minutes.

I have loved Gluck's music for many years and was pleased to see his 300th birthday remembered with this set. I hope his 300th might further be remembered, perhaps with new recordings, including recordings of other operas such as, for example, ""Armide"". This set is an excellent way to remember and to rethink Gluck. Each DVD is separately boxed with an informative brochure about the history of the opera.  There are no librettos, but the performances are subtitled.
