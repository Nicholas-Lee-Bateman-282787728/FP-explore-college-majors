Vampire witches who fight in terribly choreographed scenes and dialog that could have breaking ribs with laughter. Plan 9 From OUterSpace dons't stand a chance against this. Described by the writer and psychic Stephen Armourae on the Vampire Forum as a masterpiece- he's from England and thoroughly sarcastic.

It has Stephanie Beaton and the producers know whats going to save them from bankcrupcy by repeatedly using her. Though she leaves me cold as she looks more like the undead than all the devil raisers. And Eileen Daly is just a lower rate Elvira. The whole thing is amazingly entertaining!

Watch it for the script though",1523318400,,701,4.982905982905983

8301119,3,6305371407,"The story line has gone off the deep end with this installment! The ""hot"" detective returned from WC 9 - & joined forces with a white witch to fight against a satanist and a vampire who wanted to steal power away from a demon. If this were any further out there, it would have been a great comedy.  Instead, it was just poorly acted comic relief. Since I'm working on getting the entire series, I'm hoping the next one(s) will be better.  Please!!",996019200,8,447,4.373493975903615
8301120,5,6305371407,"OK so this movie isn't the greatest ever made. In fact I would say that It is one of the worse. But if you love bad movies, like I do then you will find this to be one of the best of the worst. Watch for bloopers its like an easter egg hunt that is all too easy. Basic plot of the movie is that there is some horrible cult leader doing bad things and he gets caught, then freed by a bunch of vampires. Then we get our female hero who likes to cavort around in a vinyl holloween costume and carries a plastic sword around. Aparently she has some kind of psychic attack because none of her attacks actually find their mark. The sound FXs are horrible and out of sequence, the actions scenes are laughable at best, the acting is painful, and the special effects could have been better if done on photoshop. All in all one of the best cheese flicks Ive ever seen.",991785600,,859,4.119047619047619
8301121,4,6305371407,"The Witchcraft series has always been about one thing, a boring plot, and a ton of sex . . . okay, that's two things.  Witchcraft X does not let down on either, so if your looking for a ""film"" with a choppy plot, no  moral (or morals), cheesy special effects and naked women doing the  horizontal hula, then this is your flik.  If not, then check out John  Hugh's latest  movie -- sissy.",946857600,11,387,4.232876712328767
