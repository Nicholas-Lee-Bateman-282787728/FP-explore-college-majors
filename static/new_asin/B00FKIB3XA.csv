5994790,4,B00FKIB3XA,"Sadly left off this, was dirty women under the sun(every day comes and goes)and rat salad featuring Tony Clufetos drumming ability. Most likely to add a few extra new songs from the 13 album. I went to Indy to see this tour, and clearly was the best tour I had seen Sabbath do. I have seen every tour since  the never say die tour. I was sad that Bill Ward wasn't with them, but Tony Clufetos blew me away. All in all I cant wait for this one to add to the collection.",1384214400,14,468,4.032258064516129
5994791,3,B00FKIB3XA,"1/12/2014 UPDATE:

So I ordered the DVD (from Amazon.com of course) and I gave an extra star to my review. In truth there is no need to pay the extra bucks for the Blu-Ray; the DVD is just fine; sounds great, perfect lenght, bare bones release with no extra features but guess what? Not needed, the guys playing the way they do is more than enough. I wish they had added subtitles for the lyrics but having been at a concert I can attest the DVD captures it perfectly. Almost as good as being there but with better seats and nobody blocking your view. The DVD is worth the price; don't bother with the Blu-Ray.

Thirty dollars for the Blu-ray?!? Really? Run time 190 minutes with nothing else? Compare with the Rush Clockwork Angels Tour running time of 242 minutes with plenty of bonus and special features for twenty bucks!
Don't get me wrong, I went to both concerts and they were the best of the year for me and two of the best I've ever seen. I love both bands but I will purchase the Rush Blu-ray and settle for the BS DVD unless they ""Gather in Their Senses"" instead of their ""Greedy Masses"".",1384041600,8,1099,4.35609756097561
5994792,5,B00FKIB3XA,"Finally a BS Concert with no Documentary interruptions! Not only that, it is well produced! The video editor is NOT on speed! Must of took a Quaalude before the edit session! It is shot well! Of course 5.1 DD and DTS, and well lit! Yeah, Sadly Bill Ward is not there, but Tommy Clufetos does an awesome job!!

In the beginning, they show some folks coming in with three generations to see BS, but the crowd is kind of mellow compared to concerts of the past. (I suspect they are not likely all high out of their socks, and the excitement in the arena is not quite ""the 70's Black Sabbath"" crowd.;-)  To be honest, Tommy looks like he is trying to stay conscious while playing. Not that he was ever a big showman/active, I mean it in the ""I have played this so much, I could probably be dead and still play this"". Oh, of course he is awesome as ever, but I very much get the feeling he is not in this for any long haul, and looks tired. It don't impact his playing at all.

BTW, these are just things I noticed, being a loooong time BS fan, and having been to the concerts in the 70's, the 2013 tour, and some closer shots than I was able to get at the show, on the DVD, and he looks tired. But they sound great!

Video: I give it 4.5 stars. (Thank you God the Hockey game producers took the night off!!)
Audio: 5 stars
Lighting: 4 stars (Yes, you can see the camera shots!!)
Overall: It is the first high quality Video and Audio theater concert DVD, and If you are a Sabbath fan, you MUST own this!!

I LOVE BS, and I love the DVD. So I will put the petty things I notice aside because this DVD blows away the VHS re-do of the 1978 concert!! Yeah, I know Bill... But he arguably has the most physical role in the band....

Track List:

War Pigs
Into the Void
Loner
Snowblind
Black sabbath
Behind The Wall of Sleep
N.I.B.
Methademic (New, but I like it, and it will grow on me...)
Faries Wear Boots (Nice to see this one on here!)
Symptom of the Universe
Iron Man
End of the Beginning
Children of the Grave (Another nice to see on here)
God is Dead?
Sabbath Bloody Sabbath (Intro) / Paranoid

All of the above it my opinion. I am not going to pick them apart, so if you disagree, write your own review and add some value.
The intent of my review is to provide some insight from a FAN of the band. having grown up in the 70's, having a lot of high tech Video/Audio gear as many of us do at home these days, and having no Sabbath disc for a very long time that did justice to the band on this nice equipment.",1383868800,50,2505,4.09795918367347
5994793,3,B00FKIB3XA,"Have a couple boots from this tour and they are amazing! I looked forward to this one. Ozzy is pretty really for him on the boots of course his vocals are pitch-corrected on this DVD(though know they are tuned down a whole step which helps). The absence of songs is a negative especially ""Dirty Women"". Tommy lacks the drum chops too bad Carl Palmer declined to tour with them opting to continue with Asia.",1381795200,11,406,4.5
5994794,5,B00FKIB3XA,"WOW!! Tony Iommi still has it. This has most of their best songs, and is probably the best concert left in them. Ozzy is one of the best frontmen ever!! He could have been a cop, he asked to see their f***ing hands over 20 times. Still a great concert!!!",1498435200,,254,4.1

5994796,5,B00FKIB3XA,"Brilliant concert, incredible production values/quality. The Band is incredibly tight. Tony, Geezer and Tommy are fantastic musicians!!! Ozzy was a little better than I expected, but that's not saying much. He spends most of his time reading the words for the songs from a video screen  and hobbles around the stage. What a plonker!!! The other guys didn't need music sheets to play! Still, an excellent Bluray concert experience, highly recommended.",1488931200,4,450,5.338028169014085

5994799,2,B00FKIB3XA,"I had the opportunity to attend 3 different Black Sabbath concerts back in the 1970's.  I can honestly say that I qualify as a "" Real Rocker"" to rate this concert performance of Black Sabbath on DVD , because I know the difference from now and then.  The music on this DVD is well performed , however , it lacks the Macabre Theatricals Black Sabbath is known for to their original fans from the 1970's.  This performance is perfect for an awards show such as the Grammy's , but not , for entertaining an audience of hard core Black Sabbath fanatics.  I believe that it is a very good idea the members of Black Sabbath have decided to retire.  They do not have the Dark Spirit in their performance any longer.

5994806,4,B00FKIB3XA,"Been going to Sabbath concerts since 1975, Bill Ward is only a tiny piece of the magick, always has been.  Tony, Geezer, and Ozzy
are Black Sabbath and still light up the magick, and probably play better than ever, being more sober and older.  So have I.  They still play hard rock and heavy metal and put on a really good show.  I saw a show a show on this tour, and wanted the DVD of what might be the last time I see the mighty Black Sabbath live.  Buy this DVD and enjoy seeing a 70's Great Band play a show and not try to act like it's still the 70's.  Tony's cancer is in remission, Congratulations!  Someone is watching over you.",1471132800,,636,4.121951219512195

5994812,5,B00FKIB3XA,"This concert blu ray is everything I hoped it would be - all the best classic songs with a few bits off their excellent recent album, all well shot and well recorded in front of an excited multi-generational audience.  Sabbath really shows the djent crowd how they ought to be making music!  The video is crystal clear and the sound is fantastic.  Sure, Ozzy's slowed down a lot and can't really move around the way he'd like any more, but that hardly matters when they sound as good as this.  I'll be honest - I really think Ozzy sounds as good as he ever has in this show.",1463788800,2,574,4.287037037037037

5994815,5,B00FKIB3XA,"Great concert video, Black Sabbath still at the top of their game.  Except with a different but very good drummer, I think the guy that was with Dream Theater.

A note to the concerned sound and recording engineers: The sound was dead due to the recording shut off the ride, crash and china cymbals from the drum performances by Tommy.
The cymbals will not create noise under balance control but lack of them will cause distortion.  What is the point of being there ???!!!",1455235200,,415,4.914285714285715

Second:  Better, worse, left or right, up or down, DIO is NOT Black Sabbath. Ozzy is, and he's in fine form here. This concert is Sabbath at their freakin' best on dvd.  The show kicks freakin ass and these guys are pushing 70! The new drummer is great, Geezer is always great and no one can play Toni Iommi leads on the Planet. Ever!!And somehow Ozzy sounds fantastic here. The picture and sound are great too.  And since all the other Black Sabbath dvds that been released  over the years are flawed for various reasons, though not really the bands fault.

Sound and picture quality couldn't be better. It is great to hear / experience once again (definitely) some of the essential Sabbath classics performed here like the frantic opener ""War Pigs"", the unforgettable ""Into The Void"", the bone-chilling band's moniker ""Black Sabbath"", ""N . I. B."", one of my personal favorites ""Fairies Wear Boots"", the ass-kicking ""Symptom Of The Universe"", ""Children Of The Grave"" and the grand finale ""Sabbath Bloody Sabbath / Paranoid"". Cannot forget the two new tracks that Ozzy and crew did off the new '13' CD (see my review). Wasn't at all surprised to see that this DVD was selling quite well.

What an underrated bass player Geezer is! Ozzy sounded great, and managed to remember all the lyrics, although I do think he was using a screen at the front of the stage. But hey, he's almost 70! I can't say I blame him. Tony sounded great and the drummer was awesome. The best part about the DVD though is the sound is phenomenal and the set list is even better. I have been listening to Sabbath since the 70's so the set list was a dream come true for someone who loves old Sabbath. I highly recommend this DVD for the old and young alike.",1426896000,,705,4.153284671532846

I was skeptical about this purchase (thought the guys were not up to it) and was utterly convinced that my apprehension was ill-founded. Man, Butler & Iommi sounded really sharp, and never missing a note, true to the original sound. Ozzy with his melodic voice brought back such good memories. The young drummer replacing Bill Ward was the glue that kept everything working, his performance was very powerful.",1419897600,2,456,4.935064935064935
5994867,4,B00FKIB3XA,"I saw their performance live twice during this tour, and those performances were far superior to this one.  They probably decided to use a show that was early in the tour because of concerns about Ozzy's reliability based on his past track record with drugs, alcohol, or vocally.  It showed.  The band sounded better later in the tour, and they also played a better set list.  There are zero extras on this DVD.  This felt like a giant money grab to me, as did the $300 plus dollars I spent for my two concert tickets.  But Sabbath is Sabbath.

Iommi and Geezer never sounded better and more in command of their axes. Their last album 13 provided new material mixed in with the classics, and it was as fine a Black Sabbath concert as I've ever seen or witnessed live--period. If you're not a Sabbath fan, you should check this out and you will become a Sabbath fan--believe it. The boys rock better now than they did nearly 50 years ago!! What a great band and with legions of new fans of ever growing ages between teens and their '50s like me.

5994906,5,B00FKIB3XA,"I went and saw this tour last summer at the Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View California. What a killer show! 'Sabbath did not disappoint. After having been broken up for 34 years (since 1979), they played together like they'd never been apart! I just had to have this Blu-Ray so I could relive the experience again and again. The picture quality is excellent! The ""production"" value is also excellent. Great camera work, editing and post-production make for a great (on video) experience. Blu-Ray is the only way to go. The high-resolution picture quality and color saturation is beautifully done. The only downside (for me at least) is NOT with the Blu-Ray but the fact that only 3/4 of the original Black Sabbath toured together, as Bill Ward did not take part in this ""re-union"" tour. Wish he had. Would have been really cool to have seen the original 4 members all together and playing together. Instead, they toured with Tommy Kluefatos on drums which was a great choice. He's an awesome drummer and I was truly impressed with his heavy metal drum skills behind the kit. Tony Iommi is indeed the ""riff-master"", and Geezer Butler is also one of the best bass players to grace the line-up of ANY band, anywhere. Ozzy is still Ozzy. This ""13"" tour was a long time coming and well worth the cost of my V.I.P. ticket to see 'Sabbath live.

5994907,5,B00FKIB3XA,"I hesitated buying this because of the high price and all the complaints about the sound. Well, I received it 3 weeks ago, have played it all the way through twice and played my favorite songs multiple times, so I can say with absolutely certainty that there are NO problems with my BluRay disc.

The picture and sound (especially DTS HD) are excellent and what I have come to expect from the best concert BluRays. So I would say they have fixed any/all problems with the audio tracks.

And the setlist couldn't be better, many of my favorites are here along with the best of the new stuff (I think most agree Methademic is the best of the new songs).

In fact my only real complaint is Ozzys voice, but thats the man, not a problem with the disc! And really, considering his age, and especially his lifestyle, I guess its to be expected. Or maybe even more than I expected. Its amazing what processors can do with sub-par singing these days!!

Bottom line: if you are a Sabbath fan I consider this essential, just hold out for a cheaper copy like I did. The original price is absurd considering what most other concert BluRays go for. (I agree with the conspiracy theory that Sharon had something to do with it!  lol)

Also, since they neglected to tour the south I guess this is as close as I'll get to the reunion tour.....unless they stay together and tour again!",1398384000,4,1367,4.469879518072289
5994908,3,B00FKIB3XA,"I am a big Black Sabbath fan, especially of their earlier work up to Volume 4 and also ""Sabotage"". They do play at least one track from the latter. Some of the music is great and the camera seems to love to focus on the drummer, who is good, but he's not Bill Ward. And too many times the camera moves away when I started to really enjoy watching Tony Iommi do a guitar solo, as if to hide some of his trade secrets. Also why couldn't they have included one or 2 ballads like ""I'm going through Changes"" or something to change up the mood just a bit? It's as if they were worried we would lose interest but instead I found it a bit too monotenous the way they presented this here. However the music almost all sounds great and it is well recorded sonically. It would have been nice to hear at least one Dio track sung by Ozzie with some type of dedication to the man.",1396396800,,867,4.105882352941176

5994910,2,B00FKIB3XA,"...that's what i kept thinking I was seeing. As someone who has heard the old recordings of Black Sabbath w Ozzy, or even heard Ozzy w his solo band in his prime, I found Ozzy's performance on most songs of this concert unbearably wooden and teleprompter dependent. I believe he would have given us a more lively and intimate performance if he was capable - but sadly I believe he just isn't capable of that any longer, if that is any consolation - it seems the drugs and booze have finally caught up w him - he seems to be trying to rock out unsuccessfully with a leaden blanket of dementia and booze and drug haze weighing him down. I witnessed the same thing on his tour in support of his Scream album, and I think we all saw signs of this in his Rock N Roll Hall Of Fame peformance w Metallica, and in his reality TV show episodes. The romantic allure of the fact that he is 'still out there working' just doesn't outweigh the fact that he looks and sounds awkward doing it at this point in time. And it is 90% his own doing if you read his own biography (i.e. rampant drink and drug excesses).
And to only tease 'Symptom of the Universe' instrumentally and then cut into another song... oh what a let down right there.
I choose to instead, remember how he sounded on 'Sabotage' and at least how we managed to perform on 'Speak of the devil'.",1395792000,2,1346,4.2823529411764705

Of course, Bill Ward will always be missed, but the drummer in this concert (and the drummer who recorded the album) don't compromise.

5994945,5,B00FKIB3XA,"Having attended this concert tour last year I was anxious to have it in my collection as an archive of one of my earliest musical influences of my pre-teen years. With the original lineup, sans drummer Bill Ward, this disk captures Sabbath in all their glory with mostly their best deep-cut songs as well as their hits from the early years and a handful of tunes off the latest album, 13. Despite having recently (from all appearances) beaten cancer I am not sure Iommi's guitar sound and riffs are not even more epic now than when they were originally conceived. While Ozzy seems a bit physically frail, and mostly tied to his teleprompter screen of lyrics, his voice sounds amazing, on pitch and containing much of the original eeriness that made Sabbath Sabbath! The concert I attended Ozzy was off pitch a bit on his singing so I was really hoping the DVD did not also contain that fault, which it didn't. Not sure if they fixed it in the mastering or if Ozzy was just better prepared or in better shape when they recorded this. Geezer is in fine shape as well laying down the low end and replacement drummer Brad Wilk brings drumming to the forefront with a long, acrobatic drum solo in the middle. It is incredible to see these guys having fun and still laying down the music that is considered the birth of heavy metal. The sound and video quality of this disk is fantastic being Blu-Ray. When tied to a nice amplifier and speakers and a large screen TV it is the next best thing to being there. My only complaint, and it's with all live concert videos nowadays not just this one, but there seems to be a requirement to continually switch the camera view about ever 3-5 secs and not stay focused on one member for long like in the old days on concert videos. It seems they think viewers have ADD and need a continual changing of the view which irritates me to no end. When the guitarist launches into a solo you get the first 3 secs then they switch to the crowd or to the bass player or some other view. Damnit I want to see the f'ing guitar solo completely not the crowd's reaction to it! Focus on the person that is playing the lead role at the time then switch views when they are done. I wish there was some sort of setting in the DVD where you could specify which member to focus on the most or even have a split screen to show multiple members at once. Being a guitar player I want to see Iommi mostly. How cool it would be to be able to set user preferences like that.

If you are a Sabbath fan go buy this disk. You won't be disappointed. I'm looking forward to their next album release.",1389139200,3,2603,4.334016393442623
5994946,5,B00FKIB3XA,"I saw BLACK SABBATH live- twice (late 70's and mid 80's) they were loud and proud.
Now some 40 years later, they reunite and tour behind a decent new release.
I was all set to drive 80 miles and attend this tour, but I would rather sit in my living
room with the music playing loud and clear and hang out with my cat, then go mix in
with some of America's greatest burn-outs and a bad sound system.",1389052800,2,398,4.050632911392405

5994953,3,B00FKIB3XA,"I'm very picky....so keep that in mind if you're reading the review.

I saw Sabbath twice on their last tour, one in Irvine and one in LA and both show were absolutely amazing. Needless to say that I'm very much looking forward for the live album of the tour to come out.

Let's keep this short, the performance, sound, and picture is stunning...which should be a good enough reason for anyone to buy it. However...I bought the deluxe box from sabbath website....when I had to spend almost $70 for the album....I was hoping to get the full concert in their correct order. Obviously, I know what I'm gonna get with the deluxe box before I bought it.

I feel a bit cheated because they kept ""Under The Sun"" off of the regular dvd release. The one song (other than the new ones) that wasn't on ""Reunion"" album.

The extra content felt...well...cheaply made. Here's a quick breakdown:
 - Booklet: the same cheap shiny, glossy, sticky, easily bent paper use on ""13"" album packaging.
 - Show poster: Pretty nice to have for those who haven't bought the show poster sold at the show.
 - Picks and ticket: sure....nice to have...
 - Setlist: I still don't understand why they have to print the 'altered' setlist...basically the dvd running order...not the real setlist  from those shows....

The bonus interview was fun to watch though, Tony Ozz and Geez seems to be enjoying each other company very much and Jim Norton is a good interviewer.

The cd still comes with 10 songs and not the whole show. This, to me, is disrespectful. THE WHOLE SHOW! I'm hoping they will release the Birmingham concert in the future.....THE WHOLE SHOW!!!

I don't know who made these lame  (lame as in...I'm gonna squeeze as much profit as possible out of these fans) decisions on putting this box set together....but it's easier to blame Sharon...so I'm gonna blame her even though I have nothing against her.",1387584000,7,1883,4.7217125382263
5994954,5,B00FKIB3XA,"Even as other reviewers posted there's just three of them left. The drummer's seat is now occupied by Tommy Clufetos (used to drum for Ted Nugent among others) and good 'ol Rick's son, Adam Wakeman, who's credited as guest keyboardist although I couldn't spot him throughout the nearly 110' gig.

Maybe the band members are not conveying the impression of being on fire anymore as in the early days, but they shure put out a hell of show. Clufetos doesn't try to sound like himself, matter of fact if I had closed my eyes I could have sworn it was Bill Ward  !!! Except on the unbelievably long drum solo (FFS; do they still play those ??!!)

Editing is very old school, which I loved. Picture is sharp and clear. Terrific lighting that doesn't interfere with the filming at last; a rare ocurrence nowadays.

Picture is excellent for a standard dvd, averaging almost 8.5 Mb/sec, and I highlight the fact because nowadays most labels put a terrific Blu-Ray release and at the same time an incredibly poor SD DVD to make those of us who haven't yet made the jump to HD.

Sound : loud and clear LPCM and 5.1 streams with a great mix except perhaps for the drums which, if of incredible presence, are tuned very low, which made my sub -that is crossed at 100 Hz for punch- produce very deep bass but not the punch I had expected. Anyway, I think this was made purposefully to achieve a more stoner, detuned sound, and get better and better as the show progresses. Iommi's guitar, if a bit echoey coutesy of the acoustics of the particular venue, is on top of if all as every metal band should feature. I loved Ozzy's voice, which was too good to be true courtesy of Pro Tools in the post production. I'll take a good-sounding doctored DVD over a raw, bad sounding one, because concert dvd are products that EMULATE live concerts I enjoy at home like a good bourbon.

At the risk of sounding clichd, this is a must-have dvd together with the Never Say Die and maybe the Cross Purposes dvd, if you enjoy the Tony Martin era.",1387411200,2,2018,4.455284552845528
5994955,4,B00FKIB3XA,"My thoughts on the new Black Sabbath DVD ""Gathered in Their Masses"". The Facts: Bill Ward is NOT included. 4 new songs from ""13"" ARE included. All songs are recorded one half step lower than on ""The Last Supper"". There are no stupid interview interruptions during the concert footage.

  Now, what I think: Whether you know it or not, virtually all recorded material is enhanced or repaired in some way. Ozzy sounds good on this, DO NOT listen to the live clips from this tour on YouTube, just sad. On the DVD the ""fill in"" drummer does not overpower the songs with modern drumming technique, again DO NOT watch the live clips. (actually Tommy does a nice drum solo, even if it is almost identical to what Vinnie Appice always plays).

  This concert is not as ""playfull"" as Last Supper, not surprisingly - that was almost 15 years ago & Tony is fighting for his life. The tempo's are slower and feel like they are quantized or on a click track, but that makes this pretty tight from an arrangement standpoint. The sound, video, & editing are very, very good. Actually ""looks"" a lot like the Last Supper.

  Overall, I love this DVD & am glad I bought it. I can already tell that this is one that will get watched many times & not just sit on the shelf. And by the way, the new songs sound great & fit right in - actually sound more modern - but all Sabbath.",1386979200,14,1358,4.357142857142857
5994956,4,B00FKIB3XA,"I know there are a ton of folks out there still chanting ""No Bill Ward,No Sabbath!"",BUT,I'm sorry ,the drummer they had touring w/ them on this show is pretty amazing (I'm a drummer myself,so I'm extremely opinionated about drumming) I don't even know WHO this guy is honestly! All I know is,he can definitely beat the skins like a champ-something that Bill Ward in NO WAY could pull off at his age/in his shape. In his prime? YES.Now? NO WAY.I've seen Sabbath a couple times,and each time,what bothered me-was the drumming. EVERYTHING was slowed down (I feel so Bill could keep up) I feel as though this drummer lit a fire under their asses,and it shows. Ozzy actually sounds pretty decent-I only wished he could still sing slightly higher so they could actually play THE WHOLE song of Sabbath Bloody Sabbath-but oh well. Tony Iommi?Geezer still shred of course as well. All in all,its a pretty solid concert set w/ new and old material. It could always be longer and include more songs,but that goes for just about every concert IMO.",1386892800,2,1035,4.723756906077348

I mean, this people should make the most of the night with more quality material, specially the Blu-ray edition. Black Sabbath always rocks and Ozzy always shows that he's a great frontman as usual(even though sometimes he sounds out of tune between songs).
If you liked the last Black Sabbath's CD ''13'', this release brings 3 great songs from the album: ''LONER'', ''END OF THE BEGINNING'' & ''GOD IS DEAD?'' which are performed with the same energy that Sabbath does it since the 70's.
I recommend this DVD only if you want to increase you collection but I don't consider it as a ''you-must-have-it'' record.",1386288000,2,951,5.025316455696203

Audio/video quality is good, & the editing isn't too frenetic. I wish the show was longer than the 105 minutes(Amazon says 190min.??). I've done some hard partying to these guys.
Having said that, if you're mostly into Iommi & Butler, you should check out Heaven & Hell, with Ronnie James Dio instead of Ozzy.  Let's face it, to be honest Ronnie could sing(& run) circles around Ozzy.(RIP Ronnie). Their Radio City Music Hall blu-ray is a solid 5 star effort.

5994964,4,B00FKIB3XA,"I'm a massive early Sabbath fan and admittedly biased when it comes to their music. And it pains me to share my critique here. To be clear what I take issue with is the way this live concert was produced. I don't think it is necessary to change cameras literally every 4 seconds throughout a two hour show. Also, I found the Melbourne crowed to be seemingly dis-engaged - I suspect that has a lot to do with the setting (Rod Laver) arena which might just not be the most conducive location for a Rock Show. Other than that, musically, as always, Sabbath delivered. The DVD, despite my criticism is a must-have.

5994971,3,B00FKIB3XA,"I have all the live releases from Sabbath (with Ozzy) the best being from Paris in 1970, before they even had proper lyrics for most of Paranoid. That was just the best show on the planet, period. All young, in their primes, no drugs, no alcohol. Just young, naive and making killer music. The main reason I ordered this (got it in the mail this morning) was to just have/add it to my collection. I pretty much knew what to expect seeing clips here and their on youtube, and the tease trailer. No it's not spectacular, in fact it's pretty well, mundane, and average. It's good to see Ozzy and Tony both in good health, I know Ozzy takes meds for his (various diseases) so watching him isn't nearly as exciting as it use to be. God bless Tony for fighting off his cancer, hope it stays that way.

The songs are tuned low, so classics like War Pigs, Paranoid, Children Of The Grave etc. sound ok, but different, as most bands do with age. Unfortunately I know Ozzy could hit the highs in most songs because he did it on 13. Also when he yells ""your the ##$## greatest, we love you all, or just hey hey hey"" you can hear that he hasn't lost his voice. It's like he won't try to sing high or in key, to save his voice. Strange I guess. The songs are very tight, yet again these guys are all in their mid 60's, so don't expect it to be like the Never Say Die DVD or anything close. It's just a nice farewell to the masters/godfathers of heavy metal as we know it today. And not really a terrible one. 3 stars for it's good, and it is. Very watchable, and cool to see that after over 40 years these guys can still do it, especially after the extreme lifestyles they all lead at one point. Also they are doing a new album set to release in late 2014 (tentatively). So that will be their last supper, last tour and bye bye Sabbath. Lets just hope they can get Bill down off of his soap box to participate, or hope he's ""in shape"" to do the last album. That would be awesome.

So kudos to the mighty Black Sabbath, this isn't something you'll watch probably more than twice, but you can add it to your collection just to say 10 years from now, hey these guys still did it. And did it pretty well. Then go back to the 70's and watch how it was REALLY done.

Good sound quality, excellent picture, camera work is just fine, as I said it just lacks the energy it needs. Not just from the stage presence, but from the songs being tuned down. That's it in a nut shell. NOTE-The new songs sound better than the old, which is what you would expect.",1385337600,22,2532,4.184426229508197
5994972,5,B00FKIB3XA,"Full disclosure right away, I love Black Sabbath.  Every album, every singer, every lineup....I honestly love it all.  If that makes me biased, so be it.  I still want quality product.  I'm really happy they decided to document and release a DVD capturing what might be their last tour, and even if it's not, you know they aren't going to be able to keep it up forever, what with Tony's health and Ozzy's...well, Ozzy's stage issues, which I'll get to in a minute.  But the first thing to note about this show is that Tony and Geezer are as incredible as ever.  It heartens me to see those guys onstage having a great time, visibly enjoying sharing the stage with Ozzy and playing the best songs from their catalog, plus a few new tracks.

As for Ozzy, editing has done him wonders.  Like many fans, I've seen quite a bit of Youtube footage of this tour, and while fan-filmed Youtube videos can't exactly be hailed for their pristine sound quality, it was obvious that Ozzy did not sound much like the Ozzy of yesterday during this tour.  His voice frequently cracked, he had trouble finding the right key on most nights.  And he now does that troubling thing onstage where he sings a verse or two, then takes two or three steps away from the mic, then seems to remember that he can't go far from the mic stand, and rushes right back.  It's not like he does this every now and then; he does it on every song throughout every show.  With the magic of editing, however, all you really see in this footage are those rare moments when Ozzy actually runs around the stage a little bit and interacts with the fans or with Tony.  Of course, his vocals have also been cleaned up so that he sounds at least listenable, but seriously...check some of those Youtube clips if you really want to understand how much work was done to improve the vocal quality.  I've been a huge fan of Ozzy for three decades, and I give the guy a pass as old as he is now and as much as he's abused his body all of these years, and given his status as one of heavy metal's all-time greatest legends.  But maybe, with his stage presence and skills so diminished from what they used to be, it might be time for Sabbath to pack it in and stay off the road.  Selfishly, I would still love another new album, as ""13"" was easily my favorite release of 2013, but it wouldn't hurt me too bad if this was Sabbath's last trek.  They've contributed more than any band to the development and perpetuation of heavy music, and it amazes me that they continue to do it 43 years after the release of their debut album.

Concert highlights for me include the new songs, ""Loner"", ""Methademic"", ""The End of the Beginning"", and ""God Is Dead?""  I would've loved to also hear ""The Age of Reason"", which has been one of the fan favorites off ""13"" and one they started playing regularly as the tour went on.  It's great to see them feel confident enough in the new material to give it its place in the show instead of relying on all the old standbys.  Of course, all those songs are played, too, but I like the freshness of including some new songs.  On the old stuff, sure we've heard Iron Man and Paranoid about a billion times each, but those songs are timeless and crowds never tire of them.  I have to admit that if I went to a Sabbath show and they didn't play those songs, I'd be disappointed.  As much as I'd love to hear some old chestnuts, like say ""After Forever"" or ""A National Acrobat"", they can't ignore songs that have become iconic not just in their musical genre, but in pop culture itself.  Sabbath are truly legends in their own time, and I can't imagine a more fantastic 2013 than to have not one, but two new Black Sabbath releases to add to my collection.",1385251200,108,3722,4.3594202898550725

I watched part of this dvd online before I bought it and even though the band seemed to be playing great, Ozzy kind of ruins it with his talking and demanding the crowd be into it during the best parts.
It really bothered me when the band was playing ""Into The Void"" and he can't just shut his mouth and let the music breathe, so that is why I'm only giving it 3 stars, Ozzy kind of ruins it for me with all that obnoxious blabbing during parts where there are no vocals.",1521072000,,747,4.047297297297297
