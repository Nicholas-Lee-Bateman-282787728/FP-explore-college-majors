5346220,2,B009L63QIM,"""The Last Fall"" could have been a good film, but it falls short in two major categories, the lead actor Lance Gross is not a strong dramatic lead, and the storyline is predictable, especially with the way the film concludes. The film shows that Lance Gross has a lot of shortcomings when it comes to pulling off truly poignant and impactful sceens that need to pull the audiences into the film and make them invested in the characters. A stronger and more resonant lead actor would have given them film a valiant and more noble push beyond the normal realm of mediocre sports dramas.",1359590400,,583,4.615384615384615

If you are searching for an uplifting movies without a lot of violence or cursing (brief love scene)...you'll enjoy this film.  I watched with my husband...I'm not into football but we did discuss some of the points about football's player image & pay...interesting how easily it is to assume how others are living the ""big"" life.  I enjoyed the cast...Lance Gross played his part well...as well, as the rest of the cast! Good to see a loving Black parents & family on one hand. On the other hand the efforts made to strive to start showing the love felt in a family. Good to see positivity and balance in a quote unquote ""Black movie"" this is a movie that can be enjoy by all races if given a chance.",1509753600,,850,4.697986577181208
