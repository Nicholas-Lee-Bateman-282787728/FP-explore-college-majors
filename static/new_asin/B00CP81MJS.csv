8584419,4,B00CP81MJS,"I've always enjoyed foreign films, not least because they tend to offer a very refreshing perspective that's free from many of the typical Hollywood biases.  In 2008's ""The Kabuli Kid"", the story of taxi driver Khaled provides a window for exploring post-war capital of Afghanistan.  The premise is a simple one: a taxi driver finds himself with a faceless passenger with a blue burka and a small infant.  Only when picking up his next fare does Khaled discover that the woman has left her baby behind in his taxi, and he now finds himself with the very stiff challenge of reuniting the six month old baby with its mother, as well as caring for it in the mean time.  The story that follows will sustain your interest, but perhaps more importantly will give you a  glimpse at life in a city and culture unfamiliar to many of us.  And that makes a trip with taxi driver Khaled well worth taking. - GODLY GADFLY",1438646400,2,908,4.539877300613497
