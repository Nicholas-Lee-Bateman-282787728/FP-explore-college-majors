8061598,5,B0009IRKG0,Artie and Happy Traum have been teaching for many years and this DVD shows off Happy's skills. this is a keeper,1417046400,,111,4.333333333333333
8061599,2,B0009IRKG0,"I was not willing to tune my guitar down a whole step just to be able to play along with the video. There was no mention of the altered tuning until after the video had started and I knew that if I had done so I would be struggling to keep the instrument in tune. However keeping an instrument tuned was clearly not a lesson being taught by this video as his guitar was quite out of tune and getting worse with every song.  I finally had to turn it off and take it back to the library.

I had hoped that the video would be about techniques that are unique to the 12 string guitar but it turned out to be mostly playing songs on a 12 string guitar.",1348617600,7,647,3.9692307692307693
8061600,3,B0009IRKG0,I felt I knew more than this guitar player.  I am 58 and have been playing guitar since 10.  I also majored in music in college. He did not show me anything I already knew.,1285545600,3,172,3.8857142857142857
8061601,5,B0009IRKG0,"I bought myself a 12-string Taylor in London
and I found this Dvd very useful with a lot of tips about tuning and playing",1272499200,3,121,4.083333333333333
8061602,4,B0009IRKG0,Happy does his usual excellent job of presenting music in an easy to understand format.  He uses some interesting tunes and material to express the uniqueness of the 12 string.  I had a lot of fun with this dvd.  Highly recommend it to anyone new to the 12 string or someone wanting to expand his/her knowledge of this cool instrument.,1158710400,15,335,4.55
