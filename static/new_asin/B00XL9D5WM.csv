7170817,3,B00XL9D5WM,"A gay themed drama with an unhappy ending.  Not really a gay romance.  More about a married gay man, Jules, having an affair with his much younger brother-in-law, David.  Jules, unknowingly, transmits HIV to David and when all this comes out, all hell breaks out.  Unfortunately, all 3 major characters fall out horribly over what has transpired.  Basically the characters are decent people who have made bad decisions and now all 3 have HIV.  Well acted, but such a downer!!!",1485302400,12,476,4.8875

8716225,3,B00XL9D5WM,"The director couldn't seem to decide if this production is supposed to be a movie or an MTV video.  The music (complete with vocals) is so loud in places that it practically drowns out the conversation.  I knocked off a star just for that.  I finally enabled the subtitles, which is an odd thing to have to do for an English-language movie.  If I'd had spent more than $3 for the rental, I would have felt cheated.

That aside, the movie kept my interest.  This is certainly not a gay rom-com and the plot is unique, although one of the plot twists was telegraphed in advance when, instead, it should have just come out of the blue.  Despite the outcome for the three main characters (one that David seems to feel guilty about even though he's a victim, too), it ends on a hopeful note.",1532304000,,786,4.379310344827586
