8366950,5,B002E7KIN6,"BARRICADE is an underrated Western that deserves more notice, both by specialists in the history of the genre, as well as by general film historians. Released in 1950, with Dane Clark actually billed in the starring role, the film seems to get lost in discussions of Westerns. Yet, despite its shorter length (75 minutes) and its lack of a ""major"" Western star, it is a fascinating cinematic outing that repays re-watching and comment. Curiously, it is the film's second tier actors, Ruth Roman and Raymond Massey, who command more attention and are much better known to current audiences; and they do not disappoint.

Warner Brothers invested some time and good production values in BARRICADE. The Technicolor print provided in this issue is crisp and sharp; the outdoor shots are panoramic and enticing. While much of the action takes place in a confining mining camp, it is the very fact that the actors feel so confined, the almost claustrophobic atmosphere, that concentrates our attention on characterization and some larger issues.

Director Peter Godfrey seems to be asking: what happens to men (and one woman) who become, in fact unwillingly, confined, as it were, almost imprisoned, in a specific space, attached to specific and physically-destructive work? A man (Massey) who apparently could not succeed in a wider, more ""public"" world, takes command and creates his own little empire: how does this assumption of power in such circumstances affect him and those around him? And how does his role then affect those collected now under his authority?

Godfrey and his characters explore these questions, certainly not in a path breaking or earth shaking way---other films have done that---but still in a fascinating way for a 1950s Western, that some writers have considered ""just another oater.""

There is more here, more to ponder, more to consider....and, of course, it is a Western, released with fine production values, good acting, and some degree of characterization (especially Massey).

So BARRICADE deserves high marks, and renewed consideration, not only by fans of the Western genre, but by those interested in the role of film in conveying reactions and emotions in very difficult situations.
