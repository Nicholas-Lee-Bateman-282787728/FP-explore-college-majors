3425010,1,B00198IWKW,This was a poor product. I didn't even play. I would not buy another one from them. The seller is burning them himself and there not working.,1292976000,5,141,4.2592592592592595

8272520,5,B00198IWKW,Bought for my nephew (he's blind). He requested this audio product and you had the best price.,1474761600,,94,4.588235294117647
8272521,1,B00198IWKW,Should have looked more carefully at the write up as I was expecting a CD with the shows on it.  Tried to use it on a CD player and discovered it is a DVD.  Why would any one load audio files for sale on a DVD (doesn't the title DVD have something  to do with VIDEO?)  Useless piece of plastic now.,1406764800,2,298,3.8360655737704916
8272522,2,B00198IWKW,"This is a DVD and will only play on a DVD player, it would have been much more flexible if it had the files as mp3, I wouldn't buy it again....",1406160000,,143,3.6451612903225805
8272523,1,B00198IWKW,This disc is a waste of money. These public domain broadcasts are available for free all over the internet with better sound quality than this. The decision to make this a DVD rather than an audio CD was also stupid. You will find it virtually impossible to get these episodes to an iPod or other player. Even ImToo DVD Audio Ripper could not make the audio available. Better to get these via podcast.,1375833600,4,401,4.506849315068493
8272524,5,B00198IWKW,To any lover of science fiction in either book or film form these audio stories from post-WWII radio are simply terrific. Buy and listen to these for hour upon hour of enjoyment! (But beware of distractions!: remember this is radio; and depending on the tech level of how you are listening to this you may not be able to rewind just to hear something again; you might have to start the story over at the beginning. You have been warned!!),1370649600,4,438,4.4875
8272525,3,B00198IWKW,This program was made towards the end of Old Time Radio and at a time when TV was on it raise to the main media and radio was dying.  But the quality of the writing and stories was super.  Even today slip it into your CD/MP3 Player and let you mind wander in to the domain of science fiction.  Warning if you purchase this on the Audio DVD you will have to translate it though your computer on to CD's.  Some MP3 players will play this but your best bet is to look for Audio CD's.,1365292800,6,480,3.96875
8272526,5,B00198IWKW,"Those of us that recall the 1950s know that the best SF special effects available were the ones you imagined in your head listening to the radio - this series adapted classic SF stories from the best magazines in tjhe field and took you along in a kind of guided meditation - you young'uns that weren't around for radio drama shoulkd really give it a try --

8272527,3,B00198IWKW,"I really needed this to be able to go with me.  If it had been in  the mp3 it would be much better.  I don't really have time to sit at the entertainment center and spin this disc in the dvd player to enjoy these shows.
They do sound good and the menus are great.  Maybe I will someday figure out a way to use these -as I continue to morph into a nerd.  But for now its a dust collector.  And again - I'm glad to have them...",1331942400,4,425,3.7191011235955056
