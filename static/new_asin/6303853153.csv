7853750,5,6303853153,"With respect, the previous reviewer has totally misunderstood the point of this movie.  It is not to be a shoot-em-up action flick but to portray the human dimensions of this robbery.  The movie succeeds brilliantly in demonstrating how this robbery destroys the personal relationships between the various ensemble characters.  The scene at the end where Jimmy (John Mahoney, one of the most underrated character actors) is alone in the bar, with only his memories of his friends (now all gone), is quite possibly the most touching closing finale of any movie I've ever seen, whether on the silver or the small screen.",1212192000,4,618,5.03921568627451
7853751,1,6303853153,"After seeing Goodfellas you should see this movie, it goes into depth the events leading up to the Luftansia heist.  The movie is told by ""Jimmy Burke"". This movie was drawn out and some of the facts in the movie  seemed to be out of touch with other books and movies about the  heist(Goodfellas, Wiseguy, The Heist).  I would say watch it but I would  warn you that you will be disappointed.  The actually Heist scene was  awesome but that scene only lasted 20 minuets. The rest of the movie was to  be kind, boring. I am happy that the Luftansia heist was finally put on  video to bad it was mad into such a poor movie.",947116800,,621,4.239316239316239
