8387026,3,B0031KQNV6,"i find that most films of this genre can be so heavy handed with the preaching that it gets in the way of not only the story, but the message, its intent and the intent of the people who produced it. despite the less than top drawer production values the actors are quite good, given their seemingly minimal experience, and the story is believable and solid. as i mentioned, stories like this one can so much of the time be so steeped in the production's message and rhetoric that it blinds you to what they are trying to say. i did not find that so with Gang Girl.this film, for me, was not like that.

i don't know if they will reach many young girls and help to turn them around, but i guess if they can save just a few lost souls then it was worth the time and effort. for someone who has no idea what life for people is like who grow up in these types of american neighborhoods, they need to watch this film too. for when we are all made aware of our brother's problems that our society fosters, will we all begin down the path to correcting these societal ills. BTW: i am not a christian and i am usually quite turned off by the method of their message (not the message).",1269820800,3,1177,4.162280701754386
8387027,3,B0031KQNV6,"This movie is ok...I always like movies that show the reality of low income people  in our country. This film definitely presents us the real drama gang girls from the Bronx face, how some die trying to survive and a very few find a way out.
