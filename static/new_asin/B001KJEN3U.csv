3665759,5,B001KJEN3U,"If you are reading this, you have happened upon a real gem of a movie. It has everything: action, romance, deep thought and feeling, spiritual wisdom, and especially the joy of learning of one's own divinity. This film is bound to be a classic. It is the first film of a new genre, that of the ""Spiritual Adventure,"" a forerunner of many such films that will be making their appearance in years to come.",1227657600,,403,4.45945945945946

Jsu Garcia's riveting portrayal of Everyman Finn bares his soul, reveals his truth, you forget he's acting, journey with him to the unknown then discover that unknown is you. It changed my life."" - Laura Mola

SPIRITUAL WARRIORS' Jsu Garcia's quest for answers to the big philosophical questions: 'Why are we here?', 'How do we evolve?', 'Is it our destiny to destroy?', passionately challenges us to contemplate our existence and the nature of our beingness. 'Are we the writers, producers and actors of our own scripts?. These questions that provoke the true meaning of life and are sorely needed in today's world. - Hector Elizondo",1226188800,6,745,4.866141732283465
3665762,5,B001KJEN3U,"THe movie, ""Spiritual Warriors"" is a magically entertaining thrill ride!!!  I've seen it several times and enjoyed each viewing more than the last.  Spiritual Warriors is a story about one man's evolution into becoming a Spiritual Warrior, which we all can do for ourselves.  It is genuinely instructional without trying to be so, multi layered, deeply moving and takes the viewer on a journey that I've found to be life altering and profoundly empowering.

3665763,5,B001KJEN3U,"This film showed me many aspects of myself and the multi dimensions of each human consciousness. From the darkness into the light it was a journey of SELF discovery. I connected to something that seemed much larger than myself, its hard to put into words the experience. This film has screened in London several times and each time the cinema was packed.
I was amazed how people were drawn to see it. Check it out for yourself.",1226102400,,427,4.558441558441558

3665766,5,B001KJEN3U,I really liked SPIRITUAL WARRIOR.  They accurately portray how a person can experience their past lives and receive spiritual guidance in a real and natural way.  Jsu's character did a good job of actually showing how a person's personality goes from being egocentric and ignorant to being guided by a higher power and spirit.  Anytime a movie demonstrates a spiritual connection it's worth watching.  BRAVO!  Thanks for creating a conscious movie for mass consumption...,1267574400,2,471,5.3108108108108105
3665767,4,B001KJEN3U,"I found the film 'Spiritual Warriors' very inspiring; it brings home the fact that we have the opportunity to understand the meaning of our lives, our relationships, etc., if only we would open ourselves up to see the signs and messages that are continually  put before us. Once we take the first few steps we will then be on the path to spiritual enlightenment.",1257379200,2,362,4.65625
3665768,2,B001KJEN3U,"I loved the book 'spiritual warrior' by John Roger, but it's not a story, so I was curious how the movie would turn out. Well, badly. The book is just straight forward psychologically sound advice about how to live your life. The movie amateurishly filmed and unconvincing. And yes, it's fiction.

The start of the movie is boring. I read fragments of the book while glancing at the screen now and then. Then it becomes unbelievable. Then it picks up steam and gets decent. Still, I spent the last 10 minutes of the movie searching online for reviews, instead of watching the end. Tells you something, doesn't it? Weirdly enough: it's hard to find reviews even though google suggest knows the movie well enough to give you several suggestions. My guess is: it's probably because the movie is just so bad.

For most of the movie you think that this poor drug dealing guy Finn just gets lucky finding a spiritual teacher who lives in a mansion and helps him find his focus. The drug dealer who has him in a strangle hold dies off at the right moment, making it relatively easy for Finn to leave that life. Especially as the old spiritual teacher gets him to move in. There's a girlfriend who dies just as Finn realizes he loves her. There's a trip to Egypt where Finn gets initiated into the ancient mysteries. There's a scene where Finn fights the devil which is reminiscent of star wars. If at the end you're still watching, you find out that most of the movie was apparently a dream. And the only thing that's real is the therapist/devil with whom Finn has been talking.

The thing is: it doesn't hold together somehow. It just doesn't. And that's coming from someone who believes in reincarnation (big theme in the first half of the movie), initiations, astral travel etc.

I gave the movie two stars instead of one because if you do have the patience to sit through the first half, the second half did get me involved more. And let's face it, I did watch it till the end.",1252800000,13,1974,4.5210084033613445
3665769,1,B001KJEN3U,"Maybe this book was good, but by the first hour I was more than ready to turn this off (and I did so)! It was a waste of 25 dollars and I have no idea how 59 people (proably all readers of the book whom have not seen the terrible movie yet) rated this at 5 stars.
The main character lacked serious acting talent and does the co-star. The camera shifts perceptions with no warning; like they cannot make up their mind to stay at present or flashback to ancient Egypt.  The story started out with Jsu garcia running from the police. He's also in trouble with Mob Money. He stays between some garbage cans while LAPD swarms all around the area.  When he wakes up some older guy basically tells him he has to change his ways...all this within the confusion leads him to present day egypt with the same ole gritty man (whom extends an offer to take him to Egypt).  This movie is terrible. I will put mine up for 5.00 as soon as possible. Please, spend your time watching something entertaining.",1251158400,5,989,4.335135135135135
3665770,5,B001KJEN3U,"As a reader of John-Roger's book with the same name,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spiritual-Warrior-The-Art-of-Spiritual-Living/dp/1893020487/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spiritual Warrior: The Art of Spiritual Living</a>, I found this film very inspirational. For me, the film summarizes very well our path in this life. It shows the main power we always have: choice. Despite any circumstances, we are free to choose and take action towards the direction we want. That is our ultimate freedom, and the baseline of our proactivity and success.

3665772,5,B001KJEN3U,"Spiritual Warriors is an excellent movie, especially for those that have a guru or spiritual guide in the flesh, as John Roger is. The movie shows the relationship between a guide and the seeker who finds truth because of the guide and because of soul searching. It shows, we must work with our own spirit in the process of becoming one with our past present and future eternities.",1247011200,2,381,4.617647058823529
3665773,5,B001KJEN3U,"Yes, I enjoyed the movie very much. In fact, my husband and I have already watched it several times. It wasn't what we expected, however. We had recently watched the movie ""The Secret"" and thought your movie was similar or perhaps an extension of the information we received through ""The Secret"". Because yours was fiction, it fell short of our expections... but it was entertaining. Thank you for creating this enjoyable film.

3665775,1,B001KJEN3U,Total rip off ! This has nothing to do with spiritually. It's a .59 cent movie. I guess if i were 10 or 12 years old again it might be ok. The trailer and reviews lead one to believe this would be a outstanding spiritually and up lifting movie. It was so boring i had to watch it in 3 sections ( or hang myself ). People turning from man to woman than into a creature & zooming off into the sky. Believe me --- rent before you buy. Jim !,1237075200,3,437,3.8131868131868134
3665776,5,B001KJEN3U,"Spiritual Warriors reminded me of the Sumerian story ""The Epic of Gilgamesh"".  Within each of us exists the ability on our lifes path to do ""good"" or ""evil"".  We either ""heal"" or ""destroy"" ourselves and society.  It is a choice that we make and our lives are but a series of choices.  Sometimes we wonder why we make certain choices, or you may see in another the repetition of choices leading to the same outcome and wonder why change is hard.  This could be due to the fact of past lives and past decisions that we seem doomed to repeat.  This movie makes us aware of our past lives and their effect on our present life.  It challenges/invites you to examine yourself and your choices and ""think"" about your current life and the ""path/choices"" that you make.  Change, whether personal or societal, is hard or easy.  It's your choice.",1235952000,,835,4.550335570469799
3665777,5,B001KJEN3U,I went to see the screening of Spiritual Warriors in New York City and just had to purchase the DVD for future viewings. Of course as a bonus I got to meet Jsu Garcia too. His performance was outstanding and the movie provoked much internal reflection.,1233273600,,252,4.5

3665782,4,B001KJEN3U,"I don't watch a lot of movies, mainly because they feel so empty and formulaic --  most Hollywood movies are a form of mental porn. That said, the test of a good movie for me is, ""Am I still thinking about it a week later?"" And Spiritual Warriors definitely passes that test.

The characters are sympathetic, the production values are good, and the interweaving of past-life scenes really worked on a deep level. And John-Roger's message of self-acceptance and life acceptance is powerful medicine.",1232323200,,498,4.916666666666667
3665783,5,B001KJEN3U,"When I watch the Spiritual Warriors movie, while I am seeing with my eyes and listening with my ears, I am experiencing the movie inside of myself on many different levels and in many extraordinary ways. This film continues to be an awakening. I am moved to a deeper inner understanding of ""who"" I truly am and how important it is to pay attention to all of the opportunities and possibilities that are presented to me in my life. I am moved to an insistence to look to expanding outside of my ""comfort zone"" when I check out what is calling me forward and the information is clear. I love this film. I encourage all to see it. I've watched it many times.",1231459200,2,655,4.333333333333333
3665784,4,B001KJEN3U,"You might well ask, is this film going down the tired old road of ""dualism"" and ""Good God vs. Bad God,"" etc. Or is this film just picking up on a trend that started with ""Peaceful Warrior""? No on both counts -- the teachings underlying each film come from the same line of teachings, and God isn't a matter of controversy here. The teachings are not new: They are old wine in new bottles. So why do a film about ""Spiritual Warriors""? Who are they -- latter day Knights Templar? Are we back into a ""Da Vinci Code"" scenario? Why should anyone want to see a film about spiritual warriors vs. ""Rambo"" with all its action or ""The Forbidden Kingdom"" with all its magic?

""Spirtual Warriors"" is no ""Da Vinci Code,"" although we do see a sword here and there and even a Templar-like knight in one scene. This is also not just a smaller, independent film. By the end of this film, the viewer has been genuinely challenged to consider a higher context for their life that is informed by ordinary life experience in the world but leads well above and beyond it. The film's writers, director, and producers steer clear of endorsing a particular religious or cult affiliation. Instead, they appeal to anyone who is willing to expand their awareness and embrace the calling of the Light of the Spirit and transcend the dominance of the world of the senses. Above all, and for any good film, ""Spiritual Warriors"" aims to tell a compelling story.

We humans love a good story, and over the past decade, some genuinely interesting spiritual stories have come forward. There were the ""Celestine Prophecy"" and ""Peaceful Warrior"" films from the books that inspired them. There were ""What the Bleep...?"" and its follow-on, based on widely collected interviews. Recently, I watched ""Milarepa - the Movie,"" done beautifully by a Tibetan Buddhist monk who was both writer and filmmaker. In some cases, as with ""Celestine,"" the book did more for me, beautiful though the film appeared. In the case of ""Milarepa,"" seeing a recreation of him, his time, and his place was stunningly rich, though his written or spoken story always uplifts me. The genre of spiritual films even has an online society (Spiritual Cinema Circle) that offers films for rent, much the way NetFlicks offers more general release films.

In the case of ""Spiritual Warriors,"" the challenge for the filmmakers was not to adapt a written story to the screen. They needed to wrap a cogent story around a book of teachings called ""Spiritual Warrior"" and make it something that would appeal to what is essential in a wide range of people who are looking into or walking a spiritual path in this world. And they succeeded in doing just that.

The protangonist, Finn (Jsu Garcia), is an endearing, if not annoying, Hollywood acting student, who has for his ""day job"" the iffy role of bag man for a small-time crime boss in Los Angeles. This is not a guy we would easily call ""spiritual."" The film opens with Finn in flight through a local neighborhood, after the LAPD has foiled his drop. In keeping with the timeless notion that ""when a student is ready, the teacher appears,"" Finn stumbles on to the property of his teacher-to-be, Roger (Robert Easton), who occupies a lovely white elephant of a house in an old, formerly posh LA neighborhood. From an ordinary, seedy, low-down meeting with a remarkable man, Finn begins his journey to tame his rogue ego and re-identify with and express from his inner greatness -- something all of us have in common. In some odd way, Finn's journey is our journey.

You will enjoy tagging along with Finn, not just for his lovely girl friend (Shyla Cruize) or his cranky acting coach (Howard Fine) or some top-tier actresses (Leigh Taylor-Young and Sally Kirkland) or his teacher's endearing range of expression, or the film's willingness to consider that ""the Devil comes dressed as a gentleman"" or as a foxy lady. You will enjoy even more opening up to all the possibilities this film points to. Despite its ""Ray Harryhausen-like"" special effects at times, Spiritual Warrior's aim is true. The sword of the warrior is the truth of the spritual heart, and by the end of this film, which is really another beginning, something very empowering happens to the viewer along with the hero, and that is well worth a ticket, rental, or purchase. Don't miss this one.",1231459200,2,4334,4.757978723404255
3665785,5,B001KJEN3U,"The first time I saw this movie I experienced a deep inner transformation I can't articulate what it was but the feeling inside me after watching the fim was expansive and uplifting.  I felt an inner freedom and was very interested in visiting the Peace Awareness gardens where parts of the movie was filmed. I went to the Meditation Gardens shortly after seeing the movie, I received a free book when I was there, Journey of a Soul, the book was very resonant as was the movie.

The central character, Finn, symbolizes the ""everyman"" walking this earth looking for greater purpose and what he finds along the way is truly remarkable. Finn encourages us all to take up the mantle of the Spiritual Warrior in our own lives so that we may live more from our center, our truth and our loving heart beyond anything this world has to offer. The movie drives home the concept that the focus of committing to the best of who we are takes constant vigilence and that it is up to us to choose the life we want for ourselves.

3665793,5,B001KJEN3U,"Spiritual Warriors takes a courageous look at all aspects of our Spirit by showing the internal and external struggles of a troubled actor, Finn (Jsu Garcia) trying to make it in Hollywood.  Throughout the movie Finn meets with an elderly man, Roger (Robert Easton), who helps Finn learn how to awaken to the insights of his soul.

  From a cinematography perspective, this is no easy task.  But, the filmmakers boldly use stunning visuals and exquisite special effects to demonstrate such ideas as the transcendence of the soul, past lives, destiny, light versus darkness, and spiritual awakening.  Using words to accurately describe these concepts is difficult enough.  However, the movie successfully uses remarkable images to capture the essence behind these deeper realities. Additionally, since the film primarily takes place in Los Angeles, there is enough subtle humor and contemporary examples of everyday life to provide a fun, exciting and relatable context to examine some of life's most important questions.

  The cinematography provokes the viewer to ask their own questions as opposed to the dialogue simply giving answers.  For example, the movie asks what role darkness and evil play in our own spiritual quest.  What impact do our past lives have on our current relationships and circumstances?  How much of our destiny is predetermined?

  My favorite message from the movie is that when we begin to view life from the perspective of our soul, our life and eventually our destiny take on a much more fulfilling meaning.  This is echoed in the beginning scene, when the following quote is flashed on the screen,

  ""Spiritual Warriors are people who confidently make choices about where to focus their internal attention, even when the external realities of their everyday lives are chaotic, troublesome or just plain annoying.""",1228867200,,1847,5.260273972602739

3665804,5,B001KJEN3U,"This a thought provoking drama questioning faith and loyalty. Stunningly shot, I'm guessing somewhere in the middle east- desert shots that are breathtaking. Loved Robert Easton and Jesus Garcia- truly inspired performances.
Well worth owning!",1228780800,,243,5.9714285714285715
3665805,4,B001KJEN3U,This is another reminder of the importance of going within to search for your own answers to the universal key questions. Who am I?; what am I here for?; what is the purpose of life?. The film in itself has achieved to trigger this self reflection in me each time I had seen it. And every time I watched it I focused on something different. So I am not going to comment on the film quality since I am not a film making expert nor I understand what makes a good performance to be rated good. So I will only say that this film allows me to connect with my heart and continue searching for my own answers.,1228780800,,602,4.110169491525424
3665806,4,B001KJEN3U,"The first time I saw the movie, ""Spirtual Warriors"", I traveled nearly 3000 miles from North Carolina to a screening in Beverly Hills, California. I had never been so compelled to attend an event until my spirit guided me through an online friendship of sorts with actor/producer, Jsu Garcia who's passion and dedication for this movie and the inspiration behind it is heart wrenching.  I subsequently attended two other screenings in New York City, and New Jersey, for the experience and yes, to see the movie presented by all the people who spent so much time, and love in making and promoting this for others to learn more about spiritual transcendence. What a beautiful and unique contribution, well-acted with a lot of real talent and raw emotion.  It's a part of my heart.",1228694400,,778,4.842105263157895
3665807,5,B001KJEN3U,"Spiritual Warriors is a journey of self-discovery that anyone can relate to. The storyline is universal and after seeing a few times I'm convinced this is a transportation system to higher consciousness.

3665808,5,B001KJEN3U,"This movie has the power to transform the way you see life.  I have been to showings of the movie including Q&A's with the producers and actors.  I have seen the movie stir people inside and alter their view of life, death, spirituality and relationships.  Whether you like this movie or not, it will get you to think about your core beliefs and views.  This independent film attempts the monumental undertaking of showing the inner experiences of those on a spiritual path in a visual medium.  It does this in a way that I have never seen done before in film, and does it very well.  I highly recommend this to anyone who is on a spiritual path, interested in mysticism or the occult, or would just like to see a movie that will blow your mind.",1228694400,,745,4.401459854014599
3665809,5,B001KJEN3U,"I saw this movie on the big screen in October 2007.  Since then I have been waiting to get the DVD. There were scenes in the movie that almost jolted me out of my seat.  Images that came back to question me.  I loved the honesty of the character.  The movie was honest and true. I loved the interraction of Finn with his spiritual teacher, the whirlwind sum-up at the end.  I loved the images of horses, despite the violence.  Kudos to Jsu Garcia, what a bright new film-maker.  I look forward to more like this!  Heather Brown, Toronto Canada",1228694400,,543,4.36
3665810,5,B001KJEN3U,"Spirtual Warriors is a film that is deep, intense and true. I truely enjoyed watching it, as did the rest of my family. I wish there were more film makers out there doing these kinds of films. The message I recieved from this film will stay with me for a long time. I loved the locations they filmed. Beautiful!!!",1228262400,,313,4.322033898305085
3665811,5,B001KJEN3U,This movie is a journey.  It is a magical journey that takes me to different places every time I see it.  I think everyone should see this film!,1228262400,,144,4.107142857142857
3665812,3,B001KJEN3U,"I was going to order this DVD today to showcase at a Spiritual Center. However, after going through each and every review I am troubled. I feel that these reviews were all written with the soul purpuse to boost sales by people somehow involved in the making of the film. So here is the problem. Is this a good film that many could benifit from. Or a cheating attempt to receive a high rating to boost sales? I have made the mistake before by taking the reviews at face value and wasted my money. So I learned to look deeper at the reviews to see if they are legit or not. I have great concerns for the reviews for your product. I am sure you know why. For me Twenty five dollars is not cheap. Like I said, I have great concerns. Do I take a chance? Spend $25 and dare to show your film to a group at the Spiritual Center? Or look for another film that has legitimate customer reviews, that I feel the group will enjoy? So how did these reviews come about? How can I be sure that your product is what it says it is? Why is it that all the reviews are 5 stars and that the Only product any of these people reviewed was this One and Only product???",1228176000,3,1145,4.070796460176991

8315058,3,B001KJEN3U,"The concept is great, and I was looking forward to seeing the film.  Fortunately for me, I only paid for a video-on-demand rental.  The execution of the movie--the dialog, the directing, the acting--was, unfortunately, not up to the film's potential.  Sort of like daytime soap opera, made tragic by the fact that it had wonderful locations and was trying to convey a great message.  Too bad.",1281225600,,392,4.893939393939394
8315059,1,B001KJEN3U,"Afer looking at all the review's saying that this was a great movie, I went ahead a purchased it. I was excited to get it and watch it. Let's just say that after the first 5-8 minutes or so my mouth dropped open.  Im sorry to say not in awe or amazement  but in major shock. I kept thinking watch some more it has to get better, but no. I spent my time watching this all the way through and Im sorry I did. The information and ideas that were ment to come across are lost in the bad acting and script. I really can't think of a positive thing to say about it.  It seemed to me that the main charcter (Jsu Garcia) was using this as a platform to get him into some major movies. He was unbelieveable and trite to the point of just plain bad.  Dont waste your time or money on this one. The ending is the worst and a major let down.",1278374400,4,829,3.9166666666666665
8315060,5,B001KJEN3U,"I've purchased the film, Spiritual Warriors about a year ago and have watched it maybe 7 or so times now. What amazes me is that each time I watch it again, it seems to open me up to another level of insight into my own life's journey and my relationships---including my relationship with my Spiritual teacher-- and the life lessons they represent for me. This film has become an inner journey meditative tool for me. I recommend it for all those who like myself, enjoy a good Spiritual adventure that will put them in a mellow reflective reverie. I loved the scenes, the special effects, and the fast paced scenes---it was never boring and always visually captivating. Loved it! Thanks for making it. Jsu is an awesomely convincing actor and ---ladies easy on the eyes as well. Ashtar-Athena Sheran",1268524800,,799,4.755395683453237
8315061,5,B001KJEN3U,"This movie is a great journey into the ""Perennial Philosophy"", giving much needed messages of our reason for being, as human beings.
I would ignore the quality of the special effects, apparently not everyone counts with a Peter Jackson-like budget, as the story is gripping and a powerful metaphor for the Spiritual Journey",1267660800,,323,5.113207547169812
8315062,5,B001KJEN3U,"Loved this movie! I don't often see great entertainment that has a spiritual message. I felt blessed by the experience and I recommend it to anyone looking for ""more"" in a movie experience.",1267660800,,189,4.757575757575758
8315063,4,B001KJEN3U,"I saw this movie in LA when it premiered back in 2008, and went home after and had the most powerful and vivid dreams. I woke up the next morning and was changed. I felt like I had received a light initiation and, like the lead character from the movie, I had become awakened. In my life, it certainly sticks out as one of the more profound experiences. I recall the movie, but it was how it effected me that was what made it significant.

I enjoy movies that have the ability to transform and that are more than just entertainment, and this movie totally delivered. It is more than a movie, it is a message, a very powerful and important message, that is ripe in this day and age.

I recently saw the movie again in London, and was struck once again with the powerful of its message. I was also fortunate enough to catch the Q and A afterwards with the makers of the film, and was humbled to be in a room talking openly about very sacred spiritual matters.

This movie is great entertainment and for those looking for answers to some of life's grat questions, I highly recommend it. And if you can catch up with the film makers and their live Q and A's do it. They are an awesome bunch of people.",1267660800,3,1197,4.241228070175438
8315064,5,B001KJEN3U,"Spiritual Warriors is a movie I can watch over and over again while finding something new, enlightening, and uplifting every time.  I'm not inclined to watch a lot of movies, so the fact that this one has such amazing presence and a clear message of loving, upliftment, and growth-promoting lessons speaks very highly of the filmmakers.",1267574400,2,336,5.0
8315065,5,B001KJEN3U,"I've had enough esoteric experiences in my life to know that this world is so much more than the physical reality of which most people are aware.  To me this movie is sort of like another favorite, ""What the Bleep Do We Know?"", but told as an interesting adventure in awareness through the main character, so believably played by Jsu Garcia.
