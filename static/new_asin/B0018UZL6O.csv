8278258,5,B0018UZL6O,"I saw this movie approximately 2 - 3 years ago -- it played in a small theater for only 3 days -- and I very much enjoyed Damian Chapa's work as an actor and a director.

I spent a long time on-line hoping to find a copy and was unlucky, until I finally found this import from the Netherlands.  I ordered it and received it promptly; I played it and was very satisfied with me purchase.

Thanx.....
