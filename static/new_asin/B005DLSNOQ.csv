8467213,4,B005DLSNOQ,I already have another Balletone workout  that I liked and knew that this would be good too.  I found I liked this one as well because it gives you a good work out and Shannon walks you through all the steps slowly at first before quickening the pace. I like how she mixes yoga workouts with the ballet workouts.,1395619200,4,312,4.271186440677966
