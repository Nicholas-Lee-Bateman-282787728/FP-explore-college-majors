8175508,1,B000N7SA6Q,"I thought it was a dvd of the PBS concert.  It was not.
The individual artists were interviewed and only snippets of the music is performed. It wa $27.  Too much for what was only similar to the added features on an actual concert DVD which I often purchase. Also, did not receive an  invoice,so I don''t know how to return it.",1510704000,,327,4.241935483870968

8175515,1,B000N7SA6Q,Like everyone else who bought this DVD I thought it was going to be good. One of the phrases used was garbage! absolutely - and the CD which I bought as well - 5 songs mp3 and nothing new.  Just repeat  performance songs.  I used to like him but not  anymore.  I don't think he has composed or come up with anything new for years. These songs are repeats.  Waste of my $25.00 - for the 2 CD's.,1443052800,2,393,3.9743589743589745
