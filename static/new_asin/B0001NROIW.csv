8015346,4,B0001NROIW,"My husband picked this movie up at a resale shop for our 2.5 year old daughter who loves her videos.  We get sick of seeing Clifford and Arthur over and over and over!  The animation is very simplistic and admittedly has nothing to do with Wonderland, but the stories and the execution are very cute and engaging. All of the Madeline stories are referenced if not completely told, and it also includes The Frowning Prince and the story of Princess Lenore who demands to have the moon for herself.  The stories all have good messages where it is the children who come up with the best solutions in the end.

If you have a small child and can find this movie, I highly recommend it!

(the cover of our dvd looks different, like the mislabeled ""Alive in Paris"" listing here on Amazon, but it is the same movie.)",1221264000,4,808,4.4324324324324325
8015347,1,B0001NROIW,It was a strange movie... Not really my taste... I'm kinda collecting Alice in wonderland movies but this movie has very little to do with Alice In Wonderland... Actually it has more to do with Madeline... The animation is from the 60's so its very crude... Its also a very short movie... and Its very random. Actually It didn't keep my interest for very long. And Im normally entertained by the most simple things... The lip sync is WAY off during the middle of the movie.. It actually confused me for a while...,1216857600,2,513,4.526881720430108
