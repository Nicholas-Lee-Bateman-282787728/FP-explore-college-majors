2516306,5,B000EDH80I,"In a time ware Americans don't know good story's if it bit them on the backside, and most entertainment leave out morals Casshern helps to fill the void.
at first it looks like a cruddy B movie (and trust me it DOES HAHA) at first glance. but the more you watch the movie the more you realize that the cruddy B rank production values were done on purpose to make the world as gritty, polluted, ugly and undesirable at possible.  The world that the character's live in is not a desirable one...nor ideal, war has left the earth permanently scared. the essence of the movie is about the cycle of hatred and war (you hurt me so i hurt you....your not me so im not you ect ect.) and that eventually mankind will eventually destroy themselves...
in short this movie is and anti war movie that explores mankind's never ending lust for death.  watch it if you wish to learn something, watch the movie plz!! (end of review...spoilers and philosophical talk ahead!) don't let seemly pore visuals fool you!!!!!

""i really thought i should talk about this""
 the ending really gets to you (WARNING SPOILERS BELOW)
at the end you watch all the characters in a time ware they were all happy and enjoyed each other and there life's
the ending really gets me because they were all once happy and never once thought of killing.....now there all dead due to hatred and revenge. and that is what this movie is really about!!!",1436659200,,1406,4.545454545454546
2516307,4,B000EDH80I,"Casshern is a weird movie I'll begin by saying that. Those who know Japanese media know this was many things before being a movie, it was a live action power rangers type show and then an animation. When this came to be a live action movie I think many fans expected something odd, like the series, and they weren't wrong. Yet this in terms of any live action adaptation is done so well with only a few flaws that keep it from a perfect score. Story wise Casshern is about a normal young man who lives in an advanced future world. Being a solider the young man is killed within the first few minutes of the film but by some freak accident involving a chemical oddity, him and others are brought back to life albeit with odd super strength, Casshern will end up using a suit to keep his powers in check and he must use that controlled power to stop an evil uprising from another revived human before its too late. Now that me explaining the story in super similar terms but Casshern isn't a simple movie by any imagination. There is a weird meta game that exists in this story, what is real, what is considered human, are we becoming a society of evil because of our technological advancements? These questions and more are in Casshern and while many are handled wonderfully, especially the humanity concepts, the other parts are occasionally overly complex to the point that many will see the end and shake their head in confusion. Visually Casshern has a unique style that screams action/anime. It never looks bad and it screams originality. Sound wise is also great with some fight scenes having beautiful tracks. Overall though Casshern is a must see for those who love Japanese action movies with visual art. Note this is only Japanese with English subs so no awful dub, thank god. Pick this up for one hell of a ride.",1434499200,,1822,4.541033434650456

For me, this was a did, I didn't even feel the need to finish it. I read all these reviews praising it so I bought it without knowing much about it. The four, Detective Dee, The Sorcerer and the White Snake, all better movies by far. If your looking for Japanese movie specific, The Returner is far better.",1431388800,,605,4.45945945945946

2516317,2,B000EDH80I,"There is a lot of hype around this movie by those I would consider to be japanophiles.  (those who consider anything from Japan to be superior to anything domestic... wherever domestic happens to be for you).  I bought this based on that hype and recommendation.  This, from my understanding was not meant to be a schlocky movie.  The premise sounds fun but the implementation is just poor.  Casshern really does only play a very minor role in the film with more care given to attempting to display emotion via over-acting than is given to the actual development of the characters.

I am sure many who worship this film will be upset.  The reality is, their opinion matters just as much as mine.  If you're a japanophile, you'll love this movie by default.  If you're an anime fan for no other reason than ""it's anime"" then you will also love this movie.  If you can get past the not so great way the story is presented... the movie is good.

2516329,5,B000EDH80I,"This 2004 film touched on some modern hi-tech themes with an epic solemnity, spectacularly painted in a surrealistic steampunk style which evokes a darkly nostalgic feel.

It depicts a world of Dystopia full of evils : warfares, pollutions, radiations, diseases, terrorisms, massacres, kidnappings, human experimentations, and other atrocities. The earth leaders are corrupted and obsessed with extending their aging lives by all means of sacrificing other lives. Scientists with well-intentions are being exploited for their selfish ends, leading to destructive consequences to all by unforseen circumstances.

First, there is mysterious Lightning Power from outerspace which regenerates the slaughtered humans into some powerful neo-sapiens, who are feared and hunted by the ruling humans, fueling a raging determination of a few of these remnant mutants to eliminate all mankind.

Then a dead soldier is also brought back to life by his scientist father against his own will, in the same pool powered by the Lightning. Thinking a neo-sapien has hijacked his mother, the soldier fights him and his robot army but failing to destroy them all. Eventually, this soldier calls himself Casshern, the guardian spirit of humanity, and fights the ruling army also to save those original humans branded as terrorists banished in an irradiated zone.

Adding to the twists and turns of the story, Casshern himself was once a member of this army who fought and slaughtered these original humans in the officially condemned zone. In the end he further finds out he has previously shot the wife of the mutant leader whom he thought was a hijacker, who was in fact a victim of those massacres for body parts and experiments. But this leader of the neo-sapiens does not realize that he was very much part of the human race which he is trying to exterminate, due to memory loss, and refuses to regard himself as human to the very end, consumed with hatred.

Still more tragically, as Casshern trys to prevent his father from bringing his dead mother back to life, his father shoots his fiancee dead thinking Casshern might join his father's resurrection act. In a burst of rage, however, Casshern kills his father instead. When his fiancee unexpectedly comes back to life by the hotly tainted blood of the dead neo-sapien, Casshern vows to end these vicious cycles of violence with her alone forever. Then they are exploded during their kiss when mystic lights gather upon them, which form a beam travelling up to outerspace far far away, landing finally on a distant planet without life.

The flashback videos of these once-ordinary persons at the film's ending stand in stark constrast to their latter selves that have turned dark and violent. It is a disturbing thought concerning the banality of evils that could contaminate anyone, as seen in the history of brutal violence documented in the Nazi Europe and Communist Russia - people hurting others routinely and ruthlessly, many simply following orders without questioning - and their legacies are abundantly alluded in the film.

There is some touching music here like hymn and chanting, soft piano, and the closing theme song, which was written and sung by Utada, the  wife of the director at that time. Translated as "" When someone's wish comes true "", it laments about the anguish of love and its haunting, selfish side. Also at the ending credits is a tribute to the famous actor Mihashi who played the old doctor at the irradiated zone, who passed away in 2004.

It is easier to watch the film in lighter colors or black & white, which looks like a classic of its kind - a visually stunning film laden with symbolism that demands one's sober thinkings to see the depth of its many somber meanings.",1370476800,,3744,5.0161030595813205

His son, Tetsuya, is killed in Zone 7 during the fighting. Dr. Azuma uses his research to save Tetsuya. In addition to reviving Tetsuya, Dr. Azuma has accidentally unleashed an army of super humans from Zone 7. They escape and kidnap Dr. Azuma's Wife and Tetsuya's fiancee, Luna. Tetsuya, with his new body armor, and super human strength, goes to rescue them. He must fight off legions of Zone 7 robots and super humans to rescue them.

I rented this film b/c I loved the Casshern Robot Hunter and Cassern Sins anime series'. This movei disappointed me. It has some very good CG, and a dark gothic atmosphere. The acting is average, but the fight scenes are terrible. The soundtrack is also pretty mediocre. I noticed that the soundtrack was recycled from several different animes that I've seen, Bleach just to name one. I really wanted to like this movie, but the fight scenes were done so badly that I just couldn't. There is no way that I would recommend that anyone buy this. I realize that some will probably like it more and less that I did. I think it's best to rent this one before you buy. If you like it, go ahead and buy it.

2516337,1,B000EDH80I,"I want to start my product review by making it very clear that Casshern, the 2004 live action Japanese film is one of my favorite films. It's absolutely brilliant. Needless to say, that is not why I am rating this product one star. I'll get to that, but first allow me to explain something to people who are not familiar with this film but may be interested in it because they are fans of the Casshan anime franchise. If you are expecting a live action adaptation of the anime, you WILL be disappointed. Casshern is a creative re-imagining of the Casshan anime universe and story, which is probably for the better considering the source material. I mean, do I even need to bring up Speed Racer?

Anyway, this is why the product is getting a one star rating. As many others have mentioned... this is a re-cut version of the original Japanese film. According to Wikipedia;

""The DVD received an official Region 1 Release on October 16, 2007. The US release is a full 24 minutes shorter than the original. It features both a Dolby Digital 5.1 and Dolby Digital stereo Japanese soundtrack, as well as English subtitles. The subtitles are almost universally criticized by fans for being enormously incomplete. On several occasions they are lacking entirely; when they do appear they often completely differ from the dialogue or oversimplify it to such a degree that key plot elements and the overall force of the story are diminished. This is a common practice for foreign movies in Japan, though, and is done purposefully by studios to localize the film for the target audience.""

Long story short, it is an abomination. For one, they cut entire major plot points from the story. Events that better explain what is going on in the plot. They don't make up for it down the road, they just leave it out altogether. Second, the translation is horrendous. Not only mistranslated, but the subtitles are poorly timed with the dialogue and entire lines of dialog are missing subtitles. *SPOILER ALERT* The ending of the film, which is the best part due to the fantastic music and the profound message was botched beyond belief. Casshern's whole monologue at the end which ends with, ""Hope; our legacy."" is left out for some reason. The scene where Luna is revived in Burai's blood;  her dialogue as she approaches Casshern is completely altered in order to explain with painful obviousness, what is happening, as if a viewer of reasonable intelligence couldn't figure it out on their own by her original dialogue. Instead, they chose to force it down the viewer's throat. It was just horrific. There's clips of real life war footage cut into the montage of war scenes at the end of the original and they cut all of those out in this version for some reason... I guess they think Americans are too sensitive.

IF YOU ARE A FAN OF THIS FILM LOOKING TO OWN A COPY, DO NOT BUY THIS DVD. I REPEAT, DO NOT BUY THIS DVD. YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED.",1351382400,,2928,4.677669902912621
2516338,5,B000EDH80I,"this movie has great visuals, great actors, and a terrific story. it's more of an action romance than a action film.. which is great! if you love Japanese movies than this film is just for you.",1341964800,,193,4.388888888888889
2516339,2,B000EDH80I,"In my experience, most bad movies at least have the common decency of letting you know that it's bad from the get-go.  Casshern was actually interesting for the first half of the movie and showed lots of promise. I wanted to know more about that world and its characters and what happens next.  I was even treated to an awesome battle with tons of robot carnage.  Then it just fell apart.

The original 1970's TV show Casshern was about robots fighting.  They were programmed to protect the earth then (because no one reads Asimov in the future) they determine mankind is earth's greatest threat.  Dr. Azuma turns his son into a human/android hybrid. Robot carnage then ensues.

Instead, in this iteration of Casshern, Tetsuya Azuma absorbs some Neo-Cells and becomes super-human.  And he fights other humans that have become Neo-Sapiens.  Even though there are robots in this movie, none of them are in charge.  They were weapons with as much will as a tank or gun.  Even though I don't think that adaptations have to be 100% faithful every detail of the source material, they should at least conform to the spirit of it.  The plot became very inconsistent near the end and violated its our internal rules.  While it was not as bad as Superman lifting a Kryptonite island with a Kryptonite shiv in his back, it was still fairly bad.  It tried really hard to be enlightening and deep, but came off as boring grinding the movie to a halt.  The ending was completely unsatisfying and non-sensical.

The dialogue was not particularly inspiring either.  I can't think of a single memorable line in the entire film.  This was made even worse by the poor work on the subtitles.  There was a few times where lines were simply left untranslated.  This is more of the fault of the US publisher, but considering that I do not plan on learning Japanese anytime soon, I will still count it against the movie.

The acting wasn't too bad, but it was not that great either.  The main character, Tetsuya Azuma portrayed by Yusuke Iseya, was actually pretty good.  I can't say as much for the love interest Luna.  She was basically a cardboard cut-out that had to be saved every once in a while.  In the original Casshern, she actually fought alongside the title character.  So, I was a bit disappointed by this portrayal.

The special effect were fairly good and were this movie's strongest point (if any).  It heavily used green screen sets like in 300 and Watchmen.  The hand to hand fights between Casshern and the other Neo-Sapiens were a bit painful to watch at times.  Every time kick or punch was thrown, the screen would go black-and-white showing the black silhouette of the fighter and the white silhouette of their skeletal system.  This may sound cool at first but gets irritating very fast.  While the green screen sets did the job, that styling should best be left to Zack Snyder.

Overall, I cannot recommend this movie at all.  This is the sort of film that would turn me off to subtitled foreign movies.",1328054400,,3004,4.669847328244275

2516343,5,B000EDH80I,"A friend of mine bought this DVD for cheap, found she couldn't keep up with the subtitles or complex plot, so she sent it to me after she'd watched only a few minutes of it.

I'm very grateful to her for making me aware of this DVD! This film is, admittedly, a bit difficult to follow at times as one tries to read the English subtitles as the quick-fire images stream across the screen. In a number of places, instant flashbacks indicate revelations essential to understanding the story. So it's a thinker movie one really has to pay attention to, and maybe you'll need to watch it twice to catch subtle but essential bits you previously missed.

Having said that, even if I didn't understand the plot, I'd have to recommend this film for its breathtaking visuals. The CGI and normal film footage (and god knows what other methods) are blended together beautifully. Scenes of thousands of identical robots marching destructively through a city, world-wide destruction as humans battle robots and humans battle ""neo-humans"". Some sequences are shot in high speed to great effect. One is often reminded of anime special effects, only here they are done realistically. The filtered colors and tints are blindingly beautiful even when they depict scenes of ultimate nightmare and destruction.

All-in-all, this is an incredible film that has an excellent, albeit rather dark, plot. But the viewer is required to concentrate in order to ""get"" the finer points of the story. The final scene is open for personal interpretation in its details, but the overall resolution is pretty clear. I highly recommend this movie for its fantastic visuals and, hey, admit it, it's actually GOOD when a filmmaker forces the viewers to actually pay attention and think as they watch the film.

2516345,4,B000EDH80I,"Japanese version of an apocalyptic thriller mixed with the fantasy of Lord of the Rings, the sci-fi of Terminator, and the literature of Frankenstein and 1984.  Film it all through the Sin City lens and the result is one of the most bizarrely attractive and overreaching films possibly ever made.

Like most Japanese films, the concepts are too diverse and underdeveloped for my biased Western sensibilities.  I admit it.  That said, there is no debating the lack of cohesion in the multiple subplots in this film.  It's all over the map.  Which is the film's major flaw.  Could be fantasy.  Sci-fi.  Epic.  Biblical?  Historical.  Honestly, throw it into any genre and you can make a case for it.

The plot itself is a future rampant with mutation and humanity on its last leg.  A scientist has harnessed a new technology called neo-cells from the purest humans left on earth.  With these neo-cells he can cure disease, reanimate body parts, grow replacement parts, and possibly even cheat death.  Underlying class-warfare and anti-war themes dominate the better portion of the movie, as neo-sapiens (the mutants created by the neo-cells), robots, humans, and those who are even more powerful battle in a stylized Japanese steampunk world for survival.

Easily the most impressive aspect of this ambitious film is the cinematography.  Drawing from multiple disciplines and inspirations, there are stunning sequences that combine modern film techniques with animation as well as manga.  Throw in magnificently diverse CGI, heavy video game influence, an art department trippin' on shrooms, and even a little claymation.  The action reminded me of the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.  On crack.

Repeat viewings are probably required to absorb the rich story and appreciate the multiple subplots, but the bizarre cinematographic blend - similar to the risks taken in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spun/dp/B00005JM23/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spun</a>&nbsp;- are a visual feast that might make it worthwhile.

A friend who was not familiar with the source material watched it with me and really couldn't follow what was going on.  I don't think the film was well written, it's very convoluted.  Also, something about the CG and colors used in the movie made my eyes hurt a little.  Overall, a huge disappointment.

Most of the acting was good, the music was about a 50/50 split for me.  The robot designs were also pretty neat, many of them followed the originals pretty closely.  I wish they had been featured more prominently.

The film goes from super fast anime style action with editing so rapid that you can't even be sure of what you are seeing(complete with speed lines flowing from the fast moving characters) to long meaningless speeches where characters face off verbally in cavernous rooms.  There are robot armies that look as though they were borrowed from the George Pal Puppetoon screwball armies.  The symbol used by the one faction calling themselves ""neo-sapiens"" is a cross between a swastika and a 45 RPM record spindle adapter.  The one army uses Nazi style helmets and uniforms.

Having said that, I did not find it particularly bewildering or difficult to enjoy.

It is a grim story, ultimately, with complex characters. This does not mean there is no action sequences to enjoy - they are there! But the underlying themes of redemption, war's atrocities and the frailties of humanity are the real meat of the film.
Grim, but beautiful in the way life often is. Bittersweet, but still worthwhile.

Lots of things go on in this story, so if it is eye candy you are after, there are better choices. But, if you want some deep themes told in the literary language of another culture AND sword fights and battling robots, this is for you.

High ranking officials in the military look to a hopeless geneticist for a cure, not for the people but for the sake of their own depleting lives.  The geneticist's son joins a meaningless war while a dying mother struggles for her life.  While the geneticist's new cure seems lost, a supernatural phenomenon strikes his lab turning his research into a new threat.  The world's only hope is a war-torn son who inherits the power derived from his father's newly developed research.

It does explain some random stuff, like the robot factory that appears out of nowhere, or who the skeleton on the throne in the robot factory is.

Currently there is a ""director's cut"" of the film available on Amazon and at US retailers that is different from this version as well. I have not seen that one. Sufficed to say, it removes about fifteen minutes of footage.

As for the film itself, it's one of my favorites. I think it may be too symbolic and not literal enough for many American viewers, but if you come into it expecting a story laden with intense visuals, a symbolic story and a few cool action scenes, you will not be disappointed.

I find the biggest complaint from others I know who've seen this film is ""it's confusing"". One needs to realize going in that a lot of what happens in the film is not literally happening. It's often symbolism for messages the director is trying to convey to you. When a giant stone lightning bolt hits the research facility, it isn't literally a giant stone lightning bolt that came out of the sky--it's a symbol. If you can get past that and just take in the film for what it is, I think you'll enjoy it.

2516358,3,B000EDH80I,"Casshern (Kazuaki Kiriya, 2004)

Ever since it came out, I'd been hearing a great deal about Casshern, supposedly the movie that was going to revolutionize Japanese science fiction, with groundbreaking effects and... all that stuff. Yeah, we've heard it before, and it never quite seems to work out that way. For some reason, while the Japanese seem capable of outstripping us in every other genre of film, for such a technologically advanced society, they're oddly incapable of making great science fiction.

Casshern (Blindness' Yusuke Iseya) was once just a normal guy named Tetsuya Azuma. No more. However; now he's an indestructible superhero, created by his father (Lost Paradise's Akira Terao) in order to stop the Shinzo Ningen (""neo-humans""), who were also created by Casshern's father from a mutation in the same process that created Casshern.

The movie is based on a 1973 anime, and that was based on a manga serialized in Terebi. While there have certainly been great films based on manga over the years, the very structure of manga, which is almost always serialized, tends to lead to an episodic feel, and in many cases a repetitive one. Such is the case here; fight scene, emote, fight scene, emote, fight scene, emote... you get the idea. Now, with all that's been said about the effects< I should mention that they are, in fact, top-notch. Problem is, unlike most of the things that distinguish Japanese films from Americans, we're pretty used to top-notch special effects, even in terrible movies (ever see Spielberg's War of the Worlds?). It's not enough to differentiate this from the pack. It's not bad, but in the end, it's nothing special, either. ***",1243814400,,1675,5.017985611510792

Well the first half hour of the movie I was very interested by the plot. Afterwards, it just started going downhill for me, the visuals were nice, but more like a cartoon. Which makes sense since they were trying to get that anime feel, but the delivery was missing something. Since the whole movie is in front of a blue screen, it was a little let down for me. The whole feel of the movie wasn't meshing well, I can't pinpoint what it was exactly. I wasn't connected or really concerned for any of the characters either. So at the end when they were showing the neo's backstories, which should've been a tearjerking moment- I was more just waitng for the movie to end. The final end reminded me of ""The Fountain"", the souls were traveling through the universe, only to become lighting back on earth. Well, I added a star because the overall message of the movie was genuine.

2516364,4,B000EDH80I,"Casshern is a tough movie to review. It's a big movie. A VERY big movie. To start, let's get into some of the tech specs on the DVD itself.

There's several versions out there floating around. The US 'Never Before Seen' Version is not good. It's 20 minutes shorter than the original and has some serious issues with the subtitles not even appearing on the screen, let alone being accurate when they do. It's listed as Uncut or The Director's Cut in some places. But it is neither. I'm not sure if the subtitle issue has subsequently been fixed.  But it is a known problem, even appearing in the Wiki article.

The best region 1 version I've found is the Thai version. It has a great picture transfer, true surround, accurate and well-paced English subtitles, and lots of extras. Now, for the movie itself. . .

The first thing you'll notice is that Casshern is a lot of fun to look at-as long as CGI doesn't bother you. The environments are well-designed and the CGI look is much better than I would have expected on a budget much smaller than what US films get to play with. As well as CGI environments, there are portions of the film that are animated as well as stop-motion, or claymation, animation. But let me offer a warning: Those that have seen the trailer or are expecting a full-on action movie will be sorely disappointed.

The 'mano a mano' fight sequences are few and far between, and when they do pop up they aren't mind-blowing, wire-fu fests a la 'The Matrix'. They are actually slowly paced and play out more like something you'd see at a stage play. Most of the action is of the CGI variety, and the final battle is truly epic. But much of the film revolves around the morality tale on the nature of existence and other such philosophical tenets. The main characters struggle to find their place in the world and strive to make their relationships with those around them work.

The story takes place after a great war in a Japan that resembles a kind of neo-fascist, Final Fantasy-esque, overly industrialized society. Science is God, but politics stand in the way of progress. As is the tendency with asian films, plot details aren't spoon-fed to the audience. Character relationships and motivations often-times have to be ascertained by observing, even if it does tend to get a little frustrating at times.

While the story can get a bit stretched at times, it is enjoyable-and ultimately beautiful. The visuals are quite a treat. My biggest complaint is that it feels if the director may have bitten off more than he could chew. Sometimes it feels like the movie got away from him or that he tried to go a little bigger than budgets or technical constraints would allow.

That aside, this is definitely sci-fi art, not sci-fi action. Those looking for some live-action anime that is more story and character driven should enjoy this flick. Same goes for those that like their sci-fi not wrapped in fast-food tie-ins or toy sales. But if it's the next ""Matrix"" you're looking for (even if some reviewer says it's better than both Matrix sequels combined) you'd be better off skipping this one.",1216339200,,3114,4.659380692167577

There is very little action and the story is a mess...,1199923200,,256,4.468085106382978
2516375,3,B000EDH80I,"When I first saw the trailers for ""Casshern"" I couldn't wait to see it; it looked like the next ""Matrix"", maybe better!

Well, ""Casshern"" is not the next ""Matrix"", but it is a good film nevertheless.

During the first half or so, ""Casshern"" reminds me of a sort of anime ""Sky Captain"", except that film seems to rely more on ingenious conventional film effects as opposed to CGI. (Was I really seeing stop-motion?)

Toward the end of the film, however, I began to think more of ""The Fountain"", another film that achieved a spectacular visual style without CGI. What's more, there are some common themes shared between the two films, specifically the corrupting influence of seeking immortality.

So, while most people were expecting a visually-spectacular action flick, ""Casshern"" tries, mostly successfully, to be a serious film. It delivers many unoriginal observations regarding the depredations of war, and the paradoxes of human nature, but does so with such earnestness that you don't mind if it's just a touch sophomoric. In fact, I appreciated the fact that it lacked the irony that most films nowadays are obliged to have.

Some have commented that the film was hard to follow, perhaps because it is Japanese. I personally felt that it was clear enough, even though there was some imagery I did not understand. (Perhaps there are conventions in this genre' that I am unfamiliar with. For instance, the appearance of flashing geometric symbols was lost on me, as was the giant ""lightning bolt."" In the end, though, it was irrelevant.)

The acting was a little weird. You get a combination of decent film acting interspersed with goofy comic book mugging. Again, I think this comes with the genre.

So, in the end, you get a beautiful film which is a little corny but earnest. The cinematography is fantastic and worth the price of admission.",1199059200,,1849,4.92604501607717
2516376,1,B000EDH80I,"I don't know if you can really understand this type of movie unless you are Japanese.  I usually love foreign flicks and I didn't mind the fact that this film was in subtitles. However, it was just odd.  The fight scenes were cheap and had little depth.  Some of the imagery was OK but so much of it as computer-generated that it looked cheap.  It even ventured into the horror genre a bit with pools of body parts soaked in red fluid and some ""undead"" types.

Overall, I am having a hard time believe I paid to see this movie.  It was a one of those movies where you are thinking - OK, its about to get good and then the moment never comes.  Don't waste your money here.",1198627200,,671,4.155038759689923
2516377,5,B000EDH80I,"_Casshern_ (2004) is an excellent Japanese superhero science fiction film written and directed by Kazuaki Kiriya that deals with some of the profound questions of our time.  The film is in many ways a Japanese version of _Brave New World_ showing the role of the state in war and the role of personal greed in prolonging war and causing death.  The film is set in the Twenty-First century featuring an earth in crisis.  War has long raged between Europa and Asia and eventually this war results in the formation of an Eastern Federation.  Geneticists seek to create a healing mechanism making use of ""Neo-Cells"" which can rejuvenate the human body.  However, in order to do so they must plunder the bodies of those who live in Zone 7, who are deemed to be terrorists.  Dr. Azuma leads the front in the creation of these ""Neo-Cells"" in a mad effort to prolong human life (ultimately prompted by nothing more than old-fashioned human greed).  Despite the warnings of Dr. Azuma, his own son Tetsuya decides to go to war leaving behind his girlfriend Luna and his mother.  However, Tetsuya is tragically killed in battle.  It is at this point that a miracle occurs and a bolt of lightning strikes the tanks holding the ""Neo-Cells"" causing them to recombine to form human beings - known as the ""Neo-Sapiens"".  The humans decide to start hunting down the non-human Neo-Sapiens; however, the Neo-Sapiens have other plans and will make use of Europa's old robot army.  Ironically, Dr. Azuma decides to restore his own son to life by placing him in a vat containing the Neo-Cells, and thus is born Casshern, a warrior superhero and the resurrected form taken on by Tetsuya.  The rest of the film focuses on the conflict between Tetsuya as Casshern and the Neo-Sapiens as well as the palace intrigue surrounding the rulers of the Eastern Federation and the evil corporation sponsoring the geneticists.  Ultimately, this film will bring forth difficult questions such as ""Why must we fight?"" and ""Why is there not peace?"".  The film also touches on the potentially harmful effects that may result from mankind's tampering with nature through genetics.  The moral questions faced by those who seek to prolong life, even if that means depriving others of life, are faced directly in this film.  Questions of war and peace, love and life, and the devastating consequences which result from human greed are profoundly touched upon in this action movie.  As such, I believe this movie is worth watching and despite the fact that it is billed as an action movie, the subtle questions posed by this film cannot be avoided because we face the same sorts of questions in our world today.",1197849600,,2667,4.8392070484581495
2516378,2,B000EDH80I,"""Casshern"" is a beautiful mess.  Unfortunately, Kazuaki Kirya's story is so utterly confusing that it's hard to care about the characters, much less follow who is a neo cell clone and who is a human being.  Akira Terao plays Professor Azuma who discovers the neo cell and proclaims it the salvation from those suffering from numerous diseases such as radiation sickness as a result of the 50-year war between men and a large number of machines that look somewhat like transformers.  [SPOILER ALERT] Yusake Iseya whose voice was in the animae feature ""Tekkonkinkreet"" plays the lead Tetsuya who is brought back to life and put in a great protective suit that is stained with blood for most of the film.  One wonders why he can't do laundry or take a shower.  Kumiko Aso plays his wife Luna whose relationship with her husband is nebulously defined.  Kanako Higuchi as the mother/wife Midori Azuma fares the best.  She gets to lay unconscious on some lovely cobalt blue sheets.  We think we're rooting for the professor until he decides to shoot his daughter-in-law in the head to teach his son a lesson about loss.  The reason Dreamworks picked this up is obviously the great computer generated cinematography that is breathtaking.  However, if you want to look at picture, go to a gallery and check out a painting.  If you want to watch a film, it has to have a coherent story.  This one bounces between the past and future and several sets of characters to the point that it is a joy when the final credits roll.  Yes, cinema critics profound will love this picture, but IMHO it's an overbudgeted mess.  Taxi!",1197158400,,1610,4.724014336917563

2516380,5,B000EDH80I,"Casshern is based on a 1970's Japanese Anime series Shinz Ningen Kyashn (translated as ""Neo-Human Casshern"". This is a futuristic film set in the shadow of The Fifty Year War between Europa and the Eastern Federation (basically Asia). The Eastern Federation has won the war but the after effects of nuclear and chemical fallout has left the region poisoned. They continue to battle what the deem as terrorists, those souls of Zone 7 where the radiation is particularly bad. The film opens with one of the most eye-popping scenes in any sci-fi picture, recounting the events of the war as legions of Europa's massive robots march on the Eastern Federation. If the first five minutes of the film don't have you energized you're probably already dead.

The film is a visual feast for the eyes. A mix of live action, animation, and CGI. The industrialized, mechanized, and grimy city conjures up images of the silent film classic `Metropolis' with its monolithic and imposing architecture and great air ships soaring in the skies. The mix of film styles was very nearly seamless creating a mythological landscape yet painfully rooted in the not-too distant future. With the health of its citizens in rapid decline, the Eastern Federation tries to come up with a means to save its people. Their hope comes from Dr. Asuma, a scientist who develops what he calls ""neo-cells"" which can revitalize the mind and body, curing disease, and healing wounds. The neo-cells can even regenerate body parts. But a sinister faction of the government sees other uses for Dr. Azuma's discovery. An accident or perhaps just an unexpected result of the experiment results in a creation of mutant humans whose bodies piece themselves together from organ farms in the factory.

They are called ""Neo-Sapiens"" and their exposure to the Neo-cells makes them incredibly strong and resilient. They are immediately hunted down and killed by the government. Only a handful survive and escape into the vast wilderness of Zone 7 where they find a surviving fortress of old Europa, it's army of robots and other war machines waiting to be unleashed on an unsuspecting Eastern Federation. Dr. Azuma places his son Tetsuya, who was killed in battle, into the Neo cells, bringing him back to life with fantastic powers. Tetsuya's powers are contained by a special suit of armor developed by Dr. Kozuki, the father of Tetsuya's girlfriend, Luna.

As the Neo-Sapiens leader, Akubon, leads the robots on an assault of the city, Tetsyua soars to the rescue in a dynamic battle that makes Neo's battle against the multitude of Agent Smith's from the Matrix Reloaded look like a Sunday school bible meeting. As Tetsuya literally blasts his way through the giant robots I couldn't help but think that this was perhaps the better superhero-style battle ever put on film. Truly awe-inspiring! However, don't think that Casshern is a mere mind-numbing action film. The movie is heavy with messages of racial tolerance and anti-war sentiments. Even as the Eastern Federation has won the war, they have ultimately doomed their populace.

Editing is a thing I rarely notice or mention but in here it's a vital part of the film. There are quick cut-aways from scenes of violence and war to those of pastoral serenity, giving the viewer a startling contrast. The soundtrack was also dead on the money and evoked a range of emotions from the exhilarating to the morose. Casshern is one of those films that just doesn't look like anything else, at least anything else on film. As note, this is a brand new version of the DVD with a running time of 1 hour and 57 minutes. There was a previous, heavily edited version that ran just 80 minutes. This is a marvelous technical achievement in filmmaking!

REVIEWED BY TIM JANSON",1194566400,,3767,4.9259842519685035
2516381,3,B000EDH80I,"While adapting an epic story of humanity and morality in the hostility of war, Kazuaki Kiriya's Casshern presents the social and political turmoil of a post-apocalyptic world, as well as the ravaging of visual clarity.  What works in the freedom of anime and graphic novels is heavily restricted in the world of live action, and too clearly a conflict of imagery and action steps to the forefront of this creatively flawed endeavor.

A 50-year war has left the planet a devastated and dying world and the Eastern Federation has risen to power in an attempt to restore order, though covert political machinations rapidly work to overthrow its foundation.  Employed by a corrupt military organization, Dr. Kotaro Azuma (Akira Terao) tirelessly works in genetics with the ulterior motive to find a cure for his dying wife, and in the process discovers the revolutionary Neo-Cells and the ability to synthesize living organs.  After a freak accident in Azuma's lab causes the creation of sentient life and the reincarnation of his dead son Tetsuya (Yusuke Iseya),  a new battle begins as the outcast lifeforms (dubbed Neo-Sapiens) wage war on mankind and all hope of survival rests on the shoulders of Tetsuya (renamed Casshern), a post-apocalyptic superhero encased in indestructible armor.

Abandoning conventional narrative and relying solely on the fateful definition of ""Casshern"" in the film's opening text, those who forget the cryptic message will likely be lost to the superhero's paranormal creation.  Replete with mystical reincarnation, afterlife ghosts, mutant zombies, and robot armies, everything presented in Kiriya's film is so fantastical that attempting to understand gives way to simple acceptance that anything can happen in this futuristic world.  Unexplained phenomena becomes commonplace and the visuals accept responsibility for storytelling, which might have been a worthy replacement had the imagery adhered to more recognizable guidelines.

For a film submersed in special effects and computer-generated visuals, the overall look of Casshern is surprisingly jarring and inconsistently ranges from awe-inspiring to distracting.  The environments rapidly and drastically change in appearance from bright greens and blues to reds and even black and white.  Several interior shots are presented in such arresting red and green that it appears to require a pair of 3D glasses to properly view.  Often the still images provide more admirable qualities than the moving ones and the gritty, grainy film treatments intermittently work to create a mood and mask underachieving special effects.  The action sequences (which parallel the progression of video game boss fights) are feverishly complex and contain an infinite supply of quick cuts, spastic editing, and x-ray image splicing.  Rarely does the camera slow down enough for the eye to comprehend, let alone appreciate, any aesthetic arrangement or design, and while the frenetic fights borrow cues from The Matrix, it also makes the sci-fi actioner look like perfectly-paced reality.

Sticking closely to the realm of comic book superheroes, the origins of Casshern are quite creative, if not a little clich, and involve biological reincarnation with the added bonus of an enhanced body and invincible armor.  With such an inspired superhero conception, allowing the villains to partake in this fortunate creation would theoretically provide the perfectly matched antagonist.  But without the accepted divine intervention supporting the protagonist, the Neo-Sapiens inception feels muddied and unrealistic (which is saying something, considering the delicate thread that holds realism together throughout the story).  And if the bizarre adversary development wasn't unbelievable enough, the aimless trek through snow-covered mountains that land the anti-humans upon Europa's not-quite-dormant robot army will certainly hammer the last nail into the coffin of reality.

When science fiction fails in cohesive presentation, it's not necessarily the ideas that are to blame, but rather the method (or shortcomings) of the storytelling.  Fans of this hybrid genre will undoubtedly find many aspects of Casshern to appreciate, and while there is definitely a style to behold (Kiriya's background in music videos both hinders and supports this assertation), connoisseurs of the medium will find copious faults with both visuals and story, though much of the latter may be blamed on the truncation of the US release.

2516382,4,B000EDH80I,"The action in this movie wasn't constant, but when there was action then it was pretty cool. Great effects for the flick. Good use of all the green screen. But to totally appreciate the movie you can't look away from the screen too much because you will miss the real meaning of what is going on. Not your average American movie where there is a clear bad guy and good guy.  The one thing that kills me about Japanese movies/video games is the endings are too long and drawn out for no reason (but to some there might be a real good reason)  Overall, if you are looking for your average martial arts flick look elsewhere.

2516383,1,B000EDH80I,"Going into this film I was extremely open-minded and excited, but was let way down.  Everyone is raving about the visual effects, that weren't amazing.  It is as if the director and efx crew wanted to throw back to the 80's and even then they did a horrible job.

The plot is unobtainable throughout the movie and the scenes jump so much that it is extremely difficult to grasp what is going on.  As for characters, there were too many and I never found myself emotionally attached to any of them.

Casshern himself was completely unbelievable and cannot in anyway be compared to Neo from The Matrix.

The background, visual effects, lack of compelling plot (Frankenstein by the way, just in case you were wondering) and complete loss of character connection with the audience makes this one of the worst films I have ever seen.

I would not recommend this film to anyone I see or meet, not even a bum with a PSP.  Whoever wrote that this film was better than The Matrix needs to go back to film school.

I had to give it one star because that is the way the system works, but this movie does not deserve half a star.

2516390,4,B000EDH80I,"CASSHERN is loosely based on the Japanese anime in the 1970's called ""Casshan Robot fighter"" which was in turn adapted into the live-action TV series. Highly stylized and visually stunning, ""CASSHERN"" gives you that first impression that it is a drag-out robot smashing action film as its trailer suggests. However, there is more to this film than first meets the eye.

Plot synopsis derived from the dvd back cover/slip sleeve:
An alternate world with an alternate history.
The world is divided between two opposing alliances. After fifty years of bitter warfare, the Greater Eastern Federation triumphs over the Europan forces and gains control over the Eurasian continent. However, this is a hollow victory. Years of chemical, biological and nuclear war have ravaged the land; draining its resources and left an exhausted population at the mercy of every pestilence and newly-mutated disease. With the war ravaged world, hope dwindles for humanity's future. Remaining leaders debate over the chances of finding some way to stave off the seemingly-inevitable decline of civilization. One man comes forward with a possible solution. Dr. Azuma is a geneticist who proposes a ""neo-cell"" treatment that can rejuvenate the body and regenerate humankind. He's driven in his studies by a desire to save his beloved wife, Midori, from the ravages of a pollution-caused rare disease. He appeals for funding to the government but the selfish politicians in the Health division rejects his proposals, fearing that the new technology may threaten their entrenched powers.
However, a sinister faction in the powerful military makes an offer to Dr. Azuma to provide the financial support he needs to further his research. When an incident occurs in the lab that sends the Professor's ""neo-cell"" cloning experiment haywire, a race of mutant human beings (Shinzo Ningen or Neo-Sapiens) is unleashed upon the world. Instead of being the savior of mankind, the Professor's miraculous technology looks set to threaten its very existence...
Desperate, the scientist exposes the dead body of his son, Tetsuya to the Neo-cell fluids. Tetsuya, now back from the dead with a new powerful body must become Casshern, to defend the GEF from the rogue ""Neo-Sapiens"" and their killer robots... (WHEW! I'm tired)

The premise of the film is the horror of war. It is basically a 140 minute anti-war movie. Casshern is a hard film to review, when I first saw it, it wasn't very clear what Tetsuya was fighting for. Now, I saw it for the 2nd time privy to this review, and I kind'a like its mythology. As with most anime, the film has its own share of philosophical storytelling; there are a lot of political, emotional, social, philosophical reasons for Tetsuya's struggle. He is very reluctant to fight again, being an ex-soldier. One might think that his goals are simple, that defending man's existence is his main goal. This is a Japanese film, so Tetsuya partly fights for something deep; Love.

There is a lot of content in Casshern. This fact may be good and bad. Perhaps I read too much between the lines, but its impact and message is too strong to ignore. The LAST thing this film is an action film. The film relies on provoking emotional responses from its characters; we see the horrors of war and what needs to be done to change it. The twist is; one MUST fight a war to effect such change.

Ok, I'm rambling. Casshern is a visual and aural feast for PS3/Xbox 360 fan boys. The visuals seem necessary to distract us from all the philosophy and the whole oedipal complex that is played heavily in the film. When Tetsuya starts smashing robots, with his one-on-one duels, the film takes a different tone. So, enough with the analysis! CASSHERN looks simply ASTOUNDING. The set designs, lurid cinematography and the CGI are all packaged in one cool film that is sure to be awe-inspiring. The top-notch eye-candy is sure to satisfy!

I own the region-3 release and I've seen the original region-2 Japanese release which both utilized the same impressive transfer. It is very likely that the U.S. release will look the same. I hope Amazon's specs are incorrect, the runtime amazon says is 80 minutes, the uncut film is 142 minutes.
VIDEO/AUDIO: ANAMORPHIC WIDESCREEN 2.40 RATIO. The picture is very nice and is intentionally enhanced to look almost like a `painting'. Colors are radiant, the contrast is sharp with very solid blacks. The Japanese 5.1 Dolby EX/6.1 DTS-ES is very powerful. English subs are excellent.
Parting thoughts:
Once you get over the fact that this is not an action film, viewers will appreciate the message that Casshern delivers. If you accept this film for what it is, you will be treated to an excellent piece of film-making. Casshern is definitely worth a watch, for CGI fans and even for those who aren't. This film takes its time setting things up so patience and attention is a must!

2516391,3,B000EDH80I,"This movie was downright fantastic for the first 45 minutes. It was beautiful, engrossing, and challenging to the viewer. Unfortunately, it took a massive turn after that, and it really lost its way from there. Like the first poster said, the running time is definitely over two hours, but in this case I think it hurts a lot more than it helps. The plot wears painfully thin after a while, and it distances the viewer more and more from the storyline. It's more or less a big-budget music video after the one-hour mark, offering a delight for the basic senses and not much else.

Despite my disappointment, it's very difficult to overlook how stellar the beginning is, so that makes this film far from worthless. The amazing score is also worth mentioning - it's some of the most moving music I've ever listened to. Sadly, the movie it was written for cannot truly capture it for the full two-plus hours.",1187827200,,905,4.65625

2516393,5,B000EDH80I,"""Casshern"" is a long, live-action Japanese special effects (""tokusatsu"") film with some spectacular CGI. It's also a difficult film because it's based on 20th century history - World War II and its atrocities - set into layers of visual metaphor that can bewilder an American viewer. It's set in the near future, as an endless war between Europe and Asia has nearly wound down, with Asia victorious in a world polluted beyond redemption by industrial waste, military destruction, genocide, ethnic cleansing, and political corruption without parallel. Mutations and disease are out of control, though the seemingly saintly Dr. Azuma is trying to discover a cure, based on cells cultured from a primitive ethnic group that might serve to rejuvenate and heal people's physical wounds. Dr. Azuma's wife, a classically beautiful Japanese woman, is going blind, and Dr. Azuma is hoping to find a cure for her when he is recruited by the military to work for them. At the same time, his son joins the Imperial Army to prove to himself that he is not a coward, and abandons his fiance for war.

The long story that builds from these complex and contradictory motivations leads through disasters and destruction involving all Asia and Europe. Historical depth is developed in prolonged steampunk images and anachronisms (Imperial Army officers use samurai swords; aircraft are sculpted to carry the Leader's face on the forward fuselage; robots make war against dirty and tired foot soldiers). Dr. Azuma is culturing human body parts - legs, arms - in old fashioned vats, but by an unexplained error, these body pieces come together and coalesce into a new, synthetic species, the Neoroids, who escape amidst carnage and machine gun fire. Dr. Azuma's son is killed at the front and returned for a hero's burial, but Dr. Azuma brings him to the rejuvenation vat and the son is reborn as Casshern, the potentially immortal savior of the world.

I mention these details because they are so misleading. For Americans familiar with the tropes of films like Star Wars, it's old hat or so jumbled that it makes no sense. But that's not what ""Casshern"" is about. From the outset, the viewer must understand - and I suspect that Japanese viewers understand it from the very first scene - that there are no good guys in this movie: none at all. None of the plot details, stunningly recreated in CGI, signals any victory: ""Casshern"" is an imagined *documentary* of the collapse of the world, the corrupt and chaotic death of all ideals in mud, filth, criminal stupidity, greed, and war. The body parts, including a vat filled with eyeballs being stirred by an old woman, have been removed from corpses killed by the Army to feed the need for rejuvenated soldiers. The son himself is one such killer, and his rebirth as Casshern signals not the birth of a hero, but the immortal and karmic continuation of his own inescapable crimes. The Neoroids' escape signals not their rebirth in purity, but revenge and hatred, and they become killers as evil as the humans who killed them in the first place and who now hunt them.

So beware of this film: it is not a geek-out festival of disconnected but spectacular CGI images, but instead is a deeply layered morality play about evil and the inescapable retaliation that evil generates. It is very Japanese indeed, and anyone expecting ""Star Wars,"" with its black-and-white morality of Good Guys versus the Evil Empire, will be bewildered and upset. ""Casshern"" is hard to forget, especially the ending. Just don't think that it's mindless entertainment or eye candy. It isn't. Highly recommended.",1185062400,,3617,4.9457236842105265

It's also a difficult film because it's based on 20th century history - World War II and its atrocities - set into layers of visual metaphor that can bewilder an American viewer. It's set in the near future, as an endless war between Europe and Asia has nearly wound down, with Asia victorious in a world polluted beyond redemption by industrial waste, military destruction, genocide, ethnic cleansing, and political corruption without parallel. Mutations and disease are out of control, though the seemingly saintly Dr. Azuma is trying to discover a cure, based on cells cultured from a primitive ethnic group that might serve to rejuvenate and heal people's physical wounds. Dr. Azuma's wife, a classically beautiful Japanese woman, is going blind, and Dr. Azuma is hoping to find a cure for her when he is recruited by the military to work for them. At the same time, his son joins the Imperial Army to prove to himself that he is not a coward, and abandons his fiance for war.

The long story that builds from these complex and contradictory motivations leads through disasters and destruction involving all Asia and Europe. Historical depth is developed in prolonged steampunk images and anachronisms (Imperial Army officers use samurai swords; aircraft are sculpted to carry the Leader's face on the forward fuselage; robots make war against dirty and tired foot soldiers). Dr. Azuma is culturing human body parts - legs, arms - in old fashioned vats, but by an unexplained error, these body pieces come together and coalesce into a new, synthetic species, the Neoroids, who escape amidst carnage and machine gun fire. Dr. Azuma's son is killed at the front and returned for a hero's burial, but Dr. Azuma brings him to the rejuvenation vat and the son is reborn as Casshern, the potentially immortal savior of the world.

I mention these details because they are so misleading. For Americans familiar with the tropes of films like Star Wars, it's old hat or so jumbled that it makes no sense. But that's not what ""Casshern"" is about. From the outset, the viewer must understand - and I suspect that Japanese viewers understand it from the very first scene - that there are no good guys in this movie: none at all. None of the plot details, stunningly recreated in CGI, signals any victory: ""Casshern"" is an imagined *documentary* of the collapse of the world, the corrupt and chaotic death of all ideals in mud, filth, criminal stupidity, greed, and war. The body parts, including a vat filled with eyeballs being stirred by an old woman, have been removed from corpses killed by the Army to feed the need for rejuvenated soldiers. The son himself is one such killer, and his rebirth as Casshern signals not the birth of a hero, but the immortal and karmic continuation of his own inescapable crimes. The Neoroids' escape signals not their rebirth in purity, but revenge and hatred, and they become killers as evil as the humans who killed them in the first place and who now hunt them.

So beware of this film: it is not a geek-out festival of disconnected but spectacular CGI images, but instead is a deeply layered morality play about evil and the inescapable retaliation that evil generates. It is very Japanese indeed, and anyone expecting ""Star Wars,"" with its black-and-white morality of Good Guys versus the Evil Empire, will be bewildered and upset. ""Casshern"" is hard to forget, especially the ending. Just don't think that it's mindless entertainment or eye candy. It isn't. Highly recommended.",1179619200,,3617,4.9457236842105265

The action is really bad too. Very unclear, poorly directed and purposeless. We are supposed to follow this plot, but so little actually happens you'd be better off taking a nap.

The CG is on par with children's television. This movie seems to be directed at an adolecent audience who are strictly into robots that march in sync and flowly futuristic cityscape scenes.

Don't waste your time. I purchased this movie just trying things out. Don't make the same mistake that I did.",1177459200,,755,4.661654135338346
2516400,5,B000EDH80I,"Kazuaki Kiriya, as I understand it, is a popular music video director... I'm not a director/actor fanatic but it's easy to see his willingness to go beyond the borders of conventional thinking.  I've also heard that this was one of the first movies to use a completely blue/green-screen background.  I also think the casting director should get a pat on the back.  What does this mean?

Nothing.  The movie can stand on its own as a great watch.  I love the action, I love the characters, and I love the world it is set in (post-war Eur-Asian).  This movie is visually stunning to say the least (over the top - a little, yes, but it doesn't come with pretense of reality).  There are some heavy anime/manga-like plot themes woven into the story as well as some familiarity to popular video games (Final Fantasy-ish).  It's a movie though... not animation/cartoon.  The story hinges greatly around the idea of ""life"", but it remains fast-paced, action-packed, and emotional.  The emotions are human and easy to relate to.  Characters develop appropriately as the plot twists to the end.

I saw this movie originally some months ago.  The week I got the DVD, I watched it 5 times.  It's a wealth of creativity and enjoyment.  A must own movie... at least it was for me.  I'd recommend it to those looking for a great Saturday night movie, for some creative energy and/or those into anime/manga/fantasy video games.  Your girlfriend may or may not be into this (litmus test: Equilibrium, Advent Children, Ghost in the Shell).  I wouldn't suggest it to those that like to watch their movies while making dinner, while walking in and out of the room and/or those looking to do a change up from their Veronica Mars/Bridget Jones/Pride & Prejudice night.

I watch all my movies on my Vaio laptop (no TV)... I can only imagine how great this would be on a big LCD/Plasma with a great sound system. 5 out of 5 for replay value.  Wish I would have known about it when it was on the big screen.

The bad guys are cliche, anime style fashion victims, complete with overdramatic laughter and loud, obnoxious delivery.  The fighting choreography is basically non-existent, choosing to sacrifice exchange for speed.  I was often left wondering why someone flew across the room; were they even hit?!?  Best of all, it's all held together with paper-thin character and plot development.  I watched 4/5ths of the film, but couldn't justify spending any more time.

Any sort of film buff who knows how to appreciate the dynamics of cinematography and progression of story should already be taken back by this movie. Casshern is a very deep, philosophical and political movie. It's theme goes way beyond good guy versus bad guy (as you'll later learn in the film). You have to watch this movie not in expectance of karate-choppin' action, but for a deep, artistic, dark, and even quirky story about the morality of human beings. This movie is about neutrality, that ""good"" and ""bad"" are just subjective words lazy people use.

Unfortunately, as amazingly intelligent and moving as this film is, it comes off as a dumb action movie through its trailers. Don't get me wrong, the scene in which Casshern hacks up a field of robots is by far the most rewarding piece of CGI action I've ever witnessed, far beyond the likes of The Matrix. But, like I was saying, people see this movie in hopes of lots of action, and there's not too much other than the kick ass robot scene. This is not about action, seriously, this about something much more.

Again, this is the greatest film I have ever seen. It says something about the future of filmaking. You might have to watch a few times in order to completely understand the story and theme, but what great movie doesn't require multiple viewings?

I came across Casshern in the $3 bin at Big Lots and decided to take a chance. I don't have a problem with anime-inspired stories and I love Japanese horror movies including Hideo Nakatas Ring and Takashi Shimizus Ju-on.

I had a tough time following the plot  especially with the rapid-fire pacing that meant subtitles appeared and disappeared so quickly I found myself reading more than wallowing in the lush visuals.

And they are lush. Americans aren't quite acclimated to the look of anime. I can think of only one American director  Ridley Scott  who imbues at least some of his films with a similar attention to visual detail (Blade Runner and Legend). The intermixing of high-power CGI with live action to produce a poetic vision is something Japanese directors expect the audience to accept. In America its CGI made to resemble live action. In Japan its CGI that makes no apologies for itself.

Like many anime-inspired stories Casshern is a bit heavy-handed with the subtext. Running throughout is a not-so-subtle criticism of science, the stifling hand of cultural authority, the loss of environmental sanctity, and the violence to which humanity seems perpetually addicted.

But there were surprises. The role of parents as enforcers of cultural authority, the impotence of love vs. that authority  these are strange notions to a Westernized society that has been taught the individual trumps the collective.

More than likely Casshern is a standard and perhaps cliched statement movie about the triumph of the will  and the hubris of the willful. But if you can get past the convoluted plot, the sometimes unintentionally humorous dialogue (perhaps resulting from a less-than-perfect translation) and the cultural differences that divide East and West, you might enjoy the movie.

What you will enjoy is the look of the movie. Almost every frame produced a sense of awe, masterfully crafted by music video director Kiriya. While some may argue Casshern delivers empty calories, think of all the empty calories in your life, from french fries to text messages.

Mladens take

A confession.

Without Del explaining between sets of kicking my butt in tennis what Casshern was about, Id still be scratching my head.

The plot, as it turns out, is semi-unoriginal.

Corrupt politicians of a militaristic superstate collude with malignant corporation bosses to create a dystopian wonderland of carnage where healthy humans are involuntarily used as tissue donors.

Meanwhile, the leader of a small cell of mutants created by a bolt from the Universe that pierced the occluded sky of Earth and hit a vat of artificially growing human limbs promises to avenge the mistreatment he suffered at the hands of government security forces.

Then, from same vat that birthed the mutants, arises a hero.

And, he shall be called Casshern.

Casshern, with his body armor-integrated George Jetson-like rocket pack and morphing helmet tries his dangedest to keep the superstate and mutants from destroying everything, but fails.

Or something like that.

The convoluted plot of Casshern is tough to follow but the Japanese movie held me captive for no other reason than background details. They were gloriously presented with cinematography resembling a blend of Brazil, Sin City, and the Kill Bills.

In the movie, the society spoke Japanese but wrote in Russian, I think.

Tanks and flying machines are clunky, mechanical beasts as pragmatic and ugly as the imploded society that created them.

The army of robots organized by the mutant leader from leftovers of an earlier conflict march lockstep, their heads adorned with helmets that look like Kraut head gear of World War I.

The landscape, baked by industrial waste, is brown-red-gray. Only the rich enjoy green grass and gardens filled with blooming flowers.

Most striking is the intermodal concentration camp.

Spanning several sets of rails, the prison train pulls cars loaded with shipping containers. The containers are placed aboard by multiple rotor helicopters. Inside the containers are healthy humans.

The train set is used by the cabal that runs the superstate to store and process the healthies. Theyre used as DNA feedstock for a covert genetic engineering program designed to keep the aging rulers alive.

Casshern is no fairy tale. Its bleak from beginning to end. People are nothing more than a commodity to be exploited. The compelling film brims with treachery. And, maybe someday, after Ive watched it again and again, Ill understand the plot and its half-dozen subplots.
