450942,4,630228175X,"This movie could serve as material for at least 10 hours of debate in a movie appreciation course. There are so many things to analize here. First of all, there's a huge amount of stereotypes that have their source in the  30's and 40's movies. The tragic fate of heroes, the tormented  ""girl"" in love with him, the ""exotic"" latins, the loyal  sidekicks and so. This is basically a matine movie. The plot was made for  people that didn't even know or cared about the cultural differences  between each southamerican country, they were audiences that needed to flee  from serious topics such as WWII. Moreover, this story could have been set  in Africa or Phillipines, it wouldn't have mattered. What's important about  this movie is that it's intended for fun and it's highlights deal with  heroism, and besides all that, it's still very entertaining. The special fx  seem dated now, but they must have looked great then. Regarding the  performances, Jean Arthur steals the show, even though she was 40 at the  time, she looks young, energetic and skillful. Watching Rita Hayworth at 21  is a treat and Cary Grant, even though poorly casted, does his best to  bring something to the party (Check his armpit-high trousers). All the cast  goes along with this improbable story and Hawks puts together this nonsense  nicely pouring his instinct for adventure every minute. The dvd quality is  great. Loosen up and enjoy this movie placing yourselves in it's context.",962928000,6,1463,4.882113821138211
450943,1,630228175X,"I know this review will earn me boos, hisses, and ""not helpful"" votes, but my wife and I (both lovers of old movies) watched this a few nights back and frankly, we were baffled.  Howard Hawks has made his share  of movies with ""men's men"", but these characters are the most  opaque and wooden I've ever seen!  They are air-freight pilots delivering  to the treacherous Andes mountain area, led by the normally charming (or at  least interesting) Cary Grant.  When the first pilot takes to air in the  film (Noah Beery, I believe), you can hear in the inflection of his voice  over the intercom that he seems resigned to his fate--the fog's closing in,  and he's doomed to crash.  Indeed he does, as do a number of the other  pilots that follow in the film.  The job doesn't seem to have any merits  above its risks, and Jules Furthman's turgid script doesn't give us any  hint as to why these men would risk their lives doing this job.  It's  implicit that flying IS their life, and there's this hunger that is  satisfied only through this activity.  But it's a tenet of the movie and a  credo of the men that nothing needs to be explained, it's a man thing, and  one just needs to move on.  So what we get for ""entertainment""  almost borders on parody, as mission after mission goes awry, and the  tight-lipped toughies muddle through.  For romantic interest, there's Jean  Arthur as an itinerant showgirl who almost immediately falls in love with  Grant, though he ""wouldn't force a girl to do anything she didn't want  to"" and no woman has been able to cope with the stress of living that  close to death (though, in the film, Grant never actually gets up in a  plane); there's also Rita Hayworth, one of his exes, who's now with  McPherson (Richard Barthelmess), a pilot who bailed and let his partner die  in a previous air accident.  He of course, gets to redeem himself, and at  the end gets to nurse a beer with the guys, cradling it in his burnt and  bandaged hands.  Hayworth also tries to seduce Grant, to no avail.  Eventually the girls fall into line (acting appropriately stoic), and  Arthur decides to hang around after Grant, in his typical off-handed way  lets her know he loves her (via a two-headed coin)--but he loves flying  more.  I couldn't fathom this movie or this closed society; the story is  slow and repetitive and the actors have been directed to suppress every bit  of charm or life they have within them (you can see it trying to escape  from Jean Arthur)--it's all very morose, banal and a trial to sit through.  As a rule, I don't give one-star reviews--but I can honestly say I hated  this movie.",949881600,18,2631,4.5256410256410255
450944,5,630228175X,"Hollywood has made some fine aviation movies in the last 20 years: Battle of Britian; Blue Max; Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines.  But they can never equal the handful of great films of the dozen or so years  ending with the Second World War. Wings; Hell""s Angels and Dawn Patrol  are unremakable monuments to a different age and a very different paradigm  and Only Angels Have Wings may be the greatest of them all.  1930s  audiences didn't see pilots as boys next store run through flight school.  Pilots were special and it was he essence of their specialness to fly. They  flew behind unreliable engines, in deadly weather, low over murdeous  terrain and they were not afraid.  In this 1939 production, Jean Arthur,  stopping briefly in a South American banama port, confronts that  specialness in a group of airmail fliers and their Chief Pilot, Cary Grant.  The clash of the imperaives of flying against the equally powerful  imperatives of friendship, loyalty, grief and passion make this movie  great.  Arthur is initially appalled to  watch Grant send one after another  of his pilots through a deadly mountain pass in an effort to establilsh an  airline.  Yet, she and the audience quickly recognize Grant's essential  decency.  Only Angels Have Wings was produced and directed by Howard  Hawks and features a stong suporting cast, including Richard Barthelmess as  a pilot achiefing redemption in a fiery crash and Thomas Mitchell as a  veteran aviator at the close of his career.  The flying sequences by the  celebrated Paul Mantz are impressive and sometimes breathtaking such as he  scene of a Ford Trimoter spinning down through the clouds.  If you have  any interest inf flying or the prewar era, like a good story or just want  to watch a superb actor and actress, this is for you.",921369600,13,1813,4.884488448844884

451053,5,630228175X,"""Only Angels Have Wings""(1939) was one of the many films that was released in what many consider Hollywood's Golden Year(1939) and although it may have been overshadowed by some of the other films released that year(""Gone with the Wind"", The Wizard of Oz"", etc.) it has certainly stood the test of time. Directed by Howard Hawks, Criterion's new Blu-ray of ""Only Angels Have Wings"" has been given new life  and fans of the film will be more than pleased with the results. According to the liner notes from the enclosed booklet: ""This digital transfer was created in 4K resolution from the original 35 mm camera negative and restored by Sony Pictures"" and Criterion has given the film a high bitrate(34.93). The results are very impressive with a nearly pristine picture from start to finish. Photographed by cinematographer Joseph Walker, almost the entire film takes place at night with many scenes depicting extreme weather conditions(fog, rain, mist, etc.) but Walker gets the most out of his images with lights and shadows being especially effective. There is light grain in some scenes, but overall the video image is crystal clear with close-ups being especially vivid.  Filmed entirely at the Columbia Ranch, the set designs and art direction are more vivid now on Blu-ray, something that was lacking from the standard DVD. As with previous Blu-ray releases, Criterion has cleaned up and removed any film debris such as dirt, torn frames, vertical lines, etc. As for the storyline, ""Angels"" is basically a story about male camaraderie and friendship set in a fictional South American country. Nobody did male camaraderie better than Howard Hawks(""The Dawn Patrol"", ""Air Force"", ""Red River"", ""Rio Bravo"") but the script wisely adds a subtropical romance to the story to keep things interesting. And the romance between Jean Arthur and Cary Grant is one of the highlights of the film. Obviously attracted to one another, their back and forth cynicism only reinforces what audiences in 1939 already knew: these two were meant for each other. They get great support from Thomas Mitchell, Sig Rumann, Victor Kilian, Richard Barthelmess and the beautiful Rita Hayworth in her first breakout role. The Audio (English LPCM mono) has been cleaned up as well. Again from the liner notes: ""The original monaural soundtrack was remastered at 24-bit from the original 35 mm soundtrack negative"" and is free of any noise artifacts(hiss, pops, etc.). ""Only Angels Have Wings"" is 121 minutes(Aspect Ratio: 1.37:1) and only contains the following subtitle: English SDH. Special features include Audio excerpts between Hawks and Peter Bogdanovich(21 minutes); An interview with film critic David Thomson(18 minutes); a documentary about Howard Hawks and his Aviation Movies(21 minutes); a Lux Radio Theatre adaption of the film and the theatrical trailer. There is also an informative booklet by film historian Michael Sragow. The blu-ray disc itself is housed in the standard clear Criterion blu ray case. ""Only Angels Have Wings"" is one of the best films from 1939 and Criterion's new Blu-ray should be a must own for any serious film collector. It comes very highly recommended.",1465516800,6,3170,5.189453125

451097,5,630228175X,"Only Angels Have Wings,"" directed by Howard Hawks, stars Cary Grant as daredevil pilot Geoff Carter, the manager of a small post office in Barranca, Colombia, where pilots fly the mail to hard-to-reach places over the Andes Mountains. The planes badly need repair, there are frequent storms, fog is almost always present, and crashes aren't rare. Bonnie Lee (Jean Arthur) stops in while her ship anchors in the port for a few hours and meets three pilots. Attracted by their free-spirited life, and particularly attracted to handsome Geoff, she decides to stick around when her ship sets sail.

The film combines some impressive aerial photography, a romantic subplot, and exciting, suspenseful scenes of the hazards facing the pilots. The dialogue is often overlapping, a trademark of Hawks that sounds perfectly realistic. Rarely do real people converse in perfectly formed, uninterrupted, full sentences. There are interruptions, half-formed statements, and monosyllabic responses. The conversational dialogue is a major factor in showing the characters as flesh-and-blood human beings. Rita Hayworth, who would become Columbia Pictures biggest star, appears in a small, breakout role. The amazing aerial photography won a nomination for the first-ever special effects Oscar.

Jean Arthur starred in many films of the 30s and 40s after several years playing unmemorable roles as ingenue or leading lady in comedy shorts and low-budget Westerns. Her big break came in John Fords The Whole Towns Talking, in which she displayed a flair for screwball comedy. She also took on heroine-type roles, coming to the aid of leading men Gary Cooper (Mr. Deeds Goes to Town) and James Stewart (Mr. Smith Goes to Washington). In Only Angels Have Wings, Arthurs Bonnie has a sharp tongue, a shadowy past, and her sights set on snagging the films fiercely independent hero.

The new Blu-ray digital restoration is pristine. Bonus features include audio excerpts from a 1972 conversation between filmmakers Howard Hawks and Peter Bogdanovich; new interview with film critic David Thomson; Howard Hawks and His Aviation Movies, a new program featuring film scholars Craig Barron and Ben Burtt; Lux Radio Theatre adaptation of the film from 1939, starring Cary Grant, Jean Arthur, Rita Hayworth, Richard Barthelmess, and Thomas Mitchell, and hosted by Cecil B.

451145,4,630228175X,"Kids from the generation of 68, my generation that came of age in the 1960s, were animated the exploits of guys who explored the outer reaches of space, the astronauts (and in the beginning it was only guys under something like the same principal as in track where women were thought to be organically incapable of running more than about one hundred yards and were protected against any longer distances by stern old men. Didnt those old gophers get a surprise when the women could outrun them.)  Every kid, every guy kid measured himself against those daredevils, dreamed dreams if only for a moment of taking that big lift-off into the unknown to see if they had the right stuff. That same premise applies to the subject of the film under review, legendary director Howard Hawks Only Angels Have Angels, for an earlier generation who dreamed of flying airplanes. Of fulfilling the old ancient Icarus dream of flying to the heavens. Most of us were not around to witness the feat when Charles Lindberg crossed the Atlantic solo from New York to Paris and survived he was thereafter treated as a hero (whatever his later isolationist politics).

Of course nowadays with computers practically running the modern jet (it is estimated that the pilot only controls the plane for something like three minute of the flight) there is little swashbuckling thrill to the profession (and overall that is to the good for nervous passengers) but back in the 1930s in the outback with vintage airplanes held together by wire and guts that was a different story. And that is where our story gets some traction. See Geoff (Cary Grant) and Dutchy are running a small airmail run business down in some unnamed banana republic (literally- the opening scenes show a dockside unloading of mucho bananas, okay). Except they are in trouble since that wire and guts only takes you so far when you are losing pilots and mail to the horrible weather conditions and whatever else Mother Nature can throw at you.

But Geoff is a hard guy, a guy who has been around and has taken a few hard knocks in his life and he will not let the operation go under without a fight. And in the end it does not go under thanks to the Kid (a fellow pilot) and Bart who had left the Kids brother high and dry one time but who in the end whether to satisfy his wife Judith (played by fetching Rita Hayworth, fetching at that time, later in Gilda she would be, ah, lets leave it at alluring) proved he too had the right stuff.  Nice story for swell guys who had guts and glory written all over them.

Wait a minute, wait a minute that is just the cover story, the story for kids who want to dream about flying in tough spots. Here is the real story, what the hell this one had handsome Cary Grant in it so it could not only be about hail fellows, well met. Yes, there is a dame involved. Two actually since the aforementioned Judith left Geoff high and dry when he refused to ground himself so she would not worry at night whether he was coming back. Judith took Bart on the rebound and Geoff was soured on women for good. Well, not quite for good because Bonnie (played by Jean Arthur) a gal down on her uppers finds herself coming off the boat in that unnamed banana republic and as one thing leads to another she falls, falls hard for hard guy Geoff. What is a woman to do in such a situation? Well use her pluck, her charms and her pouts to lure the hard guy in. And guess what (remember this is 1930s black and white film Hollywood) it turned out that Geoff was kind of stuck on her despite his better judgment. (I still think when Rita showed up with old Bart I would have taken another at her but that is just my druthers). This is not the best of Cary Grant or Jean Arthur but the film proved to be a lot more interesting than I expected so worth a watch.",1429142400,3,3818,4.417613636363637

Cary Grant plays against type here, he's a tough guy who won't get close to anyone to avoid the loss from not-so-uncommon flying fatalities. Lots of Hawks' humor and guy talk, Hawks himsef was a pilot and knew the ethos and lifestyle thoroughly. Jean Arthur is great as a vacationing showgirl who is taken with Grant's matter-of-fact nature with a hint of vulnerability and prior love interest Rita Hayworth drops in to make things more interesting.

Jean Arthur is probably my favorite actress of all time but if this had been the first movie I had ever seen her in, I would have never given her a second thought.  Usually, Jean Arthur plays strong women even when all sweet and innocent.  She's a delight.  I even have a biography of her.

I will not lend this movie out.  I will not recommend this movie.  I will not bring this movie up in conversation.  If I were teaching a class on film, I would show this movie because my students could learn how far we've come since 1939 in society, behavior, aviation, safety, and the value of human and bird life.  This movie shows that way back then, when a pilot died, you blamed him for being a worse pilot than the flying conditions you sent him in.  Then you buried him, and divided up his personal belongings.  You sent his sister back in the U.S. $100, which might have been a lot of money back in 1939 but it is still a token for a human life, isn't it?  You have some nitroglycerin you need to dispose of?  Why not drop it on some pesky condors in the mountains.

Cary Grant's acting is a C- here.  I thought how funny it would be just to read the script because the lines are short and, well, stupid. We've come along way since movie dialogue was this unnatural.  This is the movie that is used to make fun of old movies in parodies.

I have a good collection of old movies.  This is going in the collection but it isn't a favorite.  I'm sorry I even bought it.  I should have just rented it and not let it take up space on my shelf.

I would rate this a 1-Star movie if I didn't like Jean Arthur and Cary Grant so much.  I agree with the person who said a good movie transcends time, this one doesn't.

451326,4,630228175X,"This movie takes place in the classic ""Banana Republic,"" never named, and so understood to be fictional. But we know it is a banana producer, because Bonnie (Jean Arthur) is the performer (she has a ""specialty act,"" which clearly includes playing one hot piano and we never really find out what else) who arrived on the banana boat, expecting to get back on at 4:00 a.m. when it is due to sail. She is at once picked up by a couple of loose cannons who turn out to be airplane pilots who work with the company with a contract to carry the mail. Cary Grant plays Geoff Carter, the pilot who manages the company, although it is owned by the Dutchman who also owns the tavern, hotel and restaurant (one establishment), and is also the postmaster.

Bonnie doesn't take long to start falling in love with Carter, but he says he'd never ask a woman to . . . she interrupts him and so we are a time learning how the sentence ends. At her insistence, he tells her about a girl ""a lot like you,"" who couldn't handle the fear that at any time he might not come back. And it's true: the weather is hard to predict, the mountains are jagged, and they have a spotter up in the mountains near the pass to give them radio reports on the weather. Unfortunately, the weather changes so quickly that it's still quite dangerous, and one pilot crashes on landing the first night Bonnie is there.

Then Bat MacPherson, the new pilot shows up, and it turns out he is known to the pilots as a coward who parachuted out of a plane that had malfunctioned and let his technician on board to crash. The technician was one of the pilot's brother. So there's a great deal of hostility toward MacPherson. Tension gets even higher when it turns out Mrs. MacPherson (a very young Rita Hayworth) is the girl who had rejected Carter because she couldn't handle being married to a pilot. So here she is married to a pilot.

I'm not going to tell you the whole story, because there is some great character development here, but it is a little hard to swallow in places. So very much happens in such a very short period of time, which tends to stretch my suspension of disbelief. I mean, most of it takes place in a single week.

451327,4,630228175X,"In ONLY ANGELS HAVE WINGS, we see a more serious Cary Grant. It's not one of the romantic comedies he was famous for in his early career. ONLY ANGELS HAVE WINGS is serious stuff. Grant stars as Geoff Carter who, along with owner Dutchy, runs a freight airline company in some unnamed South American country. Planes and pilots are constantly being lost in the savage weather and the flight over the Andes mountains.

The team has become jaded and callous as one after another pilot is killed and basically, quickly forgotten. It seems like a cruel world but we see the crew has to be hardened to survive the constant loss of coworkers. Geoff constantly sends pilots to almost certain doom in dangerous weather all in the name of business and the hopes of winning an important contract.

A lot of the flying and plane crashes are special effects using models. This probably was super high tech for 1939 but looks very dated now. The few scenes of planes actually flying close to mountains are stunning.

Although we seem to be in some remote outpost, ships do show up at the part and before we know it, perky Jean Arthur and the ravishingly lovely Rita Hayworth are in the picture. Both women are objects of Geoff's attention but he always seems the stoic gentleman.
It's odd that Arthur and Hayworth are key characters but both seem to come and go. Arthur seems to completely disappear for a while and suddenly she is back.

ONLY ANGELS HAVE WINGS is another colloboration of Cary Grant and director Howard Hawks. Hawks and Grant made several films together and they seem to have been a good match for film. The film seems particularly long at over 2 hours and seriously repetitious as planes go up and come down (not always in a good way). I wondered how many planes this small airline had and how they could keep operating after each loss.

Although I think the film is lacking in substance on occasion, it has a remarkable cast of talented actors. The stars a famous and the film is filled with classic character actors that I have seen in countless films.

A lot of the story is rather dramatic and contrived about the list of enemies and old flames that arrive.

Directed by Howard Hawks

While waiting for her boat, Bonnie Lee (Jean Arthur) stops at a small airport in South America. The pilots there deliver mail over a dangerous and usually foggy mountain pass. Geoff Carter (Cary Grant), the lead flyer, seems distant and cold as Bonnie tries to get closer to him. Things heat up as Judy MacPherson (Rita Hayworth), Geoff's old flame, shows up with her husband Bat MacPherson (Richard Barthelmess) who is an infamous pilot.

Scripted by Jules Furthman from a story by Hawks, 'Only Angels Have Wings' is a treasure trove of terse, pithy dialogue: one favorite scene occurs when, upon discovering that he's about to die, Thomas Mitchell says he's often wondered how he'd react to imminent death-and, now that death is but a few moments away, he'd rather that no one else be around to witness his reaction.

Good score by the great composer Dimitri Tiomkin.

Special footnote: ~ Howard Hawks remembers: ""When the movie was released a certain critic said 'It's the only picture Hawks ever made that didn't have any truth in it.' I wrote him a letter and said, 'Every blooming thing in that movie was true.' I knew the men that were in it and everything about it. But it was just where truth was stranger than fiction.""

451331,3,630228175X,"For a film containing a plot I was initialing intrigued in and bolstering a cast I usually lose my mind over (Arthur...Grant...Hayworth!), `Only Angels Have Wings' loses me almost immediately, and it never quite works hard enough to win me back.

Opening with an overly long, drawn out action sequence that sets in a precedence of predictability, `Only Angels Have Wings' gets off to wobbly footing.  It then makes a grave mistake of introducing too many characters with their own subplots that take away drastically from the film's main focus (the budding romance of the two stars) and thus becomes somewhat disconnected from the audience.  There is a lot going on, and the relationships between all are interesting yet poorly handled to the point where there came a time when I actually wondered what Jean Arthur was even doing in the movie; since the film all but gave up on fleshing her character out (AND SHE IS THE STAR!).

The film centers on a spunky chorus girl who happens to (by chance) meet and fall for a pilot.  That pilot has a past that affects his present, and so their relationship is destined to be `spicy'.  That pilot also happens to have an ex, and ex who is married to another pilot who has beef with yet another pilot because of some questionable actions that lead to an untimely death.  Throw all of that into a pot and stir, and you have `Only Angels Have Wings'.

The issue with all of these `plot points' is that the film lacks focus.  It divvies up time between the `relationships' but never really elaborates on any of them enough to make us feel a part of them.

Thank god for Thomas Mitchell, though.  He really nails his role as Kid Dabb.  Mitchell also had his sensational work in `Stagecoach' this very same year (a performance that netted him an Oscar), and this is just icing on the cake.  It is such a drastically different role, and he handles it with the same conviction and authenticity.  He layers Dabb and creates the film's most relatable and understandable and memorable character.

In the end I have to say I was very disappointed with this film.  It could have been so much better had it taken the time to either simplify its focus or intensify its character development.",1303257600,,2218,4.619897959183674
451332,4,630228175X,"Amazon have provided an excellent review of this macho adventure so I will only add the following:

- those familiar with the director Howard Hawk's legacy will recognise the atmosphere, the relationships and even some of the dialogue from some of his later works, especially ""To Have and Have Not"".
- Cary Grant, in a role tailor made for Clark Gable, does very well in a more rugged persona than he had played to date. The heroics are at times a bit cheesy but given the age of the film, that's OK.
- this was the film which really launched Rita Hayworth. She had been in films for a few years at this stage but here, she is showcased and her star quality is obvious even if her acting is the weakest of the leads.
- The film also was the last decent role for silent star Richard Barthelmess. He is well cast as the dour coward who must prove himself but his stardom was clearly over alongside dynamic Grant.
- Jean Arthur glows as always. The best scene in a film littered with air crashes, action and buddy relationships is Arthur's scene in Grant's bungalow when they employ the witty banter and flirtatious manner for which they were renown.
- the print is very good and the DVD contains a worthwhile featurette about Hawks and Grant.

451333,4,630228175X,"I mistakenly bought this movie under the impression that it was a romantic comedy.  And to my surprise it turned out to be quite a dramatic film about the hard life of fliers in Barranca, South America.  Cary Grant is a very cold-hearted manager of a primitive airline business that flies the mail out.  He doesn't flinch when his fliers die and is as much of a bean counter as any disgraced Enron exec.  Jean Arthur's role is more of a side note to the film.  However, she does what she can with it.  As she portrays a showgirl looking for work who lands in Barranca for a brief stay that turns out to be delayed for a week.  She falls in love (goodness only knows why) with the hard-hearted Cary Grant and tries her best to both emulate his sternness and to try to break through his tough exterior.  Since Cary Grant's character has the most male chauvinist views on love, she never really breaks through his exterior but for some reason or another is still madly in love with him.  Now the really interesting parts of the film are seeing a glimpse of what life was like for the fliers in an era of practically zero flight regulation.  And seeing a little bit of Latin America during that time.  So the movie has worth, but just be prepared for a serious dramatic film.  And not a romantic comedy!  P.S.  Rita Hayworth makes one of the grandest entrances onto the screen in this film.  Wow!  Can she make her presence known.",1277424000,6,1426,4.385496183206107

451335,3,630228175X,"This year, 2009, is the 70th anniversary of the release of this movie. For collectors, it has some historical value. It certainly shows that filmmaking has leapt ahead light years in that time. Everything - writing, direction, sets, effects (little model plane n miniature sets) , acting, et al, all provide a benchmark for motion pictures' advance.

But ""Hands down, Only Angels Have Wings is one of the most buoyantly entertaining movies in the American cinema"" is absolutely  NOT true. Of course, it has Grant, Arthur and Hayworth on the marquee`. But the plot, performances and  direction are not 'the most' of anything. In perspective, perhaps the least. For Grant, from that time, his TOPPER work, and any number of other vehicles are incredibly better.

My three stars rating is out of respect for the talents involved and the historical perspective;

451383,5,630228175X,"If you don't think this is a great movie .... YOU SHOULD FALL OUT OF AN AIRPLANE!

Once he became a star, Cary Grant insisted that the girl should puruse *him,* rather than the other way around.  And that's exactly what Jean Arthur does in this movie.

Opening with her arrival at a private airfield in some South American banana republic, Jean Arthur goes into a bar, starts playing the piano, makes friends with everybody, and for the rest of the movie *throws* herself at Cary Grant.  (Wot a guy!)

Oh, sure, a few people crash or nearly crash in the airplane sequences, but who cares -- the chemistry between Cary Grant and Jean Arthur is irresistible.

Oh yeah, I almost forgot to tell you: there's an awful lot of drinking in this movie.

... A pilot crashes -- ""Have a drink.""

... Thomas Mitchell is grounded because his vison is failing -- ""Have a drink.""

... Rita Hayworth still has a torch for Cary Grant -- ""Have a drink.""

... Cary Grant gets shot in the arm by Jean Arthur, but she didn't really mean it -- ""Have a drink.""

Drink-drink-drink.  There's more drinking in this movie than at Toots Shor's bar mitzvah.  And he wasn't even Jewish.  (Rim shot: ba-da-bing-bing!)

When you see this movie and tell all your friends how great it is --and I know you will -- I mean, it's either that or falling out of an airplane right? -- when you see this movie pay particular attention to Jean Arthur's nose.  Jean Arthur has one of the most interesting noses in movie history. ...

Had she fixed her nose, which is a teeny-weeny bit too big, Jean Arthur might have qualified as a legitimate ""glamour girl.""  But she didn't fix it, which I think was very shrewd on her part.  That little, yet readily noticeable imperfection typifies what makes her so ingratiating to audiences in general and men in particular --  she's *approachable,* she's *vulnerable.*  And yet she's strong, liberated; full of you-know-what and vinegar.

(That's right, friends, here at ""Sal's Full Service Movie Reviews"" you not only get opinions on acting, you get piss & vinegar reports, too.)

In most of her major successes, Jean Arthur was ""the-gal-who's-a-pal"" to the male lead, and this gave her a great advantage over other attractive actresses back then.  For example, Rita Hayworth, a world class dish if ever there was one, is also in this movie and like other glamour girls it's impossible for her to connect with Cary Grant as anything more than a one-dimensional sex symbol.  And this limits Hayworth's appeal to men; and, I imagine, women as well.

Jean Arthur, on the other hand, scores both ways -- she can sexually excite a man and, at the same time, befriend him.  (Quick: name three actresses who can do that!)  Howard Hawks, the director, along with the movie's screenwriter, understood this, so that in addition to playing to her strong suit, her ""pal-relationship"" with men, they made sure Arthur got a great deal of sexual attention at the beginning of the movie from the various on-the-make flyers who fall all over each other to make a good impression, hoping to get a date with, as they put it, ""the blonde.""

This duality on Jean Arthur's part -- her appeal to men on a sexual basis as well as a friendship basis -- may have particular relevance to Cary Grant's well-known bisexuality.  For example, as much as he tries, in this movie as well as other ""action movies,"" Cary Grant just can't be a tough, hard-bitten guy in the mold of a Humphrey Bogart or a Jimmy Cagney or a Paul Muni -- all appealing leading men but all of whom, unlike Grant, did movie after movie and rarely if ever established ""chemistry"" with their co-stars. ...

In other words, Cary Grant's bisexuality may be the underlying reason why the chemistry he created vis-a-vis his leading ladies is so appealing.  While, at the same time, his bisexuality, as it manifested itself in his acting, made it difficult for him to fill in the macho requirements of an action movie such as this one.  So that Jean Arthur's ""butch-palness""-cum-""blonde-heterosexuality"" makes you forget about Grant's inadequacies as a legitimate cinema tough guy.  In short, because Arthur can hold her own with the boys, Grant can be tough with her, but not necessarily with the other male actors in the movie, as a Bogart or a Cagney would be.

It's not for nothing that Grant rarely appeared in action movies such as this one, not quite pulling off the macho part of the role.

Katherine Hepburn, too, possessed this ""butch-heterosexual duality"" -- with Grant, more than any other actor she worked with, facilitating that duality.  Think about how natural and spontaneous the scenes are between Cary Grant and his most famous ""butch-heterosexual"" leading ladies: Katherine Hepburn, Jean Arthur, Rosalind Russell, Irene Dunne.  After a while the audience suspects that they are having as much fun sparring with each other as they would have copulating with each other.

(""Copulating"" -- the way I come up with 'em, huh?)

Hepburn, rumored to be a lesbian, manifests her pal-relationship with Grant in a masculine way (quick, bossy, thin-lipped); whereas Jean Arthur, whose screen persona is just as liberated as Hepburn, balances her ""sex-with-friendship"" relationship without losing her femininity.

Notice, how smoothly and how effortlessly Cary Grant connects with Rosalind Russell's masculinity in ""His Girl Friday,"" another of his  collaborations with Howard Hawks.

Contrast this with the scenes between Cary Grant and Rita Hayworth in ""Only Angels Have Wings.""  Rita Hayworth is lightyears more glamorous than Kartherine Hepburn or Jean Arthur or Rosalind Russell -- but there's no chemistry at all between her and Cary Grant.  You can immediately see this in the way Hayworth is costumed; with sexy, shiny, tight-fitting clothes; and with the way the camera leeringly and unabashedly follows her rear-end, step-by-step up a flight of stairs.

Whereas you sense in Jean Arthur (costumed in a no-nonsense tailored suit) a sexually-charged, independent woman; but also someone who doesn't take herself nearly as seriously as either Rita Hayworth *or* Katherine Hepburn -- this being the main reaosn why I prefer Jean Arthur over Katherine Hepburn.

Grant bossily tells Arthur what to do in several scenes, and Arthur objects!  But when Grant continues, abruptly cutting off her objections, she retreats -- but not because she's weak or unassertive, rather because she instinctively senses that she's as emotionally strong as Grant is, maybe stronger.

See this movie and see if you don't agree.

And if you *don't* agree, Ga bless ya and I wish ya a lotta luck.",1247443200,2,6618,4.886200716845878
451384,4,630228175X,"This 1939 flick provided perfect entertainment for a rainy Sunday afternoon. Shot in black and white, it nonetheless featured stunning photography (especially for the time) of small, fragile planes soaring over Andean peaks which brought home the danger and romance of those days of aviation.
Cary Grant plays a man trying to run an aerial mail service in some South American country (Barraca!). The technology of the time is amusingly crude. To check the weather, he posts a man in a hut atop a mountain pass to radio down when the clouds are clearing. When a plane gets lost in the fog and tries to find the runway, the ground crew shines a light up into the air and listens to engine noise and then tries to guide him home -- unsuccessfully.
It's a dangerous business and when pilots die, which they often to, the rest of the crew cope with the stress by pretending the dead man never existed. Grant himself, we learn, has been burned by love and is determined not to let another woman pin him down.
In one jarring scene, a plane loaded with explosives is ordered to turn back when the weather changes and drops its cargo on a bunch of condors to get rid of the pesky creatures. Conservation and respect for other creatures was clearly a concept that hadn't yet taken hold.
Jean Arthur strolls off a boat for a night in the town, falls in love with Grant and spends the rest of the movie trying to lure him. She's feisty and witty with a soft center. Rita Hayworth has a secondary role which consists mostly of looking sexy.
The dialogue crackles and sparkles and the movie moves along at a seering pace. Don't think too much about the plot -- it's as ramshackle as the planes these guys fly.",1241395200,2,1695,4.5064935064935066

I say ""generally"" because there are a few dry spots, mainly Arthur's continued pining over Grant, but most of it fun to watch and it gets you involved in the story. Ruman and Barthelmess were especially good in their supporting roles. Hayworth's role, one of her first, was not that much, sorry to say.

Where that had a solid script that supported all the slapdash wonderfully silly humor of that era....this had a supposed adventure story set in some would-be exotic locale.  Nothing was believable.

We see the set-up---supposedly heartless heroic type (Grant) who won't commit to any love but that of flying meets spunky, independent entertainer (Arthur).  She fancies herself something of an adventurer, too, but meets her match with the cool, glossy Grant who has shut his heart down long ago.  Somehow Grant is too polished and gorgeous to be convincing in the role.  He looks perfect even when shot in the shoulder.  It has been said that Jean Arthur felt threatened by the younger Rita Hayworth, and she should have been.  She looks positively dowdy throughout...maybe it's the hairdo?  Even when she sheds the tailored suit for a chenille robe, she still looks like Bonnie Lee from Brooklyn.  It's hard to believe that, after all his years of avoiding women that he would succomb to her.

His apathy toward possessions or emotions and commitment to nothing but his desire at the moment make him a difficult catch. When ex-heartthrob Judy MacPherson (Rita Hayworth) arrives with her estranged daredevil husband Bat Kilgallen MacPherson (Richard Barthelmess) Bonnie resorts to less-than-subtle means to warm the cold-hearted man who daily tests fate.

Meager props and grainy filming detract from a movie that apparently kept the cutting room floor clean. Viewers might wish sharp shears were more plentiful. Perhaps because of the pace, it is not one of the finer Grant classics but worthy of a private afternoon showing to pass 2 hours. Jean Arthur's humor is the redemption for this story.

451392,5,630228175X,"Howard Hawks fashioned Jules Furthman's good screenplay into a true screen classic of male comaraderie and the women who must choose to accept it and love without attempting to change it. Hawks had Martinique as the setting for ""To Have and Have Not"" but showed his preference for exotic locales early on by setting ""Only Angels Have Wings"" in the South American port of Barranca. It makes a colorful backdrop to an even more colorful story of what it is to be a man.

The banana boats are coming in and Geoff (Cary Grant) is sending the mail out by plane in dangerous conditions in order to keep afloat his rag-tag outfit of pilots, living dangerously and liking it. They all wear guns but it's the weather that's more likely to take them down.

This is made clear early on when Bonnie Lee (Jean Arthur) hits the port for a short layover and attracts the good-natured attention of a couple of Geoff's pilots, one of whom Bonnie will see go down in flames just a few hours later. It is only then that Bonnie, already attracted to Geoff, will get a glimpse of real men and what their world is like.

Hawks shows the suspicion men who've been with a woman or two often harbor towards every female in a telling scene when Bonnie takes a momento from the fallen pilot's belongings and Geoff scoffs at her greed. Only moments later when she gives it to the young Mexican girl who adored him does he give Bonnie a few points, and then only in surprise.

Arthur is terrific here trying not to let her emotions show so she can live in Geoff's world. When a new pilot with a checkered past shows up (Richard Barthelmess), with Geoff's old flame in tow (Rita Hayworth), Bonnie realizes just how serious Geoff is about never asking anything of a woman. There is a ton of male adventure filling the screen in the meantime.

There are dangerous flights with nitro, daring flights for doctors, and Hawks even allowing a female into the act when Bonnie wings Geoff by accident with his own pistol. She goes to pieces, of course, as in Hawks' world, men were men and women weren't. I've never met a guy who doesn't love this film and perhaps that's why. Hawks adds his own spin on the romantic touch with the flip of a coin saying everything Geoff cannot put into words.

Grant is great here and Arthur sparkles. The rest of the cast is excellent, with Thomas Mitchell especially memorable as Geoff's best friend.  Any male who wants to hang out in a bar with their pals and not talk about what every man already knows by virtue of their kind, will love this one. You'll wish there were a few girls like Arthur still out there too. Just a fantastic look at good men, jaded about women, but still needing them.

451453,3,630228175X,"I will start off by saying that this movie did keep me entertained througout.  Although I was starting to become impatient because it definitely could have used some trimming.  I also think Jean Arthur, a lovely actress and comedienne, was mis-cast.  There was also some very poor acting from a very fresh faced Rita Hayworth.  You should also be ready to accept and overlook that the special effects mainly involve toy airplanes landing on model sets.  There is one fairly exciting action scene when Barthelmess lands and takes off from a small stretch of land to rescue a sick man.

Jean Arthur later commented that she felt Cary Grant was constantly up-staging her by blocking her out of the picture.  She also stated that she was threatened by the beauty of Rita Hayworth.  Just something extra to watch for if your so inclined.",1146441600,4,832,4.769230769230769

451455,5,630228175X,"Many of the other movies of 1939, the so called Golden Year of American Films, are the culmination of a decade of experiments with sound (and the consequent adjustment in acting style which the ""talkies"" necessitated).  Thus Mr. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON, for example, forms the perfection of a certain kind of screwball/sentimental comedy that Frank Capra had been making all throughout the 1930s.  When it comes to ONLY ANGELS HAVE WINGS, however, something entirely new is being born, and the picture ruptures the through-line of previous films by all of its participants, especially the director, Howard Hawks, who really finds his feet here for the first time.

For Cary Grant, it was a step he really wasn't prepared to take, and his subsequent releases backed off from the hard, cold, unlikable he-man he plays here.  His Geoff Carter doesn't really give a damn about anything except flying and Thomas Mitchell, ""Kid Dabb.""  Geoff's romantic feelings for Bonnie (Jean Arthur) and Judy (Rita Hayworth) are nearly entirely cynical.  In Hawks' world, a woman earns the right to be with a man by acting like one.  Men don't want trouble (so for the most part they don't want women.)

There's something Shakespearean about the piece and it's not just the incredible presence of Richard Barthelmess, a great actor but no longer the exquisite boy-man of TOL'BLE DAVID and the Griffith silent films.  Here, like Falstaff, he has seen the chimes at midnight.  It's also the knowledge that one style of screen acting (Jean Arthur's) is on its way out and a new one (Hayworth's) is on its way in--not acting at all really, but spectacle.  Splendid in its own way.",1119312000,11,1658,4.906810035842294
451456,5,630228175X,"When we shuffle off to that fabled desert island I'll let you take CASABLANCA or CITIZEN KANE or any other Greatest American Film you care to name - I'll take ONLY ANGELS HAVE WINGS and count myself the lucky one.
 We're in the tiny port of call Barranca on the coast of Ecuador.  Bonnie Lee (Jean Arthur), a `specialty' entertainer, is getting off the boat.  A couple of fly-boys pick her up and treat her to a dinner at the hotel/restaurant/bar and headquarters of Barranca Airlines.  Geoff Carter (Cary Grant) enters and sends one of the fly-boys off into a nasty spell of weather - the mail has to be delivered.
 The plane crashes and the pilot is killed.  The rest of the pilots, led by Carter, respond with indifference and some forced gaiety.  Bonnie is shocked by the callousness of it all:
 Bonnie: Haven't you any feelings? Don't you realize he's dead?
 Geoff: Who's dead?  Who's Joe?
 One face slap later Geoff lays it out for her.  ""And all the weeping and wailing in the world won't make him any deader 20 years from now.  If you feel like bawling, how do you think we feel?""
 End of lesson one.  Bonnie is intrigued enough to miss her connecting boat and stays in Barranca for an action packed week.  Geoff may be her ideal man, if she can just crack The Code.
 ONLY ANGELS HAVE WINGS is less plot driven than most.  Rather, it is a slow accumulation of scenes dealing with themes director Howard Hawks would return to again and again - male camaraderie, stoic indifference to danger, courage and devotion to duty.  It also asks how women fit into this testosterone loaded environment.  As usual, he assembles a competent ensemble cast and explores these issues from a number of angles.
 For instance, take Bat MacPherson (Richard Bathelmess), a good pilot who has a black mark against him.  Prior to arriving in Barranca he bailed out of a plane and allowed his co-pilot to die in the crash.  That type of cowardice offends The Code, and MacPherson is ostracized and given the worst and most dangerous assignments - if he dies the group's indifference won't be feigned.  By coincidence MacPherson arrives with his beautiful wife Judy (Rita Hayworth), the `somebody' Bonnie earlier tells Geoff ""must've given you an awful beating once.""  Judy couldn't conform to The Code with Geoff, and as luck will have it she's saddled with another confounding male - she doesn't understand why the other pilots shun her husband, and The Code doesn't allow anyone to explain it to her.
 Everyone is on top of their game in this one (this was Rita Hayworth's breakout movie).  As an unexpected and bonus the print is almost immaculate.  The dvd also contains a number of movie posters, biographies of the director and the major stars and a trailers for HIS GIRL FRIDAY and GILDA.",1084060800,13,2779,4.662551440329218

451458,5,630228175X,"Only Angels Have Wings is a perfect example of an often ignored, but excellent, classic movie. Directed by Howard Hawks, and with a great cast, Only Angels Have Wings is half exciting adventure movie and half romantic comedy. The sense of setting and atmosphere is very good as well - you almost feel as though the movie transports you to the imaginary South American port town of Barranca. The movie describes the adventures of a group of pilots working in a very dangerous location - they are hemmed in by mountains, and constantly face bad weather conditions. More specifically, it focuses on Bonnie Lee (Jean Arthur), a chorus girl staying in the town, and her encounters with the tough boss of the business, Jeff Carter (Cary Grant).
The cast is very good. Cary Grant, though not playing his usual role, is excellent as the tough boss, who only flys when it is too tough for anyone else. Jean Arthur is sweet and believable as the stranded chorus girl, and the supporting cast, including a very young Rita Hayworth (in her first A-movie) is perfect.
Anyhow, if you haven't seen this hidden classic from 1939, what are you waiting for?

451459,4,630228175X,"This is yet another great movie from the remarkable year, 1939. I've always been curious as to what plateau the movies would have wound up on had it not been for the devastating chain of events called WWII, which had begun the year before in Europe and China.
Jean Arthur, one of Hollywood's great comedic actresses, plays a show biz type who, for reasons never made clear, has sailed into a backwater South American port. There she meets a bunch of guys who work for a rickety airline that needs to get a big mail delivery contract in order to survive. Cary Grant plays the leader of this group. He's been burned by women in the past, and, though attracted to Arthur, acts the tough guy who only cares about his job and his buddies. It doesn't take long for Arthur to decide that he's the one for her, but she's worldly enough to know that this is one catch that will be hard to reel in. Meanwhile, Grant and company have enough to keep them busy, as they battle wind, rain, fog, old airplanes, big birds and some very tall mountains in order to get said mail to its destination.
One thing I love about this movie is the way is never seems to take itself seriously. I don't know what the filmmakers intended, but much of it seems almost a satire of macho action pictures. Why else would they cast two such wonderfully funny stars in the leads?
Also of note is way the script addresse some tricky issues in the Arthur-Grant relationship by giving the movie a hopeful, rather than happy, ending. It leaves it up to the viewer to decide if this odd couple will make it or not.
The movie won an Oscar for Best Special Effects. Some of these are remarkable even today, while others are now laughably crude. But the special effects are just icing on the cake. Only Angels Have Wings is very much story driven. Nearly half of it takes place on one set, but the characters have so much going on that you hardly noctice the static setting.
Great supporting perfomances by Thomas Mitchell, Richard Bathelmess and a very young, inexperienced Riat Hayworth.

Taking  place in a South American port of call for local Bananna Boats-Barranca- in  which a Dutchman, John van Rider (The Dutchman) who runs almost everything  in town, owns an air mail service that-despite hazardous and blinding  weather- always sends its mail (and pilots) out on time, so that new planes  can be bought, which will help weather conditions.  As I have  mentioned, the weather is harmful, and many who are emplyed by the Dutchman  are killed at one point or another.  Out of the small gang of pilots  (including John Carrol as Jent Shelton, in a minor but excellent role), one  stands out; Cary Grant, who plays Jeff Carter, a once sensitive and caring  man who was turned into a cynical, unhappy chappy after a harsh breakup.  Running the airline, Jeff only goes out when he thinks it might be too hard  for anyone else.  Bonnie Lee (Jean Arthur, in one of her first large  roles)has just gotten of a Northbound boat to cool off for a couple of  hours before the ship has loaded some bannanas and is ready  to set out to  sea. On the shore, she is met by two pilots who (after some trouble) manage  to ""get"" her.  Heartless Jeff sends one out for a  delivery, contrary to a deal made between the two. Bonnie is shocked by  Jeff's behavior. After deciding to come back when the fog is too much to  bare, the pilot attepts a dangerous landing resulting in his death.  Bonnie is shocked by how easily and rudely the bunch takes it. However,  she is explained to by two members of the band, including Jeff's veteran  flier best friend Kidd (played by Thomas Mitchell in perhaps one of his  best roles) that they must do that or te feelings balled up inside them  would be too much to bare. So Bonnie cheers up and joins the group.  The next day, when Jeff gtes back from a delivery, he is surprised to find  that Bonnie purposely missed her boat ride. He informs her in a rather  cruel manner that she has to go on the next boat.  Just when  everything seems perfect, a new pilot, McPherson (a great role for Richard  Bartelmess) and his wife Judy arrive, (Rita Hayworth, in her career  starting film) and two rather astonsihing revalations are made.  After, the pilots try again to lead a happy life, though, as they discover,  it may be rather difficult.

451462,5,630228175X,"First off, if you like Howard Hawks in general, or To Have and Have Not, you will love this movie.  To Have and Have Not lifts its entire plot line and much of its dialogue from this film.

Cary  Grant is hard-bitten, amoral, and cold as ice.  And he's  great!  Way better than when he's acting suave or zany.  The flying scenes have aged far better than similar special effects from this period, and the dialogue, sexual tension, and machismo still  crackles.  I could imagine Barranca existing sixty years ago, and I imagine  that it still exists in modern form today.

The plot line is fairly  bare, a bunch of down on their luck pilots disagree, fight, and try to get  by in a jungle port.  (Barranca, where the film takes place, is one of the  greatest sets I've ever seen.  Maybe the best black and white set with the  exception of Rick's Cafe Americain ever).  There's a vengeance plot line,  an unrequited love, and a floundering airline mixed in.  It sounds like too  much, but the combination works just right.
