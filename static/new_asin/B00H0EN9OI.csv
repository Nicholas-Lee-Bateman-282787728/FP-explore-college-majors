8628963,4,B00H0EN9OI,"This is the end of the `Easy Money' trilogy and some have commented that this is the weakest of the three which is sometimes par for the course with all sequels. However there is still a whole lot here to warrant attention. JW (Joel Kinman) now lives in exile and still is determined to find out what happened to his sister. Jorge (Matias Varela) from the earlier film is the main focus of this one though as he seeks to steal a ton of cash and get out of the game altogether.

We also have an undercover cop, Martin Wallstrm, who is sent to infiltrate the Serb mafia and get to crime king pin Radovan. Then luck comes calling when an attempt is made on Radovan's life and Martin get taken on board to look after Radovan's daughter - Nadja (Madeleine Martin). Well things never seem to go as planned and in a world of big bucks crime and prostitution there is always going to be someone out to take from the ones at the top - this is no exception.

This is a fine end to the trilogy; Joel Kinman gets very little screen time by the way. This is really about Jorge and Martin. You do not have to have seen the first two, but as ever it really helps if you have. There is action, guns car stunts and it is all done in a very stylish way - with production values to the high end. No one puts in a bad performance and at nearly two hours this does not waste its time. It is in Swedish, English, Spanish and Serbian and all with good sub titles. It may not be quite as good as the first two, but they were both pretty tall acts to follow - still I was glued to this so can easily recommend.",1416009600,2,1585,4.076923076923077

Movie has 2 minutes of Joel Kinnaman added as if in a different country, movie, universe...deceptive.
It is an awful movie.
Stop at  Easy Money 1 & 2. Mistake to order.

Supplier was good - timely and shipped well.",1414022400,3,226,4.357142857142857

A reasonably good action thriller on it's own.  Every once in a while the plot connections are a little clumsy or unceremonious.  Kinnaman's character is less visible in this third instalment of the Easy Money Series, but still central to what is happening.  I will not give spoilers, but fans of the whole series may not like some of the changes in focus.

Though you don't have to see the previous two movies to enjoy this one, I suggest you do (Easy Money, & Easy Money: Hard to Kill).  You will get a quick introduction to the main characters at the start of this movie, but they are flashed before you rather quickly. New and continuing plot lines will be established early on and are fairly effective at drawing one into the story.  However, it requires some strong attention as it can seem just a little disorienting and you have to keep up with subtitles.  Stick with it because it's well worth it in my opinion.  I had not seen the first two movies in the series yet before watching this one.  I still put enough together to enjoy this a great deal but I know I am missing some things.

The character development is outstanding as one would expect from a Swedish film.  Johan Westlund continues his search for his sister who has disappeared.  His search will take him even as far as LA in the United States, though the story mainly takes place in Sweden.  For the new viewer it's a little odd because his story seems to take somewhat a back seat as other character's lives take the forefront.  Jorge Salinas is recruited to bring a crew in and conduct a robbery for which he will receive a large cut.  He dreams of building a beachfront hotel in South America when he is done.  He rekindles a lost love with a woman named Nadja who he plans to take with him.

Also central to the story is Radovan Kranjic and his gorgeous daughter Nata.  Radovan Kranjic is a Serbian crime boss in Sweden and human trafficker who is also a war criminal from the Balkan wars.  Inside his crime family is also an undercover cop who falls for Nata, creating an impossible personal conflict.  I felt the character of Radovan was likely based (very loosely) on Radovan Karadic, a real figure from the Balkan Wars.  I don't believe he ever hid out in Sweden though.

Each of the individual storylines are so strong they could almost be a movie on their own.  Strong character development drives the tension as you come to care about the individuals, or at least how things are resolved in the case of the villains.  Eventually all these plot lines will be tied together to help the viewer understand and to resolve some of the conflicts.  The action is hard hitting and intense, Very engaging.  I definitely felt the anxiety it intended to create.  Once in a very brief while I did find myself rolling my eyes when it got a little unbelievable.  But hey, we get that with Hollywood too.  This movie will throw some crazy plot twists at you, crosses and double crosses.  Some you will see coming, others you won't.

This is another in a long line of great Swedish cinema.  Not top tier, but excellent.  If you are not familiar with Scandinavian cinema in general you are really missing a treat.",1401235200,2,3192,4.493913043478261
8628967,4,B00H0EN9OI,"Long a dream disc of many, EASY MONEY arrives on blu-ray at last.  Starring the King of the One-Liner, Rodney Dangerfield's first starring vehicle following the smash success of CADDYSHACK played to receptive audiences and critics alike, and while I prefer the later BACK TO SCHOOL to this zany, gag-filled outing, there's still plenty of yucks to be had.  Tom Ewell and Joe Pesci round out a stellar cast, and Dangerfield's trademark zingers and adept comic delivery will make your sides hurt with laughter. And just try getting that catchy Billy Joel title tune out of your head!

EASY MONEY may not buy you happiness, but it will bring a smile or two to your face, and that kind of currency is welcome in any country.",1400544000,,720,4.698412698412699
