As a fellow costumed adventurer, it was heart warming to see that I am not the only one who thinks that he is crazy enough to attempt to make a positive difference in the world, even if only one good deed at a time.

I consider many of the individuals featured in the video close friends and allies. It is my sincere hope that as this documentary is circulated, public awareness grows for our mission and others will be inspired to compassion and generosity in the way my colleagues demonstrate in their everyday lives.

8264285,5,B001706GBY,"This is an independent documentary about real-life superheroes in America. Instead of commenting on the absurdity of her subjects, the filmmaker lets them play out their personalities and lives on screen, something that more documentary filmmakers need to practice. An interesting film with interesting characters living out their own unique version of the American dream.",1217376000,2,372,5.781818181818182
