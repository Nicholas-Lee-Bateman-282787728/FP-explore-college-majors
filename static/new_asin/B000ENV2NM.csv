8111726,2,B000ENV2NM,"This is a bad DVD to watch and learn to play snare drum rudiments, especially for young drummers. The instructor's grip of the sticks is a bad example for young drummers to watch. Very sloppy. This video was cheaply done. This video is broken up into many short segments...one short segment for each rudiment. Several times the instructor makes a mistake while playing, and they were to cheap to go back and refilm that sequence. Too sloppy and too cheap. You can do much better with other videos out there.",1383955200,,507,4.644444444444445
8111727,2,B000ENV2NM,"This dvd is mediocre at best (in my opinion)

The narrator does an effective job demonstrating each rudiment, starting slow and then increasing in speed.  He is one of the monotonous individuals i have ever seen, not very dynamic and didn't hold my interest at all.

This entire dvd is just the narrator/actor showcasing rudiments.  Gives no pointers and nothing extra.  I would pass on this dvd if i had the choice again.

He did effectively show each of the rudiments...nothing more",1297036800,5,484,4.841463414634147
8111728,4,B000ENV2NM,"This was just what I needed.  Short and to the point.  It would've been better if there was a chart to go along with the demonstrations, but on the second go-through I got a pen and notebook  and jotted down my own tabature so I could practice the rudiments on my own.",1264809600,2,268,4.115384615384615
8111729,5,B000ENV2NM,"I received this DVD for Christmas and it is exactly what I had hoped it would be, good basic instruction. There are no bells and whistles, just an instructor introducing each rudiment and then playing it. He gives you a simple way to count out each rudiment that is easy to remember. I started playing drums five years ago and never learned the rudiments. I realized I was missing a key ingredient to my overall success as a drummer. This DVD his helping me to fill some gaps in my learning.",1230422400,9,491,4.406593406593407
