7976174,5,B00007G1V0,I bought this DVD for my 2 year old grandson. He loves it! I've since sent other Miss Pattycake DVDs and they're all to his liking. I highly recommend Miss Pattycake!,1430438400,,166,4.387096774193548
7976175,5,B00007G1V0,My daughter has watched Miss Patty Cake Videos since she was about 3 months old.  She has always sat and watched the entire thing every time.  She is now 1 and she now claps and dances to the music.  I would definately recommend any of her videos to anyone with children infants to at least 6 years old.  Also if you are looking for more Christian videos I would also highly recommend the Donut Man (Rob Evans).  He also has some great singing videos.,1154563200,,451,4.321428571428571
7976176,4,B00007G1V0,"We LOVE Miss Patty Cake and this is the second DVD that we have. Our first was the Bible Sing a longs and it has the words at the bottom of the screen for busy moms to follow along so we can learn the words to help our children. I was VERY disappointed that this DVD doesn't have the words at the bottom nor does it offer subtitles. That is why it gets only 4 stars. But content, presentation, and subject is superior and is worth 5 stars. I do recommend this DVD regardless of the lack of subtitles.",1153440000,,500,4.0606060606060606
7976177,5,B00007G1V0,"My 2-year-old son loves Miss Patty Cake!  She has such a great message, once you get used to the goofy-ness of her outfit, etc.  ha  :)  Most of the songs on this video don't directly pertain to birthdays, but the overall theme is birthdays.  We used it to help introduce the birthday concept before the big 2!  We even played the birthday party parade segment during his party & the kids all marched around the house along with the video.  It was great!  :)",1146355200,,458,4.369047619047619
7976178,5,B00007G1V0,"I have two little grandaughters, 1 1/2 & 3 years old.  They absolutely love all Miss Patty Cake dvds.  The oldest one grew up on Baby Einstein, which are great, but the youngest never cared much for those.  However, she will sit glued to the Miss Patty Cake dvds.  I don't know whether little boys will like them as well, but I see no reason why they wouldn't.",1140220800,,360,4.25
7976179,5,B00007G1V0,Both of my children love this DVD. We have two other Miss Patty Cake DVDs and this one is just as great as the others. The songs and the message of Christ's love is presented in a very kid friendly way. It is high energy and lots of fun to watch.,1122854400,,246,3.843137254901961
7976180,5,B00007G1V0,"After realizing that the Baby Einstein videos are simply pacifiers and most cartoons have no redeeming value, I have been critically screening my 2 year old daughter's shows. Among her favorites are JoJo's Circus (teaches between right and wrong) and Dora (problem solving/some Spanish). I found Miss Patty Cake's Birthday Party Surprise at our local electronics store and was plesently surprised that it was a Christian video. Veggie Tales never has not yet become a hit in our house, so I was glad to find another children's Christian video. My daughter absolutely loves Miss Patty Cake. I think her animated nature (at first a little hard to swallow, but soon became her best quality) keeps my daughter's attention. In addition, watching other children is fascinating for her, as she does not go to daycare. I am headed out to purchse as many Miss Patty Cake videos as I can. It is nice to hear her adding ""Jesus Loves Me"", etc. to her list of songs that she sings throughout the day. Be prepared to stock up on more than one--as you'll end up watching this over and over. Enjoy!",1090454400,,1082,4.73015873015873
7976181,5,B00007G1V0,My 2yr & 6yr old loves all of Miss Patty Cakes videos.  It has been hard locating all of them but have had some luck at the auctions.  All of her tapes teaches such good things to the kids.  Like today I used her Easter video for my Sunday School class and the kids were all singing right along with her.,1050796800,2,304,3.9508196721311477
