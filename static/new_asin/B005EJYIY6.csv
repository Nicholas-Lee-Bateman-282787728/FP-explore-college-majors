The Economics of Happiness is a film that takes you around the world in all its color to give a
report card on how poorly the planet is combating the effects of globalizationthat is, except in
Cape May. This is truly a time where the county can be proud about some of the ways in which
we conserve and protect the environment.
Like most environmental films, The Economics of Happiness pulls no punches when pointing
out the negative effects of moving away from a localized economy. The phrase used to be: think
globally, act locally. Now the phrase might well be: think locally, act locally--care globally. This
film is hard-hitting and inspiring, and it demonstrates that millions of people across the world are
engaged in building a better world  that small scale initiatives are happening on a large scale.
The film shows that countless initiatives are united around a common cause: rebuilding more
democratic, human scale, ecological and local economies. And while so many parts of the world
may find the message of the film judges them harshly, such is not the case in Cape May.
The second half of the film comes alive with hope and promise as the film speaks of local farm
markets, staying in tune with local business, embarking on slow food movements. Sound
familiar? This film is a must-see for Cape May, where our emphasis on environmental
friendliness shows that when it comes to making a better planet, were getting a lot right!",1408406400,,1534,4.8106060606060606

It effectively describes how globalization of markets, banks, and industry is not only hurting the earth, but our wellbeing. It will make you think about our lifestyle choices and what we've bought into as ""normal"". Highly recommended.",1345593600,7,393,4.96969696969697
