7921525,4,B00004RYUZ,"Thsi Mortal Kombat tv series is set a long time before the MK tournaments from the two movies.

Kung Lao has just become Mortal Kombat champion by defeating Shang T-sung, and will not age till the next MK tournament as reigning champion. Shoa Kahn is not pleased that his Neatherrealm warrior was defeated, so he has banished Shang T-sung to the Colbat Mines of outworld. A hell like prison with all the scum and traitors Kahn has banished there.

Kung Lao was in love with a business mans daughter, he planned to marry her but the father would not allow this. The father was about to behead Kung Lao for not giving up on his daughter, and things go horribly wrong when Shang T-sung finds a deadly warrior named Scorpion in the Colbot Mines and sets him free into the Earth realm to kill Kung Lao.

Scorpion may fail his mission, but Kung Lao finds himself without his temple, but gained two new friends, Siro, his dead girlfriends bodyguard. And Taja (Terminator 3) a thief who turns out to be very mistaken and useful.

The first episode is a movie length pilot that introduces all this stuff. Then the adventure/plot of the series is the 3 warriors live in the trading post of the business mans and dead daughter. Taja starts up the trading post for money, and they also are looking for warriors to train for Mortal Kombat. (in which doesn't make much sense cause if they found someone, they'd be dead of old age by the next tournament)

All while this is happening, Shang T-sung is down in the Colbot mines trying to come up with new ways each week to kill Kung Lao and take his soul, in offer to give to Shao Kahn for his freedom out of the mines with the help of his ""slave/servant/mistress"" Vorpax. For if Shang T-sung is found to know how to escape the mines he would face a worse punishment from Kahn.

Also Shao Kahn plots his attacks in some shows. His step daughter Kitana is helping Kung Lao when she can.

Many familiar characters are used for this show that the MK fans will know, as well as some new faces.

In the series you will see how SubZero comes to be, that Reptile is not one man but many, How Mileena gets her face,  plus appearances by Rain, Noob Saibot, Quan Chi and his servants, one named Mike played by (Jamie Presley of My Name Is Earl) plus many more new faces.

Overall, I really enjoyed this series. It's acting was very good compared to MK2/Annihilation as well as the CGI work wasn't over kill and made you sick in this series.

It's an action/adventure/comedy with great plots and interesting characters.

However I will say, you can buy these 2 volumes on DVD for under 15 bucks for region 4, ignore these people selling it for 40 bucks or more on here, they are ripping you off.",1202601600,3,2717,4.422845691382766
