1343759,5,B00004RF6W,"A Luv Tale is a must own for anyone in love, looking for love, or believes that true love is possible. Even if this does not apply to you after you view this film it will.

1343791,5,B00004RF6W,"Saw this movie when I was younger and watched it again just today. I loved it then and still love it now. It's simple, romantic, and sweet. I can't wait until it becomes a series because I always wondered what happened after such an amazing cliff hanger. Also representation! Do I need to say anything else?",1507852800,,307,4.5
1343792,2,B00004RF6W,The dialogue was very dry and the connection between the characters was so fake. Thank goodness is was only 45 minutes long. I give it two starts because I appreciate representation of queer women of color.,1507680000,2,206,4.75

1343800,5,B00004RF6W,"Every review is true, truly a genuine love story with great chemistry between the leading ladies!  It leaves a great feeling in your heart, is realistic for that era, and is inspirational for this era.  We definitely need more film writing like this now and days.",1502928000,3,263,4.695652173913044

1343803,5,B00004RF6W,"I watched this via Amazon Instant Video. If you want a feel good romantic movie that has a good ending and great vibes all throughout, watch it. It was a positive movie for a hopeless romantic as myself. I really loved it as a film focused on lesbyns or womyn of color. Refreshing not to be stereotypical and full of drama. I could actually watch it again back to back. I only wish it were longer and we were able to see more of the future romance play out between the couple. The movie is realistic in circumstance but not always in outcome. In fact for the latter 90s it was probably definitely a fairy tale ending yet more realistic today. We've probably found ourselves or know someone who has found themselves in this situation but they didn't win. It would be nice if someone remain the movie to reflect the current tolerance and acceptance level society is in now and impress upon the audience this visual. I would have loved to seen more of the physical intimacy not necessarily sex, play out but, that's also the beauty of the film. Short film leaving you wanting more and hoping for this in your own situation. Moreover, it's great to see an older womyn submit to vulnerability with a younger womyn and to take risks for a better life. A lesson anyone can gain from when it comes to assessing your happiness and doing something about it. I'll definitely watch this again, at least 2x a year. I wanted to see myself in it. You'll create your own luv tale from it. You'll think back to the relationship you never had but wished you did or you'll rewrite the ending to one that wasn't attempted.",1502323200,7,1602,4.4523809523809526

1343805,5,B00004RF6W,"Delightful short film about two Black professionals ""ladies who lunch"" trying to balance the seductive pull of new love with their career obligations. The big question is ""do I follow my heart"" or ""do what I gotta do"".  MC Lyte makes a fun cameo as an outspoken best friend to the suitor, plus the surprise ending will truly make you gag.  Great to hear this throwback 90's true R&B soundtrack as well!",1502064000,3,402,4.569444444444445
1343806,5,B00004RF6W,What I loved about this film was seeing the full complexity of black women's lives portrayed on the screen. We need many more films like this - enough so that it doesn't feel like a special occasion to watch ourselves be well represented!,1500854400,2,238,4.558139534883721
1343807,5,B00004RF6W,"I remember when it first came out. I had not seen a film like this. It was clearly ahead of it's time and re-watching it has brought back great memories, but also points to the fact that there are still not enough stories told about the Black LGBTQ experience. So glad it is available to re-visit. Bravo!",1500768000,3,304,4.350877192982456

1343809,5,B00004RF6W,"Though short, (only 45mins), this is a great film.  The chemistry between both female leads is intoxicating.  Gina Ravera (Molly from Showgirls) is an excelently cast as Taylor James.  This film is definately worth your while.",1007596800,4,226,5.222222222222222
