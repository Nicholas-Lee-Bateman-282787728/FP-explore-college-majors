8094588,5,B000BYRIN2,"Deeply moving -- cathartic!  All of us a part are some mix of the  evil-hero, Special Agent, Walker and the idealistic, tragic hero Mr. Song whom he drove to suicide on and his daughter, who with the help of the finally repentant Waker exposes the wanton cruelty of Walker and Hoover's FBI.  Based on true story in NY of the evil that was the witch-hunting '50s.",1472428800,,362,4.454545454545454
8094589,5,B000BYRIN2,"I can't remember if I saw this movie as a rental or on cable. In the 1950's interracial relationships and marriage was taboo. In fact it was against the law in certain states. This movie honestly portrays the pain of it all during those times. During my entire 66 years I have thought that there is nothing wrong with interracial relationships. Over all, I enjoy this movie very much",1420070400,,383,4.565217391304348
8094590,4,B000BYRIN2,NICE COLLECTION OF MATT DILLON FILMS.  CITY OF GHOST WAS THE BEST I FELT USING SAN FRANCISCO AS A BACKGROUND AND A FILM THAT COVERED LITTLE MORE THAN A DECADE.  EACH OF THE FILMS DEALT WITH TOPICAL THEMES AND GOOD ACTING FOR INDIE FILMS..BRAVO,1415836800,,243,4.5
8094591,5,B000BYRIN2,"Maybe you had to have been there to understand how poignant a man with a leather suitcase in a climate of Cambodian jungle heat really is. I think that is what Matt Dillon was trying to do in City of Ghosts, an overly complicated plot but with an honest character trying to figure out how the hell he got to where he is and how the hell can he get out.
It is a brave film and Dillon and his cast are superior. They just do not know how they got there.",1398556800,,451,3.9130434782608696
8094592,5,B000BYRIN2,Intriguing although improbable generational-racial love story about secrets and how they always get you in the end.  I liked it.,1268524800,,128,5.4
8094593,2,B000BYRIN2,"Although certainly not a great film, Golden Gate is a passable film Noir. Spanning 3 decades, this film follows the story of a rookie FBI agent who imprisons a Chinese laundryman during the Commuinism scare in 1952. Ten years later, he finds himself romantically involved with the daughter of the laundryman, as he tries to make amends for the tragic consequences of the false imprisonment.

Matt Dillon and Joan Chen create a steamy romantic chemistry in this film. Although the ending is a bit weird, this is a passable film noir featuring some great panoramic views of San Francisco.",1219363200,,586,4.91919191919192
8094594,1,B000BYRIN2,I really liked it except for the parts I didn't like. It would have been better if it was a different movie.,1177372800,2,108,3.9545454545454546
8094595,4,B000BYRIN2,"This film was one which worked purely on emotional levels.  Matt Dillon and Joan Chen give fine performances as individuals whose cultures' although widely different bring them together in a poignant but tragic way.  Although the film tries to cover a large segment of time and simplifies  the conflicts exhibited by the 50's and 70's from the cold war to the peace  generation it does not lose track with its focus upon how events impact  human relationships. Conscience, guilt, love, ambition, and redemption of  the human spirit are sensitively embodied in this film.  Sounds  ""corny"", but it works.  The entire cast does a fine job and the  music score by Elliot Goldenthal is beautiful to hear.  Bring a  hankerchief.  This is a film with a heart.",946425600,10,752,4.873015873015873
