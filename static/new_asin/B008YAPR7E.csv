5190795,5,B008YAPR7E,For kill Joy the only thing that could have been better would be blu ray. Killjjoy on trail for not being evil enough will he be destroyed or reinstate as Hells favorite killer fullmoon klown..,1370908800,,193,4.542857142857143
5190796,4,B008YAPR7E,"This film picks up where the third one leaves off. Sandie (Jessica Whitaker), the lone survivor is in a mental institution while Killjoy (Trent Haaga) is on trial in Hell for being inept and a general lack of evilness. He brings back his old group of demons to help him out.

I like these films because they are inane and campy... and Victoria De Mare wears body paint. This film also incorporates the fates from Macbeth and any knowledge of Shakespeare tends to make this film worse...perhaps in a good sense. This film introduces a new inane character in Skid Mark (John Karyus) whose face approached the boundary of crudeness. Aqueela Zoll, third runner up to Miss California provides some additional eye candy as Jezabeth. Silly stupid fun.

On the overall scheme of things this film is superior to one and two, but not up to the tough standards set by number three.

Parental Guidance: F-bomb, nudity, implied sex. 4 stars for all the wrong reasons.",1365379200,,954,4.734939759036145
5190797,3,B008YAPR7E,"The ""Old Hag"" summons Killjoy to put him on trial for his incompetence as a villain. What Killjoy should be on trial for is that first movie. Really. Anyway, he's sent to Hell to face Jezabeth, the hot D.A. (Devil's Advocate, that is). Killjoy's attorney Skid Mark (Killjoy's biggest fan) sacrifices some flesh in order to conjure old pals and demon witnesses Punchy the clown (who talks like a scatting Snoop Dogg), Freakshow the mime (who can't speak at all), and Batty Boop, his girl (who just proves what a nice guy Killjoy really is). The gang hatch a scheme to bring back Sandie, the virgin from the 3rd movie who survived, and  witnessed the horror that Killjoy brought into her life. She has a case of the giggles, or at least that silly disorder that they advertise on TV (It's not funny, ok?!). Killjoy Goes to Hell was effective in creating its own unique world, and gave me a few good laughs.",1364860800,8,904,4.54601226993865

5190799,3,B008YAPR7E,"With Killjoy films expect 2 things. First and foremost the story line is very predictable. Second while entertaining and surprisingly effective at times,it only holds together for so long untill it becomes unglued. While i can definatly say this film has much more content and action then the previous films, they need to let the franchise die after this one. Watch with an open mind but expect only a few exceptional moments in an otherwise uneventful film",1354579200,3,457,4.9480519480519485
5190800,5,B008YAPR7E,Best fullmoon movie in years! It actually had somewhat of a budget! Now if charles band COULD MAKE ALL HIS MOVIES LIKE THIS ONE!  THEN HE WOULD HAVE ALOT OF HAPPY FANS.,1351382400,3,168,4.25
5190801,5,B008YAPR7E,"I can't stand most movies from Fullmoon but this is awesome, the best Killjoy so far. Part 3 was good but this one is way better.",1350432000,,129,4.0
5190802,5,B008YAPR7E,"KillJoy Goes To Hell picks up shortly after the conclusion of KILLJOY 3, this time Killjoy is being accused of not being evil and Killjoy faces the Devil himself in Hell's courtroom. He must prove that he's evil and worthy of a demon. His only hope is the testimony of his last victim. His minions plan an escape but are faced with nosy detectives, renegade clowns, and a whole mess of demons that get in their way. If they fail, Killjoy is doomed and damned to oblivion! That, my dear friends, is the plot to Killjoy Goes to Hell.

I'll be brutally honest here. Alot was weighing in on this movie. I decided, after the last Full Moon Feature, that if this movie wasn't up to the Full Moon standard of old--I wasn't going to support them anymore by refusing to buy any more of their movies. Why, you may ask? Well, let's just say that most of the movies I've seen as of late have turned in T&A-fest, falling a hair short of being a softcore porn movie. I felt the movies took a real nosedive and just weren't that great anymore. I ended up checking out Killjoy Goes to Hell and all I can say is my faith is restored in the comapny. KJGtH absolutely rocked and is a movie I could watch over and over.

Now, Full Moon--give us another Subspecies movie and I'll be HAPPY!",1350000000,8,1268,4.301255230125523
5190803,4,B008YAPR7E,"I'm a fan of schlocky horror movies so when I found the Killjoy Trilogy I thought, killer clown, why not? Well, the first two were horrible and not in a good way but I was going to stick it out... and I was glad I did. The 3rd in the series turned out to be an entertaining horror fantasy. Granted, it was low, low, budget and it showed, but the schlocky charm was there and I liked it. Trent Haaga and his clown posse were a hoot. Apparently, I wasn't the only one that thought so either because here we are with another sequel and this one (obviously) has a bigger budget. And is definitely the best of the series so far.

It starts out pretty much where the 3rd left off and now our impish clown leader is on trial in Hell for his crime of ""being too human"". I'll save you the plot details so you can watch it yourself and instead address the production. First off, there IS an actual, coherent story/plot. The dialog is smooth (it was a little choppy in 3) and all the actors are generally better. Score one star.

There are actual effects in this one that while not LucasFilm standard are not embarrassing either. They harken back to the old 80's style. Score two stars. The charm of the 3rd film remains intact as this movie plays out as a horror/fantasy/comedy. Thanks in no small part to the fact that the cast of the 3rd movie is back in place and are as fun and entertaining as before. Score four stars.

In a nutshell, if you're looking for slasher horror this isn't it. If you like low budget schlocky horror fantasy this one is worth a look. Here's hoping that Full Moon has more plans for the gruesome jester, Killjoy.",1349827200,4,1632,4.292207792207792

5190818,5,B008YAPR7E,"I love cheesy cornball lowbrow Horror/Comedy movies like this one and Killjoy Goes to Hell is one of the funniest movies that I have had the pleasure of viewing in recent years. Similar in style to low budget B-movie Troma movies such as The Toxic Avenger and The Class of Nuke 'Em High, this outing of Killjoy features our anti-hero psycho killer clown Killjoy in court and on trial by Satan himself for not being evil enough. How absurd is that premise? It's totally ridiculous, and also lots of fun. Star Trent Haaga is totally hilarious as Killjoy and Victoria De Mare is a pleasure to watch as Batty Boop.

Full Moon Pictures would do well to hurry up and make another entry in this series soon.",1408406400,,700,4.511811023622047

5190821,3,B008YAPR7E,"This is not great cinema but I am glad that this film exists. The demonic clown Killjoy is stripped of his powers and is hauled before a satanic court charged with incompetence. Other fictional works (e.g., Inferno, and Escape From Hell by co-authors Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle) present hell as a due process environment, but Killjoy Goes To Hell provides the courtroom drama. IMO it is worthwhile to compare the satanic bailiff's character with strongman Mike Henry's deputy sheriff character in the film Smokey And The Bandit. Killjoy Goes To Hell also shares the ""laughter as a defense against evil"" theme with author Ray Bradbury's novel Something Wicked This Way Comes. (Avoiding cinematic spoilers) Viewers must judge for themselves if justice is served.",1406592000,2,765,5.17741935483871

5190824,4,B008YAPR7E,I like how they allowed the thought that a demon can be put on trail for not being evil enough. It makes since to me. I always wondered what happened when they fail. I like the Killjoy series and I think this a good addition to the collection.,1399593600,,243,4.083333333333333

it was fun to watch but some parts was not in order, whoever cut & paste some the sense didn't pay to much attention of the story line, & at the end, when they start a war to break killjoy out, it was very confusing, where did all these creatures & people come from.
not as much killing as the other 3 but i still enjoyed.",1379376000,,575,3.8
