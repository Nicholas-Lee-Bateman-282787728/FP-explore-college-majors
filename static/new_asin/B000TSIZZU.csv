8210677,2,B000TSIZZU,"I sure wish there was some consistency in the ""All About:"" video series.  Some of them are pretty good.  Others are really bad.  Some are somewhat modern, some are hosted by the odd Hard Hat Harry, and some are really low budge 80's movies that should never have been turned into DVD's.

With this DVD, the Cars and Motorcycles segments are with Hard Hat Harry.  These aren't as bad as some of Harry's earlier attempts, like the firetruck and construction site.  He's a slightly better actor in these, but the kids in both segments are terrible.  They recite the lines but don't seem to know what they're actually saying.  And they definitely can't sing.  Most of Harry's lines seem unnatural, and the grammar seems a bit stilted at times.  Most of the motorcycle riders they talk to are bad actors and aren't very enthusiastic.  But overall, they're probably the most tolerable videos in the Hard Hat Harry series that I've seen.

The Train segment is another story.  This is, without a doubt, the worst video I've ever seen.  Let me see if I can describe how odd it is:  It starts out with a train sitting on the track, ringing a very loud bell repeatedly for almost a minute.  My son holds his ears through this whole part.  This annoying bell makes its appearance 5 or 6 more times throughout the video.  Then come the hosts, who are dressed as engineers.  One is a jolly guy and the other is apparently a mute who can only blow a train whistle when he wants to agree with the other guy.  The first 10 minutes of the video are monotonous shots of dirty steam trains, with that annoying bell showing up every few minutes.  There's little or no background music throughout this part, so it gets pretty boring.  Then they follow an old guy driving an old streetcar for at least 5 minutes, when only a minute would have been plenty.  Then more steam engines with loud bells. Then a few minutes of stock footage of modern trains with no dialog.  In fact, there is no dialog during the entire second half of the video.  I guess the writers ran out of ideas and just gave up.  What little narration there is in the first half doesn't really explain anything, so my son is always asking me to explain what's going on.

Then the real fun begins.  They shows some model train layouts, which are actually kind of fun for a few minutes.  Then they show a closeup of a parade of figures in one of the layouts while playing Sousa's ""Stars and Stripes Forever"", but performed by a band of kazoos.  It is one of the worst musical attempts I've ever heard: out of tune, bad balance, horrible timing.  But it'll definitely get a laugh, or at least a strange look, out of any adult who hears it.  A few more minutes of model layouts take us to the last segment.  They show a modern diesel locomotive pulling passenger cars through a depressed Appalachian coal town in Western Maryland while playing Christmas music.  After a bewildering minute they finally show you why they're playing such music:  Santa Claus is riding on the back of the train, throwing candy to all the dirty, impoverished kids who are waiting along the track and are willing to run almost into the path of the train to pick up some candy off of the creosote-covered railroad ties along with their depressed looking parents.  Based on their clothes, I'm guessing this video was filmed in the late 80's or early 90's, or maybe it's more modern than that and these people all shop at Goodwill and keep the big hair trend alive.  Following this sad display of kids fighting on the tracks for a few pieces of penny candy, they cut to several minutes of a Christmas parade, apparently in that same depressed coal town.  It starts with a really bad high school band marching through, kids on floats making faces at the camera, and Santa on a fire truck.  I have no idea what any of that has to do with trains, but I'm guessing they were running out of footage and needed a few minutes of filler to finish out the video.

By the time it's over, I'm always scratching my head and wondering why anyone would feel the need to include this video on the disc with Hard Hat Harry.  If you find this DVD for cheap somewhere, it's probably worth it for the cars and motorcycles, and you'll get a laugh out of the train segment.  Otherwise, spend you money on better productions, like the Mighty Machines series.",1231459200,3,4351,4.483460559796438
