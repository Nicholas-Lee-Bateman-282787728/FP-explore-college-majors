1707215,5,B000065B05,"The opening to ""Solange?"" has the ring of familiarity to it. The setting is outdoors on a riverbank, the characters are Elizabeth (winsome English Rose) and Enrico (passionate Italian male). The camera closes in on Elizabeth's eyes as she finally succumbs to the older man's advances when images flash suddenly across the screen - a girl running, an outstretched hand, the flash of a blade - courtesy of some seamless editing. It's an exercise in how unsettling something can be when occurring on a bright sunny day. It also employs Argento's recurrent motif of skewed perception. Elizabeth (Cristina Galb) is unsure of what she's actually seen and Enrico (Fabio Testi), exasperated by what he assumes are delay tactics, brings the boat to shore.

The following morning a body has been found on the same stretch of the Thames. A girl from Elizabeth's school has been knifed to death in a manner that will have you crossing your legs for the duration. Having left behind a piece of evidence which places him near the scene of the crime, and later caught on camera among a throng of onlookers by a TV crew covering the story, Enrico (the girls' tutor) finds himself with some explaining to do. It's not long before others fall victim to the maniac, and as pieces of the puzzle are uncovered little by little, the mystery seems tied to a particular clique of students and their association with the enigmatic girl in the title, who left the school suddenly the year before.

Right from the start we're in very assured hands. This is a giallo which pretty much has it all, balancing the stranger in a strange land figure (Enrico) compelled by circumstance to find out his own answers to a series of brutal murders by a black-gloved killer, with a police procedural element which for once is treated with absolute seriousness and a deft touch. Joachim Fuchsberger (Inspector Barth) gives arguably the best portrayal in the genre of an investigator in charge, being neither bumbling comic relief nor bullish, misogynist caricature. Everything is treated with care and reverence, relying on solid fingerprint policing rather than outlandish pseudo-science, which in itself raises the film a few notches above average. Every clue, every red herring, every motive is duly noted and accounted for and used to drive the story along a series of ever darker revelations.

Along the way, Dallamano is careful to anticipate our anticipation and gives little twists throughout to narrative and character. Enrico's wife Herta (Karin Baal) starts life almost as a parody of both the wronged wife and the Teutonic blonde (think Helga from 'allo 'allo with her blouse buttoned up) gradually becoming a more nuanced, genuinely sympathetic individual. Enrico (as the tutor engaged in an affair with one of his students) is painted in shades of grey, rather than as the complete louse we might expect, and when the illusive Solange (whose presence here is something akin to Hitchcock's ""smoking gun"") makes her entrance via a quirk of serendipity shared with the viewer alone, she resembles a pallid version of Botticelli's Venus, the subtlety of which only becomes clear with time. Even perfectly innocent London street names (""Evelyn Gardens"") take on more sinister connotations.

What impresses most is how Dallamano - mindful of his choice of victim - manages to foster a feeling of genuine shock in everyone right down to the minor players, and makes some effort to deal with the after-effects of the killings. A scene where Barth interviews the shell-shocked parents of the first girl is sensitively handled and admirably underplayed. In a neat piece of editing the father's reaction to the facts of his daughter's demise is transported into the following scene at the girl's funeral. The sleazier aspects of this ""schoolgirl slasher"" are, on the face of it at least, mitigated somewhat by the fact the schoolgirls are actually eighteen (and everyone looks about five years older than they are). The requisite nudity is largely confined to the girls' shower room, and beyond mere titillation these scenes epitomise the film's undercurrents of secrecy and confession, as the girls share whispered confidences while we are led by the camera into collusion with the local peeping tom, POV-style, through a hole in the wall.

In doing so the film points to the viewer and to itself via a form of oblique morality play. It's no coincidence that the river bank murder and Elizabeth's further recall occur during the film's two seduction scenes, symbolically the threat being as much to Elizabeth's virtue from Enrico's ardent wedding tackle (intent on a little death of its own) as much as from the killer's knife. Placed in context, ""Solange?"" is set in a period when society was still coming to grips with all the swinging that began a decade before. On the surface it's a gripping Italian thriller with all the key elements in place and where the killer's true motive holds water, but at its core it can be viewed as a subversion of the giallo genre, lamenting on innocence lost and the accelerated haste with which child becomes adult (often stumbling in the process) both then and now, leaving its audience to ponder some uncomfortable truths. This is an outstanding entry in the genre and an affecting slice of cinema with a widescreen presentation that makes the most of its outdoor settings, creating a nostalgia for a London long gone. This edition from 01 Distribution is the only version with both Italian and (nicely dubbed) English languages and is by far the best in terms of colour and picture quality.",1207785600,4,5594,4.965848452508005
1707216,4,B000065B05,"There are about eight billion giallos out there, and thanks to companies like Media Blasters, we get to see great versions of ones we've seen before and ones that never were available in the U.S. before.  Solange I had never seen until recently, but I'd say this is one of the better giallo films to come out among the many we've seen in the last few years.  While I haven't seen a giallo I though was crappy and not worth the time, some were a little more uninteresting than others.  Solange is a pretty cool murder mystery involving a killer who's modus operandi involves stabbing schoolgirls in their.....elbows.  That's it, their elbows.  A small band of schoolgirls all hide a secret that puts them in the killer's crosshairs, and the secret involves a girl names Solange(obviously).  Italian hunkster Fabio Testi is a teacher who digs chicks in uniform....schoolgirl uniforms that is.  He's the one trying to solve the case, and we all know Fabio is just the guy for this kind of thing.  Why don't you check it out?  I can't think of a reason for you not to, especially if you dig giallo films, heartbreaking romances or Death Wish 4: The Crackdown.",1156636800,4,1155,4.650246305418719
1707217,4,B000065B05,"I have seen several ""giallos"", and apart from those by Dario Argento, they can be on the most part, quite dull and routine police dramas. But ""What Have You Done To Solange"" really surprised me, in fact I would say it's the best non-Argento giallo I have ever seen. A couple taking a romantic boat ride along a river are interrupted when the young woman sees something that frightens her on the riverbank. As she is too disturbed to enjoy the boat trip any more, the afternoon ends on a sour note for the couple, only for them to find out the next day that a brutal murder was indeed commited on the riverbank. Things only get worse from then on.

What I like so much about the film is that the plot unfolds fairly and squarely before your eyes, and you get to see the clues as they appear, the same time as the investigating police do. Unlike some ""giallos"" where red herrings and ambiguity surround too much of the on-screen action, the clues here are uncovered logically, and you'll find that you take in each new turn of events with growing interest and try to unravel the mystery for yourself. The script and the plot twists are very clever. Very soon after the opening, you learn that the couple on the boat were in fact a married teacher and his female pupil in the midst of an illicit affair, which puts them in trouble straight away as they try and work out how to unravel the mystery without exposing their infidelity. Actually, that's just the very start of their troubles, and I won't reveal any more because I think that everybody should watch this film with as little prior knowledge as possible, and hopefully enjoy it as much as I did.

Beautifully filmed in stunning widescreen, actor Fabio Testi makes for a rather wooden hero, but most performances are good, including a full supporting cast of buxom school girls who put in a lot of full frontal nudity, which should please those viewers watching for some exposure of female flesh. That, and the jaw-droppingly brutal method of murder employed by the killer could have made this film totally depraved, but the stylish plot twists and interesting characters salvage it from being just another piece of Euro sleaze. Set in London, it's  particularly nice to see this film with it's soundtrack in English, and the scenes involving the police are often full of very amusing British dialogue. Conversely, Testi's character is an Italian teacher living in England, so he has an authentic sounding Italian accent...it's little things like that that make the difference. Plus watch out for a surprising and effective appearance by Camille Keaton (of ""I Spit On Your Grave"") towards the end of the film...sorry, but again I can't tell you anymore!

I would recommend this to any Euro horror or Giallo fan. It looks great, has an intrigueing plot and a satisfying explanation to round it off. You'll enjoy it all the way through. But do yourself a huge favour and avoid spoilers!!",1138492800,7,2940,4.680851063829787
1707218,5,B000065B05,A well done 'Giallo' picture. Great casting and a disturbing plot. Great atmosphere and a shocking ending in the tradition of the great Italian horror/suspense films. Highly recommended.,1129680000,2,186,5.678571428571429
1707219,5,B000065B05,"""Giallo"" films  (from the Italian for ""yellow"", referring to the yellow covers of paperback suspense novels sold in Italy) almost always center on the mysterious deaths of attractive young women.
""Solange"" is no different, but adds a startling degree of social relevance.  Made in 1971, ""Solange"" tackles the abortion legalization issue 2 years before Roe v. Wade  (a similar horror film examination of abortion is 1974's ""Black Christmas"").
This is one of the finest of the giallo genre.
The blood and gore are very minimal, though the killer's methods are positively disgusting.",1085961600,7,580,5.282608695652174
1707220,5,B000065B05,"of all the giallos i've seen in my life, this is by far my personal favorite & i've seen it nearly five times since purchasing on 01/01/04. what way to start the new year! solange has all the trappings of a wonderful classic giallo without indulging us into the graphic & extreme gore as many of the latter giallos would do. however, there is a great deal of suspense & mystery to draw you in & keep you involved til the very last scene. solange could've very well been a mainstream pyschological thriller with a bit of romantic undertone with the themes & atmosphere at hand but works well no matter genre it's filed under. the bottom line is we have gone way too long without this film & shreik show dvd has done a helluva job in presenting a crystal clear version of the classic on dvd for the entire world to see. there isn't much avaialable here in the line of extras but you do get some trailers including the original theatrical trailer for solange & there is a nice press kit included in the pack. without doubt, i feel like i got my money's worth as i usually feel when i've purchased the jean rollin films on shriek show. the story is quite complex & often eerie or seductive much like a pulp fiction paperback novel. the acting is nearly brilliant here & i can't possibly imagine any others actors who would've done a better job given the material involved. the film opens up with a creepy but cool montage of some some catholic school girls riding their bicycles across the screen in an almost blood-red lighting which basically sets us up for the chilling events which will take place in the next 104 minutes. unlike slasher films, solange offers more plot which thickens each & every second. after seeing this film, you may literally cower everytime you see a priest. GREAT FILM! i will watch this one from time to time & recommend this to everyone who loves thriller dillers or very classy horror films.",1073433600,5,1918,4.498567335243553
1707221,4,B000065B05,"Strongly plotted horror thriller, with a fine cast and excellent Ennio Morricone score.  The violence is more subdued than normal for a giallo but still graphic enough to be disturbing.  Highly recommended for all horror fans.",1059782400,3,226,5.25
1707222,2,B000065B05,"I hate giving a so-so review to a product of very good independent DVD companies. Especially those that are giving us good quality DVDs. In this case the film Solange is from a very good print and the sound is not bad. And we are now able to see another Giallo film!  The problem here is with the original film itself.  I found it to be one of the dullest of a great number of Giallos that I have seen over the years.  Granted Solange plays more like a very exploitative police case rather then a Giallo.  But the police case is uninteresting and the exploitation is obvious, not much fun, and its never scary - does anyone really want to see an old overweight woman with a blade stuck up her private area?  There are a number of scenes with showering nude school girls - but these days  - what is the point in shelling out 10 bucks for this minor titillation.  The ugly gore and nudity only has the effect of making the film seem cheesier then it need be.  We are not expected to have great acting in these films but in this case the actors seem more lame then usual -  no one seems interested in turning in a performance - good or bad - including the dubbing actors. The other big problem in this Giallo is that there is no art direction - Where is the atmosphere, the suspense, the stylized murders, the great set pieces, the interesting locations, the arty camera angles, photography, colors, cleverness and plot twists. - all the things we come to expect in these films?  The great Ennio Morricone wrote the score - but the score is not well used by the film makers. The way the score is inserted into the film makes it seem like a disconnected haphazard patchwork behind the action or an afterthought.  I cannot recommend Solange as a film but if you are a hardcore collector of Giallos, you still may want it in your collection or at least  to see it just once.  Id certainly recommend renting before buying. Media Blasters has provided the best ever presentation of this film.",1058918400,9,1984,4.387978142076503
1707223,4,B000065B05,"I had not seen this film and could find only a little information about it, but, as is often the case with obscure European horror films, my curiosity ultimately led and compelled me to purchase this DVD. Often times this sort of gamble, though relatively small, often results in big disappointments. However, it is those rare occasions when such a film either meets, or in some instances, exceeds one's expectations, that the myriad gambles and innumerable letdowns seem to disappear and it all seems worth it- What Have You Done to Solange? is this kind of film.
  To keep it short, it is a nicely photographed, well constructed film, with good performances that are only slightly marred by dubbed dialogue. The murder sequences are effective without fetishizing (too much) the gruesome details and revelling in grotesquerie, as do many films from the Italian horror scene. As for the DVD itself, the image quality is good, all things considered, and although there is little in the way of extras (apart from some trailers)there is a slick collector's booklet included. While by no means a flawless film, What Have You Done to Solange? does rank up there with other top notch giallo/horror films like Mario Bava's ""Blood and Black Lace"" and Dario Argento's ""Deep Red."" That being said, Solange is also a singular effort which should please both fans of this genre of film, and those who are merely curious. Check it out!",1030060800,,1422,4.8962655601659755
1707224,5,B000065B05,"I love Gialli movies, they are so cheesy and entertaining. As a woman, I really should be bothered by the blatant misogyny of such films, but I have been watching horror movies since I was a little girl. ""What Have You Done to Solange?"" has all of the elements of a classic giallo. Young, exposed, nubile flesh, older men courting much younger women, sadistic, sexually motivated murders, with a charming Western-European backdrop.  I highly recommend it.",1481414400,8,455,4.9868421052631575

1707227,5,B000065B05,"My friend recently got this DVD release of this film and let me borrow it. It's a great re-release after years of only having the old out of print Anchor Bay DVD available. They've done some good work on the movie and a film that already looked pretty good looks even more polished now. It great to live in a world where digital restoration is a norm.

Technical aspects aside. The movie itself is something like the nastiest epsiode of Law and Order SVU crossed with a Fellini style sense of spectacle. The plot is about a PE coach at a boarding school filled with 20 year olds pretending to be 14. Him being a middle aged but still strapping looking Fabio Testi can't help but cheat on his late 20s wife, who looks all of 5 years older than the girls, with the jail bait played by 20 year olds. It's all working out ok until those girls start showing up dead. You never see the kill but this movie has the most painful x-ray ever. It does so much with so little. This leads to a wild investigation complete with chases, pornogrpahers, cops with no sense at all, romance, more fights, more sleaze, and some gorgeously filmed on screen nastiness. The Fellini aspect is somewhat the spectacle and procession of weirdos but also the dedication to great framing and lighting. No frame of this movie is ugly.

Arrow Video has really done everyone a solid re-releasing this. Hopefully the film fan community supports it.",1470614400,2,1415,4.5234375

1707234,4,B000065B05,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

One of the joys of DVD, as Ive said many times before, is that it allows us all the opportunity to see movies that we would otherwise have no chance of seeing. It could be art films, independent films or even major foreign films that never make it to the states. In addition to these opportunities it is an even bigger joy when one of these films makes its way via Arrow Video. No, they aren't paying me to say this. Aside from Criterion Arrow Video releases some great movies in blu-ray format that have been cleaned to perfection with actual extras that matter and never overdo. Take for instance this film, an Italian giallo film that has all the elements and keeps you guessing until the end as to whodunit.

The film stars Fabio Testi as Enrico Rosseni, a teacher at a Catholic girls school. The film opens with Enrico lazily rowing down the river with his girlfriend Elizabeth. Out of the corner of her eye Elizabeth thinks she sees something in the woods on the bank. Enrico thinks she is just trying to put him off as shes done in the past. A short time later we discover that Elizabeth is a student of Enricos who is going to graduate soon.

Enrico has set up an apartment for the two of them, a love nest if you will. Hes done so because he is still married to Herta, another teacher at the school. While the couple still live together their marriage is a shambles and a split is imminent. Herta knows something is going on but the couples confrontations on the subject are more subdued than one would think they would be.

Problems arise when girls from the school are found murdered, the first being what Elizabeth caught out of the corner of her eye. As an eye witness, the police try to press her for more information but it all comes back to her slowly. When Elizabeth is found murdered as well, Enrico become the number one suspect. With all revealed he loses his job and now has a second reason to want to find out who the killer is. We know hes innocent, having seen the killer dressed in priests garb, but how will he change the mind of the police inspector?

As the clues begin to mount and Enrico, with the help of Herta, proves his innocence, just who is responsible continues to remain a mystery. With each new death the list of suspects seems to grow rather than dwindle. The reasons why these murders are happening and the final assortment of clues come late in the film but hints were there all along. In the end it is a satisfying conclusion.

The movie itself is a great mystery based on a novel by Edgar Wallace. As I said the clues are provided for the most part but the final items necessary to find the killer aren't all in place until the last portion of the film. The acting is better than many movies faced with a transition from one culture/language to another. While the differences in the way Italian films are made from how they're done in America is obvious, in this case it is never in a fashion that makes the film difficult to follow.

Arrow has turned in a fantastic looking version of the movie. In addition to presenting it in a clean print it offers the following extras:

-Original Italian and English soundtracks in mono audio (uncompressed PCM on the Blu-ray)
-Newly translated subtitles for the Italian soundtrack
-Optional English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing for the English soundtrack
-Brand new audio commentary with critics Alan Jones and Kim Newman
-Newly filmed cast interviews
-Original Theatrical Trailer
-A reversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by MALLEUS
-A booklet featuring brand new writing on the film, illustrated with original stills

If you love giallo films, if you love Italian made movies or if you love a great mystery then this is a movie worth seeking out. For film collectors you're offered a great version of the film done with loving care. If youve never ventured into watching an Italian made film this would be a good way to start. And if you aren't familiar with Arrow Video now is your chance to see why they are one of the better DVD companies out there.",1453334400,6,4137,4.527443105756359

1707236,5,B000065B05,"Massimo Dallamanos1972 giallo What Have You Done To Solange? was previously released on DVD by Media Blasters. That disc has been out of print for a while but the film is no back in circulation and looking better than ever thanks to Arrows new Blu-ray release, restored from the original camera negative.

The film follows a London high school teacher named Henry Rossini (Fabio Testi). He works at a boarding school for girls, the same school that employs his wife, Herta (Karin Baal). The spark in their marriage, however, is long gone as is made evident when we learn that Henry is having an affair with one of the students, the beautiful Elizabeth (Cristina Galbo). While flitting about with Henry, Carol witnesses the murder of a fellow student in the park at night. Fearful for her life, she flees but soon enough, the same killer begins picking off other members of the student body in increasingly grisly fashion and Henry is, in the eyes of some, the prime suspect

Beautifully shot by none other than Joe DAmato and set to one of Ennio Morricones finest early seventies scores, What Have You Dont To Solange? might not be the fastest paced giallo ever made but stick with it, it builds beautifully. Based on a novel written by none other than Edgar Wallace, the plot is careful with its character development, pulling us further into Henrys rather sordid little world so that once he seems to be on the hook for all of this, it winds up making sense that hed need to resort to some unorthodox measures to clear his name. The fact that his wife, who he is clearly cheating on behind her back, helps him out in this measure is maybe a bit of a stretch but outside of that there aren't a whole lot of logic gaps here, the story plays it pretty straight and its all the better for it.

And then theres that ending wow. Even if youve seen this one before, the finale still packs a serious punch. But we won't go there.

The performances are also quite good. Karin Baal is well cast as Harrys German wife. Shes definitely been given the short end of the stick as far as their relationship goes and Baal plays the part well, she looks the part too. Cristina Galbo is beautiful here but more than just a pretty face, her performance is also quite good. Shes convincing enough in the part to work. Testi is the one who really stands out, however. Hes really strong here, running through a reasonably large gamut of emotions before the movie is finished and handling all of it quite easily. Also be on the lookout for a supporting performance from I Spit On Your Graces own Camille Keaton.

Arrow offers up What Have You Done To Solange? In a brand new 2K restoration of the film from the original camera negative in AVC encoded 1080p high definition framed at 2.35.1 widescreen. It looks, in a word, fantastic. Detail is vastly improved over the past DVD release while texture and color reproduction get appreciable bumps in quality as well. Theres nice depth here and the black levels are strong. Compression artifacts, edge enhancement and noise reduction are never obvious problems  yeah, this looks really, really good on Blu-ray. Nice and clean too, no real print damage worth noting.

Italian and English language options are provided in LPCM Mono with optional newly translated subtitles provided for the Italian option and closed captioning provided for the English option. Both tracks are clean, clear and nicely balanced. No problems with any hiss or distortion, decent range and depth for mono tracks. The subtitles are also clear, easy to read and free of any typos.

Extras start out with a new audio commentary from film critics Alan Jones and Kim Newman, both pros at this type of thing and very well versed in horror history, particularly of the Italian variety. As such, its no surprise that this commentary hits all the right notes. They talk about the history of the film, the state of the Italian film industry of the time and the giallo cycle of which Solange was a part. They also talk about the directors other pictures and offer up plenty of interesting facts and trivia about the cast, the crew, the locations and quite a bit more. There was clearly quite a bit of research put into this, its a solid discussion of the picture that moves at a good pace.

There are also a few newly filmed cast interviews, starting with the thirteen minute featurette What Have You Done to Decency? which is an interview with Karin Baal. She doesnt mix words about her thoughts on the storyline and the films content and she also shares some amusing stories about her experiences working on the movie. Fabio Testi shows up for a twenty-one minute piece called The First Action Here. He speaks at length about his experiences on set, his thoughts on the film (quite the opposite of Baals!) and the different cast members her interacted with while in the eleven minute Old School Producer we spend some time with Fulcio Lucisano who speaks about Massimo Dallamano and his thoughts on the production. Topping this off is an interesting visual essay from Michael MacKenzie called Innocense Lost that does a fine job of putting the movie into context by exploring the politics of Italy and the intricacies of its film scene during the period when this and other giallos were riding high on a wave of popularity.

What Have You Done To Solange? is a gripping thriller ripe with style and suspense. Its nicely paced, beautifully shot and it features a fantastic Ennio Morricone score to complement a few really strong performances from the cast. Arrows Blu-ray release presents the movie in its high definition debut in very fine form indeed and it comes highly recommended to any fan of giallo or Eurocult cinema.",1451692800,4,5716,4.69560878243513
1707237,4,B000065B05,"Nice giallo with a script that is actually thought through (even though some coincidences are just too elaborate to be true) and makes sense from beginning to end, giving the audience the clues only by and by instead of presenting just a host of suspicious characters and then coming up with a solution that has the least suspicious person actually be the culprit (""I never thought that he ...""). Actually, in this one, the key to the mystery is not presented until about halfway through the movie (though it  is hidden in the title quite obviously), thus it keeps the story/mystery moving forwards instead of circling around a center of suspects making every one of them look like the guilty party at a time (not that there would be necessarily anything wrong with that). Now add to that an elegant direction, some sexy bits, the right amount of shocks and suspense, and a competent cast, and you've got yourself a pretty good movie.",1451692800,,934,4.730061349693251
1707238,4,B000065B05,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

When it comes to 70s horror, the more I watch, the more I like.  Aside from the fact that was the decade in which I was born, the 70s played an instrumental part in defining what horror is today.  And thanks to excellent companies like Arrow Video and MVD Distribution, who are working to preserve many of these classics in HD, fans will have many more opportunities to enjoy these titles over the years.

WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO SOLANGE? is considered by many to be an iconic film for the giallo genre, and thus a foundation for slashers to come.  And although the title might sound peculiar, the film itself is a solid entry into the horror canon of cinema.

I confess this film starts off a bit slow, but about halfway through it really picks up steam.  And because it only clocks in at 1 hour 42 minutes, the slow parts don't eat up too much of the viewers time.  For this reason, I am classifying this movie as slow-burn horror.

WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO SOLANGE? is shot well and looks fine onscreen.  The film is obviously dated, but the new 2K restoration of the film from the original camera negative looks great nonetheless.

The acting is very good, with a talented cast headlined by Fabio Testi.  This film is also the debut of actress Camille Keaton, who would later go on to star in one of the most controversial films of all time, I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE (aka DAY OF THE WOMAN).  Testi and Keaton are supported by some great talent that includes Cristina Galbo, Joachim Fuchsberger, Marco Mariani, and Karin Baal.

The special effects in WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO SOLANGE? are minimal but effective.  There are a few scenes that show a knife embedded in the vaginas of the victims, and this is well done for the most part (again, taking the films age into consideration).

The story is a bit slow, as mentioned above, but when it finally takes off, it vamps up nicely.  I particularly like the big reveal because the identity of the killer threw me off.  I was not expecting this person, so it is a nice twist.

WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO SOLANGE? is another great win for Arrow Video and MVD Distribution, and I highly recommend it.  In addition to the film, this 2-disc collection contains a bunch of nice features that include:

* Brand new 2K restoration of the film from the original camera negative

1707239,3,B000065B05,"What Have You Done to Solange? falls into the category of giallo  the 20th-century Italian slasher genre, usually with mystery elements and often with either supernatural horror or crime fiction elements. Enrico (Fabio Testi), a married teacher, is having an affair with one of his students, Elizabeth (Christine Galbo). On a romantic boat ride along a river, Elizabeth sees something on the bank that frightens her. They find out the next day that a brutal murder was committed in that location. After several more women are killed, the police begin to suspect that Enrico is the murderer. The women being targeted share a secret that marks them as the murderers intended victims.

The quality of giallo films varies. Some can be dull, others repetitious, and still others just poorly made. What Have You Done to Solange? is among the better pictures of this genre. Performances are above average and the story holds our attention as it sustains an effective level of suspense throughout. It contains a creepy murderer with a bizarre fetish, and the overall tone is extremely dark. Dont look for happy endings in this one. The score by Ennio Morricone is lush and beautifully sets the mood for this Jack the Ripper-inspired picture.

Bonus materials on the Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack include a booklet featuring brand new writing on the film, illustrated with original stills; reversible sleeve with original and newly commissioned artwork; original theatrical trailer; audio commentary by film critics; newly filmed cast interviews; and original Italian and English soundtracks in mono audio.

THE FILM - [ 4 / 5 ]:

From director Massimo Dallamano, cinematographer on both ""A Fistful of Dollars"" and ""For a Few Dollars More,"" comes giallo classic ""What Have You Done to Solange?,"" which features the debut feature of actress Camille Keaton (I Spit on Your Grave).

A sexually sadistic killer is preying on the girls of St. Marys school. Student Elizabeth witnessed one of the murders, but her hazy recollections of a knife-wielding figure in black do nothing to further the polices investigations. Why is the killer choosing these young women? And what does it have to do with a girl named Solange?

Also starring Cristina Galbo (Living Dead at the Manchester Morgue) and Fabio Testi (I Spit On Your Grave), ""What Have You Done with Solange?"" features all the hallmarks of classic gialli  the amateur detective, the black-gloved killerl  as well as a lush score from Ennio Morricone.

""What Have You Done to Solange?"" is a wonderful entry in the catalog of giallo films. The film is likely to evoke a number of emotions from its viewer over the course of the film. Whether it makes you wince in phantom pain thanks to how some of the murders occur, curiosity of the question posed by the title of the film or confusion as to the killers identity. The film is sure to keep you guessing, which is part of the fun after all. You may find a sense of relief at the end of the film and experience a few ""ah hah"" moments. Solange does a terrific job of keeping you guessing and throwing several red herrings at its audience to further complicate matters.

The actors do a nice job of conveying emotions with their characters despite the dubbing process throwing things off a bit. Ennio Morricone's magical score further adds to the mood of the film in a number of ways. Solange features great cinematography with some really gorgeous shots. Combine that with this impressive Blu-ray from Arrow Video and you have yourself a winner.

AUDIO - [ 4.5 / 5 ]:

""What Have You Done to Solange?"" comes with both English and Italian DTS-HD Master Audio Mono tracks for their respective ""versions."" Each also includes English subtitles. If you are new to this film and wonder if the film is out of sync, it is not. Often the case of Italian films during this time, the audio was added later and dubbed. Sometimes the films feature the actual actors voices, still dubbed. Sometimes they don't. The audio tracks for the film sounded great. The dialogue was quite clear and the sound effects sounded crisp and precise. The music in the film masterly handled by Ennio Morricone, did as usual, a superb job at creating and helping elevate the mood of the scenes whether they they are playful and light, tense or melodic and haunting. The track maintained a good balance throughout the film and the volume level seemed very consistent. I noticed no issues with the audio while watching the film in either language.

VIDEO - [ 4.5 / 5 ]:

""What Have You Done to Solange?"" arrives on Blu-ray thanks to the folks at Arrow Video via a new 2K restoration from the original camera negative. The film is presented in 1080p with a 2.35:1 Aspect Ratio. Arrow Video has again done a great job, this time with a brand new master and the results certainly appear to be well worth it. The picture quality is excellent with a generous amount of detail present throughout and an increased amount of fine detail in close up shots. Colors looked fairly strong and bold despite the slightly subdued look that often accompanies films of that era. Contrast levels appear to be very good. Skin tones have a natural appearance and black levels looked good as well. Film grain seems to have been handled very well and never appears to be overly heavy or blocky. The film looks beautiful and everyone who purchases the Arrow Video release should be pleasantly pleased and perhaps surprised by how well the film looks thanks to the new high definition master.

SPECIAL FEATURES - [ 5 / 5 ]:

Audio Commentary - This commentary features Alan Jones, film critic, broadcaster and author of the book ""Dario Argento: The Man, the Myths & the Magic"" and film critic Kim Newman. The duo do a fantastic job dissecting the film and it is mentioned how this may be more of an anti-giallo which an interesting take on the film. They give some insightful information about the cast, crew and the film. The pair discuss similarities between ""What Have You Done to Solange?"" and other giallo films such as ""The Bird With the Crystal Plumage"" and ""Blood and Black Lace."" Casual viewers may not get much out of this commentary but if you are a fan of the genre, I think you will thoroughly enjoy listening to this track.

What Have You Done to Decency?  (13:38) - An interview with actress Karin Baal (Herta), filmed in Berlin October 2015. Ms. Baal is very honest as she discusses the film and gives her thoughts on it which seems pretty clear she wasn't very fond of some of the scenes in the film. She shares an interesting story about how Fabio Testi sometimes didn't know his lines and would just move his lips since the film was being dubbed, which was occurred frequently at the time. (with English subtitles)

First Action Hero (21:17) - An interview with actor Fabio Testi (Enrico), filmed in Rome in 2006. He talks about the cast and crew of the film including director Massamo Dallamano. Fabio speaks briefly about the dubbing process of the film. He speaks fondly of his time while making the movie and also talks about some other films he has worked on, as well as how he liked to drastically vary the type of roles he would play in order to keep things exciting and new. (with English subtitles)

Old-School Producer (11:02) - An interview with producer Fulvio Lucisano, filmed in Rome in 2006. He talks about working with Massamo Dallamano, and other members of the cast and crew including Ennio Morricone. Fulvio touches on the films production and its box office performance. A few pictures from the films premiere are shown during the interview which was a nice little bonus. (with English subtitles)

Innocence Lost (29:00) - A brand new visual essay by Michael Mackenzie who explores the themes of Solange and its two semi-sequels in the ""Schoolgirls in Peril' trilogy. A note appears that warns viewers that the featurette contains spoilers for several films. The bulk of the time is spent discussing and dissecting the film. Mr. Mackenzie does also of course talk about several other giallo films. Watching and listening to this essay was a real treat and it left me wanting more. It wasn't long before I wished it was a much longer documentary on the genre. Very informative with loads of information, giallo fans will want to fully dive in to this excellent extra.

Trailer (3:05)

Reversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by MALLEUS.

Booklet featuring brand new writing on the film, illustrated with original stills.

DVD

IN CONCLUSION:

Once again Arrow Video puts on a show as to how to properly bring a film to high definition with a beautiful looking Blu-ray that sounds great as well. Add in some very high quality special features and Arrow Video scores again with this wonderful Blu-ray and DVD combo pack release. Fans of the film will not want to hesitate adding this to their collection and I would suggest that those unfamiliar with the film, acquaint themselves with this giallo as I wholeheartedly recommend it.

1707241,5,B000065B05,This is a sound transfer to disc of an exquisite giallo. It's an exciting film and filled with mystery. Haunting.,1355011200,,113,4.7
1707242,4,B000065B05,"Ennio Moricone's score alone makes WHYDTS worth a viewing, but the film is actually more interesting and more sophisticated than a majority of films of the time. That being said, there are trappings of the genre that this film does not entirely escape. The mystery is deep rooted in the film and once you find out you will feel silly for trying to guess because it is something that doesn't readily come to mind. The one drawback is when everyday players decide to take the law into their own hands and become shrewd detectives. That happens here. The effects are not disastrous, but verge on laughable. This is a fun exercise in secrets, perversion, mystery, and exploitation. It may not be a bloody and brutal, though not for the faint of heart, What Have You Done to Solange? is a substantial giallo in so many ways.",1301961600,3,819,4.616438356164384
1707243,5,B000065B05,"""What Have You Done To Solange?"" is one of the greatest entries in the Italian Giallo genre.  It has everything that a giallo should have including a suspenseful, intricately woven plot:  A black-gloved killer is stabbing to death beautiful girls at a Catholic high school in London.  How are the deaths connected?  Most importantly, who is the mysterious Solange and what happened to her?  If you like movies centered around vigilante justice or revenge, you will enjoy this feature from director Massimo Dallamano (who also directed the sequel, ""What Have They Done to Your Daughters?"")

  ""What Have You Done to Solange"" has a great cast of actors that includes Italian hunk Fabio Testi who is the star of numerous crime dramas and Italian Spaghetti Westerns (Lucio Fulci`s ""Four of the Apocalypse""); Testi is a teacher at the high school and is the number one suspect.  He is having an affair with one of his pupils, Christina Galbo.  (Galbo is one of my favorite euro babes.  She is the star of such Spanish horror fare as ""The House That Screamed"" and ""Let Sleeping Corpses Lie;"" she also starred in the Italian giallo, ""The Killer Must Kill Again."")  A young, child-like Camille Keaton (niece of Buster Crabbe) is Solange; she later became the star of the notorious ""I Spit On Your Grave.""

  A haunting score is provided by Ennio Morricone who has provided the scores for over 400 movies in his long, illustrious career.  (Read the collectable booklet that is inside the DVD case.).  Despite the beautiful scenery, the film is dark and depressing.  The ending is tragic and will stay with you long after the movie is over.  It reminded me of the ending for ""Watch Me When I Kill,"" another giallo favorite of mine involving revenge.

  If you enjoy gialli that take place at a private girls' school, you will also want to see Narcisco Ibanez Serrador's uncut masterpiece of ""The House That Screamed"" (not the Elvira version) and Antonio Margheriti's ""Naked You Die.""

  Shriek Show, as always, has done a wonderful job of restoring ""What Have You Done To Solange?""  My only regret is that it doesn't contain the original Italian audio with English subtitles.  The Amazon listing is wrong.  At the price of $24.95, you think it would have.  Shriek Show's release of ""A Lizard in a Woman's Skin"" had the Italian audio with English subtitles.

  ""What Have You Done To Solange"" is highly recommended for anyone who loves Italian gialli.  In my opinion, it ranks up there with Dario Argento's ""Deep Red,"" Emilio Miraglia's ""The Red Queen Kills 7 Times,"" and Sergio Martino's ""Torso.""",1209859200,4,2586,4.844393592677346

Lots of nice music by Ennio Morricone as well. The film has a stronger focus on the mystery and plot rather than the murders themselves, and is largely populated by dialogue-driven intrigue scenes. I may have liked it a bit more if there had been a greater emphasis on style and atmosphere rather than plot, but that's more a matter of taste than a criticism of the film itself.

Director Massimo Dallamano achieves a beautifully balanced 'Giallo' affair by combining enough plot intrigue along with Ennio Morricone's light yet lovely score to keep things moving along. I had thought to have figured out the plot early on, only to be mildly surprised by the ending... not bad. This is a well planned and executed murder mystery flick, it's stylish with well framed shots and great camera work. The casting is good and the actors deliver enough to sustain a moderate level of suspense.

I don't like to give away much in reviews, but the implied graphic nature of the murders seems more logical by the end of the movie unlike most western mass murder flicks... which seem baseless and purely psychopathic in nature.",1492473600,2,876,5.083333333333333
