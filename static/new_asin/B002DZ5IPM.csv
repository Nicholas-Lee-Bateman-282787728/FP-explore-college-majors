8588082,3,B002DZ5IPM,Enjoyable but disappointing.  These are edited episodes ( i assume for space). Would have been much better as a compilation with one set of credits instead (there's like 15 mins worth it seems). Most obvious edit is Dusty's medly is chopped in half :-(,1453593600,,252,4.7272727272727275
