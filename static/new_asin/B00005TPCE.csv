1662306,2,B00005TPCE,"I was disappointed with this anime, it was only 60 minutes long and even though I knew that and expected there to be some sacrafice of story, I felt like there was virtually no story at all.  Be prepared for lots of cheesy anime cliches, pointless dialouge, and to be confused by mostly everything.  I won't say that it was a total waste of time to watch it, the art was decent, the voice acting was okay, and the characters had the potential to be really cool... but they weren't.  If there was more development of the characters, and more explanation of what was going on and why, this could have been better.  I would suggest renting this if possible and not spending the money on it when you could get something else for your money.",1011139200,5,736,4.389705882352941

7953814,3,B00005TPCE,not the show i expected could use a lot of work but due to its age it will prob. just fade to extinction,1414195200,,104,3.5652173913043477
7953815,3,B00005TPCE,"I remembered it being more funny than it actually was. I watched this for the first time with my friend years ago, and in a fit of nostalgia decided to buy it again.

Honestly, with so few episodes on it it's not worth all that much unless you're a fan of the Sorcerer Hunters universe and just want a little more fan-stuff. I think you MIGHT crack a smile once or twice (if you're over the age of 15--anything under and I would assume you'd laugh like crazy) but otherwise, don't get your hopes up.

Spec-wise, the animation is rather clean and there weren't too many issues with it. It certainly does leave you wondering what will happen (unfortunate, as this is the only DVD ever made for this particular storyline)",1220140800,,718,4.473282442748092
7953816,5,B00005TPCE,"I can't believe someone actually had this DVD, it is absolutely wonderful! I'm so happy to finally have it!",1180396800,,107,4.684210526315789
7953817,4,B00005TPCE,"I saw these a long time ago and enjoyed them then. I still do. It's actually kinda fun and the whole business with the red light district and Chivas and the Nun (I can never remember her name) having the intial same response, and then he grins and she wilts. I love it.

Tongue in cheek!",1176076800,,287,4.125
7953818,4,B00005TPCE,"Sorcerer on The Rocks isn't for those of you who happen to take offense to a lot of things. it's totally irreverent to almost any of the traditional fantasy mythos. As advertised, the hero, Shibas Scotch, is a jackass. If you're into rude humor he's your new hero. Gin Fizz is more of a target for all of Shibas's disgruntled nature than anything else, Kiss is just fanservice, and Gembi is just there because let's face it, Shibas needed SOMEONE to beat up on.

Plenty of fanservice nudity, nobody's denying that, but they don't give it credit for being funny. Sure there are some objectionble bits (assuming you have morals at all) but they're mostly small things like Shibas smoking, or a lengthy sight gag concerning the Red Light District in town.

If you're the irreverent sort, I'd highly recommend this one. If you're the kind of person who deeply supports the MPAA's oversensitive ratings scale, then don't bother, you'll just be offended.",1104796800,4,948,4.809815950920245
7953819,4,B00005TPCE,"I'm going to name the goods and bads of this anime.
Goods: Its from the guys who did Sorcerer Hunters.  This had a lot of SH type of humor and some connections to it(world-wise).  The comedy is also pretty well done.  Love that *beep* joke.  No I'm not censoring myself.  There is also somewhat of a similarity to Bastard in here in that Shibas and Dark Schneider are both perverted ... kickers.
Bads: TOO SHORT.  There can't be just two episodes, can there?  Can there?  Plus I didn't approve of them ending it with such a hokey ending.  Plus, there was actually some unnecessary nudity.  Yes that's right, UNNECESSARY.
Other than that, this is a cool anime.  If you can find it cheap, you won't be disappointed.
And to all you dissing it, why don't ya just remember its from SH's creators?!  They like doing perverted, funny, cool stuff.",1018483200,6,839,4.557046979865772
7953820,1,B00005TPCE,"I'm tempted to give this one extra star just for the cleverness by which I was tricked into buying it, but I won't.  Sorcerer on the Rocks is identified as a side story to Sorcerer Hunters.  I suppose technically, that's true, as it's set in the same world, but nothing of the good-natured humor or likeable characters carried over.  I liked Sorcerer Hunters a lot; I hate this.
Essentially, this is the story of an abusive sorcerer, Shibas Scotch, who hunts down other sorcerers for money.  In his service are a werewolf elf girl, a swordsman, and a nun (who wants to redeem him).  The whole story is just so mean-spirited as to be worthless.  There's no reason to care about any of these people, but plenty of reasons to wish they'd all just be killed so the disc would end.  Even the nun, who is almost likeable, is so pathetically weak and wimpy as to be just as annoying as Shibas.  The nun is abused constantly, yet we are clearly meant to believe she's going to fall in love with Shibas.  In that sense, Sorcerer on the Rocks is a triumph of wretchedness: not only are the characters repulsive and the plot non-existent, they picked the most vile of cliches (girls falls for her abuser) as the centerpiece of the character interaction.
Avoid this disc like the plague.  Once you start watching, the only reason to keep watching is to see if it gets any worse.  It does.",1011916800,6,1376,4.485943775100401
