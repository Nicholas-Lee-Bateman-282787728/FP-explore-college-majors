We watched this in my geography class. It provides great information about Antarctica-Pouring cereal outside blows it away, it stays light all night, and there IS a striped pole at the South Pole! Other information:
Meteorites are easy to see in Antarctica because they can be seen on ice and don't deteriorate
A sun cup is a dent from a meteorite
Ice sheets flow outward from the south pole
Ice is almost 2 miles thick at the south pole
Exobiology is the study of lifeforms not on earth
Amundsen reached the south pole first
Fuel is $200 a gallon
Richard Byrd left a rock with an american flag
Amundsen,Scott research station is a dome
People can run around the world
Although, like all educational videos, it has cheesy music, this is very entertaining and informative.",1083888000,,788,4.676258992805756
