I was attracted to this collection mostly because of the price.  Four feature-length films in one tidy package for the price of one was just too hard to past up.  I was pleased, however, when I enjoyed each film as I watched it in turn.  The stories, the production value, and even the acting is really top shelf quality.

A word of warning: if you are into J-horror because of deeply disturbing tales (such as Juon) or for goreporn to laugh at with your friends (such as The Machine Girl), these films may not be for you.  While frightening in their own way, they tend to be a bit more subdued and intellectual in nature.  Not everything that comes out of Japan needs to be wacky and over-the-top to be enjoyed and, if you can accept that, you would do will to add this collection to your horror library.",1374192000,,1069,4.589473684210526
8160150,5,B000L43P9S,"I love it because four different short horror stories.  Not too short and not too long.  Usually, most of the Japanese horror movies don't make sense in the end, but I like these stories.  Some of them a have a little bit of the Japanese superstitions and craziness!",1357430400,,266,4.5
8160151,1,B000L43P9S,"If your a fan of Japanese horror, then stay away from this. If your a fan of laughing at really bad Japanese horror, then stay away from this. If your a fan of bad Japanese horror that you cant even laugh at because its more pathetic then funny, then this is your ticket! 4 movies that will suck the fun right out of living!",1257206400,,324,4.078125
8160152,2,B000L43P9S,"INUGAMI shouldn't even be in this collection. It's more a supernatural drama than anything, and the only real horror is the amount of inbreeding that goes on in this movie. Creeepeeee...

ISOLA deals with multiple personalities, and ultimately veers off into ""The Outer Limits"" territory and disappears into the lower B MOVIE constellation.

SHIKOKU has to have one of the oddest ghost girls of recent memory. She's not scary at all. That's not good. It's like trying to be scared of a Helo Kitty doll.

SHADOW OF THE WRAITH works, to a point. It delivers two stories involving the japanese ""Hardy Boys"" who unfotunately have to deal with ghost stalkers and haunted apartments. The haunted apartment story is particularly scary. Watch it ALL THE WAY TO THE END.",1241481600,2,761,4.9296875
8160153,5,B000L43P9S,"I bought this thinking it was just one dvd, but I was astounded that it contained 4 feature length films. I really liked how it was set up, each in a slim case.",1216512000,5,160,3.878787878787879
8160154,2,B000L43P9S,"The Japanese have a special talent for creating good horror, usually centered on horrific ghosts and unhappy outsiders -- nice cultural overtones there.

But the ""Kadokawa Horror Collection"" contains four of the more lackluster examples of the J-Horror genre -- ""Shadow of the Wraith,"" ""Inugami,"" ""Isola"" and ""Shikoku."" These movies are vaguely amusing in a brain candy kind of way -- pretty ordinary low-grade horror at best, dull and incoherent at worst.

""Shikoku"" features a young trio: Hinako, Sayori and their mutual crush Fumiya were inseparable as children, until Hinako moved away. Now ten years have passed, and Hinako (Yui Natsukawa) returns to the old hometown -- but she finds that Sayori (Chiaki Kuriyama) drowned some years before, and Fumiya (Michitaka Tsutsui) is still haunted by her presence.

But ghosts are rising around the town, and a muttering old priestess is making her rounds, reversing the seals on temples -- and breaking down the barrier between life and death. As Fumiya and Hinako start to fall in love, Hinako begins seeing Sayori's apparition -- and finds that Sayori's mother is determined to bring her daughter back to life.

""Inugami"" are a problem in the sleepy village where middle-aged Miki Bonomiya (Yuki Amami) has buried her tragic youth. But all that changes when teacher Akira Nutahara (Atsuro Watabe) arrives at the village, and the two quickly fall in love. Suddenly Miki is acting oddly, and strange deaths are occurring around the village -- supposedly by the ""inugami,"" dog spirits that the Bonomiya women control.

Miki is blamed for these, and the village begins to turn against the Bonomiyas -- and the Bonomiyas start to turn against each other, with madness and suicide. Akira is desperate to get his beloved out of the village, but can he fight against the entire Bonomiya clan -- and against the shocking connection he has with Miki?

""Shadow of the Wraith"" is sort of a Japanese version of teenybopper horror vehicles -- two supernatural thrillers, loosely connected by a pair of glossy pop-star siblings. Think Nick and Aaron Carter in a horror movie. It's a pretty lame connection, and the music isn't anything to write home about either.

In the first, school hottie/budding popster Ryoji is doing quite nicely, until a shy, creepy girl develops a crush on him. Turns out the girl has some nasty supernatural powers, and is quite happy to use them to make him her own. In the second story, we have Ryoji's brother dealing with a ""Ju-On"" style haunted house.

""Isola"" opens with the aftermath of an earthquake; one person staying there is Yukari, a young woman who can read minds, but is fearful of the misery the voices in her head cause her. She helps out at a local shelter, and rooms with a counselor, Hiroko, who accidentally introduces her to something pretty horrible.

Through Hiroko, Yukari encounters a young woman who has suffered from multiple personality syndrome ever since her parents' death. As in all other movies with multiple personalities, one of them is murderous -- Isola. But is Isola just a part of the girl, or is it a vengeful spirit... or something?

""Isola"" is undoubtedly the best of the bunch, possessing a halfway coherent storyline and some creepy moments. And it must be confessed that all of these are easy on the eyes -- ""Inugami"" and ""Shikoku"" have exquisite scenery, full of moonlit groves and misty mountains. And ""Shadow of the Wraith"" has some very attractive young men.

But good looking scenery (and men) is all the movies have going for them -- the plots are totally incoherent, except for ""Isola,"" which which was based on a book (thankfully, considering how the others turned out). So those plots are spiced up with incest, impalements, and high school melodrama. Even the horror isn't very horrific -- the occasional gory death, but the ghosts aren't even very scary.

What's more, the unimpressive storylines aren't helped by the dialogue or direction. Dialogue is unimpressive, and the  direction is an odd mix -- if they're not imitating Hideo Nakata, they're imitating giallo. And having one of the movies showcase some wooden pop stars is the final nail in the coffin... and that's before they start singing.

""Kadokawa Horror Collection"" contains some movies that could have been great, but are either incoherent, obtuse, or simply annoying. Pass this one by, except for maybe ""Isola.""",1171584000,16,4397,4.9890710382513666
