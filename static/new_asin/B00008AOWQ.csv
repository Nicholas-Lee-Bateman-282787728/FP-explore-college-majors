1833957,3,B00008AOWQ,"I haven't seen the DVD version, but if Alec Baldwin is narrating it I won't bother buying it.  He is living proof that every village does indeed have its own idiot, and that he should count for 2.  He is living proof that devolution does indeed occur!  For the money that he was paid, one would think that he would at least try to sound 1) interested and 2) somewhat able to pronounce the words he is paid to say into the camera.  Why couldn't Kenneth Branagh narrate this episode of the Walking series?  We know that he is an actor, and not a scientist, but he 1) sounds interested and 2) correctly pronounces the names of the creatures he is talking about.  Branagh's entertainment background makes the series much more palatable and enjoyable.  Baldwin comes across like the village idiot trying to read a primer aloud when he is known to be totally illiterate.  His narration is tawdry and strained.  Baldwin makes Branagh look like a Rhodes Scholar.  What is so hard about saying ""Australopithecus Afarensis"" correctly?  Apparently it was past Baldwin's obviously limited skills.  At least he isn't reprising Hamlet!  I really liked the material presented, even though Bobo the Chimp could have done it better than blithering Baldwin, and was quite pleasantly surprised that the BBC has made an often esoteric subject interesting and approachable.  Both my children (both under 7) loved the previous Walking DVD's and I am looking forward to purchasing the latest one.  My only other minor disappointment is that the producers seem to have rushed through this installment as it was only 2 hours in length.  I think that when dealing with such an important area of the past of our species, more should be covered and in greater depth, and without the distraction of a has-been actor who hasn't enough professionalism to do his homework beforehand, and who appears as though he is narrating some seedy reality show rather than well researched and produced programming that directly reflects the past of humankind.  As a teacher, I have used the previous Walking videos extensively, but am really leery about using this one, as I will have to narrate over the blithering one to correct his mispronunciation of every faintly relevant scientific term.",1056672000,10,2251,4.897097625329815
1833958,5,B00008AOWQ,"I hate to criticize the Discovery Channel, but what programming executive ape decided they needed to dumb-down and Americanize this excellent documentary? The original BBC version, which is what you get here,is vastly superior to the Discovery Channel broadcast of June 15th, 2003.  The different vignettes are longer, better narrated (by a British narrator, not Alec Baldwin) and have a real cinematic kind of feeling almost totally missing from the rushed along, tightly edited version we saw on tv.  In fact, after viewing this DVD, the Discovery broadcast seems like a mere infomercial for this longer, better version.  If you liked what you saw on Discovery, I highly recommend this DVD.  It's like watching WWC again for the first time.",1055894400,52,742,5.158333333333333
1833959,3,B00008AOWQ,"When watching ""Walking With Cavemen"" which is a very-well produced educational film - I could not help but laugh every time Alec Baldwin appeared on camera.  There's just something so goofy about him - that you half expect, at any moment, he will drop a 2 million year old skull smashing it into 10,000 pieces.
And that hair of his!  Can you imagine how much more entertaining this film would be if each succeeding proto-human species donned a hair style that was slowly, inexorably, evolving to look like Alec Baldwin's?
""And here's Cro-Magnon Man, whose demise would have come eons earlier had it not been for the fantastic hair styling technique they developed 200,000 years ago.  A hair style that is still widely in use today..."", as Mr. Baldwin winks at the camera.

1833961,5,B00008AOWQ,"I am a fan of Professor Robert Winston and his ""Walking with..."" series of documentaries.  This is in the process of being shown on TV at this moment in the UK and all I can say it is better than I expected.  Using real actors and actresses, amazing make-up and special effects, Professor Winston takes us through the lives and times of our remote caveman ancestors, starting with ""Lucy"" who was more ape than human and ending at a pathway that would eventually lead to us, Homo Sapiens.
It is a fascinating insight to what might have been.  Of course a lot of what you will see on this DVD is supposition, mixed in with fact, fiction and a healthy dose of imagination.  We will never really know the whole truth of our Caveman ancestors as we only have bones, and cave paintings to rely on but to a certain extent this is enough and Professor Winston does try to give a plausible explanation as to how and why the human race left the trees and evolved into the people we are today.
There are four episodes, First Ancestors, Blood Brothers, Savage Family and finally, The Survivors and each half hour includes a ""time-lapse"" so that we can rush through pre-history to the next journey of our evolving ancestors.
Professor Winston is a pragmatic narrator who is able to put across a point without being condescending to the watcher, his humour is subtle and his understanding of the human mind is quite staggering.  Roll on the next ""Walking with..."" series; I wonder what it will be called?  ""Walking with Astronauts?""",1048982400,47,1518,4.603703703703704

1833988,2,B00008AOWQ,"One thing that struck me is watching our ancestors eat with the hienas, feasting in filth, and wearing meat shirts, this is non-sense.  In fact, it is only us modern humans that have fallen into carnism, because of the recent development of agrobusiness.  This can be easily confirmed in Amazonian tribes even today, and in fact, meat causes a myriad of diseases because man never evolved to eat like that.  So, if the good Dr. missed this one fact, it is possible that the whole documentary series is nothing more than pseudo science.  I was dissapointed with the portrayal of Neanderthal, and no mention of Denisovan and others that interbred with homo sapiens.

Differing views should have been given.  It has avoided human behaiviors like rape of lone females carefully giving murder as the reason for her concern.  One biscuit of energy for reproduction is a poor excuse for THE reason we walk on two legs as there would be many.  If we spent so much time near water and this was our daily habit of course fishing would have fast developed, as would swimming and wading.  Edibles grow at the bottom and of course we would develop standing to breath above water which of course also allows for look out when out of water.  Oils and fats lead to healthy brains and we would have a better supply of these than our fellow tree swinging fruit eating apes.  it has been very poor in offering a breadth of knowledge and instead had offered Soap Operah style stories for entertaining the unthinking masses.

1834041,3,B00008AOWQ,"This review is for ""Walking with Cavemen"" DVD. I would give four stars for adults, one star for children and teenagers. So I settled on three stars.

This is not appropriate for children, IMO, because contains scenes of full frontal nudity. Look at the DVD cover. Inside the DVD, those body parts are exposed. Of course that is the reality of how our ancestors lived. But it's ridiculous to show this in a high school science class or such. It ideally should be suitable for educational purposes. But it's not, at least because of the nudity. Of course, this is a matter of opinion. But I think the buyer should know up front.

The DVD does not really seem scientifically accurate, because the ""story lines"" are speculative and based on no apparent evidence. I think the producers and writers went out on a limb with their imaginations. They couldn't hardly say ""we don't know"" as a scientist would. This DVD is more about entertainment, less about education. The DVD states that Homo habilis making a stone hand tool was purely instinctual, the same as a bird building a nest. I think the reality is more complex. The DVD fails to mention known gene mutations that are strongly suspected to have led to our language abilities. There was no mention of the actual fossils upon which these speculative reconstructions and ""story lines"" are based.

I watched and enjoyed the entire DVD. It is entertaining to imagine how our distant ancestors might have lived. On the other hand, you might find a lot of it repulsive. A lot of the imagery is graphic and disturbing. We are faced with the grim reality of what really happened over millions of years as our ancestors struggled to survive. Anything better for speculative stories about early humans? I would suggest ""Quest for Fire"". I liked the acting for the most part. I just doubted the truth of much of the story lines. I found the ""bonus materials"" pretty weak, mostly interviews with a few of the actors and workers on the project.",1398038400,,1982,4.706051873198847

I happen not to be a creationist but I really had to keep reminding my son this is not truth; it's the best guess we have with the science we have now.  I'll grant you that it is based on science but this goes too far for me in saying 'is' instead of 'we think based on evidence x.'  New information comes along every day that disproves past strongly felt scientific 'truths.'  I'd just enjoy this more if they had consistently used the phrase 'we think.'  I assume this was made by filmmakers, not scientists.  So I guess it is what it is.

In some ways this is superior to the BBC one because they take the time to TELL us how they know what they know.  Mr. Baldwin shows us fossil legs, small sulks, and stone tools.  He seems to enjoy explaining it and it really helps share the joy and excitement to the viewer.  Sure, I took a point away because some of the information is now outdated and I am not sure I agree with some of the wording used to explain human evolution.

1834090,4,B00008AOWQ,"Do you get homo erectus, afarensis, and all the other pre-modern humans/apes confused?  Want to know how they all fit together, which derived from which, and which apes went on to become modern men and which died out?  If so, then you should definite watch this documentary.  The story starts in Africa several million years ago and follows the evolution of our pre-historic ancestors as they evolve from apes to men.  The various groups of apes are played by actors, and we watch as they learn to interact (with their environment and each other) in progressively more complex manners, we learn the strengths and weakness of each group, and ultimately why some lived and some died.  I admit that I didn't know much about this subject prior to watching this video, only a few of the buzzwords (Lucy, neanderthal, etc.), but I found this to be both enjoyable and informative.  I was surprised to learn how many of our prehistoric ancestors didn't survive, their lines simply ending.  One thing that was repeatedly stated was that climate change drove many of the physical and cultural changes in the various pre-human apes.  Those who could adapt (and change) survived, those who didn't died, but climate change was the important driver for rapid change (i.e. evolution).  The acting is quite good, as are the costumes.  I think that the production team went to great lengths to differentiate the various types of pre-human apes so that the viewer can fairly easily follow the physical changes.  Bottom line is that this is a great documentary - I only give it four stars because I don't know how many people will want to add it to their permanent collection.  This documentary has definitely inspired me to learn more about prehistoric humans (that was probably the goal!).  Very informative and highly recommended.",1262217600,3,1814,4.908196721311476

The video available here clearly says that it is hosted by Alec Baldwin, but he's not here. This is the BBC version. I use this in a human evolution class, and like the US version because Baldwin introduces the segments with fossil skulls for comparison of the cavemen.

For Hollywood, the approach taken would be fine. For a documentary, looking through a peephole at Lucy's day-to-day activities with such sentimental flare... Well, they used more artistic licenses than I could stand for this show. I would rather wax my inner thighs than see this show again.

1834094,4,B00008AOWQ,"""Walking with Cavemen"" is an interesting look at the progression or evolution of man, from the first ape-like creatures to the homo-sapien.  It begins with the famous ""Lucy"" skeleton from over 3 million years ago, and follows adaptations through the ages - walking on two feet instead of all fours, using tools, and later, making tools, changing from a ""specialist"" that can only do one thing well to a creature that is able to adapt to changing environments, and more.

It's important to note that a lot of what you'll see here is speculation - there are actors playing the parts of these various species, and exactly how they looked and how they behaved is at least partly conjecture.  Scientists and biologists are making their ""best guess"" based on where the skeletons were discovered, what the skulls looked like (jawbone etc.), how recent in time they can be placed through testing, and other factors.  So when you see Lucy's tribe leave the trees and walk, you have to keep in mind that they might not have looked or acted exactly in the way shown.  Even so, it's an intriguing picture of how early man might have evolved.

Four stars.  Seeing our distant cousins struggle to survive, it's easy to appreciate the fact that we've come a long way!",1227139200,3,1252,4.715596330275229

You just killed the mammoth and must carry meat back to your mate!  Makeup--he needs more grime!"".  It's bearable the first time you watch it, but then you spend the next time through hoping that some big predator will leap into the scene and crunch them all so you don't have to watch it again.

Some Christians though, who do not accept evolution, may be offended by the film.",1179532800,,279,4.653061224489796
1834110,4,B00008AOWQ,"Before I begin this review, I must admit that I am obsessed with human evolution.  However, my education on the subject is limited to the few documentary films and educational programs on the subject as well as a few short books.  So my review is probably best read as a review of a leisure evolution lover.

That being said I found the documentary very fascinating and enjoyable.  However, of all of the documentaries that I have seen on the subject, Walking with Cavemen would find itself a few spots below the top spot.

For anyone interested in the subject, I recommend ""The making of Mankind"" 7 volume documentary hosted by Richard Leaky.  This documentary begins with our earliest 4 legged ancestors and works slowly and carefully through each adaptation along the way.  Each volume is approx. 45 minutes and explores not only the major physical changes of each species, but also the important consequences of every stage.  The series is much more in depth and pays careful attention to several aspects of human evolution.

The first 5 volumes work cronologically from australopithecus to homo sapien sapien.  The 6th volume discusses the begginning of civilization and farming.  Each volume is fascinating and could be watched individual of the others.

In the final volume, Leaky explores the idea that Humans are inherently violent and destined to destroy themselves.  Leaky explores where this idea comes from and proposes a beautiful and humble counter argument that suggests that humans only thrived on earth because of their recognition of others.

Walking with cavemen is fun and interesting, and has the benefit of being much more recent and therefore probably more accurate, but Making of mankind is, in my feeble opinion, a much greater documentary.  It could probably be found in most libraries.",1144022400,19,1813,5.057239057239057
1834111,5,B00008AOWQ,"In anthropology and archeology, ""current"" and ""factual"" are unfortunately rather nebulous terms.

The fact of the matter is that much of what is taught in universities -- as well as what is presented here -- is highly speculative.

Students, of course, are taught to parrot theories being propounded in the latest academic publications (written chiefly by professors seeking tenure, who must create new theorems to survive).

Naturally, these students cluck and shake their heads when they see any deviation to what they've been sold by their faculty staff. (The next year will bring a new batch of speculation taught as fact.)

The upshot for you, dear viewer? You will find this film VERY fun, VERY well animated, and, yes, generally informative enough to entertain and educate. The particularities of theory will continue to change as time goes on. That is unavoidable.

This is a triumph of creative production, and I give it a very hearty 5 stars.

And anyone who feels this is simply ""freaking hilarious!"" would probably do better cast *in* the movie, rather than simply viewing it.",1139270400,6,1088,5.050279329608938
1834112,3,B00008AOWQ,"The BBC's ""Walking With..."" series has been very high quality since its inception.  Great visual effects combined with clarity of exposition and just enough ""story-telling"" to enable most viewers to remain captivated while absorbing decent chunks of information.  This latest addition to the series maintains the general format of its forebears but, perhaps inevitably, is the least successful.

It's difficult for humans to have any kind of realistic vision of themselves, so any series that tries to show how we evolved over the millenia (and some of the dead-ends along the way) is going to have problems. In this case there are simply too many gaps and too many leaps across those gaps with only the merest fig leaf of speculation to cover the chasm.  And there are some fairly odd assertions about what aspects of adaptation had which effects.

Perhaps the most striking gap is that these episodes miss out on some of the most interesting conclusions we've been able to draw as a result of the last 6 years of genetic analysis.  So this series has an ""old"" feel even though it is recently made.  It also misses a lot of hard knowledge we've had for a long time, perhaps because it was too uncomfortable to include.  For example, the ape-men are shown being monogamous, whereas we know that in all societies at all times known to us, dominant human males have tried to form and keep harems, either explicity or illicitly.  Likewise we know a great deal about the necessity of violence in societies where wealth cannot easily be abstracted, and is thus easily stolen.  Aggression is the only defence - and of course greater aggression is the main tactic for theft.  Neither of these facts appears anywhere in the series, no doubt because we don't like seeing the uncomfortable truth about these aspects of our species.

Other than that, the makeup and imitation of pre-human gaits etc. is superb and one or two points are interestingly non-obvious: for example, that the development of enlarged and highly visible whites in our eyes is most probably to enhance signalling, so we can detect subtle emotional states in others.

All in all, worth buying but not watching more than once.",1137542400,28,2186,4.859838274932614

1834114,5,B00008AOWQ,"The BBC's ""Walking With Cavemen"" is a fantastic documentary series that recreates the evolutionary adventure that was the journey from our earliest hominid ancestors to modern humans of today.  Using the latest research in the fields of antropology and evolutionary science, the series highlights several key steps along the way from the diminuative ape-like Australopithecus afarensis to, ultimately, Homo Sapiens Sapiens, showing the various stages of physical as well as intellectual advancements.  The effects and makeup are well done and help to create an interesting and believable world where our earliest human relatives lived, hunted, fought, and died.

I was very pleased with this series and would highly recommend it and the other ""Walking With..."" films to anyone interested in ancient life and anyone who wants to get a fascinating glimpse of what life might have been like for our ancestors over the course of 3 million years.",1106265600,8,941,5.344594594594595

1834116,4,B00008AOWQ,"Having watched the tv debut of this series, then the purchased DVD I would have to complement the final product as a better effort, especially from the choice of narration.  This topic is very difficult to do, especially with animation of human-like animals where we can be more critical than with dinosaurs.  The story lines are a bit tedious but interesting.  Still it is difficult to believe we can reconstruct the behavior of the apes and human predecents based on our current database.  I still think the effort is worthy.  The graphics are very well done, possible not appropriate for a young viewer.  In one scene the ""cavemen"" kill a hooved animal and then degut and eat it.  My wife sent our 7 year old out of the room on that one!  Perhaps it is such realism that makes the Walking With series so well received.  Overall a good effort and worthy purchase for such a difficult and challenging subject.",1080086400,10,910,4.6375
1834117,5,B00008AOWQ,"Having now seen both verisons I have to say the uncut BBC two part production is the best.  Longer, doesn't spoon feed you and the DVD has LOTS of extras - fact files, photo gallery, storyboards, post-production interviews and even 'on location' interviews with actors, the movement director and the effects supervisor.  Why buy hamburger when you can get steak?
Seems much longer than just 100 minutes - lots of details and solid story telling.",1072656000,11,445,4.92
1834118,5,B00008AOWQ,"Ever wonder what your ancestors were like 100 years ago?  Or perhaps wonder what your geneological tree looked like in the middle ages?  Ever ponder what your forefathers were doing back in the time of the Greeks & Romans of a few thousand years ago?  Or, back even further, what they were like a few million years ago?
Well, it is the latter epoch that is covered by this DVD.  It is an overview of human evolution, 7 million years in the making.  It takes us from the dawn on man all the way up to about 140,000 years go;  long time ago for us, but mere seconds ago on a cosmic timescale.
Along the way the documentary displays diverse humanoids, some of whom make it, some of whom don't.  It also demonstrates their interaction with long-extinct species of animals that were around the same time they walked the earth.
I must caution that the DVD pulls no punches when it comes to showing the animalistic traits of primitive man.  The rites of courtship, hunting, eating and gutting of animals are all shown with uncompromisingly graphic demonstrations.  I would not recommend this video for young videos, nor would I suggest that anyone watch it while eating.  Some of it is not the most appetizing of images in the world.
That said, it is quite remarkable to identify just how much we modern humans have in common with these early products of evolution.  If we look closely, we will see a lot of ourselves in them.
The late astronomer Carl Sagan once remarked that, if the history of the universe were shrunk to the scale of a calendar year, all of humanity exists would exist in the last 10 seconds of that year.  This scientific expose is a glimpse into those 10 seconds.  As Stephen J. Gould once said, ""We stood up first and got smart later.""  Here is OUR story of how our ancestors stood up, got smart and began their long,  slow and tenuous march towards civilization.",1071446400,46,1879,4.517751479289941
1834119,4,B00008AOWQ,"I've read the negative comments on this installment of the ""Walking With"" series and can only partially agree with them.  The production could have been better, but I think we have become spoiled by watching computer generated animals done extremely well and realistic.  This version contains many human actors and thus the whole ""feel"" of the production is different.
Also, not everything produced on Discovery is meant for children.  There are still many, many adults who wish to learn about the past and appreciate a more academic presentation then would occur if a show such as this were aimed at a more younger audience.  I guess it is taken for granted by a lot of the media that once one becomes an adult, all that matters are sports competitions and sitcoms.  This series thus was extremely refreshing to watch.
That being said, I came away from watching ""Cavemen"" with a newfound respect for our ancestors.  All too often they have been portrayed as comical dimwits, running around with clubs and dragging women by their hair.  Now I realize this is actually very disrespectful and totally inappropriate. These very ancient ancestors managed to learn to survive some of the worst environmental conditions imaginable, grew more creative over time and with this creativity laid the foundations of modern civilization.  As stated in the series, the discovery of fire not only chased away the denizens of the night, but also provided an opportunity for homo sapiens to learn to create,to reflect, become more emotional creatures and allow for the development of higher brain functions.
Neanderthals especially have had to bear the brunt of many a joke.  Although their species did not survive, they can hardly be termed a failure.  They too were resilient, developed the ability to exist during an Ice Age that we, even with all our modern conveniences, would be hard-pressed to endure.  They lost the race in the final stretch, yet their accomplishments are deserving of further study and a more accurate (and respectful) portrayal.
It is no longer funny to see some dumpy looking, grunting renditions of distant homo sapiens.  This vision of them is not only misleading, but extremely far from the truth.  ""Walking With Cavemen"" made me realize that because of their temerity, strength and creative thinking, we can today enjoy a world whose origins rest with these long gone, but still amazing, ancient homo sapiens.  A wonderful, and thoughtful, addition to the series.",1068681600,31,2478,5.056511056511057
1834120,2,B00008AOWQ,"Over the duration of the 'walking with' series, I've really come to question what validity it has.  I know that there is probably some merit in seeing recreations of what the earth's past may have been like, but all too often the actual educational value seems to get lost amidst the need to tell little stories about the animals in question.  This started with Walking with Dinosaurs and I didn't find it too annoying there, but there were plenty of times it didn't work.  Instead of documentary, it had turned dino-drama.  Now I can really enjoy the concept of a dino-drama, but trying to do that and be educational and do both well is a pretty tall order.  One might also wonder why they felt the need to tell a story with every episode but that becomes clear once you realize how expensive it must have been to make their characters.  It simply wouldn't be economical to show a creature for 30 seconds that you spent a load of money designing the cgi models for, puppets, etc.
And now we come to Walking with Cavemen.  For some reason, the creators of the film still feel obligated to stick to prehistoric drama (and by now the novelty has more than worn off), while the quite educational 'making of' disc has been dropped entirely.
Looking back on the whole series, one must accept that it's a sort of magic trick, all smoke and mirrors--but innitially, it works.  The problem is, by 'Cavemen' we can cleary see the man behind the curtain and the thing falls flat on its face.  The stories are, to be blunt, stupid.  The best acting in the world can't keep the costumes from looking rediculous, nor make the story convincing.  Ultimately, it's a bunch of people paid to run around in furry suits or naked (as in the later episodes) pretending to be pre-humans.  It worked in Kubrick's 2001, I don't know why it doesn't work here.
With all that said, I would have enjoyed a good BBC special on human evolution.  The efforts of the team that made this series, the actors, etc. are very much appreciated, but I feel that while this may hook some of the kids, it does so at a great sacrifice.  Teaching science is ultimately about getting students to open their mind and question the world around them--that means that when we make assertions in a science program like Homo erectus not having a spiritual life, we actually provide some evidence.  Demonstrating the process of inquiry and deduction is more important than the costumes, more important than flashy cgi or creative cut-scenes.  It is the core of what a good education program should be about.  Instead, we have the creative presentation of content.  Just content.  Not science.
If you follow that line of reasoning you might come to see why I've given this 2 stars.  This is a talented team working for the leaders in quality science programs.  I think they can do a lot better.",1063843200,18,2842,4.599206349206349
