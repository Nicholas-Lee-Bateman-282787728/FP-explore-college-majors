8222388,5,B000WCBULY,"In response to the review by ""Big Dog"" - if you want everything to match up perfectly - picture and narration, this isn't for you (personally I think its nice to have to think every once in a while, but hey...)

That said, I find this series to be a wonderful insight into parts of China that we never get to see. Television doesn't air documentaries about what you see in these dvds - religious ceremonies, rural life, sporting events, caravans, etc... all in Western China.

If you want the flip-side of Beijing and Shanghai, this series is your best bet. There are more dvd's in the Mysterious China Series that I own: Secrets of the Silk Road, Holy Mountain, Kung Fu Masters & Land of Legends

I love them all.

Hope this helps!",1268352000,2,732,4.440298507462686
8222389,1,B000WCBULY,"This ""documentary"" is poorly filmed, poorly written, and poorly edited.  The disjointed scenes and unrelated commentary make for an irritating experience.  The movie offers very little information and has no coherent flow of ideas.  Wholly disappointing",1248134400,2,253,5.972222222222222
