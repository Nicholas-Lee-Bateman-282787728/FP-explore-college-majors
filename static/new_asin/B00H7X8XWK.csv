8630671,4,B00H7X8XWK,"Unfortunately, this 1996 film has not been released in American format.  Made for television by UPN, it was the pilot for a series which never went into development.  The film is a coming-of-age story set in the far future.  In the midst of an interplanetary conflict, inexperienced cadets are suddenly thrust into actual combat.  With their senior officers killed in action and a colony threatened, they must engage enemy ships against the odds.  The enemy does not consist of aliens but of humans from an authoritarian society, which makes the story something of a metaphor for the Cold War.  There is nothing here that has not been done many times before.  In fact, the script draws heavily from Top Gun and Star Wars.  However, the film is visually impressive and well-directed, making it quite entertaining.",1468195200,4,812,4.962962962962963
