8759645,3,B01EVR0WHI,"Making a movie about Rothko's painting must be quite a challenge. I salute the filmmaker and the attempt but it is not close to standing in front of an original painting and breathing... allowing the nervous energy (which is usually the foremost driving force) to take a back seat and then to register that something else, something subtle is occurring.
Hope this film inspires others to visit the real paintings.",1536537600,,413,4.914285714285715
8759646,3,B01EVR0WHI,"Three stars because it's about Rothko, but I found this pretty amateurish. There needs to be a definitive documentary or biopic on Rothko. Far too important an American artist to have next to nothing out there worth watching about him.
I disliked many of the directors questions, found them naive. And it bothers me when a director superimposes what they think might've influenced the work with images that they force the viewer to look at for far too long. It also bothers me when they cue music that they think matches the mood of the work. Rothko did not intend to presume what the viewer would get from his work, one of the many things that makes his work special and unique.
His son reading his words was interesting, but most of the words are already recited in the Simon Schama episode about Rothko's Seagram paintings, which I believe is the only decent film on Rothko.",1531440000,,877,4.628205128205129

8759648,3,B01EVR0WHI,"Overall I enjoyed the documentary and I'm glad I watched it. The director clearly has a passion for Rothko and was able to assemble some interviews of people who shared her enthusiasm. There were definitely some interesting visuals of Rothko's work; some in the context of virtual galleries that conveyed a larger idea about how Rothko intended to engage his audience.

I rated it three stars because it was too broad and out of focus. The documentary would be more significant if it were to advance or explore a specific theme or element of Rothko's work or life, rather than a collection of loose commentary.

I watched the documentary after having viewed a Rothko exhibit at the MFA in Boston. I was more curious about his work than impressed and I was hoping the documentary would further my appreciation.",1511740800,,809,4.81294964028777
8759649,3,B01EVR0WHI,"The good aspects of this film have been covered in the five-star reviews. So, here I come to lower the overall rating with a three-star review which wishes it could be two and a half. I apologize, but . . . !

I am a Rothko enthusiast, so let's get that said. It is very well photographed, no doubt about that. However, I'd say at least half of this film has nothing to do with Rothko because the director seems to have been more fascinated with what she was able to get on film - evocative shots of New York - than in keeping Rothko in focus. Over and over, a comment from someone with something to say about him will be led up to and followed by extended footage of a wall, or gloomy urban scenes, or decaying facades, a subway station, homeless people, a plastic bag, morose people on a bus, another decaying structure, or other ""evocative"" scenes which look great but having not a thing to do with Rothko other than being in New York - a New York decades removed from Rothko's. The camera lingers on and is absolutely smitten with this sort of thing, making the film at least half full/empty in this regard. We see a white dog. Twice. Nice photo, interesting cinematic values and so on, but absolutely meaningless unless you want to get existential and invent your own connection.

This is half a film about Rothko and half of another film you could call ""Interesting images I saw while making a film about Mark Rothko."" At one point, a homeless person camped outside a building Rothko lived in is asked if he's heard of Rothko or knew the building is significant. No, he doesn't. This leads to him talking about how the sight of families makes him sad because he has no-one in his life. This is not a short scene. The filmmaker obviously finds this person to be compelling and worthy of our sympathy. I've no problem with that, but he has no connection to the film being made, no relevance. He's in New York. Good enough.

The music does its job except for an annoying piece which includes something which sounds like small ball bearings being spilled. I'm not expecting a soundtrack by Phillip Glass or something relevant by Morton Feldman. But, something unobtrusive is a nifty idea.

What could this film have benefited from? More Rothkos - or at least more about him and much less YouTube-style footage which suggests someone testing a new camcorder rather than footage for a coherent film. If I were to read that the filmmaker had shot half an hour of test footage of New York and then ran out of disc space or time to do the Rothko scenes, it wouldn't surprise me at all.

I wasn't expecting a ready-for-PBS, traditional, Ken Burns-style documentary. But, I don't think I was hoping too much in expecting the film to have more Rothko and less inert material as filler.

This film isn't about Rothko as much as it's about itself - a film which wants to be about Rothko, but only succeeds half the time. This is fifty percent of a well-done documentary. As the three star ratings say, ""It's okay.""",1484956800,7,3006,4.496336996336996
8759650,5,B01EVR0WHI,"Excellent - a must see! Imagine stepping inside the mind of artist Mark Rothko and seeing his beyond words beautiful works of art as he intended them to be seen. Film is narrated by his son, reading notes from the artist's journal.",1483660800,3,231,4.523809523809524
