1872955,3,B00008Z463,"This movie starts out very promising, with vividly artistic shots following a classic boy meets girl story. The plot builds up as the main character tries to woo his mystery lady, and then falls flat on its face. Not to try to ruin the ending for those who haven't seen the movie yet, the writers' resolution is just not plausible. I don't want to give anything away - I'll just say that the movie is in serious need of a rewrite. It could have ended differently and have been more effective with the same outcome than what we are left with instead..... All that potential, down the drain.

The first half is really good and sure to have you chuckling. Maybe forget about the second half.....",1117411200,2,692,4.492063492063492

1872957,5,B00008Z463,"More John Simm!  Please, John, make more movies, and not just BBC tv.
Simm's character, Frank, has got to be the sweetest boy-man in cinema.  Christina Ricci is wonderful playing a character that is all hard-edge. Frank is the perfect foil to melt her like butter, if she will let him.  Frank is nerdy, but cute and sensitive-- adoring and adorable.  As John Hurt says in the bts, it's an idealistic love affair, but Ricci & Simm are thoroughly enjoyable together.  And MacLachlan and Hurt are typically perfect in supporting roles. The plot is exaggerated, but it's pure escapist fun.  For a B-movie, it is a gem of a find, thanks to Simm.",1090022400,19,640,4.619469026548672
1872958,1,B00008Z463,"i am completely and utterly baffled by this movie, but more so by the people who are giving it five stars. once again, it is proven that amazon reviewers only review things that they like. and for some reason, there are people who liked this. i'll admit that the movie has its good qualities - christina ricci is one of my favorite actresses and this film wasn't bad enough that i will hold it against her, some of the acting was charming, it had a few clever scenes and i just liked the look of a lot of it. BUT as for the important traits of a good movie - the plot was incredibly under-developed as was the script and the transitions just didn't seem to fit, almost too the point of my asking ""are they TRYING to make this not make sense?"" and it's overall just unrealistic. i'd watch it again, sure, but that says nothing about the film.",1083888000,6,841,4.2625
1872959,2,B00008Z463,"Captioning is a valuable service to provide for those of us who need it.  In the film ""Miranda"" there is no English closed-captioning track, and the only concession to captions at all is the track in Spanish.  I have noticed that British efforts are frequently released without captions, and in ""Miranda"" there are the usual modern faults:  nearly inaudible whispering, inadequate separation between dramatic lines and accompanying music, British terms and pronounciations which Americans need to hear more accurately, and so forth.  The use of Spanish subtitles does NOT help whatever in these matters.  Otherwise, I do believe Christina Ricci is suitably admired by the photographer.",1080604800,3,685,5.4245283018867925
1872960,5,B00008Z463,"I see I am the first person to review this movie and i have a theory about that.  Miranda is a ACTORS MOVIE!! An actors movie is one that you get if you are an actor or studying to be one like I am.  Its not for most people.  If your not an actor you won't like it. Let me explain. First of all  Christina Richie plays three characters!!  This is for actors' to enjoy.  She is a dancer, a dominatricks, and a conman/  Most actors cant play one!!  Most people cant understand that Christina is playing DIFFERENT people, and is not the same all the way through so they won't like it. If you're an actor you'll apreciate her performance. Also If your an actor you're hungry (that's a joke my acting teacher told.  pretty funny, eh?).  Also this is a movie from England and has older actors in it.  England actors are better tahn Hollywood because they invented Theatre and have more plays.  To be an actor in England you do a lot of stage work, not like in Hollywood, where most people on screen jsut look good but cant act.
So if your not an actor then Miranda is not for you.  Get Gun Shy with Sarah Bullock or something with Jim Carrie in it instead, but if you are studying to be an actor then you will watch this for the Preformance aspect.
Thank you.  That is my review of Miranda VHS.",1079395200,,1288,4.182926829268292
1872961,2,B00008Z463,"First of all I seem to be bucking the trend of other reviewers but then I do that sometimes.
Basically, Miranda is a sting movie starring (funny term here) The semi-beautiful, Cristina Ricci as Miranda, John Hurt as Christian, her mentor and father figure and Frank as John Sim, a librarian and Cristina's love interest.
After watching this travesty I'm reminded of the old saying, when joking with someone naive or gullible, ""Do you want to buy a bridge"" referring to a time in the eighteen hundreds when the Brooklyn bridge was reputedly sold over and over by con men to gullible investors.
Well if anyone who have viewed this movie, believes that what happens in this movie could really happen in real life, then I've got some gold mine stock for them.
The Plot
The sub plot of this movie is that Frank, a librarian, who is working in a condemned library building, apparently until the last day, goes Ga Ga over Miranda who, for some inexplicable reason stars hanging around. Now Frank doesn't know it yet but Miranda and her cohort are Flim Flam artists, who allegedly con Millionaire Businessmen into buying condemned buildings. Ostensibly, they are so smitten by Miranda and so trusting that, they just wire money into her account.
The plot of the movie is that Frank falls hard for Miranda, who reciprocates but has obligations to Christian etc. etc.. Of course when Frank finds out what Miranda does, he wants to take her away from all that and move to the country. Really.
What does Miranda do?
I know this film was made in England and they probably do things different there but I found Miranda's scam idiotic and anyone who has ever bought one piece of real estate should feel the same!
These are millionaire businessmen for chrisakes!
What about Due Diligence? How about Escrows and Title Policies? How about tax records, or at least getting a phony deed?
Ok, if you can get past that nonsense (which I can't), what you have is a Really, Really mediocre movie. Cristina Ricci is mildly engaging. She'd probably be in my top fifty of movie stars I'd like to see in the buff but you don't even get to see that.
Well that's about it. You can listen to the other reviewers and rent or buy Miranda or you can listen to me and skip. If you listen to them, next time you'll listen to me.",1064966400,12,2292,4.579075425790754
1872962,4,B00008Z463,"I'm going to go out on a limb here and call this a ""likeable little noir"". Reminiscent of several recent Brit Noirs (""The Criminal"", ""B. Monkey"") that feature an everday ho-hum 'bloke' hooking up with an impossibly beautiful and sexy woman who soon sends him hurtling into a world of danger and intrigue, ""Miranda""'s nebbishy protaganist takes the shape of Frank the librarian (John Simm). When an alluring yet enigmatic American woman (Christini Ricci) ""randomly"" strolls into his library, the daydreaming Frank fantasizes that his life is about to change-and precedes to learn where the proverb ""Be careful what you wish for"" came from! After you've pushed aside all the ensuing plot twists and dark crime thriller elements, you actually have a rather engaging romantic comedy at the film's core. Ricci just keeps getting better and better, and John Hurt is excellent as Miranda's shadowy ""mastermind""/ mentor. Kyle MacLachlan deserves honorable mention for a dark comic turn as a sleazy, corrupt businessman (are there any other kind?)  who lives for the day that Miranda concedes to dominate and ""punish"" him (perhaps a sly reference to his ""love"" scenes with Isabella Rossilini in ""Blue Velvet""?). A must-see for Noir and/or Ricci fans.",1057622400,3,1241,5.174129353233831

7988290,5,B00008Z463,this movie is awesome and unique:o) i absolutely love this movie!!! not only because christina ricci is in it but it also has a very sweet happy ending plus the story is different from all the other common predictable love movies we are use to watching,1322697600,,252,4.5
7988291,1,B00008Z463,"The owner of the local video store gave us this movie. We had low expectations but would never have guessed this film would be so unintentionally hilarious. This is because this film has an the intoxicating mixture of being a toilet of a script AND it takes itself so seriously. As the lines escape the actor's mouths, my wife and I would fall off of the couch laughing while we begged them (in vain) to stop.

File under ""gin movie"" ie: a film that one watches with no expectation of quality - on the contrary, the perceived poor quality requires imbibing in alcoholic beverages before hand in order to laugh the terrible experience off (and to loosen the lips so that peanut gallery comments can flow freely). If Mystery Science Theater 3000 should ever look to include relatively modern films, this would be a strong contender (not to mention a rich vein for comedy).

I don't know how any of the participants could deliver these lines with a straight face.",1300320000,,960,4.641176470588236
7988292,3,B00008Z463,Service very good but the movie was very boring. Not a good movie at all,1219968000,,72,3.8666666666666667
7988293,3,B00008Z463,"""Miranda"" is one of the Christina Ricci's lesser known films that were made around 2001 and 2002. Back then she was often seen in smaller projects that went straight to video in USA - such as ""The Gathering"" and ""Prozac Nation"" - and like these not-so-great-and-not-so-bad films, the greatest merit of ""Miranda"" turns out my favorite actress Christina Ricci herself playing a mysterious woman named Miranda. American Miranda walks into an old library in Yorkshire (that is going to be demolished) and has a passionate affair with Frank (John Simm) a lonely librarian who loves Elvis.

I said ""mysterious,"" but actually there is nothing truly mysterious about the character of Miranda. We all are aware that she is not what she looks from the very beginning and it is not hard to detect the secrets of her. But in ""Miranda"" (of which not-so-complicated story is told from his point of view) Frank is the last person to know that and we are supposed to swallow that premise.

This is a familiar story about a man who makes a wrong choice, but as the quirky animation at the opening credit part and the location of a quiet town of Scarborough suggest, the film is not so much a noir film as an off-beat romantic comedy thriller. Miranda (or Christina Ricci) is no femme fatale and she never looks like one, but I am not sure this is intentional or not.

The film's too simple story cannot really be involving and its characters are not particularly interesting. The film's laid-back pace doesn't help when the quirky film (which should have been much quirkier) does not have much to offer except a few funny moments and the fine performances from the two leads. The film directed by Marc Munden also features John Hurt as her father/mentor figure and a very weird character played by Kyle MacLachlan.

""Miranda"" is not a bad film, but it is not a good film, either. Obviously it wants to be something unique and original, but it seems it doesn't know in what way.",1216425600,2,1960,4.672463768115942
7988294,1,B00008Z463,"I'm a fan of Christina Ricci and dark comedies, yet I found this film damn near unwatchable. The only things intriguing about it are why the actors agreed to do it, why it was made, and why, after the backers presumably saw the finished product, it was released. The film itself gets no stars; my one star is for Ricci's presence.

For Ricci completists only, and then I recommend it be viewed with the sound off so that no one need listen to the dialogue.",1142553600,7,456,4.364705882352941
7988295,3,B00008Z463,"I bought this DVD because Christina Ricci was in it - pure and simple. It's a strange film and not for everyone but it's Ricci's sexiest role yet( arguably ) so that's why I bought it. Ricci plays many roles and you need to see through the fog to know what's going on. Has a hollywood ending but it's worth it just for Ricci. If your a Christina Ricci fan, then buy it, if not maybe this movie isn't for you.",1130284800,6,408,4.049382716049383

But nonetheless, she was the only good thing about it.",1129766400,3,344,4.564516129032258
