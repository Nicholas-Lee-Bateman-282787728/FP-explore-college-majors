7101113,5,B00VRRVHMA,I purchased this DVD for my kids to watch in the car on the way to the beach (14 hours).  I remembered watching it with my parents when I was younger.

7101167,4,B00VRRVHMA,"The first order for Home Improvement:  Season 1 that we received had a messed up disk.  The seller was very proactive in replacing the product.  They answered my email right away, sent out a new product and we returned the bad season via FedEx.  Of course, Tim Allen is a hoot and the second set of discs arrived quickly with no damage.  My family will enjoy these discs for years to come.  Would recommend to others.
