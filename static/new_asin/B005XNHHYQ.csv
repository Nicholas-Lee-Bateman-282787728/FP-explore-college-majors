4903337,5,B005XNHHYQ,"I have been waiting for something that went beyond simple letters and sight words from this company for so long! Meet the letters and meet the numbers are where my son learned his letters and numbers before he was 24 months old. I taught him phonics, so that DVD we do not watch. I usually turn these on while I make dinner. The only other thing I had found that was helpful (DVD wise) in teaching reading skills while I made dinner was the Leapfrog sing along dvd which teaches word families. This is wonderful! We were really struggling because he got sick of the Leapfrog DVD and we had nothing. Also, I think these are generally better at teaching than the Leapfrog DVDs. My son pays closer attention and survives my ""quizes"" better afterwards. Now I am confident he will also master blends. If only this company would come out with a DVD for word families, that would be spectacular (hey Preschool Prep, HINT HINT!).",1325289600,4,921,4.554216867469879
4903338,5,B005XNHHYQ,Repetition is key for early learning and these DVDs do a fantastic job of providing that. I think I can honesty attribute my three-year-old daughter's early knowledge of numbers and language to this company and DVDs. (Btw - !the numbers one is great too) Engaging and fun to watch. She actually asks to watch them :) We typically watch them at the end of breakfast for a good distraction while she is finishing up her last bites. Win-win!!!!,1476144000,,441,4.666666666666667
4903339,1,B005XNHHYQ,"We ordered this three-disc set and was surprised to find that the alphabet disc was actually the R-rated movie, James White.  It's label was the same as the others and also looked just like  it was going to be the preschool prep  alphabet DVD.

We had popped it in to relax with the kids on the couch before bed time and were very confused  by what started playing. We had to take the DVD out and put it back in again to make sure that we had not accidentally played something from Netflix. Nope. James White.

This was just weird. We have the Sight Words series and love those.  I suspect that we will love the phonics serious just as well.  Giving one star for the inconvenience factor and also for the company's negligence.  That being said, we understand that mistakes happen and will definitely be reaching out to the company to report this and request replacement DVD.  This review will be updated when we hear from the preschool prep company.",1474329600,5,949,4.497076023391813
4903340,5,B005XNHHYQ,"I bought this for my kids in 2012. At the time, I had a 2yo, 4yo, 7yo and a 9yo. All four of the kids would stop and watch. My two youngest became early readers! Blends and digraphs are hard to learn and I truly believe this helps.",1467417600,,231,3.8333333333333335
4903341,4,B005XNHHYQ,"It's actually really good set of videos. My 2.5 yo twins verbally follows & danced to the first video that introduces the alphabet using phonics.

I just wished that when they introduced an object pertinent to the phonics (eg elephant), that they would show the word 'elephant.' Kind of do site words & phonics together, so the kids can associatively learn the material right there & then, rather than have to figure it out later.

In addition to, towards the end of the 1st video it got really advanced with related phonics theories on videos 2 & 3, that even I got a little lost as to figuring out what it is that they were trying to introduce.

I grew up memorizing site words, with a whole lot of trial & error, & that was easy for me, & that's how I learned to read. So phonics is brand new to me.

At any rate, it's still a pretty good video set. I wished I had bought this series when my twins were 18 months, when they first mastered the alphabet. They would have mastered the phonics aspects of the alphabet by now.

Highly recommend this video set!",1467158400,3,1058,4.3232323232323235

They still beg to watch these DVDs. If your child is used to action packed videos you might want to only let them watch these in the car or as a privilege instead of ""nap time"" type of situation. The kids that I know that started early with these and watched less tv still beg for them after 5 years old. We started with the colors, shapes, numbers, letters at 12 months old and then moved on to the sight words dvd pack after that. I tell everyone I know about these!

Although it is a simple DVD which has no story, and just sounds out letters and words,  I find it very educational.  It makes the children think about the letters they sound out, and helps to use their imagination.

4903399,5,B005XNHHYQ,"I had previously bought meet the sight words and meet the letters. The products are consistantly boring to adults but seem to hold a child's interest. Just like any of these products I did not force my child to watch them or have them on some calculated training regimen. My son was introduced to each DVD once and he watched them sometimes start to finish two to three times on his own, and now and again he would ask to watch them again. When we got meet the sight words he was interested in spotting words and reading but not mature enough to really blend letters. I did not think he was really mature enough for phonetic awareness when I purchased these as he was just barely 4 but he was a smart kid and eager to learn so I purchased them. He very quickly and easily learned these letter blends and between the sight word knowledge and the phonetic learning he could start reading very basic books. I credit this video for helping make the idea that letter blends and sounds allow you to read click.  It took him a little while but now at 5 he is using the combination of this program and is very good at reading compared to your typical child in pre-k. With a child who was interested in reading at a very young age, I the parent was often a little confused and concerned as to what the heck I should introduce him to next and these videos were a great tool. Now I cannot guarantee that your child is going to be an avid reader before kindergarten but when they are ready for the next step I really do feel these videos are a great tool to teach them what they need to know quickly. This was not a stand alone product for us: my son goes to school, we read together daily, watch word related tv shows...

As a silly side note, just sold some of these DVDs at a yard sale and was pleased with the resale value. Overall this ended up to be a very low cost investment that I truly give some credit to helping my son progress in reading.",1369180800,6,1939,4.209677419354839

My one year old is already showing letter recognition! :)
WOULD DEFINITLY RECOMEND",1369094400,2,315,4.163934426229508
4903401,5,B005XNHHYQ,"I just got this in the mail today and as we sat and watched the first DVD my seven year old said ""This is better than learning!  Thanks, Mom.""

I got this DVD set because my seven year old has been having problems with reading and sounding words out.  I don't think they bother teaching kids phonics anymore, just expect them to read words by sight, which is so stupid.  How are you supposed to figure out new words if you don't learn what sounds the letters make?

I was afraid this would be too juvenile for my seven year old, but she really likes it and is entertained.  She's already coping the letter sounds.  It's funny, she doesn't even realize she's learning!  The DVD is great, with bright interesting cartoons characters.  Right now we're viewing the first DVD that covers single letter sounds.  They go through each letter, and include both hard and soft sounds, like soft and hard G sound.

My only criticism is I feel some of the words they use as examples may be too abstract or confusing for young kids.  For example, they use ""idea"" as one of the word examples for the letter i, and ""perfect"" for the letter p.  And for the letter s, they use the word ""close"".  I think having the letter sound at the end of the word might be confusing to some kids.

But I give it 4 stars because overall, it keeps my kid's attention, and covers every single possible letter sound.  I feel it was worth the money.  We're going to watch the other two DVDs, and I'll update my review after that.

ETA - We've finished watching the other two DVDs that cover blends and digraphs and I'm changing my rating from four stars to five.  My daughter loves all three DVDs, and has asked me to buy her more ""phonic cartoons"".  I watch the cartoons with my daughter and I've even learned a few things myself!  I think it rates five stars because of it's thoroughness.  There is NO WAY I would have thought of every possible letter combination the videos have.  They go over every possible two letter combination that exists in the English language.  In addition, the cartoon breaks down each part of a word so the child SEES how to sound a word out.

Before my daughter watched these shows she was having a hard time recognizing phonics and was just guessing at words.  Now, just a week later after watching these shows she is sounding out words she didn't know before!  Before her reading was so poor I was at the point of requesting an IEP and now I don't think she'll need it.

Definitely worth the money!!",1367193600,34,2496,4.402625820568928
4903402,5,B005XNHHYQ,"I bought these for my 3 year old twin girls.  We watch them a few times a week and I've noticed that they are sounding out their letters and understanding how to form words.  My girls already knew the alphabet and the sounds of each letter, but there is a section on word building that helps them understand how to read a word.  The animation is good--I personally would not have used a slot machine as the graphic for the word building sections--that seems odd to me, but oh well.

These videos are also good for the parent's as a review of phonic rules.  I like these more than the Leap Frog because although the Leap Frog are more entertaining--I think they learn more from the Preschool Prep DVDs.  I use both in teaching my girls though.",1366329600,2,742,4.37956204379562
4903403,5,B005XNHHYQ,"I 1st bought their letters, shapes, colors, numbers, and sight words DVD's, board books, and apps. My son fell in love with the DVD's at 6 months old. He's now 18 months, and knows his ABC's, numbers, shapes, colors, and sight words. Other parents are amazed at how smart he is, and ask me how he knows all of this already. Preschool Prep is amazing, and I highly recommend these products. As soon as I heard they now have these Phonics DVD's I had to buy them. It's only been a couple weeks that he started watching these, but I'm confident he will learn a lot from them.",1361059200,,572,4.305555555555555

4903406,5,B005XNHHYQ,"I originally bought these because my 2.5 year old son had a hard time reproducing words, and I thought introducing him to new sounds would help his speech.  It worked... AND it taught him the basics of reading before he turned 3!  He absolutely loves these and asks to watch them all the time.  I can't recommend them enough for little visual learners.",1356220800,2,352,4.555555555555555

8488753,4,B005XNHHYQ,"I bought these for my special needs grandson, who learns better from an impersonal source i.e. Not a person. I think they do a good job, but  on the digraph DVD, being a fan of phonics, wish they would have gone over fewer digraphs and sounds at one time. It's almost too much info to take in at one time. But still one of the best I've seen.",1510012800,,342,4.029411764705882

8488757,1,B005XNHHYQ,"Got this for my grandsons.  They enjoy the dvds very much.  My criticism is the quality of the dvd itself.  After only a few playings, the dvd ""sticks"" in place and stops unexpectedly.  I don't know enough about the construction of a dvd, but for whatever reason, the quality is extremely poor.  Regardless of the quality of the content, it doesn't do much good if it can't be played.",1485388800,4,384,4.507246376811594
