the subtitiles are good, but I have started to notice a few errors here and there but they do not make it hard to understand the drama
 most of the subtitles are good though",1320192000,,200,4.128205128205129
4454329,5,B004QQ3MFE,Love the DVD...very nice addition to my collection. This story is quite interesting and plays out really well by the actors.  The kind of episodes you just want to see one after the other.  I am starting to get into viewing some of the Korean productions and they are just some very well made and photographed shows and so very well acted.  A great story and the actors are the best...HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for viewing!!!!,1316563200,,419,4.635135135135135
4454330,5,B004QQ3MFE,"Cute and Hilarious!  Two main characters fit well for this drama and held the storyline together from start to finish.  Other supporting actors brought their characters to life which made this drama a fave for me. At first I wasn't too sure, but it came through for me.",1314921600,,269,4.583333333333333
4454331,5,B004QQ3MFE,"Seriously, this manages to be cute and powerful at the same time.  It's a story of love which is willing to risk everything, even life itself for the loved one. It's a cute and funny romance story about a foxgirl who is addicted to meat. And somehow, it manages to weave these two together seamlessly, so it works. Everything, from Gu Mi-Ho's learning about human drinks like soda, from her learning about things like the fact that the other guy's blood is killing her, just sorta fits and molds together a wonderful story.",1311638400,,523,4.623655913978495
4454332,5,B004QQ3MFE,"I was a big fan of the series when it came out so as soon as I saw this I had to have it. As expected I am very glad I did. The series itself is amazing, it traps from the beggining and the actors are great, although I like Lee Seung Ki, Shin min ah is absolutely adorable here!
Now to the product itself, the package is quite sturdy and glossy, dvd's are packed nicely and I won't fear they might scratch or something.
The sound is pretty good and so are the subtitles, a little bit Americanized for my taste but It doesnt affect the story too much. Picture quality is great as well
It has a lot of extra material in the last disk and I liked that

I love the series and Im glad it has a package that does justice to it.

4454333,5,B004QQ3MFE,"First of all, I love folklore, so this immediately caught my interest when I heard about it and I had to buy it. It's perhaps one of the best DVD sets I have ever purchased, and I have purchased a LOT of DVDs over the years. Lee Seung Ki and Shin Min Ah have absolutely perfect chemistry in this show. I really like this sort of story and I think it was very well done without too much predictability (which would be boring). I really like the pacing in this show, which is slow sometimes and fast sometimes, but it always seems to go at the pace that I want.

The character development is absolutely great in this show. It's one of my major requirements for really loving a show, and it doesn't get much better than this. Every character is very deep and they all develop throughout the show, not just the leads. Every single character feels real, especially Mi-ho, even though she's a fox. Mi-ho is so incredibly cute in how she learns about society and learns to interact with other people, while at the same time teaching those around her a lot as well, even if they don't realize it. Maybe you can even learn a thing or two from her. If you haven't fallen in love with her after watching this show, I think you might want to see a doctor. Dae Woong started off as a bit annoying but by the end, his character had developed so much that I found myself a fan of both the character and the actor, Lee Seung Ki, as well.

It does have some plot devices used that I think go a bit too far and come close to breaking the fourth wall, which slightly bothered me, but they weren't so overdone to actually annoy me. It is also a bit campy at times but I expected that - I don't think this kind of show can exist without that. It's mainly from the secondary actors like Director Ban, and it's obviously intended because he's just an awkward character. And he does develop over the show, too. He was so awkward that he annoyed me at first, but like Dae Woong, I started to like his character along the way.

The production quality of the show is so-so in my opinion. Some of the scenes are shot well enough that I wouldn't be able to point out anything that I would change even if I tried. But there are several scenes that I just thought of as looking less good than they should have. I don't feel qualified to really point out all of the reasons that I might have thought that, but I think maybe either the cameras they used were not great, or perhaps they were just not set up like I would have wanted them. There are a lot of outdoor scenes where I think the video is just too bright and a bit washed out due to the bright sun. Outdoor scenes in bright sunlight are actually quite difficult to capture well, but I feel there were some scenes that they could have tried a bit harder on. Some scenes look really blurry for a recent production on DVD. These were things that I did notice as I watched it, but they weren't so bad or so common that it distracted me. This is probably one area that I am not qualified to rate, but if I had to, I'd say about a 6/10.

The DVD quality of this show is not that great. It is not very sharp or vibrant. It's not awful, but DVD is capable of a lot better than this. The video also gets garbled up once in a great while for a split second. I watched part of the show on my very recent computer and part of it on my home theater (PS3, DVDO Edge video processor, 50"" Panasonic G10 1080p plasma) and it was the same either way, so it's not my setup that's the problem. I actually do a lot of video processing work on my computer and my opinion is that there just wasn't much thought put into processing the video to help it look as good as it can - this is the case with most DVDs and only the big hits tend to get the extra attention to detail. On the positive side, I did not notice any composite video noise (dot crawl or rainbowing) which is something that I see in far too many DVDs. I did not notice any excessive noise like grain, blocking or ringing (mosquito noise). The main problems are simply the blurriness and the very occasional dropout. I wish there had been a little bit more attention paid here but none of it is so bad as to prevent me from enjoying the show. I'll give the video quality a 5/10.

The packaging is pretty basic but I am not one to care too much about packaging anyway. The case is pretty thin. There are two DVD cases each with 3 discs. They are nothing special but I had no problems with their ability to securely hold the discs. Nothing arrived loose (which I have had happen with many other DVDs) and when removing the discs from the case to play them, they felt like they were being held pretty securely, but they were not difficult to remove from the case like some are. It gets the job done and overall I prefer this over a brick case or a digipack, because these cases can at least be replaced if they ever crack or break. Digipacks can't and they never seem to hold the discs well enough in my opinion anyway. If they had included a few extras, I would have been even happier. Even just a nice booklet explaining the show and offering up some nice pictures from the show would have gone a long way in my opinion. I'll give the packaging a 4/10.

While I'm thinking about ratings, I suppose I should give one to the plot and characters. Well, my ratings go up to 11 here. 11/10 for both in my book. And that holds a lot more weight than the mediocre ratings I gave to the other stuff.

So, in short, if you like folklore and/or drama, buy this immediately. If you know someone who likes folklore and drama, but this for their birthday even when it's not what they asked for. If you don't like folklore or drama, start liking them and buy this! Seriously!",1310688000,5,5728,4.192377495462795
4454334,4,B004QQ3MFE,"I love this drama! The story may have the traditional Kdrama cliches, but it has it's own unique flavor that makes the story irresistible.  Shin Min Ah is surprisingly quite adorable and Lee Seung Gi is amazing as always.  This drama set is subtitled by YA so you know the quality of the video and subtitles will be great. I only take off one star because I wish they used the director's cut, or at least included some deleted scenes.  The price is quite reasonable, especially for such new release.",1307404800,,499,4.522222222222222
4454335,5,B004QQ3MFE,Really enjoyed this Cute Drama. We watched it live and enjoyed it so much I bought this set. The Subtitles are pretty good and definitely convey the conversation.  I hope these two (Lee Seung-gi & Shin Min Ah) do more movies / drama's together as they seem to be a great match.,1304726400,7,277,4.326923076923077
4454336,5,B004QQ3MFE,"I have been watching Korean dramas for a few years now. I have seen so many I don't remember all the names and sometimes it's hard to find one I haven't seen online. Palace, Full House, Coffee Prince, My Girl, You're Beautiful, and Delightful Girl Choon-hyang are some of my favorites.

My Girlfriend is a Gumiho PWNS them all.

It has every element needed in a Kdrama; the love interests who have to live together, the tension, the evil chick, and the other guy. But it also has more. There is a real plot going on during this series which makes it so much better.

And the characters are amazing. I feel like I fell in love with BOTH characters and they are definitely my new favorite couple. Dae-woong isn't your average kdrama brat; while he is spoiled, he's not rude and mean to everyone. He's a complete sweetheard. And Miho is so so innocent and adorable. It's like watching a big four year old!

This show is full of cuteness, and every night when I watching I was left squeeing on my couch. At one point I squealed so loud at four in the morning I was afraid my parents heard! IT IS JUST SO SO SO SO CUTE. And honestly for anyone who is trying to get their friends into dramas or forcing their boyfriend to watch one (muahahaha), this is a perfect start. There isn't much lame drama or bad acting, all the emotions are believable, and it will have you laughing the first five minutes into the show.

This is my new favorite and I preordered it a month before release. BUY IT! Even if you've never seen it, even if the only money you have is for food this week, BUY IT. It's worth going hungry for. Feast upon the awesomeness which is My Girlfriend is a Gumiho.

4454337,5,B004QQ3MFE,"I bought 'My Girlfriend is a Gumiho' because someone recommended it to me and I'm really glad I bought it. I loved every minute of it. The main actor and actress are a great funny duo that are charismatic and quickly win you over with their quirky ways. I loved the drama because it made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me smile, it was simply an emotional roller coaster that was worth it until the very end. The story was captivating and personally I believe it's a drama that is worth buying.",1298419200,,497,4.242105263157895
4454358,5,B004QQ3MFE,"This is a fun series.  We were unfamiliar with the gumiho myth, but it did not affect our enjoyment of the show.

Our children (10 and 7) loved the show.",1372204800,,153,4.066666666666666
4454359,5,B004QQ3MFE,"Having loved ""Painted Skin- the resurrection"" with its 9-tail fox character, I decided to give this a try.  If you liked ""Splash"", you will find this to your liking, as there are many similarities.
  What I found remarkable about this series was how all the characters grew and developed as individuals (even the silly aunt and her director boyfriend).  Nearly all the characters were to some degree self obsessed, and stunted by their narcissism.
  Released from her 500 year captivity in a painted scroll, Miho, the 9-tail fox , saves Dae-woong from fatal injuries, and tags onto him to keep her energy pearl close while he heals.  Dae Woong is suitably  scared when he comprehends that this crazy girl is a genuine 9-tail fox (imagine finding out your gorgeous new friend is also a werewolf!).
  He has ambitions of an action film career, and needs her energy pearl to achieve it.  All the while she is learning of life in modern Seoul, the joys of korean beef (this is an ongoing ad), and the subtleties of being human.
  Another character is a demon queller, who discovers she is the reincarnated spirit of a lover he lost centuries ago, and hasn't gotten over.
  Other characters are the sidelined girlfriend , the wannabe girlfriend oblivious to the attention of Dae-Woongs buddy, and the anxious grandfather who desperately wants Dae-Woong to grow up.
  This makes for a delightful blend of mythological fantasy, romance, and fun combining with a message of tolerance and caring for others.
  Miho is truly a foxy lady.",1369008000,3,1527,4.848837209302325
4454360,4,B004QQ3MFE,"This one was very entertaining and emotional. It has great leads and an interesting storyline that crosses fish out of water, lovers of different species and a young men's journey to be a better person. And it is hillarious too.
Highly recommended.",1368057600,,248,4.928571428571429
4454361,5,B004QQ3MFE,"I actually bought this series for my wife, but I also enjoyed it.  I do think it went a bit long in places; nonetheless, the overall story is quite good.",1362700800,,153,4.1
4454362,3,B004QQ3MFE,"First and foremost, this is a fantastic series.  Just a whole lot of fun.  Fun to see both characters grow as humans.  Where, in the west, having such powers would be considered a superhero and be envied, here her goal is to lose the powers and become human.  Likewise, while grudgingly helping her, he also grows as a person.  Very enjoyable to watch both journeys.  Really nice blending of Asian mythology, fantasy, with romantic comedy.  Could not tell how it would end until the last few minutes.

The subplot between the director and the sister a bit too much slapstick, but never lasts too long.

Having originally seen this as a HD broadcast, 1080, the DVD quality leaves something to be desired.  Granted, these are ""plain"" DVD's, not blu-ray.  Where the HD broadcast was CRYSTAL clear down to the smallest detail, these are not.  Adequate.

Should say something that the story is so great that I was willingly to pay for ""adequate"" DVD's.  It is worth the price of admission...",1362268800,,986,4.723529411764706

Lots of laugh out loud, just enough angst to be satisfying, plenty of cute, and a nice re-telling and new twist on the Gumiho myth. Of course there are plenty of cliches, and the aunt-director loveline is a tad on the annoying side, but all in all, a must see for the K-drama watcher.",1355616000,,450,4.369047619047619

I'd heard from my mother and her friends how addicting a Korean drama could be and when I saw this online, I decided to give it a go.  I was addicted!  Daewoong comes off a little annoying, but Miho was incredibely endearing!  I couldn't tear myself away from the series.  This for me was the first drama of many, apparently they're all super addicting!  The story is funny and unique and sad too.  It's a little predictable, but in a good way.",1350259200,,492,4.4

4454380,5,B004QQ3MFE,"This is one of those K-dramas that really gets you hooked and doesn't allow you to sleep because you want to find out what happens next. This isn't a ""silly"" supernatural drama, so don't let that stop you from watching it. It's very funny at the beginning, dramatic near the end, has a happy ending, and the music is some of the best of any drama. WATCH IT! I loved nearly all the characters, even the guy villain. This is one of my new favorites. Don't miss out on it!",1337472000,2,469,4.222222222222222
4454381,5,B004QQ3MFE,"Very cute show.  Light and joyful for most of the show.  Of course there is an element of melodrama but overall I laughed and smiled through most of it!  It seems geared at a slightly younger audience but enjoyable for all ages.  I love the element of folklore.  It made the show so interesting!  I absolutely fell in love with the male lead and the halfling vet (so cute!).  The female lead was beautiful and had so much personality.  Her character practically jumped right off the screen! The secondary characters (the aunt and director) were a bit over the top but fun.

Family viewing? So far this is the cleanest Korean drama I have watched.  There was one brief ""love"" scene they are watching on TV and a few comments on mating (after all she is a 9 tailed fox).  Overall I would give it a mild PG rating!",1337126400,,811,4.375838926174497
4454382,4,B004QQ3MFE,"MGIAG is truly excellent, no doubt. It's probably one of the best Korean Romantic comedies to come out within the past several years. The 2 main characters are terrific and have great chemistry together. The plot and subplots were generally good, although a little over-the-top at times with the cheeziness and just plain silliness. That being said however, it's still no match for ""Secret Garden"" which in my opinion is on another level.....truly one of the Best Korean Drama's out there, if not THE Best! Not only does Secret Garden have some of the most memorable characters I've ever seen in ANY movie (Korean, American, or otherwise), but the soundtrack alone is also worthy of an Academy Award. It's that awesome!",1336176000,,719,4.950413223140496

It was a fluke that I saw any of this series at all but after seeing the first couple episodes I was hooked and wanted to own the DVD set.  The characters in this story have some good depth and are well developed as the story line progresses.  The original dialog is Korean but the English sub-titles are well done.

She is adorable with her dimples and the child like character she portrays was fun to watch.  I was never into Korean dramas until my daughter introduced me.  Most of the ones that I have watched have been good, but My Girlfriend is a Gumiho is my all time favorite.  That is why I purchased the DVD box set.  If you have never watched a Korean drama series, you should watch this one.  I'm pretty sure you will love it.  It contains elements of fantasy, drama, and comedy.",1334707200,,631,4.473684210526316

4454386,5,B004QQ3MFE,"I had low expectations for ""My Girlfriend is a Gumiho"".  The title left me cold.  I was pretty sure it would be vapid and silly.  Kdrama, as good as it can be, can also be extremely frothy.  I bought it several months ago, but couldn't muster up the interest so I watched other dramas in the meantime, with varying degrees of interest.  Loved You're Beautiful, and cried a lot during that.  Liked  Coffee Prince but found it pretty middle of the road for Kdrama.  Liked Sungkyunkawn Scandal quite a bit.  Liked Secret Garden but not as much as You're Beautiful.  None of them were as good as Hana Yori Dango, or the Korean version of Boys over Flowers, but they kept me interested.  Finally I ran out of things to watch and decided to try ""My Girlfriend is a Gumiho""  About Half Way through the first episode, I realized that it was special.  The music, expecially the haunting ""Fire Rain"" by Lee Sun Hee, was expectional.  The writing fun and crisp and the cast, as usual in Kdrama, gorgeous and extremely talented.  But it was the two leads who were magical.  Lee Seung Gi as Daewoong, and Shin Min-Ah and the Gumiho ""Mi-Ho"" are remarkable, even  by Korean Standards.

As someone else here remarked, they are my new favourite couple of all time, replacing Jan Matsumoto Doumyouji Tsukasa, and Inoue Mao as Makino Tuskushi.  Their acting is the kind of deeply emotional character acting I haven't seen, maybe ever.  About Halfway through, MGIAG transforms from 70% froth / 30% depth, to the reverse.  Each episode, although still charming and funny, takes on a more tragic, heartbreaking overtone, as the child like, kind hearted Gumiho, played by the miraculously talented Shin Min-Ah, falls more in love with the ever more reluctantly in love Daewoong, played by the equally talented Lee Seung Gi.  In fact, if Shin Min-Ah with her stunning looks and quirky, natural and very effective acting style, runs away with the movie in the beginning, it is Lee Seun Gi as Daewoong who absolutely carries the series in the final two or three  episodes.  His interpretation of a heartbroken man who finds that he cannot save the life of the woman who betwitched his soul, is beyond belief.  I cried so hard I actually had to stuff my face in a pillow, and I cry just as hard every time I watch this, which is often.

Shin  Min-Ah and Lee Seun Gi will both charm and possess you in ways that make me think of classic Hollywood films like ""The Ghost and Mrs Muir"" or ""I married a Witch"".  The actors are that talented, and the Kdrama itself is wonderfully good natured and devoid of the  nudity, crudeness, bad language and bad attitudes that are hallmarks of American Cinema of the last few decades.  Which is one  reason so many people turn to Kdrama, or JDrama, etc.  I would much rather watch a romance which focuses on the romance than watch what passes for entertainment in Hollywood.

If you are a romantic, do yourself a favor and buy or rent ""My Girlfriend is Gumiho"", and make sure you stock up on the Kleenix, you're going to need it!",1328054400,,3036,4.573283858998145
4454387,5,B004QQ3MFE,"A ne'er-do-well rich kid Tae-Woong accidentally releases Mi-Ho, a nine-tailed fox who can transform into a beautiful girl, from a painting in a shrine in which she had been locked up for 500 years. Tae-Woong fell off the cliff and got fatally injured while running away from the shrine, but Mi-Ho gives her magical energy and saves him.

Mi-Ho follows him into the human world, and later learns how to be a human from a mysterious sorcerer Tong-Ju. She needs a human to help her out and although at first Tae-Woong was reluctant, he ends up making a deal with her when he realizes he also needs Mi-Ho's magical energy to star in an action movie while still recovering from the injury.

However by the time they realized there was a serious catch in the deal that Tong-Ju had not told them about - for Mi-Ho to be a human, Tae-Woong has to give up all his human spirit to Mi-Ho and die, otherwise Mi-Ho will die when she loses all her Kumiho spirit - they were deeply in love with each other and they are faced with the ultimate choice of survival and sacrifice.

I bought this for my Korean language study, but I have to say there is something truly magical about this drama. The magic is that it is a fantasy comedy, yet it is also about the ultimate sacrifice one can make for others, usually associated only with war dramas but without their heavy-handedness. It stays very light-hearted and comical yet very heartfelt and moving. It would have been even better without some brain-rotting TV soap stuff, evil antagonists and so on, but that may be asking too much.

The transformations of the two characters - good at heart but immature and irresponsible Tae-Woong and carefree, wide-eyed Mi-Ho to those who won't hesitate to make ultimate sacrifices for each other - are very well constructed. The scene where dying Mi-Ho watches someone else's wedding and reminisces the time 500 years ago when she waited for human suitors in vain, and then Tae-Woong arranges a photo shoot with Mi-Ho wearing red dots on her cheeks - a Korean tradition for brides - is one of the most poignant you will ever see in any drama, and I really mean it. It really put tears in this hardened old man's eyes.",1321315200,,2190,4.564885496183206

8438486,5,B004QQ3MFE,"One of my favorite k-Dram....no one of my favorite shows ever. Touching, funny, and thoroughly entertaining. Acting is top notch, especially the two leads. Shin Min-a and Lee Seung-gi have wonderful chemstry, and from episode 1 you'll be hooked and hoping these two knuckle heads end up together. There's lots of comedy, some of it very silly and very broad, while at other times surprisingly subtle but always very funny, and in just the right amount. This is an emotional series though, as (unless you are a robot) you'll find yourself attached to all the character's ups and downs (warning you'll want watch with a box of tissues, especially the second half of the series.) It reminded me a bit of the anime Seto no Hanayome (don't get me wrong they're quite different but both gave me the same warm fuzzy feeling) It's perfect series for dudes to watch with their girlfriends, or watch solo, either way this is a show not to be missed.",1393891200,,939,4.696969696969697

The female lead has nothing to contibute dramatically so all she can do is grin

The male lead could be replaced by a fire-hydrant.

The story was probably written on a lunch-break in downtown Seoul during s soju binge, on the back of a napkin.

THE MUSICCAL SCORE RENDERS THIS FARCE UNLISTENABLE---probably the most annoying score in all of recorded human history.

I wish i could give this a -5 (minus five).

8438490,5,B004QQ3MFE,"First of all let me begin by saying that I am an American guy who does not speak any Korean (although I have picked up a few words by watching several Subtitled films). I stumbled across this while searching for Asian Horror/Sci Fi movies on netflix. I am a big fan of Asian horror films-far more plot and suspense than U.S. movies. I almost skipped over this but after reading the description I decided to give it a go. I was hooked from the start! This is not a horror film/series it is more of a fantasy/drama/romance/comedy, and it excels in all areas. I will not go over the story because many of the other reviewers have already done so. I particularly enjoyed Shin Min Ah as the lead female charecter. She is not only beautiful but effectively portrays her role as the innocent,sweet and did I say beautiful Gumiho. Actually all the charecters are likeable. The musical score is excellent as well although I did not understand a word of it-no subtitles for the music. This is one of the best TV shows I have ever seen, period. I was actually sorry when it ended and found out there is no season 2. Apparently this was a single season show, what a disappointment. Do yourself a favor and watch it, this series was thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish. ""Arang and the Magistrate"" with Shin Min Ah was also excellent with a great score as well. If there are any other good K-Dramas like this out there please let me know.",1377475200,,1430,4.461832061068702
