8359401,2,B002AFX58M,This film falls into the foreign film/art category. It jumps around and is a bit hard to follow.  Not the best film.,1467072000,,116,4.2727272727272725
8359402,4,B002AFX58M,it was good movies,1456963200,,18,3.75
8359403,4,B002AFX58M,The movie reminded me of B. Bertolluccis' movie:  The Dreamers. Similar storyline of the young and goodlooking and spoiled French kids who were all anti-establishment. All were experimenting on drugs and diffferent sexual partners. Finally realizing all these things shall come to pass. Realizing that maturity and good judgment are all that matters.,1454198400,,350,5.60377358490566

8359405,3,B002AFX58M,"This was an account of gay rights activists in 1970s France.  There's a lot of parallels to the film ""Stonewall.""

I want to mention the most memorable moment.  A gay activist was arguing for gay rights during a leftist event and straights beat him up and said leftism and gays don't mix.  An important gay international rights group started due to homophobia in the Soviet Union.  Though possibly gay-friendly now, Cuba once rounded up its gays into camps.  Author Helen Zia once recalled how Detroit labor activists of color told her she was forbidden from hanging with lesbians if she wanted to be with them.  Though the ACLU has a gay rights project now, during the 1950s it refused to touch the issue.  For anyone who's ever been told, ""You can't be one of us if you are gay or support gay rights!"", then this scene will make your hair stand up and give you flashbacks.

The US gay rights movement of the 1970s was heavily influenced by feminism and liberal activists.  You see those groups in this French work, but one issue is conspicuously missing.  Remember all the Black and Puerto Rican queens in ""Stonewall""?  This film is entirely white.  That's fine: France isn't as diverse as the US.  However, all the 1970s movements in the US were influenced by the Civil Rights Movement and not even hearing the word ""race"" in this film was an eye-opener.

This film was clearly made on a limited budget.  The camera comes way too close to ppl's faces.  Two of the actors looked so much like each other that I found it confusing.  There are women here, so this has that Will-and-Grace feel.  When Ebert and Roeper reviewed ""Bend It Like Beckham,"" they warned American audiences not to let the strangeness of the title turn them off.  The title here refers to the camera the main character records events on.  Imagine if it were called ""My Polaroid Summer"" or something like that.

The Napoleonic Codes got rid of sodomy laws a century before English-speaking places did.  Remember in ""Maurice"" when a psychologist told Maurice he should move to France or Italy if he couldn't change his sexual orientation?  Well, some say gay rights and sexual orientation are not the divisive issues in France as they are in the US, so it was surprising to see gays organizing around gay rights when I've heard they really didn't do that as much.",1266451200,3,2333,4.661764705882353
8359406,5,B002AFX58M,"This film blew me away.  It was like reliving my life, except that it was not Paris, it was New York in the 60's and 70's.  What I liked the best was the total honesty in depicting the different factions and interactions between gays, straights, lesbians, bisexuals, one-timers, and the gradual disappearance of the revolutionary spirit as they are all absorbed into dominant discourse.  Beautifully done, even down to the bothersome movie camera (I remember a time when absolutely everything had to be filmed). The protagonist is absolutely beautiful.  And please, do not compare this movie to Bertolucci's major turkey.",1253145600,3,621,5.18
8359407,1,B002AFX58M,Ultra slow moving  film. The shakey hand held camera work  and the  day for night photography (blue sky  at night) was  very annoying to watch. Bertolucci did it far better and sexier with his erotic film THE DREAMERS  which handled the same subject.,1249084800,2,250,4.6976744186046515
