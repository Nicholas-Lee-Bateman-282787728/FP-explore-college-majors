5090413,5,B007IXS7MU,"I thought this was an interesting film covering Margaret Thatcher's political life as well as a glimpse into her personality.  I watched The Iron Lady movie that was made in Hollywood and
was very disappointed that it was mainly about her dementia and life in retirement.
This documentary from the UK was so much better!!!",1338422400,19,322,4.8545454545454545

5090420,5,B007IXS7MU,I am very glad that this DVD was available. I really liked the movie with Meryl Streep who portrayed this woman to perfection.

5090422,4,B007IXS7MU,"A little dry and historical, but worth watching because of the fact that Margaret was one of the greatest leaders of the 20th century.  A fact which this movie confirmed.",1371772800,2,170,4.666666666666667

5090425,1,B007IXS7MU,"Big Disappointment
With a great actor Meryl Streep playing the role of one of the most influential women of our times,
I was expecting to watch a good movie. To my surprise the movie was a big flop.
The video and acting were good, but the plot was extremely dull. I mean really boring!
I can't image how this movie made it to the Box office, other than the names Streep and Thatcher in the title.",1370736000,,396,4.223684210526316
8518104,2,B007IXS7MU,"For Maggie I wanted to give this movie a five. I wonder if the writers were hoping we would swallow this Debby Downer & biased history of one of the greatest Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom?  The Iron Lady, lover her or hate her saved the UK from the malaise of socialism, and low moral. She boosted the UK by winning the Faklands War and selling off state nationalized companies. Less we forget her warnings about the EEC and its possible federalization and consequences on the independence of the UK. But No!  In stead they open the movie on what they made out as a doting old lady in mental and physical decline daydreaming of her mediocre career!  Appalling pertrail of a once great women. I guess thats what Hollywood wants to brainwash you to think of Conservative women who make a real and positive change on not only her country but in the world too.",1525305600,,864,4.490445859872612
8518105,1,B007IXS7MU,"The Iron Lady, 2011 film

A woman buys a pint of milk at a grocery. [The story proceeds slowly. What was its purpose?] There is a flashback to the bombing of WW II. Margaret helps her father at his store (like a good daughter should). The TV tells about an explosion at a Brighton hotel. Next Miss Roberts is chosen as a Conservative candidate for Parliament. She explains her viewpoints. [The film keeps skipping from the present to the past. This is confusing to anyone who knows little of her history.] Margaret will marry Dennis but wants to be more than a housewife. In retirement she watches old home movies of her children. They grow up so fast. She wins a seat in Parliament in 1959 (because of a divided opposition). Welcome to the madhouse. She makes a speech. A strike stops garbage collection and other services. There was a coal miners strike over lowered wages circa 1972.

Margaret decides to run for leader of the party on principle. A man advises her on her appearance to attract voters. She takes voice lessons to project her image. A friend is killed by a bomb! In 1979 she became the first woman Prime Minister in the Western World. [The film jumps ahead again.] Baroness Thatcher was called The Iron Lady. She cut the budget and privatized services. [So how did that work out for the British?] Did she change the face of history? Did her policies cause a drop in industrial production? Were people becoming impoverished? There was growing unemployment. Bombs are set off! The Argentinians invaded the Falkland Islands. Maggie said sink the Belgrano (as it was returning home). An Exocet missile hits British frigate. The British retake the Falkland Islands. This victory proves popular and boosts her standing. She asks for new taxes on everyone and accuses those who disagree with her of cowardice. [Has she grown proud and arrogant?] There are disturbances in the streets.

The jumping back and forth in the first half of this movie makes it difficult to follow if you know little of the details of her life. It should have followed the historical sequence. You see actors who represent actual politicians; they are unknown to those who know the details of British politics. Thatcher destroyed the national coal industry to make the country dependent on imported oil and gas [as far as I know]. This benefitted these special interests. The future will decide if this was a correct decision.

There was a military coup in Argentina in the mid-1960s (part of the Alliance for Progress). It led to the oppression of the people. They attempt to reclaim the Falkland Islands with an invasion. This failure led to their overthrow and a more democratic government. The same thing happened in Greece a decade earlier. Is there a lesson here?

I wonder about the powers that first backed Maggie Thatcher then switched to a new leader (she was rejected by her own party). There was no mention of this in the movie. Was Great Britain in better shape after her reign as Prime Minister? What corporations promoted her?",1518825600,,3028,4.782026768642448

8518109,3,B007IXS7MU,"We saw a short blurb on Margaret Thatcher on the TV and wanted to know more about her life and career in British politics.  Unfortunately, the documentary wasn't as interesting as we expected, plus if it was accurate, Margaret didn't do as much as we thought nor was she as influential and as dynamic as we believed.",1472256000,,316,4.543859649122807
8518110,5,B007IXS7MU,Nice and factually accurate.,1465603200,,28,6.25
8518111,4,B007IXS7MU,"This DVD is an intriguing look at the late Margaret Thatcher, British Prime Minister from 1979 to 1990.  Her humble beginnings are explored as well as her family life, foray into politics as a wife and mother of young twins, rise within the Conservative Party, and reign as Prime Minister, Britain's first woman to hold the position.

Highlights of her major speeches are included here as are her leadership in the Falklands War; near-assassination during the 1984 IRA bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton; dealings with cabinet members, foreign leaders, and the Queen; and much more.

I really enjoyed this DVD, but the reason for the 4 instead of 5 stars was due to the bias of the interviewees/commentators.  Even though they acknowledged Thatcher's accomplishments, they did so without enthusiasm and were more interested in discussing the negatives of her tenure.  One of them actually complained about the sound of her voice!  There could have been more of a balance on this documentary, I felt, by also featuring Thatcher's supporters, both inside and outside the political realm.

But do not let this flaw dissuade you from buying this product...a fascinating look at history and leadership in the 20th century.",1464912000,,1221,5.075
8518112,5,B007IXS7MU,"This is a woman I personally wish could have ran for our Presidency! Talk about Woman Power, she had it & proved it! She had no one to fend for her in the arena of political MEN. This woman rose above and proved how decisive & powerful & GODLY a woman can be. Many laughed at her & put her down. But the proof lies in her handling & Leadership of her country. GOD IS STRONG & we all need to be strong to be the best, Not to cry & succumb to mediocrity like what our country has embraced! To become the greatest at something you need perseverance & a strong will to excel. Unfortunately, our nation has become extremely soft in every way & this has been the reason for The United States Of America to now be much less than what it once was. We need people such as this woman to help guide & direct us back on track so as to hopefully be able to once again triumph & become the most Wonderful & Greatest country in the world! PLEASE LET ME MAKE ONE THING PERFECTLY CLEAR! What I have said about Margaret Thatcher is by no means related to the upcoming 2016 Presidential election &/or Ms. Hilary Clinton. Yes I would recommend purchasing this engrossing documentary from AMAZON!",1444608000,,1175,4.25
