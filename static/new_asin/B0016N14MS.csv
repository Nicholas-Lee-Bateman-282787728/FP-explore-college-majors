8263428,5,B0016N14MS,"I have to admit, I cannot get enough of educational material like this, the Politically Correct movement is keeping people from hearing the truth, Islam is not a religion of peace, it never really was. It is more accurate to term it a religion of intolerance and hatred. I have been studying about Islam for about 5 years now and still can't get over the fact most Americans are in denial of the truth about Islam. Along with this video I would recommend Obsession and the Third Jihad to anybody wishing to know the true enemy to freedom. Buying these for Christmas and birthday gifts are one way to help people around you wake up whether they want to or not. After hearing Bush say the nineteen punks on 9-11 hijacked a peaceful religion I feel all government officials should be required to watch material such as this. The fact our CIA and FBI use Muslim translators tells me we are headed in the wrong direction fast.",1265068800,5,921,4.520958083832335
8263429,5,B0016N14MS,"This video makes it clear that there are no small number of Muslims who are allowed to live in the US who subscribe to the same ideas and believe in the same methods as those Islamists who murder and oppress throughout the rest of the world. This is perhaps the most serious problem to face the US in particular and the West in general. It is a problem that has existed since the beginning of Islam, i.e., for more than a millennium, but only in the past 30 years or so has the West begun to take it seriously. This problem must be dealt with, and willfully ignoring the facts will not only not solve the problem but only allow it to get even worse. Excellent and important video.",1252454400,4,680,4.27906976744186
8263430,5,B0016N14MS,"This is by far one of the most documented reports that I have seen, to date, on the Islamic Terrorist Camps that are springing up all over our country. One would almost need to be an Islamic Sympathizer to not grasp the reality documented in this video. Americans better wake up before it is too late.",1251417600,6,301,4.392857142857143
8263431,1,B0016N14MS,"In a word: caution. There is ample historical evidence and solid investigative analysis available to counter this fear mongering documentary. ""The War on Terror"", as we have been forced by mainstream media to understand it, has nefarious and problematic beginnings, beginning with the JCIT conference in 1979 (google). This paradigm of irreparable East-West tension, as many westerners now comprehend it, is largely a neoconservative fabrication and needs to be deconstructed as such. Taking this particular ""terror"" model as such and ramping it up for U.S. domestic application is a serious threat to the preservation of our constitutional rights and should rightly be suspect of complicity with the worst elements within national security and intelligence agencies the world over. As a counterbalance to this fear piece I highly suggest that the viewer check out another documentary, ""Fabled Enemies"" by Jason Bermas. Every thinking individual with half an open mind must become familiar with the term ""false flag operation"". The Islamic jihadists that have been sold to us, cartoon-like in their seemingly unstoppable evil, are the ""best enemy money can buy"", and have been used to justify an emperial enterprise responsible for the death and suffering of millions of lives in the Middle East within the last decade.",1245974400,,1319,5.407766990291262
8263432,5,B0016N14MS,This documentary reveals the real danger we all face from Islamic Jihad.  The facts are clearly presented and indisputable.  Buy this video and share it with all the people you care about.,1206835200,12,188,4.84375
8263433,5,B0016N14MS,"Jihad USA and E. D. Hill were superb. All Americans should watch this program. Realistic Americans should awaken to the real threat of Islamic terrorism. From now on it will be home grown. Islam means submission, total submission to Allah, his prophet and the  Koran . Islam is the Koran.
All of the Islamic terrorists have studied and learned their mission from the Koran, just as Bin Laden did.
