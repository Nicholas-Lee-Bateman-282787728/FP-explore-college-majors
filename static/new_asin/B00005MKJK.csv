7946029,5,B00005MKJK,My son wanted this movie so I ordered it for him and he said it was really good and he enjoyed it very much,1391817600,2,107,3.5
7946030,4,B00005MKJK,"I would compare this most to the Faces Of Death series due to the large amount of aftermath footage meaning shots of mangled bodies, murder scenes, etc.  Common sense says that if you haven't seen or aren't familiar with the Faces Of Death and similar videos, then do not purchase this video.  It's gory, bloody and gruesome in the actual deception of death so it is not for the faint of heart.

The video itself is just a collection of clips, can't get much simpler than that.  If you've seen this style of videos before, it's not a bad addition to your ""special interest"" DVD collection especially with the motorcycle crash scene.",1274745600,3,632,4.616071428571429
