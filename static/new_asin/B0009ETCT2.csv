8059672,1,B0009ETCT2,"This DVD purports to be on a train called ""The AMRTAK Broadway Limited"" from New York to Chicago.  However. AMRTAK does not or never has had a train called the Broadway Limited.  The Broadway Limited was a Pennsylvania RR Creation - probably the finest Streamliner of the century, but was decommissioned and taken out of service in 1995.  AMTRAK did not pick up the name for one of its trains.  DVS presents false information,",1481328000,2,426,4.716216216216216

8059675,2,B0009ETCT2,"Through much of this DVD, it seemed that I was watching a commercial for Amtrak: not so bad, but not what I was anticipating. As other reviewers have indicated, a lot of time is spent exploring the cities along the way; that's not so bad for me, but not nearly enough time is spent with the actual, nuts-and-bolts experiences involved in train travel. But the biggest disappointment is that one of three train routes covered, the Desert Wind, no longer exists, having been discontinued in 1997; it seems that the description and/or packaging should make this clear. Las Vegas may be a nice city, but it is not currently accessible by Amtrak rail (thoughyou can get there on a Greyhound bus).",1444953600,2,691,4.7190082644628095

8059677,5,B0009ETCT2,i loved this dvd. I didn`t mind that i saw alot of the cities along the way. Very informative. it brings back memories for me when i traveled from dc to la when i was a kid. Good dvd.,1410480000,,183,3.717948717948718
8059678,2,B0009ETCT2,"The production cost of this movie must have been near zero. It appears to be mostly stock footage from the 70s or 80s. Modern narration, but everything shown appears very dated. I bought it because I wanted to see the Amtrak trains. It is probably 80% cities, 20% trains. This would be nice for instructional use, but in terms of home entertainment it's a real bore.",1360368000,5,366,4.5606060606060606

8059680,2,B0009ETCT2,Although it is named The Great American Train Ride it should be called a visit to Americas Cities. More time is spent exploring numerous stops along the way than is spent showing train travel across the US.,1135814400,15,206,4.594594594594595
