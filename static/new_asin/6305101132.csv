7882883,4,6305101132,"This DVD, the fifth and final volume in the Titanic: The Mystery & the Legacy set, offers a final summary of the Titanic story, taking us from her launch at Southampton to her watery grave in the North Atlantic.  Vintage photographs and sketches combined with actual video footage from the time are used to present the story of that fateful maiden voyage.  This information is complemented by interviews with Walter Lord, author of the bestselling book A Night to Remember, and Walter McQuiddy, director of the famous film based on Lord's account, along with clips from the legendary film itself.  In many ways, this video is a rehash of information and illustrations already presented in the preceding four volumes of the series.  Repetitive it may be, but in terms of telling the story of the actual sinking, this volume offers more to the viewer than its companion offerings, all of which seem to inevitably devolve into uninteresting discussions of modern-day celebrations and memorials of the Titanic tragedy.",1050192000,3,1014,5.053892215568863
