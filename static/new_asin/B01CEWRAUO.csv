7682645,5,B01CEWRAUO,Great music!  Ms. Gardot is backed by phenomenal musicians and her voice is perfection.  The blu ray captures the music providing an all encompassing concert experience at home.  Almost as good as being there!  Almost!,1470787200,,218,5.142857142857143

7682649,5,B01CEWRAUO,"Fabulous !!! I've followed her music since her first record. Her personal backstory is fascinating. The performance on this disc is a musical TEN. Her current persona & music are darker & more mysterious than her earlier work  ~  both are incredible. I've never heard a singer who can sing as softly & still fill the room w/her voice. This performance showcases all of her many talents  ~  emotive vocals, soulful lyrics, imaginative instrumentation & musicianship & a singer that you can't take your eyes off of. Someday, I will buy her a beer.",1467072000,4,545,4.76595744680851

7682652,4,B01CEWRAUO,"Melody Gardot caught my ear with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Worrisome-Heart-Album-Version/dp/B001453LBA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Worrisome Heart (Album Version)</a>, and I fell in love with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-One-And-Only-Thrill/dp/B001NESPHC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My One And Only Thrill</a>. She hasn't toured much in the U.S. since she attracted my attention eight years ago; the closest she came to me during the all-too brief U.S. leg of her 2015 tour was Chicago, so this concert film in many respects represents the closest I've gotten so far to seeing her perform live.

On the technical side: Instruments all sound terrific and are clear throughout the show, which isn't always the case. Kudos to the audio recorders and engineers for this! Mme. Gardot's vocals, though, are more of a mixed bag, especially when she talks to the audience. Some of what she said was too softly spoken for me to hear it without raising the overall volume beyond where I favored it. She also speaks quite a lot in French, way beyond my rudimentary grasp of the language. Thankfully, the Blu-ray is equipped with subtitles that capture and translate all of her spoken dialogue. The captions do not, however, provide song lyrics. Personally, I favored that arrangement, as it let me follow along with her banter without distracting me from the music. It doesn't help that the audience is nearly inaudible, which creates a sense that much of that banter fell flat.

The camera footage is pretty standard for a concert film (there really isn't a whole lot of physical room for much innovation), but the editing is dubious. Frequently, it felt as though director Thierry Villenueve was worried we would become bored watching a static image and jump cut frenetically to compensate. A lot of those cuts felt incongruous with the flow of the music being performed, which is unfortunate. It shows either a lack of understanding for the performance or a lack of trust in the audience.

As for the concert itself as presented, I'll confess that a year after it dropped, I'm still not entirely sure how I feel about&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Currency-Of-Man-Deluxe-Edition/dp/B00UNYJQ76/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Currency Of Man [Deluxe Edition</a>], the album from which the lion's share of the set list originated. ""Don't Misunderstand"" and ""Morning Sun"" were more engaging here than on record, so that was nice, but ""Preacherman"" doesn't have nearly the heft or poignancy on-stage as its recorded version. ""Les Etoiles"" from the aforementioned ""Worrisome Heart"" is a pure delight, as are ""Baby I'm a Fool"" and ""Who Will Comfort Me"" from ""My One and Only Thrill"". Conspicuously absent is any representation from Gardot's third album,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Absence/dp/B0073PPKNM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Absence</a>.

Gardot herself is physically livelier than I anticipated. I suspect that was achieved partly by cutting together footage from two consecutive nights, but even so, for a performer noted for using a cane on-stage and remaining seated at her piano or on a stool for much of her set, seeing her bounce up and down was nearly revelatory. It was genuinely heartwarming to see that level of exuberant exertion!

Overall, ""Live at the Olympia Paris"" is an interesting document of one of my favorite contemporary artists at a seminal stage in her creative evolution, which makes it perhaps the most fitting occasion for a concert film.",1462492800,17,3648,5.836772983114447
