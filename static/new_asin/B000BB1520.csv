2409823,5,B000BB1520,"I saw this on the History Channel, spread over two nights. So I am not talking about the DVD , as I don't have it yet, but about the movie as shown on TV.

They covered the first three crusades, and were pretty in depth with the coverage. They talked about the different personalities, the politics, religon, the different lands, the cities and towns, and the battles that composed the Crusades. It was all very well put together, and let you see the events from the different points of view.

I plan on ordering it, once its out. If you are a history buff, and interested in the Crusades, then I suggest getting this.",1131408000,30,618,4.412280701754386
2409824,5,B000BB1520,"I received this advanced review copy from the promotional company working for the History Channel.  I must admit that they sent me a very nice package and a bonus disk.  This is an eight sided box, like a two pound box for candy - lovely print job.  The two disks are contained in a book inside the box, along with a CD disk of photos - some from the production, others are historical pictures of either the key players or events/places.  A very nice package, though it will not fit on your DVD shelf.  Also, one of the pages in my book was stapled in upside down.  Still, a nice presentation.  Not sure if this product will be the same when released.

Apart from this, the work itself is very interesting.  I sat through the entire production and was never bored or antsy.  Actually, I found myself marveling at what the History Channel has done here.

The program covers the First Crusade on the first disk. There is an examination of the causes of the initial conflict, examining cultural issues, Religious issues, European social and political unrest, Church influences, financial issues and points of conflict in the Moslem and Byzantine world.  While Religion is acknowledged as the primary cause of the conflict, they also do not ignore key issues that lead to these conflicts.  There is also discussion of Urban's ""selling of the Crusades"".  Very well put together and an in depth examination of the events leading up to the First Crusade.

Included also are maps of the areas, modern day images of the cities today as well as places that have survived, and those that have not.

There is a lot of information to sift through here.  While the story is carefully laid out and well developed in order of events, the program purposefully comes across as a story woven by an expert story teller.  Even the added discussions by such noted scholars as Dr. Thomas Asbridge, Tariq Ali, Prof. John France and Dr. Taef el-Azhari, to name a few, comes across as additional parts of the storytelling.

There are the usual added ""tidbits"" thrown in by the History Channel, like uncovered bits of text to give clarification to some accounts and the discovery of a location of a famous battle that up to now had been unknown.

Emphasis appears to be on key battles, as these are reenacted for the viewer.  These are provided by Lion Television, and are nice additions to the material.  They keep the viewer interested as this material could get rather dry if not for points of interest like this.

The second disk covers the Second and Third Crusades.  Again, social and political climates are discussed and examined.  Again, the story is covered in a ""timeline"" of events from the vantage point of the chroniclers.

We are presented with the fall of Edessa, the calling of the Second Crusade, the rise of Nur-el-Din, the battle for Damascus, Egypt and Sal-al-Din and the arrival of Richard the Lionheart in the Holy Land for the Third Crusade.

Again, key battles are reenacted, strategies discussed, failures noted and by the end of the film we are looking at a very good wrap up of the entire program.

Conflict, social upheaval, cultural differences, battle strategies, religious zealots and the lust for war and violence all comes through as the story of the Crusades unfolds in this production.  We see the heroes, and the vile nature of the event itself.  Nothing is left glossed over.  There is some romanticism here, as the chroniclers tended to be very bias towards their benefactors, but on the other hand, we also see the social and political issues that were key to the events that took place.  And while not shown, there is discussion of the atrocities and barbarism that was prevalent during these events.

This is a good overview of the events that took place starting 1099 and which continued for about 200 years.  There are some events that are more examined than others, and some key figures that are discussed in some detail.  It was, however, very entertaining, factual and well worth, I felt, the time I spent watching it.  medievalcrusadesbabe",1130284800,175,4059,4.748571428571428

2409868,4,B000BB1520,"This was really quite an enjoyable documentary set.

The History channel has here produced a three episode history of the Crusades in a accessible manner with good production values (OK it doesn't look like a Hollywood blockbuster but they obviously spent a bit knowing the subject matter had financial possibilities) and the entire series comes across as having a judicious blend of re-enactment, talking head experts and scope.

The three total running time of 180 minutes means they had the time to give enough detail to the layman and to get the most out of the money they spent on production values while at the same time not getting bogged down in endless minutia or overly academic aspects of the Crusades. The is a lot of time spent talking about things from multiple viewpoints and it makes for interesting viewing.

Those hankering after detailed exposes on the arms and armour aspects of the crusades or the architectural remains such as castles that are still extant today will perhaps not find as much here than the person wanting a good general overview. The way the series starts from the beginning, so to speak, and then leaves off at the end of the Islamic conquest of the area makes the show nicely book ended. It does not then pursue the Islamic conquests of the final vestiges of the Byzantine Empire nor the various addenda conflicts such as the siege of Rhodes or Malta. It stays focussed on what the period of the first few Crusades.

I suppose you could argue against the total exclusion of any mention of the Peoples Crusade or the sack of Constantinople by later crusaders. And certainly those with a more academic bent will probably want to immerse themselves in text books. But for the average history buff there is much here to like.",1412467200,3,1762,4.748366013071895

2409872,1,B000BB1520,"Islam had begun to take over the known world. Islam had not only extended its reach to Egypt, much of Africa, the middle east, but also eastern Europe all the way to the Chinese border. Then it began to cover western Europe: France, Spain, Portugal, Italy an into Germany. This being said, the crusades was the orchestrated movement to drive them out of Europe. This was the goal. The end of the crusades was said to be accomplished when the Holy Land was freed from their dominance. (what we are seeing in the world today of Islamic infiltration into many countries of world, is a repeat of Islams earlier push to dominate the world).

A few years ago I studied the Islamic wave and all the wars they conducted against the peoples of the world but just recently a bought a documentary from the History channel (3.5 hours long) and it began by saying the purpose of the Crusades was to re-take Jerusalem. This is totally not true, it is the media version and what current political thinking would like you to believe. Jerusalem was little more than a side issue at the time. It was to be the end of the crusades, not the cause. The push-back of Islam has held the muslims at bay until the need for their oil, an because of that oil they now have the finances to force the easement of immigration laws and to once again infiltrate the world for the purpose of world domination. By the way, after the first five minutes of the History Channel documentary, I put the dvds back in the box.",1405555200,17,1485,4.43956043956044

I personally liked seeing the different viewpoints, and they clearly brought in people who knew their stuff - it's how they arranged the information and edited what the experts said that bothers me and makes me rate the show so poorly. I always enjoy dramatizations, though, and Crescent and the Cross had many of those.",1403568000,3,617,4.876190476190477
2409876,3,B000BB1520,"This was a very interesting show. It only covers the first three crusades, and the coverage of that is a bit superficial. Certainly, the causes and motivations for the Crusades could have been covered better. This might be explained by the slight bias towards the Muslim side. It is better balanced than some of the other reviewers indicate, however.

Unfortunately, two scenes with one particular historian interview pretty much ruined it for me:

First, after Saladin defeated one particular set of crusaders, he beheaded all the captured knights except the leader himself. Please note that the war was over, and Saladin had won. There was no real tactical advantage to executing the prisoners. Yet, one Middle Eastern historian describes this positively as some great display of power and prestige on the part of Saladin.

Later, the same professor describes a different occasion, when Richard I was being besieged. In this case, Richard had a large number of Muslim prisoners. He firstly offered to do a prisoner exchange. Saladin refused for the obvious tactical reasoning. Richard could not feed them without reducing his own troops rations. So, Richard chose to execute them. The historian presents this as some sort of war crime!

Why did History Channel let this pass? Saladin had no necessity to kill those knights, yet his murders were a great thing. Richard had sound tactical reasons for killing his prisoners, and even tried another alternative first. In addition, this was kind of bad history. The historian left out facts that actually support his position that Richard's act was a war crime - that Richard (after waiting a month) reportedly ordered the executions out of anger, and that the prisoners weren't all soldiers, but included women and children ...

The crusades were a shameful enough episode in Christian history that we really don't need this sort of obvious propaganda being presented as history.",1403049600,5,1927,5.124203821656051

Instead of history, the mini series contain an amazing amount of pro-Muslim propaganda wrongly depicting the history and feats of the christian crusaders. History will show that there were good and evil feats committed by both sides, but this series goes beyond this. True history buffs will find it hard to watch past the first 15 minutes of the first episode due to the glaring inaccuracies.

Simple facts:
The church NEVER sanctioned crusaders as martyrs - this was an Islamic only tradition.
The modern middle east was part of the eastern Roman empire and was built by Romans, Greeks, Jews and other dominions. Islam did not arrive until the middle 7th century.
The Muslims were invading Roman empire land, the Romans were there before the Muslims.
If it weren't for the brave crusaders who laid down their lives for us back then, today we would ALL be Muslim and facing the east while praying 5 times a day.

Although the producers presented both Christian and Muslim historians' points of view, I found a slight bias in favor of the Muslims as I watched this History Channel presentation of how and why, after 400 years of Muslim rule, the first Crusade to return Jerusalem to the Christians began. Overall, I enjoyed the presentation and it almost gives one the feeling of watching a narrated movie. The DVD presents the history of the three Crusades in two parts - Part One: The First Crusade and Part Two: The Second and Third Crusades. The audio and video quality of the DVD are very good to excellent, although there are no subtitles or captions and there are no extra features on the DVD. The DVD runs approximately 180 minutes and it contains a wealth of history and facts. For anyone interested in learning about the Crusades I recommend this DVD as a good overview of the historical conflict and battles between Christians and Muslims known these many centuries later as The Crusades.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-History-Channel-Presents-The-Crusades-Crescent-the-Cross-Blu-ray/dp/B001KBZ38W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The History Channel Presents: The Crusades - Crescent & the Cross [Blu-ray</a>]",1332633600,6,1536,5.540425531914893
2409894,4,B000BB1520,"I have watched The Crusades twice and find the contends very informative. Well presented from both the Moslem and Christian views, it cuts across the historical aspect very fairly from both sides. History tends to be exaggerated when related by the people concerned, who will try to glorify and justify their own actions. The Crusades highlighted atrocities on both sides when the Knights broke the 6th Commandments by killing and King Richard the Lionheart committed war crimes by killing two thousand Moslems. Saladin and other Moslem leaders were equally brutal during their rampages. This video shows the origin of the words 'assassin' and 'Jihad'. It is hoped that everyone will leave The Crusade as being historical and not re-start another Crusade.",1318896000,10,755,5.24793388429752

I just want to state simply that this documentary is one-sided, mis-leading, and biased. I think it is attempting to be politically correct at the expense of being historically innacurate (or at least mis-leading).

It is obvious to any historian of the crusades that there were atrocities and wrong-doings on both sides, but this presentation simply points out and emphasizes Christian wrongdoing. There were many instances where Muslims intruded into Christian lands before the first crusades...they took over the Iberian peninsula, they pillaged and slaughtered and enslaved...they don't mention the wholesale massacre of over 1,000 Christian pilgrim prior to the first crusade.

Why does this documentary leave so much out at the expense of Christianity? Don't buy this. There is better out there.",1299888000,27,930,5.319727891156463
2409897,4,B000BB1520,"It is difficult to balance edutainment with this kind of expansive topic.

It treats the first through third crusades. I was disappointed that the video did not even acknowledge other crusades, such as those in Spain and in the Baltics, or that many other campaigns continued long well into the late 14th century. The video is well produced and could serve probably as a starting point for many, but there is really so much more that could and should have been brought into focus, especially the pilgrimage routes that preceded the Crusade and made these possible - you need a tremendous amount of logistics already in place to be able to move that many people, a not unrelated topic could also have been the mention as how when these logistic points started to disappear, these large armies ravaged the land on their way to Jerusalem, as well as left a tremendous impact on widows (if they stayed home) - whose husbands had spent everything to go crusading. In many areas, when many of these men without sons died, the property went to the church, since women did not have the right to inherit. Still, at the end of the day, this video should be recognized for what it does do well, and that is create further interest, albeit leaving a lot left unsaid.",1287705600,5,1254,4.623318385650224

2409901,1,B000BB1520,"This is essentially revisionist history.  It has some well made reenactments with good costumes and sets, but it doesn't spend much time on details that might present an unbiased history of the Crusades. For example, there was no mention of the fact that the Muslim armies had conquered the Iberian Peninsula and had been actively trying to conquer the Franks for 3 centuries.  The 'learned historians' that are interviewed only seem to know about the improper activities of the Crusaders.  The bonus material includes a timeline that repeats the same shallow history, and a segment of ""In Search of History"" about The Knights Templar that perpetuates some of the sordid rumors about the order without giving a lot of good factual information.

A much better introduction to the Crusades is given in ""The Knights Templar"" directed by James Wignall.  It gives as much information about the Crusades with factual information and without the anti-Christian propaganda.  Of course, one must read extensively to gain a reasonable understanding of history, and Piers Paul Read has written a good history of the Templars which helps to explain much about the Crusades.

The most interesting aspect of the ""Crescent & the Cross"" video is its use of modern media propaganda.  It has fairly authentic costumes and sets for the reenactments, which makes it an attractive spectacle.  It has vignettes of Christian and Muslim chroniclers tell the story.  Each time we see the Christian chronicler he is dirty & disheveled, in a darkened setting and often without anyone around him.  By contrast, the Muslim Chroniclers, sitting in colorful venues, have enthusiastic audiences listening to wonderful tales of Islamic heroism.  Add in the 'learned Muslim historians' making subtle references to Western Armies in the Middle East after the 9-11 attack on the World Trade Center, and we get the complete picture:  Evil Christians go around the world raping, pillaging and burning for no reason other than to take advantage of peaceful indigenous populations, so it's no wonder that Jihadists want to fly airliners into the World Trade Center.",1261526400,224,2125,5.178362573099415

2409903,4,B000BB1520,"Although George W. Bush may have viewed (and publicly referred to) his ""War on Terror"" as a crusade, historians (and most of us with at least a middle-school education) know that the word - not to mention the actual events - is much too powerful to simply throw around as a scare tactic. Thankfully the History Channel understands this concept as well; The Crusades: Crescent & The Cross presents the story of these wars, which included some of the most bloody and religiously charged battles of history.

Although the story is set in the past, the similarities to current conflicts are clear. For while the techniques and technologies have certainly changed, unfortunately the underlying fears and philosophies have not. The Crusades explores the conflicts between two Middle Age superpowers - Christians and Muslims - fought over a period of two-centuries. The aftermath of the conflict decided the fate of the Holy Land - at least for a while - but left in its path the continuing struggles and conflict we have today.

Unlike some documentaries that are often full of bad re-enactments and laden with tedious interviews with historians and academics, the History Channel's presentation is alive with excellent cinematography and high quality production value. The modern-day historians who are included provide excellent and engaging insight into the battles and beliefs of the Crusades, and the ancient locations where it all took place. The re-enactments are impressive, the acting solid, and the use of CGI excellent. This is an engaging, enlightening and entertaining documentary that can be appreciated by young and old alike.

In particular, the muslim scholar (I forgot his name) was a narrow-minded, intolerant, and prejudiced individual. I especially detested the callous disregard of the meaningful contributions that the Catholic Church made to protect innocent Christians from persecution. Many of these persecuted Christians had roots that went back hundreds of years in areas that were ""Islamitized."" Moreover, the Catholic Church, protected Christian pilgrims: an honest, God-fearing people.

First; this is a 2 DVD set, and it only covers 3 of the 9 crusades- at which point is simply ends.  For my tastes, it has too much British cheekiness, and is a little too much like a made-for-TV docudrama.
Everything relating to the Crusades is on the first DVD. The 2nd DVD has a whimsical 'Making of' feature;  and a feature on the Knights Templar. The Knights Templar documentary is pretty decent about 30-40% of the time; but the rest of the time it's like some cheezy Bermuda-Triangle type of presentation.
This product is not a serious history documentary at all; and all this junk could have easily been condensed onto just one single DVD.
-
At the same time that I ordered this product, I also ordered the History Channel DVD on the Dark Ages.  I liked that one, learned a lot from it, and it seemed like decent historical treatment. The Dark Ages DVD also has a really good feature on the Plague.

2409910,4,B000BB1520,"From a military history standpoint this is an excellent introduction to ""The Crusades"".  As a Religious history ""no one"" Jewish, Muslim or Christian is going to agree, there is just to much tradition, interpretation and dogma over the centuries separating all. Frankly all religions contrary to popular beliefs have blood on there hands.

The other issue, is most modern viewers or readers are not going to understand the true nature of civilizations (East or West) in this remote time period. All military actions in this time frame were bloody slaughters with Armies laying waste and consuming any and all resources in their path. Even the basic conventions of warfare had been forgotten or had not developed as to the treatment civilians and POWs. My point is as we view or read a history we must keep the people in the time frame they existed to correctly judge their actions. Only having done this, can we judge the age in terms of our own.

As I said I consider this only a introduction to the subject of the Crusades.  No one television documentary can do anything more than an incomplete survey. This presentation while much better than most is no exception. I personally would prefer to see more of a presentation of Strategic cause and effect, order of battle and tactical maneuver. What we get instead colored is Political intrigue and romance. Which I admit is interesting.

2409913,4,B000BB1520,"The Crusades is an excellent depiction of the first three crusades.  The eleventh and twelfth centuries were extremely brutal periods where brutality often overcame rationalism and reason.  The religious fervor which Christian and Muslim alike displayed towards one another is astounding at times, but one side, the Muslims, seem to have held onto the sense of history that Christians have forgotten.  The fact that nearly a thousand years after the events began Muslims still talk about crusaders and their wars is testimony that history is alive and well in certain cultures, but nearly dead in others.

That this series only investigates the first three Crusades makes sense when one realizes the other Crusades either failed to get momentum at all, or fizzled before any strategic objectives were realized.  This series shows brutality on both sides (Christains are said to have killed nearly everyone, Muslim, Jew and Christian) when the entered Jerusalem at the end of the First Crusade.  Christains allegedly ate the victims of one Turkish fortress as a way of intimidation.  Muslims brutally killed captured Crusaders when they gained momentum after the Battle of Hattin.  In war no side is really ""innocent"" but one side wins a battle then claims the right to write the history putting its forces in the better light.

This is a two disc set, but the real story is contained on disc one.  Disc two is the obligatory ""how the film was made"" and the necessary interviews of people involved.

Very little is said or shown about how the Islamic empire forcibly conquered the holy land, yet the Christian attempt to re-take it is shown to be ""barbaric"" and filled with ""war-crimes.""

The Muslims were always shown in beautiful flowing and colorful garments, in bright beautiful palaces.  The implications were so obvious and dissapointing.  The Christian attacks were ""unprovoked and viscious"" while the Muslim attacks were defensive.

Re-writing history to appease today's audiance is a terrible injustice.  This documentary was such a disappointment because I do enjoy the History Channel.

Here the scars of battle fought between three of the world's great religions are etched into the earth.  But, the deepest wound was made by a war between Christian and Muslim began at the close of the eleventh century and fought for 200 years.

Now this Holy War has passed into legend, but there were those who saw it with their own eyes; great chroniclers from two different worlds, Christian and Muslim, who wrote of great deeds, great battles, great warriors and men who would lay down their lives for their God.

This was the collision of two great faiths, the clash between the Crescent and the Cross. This was the Crusades.

""The Crusades: Crescent & The Cross"" is a 2-DVD set.  The first disc discusses the First Crusade, beginning with the call of Pope Urban II.  The second half of the first disc discusses the Second and Third Crusades.  As is expected with productions made by the History Channel the story is focused on providing accurate history, yet told in an entertaining manner.

The first disc of the set has a running time of about 180 minutes.

The second disc in ""The Crusades: Crescent & The Cross"" consists of ""History in the Making: The Crusades"" which shows how the History Channel went about making the first disc of the set.  It shows how the reenactments were stages, and the locations and computer animations used in the production.

Also on the second disc of the set is ""The Knights Templar"" providing a brief look at the origins and mysteries of the Crusade's mightiest warriors.

When considering the Knights Templar it has long been established that Templars led diplomatic missions to the courts of Arab princes and learned the Arabic language.  They may have also had dealings with a fanatical drug taking sect known as Hashashiyyin, whose name passed into English as assassins.  The Templars certainly had extensive connections with Islamic and Judaic cultures, and may have absorbed a great deal of their cultures.

It is rumored that the Templar's Muslim and Jewish friends were teaching them the ancient wisdom of the East; secret arts such as alchemy, astrology, and numerology, and some believe they delved even deeper into forbidden rites and knowledge.

What this forbidden knowledge is and how it was used by the Templars is introduced in the second disc of The Crusades Crescent and The Cross.

It doesn't bore the viewer with complex political going on's during the Crusade. Likewise the DVD is filled with live action sequences that presents the many battles in the eyes of those who witnessed it. The actors themselves were superb and held my interest to the very last. The only thing that sucks about live action fighting is the fact that you can tell that they aren't trying to hit each other.

But while this hollywoodization of the crusades may serve the purpose of catching the attention of an ADHD america, it also ends up being its downfall. The DVD is a cliff notes version of the crusades For starters, the DVD isn't necessary a complete account of the crusades. Instead the producers skip to the juicy parts of the crusades and miss some other facts about the crusade. For example...why doesn't this DVD mention anything about the children's crusade? (which really wasn't a crusade of children). Or why don't they mention anything about Richard the Lionheart's conquest of European kingdoms (Sicily and Crete) on his way to the holy land? I mean wouldn't that only diminish their claim that all of Europe was somehow united by Pope Urban's racist crusade?

what about Constantinople? A fallen Christian city that isn't mentioned a lot in this dvd. The DVD is obviously Israel centric, never do they mention the Muslim conquest of European lands. I would of liked to see that since that also seemed to be a crusade. In fact the DVD abruptly ends after the Richard the Lionhearts crusade and then fills in the gaps by suggesting that the wars in the past are effecting today's world. Not really, capitalism and internationalism is more of a reason for the explosion of modern terrorism then the crusade. The DVD only briefly hints at their role in today's society but never shows us the aftermath or other wars that involved the west vs. east. Were lead to believe that Christians were somehow the warmongers.

Also did the producers actually knew they were making a DVD or did they just record over the show? Cause every now and then the screen fades out and then goes back with the words ""THE CRUSADES CRESENT AND THE CROSS"" at the bottom of the screen. Thanks for reminding of what im watching Historychannel. I totally forget that i put that DVD in there and pressed play!

The main point of the movie is that in the first Crusade the Christians ""took back"" Jerusalem from the Muslims. In the second Crusade, the muslims ""took back"" Jerusalem from the Christians. In the third Crusade the Christians tried unsuccessfully to retake Jerusalem back.

This documetary left out one key point: Jerusalem belonged to NEITHER the Christians NOR the Muslims. The city of Jerusalem was originally inhabited by the Jews, but that fact seems to have gotten lost somewhere.

Both Saladin and Richard I commited vicous crimes and they both murdered thousands of people. People seem to forget that Saladin probably murdered as many Knights Templar and Hospitalars as Richard did Muslims. They wer both cunning, vicious and excellent military Strategists. The documentary also states something that was probably true: After Years of Fighting each other they learned to respect each other as generals.

This movie tried to be as objective as possible but there was a lot of Christian-bashing here, not that it wasn't deserved. Tariq whatever his name was seemed to be on a Crusade to make the Christians look as evil as possible. He defends Saladin's actions, when the fact is that both generals committed many what we call today ""war crimes"". After saying all this, I still say it was very educational and enjoyable.

great but it fell extremely short.",1159747200,40,767,4.7164179104477615
2409927,5,B000BB1520,"I very much liked this program.  I liked the way it told the truth as to how Richard, the Lionheart, really was.  He was called ''Lionheart'' after he beheaded 3,000 of Saladin's soldiers at Jaffa----------a cruel lion type heart.  Saladin was a great person-----something I had to learn on my own and not what I learned in Sunday School.",1153872000,9,338,4.694915254237288
2409928,4,B000BB1520,"This documentary film is highly recommended for everybody.  The movie showed clearly balanced opinions in the discussion of crusaders' campaigns.  I found the details of the first campaign were comprehensive and informative.  On the focus of the struggle of the Muslims to liberate Jerusalem, the movie provided also deep analysis details about the conditions of the Islamic world in the Middle East in acceptable details.  Above all, the Bonus Documentary ""The Knights Templar"" was a nice surprise and made the story of the crusades completed.  Highly recommended for everybody!",1148256000,7,579,5.46067415730337
2409929,4,B000BB1520,"I found this to be a very interesting and informative documentary.  Its focus is on the first three crusades.  It speaks of the successful taking back of Jerusalem during the First Crusade lead by Geofrey and his brother Baldwin.  Then, through the inexperience of tactical & battle leadership, the Second Crusade, lead by King Louis VII of France, ended in disaster and failure.  The Third Crusade which originally was lead by King Barbarossa of Germany, but was taken up by King Richard the Lion Heart after Barbarossa's death, managed to reach the city of Jerusalem.  However, the battle harden crusaders did not take it.  This documentary presented to me a renewed interest in the Crusades.  So much so that I began to research for more indepth information.

If you have an interest in the crusades and want key information concerning its successes and failures, then I recommend The Crusades: Crescent & The Cross.",1142035200,14,919,4.96078431372549
