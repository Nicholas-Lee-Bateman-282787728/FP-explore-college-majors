My wife and I attended a New Years Eve Dance two years ago and after watching some dancers, we were inspired to learn how to dance.  After trying an expensive dance instructor who limited each dance session to one or two moves, we gave up and decided to look at dance DVDs on Amazon.com. After trying numerous DVD instructors, we discovered Shawn Trautman's DVDs had the best instructions and was the easiest to follow.  West Coast Swing is a very difficult dance, but Shawn Trautman made it so easy that in very short time, we graduated from beginners to the intermediate dancers.  Shawn and his wife, Joanna, are so thorough when giving the best complete explanation of each move. He also allows you to learn and practice each step before moving to the next step, You don't have to continually rewind and play over and over like so many other DVD instructors.  Shawn and his wife explain and show in detail how each dance partner is to perform each step.  Now, we are continually asked in various dance halls where did we learn how to dance?  We wasted money buying many different DVD's by other instructors, which were very difficult to follow. We are now are concentrating on learning other dance DVDs by Shawn Trautman.  He makes dancing so easy and it has become our favorite pastime.  We feel so grateful that we bought Shawn DVDs and have lots of fun.  Shawn Trautman videos prove to us that he is ""The very best West Coast Instructor"".",1252540800,3,1462,4.61003861003861

I have been hungry to become an accomplished dancer and I have always been disappointed with the Instructional DVD's and VHS tapes. They were either poor quality, confusing, poorly conceived or all of the above. I recently purchased several of the Shawn Trautman Dance Videos. Shawn Trautman's dance video is professional, easy to understand, and breaks down the movement so even a novice can learn to dance. I recommend this series to anyone who wants to learn to dance and wants clear and professional instruction from a DVD.

8152958,4,B000JSE022,These two explain all of the moves in a very simple and easy to understand way. They also demonstrate how to do the moves enough times that I could follow along very easily. Only down side is that there aren't that many moves to each video. It is nice that the coding for the discs is such that they will play on any major dvd software. I'm looking forward to the next one.,1179705600,8,373,4.123287671232877
