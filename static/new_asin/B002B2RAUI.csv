3892769,5,B002B2RAUI,"I take a Nia class.  This is a perfect supplement on two fronts: 1) getting more proficient at the particular routine, 2) and to getting in another good workout, even when not in class.",1265673600,,185,4.4411764705882355
3892770,5,B002B2RAUI,Nia is a wonderful low impact way to get exercise. I was not able to attend the one Nia class at my fitness center for January-March due to another commitment. I bought the Opal DVD so I could continue my Nia sessions at home. The steps are easy to follow and I feel like I've had a real workout when I am finished with the DVD. I would recommend Nia and this DVD to men and women who are looking for a way to add cardio to their fitness routine.,1265500800,11,446,3.966666666666667
3892771,5,B002B2RAUI,"I love 'Nia'!
I was introduced to Nia some time ago on a fluke
I was taking a jazz class to get back into exercising but found the class to be too advanced for this 3o something at the time
My back as gotten less flexible thru the years so I was experiencing chronic pain and tightness
there was a flyer for Nia classes on the desk in the studio
I took one and went on line and read up on Nia
I bought the global unity dvd and started using it at home
I loved it!
My back loved it,more importantly!
after awhile I wanted more Nia
so I went back on line to there website and found two other dvd's opal being one of them
this is my all time fav!
I just speaks volumes to my spirit\heart
Every time I exercise to  it I spiritually fly

I loooove you 'Nia'
produce more dvd's for us home users!",1253577600,16,790,3.93125
3892772,5,B002B2RAUI,"I've had this dvd for 5 years and every time I used it I loved it.  The music is good.  The class energy is wonderful and the steps are easy to pick up.  The thing about NIA is that you are encouraged to move in your own body's way.  Just get the basic moves and then dance your heart out.  Now, I will say that I wish the dvd had a music only feature.  Instead one has to buy the cd and dvd and then put the dvd on mute to hear music only cd.  Not really using the best that dvd technology has to offer.

All in all a great class if you can't do it live. Oh any by the way.  I believe that the dvd includes a learn the moves section. But why bother with that.  Just let go and dance!!",1366416000,3,685,3.6944444444444446
3892773,1,B002B2RAUI,"Opal Whiteley was a genius, a story teller, a visionary, and tragically misunderstood.  I bought this film, hopeful to see descriptions of Opal's love of Nature and her delightful relationship with animals. Instead the focus is on the already resolved question of her diary's authenticity. It was poorly acted, with a stiff, simple script.
I hope there will be another attempt to portray Opal's complex, imaginative childhood and her adult struggle with the turmoil of not being supported, believed and listened to. She knew from age 7 that she was here to teach children (and grownups who hadn't forgotten) how to experience God in natural creation. She might have become a cultural hero with the depth of insight and story like Mark Twain, and instead was reduced to poverty, malnutrition, and mental illness. Genius, mysticism and schizophrenia are an uncomfortable mix. Yet those who have proper support and nurture can become our greatest artists.
Consider reading Benjamin Hoff's The Singing Creek Where the Willows Grow. And if you ever drive near Cottage Grove, OR, stop in at the local library and see Opal's other amazing Nature book.
She has changed my view of my own environment, and my life is richer because of my being able to hear the intelligence within the songs of wildlife and rivers.
And perhaps we would be wise to let our children romp the forests and streams, climb unsafely into trees, and spend hours in unmanaged activities. Let's watch each one become their own sorts of genius by letting them follow what attracts and delights them.
I do wish this movie could have held some of the magic of a glorious little teacher and story crafter that was Opal Whiteley.",1358726400,15,1687,4.919298245614035
3892774,3,B002B2RAUI,If you know this routine already it may serve as a good reminder.  I did not know it and could not figure out what they were doing with footwork until I had a class that used this routine.,1355788800,4,188,3.9473684210526314
3892775,5,B002B2RAUI,"Great exercise video, low impact, easy to follow, good for seniors and people with disability, will use often to work out when cannot go to gym",1354233600,3,143,4.538461538461538
3892776,4,B002B2RAUI,"Dina Ciraulo's historical biopic ""Opal"" (2010) etches a candid portrait of Opal Whiteley's life, the famous American naturalist whose childhood diary created a great deal of controversy over the 20th century. Working within an independent production framework, Ciraulo manages to create a consistent period piece atmosphere, portraying Whiteley as a remarkable woman scientist of the 20th century. Sustained by a feel of mystery, the plot draws the audience to follow the key to the puzzles behind Whiteley's famous writings. Yet, the most notable feature of this work is the praise of Whiteley's unspeakable love for nature, by isolating this enigmatic character in visually-striking shots, with poetic composition and charming visual effects.
Very inspiring work for women filmmakers across the world. Absolutely recommend watching it.",1331424000,11,837,5.758064516129032
3892777,3,B002B2RAUI,"Sound editing is not high quality and instructor needs to be a lot more reliant on telling the class (and viewers) what to do. Many times you are having to look at the screen in order to see what you are supposed to be doing. Nia is really meant to be done in a class and not at home. But since my schedule is crazy busy, I have to settle for this.",1330992000,3,348,3.8472222222222223
3892778,1,B002B2RAUI,"Though the Nia routine is good, the dvd makes it very hard to follow and not very pleasant to watch. This is a ""class"" and the students movements obscure the instructors movement so that there's really little focus on the instructor. In other words there's so much movement onscreen, it's disorienting to watch. The instructor wears big bell bottoms and it disorts the body's natural lines.  The studio it's shot in is drab, and the whole visual experience is sub-par. The music adds nothing and is ordinary. Too bad, if you can follow it anyway, the workout is good.",1313798400,23,567,4.7272727272727275
3892779,5,B002B2RAUI,"This routine is one of the very best.  It's fun, easy to follow, and works up a tremendous sweat!  Definitely a favorite of mine.",1286064000,10,129,4.333333333333333
3892780,5,B002B2RAUI,"My friend and I (we are both 50-somethings) are taking a weekly NIA class and we decided to buy OPAL so we can do NIA more than once a week. Whether with the class or dvd, NIA makes my body hum and lifts my spirits! No wonder we can't seem to get enough of it! We strongly recommend NIA!",1271030400,5,287,3.8813559322033897
3892781,5,B002B2RAUI,"Nia for chronic pain, March 7, 2010

The joy of Nia is its flexibility. I have fibromyalgia, RA and asthma. Nia is something I can do because it is flexible.....it encourages you to do things at your own pace. You do not need to try to 'keep up with everyone else"". I took just one Nia class while visiting my sister and knew this would be good for me. I live in an area where there are no Nia classes. I have ordered some of the DVD's on line. Just try Nia! You will probably decide that this is the low impact, great range of motion exercise that your body needs.",1267920000,10,565,4.09009009009009

8360617,5,B002B2RAUI,"I like a live clsss better, but this is good if you don't have access to a live class close by. If you get bored with their music, just mute it, put on your own playlist and go for it.",1494288000,,184,3.625

I say. get it. love it and move happy.  Great sounds, different beast. The best.  I may get another but of now, I love this Opal",1433721600,,286,3.896551724137931
8360621,5,B002B2RAUI,"I love this workout!  I am 67 and have had both knees replaced and found this to be motivating for me.  I can't do all the moves that involve getting on my knees, but I am still getting a great work out!",1430956800,,203,3.8095238095238093
8360622,2,B002B2RAUI,"This is an attempt to dramatize the life of Opal Whiteley, a somewhat mysterious and controversial figure in Oregon history. A gifted child who wrote a remarkable diary that gives us a view of the world thru the eyes of a child. Opal is a complex character and often she does not always fit our preconceptions. This film tries to show some of the many sides of Opal, but fails to include the brilliant and charismatic personality that brought her to people's notice. The Opal in this story though she is beautiful and earnest, could never have been the child called the ""sunshine fairy"". They do a good job of introducing the breadth of Opal's experiences, but they fail to capture the essence of her soul. In the end this film falls short of its goals and is disappointing.",1429228800,,774,4.575539568345324
8360623,5,B002B2RAUI,"Another great Nia workout with great music! I'm always glad I did the workout and always surprised at how fast it goes! It looks like Nia may be retiring some of their DVDs. At least, I haven't gotten an answer from their office to the contrary.  I'm looking for these DVDs: Cadence, Aya & Humanity. If you're interested in selling one or all, please contact me at catzenjammers at hotmail dot com.",1424649600,,398,4.527777777777778
8360624,5,B002B2RAUI,"I will be using this Nia workout for the cold winter months when I can't get outside to walk. Love the moves, albeit, I will modify some of them for my body.  I'm through with high impact stuff, but I want to keep my body healthy and flexible too.  Give it a try, see how you feel after a workout.",1420934400,,297,3.933333333333333
8360625,1,B002B2RAUI,"This movie missed the essence of Opal. So very sad that the producers of this movie didn't even have a clue to the remarkable person Opal was. It does her memory a disservice! I wrote a book about my experience with Opal titled, Child of My Heart. Read it if you want to know the real Opal.",1403308800,,290,4.105263157894737
