4836719,4,B005MT3830,"just going through the series now.  The collection beats buying all individual seasons.  Some discs need numerous rebooting of the player in order to play the discs.  Only major problem for me was buying the blu-ray series but later finding out its not all in blu-ray (checked season 1,2,8 so far).  An extra $30 i didn't have to pay.  I would suggest buying the complete series in DVD instead.",1354838400,,394,4.6521739130434785
4836720,5,B005MT3830,"I don't know what it is about HBO, but they just know how to make the best shows. Entourage was one of the few shows that I watched religously when it was on the air and when it ended I was so sad to see it go. As someone who will probably never get to Hollywood it was grea to see a show that was about 4 guys from my hometown making it big and yet amonst all the glitz and glamour managed to stay tough, brash and of course together as friends.

Many people did give this show a little flack after season 3 because was apparently not as great as the first 3 seasons. While I will admit that season 4 was a little as a whole the story was rich in detail and character development and it all fit in the end. Of course the characters are some of the best ever put onto television and it is so hard to single one out as the best because they are all such great characters. Of course having a bunch of famous faces show up and just act as normal people is great too. It is a story about a life most of us wish we had and yet when I wathced the show, I felt like I have a good life and felt at ease as I watched.

This is just an entertaining and fun show. It has moments that will make you laugh, tense up and even be left dumbfounded based on what you see. It will only make you crave more with each episode.",1345593600,27,1306,3.8513011152416357
4836721,5,B005MT3830,"lets face it, this was a guy show. i know few girls watch and adored it as i did, but as a whole - it's for the men. I always described it as ""SEX IN THE CITY"" for men. To keep a long story short; this series is awesome! the last two season were cut way to short and deserve more respect than they had gotten at the end. The last episode was also awesome, well the last 2 minutes or so hahaha. i hope a movie is made and we find out what happened to ari!!!!! side note---i wouldnt watch this show if it wasn't for Ari Gold! he is one of the best television characters to have ever been created! if you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and check it out",1345248000,2,655,3.859259259259259
4836722,3,B005MT3830,"This review is meant to cover all eight seasons. Spoilers ahead. ""Entourage'' was a guilty pleasure, depicting a fantasyland where all the girls were beautiful (and available), all the cars cool, all the restaurants fabulous and money was never (or rarely) a problem.

Ari, Drama and Lloyd are great characters. But some of the best performances come from outside the full-time cast: Seth Green's hilariously hate-able take on himself; Adam Goldberg's intense, self-destructive Nick Rubenstein; Rhys Coiro's volatile Billy Walsh; Bob Saget going against type to portray himself as a sex-crazed vulgarian.

But ""Entourage'' clearly suffers from a hole at its heart. Adrian Grenier is likable enough as Vincent Chase. But he simply isn't convincing as a movie star. The front man for a boy band or pop group? Sure. A celebrity male model? Maybe. But movie stars need to have an edge, a gravitas, that Grenier simply lacks. (That said, I thought he was noticeably stronger in the final season.)

The writing is uneven. The finale of Season 5 -- in which huge problems are introduced and resolved by the closing credits -- is an abomination. Vince's descent into madness in Season 7 seems to come out of nowhere; he'd previously taken his Hollywood adventure in stride.

""Entourage"" also has a woman problem. Ari's sexist rants and the boys' view of women as disposable sex objects wear thin. (True, there are some strong and sympathetic women characters: I was particularly fond of Constance Zimmer's Dana Gordon. And I certainly wasn't immune to the physical charms of the women of ""Entourage"" -- particularly Lizzie Grant; Billy Walsh's Season 4 girlfriend, Catherine; Phil Yagoda's secretary, whom moviegoers might remember as Miss California in ""Little Miss Sunshine.'')

The writers couldn't seem to decide if porn star Sasha Grey was a surprisingly grounded career woman or a nasty femme fatale who led Vince astray. Recall that in the series' last few episodes, when Ari and E are estranged from the women they love, both men enjoy more-or-less casual flings. But Mrs. Ari and Sloan, the writers make clear, are too deeply devoted to their men to sleep with anyone else -- an old-fashioned double standard in a series that otherwise revels in casual sex.

In short, ""Entourage'' adds up to a lot of eye candy and a few laughs. But it's probably best not to think too deeply about it.",1343865600,6,2387,5.0

4836729,5,B005MT3830,This is entertainment. We can sit through several episodes and lose track of time. We didn't see this show when it was still on tv; it would have been too hard to see it that way. It was hard enough to stop the show as it was.,1480982400,,226,3.8297872340425534

This disc set has had about 7 episodes that have completely frozen up. The complete second disc of season three skipped so we couldn't get more than 5 seconds of continuous play. Mind you i purchased this as ""new"". We've played them on two sepeperate DVD systems also in hopes it was the systems error and not the brand new set with the wrapping still on?

4836806,5,B005MT3830,"Brilliant series, smart packaging, and the blu-ray picture and sound are both stunning.

Having now re-watched the entire series, it's a little hard to believe that this show, which gives a big finger to political correctness and people who have made a cottage industry out of being offended, could have ever been produced let alone shown on a lib/prog/lefty network like HBO in the 21st century.

Some of the seasons have a better flow than others, which is to be expected in a show that ran 8 seasons, but every one of them is great entertainment for those who aren't ""offended"" by the things young men do, particularly if they're 4 young men from Queens who find themselves suddenly living the fast lifestyle of the Hollywood elite.

This is a fantastic box set.  Most of the reviewers giving this set 1 and 2 star reviews complained about problems with the discs not playing.  I will tell you that some of the discs in the box set I received were also quirky.  Several times I had to reboot the player as many as 4 times to get a particular disc to play, but was eventually able to get them all to play.  I've never had this problem with any other blu-ray discs, so I don't think it was my player, so be prepared for some possible annoyances.",1435017600,2,1246,4.486725663716814

It is so well written and keeps you wanting to watch more and more. As for the product that I received, well I've had to return it twice. The DVDs look completely brand new but they play like they have been used or scratched internally. The complete first season played fine but once we got into watching season 2, the discs would start to skip, pause, and the dvd player kept trying to read the disc. So before I sent it back the first time, I played it in every single  dvd player in the house including our Xbox 360. The skipping and pausing continued & I also played some of my own dvds to be sure that it wasn't the device they were played on. And as I suspected my dvds played fine, so I know that it wasn't the device they were played on. I received the 2nd order and was able to finish the 2nd season but once we got into the 3rd season, once again the disc started doing the exact same thing as the first order. We really want to keep the box set so I'm giving it another shot and having this second order replaced again. I'm hoping that THIRD TIMES A CHARM.

I checked to make sure it wasn't my player, but it did it in the exact same spots on various players. I tried cleaning to no avail. I returned it for a replacement (very easy and fast), but the second set did the exact same thing, except in different spots.  Some of the discs were fine, others had little issues, but one had a big chunk of an episode that is unwatchable.  Very frustrating that this has happened twice.

This tale of friendship and fun is very enjoyable and it's great that it's finally been collected into one set and on high definition.  What's even better is that this Blu-ray set offers great audio and visual quality and a good selection of extras as well.  I would have liked even more extras for a massive set like this, but I'm still pretty happy with what I got.  If you enjoyed the show, then I highly recommend you get this set and watch the complete journey with these characters to see their stories from the beginning to the end.

So what can you expect when it comes to the Extras. See below!

Extras

Audio Commentaries - There's twenty-one audio commentaries included (basically about three per season) with a rotating cast  of speakers that include show creator Doug Ellin, Executive Producer Larry Charles, Mark Wahlberg, Adrian Grenier, Kevin Connolly, Kevin Dillon, Jerry Ferrara and Jeremy Piven just to name some of them.  They share stories and talk about their characters, the inspiration for the show, and make each other laugh.

Behind the Scenes of Entourage - A ten minute talk with Mark Wahlberg and the main cast talking about the characters and the show.

The Mark Wahlberg Sessions - Another extra that features Wahlberg but this one is a little more in depth as it runs over twenty minutes long.  Wahlberg talks about the inspiration for the show being his real life friends and how their history turned into the show.  We even see some of his real life friends make an appearance.

Vegas Baby, Vegas!- A short look behind the scenes of the cast filming an episode in Las Vegas.

Museum of Television & Radio - At almost an hour long, this extra is the longest and most in depth look into the show with the show's PaleyFest panel going into the details of the show and the characters.  Show creator Doug Ellin, the main cast, and Co-Executive Producer Julian Farino appear on the panel.  This is my favorite extra in this set and I wish more shows that have done one of these PaleyFest panels would include it as an extra too.

Anatomy of Entourage - A brief behind the scenes look at the season three finale.

US Comedy Arts Festival Panel - Another great panel that runs almost an hour, but this time features Doug Ellin, Adrian Grenier, Kevin Connolly, and Jeremy Piven as they discuss the first four seasons of the show.

The Making of Medellin - A brief look at the making of the season four premiere's fake film.

Medellin Trailer - The fake trailer for the fake film Medellin that Vince starred in for the fourth season.

Meet the Newest Member of Entourage - A two minute look at Doug Ellin's progeny Lucas Ellin.

The Celebrity Factor - A list of all of the celebrity cameos that occurred during season five.

Life on Top - A fifteen minute featurette devoted to show how the characters evolved from season to season.

A Day at the Speedway - A very short look at the making of the episode ""One Car, Two Car, Red Car, Blue Car"".

ONEXONE PSA - This is a very funny fake public service announcement with Vince and Ari in character making a PSA with guest star Matt Damon there to direct it.  It's pretty funny!

Inside the Hollywood Highlife - A look at the seventh season of the show and where the characters are in their lives at that point.

The Shades of Sasha Grey - A six minute talk with adult film star Sasha Grey who made a couple of guest appearances on the show.  She candidly talks about working in the porn industry.

Hollywood Sunset: A Farewell to Entourage - This extra is a thirty minute retrospective that includes series creator Doug Ellin, writer/executive producer Ally Musika, and actors Adrian Grenier, Kevin Connolly, Kevin Dillon and Jerry Ferrara.  They talk about the rough start the show had and how it evolved.  Jeremy Piven and Rex Lee also join in and offer their perspectives on the show and their characters.  We also get to see some of the cast's auditions and behind the scenes footage.  All of this is entertaining but I wish it had been longer especially since this is the only extra from the final season.",1377129600,19,4212,4.570666666666667
4836890,5,B005MT3830,I didn't get the pleasure of watching this on HBO when it was on there. My brother said i have to watch this so i decided to purchase this and let me tell you it is one of the best shows ive ever seen. Word has it there is a movie coming out soon as well cant wait for that. Anyway this is great and Amazon has the lowest price on this i could find and with free shipping with prime cant beat it.

4836893,1,B005MT3830,"I have tried four times this month (April 2013) to buy the box set of ""Entourage"" from three different vendors (Amazon, Best Buy, and Barnes & Noble). Each and every set was defective the same way and had to be returned. It wasn't the fault of my player (it's new and plays everything else just fine) and it is not the fault of the sellers, but if you are looking to buy this set, I'd say wait a while till this load gets removed and new ones replace them.

I gave this one star because not rating it doesn't let this get posted, but the show is great and Amazon does it's best.",1367107200,9,578,4.115044247787611

The only problem is, all the discs have a defect to where they don't allow the device to read certain parts of the discs (won't play certain parts).  The strange thing is, all of the discs are like that. I did have a new one sent which is great.  Hopefully those aren't defective as well.",1364774400,7,335,4.301587301587301

4836897,5,B005MT3830,"I am a big fan of entourage, used to own most of the seasons until my boyfriend and I broke up and I gave him custody of the sets.  When the complete series box set came out I purchased one for myself.  It's compact, takes up less space and comes in a pretty cool box too.  I think this would make a great gift set for any Entourage fans, I would have loved it if someone bought it for me as a gift :D",1361232000,2,401,3.75

4836899,2,B005MT3830,"I was an avid fan of the show while on the air and in syndication. As such, I was tremendously excited to purchase the complete series as this would allow me to enjoy all my favorite episodes at my leisure.

I was not able to enjoy my favorite episodes at my leisure for the following reasons:

1) the quality of the DVDs is horrible! The background noise and ambient sounds in almost all the scenes drown the main characters' dialogues.  You can't follow the story if you can't hear the characters speak!!

2) the story telling was full of mistakes when you are able to watch episodes back to back.  This was a big distraction from truly being able to enjoy each season in its entirety.

If you need your fix of Vinny and the boys, I would watch the show on syndication to have a more pleasurable experience than purchasing this box set.",1359590400,,838,4.409090909090909

However, I had an issue with this particular box set.  Every single disk had a scratch on it so I wasn't able to watch every episode in its entirety.  I would have to fast forward parts of an episode to get the disk to keep playing.  As you could imagine I was very frustrated and reluctant to recommend buying it from Amazon.

Like right now seasons 2, 4 & 6 don't wanna work for some reason. My DVDs are spotless & it's definitely not my blu ray player. When they do decide to work again, some of the episodes get really messed up. It's starts getting choppy, making ugly noises & forces me to skip ahead.
