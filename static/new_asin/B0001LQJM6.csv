2013576,5,B0001LQJM6,"This is an excellent coming of age movie.  Themes include forgiveness, trust, true love, promise keeping, uselessness of vanity and good work ethics.  The movie will be enjoyed by the entire family (6 or so and up).  We have recommended this movie to several friends.",1141862400,3,267,4.888888888888889
2013577,5,B0001LQJM6,This is a great family movie. It's a refreshing change from the overly sophisticated material we usually see being peddled to our children.,1141603200,2,139,5.086956521739131
2013578,5,B0001LQJM6,"No, you will not find any of the horror, violence or sex that is so prevalent in our movies this day and age.  What you will find is a heartwarming story about love, value and morals.  A story that teaches the lesson that everyone has worth and that everyone deserves someone to believe in them.

The scenery was a wonderful bonus, shot in beautiful New Zealand.

My husband picked up this movie because we had rented Spaceballs and it was not clean enough for my 6 year old daughter to watch.  I was skeptical at first since I had never heard of it but it turned out to be one of the better movies I have seen in a long time.  My daughter sat and quietly watched the whole movie.  Not many times does she do that.

If you are truly looking for a good, clean family movie that will leave you with an uplifted spirit and smile in your heart then I would recommend giving this movie a shot.",1123286400,8,888,4.182352941176471
2013579,5,B0001LQJM6,"Magnificent movie that teaches love, respect, not to be judgemental, tollerance, and humility, and the vale of true friendship.  Inforces committment & promises.

I believe that this is not only just a good movie, but a family treasure.  We plan on sending coppies to all of our chrildre.",1099872000,5,288,4.958333333333333
2013580,4,B0001LQJM6,"I was raised on the 1969 short film ""Johnny Lingo"" produced at BYU.
I enjoyed this retelling with one exception.  The Tahitian Noni company (one of the sponsors) shamelessly plugged the noni fruit and its juice.  I admit that noni, despite their taste, have wonderful healing powers, but this propoganda belongs in a commercial, not a movie.
The most shameless example of self-promotion was when Tama was threatened with death because spilling noni juice displeased the gods.  None of the gold or silver with Johnny would appease the gods' anger over the spilt nectar.
I recognized a lot of the cast from ""The Other Side of Heaven"", and their acting did not disappoint.  The lush valleys of New Zealand were also impressive.
If you are a ""Utah Mormon"" you may want to buy the LdS Collection 2-disc edition from Deseret Book.  This edition includes the BYU classic, the feature film, and some bonus material.  Again, the LdS edition is labeled ""NOT FOR SALE OVER THE INTERNET"", so you have to go to Deseret Book.",1087171200,26,1011,4.781609195402299
2013581,4,B0001LQJM6,"Brought to the screen by some of the people who gave us Schindler's List, Hook, Jurassic Park, and Rain Man, this moral fable is a well executed film that teaches without preaching.
The Legend of Johnny Lingo moves at a leisurely place as an outcast boy finds his place in the world with a little help from some new friends. It starts out somewhat predictable (but what Disney movie isn't?), then we learn what the Legend actually is in a surprise half-way through. And the boy-goes-back-for-the-girl ending is very well done with a little twist of its own to keep it interesting.
Not enough movement to keep smaller kids interested and probably too uncool for older kids, it is a perfect fit for families with children in the 6-14 age group.
The scenery is breathtaking. And the soundtrack, which consists of traditional and contemporary Polynesian themes, is fabulous; the music is well selected.
Family movies run the risk of being pretty low quality knowing that there are so few movies out they'll have some minimum audience no matter what. This is not one of those movies. While shot on an indy budget (I would guess), the production values and editing really bring out the story in an entertaining way. It is charming little movie.",1084924800,24,1238,4.789719626168225
2013582,4,B0001LQJM6,"My husband and I saw this movie in the theatre and really loved it.  In fact, I was hoping to get the DVD for Christmas, but alas, it was not available yet.
I so much enjoyed the beautiful island and ocean scenes and the music.  Also, the story was heartwarming and very enjoyable.
I very much liked this movie and have recommended it to our friends.",1079308800,6,350,4.287878787878788
2013583,3,B0001LQJM6,"The Legen of Johnny Lingo was an imaginative and creative addition to a legendary story.  I thought it was a heart warming fabulous movie.  Keeping in mind that I am a fan of Disney movies, not action or adventure films.",1079049600,3,220,4.475

2013608,2,B0001LQJM6,I was disappointed in the condition of the packaging of the product. The DVD was fine but I thought it was the two DVD product that also showed the original Johnny Lingo also.

2013610,5,B0001LQJM6,The scenic background of this move is breathtaking. I want to travel to the FiGI Islands now. The story line is very entertaining and a little educational.

2013614,5,B0001LQJM6,"I am a Mormon and have seen both versions of the movie, but I must say that I liked this version more.  It has great lessons about honesty, hard work, keeping promises, forgiveness, retribution, and love.  There is so much unbridled joy to be found in this movie.  The characters are believable, never sappy or false.  This is easily among my favorite movies, along with Spider-Man 2, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, and Up.",1370563200,,431,4.706666666666667

I think I like it even better than the original, also I think this one would be better for the younger generation (teens and kids) vs the original.  Much more exciting and fun.",1367452800,,320,4.372881355932203

2013623,4,B0001LQJM6,It was a good movie with a good message. We enjoyed it as a family. It held our attention as well.,1365120000,,98,3.7142857142857144

2013625,5,B0001LQJM6,This version was better than the first.  There were a lot more lessons and a lot more action. There was a longer time frame involved.  It showed him as a baby to a full grown man and actually becoming Johnny Lingo.,1350345600,,214,4.195121951219512
2013626,5,B0001LQJM6,"This movie was an accidental find for our family and I'm so glad we discovered it. It's got action, adventure, and is filled with good life lessons. I've showed it to boys and girls who were equally taken by the movie and asked to watch it again and again. I didn't even mind because it's still entertaining to watch as a parent. Awesome production value and amazing scenery. I can't believe this movie didn't hit mainstream harder but looking at what passes for main stream I'm kind of glad it didn't because they probably would have butchered it.",1350172800,2,548,4.6020408163265305
2013627,5,B0001LQJM6,"My Mom was the first person to suggest that I watch this movie, and at first I was a bit skeptical-especially since the acting at the beginning was pretty flat.  But, as the story progresses the characters become more real, and the tale becomes kind of involving.  Beautiful scenery and a good message about paying for things that you do, commitment and friendship are beautifully interwoven into the story of the life of the boy nobody wanted.  I was actually moved by the ending.  Our family has watched it over and over.",1344988800,,523,4.6521739130434785

2013630,5,B0001LQJM6,"I remember watching this movie in school years ago! One of the things that I remember about this movie is the theme song, it is  beautiful. I also like the love story between  Johnny Lingo and Mahana.",1291161600,,200,4.378378378378378
2013631,3,B0001LQJM6,Saw the original of this and believe this is the better of the two with a more in depth look into the story.  My thanks for all concerned in the project.  Great family viewing.,1287446400,2,176,4.147058823529412
2013632,4,B0001LQJM6,"Although I think the movie is a cheesy old classic, my teen boys just HAD to have it. The DVD was in great (like new) condition and I received it very quickly, which was appreciated.",1278460800,,182,4.228571428571429
2013633,5,B0001LQJM6,I would recommend this movie for any family.  It contains many powerful life lessons we should all pay attention to.,1267315200,,116,4.8
2013634,4,B0001LQJM6,"I strongly recommend this movie for a family night.  The story is a positive, uplifting one that ephasizes loyalty, faithfulness, unconditional love and the estimation of the value of others.  While the story is truly inspiring, the acting is mediocre at best. It soon becomes obvious that the Noni juice industry has funded the film - some parts have the feel of an infomercial.  Fortunately, they are brief and do not detract much from the basic message of the film.  So, if you are a persnickety perfectionist, look elsewhere.  However, if you can live with imperfection to view an enjoyable, endearing tale set in the South Pacific, it's worth purchasing.  Our family found it worthy of more than one viewing.",1257379200,,713,4.9
2013635,5,B0001LQJM6,"I am a serious DVD collector, over 2,000 in my collection right now. I stumbled onto ""The Legend of Johnny Lingo"" after it was recommended by a DVD store manager to me. She said that I, being originally from Hawaii, that I might enjoy it. It was one of the best recommendations that I've received.
I had seen the DVD cover several times before in stores but frankly the cover did not draw me to it. It was a little misleading. After my wife and I enjoyed watching it I must have gotten about 20 extra copies of the movie to send to my brother and sisters and friends.
Later on I did buy a copy of the LDS version which has an extra DVD with features on it which made the movie even more enjoyable. The two-disc LDS version has a much nicer and more appealing cover that would have made me buy the DVD much sooner. The cover, especially, and the back of the DVD case sells the movie to me. I have bought lots of movies by just looking at the cover and the copy on the back - especially if I'm not familiar with the title.
Take a chance on this movie. It was quite refreshing and so colorful with the scenery where it was shot.",1252972800,,1125,4.118181818181818
2013636,5,B0001LQJM6,"Film critic, Pete Croatto, wrote: ""There's no adventure or fun anywhere in Johnny Lingo, which is odd because this is kid friendly fare...There are no truly funny, scary, or heroic characters and no memorable visuals.""  No heroic characters?!!  Crazy talk. Young boy made a promise and kept it years later.  Sounds pretty heroic to me. (This is a fine example of why I do not trust film critics.  Nothing more than one person's opinion rendered through a narrow scope of one's own personal taste.  Better to have a composite view from many different opinions  to weed out the foolishness.)

Not every movie (even ""kid-friendly"") needs CGI gimmicks, sexed up women, idiotic quips, or bogeymen jumping out of bushes to capture interest and hold attention.  With reviewer opinions like Croatto's, it's no wonder studios now make movies devoid of emotional inspiration, have flat characters, and droll storylines.  Movies today are made for drooling buffoons with short attention spans.  If a car doesn't go boom or someone doesn't get shot within the first 15 seconds, the movie is a failure.  So when faced with a movie like Johnny Lingo--one that is based around characters and real emotions not booming parlor tricks--like a monkey with a computer, most don't know what to make of it.  They shake it.  When it doesn't make noise, they lose interest and throw it against the wall then lumber off.

The cover shot and title are misleading in marketing the movie.  The crux of Johnny Lingo is about love and commitment, which may be beyond the depth of most youngster these days.  There's no real ""legend"" to speak of; that is a misnomer.  No swashbuckling journey or legendary adventure. The legend angle was nonexistent and had no meaningful part in story.  If you are expecting to see a movie about a frolicking Polynesian ""Peter Pan"", you'll be disappointed.

The story is the thing in Johnny Lingo. A tale of two outcasts finding life in each other.  Good old-fashioned love story.  No extraneous effects are required to tell it.",1249344000,6,2031,4.9147058823529415
2013637,5,B0001LQJM6,"This is a wonderful family movie.  Full of adventure, humor and fulfilling a promise.",1244592000,,85,5.071428571428571
2013638,5,B0001LQJM6,"The ""Legend of Johnny Lingo"" is actually based on a real south seas legend and was already the topic for another film about this legend some years ago.

This is a more modern interpretation of the legend, and it boasts with a number of famous Pacific Islands & New Zealand Maori actors like Rawiri Paratene (Whale Rider), which are of course mostly unknown to the US and European audience. The film was shot at various locations, mainly in NZ and Rarotonga and Aitutaki (the two latter both belong to the Cook Islands) and the beauty of the locations is breathtaking.

The story is quite simple: orphant boy leaves his home island but vows to return one day to marry the daughter of his foster father, boy meets the famous and benevolent trader Johnny Lingo who later makes the boy to take his name, and finally returns as the (new) Johnny Lingo to get his bride who has been patiently waiting for him all these years. However, this seemingly plain story is witty with some very nice twists and contains  lots of humour. The film music is by the famous group ""Te Vaka"" from Tuvalu and supports and enhances the story, adding to the typical South Seas touch.

As I have lived in the Cooks Islands for some years I have particularly enjoyed recognizing some of the places I know. But even without this personal interest of mine this film is great family entertainment and will be enjoyed both by young and old (5+ years).

The film was sponsored by the Mormons (Latter Day Saints) and a Tahitian company that exports Noni juice. Whilst I could not detect any mormon-specific preaching or message in the film (in fact, there are no biblical or church themes in the film at all), the Noni juice is quite prominently mentioned throughout the film, probably due to this sponsorship.

The one thing worth criticising is the German synchronisation which is substandard at the very best (but this really only affects those who don't want to listen to the English master soundtrack).",1211328000,4,1973,4.687861271676301
2013639,5,B0001LQJM6,"Honestly, if I knew how this story was so strongly embraced or endorsed by the Mormon community I would've steered clear.

But if there was any religious propaganda in this movie, I sure didn't see any.  This was just a great story.  Almost like a fairy tale or fable.

The music of Te Vaka shines in this movie with such great lessons and morals that all young people should watch and learn from.",1210809600,,397,4.397260273972603
