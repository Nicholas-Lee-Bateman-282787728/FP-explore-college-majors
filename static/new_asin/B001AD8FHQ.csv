8277075,2,B001AD8FHQ,"Julien Duvivier is a much respected French director whose later work included this 1962 supernatural whodunnit based on a famous book by John Dickson Carr who collaborated with Duvivier and Charles Spaak on the film's screenplay.  With a very competent cast including Nadja Tiller, Jean-Claude Brialy, Edith Scob, Perrette Pradier and Claude Rich, the film was very competently photographed by Roger Fellous, and edited by Paul Cayatte and Nicoloe Colombier with music by Georges Auric. Some of the images are interesting, but one expects more from so much talent and potential and the result is spottily effective.  While the director's work is currently being considered for Criterion Collection treatment, this Sinister Cinema presentation is a passable offering from them.  Aside from these credits, the film is quite old-fashioned, but still fairly interesting, and may seem more so merely convoluted.  The Sinister Cinema product is dubbed and may require additional viewings as it is rather talky and hard to understand as the voices do not sound like they fit the characters so it becomes rather disorienting watching it and one doesn't get used to it until two-thirds through as the film gains in interest.

8277076,5,B001AD8FHQ,"Again, I read this book as a teenager.  Saw the movie on TV in the 1960's.  I tried to get the film for many years and was thrilled to find it on Amazon.  Although it is dubbed, it is still a great film.  It arrived on time and in great condition and is a wonderful addition to my DVD collection.",1355961600,,296,3.8833333333333333

Often, these transfers are of a quality similar to multi-film budget brands. The movies themselves are unrestored and rarely pristine, yet still watchable (unless there's an inordinate number of repaired breaks). Extras are non-existent and inclusion of artwork or liner notes varies by manufacturer. These niche companies can provide a valuable outlet for movies unavailable anywhere else.

SINISTER CINEMA is an Oregon-based 'B' film and ""programmer"" specialist. Their extensive catalog includes obscure westerns, swords & sandals flicks, films noir, sci-fiers, crime and fright pictures. Sinister's transfers are often a cut above other DVD-R dealers.

Euro-made THE BURNING COURT (aka ""The Curse and the Coffin"") is best described as a supernatural who-dun-it. Here, a family gathers at an old eccentric's French chalet, soon after which their host either dies or is murdered. The chalet's housekeeper claims she saw a woman walk though a wall, and the corpse mysteriously moves from place to place. A bequest of the dearly departed later has his guests waltzing around the open coffin. This bizarre scene is perhaps topped by a subsequent march to the sepulchre.
