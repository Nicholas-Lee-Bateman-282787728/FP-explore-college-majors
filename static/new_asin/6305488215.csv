1034588,5,6305488215,"A good buy.  These shows include a few with Rick's wife Kris and David's wife June, so these shows were some of their later ones.  I enjoyed them so much and would recommend to all Nelson Family fans.  Excellent quality.",1140220800,2,220,4.45
1034589,1,6305488215,"I cannot express my extreme disappointment in this set. DO NOT SPEND THE MONEY ON IT. It is simply not worth it. The picture quality is horrendous, most episodes are not viewable at all. I felt like I'd gotten conned. Pick up some of the other less expensive discs and you'll be much happier. One note however, it seems to be a common thread that the earlier episodes have not translated well to dvd, so be careful and read the reviews.",1128211200,184,436,4.395061728395062
1034590,2,6305488215,"The quality of these DVDs is not great.  The picture is rather wobbly, and at times the sound is difficult to hear.  For me it's not such an issue as I've never seen the show in its ""pristine"" form.  I was born after its original run and have watched only low quality reruns on small budget local television stations.  What does disappoint me about this set is that all of the episodes come from the show's last few seasons, when it was way past its prime.  This show's strongest episodes are in the early years when David and Ricky are children.  In the later years the plots get too hokey and contrived and the jokes too forced.  The episodes with Ozzie hanging out with the neighborhood children are especially cringe-inducing.  This was Ozzie's way of having cute kid humor after David and Ricky were too old to provide it, similar to the Bradys' Cousin Oliver, the Huxtables getting a stepgrandchild and Ma and Pa Ingalls adopting 12 kids.  If you've never seen Ozzie and Harriet I do not recommend these DVDs as an introduction to the show--you'll wonder how it ever lasted so long.  I recommend this set only to those who enjoyed the show in its twilight years and can overlook the quality issues.",1125014400,7,1204,4.558139534883721
1034591,1,6305488215,"This box set is an absolute disgrace to this wonderful old show and what I would like to know is why I was charged $75.00 for this mess. The picuture quality is more than awful. The picture jumps, runs and there are skips in the sound track. Most of the shows can not be viewed due to their poor quality. I have this collection on VHS and the picture and sound are much better. I am returning this set for a full refund. Do not waste your money on this set as you will be very disappointed.",1116892800,241,490,4.061855670103093
1034592,4,6305488215,"Feminists attack O&H for its stereotyped roles (despite the fact that they were accurate for the time period of the series). Sophisticates see it as hokey saccharin family comedy (despite the fact that most American families were two parent households for the time period of the series). What O&H is is a simple, wholesome family sit com that was enormously popular for over a decade - and with good reason. It is warm, family-friendly, amusing (though rarely hilarious - the laugh track is over the top), and people could relate to the situations that still seem familiar to most people. It is too bad that this box set concentrates on the last few years - O&H was at its best when Ricky and David were kids and not married. I bought this and everyone in my family enjoyed it.",1072742400,18,777,4.597122302158273
1034593,2,6305488215,"""The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet"" lasted for 14 years, but this dvd set includes only episodes from the final season -- surely it would be better to show the evolution of the characters over time. Ricky and David aren't even in most of the episodes, which involve an aging Ozzie bonding with neighborhood kids.  The extras are a joke, 4 contemporary commercials, not necessarily the ones used during the episodes, and a biography of one paragraph. Even for a discount dvd, not worth the money.",1058745600,46,497,4.77906976744186

1034774,2,6305488215,"Years ago, I bought an inexpensive collection called: ""THE CHRISTMAS TV EPISODES"". It contained five Holiday Episodes. One from ""The Beverly Hillbillies"". Two from ""The Jack Benny Show"". ""And Two from ""The Adventures Of Ozzie And Harriet"". This Collection contains one of the episodes: ""The Late Christmas Gift"". The other three episodes are on a better collection of Christmas Episodes, called: ""OZZIE AND HARRIET CHRISTMAS"". I think this collection, falls short, especially for the price. And how did the mistake of saying the episode: ""THE DAY AFTER CHRISTMAS"", was one of the episodes in this collection? I know mistakes happen, but doesn't somebody check and proofread these things? Unfortunately OZZIE AND HARRIET, is one of the worse marketed series that I know of. It is marketed in ""volumes"", and ""best of"" type titles. The same titles are sold over and over in various collections. I am ready to buy three different collections. Yet all three have some episodes that appear on each one. But there are enough other episodes and each collection is inexpensive enough to go through with the purchases. This ""CHRISTMAS COLLECTION"" is, in my opinion, a waste of money. For five dollars and ninety-four cents, I bought ""OZZIE AND HARRIET CHRISTMAS"". It has Eight Christmas Episodes. Which includes the four in this collection, the two in ""THE CHRISTMAS TV EPISODES"", and two others. Even though this is a more budgeted collection, if the viewer can hold off for just a bit more, buying the better ""OZZIE AND HARRIET CHRISTMAS DVD"", the selection would be a better choice. It has a total of Eight Episodes. I gave this collection two stars because: it is to expensive to have only four episodes, and according to the description an episode is missing. Though there is a Bonus on the disc, but it isn't anything for Christmas. Unless you are desparate, and you've just got to have something for ""Christmas"" from ""OZZIE AND HARRIET"" and this is all that you can afford, then buy the other one.",1447545600,,1994,4.9375

So Ozzy  calls some store owners and gets one to hire them. Harriet does the same thing and gets that one to hire them too. Well both Ozzy and Harriet don't tell each other what they did. Then a bad storm hits and the owner of the story that Ozzy  had stopped over with the groceries and fines out the boys never showed up. Ozzy gets worried, but Harriet isn't, then Harriet goes over and calls the owner of the store and finds out the same thing. She then gets worried. The boys come home and tells them that they found their own jobs and got hired to watch tv in the show room of a store. The next story is about they all got gifts from Ozzy's  mom. Well the name tags got on two of the wrong gifts. They happen to be the ones for David and Ozzy. David got this one heavy book and Ozzy got this nice sport coat. So Ricky gets to thinking that maybe their grandmother made a mistake about those two gifts. They figure it out that it was and so the gifts then get to the right people and then they find a letter left inside the book and they were right.  The last story is about writing thank you notes. Ricky questioned about tell a lie about says its nice when it didn't fit and how that would be telling a lie. So Ozzy decides to tell the truth to his friend how he did like the gift that they gave, but could when his friend stated how they loved the gift they were given. Then Ozzy decides that it was best to let them think their gift was nice only to find out that their gift got exchanged at the store. The last story is about finding the right Christmas tree. David and Ricky rented this lot from Wally's dad so they could sell trees. David didn't know that Ricky sold the lot and paid back Wally's dad. So all the trees got deliver to their house and they then had to find another lot. Ozzy finds one for them and also does the realitor a favor. He ask if the boys would take the girls around town. So then the find that the trees aren't selling so they come up with an idea to have a show. I believe this is Ricky's first time singing on tv. The girls show up and the boys see that they are pretty and go out with them. The trees sell and then Ozzy sings for everyone.",1401062400,2,2336,4.025862068965517

Critics Choice Video did a good job of presenting Ozzie and Harriet episodes in prestine quality (with original commercials as well)...there are 3 volumes of that collection available.  This Shout Factory collection is great for other reasons: the extra features as well as the other rare songs from Rick and alternate versions of ""Right By My Side"" and ""Young Emotions"".

It's just too bad that the tapes are such poor quality. Front Line, just like Madacy, puts out these tapes recorded at slow speed - apparently to be as cheap as possible. So don't be surprised if you are constantly having to adjust the tracking on your vcr. The ep's contained in this box are: Ozzie A Go-Go (Ozzie and Joe Randolph try to outdo each other dancing to the young sounds of 1965-66; Rick sings ""Your Kinda Lovin"" in this ep); Rick's Big Night (high school aged Ricky tries to pass himself off as a college boy to impress a girl - and sings ""Honeycomb"" and ""Boppin' the Blues"" backed by the Four Preps. Ozzie, Rick and the Preps also do an impromptu version of ""Baby I'm Sorry"" - and Ozzie, I'm sorry, but you should not sing rock and roll, lol!); Ricky the Law Clerk and Rick's Raise are both from the later years of the series, when Dave and Rick worked in Mr. Kelly's law office. Also in this set are The Ballerina (featuring Kris Nelson doing a scene from Swan Lake; Rick sings ""Just a Little Bit Sweet"" and Ozzie plays the banjo); Rick the Drummer (the legendary episode where Ricky makes his singing debut, performing Fats Domino's hit ""I'm Walking"". Ricky also does pretty well on the drums, backing up Tommy Jackson's orchestra); ""Tutti-Frutti Ice Cream"" (the famous episode that created a nationwide demand for that flavor of ice cream); and ""Waiting for Joe"" (from the final season of the show, but oddly, shown here in black and white).

Sure was great, every bit of it - and the video quality was wonderful.  This is the type of product that serves to enhance America's image as these episodes are a sheer delight and comforting to watch - as are listenting to the few older radio (pre-TV episodes) shows included.

I love the endings on some of these video shows where Ozzie has Ricky or someone in the family look directly into the camera and provide some cute response appropriate to the episode.  Always puts a smile on my face and makes me laugh.  Too precious.

Maybe someday, all 435 episodes that were filmed will be officially released by the Nelson family; sure would be nice to have a complete official set.  Anyway, please keep these coming if possible, and avoid the bootleg copies as they are inappropriate and a disservice to the contributions of the Nelson family.

1035305,5,6305488215,"I don't know what there would be not to like about these classic shows from TV's ""Golden Era"".  The Adventures Of Ozzie And Harriet has been sorely neglected in recent years, never turning up in syndication, and heretofore only available in cheaply made public domain DVD's.

The Shout Factory DVD releases aren't perfect, and certainly some additional time and money could have been spend cleaning up the prints, but compared to what we've had in the past, it's almost as if we're watching first run broadcasts of the show.  To my eyes it looks like Shout used versions of the program that were broadcase years ago on The Disney Channel, back when it was a pay-premium channel.  Still, nothing to complain about in my book, what Shout has given us will likely never be released in any better quality.

All the same, it's great to see ""America's Favorite Family"", Ozzie, Harriet, David and Ricky again.....They've been away far too long!!!

I would recommend this set and the previous Should Factory release to any Nelson Family fan, or fan of nostalgic/classic television.....Shame they don't make 'em like this anymore.

As has been previously menitoned in earlier reviews, there are plenty of Ricky Nelson tunes throughout the discs, including an un-cut performance of one of the all-time quintessential Rock & Roll songs, ""Hello Mary Lou"".  Ricky and his lead guitarist, the legendary James Burton, never sounded better.

So, journey back in time to the Black & White Days of Classic American Television with the Nelsons.......Buy with confidence!!!!

First, there are quite a few more ""never before available on DVD"" episodes on this set than on the first.  Granted, there are a few that are already out there, but the sound and picture quality on this set is vastly improved from anything released so far.

I, like many others would like to have the series released like just about every other TV series has been - by SEASON.  I can't tell you why this hasn't been done . . .

Shout!  has done a good job on the digital transfer - but I would much rather see every UNCUT episode from season 1 to season 14.  I hope this isn't a trend where a company will release ""favorite episodes"" for years and then come out with the ""complete set"" after the fans have spent hundreds of dollars on previous boxed sets.

7889899,3,6305488215,"It isn't that I regret buying this DVD set, but it's left me unsatisfied. I wouldnt call this The Best of Ricky and Dave but more Featuring Ricky and Dave. First off, I have the Best of Ozzie and Harriet already as well as a Mill Creek set calledFun with Ozzie and Harriet, so I bought this to collect episodes that I didn't have.

Here whats I like about this set:
1. Seeing episodes that are new to me, since I wasn't alive when this show originally aired.
2. The majority of these episodes are when David and Ricky are in college or Ricky is about to enter college, so this balances out my collection that didn't have many from the later seasons.
3. Purely aesthetics, but the menu is designed in an atomic mid century style that suits the era while being functional.

However the set features 3 episodes from seasons 1 and 2, the rest are 6-9. Wheres at least one episode from seasons 3-5? Everyone has different ideas of which episodes could have been added & limited to 24, its a tough choice. Yet you don't really get to see the show when the stories had (in my opinion) stronger writing than the later seasons and showcased more comedy from Ozzie and Harriet, who understandably stepped back in many of the plots when the boys grew up. Also it seemed there was a lot more of Ricky than David. I love Ricky and his music, but  for a collection including David, there wasn't much of him. ""David the Sleuth"", ""David Gets Discouraged"", and ""Kappa Sigma Party"" would have been great additions. But this is purely subjective...

A more pressing complaint is the clarity! Example, on disc 1 (The Picture in Ricks Book) the picture pulses going from clear to blurry, compare it to someone lifting one's eyeglasses up and down. Thought it was just my disc but another review mentioned it as well! This is my biggest disappointment because it's highly distracting. I'm fine with the occasional dust/scratches, but this is headache inducing. NOT all of the episodes are like this though, so that's why I didn't return it.

Overall this is your best bet if you want to collect as many O&H as you can, like me! Though these episodes are edited, the plots still make sense. (Expect not to see the intro/theme song much.) All episodes are pleasant and you'll probably laugh or at least crack a smile throughout. But if Shout Factory were to release another set, maybe featuring more from seasons 3-5, hopefully episodes with clarity issues are corrected or replaced with other clearer ones so I can focus (no pun intended) on enjoying the happy times of the Nelson family!",1501372800,5,2565,4.591703056768559

7889901,4,6305488215,"Whoever titled this collection wasn't paying too much attention to the actual content. ""The Best of Wally"" (Skip Young) maybe, but hardly ""The Best of Ricky and Dave."" I mean, where is their trapeze act episode? Where is the episode that included documentation of a young Ricky being surprised with a cake and a song on the set on his actual birthday? Where is that great episode where Dave dreams he is all the characters in a PERRY MASON-like courtroom scene? In fact, in some of these episodes, Rick and David hardly appear, and in several Dave is nowhere to be seen. Also, the bulk of the material comes from the Malt Shop days when the two boys were grown and either in college or married, which was not the period when the show was funniest or most inspired. (We do get the first episode to feature Kris, ""Mrs. Rick Nelson"", and Rick's 21st Birthday episode.) Several later episodes are clearly focused on Ozzie, or the shenanigans of Ozzie and his neighbor Joe Randolph (Lyle Talbot). That said, if you love the show, as I do, these quibbles don't really matter too much - it's wonderful to have these episodes in decent shape at such a low price. The set was compiled from 1985 era analog masters created for the Disney Channel broadcasts, and they are edited to omit as much reference to sponsoring companies as was possible. They are not horrible, as some reviewers here have said, but as good as presently exists. I wish they included the tailor-made commercials that Ozzie and Harriet filmed for each episode, but if Shout! Factory was to produce a box set of all the 1985-86 masters, incomplete as they are, I would be the first to buy it and toss out my old VHS tapes. The great plus here is a wealth of Rick Nelson performances with James Burton on guitar, including a color run-through of the long-unofficially-released ""Fire Breathing Dragon.""",1490745600,11,1860,4.656534954407295
