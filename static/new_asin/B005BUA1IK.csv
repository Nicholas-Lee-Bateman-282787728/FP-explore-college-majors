4647347,5,B005BUA1IK,I bought this for my little sister.  She loves Jem and I was so glad to be able to find it for her on amazon.  She never gets tired of watching it and sometimes I watch it with her.  I think the themes of the shows never go out of style.  It's a real classic for kids of all ages.  It's such a fun dvd.,1350432000,,302,3.5846153846153848
4647348,5,B005BUA1IK,"I absolutely love this DVD! I was a big fan of the cartoon and was overly excited when I found out that it was being released on DVD! Even though I only have the first season, I'm perfectly content with it. The only thing is I wish it would've included some of the extra features like season three does. Perfectly priced and I love it! Thumbs up!!",1345075200,5,347,4.1940298507462686
4647349,3,B005BUA1IK,"...THAT is the Question!

Let me begin by admitting that my own personal answer was NO - I do NOT own this set, nor do I see ANY reason to do so.  Not that there's inherently anything wrong with it, and there's certainly nothing wrong with Jem, the 1980's cartoon about the girl singer with the ""double life"".  The problem with this particular set lies in its perceived value as a PRODUCT: it contains only the so-called Season One, 26 episodes out of the total 65.  Any true fan of Jem should instead buy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jem-and-the-Holograms-The-Truly-Outrageous-Complete-Series/dp/B005BUA1CG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jem and the Holograms: The Truly Outrageous Complete Series</a>, especially as that seems the ONLY way to get the extra disc containing all the bonus material like the Jem Bible on CD-ROM and interviews with cast members, creators, and fans. If you're not already familiar with Jem and think of buying this to find out if you like it or not, consider that if the answer is YES, you are automatically locked into getting the 2 additional sets that omit the bonus material altogether.  This is probably a nice set by itself - but not worth buying in the long run, especially if you're already a fan of Jem.",1342396800,,1285,5.248780487804878
4647350,4,B005BUA1IK,I got this for my wife who used to watch it as a kid....I have to say I enjoy watching it with her. :-),1330041600,4,103,3.3333333333333335
4647351,5,B005BUA1IK,"So I bought this as a stocking stuffer for my 5 year old since I remember always wanting to watch (em and thought she was so cool when I was younger! My 5, 8, 11, and 15 yr old seem to enjoy watching this. All of them think Jem is pretty exept the 11yr old. She asks why they look the way they do and I explain it was the style then. They seem to like the plots cuz they keep watching. The 8 yr old sings along. Their is no remastering of the show but the girls still like it! My son watches too. And they all talk about the epesodes during the intermissions.",1324857600,7,559,3.869565217391304

4647366,3,B005BUA1IK,Show from late 80s early 90s. My daughters like Barbie and similar toys but they don't care for Jem to my great astonishment.,1438732800,,125,4.478260869565218
4647367,4,B005BUA1IK,Good memories that I am now sharing with my daughter. The menus are a bit strange and the video quality is okay. Though it looks the same way it did when I watched it as a child on my non-HD television.,1437177600,,202,3.951219512195122
4647368,4,B005BUA1IK,"As a guy I souldn't admit I watched this growing up. I did ,however, and liked it a whole lot. The music fit the time and Jem felt like a superheroine to me. Those hologram powers kept this comic book lover glued to the screen. I believe marvel had a hand in this.",1434067200,,264,4.0
4647369,5,B005BUA1IK,"If you are a nostalgic nut like I am you will love this series. I used to watch Jem as a child with my cousin and younger sister and this transported me backed to the 80's and my 4-5year old self wanting to be a Jem girl. Yes as an adult parts of this is corny, but its the nostalgic element attached that has me loving it. Jem was to us back then what Miami Vice was to the older persons in this era.",1430006400,,401,3.7857142857142856

4647384,3,B005BUA1IK,the first disc would skip in parts almost to the point of expecting it every episode. I didn't want an exchange for it because my favorite episodes as a kid were on the other three discs. Which played fine.,1356825600,,206,4.3076923076923075
