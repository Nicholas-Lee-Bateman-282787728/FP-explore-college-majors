1937033,5,B0000E6FOS,"I found this easy series just right for me as a beginner. This Relaxation workout energizes as well as relaxes. I have had to do some for less time than shown and have over the last couple months strengthened incredibly. This is really the only exercise I do and my muscles are firm and movement is coming much easier for me. When finished I feel like I've had a full body workout. It is refreshing and energizing.
Wai Lana has a soothing voice that my husband calls monotone, but I find is slightly melodious and very easy to ignore when I'm doing something else, but easy to hear and calming to listen to when I do. She moves between poses rather quickly, but after a while I got used to this. If this is bothersome to you at first you can do the ""One Asana at a time"" or just do the poses in less time to give you time to rest more between poses. Wai Lana has beautiful outfits that change throughout each session and a variety of beautiful backgrounds. Her outfits are very modest and not form fitting (a plus for men who don't want distraction). She wears an elastic belt around her waist, which helps you see what she is doing with her waist. She is very descriptive of how to do the poses and what benefits you are getting. Because her voice is non-intrusive it isn't irritating that she talks most of the time. She says nothing extraneous that would distract you from the pose and over a long period of time of using the DVD hearing her say the same things each time doesn't get irritating.
On the main menu you have ""Start Workout"", ""Extras"", and Introduction (which is the same on each DVD). The ""Start Workout"" is the entire work out for that DVD. The workout itself consists of about 35 minutes of postures. After that is a time of music and meditation. Under ""Extras"" it lists ""One Asana at a time"", which does as it says; ""Customize your workout"", this lets you do the asanas (poses) in any order you wish with 17 asanas (on the beginner's I didn't count there others) and 20 slots for your choices, so you can do one more than once or some not at all as you don't have to fill all the slots; ""Guidelines"" this is a basic rundown of things to do and not to do to get the most out of it and prevent injury; and ""More from Wai Lana"", which covers all the things she has to sell - her other DVDs and tapes, her music CDs, mats, etc. You can also see those things on her website: [...]
Each DVD comes with an illustrated book showing a picture of each asana, its English name, and what it physically benefits most. This is useful if you are going traveling and don't have a DVD player, doing the set outside, or if you want to do the set at your own pace.
There is also an option on the main screen of each that allows you to change from English to Spanish.
The Relaxation Workout includes: Three-Step Leg Lift, Rock & Roll, Sitting Eagle, Arm Circles, Shoulder Rolls, Shoulder Lifts, Reaching Backbend, Windmill, Tree Pose, Easy Camel, Alternate Leg Stretch, Biking Pose, Drawbridge, Side Leg Rise, Locust Lift, Sacrum Massage, and Meditation.
Side note: the asana Wai Lana is doing on the front of each DVD cover is not included on that DVD, so don't pick the DVD(s) you buy by the asana pictured on the front.",1085097600,16,3222,4.344941956882256

8001970,4,B0000E6FOS,"I'm so incredibly pleased with this DVD! After not working out during the last few months of pregnancy and the first few months after my baby was born, I was dying to get back into shape, but was so low on energy and muscle tone that any attempt at working out was brutally exhausting. This beginner's yoga routine worked like magic. It was the first time I had tried yoga, and some of the poses were a little challenging the first few times, but if you stick with it, you adapt quickly. The workout it great for building flexibility and core strength, and when you're done, you feel both relaxed and invigorated. Wai Lana is very soothing and encouraging, and gives excellent tips for beginners who may need to modify things slightly because they aren't yet able to bend quite the way she can.",1392508800,,794,4.520833333333333

Maybe my grandmother would enjoy this production, but for a mom-on-the-go, it wasn't up my alley.

Needs to more updated with other products available on the market.",1123545600,,198,4.96969696969697
8001975,5,B0000E6FOS,"Wai Lana is very true to her art, her stamina & flexibility are amazing. She holds each pose for a good length, describing in details exactly how to move, when to breathe at all times, what to watch out for if your body tries to ""cheat"", modifications for each pose. The most important thing she does which most yoga DVDs lack is that she tells you the BENEFITS while you are holding them to keep you inspired to try your hardest to get the health benefits. She also uses some moves that are Qi Gong style to increase energy & blood flow. In all her videos, she always works out at beautiful beaches & other landscapes.

From Grass Tiger's review of Wai Lana's 3 disc set, the Relaxation disc has: Three-Step Leg Lift, Rock & Roll, Sitting Eagle, Arm Circles, Shoulder Rolls, Shoulder Lifts, Reaching Backbend, Windmill, Tree Pose, Easy Camel, Alternate Leg Stretch, Biking Pose, Drawbridge, Side Leg Rise, Locust Lift, Sacrum Massage, and Meditation.

My legs, especially hamstrings, were stiff & hurting me before the workout & felt great after. On a pose to fix poor back posture, I pushed myself too much & was in slight pain during & my back was muscularly sore after. The interesting thing was, if I slouched, it hurt more, if I kept my back straight, the pain disapeared instantly. The pain was gone in a few days without any pain meds, heat or ice or anything which I normally never bother with.
The only cons are that some people have said her accent is hard to understand, but I, who usually do have trouble with accents, did not. She speaks in a unrushed, calm tones. She also uses gaudy makeup & very colorful outfits. But those complaints are shallow, and all that matters is the teaching ability for a safe workout.
I wish more yoga videos taught you benefits as you did the poses to keep you inspired.",1109894400,8,1816,4.5504587155963305
