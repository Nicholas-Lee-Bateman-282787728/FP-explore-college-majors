6729651,4,B00O9ZSI9C,"Bigger than T-Rex is essentially a filmed version of the article on Spinosaurus in the October 2014 issue of National Geographic magazine, covering everything you'd want to know about the predator, which has become a rising Dinosaurian star in public consciousness.  The animal's history is even more dramatic than that of the famed Tyrannosaurus Sue specimen.

It takes us from it's initial discovery by German paleontologist Ernst Stromer, followed by Stromer's subsequent heartbreaking story as the specimen is destroyed in the allied bombing of Munich (the most serious paleontological loss of the war) and he suffers even worse for his resistance to the Nazi regime. More recently, we forward to the animal's rediscovery via a new specimen, skyrocket to fame after it's use in Jurassic Park 3, a fascinating reevaluation upon discovery of more material, and finally it's reconstruction as a display in the National Geographic Museum in Washington, D.C.

 Bigger than T-Rex belongs in the collections of those with an interest in paleontological history or the Dinosaurian predators.  It falls nicely into place with Valley of the T-Rex (the most current info and debates on Tyrannosaurus) and Beyond T-Rex (covering Giganotosaurus and Carcharodontosaurus, the two other Dinosaurian predators which are physically larger than T-Rex).",1422144000,7,1337,5.5024390243902435
