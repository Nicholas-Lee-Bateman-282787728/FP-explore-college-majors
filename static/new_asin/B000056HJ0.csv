7931972,4,B000056HJ0,"Before I saw this video, I was thoroughly amazed to find out that number of guns can be fired underwater.  I was also surprised to see that someone would willingly dunk his handguns underwater, get in with them, and try it out, just to demonstrate a point.  Lenny Magill is one of the better personalities I have seen in gun related videos, and is such a person to do this.  With a light amount of humor, and a proper amount of respect for the guns (and his wife's pool), Lenny provided an interesting time in this revealing video.
There are a number of factors to take into consideration with shooting underwater, and Lenny covers some very interesting points.  Lenny also proceeds after a number of the testings, to diagnose some of the problems encountered, and provides skillful explanation in overcoming these obstacles.
This video held attention better than most of my other gun videos, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is an avid gun shooter.  It does raise the possibility of rifles, but the video does only show handguns.  Something for the future, I guess.",976492800,3,1079,4.712765957446808
