8684109,5,B00OLFDHTQ,"I love horror collections!  I own all the Midnight Horror, Tales of Terror, and 50 packs.  This reminds me a lot of the Midnight Horror packs.  The 4 films are really different from one another.  Shadow Creek Cult and Family Secret are my two faves.  I don't really like found footage but Shadow Creek Cult is really well done, the monsters are awesome and the tension is great.  Family Secret is a whodunit with a cool twist ending.  Rise of the Scarecrows pays homage to the little-known 80s film Scarecrows which is awesome.  It's like a lower budget version but with great characters and a monologue by one of the characters that both explains what the characters are going through and allows it to be open to interpretation by the viewer.  Lastly, Evil Legacy is another found footage that bares is sort of like Paranormal Activity meets Killer Party.  This was a much better than anticipated and a great addition to any horror fans collections",1413936000,4,949,4.696969696969697
8684110,5,B00OLFDHTQ,"Have only seen 2 of the films featured here but it's about time someone came around with a true sense of the genre. Rise of the Scarecrows and Family Secret were made with a lot of love for horror films and that comes out on the screen. Those two movies are worth the price alone. Give this collection a watch. Turn of the lights, grab some popcorn, and have a good old fashioned night of scares from some film makers that have a great understanding of fear.",1413936000,3,458,4.275862068965517
8684111,5,B00OLFDHTQ,GREAT MOVIES AND GREAT ACTORS!!!  iTS A MUST TO BUY!!!,1413936000,,54,4.4
8684112,4,B00OLFDHTQ,"Great collection. I've seen each of these individually and all are great titles. The writing, production quality, direction and acting are all solid. Being able to get all of these titles at such a low price is an amazing value. I'm scared stiff just thinking about it.",1413936000,4,269,4.74468085106383
8684113,4,B00OLFDHTQ,"As a huge horror fan (real horror not this Generation Beiber-Twilight fluff) these films don't disappoint. Real Hororr fans (and general fans of film,  hollywood/or micro budget) will enjoy watching these on a chilly October night in the dark with the popcorn and candy bowl nearby.. These films are original yet pay homage to the genre iteself. As a cinematic-fanatic I hope to see more of these films and its talent

8684114,5,B00OLFDHTQ,I've only seen two of the films in this collection including Rise of the Scarecrows and Family Secret. They are both fun horror films with lots of heart and I can only imagine the other two films are also. I'm going to check out the other two films and update this review.,1413936000,4,272,4.25
