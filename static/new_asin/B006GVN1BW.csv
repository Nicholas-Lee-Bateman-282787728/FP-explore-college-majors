4987805,1,B006GVN1BW,"I did not finish watching this and never will waste the time to do it. I started in out of curiosity ended it out of boredom and frustration.  I normally enjoy movie from Japan, until now that is.",1364860800,,196,4.157894736842105
4987826,4,B006GVN1BW,I was a funny little movie and I really like the ending didn't rely on typical cliche hollywood ending,1431820800,,102,4.421052631578948
4987827,1,B006GVN1BW,"The protagonist is so pathetic that you can't sympathize with him and end up cheering for his rivals to win in the end.  I dunno, maybe the director wanted to teach spineless, rude people like the protagonist that if you don't shape up, nothing good will happen to you.  If so, mission accomplished!  The only character I had sympathy for was the girl.  Also, the drunk salaryman who tries to help the protagonist was pretty funny.",1407283200,,431,4.631578947368421
4987828,5,B006GVN1BW,"The protagonist is so terribly, terribly awkward I got vicariously embarrassed for him and even more, I identify with him. He manages to scrape together something approaching self-respect and finally gets started on the path to manhood.

I really recommend watching this if you're in the mood for a bit of bildungsroman.",1399593600,2,320,5.153846153846154
4987829,4,B006GVN1BW,"i found the main character(s) endearing and convincing.  i love good japanese movies and this movie does not rise to level of Koreeda, Kurosawa but it is comparable to many excellent Japanese movies not advertised in Western countries because the characters are thoroughly japanese/asian. sexual content is relevant to the storyline and not gratuitous or explicit. is kinda slow at times but i enjoy slow tempo movies that feels like real life.",1398988800,,444,5.166666666666667
4987830,4,B006GVN1BW,"To begin this, I am a big fan of this movie. I have seen it on Netflix at least 5 times and am disappointed they are taking it off. Now the story is about an almost 30 year old socially awkward guy named Tanishi He has issues just like anyone else, dealing with work and life in general. But now, he is beginning a relationship with his cute co worker Chiharu. At first, things seem to be going good until an incident occurs and messes up the mood. Tanishi then spends the rest of the movie trying to win her back. So the story line is pretty good. The characters are acted well, with tanishi growing throughout the movie. There is also the character of Chiharu who we never fully understand. My favorite side character was tanishis drunk co worker who provides some comic relief. Overall, I feel this movie is very underrated, as we see a man-child grow up by the end of the movie. While the movie certainly does not have the Hollywood story and ending, it is still a realistic slice of life. I feel the beginning and end are the important parts that tell us about Tanishi and his character. I highly recommend the ending song by ging nang boyz whom the singer of the group is Tanishi. Overall great movie from the other side of the world.",1389657600,,1240,4.349137931034483
4987831,2,B006GVN1BW,"The story depicts the life of an ordinary Japanese salaried man, and his love for a female colleague. Nothing is extraordinary about this story.",1389571200,,144,5.041666666666667
4987832,4,B006GVN1BW,"Man, oh man. Where do I start? Toshini is a 29-year old virgin, and he's super awkward to boot. At a company dinner, he meets Chiharu and instantly falls in love with her. From there you'd think that it'd be a nice sweet story, right? Think again! Toshini finds a way to continually screw things up for himself, resulting in him losing his only chance to have a girlfriend, and get laid! To make matters worse, he finds out his so called ""best friend"", Aoyoma, knocks up Chiharu and then dumps her. It's here when you start to see a change in Toshini as he steps up and goes with her to the abortion clinic and signs off on the termination. He then declares war with him, and gets ready to fight! When the big show starts, Aoyama is clearly dominating. There seemed to be a glint of light shining down on Toshini if only for a second until Aoyama snuffs it out. A defeated, bruised, and humiliated Toshini makes one final attempt at winning back Chiharu, only to realize that she wasn't worth it anymore. As tough as it was for him to do, he finally pushed her out of his life. Even though he lost a fight to a rival, a girl he loved, his dorkish haircut and quit his job, he finally felt like a winner for once...",1389312000,2,1214,4.259740259740259
4987833,4,B006GVN1BW,"A schlemiel of Godzillan proportions grapples with the trade-offs of romance like a large, rubbery foe:  Putting oneself ""out there"" for love and doing so in cringeworthy style.  Watch in horror as Toshiro manages lame overtures, grabs the mike, steps up to the stage and displays his plumage of awkwardness in grand style.  Bodily fluids (they got them all!) shoot across the screen as this masterpiece makes a statement about normalcy, manhood, and achievement in way that machismo samurai nor western gunslinger can match:  To be oneself, whatever the cost.",1386547200,2,560,5.188888888888889
4987834,4,B006GVN1BW,"As the ""Product Description"" describe the plot of the film; pretty much VERY awkward 29-year old virgin finally get an chance to date a cute girl, manage to mess up badly with that relationship, found out one of his so call ""friend"" took his ex away, and now the main character is out to win her back.

Let's face facts people, at one point in everyone love/sex life we all make huge mistakes, some more than others, but we eventually learn from our mistakes...Sadly some learn them the hard way. This is what the film is all about: A boy facing his problems like a man.

Through out the film the main character, Tanishi , makes some HUGE mistakes, does some stupid stuff and get's mess with a lot. Oddly enough, even though Tanishi is a train wreak, he kind of grows up to be a man by the end of the film. Kind of though. Let's say, ""SPOILER""....He learns self respect.

With the other two reviewers before me, hate to say this, but don't listen to them. One barely watched the film and the other didn't get the ending. I'm not saying ""Boys On The Run"" is the greatest film out there, but if you really pay attention to the ending of the film, it is a bitter sweet ending.
(Here's a little hint why I think it's a a bitter sweet ending: Pay attention to Chiharu (The cute girl) and how she ""act"" (PAY ATTENTION TO THAT WORD, ""ACT"") towards Tanishi, especially the very end of the film. Let's say she's knows how to play that ""innocent role"" pretty well.)

The film is somewhat mix between ""Rocky"" & ""the last american virgin"" but much-much more of a bitter sweet ending.
If you like harsh/bitter sweet romance stories, this film is pretty good.",1372291200,4,1645,4.401315789473684
4987835,3,B006GVN1BW,"I thought the ending was kinda weird, he gets himself beat up. Than he tells the girl he likes that it's because of her that he was beat up, he asks for sex...... And pushes her away when the train door closes and shes like shocked that he didn't want her after all. Event ful alright.",1367107200,,285,4.107142857142857
8497834,5,B006GVN1BW,I bought this for my BIL for Christmas since we watched it together on Crunchyroll. I though he'd like a physical copy.  He loved this!,1515974400,,135,4.4
8497835,2,B006GVN1BW,"Where is Hana-Chan?  Yes, the boxer girl who can't hear who eventually was supposed to become Tanishi's love interest after the he gets crap beat up by Aoyama and Chiharu.

They ruined the series in my opinion, and they didn't tell entire story. I wouldn't watch this one.

I would watch the one 2012 Drama Version which have more characters and much more detailed story and it tells entire story.
But as word of caution, subtitle of 2012 Drama version is so bad.. why everyone is poor quality job of their work....",1468713600,,515,4.576086956521739
8497836,3,B006GVN1BW,"several spelling errors within subtitles. The movie was ok, a bit more raunchy than i expected. Never read the comic so went in blind. but entertaining enough.",1467676800,,159,4.925925925925926
8497837,4,B006GVN1BW,"This isn't a perfect movie and some parts are overly dramatic (Japanese acting style), but it is a good story and seemed spot on as a slice of life of Japan from my experience there.

I won't spoil the ending too much but have to disagree with some of my fellow reviewers who say it doesn't end well for Tanishi-san. After leaving the train station, where do you think he's running to?",1467590400,,385,4.347222222222222
8497838,4,B006GVN1BW,"A little tough to follow at times, but overall a good movie.",1464134400,,60,4.083333333333333
8497839,2,B006GVN1BW,Not my style. Didn't care as much when I was younger myself but ... it's like the hangover etc I expect some plot before fluff which it did not deliver.,1463616000,,152,4.1
8497840,5,B006GVN1BW,Great movie.,1457913600,,12,5.5
8497841,3,B006GVN1BW,"It wasn't at all what I expected. Seemed like the realistic tale of a loser, with no happy ending. Oops, sumimasen. Spoiler Alert.... But really I would hope the character's outlook on life would end afterwards. Guess that would be another movie. I mostly watch anime. This was a nice break to look at more realistic characters. I appreciated the acting, cinematography, and story line. You it's made an impact when you wish you could yell some advice at the characters portrayed.
The title is confusing to me but hey, thanks for the entertainment.",1455926400,,548,4.840425531914893
8497842,4,B006GVN1BW,"Ofc a lot of this is typical Japanese over-melodramatic cinema, but still it's a great story.  It's so cringe-worthy it ranks right up there with some of the best/worst moments in Napoleon Dynamite, and it is just as awesome in the same way.

Not for teens under 17, imho.",1453939200,,272,4.530612244897959
8497843,5,B006GVN1BW,"Haven't read the manga, but this movie is a great zero to hero flick with a very cool soundtrack...run, boys, run!",1447286400,,114,4.476190476190476
