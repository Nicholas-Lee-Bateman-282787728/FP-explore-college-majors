7923288,1,B00004TYBY,"Oh bummer I bought one for 2.95 before I saw this. Wondered why I had not heard of it before. I guess then it goes under ""misc. Carradine""",1425859200,,138,3.9642857142857144
7923289,2,B00004TYBY,"I've read the other reviews, and I agree 99%, this is a cheap rip-off meant to dupe the average consummer, but I am a David Carradine fan, so it's good to see him, although he dosen't indorse this dvd or get any kind of royalties for it. I also did like the thirty second snipet of a real Grindhouse looking trailer for Sonny Chiba's Dragon Princess. Now, moment of truth, I picked this up at a pawn shop for a buck and a half, I was okay with that, it goes on my self with KUNG FU: THE COMPLETE SERIES and LONE WOLF MCQUADE, but I see Amazon sells this thing at $12.99 and even used it'll cost almost four bucks after S&H, to be honest, if I weren't a geek and maybe a little nuts, a buck and a half would be too much, anything more, as Mr. T would say ""I pity the fool.""",1234224000,,772,3.9551282051282053
7923290,1,B00004TYBY,"Looking for scenes from the Kung Fu television show starring David Carradine and Kwai Chang Cain? Based on the title and cover photo for this DVD, you'd probably buy this item. You would, however, be greatly disappointed upon viewing it. What you get is an episode of a late 70s Saturday morning kid's talk show (at least, that's what it looks like [and I do recognize one of the hosts from something, so maybe for nostalgia it's worth something]). Sure, the focus of the episode is martial arts, and they tease you with an ""exclusive"" interview with Carradine, and close-ups of his bare feet (woo-hoo!!), but it's really the most basic primer to martial arts, a few clips from old chinese karate movies, a visit to a dojo and about 2 minutes with Carradine. Wanna know what he says?
- Kung Fu really just boils down to this [holds out a clenched fist].
Worth $15? Try 15 cents.
You'll get more from Bruce Lee. ""Punch is punch. Kick is Kick.""",995500800,17,942,4.547058823529412
