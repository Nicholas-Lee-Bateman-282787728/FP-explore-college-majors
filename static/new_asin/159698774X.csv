7799866,5,159698774X,"I watched the dvd tonight, it is not long, about an hour, but concentrates on how and why we are an exceptional nation.  How through the actions of brave men long ago who over threw a legitimate government that was oppressive and massive, and controlled every aspect of life; and formed a new country based not on the elites, or those of social status, and noble birth, but on what a man (or woman) can do for themselves.  Recognizing how our rights come from our creator not from some politician who lives in a world so different than ours.  Remembering how Americans did the greatest things, built the best things, and used our minds to create, prosper and thrive...Not with government telling us what to do, but with government staying out of the way.  It doesn't matter what country we came from, what color we are, whether we lean to the left or the right, but that we are Americans and we have the opportunity to do the best that we can do, and become the best person we can be, and prosper without government assistance.  They interview many in the DVD, and all have a powerful story to tell whether it is the Ethiopian immigrant who is building her business, or S.E. Cupp, their interviews are interesting and powerful.  The movie also mentioned the many contributions Americans have made, how we have helped so many other countries, and why so many immigrants want to come to America.  We are indeed an exceptional nation!",1363910400,,1431,4.610236220472441

It is instead a review of Newt's new marketing plan.  A few minutes ago I received a call from him plugging the movie while not mentioning any connection to it.  He said it would illustrate the ""secular socialism"" we live under, with Obama's reelection.  Then he stops talking and another voice prompts the listener to press a number so they can order it.

BTW - I'm in Massachusetts, where most of can easily recognize BS when it phones us.  That he's wasting money calling anyone here just illustrates his bad judgement.",1362528000,,610,4.5

Other times, I could have thumped my chest shouted USA, USA, USA. A must see for every American as a reminder of how far we've come and how unique we are as Americans.",1317168000,4,341,4.029411764705882
