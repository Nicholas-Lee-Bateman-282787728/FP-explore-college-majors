I purchased a canvas to use but haven't painted on it yet though I will when I have more time. I have used some of his techniques for trees on a mural that I did in my granddaughter's bedroom and it turned out beautifully. If you are a beginner or intermediate and come across any of Bill Alexander's videos, be sure to pick them up while you can.",1448409600,,460,4.179775280898877
8024330,5,B00029LDZA,"I borrowed this video from the library some time ago, and am saddened to see Amazon isn't currently stocking it.  If you run across this video, buy it immediately!  Bill Alexander is so warm and funny; he makes painting less intimidating to even the newest of the new painters.  My 7 year old son couldn't get enough of this, and painted the most amazing picture for that age that I've seen by following this video.  It's great for the general population, and for those just wanting some technique tips.",1094256000,12,503,4.617977528089888
