The Film is very well made and i think, exciting, but sometimes muddled, due to fact that some elements do not wholly fit together, but to ME, there is what lies the charm as you have to suspend belief with almost any film you watch. It starts with a patient that is seemingly hallucinating and having bad dreams, with multiple personas and with a religious slant towards the full meaning of the ""visions"" or ""hallucinations"", so she goes to a psychoanalyst, and is reviewning the many things that she has purported to have done, and so that the psychologist/analyst, can also get ""into"" here visions/delusions/hallucionations, and interact with her and her victims, to see what can be done and what is going on. Add this with a ""crack"" team of investigators, that are checking on several murders done by this ""delusional"" woman,[They do not know it is HER, unil the last moments near the film for sure, as she can change her appearence at will it seems!]and you have some funny moments, and lots of nudity, and erotic moments, that are not too graphic, but over-the top, for a movie, i feel especially from Korea, and with such references to the church there[ Many Koreans are christians and one country that sends countless missionaries, especially to Asia countries for indoctrinations!] and the implications that follow, as even a priest[with whom was murdered at the beginning of the film!] is shown WHY and with WHOM he was murdered and seduced. All i can say is watch this recommended film and see for yourself and make out all the references to the past and present and why she is doing this and what has possessed her and the ending which is a shocker for things to come..sorry to say i have not seen a sequel to this movie, as it is wild! Do not read my boring review..go out and try it and watch as many times as it takes you to catch the plot... and see all the sex and violence, homosexual, erotic overtones, and scenery, the bad/terrible dubbing that does NOT follow the English language subtitles,  and some more subtle  types of nuances, that this movie provides. Just sit thru and grab a whatever you want to eat and drink and quietly try to figure out and even get turned on if that is your thing, and try to watch what i think...is a Korean ""classic"" and very much a film that goes beyond alot of the boundries that 99% of the Korean films do[that does includes the Japanese movies as well!]to just get this off past the censors there, as the culture there is very stymied, and conservative, and i feel, this film and the other major blockbuster Korean film ""The Green Door"", represent what i hope..is a new wave and relaxing and freedom to make and distribute these films.",1290470400,,2771,4.605263157894737
