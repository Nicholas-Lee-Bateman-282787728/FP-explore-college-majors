1082421,5,6305837171,I saw this series when it first appeared on television on TCM.  Its filled with excerpts from both classic and less well known films from this genre.  The commentary by Branagh is both well informed and interesting.  I highly  recommend it to all lovers of world cinema.,959472000,14,270,4.680851063829787
1082422,5,6305837171,"Why is it that the British always produce the best silent film documentaries? Thames Television produced the best documentary ever on American silent films, ""Hollywood: A celebration of the American  silent film,"" and now Great Britain has followed that with the equally  fine ""Cinema Europe: The other Hollywood."" The British obviously  have the best grasp of film history, or at least know all the best people  to consult. This is ultimately an international effort, created with the  active cooperation of film historians and archives from around the world.
This is a brilliant and well-organized piece of work. It's broken down  by different countries and their respective specialties; I found the  episodes dealing with French, German, and Swedish films to be especially  interesting. (I agree with another viewer, however, that Russia's exclusion  is puzzling). The French section convinced me that I had to see Abel  Gance's ""Napoleon,"" and I'm extremely glad that I did. It's one  of the most astonishing and passionate films I've seen to date, a true  eye-opener.
Like the ""Hollywood..."" documentary, this one  features great film clips and interviews with people who were instrumental  in the making of many of these films.
This is a must for anyone  interested in silent films or the origins of the cinema. This was such a  marvelous, exciting period in which everything was new and few things were  viewed as impossible, so experimentation and creativity flourished. The  multiculturalism of the film industry back then is sorely missing today  (since foreign accents didn't matter in silent films, casts and crews were  often multinational). This documentary does a fine job of recapturing that  heady sense of exhilaration, the international sharing of ideas, and the  pioneering spirit. It's a gem!",952819200,9,1813,5.287719298245614

7896068,5,6305837171,"I just saw the documentary Cinema Europe: The Other Hollywood.

It should appeal to anyone interested in film history, especially the silent era. Its goal is to document the birth of cinema in Europe and its development all the way to the early years of the sound film - in just 6 hours! Six hours is way to short for such an endeavor but the filmmakers manage to pack amazing amount of information in to these six hours, so much in fact that one is left with the desire to see it immediately again.

The film is in six parts. The first covering the birth of cinema in Europe, the second one is about the Swedish silent film industry, the third one about the German Masters, the fourth one about France, the fifth one about Britain and the last one about the death of silent cinema and the arrival of sound.

One would expect that the German part would be the best of the six but it was unfortunately one of the least interesting, IMO. This may have something to do with the fact that I knew the German story quite well, but I just felt that it lacked insight and a clear direction. The same goes for the Swedish part. The narrator spends most of the time retelling the plot of the films in question, including their end.

The France and English parts are pure pleasure to watch. They are full of well based social insight and focus more on techniques and experiments than story lines. The British one is admirably honest and at part quite funny.

The transfer of the films they show is exceptionally good and the collections of the shots they gather together here is a goldmine. Many of the films shown from in the documentary are still not available on VHS or DVD.

On the down side though, I felt they often chose wrong scenes from the films they picked, and left out much superior scenes, but such is always a matter of opinion.

Cinema Europe is a true gem which I'm going to revisit again and again in the future. It should be on the shelf of any serious film buff.",1168387200,6,1971,4.354223433242507
7896069,5,6305837171,"It's typical of American-centric viewers to discount the enormous contribution of foreign cinema to our own film history. Italian films like Quo Vadis and Cabiria directly inspired The Birth of a Nation and Intolerance. French films like A Trip to the Moon gave way to The Great Train Robbery. German films like The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and Nosferatu gave way to film noir and the horror genre in general. Russian films gave us a lot of editing techniques used today. It's totally ignorant to claim that European silents are not special or meaningless.

With that being said, Cinema Europe is a fantastic follow-up to Hollywood. Europe was always one step ahead of American film and we were greatly inspired by their advances. I really enjoyed the German and Italian episodes since they're among the most important of developers of cinema technique. Brownlow and Gill make the series totally interesting thanks to the crisp editing, fine selection of excerpts and interviews, and magnificent narration. Hollywood helped the rebirth of interest in American silent film and I hope Cinema Europe has done the same for European silents.",1158537600,9,1135,5.102150537634409
7896070,2,6305837171,"...They are second rate! Let's face it - outside of the USA and Germany, most silent films had poor entertainment value. The Russians were too busy using film as propaganda - trying to convince the peasants that starving and freezing to death was the path to happiness. The British were too snobby and class conscious to make a single silent movie that had populist appeal ((there is even a dreadful episode here - ""Opportunity Lost"" - that spends an hour of this series telling us that British films were unpopular everywhere in the world because they were dull) nothing has changed - British films have two minutes of plot stretched out to two hours)). The French made a few clever comedy shorts and Abel Gance made ""Napoleon"" but the French were (then as now) too self-conscious, too interested in technique for its own sake, too interested in philosophy, and too intellectually bankrupt to make great movies. The USA - whose film industry didn't rely on government handouts or intellectual poseurs - was out to make money - and this could only be done by entertaining people. A great democracy led to great democratic movies. Before Hitler killed all the creative people, Germany (a land of engineers and obsessive organizers) made films of technical brilliance that often entertained and amazed (""Metropolis"", etc.).

Cinema Europe is a documentary about the second-rate in silent films. The subtitle of this series is, ""the other Hollywood."" More accurately, this should be called, ""The second-rate Hollywood."" I have never seen so many unworthy films given as much first class attention as they are given here. I didn't think that I would ever fast-forward through a Kevin Brownlow documentary but I probably have repetitive motion injury as a result of using my remote on this one.

Dull, tedious, uninteresting movies.

Reportedly, Brownlow wanted to do a fifteen hour series. The producers wisely told him he was dreaming. There simply weren't enough good films to fill such a project.",1150070400,8,1995,5.021148036253776
7896071,5,6305837171,"If you are interested in film and want to learn more about the early days, you will be enthralled, from start to finish, by this remarkable six-hour documentary, the last joint project by film historians Kevin Brownlow and David Gill.  Intelligently written and wonderfully narrated by Kenneth Branagh, each hour is filled with rare film clips and fantastic interviews.
The only weakness here is a lack of extras.  A documentary or commentary track about how these clips were found, etc., would have been wonderful.  Also, a documentary package like this would be made even more valuable with the addition of a comprehensive index of the actors and films.",1010707200,20,655,5.046296296296297
7896072,5,6305837171,"Cinema Europe es la serie completa de seis programas dedicados a los orgenes del cine en el continente europeo. A pesar de haber conocido algunos de estos materiales en cinetecas y otras antologas, la extraordinaria calidad (se trata de transfers directos a partir de negativos de 35 mm) de los fragmentos seleccionados es verdaderamente asombrosa. Dificilmente podr encontrarse en otro lado la calidad fotogrfica de tonos y la definicin ptica original que tena la pelcula utilzada en los primeros filmes, como es posible disfrutarla en este DVD. Un reconocmiento a los productores Kevin Brownlow y David Gill. la nica objecin a la serie es la muy notable ausencia de un programa dedicado a los cineastas soviticos, as como la inlcusin de cinematografas de otros paises europeos menos clebres pero muy importantes como por ejemplo Hungra.

7896073,5,6305837171,"This is the best documentary on early film I have ever seen-- a wonderful documentation of the parallel film-industries in the major European countries, but beyond that, a lush, transporting showcase for silent film restored to a state so like new as to make no difference.  My favorite was the Swedish segment, since these films were entirely unseen by me-- Sjostrom and Stiller filmed native landscapes voraciously, and with immediate apprehension of the screen's epic essence.  But Brownlow, as useful a fanatic as film studies contains, lets his footage do his arguing, in support of his belief that the first three decades of film-making contained its greatest achievements.  If you've never applauded a videotape you were watching alone, this could be your initiation.",976924800,11,774,5.276422764227642

Amazing archival footage and lively narration that will make the most jaded film buff salivate.  The only problem here is omission-the pair wanted to make this a 13-hour epic like their ""Hollywood"" (wonderful!), but were forced to do it in 6.  For example, Russian silents are hardly mentioned.  But what is here is astounding.",971481600,14,452,5.236111111111111
