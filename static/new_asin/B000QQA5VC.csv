This package includes a lot of western actors that I haven't seen in years and a few I had forgotten.

2839274,4,B000QQA5VC,"WESTERN LEGENDS 50 MOVIE PACK is an outstanding box set from MILL CREEK of vintage titles that for the most part haven't been previously released by this manufacturer. The exceptions are four early John Wayne films and one from Roy Rogers. There are however four Rogers movies here not on any other MILL CREEK DVD package. There's a ""new"" Gene Autry movie, too!

""The Legend of the Lone Ranger"" is a 1952 theatrical feature that was created by editing together the first three episodes of the Lone Ranger TV series. ""Buckskin Frontier"" has a cast of several established and future Hollywood heavyweights (see below). Olympic superstar Jim Thorpe plays a henchman in ""Frontier Scout."" Drew Barrymore's dad (John Jr.) stars in ""High Lonesome."" Jim Backus (Mr. Magoo/Thurston Howell III) does his western turn in ""The Naked Hills."" Rita Hayworth makes an early  screen appearance in ""Trouble in Texas,"" as Rita Cansino.

Also included are several Tom Tyler films, and works by Hoot Gibson, Buck Jones, Ken and Kermit Maynard, Tex Ritter, Johnny Mack Brown and more. WESTERN LEGENDS is truly a Who's Who of early to mid 20th Century cowboy stars, and a superb addition to any western movie library.

2839275,5,B000QQA5VC,"This DVD box set is a real treat for fans of the B-Western.  Mill Creek Entertainment's 50 Movie Pack features many Western stars of the 30s and 40s whose work we don't see much of these days, for example:  Hoot Gibson, Bob Steele, Tom Tyler and Kermit Maynard, as well as sagebrush trios like The Range Busters (Ray ""Crash"" Corrigan, John ""Dusty"" King and Max ""Alibi"" Terhune) and the Rough Riders (Buck Jones, Tim McCoy and Raymond Hatton).  Not to worry, folks - John Wayne, Roy Rogers and Gene Autry get their due as well.  Most of the films included are not to be found in other packages of Public Domain films and there are no spaghetti westerns in this set, either.

These twelve double sided DVDs contain fifty different movies. Most date to the 1930s and 1940s, before expenses went up for producing these low cost films. There is a variety of stars, Roy Rogers (5), John Wayne (4), Tex Ritter (2), and Gene Autry (1). There are movies with real cowboys (like Hoot Gibson and Tim McCoy). The other stars are: Tom Tyler, Ken Maynard and brother Kermit (circus and rodeo riders), Buck Jones, Bob Steele, George O'Brien, Ray Corrigan, and many others. These mostly B&W films are now banned from broadcast TV, but you may remember them from the 1950s and 1960s. These were low budget ""B pictures"" that ran for an hour. You can compare them to current hour long dramas on TV. Back then most farms, stores, and ranches were owner operated small businesses; no national chains or franchises. Some of these movies were set in the 19th century, others are in modern times (automobiles, radios, and telephones). Many are concerned with the economic struggles that marked that era. The right to keep and bear arms was well recognized when these films were made. [Newer versions may not have the paper case with the movies listed, only a booklet.]

It is well packaged and comes with a small booklet that lets you know what is on each disk (they are double-sided and the writing is shown around the middle of each CD which can be hard to read) The booklet gives a synopsis of each film.  These films are old and some are thus not smooth like modern films, however, they are a joy to watch for those of us who like such early B/W films. You might also like to obtain a copy of the book, THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF WESTERNS by Herb Fagan; with a foreward by the actor, Tom Selleck. (Checkmark Books [Facts on File] 2003).  This book refers to a lot of the films to be found on this Western Legends DVD set.  For myself, this book is indispensable for the Cowboy filmbuff.

2839513,5,B000QQA5VC,Todays movies are in color and have special effects galore but don't have the heart of these old black & whites.  They have a good wholesome message and you can show them to your Mother or Grandchildren.  I have a dozen or so of Millcreek's boxed sets and I'm very happy over all.  You can't expect remastered  quality for pennies a movie.  Besides which I remember watching a lot of these on Saturdays and Sundays on Television in just about the same picture quality.

In their case many couldn't ride either. Still, you wouldn't buy this unless you were driven by a wish to see some of the famous names from yesteryear.

2839569,1,B000QQA5VC,"First of all, I agree with those who complain about poor lighting, scratchy sound, clumsy plot lines, and wooden acting/directing.  After all, 37 of the 50 films offered date from the '30s to the early '40s.  Possibly there were a lot of start-up film makers then who produced films of little lasting interest to any but the most ardent buffs.  You will find in this collection the usual barroom brawls, individual fistfights, tough-looking men riding horses at top speed, in groups or singly, firing pistols with apparently 50-round magazines, and of course slim blonde heroines  with shrill voices and zero personalities.  A number of films seem to have damaged sections, making plot-following even more difficult.

I purchased this ""collection"" several months ago from Amazon on sale for $10, so I can't complain too much.  Moreover, I was recovering from a broken hip and consequent hip replacement surgery, so I had a lot of empty time to fill.  I had hoped for better.",1359417600,2,974,4.969135802469136

2839582,3,B000QQA5VC,"Some good movies.  Some not so good.  As expected.  As a cost-cutting measure (I guess also expected), the movies were on double-sided disks and in non-labled paper sleeves.  Only small writing around the spindle hole  identified the movie.  Not good for my father, who has difficulty reading them.",1357430400,2,298,5.104166666666667

2839596,3,B000QQA5VC,"I just finished viewing every one of the fifty. As far as the selection of movies, I'd rate the package as 4 stars, maybe even 5 if there were a few more Hoot Gibson, Gene Autry, or Johnny Mack Brown. Surprisingly, no Lash Larue. Yes, I'm old enough to remember all of the great ones.

The downside. Picture and sound quality left a lot to be desired. None of the films were cleaned up; it appears that they were simply transferred, as is, from film to DVD. In fact I noticed a few short gaps in some of the movies. I've got a couple other collections dating to the same era that have been beautifully cleaned up; they appear to have been filmed today.

On balance, the collection is definitely worth while. A great memory of the late 30's through 40's.",1308614400,52,753,4.333333333333333
