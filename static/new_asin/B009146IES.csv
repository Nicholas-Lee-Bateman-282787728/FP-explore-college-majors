(Disc 2 from Volume 3 in the Volume 1 case, etc.) Overall, I am happy; just a little stressed of making sure everything was in the right case according to the episodes.",1393891200,,314,4.163934426229508
8533656,5,B009146IES,"If you are looking for the show ""Mostly True Stories: Urban Legends Revealed"" that was hosted by Natasha Henstridge and shown on TLC/Discovery, congratulations, you found it. This is exactly the show I've been searching over a year for. The episodes are as claimed, the show is the exact format as on TV, questions between legends and all. The quality is excellent and the DVDs worked perfectly. If you wanted to find the series, then definitely choose these because you finally found it.",1388448000,4,488,4.891566265060241
