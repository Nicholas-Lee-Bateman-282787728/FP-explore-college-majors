8072582,5,B000A2SZGO,"Vengeance 2002 was a great PPV to come from the Ruthless Aggression era and would recommend you buying it to add to your collection!

1.) Tag Team Table Match: Bubba Ray Dudley and Spike Dudley vs Chris Benoit and Eddie Guerrero

- This was Benoit's first PPV since King of the Ring 2001 and would be teaming with long time friend and enemy, Eddie Guerrero to take on the team of Bubba and Spike. Benoit and Guerrero stayed in control throughout majority of the match until all hell broke loose and the match turned into more a Tornado Tag Team match. Match ends with Bubba Bubba-Bombing Benoit through a table for the win  Match rating: 9/10

2.) Cruiserweight Championship Match: Billy Kidman vs Jamie Noble (c) w/Nidia

- There was barely any involvement from Nidia in this match which allowed both men to put on an excellent match. This however is not your typical Cruiserweight match as less high flying moves are used and Noble works over the arm of Kidman throughout the entire match. Kidman misses a Shooting Star Press, allowing Noble to capitalize with a Powerbomb for the win.  Match rating: 9/10

A backstage segment was featured between Kurt Angle, Paul Heyman, and Brock Lesnar which got kind of tense at the end. How ironic that 1 year later they would headline Wrestlemania XIX for the WWE Championship

3.) European Championship Match: William Regal vs Jeff Hardy (c)

- After losing his title to Jeff Hardy on Raw 2 weeks prior, Regal got his automatic rematch against Jeff to attempt to regain the European title. Not much to be said about this match as it didn't last any longer than about 5 minutes. Regal and Hardy take a few bumps and Hardy retains the title with a roll up. This would be the last PPV to feature a European Title match as RVD would defeat Hardy in a Ladder match the next night on Raw to unify the IC and European Championships, leading to the deactivation of the title  Match rating: 7/10

4.) Chris Jericho vs John Cena

- Jericho and Cena had been going at it for weeks and Jericho had even demolished Cena with a steel chair on the previous episode of Thursday Night Smackdown. This was before Cena's rapping gimmick and a pretty good match that I believe was the prelude for their feud years later. Jericho did a nice job putting Cena over to help him grow faster in WWE. Cena gets the win with a small package leading to Jericho throwing a fit in the post-match

5.) Intercontinental Championship Match: Brock Lesnar w/Paul Heyman vs RVD

- This feud began at the previous month's King of the Ring PPV when Brock Lesnar def. RVD to become the 2002 King of the Ring. Over the weeks leading up to Vengeance, to steal a quote from J.R, the feud gets ""bowling shoe ugly"". But that's just the beginning as RVD and Lesnar really brutalize each other throughout the match, especially Lesnar, who practically manhandles RVD for a good portion of the match. The match ends on a DQ finish and Lesnar gets the last laugh, dropping RVD with an F5 on a steel chair  Match rating: 9/10

6.) No Disqualifications Match: Big Show vs Booker T

- Booker T had been having problems with the NWO for the last month and Big Show was the head of the problems. After clocking Booker with a chair and chokeslamming him through the announcer's table on the previous Raw, it all lead to this match. This match isn't good and isn't bad but somewhere in between. The biggest part of the match would be when Booker Scissor Kicked Show through the announcer's table after clocking him with a tv monitor. Booker gets the win with the Houston Hangover off the to  Match rating: 7/10

Torrie Wilson and Dawn Marie are at The World and give their opinions on who they think will win the Triple Threat WWE Championship Match before bickering about who's butt is bigger and whatnot

- Triple H came to the ring to make his decision on whether he would stay on Smackdown with Stephanie McMahon or go to Raw and join Eric Bischoff. At first Triple H was about to choose Smackdown but Shawn Michaels came out and convinced him to join Raw, mentioning that they could bring back DX and make Bischoff's life a living hell. Triple H would give in and sign to Raw with Bischoff. Unbeknownst to Michaels, the next night on Raw at the DX reunion, Triple H would turn on him, leading to their classic SummerSlam Street Fight

7.) WWE Tag Team Championship Match: Edge and Hulk Hogan vs The Un-Americans (Christian and Lance Storm)

- After defeating Billy and Chuck on the 4th of July edition of Smackdown, The Un-Americans chimed in, insulting America at every turn. Not sitting well with Edge and Hogan they step in and become the Un-Americans' new enemy. This is a rather comedic and entertaining Tag match to watch and plenty of tagging on behalf of the Un-Americans is used throughout. Hogan does his usual comeback to fire up the crowd. The referee gets knocked out at one point leading to interferences from Test and Rikishi. An interference from Chris Jericho spells the end as Christian and Lance Storm win the match and the Tag Team Titles.  Match rating: 8/10

8.) Triple Threat WWE Championship Match: The Undertaker (c) vs Kurt Angle vs The Rock

- This match came about when The Rock almost cost Undertaker his title against Triple H at the King of the Ring PPV. Vince McMahon decided to make The Rock vs The Undertaker at Vengeance for the WWE Title but that all changed on an episode of Smackdown during a Title match featuring Angle and Taker. A controversial ending lead to Angle being added to the Title match at Vengeance. This is without a doubt one of the best Triple Threat matches ever contested in WWE, seeing these 3 beat each other lifeless to obtain the WWE Undisputed Championship",1378944000,,5709,4.568070519098923
8072583,5,B000A2SZGO,"Bubba Ray & Spike Dudley Vs. Eddie Guerrero & Chris Benoit (Tag Team Tables Match) - For this match, both team members had to be put through tables for their opposition to win. This was Chris Benoit's first PPV match in over a year due to his neck injury last year and how appropriate as he teamed here with his former Radicalz member and WCW alumni, Eddie Guerrero. For the most part, Benoit and Guerrero dominated this match (particularly on Bubba Ray) with their technical style offense and double team antics until the tables were introduced. This was a hard hitting and fast paced match and was one heck of an opening bout. Good match to start off the night. 4/5

Cruiserweight Champion Jamie Noble w/Nidia Vs. Billy Kidman - This isn't a high flying, daredevil match that most Cruiserweight bouts tend to be as Jamie mostly grounded Kidman here with various arm holds and submissions that damaged Kidman's shoulder. Kidman, for the most part, stayed on the defense side of things in the match executing various counters and reversing Noble at times that included Kidman delivering a Powerbomb/spinebuster to Noble from the top rope. After Kidman missed his Shooting Star Press, Noble took the advantage to take the match and retain his championship. In my book, this match was just as good as their later Survivor Series rematch months later. 4/5

Around here, Kurt Angle cut a promo on his Triple Threat WWE title main event until Paul Heyman and the ""Next Big Thing"" Brock Lesnar interupted him to declare it was ""the summer of Brock."" But the irony in it, Kurt would go on and defeat Brock at next year's Vengeance for the WWE title in a Triple Threat Match during their year long feud the following 2003 year.

WWE European Champion Jeff Hardy Vs. William Regal - This was Regal's mandatory rematch after losing the now shelved European championship to Hardy on RAW. There wasn't much going on in this match besides Hardy taking a couple bumps on the outside floor and missing his Swantom Bomb but thankfully this match was cut short after Hardy managed to roll up Regal for the 3 count. 2.5/5

Chris Jericho Vs. John Cena - This was John Cena's PPV debut as he took on the first ever Undisputed Champion, Chris Jericho. This was also before Cena entered his rap gimmick as it looked like Cena was here to focus on the match and nothing else as he did during his FCW days. This was a good match between the two and probably the seeds that helped to grow their future 2005 and 2008 rivalries. 3.75/5

Brock Lesnar w/Paul Heyman Vs. Intercontinental Champion Rob Van Dam - In this King of the Ring rematch, RVD's coveted Intercontinental title was up for grabs against not only the ""Next Big Thing"" but now the No. 1 contender for the Undisputed title, Brock Lesnar. I wouldn't call this match the true definition of ""David v. Goliath"" but this match is and nothing less the definition of speed vs. power! After powerslamming RVD on the floor, this match, academically, was all Brock. RVD managed to pull out a few counters here and there and was also able to execute his 5 Star Frog Splash to Lesnar. The ending was somewhat of a jip but it was good way to keep Brock's undefeated streak going and to keep the title around RVD's waist. Brock's F5 to RVD onto a steel chair after the match is a sight to see too. This was a great back and forth match and one of those ""lost classics"" in the history of the Intercontinental championship. 4.5/5

Big Show Vs. Booker T (No Disqualification & No Count-Out) - This match happened after the disband of the nWo and was made after Eric Bischoff came to RAW as the new GM. The match is never boring but is slow at times with the only big spot I can point is when the Big Show is knocked senseless with a TV monitor before being Scissor Kicked through the announce table. In the end, Booker T gets the win with his Houston Hangover legdrop from the top rope. The match was good for what it was. 3/5

At this portion of the show, HHH came out to declare rather he was going to sign with SmackDown and his now ex-wife Stephanie McMahon or go to RAW with Eric Bischoff. HHH made his decision after Shawn Michaels came to the ring and persuaded him to come home, that being RAW...only to give HHH that heel turn in the weeks ahead to clash with HBK at Summerslam. This segment didn't take any time away from the last two matches on the card as it was entertaining at times.

WWE Tag Team Champions Hollywood Hulk Hogan and Edge vs. Un-Americans: Lance Storm and Christian - Storm, Edge, and Christian did a lot of the work in this one with Hogan doing his usual stuff to fire up the crowd. This was an entertaining tag team title bout that showcased the Un-Americans growing stronger after Chris Jericho interfered to cost Edge and Hogan the match to give Storm and Christian the tag titles. 3.75/5

WWE Undisputed Champion Undertaker Vs. The Rock Vs. Kurt Angle (No DQ Triple Threat Match) - I have to say, this match is argubably the best Triple Threat bouts I have ever seen (Benoit/HHH/HBK from WM XX and Samoa Joe/AJ Stlyes/Daniels from TNA's Unbreakable puts up that argument). This title bout was tremendous as all three superstars was able to shine various times in the match that showcased Rock and Taker stepping up their game to put on great wrestling performances individually. Angle, in my book, was the star of the match as he came close numerous times winning the Undisputed championship (even getting bloodied up in the process!). This match is a must see in my book and without question, the best match of the night. 5/5

Overall, this is a definite must see event! There's no questions why I wouldn't deny this PPV's recommedation. It's worth the time and money!",1303344000,2,5724,4.559338521400778
8072584,5,B000A2SZGO,"I don't own this DVD but I have seen this card so that's what my review is based on. Let's get to it shall we?

""Latino Heat"" Eddie Guerrero & ""Rabid Wolverine"" Chris Benoit Vs. The Dudley Boyz (Tables Match) - In this one, the team of the late Eddie Guerrero and the late Chris Benoit took on the version of Spike and Bubba Ray Dudley in a tag team version of a tables match. In this one, both men on a team must go through a table to lose the bout! Was actually a good tag team match but broke loose towards the end! Ends when Bubba puts the recently returned Benoit through a table for the victory!

Jamie Noble Vs. Billy Kidman (WWE Cruiserweight Title Match) - While not as good as their Survivor Series bout a few months later, this one is nothing to sneeze at. Jamie's valet, Nidia, got involved very little in this one and left the boys to do their thing! Jamie takes this one.

Jeff Hardy Vs. William Regal (WWE European Title Match) - This was a rematch for this now defunct title as Jeff defended against Regal. This one wasn't very good as the two styles just didn't mesh well. Mercifully, it is kept short as Hardy gets in a quick rollup to retain his title.

John Cena Vs. Chris Jericho - This was pre-Dr. Of Thuganomics Cena and I might also add Cena actually WRESTLED during this time! Jericho, predictably, dominated this match but Cena actually gets a surprise win over Jericho! Almost a prelude to their future rivary!

Rob Van Dam Vs. Brock Lesnar w/Paul Heyman (WWE Intercontinental Title Match) - This is the definition of ""lost classic!"" To be blunt, these two kicked each other's a**es in this one! One of the best examples of striker Vs. grappler in pro wrestling. While the ending does damper it a bit, it was necessary to maintain both guys so it fit. If not for the main event, this one would've been the match of the night! See it!

The Big Show Vs. Booker T. (No DQ Match) - While not a very good match, it does have its moments. Particularly when Booker scissored kicked TBS through a table and did his ""Harlem/Houston Hangover"" legdrop on TBS for the win!

Between the previous bout and this one, we get a segment where HHH decides whether to go to Smackdown with ex-wife Stephanie McMahon (who is his real life wife) or go to RAW with Eric Bischoff. The decision was made when Shawn Michaels swayed HHH to come to RAW. This, of course, was a set up for a surprise heel turn on Shawn and would lead to Shawn's in-ring return at SummerSlam Vs. ""The Game."" But that's another review.....

The Un-Americans (Christian/Lance Storm) Vs. Edge & Hulk Hogan (World Tag Team Title Match) - A surprisingly good bout. While Christian, Lance and Edge did most of the work, Hogan did get the crowd going. Ends with Christian and Storm taking a tainted win to win the titles.

The Rock Vs. The Undertaker (who was in American BadA** mode) Vs. Kurt Angle (Triple Threat Match for the WWE title) - At this point, the WWE title was defended on RAW and Smackdown so we had UT from RAW who was the champion defending against The Rock and Angle who both were from Smackdown.

I have to say this is one of the best Triple Threats I've ever seen! The pace of it and the workrate was unbelievable! I would rank this second behind the WrestleMania XX match with Chris Benoit Vs. Shawn Michaels Vs. HHH. I think that one had more drama but this one with Rock, 'Taker and Angle was VERY close! It was certainly the match of the night and one of the best pure wrestling performances of both the careers of ""The Great One"" and ""The Dead Man."" Angle, of course, is almost always on his wrestling game.

Overall, if you can find this DVD, its worth the money!",1251331200,3,3661,4.377025036818852
8072585,4,B000A2SZGO,"i was happy with the price i got this for since its not a easy even to find anyway heres the review

1)Spike and Bubba Dudley vs Benoit and Eddie Guerrero Tables Match 8/10
This match started out as a good pure wrestling match with Bubba taking most of the punishment and Spike's role being saving Bubba from elimation when the tables do come into play you get some hard table shots but they all come very quick which i didn't really like but overall a good match
2)Jaime Noble vs Billie Kidman Cruiserweight Title 7/10
These two never seem to get enough time to do develop a great match this match doesnt surpass their Survivor Series match but its still got some great back and forth action for the time it's given
3)Jeff Hardy vs William Regal European Title 4/10
This match is by far the worst of the night with sloppy moves from the beginning and it only lasting about 6 minutes at that length it didn't even belong on the ppv but at least hardy gets the win i guess that's something
4)John Cena vs Chris Jericho 6/10
This match wasn't that great either you'll notice a trend of shortened matches which kind of drags the ppv down a little Cena doesn't get much offense in during the match but wins with a roll up
5)RVD vs Brock lesnar 8/10
I had heard alot of good things about this match and it delivered this allowed lesnar to show off his power and show that RVD could hold his on against the big guys RVD gets in his usual kicks and high flying moves the ending could have been done better but it doesnt hurt the match much
6)Big Show vs Booker T 6/10
Here we have another short match but the competitors do what they can and you get sort of an upset ending you get a weak table spot with booker delivering an axe/scissors kick to big show nothing special here
7)here is where Triple H comes down to choose the brand he wants to wrestle on this just took up way to much time that could have been added to another match its semi entertaining but it could have been shortened or even used on raw
8)Edge and Hogan vs Christian and Lance Storm Tag Titles 6/10
Maybe im being brutal with this rating but this match just bored me i've never been a Hogan fan and he's his normal slow 2-3 move self here it gets old real quick i was glad the Titles changed hands this is an average tag match at best
9)Undertaker vs Rock vs Angle Undisputed Title 9/10
I didn't get into this match at first but as it progressed it picked up and became something great with stolen finishers and alot of close falls i think the Rock got this win because he wanted one more run before he quit wrestling and he got it this is not the best Triple Threat Match not even close really but it is still the match of the night",1244764800,,2699,4.220502901353965
8072586,5,B000A2SZGO,"This is my take on WWE Vengeance '02.

I remember seeing this one on PPV when it happened. It was actually a very exciting card one match after another.

Bubba Ray & Spike Dudley vs. Eddie Guerrero & Chris Benoit(RIP Both) (Tables Match)
Jamie Knoble vs. Billy Kidman (WWE Cruiserweight Championship)
Jeff Hardy vs. William Regal (WWE European Championship)
Chris Jericho vs. John Cena (Cena's PPV Debut)
Rob Van Dam vs. Brock Lesnar (WWE Intercontinental Championship)
Booker T. vs. The Big Show (No Disqualification)
The Un-Americans vs. Hulk Hogan & Edge (WWE Tag Team Championship)
The Rock vs. The Undertaker vs. Kurt Angle (WWE Undisputed Championship)

It is one of the hardest DVDs to find and if you buy it, hold on to it forever.

I saw this show on WWE 24/7 Classics On Demand twice(2006 & 09). The only thing disappointing thing about the most recent airing is that the match between the Dudleys and Guerrero/Benoit is edited out. If you are a die-hard Guerrero/Benoit fan, get the DVD and that match will be on there.",1234224000,,1030,4.80225988700565
8072587,3,B000A2SZGO,"Bubba Ray and Spike Dudley VS Eddie Guerrero and Chris Benoit (RIP) in a Tables match: Benoit and Guerrero made a hell of a tag team but why a tables match? Still, hell of a match with a few sweet spots at the end.

Jamie Noble VS Billy Kidman: A fast paced contest that ended with a clean finish.

William Regal VS Jeff Hardy: Two talented wrestlers that have a problem following WWE's wellness policy. This match was short, didn't flow well, and just plain stunk.

Afterwards, Flair and Hogan congratulate Hardy. Flair and Hogan then have a funny then serious promo.

John Cena VS Chris Jericho: A very green Cena, just a month into his WWE career. This two would have better matches later on but this was a quick ""upset"" win by Cena.

RVD VS Brock Lesnar: Heyman fawned over Lesnar's power; Yes, it was a bit creepy. People enjoyed this match but I thought it sucked. RVD does a great job though, as always.

Booker T VS Big Show: I don't like Booker matches but this one was short and had a few good spots in it. Liked the scissor kick thru the table and the ending move.

Triple H-Raw and Smackdown. This match lasted longer then at least three matches on the PPV. Could have been saved for Raw.

Hogan and Edge VS Christian and Lance Storm: Did not care for this match at all.

Undertaker VS Rock VS Kurt Angle: I heard this was the one of the greatest triple threat matches in the history of the WWE. Well it was good but not the best triple threat match ever. Rock wins his 7th world title, a record. Then he went to Hollywood.

This is a rare ppv but I got it for a fairly good price. I found the rare Judgement Day 2002 PPV at my favorite music store for less then 15, I would not recommend this for a high price. Unless your a serious collector. It also has the Edge and Hogan VS Billy and Chuck match from Smackdown, that is also on Hogan's Ultimate Anthology. A decent PPV but by far, not the best.",1211414400,,1911,4.239669421487603
8072588,5,B000A2SZGO,"This is easily the hardest WWE DVD I've ever tried to find, but it was worth the 40 bucks I spent on it.  The ""Vengeance"" PPVs from the WWE are always an entertaining event, but this 2002 edition is the absolute best of them all!  Read on...

Bubba Ray and Spike Dudley take on then-recently returned Eddie Guerrero and Chris Benoit in a Table Match.  This is a strange contest, because only one man is supposed to be in the ring at once, yet there are no DQs.  However, this makes for some good Tag Team wrestling, especially from Benoit and Eddie.  If you go in expecting a Tag Team match w/ less focus on Table spots, you're in for a solid experience. (7.5/10)

Jamie Noble defends the Cruiserweight Championship against Billy Kidman in an excellent contest.  There's little-to-no involvement from Nidia, which lets these two great light-heavyweights put on a spectacular show.  Not quite as good as their ""Survivor Series 2002"" matchup, but so what?  (8.5/10)

The worst match is William Regal challenging Jeff Hardy for the now-shelved European Championship.  The backstory is Regal cries when he loses his recent matches, which is an amusing setup.  But both men are sloppy, and frankly don't look very good in this one.  Could've been worthwhile, but just poorly executed.  (4.0/10)

Now for some nostalgia, Chris Jericho accepts pre-thug John Cena's challenge for a ""SmackDown"" rematch.  This is a solid contest between the rookie Cena (he was only w/ WWE for a month at the time) and Jericho.  It isn't going to blow anyone's socks off, but it reminds me that Cena can freestyle-wrestle when given the chance.  Won't shut up Cena's detractors, but maybe this will calm us down a bit.  (6.5/10)

Rob Van Dam and Brock Lesnar compete for RVD's Intercontinental Championship in a King-of-the-Ring 'rematch', of sorts.  The Michigan crowd is wild not just for RVD, but also for this fast-paced, hard-hitting blockbuster!  I don't want to give away the ending, but it might disappoint some fans.  But I forgive the decision because RVD and Lesnar kept battling it out w/ weapons afterwards.  Also, the finish 'maintained' both men's careers.  Tied with the main event for the best match on the card!  (9.0/10)

While in the new nWo, Big Show and Booker T began a feud, and got booked for this PPV match.  Vince McMahon then disbanded the nWo after some roster setbacks, yet this match stayed on the card.  Booker and Show put on a No Disqualifications Match that's never boring, but not particularly good.  However, there are some neat spots, and it won't take up much of your time.  (5.5/10)

One huge attraction of this PPV isn't even a match at all.  Triple H must choose a brand to wrestle for.  It becomes an entertaining in-ring segment that was built-up for weeks, and came to a conclusion here.  Without giving away too much, HHH rips on both Eric Bischoff (RAW GM) and Stephanie McMahon (SD GM and ""ex-wife""), and everyone is entertaining while on the mike.  To my pleasant surprise, this promo is worth the PPV airtime.

The next match is Christian & Lance Storm challenging Edge & Hollywood Hulk Hogan for the Tag Team Championships (the only belts at the time).  The Un-American angle was a good one, and having Hogan/Edge win the titles on July 4th 2002 was also cool.  So, this feud had a nice two-week build-up.  As for the actual contest, Hogan is up to his usual tricks, while the other guys do most of the work.  What can I say?  Somehow Hogan is forgiven for his lack of participation.  The tag team action could've been better, but the crowd is great, there's some neat interference, and the match is still worth a viewing.  (6.5/10)

In the main event, the tremendous feud between The Undertaker, Kurt Angle, and The Rock came to a close in this energetic Triple Threat Match for the Undisputed WWE Championship (there was only one title back then).  This is a rare example of chaotic buildup resulting in an even more frenetic match.  I don't agree when Jim Ross yells, ""greatest Triple Threat I've ever seen"", but it's darn close.  Stolen finishers, non-stop action, false finishes left-and-right, crazy crowd...this match just about has it all!  It's missing the indescribable something to make the match perfect, but all three of these men deserved to win the title, making this main event a forgotten classic!  (9.0/10)

OVERALL
To complement the strong PPV card, there are some neat Extras on the DVD:
*  Hogan and Edge's Tag Team Title victory (solid match)
*  Trust Company's music video of the PPV theme (good song)
*  ""WWE Confidential"" coverage of Eric Bischoff (good stuff)
*  Post-match interviews (more good promos)

The ""Vengeance"" PPVs have established a good legacy with the WWE PPV lineup.  The first Undisputed Champion ('01), the PPV return of Kurt Angle ('03), two show-stealing title matches ('05), the return of DX ('06)...these events are always entertaining.

But this is the definitive ""Vengeance""!

I don't give 5 stars to WWE PPVs or DVDs very often.
You may have to dish out some money for it, but with good Extras and an even better wrestling card, ""Vengeance 2002"" is worth it.",1150156800,13,5133,4.779043280182233
