The discovery of gold in California started ""the greatest Migration in History"". People traveled in groups for protection. A weight keeps the horses in check. A peddler sells items like windmills or even worm medicine. He pulls teeth too. Robbers shoot Mr. Knox and attack their wagon. Later we learn about the start of the Pony Express. Mail from St. Joseph Missouri (the end of the telegraph line) could go to Sacramento California in only ten days! They will need eighty riders and 500 horses to operate in relays. Clint wants to join the Pony Express. Ace Carter wants to join; he carries his credential. Clint is chosen. Each employee gets a pocket bible. On the route Indians shoot at Clint (he is trespassing on their lands). A robber stops Clint. Later a rock blocks the road. The stagecoach is robbed, the bag of money is taken. Can they catch this road agent?

Clint rides off to continue the relay. He chases the road agent. A bible saves his life, he captures Ace Carter and brings him to town. ""Maybe he means it."" Clint always listens to his Mom (to set an example). ""You might be my son."" The trial begins. ""Not guilty"" says Ace. Mrs. Knox testifies. Clint stops the men, and explains the family history. Ace never had the chance to learn right from wrong since he was stolen by outlaws as a young boy. Ace admits the truth to clear Clint of suspicion, an action that shows honesty and morality. The verdict is rehabilitation: Ace will be given a job and supervision. The Pony Express rider arrives and Clint goes to work. There will be a happy ending.

This is another morality play that teaches the importance of proper upbringing. ""Hoot"" Gibson was a real cowboy, who starred in his own rodeo show. Note the relative absence of gunplay compared to some other westerns. I read that cowboys seldom carried pistols on the range, a rifle was more practical on the wide open spaces.

The Pony Express operated to make money by delivering time-sensitive mail. Foreign diplomats sent coded messages overland since this was a faster way to send messages to Europe (via the telegraph) than sending a ship from California to the Atlantic via Panama. Information on market conditions would also be important information.",1277510400,,2261,4.730964467005077
