7809657,5,630111857X,"This is quite possibly the greatest ""bad"" film ever made. Filled to the brim with horrendous acting, fight sequences, costumes, plotlines and an ending that needs to be seen to be believed this is unintentional comedy at its greatest. A must for bad movie fans everywhere!",1197763200,,272,4.934782608695652
7809658,5,630111857X,"This is perhaps the best/worst/funniest movie i have ever seen.  The american ninja's are clad in costumes that come in varieties such as neon pink and neon yellow. The fighting is mediocre, but the cinemetography/acting/audio is perhaps the worst/best/funniest i have seen.  This movie has the most amazing ending ever.  Watch this movie!!!!! It will blow your mind.  They have headbands with the word  ""ninja""  screened on it.  The plot is nebulous at best, but the mustaches make up for it.  They totally rip off the ET theme durring the badminton scene.  Seriously, stop reading this, and track down this movie and buy it.",1090108800,,626,4.9423076923076925
7809659,3,630111857X,This is a great movie to watch if you have a bunch of friends over. You will find yourself on the floor laughing your head off. The worst/funny  acting and voice over-dubbs are just enough to get you started. From the  crappy stop-action camera work to the cheesy explosions this movie is sure  to be a hit !  Look on amazon.com for ordering and price.,967852800,,352,4.369230769230769
