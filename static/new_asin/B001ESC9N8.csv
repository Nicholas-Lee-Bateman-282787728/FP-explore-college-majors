By all accounts of common sense a children's cartoon based on a gory indie movie shouldn't happen. But it did, and it's great.
Mark my love for this down to 60% nostalgia and 40% under it's own merits.

98 Lbs. complete and hopeless nerd Melvin Junko is bullied and made fun of and accidentally falls into a barrel of toxic waste. He is then transformed into a ""hideously deformed creature of super-human size and strength"".
Aided by a band of other such mutated superheroes he fights against the evil Dr. Killemoff who wants to pollute the peaceful town of Tromaville NJ.

The humor is great for a syndicated cartoon (they can get away with a smidge more than network shows) and it's fun.

If you like the Toxic Avenger films you've more than likely seen this, or already own this set.
If you haven't I suggest checking it out.",1455580800,,890,4.509316770186335

8299439,1,B001ESC9N8,"This show is stupid. This show's messages basicly saids that Toxic waste is good. The Leader:Toxie is bland,NoZone is nothing more then a hillbilly with a Gonzo-like nose,Junkyard is a one-note dog joke,Headbanger is a one-note 2 head joke and Major Disaster sounds like GI Joe who looks like a D-list horror film Tree monster from the 80's. The Villains are flat. All they do is fight the good guys,mess up & yell at each other. Toxie's girlfriend is annoying and looks like she came out of the 50's instead of the 90's and the same goes for his mom too. The Stories are basic. The idea of having toxic waste based heroes in a pro-environmental show is hypocritical at best. Much in the first Pokemon movie where the cast said that fighting is wrong,even though they do it anyway. Overall,Wait for Captain Planet to come out on DVD. I give this series a 0 out of 10.",1289865600,,867,4.493670886075949
