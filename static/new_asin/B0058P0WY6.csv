8462174,5,B0058P0WY6,"A very interesting look at the state of underwater rescue circa 1941.  I'm revising this review, originally posted in Nov 2013, because Video Dimensions kindly got in touch with me and told me how to access the subtitles.  I can't imagine how I missed them.  Since the disc does have subtitles, that removes my last misgiving and I'm upgrading this to five stars: a very interesting historical documentary.",1385164800,,406,4.9411764705882355
