8368954,5,B002FD7CGK,"Pastor Voddie Baucham is fantastic in this DVD, as usual God is using Him in many ways I'm sure ... but most definitely in my life as a refining tool!

I love the fact that Pastor Baucham has a no nonsense approach to the Holy Scriptures and will not compromise truth for the sake of ""tickling ears"". I have had the privileged of hearing many of Pastor Baucham's sermons and my husband and daughter will see him preach next month as well as other Pastors.
His love for the family and church is evident!

I believe the Lord will use this message to help us see how important it is to know that a mighty, Holy, and Sovereign God is in charge always and in everything, and if HE would crush and bruise and KILL His own son ... WE will not be sliding by any means!

I would love to write more but right now I just can't, I just felt led to write what I wrote and I pray this DVD is a blessing to others, I HIGHLY recommend it!

To God be all the glory forever and ever!",1315699200,2,965,4.036649214659686
