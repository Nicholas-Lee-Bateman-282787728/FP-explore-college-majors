8095895,5,B000C6EQIO,"This, the 4th series of B7, premiered early september 1981,  and then it finished 22nd december that year, and killed christmas for many a child and adult. Over 10 million uk homes watched
in awh!!
A fabulous big brother space drama for early 1980's  (love soolins nowadays long highlighted hair with fringe look) and Avon is leading the group to their final destination (gauda prime, Soolins ravaged homeworld) the end, which will shock all who see!
New ship the scorpio (nice modern grey bucket seats in fabulous fabric covering) is a wreck, a planet hopper and needs attention to all systems like, the drive, ballast chamber, and the non working teleport system, and they have to scrimp steal murder and borrow to get it in this season, and the group try to resource materials dangerously,
Crashing into asteroids et al, it's not like the comfy giant liberator of the past three seasons.
This all leads to many a betrayal, shattered illusions and fights, especially to dr plaxton, who ends up as atoms, and then there is thee arch nemisis and enemy, thee commisioner sleer (Servalan, who herself is now on the run from severely Disjointed federation forces who want her dead also) off course, she is a resorceful duplicitous gal who'd shoot you as soon as talk behind your back! Lovely gal.

This series shows the Groups lack of fortunes, and the losing of grip on the impossible situation, the reality that without real fighting poewer, bleakness and apathy set in, and distraction for wealth gain, just isn't enough to justify their existances anymore, and finally we move toward avon's paranoid neurosis which hubristically leads them to the last fight of their lives.

 its all  very exciting and action packed, it IS BBC1, '2' inch video picture quality and 16 milimetre outside filming shots.

 The visual Effects are rangey, the scorpio looks just fantastic, a brilliant model work for the underground interior mountain shots on huge launch pad, a tribute to ron thorntons skills, then there's the alaising CSO shots in space, although a few do look colourfully good, but generally not so good, but you can defo see improvements in physical design, like intricate futuristic gun shapes, flatscreen tv type vision screens in the scorpio, seating design,  and all materials used for the scorpio interior look good and more cohiesive, and the girls look real good too, love daynas punky gold purple eye shadow! That Would be fashionable again now, for that futuristic look, the BBC tried very very hard on quite small budgets back then, and the proofs in the great writing and storytelling.

All of b7 is basically good right from the beginning.
Well worth the time if you have it
Overall a great last series, outrageous in places, and out landish! And new romatic-esque fashions,  but B7 is never bad or dull.
1981 was a great vintage, I love the style of this show, its vivid and colourful, and child like at times, it showed real guts in the end!
And you should try to give it a chance if you would? See it, you'l love it too.  It stands the test of time enough to be great.
But buy a multi region player to watch this dvd, as for usa, this is  unfortunately,  a BBC uk release from many yrs ago.",1412812800,,3206,4.7428057553956835

8095897,5,B000C6EQIO,Blakes 7 is a great series containing flawed characters and complex stories. Was one of the first series to make characters more human and real than others before it. The crew of the ship are not perfect even hostile towards each other.,1404172800,,236,4.642857142857143
8095898,5,B000C6EQIO,I had a difficult time finding this product because no one in the United States produces it It is a real Science Fiction Classic,1353456000,,128,4.375
