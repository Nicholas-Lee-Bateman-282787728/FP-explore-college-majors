She bites him, but he does not become his slave. Perplexed by this Hazuki comes to live with him. Her father sends a bunch of vampires out to retrieve her. Hazuki and Kohei go to great lengths to get stronger and protect the happy life they have together.

This anime was a lot fun to watch. There are a lot of great gags and fun comedy. The silliness isn't too much, too mask the seriousness of the strong feelings they share. The animation is good and the voice acting is too. One of the unique things about this anime is the soundtrack. It has a lighthearted and playful vibe that suits the show perfectly. All in all this is a series I strongly recommend it to any anime fan.",1354752000,,811,4.266233766233766
8172148,4,B000MTOM6C,"This was a good series. I enjoyed it for the most part though some times it did get a little slow. There was some question about if their relationship was really romantic or sibling-ish love. I would say that it was romantic, if its not too gross for some people. Hazuki does look a little young for Kouhei and there is a hope that if there is a relationship it would wait till she a little more grown-up. My only problem is with the last episode, it wasn't really necessary and can be skipped. There was some funnies but mostly you are left saying, ""huh?""",1196553600,,556,4.304761904761905
