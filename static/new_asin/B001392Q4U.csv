8249463,5,B001392Q4U,"I went to the premiere of this movie and loved it. It was funny and creepy at the same time. Really enjoyable, especially after viewing The Cracked Man from some of the same folks. The DVD has some great extra features too--really adds background and dimension to the movie.",1201737600,,274,4.612244897959184
