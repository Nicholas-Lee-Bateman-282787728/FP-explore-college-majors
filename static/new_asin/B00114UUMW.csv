3060328,2,B00114UUMW,"I don't know where the big companies got it from but with every ""re-release"" on Anime out there the buzzword seems to be ""remastering"" these days. Usually they promise us that the colors are now finally ""bright and sparkleing"". However, with that I don't always agree. When you've seen the original trials (an Aika episode is called a ""trial"") then this could put you off on this release. In many scenes some colors (red, yellow) have become so saturated that there is almost no room left for any nuances. And no matter how silly this series is, sometimes its small nuances which create the atmosphere. Note however that this problem (personal opinion) isn't something specific for this release, you see this happening a lot with re-released Anime these days. Personally I think this to be a bad development; its as if someone who never drew any animation suddenly knows what the original animators we're trying to achieve, which is something I don't believe.

But, despite all that I still think this is an interesting buy if you're into Aika. Summing up Aika (many others have done reviews on the series so I won't go there) can be best done with ""panty shots"". And lots of them.

What makes this DVD collection interessting is that it contains all trials and some nice extras. Unfortunately they have overdone the extra's a little to my opinion (including a textless opening/ending of all 8 trials even though they only have 3 different versions is a bit silly in my opinion). But that is made up for with some other interesting extra's which - to my knowledge - never made it into the original releases. Like original Japanese Aika trailers to advertise the series, as well as a full blown ""OVA like"" episode. And there is ofcourse the episode of the live action.

The only thing which I found lacking here was a video clip composed of several scenes of the original trials which features the ""Silent City"" intro music.

So summing up: Because of the remastering the DVD might put you off, but having all episodes in one box which has some interesting extra's might make up for that.",1210723200,9,2087,4.7095890410958905

3060347,5,B00114UUMW,This is Aika a adult animation series that has it's action packed moments and comedy all the same! A must own for anime fans! It's to bad there aren't many anime titles like this these day!,1368835200,,189,4.277777777777778
3060348,5,B00114UUMW,Series is very cool. Very short and simple. Nice storyline. Lots of panty shots but that's the theme here. Voice acting isn't all that great but still a nice series to watch.,1366761600,,174,4.46875
3060349,3,B00114UUMW,"Aika and Rion are salvagers. The world is mostly under water after a natural disaster devastated the planet. Many treasures lie beneath the sea. One day, Aika and Rion get a request to find an item called The Lagu. The Lagu has immense power that can be used for many different purposes. Before they can retrieve it, another group takes the Lagu and is planning on using it to recreate the earthquake that nearly wiped out humanity. It's up to Aika, Rion, and their friends to stop the world destruction plot of Rudolph and Nena Hargen.

This anime has a lot of good and bad thing going on. The animation and character designs aren't too bad, for an older anime. The story is intense and relatively interesting, but not great. The voice actors and soundtrack are pretty bad. This is one of the worst English dubs I've ever heard. There is a tons of nudity and fan service. I think that a lot of time that could have been spent on story was wasted on nudity and panty shots. Not that those things are bad, I just think that they took up too much time in this series. While the story is is ok, it is very generic, and not all that thought out.

This anime is light years away from being a 5 star series. I can't believe that it got any 5 star votes at all. The only thing that Aika has a lot of is nudity. You can give the fan service element 5 stars if you want to. The voice acting and soundtrack are 1 star for sure. The story is 3 stars, and the animation is 4 stars. Keep in mind that this is older (1997), so things have improved a lot since then. Averaging the good and bad together, I can't see giving this more than 3 or 3.5 stars. Any more than that is misleading.

I can't recommend buying this anime before you see it first. I've definitely seen worse, but this is not high quality at all. If you are in to the secret agent thing, you'll probably enjoy it more than most. Even if you do buy it before watching, you're not out a lot of money if you don't like it. Personally, I think it's pretty average. You should probably watch this before you buy it. Just to make certain that you are gonna like it.",1357084800,5,2112,4.197044334975369
3060350,5,B00114UUMW,"a female hero who has legs and knows how to use them,... kinda.

What Austin Powers did for 007 this movies does to the anime ""Daphne in the Brilliant Blue"".  Its not super futuristic and no mecha okay. There is a beautiful woman and her beautiful assistant who ""fumble"" around for a few episodes. Think Austin Powers as a really hot chick, in a miniskirt, fighting evil gangs of women, also in miniskirts. The movie isn't set in some new futuristic fantasy world. Its a real classic 007 spoof with Super Russian jets and an American ""can do"" attitude.

No one gets their head blown up. It just fun.

I watched Austin Powers because its funny but cringed when the scenes of the ""Fat Bastard"" came on, with no shirt. (gross) Agent Aika has awesome ""fan service/ecchi"" that might make some squares ""wag their finger"" in disapproval but I ""tip my hat"" to the ""Spies Like Us"" jokes and the moronic plots to take over the world, with a female hero who has legs and knows how to use them,... kinda.

Its refreshing to see a ""secret agent"" spoof with such glamorous women tripping, falling and get tangled up in some very cool plots. Some big guns but very little violence.

Yes, if u are squeamish about seeing beautiful women dressed in skin tight, supermodel outfits acting clumsy then this is not the DVD for you.

But if you are a fan of super models in miniskirts who talk like they know what they are doing (Like Austin Powers) and do it all in high heels then this DVD is a must.

just my humble opinion.",1346371200,2,1505,4.427536231884058
3060351,5,B00114UUMW,"Agent Aika is back and this time she's remastered with all 8 episodes including the special that wasn't previously released. Both audio tracks are present, the Japanese track and the original English dub we are all used to. The packaging is very sturdy, typical 2 disc brick style release from Bandai Entertainment and a big step up from the previous release.

Extras include a 10 minute live special used to promote the new series, Agent Aika tv commericlas, clean opening and closing, cover art gallery of previous Japanese releases and brief promotional video.

Agent Aika is an excellent show, the first 4 episodes are a complete story arc, that borders on serious science fiction. Alot of the real, famous fan service, is a result of Aika being in difficult situations, like when you see her bed with the bad guy, agreeing to have sex with him just for the special data disc for her mission. It's defintly one of the sexiest anime moments ever.

All the support characters are really interesting and I really enjoyed the show. There is a second story arc, episodes 5-8 but I havn't watched those yet. But if you want grown up, adult esque anime, Agent Aika is well worth watching.

The character designs are attractive, particularly the villains. I have to say I didn't go much on Aika herself, but that's only a small thing.

There's plenty of violence and what surprises me is that no one, bar two very nasty villains, dies.

It's probably more suited to males, but if you can see past all of the panties it's a lot of fun and a great way to spend a brainless, rainy day.",1242691200,10,565,4.203703703703703

I don't think Aika is exactly an ""agent"".  More of a freelancer, but her foes are as sophisticated as the ones in James Bond type movies.  So it's kind of like James Bond, except there is some magic, and set in a world where events have unfolded in a semi-apocalypse of sorts.

They probably wanted to get to the point with added gratuity. It also gets very lame towards the second half, as if they were forced to extend the story after the main plot ended, along with introducing an astoundingly useless character.

The sound mixing if poorly done and too dynamic in its volume range. Some scenes are quiet and hard to hear while others blast out of nowhere, making it hard to watch at times without often adjusting the volume. But the main issue with this anime has to be the American voice acting; it is horrifically awful and possibly on the top 10 list of the worst anime voice acting ever. At least Aika is done fairly well, but the other characters will all at some point annoy you out of your skin. Not only do most voices not fit the characters, the voices rarely ever portray the correct mood or emotion of their respective characters.

That it was chock full of fan service was obvious; the only question was would the story rise above this at all, and as a matter of fact, it did,... sort of.

The time, the not too distant future, the place, the sea that rolls over a sunken Tokyo.  Twenty years before some sort of not very well specified catastrophe inundated Tokyo and large parts of Japan and possibly other countries as well, giving birth to a brand new industry: salvagers.  For a small fee (or preferably a large fee) salvagers will dive their minisubs into these sunken cities in order to retrieve items left behind, and some salvagers are not above waiting until after an item has been retrieved by a competitor and then trying to steal it, exactly what happens to our 26-year-old heroine, the sole active salvager for the down on its luck K2 Corporation, a father and daughter enterprise run by a former salvager Aika has a history with, a history that gives her a very strong motive for trying to save the company.  For this reason Aika decides to accept a lucrative but potentially dangerous contract to retrieve something called Lagu, a decision that soon has her up to her armpits in droves of cute warriors in color coded miniskirts out to stop her and later in the clutches of a twisted mad scientist and his even more twisted sister.  Fortunately, Aika has a secret weapon beyond simply being a better fighter than most of the women she leaves face down, butt up, panties showing for all to see, either singly or in body piles: a sentient bustier that transforms her into an even more unstoppable warrior when it senses danger to her.  Of course the process of transforming does rip all of her clothes off; how else could it possibly work?

The first 4 episodes constitute one story arc followed by a 3 episode second story arc separated from the first one by a special episode that acts as a bridge between them.  There is also a live action Aika episode that is played mostly for laughs but worth a look.

Fan service?  Panty clad camel toes are piled up like cordwood.  There are also a goodly number of bare breasts on display, but the creators appear to have a particular preference when it comes to fetishes, and that's what they concentrate on here, quite deliberately to the point of ludicrous parody.
