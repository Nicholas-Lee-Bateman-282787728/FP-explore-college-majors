7505315,5,B017HMM38U,"So good I've seen it twice! An absolute gem of a movie that captures an unforgettabe evening between Bette Davis and Mae West. The actors are impeccable in their portrayal of these two legends of Hollywood. All of the actors are fabulous. This is a must see for anyone interested in the history of Hollywood, movie making  and its illustrious stars. I learned a great deal about these two ladies while having a lot of good laughs.",1451692800,,430,4.584415584415584

7505319,5,B017HMM38U,"Worth It!  Amazing old recorded conversation between Bette Davis and Mae West, captured on audio by a real charmer,
Wes Wheadon, whom I have never heard of..but I will be looking for more from him as soon as I finish this review.  I LOVED this amazing piece of history and its immense entertainment value.  To listen to their voices, their cadence, their rhythm.  Also as part of this delicious treat, the actors reenacted the audio are amazing.
At one point I thought, I wonder how Bette Davis still looks so....oh...they are actors.!  GREAT actors.
The whole cast.
Wow.  Absolutely wow.
Thank you Mr. Wheadon",1494460800,,610,4.8173076923076925
7505320,4,B017HMM38U,"I really enjoyed this movie.  It's actually a real audio of Bette Davis & Mae West who are portrayed by lip syncing actors/actresses.  The man who taped this introduces and sets up what we're about to see/hear.

These were two women who were major stars in the 1930s and on.  Mae was not only a star but also smart enough to write her movies which brought in extra income. She also invested in real estate so her later years weren't like Davis's who was desperate to earn money by the mid-late 1950s.

It's a shame the tape ran out before the two women were finished talking but I'm grateful that there's a little over an hour of them interacting.",1492300800,,647,4.4033613445378155
7505321,3,B017HMM38U,This film would benefit from subtitles. I wouldn't mind that the sound is semi audible as long as I could  read what the words were. I love that this project was conceived by an optometrist. I will watch anything about Mae West. The actors did a good job IMO for a reenactment show.,1489881600,3,282,4.320754716981132
7505322,5,B017HMM38U,"It only lasts a bit over one hours ( free on AMAZON pricier.. there's a bunch of goodies but they're hidden). and you can read the summary with the movie...
The rarity of hard evidence comes from the tape:: you know it's beautiful Bette Davis and the ever effervescent Mae West.. what they did was put actors behind the voices and they choose very well

I can't tell you enough, that this conversation is very rare and done very well .in that hour Bette of course did most of the talking but the facts that both spoke about were fact checked.. this was a real fan of Bette and the super talented Mae West.. Bette says she did a lot of rewriting scripts and Mae wrote every word and nuance that she did & she copyrighted all of.. one smart businesswoman-- I do hope she was happy/ she bought me so many many laughs watching her movies- im not forgetting Bette but no one talks @ the great Mae- scriptwriter- sitting behind that camera.. she did it all.. Bette had to concentrate first on her craft:: acting and man this woman could do anything

I guess why each wanted to meet the other",1488585600,2,1085,4.3399014778325125

7505326,5,B017HMM38U,"What a special treat this movie was, when you actually heard Bette Davis and Mae West having a conversation. There were also some very nice still photos of Bette and Mae together and some of them separate. At the time of this meeting Bette was 65 years old and Mae was 80 years old and they had never met, all of those years. How they came together at Bette's home, If I recall, it was not mentioned.

What a remarkable life, these ladies had lived, with the many men in their lives and a no holds barred attitude they both took, just to get ahead in life and at times, just to survive. Bette Davis and Olivia De Havilland had came together and tried to form the Screen Actors Guild. At some point it was a success and Bette had spoke about it, to Mae West. They should of had Mae handle the negotiations, because she was just a savvy business woman.

Mae West had spoke of her rise in the stage and then the making of some movies. She had said that she had total control of her writings and copyrights of her plays and her complete dialogue of her movies. She made sure that no-one in the future could use her words. They could look like her and act like her, but not the words. Very odd for the time, but it sure worked for her. She had mentioned during the conversation, that most, if not all of the characters she played in the movies, was based on her persona of ""Diamond Lil"".

Her plays, for the time, were so ahead of their time. One of them being named ""SEX"" and it was on Broadway in 1927 and she had other hits on broadway that completely sold out, during the time of the depression. What an incredible woman, but was a shame that she did not make more movies, but she was becoming censored during the 1930's. But her ""Pre-Code"" movies are the ones to watch, only with 100's of these pre-code movies, at this time. They are a time-capsule of how the actors were aloud to cross the line, before they were reeling in for the content of the movie.

The movie was made with very good look-a-like actors and the real conversation was dubbed into the movie, which was very unique. I could of listened to them talk for hours, but the cassette tapes only ran for so long and then they went off to dinner to have a much more private conversation with Bette Davis and Mae West and the other guests of the evening. Both of these woman, true movie stars in their own right, fought for rights, better hours and wages and to have dignity and most of all respect. I would imagine over time, they learned to give, as much as they got and could cut you to pieces with a few choice words, LOL. The actresses of today, have both of these woman to thank. They are standing on both Bette Davis and Mae West's shoulders. You are now talking, these movies, that both of these ladies had done, are fast approaching 100 years old. Thank goodness, they are been preserved for some many more generations of ""Classic Movie Buffs"" to watch and enjoy. For someone who would have the time and patience, I would highly recommend this short movie. It offers a bit of insight into both of these ladies lives. Thank you so much ""Amazon Prime"" for the chance to watch something that was rare to watch, that would not of been aired on any other classic movie channel. I have been a classic movie buff, for over 40 years.",1480636800,,3294,4.299516908212561

7505330,4,B017HMM38U,This is a very odd movie.  I almost turned it off but am glad I finished it.  A young man recorded the meeting between the two actresses so in this movie you see actors and actresses lip syncing to the recorded dialog.  What made this movie fascinating for me was how both actresses portraying Bette Davis and Mae West looked exactly like those two stars.  It was uncanny.  Had I not known this I would have assumed it was the original actresses.  This movie may not appeal to many but I'm very glad I watched it.,1473292800,,513,4.291666666666667

7505334,4,B017HMM38U,"This is like time warping back to when Bette and Mae were still alive and actually quite lively.  It was cleverly done with actors playing the visual Bette and Mae and lip synching to an old recording of their actually meeting.  Some interesting gossip, some revealing secrets and a good time was had by me. If you are a Bette and/or Mae fan it's fun - not earth shaking - but good fun.",1471478400,,386,4.273972602739726

7505341,5,B017HMM38U,"A Entertainment Journalist friend left a copy on the bed when I went over to dog/house sit for 10 days.  So I watched it.  It was interesting as there was no acting between Bette and Mae.  The ""bartender"" hit record on a tape player at a private house party that included Bette and Mae.  Mae never drank, Bette did.  And it is hilarious.  This behind the scenes evening is more wonderful and interesting as today's reality TV, Kardashians (was that spelled correctly? lol)  etc.  I do not watch any of that genre.  I found this more entertaining and interesting than ... it's times like these I wish I were more articulate.

It is so good that I bought a copy to send to a dear friend who is now 86 years old, sharp as a tack, whom I met 40 years ago.  She went to Emerson, owned a radio station and interviewed Mary Pickford on that radio station.  Unfortunately she has not viewed this video as she cannot figure out her DVD Player.",1468540800,4,934,4.335260115606936

7505345,3,B017HMM38U,Interesting concept. I had never heard of this conversation before. It was well presented and worth the $10.,1466380800,,108,5.055555555555555

7505349,5,B017HMM38U,"I am a fan of Bette Davis, more so than Mae West, so I was interested in this.  The first ten minutes or so are boring because the narrator is trying to set up the evening. The actors are pretty good, as they are basically lip-synced to the audio recording. The audio of the voices is hard to hear and understand at times. If there were some kind of audio restoration to remove background noise it would help.  Overall I really enjoyed this because it was cool to hear these two legends discuss their careers.  The narrator interrupts too much with his stupid comments and he has too many closeups of himself.  This is worth watching if you're a fan. I think they did a good job of creating an illusion of Davis and West visiting.",1465603200,,730,4.345588235294118

7505354,5,B017HMM38U,This documentary tells the story of a 1973 first time meeting of Miss Davis & Miss West from a tape recording by a young bartender at the cocktail party where in meeting took place. Sally Kellerman provides narration for the back story of the topics the ladies discuss. There are actresses portraying Davis & West lip-syncing to the actual 1973 recording. It is not easy to lip sync to spoken words yet these ladies do it flawlessly. I would like to see an interview with the actresses talking about their experience in the roles of these screen legends. This is an interesting film and a lot of fun!,1463270400,7,600,4.564814814814815
7505355,5,B017HMM38U,"Contrary to what others have written, I found this highly amusing and conceptually clever! Ok, the sound's patchy in some places, but there are sub-titles provided throughout, a clever 'documentary-style' device to provide background info, and great performances by all.

7505356,4,B017HMM38U,"You feel like a fly on the wall in a room co-occupied by two legends engaged in conversation we would never be privy to if not for this. To hear their conversation in their regular speaking voices and their views unfiltered, just fascinates. Although the original audio, recorded on a cassette recorder, is hard to follow alone, the reenactment fills in for any parts of dialogue we may not comprehend alone. Imperfect because of its impromptu nature, but perfect to have had the chance to hear Davis and West engage each other as if to convince the other what great stars they are.",1459296000,,582,4.660194174757281
7505357,3,B017HMM38U,OK is about as far as I could go.....and I stopped watching it.,1459209600,,63,3.923076923076923
7505358,4,B017HMM38U,"Fascinating encounter with ""Mae"" looking somewhat uncomfortable as most of the people around her steadily become drunker. What with the careful restoration of the soundtrack, the acting, and everything, I was disappointed to see clips from ""Goin' to Town"" mislabeled as ""Night After Night."" Insight to Mae being Mae for once and not in character.

As a hearing impaired person, I was grateful for the closed captioning. Too bad it was limited to the conversations between Bette, Mae & their companions.",1459209600,,502,5.197530864197531

7505361,5,B017HMM38U,"If ""Hollywood Queens"" of today collide, a flurry of cat fur is the likely result. When Silver Screen Royalty, Bette Davis and Mae West finally met in 1973, these film goddesses formed an instant mutual admiration society. Reflecting upon their lives, loves and careers, their no holds barred conversation, amazingly captured on audio tape gives the viewer a truly unprecedented peek into the minds of these two legends letting their hair down. Director Wes Wheadon and his crew, along with the actresses portraying Davis and West and other participants of this magical evening, are brilliantly cast. Cleverly woven into the live action are vintage audio and film clips, comments from film historians, a personal secretary among others, which make for a very rich visual tapestry. This documentary is a absolute must see for those curious how these two film legends sidestepped the opposition thrown their way as they climbed the ladder of success rung by rung wearing those platform shoes. This feel good documentary will make you want to shout out ""Hooray"" to Wes Wheadon for having the foresight to slip that tape deck behind the bar!",1457136000,11,1136,5.080213903743315

7505364,5,B017HMM38U,"To have been ""star-struck"" as Ms. Davis supposedly was at meeting Ms. West, she (or the alcohol) sure talked a lot during this encounter. Ms. West just sat and let  Ms. Davis drive the bus... with maybe just a hint of condescension in her eyes. The bad lip-synching of the actors involved was a bit distracting, but an interesting encounter all the same.",1456531200,,354,4.619047619047619
7505365,5,B017HMM38U,"Great concept and content. I thought is was a great mix of entertainment and history of the stars and they wan that Hollywood works. The actresses in particular that portray Davis and West are right on - excellent casting! My only criticism of the film is the somewhat inconsistent voice track volume and clarity - but that is to be somewhat expected. If you are fan of Mae, Bette, or women in the entertainment industry; you MUST see this film.",1455580800,5,445,4.575

To put it in a nutshell, the review ByMichael91401on January 20, 2016, pretty much sums it up for me.

The actors portraying Bette and Mae are actually much better than I expected, but it all feels more than a little gimmicky.  The Hollywood history peppered throughout by a narrator disrupts the main content that I watched this for...  and it's not always entirely accurate.  Overall, this is a curiosity at best.

7505384,5,B017HMM38U,History is always left to recollection and interpretation.  The premise of this delightful film is rock-solid fact; the actual voices of two icons of American film recorded during their first and only meeting.  That the production has so carefully and beautifully recreated the physical experience is the magic of film-making. Great performances all around and a huge hat tip to the source of all this wonder; Wes Wheadon the man who facilitated the audio recording back in the day and who has now made the experience come to life for us. Thank you Wes.,1451865600,,553,4.872340425531915

I encourage all women to watch this film and reflect on Bette and Mae.  They will help you to become Subjects of your own lives, as they were of theirs - unique for most women, still, but especially for women of that generation.  Remarkable, so take note!",1451779200,,385,4.550724637681159
7505389,5,B017HMM38U,"witnessing a private meeting between two of classic Hollywood's greatest icons in their waning years, dishing out their views on their experiences and careers. An uncensored, not-to-be-missed re-creation of a momentous evening nobody knew anything about until the audio recording the event was revealed. The actors lip-syncing couldn't have done better jobs, both are completely natural. It would have been easy to go over the top and do these often-imitated ladies as caricatures, but it's all masterfully restrained and believable. Because of the age (and at times less than ideal quality) of the audio recording, it's recommended to watch with captions to catch all of what's being said. Karen Teliha is particularly impressive as Davis.",1451779200,5,740,5.443478260869565

7505391,5,B017HMM38U,"""When Bet Met Mae"" is a very particular film on the historical value of the first, and possibly the only meeting of Mae West and Betty Davis. If the recorded conversation had been lost, it would have been a major loss, but thankfully it was saved and given life. Two icons of the film industry and their first meeting. These great ladies expressed their feeling in dealing with leaders of their profession and did they express what they felt without reserve.",1451692800,5,458,4.666666666666667
7505392,5,B017HMM38U,Most inventive movie we've seen in a long time. You have to keep reminding yourself that the dialog you are hearing is actually Bette and Mae at that party so long ago.  It's their voices.  What a great idea.,1451692800,3,208,4.3076923076923075
7505393,5,B017HMM38U,"I do impressions of both these legends so this was Heavenly.  The fact this movie was ever made is a miracle.  To hold on to the audio of that historic night is incredible.

I didn't know Mae West was alive when I was little but I had heard about Bette Davis on the news little bit when I was a teenager.  I saw Bette Davis played a hotel owner on TV show, ""Hotel"".  She looked pretty in ""Hotel"" but she was in her fragile health.",1529712000,,390,4.361111111111111
8739309,5,B017HMM38U,"A labor of love and a true joy to watch. The actresses portraying Ms. Davis and Ms. West are spot on. The dialogue is candid and funny, and the overall feeling of the film is one of a tender, raucous reverie of two giants of the silver screen.

Sally Kellerman narrates and there are clips of their films, pics, and footage of various drag queens that have portrayed them.

There are no special features and the run time is not quite 65 minutes. It's a very good film and so interesting to watch. West was a smart woman, as was Davis who us in awe of the 80 year old West who looks fantastic. Davis talks about her husbands, her daughter BD, and even Joan Crawford!",1516665600,,619,4.373913043478261
