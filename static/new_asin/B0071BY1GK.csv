5047228,2,B0071BY1GK,"I think Amy is inteesting enough and th interview footage of her family / friends would be the best way to tell her story.  I was unhappy of the lack of real video and that it was a ""made for TV movie""She was such a sensation she must have been the youngest to have a movie less than two years AD to have a film about her what a waste for everyone who was fooled by the look alike.",1357430400,,381,3.8227848101265822
5047229,4,B0071BY1GK,"This movie (I'm a film-critic) is actually quite well constructed, with a decent script and editing!  The actress does fairly well representing Amy, and several new discoveries about Amy's private life are unveiled.  I'm surprised that more reviwers aren't positve about this very worthwhile investment!",1345507200,2,303,5.711111111111111
5047230,1,B0071BY1GK,"THIS IS A WASTE OF $$$
all they did was get a girl who looks nothing like Amy , put makeup on her the way amy wore her makeup and she sits on a sofa
and basically repeats every written article that Amy had been quoted from. Nothing new, terrible actors play flashback scenes( there are probaly just 3 in there) .. I wish i could get my money back..

Anybody wants my copy before i throw it in the garbage?
I could have wasted 20 bucks in a much better way..",1336003200,11,457,3.967391304347826

8508166,1,B0071BY1GK,It's a dud. The actress was far from Amy. No charisma. Not believable,1441843200,,69,4.384615384615385

8508168,1,B0071BY1GK,"This was a HUGE WASTE OF MONEY. It was just some random actress who looks nothing like Amy Winehouse, with really bad makeup. The only reason this has one star is because you can't write a review without one. Lame.",1414281600,,214,4.375
8508169,3,B0071BY1GK,"Ok, as a fan of Amy this actress didn't portray her that well. It was mostly her just talking about things Amy would say that you can actually find on the net watching her interviews.  I would have enjoyed some singing on the video since that is what Amy did for a career.",1407283200,2,272,4.132075471698113
