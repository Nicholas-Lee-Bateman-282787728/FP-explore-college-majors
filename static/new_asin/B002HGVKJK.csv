3929322,4,B002HGVKJK,"This movie is wild and weird as the title implies. If you collect Shaw Brothers and Don't have it you just might want to purchase this DVD. . This movie is not for everyone as the techniques get lost in the movies outdated special effects. This reminds me of two other crazy Shaw Brother movies Nine Demons and Fight Among the Supers. However, it's just a bad as Heaven and Hell aka Shaolin Hell Gate (1978). These movies were all poorly done but if you like corny and honor togethers these types of movies ""might"" for you.",1424217600,,523,4.402061855670103
3929323,5,B002HGVKJK,My favorite Shaw Brothers movie. The movie looks really great restored. Hope someone will release the English Dub DVD someday. Saw the English Dubbed Movie on The El Rey Network. This one is English subtitled. It's a strange movie but i dig it.,1423094400,3,244,4.6976744186046515

8370344,1,B002HGVKJK,"sucked horribly......enough said.....dynasty warrior tale of  Sun Ce,,,,,,the creators were definitely mixing opium and LSD when they made this one.....great idea,bad movie,,,,,,one day they will get this right....just not this time",1506729600,,232,6.483870967741935
8370345,2,B002HGVKJK,Hard to comprehend film about a taoist priest who gets killed by a local lord and returns as a spirit to haunt him. It's hard to view the priest as heroic because he is out for pure revenge and leaves a pretty big body count during his supernatural antics. The intrigue of the early film is replaced by long scenes of the spirit capering around possessing people left and right in order to lead the film to its (not so happy) ending. You're better off seeing Shaolin Drunkard if you want madcap Taoist magic.,1490140800,,508,4.414893617021277
8370346,4,B002HGVKJK,Cool retro Kung Fu classic movie!!!  Smart move by Amazon to offer these Kung Fu classics. Millions of people enjoy these so i'm pretty they'll score a home run offering these jems on Prime..,1485388800,,191,4.617647058823529
8370347,3,B002HGVKJK,Not a bad movie.  Certain elements of it had no explanation but that's probably because I missed it.,1484006400,,100,4.555555555555555
8370348,5,B002HGVKJK,Wierd and great Kung-fu.,1481846400,,24,5.25
8370349,5,B002HGVKJK,"Gorgeous picture & sound. Subtitle quality is fine but nothing special. This is not some cheap film transfer digitized for streaming

If you're a fan of Cheh Chang films- this hits all the marks. Oiled Men in outrageous outfits & constant costume changes.

Much better than other Shaw Films from the 80's, ""Weird Man"" starts slow- and builds to an amazing fun climax.",1480464000,2,367,4.809523809523809

8370352,4,B002HGVKJK,"Not exactly that weird, our main character has the ability to escape into the spirit world, but doesn't have to stay there. Not as weird as some of the later Shaw Brothers' classics.",1473724800,,182,4.545454545454546
