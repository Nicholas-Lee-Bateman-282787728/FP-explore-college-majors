5893383,5,B00E6F1522,Bryan Ferry is at his best in this DVD! EVERY song is GREAT! Good quality dvd ! For those who have never heard of him I urge you to buy!,1384041600,,136,3.566666666666667
5893384,5,B00E6F1522,This blu ray is so good it really makes me upset I did not see the tour when it was in Oakland. Bryan Ferry is so timeless. Great video and audio. This is a must have.,1383868800,,167,3.6666666666666665
5893385,5,B00E6F1522,"What can I say as a 30 year long fan? Bryan is mixed front and center in the 5.1 mix. He may be older and the voice doesn't have the range from years ago, but it's his character that continues to please. Some singers don't age so well. He is working it quite well with his vocal range. Compared to the Roxy Music Apollo concert from 2002 it is a bit more subdued affair but great for evening / wintertime viewing in my opinion. It's nice to see a lot of his more recent work here too. At this point why release a greatest hits video again.  It's much more interesting to include music that shows ""where he's at"" at the time of the concert, rather than rehashing everything older. I can safely say if you are a fan, you will enjoy this.",1383523200,4,735,4.13986013986014

5893387,5,B00E6F1522,Like a good old  wine Bryan Ferry is becoming better and better as a performer. Songs were very well chosen and positioning of the band on stage is fantastic. Good to see and hear old and young talented musicians together delivering a perfect sound.,1382918400,12,249,4.659090909090909
5893388,5,B00E6F1522,"This video is what a great concert video should look and sound like. I've been a fan of Roxy Music and Bryan Ferry for a very long time, but never had a chance to see either one live. This video gives me a glimpse of what I've missed.",1382745600,5,234,3.8958333333333335
5893389,5,B00E6F1522,"I've been a Ferry fan for decades (it would be indiscreet to say how many) and it's exciting to see him bring an entire lifetime of experience and performance to the catalogue; this gorgeous concert ranges from the first Roxy release to the very latest work. I'm also pleased with how much Bryan plays piano on this release- Colin Good is a virtuoso, and I like his function as music director, but no one plays Ferry like Ferry himself.

Bryan in his 60s is my favorite Bryan Ferry ever- and I can't wait to see what he does next.",1382140800,8,530,4.353535353535354
5893390,5,B00E6F1522,The sounds quality on this Bluray disk is amazing. I only wish a few more of my favorite Ferry/Roxy Music songs had been in this concert.,1382140800,,137,4.3076923076923075
5893391,5,B00E6F1522,"For Bryan Ferry fans or anyone that appreciates blu ray music variety... Do add this to your collection.
Picture Perfect and Audio to boot... Not all titles under blu ray can claim this by definition.",1380758400,16,200,4.742857142857143
5893392,4,B00E6F1522,"it's hard to believe he's doing his best work this late in the game but Bryan Ferry pulls it off, i could watch this forever. I could do without the dancers or the saxophone playing bird who always seems to be taking her curtain call but otherwise, first rate. I noticed the tempo of some of the old numbers like ""Bride Stripped Bare"" seemed to be speeded up from the original and it was odd to hear him singing his own backup vocals from time to time but as i said, this is a true master doing his very best work.",1380326400,18,514,4.099009900990099

5893428,5,B00E6F1522,"Forget the age thing - that's just a cliche. Ferry's great and so is everyone else on the stage. In fact, buy this Blu-Ray even if you don't like Bryan Ferry. Doesn't matter. Whomever recorded and mastered this thing knew what they were doing. In 7.1, the rear channels clearly represent the mikes at the back of the hall and reproduce a spatial environment I've heard on very few other Blue-Ray concert discs. It's recorded well, it's shot well, it's produced well. You won't be disappointed... that is until it ends.

I'd give this 6 stars if I could, It's porn for the ears.",1457136000,5,577,4.548076923076923
5893429,4,B00E6F1522,Great  Concert. Product arrived on time so good service. Would have been nice to be able to just buy the CD and not have to buy the Blu Ray as I do not have a Blu Ray player.,1456185600,,174,3.5789473684210527
5893430,4,B00E6F1522,"It's good but not great. If you're a Roxy Music fan then you won't be disappointed. If you're familiar with their live material from years ago.(Viva Live)you can tell how much Ferry's voice has changed. Not trying to be disrespectful to Mr. Ferry but songs like ""If there is Something"" has really lost energy. I realize this may not be entirely fair. We're talking about 40 years ago but the difference is striking. -Empoweryou",1443225600,2,427,4.783783783783784

5893438,5,B00E6F1522,"I love this.  I've watched it about six times in three days - a real keeper.  Classic Bryan Ferry with his interesting king of the lounge lizzards twist.  This has excellent shelf value for a collection to be viewed again and again.  It was interesting to me how it built.  By the end, I have to admit I was surprised how well he could still rock it at 60+  - still with that same sultry voice and charisma.  Really, really excellent item for any Bryan Ferry or Roxy Music fan's collection.  This was the best I've purchasaed in a long time.  Really enjoyed it.",1427760000,2,561,4.3173076923076925

5893454,5,B00E6F1522,"Great picture, amazing audio!  I was lucky enough to see Bryan Ferry on his 'Bte Noir' tour, while that show IMO had a better selection of songs, (basically the entire 'Boys and Girls' and 'Bte Noir' albums with a good dose of Roxy thrown in), this show is no slouch.  His shows remind me a lot of a carnival, in that there is always something going on.  Different musicians taking solos, dancers, Ferry,himself switching from vocals to piano and other keyboards, and more.  Ferry just reeks of 'cool'.  The way he dresses and carries himself is nothing but class.  Every guy wants to be him, every girl wants him.  Yes, this is a very entertaining blu-ray.",1406764800,7,657,4.612068965517241

5893456,5,B00E6F1522,"Great show, great musical performances, good quality sound, a must for any Bryan Ferry fan.  No, his voice is not quite what it used to be, but in many ways the years have aged him like fine wine.  Only complaint is one I have about many music videos, too much rapid jumping between camera angles, which becomes irritating and distracting to me after a while.  Fortunately it does not ruin the show.",1404691200,2,399,4.513888888888889

5893459,5,B00E6F1522,I bought this dvd based on seeing him perform live at the Nokia Theater in L.A. earlier this year. Although the song set is slightly different this performance still captures the same energy and atmosphere from the show i saw.

5893461,5,B00E6F1522,"If you are a Roxy Music fan this is a must have for your collection. I love going back and forth listening to the hard to find ""Roxy Music Live at the Apollo"" recorded in 2001 and this show recorded in 20013.  Yes the band is different but it keeps the music fresh when you alternate the two shows.  And the dancers WOW, way fun!",1398556800,,329,4.046153846153846

5893464,5,B00E6F1522,"I agree with all the positive reviews; the disagreeable one or two are your bargain basement snark.  Don't bother.

What interests me in this selection of songs is the breadth:  iI goes back to the first Roxy and includes the latest, Olympia.  This is a masterful song selection, including covers of Dylan (obviously) but also Neil Young and John Lennon and Sam and Dave.  You get a total sense of the man as an artist who has surveyed decades of music, integrated all them within his repertoire of resources, and approaches everything with both respect and real enthusiasm.  Of the originals, he harkens back to a surprising number from some disputed classic albums, like Bride Stripped Bare and Flesh + Blood.  Both were fine records, dismissed because they were departures, and critics don't like departures.  Hearing Sign of the Times reminded me of what an incredible pop song it is.  My Only Love is so breathtakingly spare and heart wrenching.  From Olympia, there are three selections, one dark disco, one darker disco, and one brilliantly subtle ballad.  It's a daring mix, and it all works out superbly.

The band is far from geezer.  (I don't know what the person was thinking when the second drummer, second guitarist, sax/keyboardist are all younger than that reviewer likely is.  By the way, calling a woman a ""bird"" is pretty pathetic, since she's a great musician and it REALLY shows YOUR age, my friend.  Maybe not chronologically, but for sure in karma years.)  Ferry's voice never sounded better live, because here he dispenses with his dance steps and focuses on the notes, and if you watch, he's actually singing them.  Unlike all the newer synth driven oil-on-velvet bands, who are only looking for five note hooks, with giant manly choirs, that can be adapted to TV commercials.

I'm right about this.  Listen to KROQ, listen to TV commercials.  Same riffs.  Real musicians like Ferry are few and far between.  I'm a fan, but this DVD...it was a kick way up in my appreciation.  I think he's nailed it.  Covering his hybrid of Lou's ""What Goes On,"" which incorporates other Lou songs of the period, is over the top.  It was years earlier; it rocks with more authority now.

Ferry rightly deserves his place as an innovator, superior musician and singer,  and a man of uncompromising artistic integrity.  This video is both nostalgic and brand new.  That's the deal in the end, for a great musical provocateur, and NOT just a good commercial slice of velvet.  You can watch this, but listen to it first and foremost.  Best Ferry album ever.",1394928000,10,2562,4.807339449541284

5893468,5,B00E6F1522,"This is a great concert from Bryan Ferry with some surprises at the end of the show. By surprises I mean wonderful renditions of rock classics like Sam and Dave's Hold On and Hendrix' All along the Watchtower. Bryan's band is tight with great guitar work. Looking beyond the cheesy Vegas style dancers, this is a must have blu ray for all Bryan Ferry fans. Video is spot on with no jumpy camera work.

5893471,2,B00E6F1522,"I saw Ferry with Roxy Music twice, and once on his own with Chris Spedding. Back then, the irony of a fading pop star being portrayed by a young stud was wonderfully ironic, but at this  point he is a self fulfilled prophecy. The voice is ok, but the band of old rockers just goes through the motions. The bimbo eye-candy dancers are a bit creepy concerning Ferry's age, and while the female sax player is as good as McKay, his eye makeup was better. Get an old youtube video of vintage 70s Roxy, and you'll be better off.",1384128000,4,522,4.2727272727272725

Bryan and his band put on a fantastic performance. Between his own hits and some Roxy music songs along with a few old classic covers, everyone of them is performed flawlessly. The band is so tight and talented especially the young kid he has playing lead guitar. The sound is stunning in either 5.1 or stereo. If you get a chance to listen to it on a real good headphone system, you will be blown away! This concert was .played at an outdoor venue in a pouring rain. To show how good it really was, not one person left their seat throughout the whole show. That is saying something folks.
