7953656,1,B00005TNFO,"I wouldn't rate this as ""very good"" or even ""good"" condition.  Filthy dirty.  Have to clean it before I will touch it again.  I just hope the DVD isn't in as bad of shape as the box. Looks like it has some damage.",1484784000,,213,3.9069767441860463

7953658,5,B00005TNFO,"This has become a favorite of mine to watch while I walk on the treadmill. I love the wildlife and landscaping, watching Yellowstone go through the seasons. It has a nice classical soundtrack and tons of beautiful and fun to watch scenery. I recommend this to anyone who has gone to Yellowstone or wants to see some of its beauty.",1354320000,,330,4.516666666666667
7953659,5,B00005TNFO,"THIS DVD WAS EVEN MORE THAN ADVERTISED. IT IS A WONDERFUL TOUR OF YELLOWSTONE WITH ALL THE SIGHT AND SOUNDS. HOWEVER, NOT LIKE A TOUR GUIDE OR TOO COMMERCIALIZED.  IT SHOWS ALL 4 SEASONS AND REALLY MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE THERE. BOUGHT FOR SOMEONE THAT IS DYING OF CANCER WHO HAS ALWAYS WANTED TO GO THERE. IT IS JUST NOT POSSIBLE NOW, BUT HE THOROUGHLY ENJOYED IT.",1299801600,2,369,4.3478260869565215
7953660,5,B00005TNFO,"Really enjoyed the program.  I will have to schedule another trip to Yosemite.  I sent a copy of his to some friends in Taiwan, they are now planning a trip there.",1194652800,,163,4.225806451612903
7953661,2,B00005TNFO,"I was hoping for a documentary with some commentary, but it was just all music.  YAWN!!!!!  I do have to admit, however, that the scenery shots were excellent.  I prefer documentaries with commentary so I know what I'm looking at.  Yellowstone is such a dynamic place, close to my home, and I wanted a DVD that enhanced my experiences with it.  This one just didn't do it.",1194566400,6,372,4.492537313432836
7953662,2,B00005TNFO,"I just got this DVD and have seen it twice.  It is apparent that there was not a lot of thought put into this composition.  The first 5 minutes were a real turn-off, which included a couple of time-lapsed scenes and reindeer wading to the tune of Greensleeves, followed by Bison grazing, not a congenial marriage of music and imagery.  Then there was a reindeer jousting with a nearby tree.  Not a great opening and I don't know too much Classical music that was ever inspired by Nature.  I thought I recognized excerpts from The Theme from Exodus.

I would have chosen some Authentic Native American Music since it is spiritual in nature and inspired by nature.  The scenes that had no music were the best and it would have been better if they had actually made the entire video with natural sound. Nature doesn't really need any help from us in enhancing her beauty.  My first impression was that I had made a mistake and wasted $20.  I've never been to Yellowstone National Park and I'm thinking there has to be more to it than what was shown here, although many of the scenes were spectacular, particularly the snow scenes.

I guess the purpose of the presentation, whether it be for relaxation or to just give the viewer an idea of what the park is like, makes a difference.  If you are looking for something to really relax to, I don't think you would be happy with this DVD, as I had to keep the volume down, except during the parts that were natural sound.  If you are looking for something with narration, that tells you about the park, I'd suggest something else like the one done by PBS.

I personally think this DVD is over-priced.",1126310400,10,1643,4.491582491582491
7953663,4,B00005TNFO,"I have seen a better video about Yellow Stone, which tells a well organized story of an otter family. It goes from one spot to another, from spring to winter. The scenery is awesome, music soothing, and the dialogue interesting and informative. I would have given 5 stars if I haven't seen the better one.",1092528000,3,305,4.5636363636363635
7953664,5,B00005TNFO,"There is no diologue on this dvd only natural sounds and music. So if your looking for narration this is not the dvd for you, but if you want to relax, watch, listen, remember or just see what it looks like this is the one to get. I must say this was all I expected of the video, however, my expectations were exceeded. To hear the elk call, the geysers blow, the mountain scenes, the rivers matched perfectly with soothing music. The production of this DVD is top notch and well thought out and gives a good overall view of Yellowstone as well as Grand Teton National Park. For those that have been to the Yellowstone National Park and or Grand Teton National Park get ready for a mental trip when you walked Americas Oldest National Park. Those that have not been you will want to go when this is over so pack your bags, thats how good this DVD on Yellowstone is in my opinion. All thats needed of this video are the different scents that make Yellowstone, Yellowstone...",1017964800,51,973,4.411111111111111
