8402392,3,B003QP2TVE,"Set arrived poorly packaged for shipping, 2 discs cases were cracked badly. Fortunately discs were ok. Now the show has tons of great female comedians, yet the show is more of a drama. This is not what previews on other comedy discs made it out to be, this is no ab fab or vicar of dibley comedy. The show is good but just be prepared.",1434758400,,335,4.1692307692307695

8402394,5,B003QP2TVE,"This is one of those wonderful character-driven British comedies which eschew fast-paced action in favor of excellent performances and dry humor. Not that that means there aren't some great moments of inspired silliness, but every time you watch you will catch ever more nuance. Sue Johnston (Waking the Dead) is the sole voice of sanity among a group of folks who are, to say the least, eccentric. Make sure you pay attention to the throw-away lines of Jennifer Saunders' wealthy ""county"" mother as she trashes the rich and famous. Highly recommended, to be watched over and over.",1368144000,5,581,5.0
