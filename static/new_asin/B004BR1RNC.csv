8422192,5,B004BR1RNC,"I am a big fan of Sensei Tony and loved this hip and insightful look at the relationship between sex and spirituality. From the humerous cover (apparently an homage to a Pete Townshend album!) to real life examples he gives from his decades of counseling, this is a real gift for those who are looking for a compassionate and clear understanding of sex and its place in our lives. A real compliment to his Playboy radio shows.",1341360000,,426,4.545454545454546
