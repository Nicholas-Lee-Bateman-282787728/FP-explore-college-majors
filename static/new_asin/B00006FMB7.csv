1749388,5,B00006FMB7,"I have found both Sara's DVDs useful and fun.  I will not repeat information from other reviewers that I agree with, but I will offer a few tips to those who have a concern over the length of time and ""patter"" in this series (Beyond Basic and Basic).  These tips will work for both DVDs.
If you have gone through the daily dozen with Sara several times and know everything she's going to say, do one of the following...
1. Mute Sara and just watch her do the poses with you while you put on a calming CD.  You'll still feel like she's there with you and she'll keep you moving from one pose to another.
2. Don't use the DVD at all, but put the daily dozen list in front of you and just follow it at your own pace.  (Also listening to some calming music.)  You can increase or decrease the amount of breaths you take in each pose to modify your session.  We do this a lot.
3. Do the intermediate session on the Basic DVD or the meditation on the Beyond Basics.  Those 2 rotated make a great session on their own!
When you want a refresher course on how the poses should look and feel, just turn Sara back on and review with her.
Don't be scared off by other reviewers' comments!  I've been using this series for a year now, and it's the one I'm happiest with!  This new DVD is a great companion for the first.
Namaste.",1041897600,72,1317,4.153543307086614
1749389,4,B00006FMB7,"I have started doing Bikram's yoga for a month and a half and was looking for a supplementary program which I can do at home when I am not going to class.  After going through almost every yoga video available at Amazon[.com], I chose this one by Sara Ivanhoe.
I like her style.  Her instructions are clear, and her tone is encouraging and soothing.  However, perhaps Bikram's program is  more fast-paced, I generally find her pace too slow.  Her instructions become long-winded after you have done the program several times.  I wonder if she can do a video for the more experienced.",1038873600,2,583,4.666666666666667
1749390,5,B00006FMB7,"I bought this video at a another store, because I have been doing yoga for almost a year now, and I didn't want to do the same boring stuff you see on the beginner videos. I thought this one was pretty good, it told you some key points about yoga while you are doing the streatches, and also if you can't do some of the poses they still give you a simple way of doing the practice. The next day my abs were a little sore, which means that this video does work (don't worry it wasn't a kind of pain that you have to stay in bed for, just a little bit of pain ^_^). I recomend this video to anyone who wants another stage up from a Beginners level.",1036972800,,646,3.9389312977099236
1749391,5,B00006FMB7,"Big fan of Sara Ivanhoe here.  Her instructional style is pleasant without being patronizing; she looks like she's really enjoying herself and manages to convey the feeling that she is in the room with you.  Her instruction creates a very clear picture of what the body is supposed to be doing/feeling/aiming for at any time.
I found it to be not only a great sequel to Basic Yoga for Dummies, but an excellent companion to her two Crunch workouts--many of the poses introduced in the Crunch series are explored in more depth here, which made both the Fat-Burning and the Joy Of Yoga workouts become clearer.
Once I understood the poses I wished that there were an option to run through them with fewer preliminaries, but I like the DVD so much anyway that I had to give it five stars.  I'll be working with this one for awhile--there's plenty of room to grow with this workout.",1034035200,15,878,4.579617834394904
1749437,5,B00006FMB7,"This video is the easiest to follow of all the yoga videos I have seen. I checked several out of our local library. After I found this one by Sara Ivanhoe, I just kept checking it out. I finally bought my own. Sara covers all of the best known yoga postures and includes modifications of many of the poses that make it easier to work at your own level. After you work with her for awhile and become very familiar with the routine you may mute the sound and do the routine with a yoga music CD, which I find very pleasant.",1381104000,,521,4.117647058823529
1749438,5,B00006FMB7,The goods were received on time and in good order.  My thanks to the vendor for such good service.  I thought I would never find a new version of this DVD so I feel lucky to have found it!,1364083200,,188,3.7948717948717947
1749439,5,B00006FMB7,Good slow introduction to yoga that teaches you poses you can use on your own later. I had it for years on VHS and just purchased it on DVD,1361491200,,139,3.8275862068965516
1749440,5,B00006FMB7,"It is a very good video. I also have the basic yoga for dummies. This ""beyond"" is a couple of steps up from the first one.  I believe a beginner can get a lot out of this video. With one of the postures, I vary it to make it a little less strenuous, you know to work my way up to it. But Ivanhoe is really a good instructor. I enjoy it very much, that I even do some of these exercises before going to bed.  I also like the music in the background. They may not really matter to some. But I love music and I'm glad it is different from the first one.

I recommend this video.",1358899200,,575,3.8151260504201683
1749441,4,B00006FMB7,"I like this yoga DVD because it is simple and straight forward, and I like that it does not include a lot of spirituality in it.",1357430400,,128,3.9615384615384617
1749442,5,B00006FMB7,Sarah is so genuine and lovely. She is a skilled instructor and gives very good instructions. I do always wish there would be a second lesson without the instructions- but I stiil enjoy this very much and feel I have had a good workout.,1356134400,,236,4.386363636363637
1749443,5,B00006FMB7,A hard to find DVD. It was used and had no problems  using it. I had just begun yoga and had seen portions on this video on You Tube.  I wanted the DVD.,1351382400,,152,3.5757575757575757
1749444,4,B00006FMB7,"This video would be a five-star if not for all the extraneous blah, blah, blah.  I enjoyed Sarah's instruction and easy manner, but the side-bar commentaries were a distraction.  Rodney Yee is another yogi well worth your consideration.",1298678400,,236,5.184210526315789
1749445,5,B00006FMB7,"Thanks, for the quick service. Even tho, I had to wait for several items to come in, for you to, send them altogether, & give me the cheapest S/H rate, it still was quick
service.

Also, I really like all of the Yoga for Dummies DVD's that I've seen thus far.  I'd recommend them to beginners, & intermediates.  They are enough diversified, to
challenge one.",1297728000,,358,4.476923076923077
1749446,5,B00006FMB7,Sara Ivanhoe teaches the very important essential of Yoga. Drawing the tailbone down torward the floor then protect your spine.,1246147200,,127,5.4
1749477,5,B00006FMB7,This is a great yoga workout for advanced beginners and for intermediates.  Sara Ivanhoe gives clear directions and makes the workout fun even with repeated viewings.,1228089600,,166,5.384615384615385
1749478,4,B00006FMB7,"This is a good DVD if you have NEVER EVER done Yoga before.  It is very basic but informative.  If you have basic knowledge of yoga, I would go for the intermediated dvd.  But, like I said, if you have no knowledge whatsoever, this is a great dvd.",1206921600,3,247,4.104166666666667
1749479,2,B00006FMB7,"I love Sara Ivanhoe and own some and have rented some of her other dvd's.  I was real excited to get this dvd and learn some new great poses.  I have just started doing Yoga and I already knew 11 of the 12 poses.  I can not believe that I already knew them because they are such simple ones and this is ""beyond basic"".  It is very clear and it is nice that is shows you what you could be doing wrong but I assumed I would learn the new poses in a flowing sequence.  You just learn them and then hold them for 6 breaths and it's over.  It is very easy to do and you could probably skip the first one.  Her Crunch dvd's and 20 min workouts are better.  I love the 20 min workouts.",1192492800,3,678,3.86231884057971
1749480,5,B00006FMB7,"Sara Ivanhoe's nurturing teaching style makes her workouts perfect for beginners, but even if you are intermediate, she still knows how to present challenging postures in a way that makes you  want to try them. This workout begins with a series of stretches to warm up the upper body, but you may want to walk for 20-30 minutes or do some aerobics to warm up the muscles. I found that without the walking or biking, I was not as flexible.

""The Daily Dozen"" exercises are a little more challenging than the first DVD and I was actually surprised at two of the exercises because they almost seemed advanced. It was more the length of time you are required to hold the posture that seems to make them go beyond intermediate. Upward Dog is surprisingly challenging when held for six breaths. Normally I've tried this in a vinyasa style workout with flowing postures. When you take each posture and focus your attention for six breaths, this becomes a test of patience and endurance. The postures include:

Chair

Warrior

Triangle

Wide Leg Standing Forward Bend

Low Lunge Twist

Upward Facing Dog

Dolphin

Cow - I had never seen this exercise before! Total challenge!

Wide Leg Seated Forward Bend

Reclined Butterfly

Supine Twist

Final Relaxation

I really loved ""Dolphin"" which is like Downward dog with your arms bent and your head almost on the floor. It tests your upper body strength and balance, but feels great once you are done with the breathing exercises. Each posture presents a physical and psychological challenge which makes them even more fun.

""Cow"" felt very much like an advanced exercise, mostly because of the flexibility required to even get into the posture. I literally sat there laughing when I realized there was no way my legs would ""pretzel"" the way the exercise required. So, you may just want to adapt that one for beginner/intermediate and it still seems to have the desired effect. Beginners will find some of the exercises to be more intermediate, and intermediate practitioners may find this workout great for developing patience.

For some reason, which I can't explain, Sara Ivanhoe's workouts leave me feeling more centered, balanced and generally happy and peaceful. It is as if the world spins a little more smoothly after the workout. A meditation session is also offered and Sara Ivanhoe teaches you a new mudra. I can also highly recommend her Candlelight Yoga workout and all of her 20-minute Makeovers.

1749481,3,B00006FMB7,"I bought the First DVD, Yoga for Dummies.  It was great because it had a section where she showed you each pose and then she actually gave you a full routine that you could practice to.  This DVD only gives the instructional part but there is no routine to follow.  And I agree with the other reviews...the pop-ups are beyond annoying.  I do not think these existed on the first DVD and I am not quite sure why they were added.  I like Candle Light Yoga and Crunch Fat Burning with Sara but I would not recommend this DVD due to the fact that it is basically instructional with no practice routine to go with the instructional.",1087084800,25,627,4.3247863247863245
1749482,3,B00006FMB7,"I received this as a gift from someone that chose it for the familiarity of the brand, against the myriad of other yoga videos available. Like many other Dummies publications, it delivers an adequate amount of information in an easy-to-understand and unsaturated fashion. While I would have preferred a better exposition of the principles involved, Beyond Basic Yoga for Dummies provided a fairly rigourous and rewaring yoga workout that left me with an extremely calm feeling of energy upon completion. My biggest complaint is the frequent interruptions of the trademark Dummies tips as they're very distracting, especially when you're supposed to be focusing on the movement; Ironically enough, one of the tips tells you to eliminate distractions! Sarah Ivanhoe is a great instructor, but I think that her Crunch Candlelight Yoga video far surpasses this one if you're interested in a better understanding and demonstration of Yoga.",1071532800,9,934,5.360544217687075
1749483,5,B00006FMB7,"This dvd is exceptional for beginners! Before purchasing this, I had never done Yoga before. I really love Sara Ivanhoe, she has a very soothing voice and makes you feel very comfortable.  There are a lot of explanations before every pose, so if you have no idea to what you are doing, you will be perfectly fine. However, if you have some basic yoga knowledge already, this won't be the dvd for you. You will then find it very slow and boring due to all the explanations and slower pace. But, I would recommend it 100 percent for someone who has never done yoga before!!! Don't be afraid to give it a try!!",1065225600,5,607,4.371681415929204
1749484,2,B00006FMB7,"I have been praciticing yoga for about a year now. I purchased this video after about 4 months of practice and was completely bored. I couldn't even get past the first couple of segments. I found the pace slow.  The first video that I bought was Crunch: Fat Burning Yoga, I loved it! I found it easy to follow and just the right amount of challenge, so I looked for other videos by Sara Ivanhoe. I purchase this and was very disapointed. For anyone with any prior yoga experience I would not recomend this, however if you are unsure of the proper way to do poses, this could be very helpful.",1055721600,11,591,4.324324324324325
1749485,5,B00006FMB7,"Just when I was getting bored with the routine from ""Basic Yoga Workout for Dummies"", they decided to come out with a sequel with the same instructor (the always wonderful Sara Ivanhoe) but with a more challenging workout.  I had been doing the old routine for about 10 months when I decided to step things up a bit and buy the sequel.  This video is a fitting follow-up to the first.  While the first routine introduced you to yoga and got you used to practicing it on a regular basis, the second video really gets you into it and presents a good workout for the body.  You will be surprised at how fit this yoga workout will make you feel.  I've been doing the workout for 6 months now, and I'm more toned and muscular, and I've even lost some weight!  (Never meant to, though, it just happened...)  When I noticed that my clothes didn't fit as snuggly as they used to, and I had to buy smaller rings, I knew the yoga was working!
Like the first video, the instructor goes through each pose step-by-step to make sure you are doing it properly.  If you're a veteran of the first video, you'll have no problem learning the new routine.  But even if this is your first time, you will have no problem learning and doing the poses since the instructor makes yoga so accessible for everyone.  And the good thing about the video is that you can watch it a few times, memorize the routine, and then do it on your own after that.
With this video, who needs to spend money on expensive yoga classes at the gym?  You'll get a great workout at a great price.",1049673600,26,1548,4.321799307958478
1749486,5,B00006FMB7,"Sara Ivanhoe presents another good, effective yoga workout.  This one is only a slight bit tougher than the first Dummies video but it is worth having.  It seems to be assumed that the viewer has been doing the first video faithfully and has developed more flexibility and balance.  It uses both quite a bit more than the first video did.  It is a good workout and Sara Ivanhoe talks you through it like in the first one.
This video is a great addition to any yoga video library!",1043193600,4,479,4.409090909090909

7967869,4,B00006FMB7,"I use this yoga DVD intermittently, to supplement my weekly yoga class and provide some variety to my at-home exercising.  It does a really good job explaining each yoga position and also warns you about common position errors that could result in injury.  It is also easily adaptable for many levels of experience and flexibility, though not really for the physically-challenged person or the very beginner (that's what the ""Basic Yoga"" DVD is for).  The DVD moves slowly, holding each position for about 6 long breaths, making it what I believed is called Hatha-style yoga, rather than Vinyasa-style (flowing) yoga.  It will help improve your balance, strength, and flexibility.  The DVD covers 12 fairly challenging postures.",1383868800,,728,5.241379310344827
