7126074,5,B00W85FDD4,"What an excellent, thoughtful movie.  One of my favorite films of 2015 so far, along with Clouds of Sils Maria, Inside Out, and Ex Machina.",1438560000,,139,4.56
7126075,4,B00W85FDD4,"There was a brief opening text of the locality and year of this conflict, but little to nothing about the ethnic parties involved and the personal histories of individuals we see in the film as well as a general background into the reasons for the conflict. It seems as if we have Russians, Abkhazians, Georgians, Estonians, Chechens (also calling themselves Caucasians, I think) involved. How Estonia comes to be a home base for extended families living in Georgia is not explained as it is as far from there as are China, India, France and Somalia.
The story revolves around two Estonian farmers (tangerine farmers) who are staying put until the last harvest is in while their Estonian neighbors have left for Estonia and as the conflict escalates. A wounded Georgian and a Chechen end up recovering in the farmhouse. The rest of the film centers on mediation (by the Estonian) of the hate between Georgian & Chechen as well as, a perhaps, a shared understanding, but 
An aside: Perhaps American politicians can learn a lesson from this film and spend less time coming up with reasons to hate differences, and more in understanding the roots and unique values in differences between people.",1437436800,2,1192,4.900990099009901

7126078,4,B00W85FDD4,"Georgian director Zaza Urushadze's Tangerines (a co production with Estonia) works best as a quiet, humanistic antiwar film. Whatever one might think about the Soviet Union, its collapse in 1991 created a lot of human suffering and conflict. One of these conflicts was the Abkhazian war of 1992, between the newly independent Georgia and the breakaway Republic of Abkhazia (which is not recognized as a sovereign nation by the international community).

Ivo (Lembit Ufsak) is an elderly Estonian carpenter living in a isolated house in Abkhazia. Most Estonians living there have left the place, but Ivo has stayed building wooden cases for the tangerine crop of his Estonian neighbor farmer Margus (Elmo Nganen). But the war reaches their immediate surroundings when a gunfight occurs between Georgians and Chechen combatants fighting for Abkhazia, that leaves three dead and two wounded. Ivo and Margus bury the dead and care for the wounded: Chechen fighter Ahmed (Giorgi Nakashidze) and the more seriously injured Georgian Nika (Mikhail Meskhi), whom Ahmed is bent on killing at first opportunity in retribution for his fallen comrades. However, Ivo has declared his house a neutral zone, and both men give their word they'll respect it. And as they convalesce, Ivo's house see a tense truce between the two soldiers.

Heavy on dialogue, Tangerines probably should have worked better as a stage play than as a film. Despite this, it is well made, though even at a running time of less than an hour and a half, it seems unnecessarily extended.",1433289600,8,1545,5.126984126984127
7126079,4,B00W85FDD4,"""Tangerines"" (2013 release from Estonia; 87 min.) brings the story of a conflict being played out in the early 90s in the countryside of Georgia (the country not the state), involving Georgians, Chechens, and Estonians who have lived in Georgia for many years. As the movie opens, the fighting is going on and we learn that many Estonian families have returned to Estonia. Not Ivo of his neighbor Margus, however. Margus is about to harvest his crop of tangerines, and Ivo builds crates to held them. Then one day, small groups of Georgians and Chechens are fighting nearby Ivo's house and as it happens, one Georgian and one Chechen survive. Ivo sees no other solution than to take them both into his house. At this point we're a good 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, despite the occasional fighting, please do not mistake this for a ""war"" or worse, an ""action"" movie. Most of the film plays out in Ivo's house and the burning question is: once they both realize what their situation is and, more importantly, who the other guy is, what will the Georgian and Chechen guys do? (No worries, I'm not going to spoil). So this movie has as much a feel of a theater play than it feels like a movie. Kudos to the (for me) no-name cast, bringing thoroughly believable performances. With this, I have now seen all 5 movies that were nominated for this year's Oscar for Best Foreign Language Movie, and I must admit that, given the strong crop of contenders, I'd probably rank ""Tangerines"" at the bottom of this group. That does NOT mean that ""Tangerines"" is not a good movie, it's just that the other 4 were even better (Poland's ""Ida"" was the deserved Oscar winner, although I wouldn't have been upset had Russia's ""Leviathan"" won the Oscar).

I saw ""Tangerines"" in early May at the Landmark Bethesda Row Cinema (in suburban Washington, DC). The matinee screening where I saw this was PACKED, somewhat to my surprise I will admit. But I think this is great news, as it proves that there is an audience out there for top-notch quality foreign movies. If you are in the mood for a tense theater play-reminding movie that examines the human side of conflicts of war, I'd readily suggest you check out ""Tangerines"", be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray.",1431302400,6,2416,4.655737704918033
7126080,5,B00W85FDD4,"""Mandariinid"" is part of the 2014 Seattle International Film Festival. It was submitted by Estonia/Georgia (English captions) and takes us to wartime Abkhazia in 1990. Written and directed by Zaza Urushadze, this award-winning drama (Urushadze won in the Mannheim-Heidelberg, Warsaw and Tallinn Film Festivals, and nominated at the Palm Springs International Film Festival) has finally gone into wide release. In it, we witness the fiercely held loathing between Chechnya and Georgia. It is partly religious (Christian vs Muslim) and partly political.

Most of the residents have returned to Estonia where their families originated decades earlier. Two fellows, Ivo and Margus, stayed behind; they are in the tangerine business: Margus raises, harvests and sells them, while Ivo builds crates for shipping. After hearing gunfire, they find one wounded mercenary from Chechnya and four dead near their gate (three Georgians and another mercenary from Chechnya). They bring the wounded man into Ivo's house, and as they bury the four combatants, one Georgian shows signs of life, so they bring him, gravely wounded, into Ivo's other bedroom.

Now our story begins. Here is the cast:
  * Mikheil Meskhi is Ivo, a hawk-faced older fellow, who never hesitates; he instantly helps others, regardless of their ""side"" in this misery.
  * Elmo N&uuml;ganen is Margus, the fellow with the tangerine orchard. He wants to make this sale so he can join his family in Estonia.
  * Giorgi Nakashidze is Ahmet, slightly wounded but eager to ""kill that scumbag in the next room!"" Ivo eventually gets him to promise not to kill Nika unless he steps outside the house.
  * Misha Meskhi is Nika, a Christian with shrapnel in his head. His hatred for Ahmet is every bit as venomous.

With war being waged in the neighborhood, these four men have to find a way to control their loathing as they heal, play checkers, cook, chop wood, and drink tea together. Slowly their prejudice seeps away even though they are unaware that it is happening.

This has shocking moments, military-type language (profane), gunfights and burial details. We come to care about each one, which is a vital element for me if I am to recommend a film. I recommend this one. Watch for it in your local art house cinema and order the DVD in July 2015.",1431216000,10,2302,5.013123359580052

7126091,5,B00W85FDD4,"This Georgian movie is perhaps one of the best anti-war movies I've seen.  Ivo and Margus are Estonian neighbors, the remaining two of an Estonian enclave that have returned to Estonia once war broke out in the region between Georgia and Abkasia.  (I read up on Estonians in Georgia and this is historically accurate; I never knew this!)

Ivo and Margus live alone but close to each other.  Margus has a tangerine orchard and the crops need picking.  But then a deadly skirmish between opposite forces take place in front of their homes.  Only one per side survives: Ahmed and Nika.  Ivo takes both wounded to his home to convalesce.  There is deep-seated hatred between both men, but Ivo demands that there will be no killing in his home.  Both wounded men agree to that, out of respect for Ivo.

The plot moves slowly, however, the mood is tense at all times.  But as the men heal they both warm up to each other and share things about their lives with Ivo. Nika the Georgian is a Christian.  Ahmed the Chechen mercenary is a Muslim. One starts to understand the reason why these men joined the war, but one also sees how the hatred btween the fighting nations is senseless.  It's even more senseless toward the end of the movie, when one learns why Ivo stayed in his home rather than return to Estonia.

Most of the movie takes place inside Ivo's home, but the closing credit landscape is beautiful, and the somber music especially adds sadness to this movie.",1508457600,4,1462,4.573076923076923

7126110,5,B00W85FDD4,"Tangerine handmade wood crate manufacturer Ivo, is an old man who now lives alone in a former Estonian immigrant dominated area of Georgia. With the only other Estonians who haven't fled the war between the Georgians and Chechnyans who both see the region as ""their country"" in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, being a doctor in another nearby town who is about to board a flight home to Estonia in a few days, and Margus the tangerine farmer who lives down the road.  Margus has some sort of social interaction difficulties and relies on Ivo to communicate for their business, and hopefully persuade local soldiers to be fruit pickers for the crop.  After an intimidating visit by some Georgian soldiers who demand to be fed, it isn't long before Ivo hears heavy gunfire around Margus' house.  Fearing for his friend's safety he runs to the scene where he finds the aftermath of a vicious battle between those Georgian soldiers and two Chechnyan  soldiers who have fired into each others vehicles.  Thankfully Margus was hiding in a tree, so they decide to bury the bodies and assist a the only survivor a Chechnyan soldier with his injuries.  However when they are looting the bodies for identification they discover a Georgian soldier is still breathing so take him back to Ivo's house as well.  This doesn't go down well with the bed ridden Chechnyan who vows he will drag himself out of bed and avenge his friend's death.  Ivo is having none of that, and eventually gains the respect from the Chechnyan  to give his word there will be no killing under his roof.  When the Georgian awakes from his coma type state he makes him promise the same.  But the two clearly do not like each other and as they recover from their injuries, will they keep their word?  Plus what of the threat of other soldiers coming for a free feed, finding out their enemy is there too?

Tangerines is a film in three languages, Estonian, Russian and Georgian with forced on screen (you can't turn them off) English subtitles. If you are after a movie with a lot of action, this isn't the film for you.  Most takes part inside Ivo's house on under some tangerine trees.  The acting is good from all involved though.  The story is a simple one, but an effective one.  We don't get a lot of backstory on any of the characters, or even why there is (or likely was, assuming this is a real town) an Estonian settlement in Georgia, which isn't a border sharing neighbour but is in fact a country as far away from Estonia with a heap of other ones in between it, as say Italy and England.  But we don't need any of those backstories to understand what is going on or to appreciate the hatred, conflict and tension going on, on the screen.  There were no extras on the region 4 DVD.

Like the tangerine fruit (a.k.a. mandarine) we may be only be tasting one of a number of segments of the whole conflict, but by consuming this piece, we get a pretty good taste for what the overall fruit was like.",1470096000,,3001,4.501845018450185

Ivo is an ethnic Estonian from an enclave of Estonians living in Abkhazia; all of them have left for Estonia due to the war except Ivo and his friend Margus. Ivo doesn't want to leave. Margus doesn't want his tangerine crop, the food he spends every day growing, to go to waste, and can't stand to leave for safety until it's harvested. Two Chechen mercenaries fighting for Abkhazia pass through the area and take food from Ivo. They encounter a group of Georgian soldiers; both groups kill each other off until only a Chechen named Ahmed and a Georgian named Nika are left, both wounded. Ivo takes them both in and tries to heal them. So he has two enemies in his house who've both killed the other's friends, and Margus is frantically trying to find men to harvest his tangerines before they get too old. Everything else flows from there. No spoilers.

Set in 1992 we meet Ivo who is an ethnic Estonian living in the Apkhezeti region of Gergia. The war has driven most of the village away but Ivo remains with his friend Margus to harvest a tangerine crop. The war soon arrives at their doorstep and Ivo and Margus are faced with two injured soldiers  one from either side. They take them both in and care for both.

The problem is that Ivo has now brought the war under his roof and he will have to deal with the consequences as best he can. Now this is one of those films that is both simple and complex. Simple in that it is dealing with the often seemly black and white situation of a conflict  you have to be on one side or the other. And it is complex in that it shows the very complex issues of grey area that arise when kindness and decent humanity are placed before all.

This is a genuinely moving film that has a great anti war message at its heart but it is also very positive in many ways. Brilliantly acted by all  Lembit Ulfsak as Ivo is particularly effective. It is also simply but effectively shot and is a testament to small budgets that can be devastatingly brilliant.

7126134,4,B00W85FDD4,"In the early 1990s, shortly after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Georgia became an independent nation.  As is often the case, things weren't hunky dory as religious and ethnic differences came to a boil.  An area in the northwest bordering the Black Sea called Apkhazeti wanted their own country.

The film deals with a pair of men originally from Estonia who had settled in a small village with their families years earlier.  Everyone in the village has returned to their native land but for the two men.  Ivo (Lembit Ulfsak) and Margus (Elmo Nuganen) raise tangerines.  Ivo builds the shipping crates and Margus harvests the fruit.  Margus is heading home after they sell the crop, but Ivo is set on remaining for reasons unclear for most of the film, so I won't spoil it here.  In the middle of the day before the tangerines are to be sold, a skirmish breaks out between a small unit of Georgian soldiers and a pair of Apkhazeti mercenaries.  One soldier from each side survives but both are severely wounded.  Ivo and Margus take them into Ivos cottage where they are treated.  As their health returns, so does the conflict which seems primarily hinged on the religious differences (Christian vs. Muslim) as well as territorial boundaries.

Ahmed (Giorgi Nakashidze) is not as badly injured as the Georgian, Niko (Misha Meskhi) and swears he will kill his enemy.  But Ivo, the peacemaker and healer, elicits a promise that no killing will take place inside his home.  When Niko recovers, he makes the same promise.  So as the two gather their strength over the couple days, they confront their differences, with sometimes hostile language and other times with humor.

The film doesnt break any new ground as far as enemies becoming closer in confinement, but it shows a poignant and careful manner of conveyance.  I liked and recommend it.",1449619200,3,1849,4.837579617834395

A real classic, the film has essentially four characters, with half a dozen others that briefly pass through.  The film takes place in 1992 during the Georgian and Abkhazian conflict.  Many Estonians lived in the area and most returned to their homeland during the war.  Two Estonian men, Ivo and Margus, remain to harvest the seasons crop of tangerines and get caught in the crossfire.  After a skirmish, Ivo nurses two wounded men, one on either side of the conflict, in his home.  A regular Gandhi, it is a pleasure to watch him handle their mutual belligerence and the tense situations when more soldiers show up.  I haven't seen a better anti-war film.",1447891200,7,744,4.72093023255814

7126144,3,B00W85FDD4,"Having just finished watching this DVD, and my fellow reviewers' comments I agree that this film is structured as a ""theatrical play"". I say this because the action takes place in a very circumscribed location: two houses by a roadside and a tangerine grove. The action takes place mostly in dialogue.

The aspect of the film missions in other review comments is that the Estonian WWII and Cold War drama is re-enacted in Abkhazia. Two warring factions act out their conflict on Estonian soil, with tragic consequences for both sides.",1442620800,2,534,4.933333333333334

I watched this film on DVD (I received an advance copy for review) and so drawn in that I thought about the characters for hours. It is a drama personal drama that takes place in the 1990s war in Georgia (former Soviet Union) and instead of major war senses the story concentrates on just four people, two soldiers and two men who are trying to make a living growing tangerines. Thats about all I want to tell you. Any more will destroy your discovery of this fine 87 minute film. I do encourage you not to read lengthy reviews which might give away too much. The plot turns and the less you know the better.

The film was nominated for an Oscar for Best Foreign Film.

It is in Estonian, Russian and Georgian with English subtitles. I will admit that the subtitles (which are in white) are smaller than most on recent foreign films and are sometimes hard to read. (You will need to sit closer to your TV screen).

There is one Bonus feature on the DVd. Its a Making of featurette that last just 5 minutes but it is basically footage of scenes being filmed (and no interviews) and really doesnt add any insight.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8712489,5,B00W85FDD4,"Some of the reviews seem to criticize the slowness of the plot.  But the slow progression was absolutely necessary--to masterfully demonstrate that how human nature takes time (i.e., slowly)--as two bitter enemies slowly and grudgingly grew to accept each other, and to naturally unveil the main character's (who initially appeared to be a quiet, no-nonsense guy) humanity and morality.

I can't imagine how this film could proceed any faster w/o compromising plausibility and the very fascinating/entertaining look into the process of how individuals come to change strongly held views.",1525737600,,587,5.584269662921348
