There are so many new sewing techniques I learned and yes I CAN MAKE IT.

8141410,2,B00004WCIM,"This video too is mostly hands pointing at a project on a table. Contrary to the claims that it is teaching you to sew, the video only shows their chosen type of top and collar. There are few sewing or construction demonstrations. The narrator refers to the different stages shown but unless you are familiar with top construction, you're going to need a reference book or the help of an experienced sewer. The portion on fitting and pattern alteration was informative but again a beginner might need more explanation. It's as if someone is reading from a book while you look at the pictures. And this might be due to the age of the video but some of the sewing techniques can be done in less time and trouble with the use of sewing tools, such as a button placement guide, found at your local sewing or craft store. Again, this video is under produced and well over priced.",1115683200,,874,4.50314465408805
