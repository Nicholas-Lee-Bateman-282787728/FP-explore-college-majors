8610681,4,B00EZ6G4R8,"Note; this set has two alternate cuts, one finished by Bava's son, called 'Kidnapped'. But almost all Bava fans and professional critics prefer the rougher edged, less polished original; 'Rabid Dogs', so that's what I watched.

--vague possible mild spoilers ahead --

It's a film that is saved by the rare truly successful twist ending, that changes everything you thought you saw. The acting is less than great, and the film has a definite misogynistic tone (although everyone in it is pretty awful on the humanity scale).

On the other hand, there's effectively high tension, as 3 murderous robbers take two innocent people and a baby hostage. Especially impressive that it never feels talky or visually dull, despite taking place almost entirely inside a car.

But the over-acting and clunky dubbing (and writing) hurt. Then the end came and I was suddenly ready to forgive a lot.",1449273600,,884,4.993197278911564
8610682,5,B00EZ6G4R8,"This film starts with an armed robbery that goes wrong. The gang make the grab but are chased by the police. They get cornered in a car park and take an innocent woman hostage in order to make their escape. Then they car jack another car and demand the owner drive them to their safe house.

Sounds like a simple plot and to all intents and purposes it is. But the beauty of it is in the simple tale there is so much else going on. The gang are universally unlikeable - there is no chance of any Stockholm syndrome taking place here. Trentadue (Thirty Two) is a muscle bound lout who gets his nick name because of his allusions to his `man hood' (think centimetres not inches) his mate is called `Blade' because he like stabbing things - people mainly and Dottore as their sort of leader is just nasty, but with Italian flare. Most of the action takes place in the hi-jacked car but there is plenty besides and the tension is high end throughout. It also never runs out of steam - even when you think it has.

This dual format contains `Kidnapped' the updated version made after director Mario Bava had dies. It was a project carried out by his son Lamberto and both are well worth a watch.

The picture and sound quality vary at times this was because Arrow films have put this together from the best surviving versions, and it can be distracting but not fatal. The music is quite progressive for the time and the SFX like blood are very much of their time too. That said this is a little corker it just tears along and keeps up the atmosphere right to the end. This is one for film enthusiasts who love to remember how film has developed and also anyone who likes a good crime caper - in Italian with good sub titles, seventies fashion, criminal antics and loads of fake blood - bellisimo.",1418428800,,1791,4.3562874251497
