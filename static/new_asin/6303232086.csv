7841380,3,6303232086,"The current DVD's of Tancredi that are available are all basically satisfactory, no more, no less.  The best production of this is the RCA, Abbado version which has both the tragic and the original happy ending.

Vessellina Kasarova and Ramon Vargas are outstanding.  Eva Mei does a nice job.  The production and sound is top notch.  Great Rossini Music.  Unfortunately this has not been done on DVD.  In addition the three CD set is currently out of print and unavailable.  I have been trying to obtain this for over a year with no success.  Music Choice's Opera station recently broadcast the complete opera.  I was fortunate to hear this for the first time in years.

If anyone knows where this is available, please post it here.  You can hear 42 excerpts by searching for Tancredi CD on Amazon.  The information about the CD will come up.",1192233600,,842,4.684931506849315
7841381,5,6303232086,"This is a very fine opera, with a very surprising and powerful ending (the disk also includes an alternate ""happy"" ending which has nothing to recommend it except curiosity). The singing is better than some reviewers suggest; perhaps they prefer bigger but less athletic voices. The staging is somewhat static, but the total musical effect is worth sitting still for.",1161561600,5,367,5.133333333333334
7841382,4,6303232086,"The singing is just divine in this video, especially if you like well-delivered coloratura.  The main problem with this video is the direction or lack there-of.  I got the feeling there really was no stage director and found myself longing for someone to help these singers out a little.  They seemed completely lost to any acting possiblities.  The Tancredi and the Amenaide seemed to be trying to avoid each other as they wandered around the stage singing their lines to the walls rather than to each other.  Plus I did not sense much passion from the singers, particularly the Tancredi.  That might be a combination of Rossini's style and the lack of directing but I think other Tancredis I have heard sounded more committed to the role.  Nevertheless, the video makes a very good sound recording plus you can a watch it a time or two and learn what the opera is about.  The sets and costumes are pretty and traditional.  Also, the singing of Raul Gimenez as Argirio is not to be missed - he's the tops - thrilling coloratura and a pretty voice.  The Tancredi, Bernadette Manca di Nissa, has a nice rich sound, and the soprano and bass have lovely voices too.  Good listening.",1137196800,8,1179,4.647342995169082
7841383,4,6303232086,"I agree with the previous reviewer that this production is very well sung.  However, the opera itself shows Rossini, at least at this stage of his career, had a rather limited musical vocabulary.  Any attempt at pathos in this ""opera seria"" certainly fell flat, as far as I was concerned.  Beethoven had Rossini pegged well when he told him to ""Write more Barbers"".  The people who will enjoy Tancredi the most are those who get a thrill from close to perfect execution of extremely difficult coloratura passages.",1136073600,4,513,4.862068965517241
7841384,5,6303232086,"'Tancredi' was Rossini's first successful opera seria, premi&egrave;ring only three months before 'The Italian Girl in Algiers.' It was quite successful, but for a staging only a few months later he composed an alternate ending. So, there is both a tragic ending -- the one most often given these days -- and a happy ending. In the nineteenth century it was the happy ending that audiences most approved. In this 1992 presentation from the little jewel-box theater of the Schwetzinger Festspiele we get to see both endings. After a gloriously lugubrious tragic final scene, and after the cast and conductor take their bows onstage, conductor Gianluigi Gelmetti makes a little announcement (in Italian) that 'Rossini also wrote a happy ending,' and with that he strikes up the band and conducts the happy finale from the side of the stage. I must say that it is a charming idea, and is pulled off with real panache. It also gives us another opportunity to hear this wonderful cast sing yet more, and in some of Rossini's happiest music.

I kept thinking as I watched this performance that it was like watching something from Glyndebourne. Pier Luigi Pizzi's settings, costumes and stage direction are expert, particularly considering the static action of the opera itself -- most of the opera's action occurs offstage while onstage we have a succession of arias, duets, choruses and ensemble pieces. The music, of course, is by Rossini and that counts for a lot, but still this is not a very engaging opera action-wise. Pizzi manages his forces with characteristic grace and logic, however, and one is slowly drawn into the story of thwarted love, family enmity erased by a common enemy, mistaken intentions, and in the tragic ending the death of the title character.

Musically the production is superior. Tancredi, a coloratura mezzo (or contralto) role is taken brilliantly by Bernadette Manca di Nissa. While not quite in the class of Marilyn Horne, who owned this role in her heyday, Manca di Nissa has a beautiful voice with flexibility and fine command of  nuance. She lacks the last little bit of metal in the voice that this warrior role calls for and which Horne supplied so generously. And her acting is a bit generic; one doesn't feel particularly threatened when she waves her sword about.  The opera's most famous aria, 'Di tanti palpiti,' is thrilling. Maria Bayo as Tancredi's lover, Amenaide, is simply wonderful in a relatively thankless, and faceless, role. Her sweet soprano is used musically and intelligently. Occasionally in ensembles and at the top of her range her tone is swallowed up by the sound of orchestra and the other singers. This is a small quibble; this is not a Verdi soprano role after all. Young Polish soprano Kataryna Bak is excellent as Isaura. The men in the cast are really quite good. The then very-young bass Ildebrando d'Arcangelo acts and sings well. Ra&uacute;l Gim&eacute;nez, the Argentine tenor who made a career of singing bel canto roles, is both believable and musically thrilling in the role of Amenaide's father, Argirio.

All told, then, this is a very good presentation of one of Rossini's opera serias. Rossini's biographer Stendhal counted it among Rossini's best; I wouldn't go that far, but then I am prejudiced in favor of Rossini's comedies, so perhaps that's just a matter of personal taste. This presentation certainly makes a good case for the opera, and I think its small-scale setting is a plus, particularly since it is a rather static opera that doesn't require a huge stage filled with action. As far as I know this is the only DVD version of the opera. There was a poor presentation from Trieste that was available and I've not seen it, but it didn't get very good reviews. As far as I know Horne never filmed a complete version of the opera.

7841385,4,6303232086,"It is difficult to believe that Rossini's opera seria ""Tancredi"" was composed in the same year as the joyous ""Italian Girl in Algiers."" And yet if you listen very carefully to (say) the Act I  finales to both works in which every one declares how amazed they are at  the turn of events, you might be hard pressed to explain why you think one  is the serious and the other the comic situation. Perhaps the composer was  basically such a happy chap that he saw the humor in all things.
At  any rate, there is only one video version of <Tancredi>  (RCA Victor  Red Seal 90926-62642-3) and happily it is a good one. However the reader  unfamiliar with this work should take note. The plot is minimal and not  very arresting; and what there is of it moves at a snail's pace with a  great disregard for credibility and acts only as a peg for one aria after  another, spiced here and there with a brief chorus or a duet or ensemble.  The staging from the 1992 Schwetzinger Festival production is consequently  fairly static as one well-dressed character after another poses and sings.  Well, don't they do that in ""Trovatore""? you might ask. Sure, but  the Verdi work is filled with memorable melodies, while you will come away  from this work not able to recall more than two or three.
  However for  students of opera, seeing and hearing this work is a must; if only for the  reason that it sheds light on early 19th century musical and dramatic  tastes and lets us estimate how far from it Verdi and Puccini took opera  into the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
  Vocally the men are very  good indeed: tenor Raul Gimenez (Argirio)  and basso Idlebrando D'Arcangelo  (Orbazzano) are not very subtle (nor is the music they are given) but they  are impressive in the old style. Heroine soprano Maria Bayo (Amenaide) is  nearly taxed at the top of the scale but never sounds strained in a  colorless role; while the secondary characters of Isaura and Roggiero are  handled nicely but without any fireworks by mezzo Katarzyna Bak and soprano  (Maria Pia Piscitelli).
  Although she sings with a mellow mezzo, more a  contralto, Bernadette Manca di Nissa gives us a Tancredi -- (yes, women  took male parts in those days) -- that looks nothing like a fierce warrior  (not her fault) and also acts like none (definitely the director's fault).  When she brandishes a sword, it might as well be an umbrella with which she  is hailing a taxi. When she sings ""You fill me with horror,""  someone not reading the subtitles or knowing Italian would never know what  emotion is being expressed.
  What is very nice about this set is that  after conducting the Radio-Sinfonieorchestrer Stuttgart right up to the  tragic ending and after the curtain calls, Gianluigi Gelmetti goes on to  conduct from the stage the ""happy ending"" alternate finale! That  Golden Moment alone is worth the price of the set.
  So this is not for  those who never saw ""The Barber of Seville"" or  ""Cenerentola"" yet, but certainly for those--and grab it while it  is still available--who want a good example of the old fashioned opera that  was dying out back in 1813.",944092800,14,3128,4.6440366972477065
