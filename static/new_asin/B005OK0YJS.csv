4853038,3,B005OK0YJS,I love '30s & '40s comedy-mysteries/whodunits and Marjorie Weaver and Robert Lowery were good when they were cast as a couple in two Charlie Chan movies. But Marjorie was rather annoying in the the first part of this movie. She was way over the top trying to be funny. But I would blame the director for that. She did chill some later on though and I'd still recommend the movie to those who enjoy this genre.,1395705600,2,409,4.394736842105263
4853039,3,B005OK0YJS,"From 1931 through 1953, Monogram Pictures Corporation was known to create films in Hollywood on low budgets.

Among the talents used by Monogram Picture is actor Robert Lowery (""Batman and Robin"", ""Campus Rhythm"", ""'77 Sunset Strip"") and actress Marjorie Weaver (""Second Honeymoon"", ""The Californian"", ""Young Mr. Lincoln"").  For Weaver, the last film she would have a major role is the 1945 Monogram Pictures film ""Fashion Model"".

And now ""Fashion Model"" has been selected for release under Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's ""Limited Edition Collection"" which is the company's MOD (Manufactured-on-Demand) series, similar to Warner Bros. has done with Warner Archive and Sony's Columbia Classics.

The films do not have special features, nor have they been remastered, fixed-up or gone through any expensive restoration work. If anything, a lot of these films are targeted to a nice group of movie fans and collectors and are typically not the big giant titles that movie studios would want to promote.

And because Monogram Pictures films were low-budget films and the fact that interest in classic Hollywood is waning, fortunately, there is a niche group of movie fans, such as myself who value these films, high-budget or low-budget, just the opportunity to watch them brings happiness to us.

But with that being said, because these films are not sold for cheap and are sold typically under $20 with no special features and nothing but the film, this group expects a good print with no major problems with the disc.

So, before I go with my review for ""Fashion Model"", the question many will want to know first is... ""Does it play?"". I played this DVD on my Sony PlayStation 3 with no problems whatsoever. No stalling, no shadowing, no errors. It played perfectly.

MOD PLAYABILITY:

Part of the worry of viewers who had bad experiences with MOD DVD's are the printing quality. There are some who can't get them to play and are literally now just coasters.

With ""Fashion Model"", it's printed quite well with printing on top of the DVD, it's not a plain silver disc with letters. If you didn't know it was MOD, you would think it was an actual DVD release.

As for playability, I played it on my Sony PlayStation 3 with no problems. I then played it on my Mac, no problems whatsoever.

VIDEO AND AUDIO:

As far as picture quality goes, the film has been manufactured using the best source available. But it is important to remember that Monogram Pictures Corporation films were created with a low budget and these films have not gone through any major restoration.

With that being said, you can see the dust and scratches on the film, as well as mild flickering but other than that, the film is watchable and I personally had no problems watching this film, considering some Monogram Pictures films that I have seen were also not in the greatest shape, but compared to those films, ""Fashion Model"" is watchable, no blurring, but there is some shimmering during some parts earlier in the film.  I also noticed a few scratches and dust appear from time-to-time.

As for audio, the film is dialogue driven and dialogue is clear and understandable.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

There are no special features for ""Fashion Model"".

JUDGMENT CALL:

I'm a big fan of Monogram Pictures films.  Low budget but typically hour-long films that manage to be fun and for the most part, very good popcorn films from the '30s through the '50s.  ""Fashion Model"" is a fun, comedy that is a bit farfetched but I have to admit, when you find out who the killer is, I think most viewers would be surprised.

But I found this film quite intriguing because whenever someone is found dead, no one really cares.  It's more of shock and surprise and life goes on type of mentality.  In fact, when the people are shown dead, for example, the store boss, you can see his chest moving up and down, yet he's supposed to be dead.  Monogram Pictures is known for their low-budget pictures but I found that scene to be intriguing.

And when you find out who the killer is, makes you ask yourself ""are you kidding me?"".  Again, it's farfetched, but it's such a fun film as both Peggy and Jimmy try to avoid the police and being noticed by wearing costumes.  One scene has the two trying to pretend they are mannequins in front of the store window, and the person who is in charge of changing the mannequins clothes is unaware that the mannequins he has put up on the front window is actually Peggy and Jimmy.

But so far, everytime I have seen a Rob Lowery Monogram Pictures film, I know I'm in for a good time.  Sure, the films are short but they are quite entertaining and fun to watch!

And for those who are open to watching Hollywood low-budget films, in this case, a Monogram Pictures comedy, just because it's not made by a major studio doesn't mean it's terrible. ""Fashion Model"" is a good ""popcorn comedy"" and I had an enjoyable time watching it!",1335571200,9,4905,4.747641509433962

Can't understand why it was ever made.",1448323200,,310,4.867924528301887
