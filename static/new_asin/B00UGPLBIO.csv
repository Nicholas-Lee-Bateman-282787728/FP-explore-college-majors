8705724,4,B00UGPLBIO,"It is with mixed emotions that I write this review because any opportunity to see Elvis in concert is a treat. Ann Margaret once said, ""It's a wonderful thing to be on a first name basis with the world. Everyone knew him as ELVIS"" The footage of the concert, the editing of the special effects and sound reflected the hard work put into putting this package together. Where it falls short is in the decision making of BMG Marketing or whomever made the call to turn down the volume of Elvis' back up singers, J.D. Sumner and the Stamps, and the Sweet Inspirations.  In many of his songs you can barely hear them. I have to say to BMG if Elvis had wanted his material released like this, he wouldn't have brought all those people with him to Hawaii to do the concert. Elvis' back up singers were an integral part of his music and BMG tunes them down as though they added nothing to the show. I know in their doing this in the past they have said they wanted to highlight Elvis voice. I respectfully disagree with the decision. J.D. and his Stamps, The Sweet Inspirations, and Kathy Westmoreland enhanced Elvis music with their sweet harmonies.  And again I say, if Elvis didn't want to hear them, he would not have had them in his recordings and concerts. It is my hope that in a future release of this product so BMG can make even more money off of Elvis they put back the voices that were silenced and that Elvis valued so much.",1490832000,13,1429,4.368421052631579
