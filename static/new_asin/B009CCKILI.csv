8539544,5,B009CCKILI,"This DVD covering a rebuild of the Continental tractor engines was very well done !  The main points of an engine rebuild , especially those unique to these Continental gas engines , was clearly presented .  I think viewing this DVD , and then using a written rebuild manual to cover additional details and specifications,  would be a good procedure for doing a rebuild.",1383523200,,370,4.75
