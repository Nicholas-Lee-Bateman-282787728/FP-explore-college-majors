8614543,5,B00FDVVO1U,"This film was an official selection of the 2012 Sundance Film Festival: it revolves around the flamenco guitarist David Serva, who has accompanied a long list of stars that includes Juan Talega, Manolito de Mara, La Perla de Cdiz, Fernando de Utrera, Agujetas and many others.

This does not, of course, distinguish him from several other notable flamenco guitarists.  But Sr. Serva is (or rather, was) actually David Jones, of Berkeley California.  In 1962, on his second trip to Spain, he went to Morn de la Frontera and there fell under the spell of Diego del Gastor.  He absorbed Diego's style of playing; and when he eventually returned to the Bay Area, he brought it back with him, becoming a regular at San Francisco's now-legendary Mecca of flamenco, the Spaghetti Factory in North Beach, as well as Berkeley's Cabale and the Freight and Salvage.  But the flamenco lifestyle had him in its grip, and he returned more and more to Spain.

Over the years, he fathered five children.  But unfortunately for them, he had them by five different women, ditching each in turn along with her child.  The film was written and directed by one of those children, and it is his story, theirs and their mothers'.

I shall eschew any austere comments about morals or responsibility, as I am sure they will occur to you without my prompting, and doubtless some not-so-austere ones too.

The film is a kaleidoscopic collection of interviews, performances and historical film clips, and very well done it is too.  I'm not surprised at the Sundance verdict.

Whether I'd want to watch it more than once or twice is another matter, and so the sound-track CD is a welcome bonus.  Sr. Serva's style clearly owes a great deal to that of his mentor, but he is not a mere copyist, and has developed a definite style of his own.  A couple of his falsetas don't quite work for me, but that's fine.  I'd rather have that than playing safe all the time.

8614544,5,B00FDVVO1U,"A flamenco guitar player myself, I stumbled upon this little gem of a story. Having traveled abroad including, Espaa, I brought back music, life experiences and many memories. Because of the difference in the dvd digital format NTSC or PAL in different parts of the world, it makes it hard to find good material that Im interested in.
I found this story, a gem indeed. A story that leads one man across a long road to a slow or arduous journey, a dream already set in his heart, long before setting off. Along the way the waterholes it seems are just that ... waterholes or mirages, the people he touches. Like a long night of music and dance but, by morning, its certain that the gypsy was gone. A story of love-hurts.
A flamenco story indeed and highly recommended!!!

8614547,2,B00FDVVO1U,"The director of this film is mostly interested in her own obsession with her father, the ""Gypsy Davy"" of the title, and in her father's abandonment of the family he briefly raised in the US before departing for Spain. That is unfortunate, because her father was a fascinating man, an American who reinvented himself as a flamenco guitarist in Spain. The author keeps weeping about her father's departure and in effect scolding him, and she seems to view her own personal problems as the effects of her father's departure. I accept that the man didn't do right by his family, but there's nothing interesting about that, and the author casts no light on the reasons for the departure, the way it might have affected Gypsy Davy, or indeed anything else. If you are the kind of person who enjoys picking over the bones of your own failed family bonds or romantic adventures and blaming other people for your problems, this is possibly a good choice for you. Otherwise, despite a few minutes of pretty impressive flamenco playing and singing, this film is a waste of time.",1387843200,,1067,4.741935483870968
8614548,5,B00FDVVO1U,"I was prepared for ""Gypsy Davy"" to be extremely well-made, as I have seen other work from the talented Rachel Leah Jones. What I had not been prepared for, however, was just how beautiful, poignant and gripping I would find this multi-layered story of loss and love between a daughter and her father. There are no simple endings in life, and there are no easy resolutions to painful family histories; Jones does not try to convince us otherwise. What she does do, through exposing all the hurtful and beautiful complexities that characterized the relationships between David Serva Jones and his partners/children, is reveal how important it can be to continue to reach out over impossible divides. Perhaps the hurts cannot be healed, but possibilities for connection may still exist, and fresh memories can be layered onto the tapestry of family history; in Jones' case, a history that is as rich and compelling as the music that undergirds it.",1384214400,3,944,4.981012658227848
