8452161,4,B00510GMBU,"I do like the DVD however the camera person didn't do a good job of filming. At the beginning when they show all the examples of what can be made it was very bleary. Also throughout the DVD when the instructor did rapid movements it was pretty bleary too. I liked the instructor, She was good & seemed friendly.",1433203200,2,311,4.288135593220339

I just wish there was more than one project included on the DVD, but the bracelet I made was beautiful, especially since I had never done wire wrapping before. Would gladly buy more instructional DVDs by Dale Cougar Armstrong.",1338940800,3,280,4.73469387755102
