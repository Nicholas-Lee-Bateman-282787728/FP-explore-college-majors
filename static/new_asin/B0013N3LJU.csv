8252277,5,B0013N3LJU,"Based on ballet and yoga technique.

A perfect at home routine to keep you stretched and limber - and set all
the parts of your body in correct relation to each other.  You can do just the first stretch part to begin; yet there are also advanced cardio and strength exercises.

As David Howard says, it is ""based on ballet and yoga technique.""",1433462400,,343,4.412698412698413
8252278,2,B0013N3LJU,I was disappointed. I used to take classes with David Howard when I danced with New York City Ballet. The shape up was not strength building enough . I was and am used to taking Pilates for all my stretch and strength.,1414454400,,218,4.214285714285714
8252279,5,B0013N3LJU,A fantastic workout full of retro-styled goodness! This video features an insanely good core workout nicely balanced with flexibility and aerobic conditioning. Very good if you dance and need to strengthen your core while continuing to work on your extension.,1356480000,2,259,5.5

8252281,5,B0013N3LJU,I used it when it was a video for many years and now as a DVD.  I have achieved very good results for overall fitness.,1265760000,2,118,3.72
