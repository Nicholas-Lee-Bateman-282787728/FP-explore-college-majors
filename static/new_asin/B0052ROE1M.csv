8470357,5,B0052ROE1M,"For those that have watched the anime, read the light novels, and read the manga, I think you will find this rendition a compelling additional installment.  I truly enjoyed the movie, the extras, and the extremely fancy set this came as.  The technical specifications for this set include: The box itself (9 3/4 x 11 x 3 1/2), a 2 disc Blu-ray/DVD combo pack (the Blu-ray is region A and will play in any American device [110 mins], the DVD is region 2 [175 mins], but should play in any Windows 7 PC with Windows Media Player), the movie poster (double sided), and last, but not least, a Fukuzawa Yumi fleece blanket (29 x 38).  There are loads of extras (different on each disc) and the movie runs approximately 110 minutes.  There are no sub-titles available for either discs, but the story is easy to follow along with, particularly if you have consumed the other media.  If you are a fan of Maria-Sama ga Miteru, this is well worth your money!  If you are new to this series, you may want to watch the anime version first, before making the investment in this particular edition.",1424131200,,1084,4.533333333333333
