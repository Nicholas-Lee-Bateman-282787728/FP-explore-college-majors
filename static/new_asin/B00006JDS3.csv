Can't understand why Hell would subject himself to this crap. Two minutes of fun with amateur gore effects ten minutes prior to the end of the film, nor Hell, cannot redeem it. It's worse than a bad student film, certainly not worth the money they spent on its production. And the additional short films aren't even worth the fast-forward view, simply horrendous. I'm just thankful for the OFF button.",1313712000,,548,4.6020408163265305
7970012,4,B00006JDS3,"Ive herd about this film for many many years and finaly i was able to see it. I have to say it made me sad, not the film just the production. They don't and never will make films with such a fun playful sence of abandoment that Zeds work dose. The nobudget scene is dead and everyone is on the computer; lost are the glitches and the blered shots of a true artist learning his craft, now the camera dose it for you.
I think as a fellow filmmaker the worst thing you can do is boar the audience, Zed NEVER bores his audiece. Ive seen shorts or ""indie"" films that are shot wonderfully look great but have no scence of  personality. No feeling no sence of doom or fun just boring.
So you can be technaly profisiant and shoot a film wonderfully but unless you have the mind of an artist its a wast of time, your film will be boaring. Zedd never had to worry about that and this shows it; hes like a playful kid stealing a camera and shooting his little story the way he wants it for himself; and if you want you can hope on and ride with him, but if not go away i am sure there is some new AVITAR type film youll relate to more.",1286668800,,1124,4.017857142857143
7970013,2,B00006JDS3,These films are very bizarre haha. They are kind of hilarious at the same time. I'd say these have a huge random factor and are for those seeking the most underground of films.,1266364800,,176,4.363636363636363
7970014,5,B00006JDS3,"I hadn't seen any of Zedd's films since a festival 10 or 15 years; like fine peanut butter, they only improve with age.

Today's crop of youngsters may come away baffled, however -- this DVD is a window into that mythical era of yore when people made art to express a certain mischievous, irreverent joy in life -- and to subsequently transmit that same hilarious exuberance on to the viewer -- and NOT simply for fame/money/attention/etc.

Technically primitive, sloppy, shot on shoestring budgets, with underrealized plots, and acting that's sometimes deliberately awful and sometimes just awful, and yet -- so much more spontaneous, ballsy, amusing and fun than anything you'll see on the IFC this year.",1208908800,,706,5.077586206896552
7970015,2,B00006JDS3,"I knew I was in for quite a ride when the first thing seen in a film is a narrator telling me to affix a drool cup to my chin. This is an interesting movie: so badly made and edited that it is like a car wreck in that you want to turn away, but you just stare transfixed by the ghastliness of it. The complete title of the film is actually ""Geek Maggot Bingo, Or, The Freak From Suckweasel Mountain."" The cast list includes Donna Death as Scumbelina (Donna also is the film's caterer), Gumby Spangler as Flavian Quagmire, and Quasimodo Residue as the kitten. Nick Zedd produced, wrote, directed, filmed and edited the film, so he's ultimately the responsible party.
The film is set on Suckweasel Mountain in a castle next to Ugly Pond painted poorly on a canvas backdrop, as are almost all sets. The effect is a surreal spectacle that makes the viewer look for hidden things in the tawdriness. For example, every phone in this film is made of cardboard and is grotesquely oversized: using them is quite a spectacle unto itself.
The premise is that the evil genius, Dr. Frankenberry is trying to create a super-human via 'cosmic regeneration'. In the beginning of the film this process has allegedly produced a cute kitten, ""Quasimodo Residue"", dyed pink and blue, who blissfully ignores the onscreen mayhem taking place around it. The  insanity of Dr. Frankenberry makes Dean Quagmire fire him from the university, therefore he hires a Quasimodo impersonator named ""Gecko"" (but pronounced Geek-o), to assist him in his evil experiments. Gecko needs to procure bodies for Dr. Frankenberry, so he obtains them by posing as a nose-picking transvestite prostitute, and returning his victims to the lab in his handbag. All of this action takes place while music apparently from 'Popeye' plays in the background, creating an odd juxtaposition. The victims of Gecko's clever scheme end up in what is easily the worst lab set I have ever seen. It makes Dr. Neon's lab from 'The Wild, Wild World of Batwoman' look like the Sandia National Laboratory. Adding further to the avant-garde nature of the film is the fact that Dr. Frankenberry sounds exactly like Bobby ""Boris"" Pickett of ""Monster Mash"" fame if he were on amphetamines.
Ultimately Buffy Frankenberry, the Doctor's daughter, has ethical questions about his experiments and refuses to cooperate in his attempt to create a superman out of a small octopus and lump of bleu cheese. She instead flees to the comforting embrace of her boyfriend, Flavian, who, coincidentally, is the worst actor in motion picture history. Unfortunately, Flavian has been bitten by the stupidest looking bat I have seen in a while and is now a vampire under the spell of Scumbelina. (See, it all makes sense...because...er, never mind.) Gecko is also bitten by the bat while a stuffed squirrel and chipmunk puppet cheer. He vows to be Scumbelina's mole and report on Dr. Frankenberry's doings. The vampire trio kidnap Buffy, which, logically, causes Dr. Frankenberry to make a 'Formaldehyde Man' using the human life force energy transferred from a cowboy, ""The Rawhide Kid"", who wanders onto the set looking for a drink. Frankenberry gets him plastered to get him to go back to his lab. Unfortunately for the audience, The Kid sings us a Salvador Daliesque song, which I feel needs to be seen to believe, so here it is:
I met her in a gay bar stoned on oatmeal,
I can still recall those training pants she wore.
She was smellin' kinda' funny in her muu muu,
And I knew we really lost the Vietnam War.
My Pooh Bear said I'd pick my nose forever,
She said to me that Rolaids made her high,
But who'd have thought she'd boogie on 'The Gong Show',
She sent a hired thug to say goodbye.
In the last few minutes of the film The Kid lassoes Gecko and suspends him from the ceiling by his hump, which provokes Frankenberry to call him a ""weinerhead"". The super human, ""Homo Superior"", goes on a rampage and general mayhem exists for a little while, which (in part) includes skeletal decomposition via the power of scrubbing bubbles, musket fire, and death by being flung into a badly animated void. In the end everything works out, and the audience breathes a collective sigh of relief after the 73 minutes are over.
This is a very bad movie, made in Brooklyn, NY for next to nothing. It is not good (at all) but has Ed Wood entertainment value. It would undoubtedly be R rated, and is definitely only for adults. I will not recommend it, but specific audiences will adore it, though most people would not enjoy it at all. If you want to see something completely different, you might want to try 'Geek Maggot Bingo'. Then again, maybe not.
The DVD also comes with a couple of extra shorts made by the same people. One is a very bad 'Lord of the Rings' parody. If you like Tolkein, you might like it; I found it insufferable. There is one titled 'Elf Panties', about an elf who owns 1730 pairs of panties, and changes them all the time. That's it. Well, she does telepathically communicate with the purple Teletubbie while wearing her Teletubbies panties, but you get the idea. The girl is pretty, but the whole bit is a bit lowbrow and unappealing. Finally there is 'Thus Spake Zarathrustra', complete with credit line ""Written by Jon Vomit. Based on the book by F.W. Nietzsche."" It is basically one long black and white angst ridden music video featuring bands like ""Fear of Dolls"", ""Amniotic Miasma"", and ""Zyklon Beatles"". It is very boring and contains zero dialogue, though there are captions such as ""I'm not into monkeys. She's the one who is anti-shaving."" Two words: skip it.",1085788800,16,5603,4.729038854805726
7970016,5,B00006JDS3,"This collection of films is not for the average simpleton, looking for gore, T&A and shallow action movie dialogue.  It is however, for the intellectual pervert, drag queens, tomboys, art stars and dirty old men who will revel in its absurdist, debauched nature.  Geek Maggot Bingo transcends reality by failing on a level so grandiose that the movie becomes a surrealist masterpiece.  The mad scientist refers to a tiny kitten as a monster and we, the audience are expected to beleive this.  The scenery looks like it was made by an anarchist pre-school and this creates an aesthetic unlike any other...Instead of using a prop phone-- director, Nick Zedd, paints a piece of cardboard to look like a phone!  Genius!  Richard Hell is definitely saucey and will satisfy any viewer who happens to have a cowboy fetish.  Brenda Bergman is reminiscent of a screen goddess of Hollywood's golden age.  The over-acting is hilarious and consistent.  How do they keep it up?  For one low price, not only do you get this masterpiece you also get three other great movies!  Elf Panties recalls happy adolescent days of playing Dungeons & Dragons and fantasizing about elfin maidens.  Reverend Jen is definitely a sex symbol for those whose sexuality has advanced beyond merely spanking it to Sports Illustrated Swimsuit edition...It takes the whole idea of a fetish film and turns it on its head.  Lord of the Cockrings is way funnier than that other Lord of the Rings movie.  Plus, it has an amazing, Jimmy Page-inspired soundtrack and an exploding volcano!",1040601600,,1546,4.941860465116279
7970017,5,B00006JDS3,"This DVD is not even remotely boring.
The featured movie Geek Maggot Bingo is a smorgasboard for sleaze fanatics with superb performances by Brenda Bergman and Richard Hell as well as outstanding low-budget special effects and make-up by Tyler Smith.
The dialog is hilarious and a testiment to Nick Zedd's brilliance as a writer.
The extra interview with cast members (shot in 1983) is excellent and revealing.
The accompanying extras include Lord of the Cockrings with FANTASTIC original music by Brer Brian and Thus Spake Zarathustra with awesome music by Zyklon Beatles, Fear of Dolls, Strangewalls, Amniotic Miasma and others that blows away the music on R. Kern's stuff.
Unlike other members of the Cinema of Transgression,  Zedd appears to have  evolved and continued to produce new and challenging work in the last decade.
He  alone remains active and essential in underground film.
There is really no comparison here. Kern's movies are boring compared to the diversity and experimental edge exhibited in Nick Zedd's work.
Rev Jen's writing and acting are far more entertaining and impressive than the stuff on Kern's tape.
Elf Panties: The Movie is  hilarious.
The music (by Joe Meek and the Blue Men) is brilliant.
I highly recommend this DVD.",1039910400,13,1252,5.122549019607843
7970018,1,B00006JDS3,"This doesn't even desearve the the one star I had to give it. This movie is by far the stupidest, cheapeast piece of junk  have ever watched. What happened to the directing? Or the acting? Or anything, this movie lacks everything possible! This movie had to have been made on a budget of, and a I swear like 16 dollars. So why the heck did they release this on DVD? Beats the crud out of me, but you'll be asking it shortly after you pop into your player and have to view this horrible film. Please take my advice and don't look this movie up again, and don't read my review again but most importantly don't even think about watching this film. Its pathetic.",1039564800,3,658,4.306451612903226
