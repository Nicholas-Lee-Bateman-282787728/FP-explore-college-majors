1236290,5,B00000JPG0,"It's a MUST-HAVE for any Chipmunk fan!
From an Artist's point of view; the animations are great! Everything is well drawn out and very accurate. All of the characters have a slightly different look (especially Dave) but they all look really good!
I highly recommend this movie to anyone that is able to turn on a TV and VCR!",1013212800,,324,4.508474576271187
1236291,5,B00000JPG0,"I used to watch Alvin and the Chipmunks with my little sisters.  I'm alot older now, and have a son of my own.  He and I just watched this movie and we LOVED it.  It can be a little slow at times, but still great to watch.  I'm glad to see they are still making Chipmunk movies!!!!",1002585600,,281,3.8771929824561404
1236292,4,B00000JPG0,"Ok I amit the fact I love alvin and the chipmunks, I have since I was really little. This movie was ok, but not as enjoyable as the Chipmunk adventure, I loved that movie I still watch it over and over again. The 3rd movie was also better. This movie was a little slow and lacked alot of stuff, but it's great for little children, so it's ok in my books. But not 100% ok for any real chipmunk buff. you should still see it if you love the chipmunks.",971481600,2,449,4.0
1236293,4,B00000JPG0,"I got a chance to see this movie when I was baby-sitting. The little boy I sit for, aged 2 1/2, absolutely adores this film. Perhaps he's seen it a few too many times (he's starting to quote), but it's one of the only films  that can hold is interest for the entirety. He LOVES the songs; he even  gets up from his seat to dance when the songs are about to come on.  And I  must say this is one of the only animated films that I actually like!  The  film's main lessons are friendship, responsibility and good manners, all  which are presented effectively.  The Chipmunks have a job doing a show at  a big theme park. After one show, Alvin decides he wants to visit Dragon  Land.  The three of them set off on an adventure just *getting* to Dragon  Land, as Alvin takes control of their little tour tram and takes everyone  on a thrilling ride. Later, they accidentally pick up an extra person:  Frankenstein's monster, who has been made by--yes, the REAL--Dr.  Frankenstein, who has taken up residence in the park's castle.  Frankie  follows the Chipmunks home.  This movie is never dull; there's always  something going on, and it's a real treat for both kids and adults.  Furthermore, you might not be able to understand what the Chipmunks are  singing all the time, but the music is fun and up-beat.  The movie also  contains bits of humor for adults--and not the somewhat untasteful innuendo  that sometimes makes it way into Disney films.  Good, clean, humorous fun.",961372800,4,1472,4.569230769230769
1236294,2,B00000JPG0,"The low rating is for the fact that this film and The Chipmunk Adventure are not on DVD... I loved both films, but I would love to see this and the first one put out on DVD. I thought that this movie was better in quality.  The film was not too scary for kids. I would question the going into  graveyards for body parts bit though... Could have been better on DVD...",960768000,5,366,4.069444444444445
1236295,5,B00000JPG0,"I've been a fan of the Chipmunks for years.  I grew up watching the 80's cartoon with my plush Theodore by my side.  I rented and watched this film with reservations because I thought they had peaked with the Chipmunk  Adventure back in 1987.  I was wrong.  They stayed true to the  personalities I remembered, even after all these years.  The story was fun  and the three new songs were great.  I was glad to see that Theodore had a  pretty significant role, and Dave's large role and Ms. Miller's cameo were  nice touches.  The only things missing, in my opinion, were the Chipettes.  I kept expecting them to show up.  Even so, I give this movie 5 stars.  To  the creators, know that you brought any number of smiles to the face of  this 20 year old man, who has been a fan of yours since I was 3.  I just  hope it isn't another 12 years before we see another one (and bring the  Brittany, Jeanette, and Eleanor along next time, please).",952992000,2,940,4.293103448275862

1236306,3,B00000JPG0,"The DVD cover and artwork overall is cute! but i do feel it would have been nice if Alvin had his blue eye color on the cover artwork. The main menu lacks music and has no sound which i think would have been a nice addition to this DVD. The movie it's self is great! and the quolity is not bad, but if you own the past versions of this film i would not suggest  getting this movie unless you are a collector. The only new thing is the cover, but if you are a collector i do suggest getting this the artwork is cute and its a great movie! but be warned the Disc came out of the case in the mail and started slipping around in the case! so the box must be weak! But the Movie itself is amazing! and if you love the Chipmunks you should buy this! thanks for your time in reading this! have a nice day!",1441756800,,798,3.895705521472393
