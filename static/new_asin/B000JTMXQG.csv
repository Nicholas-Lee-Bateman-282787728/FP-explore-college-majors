8153238,5,B000JTMXQG,"This is one of those movies that has a haunting feel that draws you in, even though you aren't sure where the plot will end up. The plot is intentionally somewhat circular in nature. A number of the characters have a sad, resigned nature about them. It's almost as if the whole movie is about how happiness is just beyond reach. This is the kind of movie you aren't quite sure about the first time you see it, but which leaves you with enough memorable images that you want to see it again.",1215475200,,490,4.279569892473118
