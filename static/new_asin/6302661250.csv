Now on to the videos. This is a good series of anime with a good plot line about a pilot who is transported into the future when he detonates a time/space bomb. He is sought out by pretty much everyone because they believe him to be a source of extreme power. I will admit that animation is not of the best quality but the story line makes up for this. The quality of animation is why I give this only 4 stars.",986256000,,601,3.9344262295081966
