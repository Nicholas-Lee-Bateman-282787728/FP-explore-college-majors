8199134,5,B000R7HYGY,I love these cartoons and the messages they share so beautifully.  I recommend them to everyone I know with young kids.,1387411200,,119,4.666666666666667
8199135,5,B000R7HYGY,"These are bar none-the BEST videos for a toddler.  They teach manners, are interesting, colorful and quite honestly, fun to watch.  If you like blues clues, I think you could sit through these.  Best part:  You can set them on LOOP so they play over and over.  Great for daycares, or bedtime!",1340323200,,292,4.538461538461538
8199136,5,B000R7HYGY,"I never knew ToddWorld existed until my daughter bought a DVD from the local dollar store. My grandsons LOVE this DVD! They are VERY hard to find. So when I found a few (especially the volumes) on Amazon, I bought on of each. I also bought a few of the single DVDs of ToddWorld for them too. I don't think I've missed any. The lessons they learn from the various storylines are sharing, caring, respecting, and appreciating diversity in others and themselves. They also learn to interact and cooperate with others and are encouraged to learn from life while living it! The messages are all positve, the characters diverse and pleasing. The continuous play option is a plus too! You'll love these for your kids and yourself!!",1293321600,,724,4.708661417322834
