8739002,3,B001688VD8,"This DVD was produced--and given out free--by the Salt Lake Organizing Committee (SLOC) as a thank you to the 1,000s of volunteers who helped out during the 2002 Olympic Winter Games in Salt Lake City. It is mainly a musical/video montage of various volunteers helping out before and during the games. There are 8 Chapters (listed below) and each lasts maybe 5 minutes.

Chapters:
The Journey Begins
Light the Fire Within
Carry the Flame
The Blue Zone
The Games
Farewell/Arrivederci
Salt Lake 2002 Paralympic Winter Games
Salt Lake 2002 Credits

There are a few scenes from the opening/closing ceremonies and various competitions, but they are short and quick, plus there is no audio from the ceremonies (as music is dubbed over almost everything). The only dialog during the entire video is contained in short interviews shown during the credits chapter.

There was a special Remember the Journey four disc set produced, and given out to far fewer people. This set included not only the Remember the Journey DVD, but also included three other DVDs with the Opening Ceremony, Closing Ceremony, and the Paralympic Opening Ceremony. The ceremonies on these DVDs are really nice, partly because the video came straight from the Olympic Archives, and not from a TV network. This means that the sometimes annoying commentary of announcers is not dubbed over the audio! The four disc set was produced in fewer numbers, and is more coveted; making it much harder to find.

I do highly recommend trying to hunt down a copy of the four disc version if you would like a nice copy of the ceremonies.
