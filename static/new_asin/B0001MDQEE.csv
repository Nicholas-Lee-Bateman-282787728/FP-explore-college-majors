8014768,3,B0001MDQEE,"Pretty cool Truck and Cars. A Cool kenworth Cabover with Custom Sleeper and a Kenworth Conventional daycab that shows up later. You also have ""Paulie"" from the Sopranos(Tony Sirico but he is Anthony Sirico in the Credits) Some good action but a bit boring at times. Still good 70s genre movie. and Fun. PLUS GEORGE BARRIS!",1305936000,,322,4.767857142857143
