8511667,5,B0077AYML4,"Great DVD!
I had been to the Scottish Highlands twice in the past year touring and hiking and paid dearly for several certified private guides, but this DVD covered all the same subject matter and filled in other interesting historical gaps the guides had skipped over.
The photography and the script organization is great.
Watch before you visit! Then you better enjoy the scenery without your nose in a gudebook and ask better questions of any guides you may hire.",1420329600,14,466,4.8375
