you can even set the language to english or spanish, or subtitles for english or spanish, so you can do any combination you like.  Perfect for the classroom.",1374624000,,367,4.671875

8148445,5,B000J108CU,"I'm very pleased with the way my children were immediately captivated by the stories of this DVD. And bring me beautiful memories too! These stories are a truly treasure. Kids learn and have fun with this DVD, and them watch it once and again. So it's good that they are watching something that it's not violent and say something about who we are. I highly recommend it!",1170028800,,370,4.537313432835821
