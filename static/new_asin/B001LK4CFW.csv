3684595,4,B001LK4CFW,"I'm slightly conflicted about how I feel about this DVD. While it has valuable content and I love Fayzha's energy and great instructions, I wish there was more practice time included for each of the movements she covers in both the tribal fusion foundation movement and Concepts, Layered and Advanced Moves. Those sections include various moves and concepts that are introduced rather quickly and some I've never seen before, which is why I would've preferred to have some practice time along with Fayzha and not a still picture as I have her on pause and try to remember how she described the movement. I figure the logic behind the little practice time is that this DVD is indubitably for intermediate-advanced dancers who likely know how to practice on their own and in accordance with areas that need improvement so they only need to be informed how to do movements.....I still would've liked more practice though...
So this is the menu on the DVD and how long each section is:
Welcome --3:35  (This is the portion you can find on youtube)
Essential Oils- Preparation for Meditation --1:29 (Here she just discusses how she likes to use essential oils because they can help you relax, etc)
Guided Meditation --7:16 (I don't love this section because I'm not a meditation type of person, especially before dance. Also, there's music in the background that to is not particularly relaxing but others might like it)
Warm-up and tribal fusion technique review --14:26 (This is a fairly thorough warm up, it starts kind of pilates inspired with some ab work and some yoga type stretches, the second half is belly dance inspired and has you warming up for isolations)
Tribal Fusion Foundation Movement --20:09--which has the following moves (duration is in brackets):
1. Walks [2:59] (here she shows a ""panther"" walk, its a funky type of grapevine)
2. Turns & Double Turns [1:47]
3. Chest Rotations [1:23]
4. Headslides and Rolls [1:10]
5. Abdominal Isolations [:53]
6. Popping [:49]
7. Hand Articulations [3:02](This section covers seaweed hands, jelly fish hands and she gives tips and demonstrations on working on hand and finger flexibility and other good tips to polish your hand articulation)
8. Waving [2:16]
9. Arms Training Exercises [2:00]
10. Hips: ""Indian Sit"" [:43]
11. Umis [:20]
12. Glute Accents & Hip Shimmies [:51]
13. Hip Drop Patterns [:31]
Concepts, Advanced Moves & Layers --14:36--which has the following moves (duration is in brackets):
1. Stop and Release [1:07]
2. Exhibiting [:51]
3. Twist Kicks [1:13]
4. Elbow to Knee Pick Ups [:31]
5. Wave Internal Roll Through [:33]
6. Spiral Swinging Door Hips with Elbow Pulls [:56]
7. Walking Mayas Rolling Through Foot [1:10]
8. Floating Seaweed Arms with Hip Accents [1:47]
9. Going to the Market Walk [1:04]
10. Back/Front Cross Step [:38]
11. Hips Ups with Chest Stops [1:12]
12. Slow Washer Woman [:57]
13. Reggae Rock [:38]
14. Balance Turn [1:02]
15. Jellyfish Side Wave Move [:49]
Movement Play Flow --8:49 (This is a good practice flow, it can get confusing if you haven't practiced the moves enough ahead of time but it does cover the new moves Fayzha has introduced to you...yet I feel like I need more. I mean, how can 35 minutes of new moves be covered efficiently in a 9 minute practice flow? Once again, it's a good practice flow, but it could have been longer with more practice time for the more challenging moves. Sure you can just play it over again...but I just want more.
""Bounty Killer"" Choreography Demonstration --1:16
""Bounty Killer"" Combinations Step by Step --8:05 (She explains well and doesn't move too quickly, the choreography is fun and if I can ever get it down pat I'll be very proud. What I liked is that it's very reflective of Fayzha's dance style, she's very tribal but not the gothic dark type. She really is fluid and a great creative dancer.
Performing Tribal Fusion with Finger Cymbals --8:04 (She gives an intro to different ways to make sounds with the zils and how different ones have different tones. She has you play along for a few short minutes to a song playing in the background, and then zils as she dances while a voice over explains what she's doing zil wise)
Tribal Fusion Music Flavors: Improvised Demonstrations --5:19 (She covers one song that has kind of a circus feeling, one that is jazz and I don't remember the third. In a voice over she explains how the music influences her movements and how to listen for those cues that help her reflect the music in her dance. I wish there was a no voice option so that this could double as fun performance pieces)
Performances by Fayzah --4:33 (Fun creative dances but I'm pretty sure I saw both already on youtube)
Overall, this DVD is definitely not a waste because she does impart a lot of great tribal dance knowledge. However, be prepared to get adequate practice with the new and more advanced moves on your own. I don't understand why on the cover it says there are drills in the DVD because there really aren't any, on average you repeat each move about 4 times in the practice flow and when the moves are introduced it goes quite fast as well.  I especially like how she has more of a funky vibe to her tribal dance style, unlike many of the other tribal girls who are more gothic and dark. The production is great and everything looks very professional. She does wear long pants, but when it's important to see the specifics of her foot movements she lifts the pant leg up. If you like Fayzha's style of dancing and have been dancing for some time then this DVD will please you because she really gives away a lot of her secrets. Beginners be warned, this is not a beginner friendly DVD, she will not break down how to do undulations and other more basic moves.",1250812800,42,5738,4.725548902195609
3684596,5,B001LK4CFW,"I was excited to get this one!  I was watching and waiting for it to arrive in my mailbox!  It is impossible for me to choose a favorite syle of bellydance, but I CAN say that this is ONE of my favorite styles to watch!

First of all, let me say that I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this DVD!  That is not to say this will not be a critical review, though, so let me break it down.

Fayzah starts off with a bit on essential oils.  Since no warnings are mentioned in this section, I feel I must.  Always do a patch test with essential oils, and unless you really know what you are doing, don't use them undiluted, as some of them will burn your skin, and all citrus oils make your skin photosensitive (which means, if you wear them in the sun, you are more likely to burn in that area).

Okay, the critical part is over!  Now for some FUN! Fayzah then leads you in a guided meditation and a yoga warm-up, work-out.  She then leads you through isolations, spiraling, turns, locks, pops,hits, and breaks.  She shows you how she fuses a particular club move into her dance.  You will learn combinations and short choreography so that you can practice your new moves and techniques.  You will enjoy her spirit and her love for the dance.

Fayzah also demonstrates that zills have different tones and that you want to play with your zills to find a tone to go with your music.  She does several short performances that you are sure to enjoy!  THIS ONE IS FUN, GIRLS! (AND GUYS)  You will find it challenging if you are not used to layering, and layering isolations, but you want a challenge, now, don't you?!!  Have fun with Fayzah's combinations and playful, energetic motion!",1250035200,9,1659,4.383606557377049
3684597,2,B001LK4CFW,"I wanted to give this DVD more stars - but 2 is all I can muster for an ""instructional"" DVD which doesn't instruct.  Fayzeh has lovely style, great moves, competent technique ... which makes it all the more frustrating that you don't actually LEARN any of it from this DVD!

Most moves and combos are demonstrated only once or twice.  No drills, no repetition.  In some scenes, not only does Fayzeh only demo the move once, but the scene fades-out before she finishes!

If I could learn a move from seeing it only once ... I wouldn't need INSTRUCTIONAL dvds ...

If you want to buy a DVD to watch Fayzeh dance ... there is plenty of 3-4 star PERFORMANCE footage here.  She is a lovely dancer.  However, if you want an INSTRUCTIONAL dvd, buy Anasma Liquid Fusion or Elisheva Pop & Lock instead.",1262044800,2,793,4.458333333333333
3684598,5,B001LK4CFW,"I love this tape because it has several features that I have not found in other recently-published tapes: 1) a combination of extremely fluid, beautiful movement and percussive movement, most of the new tapes seem to emphasize one or the other; 2) an extremely musical section on playing zills.  3) superb arm and especially hand movements.  Added to this is a lovely meditation and very exciting music.  Fayzah is a great dancer, and the nuances of her movements are mezmerizing.  I would also prefer some more drill time, but I am giving this tape five stars because of the above features.",1256515200,3,591,4.821782178217822
3684599,2,B001LK4CFW,"Uh-oh. This did not start well for me.

Let me put my review in context: Before watching this, I had just previewed the new Bellydance Hip Hop Liquid Fusion DVDs I had purchased in the same shipment, which were AWESOME and whose instructor (Anasma) has a wonderful, vibrant personality. I was not ready for the somewhat dull and mysti-flakeish instruction I was about to receive on this DVD. Lemme explain: I love relaxing, I enjoy yoga, I will even admit to having used some lavender essential oil to help me sleep once upon a time, but I did not expect to receive a totally out-of-context lesson on how to use essential oils to meditate on my Tribal Fusion Bellydance DVD.

OK. Won't dwell on that. Just got me off to a bad start is all. There were some good points:
The use of ""animal movements"" was an interesting concept, what with the smooth fluidity then the burst of movement. Some of the moves in this section were useful to me. I found a few ideas I'd like to incorporate into my practice.

Here's the thing that bugged me: I found that even in the ""burst of movement"" phase, Fayzah lacked a certain energy I was looking for in an instructor, and the resulting choreographies were very similar to ones I have seen on other instructional DVDs. Even though there were some good concepts and good ideas, it didn't result in anything spectacular or eye-catching.

It's not that this DVD is bad. The production is pretty good. It's easy to watch, the sound is fine. It just didn't blow me away with its originality or purpose. Middling. Mediocre. OK.

I like my 4s and 5s to really count for something, so I gave this a 2, even though it wasn't a complete waste of time.",1255305600,4,1675,4.496710526315789
3684600,2,B001LK4CFW,"I was mostly just curious about this dvd, having seen some of her performances online- I was unsure if this would be a style of tribal fusion I could get into.
Fayzah has a wonderful dance foundation and several unique dance combos and ideals. The disc is full of information and if you have had at least a few years of bellydance AND yoga experience, I would suggest this- just as something to help build your own style on. She's clearly been dancing a very long time and her basic ability is on par with dancers like Ariellah. I really liked how much information is on this disc,there is a lot of information covered.

However, if you have not been properly instructed in yoga you need to skip her stretching section as she barely skims the surface of each stretch and a novice can hurt themselves.  Remember- lower spine compression is very bad for you! I really hated all the crotch shots we get on the disc in her garter pants and super mini skirts. This is something meant for different styles of dance, not bellydancers. Don't crotch your audience! They don't need to see your underoos!

Over all, just wasn't my taste, I didn't dig her performances at all. You might though.",1255132800,4,1182,4.539906103286385
3684601,4,B001LK4CFW,"I love Fayzah's technique and style. She is very unique. I also like the way she explains how she choreographs to different types of music. The only issue I have is there is a lack of drilling with each move. All in all, this is still ranked as a favorite.",1253836800,2,256,4.14
3684602,4,B001LK4CFW,"I have been wanting to learn how to bellydance for awhile now and i seen a clip of this video and loved the type of bellydance she was doing. I like how she starts with talking about essential oils. Then she goes on to a warm up and then teaching the moves. At the end she does performances and teaches you how to do them. I love how it is sort of a mix of hip hop and bellydance. It is very hard to learn, she makes it look so easy but it is hard. I keep practicing and i'm slowly starting to get it. I would recommend this DVD to anyone I am really enjoying it, it is so different than the typical bellydance videos.",1253491200,,618,3.9126984126984126
3684603,3,B001LK4CFW,"I was being generous when I gave it 3 stars - more like 2.5. This goes fast! You must have a background in belly dancing in order to keep up. I can dance, but with some of the belly dance moves that are new, she doesn't go over them enough before moving on. I even paused the DVD at times in order to practice the moves over and over but after that, when she shows the routine, it is rushed over and I don't get to exaggerate or actually do the move properly. I wound up getting frustrated and gave up.",1253404800,4,502,3.98019801980198
3684604,4,B001LK4CFW,"This program is definitely beyond basics. If you have been dancing for a time and tribal fusion has your curiousity, take your intermediate or advanced moves a step further with Fayzah `s  creation of Fluid tribal Style!
To begin, a welcome for viewers with a brief overview of the contents of the program  which includes:
A chat about essential oils and personal ritual and meditation
Fantastic warm up with yoga postures
""Reference section"" of tribal moves and a flow section to use as practice
Short segment on zil types,rhythms with dance demonstrations
Choreography break down for Bounty Killer
Fayzahs interpretations of her unique tribal style choreographies to different music genres.

If you are a beginner, this program may be a goal to work up to. For intermediates, the dance structure and key components of Fayzah program are ideally categorized and the menu options of the dvd present them in a user friendly fashion. Here,they are easy to navigate to using the repeat option will give the viewer the repetions of the chapters as needed. At times, I felt the instructor moved too quickly from one move to the next, so I opted to repeat each chapter automatically by setting the repeat mode on my dvd player remote.

The tribal fusion foundation movement is a fantastic training, which in my opinion makes the program worth every minute and cent invested into it. Fluid and staccato arms and hand movement, percussive hip moves which are intricate and richly layered and  implemented into the ""Bounty Killer"" choreography. Although brief, the demonstrations on walking, turning, using the chest, headslides, abdominal isolating, popping, and articulating hands, training the arms, using loose hip shimmies, (just to name a few), are also included. This fabulous dancer's  versatility in movement accommodates various music genres as well including jazz. This is definitly beyond basic belly dancing!

Fayzh appears delicate and soft spoken but watching her move is obvious of her muscle control. Her costumes are  not over done yet tasteful, allowing her femininity and grace to come through with less of appearing harsh, robotic and mechanical.

It was easy to become totally engrossed in the foundation section. Time seemed to pass me by as I dilligently worked on the dramatic ""fierce isolations"". I didn't especially like the Bounty Killer choreography but there is much beneift from the foundation section.
The ""movement play flow""  takes the viewer into  turns, walks, and combinations previously shown. ""Slow Washer Woman""  is a fabulous combination to learn. The down to earth terminology is a change from technical jargon as she defines her combinations.
Fayzah presents several dance performances and it is obvious overall, the elements in dance foundation remain. The modern concept of dance integrated from belly dance basics makes this style perfect for the day. Because art changes and evolves, I am open to new styles and keep an open mind. Knowledge is a continuous journey so learning from this program and implementing the richness of fluidilty, and defining isolations enrich my personal style.

When reviewing a program I usually look for three main points:Presentation, technique and end results. There are strong points in all of these. This style is attainable if you choose to invest time and patience. Video instruction is not a substitute for training with a qualified instructor.

The music and settings feel familiar and Fazyzh is vivid amongst beautifull lighting effects against a clean background. If I were to find faulit, I would venture to say that personal rituals such as the  section on essential oils, meditation, feel more like ""fillers"" and are too personal.",1252972800,,3711,5.203020134228188
3684605,2,B001LK4CFW,"After viewing once, I do not pick it up again.

It seems she keeps talking more than getting us to drill on the techniques.

Talking is not a problem but please give us some time to learn from the talks by drilling instead of moving on immediatley to other things.

Just not my type; guess others may like it.",1252454400,2,309,4.203389830508475
3684606,5,B001LK4CFW,"I have owned probably more than 30 bellydance dvd's and I have only reviewed a few that really impress me. After watching this just a few times, I am already naturally adding these movements to my repetoire. It is one of those dvd's that you watch the movements and then just do them. She simply explains the moves and I am able to replicate the movements, unlike with other dvds. I have tried other tribal choreography dvd's etc, but haven't found one as complete as this one and as easy to follow. This one has all those signature type moves that make tribal bellydance so awesome. This dvd and Saida's first dvd with Mario Kirlis are the two most influential dvds in really transforming my dance.
This dvd has basics and moves into more complex movements, so I will be using it for a long time.
The only thing I didn't care for is the meditation section, but everything else is awesome! Thanks a lot Fayzah, great job!",1251331200,12,921,4.488095238095238
8318330,5,B001LK4CFW,I really enjoy this dvd.  I am able to use most of it.  The personality of Fayzah is warm and inviting.  I feel that she offers a great deal of information and useful moves.,1429142400,,173,4.029411764705882
8318331,3,B001LK4CFW,"I didn't find this video very helpful as I had already spent over 6 years in bellydance classes I was hoping to pickup some new tricks, but it seemed like all the stuff covered in this was the basics.",1422921600,,200,4.153846153846154
8318332,3,B001LK4CFW,"This DVD is hard to review.  I think for a select group of people this is exactly what you've been looking for, which makes me want to give it an A++, BUT for everyone else you are going to be lost and annoyed by it.  Pros: Ton of information on here--you would have to watch it over and over again for all of it to sink in.  Another plus is that this is truly for the advanced tribal fusion dancer--lots of choices available for beginners, very few for experienced dancers.  The downside is that many movements are very difficult and only shown once, and you will wear out your rewind button before you get the move unless you already kind of have a grasp of it.  If you are familiar with other forms of belly dance but not tribal fusion, you will still be lost.  It's only slightly better than simply watching a video of a tribal fusion performance and hitting pause/rewind until you learn it on your own.  There also is very little Arabic culture, imagery, or belly dancing left in her style.  I think if you are an advanced tribal fusion dancer, BUY THIS DVD!  Everyone else:  meh.",1390953600,,1085,4.38
8318333,2,B001LK4CFW,"do not purchase this dvd if you are wanting instruction on how to do these techniques. all of the techniques listed on the dvd are shown once in a broken down form. then she goes straight into the move at full speed. each move is worked on about twice then she moves on to the next one. this is more of a demonstration dvd than an instructional dvd. fayzah is a wonderful dancer,but as far as teaching this dvd is not a good one to purchase. if you allready know these moves and want a little more demonstration, than this is for you. if your like me and a beginner looking for something to view to help practice between classes,skip this one. i did like the zill section but other than that im disappointed.",1358467200,2,708,4.291044776119403
8318334,5,B001LK4CFW,"This is one of the best belly dance videos I've viewed to date - one of my top three.

Now I understand more when I watch dances like Zoe Jakes!  And she breaks it down so that I'll eventually learn to do it.  Yet, it doesn't stay in one spot long - this video is always moving forward.",1292371200,,286,3.896551724137931
8318335,3,B001LK4CFW,"Let me begin by saying that I think Fayzah is an AMAZING dancer and a great inspiration to watch. I was really looking forward to getting this. With that being said, I have been studying Tribal for a year and this is not a ideal DVD for a beginner. It moves very quickly so if you don't have any understanding of the Tribal vocabulary, do yourself a favor and save this DVD for later once you have all your basic ducks in a row.

I also found the way that everything was laid out to be a bit awkward. For instance there were minor drills in the warmup (or did the warmup suddenly become a drill... I can't say as that was not clear). Then she suddenly goes into a variety of movement but the breakdowns seem rushed and the video editing itself not very inspiring. Also, the fact that I can hear her breathing at times is a bit distracting.

Over all I am happy that Fayzah is sharing her great talent with us but I wish it was presented better so it would be easier to absorb. Hopefully next time.",1290470400,2,997,4.1875
8318336,3,B001LK4CFW,"I would not recommend this dvd to most people.  While she is entertaining to watch, the value is not really there.  She does not teach.  She pretty much does the movement and you are expected to copy her.  I have not finished the dvd yet because I dislike it that much.  There are so many videos on the market that focus on tribal that you can pretty much pick any other one and it will be at least as good, or possibly much better.  I gave her 3 stars because maybe someone who has studied with her will enjoy it.",1275091200,,514,4.09

Otherwise, if I consider this dvd as an instructional one, I'd give it only one star: many difficult combos are demonstrated only two or three times without giving you the chance to understand the machanics of the movements. Furthermore, Fayzah doesn't show you the movements from the back not even with a mirror.
The zill section is very poorly done and doesn't give you any explaination for the most common rhythms.
Definitely I'd suggest this dvd to a tribal fusion addicted bellydancer who is looking for new ideas.",1266019200,4,640,4.8807339449541285
8318339,5,B001LK4CFW,"This is an intermediate or advanced-beginner level video.

Before buying this video, I watched some video on the internet of Fayzah's style.  I liked her arms and hands, and hoped that I would learn some technique from her through this DVD.  Indeed, her instruction sections on hands and arms are by far the best I've ever seen in any bellydance videos. Most tribal fusion videos only explain floralias, but Fayzah demonstrates many hand positions, waves, circles, and other beautiful movements.  On days when I don't feel like practicing, I still put in her video and work on hands and arms. I like this section so much, in fact, that I haven't gotten through the whole DVD yet.  It was worth it just for what I've seen so far.

She does move really quickly through the movements, without repeating very much, so I find myself skipping back to the ones I want to repeat.  The nice thing is that ""skipping"" back only jumps one or two movements, rather than long segments.
This makes it easy to ""rewind"" so to speak and re-watch only what I want to.

I've purchased about 10 other tribal-fusion videos, but I LOVE this one!  Most videos teach choreography or combinations that I can't remember.  Fayzah teaches strong, independent movements that can easily be combined in improvisation, an approach I prefer.

I really like the meditation warm-up.  Lighting a candle and meditating on the breath help me center.  Most bellydance videos warm-up by stretching, and I have trouble getting into the mindset where I feel like stretching--I would rather just start dancing.  Fayzah's approach of gentle mindful centering has helped me focus and become more present in my practice.  And that's what bellydance is really about, isn't it?  Quieting the mind and really being in the body.

I did skip to the end and watch the performance sections.  I really enjoy Fayzah's style--her movements are feminine and strong, smooth and flowing contrasting with sharp accents.

I love this video!!!",1262304000,6,1980,4.909638554216867
