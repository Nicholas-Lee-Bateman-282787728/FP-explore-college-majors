Both Piper and Chiba were great in the fight scenes, and had  the script although could have been a bit better, wasn't actually that bad.  The only problem was that 1 or 2 scenes were badly written, For instance,  the scene where Ms. Keeler is caught trespassing and Piper comes to her  rescue was annoyingly bad and unnecessary overall. The one surprising thing  was the supporting acting was fairly good, with the exception of Deron  McBee who needs to go back to American Gladiators. The acting by Piper was  quite good as always and i would love to see what he could do with a good  script and cast. The best example of Pipers acting was at the beginning of  the movie in the inital fight scene which was well choreographed, and quite  comical with the addition of Chiba. Overall, I can't say it's one of the  best movies ever made, but, as an action movie it's Really good. And anyone  who si a fan of They Live will love this.",966816000,9,1098,4.297560975609756

7849579,2,6303542395,"Judging this movie from the extremely cheezy bad acting in the opening scene I expected to HATE this movie. It wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be but it wasn't all that great either. Judging this movie from it's name, I thought it would be about 2 cops travelling to a mysterious island to find their partner's killer & end up being forced to fight in an underground fight league or something similar to Mortal Kombat. After Rowdy Roddy & his partner walked into the mansion, started fighting & got caught up in the fight contest, Rowdy Roddy did what he did best, he got Rowdy!!! My favorite parts of this movie were the fight scenes where he got to fight (I just wish there were more of them) The movie would've been way better if it were about an underground fight league or had more fighting. I wouldn't say Immortal Combat was boring but there are times where it seems to.......... lag (I guess you could say) It's worth watching at least once especially if you're a fan of Rowdy Roddy Piper, a HUGE pro wrestling fan like I am (Of course) or just looking for something cheezy to watch",1494547200,,1101,4.375609756097561
7849580,4,6303542395,Sonny Chiba has always had a variable output but among his Japanese films are many of the best Martial Arts movies from anywhere. His American movies are less impressive but this one is the best of his U.S. efforts. Roddy Piper and Chiba play off each other very well and the only slow points in this film are the scenes without Sonny. If your Chiba collection is to have one of his non Japanese films than this is the one to have!,1440201600,,431,4.2682926829268295

7849586,5,6303542395,". . . is what should read above the title.  But, unfortunatly, the acadamy does not think the same way that I do.  I believe that this is Roddy Piper's best movie, even better than They Live (which also is great, I suggest you give it a look).  Sonny Chiba is great, the story is great, the fighting is great, everything about this movie is, well . . . incredable.  Pick this up before it is gone, you will not be unhappy with your selection.",1083283200,3,442,4.1647058823529415
7849587,1,6303542395,"Don't listen to that ludicrous 5 star rating, this film is among the worst ever in the world of the martial arts.  Roddy Piper just blows and it contains the most poorly choreographed fights I've ever seen for this reason.  Chiba gets a chance to show off some impressive swordfighting but that's the only good scene in the whole damned thing and It's about 2 mins long.  To see Chiba do something decent check out The Streetfighter.",1016755200,,433,4.597402597402597
