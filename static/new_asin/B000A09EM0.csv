8070927,4,B000A09EM0,"A lower-class young man (Richard Harris) makes his mark as a particularly violent, tough rugby player, while trying, in his awkward, coarse way to seduce his landlady (Rachel Roberts).

Strong moments of acting, photography, and interesting use of fractured time mark Lindsay Anderson's feature debut.  This was a key film of the British New Wave cinema that helped moved English film towards gritty realism. (Ironic, considering Anderson's greatest films; 'If...."" and ""O Lucky Man"" are quite far from that kind of naturalistic realism).

Almost all critics consider it a masterpiece, but on first viewing both the performances and the writing were too theatrical for me to grant it quite that level of perfection.

But I plan to re-see it. As often with films one hears about for years, I may have been over-hyped, and missed some of its greatness. And even as is, I found it a strong, impressive and very worthwhile first feature, worth seeing if you have any interest in any of the elements; the cast, the moment in English history, Lindsay Anderson's great career as a director, etc.",1287446400,,1088,4.994475138121547
8070928,5,B000A09EM0,"My mom has always told me about this movie. We were amazed to finally find it on amazon. You can't even rent it in some places.
A strange Love story. Set in Ireland. She's is an older widow, good looking, with kids. He is a rugby Player. It's very tripped out the way this film unfolds, mysterious. pretty dark too, I'd say. Very thought provoking.
He is in Love with her, but she seemingly can't stand him. She considers him a stupid, big ape on the rugby field. Polishes her husbands shoes at the fireplace, he's forced to compete with his memory. He's tormented, is good to her and her kids, she's guilty over husbands seeming suicide. Very interesting, this movie. Wonderful acting performances from Richard Harris, and Rachel Roberts. A classic.",1208995200,,750,4.6893939393939394
