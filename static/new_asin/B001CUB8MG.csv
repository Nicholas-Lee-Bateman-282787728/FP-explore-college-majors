8289579,4,B001CUB8MG,"UFO Files: Russian Roswell is filled with many fascinating claims about UFO sightings, dogfights, crashes, and recoveries - but the information never really rises above the level of speculation.  The centerpiece of the show is the supposed crash of a UFO on the top-secret base at Kapustin Yar in 1948, an event I must admit I have never heard of over the course of a couple of decades of armchair ufology.  It's a humdinger of a story, complete with a UFO-MIG dogfight in the skies and the destruction of both fighting vehicles, so I naturally wondered why this story was unknown to me - and why the facts of the case are rather few and far between in this video.  A few Internet searches later, though, I realized that just about the only information out there about this supposed crash comes from this very documentary - that doesn't mean it didn't happen, but it's definitely going to take more than interviews with a few Russian KGB officials, MIG test pilots, and Stanton Friedman to make me give it any serious weight.

What is not in doubt is the fact that Kapustin Yar was an incredibly important site during the Cold War; in fact, the first U2 spy plane mission was to photograph this top-secret Soviet base.  This is the place where much of the Soviet Union's missiles, aircraft, and other technologies of war were designed and tested, with the most top secret work done underground in Zhitkur, the base underneath the base at Kapustin Yar.  If the Soviets did recover the wreckage of any alien ships, there is little doubt that the materials would have been taken here.  They definitely wanted such technology, as fighter pilots were instructed to approach and attempt to shoot down any unidentified flying objects in the years following World War II.

The documentary spends a significant amount of time giving us a rundown of supposed UFO sightings and crashes over the course of Russian/Soviet history, going as far back as 950 AD.  The only truly substantiated story is that of the destructive crash of some fiery object in the remote region of Tunguska in 1908.  Science has advanced several explanations for this unprecedented and mysterious event, but it still remains a mystery.  According to this documentary, one of Stalin's scientists retrieved bits and pieces of a UFO in the area and brought the materials to Kapustin Yar.  The research conducted on those samples and the supposed pieces of the local 1948 UFO crash supposedly gave the Soviets the advantage they needed to routinely beat America in the early years of the space race.  It's all just speculation, really, as are the brief accounts we are given of other UFO crashes in the Soviet Union and surrounding areas, the most recent of which dates to 1997.

The makers of Russian Roswell claim that the documentary offers the general public a never-before-seen look at U2 reconnaissance photos of Kapustin Yar, takes viewers on a virtual tour of what the Zhitkur underground base supposedly looked like, and includes newly acquired, top secret video supposedly showing the fiery results of two UFO crashes on the base.  On June 3, 1960 - apparently as a form of retaliation against the Soviets routinely attempting to shoot down their craft, two UFOs supposedly flew kamikaze missions that succeeded in destroying several rocket launch pads and a fuel depot on the base.  The video consists of only a few seconds, and the only conclusion one can draw from watching it is that it does show a large fire somewhere.  The documentary also fails to ask why UFOs, which supposedly used particle beam weapons to shoot down a MIG in 1948, would choose to crash themselves rather than merely fire upon the designated targets.

All in all, Russian Roswell relates a number of fascinating stories, but it offers very little in the way of proof for any of them.  Perhaps more information will soon filter out from the vaults and archives once guarded so assiduously by our Cold War enemies (although that is doubtful during Putin's never-ending reign), but for now the accounts related in this documentary can only be regarded as speculative at best.",1267401600,,4119,4.85021398002853
8289580,3,B001CUB8MG,"In 1948 a cylinder appears over top secret base Kapustin Yar - seen both on radar and by a MIG pilot. The pilot attacks, both crash.  An underground facility there was used for ICBM construction etc. - however, ""Russian Roswell"" alleges it was also used to reverse engineer UFO remains.

Numerous allegations of MIG vs. UFO encounters are referenced, none with compelling evidence.

Bottom Line:  Secrecy and UFO stories don't go well together.",1225756800,,444,5.041095890410959
