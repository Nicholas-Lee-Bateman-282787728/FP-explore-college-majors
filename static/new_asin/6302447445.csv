7826506,5,6302447445,"This filmed performance of the rarely performed Delius opera, using actors for the visuals and the justly famous Mackerras recording for the sound couldn't be lovelier.  The handsome young actors portraying the lovers are age appropriate and the settings and costumes are time appropriate.  The famous 'Walk To The Paradise Garden' is one of the most beautiful musical segments in all of opera and here it is paired with the lushly ideal visuals.  I'm not a big fan of 'lip-synched' opera but in this case it works very well.  If you are an opera lover looking for a 'new' work to experience, this may well be what you are seeking.",1360368000,,631,4.709090909090909
7826507,5,6302447445,"Few 20th century composers have written more haunting music than Frederic  Delius. Mostly we are familiar with his orchestral works, but a few scores  (his settings of Whitman's poetry and the Mass of Life) are enough to  convince us that he is a major composer of vocal music. This recording does  full justice to his opera, which has a lot more than the ""Walk to the  Paradise Gardens."" Perhaps someday we will have a video of J. E.  Flecker's verse play ""Hassan"" along with Delius' music, which  rivals Grieg's music for Ibsen's ""Peer Gynt.""",965606400,4,544,4.723404255319149
