M.F. Hussain crafts an engrossing, magical, abstract film with such beauty and surrealism, that it's hard for any lover of art to NOT fall in love with this masterpiece!

It's unfortunate that this film bombed and doesn't seem to have the following it truly deserves.
Tabu is magnificent! Her triple role act is a major feat, and her beauty is captured imaginatively by Santosh Sivan.

Seriously, this is an AWESOME movie and no amount of praise is enough!!
The music, in particular A.R.Rahman's sublime background score, elevates the film to greater heights and compliments the fascinating cinematography.

`Meenaxi' is one of those rare gems that never ceases to amaze and leaves the viewer spellbound!
ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!",1279756800,,830,5.088235294117647
