It is slightly reminiscent of the type of movie that ""Mystery Science Theatre"" used to show.  Although as I just said, I'm not even sure it would rate as a ""B-Movie"".

Regarding the script...in a word...scatterbrained.  The plot is all over the place.  If I hadn't read the two English translated books, I would've been even MORE lost, if that were possible.  I understand that, at times, something does get lost in translation but c'mon.  It is sub-titled, so one also has to read the horror.

Now.  Let's talk about ""special effects"".  This movie came out in 2002.  So, where oh where was the CGI?!  IMO, the lead special effects dude/dudette should be banned from the business.  (I bet Jim Henson would've been mortified.)

Finally, I wondered what Mr Sapkowski was thinking when he chose to title it ""The Hexer"".  I read somewhere that he preferred it for the title.  However, since the movie was so horrible, I suppose that's a good thing?  LOL!",1370131200,2,1121,4.63265306122449
