I will never watch this piece of crap again, nor will I ever buy anything to do with this worthless program again.  There are dozens of show on TV and on DVD that are are better.

5753857,5,B00CYQXATG,Amazing series! Great value! great series! Love this series!  Although definitely not kid friendly it is a great adult treat. The main characters are super engaging and you find you can get really emotionally invested. The writers and producers are genius and make each episode its own story. You can easily walk into the series at any point and get enough content information to know what is going on and not feel completely lost. The BAU team are thoroughly entertaining and their character plots are quite thought provoking. The content can be graphic at times but not over the top. There are multiple story lines going simultaneously but it's done eloquently so you get just enough critical detail to remember from episode to episode. When applicable they give review segments before the episode so viewers can get caught up on crucial details from previous episodes that are relevant to what you are about to watch further deepening your understanding of the narrative. You leave each episode emotional and excited about what is going to happen next. It's easy to get wrapped up in the mind and workings of the BAU. I love that the focus isn't targeted exclusively at the murderers but rather the development of the profile and thought process of the information analysis as well as relationship between main characters. It's engaging and thought provoking. I can't wait to watch more!,1458000000,,1390,4.965665236051502

5754024,3,B00CYQXATG,"First, I love the series. The discs were good quality. I only had a problem with one which was either in the first or second season. I'm up to season 8 now. With this one disc it would not move from episode to episode unless I stopped the disc - opened and closed - then did a restart. It had to be done to get to every episode.

My huge problem is this. I have seasons of my favorite shows. I have them displayed on shelves. Yet, this *new* season of Criminal Minds had to be hidden behind a different DVD shelf which covered up the series. Why? Because the outside covering of every single season looked like it was at least a decade old. The corners were worn off. The shiny outside covering was completely worn to white in all four corners. Season one even had the top back cover torn across the back. Not cut like a box cutter. But worn off and torn as if it had been opened so many times it had worn through.

I was shocked to say the least. I just received season 10 and it looked like a new DVD set with a new outside cover.

All 9 seasons are not box sets.
Season 5, 6, 7, 8 were the regular plastic DVD case rather than the box set. The box sets have damaged boxes. Make it feel like they just slammed together sets that were rolling around in the warehouse. Haven't run the disks yet so not sure if there are any defects--I hope not.

5754029,4,B00CYQXATG,"In a couples back yard, bodies were being dug up. The black man had killed 8 men that had castrated him in the 60's and 2 of their daughters. The only thing I didn't like about the show was that the agent Dave Rossi said he had kept a black boy in a locker and leaked on him. I don't blame the black man for killing the men but I don't think they had to let Rossi say this about himself when all it did was disgrace his character. This team is suppose to have good morels and respect and that just took away something from Rossi's role. It could have been so much better. But all in all Criminal Minds is the best program on TV. It would only be better if Emily Printiss was still on the show. I hope they keep it like criminal minds and not have so much of the show about their personal lives.

5754282,5,B00CYQXATG,"I think Criminal Minds must be improving with the seasons as this seems to be one of the best I've watched. I loved the introduction of Rochelle Aytes as Shemar Moore's new girlfriend as she is one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen. I was also glad to see Will return as J. J.'s husband, but wish we could see more of him in the future. I wish Beth, Hotchner's girlfriend, had shown up more with Blake's husband. I guess Blake won't be back next season. I was just beginning to warm up to her at the end of last season. Nearly all of the stories were interesting, though a few were predictable, and 200 was a disappointment. Also, I think they should re-introduce a bit of mystery as in earlier episodes of earlier seasons. I did really the flashback episode on Penelope Garcia who I love as a character.",1429401600,,815,4.333333333333333

5754335,5,B00CYQXATG,"This show just keeps getting better. The stories remain disturbing, but solidly written taken from today's headlines. All of this stuff could happen or has happened in some way shape or form. The only show out there that is better than this show is the new Hawaii 5'0. I highly recommend all 9 seasons of Criminal Minds, it will blow your mind, no pun intended.  The stories are based out of the behavioral department of the FBI called BAU, they help law enforcement all over the world, mostly here in our nation, but will only step in if asked or if the crime is a federal level crime. Often resented by those they are trying to help their jobs are very difficult. But, they always find the unknown subject (UNSUB) who has perpetrated the crime or crimes. During the series they have lost one or more of their own, so no one is safe from the ax of death. Unlike many other series where you know they character will survive.

It's a great show that will have you coming back for more. Buy it, you'll be glad you did.

I am as a kid in front of a Christmas tree, I wait the season 10....Personally,  prefer between your original voices, although the French voices are good, but that does not make the same way. Hearing your voice, I makes me more aware of your acting talent. and anyway, I prefer the original voice of Thomas Gibson that his French voice, although it is pleasant to hear, and it suits him.

5754673,3,B00CYQXATG,"I can't seem to stop watching this even though I think it's not that great. I like the characters and the insights into the motivations/minds of the criminals. Despite this, I don't think the writing is very good. The main characters often explain things to each other in a way that doesn't make sense because they are all experts in the field. It makes more sense when they are explaining things to people who aren't on the team, but then they will often take turns speaking in a way that seems unnatural - like they're reading from a script. Normal coworkers don't complete each other's sentences in this way. I like the Garcia character and her jokes, but her superfluous comments disrupt the flow of the dialogue. When they are talking about serious issues and time is of the essence to prevent a murder, it's annoying to have this one person wasting time with unnecessary commentary. I'd like it better if she limited her lightness and humor to times when they're not actively working on a case.

The crimes depicted in this show are the height of depravity. They make the Law and Order crimes look like childhood pranks in comparison. They don't often show the most violent acts, but they do often show the victims afterward and I sometimes have to look away because it's too horrifying. In the early seasons, I felt like there was too much emphasis on men as violent freaks and women as fragile victims, but in later years there is more gender balance.",1417392000,,1459,4.633204633204633
5754674,5,B00CYQXATG,always had a great experience with Amazon until prime! Prime must be driven by different administration! And is a rip off!,1417392000,,122,4.857142857142857
5754675,4,B00CYQXATG,"I just finished watching the entire Season this Thanksgiving Weekend and was very impressed with the acting and story lines.  I'm  almost always on the edge of my seat.  The men on the show are as handsome  as ever.  I'm not too crazy about Shemar's on screen girlfriend, though.  Not the right fit IMO.  A.J. & Kirsten are as adorable as they are talented.  Although  Jeanne is ok, I  miss Paget and am  glad  she had a Cameo in one of the episodes.  The Crew, as  ever, did an amazing job in projecting the  gory details of the scenes of the costars, i.e. the Rabid episode which to me, although entertaining, was hard to watch.  All in all, Criminal  Minds is the best,  Hands Down.  Keep up the good work  and congratulations on a 10th Season.",1417305600,,747,4.352941176470588

But this was his birthday gift (along with a few previous seasons) and it was the perfect birthday gift for him.",1413504000,,381,4.191780821917808
5754861,5,B00CYQXATG,"Saturday night of the Columbus Day weekend I watched the first two disks of Season 9. OMG!! You better have a strong stomach, Be be prepared for a bunch of surprises. The quality of the DVDs was excellent. The stories were full of tension, too clever unsubs, more clever BAU team members, explosions, meat cleavers, strong actting, visiting cities, time running out, and great music (though the music from the ""CODA"" episode will always be my favorite).

On Sunday, I watched three more disks. I am just sorry there are only six disks. I am saving the sixth disk because I don't want the season to be over. I will be watching them again and again. I'm embarassed to confess that I watched this series for the first time just last year. I spent the past year watching Seasons 1 - 8 and was very happy to purchase Season 9 just as Season 10 began on TV. I anticipate buying Season 10 next year.  I'm spoiled now. I can't stand the tension of waiting each week to see episodes one at a time, I already do that with HANNIBAL and GRIMM. I've already missed two episodes of GOTHAM and the season just began!! Thank God for Primetime On Demand.

Of course, one of the best things about this series is the comraderie of the team. Seeing them laugh and smile at the end of two of the episodes was so uplifting after so much blood shed, family grief, and innocent lives loss. If you like Penelope's quirkiness, smooth super sexy Derek Morgan chasing bad guys, serious Hotch, the deadpan humor of Rossi, a grownup Spenser, a gorgeous smart tough JJ, seeing the jet and the great scenary in the backgound, the linguist who has grown on me, and now a new team supervisor buy this DVD set. I deliberately ordered it so I'd have the long Columbus Day weekend to watch as many episodes as possible.",1413331200,,1782,4.460122699386503

5755054,5,B00CYQXATG,"Once again we have another outstanding season to the greatest TV series that I have EVER seen! Naturally I HIGHLY recommend this to fans of Criminal Minds, I will admit it had one episode I didn't care for and also there was one that didn't feel so much as a Criminal Minds episode as it did a 40 minute PG-13 version of Wrong Turn or The Hills Have Eyes, but it was a good episode, and an obvious homage to horror movie's considering it has two actors who've starred in a lot of them, it's not by any means a bad episode, it just didn't feel like Criminal Minds. Anyways, this season has a lot of surprises to be had, and the last two episodes are REALLY  intense, I genuinely thought my favorite character was going to die, and... Does he? Watch the show to find out, \ I usually do not fall for it because it almost NEVER happens, and we know this, but this honestly, wasn't like the other times, also we have a character who leaves at the end of this season, I do feel that could have been handled a little better, but it was sufficient, I won't miss this person, the character never really added much to the show any more than this person gave anything. I would however prefer no one to take this persons place, I feel that the main people we've always had are the ONLY people we NEED. These seasons are getting more and more gutsy and graphic in content and taking more and more chances, that's both positive and negative, but I trust that they won't take it to far to where the show goes downhill, it's truly remarkable that 9 seasons in and this show is just as strong as ever, I can't think of one show that hasn't had at least one season that was less than perfect or outstanding, not even my other three favorite shows Breaking Bad which season 5 was less than perfect or outstanding, or the couple Buff the Vampire Slayer seasons or the 3-4 seasons of House, M.D. and that is saying a lot when almost ALL TV shows will have one season that is showing signs of overstaying it's welcome, especially when it's this many seasons, because those other three show's I mentioned never made it to a 9th season. I hope that Criminal Minds will stay as long as it's able to maintain the way it's been and end before it overstays it's welcome and gets boring or stupid. So far it's still on and going strong! If you've seen this show and have the other seasons and love them, then get this season for sure and have no worries about it, if you've never seen this show and only have seen shows like Law & Order, CSI, Monk, or Castle, well abandon those throw away silly shows and get this true hardcore adult crime show that is unlike any show crime or otherwise you've ever (or never seen), buy ALL the seasons and have yourself a ""killer"" good time!

5755340,5,B00CYQXATG,"Creepy?  You betcha.  And not for everyone.  But I am amazed at how the quality of the writing and the acting has kept up thru the years.  And you'd be hard-pressed to find a show that has survived the cast changes that this one has.  When Mandy Patinkin left the series (for reasons that i've never heard stated), i thought the show would lose its edge.  When Lola Gladini was written out of the show, they lost an interesting and multi-layered character and again i thought the show would suffer.  And when Paget Brewster was written off the show, again i thought it would crumble.  And when Jeanne Tripplehorn ....an unheralded actress who appeared in pretty nondescript productions....joined, i thought ""this is it...the show is dead.""  But in each of these cases, I was wrong.  So I applaud the writers and producers for continuing the quality of the show.
That said.....please! don't keep this show going when and if it starts going downhill.  That would be a disservice to the actors and the audience.",1410307200,,1008,4.735632183908046

My goal is to of course is to buy every season - I just have to budget my purchases!

One complaint Thomas Gibson is the leader of his team.  When will he finally get top billing?  Although I really like all the characters, Reid is the all time coolest.  I've always admired his ability to repeat his lines so well and his humor is hilarious.

It used to be so interesting where you try to figure out what's gong on with the characters as the show progresses but now it's almost procedural.

5755782,5,B00CYQXATG,I have watched every episode of Criminal Minds and season 9 is by far the best overall. The writing for season 9 is amped up and more suspenseful and mysterious. The writers and producers have outdone themselves this year.,1402531200,,222,4.717948717948718

5755850,5,B00CYQXATG,"I'm not one for rape and murder shows, but this show is not all about serial killers and rapes.  I found that I began to care about the 'team' and their lives more than the criminals and their crimes.  I didn't even care how the team solved the crime, I only cared about them and how these criminals and their crimes affected each member.  I don't know if this is the purpose of the show, but that's why I bought the series and watch it every week.",1401148800,,448,4.126436781609195

5755895,5,B00CYQXATG,I've been watching this series since it began.  By it's 9th season you'd think they'd be out of ideas - but acting is wonderful and the story lines are still not easy to predict.,1400457600,,178,4.235294117647059

5755897,5,B00CYQXATG,This is one of my favorite shows since it's premier. The cast is great and the shows are still able to be innovative and exciting. I only watch about 3 tv shows and this one is a 'don't miss' one.,1400371200,,196,3.925

This crew of actors have great chemistry , sitting , although me personally could due with a little less Garcia , but bravo and keep it coming !",1399593600,,260,4.22
5755924,5,B00CYQXATG,Criminal Minds is dark and cerebral. It's amazing that some of these type of crimes and criminals exist in our society. The show really expresses the emotional angst and commitment that law enforcement officials endure to solve these types of crimes.,1399507200,,250,5.121951219512195
5755925,5,B00CYQXATG,"What can I say as a fan of Criminal Minds except from year one to and through year 9...without exception, there has been nothing but perfectly well done shows that keep me on edge of my seat...pressure rises and then here and there something happens that calms us down...a small victory perhaps.
Then next show is another that I find I am telling anybody that will listen to me...proof that good crime drama can be done and done repeatedly with hard work, imagination...make it as real, true as they can, then add the cast that CM has. Wow, it would be one long review if I started with Hotch, JJ, Morgan and Reid, etc...all of them make this show what it is...the best ever. I like all equally but Reid and JJ sure keeps me in anything they do, as I see progress to and changes as Reid gets older and experiences life with that amazing character he plays...then JJ who has to be mesmerizing all men who watch CM...but more than that Grace Kelly beauty, her character has taken on an amazing strength as she is a great profiler...reminds me of Hotch with that quiet, steady, steely mind and a strength of body and mind that is something to watch. The greatest crime drama ever...Criminal Minds.
I have all soon to be 9 seasons when it releases and when some reading, etc, is done and showtime starts for me, if it is CM then I am all wrapped up for some time.",1399334400,5,1359,4.375494071146245

5755927,2,B00CYQXATG,"I love this show and have been a fan from the beginning. There are only two things I hate about this season, one the actors playing director, those episodes turn out to be horrible and the actors have less screen time but my biggest complaint is the character of Agent Blake. She is ruining the show for me and I have been a die hard fan from the first episode. I almost cant bare to watch it anymore. They should have just left that role empty after Prentiss left the show. I also wish they would go more into the Agent's personal lives like they used to.",1399075200,,556,4.205607476635514
5755928,5,B00CYQXATG,"Yes people, there have been many changes to the show and I don't like all of them. I especially miss Prentiss,but I still love this show and can't believe people watch it this far and are still complaining about it. No one makes anyone watch any TV show and if people don't like a show they should just STOP WATCHING IT.As for me I watched it from the very first episode and because I work graveyard I have rarely seen it on its regular night but I wait avidly every year for it to come out on DVD and I always get it. I especially love the episodes about Penelope,She is my favorite",1399075200,,583,4.168141592920354
5755929,4,B00CYQXATG,"Love Criminal Minds!  My reasons include that it is a police procedural; that it involves interesting characters; and that there are fascinating quotes at the start and finish.  That said ...

There has been a disturbing trend in American tv, where no one can be a good guy - i.e. they either have to have a dark past or be corrupted or otherwise have something beyond evil & disturbing happen to them.  I'm bunking into it again - I went to watch the show were JJ is kidnapped, figuring this is going to be the BAU rescuing her from serial killer type ... instead, it is about a secret in her past work life (which we've also been through w/ Prentiss, who makes a reappearance here) and involves torture, which will definitely impact her as a person and her family life (again, a repeated theme:  Hotchner had the ideal family, and yet they were killed off; Garcia met a guy who turned out to be a nasty; need we mention Spencer Reed's first love?!).  I honestly don't know if I want to spend my valueable time watching the remainder of this particular show and may chose other episodes in here, instead -- or may just 'swear off' tv shows that do this to there main characters, which I've already done in one case.",1398729600,,1216,4.430493273542601
5755930,4,B00CYQXATG,"In a couples back yard, bodies were being dug up. The black man had killed 8 men that had castrated him in the 60's and 2 of their daughters. The only thing I didn't like about the show was that the agent Dave Rossi said he had kept a black boy in a locker and leaked on him. I don't blame the black man for killing the men but I don't think they had to let Rossi say this about himself when all it did was disgrace his character. This team is suppose to have good morels and respect and that just took away something from Rossi's role. It could have been so much better. But all in all Criminal Minds is the best program on TV. It would only be better if Emily Printiss was still on the show. I hope they keep it like criminal minds and not have so much of the show about their personal lives. Still love it.",1398470400,,809,3.9693251533742333

5755994,3,B00CYQXATG,"I loved this series and watched it for years. However, the roles and the dialog has become mechanical with a dialog written to fit the expected personality of characters played by great actors. This is downgrading the great team of actors, and is mainly due to the episodes writers. Their creativity appears to be drying out...The earlier Seasons' episodes did communicate to the spectator excitement by offering new discovery of nuances of the agents personalities, and interaction among them, under unexpected events of the story. This essential ingredient of the story, appears to have gone away...The success of the NCIS was based not as much on the events, inside the episode's story, as it was based on the dynamics between the characters of the agents. Criminal Minds actors should be given better stories with emphasis on the play between the personalities of the agents, and their professional mastery in solving the cases. The ""normal"" spectator does not identifies himself/herself with the criminal, nor needs the spectacle of the grotesque/sick actions of the criminals' upon the victim...The spectator identifies with the agents' characters, their professionalism and their struggles in facing criminal minds and actions while struggling to solve the case... If the writers cannot do better then there will be no future to this great series....",1397001600,5,1357,5.316279069767442

5756172,5,B00CYQXATG,I'm a huge fan of criminal minds. I some how had missed this episode and had watched it on amazon. And it was a good episode with Penelope's past. I would watch this again.,1394755200,,172,4.088235294117647
5756173,2,B00CYQXATG,"Criminal Minds is as good as it gets when it comes to weirdness. Their writers are genuinely twisted.

The real issue I have with Criminal Minds as well as ALL Amazon streaming videos is that you can't stream them to an Android tablet except for a Kindle unless you graduated with a degree in computer science.  Apparently there's a feud going on between Amazon, Google and Adobe that means that there's no Flash player available for the ENTIRE SERIES OF GALAXY TABLETS. What's odd is that there's an Amazon video player app for the iPad. I'm not saying it's impossible to do but inexplicably, Amazon who is ordinarily well-known for superior customer relations has put the entire burden on the customer to resolve. It's like we've been caught in corporate crossfire. It just doesn't seem right and fair, given that Amazon has the power to fix this.

You can, in certain circumstances stream Amazon video, but it involves, installing something called a ""Dolphin Browser"", the ""Dolphin Powerpack"", an old version of Adobe's Flash player and then tinkering with some settings. Does that sound like something the Amazon we know would make us do?",1394755200,,1142,4.9067357512953365
5756174,5,B00CYQXATG,This is a show that allows you to thing about the unsub and wonder what would be the motive for them to do the things that they do. I real love how the show is putting the charaters in more information about themselves on the personal level not just the job all the time. thank you for given me something to love forward to on every night of the week old and new,1394582400,,362,3.9726027397260273
5756175,5,B00CYQXATG,I have been watching this show since it started and I am still yet to be disappointed. Really good show,1394582400,,103,4.2
5756176,5,B00CYQXATG,"I have never seen an episode of Criminal Minds that I did not like. I always learn something from the Spencer Reed character. I especially like the way the Hotchner character is showing more emotion in this season. It is amazing that after 8 seasons there is still room for more character development, this is the key to long term success, it is what keeps characters from getting stagnant.",1394323200,,390,4.666666666666667
5756177,5,B00CYQXATG,I am sure this season will be as good as the rest of the seasons. They have great people writing this show.,1394323200,,107,3.909090909090909

5756181,5,B00CYQXATG,"All crime shows sometimes tend to follow a cookie cutter mold when it comes to their 45 min tv story--we all know how it goes. This season of criminal minds, however, attempts to break out of that mold in a few episodes. There is still a cookie cutter feel to it and if you watch 5 episodes at one time, it can get redundant. But there are also a few gems. There is a lot of character development in this season and much more contrast between the lighthearted silliness of characters versus the dark themes of crimes. And there are MANY references to past seasons, as far back as Gideon. As my husband said ""you know you're a hardcore criminal minds fan when they reference Gideon and you know exactly who they're talking about!""",1393891200,2,729,4.447761194029851

5756203,5,B00CYQXATG,"The show is very in-depth and exciting.  I believe the characters are very kind, caring and good people despite the level of evil they encounter.  I do not like the show quite as much as when Prentiss was in in.  Her replacement, in my opinion, does not work.  The other characters keep me watching it.",1393718400,,302,4.4363636363636365

5756206,4,B00CYQXATG,I think I've burned myself out on this show but the characters are good and the ideas for each bad guy from episode to episode. The formula gets predictable after a while but it holds up with that being said.,1393632000,,208,4.225

5756209,3,B00CYQXATG,"But it is time to wrap this up and finish it.  Things are dragging out too long, the characters have developed fully and now the story lines are becoming repetitive.

5756274,5,B00CYQXATG,I truly enjoyed it. I don't usually watch this show. My intuitions told me to look at this one. It kept my attention with the suspends and drama was intense.

5756317,4,B00CYQXATG,"I don't know that Amazon has any influence in this particular area, but I have been very disappointed that Emily Prentiss has been removed from all but a few isolated episodes, and I really don't like her replacement who does not seem to flow as well with the other team members.  Also, in the last episode, there was more violence to the ""good guys"" (the team members) than is usually typical of ""Criminal Minds"" episodes.",1392249600,,423,4.64

5756333,5,B00CYQXATG,"This was a very ""nail biting"" episode, but then, they all are. I've yet to see a boring Criminal Minds. If you've never seen an episode, you'd probably like it if you like Law & Order, Cold Case or any type of crime fighting show. Some scenes may be too gruesome for small kids. My son who's currently attending the Air Force Academy, was even a little frightened by one episode :).",1392163200,,382,4.319444444444445
5756334,5,B00CYQXATG,Criminal minds has the best crime fighting team on TV well since Law  and Order of course. I  like twists and turns of each case and I love how each character is given a chnace to have their own unique story told in midst of the team  chasing  down the worse of the worse criminal element.

5756371,5,B00CYQXATG,"This is such an amazing show with bizarre plot lines that always keep you guessing.  I'm glued to the television during each episode.  Most recently this one really brought back memories of the old Charles Bronson vigilante movies that I used to enjoy years ago.  It was also interesting to see Episode 12 ""The Black Queen"" and dig back into Garcia's dark past to see how she became a BAU team member.  I am never disappointed by this show and it never hurts to have some eye candy (JJ - actually all the ladies are gorgeous) to keep things interesting.  These writers know exactly what they're doing.

5756417,4,B00CYQXATG,This show is so good. I really enjoy all the characters but i think by fa my favorite is Dr. Reed. I think because I am a geek and can relate. I do miss the Mandy Patankin days though.,1390348800,,184,3.7435897435897436

5756419,5,B00CYQXATG,"I have watched all the seasons of Criminal Minds.  I like how they explore the past of each of the agents but through the cases and not directly.  I enjoy how they form their closer friendships and relationships because they work so much and you have learned over the years why they have their little quirks.  I also love that they are not perfect people...and the show doesn't portray them to be.  It is an incredibly difficult job and showing them interact with local law enforcement and how the characters have all evolved.  I have my fav characters but have loved them all over the years.  Season 9 has not disappointed.  This last episode about Garcia's past was intriguing.  While its not always easy to watch some of the horrific crimes, the cast is what makes it work and there is enough humor to keep you coming back.  This is by far one of my favorite shows of all times!  Love you guys!",1390089600,,897,4.447852760736196

5756421,5,B00CYQXATG,I am a huge fan of Criminal Minds. Watch every episode numerous time. Love them all. This one was exceptionally good because you didn't know who the silent partner was until the end. And Garcia stayed true to herself and the BAU team,1390089600,,233,4.441860465116279

5756439,5,B00CYQXATG,"I did not start watching Criminal Minds until a few months ago, when I batch watched a season at a time.  The advantage of this approach is that you can pull in the scope of the writing, see the unfolding of the ""story bible"" and arrangements of the characters depth.  In addition, the plots begin to show puzzling cross references, which are attached to real life events.  I like watching it as it reminds me of my afternoons as a teen watching the original Mission Impossible (TV).  From the first scenes my imagination was recruited to figure how they would solve the puzzle called their assignment.  The music was excellent and pushed the vibe of the story along in a good pace.  The team of composers Criminal Minds does an exceptional job in matching the scenes with  the emotions of the actors in their situations.  Greg St. John's photography is a classic signature piece of the show, in which he is really strong in matching the temperaments of the actors.",1389312000,,965,4.635294117647059

5756467,4,B00CYQXATG,"""Criminal Minds"" returns for its ninth season on CBS television in 2013-2014 with its marvelous cast intact and a terrific lineup of chilling new cases, to be solved by the special agents of the FBI's Behavior Analysis Unit (BAU). Macabre plots, an ensemble cast with well-developed characters, and dynamic teamwork continue to pull in viewers.

 At the end of last season, Assistant Director Erin Strauss was murdered by an unexpected killer with inside knowledge of the BAU, who stalked the entire team with considerable skill.  As Season Nine opens, and that killer presumed dead, speculation runs through the team that Hotchner might be given Strauss's job, pulling him out of day to day casework.  When a new BAU director is chosen, it turns out to be someone from JJ's recent and still secret past with another agency.  That past will come back to haunt JJ and the team in a critical episode, which turns out to be the 200th of the series.  Paget Brewster will make a return appearance as Emily Prentiss to be reunited with her old teammates for the case.

 Another exciting episode will have Hotchner in the hospital, when old wounds leave him in critical condition.  While his life hangs in the balance, he will be reunited with his wife, and her murderer.  The case's conclusion may be a turning point in Hotchner's life.  Another episode will have the agents chasing a killer who seems to be reliving the assassination of John F. Kennedy.  Still other story lines will have the agents jetting around the country to help local enforcement with difficult cases.  Although the weekly cases follow a familiar pattern, story twists indicate the show is not running out of originality.  ""Criminal Minds: The Ninth Season"" is highly recommended to its fans.",1388793600,,1760,4.902027027027027
5756468,5,B00CYQXATG,"Excellent quality. Thank you for providing me with the opportunity to  have one of my favorite shows at home.

5756470,5,B00CYQXATG,Haven't missed an episode since it piloted.  This is a show you can binge watch or jump in midseason.  A+,1388620800,,105,4.2

It's twists and turns intrigue me and I enjoy the character personalities and their shared relationships, The team covers specialized cases in different locations and solve extreme cases with by analyzing behavior which is extremely interesting to me.",1388534400,,269,5.428571428571429

5756483,5,B00CYQXATG,"I have been watching criminal minds since almost the beginning. I not only find it intriguing, but the team feels like family. Season 9 is a lot different, because they not only find really sick weirdos, but to think their are serial killers out there in real life that have done those crimes.",1388275200,,293,4.547169811320755
5756484,3,B00CYQXATG,"One can watch an episode of CM in about 25 minutes by fast-forwarding through the parts that feature the bad guy. You won't miss anything because the good guys' analysis will mention everything he's done anyway. And that will usually be ""He tortures scrawny young white women. But he's made a fatal mistake, and we'll nab him.""

I do have a problem with the way this show depicts women. They're almost always victims, and if they're getting any screen time at all, they are *always* scrawny. Even 2/3 of the smart, capable women on the BAU team look anorexic. Penelope Garcia is the only interesting one among themand she functions mostly behind the scenes as a deus ex machina, not as an in-the-field butt kicker.

As for the men, if they weren't visually different, you would hardly be able to tell them apart. They all play basically the same role.

I like the psychological analysis that solves the crimes, but the good guys are practically interchangeable.",1388102400,2,961,4.77710843373494
5756485,5,B00CYQXATG,Great story lines and group interaction continue to make Criminal Minds an interesting series!  The relationship between the characters in the BAU is the primary reason I continue to watch the series.  The shows writers contine to deliver interesting and frankly scarey story lines.,1388016000,,282,5.386363636363637
5756486,5,B00CYQXATG,I've been a fan of this series since it first aired. I haven't missed an episode yet. It has gotten more violent over the past few seasons and as long as they don't go too far like American Horror Story then I'll remain a fan. Because of my very busy schedule I'm so grateful to Amazon for offering these as digital downloads.,1387756800,,326,4.274193548387097

5756489,5,B00CYQXATG,"I have all the series except season 9 and when it comes out I will purchase it. I love this show from the first day I watched it and I have been hooked on it evry since I first watched it. What makes the show so remarkable is the players. I like all but 1 and that is Emily she just walked in and took over and I think JJ is much smarter than prentiss. I don't think she have more lines than JJ , Just because prentiss's mother has power I don't think prentiss should have more prestige than the other players. Personally I was glad when she left the show. The new girl that is older I like her better and she is not a show off like miss Emily Prentiss. I hope when prentiss comes back in season 9 that it is only for 1 episode. Bye Emily Prentiss and I hope JJ doesn't leave again I really like her.",1387238400,,800,3.914110429447853

5756503,5,B00CYQXATG,"I have watched every episode of Criminal Minds since they have been on the air. I own 2 seasons, season 8 and 9. I love how the actors in this series each have distinctive personallities and we get to see a little deeper into their lives each season. Garcia has come into the show over the years as an equal to the other BAU team members. Each member has their flaws and their shinning brilliant minds highlighted. The ability of these actors to do show after show of monsters and keep their heads straight is amazing. I have noticed over the years that many of the episodes are from real crimes that I have read about or seen on the news. So, you know that these monsters are real in our society. Not just really good writing by the writers of this show. The writing of the show really shines in letting us see the true character of each of the actors parts. I felt really bad when I read what Mandy Patinkin wrote about acting in Criminal Minds. If he hated it so much he should have left sooner. He was really boring in the part. Joe Mantegna really is about a 10 level jump from Mandy. The series took off with Joe on the show. I would say this is a 10 Star series. I hope we get another season in 2014!",1386720000,3,1207,4.162393162393163
5756504,5,B00CYQXATG,"I don't understand why Im drawn to this show, but I cant stop watching it. Is it the acting? Or the fact that the killer is alwys caught? Is it the puzzle? I do know this - this show gives me horrible nightmares and I still watch it!  My favorite character is Dr. Spencer Reid.  I definitely don't like watching the gruesome murders so I try to avoid the irst few minutes of each show.  I don't like reality murder shows because they rarely catch he killer.  I feel weird.",1386115200,,472,4.211111111111111

I like the way the team works together to solve mysteries, and while the info is not 100 per cent accurate necessarily, it still makes me want to know more about Criminal behavior.

5756509,5,B00CYQXATG,The best show on TV ! One of the few shows that have strong female roles without all the skin and sin in their lives.  Their show could very well be the news on the news is far worse!

5756534,1,B00CYQXATG,"When Mandy Patinkin was in the series it was at its height.  However, he moved on because the shows were quickly devolving and they became a little too physically and mentally violent for him.  Season 9 jumped the shark for me.  You don't always have to show the violence, sometime just suggesting it, allows the viewers to fill in the appropriate level of violence in their minds.  Season 9 went way beyond my visual comfort level.  The Ultra-violence and the loss of Emily Prentiss (Paget Brewster), who was replaced by the wooden Alex Blake (Jeanne Tripplehorn) just destroyed my interest in the show.  I have not bothered to even view Season 10.",1383868800,6,649,4.75

I suggest they move back to the tried and true formulas of the last two years and abandon the ""new age"" approach of the writers.  Just the thought of considering having Aaron Hotchner as a Unit Chief after the death of Unit Chief Strouss is a terrible idea which should never have been considered in the first place.  It detracts from the primary storyline of the season and then ends leaving the audience hanging on what is a very minor part of the third episode.",1381708800,,545,4.43
