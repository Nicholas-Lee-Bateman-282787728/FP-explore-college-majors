8559245,5,B00AYJBSGW,The movie was very well done and had a good ending.  The cast was excellent and the story looked like it was based on a true story of drug running.  A good movie to watch late at night instead of the other garbage on cable.,1377388800,,223,3.933333333333333
8559246,4,B00AYJBSGW,"I liked the movie, but bought it mainly because of the producer Marshall Lytle who was a dear friend
and because we traveled with him for 4 years When he had the group ""Tommy Page and the Page boys""
My husband was the drummer of the group..
GOOD MOVIE A LOT SHOULD SEE IT.  IT TELLS THE TRUE STORY OF THE DRUG MAFIA",1375056000,,315,4.0
8559247,2,B00AYJBSGW,"Jack Hooks (Robert Thorne) is an honest cop with a dishonest partner Frank Rossi(Tom Sizemore). When Jack refuses to steal evidence money, Frank sets him up. After serving four years of an eight year sentence, Jack agrees to go undercover for the DEA in order to entrap his old partner and reveal the Colombian connection.

The film claims this is a true story that takes place in 1976. It is a crime/action/drama that had a decent plot. There were a lot of scenes that just died from lack of action or decent dialouge. Our lead character Jack, lacked personality. I didn't care if he lived or died. Without colorful characters, the film is a bust. We need guys who need to do more than just look like Willie Nelson.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity.",1368230400,2,754,4.619402985074627
