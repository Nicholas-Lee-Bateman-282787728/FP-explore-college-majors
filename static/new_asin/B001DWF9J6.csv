I recommend this book to everyone who loves this car. It's a definite need to have this book!",1269820800,,263,4.076923076923077
8295063,3,B001DWF9J6,THIS VIDEO IS OK IF YOU LOVE THE GTR LIKE I DO AND HAVE ONE LIKE I DO THEN GET IT EITHER WAY YOU COULD PROBALLY SLEEP WELL IF YOU DECIDE NOT TO PURCHASE IT.,1252368000,,156,3.4857142857142858
8295064,5,B001DWF9J6,"This car is the symbol of things to come.  I hope it starts another batle fr supremacy among imports and domestics.  The Lexus IS-F and new NSX will have to contend with this masterpiece.  It has already taken on many of the established exotics and more than held its own.  Who's next?

If you haven't been anxiously awaiting this car's release, then crawl out from under your rock and buy this video!  This is as close as you can get to one without being able to smell the burning rubber!  Street, road and track impressions go a long way toward communicating what the overall driving experience is like.  And, as always, a track battle ensues!

I can't wait until there are enough tuned samples for the tuners to have a shootout with modified GTRs.  Who knows, maybe one of the extremely rare US tuners can put together a competitive car.",1227657600,2,840,4.54
