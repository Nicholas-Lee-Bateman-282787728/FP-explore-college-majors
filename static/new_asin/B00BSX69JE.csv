I am regularly enjoying Indian Bollywood movies, Japanese Anime and Korean dramas besides what our American and British market has to offer. So I gave this one a shot and I was not disappointed.

The story is similar to Romeo & Juliet about two star crossed lovers. Recommended for all audiences 16+ this Japanese drama has a lot of action, many twists in the story and an open ending where you can sort of make up your own mind does the male lead survive or not. The music is good with a lot of dance numbers in it, they are however completely different than in Bollywood shows.

The disc is a true region code B blu-ray. You MUST have a code free player for playback. It did not play on my second region code A player. There are a couple of extras on the disc, a making off and the musical numbers.

Overall you are in for a treat if you are like me and like to try out something new!",1465948800,,981,4.207446808510638

If I hadn't known who the director was, I would have been surprised by the ending but since it's Miike I really wasn't. The animated sequences were a really nice change of pace and done beautifully. Overall I'm glad I got to add this to my collection.",1453939200,,403,4.611111111111111
