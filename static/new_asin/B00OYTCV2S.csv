6776557,2,B00OYTCV2S,"This has worked for hundreds of film-makers! The Latest Hits: Sinister! Insidious! Annabelle! The Possession! Ouija! Finders Keepers! The Classics: Poltergeist! Child's Play! The Ring!

You will need:

- 1 troubled and/or recently separated couple with at least 1 son/daughter between 5 and 8 years old.
- A move into a new house. The parent should say something to the effect of: ""Things are going to be better here, I promise. Just give it a chance okay?""
- At least 3 violently murdered prior owners, which, for some reason, the new owners know nothing about.

How to proceed:

- 'The Imaginary Friend': A ghost/demon/Lovecraftian death-god/dead telepathic girl w/cursed videotape/Leprechaun/dybbuk box/possessed doll should immediately make friends with the child, who -- instead of being appropriately terrified, like any normal kid -- will calmly report the creepy s**t her 'imaginary friend' says to her. The course events take will depend on the supernatural threat in question.
- 'We Need To Talk About Your Daughter...': Trouble at school is a must. Either the child is teased, and ends up screaming, or the child is preternaturally quiet. The teacher will calmly and earnestly express worry, and then tell a disturbing story about the child's behavior, or present drawings. The drawings are always of dead people, or predict the future, or depict a menacing figure identified as the 'imaginary friend'.
- 'The Expert': Regardless what manner of threat is looming, one parent will then seek out the 'expert' (expert number 1... a second expert is often necessary): a priest, a psychic, a paranormal investigator, or a child psychiatrist; the course events take will depend on which expert is brought in. Proceed to the appropriate chapter, as determined by specific 'threat' and 'expert'. NOTE: There is an inversely proportionate relationship between the expert's level of scientific certainty and his/her likelihood of surviving to see the end credits. A scientist can only cheat death by overcoming his/her quaint, old-fashioned insistence on evidence, and embracing the superstitious yokel within.
- 'The Forrest Gump': Usually this ties in to the 'Microfiche Montage', or it replaces it. Examination of photographs from various unconnected crimes scenes, etc., reveals a really old person/entity, or an object, or a symbol (in 'Sinister' the monstrous demon-thing made a pointless super-secret cameo in each of the Super-8 film-reels it left behind, detectable only by freeze-frame; as was the case in 'The Ring', where a fly from the paused videotape suddenly becomes real, the demon whose image is frozen on the makeshift projection screen turns to meet the protagonist's gaze... scary).

Of Evil Dolls & Child Psychiatrists:

- 'The Evil Doll': is usually inhabited by the soul of a killer; in 'Child's Play' it was a run-of-the-mill armed robber killed in a toy store; in 'Annabelle' it was a Manson family-type Satanist killed in the family home. It could also be home to a demon, or have a curse attached to it.
- 'The Bad Penny': Only one parent suspects the truth (in the beginning), and should throw the doll away or destroy it; their suspicions are confirmed when the doll reappears in the child's bed, unharmed (works just as well with books, i.e. 'The Babadook'; or evil puzzle-boxes; etc.)
- 'The Hand-shaped Bruise': The child psychiatrist should discover mysterious bruises, and accuse the parent(s) of abusing their child. The expert should end up dead (especially if the parent has tried to confide with them about their fears, only to have them dismissed in a condescending way), either in their office, or more typically, after arriving unannounced at the family home to further investigate.
- 'The Haunted Headspace': The child will become creepier and emotionally distant.
- 'The Microfiche Montage': The 'research scene' comes before the climax, sometimes followed by a 'secondary expert' (If expert number 1 had a scientific background, expert number 2 will be a 'believer'). The parent should do an internet search, if the film has a contemporary setting. It can be supplemented by a trip to the library (or a hall of records, or police case files, or psychiatric records -- which might include a suspenseful break-in or impersonation); the newspaper archives, micro-film and micro-fiche will reveal the buried secrets, and provide the details necessary to defeating the evil doll. Dead languages work wonders on dead things, apparently; Latin is the way to go, but Aramaic is also good.",1420934400,11,4526,5.218707015130674

6776562,4,B00OYTCV2S,"** I was given a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

Call me a chicken, but movies with demonic dolls in them really creep me out.  Im not really sure why, either.  To my knowledge, Ive never been traumatized by a doll, nor did I even own any dolls.  I grew up with a brother, and he didn't have any (unless he was hiding them).  So this fear cannot be rooted in my childhoodI don't think.  But regardless of where it stems from, dolls are creepy, especially those that are battered and beat up.  So imagine my delight when I saw the cover of FINDERS KEEPERS!  I knew it was a must-see for me, so I gave it a shot.  Im glad I did, too, because this is a slick little thriller than doles out frights and fun.

I was surprised to discover the director, Alexander Yellen, has been involved with several bad films over the years, particularly several that were released by The Asylum.  I say surprised because this film is nothing like any of those low-budget atrocities.  If you are not familiar with The Asylum, it is the company that releases craptastic knock-offs of popular film franchises.  FINDERS KEEPERS is a well made film, and it is hopefully a precursor of what is to come from Yellen.

FINDERS KEEPERS is shot well and looks great onscreen.  The production value of the film appears high, and the locations chosen are perfect.  I particularly love the house where the doll is found; it just screams bad things happen here.

The acting is great, with Jaime Pressly heading up a talented cast.  Ive overheard several people who do not like her because of her Southern accent and mannerisms, however I love the woman.  She is beautiful and talented, an actress with a wide emotional range and a versatile skill-set.  The film also features Tobin Bell, who you will remember from the SAW franchise.  Bell does a great job portraying Claires psychiatrist, although he is not featured much in the film, unfortunately.  And I would be remiss if I did not include young actress Kylie Rogers, who plays Claire.  Rogers does a phenomenal job with her role, and I hope to see more of her work in the future.

As for special effects, there are surprisingly few in FINDERS KEEPERS.  The doll is never seen moving, which is kind of disappointing, but it also helps to build the tension.  There is no gore, although we do get some bloodshed, which looks pretty good.

I have to give FINDERS KEEPERS a thumbs up.  It is simple in design, but it is executed very well.  Fans of chilling, low-grade horror will want to give this one a look for sure.

I can already see a few of you rolling your eyes, and thats fineafter all, everybody is entitled to their own opinion.  But you have to take movies like this for what they are:  fun, plain and simple.  Sure, this is thoroughly explored territory (a possessed doll terrorizes people), but who cares?  As long as a film is well done and entertains, the concept does not have to be original.

I recommend FINDERS KEEPERS.  It is available now in a variety of formats.",1420675200,4,3029,4.5036764705882355
6776563,5,B00OYTCV2S,"Where do I start...first of all this is the first horror film that actually scared me a little in a LONG time. And that's coming from a 21 year old girl who LOVES horror movies like The Exorcist and Stephan King movies. What really scares you about this movie is the DOLL. The doll is incredibly creepy and just screams that it's evil by its looks.

The movie is about a single mother and her troubled daughter moving into a new home. Here, the little girl finds the doll left behind by the previous family. Instantly afterwards, the girl begins acting insane. Having tantrums about going to school, killing flies and soon enough killing the neighbor's cats. AND the neighbor herself.

The doll influences her and this leads to a string of mass murders throughout the entire movie. Another great thing about this movie is that it doesn't drag out. They say the horror films that drag out are the best, but that isn't the case here. Things start up right away.

This movie is alot scarier and better than Annabelle, Child's Play and even The Conjuring. The doll really gives you chills no matter if its a scary scene or not and the effects are really good and very terrifying. A winner for any horror fan. Also, no sex or nudity! A nice change seeing alot of horror films today have sex scenes and after a while that got annoying.",1420502400,,1329,4.5062240663900415
6776564,5,B00OYTCV2S,"one of best horror flicks i've seen!  and i've seen A LOT.
good actors '[even little girl]; suspenseful and scary.
and the doll is very creepy
sp;ecial fx very good.
no nudity or sex!",1416182400,3,183,4.382352941176471
6776565,2,B00OYTCV2S,"Spoiler Alert:  I will be making fun of this movie.  To do so I must refer to things that happen in the movie.  If you read this review and then see the movie, you will be able to enjoy FK more for its chief virtue: an unintended send up of thrillers.  It is my hope you will do both.

Finders Keepers proves the following:

A Daddy Long Legs spider walking on a carpet, screws shooting out of heat a grate, a cat just hissing are no longer scary.

Children who are made to do rote multiplication exercises will say creepy stuff to a new kid who moved into the house down the street where all the murders happened.

A kid talking to a doll has been done far too often. But a kid tearing wings off flies suggests impressive dexterity and future success as a magician or surgeon or demon.

No child actor will ever be as spooky as Christina Ricci in the Addams Family.

When a plumber with an accent identifies a doll as a ""muneca quitapena"" and points out it is bad luck to have such a doll, should prompt one, even one not speaking Spanish, to dump the doll.

No evil doll from Mexico has ever had a green card: it should deported.

Any ugly doll with a fabric version of dried apple shrunken head that's been hit with a frying pan should be washed in bleach, dusted with quicklime, exorcized, and thrown in the garbage, immediately.

A doll under two feet in length and made from cloth does not make a believable psycho killer.

When the doll's final metamorphosis looks like it is turning into a giant angry Brillo pad, that evil doll has lost all credibility.

Adults who literally run and hide under a bed or in a closet are not acting like adults.

Back story dead police and murder victims and current unpleasant waitresses, daddy's new girlfriend, Marina Siris the next door neighbor, mendacious realtors, junk dealers hauling evil waste, teachers of folklore who attempt to do surgery on voodoo dolls, a psychiatrist and his secretary, a smart scholar who knows all the right moves have not and will not fare well in a horror movie.

A body count above 14 dead in an 88-minute movie seems a little high when each is killed individually.

If Syfy can afford a production that looks this good and pay decent money to a surprisingly impressive cast of established actors, then why didn't Syfy also buy a better script?",1414800000,16,2323,4.464454976303317

The doll is certainly creepy looking enough to give you nightmares, but you never actually see it move really.  This story may be more about possession than inanimate objects moving around.

That said, the movie was very good.  It kept a good pace.  The little girl was definitely good in her role as a possessed little brat that just makes your palm itch to smack her into next week even if you don't normally approve of physical discipline.

***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***

Right off the bat I have to admit that my favorite part of this movie was Jaime Pressly.  I really liked her in ""My Name is Earl,"" and seeing her in this movie was the one highlight of the entire film.  However I don't know about her choice of hairstyle, it just didn't look good on her.  The plot of the film was similar to a few other films that came out recently.  A kid finds a cursed item and it makes them start to act strange and they become possessed and the family has to fight to save her.

It's not a bad formula for a horror story, but it's been done before.  The special effects were pretty lame, and the doll itself just wasn't very scary.  It was more strange looking than it was scary.  And if you're looking for that sickle looking knife the doll is holding on the cover of the DVD case, don't hold your breath because it's not in this movie.

One last thing, when they finally get this doll destroyed and their child back to normal, it shows them moving out like everything is back to normal.  But one thing, they still have the dead body of their relator in their closet.  How did that call to the police go?  ""Yes officer, our relator is dead in our upstairs closet.  What killed him?  Oh this doll that our daughter had killed him.""  And apparently that worked because it's never addressed as to what they did about his dead body.

This movie plays more like a supernatural slasher in as you don't see the doll move...much!;) If you find one, don't keep it...ITS NOT YOURS!",1421020800,,333,4.661016949152542
6776693,3,B00OYTCV2S,"Not very scary. The lead female role was okay, the daughter was ... meh, and the dad/lead male was a horrible actor. His script was poorly written as well, super clich and cheesy. Come to think of it, the whole movie was pretty cheesy, and not in a fun kind of way. I wouldn't pay to watch this, but if you need time to kill and it's free maybe it's worth a watch. Nothing new or original. *Spoiler* The most heart wrenching part is when the crazy cat lady's cats are killed.",1421020800,2,475,4.173913043478261
6776694,1,B00OYTCV2S,"Just to save your time/money. Don't buy this movie. I don't know where people get off giving it 5 stars.

First of all -- the acting is the worst I've ever forced myself to watch because I spent the money to rent it.

The whole time, my boyfriend and I were waiting to laugh at some stupid animation of the doll's movement but it NEVER moves. At least the Chuckie movies give you that.

I wish I could give negative stars.",1420934400,13,422,4.185185185185185
6776695,3,B00OYTCV2S,A girl is drawn to an evil doll left behind in a new house that her mom moves her into after a marital separation.  It takes the parents quite a while to figure out that this doll needs to be rendered powerless and destroyed before it takes over the girl completely.  Kyle Rogers does a good job as the possessed girl.,1420934400,,318,4.19672131147541

I didn't walk into this expecting it to be on par with something from The Conjuring universe. It was what I expected, and I'm completely satisfied with that.

8685447,1,B00OYTCV2S,"The trailer was better than the movie. At the half way point when they get to the fathers place it feels like they just outright gave up on any suspense.  It felt like they tried harder to explain the reason why a doll is possessed than any other haunted doll film I have ever seen.  If you're watching a haunted doll film you already have some suspension of disbelief ready. Childs Play Chucky was friends with a voodoo man I'll buy it, Dolly Dearest released cursed spirit enters a doll I'll buy it, Trilogy of Terror the soul of a warrior is in the doll and the necklace keeps it from moving it works. This movie has some carpenter tell us about the history of the dolls, they go to a college to talk about the history of the dolls, they find an expert to talk about the history of the dolls, the expert gets another expert to help them explain the history of the doll, the mother tries explaining all of this to jigsaw. All the while we just want the movie to continue, but it can't because we have to wait for the characters to catch up. Not to mention that the doll on the cover is different from the doll in the film. The cover doll looks porcelain or something bound in old leather. The doll in the film looks like it's made of a burlap bag and old curtains.  All in all it's not a good film, which is a shame since there hasn't been a good original haunted doll film in the last 20 years.",1479254400,,1397,4.166666666666667
