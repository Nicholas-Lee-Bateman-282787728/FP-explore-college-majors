8605077,5,B00EFENFSG,"This review is being written by the subject of the documentary. Obviously, I'm biased, but I'm amazed at what an amazing piece Bob made out of what at the time seemed to be ramblings. He got the best I had to offer. Talked about things nobody has ever asked me about in an interview before and wove together a very cool thought piece.  It seems to me that it is mostly about creativity.  Not process as much as spirit.  Great job, Bob.",1393372800,,435,4.280487804878049
