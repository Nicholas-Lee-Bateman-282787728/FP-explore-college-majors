8071840,5,B000A0W82S,Incredible cinematography one of the best I've seen by far. The plot and acting was superb. Excellent film not too many things to complain about on this one except for the character of Ulrich. But that is life which makes this an exceptional film.,1248652800,2,247,4.636363636363637
8071841,5,B000A0W82S,"At first, what seems a documentary-style film with quite dry content, becomes a fascinating study of the power of family duty hardening the heart of a good man. Christoffer (Ulrich Thomsen) has a beautiful wife and great life. Just how he turns into a ruthless, impotent mechanoid, only interested in the family company's success - at the cost of everything and anything else that may be in its path, is both shocking and captivating.",1217462400,4,434,4.878378378378378
8071842,5,B000A0W82S,"This is one of the most powerful movies I have seen in a long time. It has far more depth than anything I've recently seen out of Hollywood. Per Fly, the Danish writer and director, is clearly doing something right that others should pay attention to. This is how movies should be, so full and complete that you believe you are watching real life unfold, not some make believe story from a bored script writer. I'm determined to find and view the other films of Per Fly.",1151280000,6,470,4.413793103448276
