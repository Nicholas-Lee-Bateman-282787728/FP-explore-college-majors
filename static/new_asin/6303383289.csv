633101,5,6303383289,"This is one of those Steve Martin films that should always be available for purchase.  It is my favorite of his, along with All of Me.
A Simple Twist of Fate is the story of a man who finds out the baby his wife is  carrying is not his.  She leaves him to go to this other man.
He spends  his time afterwards buying expensive gold coins and polishing them and  staring at them every day until one day a man steals all his coins and runs  off with them.
Steve Martin's character is real down about this time and  he just mopes around all day and doesn't talk to anybody.  Then, one day, a  simple twist of fate walks right into his life.  A little girl around a  year a half to two years old walks right into his house and chooses him as  a daddy.
Her mama was a drug addict and she got her money for drugs from  a rich politician in town who was married, but who was the father of her  little girl.  The mama wanted more money and the man wouldn't give it to  her, so she packed the little girl and herself into the car and drove in  the snow to go see the politician.  But on the way, the car wouldn't work  any more and the woman and little girl walked in the snow.  The mother was  all high on dope and she died not far from Steve Martin's house, and the  little girl saw the light in his window and walked right on in just like it  was her own house.
Steve Martin adopted her and the little girl grew up  to love him like her own daddy. Her real daddy (Gabriel Byrne)was still a  politician in town but nobody knew it until the real daddy wanted to lay  claim to his daughter, who was now about 10 or 12 years old.  Now there  would be a court battle on who would gain or keep custody of little  Matilda.
I believe everyone should see this movie, and since the  producers are not producing this movie any more, I'm sure you could rent a  copy at your nearest video rental store.
In the meantime, won't you  producers PLEASE bring back this beautiful and tender movie so that I can  buy a copy of it?  I know others would like to have this movie, too.",963014400,7,2054,4.027363184079602
633102,1,6303383289,"A convoluted mess. Also, this movie was shelved as a comedy at my local video rental place, and it isn't a comedy, despite the presance of Steve Martin. Martin plays a lonely man (Michael) who is angry at the world and  robbed of his wealth. A little girl winds up on his doorstep and he raises  her, although we know that she is actually the daughter of the local mayor  (Byrne). When the little girl, Matilda (Austin), is 11, the mayor sues for  custody and a great battle ensues.",961372800,,482,4.382022471910112
633103,5,6303383289,Steve Martin proves he can be funny but also very  dramatic. This movie has an excellent storyline.  You will laugh and cry with this one!  I recommend this movie for the guys & their lady! Both will enjoy this  movie!,954806400,2,218,4.375

The only thing I thought was horrible was the girl in it, she was  horrible!  worst ever! If it weren't for her this film  would get a five star rating for sure.",953683200,,289,4.415094339622642

633106,3,6303383289,"A great simple fable, good for all times and ages. If anyone objects to some incongruities, such as the legal details, and such, then they forget that all movies must dispense with some real life restrictions, otherwise  we'd never have 'happy endings' or some satisfaction out of some otherwise  improbable situation.  This movie takes us from one extreme of human  condition to the other, and leaves us quite happy at the final (surprise)  resolution.  Hooray for Steve and the fine cast!",948585600,,490,4.987654320987654

In that book the girl decides for herself that she will stay with her father rather than go to her biological father's home, but that girl is 16 and there is no custody battle in court (the story is set in England in the 1800s).  However, in that story, as in this one, the brother steals the gold and then falls in to the lake and drowns.  Mr. Newland didn't remember that he had thrown his brother into the lake because he didn't do it.  Just as Matlida could have fallen in when she was a toddler, the brother -- drunk, in the dark and having just left a girl to die in his car -- left McCann's home and stumbled over the cliff.  Do you not think a man would remember where he illegally buried his dead brother?  The truth is, he didn't know that his brother was dead, and he was probably happy to be rid of him because the brother was the only adult alive who knew the truth about the baby, so he didn't bother to search for him.  And the other truth is that the judge let Matilda stay with McCann because he was her father, and once he got his money back and all things were equal between the two men, there was no question as to where Matlida belonged.",1175472000,5,1244,4.132780082987552

His writing is so blunt and thick sometimes, it's like getting hit with a shovel... not so pleasing.  The story is pasted together and the dialogue has an artificial feel.  Also, any time a story can be best described as a ""morality tale"", it's going to be boring and obvious.  I didn't care to finish the movie.

634089,3,6303383289,"SPOILER ALERT ...

As an adoptive parent myself, I have some mixed feelings about this movie. On one hand, it lovingly portrays the relationship between a single adoptive father and his daughter. Steve Martin's humor and gentleness, as well as an underlying sadness, permeate the role he plays. I love seeing the interactions between him and his daughter as she grows up. On the other hand, the stereotypical drama in the last half of the movie - custody battles, courtroom dramas, a biological parent who tries to steal away the child he abandoned - damage the movie's credibility for me. Also, I hated the constant use of the outdated and offensive words ""real father"" whenever anyone referred to the child's biological father. The original classic and the moral of that story is lost - the love of the daughter for her father overcomes class differences. The moral of this story instead seems to be that of ""money wins"" - that is, the adoptive father gets to keep his daughter as soon as he can prove that he has the money to do so. I thought the ending cheapened the movie.",1155859200,,1077,4.668421052631579
634090,4,6303383289,"What they fail to fully explain at the end is the fact that, earlier in the movie, Mr. Newman says that he has no idea what happened to his missing brother, or where he might be. The place where the police found his brother's skeletal remains is the very same site where Mr. Newman, (Mathilda's biological father),was developing for a man made lake or something.  He had total control over this land as its owner, and the discovery of his brother's remains proved that, once again, he was nothing but a liar who would say and do anything to further his political career. He knew that his brother had been killed, and since a dead brother would've ruined him politically, he disposed of the body by burying it on his own property, not thinking that years later, that very site was going to be dug up for construction. Instead of alerting the authorities about his dead brother and the whereabouts of Michael McCann's stolen gold, he tried to play the innocent victim who was just as baffled about his brother's disappearence as everyone else. That's why the judge let Mathilda stay with her ""Dad"", instead of the sperm donor.

The real fault that made me feel like the whole thing was just a waste of my time was the incomprehensible ending. (Spoilers Alert?).

Almost every character in the film does things that are inexplicable unless you realize they're living according to the codes and cliches of the last century.

Martin is into the skin of his role as usual, sure, especially as the role allows for a little comic relief. Problem is that the comedy simply does not gel with with the drama here. The tone is wobbly at best.

datkins-3 Surrey, England
Date: 2 January 2001 Summary: A shabby copy of a brilliant masterpiece of literature
This film is a flagrant rip-off of one of the best novels of all time, Silas Marner by George Eliot.
The details of the film shown on IMDb do give acknowledgement to the original authoress but I did not see this at the beginning of the film, only a credit at the end of it saying ""suggested by the book Silas Marner"". Suggested? It was nothing but a complete rip- off of all the essential elements of the story:
A wronged and sad old man, an artisan, poor and lonely, has all his money stolen. One night a child wanders up to his door as her mother lies dying in the snow outside. The man takes her in and brings her up until one day the local squire (or rich politician here) demands to adopt the child. It is he who has fathered the child during an illicit affair years before. The battle then ensues as to who should have legal custody of the child.
In this and every other aspect of the film, the story is exactly the same. In only one can I find a difference. Silas Marner had epilepsy - but perhaps that would have strained the acting abilities of Mr Martin too far. On top of that he has his hair dyed in some carrot juice concoction (presumably to make him look younger, but actually making him look more the clown that he is)! There is also the addition of meaningless jokes, that this offbeat comedian cannot resist bringing into the story which have no part in it and only detract from the profoundness of the story. Like when the child cries in the courthouse declaring she can only be happy with the man who has fathered her all these years. This is conveyed in the film by the girl applying nasal decongestant to the bridge of her nose to make her tearful!
I am surprised that legalities and integrity within the film industry permit such a film to be made. If I was a trustee of George Eliot's I would insist on reparation. If I was Steve Martin I would send the profits to that estate, or to the poor. At the very least it should be entitled Silas Marner - adapted by S Martin. Or better still removed from the archives!
If you are interested in this story - and I hope you are - dismiss this completely and watch Silas Marner. Or read the book! The BBC made an excellent adaptation of it in the 1980's.",978393600,4,2394,4.310421286031042
