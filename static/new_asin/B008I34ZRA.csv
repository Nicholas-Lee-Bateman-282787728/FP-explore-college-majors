8528394,4,B008I34ZRA,"Good music is made every day by buskers, such as the ones shown here in the subways of NYC. Buskers are a special breed. They take a lot of abuse and yet still feel the drive to play. This film takes a good look at that. I wish it would have stayed on the buskers and did not show montages of NYC scenes or keep showing bits of a Skype interview with two musical producers.",1506124800,,373,3.986666666666667
