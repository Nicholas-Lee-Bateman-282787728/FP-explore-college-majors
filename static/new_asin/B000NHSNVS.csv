8177688,5,B000NHSNVS,"It was a great movie. I was very happy to see it! I actually had got for my dad cause my grandpa was in it his dad and he died about 9yrs ago and I knew how much my dad missed him so I bought for him to see him, and he loved. Its a very good family movie and it is worth watching.",1316044800,,280,3.390625
8177689,4,B000NHSNVS,"This movie is light fluff. The story is a version of many other stories with the same theme: a down and out man who finds that he can interact with his family and then, together, become successful. The success, as in this film, is usually virtually miraculous. The man, as in many films of this genre, has a girl as a friend or helper, and ultimately falls in love with her. Yet, despite the predictability and the lack of any depth, the film was alright.",1285804800,,455,4.364705882352941
