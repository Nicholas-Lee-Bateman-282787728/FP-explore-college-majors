8693338,5,B00QYZJ79K,This has to be one of the best I have ever seen.  It has scared the devil out of me.  I showed this to the employees of my office on 4/24/2018 to celebrate Earth Day.  I had four people come watch it.  So that just shows me that they don't care about saving our Earth and resources.  I do want to save Earth and our resources.  Everyone should see this.,1524614400,,353,3.9714285714285715

(The scene where the once mighty Colorado River becomes a trickle that disappears into desert sand is heart-breaking!) Very importantly, however, the narrator turns to effective, ongoing examples of solutions to these very problems. Being descended from 6 generations of cattlemen in Central Florida, I was most impressed by the Western rancher who has restored amazing biodiversity and regrowth of native prairie grasses merely by keeping his herds moving. This mimics the behavior of the original bison, 5 BILLION strong, who lived in the same area without causing depletion and desertification of arid grasslands.",1447372800,8,736,5.7
