8193376,5,B000PUB5FE,"This is a good comedy with the best example of Jorge Negrete's voice.  The songs were well selected from Argentina and Mexico.
Most Mexican Americans over 50 will enjoy it.",1390608000,,172,4.733333333333333
8193377,5,B000PUB5FE,"Although he does not appear in the movie until a fourth or so of the way, this is unquestionably my favorite Jorge Negrete movie.  I watched it as a child over 50 years ago and at least twice more when it was shown on TV.  I finally decided to buy it and enjoy it without commercials.  It has plenty of the traditional ""macho"" flavor that ultimately melts before a beautiful woman; it is replete with humorous situations resulting from clearly intentional coy behavior and double entendres; and contains an ample dose of good songs, most notably the movie title song: Cuando Quiere un Mexicano.",1379808000,,594,4.6923076923076925
