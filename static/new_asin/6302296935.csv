449894,5,6302296935,"Although a made-for TV Mini-Series that aired in November, 1990 on NBC, ""The Great Los Angeles Earthquake"" is an excellend disaster movie (the DVD contains all 177 minutes worth of film from the original broadcast...almost a 3 hour movie). Although the film features many well-known TV actors from the 1980's (I recognized some of them, but couldn't recall where I had seen the others) it is the strong script and the amazing special effects that make the film.

 Joanna Kerns (from ""Growing Pains"" fame) plays a seismologist who predicts when ""The Big One"" strikes L.A.: the only problem is no one will listen to her.

 I have to say the film really shows the beauty of Los Angeles and eventually the horror of what would happen if a quake as big as an 8.5 hit the city: the results and aftermath are shocking.",1398038400,,811,4.65034965034965

449931,4,6302296935,"While unable to match super theatrical effects,  the producers were still able to instill excitement by focusing on close-up impact of the Quake.  Beyond that, while ultra-familiar, they handled the Evil Businessman-Irresponsible Journalist-Corrupt Public Official-Noble Scientist plot rather well. Most key actors were quite competent, though unknown to me, save for a few character actors and Ed Begley, Jr., with the female lead, Joanna Kerns, doing what she is supposed to do, by carrying a heavier weight of the action on her shoulders. Almost three hours in length, you will  want to plan on creating an intermission  for yourself or watching on two days.

449972,5,6302296935,"I remember this movie when it was first broadcast as a mini-series in 1990. After that, I didn't see it again until 1992 and then a lot of the sub-plots had been removed to shorten the running time. For the record, this is the full version - 177 minutes long.

It begins in a remote area near Los Angeles City, where a series of small earthquakes are being noticed. An attractive seismologist with the USGS, Dr. Claire Winslow (Joanna Kerns)has just returned from a quake zone in Mexico, and soon finds that the patterns leading to the giant quake in Mexico City are almost identical to those in Los Angeles. When an interview with an unscrupulous reporter, Kevin Conrad (Richard Masur) leads to a hornet's nest of controversy, it touches off a conflict between Claire & her husband, Steve (Dan Lauria), who is trying to land a contract as a landscape architect in a Huntingdon Beach development engineered by developer Wendell Cates (Robert Ginty). The small earthquakes continue, and Cates threatens to get Claire fired through her boss (Richard Herd of 'T.J. Hooker') by putting pressure on the governor through his aide, Chad Spaulding (Joe Spano). In the meantime, the would-be president-elect of South Africa (the late Brock Peters) becomes the target of would-be assassins who want to put the brakes on South African reforms. Amid all this, Claire discovers that the big quake will not come from the San Andreas, but from a smaller fault called the Elysian Park that runs right under the city. It will culminate in a quake of over 8 on the Richter scale, and 20,000 people may perish...

The acting is solid in most place, especially Kerns & Lauria who turn in a stellar, believable performance as a family. Ed Begley Jr. & Brock Peters also turn in solid performances, as well as Lindsay Frost & Alan Autry as Claire's sister & her future fiance.

While the main focus of the story is the Winslow family & Claire's fight to get her message out, the movie also features multiple subplots including Claire's housekeeper Sonia & her son Miguel, Claire & Laurie's parents Anita & Dr. Owen Parker, and the prominent subplots of developer Cates & his manipulation of Chad Spaulding and Claire's boss, as well as the assassination plot.

The visual & special effects make the earthquake itself seem believable & realistic (remember this was before CGI and digital imaging). This movie is far superior to 1974's 'Earthquake!' in almost every way. Highly recommended for anyone interested in disaster films.",1268524800,,2506,4.875586854460094
449973,4,6302296935,"This was a great disaster movie for its time. However, it was a little slow in picking up- lot of personal stories going on before any disaster hit. But it made for some good anticipation and once the earthquake hit, it wasn't disappointing.",1258156800,,241,4.627906976744186

It's great to see it again so many years later on DVD.  The depictions of a massive earthquake were so well done for the time and it definitely holds up pretty well to todays standards, though if the movie was made today it would certainly be made a lot differently.

The most diverting subplot dealt with a very persistent sniper determined to bag his quarry and was quite enjoyable. ;-P

And the ""big one"" did indeed happen, preceded by smaller quakes and followed by aftershocks.  The realism was absolutely terrific, the acting superb, and the overall mood solemn and thought-provoking.

450015,4,6302296935,"Joanna Kerns, the lovable mom from Growing Pains, leads us through the ""Big One"" that hits Southern California.  I admit that my penchant for disaster movies biases me, but The Great Los Angeles Earthquake provides a better-than-B-movie presentation of the destruction of L.A.  The 'science' appeared convincing enough to bring me into the story.  A cross between an educational after-school special and a prime-time disaster flick intended to grab market share, this movie adequately captures the drama surrounding the event, before, during, and after.  The underlying storylines moves us through easily and credibly.  The special effects certainly date this movie to some degree, but considering its own era, and the fact that the film was made for TV, the effects come off as convincing enough to repel laughter and instead draw in the audience into a horrible realism.  I waited years for the movie to be placed on DVD.  It's well worth the wait.",1173312000,,950,5.12987012987013

This particular movie was mine to do so was very interested in it.  It portrayed an earthquake on a real fault pretty good but what happens in earthquakes and the time it takes to get to people (or across town in a disaster) is unreal.",1167782400,,560,4.57
450040,5,6302296935,"Disaster movie fans will be happy to know that the DVD transfer of The Great Los Angeles Earthquake (originally titled The Big One: The Great Los Angeles Earthquake) appears to be a complete and uncut translation of the original miniseries that aired on NBC in 1990.  For a made-for-TV movie, the special effects are outstanding, made even more incredible considering the lack of CGI at the time.

Some scenes and subplots cut from the VHS version and the version farmed out for syndication on local stations have been restored, most notably the assassination subplot (featuring Clarence Gilyard, Jr. and the late Brock Peters) and the original ending (featuring Dan Lauria).

The Big One is a better, more realistic disaster thriller than the later 10.5 and 10.5 Apocalypse that NBC most recently broadcast, and has better effects than CBS's more recent earthquake offering, Aftershock: Earthquake in New York, although that movie is pretty good.  For the money, getting three hours worth of movie is a treat.  Buy this movie!",1162166400,,1027,5.089285714285714
450041,4,6302296935,"My father recorded this movie off of NBC back in 1990, when it aired as a mini-series. This movie got me fascinated by earthquakes. Over the past 14 years, I have been intrigued by the movies plot and special effects, and have watched the movie many times over the years. Over time, the tape has worn out. [...]

First of all I must say, that once again, I am completely amazed by this movie. In my opinion, it is one of the greatest earthquake movies I have ever seen. The earthquake scenes are so realistic and are very well carried out. Let's just say that I would love to see this movie re-released in movie theaters with awsome surround sound!! That would be awsome!

HOWEVER...
There is a huge chunk of the movie's plot that has been cut out. This version is basically about Dr. Clare Winslow and the Big One she predict. When it originally aired in 1990, we saw the story of Dr. Winslow's family - her parents, sister and cop-boyfriend and his cop-friend, her family friends, even the house keeper and her son and brother where in the movie, as well as a visiting South African prime minister's assassination attempt - all those side stories and plots have unfortunatley been cut out. That is why I have to say that I am a little disappointed.

Know that the major editing in this film doesn't take away from the film at all, for first time viewers, but for people like me who where/are looking for the original movie in its entirety will be a tad disappointed.

All in all, its still an awesome movie to watch!!",1101772800,,1519,4.453237410071942

I DEFINITELY WOULD WATCH THIS FILM MORE THAN ""EARTHQUAKE"", EVEN WITH IT'S ADDED FOOTAGE!!!!
YOU DIDN'T HAVE WALTER MATTHEAU IN A ""STUPID"" CAMERO SCENE AS A DRUNK AT A BAR! HIS PERFORMANCE ABSOLUTELY RUINED THE SERIOUS CALABIER OF THE ORIGINAL ""EARTHQUAKE!""

Great SFX and a great suspense-building story, which isn't boring at any moment!
I've watched this movie so many times now, and still it touches me. Maybe thats got something to do with me living in a city like Los Angeles. I live in HEERLEN, the Netherlands, a big city also built on a fault. In 1992 we had a damaging 6.2 earthquake here, and since then, 3 or 4 quakes per month between 3-5 on the scale. So like L.A. we're also waiting for the big one here, and that makes this movie even more frightening to me. Because this movie shows what can happen in a convincing way, in other words the SFX are super!
Must see movie, but see the 3 hour version, because I can imagine that the movie version isn't that good, like other reviewers said. It's an outrage that this movie is cut! Who has the right to trim a movie?! I always wonder about that, since movie is an art-form. What gives people the right to adjust a piece of art? I mean we don't change a painting of Van Gogh, so why do people change the editing of a movie? It makes me real mad.

450044,4,6302296935,"While it has many of the same problems that most disaster films do (greed, ambition, melodramatic subplots), THE BIG ONE is still a rather scary made-for-TV movie.  Joanna Kerns (of TV's ""Family Matters"") portrays seismologist Claire Winslow as a cross between CalTech seismologists Kate Hutton and Lucy Jones as she tries to warn those in power of a potentially catastrophic quake that she thinks is prime to slam the Los Angeles area.  As usual, out of fear for causing the real estate market to crash, much like in JAWS, those in power try to cover up her warnings.
But when the Big One hits, it hits with force.  This may be only a television movie, but the visual effects here, of buildings violently swaying and the ferocious destruction scenes, are about as frighteningly real as I've seen anywhere.  The scenarios raised in this film may not always be plausible, but they are definitely possible.  That is why, despite some typically melodramatic performances and clunky dialogue, THE BIG ONE is highly effective.",1028678400,,1021,4.947368421052632

I will never buy anything made by them again.  The miniseries was 3 hours long.  I would also like to find the original uncut movie.",1011744000,,292,4.666666666666667
450046,3,6302296935,"I saw this movie on television when it was a Two Part mini series. Then it was re-released as a 3 hour version.  This version is so ugly and short that the movie has no guts to it any more. they didn't even remove the names off the credits of some of the people whose parts they removed.  I love the first two versions. If anyone has the origional on tape or the second airing.  Not to mention they never mention the father at the end, so his character basically is dead. Awfull cut.",975542400,,483,4.117021276595745

7823824,3,6302296935,"This is a long-long-long drawn-out film that doesnt pay off until the end.  The meandering plot takes place over several days; the filmmakers provided handy onscreen notification of what particular day it is.  Not that much happens on these particular days leading up to the event in question.  It is literally all talk and no action until day 9 when the quake finally unleashes its fury.  In the meantime there is a lot of chatter, a lot of backstabbing, teen angst, overbearing mothers........in desperation they even tossed in an assassination attempt!  All the usual ingredients are present and accounted for.  The negligible star of the piece (Joanna Kerns as Clare Winslow) has a history of overreacting.  Shes accused of being a Chicken Little who once predicted DESTRUCTION that never happened.  Therefore her current prediction of DOOM is discounted by all and sundry.  All the onscreen relationships are handled in a superficial manner; the real star is the quake and its aftermath.  That part of the movie works well.  Im just not certain its enough to justify the long wait until it happens.
(This review refers to the 177 minute version.)",1462147200,,1151,5.005263157894737
7823825,4,6302296935,"I bought this because of one of the co-stars, but I found that I enjoyed the movie.  I realize that the city of Los Angeles must be aware of the threat of an earthquake really exists.  Made me think that I must have been stupid when I lived there, because the threat didn't seem real to me at the time.",1460505600,,302,4.016666666666667
