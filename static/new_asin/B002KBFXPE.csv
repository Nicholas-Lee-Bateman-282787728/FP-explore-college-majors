The cold blooded murder, filmed and photographed as it happened, resulted in a trial where AN all white jury acquitted the terrorists of murder and conspiracy. During the investigations that preceded the terrorist attack, the police would later release information that over 80 Klansmen and Nazis were allocated for the attack, and that at least one Klansman was said to have a machine gun to ""shoot out the place.""
