8222521,5,B000WCDI82,"During the summer of 2009 my family and I rode the wonderful Durango & Silverton Narrow Gauge round trip. I've gathered together several DVD and print items concering the railroad. When I leaned of a winter freight DVD, I immediately ordered it and after viewing, ordered a second copy to be sent to one of my family members who had been with me during the previous summer.

The DVD shows a facet that few if any will ever be able to see, and then, only on a tourist train.

Excellent product. I'd recommend it to anyone interested in mountain railroading.",1264291200,4,556,4.55
