The foxy ladies of Fountain Gate are back to tackle the European hierarchies (and the big screen) in their epic adventure of Kath and Kimderella. Set in the gorgeous but bankrupt Papilloma, the girls embark on a journey to Italy after Kath (Jane Turner) wins a vacation for two.

What did I think?

The movie gets off to a triumphant start, but what happens next is a big jumble of awkwardness. This really is a pointless plot with a storyline that didn't go anywhere. Out of place and the Cinderella references added a whole lot of cheese. Recycling is good but not when it means rehashing and reusing a lot of old television material.

I got lost in all the montages, dance sequences and oodles of costume changes that gave Sex and the City a run for its money.

I must admit the guest appearances were entertaining and Frank Woodleys scene on the castle balcony was incredible. Overall, however, I left rather disappointed. Only diehard fans should see it.",1431734400,,976,4.651162790697675
