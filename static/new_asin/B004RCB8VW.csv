4460391,4,B004RCB8VW,"Those requiring their plot to be cut, dried, and wrapped up with a bow need not apply. But as is the case with many non-Hollywood, non-American films that make it to our shores, a more loosely structured story provides a more realistic view of life, what it means to be human, and the challenges involved.

Other than the question of Cam ""desiring"" Duyen (nothing in the movie suggested this to me, though I suppose the original dialogue might have had a detail the subtitles left out), the Amazon synopsis sums things up reasonably well. Another very long review gives even more detail for those who might want blow by blow plot points before seeing the film.

It seems that while, as Duyen explains, she believes life is simple -- follow the script, all is well -- where her script meets the realities of other people, she finds her own needs and desires unmet. If the script says you meet a man, get married, make love, but he doesn't seem to know anything about making love, nor have any desires along those lines, what is one to do?

Of course, everyone's improvisation -- going off-script -- is different, depending on circumstances and their own personality. In Duyen's case, she has a close friend in Cam, who introduces her (in her own way) to a man who is decidedly more worldly than Duyen's husband Hai. His unpredictable nature seems to make him more desirable and, eventually, allows Duyen to experience what a less ""checked off that life goal item"" marriage can allow.

The film includes a wide variety of challenging situations and coping mechanisms. Duyen is the main story, but her life connects with many others, and we vicariously experience their difficulties as well. While there is a definitely dark and depressing undercurrent in the movie, in some sense it helps portray the adaptability and strength of humanity even in hard times, and well as the exceptions to that generality.",1406332800,,1903,4.7926829268292686
4460392,4,B004RCB8VW,"I didn't have too much to do, so i decided to kill some time by watching this. It starts off kinda slow in the beginning and there were some parts that i really had to keep myself awake to keep watching so i won't miss anything important but overall, its ok",1405987200,,257,4.0588235294117645
4460393,1,B004RCB8VW,This is a bad film. Bad story & acting.  This is one of the worst films I have ever seen.,1388707200,,89,3.45
4460394,2,B004RCB8VW,"This movie stays adrift just like its title and ends bad. This movies glamorizes immorality to an extent of a supposed friend sending her friend to a rapist and womanizing thug for reasons incomprehensible to me and it gets even worse from there on. I am not trying to be self-righteous here, but I find it deplorable when a rapist and womanizer is glorified. Maybe in some cultures this is acceptable, but sorry, not good for me.",1388016000,5,430,4.597402597402597
4460395,2,B004RCB8VW,"This was a dark look at the daily struggles of daily life.  I gave it a low rating because the editing is disjointed. This may be due to the heavy censorship because it deals with very sensitive subjects like drug abuse, prostitution, child abuse, and suicide.  (by the way, this is not an erotic movie in anyway.)",1341187200,5,314,4.491228070175438

8438947,5,B004RCB8VW,"Quite a typical arthouse film, so beware, you need lots of attention to see where the story is going. The cinematography was very well-done and I especially like the ending scene of a knee-deep flood in Hanoi, where the story was left... adrift. I gave this 5 stars since most Vietnamese productions are no where near the artistic level of this film.",1421884800,,350,4.661290322580645
