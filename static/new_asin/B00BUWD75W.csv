8574327,4,B00BUWD75W,"Bought this specifically for the finesse of Sidney Lumet's (Dog Day Afternoon, Serpico) ""The Anderson Tapes"" and Connery's performance.  ""Physical Evidence is a more by-the-book affair that had Burt Reynolds phoning in another tough guy performance.  But it does have Theresa Russell to add spice to the mix, and the always dependable Ned Beatty in the ""every man"" role.  Video and sound presentation is nothing to get excited over.  Perhaps a slight better than the original DVDs.",1478131200,,481,5.207792207792208

8574332,4,B00BUWD75W,"Physical Evidence PHYSICAL EVIDENCE directed by Michael Crichton is strictly by the numbers. I always find Burt Reynolds interesting, as is Ned Beatty. But Crichton and company can't rise above the mundane production values. In THE ANDERSON TAPES, directed by Sidney Lumet, Sean Connery turns in an excellent and memorable performance in this excellent thriller competently acted, well scripted and neatly directed about a heist where everything is not what it appears to be. This film is full of great characters and suspense. And it is the excellent cast that makes this film timeless. Martin Balsam is way over the top with his character, but it really works. Ralph Meeker, Dyan Cannon, Alan King, Val Avery, Garrett Morris, Dick Anthony Williams and even Margaret Hamilton are all on hand. Look for Christopher Walken's distinctive face and creepy performance in his film debut. It will keep you on the edge of your seat. Quincy Jones composed a great score for this one.",1377561600,8,975,5.062111801242236
8574333,5,B00BUWD75W,"Okay,
these may both be 3 star movies... I enjoyed Physical Evidence (maybe its just that I find Theresa Russell extremely watchable) and any Sidney Lumet movie with Sean Connery and Dyan Cannon can't be all bad. I picked up this blu ray that has BOTH films for under $5! I can't rate this purchase as anything less than a five star value guilty pleasure. Other reviews on the individual films will tell you plot points and include spoilers if you are interested in movie reviews. I wish to review the product which is a cheap blu ray with a couple of pretty good films with very reasonable transfers that benefit from the upgrade to HD.",1372809600,12,637,4.5
