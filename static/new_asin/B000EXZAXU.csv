8161947,5,B000EXZAXU,"I originally purchased the product for our homeschool. My oldest daughter wanted to learn guitar and I wanted her to learn from a worship music perspective. That was about 10 purchases ago. We have since bought 3 more guitar courses and 3 keyboard courses and 2 bass courses. My kids all play multiple instruments now and can play together as a band and with other folks. I can't express how easy it has been to get them to learn how to play using these DVD's!

Our purchase history:
Beg Guitar original
Beg Guitar accoustic (new)
Inter Guitar accoustic
Guitar Song Learners

Beg Keys

Beg Bass

Worship Band practice DVD

Multitrack Player and about 20 songs plus super chord charts

If you want to learn worship music or you want your kids to learn, this is the way to do it. Just sit down and make the time and do the lessons. Musicademy has so many products that work together to make a complete package and everything is so reasonably priced. We are with the US Military in Italy and hope to visit the Musicademy Studios in England this summer for some private lessons!

Last note....if you are playing acoustic guitar and have not been to your guitar shop to have your guitar 'set up' you need to run and not walk and pay the $40 to have it done. It will make any guitar (except the most expensive) soooo much easier to play.

8161949,5,B000EXZAXU,"Bought this for my husbands as he is ""relearning"" to play guitar after several years of being idle.  He thinks it is great.  He has worked through their beginner series and is starting this one.  He finds them easy to work with, learns a lot of new stuff and enjoys the format for learning.  He would recommend it to anyone wanting to get better at their guitar skills.",1318291200,,369,4.382352941176471
8161950,5,B000EXZAXU,"I wanted to buy the volume 1 of the keyboard series because it seemed expensive especially if the DVDs were not really good but I took the plunge and bought the beginners series of the Musicademy Beginner's Worship Keyboard course. I am so glad I did.  It was worth every penny.  I was struggling playing melody with a piano teacher for quite a while.  So when I started with the DVDs, I was so impressed how quickly I was progressing and how much I was enjoying it.  Needless to say, I since then bought the intermediate and the advanced and they are equally top notch.  Tim Martin is a great teacher and the pace is just right.  The website is full of information [...].  As far as the intermediate DVDs are concerned, again the pace is just right and there is a lot of material being covered.  I really enjoy having a singer and a guitar player playing along with Tim as part of the final practice for all the songs.  It is just a fun added touch.  I also started guitar and got their DVDs as well.  They are first class videos and their customer service is outstanding.

8161951,4,B000EXZAXU,"The Intermediate Worship Guitar box set is a pretty good deal. There is lots of information presented. I would classify it as more ""early-intermediate"" than intermediate though. Either that or I'm a better player than I thought I was. :-) A lot of the stuff on there I knew already. I appreciated the sit-down lessons with Stu about History Maker and Majesty (Here I Am). I also appreciated the explanations of using delay effects. I would have liked to see some more in-depth info on the use of effects. Most of it got skimmed over pretty fast. I would have liked to see the material presented in a little more ""sit-down lesson"" format where Andy would give a lesson that I could work on for a week and then come back next week, go to the next lesson and Andy would give a lesson where we could apply what we learned the week before. I feel like the new reduced price is a decent value (you can get it for about $45 now), but the original price was not a good value. Overall it's a winner though and would be good for students who are basic beginner guitarists.",1294185600,,1062,4.3686868686868685
8161952,5,B000EXZAXU,"I bought this Intermediate Worship Keyboards course for my high school aged son who has been playing piano for 6 years.  He has been classically trained and was having a horrible time trying to play in a contemporary style with a group at church.  His piano teacher either couldn't or wouldn't help him to learn to play along with a band and this course has been filling in that gap for him.

Our first impression of the video series wasn't a good one.  The teacher is dull, is usually just reading off cue cards, and there is little creativity as far as filming goes.  The people generally stand still and simply look at the camera.  The course starts off at what I would consider to be a beginner level (hand position, how to use the sustain pedal, very basic chords).  Thankfully, the lessons picked up as the videos progressed.

There is no way we could get 6 hours of lessons with someone locally for the price of this video set.  It was well worth the cost and covered a lot of material.  The nice thing about it being on video is that lessons can easily be reviewed over and over again.",1267574400,3,2251,4.768041237113402
