But the protectors were too strong and wouldn't leave."") with the present (some investors are turning bum f into a golf course/residence.) Bigfoot is running around killing people. Sounds pretty typical, but you never see bigfoot (c'mon - at least show us some guy in a dime store costume at least!) Very little blood, horrid acting, plot holes & continuity errors. For people who have to collect every bigfoot movie ever made. Casual fans will be bored to tears.",1336176000,,540,5.011111111111111
8388793,2,B0035AC5G4,"If you are expecting a Hollywood style movie this one is not for you.  If you would like to see a better than average high school video project then this is a good movie.  A mix of documentary, native american history, myth, and fiction all rolled into a movie that attempts to combine drama, horror, and comedy all into one.  The premise of the movie was not tied into the modern setting very well.  It took most of the movie to figure out how the opening scene tied in with the main movie.  Jon Paul Gates character had issues but these were not developed and you weren't sure what they were until the movie was nearly over.  Had we known what he was doing and why the movie would be greatly improved.
The biggest disappointment in the movie is that the final outcome of the mysterious bad guy is not shown.  Did he get away with it????
Don't buy this movie. Get someone you know to buy this movie and then borrow it from them.",1253145600,2,929,4.274285714285714
8388794,4,B0035AC5G4,"I read where this is Bill Barton's first movie, and I think he did a great job to begin his movie making career. He's very creative and is not afraid to try new ideas. You can tell he wants to entertain us with everything he does. This movie is on the style of the Blair Witch movie, but definitly a step up from that. Hope to see more of his works soon. This movie was very suspenseful and kept me entertained throughtout the movie with different tactics to help you see bigfoot in a serious side and a funny side. Loved it from start to finish. A lot of suspense, but not too much blood and gore. Jan the fan.",1250294400,2,611,4.1
8388795,5,B0035AC5G4,"Blood Forest is by far the best movie I have ever seen!  I love big foot movies, and this one by far exceeded my expectations.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to enjoy a classic thriller.  John ""Arkansas"" Davis is a wonderful actor in this movie and I cannot wait to view his future projects.",1250121600,,310,4.310344827586207
