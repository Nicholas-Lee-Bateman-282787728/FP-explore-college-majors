8459669,2,B000X5SXKQ,"While the story of this drama was good, watching the drama and trying to figure out the, HORRIBLY translated, subtitles was a nightmare. The subtitles were poorly translated, from missing words, referring to wrong gender and wrong tense, it was very hard to figure out what was going on at times.  I had to pause the video many times to look at the scene and try to figure out what the poorly translation subtitles really meant. However, i managed to get through the entire drama.  I would suggest ordering from a different company because of the subtitles.
