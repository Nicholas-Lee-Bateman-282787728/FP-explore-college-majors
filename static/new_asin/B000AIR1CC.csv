2388882,5,B000AIR1CC,"This verison of the Phantom is like watching a picutre diary of the Phantom and Christine's love story. THe love story begins when Gerard Carrier(Burt Lancaster) is dismissed from his post as manager of the Paris Oper house, and new manager named Cholet and his wife Carolotta take over management of the opera hous. Erik the Phantom(Charles Dance) can't stand Carolotta with her diva personality and her husband who will give her anything she wants. At this time of transition Christine Daae(Terri Polo) comes to the Paris Opera house sent by the Comte de Chagny(Adam Stoke) for music lessons. Carolotta can't stand the fact that Christine is beatiuful and lovable so she puts her to work in the costume department. She has no place to stay and lives in an old storage room in the Opera hous. One night as Christine is singing by herself on the stage Erik sees her and approaches her with an offer for music lessons. As the lessons progress Christine becomes an angelic singer and Erik the Phantom falls more in love with her.
Weeks later, she sings at the Bistro and everyone is awestruck with the voice that came from the silent girl. Christine then begins to rekindle her relationship with the Comte de Changhy. Later she is asked to sing the lead in ""Faust"", but Carolotta gives her something and she loses her voice. The Phantom is fuirous, and he makes the...fall. Then he takes Christine down to his lair where he reverages Carlotta for Christine. Carrier finds Christine and tries to convince her to go, but she doesn't leave. Carrier begins to tell her the story of Erik's past, and he confesses that he is father to Erik. Christine decides not to leave, and goes on a pinic with Erik in the lovely forrest near his home. She asks to see his...and faints. Then Christine tries to escape and does. Soon, ""Faust"" is sung again with Christine and the Phantom and the end of this movie will touch your heart and make you feel romantic!
This film is highly romantic unlike the other Phantom reworkings of the story, and was based on a play by Arthur Kopit, which is supposed to have been the greatest hit to never come to Broadway or the West End. The director of photography did a wonderful job with the frames of this film. The light is lovely, and though the film is slow-paced you feel as if is it worth your time for the character development. Charles Dance and Terri Polo definetly have chemistry on screen. Though it may have never made it to the big screen this film is made with the greatest quality work. This great for any Phantom fan who didn't get enough from ALW 2004 film, I wonder why they won't do another one? Recommended for family watching as well. Praise all artist who worked on this film with such loving caring.",1183766400,3,2740,4.593877551020408
2388883,5,B000AIR1CC,"I first saw this version of the Phantom several years ago, on A&E, for Mother's Day and was swept off my feet. I hunted all over for it everywhere, except online, with no success. I hoped that this was the right version of the Movie I was looking for. I didn't get my hopes up until the openning scenes of the Opera House. I lost my breath and cried in those moments because, I had found it. I cast off my plans for the day to stay and watch. By the end of the movie, I was swept off my feet again. My second time with this chance to see this one again, I was left in an afterglow that could only be explained with chocolate covered strawberries, champagne, and being wrapped in silk. Everyone is going to be jealous they don't have one....",1178668800,3,740,4.145833333333333
2388884,5,B000AIR1CC,"This is the best of Phantom--the production in London is excellent, the newer version is well done--especially the beginning, yet for me, none compare to this version of Phantom.  One of the best...great enjoyment.",1172275200,8,214,5.294117647058823
2388885,5,B000AIR1CC,Oh...my...gosh! This is best film version of The Phantom of the Opera ever!!!!!!!! Charles Dance is brilliant as the Phantom!!! He was meant for the part of the Phantom! Burt Lancaster was great as the Phantom's Daddy;It's so depressing that he's dead:( Teri Pollo was great as Christine as well.,1155081600,4,296,4.94
2388886,4,B000AIR1CC,"I watched this version when it came out on TV and taped it, but I then lost the tapes over the years after I went to college and then got a household of my own. All I remembered was that the back story on Eric was riveting, and that Christine's voice was angelic. And, of course, that I hugely enjoyed it the first time around. I couldn't find this version anywhere. I have, since then, read the original book, and seen the Broadway show and the recent movie with Emmy Rossum and Gerard Butler, and a couple of other versions whose details I don't recall.

Then, finally, here it came on Amazon, and I jumped at the chance to have it again. It moved a little slower than I remembered; it was a little dated, of course, and Carlotta was more comical than anything else. But it still enchanted me, and I was pleasantly surprised.

No other version of this story gave any background on Christine and Raoul, and why she'd care so much for a guy she hadn't seen since she was a child. Finally, someone took the time to give us a glimpse of their history, even though it was short and a bit shallow and without dialogue. But seeing them together as children made a difference. I could finally understand, at least a little, the place he held in her heart. (Only, goodness, in every version it's this way, could they please give Raoul a decent haircut so he doesn't look like a girl! Geez.)

Even better was the history of Eric and his parents, both of whom played a pivotal part in his life. I enjoyed the Andrew Lloyd Webber telling of the Phantom's tortured childhood, grisly though it was, for it explained much about his ""distorted soul,"" as Christine called it there. But this in-depth telling was full of unconditional love from Eric's mother, which touched me deeply, and of the continuation of that love and even greater compassion from Christine. In the A.L.W. version, Christine's compassion is mixed with horror and hate, and she bounces like a pinball between her revulsion and attraction to him. None of that here. Our Christine feels for him. She wants to save him. She is sure he is *worth* saving. A.L.W.'s Christine could have saved her Phantom, her ""Angel of Music,"" I am sure of it, were she not so gripped with her obsession with Raoul (which, I'm convinced, is so deep only because she associates him with the time spent with her late father) and her fear of the Phantom. Her choices were disappointing. Our Christine here is so much better. She pleads with them both not to harm each other, not caring to hide her affection for either from the other; her plainness and unrepentant honesty about her love for Eric makes her a heroine. And our Eric makes a dignified exit from a potential life as a curiosity and a freak with a tragic but touching finality.

The characters and basic storyline are present in all versions, but this one, while the telling of it is a bit dated, is still enchanting and more in-depth than others. I highly recommend it. As an aside, it's a kick to see Teri Polo of ""Meet the Family"" and ""The West Wing"" here in such an early role. She does a great job, and carries off her part quite well.",1147478400,34,3134,4.473776223776224
2388887,5,B000AIR1CC,"There are no words to describe how unbelievably Beautiful this version of Phantom of the Opera is.

It is THE BEST Phantom of the Opera you can buy on DVD.",1142467200,2,155,4.166666666666667
2388888,4,B000AIR1CC,"This two-part televison version of ""The Phantom of the Opera"" is a mixed bag to be sure, but it does have its moments. Clearly this is a post-Lloyd Webber version of ""Phantom,"" highlighting the romance between the title character (Charles Dance) and Christine (Terri Polo) even more than the Broadway show. For once, the love triangle between teacher, pupil and Philippe (Adam Stroke), the Count de Chagny, is realistic; which is to say, Christine really has a choice between the two men who command her affection. Of course, the paradox is that the more romantic a figure the Phantom becomes, the less he can be seen as a deadly maniac roaming at will through the Paris Opera House. The result is that when this Phantom kills intruders in his subterranean realm, I found it hard to believe because it went against Erik's character (cf. the 1989 film version with Robert Englund of Freddy Krueger fame).

One of the strengths of this version is the use it makes of the opera part of the title. There is a wonderful scene early when Christine has come to the big city and has joined the chorus of the Opera. One evening she is signing at a local tavern and the managers of the Opera House convince Carlotta (Andra Ferrol), the egotistical diva, to go up and sing with the girl. However, it does not take long for Christine to blow Carlotta away, and when the diva flees from the stage we have clear proof as to who has more talent. The finale of the mini-series involves a production of Charles Gounod's ""Faust,"" which is one of the best uses of an opera in a film since a production of ""La Traviata"" popped up in ""Pretty Woman."" The choice of ""Faust"" is a masterstroke, not just because the opera is actually sung in French, but because there are some strong parallels between the story of Faust and that of the Phantom. This allows for a rather surprising and haunting use of the opera's climatic aria.

I know there will be strong disagreement on this score, but I also appreciated this version's approach to the Phantom's disfigurement. There is a pivotal scene early on when Christine actually tries to persuade Erik to remove his mask, maintaining that she can look at whatever is beneath it with eyes of love. When the mask is removed the focus is not on his face but rather on Christine's as she bases from shock to horror to senselessness. It is that look, along with Erik's cry of anguish, that carries the scene. More importantly, it sets up an even better scene at the end of the film. That first scene is clearly influenced by the Broadway version, where the audience never sees the Phantom's face at that point, just Christine, rather than the immortal scene where Mary Philbin unmasked Lon Chaney in the classic silent version. Meanwhile, the film's conclusion actually harkens back to Gaston Leroux's original novel with regards to how Christine conquers Erik.

Editing this film down a bit would certainly be helpful; the four-hour mini-series loses about an hour once you take out the commercials, but could benefit from losing another half-hour or so. The performances are competent, with Dance evincing charm as the Phantom without a real undercurrent of menace. Polo is a tad too emotional at time and has a lot of lip-synching to do with all the opera singing, but there is an earnestness that matches the character. Stroke has the unenviable tasks of trying to convince both Christine and the audience that she should pick his character instead of the Phantom. Most of the supporting cast are assigned various roles of comic relief with French accents, while Burt Lancaster gets to bring some dignity to the proceedings as the former manager of the Paris Opera House who knows more about the Phantom than anyone knows.

The key thing is that this 1990 version of ""The Phantom of the Opera"" is not going to be the first one you view. You have to see Lon Chaney's silent version and at least listen to the Broadway musical (paying copious attention to the libretto so you know exactly what is happening). The 1943 Claude Reins film involving acid being thrown and music being stolen is optional. But the more you are familiar with the various tellings of this tale, the more you can enjoy what writer Arthur L. Kopit and director Tony Richardson (""Tom Jones"").",1135987200,38,4280,4.7026666666666666
2388889,5,B000AIR1CC,"Words can't even describe how much I love this Phantom Of The Opera film! When my mother borrowed it from the library back in 2003, I was a bit skeptical to watch it because before watching this one, the only other one I saw which was in the 90's, was some horror version which I think was Dario Argento's version and it was so boring and the main storyline bored me. I hated it so I wasn't jumping for joy when I saw that my mom had borrowed this 1990 version. I know if I started with the Lon Chaney version, I would have been more excited because even though the Lon Chaney version isn't my favorite, it's a good film and I do like it but at least I've seen it since this 1990 one and that's all that matters. I then just decided and took a chance and watched it and man did I totally fall in love with it!! As a matter of fact, my mom had it for a couple of weeks and I saw it at least once a day until she had to return it. It became this daily thing and then right after she took it back, I ordered my own copy and have now seen it over 100 times and never get bored of it. This is the most romantic, passionate and emotional Phantom Of The Opera I've ever seen!!! Why, this is the most romantic, passionate and emotional movie I've ever seen!! I've seen many other versions since this and no other Phantom or any movie for that matter, could even hold a candle to this masterpiece!!!

Charles Dance, who is now my favorite actor of all time because of this movie, is the best Phantom ever!! Forget Lon Chaney, which I've seen, forget Claude Rains who've I've also seen, forget Michael Crawford (who've I've heard from the cast recording and seen a whole bunch of videos of him from Phantom since 2003 which I know isn't a whole lot but just from what I've heard and seen, I still love Charles the most), Robert Englund and even Gerard Butler who've I've seen too because Charles Dance is the most romantic, passionate, sweetest Phantom ever and no one and I mean NO ONE could ever do a better job than Charles!!! Don't get me wrong, I like all the Phantoms I listed above, I'm just emphasizing how much I really love Charles!!! I didn't even know about Charles Dance until 2003 when I saw this magnificent film!!! The most romantic scene is between Erik and Christine who is played by Teri Polo (Meet The Parents/Fockers) on this picnic and I love everything he says and does and I can't stop watching that scene over and over again. I totally love the clothes he wore during that picnic scene and really impresses me! Why can't there be men out there today that dresses like that? There is also a couple really sad scenes with The Phantom/Charles which I won't give away but I start to cry every time I see them. If I didn't know better, I would say Charles Dance/The Phantom is really in love with Teri Polo/Christine because Charles makes it look like he really loves her especially this one sad part where he's crying that actually makes me cry too, he really makes me feel and see his pain. I just have totally fallin' in love with this movie and Charles Dance as an actor and it's because of this movie and of course Charles' sexy British accent which I totally love, that I've bought other Charles Dance movies that I never saw until I got them.

The Phantom's father Gerard Carriere who is played by Burt Lancaster (Field Of Dreams) is really good also. Just last year, I found out that Burt Lancaster had passed away over 10 years ago from a heart attack and I still feel sad about it because he did a wonderful job as Erik's father and in other movies like Field Of Dreams and it's just so sad knowing that he's not even alive anymore! And in this film, Christines' love is not Raoul but Phillipe who is played by Adam Storke (The Stand). I will say this: If I were Christine, I would have picked Erik because Charles Dance makes him so romantic and passionate and even with the mask on, he is so handsome and the most important parts are his mouth and eyes so I would have definitely picked Charles Dance/The Phantom. Carlotta is very funny is this film also, especially in the Opera scenes, it's so hilarious!

I love the music and the dialog and the singing and even though the singing parts were dubbed, it's amazing. Mich&egrave;le Lagrange, who did the singing for Christine/Teri Polo has one of the most beautiful voices I've ever heard.

In this film, the following Operas/excerpts were featured:

GOUNOD: Faust

VERDI: La Traviata

BELLINI: Norma

There is this one scene where Christine sings at the Bistro and the Opera piece that Christine sings is called ""Par le rang et par l'opulence"" from ""La Fille du Regiment"" (the daughter of the regiment) by DONIZETTI. Hearing these Operas have made me start really getting into Opera and has made me buy real Operas on CD and soon, will have all the Operas on CD that were featured in this film. The Operas sound incredible!

But what really gets me every time in this film is Charles Dance's performance as The Phantom Of The Opera!! I am completely taken by Charles as an actor and there will never be a better Phantom than Charles!! Never!!!

This Phantom film is my all time fav along with the 2004 one but if I had to choose between the two, it's so obvious which one I would ultimately pick: Charles Dance!!! If only I could find a man who dresses the way that Charles/The Phantom dressed during that picnic scene and was as romantic, I would be in heaven!!!

One more thing: This film version actually was filmed in The Paris Opera House in France!

And no one and I mean NO ONE could ever love Charles Dance/The Phantom or wish that they were Christine as much as I do!!! Never!!!

This Import version contains extras like the Theatrical Trailer, Cast & Crew info and a Photo Gallery.",1123286400,29,5764,4.380729653882133

I've seen so many different film and stage adaptations, as well as read multiple book adaptations of this iconic story. However this version has quickly jumped to one of my favorite adaptations of this tale, only being surpassed by Susan Kay's novel ""Phantom"".

Charles Dance blew me away with his acting in this. Usually Erik is portrayed with the half-mask that is featured in the musical, as it is hard to gauge the expressions of an actor from far away. But in this film/mini series we get the full mask and still are able to see and feel all of the emotions being developed thanks to Charles Dance's incredible acting with his eyes. I'm so impressed with how he managed to pull that off. I also enjoy the ending to this version much better than any other version I've come across so far.

It does deviate from Leroux's novel quite a bit and also isn't closely related to elements of the musical either, but most of the changes I enjoyed even though it was not what was expected.",1388102400,,1043,4.455497382198953

I have to admit I was kind of leery of ordering this DVD seeing that it doesn't really qualify as an official studio release.
The cover is weird since most of it is in Korean and the review on the front is not a review for this particular mini series.
But I can look past that since the DVD is exactly what I have been wanting. The full mini series starring Charles Dance as the Phantom and Teri Polo as Christine.
Also for it not being an official release, the picture and audio are very good. The audio is the original English audio track to this movie. You have a choice of Korean subtitles, English subtitles or No subtitles. These are easy to turn on or off.
Charles Dance does a great job with the role of the Phantom. He's charming but also has his dark moments.
Teri Polo is equally good in her role as Christine. The new girl in town trying to make her way in the world and perhaps find true love along the way. I also like how they have little back stories of Christine's relationship with Phillipe and the backstory of how the Phantom came about.
There is singing, but I wouldn't call it a musical.
So if you're looking for a good 'Phantom of the Opera' movie  without all the lavish musical numbers. This is the one I would recommend.
I think it would make a good companion piece to the musical starring Gerard Butler.",1383004800,3,1541,4.153846153846154

2388937,5,B000AIR1CC,"This is the best take on the Phantom of the Opera tale ever to be presented on screen. This brilliant TV series presents the Phantom in the most emphatic light ever to an audience, and is sure to have you sympathizing with the Phantom.

The story revolves around the phantom, a disfigured child borne to a famous opera singer, who having lived under the sewage passages beneath the opera house, one day comes to notice the beautiful aerials being practiced by a girl recently employed as an assistant in the wardrobe department by the opera house, and, being captivated by her voice and her resemblance to his mother - the only person who had ever been able to accept him despite his hideously deformed face, takes her under his tutelage and manoeuvers to secure her a prominent role as the leading star in operas staged by the opera house, thereby, giving birth to her phenomenal rise to fame and popularity.

Not satisfied with being her mentor, he seizes her from the opera house and takes her beneath the caverns of the opera house and, among other things, takes her on a picnic, treating her to the delights of life in the sewage passages beneath the opera house which he has transformed into a beautiful realm all his own, and she, being taken with him, desires to see the face beneath the mask which he utilizes to keep his disfigured face concealed, and, succeeding in removing his mask, finds herself losing consciousness at the hideous sight.

After being rescued from captivity by her boyfriend and her one sole patron, she attempts to call out to him from the sewers through a performance in the opera house, and, succeeding, misleads him to the notion that she is in love with him. The movie end, with the phantom attempting to make her choose between him and her boyfriend, and being tragically shot to death by the police inspector who was attempting to rescue her from the clutches of the phantom.

This television drama constitutes the only and best attempt at the dramatization of this Hollywood classic by the broadcast media and remains the best adaptation of the classic I have ever seen.",1355097600,,2109,4.7073170731707314
2388938,5,B000AIR1CC,"I will admit that when I bought this, I was a little skeptical, having no idea who Charles Dance was. I started comparing it to Webber's POTO, which I love, but realized that this version was so much more detailed than Webber's. Erik's background story was heartbreaking, but provided a wonderful insight to his life. Whereas Webber's Phantom is more mysterious, Dance's character is more life a regular guy put in an unfortunate situation, and he tries to make the best of it.
I highly recommend watching this version!! It's fantastic!
This whole Korean DVD thing, however, confused me. The movie is in English, with the option of Korean and English subtitles. The special features, which is just a little biography about the cast, is in Korean. If you really want to read about the cast, try to find a DVD from the USA.

2388940,3,B000AIR1CC,"Although vendors list this Korean release as ""licensed"",by all appearances it is not. The cover art is a grainy reproduction of the Image release with Korean added as well as a quote from a review of the Darwin Knight version of Phantom of the Opera,an entirely different production. I can find no name for the releasing company,at least not written in English. The menu on the dvd has graphics from Andrew Lloyd Webber's  Phantom of the Opera. Bootleg it may be,but a well done one. I feared the picture quality might be that of a worn vhs tape. Not at all. It is sharp and crisp,as clear as any legitimate release. The sound quality is good. And it has optional English subtitles (as well as Korean). In this aspect,the bootleg is actually better than the out-of-print Image release. The English subtitles are certainly not flawless,and in a few instances,they completely obscure the meaning of the sentence. However,overall,they are decent,particularly if you have only minor hearing loss (as I do) and only use subtitles/captions as an aid. If you are deaf,these subtitles may not be sufficient. However,they are quite a bit more accurate than the cheaply done closed captions found on many old tv shows playing in syndication.
  Be careful when purchasing this dvd. First,this is one of the very rare occasions that Amazon does not have the cheapest price on a video.  Currently,this disc is available through vendors on another very popular website for about ten dollars less than Amazon vendors are pricing it. Plenty of copies are available but they can be hard to locate. Simply search ""phantom opera"". You may have to go through pages of search results . If you search ""phantom opera Charles Dance"" you will likely only get results for the unaffordable OOP Image release,not this Korean release. When you do locate the listings,check the details each vendor has posted for the disc. It should state 189 minutes with optional English and Korean subtitles. I have seen at least one vendor selling a copy that lists a running time of 90 minutes. Also,some copies only have Korean subtitles. These copies may be of good quality. I can't say,because the only copy I have has both English and Korean subtitles.
  Now,about the mini-series itself...well,I can't say that it's good. Charles Dance is the cheesiest Phantom I'Ve ever seen and his accent seems to change from American to British as the production goes along. Like other film and television adaptations of the novel,this is not faithful (a far cry from the source material) and is really kind of corny. That said,it is entertaining. I watched most of it in one setting and never found myself getting bored and my mind wandering. And I have to say,while Dance's Phantom is not what I ever would have imagined  for the character,it is somewhat enjoyable to watch.

The review in the upper right hand corner ""David Staller, in the title role, is as impressive as Michael Crawford and as Christine, Elizabeth Walsh is warmer, both vocally and emotionally than Sarah Brightman was on Broadway"" is actually for another version of Phantom of the Opera and not this particular version. Also when you put the DVD in to play it comes up with art work from the Andrew Lloyd Webber version of Phantom but I checked by playing a few things on the DVD and yes it is in fact the Charles Dance version. It's just packaged strangely but what can you expect from a Korean import I guess? Also don't forget to turn of the Korean subtitles before you watch the movie! ;)

This version of POTO is basically outlined after the classic, but the similarities end there. In this version the Phantom (Eric) we learn who he is and where he came from and a background more palatable than the book. The relationship between Christine and Eric grows over time and you have a love triangle worth watching. Charles Dance gives the Phantom a heart and gives the character depth and feeling.

Best movie version of 'Phantom of the Opera' I've ever seen (nothing tops Susan Kay's book, though).  Charles Dance was PERFECT as the Phantom.  I cried so hard at the end (seriously.  I was sitting on the couch while my grandmother watched Deal or no Deal, and I was just sobbing quietly.  He was so noble!).

I've never seen an Erik with such a great sense of humor, though.  Kay's is almost the same, but the self-degredation which always makes me want to cry kind of tempers it there.  But in this, just pure funny.  That's not to say that I find everything funny, just that part where Erik and Gerard are talking at the beginning.

I loved that Erik's history wasn't quite so dark as usual.  It was nice to see that, thought his father was a bit misguided, he had loving parents.

And that Christine does, in a way, love him, that rocks.  She doesn't hate him, never could, and even says, not in as many words, that she loves him to Philippe, just not the same way she loves Philippe (pe",1245110400,,1226,4.242424242424242

8078581,4,B000AIR1CC,"I saw this on TV back when I was a preteen. I was obsessed with the story of the Phantom, and the idea of the tragically unrequited love of a horribly deformed, yet borderline superhuman anti-hero (Quasimodo qualifies here as well as ""Beast"") towards a beautiful, sweet natured young woman who feels sorry for him and even learns to ""love"" him eventually. This concept grabbed me at an early prepubescent age and must have had a deep psychological effect on relationships to come! Not that I'm bad looking, hahaha, but the dynamic of alienation and the internal, psychological ""scars"" interfering with having a nice sunny life has made relationships difficult. Damn you Leroux!!! And you Webber, for making the ""Darkness of the Music of the Night"" so appealing to me! My first Gothgasm was with Webber's Phantom, not Bauhaus. Anyway, I had read the book, seen the classic films, been to the musical twice, all before I had sat down to watch this film as an alienated 11 year old misanthrope. I remember being immediately impressed by the on-location filming. The movie just looked, felt, sounded and tasted gorgeous. The liberties to the story didn't bother me much since most Phantom films really don't follow the original novel. The one thing that really let me down with this potential masterpiece was the fact that the unmasking scene was completely obliterated for the sake of showing Christine's compassion, and sexual attraction to Erik. The filmmakers didn't want us to see him as a ""monster."" Because what makes a ""monster"" is an ugly face, not a sociopathic, homicidal, obsessive personality! This was the same mistake that Joel Schumacher made in his Phantom, by making his ""deformity"" not so bad. Here Christine faints, but we never get to see what made her faint. The Phantom's face is a character in and of itself in the original story and in most film and stage versions. It's the whole reason ""why"" the Phantom is the Phantom. By not showing this crucial element of the story, the filmmakers rob the situation of it's pathos. Still the reproductions of the scenes from Faust are quite awesome. The music and singing is superb (except when it's supposed to suck!), and the sets, photography and suspense are quite worthy. So we still need a Phantom film that does justice to the face. The Lon Chaney Phantom still holds the blue ribbon when it comes to the unmasking scene. That was in 1925! We can do better than that folks!",1505001600,,2440,4.811904761904762

I remember watching this on television in the 90s. It was shown over the course of two nights, so cut into two segments. The DVD version does the same, so you watch half the movie and after the ending credits you watch the second half.

Some customers are complaining that this is a bootleg copy of the movie. Having familiarity with Asian products and having seen my fair share of illegitimate merchandise, I see no evidence of that in this DVD. This is a Korean ""IMPORT.""

The menu on this DVD is bilingual, then once the film starts, you can simply turn off the Korean subtitles.

Here are some ways to tell if a DVD is a bootleg: 1. It is unrealistically cheap. Example: if you pick up a new season of a series that is $80 everywhere else but you see it for $10, brand new, that is a red flag. 2.
