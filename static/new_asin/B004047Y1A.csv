X'amd: Lost Memories

What an odd  anime, I really, really like X'amd, but no matter how hard I want to, I can't love it. What keeps X'amd from achieving true greatness, is its lack of development and explanation of the world of the story. For while there are many wars, governments, battles, and creatures, the show never takes the time to give you any substantial explanation for what any of them are, or why they are significant. As a result, it is always hard to feel for the characters, and the gravity of the situation they are in. The potential for true drama is wasted most of the time. Instead we're just expected to believe that war and hatred is bad, and peace and love is good. Unfortunately this is far from the first anime to have that message, and others have done it far better.
This particular story of good and evil begins with Akiyuki, an average, everyday high school student. But the anime universe seldom allows average high school boys to average for very long, and by the end of the first episode, his island home is attacked, and his body becomes the host of a mysterious being known as a X'amd. He is then saved and spirited away by a mysterious girl who has all the answers (But never gives them to the audience), she takes him to the postal airship she lives on, and introduces him to the rag tag group who also occupy it, and who will be responsible for teaching him the life lessons he'll need to learn in order to overcome his status as average high school boy, and help save the world.
 It's a shame this story doesn't rise to become something unique, because it always feels it has the potential to do so, if someone would just explain what the heck a X'amd is, besides some sort of generic supernatural guardian of the world. Part of me wonders if this isn't drawing from some well-known piece of Japanese mythology, which would explain the lack of explanation. Sadly this is unacceptable as truly great stories should be universal, so there should have been some kind of explanation.
 What this series does have going for it is its lovable cast of characters (but what anime doesn't?). They must have meant something to me for I did shed a tear or two towards the end, not something that happens often, I just wish I had understand the situation more, maybe then I would have cared when one of the characters died, and why his sacrifice was significant. The animation for the show is also quite good. It must also be noted that the English dubbing of the show is superb (save for some brief cringe worthy lines from background characters), another example of how far English dubs have come in the past half decade.  Another high point is overall atmosphere of the show, which is extremely reminiscent of Princess Mononoke. It really does ultimately feel like this anime could take place in the same world as Mononoke only thousands of years later. Sadly X'amd's world is much more complicated then Mononoke's so the simple explanations don't suffice. And neither does the ambiguous ending. Though as far as ambiguous anime endings go, this one is pretty good.
 If you can watch this show for free on Netflix streaming or some other streaming service, I would definitely recommend it. Otherwise I would never suggest paying for Blu-Ray's or DVDs or digital downloads, without seeing the whole show first, and then deciding its something you always want to have with you.",1326758400,,3418,4.63036303630363
8411907,4,B004047Y1A,"This was a close call, but some of the animation in the final episodes was really bad. Not the main stuff - but the backgrounds.  Some of the flying ships were simply yellow blots - they were either intentionally left unfinished to save money (as often happens when a series is near the end) or forgotten about (unlikely.)

The fight between the doctor and commander was uninspiring and unbelievable. Many of the sub-plots seemed rushed to conclusion ""it's the end - quick - slap something together to wrap these up!"" We even have people miraculously show up that were killed off.  The conclusion of the main plots was, in my opinion, a flop. It's as if there were two episodes missing between the final two. Or that the final episode was just so badly edited. It was still a decent conclusion, but it could have been so much better.",1318723200,,833,4.577181208053691
8411908,5,B004047Y1A,"Xam'd: Of the Lost Memories is an exceptional anime, one of the best I have ever seen.  It is currently available on Netflix and, at the time I'm writing this, is available for instant viewing.  I say that Xam'd is one of the best anime I have ever seen, and I am completely serious about this, currently it ranks in third place on the list of my top five favorite anime - and honestly I think that it is technically better than Record of Lodoss War (1st place), but my love for this anime sometimes approaches religious devotion, and so I can't rank Xam'd as number one.  I will warn you from the beginning that Xam'd is somewhat difficult to get into.  The story throws you into the middle of a truly fantastic world with very little explanation of what is going on, and then expects you to pick up the clues on the way. Although it offers a significant number of clues (way more than Ergo Proxy), I imagine that many viewers will have some trouble catching up and figuring out what is going on.  Trust me when I say that it is worth it to push through.  So, on to the review:

Overall: 10/10

As I said, Xam'd currently ranks third in my top five anime list.  So, I can safely say that I have seen very few anime that I enjoyed more than this, and I don't think that either of the first two are technically better than Xam'd, but due to either subject matter, or loyalty, they remain my top two.  At its core Xam'd is a love story, and it is the best kind of love story - a real one.  Nowhere in this anime do you find the cliche `love at first sight' or `wedding after two weeks' plots that are so common in romantic tales.  Xam'd is the story of two young people who do their best to remain true in their love for one another through a wide variety of trials.  The two main characters, Akiyuki and Haru, spend most of the first half of the anime apart, and so we see a growing commitment in their love for one another that is born of their separation. All in all, Xam'd is the best romantic anime that I've ever seen, and the romantic angle is only one part of the story.  Xam'd is a very complex show, blending themes of romance, identity, hope, loss, and the necessity of accepting pain as a part of life, all on the backdrop of a world war.  Think this sounds like too much for one show?  Generally I would agree.  There are not many studios that could have pulled this off.  However, Bones Studio has been responsible for RaXephon, Wolf's Rain, and both versions of Fullmetal Alchemist, so they have a lot of experience at this kind of thing.

Writing and Art: 9.0/10

With an anime I can't review writing in quite the same way that I would with a book. However, the writing in Xam'd flows well from scene to scene.  Transitions are strong, and while things are confusing at first, nothing is ever out of place.  If you pay attention, then you should be able to pick up the world easily enough.  The art is where this series takes a slight hit.  The art in Xam'd ranges from good to great, there is never a scene that is poorly drawn.  However, there is also not a consistent excellence in the quality of the art.  Some scenes just don't live up to the majority of the show.

Characters: 10/10

There is no bad character in Xam'd. There are some very negative characters, however there are no bad characters. Even the minor characters are well-developed, and shown a lot of care by their creators.  You will fall in love with Akiyuki and Haru, it can't be helped; you will root for Akiyuki's parents as they try to find their way back to each other; you will join Nakiami in her ever-present hope, and you will feel both frustration with and pity for the villains of the series.  As you watch this series, you will become deeply involved with each of the characters - which, in my opinion, is one of the most important aspects of any book or show.

World: 9.5/10

The world of Xam'd could be better explained, especially at the beginning of the series, and I know that this will scare some viewers away.  However, it is a complicated, fully developed (if slightly cliche in some areas) world that is both intense and interesting. There are a few aspects of the world that are difficult to accept, such as the war between the North and the South that has (apparently) been going on for the last thousand years.  However, these are very minor points to the overall story, and are fairly easy to overlook.

Plot and Content: 10/10

I'm not going to say much because I don't want to give anything away, but Akiyuki's story will take you from joy to tears and back to joy more than once.  The plot of this show is excellent, deeply thought out, and very well framed.  As for the content, there is a reasonable amount of violence (it does take place in a war after all), but this is far from excessive.  There is also one minor female character that walks around in a halter top, usually covered by a jacket.  Again, this is not excessive, but it is also not explained, it just kind of is.  So, Xam'd takes no hits from me for content.  If you get sick at the sight of cartoon blood, or you think that women should always be covered from head to toe...well, then you probably shouldn't be watching anime in the first place, but this one isn't for you.

Pacing: 9.5/10

Xam'd is a slow moving anime.  It is very well paced, and the story moves along at a near perfect rate.  However, it is generally slow.  If you don't like slow, deep stories - then Xam'd will probably bore you.  You'll be missing out, but I doubt that you'll be able to finish it.

Commentary: 10/10

This anime has some of the best thought through commentary of any I have seen for a long, long time.  This is one of the big reasons that it made it to the top of my list.  The commentary in Xam'd largely focuses around the nature of identity.  However, there are strong aspects of the necessity of accepting pain, the importance of commitment, and the need to hold on to hope.  Xam'd has deeply thought out commentary about what it means to be human, to know yourself, and to chase after both your desires, and your responsibilities.

Conclusion:

You need to watch Xam'd.  Even if you don't like it at first, keep going.  Let yourself fall in love with the characters, and let yourself learn from them.  It will be worth the effort.",1315612800,,6307,4.341025641025641
8411909,5,B004047Y1A,"I purchased this anime on a whim, haveing absolutely no knowledge on it. I was complete dumbfounded as to exactly why this hadn't reached my ears. Truely a refreshing anime. Those who enjoy anime filled with love interests will find it lacking in the multi-triangular love follies, but it does have some. It has action, comical undertones, and a deep, multi-layered story. this is obviously the last part of the anime. it's a wonderful ending and an excellent anime. good voice acting, great visuals, deep story, rich characters, so do yourself a favor and buy this anime! You will not be disappionted.",1310688000,,602,4.911764705882353
8411910,3,B004047Y1A,"The writers of Xam'd had an excellent concept going when tying off the series, but it feels like it was cut too short, or that they focused on elements that were largely irrelevant. Xam'd is almost entirely story driven. If I had to classify it, I would say it's more of a drama than an action series, which is fine if it's done right.

Being more of a drama series than action series, I personally felt there were too many conflicts left open. As for the few conflicts that did come to a close, well, they were ""closed"" far too abruptly and had little resolution. Also, there are too many questions left unanswered about key characters in the series. It's hard to elaborate on this point without spoiling too much though.

The character design felt rather lively, as did their personalities. It helped the story feel a little more believable and involving, even though I felt the need to fast forward through a good 1/3rd of the series. The animation was crisp, and the series has some extraordinary artistic design.

Xam'd could honestly use a follow up to close off the story. There are a lot of key plot points that needs to be explained, rather than being left in the dark. Regardless, I recommend watching Xam'd to anyone, mostly because of the level of originality behind the story and content. Comparing Xam'd to the other animations I've seen, it truly is in a genre of it's own.

Due to the lack of a proper ending, as well as there being what feels like too much filler content, I had to knock off a couple stars. The series's saving grace is the overall story ( not including the ending ), and the characters. The first half of Xam'd was truly the best of the series. The second half, however, felt like it was starting to stray off base and lose momentum.",1305244800,2,1768,4.498442367601246
8411911,4,B004047Y1A,"If you like steampunk, mechs, and typical Japanese lover's drama than you will like this series. It is not heavy on plot, but is heavy on action and from the start goes at 100 percent speed.",1295827200,,190,4.305555555555555
8411912,5,B004047Y1A,"Just finished watching the second half. In this second half all the different threads started in the first Volume are drawn together. This results in the action switching back and forth from one character to another in a seemingly unrelated fashion during an episode. Also a number of the characters start being knocked out, so you wonder who is going to be standing at the end. It would almost be sad if it were not for the last 30 seconds before the credits, so you will have to watch it to the very end. Most of the open questions are finally answered.

The blu-ray production values are great, and the colors crisp. The extra stuff includes clean openings and closings, but no previews or other stuff.

Summary of story: The northern country is fighting the southern country and the battleground seems to be what is supposed to be the neutral island of Sentan. A mystery girl shows up and turns a boy into a Xam'd. Later, more Xam'd show up. In this second volume a lot of the action is at the village of Tessik, and later at another place. Eventually, everyone seems to get in on the final battle.",1290470400,,1102,4.505
8411913,5,B004047Y1A,"The second half, episodes 14-26, of this awesome sci-fi action/drama anime series is contained in this blu-ray box set. The story picks up where it left off in the first box set. You are given a much healthier dose of action, drama, and comedy than in the first half of the series. Plus, some more new characters are introduced to spice up the story. The animation quality and the nice soundtrack remains at the same level. There are several revelations in store for you, so look forward to them! Honestly, I thought the ending of the series was all in all complete and satisfying. If you purchased and enjoyed the first box set, this one is a must buy.",1289865600,,653,4.495798319327731
