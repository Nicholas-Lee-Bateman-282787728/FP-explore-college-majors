7963441,5,B000067J5B,"I truly believe Jimmy Swaggart's entire family has been touched by God.  He is a human being and makes mistakes (sin) as all people are subject to do.  If you believe in God you will know the many times Satan has tried to bring this man down.. He tried to kill him when he was about 12 with unexplained ""blackouts"" that God finally fixed.  He tried to shut him up with the Scandle that ensued  to try to bring down making his ministry only 10% of what it was formally.  He has gradually made a comeback of which I am so grateful  When he asked God ""Why?""  God told him he had to bring him to his knees.  But he asked ""Why did it have to be so public?""  ""It was the only way""  I believe this.  Maybe you think I am just being neive but no I am fully aware of what happened but again why should Satan go after those he already has?  The more you try to live for God the more Satan will try to block your way.  Leave judgment to God.",1384905600,,930,3.935483870967742
