5116137,2,B0080QOLGA,"These westerns have not stood the test of time well particularly the ""Gone to Texas"" offering. The part Sam Elliot played in the "" I Will Fight No More Forever"" is quite small and a little misleading i felt but it was still the more contemporary film with respect to its viewpoint",1416096000,,280,4.403846153846154
5116138,5,B0080QOLGA,Good movies! Good quality DVD!,1409184000,,30,5.2

5116141,4,B0080QOLGA,"I bought this double DVD for ""I Will Fight no more Forever"".  I never saw it before and have not read up on the history of this.  So I cannot say how accurate it is.  It was made in 1975, and has Sam Elliott just before his hot period in a supporting role to a General, played by James Whitmore.  It tells the story of the last Sioux tribe to surrender, the Nez-Perce.  All or almost all of the Indians are played by actual Indians of various tribes.  They are relentlessly pursued and forced into battle so many times, until Chief Joseph finally surrenders in a sensible way, for his tribe and for the times.  How he fought and kept outwitting the soldiers was incredible.  According to the movie, he went on to speak on Indian affairs in Washington.

I bought my copy at a store.  The audio had to be turned up quite high, which made a humming sound all thru the movie.  But I got so engrossed in the movie, the more I watched the less I noticed it.  (Did not watch ""Gone to Texas"".)",1395964800,,985,4.208556149732621
5116142,5,B0080QOLGA,Super set!!  One of the greats of Sam Elliotts's features! If weaternstern freak like me u will LOVE!! TOM A.,1395878400,,109,4.45
5116143,5,B0080QOLGA,Came quickly and was in perfect condition.  The price was right and was just what my son-in-law wanted for Christmas.,1393286400,,117,4.85
5116144,4,B0080QOLGA,Two Sam Elliott westerns for the price of one. Both westerns were of equal entertainment value. Both in color but the transfers are a 3.5 out of 5. Sam is not the lead on 'Fight No More' but was still enjoyable. Acting and stories were good...support your favorite artists.,1382918400,,273,4.591836734693878
5116145,4,B0080QOLGA,"As with other Sam Elliott westerns really enjoyed is usual style. This did not disappoint at all, and it is recommended for all western lovers",1382572800,,142,4.72
5116146,4,B0080QOLGA,"I Will Fight No More Forever is terribly underrated, while Gone To Texas is perhaps a bit overrated.  Sam's part in ...Forever isn't large, while his in ...Texas is not terribly active.  Good films for a cheap price, good but not excellent quality.  I bought the set for I Will Fight No More Forever (worth the price by itself), & consider Gone To Texas a throw-in.",1374451200,,365,4.5
5116147,4,B0080QOLGA,"This is a good DVD you get a double whammy with Sam Elliot for us that are fans. He is very young in the ""I will Fight No More Forever"" . They are very entertaining and based on True Story in our American History.
The only drawback if it were........is that the movies of today are definately a better picture quality. They are both in color...just not what it is today. I loved both movies and I love Sam Elliot but the others acting did a fine job too.
I would say a 4 1/2 stars and the only negative would be the quality because of the age they were made.",1373414400,,558,4.036036036036036
5116148,2,B0080QOLGA,"I bought this because I like Sam Elliott.  His portrayal in ""I Will Fight No More Forever"" is fine and the movie is good, though a notch or two below excellent.  His portrayal of Sam Houston is wasted by one of the worst films I've ever watched.  ""Gone To Texas"" is episodic, disconnected, disjointed, and discordant. The story of Sam Houston's life deserves something much better.",1373241600,2,381,4.742424242424242
5116149,5,B0080QOLGA,"This duo is a real ""must"" for any real Sam Elliot fan.  Truly good movies and a fantastic actor.  Enjoyable.",1373068800,,108,4.35
5116150,4,B0080QOLGA,"A good film about Sam Houston and his efforts to build an Army in Texas that could resist the efforts and troops of Santa Anna.  He could not even consider re-inforcing the Alamo because his troops were totally unprepared.  Whe he was ready he dealt a destructive blow to the Mexican Forces and guaranteed Texas independence,",1371945600,,325,4.785714285714286
5116151,4,B0080QOLGA,I have always likes Sam Elliot in westerns. If you are not a fan of either Sam or Westerns then this is not for you. The Gone to Texas movie is the best one and I had seen it before on TV.,1369180800,,188,3.5
5116152,5,B0080QOLGA,"What is better than a western starring the great Sam Elliot? Two westerns starring Sam Elliot.  Both of these classics are worth the watch, especially if you like westerns with a historical feel.",1366416000,,195,4.909090909090909
5116153,3,B0080QOLGA,"The movie ""I Will Fight No More Forever"" was so-so.  The acting was not good at all, matter of fact, the two indians accused of stealing horses were wearing tennis shoes!  I couldn't believe what I was seeing.
The movie on the flip side of the dvd ""Gone To Texas"" was good.  Acting was very good and I had never seen a movie about the events after The Alamo.  Very interesting movie.",1364601600,2,383,4.277777777777778

8523690,1,B0080QOLGA,"Don't waste you time.  Sam Elliot fans will be disappointed in this duo.  The copy of I WILL FIGHT NO MORE FOREVER mini-series was ok, at best.  We couldn't even finish watching GONE TO TEXAS.  This one is for the Goodwill bin and hated we wasted the money on it.",1480377600,,263,4.2
8523691,2,B0080QOLGA,"This double DVD movie disk was disappointing.
""I will Fight no More Forever""
A fair account of the Nez Perce chief Joseph and his flight into Canada. Acting was fair, Elliot had minor roll. Made right fro VSH apparently. But something expected in an old film.

""Gone to Texas""
The reason I didn't give it 3 stars.
Acting was so-so, but the recorded straight from DVD was horrible. Grainy, in many places ghosts or blurry. (this was an old made for TV miniseries if I remember right)
The story about Sam Houston's life poorly done...give this one a pass",1453420800,,552,4.575757575757576
