The comedy is never laugh out loud funny, but the women keep the ""film"" afloat. See it if you like Julie Strain and women in dang bikinis.",1332115200,,315,4.180327868852459
7881535,1,6305065837,"This film is exceedingly bad, even for the genre it represents.  The same tired, formulaic plot about the good people who need to to make x amount of dollars from their business in a limited amount of time in order to save it from the clutches of the evil people.  The photography and acting are horrendous; the sets look like the insides of your nearest strip mall.  I was looking forward to seeing gorgeous babes in threadbare bikinis stripping and in various stages of undress.  There is very little of that, unfortunately. What there is a lot of however is those ANNOYING male characters who's mere presence prods you to throw a brick through your TV set.  One no talent dope is so excruciating to watch, that it's pure torture.  Julie Strain has an all too brief sequence where she does a striptease, but the camera moves away abruptly as she finishes.  Pathetic.  I saw this late one night on HBO Plus at a cousin's house.  Don't pay for this garbage on video. Avoid it at all costs.",1011139200,2,989,4.51123595505618
