I recieved the DVD quickly.  It was packaged well and in good condition.  But . . .

This worked out to be about a dollar a minute, a very short video for the money.  I was expecting more hand to hand moves that I could work on, and while there were a few, it could have been a great deal more.  Honestly, I've learned more from YouTube for free.

The production quality is lower than you would expect at this price, but the audio was passable.  An example of the inexperienced production is the fact you can't scrub along the timeline, no advancing or reversing the video . . . you put it in and it plays.  Then if you don't touch it, it loops.

Overall, I give this a D+.  Not a complete fail, but darn near.

I'm trying to convince myself I'll watch this again and try to glean some moves, but I won't. I will seek a refund.",1348099200,2,886,4.147058823529412
