8078278,5,B000AE8KWG,"Black Action Cinema is a collection of nine black action movies that have only one thing in common: they are all public domain and as such it is possible for them to be presented in highly affordable collections. I paid $9.98 for my set and that comes down to about a dollar per movie. The way that movie tickets cost nowadays, you really cannot complain about this collection.

An added bonus of this collection is the fact that many of these movies are not available on other public domain collections. Another is that you get the entire Black Cobra Trilogy starring Fred Williamson as Robert Malone.  Black Action Cinema is a great 9 movie collection.

Anyways, here is how I rate the movies in Black Action Cinema:

Great:

The Black Cobra Trilogy

Good:

The Baron (1988)
Velvet Smooth (1976)
Mean Johnny Barrows (1975)
TNT Jackson (1975)

Average:

Final Comedown (1972)

Bad:

Black Fist(1977)",1208908800,19,900,4.816993464052287
