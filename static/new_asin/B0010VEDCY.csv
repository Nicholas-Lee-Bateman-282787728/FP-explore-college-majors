8238694,4,B0010VEDCY,"A good story with interesting characters united by their weekly trip from their small Irish village to work in Dublin and return home on the weekend.  The acting is great, the characters' back stories well told in such a short movie.

SPOILER ALERT--the happy endings for all were not believable--if only life worked out so well.

The print was badly faded but the movie well worth watching anyway.",1515196800,,398,4.823529411764706
