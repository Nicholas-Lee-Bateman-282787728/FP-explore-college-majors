5689773,2,B00C3JUF38,"I found this title to be very simplistic in terms of the plot and the depth of the characters. The individual episodes were not interesting and there was no overall story line pulling together all the episodes. I ended up not even being able to watch more than about 4 episodes.
  I am an adult who likes Japanese high school anime as I spent some time in Japan. Also for me high school anime is relaxing as for most of us high school was much more simple and innocent than adult life.
  For me the gold standards in high school anime are GTO, School Rumble, and His and Her Circumstances. These all show some plot sophistication and are extremely well written. I was disappointed that Special A was not anywhere close to these titles.",1306195200,3,735,4.462686567164179
5689774,5,B00C3JUF38,"I love to watch romantic anime and this one is one of my favorites. This series combines humor with secret love. The main male lead is everything a man should be and should be able to get any woman he wants...except for ""her."" Yeah, it is that kind of plot line... man wants girl, girl is blind to it... but this anime will make you laugh out loud!!!",1305331200,,350,4.161764705882353
5689775,5,B00C3JUF38,"I read the Special A manga in attempt to find something like the unforgettable Ouran High School Host Club, and it proved to be astounding. Intruiged I bought the anime. I admit I was skeptical because this was my first anime to watch in Japanese. I loved it! The art is amazing and the subtitles are great! The plot is riviting and all the side characters are given personalities that are breathtaking. There are twenty-four episodes with four discs and six episodes per disk. The box is just standard plastic, but it holds up well. There are not many special features, but with a show like this who needs them. The opening and closing sequences are cool and there are two diffrenet openings and closings. The songs are rather catchy. I am also happy that it did not end in a cliffhanger, but wound up nicely. This anime has become one of my favorites and I hope you enjoy it!",1303689600,21,877,4.4875

To be honest I really have not shopped on amazon before and I loved the quality the subtitles everthing. And I will defenetly be purchasing more anime from this site to keep up my collection. ",1407801600,,361,4.553846153846154
5689787,4,B00C3JUF38,"I really liked this anime. It has a lot of cliches, and if you've watched anime before, it might seem kind of predictable, but the humor and the great cast of characters makes up for it. The main group of characters consists of seven people, (eight if you add Sakura), with Hikari and Kei being the central focus for a bit because of their interesting relationship. Aside from Hikari's main trait of being extremely competitive, she does lack character development, which may make the viewer a bit bored of her. While this does get saved by her optimism and determination, don't be surprised if you find yourself being more absorbed in the other characters' lives more than her and Kei. Meanwhile, Kei is the guy you love to hate. Sometimes you love him because it's cute seeing how much he likes Hikari, and other times you might feel like punching him in the face. But anyways...
The other characters are really great. They have good character development and seeing how their personalities mingled was really fun. The humor in this anime and the way the relationships play out as the story progresses is why I bought this. I really enjoyed watching this anime and I do recommend it if you like somewhat cliche anime with a humorous twist. It may not be for everyone, but I admit that I'm happy I bought this.",1405900800,,1311,4.630901287553648
5689788,1,B00C3JUF38,"The anime itself is amazing, which is why I wanted to own it so that I could rewatch it. However, the packaging for this was absolutely abysmal. As a result, the first two discs were Completely unwatchable; it would skip every few minutes.

I've tried to clean the discs but to no avail. Will probably end up returning this in the next few days.",1404000000,,345,4.390625
5689805,3,B00C3JUF38,"I got this series a few years ago on Valentine's day because of my fondness for shojo series. When I read the summary, I was happy about the concept of the genders being reversed where the guy is better at everything the girls try to do. Normally a romantic comedy tends to reverse this idea by making the girl being better than the guy because its a stereotype that a woman is better than the loser protagonist.

It really irks me when people try to throw the sexist card with how no matter how good Hikari is, she'll always be second best to Kei. Given how many anime already have the woman be better than the man no matter what he does, this argument comes off as moot.

The thing that DOES bug me though is the message that the series seems to say. ""No matter how hard you study or how hard you work, you'll never be good as the rich person who doesn't have to do anything and will be loved for not doing anything but sit there and look pretty/cute."" Ouran High School actually avoided this concept by making Haruhi the logical member of the host club and showing that despite being the poor person, she was the smartest in the school and didn't need money to get in. In contrast here, all the Special A students are there because of their family and they just happen to be good at what they do. However, you never see them work hard because they're the type of students who wouldn't need an A in order to pass. So while this is served as a running gag and we cheer Hikari on because she's the only one who runs around to do something only to almost always be bought out by Kei because he has money in comparison to her who has to get people together and do the hard work, it also can rub many people the wrong way as it did to me because its like ""If you're just going to use money to win the competition and win the entire school because of money, then what's the point in trying?""

The other thing that irked me was the queer baiting or the treatment of characters who show some gay/lesbian attitude.

SPOILERS TO THOSE WHO HAVEN'T WATCH THE SERIES.

Akira's character is defined as her not liking men and constantly worshipping the ground Hikari is on. Then she later hooks up with Tadashi later on (and for me this comes off as a weak attempt to say she's not lesbian because she spends more time beating up and insulting Tadashi even when they hook up so it doesn't come off as genuine in comparison to how she acts around Hikari).

Then we have Jun who's split personality is bisexual. That's fine and all except his split personality is treated as a bad thing for Jun who lost the first person he was dating because she couldn't stand his split personality. Yes he ends up with someone who will accept him for who he is, but it just rubs me the wrong way that the reason why he lost the first person in the first place was because of his split personality being a cassanova.

Finally we have Ryuuji and Finn. Finn is shown to be a rather cute guy and Ryuuji and Finn seem to be the established gay pairing in the series...only to turn out that Finn is a masculine woman...

So three instances of a character showing any homo vibe gets shot down almost immediately mainly because the series just pairs them up with the opposite gender (and we also have a case of just pairing people who don't have anyone with whoever is left like Megumi and Yashiro that came out of nowhere).

END SPOILERS

Honestly because of these 2 things that really bugged me about the series, it was hard for me to give it a high rating. I had my laughs with the main pairing regardless of the rich vs. poor thing but all the beta couples in comparison fall apart because of how I feel the series handled the yaoi/yuri tones the wrong way. Besides what I mentioned above, it is a good series and should give it a watch. I just honestly prefer Ouran High School better with how they handled the yaoi/yuri tropes.",1399939200,3,3896,4.295640326975477
5689806,5,B00C3JUF38,"This show is Epic all tho one of the girls voices gets on my nerves!!!
Either way this is worth every penny. On to my next anime Ouran high school host club

5689808,5,B00C3JUF38,"I just finished watching this, and I laughed through the whole thing! Hikari's stubborness and thick-skull-ed-ness, were, I think what made me laugh the most! All the characters were endearing, and I can't wait to watch it again! I wish there were more episodes! The package came even earlier than expected! Thanks!",1397347200,,315,5.076923076923077
5689809,4,B00C3JUF38,And a lot of fun - the only drawback was the overuse of the same VAs this time. Plenty have dual roles but SA just had them too cramped in my opinion. Felt like they were talking to themselves sometimes. Otherwise very good show.,1395273600,,229,4.2272727272727275
5689810,5,B00C3JUF38,Came at the time expected. No regrets in buying this. I love it. Even if hikari is stupid and doesn't realize kei's love for her. Lol,1393804800,,133,4.153846153846154
5689811,4,B00C3JUF38,It's a really good story and the characters are engaging and fun to watch. My only annoyance is completely for my preference in character voices. The voice of the female lead is grating and gets annoying the more you watch the show. I have heard the voice in other shows but never as a main character that had so many lines to say. If not for that one little peeve I would have given it 5 stars.,1393372800,,395,4.142857142857143
5689812,5,B00C3JUF38,It was really funny to me. It was good entertainment all around especially with these characters. They're crazy antics really made the show. I give it a thumbs up.,1391299200,,163,4.655172413793103
5689813,5,B00C3JUF38,"I really enjoyed this Anime!! It had the perfect amount of romance and comedy that kept me watching episode after episode. I would highly recommend it! If you like this series, I would also recommend: Fruits Basket, Karekano, and Ouran Host Club. All three are also romantic animes with a good degree of comedy!",1388880000,,311,4.777777777777778
5689814,3,B00C3JUF38,"I loved the manga to this series. And the anime was adorable. My only problem was that they did terrible at casting the voice actors and the things they say as well as the pauses between words seem a bit.. off. But still worth the price! I watched it in a day. I enjoy it, but the voice acting is kind of lame.",1388188800,,310,3.9365079365079363

5689820,5,B00C3JUF38,"The Series Special A Class follows 7 students at the top of there class and have the honor of being in this group dubbed ""Special A"" or ""S.A."".
Hikari was always the best student, athlete ect, until, Kei Takashima came along when she was 6. Now their 16 in high school in S.A. and He's the first in the class and she is second (or in some cases ""Miss Second Place""). But then Kei Takashima starts having FEELINGS for her, but she only thinks of him as her rival. Other members of S.A. have special talents of there own, Akira is a good cook, Ryu is good with animals, Jun has a special ""Dark Jun"" mode, Megumi has a singing voice that could make someone faint, Tadshi... well.. he's just here for the food (and to not have to bungee jump.)
Overall Special A is a great anime to own to realize small details the more you watch it.",1330473600,,829,4.220125786163522
5689821,1,B00C3JUF38,"Ok first of all let me say this, I really do love this anime, and it's up there on my list of ""Top Fave's"". But the way they packaged this is just...EW. They stack 4 dvd's on top of each other. That's ridiculous. Angel beats had a slot for EACH dvd, but they couldn't do that for this anime or say, Clannad. Again the anime is very good, and is really funny with some romance, which is why I like it so much. So anime=awesome, packaging=PLEASE CHANGE.",1325116800,3,451,4.195402298850575
5689822,5,B00C3JUF38,"It has romance, comedy, and heartwarming moments that makes just about anyone want to smile!
Hikari is such an admirable character and is obliviously cute about Kei's love for her. Kei's actions to try and show her his feelings are adorable and will make almost any girl blush and giggle uncontrollably. Not to mention Hikari's reactions to his ways are even more hilarious.
The other members of the S.A. are well rounded and very likable for their own unique qualities and abilities and I'm sure that almost anyone can relate to at least one of them with ease.
Each episode has made me laugh and it never gets old...!
It's an anime that will always capture you and it is definitely worth buying!",1320624000,,696,4.666666666666667
5689823,5,B00C3JUF38,"This is far and above my favorite romance anime. I watch it time and time again with great joy. I've mentioned that I would compare this to Itazura na Kiss and Kaichou Wa Maid-Sama because the plots are very similar. Kei and Hikari are rivals, but Kei is trying to get Hikari to admit she might have feelings for him. The suspense is perfect and not over-done and we learn a lot about the side characters through the two main character's journeys. If you like a good, heart-tugging romance then this show is absolutely perfect for you.",1319932800,,535,4.525773195876289
5689824,5,B00C3JUF38,"I would rate this anime as a 5 star.  I first saw it a couple years ago, and loved the characters and the storyline.  I laughed a lot during each episode, which is rare for an anime to make me do.  So happy it came out as a complete series.  I would recommend this series to fans of Ouran High School Host Club.",1317340800,,311,3.888888888888889

8577039,4,B00C3JUF38,"This anime is a cute high school rom-com similar to Maid Sama and Oran High School Host Club. In fact its like they smashed those two anime's together and got this one. Its 24 episodes long and the dub is good quality. The show is a little over the top and unrealistic at times (for a high school) but that doesn't pull away from the story or the building romances. Thats right, multiple romances! The main girl is always trying to out-do the main guy since they have been rivals from a young age. No matter how hard she tries she cant beat him at anything, but she never gives up. Its an endearing quality that makes her easy to like. The main guy is pretty bad-ass and straightforward. The main girl is oblivious to his interest til later in the show but she isn't a weak minded or helpless girl.",1450828800,,798,4.291390728476821

I been want to replace the ones that I had before. At the time, I had 2 buy 1st and 2nd season. Which I think you still can. I want the complete set.",1437609600,,419,3.872093023255814
