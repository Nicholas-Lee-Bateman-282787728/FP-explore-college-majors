1348727,4,B00004STVV,"The movie was alwrite, but it was weird how two very young people got married. And also how they managed to get out of all that troble.",989452800,,135,4.037037037037037
1348728,1,B00004STVV,"Isn't it rather odd how two well-to-do young adults who had been grounded in the yuppie work ethic decided to forsake college for marriage? Somebody should have told them they cannot afford everything they are accustomed to without the right kind of funding.
And while we are on the subject of bizzare occurences, why is the title date listed as 1989 if the college series obviously was not produced until much later? Some food for thought before blindly proclaiming it the best (or even one of the best) teen dramas.",986947200,,517,4.7555555555555555
1348729,4,B00004STVV,"Being a fan of Saved by the Bell obsessively forever. I could totally relate to everyone on the show.  I just liked Zack, Slater was cool, and Screech was the bomb!  The girls were fabulous. Jessie was my favorite because she was so smart.  Kelly was alright, but she was a little dense.  I did admire her relationship with Zack though.  Oh, Oh!  But Ms. Turtle was the BOMB!!!  In Junior high school, I acted just like her.  I wanted to be her!  Take a cool school, add six attractive teenagers with killer clothes and you have magic! How's that for a self-conscious, but smart young man. The show helped me learn alot about myself, I incorporated many of my thoughts, actions and talents from the students of ""good 'ol Bayside High.""",971395200,,735,4.507575757575758
1348730,5,B00004STVV,This was the best movie ever because. In Holland there isn't Saved by the bell anymore. So I really miss it. THis movie is great just like Saved by the bell,969753600,,156,4.064516129032258
1348731,5,B00004STVV,"Anyone who grew up in the 80's and 90's has more than likely watched Saved By the Bell.  If you're like me, you were probably a pretty big fan.  I was so excited when this TV movie originally aired on NBC, and now I'm twice as  excited that it's on video.  Zack and Kelly, the most popular students at  Bayside High, finally getting married.  Plus they include Screech, Slater,  Lisa, Mr. Belding, and even Jessie (which is kind of neato since Elizabeth  Berkeley was trying to shed her goody two shoes image by making Showgirls  around the same time)!  Anyway, it's a fun hour and a half, and well worth  the money!  Now, if only they'd release it on DVD!",962841600,22,656,4.375
1348732,4,B00004STVV,"This movie was a fitting end to a fun series. From when ""Saved By The Bell"" first came on the air in 1989 there was a magic to it. All of the cast went on to college, (""SBTB: The College Years"") and this  movie wrapped up the series. After many years of chasing Kelly  (Tiffani-Amber), Zack (Mark-Paul) has finally convinced her into getting  married. This movie follows their trek into Las Vegas for a quicky wedding  (as neither of their parents approve).  Along the way they get arrested,  become male escorts, and get involved with the mob.  It featured the return  of all of the original series regulars and a guest appearance by Gilbert  Gottfried. It features great acting by Mark-Paul Gosselaar and  Tiffani-Amber Thiessen.  If you are a fan of the series then this movie is  a must for you.",961977600,21,799,4.588652482269503
1348733,4,B00004STVV,"This TV show is rather artificial, as teens and collegiates are not too  much like this, but it is a nice show anyway. The movie shows Zach and  Kelly, both 19, getting married and all the trouble they go through to get  married. The story is fairly lame, but it is a nice conclusion to the  show's incredibly long run.",961804800,,319,4.266666666666667

Slater was awesome too and still is on the Animal Planet....How many years have they been married now in 2005.....Isn't it about time for a class reunion?

7922133,5,B00004STVV,"I was so thrilled that they made this last and final chapter to the TV show that I will forever consider my ONE true favorite of all time. When I watch this movie, it's as if I really KNOW these people! That's how attached I am. Like I'm at my best friend's wedding, instead of sitting in front of a video. I loved the video montage they played of Zack and Kelly during the wedding ceremony. And I was very proud of myself for ""keeping it together"" during the wedding, but I must admit that I completely lost it and cried like a baby when Jessie walked up to Kelly and said, ""well, Mrs. Morris"" while tearing up. Wow, I cried until my head hurt. I advise the purchase of this movie for anyone who adored the series as much as I did. It is very well done.",1095811200,2,754,4.101351351351352
7922134,5,B00004STVV,THIS WAS A WONDERFUL TV SHOW. I LOVED ALL THE EPISODES ON THIS SHOW. I THINK THAT THIS WAS A NICE WEDDING AS WELL. I AM GLAD THAT THEY HAD A NICE WEDDING BECAUSE THEY WERE A CUTE COUPLE AND ALSO ONE OF MY FAVORITE TELEVISION COUPLES.,1095724800,,233,3.978723404255319
7922135,4,B00004STVV,"A great ending to an amazing show.  It's sad to see it go, yet its great to see it end this way.  The only thing I wish I saw in the movie was more Elizabeth Berkley.  It would have been nice for her to be in the movie longer and embark on the trip with the other original five, giving the greatest cast ever ensembled one last adventure together.",1065312000,5,347,4.0
7922136,5,B00004STVV,I think that this movie is great. Since im getting married it gives me some ideas. I think anyone that is in love should see this. Especially if you have seen every episode of Saved by the bell like me. You have to see it.,1060646400,,222,3.9555555555555557
7922137,5,B00004STVV,I've watched this movie over and over again and I still haven't gotten sick of it! Also my aunt plays the woman in the pink limo that loves Screech! Seriously that's my aunt! Anyway get this movie you'll be in for a ton of fun!,1010880000,2,227,4.066666666666666
