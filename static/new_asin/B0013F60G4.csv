3105480,4,B0013F60G4,"(First of all, sorry for my English, in case of mistakes. I'm not a native speaker.)

For me, Joseph Campbell was one of the most brilliant minds of the past century! I love all his works, and they have really changed my life for the better. This Mythos series is a must, if you already know him. It may be a bit hard in case you have no idea at all about comparative mythology/religion, or spirituality concepts. Nothing to complain about the quality of the lectures here!

Now, the bad points: Susan Sarandon's appearances are quite annoying (although necessary for you to take a breath!). And, more seriously, there are NO SUBTITLES in this DVD, not even in English (I've read that Mythos 3 does have, but this one doesn't). Finally, and this is merely personal, I miss some extras. You have the five lectures and that's it, nothing else.

To sum up, ""Mythos II"" is definitely worth buying if you are a JC fan, and/or enjoy spirituality and history of religion. The package, though, is not impressive.",1330732800,,1004,4.629213483146067
3105481,5,B0013F60G4,"It is no secret the impact Joesph Campbell's work had on his listeners. He was an artistic storyteller; a talent humanly revered and required. Through MYTHOS II Campbell weaves all religions/philosophies together in order to provide the viewer not with instruction, but with doorways to discover their own spiritualism. As Mark Twain consistently directed; everyone should develop his or her own religion. Through MYTHOS I & II the viewer is walked through multiple philosophies, their development and how to develop one's own. Thought stimuli are vital to human spiritual development and Mr. Campbell provided the tour through space and time. Not once does he impose his informative lectures, but instead opens the flower of possibilities one petal at a time. For me it was Campbell's books that spontaneously combusted my spiritual catharsis that had been in the developing process for many moons. In conjunction with a plethora of writers and artists I methodically developed through fiction NOT ""The Hero With a Thousand Faces"" but 'The HEROINE with Multiple Countenances' in my 4 novels guaranteed to charge a new and improved attitude:

Campbell's lecture was unscripted and ""off the cuff"", but years of oration shows in a compelling delivery. Susan's sounded liked she was reading a children's book to the viewer.

3105484,5,B0013F60G4,"As I watch this very engaging group of lectures, I am amazed at how much Joseph Campbell brings to his subjects that is of his own experience. For example, his lectures on Kundalini Yoga are, as far as I know, unique and unprecedented. I went back and read Sir John Woodroffe's classic works on Tantra and Kundalini Yoga, and nowhere in those texts is there the symbolic and psychological understanding and elucidation that Campbell exhibits in his discussion, all of which is so valuable to Western individuals. He does this by referring to our Western systems and correlating them appropriately with some of the major aspects of the Indian experience-system. This comparative method sheds enormous light on what perhaps would otherwise be a very cryptic and obscure set philosophical ideas. Even Carl Jung in his seminar on this topic did not achieve the sort of comprehensive point of reference that Campbell does. So we ought to appreciate Campbell's contribution to Western spiritual development, for a highly understandable, accessible and meaningful translation of Eastern ideas. All the lectures in this series are packed with his experience-based insights, and therefore I strongly recommend this DVD set.",1260835200,16,1214,5.262886597938144
3105485,5,B0013F60G4,"I first encountered Joseph Campbell on the PBS series The Power of Myth with Bill Moyers in 1988, as did many people. I was questioning my protestant upbringing and that series was like a thunderbolt coming out of the blue for me. What impressed me the most with The Power of Myth was the reaction of Moyers, a longtime Baptist minister, to Campbell's analysis. He was at first shocked, then disbelieving and finally accepting of Campbell's views. Unfortunately that DVD is no longer in print, but I still have the book.
The Mythos DVD set is a series of lectures given just before Campbell's death. Mythos I is a good introduction to mythology, but Mythos II gets right to the heart of comparative religion.
Campbell's main point is that religious ideas are valuable as myth, but when they are turned into doctrines they are harmful. For example, when Christian fundamentalists deny Darwin and evolution because the bible says the Earth was created in 6 days, they are turning a myth into doctrine and in the process are denying the best scientific theory we have. As myth the creation story is valuable, but as doctrine it is a disaster.
In Mythos II Campbell examines Buddhism and Hinduism in depth and compares them with Judaism, Christianity, and other religions. This is a set, released last year in HD, that is worth watching many times.",1259193600,28,1344,4.797413793103448

He manages to engage you as a viewer even though you're not in the room with him. He exudes a passion and joy for his subject. Campbell also presents his material in a methodical order, going from Western to Eastern traditions. This allows him to present his work - including controversial views - as he sees fit, not as some interviewer asks him.

This series is ""hosted"" by Susan Sarandon, and while her comments aren't particularly informative or useful they're few and far between. 90-95% of each episode is Joseph Campbell with no other voices.

3340026,5,B0013F60G4,"The Mythos series is one of the better Joseph Campbell DVDs I've watched. It's simply him presenting a lecture, but that's as it should be. And what a great lecturer he is. He manages to engage you as a viewer even though you're not in the room with him. He exudes a passion and joy for his subject. Campbell also presents his material in a methodical order, going from Western to Eastern traditions. This allows him to present his work - including controversial views - as he sees fit, not as some interviewer asks him.

This series is ""hosted"" by Susan Sarandon, and while her comments aren't particularly informative or useful they're few and far between. 90-95% of each episode is Joseph Campbell with no other voices. I suspect Sarandon was thrown in because some marketing exec thought it would appeal to ""dumb Americans.""",1332633600,,828,4.75

It was like a clear voice of Truth was being brought into the world through this wonderful, brilliant, humble, wise self-professed ""Maverick"" of a man.

In studying his work one can come to understand the commonality of all of human experience and learn to embrace all of Humanity as one family.
He deals with similarities and things that unite us all rather than searching for things that make each of our cultures different or ""other"".

He is one of my biggest heroes and his work is a huge touchstone for me.

His work challenges us to look beyond our cultural/social/gender based dualistic ways of thinking and to embrace ourselves as elements of a vast all-encompassing wholeness.

I strongly and highly recommend reading ""The Power Of Myth"" and all his videos and books, especially the ones he created in his later life.

I would invite the reader/viewer to open their hearts and minds and to have the courage to face down the illusion that we are separate beings eking out our desolate existence in a barren wasteland and embrace the Truth of this magnificent, multilevel experience of being truly One with all that is.",1483401600,,1190,4.842364532019705

While we can do in-depth analysis on various cultures to gain an understanding of how they operated, Campbell looks ACROSS cultures to show how they are inextricably linked.  He shows us common themes and motifs that exist even today within the current, 20th-century Western Mythology.  This body of work is a true masterpiece told by a scientist, an enthusiast, and most of all, a rich story-teller.",1483056000,,501,5.160493827160494
