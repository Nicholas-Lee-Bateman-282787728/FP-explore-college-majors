1893812,5,B00009W8NH,"Many may not be that familiar with Wanda Sykes...she played the wise-cracking, hilariously jolting housekeeper in Chris Rock's 2001 film, Down to Earth.  Even with such a small role in that film, Wanda Sykes made very bit the best - funny, funny, funny!  This comedey special, Tongue Untied is Wanda Sykes full throttle - intelligent, sarcastic, political, realistic, persuasive, and of course a comedic joyride.  Every second of this show will keep you laughing.  BTW, you'll notice, once you watch the DVD, that her audience are from all walks of life...black, white, yellow, brown, purple, green...we're all there watching and laughing!",1100822400,4,639,5.297029702970297
1893813,5,B00009W8NH,"It's hard to describe in this review the comedic genius of Wanda Sykes.  Her pacing, voice inflection, body language, and joke & story-telling are perfect throughout this DVD.  Using these skills, Wanda connects with the audience in a personal way that elevates her far above the drivel of your every day comic.
Wanda's political observations are poignant and avoid becoming ""cheap shots"" by applying universal truths to what she sees.  For example, President Bush's ""sinister laugh"" gets compared to that of a villain in a classic cartoon.  And, as Wanda opines, is Condoleezza Rice, our National Security Advisor, sharing more than recipes and neighborhood talk at the beauty parlor? These are only a few of the many, many gems in this DVD.  It's not overly-political.  She makes plenty of common observations that will propel you into fits of laughter
Decent DVD extras include:  an additional comedy show by Wanda Sykes; deleted scenes; and various Comedy Central skits.
Buy this now!  You will not be disappointed.  And, you will want to share this one with your friends.",1064966400,52,1076,5.068181818181818
1893814,5,B00009W8NH,"I stumbled across Wanda's act while channel surfing and I laughed sooooo hard that I immediately jumped up to see if it was available for purcahse.  I knew I had to own it to watch over and over again with friends and family.  I'm a comedy addict and Wanda is one of the funniest (and intelligent) comedians out there.  Believe me when I say you MUST get this one and see for yourself.  Wanda's sharp tongue matches her sharp wit and she's well versed on today's politics, among other things.  This one's great if you love comedy.  Don't miss this one or you'll be sorry.  Girlfriend is super-duper funny and absolutely RIGHT on!  Buy it. And you might want to run to the potty before the laughter breaks out!",1064793600,14,709,4.441860465116279
1893815,5,B00009W8NH,"Wanda is one of the more intelligent comedians around these days. Her take on politics is really the strength of the show. And I loved how she feels the Pope should have reacted to priests molesting children. The joke about a drunk following another drunk home is hilarious! ""I saw him drive into a tree and then I thought ""Maybe he lives in the woods"""" LOL!",1064620800,25,358,4.4393939393939394
1893816,5,B00009W8NH,"Wanda is way too funny. I got this DVD after seeing her stand up comedy on comedy channel. She covers various topics, politics, relationships and other things. Her stand up comedy is witty. Your stomach will hurt after watching this DVD. (by laughing so much, of course.)",1062547200,6,271,4.787234042553192
1893817,5,B00009W8NH,"This was the first Stand Up Comedy Show I'd seen from Wanda Sykes and I became an instant fan of hers.  The video also includes a Stand Up Comedy Central Show she did, and a few other things she's done the past few years.  I really enjoyed this video.  I Love Ya Wanda!",1425427200,,269,4.037735849056604

1893821,5,B00009W8NH,Love Wanda and this was so funny I had to buy the DVD as well as digital so I would always have a hard copy. Worth it. Got here quickly and watch it over and over when traveling with no wifi in a portable or laptop.,1402704000,,215,3.6956521739130435
1893822,4,B00009W8NH,I remember when this first aired and it was hilarious!  I have been looking for this for a long time. Love Wanda's comedy.,1390694400,,122,4.304347826086956
1893823,5,B00009W8NH,"This DVD was great, it was funny and very entertaining, I liked it alot
Wanda is Hilarious, will check out more DVD's",1383091200,,117,4.363636363636363
1893824,5,B00009W8NH,"Wanda Sykes is hilarious in everything, but this may be my favorite of her standup specials, though I loved ""Sick and Tired"" and ""I'm'a Be Me"".",1363996800,,143,4.538461538461538
1893825,5,B00009W8NH,"I think she's brilliant and hilarious. And she can act out scenarios so clearly you can SEE everything she touches and everyone surrounding her. If swear words put you off, or if you're more of a political conservative than a progressive, you won't like her. But if you don't mind vulgarity with a message, you'll laugh till you cry.",1362528000,,333,4.661016949152542
1893826,5,B00009W8NH,"she is one of the funniest people alive
after seeing the dvd, she appeared in my city
bought a ticket right away",1356220800,,112,4.136363636363637
1893827,4,B00009W8NH,I enjoyed this DVD with friends. Very funny and issue driven material.  She has a fabulous sense of timing and the cutist giggles.,1355875200,,130,4.6521739130434785
1893828,5,B00009W8NH,"Netflix suggested this DVD to me.  She is so right on, about every day foibles, how people are.

I describe her as a realist - she accurately observes and parodies how the average everyperson thinks.  I think it is much harder to do something special with the ordinary.

She does not make fun of celebrities or take cheap shots at outrageous people.  That would have been the easier route: mention the extraordinary.  Sykes does not.",1297123200,,433,4.706666666666667
1893829,5,B00009W8NH,"Wanda has it all down perfect - timing, facial expression, and material. It was really great - the only problem is that I wish it had been longer.",1282003200,,146,4.25
1893830,1,B00009W8NH,"I never received this order was charged for it. (did get the money back from amazon)
Seller said it was sent, was not received. Would never order from this seller again",1268092800,,168,4.451612903225806
1893831,4,B00009W8NH,Wanda is a lot different on this DVD. She has a great streak of logic and the tongue to tell the world in her own way. This comedy is very expressive and she says it the way it should be said. This is a good one.,1261872000,,212,3.630434782608696
1893832,5,B00009W8NH,Could not have been a better experience purchasing this product.  And the DVD was hysterical.,1258675200,,93,5.2
1893833,4,B00009W8NH,I like Wanda.  I like her on standup and I like her on TV shows she has been in. This DVD is funny and I love the part about the drunk thing - driving home and following the friend.... will make you laugh for sure!  She is funny - pretty outspoken of course... kind of political yes - but that is her choice.  I buy it for the comedy!,1254787200,,334,3.8115942028985508
1893834,5,B00009W8NH,Another one of my favorite comedians!  Glad to be able to get this DVD at a great price!  I have watched it several times already.  Wanda is also one of those comedians that give a certain reality to her comedy.  Makes you think and identify with what she's talking about.,1251676800,,272,4.38
1893835,1,B00009W8NH,"If you like the ""F"" word then you will like this video. I did not enjoy it myself and will not be buying any more by her.",1223164800,,121,3.5185185185185186
1893836,5,B00009W8NH,"She's awesome! Although I preferred Sick & Tired, this was great too. I definitely recommend Wanda Sykes to anyone who likes a good laugh at life & politics, etc...",1220227200,,164,4.689655172413793
1893837,1,B00009W8NH,"I'm not sure what was wrong with this DVD but it wouldn't play at all.  I meant to tell the sender and send it back for a refund but I didn't and forgot about it.  If you buy a DVD from here, make sure it works when you receive it.",1210204800,,231,3.6
1893838,3,B00009W8NH,"This was obviously a made for television production, and transferred to a DVD minus commercials.  Every so often the program is interrupted as if going to a commercial break and then coming back from break. I would've enjoyed this more if it would've flowed like a normal DVD.",1208131200,,276,4.75
1893839,5,B00009W8NH,"I know some people think her voice is annoying, but I think it just makes her comedy even more funny to listen to.  You can tell she's sincere and that this is how she really sees life, and it's usually true.  From the government to strippers, she just gets right to the ludicrously hilarious truth.  You do wonder if the Pope ever just puts on a bathrobe and a Burger King crown sometimes, you do wonder how Christine Whitman ever got elected as head of the EPA, and you do wonder why people think having a drunk follow you home improves their own drunk driving.  But her delivery is at least half of what's funny about it.  She reminds me of those friends you had at school or some horrible job who made it all bearable by cracking you up.  It's not that she's trying to be funny necessarily, you can just tell this is how she always talks and tells stories.

I actually don't have cable but a friend of mine had the DVD playing at his place and I just about fell over laughing, I went right out and got my own copy.  I know she does TV shows and movies, but I rarely enjoy standups as actors.  So I can't speak for her as an actor, maybe her shows aren't so great.  This show, however, still makes me laugh even after seeing it multiple times.

Also, don't forget that there is a bonus show from when she was Wanda Skyes-Hall, which is just as funny.

If you like tell-it-like-it-is standup comedy without shtick and mugging, Wanda is one of the best.",1185580800,,1454,4.266423357664234
1893840,4,B00009W8NH,"This is one of Wanda's best sets! She is truly a gifted comedian and one of the best female comics I've ever seen! This is funny stuff, but she does use some adult language, so be aware. The DVD transfer is very good and there are some very good extras on this set.",1182729600,5,265,4.018867924528302
1893841,4,B00009W8NH,"Very funny, especially the last comedy central part...

I didn't so much like having to find and play the additional bits rather than smoothly transitioning onto the next screen.",1177804800,2,178,5.137931034482759
1893842,5,B00009W8NH,I loved this DVD. Wanda Sykes is very funny. I even got her second DVD Sick and Tired. That's just how funny she is.,1174867200,,116,3.875
1893843,5,B00009W8NH,"She is the funniest comedienne around, maybe ever, yes ever. At first you think she's like some Queen Latifah-um, um, um (with the sway) ""attitudinal"" (to quote Judy Tenuda) sister, then she gets all political (an' sh*t) and it's absolutely brilliant. No pseudo-intellectual  Jon Stewart left crap with that smug sarcasm. She goes for the funny bone and yanks it out; like Chris Rock. BAM!

Example. Enron rant:

""I'm ain't afraid of no gang banger. When I see a white guy in a suit with a Wall Street Journal, I run. I've never been mugged of my future.""

She is right on--seriously.  No pulling punches. Yank it out, girl! Go on.

BAM!",1174780800,2,637,4.642857142857143
1893844,4,B00009W8NH,"THE DVD WAS A GOOD ONE, BUT I MUCH ENJOYED THE LATEST ""SICK AND TIRED"" MUCH BETTER.",1170028800,,83,3.9411764705882355
1893845,5,B00009W8NH,"Wanda is one of the best comedians around - I just wish she would do more TV!!  I got both CDs that are out plus, her book and whenever I need a laugh, I only have to look at the cover and I smile and feel better.",1168473600,,213,3.5319148936170213
1893846,2,B00009W8NH,I love Wanda! She's funny in this show but I could not enjoy it due to the fact that there are FREQUENT commercial breaks (sans the ads). This is a TV program taped for Comedy Central---NOT a full length comedy performance. Just when I settled in and became really interested they'd have another break. Just fair warning for all you potential buyers....,1160006400,21,353,4.709677419354839
1893847,1,B00009W8NH,"I don't find Wanda Sykes funny at the best of times, but a friend who had this dvd showed it to me and I only lasted about 10 minutes before turning it off.

Possibly the least funny and overrated female comedian of all time...",1156636800,,227,4.159090909090909
1893848,2,B00009W8NH,"Normally, I find Wanda Sykes hilarious.  Her voice alone (similar to Chris Rock's in a way) can drive me to hysterics.  But in this DVD, I just wasn't that amused.  A couple laughs here and there but overall, meh.",1155168000,,213,4.410256410256411
1893849,5,B00009W8NH,"Wanda Sykes does it again, she is hilarious! Don't miss the shorts after the main performance.",1153785600,,94,4.9375
1893850,5,B00009W8NH,"I love it! I love it! I love it! - This DVD is a great way to sit back and enjoy a good laugh. Wanda brought basic everyday situations of why people do what they do - and spin it with her wit!

From politics to personal comics - it makes so much sense why I really enjoy her work. That's the beauty of being a comedian - creating the craft that makes sense! Another part I enjoy about this DVD is that she made fun of how ignorant people are - without having to humiliate them. It's almost as if she's voicing out what's inside our head that we try to deny, and made it extremely funny.

I would recommend this DVD to anyone. Perfect for small parties or even when your day just seems too gloomy.",1142208000,3,696,4.036231884057971
1893851,5,B00009W8NH,I just love this woman she is so funny that just the sound of her voice cracks me up. I have seen her is tv shows and movies and she is a class act in every way in anything she does. I would strongly recommend any of her works. She puts laughs back in the word comedy.,1138406400,2,268,3.719298245614035
1893852,5,B00009W8NH,"After seeing Wanda at the Irvine CA Improv last month, I  decided I must own everything Wanda.  Both her and Keith Robinson rocked -- go see them live if you have a chance.

I knew I'd seen two Wanda specials, and I looked everywhere for the other one and had no luck; could only find Tongue Untied.  Guess what???  BOTH are on this DVD !

Her half hour Comedy Central special is included in the bonus material of this disk !!

Hercules - Hercules - Hercules !",1126483200,9,460,4.218390804597701
1893853,5,B00009W8NH,Even better than her bits in movies. This DVD will make you laugh.,1122595200,3,66,4.153846153846154
1893854,5,B00009W8NH,"In this immensely hilarious program, Wanda Sykes shares her laugh-out-loud views on politics, religion, etc. Every joke is funny as the last, and Wanda's body language contributes to the humor of her jokes. Personally, I've watched this DVD many times, and I still laugh at every single joke Wanda makes. If the main program, ""Tongue Untied,"" isn't very amusing for you, I'm quite sure the other TV programs on the DVD will. At such a low price, this DVD is a must-buy. Let's just hope she churns out another equally funny DVD in the future. You won't regret buying this DVD.",1121731200,2,575,4.702970297029703
1893855,5,B00009W8NH,"I love this woman!

1893856,5,B00009W8NH,"Finally, a comedianne who's funny, pokes fun at political correctness and at the same time has FABULOUS politics.  Can't recommend this DVD or Wanda Sykes more!",1103414400,4,160,5.153846153846154
