4154311,5,B003M3A87W,"Very well made series. Each episode is focused on a different gang, inclusing interviews from current members, former members, aswell as the law enforcement agencys attached to investigating that gang. Definately some parts that may be hard to watch for some people, it is an understatement to say that this contains violence. My only 2 issues with this show is that it was made for people that watch 1 episode at a time, if you plan to sit down and watch a few in a row, you will find it gets repetative. Aswell, the first season is the best one by far, contains all the major gangs, the show kind of goes downhill from there, but thats not to say it gets worse, just not as good as the first season. I grew up in a very gang dominated city and throught i knew a fair ammount about gangs, apparently i was wrong. This series is a definate eye-opener.",1325980800,4,851,4.3584905660377355
4154312,5,B003M3A87W,"gangland is the best set of documentaries about gangs i have ever seen. They interview many infamous gangsters and take a look at the lives of these gang members. Alot of the gangs come from all over southern california. this is a part of history that needs to be remembered, not to be glamourized but to be looked at seriously, so that the average person will have at least some knowledge of how gangsters run things. especially in the area you live in. Gangland is my favorite show.",1294185600,4,484,4.511363636363637
4154313,1,B003M3A87W,"Gangland Seasons 1-6 is your usual glamorization of the Gang Life,Of Street scum,Of what Liberals feel sorry for ""The Disenfranchised"",The so-called victims of Capitalism according to the bleeding liberal,the Activist Judges,It gets 5 stars For INTEL that can be gained to fight fire with Fire. I don't want to hear the same usual defense of the Fatherless children,the haves and have nots. I grew up poor,I never thought of Fighting the Man, I rather be the Man than Some Poor Excuse,Poor Victim. And Join the Communes and Ranks of Animals and sociopaths on bent on the elimination of their own peoples and neighborhoods,I don't want to hear ""Sociologists"" talk about the Discrimination of the Blacks,Hispanics and so fourth and the banding together in Defense. All Weak justifications of Joining a Gang. You have Jesse Jackson(Like Sharpton,Race Baiters) Half Brother's Connection to the Underworld shown here,so it is informative,but is it History? I think the History Channel Like lots of Television has given in to What's Hip? and Sadly that is Reality series and History of Street Trash.",1292976000,2,1093,5.1807909604519775
