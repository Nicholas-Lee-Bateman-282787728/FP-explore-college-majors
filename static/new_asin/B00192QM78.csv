3422398,4,B00192QM78,"If your not sure about Bollywood or those kind of crazy, perky, jump into song and dance Indian movies that seem to run forever, this might be a good intro or, at least, a more palatable choice.

Synopsis: A barely B-movie grade, unhappy, crass, American actress(Ali Larter) gets stranded in India.  There she discovers friendship, work, love and a chance to be her true self.  Her love interest Prem(Salman Khan), a choreographer teaching her to dance, holds secrets of his own, and the story unfolds in typical Bollywood fashion with musical numbers, comedy and romance. Add a few gentle twists and gorgeous, Indian scenery, and you have a very pleasant, although predictable( aren't they all!), romantic comedy.

Ali Larter makes no bones about lack of dancing ability which matches her character.  She's done a few obscure movies and lots of TV and modeling(recently seen tastefully attired on a Cosmo cover).  And she does a good job transforming from B-word diva want-to-be to sensitive, vulnerable heroine.  She also sings and learns to dance. In the extras, she comes across very down to earth and sweet in what indeed had to be a most challenging role. Hopefully, we'll see more of her.

Her famous Indian co-star, Salman Khan is an amazing and somewhat peculiar sort.  According to Ali, he hardly rehearses, learns the dance steps lickety-split, and he's a bit difficult to work with.  I think his low toned, suave voice would suit radio perfectly.  I love the secondary actors best for their comedy.  Their sense of timing along with that accent always cracks me up.

American director Willard Carroll who studied tons of Bollywood flicks puts it together nicely.  The 'Making of Marigold' in the extras sums it up in a fascinating display of cultural clashes and glitches: like trying to film at the Taj Mahal, piece mealing the extravagant, musical numbers together, shooting on location and avoiding mob scenes and overall, trying to present an American tolerable movie that's still reflects the Bollywood/Kollywood/whatever format.

If you're into true Bollywood, this movie will probably annoy you; otherwise, enjoy a musical, romantic romp along with a tour through a mystical land.",1231459200,49,2199,5.086350974930362
3422399,1,B00192QM78,"The first song is a classic Bollywood confection. ""Yeh Pyaar Kya Hai"" is on repeat on my iPod.

The rest of the album is very forgetable.",1228953600,,137,4.269230769230769
3422400,3,B00192QM78,"I am now thinking of avoiding Bollywoods that cross the cultural divide and have Bollywoods with American/ British actors etc.
To give it its due this movie is better in being in India and Salman Khan emotes his socks off and mostly saves the movie.
The few musical numbers are OK but nothing special and the music, for me, unmemorable.
The American heroine goes from overacting 'Bitch' to someone who just doesnt seem to fit the Bollywoods. These crosses of culture (as with Mistress of Spices and the dreadful Bollywood Queen) make the Westerners look wooden and with limited acting range when put next to the Indian actors.
Even the beauty of Western actors fades next to some of the naturally striking (and non-Barbie doll) men and women.
I now see the point of the long Indian movies as they take time to develop characters and you end up caring more (than in this movie) who gets the girl or lives to save the day.
Unless you are starting with the idea of Bollywood and haven't been won by that industry yet, I'd go for the real thing.",1225670400,4,1041,4.542553191489362
3422401,4,B00192QM78,"As KUSC, the local classical station would have it: L.A., the creative capitol of the world! LOL  Is humanity so far down the road to extinction? In any case, if you like movies and just want to sit back and be entertained by music and dance and less than cutthroat mating interactions, Bollywood has a corner on the market. This movie is not of the quality of, say, Legend of 1900, but if you just want to be entertained, the very attractive and talented people and the light directional hand will pass a couple of evening hours and send you off to bed with the sense that, somewhere in the world, people are still smiling. You may be, too.",1220918400,3,641,4.38655462184874
3422402,3,B00192QM78,"Hollywood meets Bollywood in the '07 film 'Marigold', an enjoyable romp through Bombay starring Indian luminary Salman Khan and American actress Ali Larter. The movie begins rather slowly but as the relationship between Salman and Ali builds you'll find yourself slowly drawn into the storyline. Definitely not a classic but it does provide a solid evening of entertainment with exotic scenery, colorful costumes and music that is pure Bollywood. If you're unfamiliar with Indian films or reading subtitles this English language production will serve as a solid and painless primer on the Indian cinematic experience that may intrigue the audience enough to explore this ever-growing phenomenon further.

My Rating: -3 1/2 Stars-.",1219363200,15,730,5.517857142857143
3422403,4,B00192QM78,"I have seen few Bollywood movies in Hindi before despite the fact I don't speak the language so I was delighted to see an American-Indian co-production on the genre. Salman Khan is hot, ladies! He is emotional in this movie and I wish the producers would have inserted an interview of him on this particular work in extra. The documentary on Marigold is very insightful though. I found Ali more likeable as the film went on but not so at ease in the dancing scenes. It is a joyful movie with emotional moments and funny lines. You will enjoy it!",1219017600,22,545,4.46
3422404,4,B00192QM78,"I am probably one of the few people on this planet who saw this film in a movie theater. It bombed at the box office, mostly because the movie was given zero promotion from the studio. Still, as a fan of Bollywood movies, I really enjoyed it.

This movie is in English, making it a good choice for anyone looking to check out Bollywood for the first time. It follows the classic Bollywood love story formula, which a lot of people have ridiculed it for. Yes, it is predictable. But it is still done well. Personally, I prefer ""predictable and done well"" over a lot of Hollywood movies that have absurd swerves and surprises that don't make sense.

Anyway, the film has Bollywood superstar Salman Khan and American actress Ali Larter from the TV show ""Heroes"". The musical numbers are done pretty well as is the dancing. Overall, the movie is a lot of fun. The two of them make a nice couple, and I actually bought the love story. I highly recommend the film.",1215302400,80,958,4.468571428571429
8271644,3,B00192QM78,"While I enjoyed this movie, it's practically a ""bad movie"" that you can like in spite of the many weaknesses.  I can't say if it was the script, or the acting, or the lack of chemistry... I never really could engage with Marigold (Larter).  The dance scenes were fun, although Larter is not a particularly good dancer and except for the one showpiece that did well, she wasn't really dancing.  Some wonderful costumes.  But if the plot was going to be quite that unbelievable, there should be more dancing.",1523059200,,506,4.651685393258427

8271646,3,B00192QM78,"In this Hollywood/Bollywood ""crossover"" film, Marigold (Ali Larter), a vain and spoiled American actress arrives in India to star in a film.  When it is cancelled, she has the good luck to make a friend and find another movie.  On the set, she meets Prem (Salman Khan), whose gentleness and kindness help her to change, and they fall in love.  Prem has a secret, however, that will prevent their happiness.

The cute plot is typical Bollywood, with both romance and drama.  Songs were average, but did nothing to advance the plot; the choreography was generally good, though.  The costumes, particularly Marigold's, were gorgeous.  Khan's role was stereotypical and two dimensional, giving him little scope for acting.  Larter did a good job being unlikable, but did it so well that it was hard to warm to Marigold even after her personal transformation.  Sadly,  Khan and Larter did not have good chemistry.

Other problems I had include finding the personality change to be too abrupt and not credible, and disbelieving that Prem could fall for Marigold before this change.  By suspending belief on those points, I was able to enjoy most of the film, but it's not one I would universally recommend.",1517961600,3,1200,4.945
