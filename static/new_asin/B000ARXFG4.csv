8079160,3,B000ARXFG4,"There are some interesting views and doctrinal stand points made in this video, but it does go on a bit. A bit more grafics or input from others would help, rather than just listening to one man, who does well to string together the history (His story) from Genisis to Revelation through the window of prophesy, but does so for so long that it's easy to drift away from. Decent long-term view of prophesy.",1140739200,3,405,4.486486486486487
8079161,5,B000ARXFG4,"This a well put together prophecy. At first,I thought it was a movie untill settled down. This all about prophecy and anyone who is confused about the book of revelation should buy this DVD.It is truely well done. What a delight.",1138233600,2,229,4.609756097560975
