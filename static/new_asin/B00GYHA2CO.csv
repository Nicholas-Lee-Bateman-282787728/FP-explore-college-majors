8628718,5,B00GYHA2CO,"I had the privilege of seeing Beast Wishes for the first time at a screening at MONSTERPALOOZA in Burbank California a few years ago. I have been friends with Frank Dietz for several years and I have always been a fan of his amazing artwork, so I was excited to see what he could do in the film arena.
 I was immediately drawn into this film and found myself eating up every second. Bob and Kathy Burns are 2 of the most genuine, sincere and caring people ever, and learning more about them through this film was a treasure. Their collection of sci-fi and horror props and memorabilia is beyond belief, and I loved watching the incredible Halloween shows they created at their home. Of course having people like Rick Baker and Greg Nicotero help you out can only add to the awesomeness of said Halloween productions. I walked away from the screening feeling like a monster kid again, inspired and fired up! I have also been lucky enough to meet Bob and Kathy, and I gave Bob one of my original paintings of Christopher Lee as Dracula to add to his collection. I can't say enough good about BEAST WISHES, this is a MUST HAVE for any fan of horror or sci-fi!!",1387497600,2,1157,4.431924882629108

8628722,5,B00GYHA2CO,"This is a perfectly crafted documentary, made with a clear eye for reportage as well as a heart full of love for its subjects - and why not, when those subjects are Bob and Kathy Burns. Bob and Kathy have played a special role in the Hollywood special effects and makeup communities since the 1950s, when Bob worked with Paul Blaisdell to create the creatures for such AIP productions as IT CONQUERED THE WORLD and INVASION OF THE SAUCER MEN. In the 1960s, Bob worked as an actor on television, specializing in ape suit roles, and contributing to the magazine FANTASTIC MONSTERS OF THE FILMS while Kathy worked at Universal Studios. This film chronicles the story of their courtship, marriage and partnership, as well as their later status as the ""Mom & Pop"" to generations of creative young misfits who, under their wing, grew strong and talented and contributed countless milestones of makeup and special effects illusion to the screen.

Some of the most fascinating passages of the film are devoted to Bob's ""basement"" (a peerless collection of effects memorabilia, ranging from the original stop-motion armatures of King Kong and Mighty Joe Young to George Pal's Time Machine) and the Burns' mind-boggling annual Halloween makeovers of their own home, which became neighborhood attractions drawing people from far outside their hometown of Burbank, CA. But BEAST WISHES is, above all, a rich and entertaining appreciation of two people whose lives made a difference - to their community, to an industry, to an art form - because they have always approached life with open hearts, appetites for fun and boundless imagination.

Even if you've never heard of Bob and Kathy, even if monster movies per se aren't your cup of dry ice, this film - a remarkable directorial debut for the team of Trish Geiger and Frank Dietz - is guaranteed to win you over on the strength of the Burns' personalities and their unflaggingly positive approach to life.",1387238400,,1946,4.948012232415902
8628723,5,B00GYHA2CO,"Frank Dietz and Trish Geigers fantastic documentary is a loving and star-studded celebration of Bob and Kathy Burns' unique and influential place in preserving film history and fostering a generation of talented film artists like Oscar-winner Rick Baker.

If you are a fan of monster movies, haunted attractions or film history and don't know who Bob and Kathy Burns are, then this DVD is absolutely required viewing for you. For those who already know about Bob and Kathy, or have seen their amazing collection of sci-fi, horror and classic film memorabilia, this film will play like fond home movies. If you haven't seen their collection yet, prepare to be amazed at the amount of invaluable film history displayed in their home.

Ranging from one of the original stop-motion armatures of KING KONG to a restoration of THE TIME MACHINE vehicle, to modern props seen in ALIEN, THE TERMINATOR and much more, the Burns collection is truly priceless yet Bob and Kathy refuse to sell them on eBay or at auctions. Instead they keep these treasures safe and on display to share freely with other like-minded movie maniacs who also appreciate their inestimable value in cultural meaning far more than a prop market dollar amount.

Through interviews with film notables like John Landis, Rick Baker, Dennis Muren and many others, BEAST WISHES tells Bob and Kathys life story as well as their shared creature feature affection, which is actually how they met. Not only are the couple incredibly knowledgeable about film history and devout in preserving it for new generations, they're wickedly funny, sweet, smart people too. This documentary is so thorough in recreating their personal life and film history paths that by the end of it, you may feel youve known the couple for years. Youll certainly wish they lived in your neighborhood so you could share their creative spirit celebrating creatures, aliens and things that go bump in the night.

Fun and entertaining, everyone can enjoy this DVD documentary and bonus features.",1387238400,3,2021,5.06006006006006
