5613918,5,B00BFCMXRK,Have had this on my watchlist for awhile and saw it last night. We are still talking about how good it was today and the ending was so perfect. I understand this not being a movie for everyone as some have stated in their reviews and for those that it's not for will probably realize about 10 minutes in. I'd love to see a movie along these lines once a week if they were out there so that makes this movie a gem. Just loved it.,1495843200,,428,3.988372093023256
5613919,5,B00BFCMXRK,"Loved this silly and totally improbable tale of a corrupt Grandma Junkie..just suspend your belief and enjoy this easy viewing French cutie. The late Bernadette Lafont was funny and her portrayal realistic, quaint and touching even.

5613923,2,B00BFCMXRK,"While I appreciate the attempted humor, I didn't like a few things about this film and didn't finish.  The beginning confessional scene was a complete turn-off even though that's just her personality.  And there's really no humor in selling drugs and justifying it.",1491868800,,265,5.1395348837209305

In light of drug addiction in our country being at an all time high, watching a woman try to survive by selling drugs to drug addicts is not funny.

5614008,2,B00BFCMXRK,"The improbability of this dark comedy leaves one wondering how many of the twists and turns and stereotypes might have been eliminated while still leaving the movie depicting human susceptibility, loss, and overreach intact. Paulette's measure of her fellow man runs the usual gamut of stereotypes including Arabs, African Americans, and the young men and women toughened by the streets. The improbable lot of  Paulette's friends brings some comic relief, but, in the end, the rags to riches story via the drug trade and mean streets asks too much of the viewer.",1479168000,,562,5.108695652173913

5614035,5,B00BFCMXRK,"Absolutely delightful movie with a bit of suspense about the ending!  Crabby grandma Paulette is small-minded, racist, and lives in the past, blaming others for her misery.  Along comes an opportunity for Paulette's business mind to use to great advantage. What happens next changes her from an isolated pensioner (Sr Citizen) back to the glory days of running her own business.  Along the way, her attitudes change as well, as she confides to Father Baptiste, her priest.  The humor is very French, dealt with a light hand, not farcical, heavy American humor but light as a Beaujolais just bottled.  There is warm humanity too, in every little corner from Walter to the affection her much-maligned black son-in-law bestows upon her despite her racist attitudes.  The little grandson is adorable and brings his grandma around to loving him like she should.  In the end, Paulette remains true to her friends and her family, a rock for all.  Delightful movie!  I thoroughly enjoyed it, like a young refreshing wine!",1475452800,,1013,5.017964071856287

It had to suck right?. After watching and reading (OMG) the first few minutes of the movie, I was hooked. This was one of the most enjoyable movies I've seen in many years. Bernadette Lafont (Paulette), whom I had never heard of before yesterday, playing the angry, racist, impoverished, little old lady forced to dumpster dive for her meals, would/should be an Oscar nominee.

5614500,3,B00BFCMXRK,"Elderly lady in France has a rough time since her husband died and her restaurant failed. She has some of things repossessed. She had some of her utilities cut off. She is going through dumpsters. And she lets everyone around her know how she feels about having to live like this. She is boldly, unapologetically blunt about everything to everyone from her mixed raced grandchild, to her black son-in-law, to her the Muslims that have taken over her neighborhood. But one day after the government shows up to take her stuff she decides to sell dope and she approaches that endeavor like everything else does. But that is at first. . . .

I couldn't tell whether this is some supportive propaganda of the luancy we hear today that drugs are a community issue and not a punishable crime. The way the movie was moving along I felt like that is what was being portrayed here. The idea of ""we do it to make a living and you are now doing the same, 'hypocrite'"". But the ending clearly shows that Paulette knows what she is doing is wrong--that she has made a mistake and is self-correcting as she got her confidence back. So I then began to wonder isn't that what the President of the US has been pushing with his clemency for druggies? In the end, I couldn't tell if this was a pro drug or anti drug movie.

Anyway I appreciate the attempt at reclaiming freedom of speech albeit it through some mean spirited name calling. This movie wouldn't dare be made in America as we have no freedom of speech. It is just a trite expression we throw around these days when we refer to our antiquated wall paper called the US Constitution. We have too many people telling us what we can and cannot say that this film seems revolutionary to me. It shows how the poor struggle. And how France is not a lot of purse toting men and model thin women sipping lattes and visiting museums. It shows the disaster that socialism has spread to the ignorantly accepting French. And it shows the all too known fact around the Catholic church--its many faceted/level hypocrisy that led to its celebrated demise.

If you can wait to the end you may be able to shake off the depressing parts of this movie and find a glimmer of hope in a newly confident Paulette.",1465171200,2,2231,4.476658476658477

5614694,3,B00BFCMXRK,"I had no expectations, so I was pleasantly surprised by the gusto with which Bernadette Lafont played the role of the embittered bigot, Paulette, in old age done out of her restaurant by a hard working immigrant. But, as noted in one of my favorite lines in the movie, 'the Lord works in mysterious ways His wonders to perform.' Paulette is redeemed and reformed by her adventures far outside the law. An irony of her situation stands out in a very early scene. A devout Catholic, Paulette must offer her confession to an African priest. The priest is appalled by her hateful speech, but he grants her absolution through a routine penance.",1464566400,2,639,4.714285714285714

This grandma ends up being creative in dealing drugs  for lack of income to make ends meet but draws the line on the hard core stuff!!

They still know how to use nuance, comedic timing and subtle humor to keep you appreciating this funny weird and wonderful world. A rich tapestry of learning to ""get on"" with those different than us. Paulette had grit! And she never gives up. Brilliant acting.  Absolutely loved the last scene.

5614853,5,B00BFCMXRK,"In the case of this French comedy/drama made shortly before the death of iconic actress Bernadette LaFont in 2013 (but not released until 2015) you can substitute weed or marijuana for the lemons.  Im not giving a spoiler here (I hate them, if youve read my other Amazon reviews) by telling you that the somewhat poor  and introverted  Paulette comes up with a unique method of supplementing her income through  shall I say  baking unique pastries. All this happens at the beginning and watching her deal with syndicate and the drug dealers in Paris in a way they are not accustomed to, is what makes the 87 minute such fun. This is not a heavy message film but it will draw you in.
Give it a chance.

There are moderately easy to read English subtitles and the bonuses include 10 short deleted scenes, which are interesting  though Im not sure they would have added much to the film.
It is rated R.

Another fine release from Cohen Media Group.
I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5614855,5,B00BFCMXRK,"Desperate times call for desperate weights and measures.

Paulette played brightly by Bernadette Lafont decides to use her measurement cooking skills and tools to make some quick money 10 years after he husband Francis died, and she had to surrender their brasserie restaurant because she no longer could afford running it. Hard for money she closed it and lives on a meager pension, 600 Euros per month. Living in a Parisian suburb ghetto apartment, she tries to keep a tight rein on her spending, she picks thrown away fruits and vegetables, out of garbage cans. Yet, she simply doesn't receive enough money with her pension. During a low point, in her life, the repo crew knocks on her door, enter her apartment, and proceed to remove the sofa, the TV, and her telephone.

Then she gets an idea of trafficking drugs when she hides behind trash cans during a drug raid in her apartment building, and a local dealer gets rid of a package of hash that lands in her lap. The little old lady hooks up with Vito, the neighborhood drug lord, and works out a deal in which she sells her find.

Eventually Paulette hooks up with her senior citizen friends to run a bakery filled with hash. From broke to a rich lady, Paulette has found the light at the end of the tunnel by selling hash mixed in with her pastries. She worked as a pastry chef at her brasserie, and now is happy she could reuse her skills.

Yet, she's not always a happy person. She undergoes racist feelings because her daughter married a black man, and they had a biracial son, who she considers black. Even though she has a tough time accepting the youth and her black son in law, Paulette handles her disappointments in one way to another.

Even though this movie has heavy subjects like racism, drug dealers, and poverty, it still is funny. Hilariously funny. Sounds absurd to see senior citizens wear sunglasses when dealing with drugs and handling drug dealers, yet director Jerome Enrico pulls it off. He manages to keep this movie hilarious and light-hearted in the mist of social time bomb topics.

In the end, this movie is clearly a comedy. With undertones of social issues. The director Enrico handles the balance of sensitive social topics, like senior citizen poverty, with a strong sense of humor. To the point, of this movie being absurd like ones by the great Irish playwright Samuel Beckett.

The entire movie, released in 2012, is in French. But French that's easy to understand. Plus the subtitles are clear, and explain the movie dialogue to a tee;

Paulette is another example of the French movie industry trying to gain a global audience. This movie is very American, very British, and very French. It's a movie with global sensibilities. And hilarious to boot.",1454630400,23,2745,4.7160751565762
