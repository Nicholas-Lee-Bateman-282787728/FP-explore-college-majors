7957318,4,B00005YUPG,"As others have pointed out, REAL GIRLS UNCOVERED: GIRLS OF WOODSTOCK consists of dozens of girls about ages 18 - 25 getting body painted for the Woodstock 1999 festival. I love both body painting and exhibitionism, so I've watched this about 8 to 10 times since getting it a couple of weeks ago! Most of it consists of the girls getting painted under a tent near the concert, and most are topless though some are totally naked. I'm surprised how good-looking on average the girls are, although it's true that they're more real-world looking and not mostly like models. However, several of them are super looking. I'm also surprised how many of them are stacked! The reviewer who called this a ""Boob Lovers Paradise"" was right on the mark. I sure wish I had been there!

The camerawork is quite decent, though sometimes it's a little shaky or wanders. My only complaint is the the DVD has not been made into a finished documentary since there's no one telling on film what is going on, and most of the girls are shown only in early stages of body painting, so only a few are shown out in the concert area which is presumably where they were all headed, and those are mostly not body painted. What happened to the footage that was made of all the girls fully body painted? I'm glad, though, that the audio portion is live sounds rather than added music. Run time is 48 minutes with no extras. Still, despite the incomplete feeling of it, it's well worth having if you like this sort of thing. I haven't found a lot of body painting DVDs, but one I've enjoyed a little more than this one since it shows the finished product more often is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Playboy-Mansion-Parties-Hottest-Moments-Body-Painting/dp/B00006JU7Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Playboy - Mansion Parties, Hottest Moments & Body Painting</a>.",1357344000,,1868,5.0453074433656955
7957319,2,B00005YUPG,This video shows naked women having bikinis spray painted on them at woodstock 1999. The huge majority of women in this video are way below average looking. Lots of chubby/skanky women with nasty body piercings & tatoos also. The funny thing about this dvd is there are a couple hotties but they only show them for a few seconds. For example there is a really hot babe at the 32:12 time mark that for some reason they only show for a few seconds and the view isn't the best. If they had spent more time with her this actually could have been a great video. But unfortunately this doesn't happen. I would say there were probably 20 women or so shown.,1094688000,11,649,4.371900826446281
7957320,5,B00005YUPG,"Although most of these beautiful girls can be seen at [...] this video is more than worth the price.  These girls are awesome-- getting naked for the cameras, crowds, and getting painted up in all sorts of ways.  Nothing but wall-to-wall naked women for the full hour.  Some girls even have strip-offs to try and raise money to get their bodies painted, so they can walk around naked through the festival.  What a sweet setup this is: start a booth which charges beautiful girls money to get naked... then video tape it and sell it to perverts like me.  It is like getting paid 3 times!  I swear I went into the wrong industry.  If you love naked real women, public nudity, exhibitionism, concert flashing, then this video is for you!!",1074211200,8,735,4.564885496183206
