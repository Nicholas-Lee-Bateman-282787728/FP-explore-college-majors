As for ONE-EYED JACKS, I have made an effort to find the best copy of this movie. The Laserdic is best so far.

Marlon Brando delivers as an actor and a brilliant director in this very contemplative film. ONE-EYED JACKS is quite unique and very impressive under Brando's direction. He demonstrates several innovative camera movements that move the story quite fluidly along. I like this film. It is visually very atmospheric and moody. Cinematographer Charles Lang's images are extremely evocative of mankind's inner restlessness against good and evil set against a beautiful but sometimes foreboding environment. Composer Hugo Friedhofer's score is brilliantly moving and contemplative. It does not play out like a traditional Western or tale of revenge. The final confrontation is anti-climatic but what leads up to the film's conclusion is mesmerizing. The images and some of the obscure dialogue are very memorable and haunting. The outstanding cast includes Karl Malden, Ben Johnson, Katy Jurado, Pina Pellicer, Slim Pickens, Elisha Cook Jr. and Rodolfo Acosta. It is definitely a good film and worth repeated viewing.",1140912000,,1235,5.232323232323233
