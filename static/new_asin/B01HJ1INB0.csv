7787712,4,B01HJ1INB0,"I've been waiting for a tenor that could bring this role off and hoped it would be Kaufmann but he hasn't brought the role into his rep as yet - still hoping.  But until he does, Aleksandrs Antonenko has the role and is a worthy successor to Placido Domingo whose Met performance with Renee was the best on stage and DVD.  I found all the principals excellent, costumes very good and production OK as well.  I really have a problem with some of the lighting which seems to follow the Met's darkened stage which doesn't work for cameras but I forgive as the voices and acting were more than credible.  I can highly recommend this disc as a valuable addition to an opera collection.",1406332800,3,680,4.459677419354839
7787713,4,B01HJ1INB0,"Excellent performances and recording. Nonetheless, the staging leaves a lot to be desired as it is simple (not really minimalist)and practical. The opening scene, with an impressive and powerful view of the sea storm , is all of a sudden reduced to a small screen thereby losing its initial appeal. High marks for Marina Poplavskaya!",1352332800,2,333,5.072727272727272
7787714,5,B01HJ1INB0,"This is a very exciting performance of Otello and is exactly what you would expect with Muti as the conductor. Otello is high-voltage Verdi and all the cast plus orchestra fully realise this vision. Not only is the singing of consistently high standard - so is the acting, so essential with opera generally and especially in these days of revealing photography.

The cast is of a uniformly high calibre. Aleksandra Antonenko is a good acting singer and in this performance he does not disappoint. Carlos Alverez makes a suitably devious counterpart as Jago (Iago) and Marina Poplavskaya is a credible Desdemona. The supporting roles are all strong and the overall performance carries considerable conviction.

The staging is minimalist and this will either succeed in concentrating the mind on the drama or not. This will be a very personal reaction and is therefore beyond the brief of this review. For me personally, it worked, largely as a result of the excellence of the singers in carrying out the dramatic requirements of their roles in addition to the purely vocal considerations.

The orchestra is given full reign and this led some newspaper reviewers attending the original performances at the Festival to comment about the balance which gave the orchestra such prominence relative to the singers. It is this aspect of balance that has drawn the most adverse reviewer comment. However, as a now retired orchestral player, I would like to stress that I find the sound to be superb and faithfully representative of the expected 'live' balances. It accurately reflects the sound world that I would expect from late Verdi which gives the orchestra far more prominence than that found in his early or middle period works.

Bearing in mind the range of critical responses to the recorded sound I sought the reaction of a 'hi-fi' enthusiast friend of mine. We listened to the opera carefully with the sound balances specifically in mind after which we discussed this very matter. We agreed that we would both expect the singers to be submerged occasionally considering the dramatic role given to the orchestral writing. To that extent the recording is completely faithful to both the composer and the performance. This is not a gentle story and needs to be played for the raw drama that it is. Otherwise the imaging can be described as sharp in typical HD fashion and the sound is presented in superbly realistic PCM 5.0 as well as stereo bearing in mind the provisos as above.

I would suggest that this is a very fine, perceptive and dramatic performance of a violent story. The recording does it full justice as does Muti who is temperamentally ideally suited to such an opera. This is a disc that deserves serious consideration as a potential purchase therefore.",1342569600,6,2769,4.959051724137931
7787715,5,B01HJ1INB0,"During the last 20 years of Verdi's life, Arrigo Boito, poet and composer himself, was to become a close friend. Their working relationship is one of the most remarkable in the History of opera. Boito was the Librettist in 1880 who helped Verdi revise Simon Boccanegra. Then came the two Shakespearian operas Otello and Falstaff, reckoned to be the twin glories of Italian opera.

This live performance of Otello was part of the 2008 Salzburg Festival.  Riccardo Muti,is at his vigorous best,conducting the Vienna Philharmoniker. Partly traditional and modern staging. A screen against the wall shows the sea and various activities. The small square stage set in the center of the Huge stage,  is used for some of the action. Surrounded by what looks like castle battlements. It is minamalist in its approach. The Costumes are of the period in  which Otello is set. Aleksandrs Antonenko, a young dramatic tenor is fine, but no Domingo as yet, but that will come in the future. Desdemona is Marina Poplavskaya is a star in the making. I have the Don Carlo conducted by Pappano,conducting the Royal opera House orchestra. Marina is Elizabeth of Valois. That is why I obtained this Otello. The Traditionalist will love the staging of that opera. Jago is Carlos Alvarez being subtly evil. The rest of the cast are good. It is a blessing to have Otello and Desdemonia looking so youthful as the composer would have wanted.

Rest assured with this opera, the traditional stage merchants will not have a nervous breakdown if they watch this production. No gnashing of teeth and tearing of sack cloth, or mention of Euro trash. What ever that means. Something negative I suspect. I am fortunate that I like both kinds of staging, so I do not rant and rave when modern staging is even mentioned. Though when reading their comments it amuses me no end. More please. I suppose I am the way I am,because I am a opera fan, but like World music, rock, blues ,Jazz,new wave. Music is music, as long as it enlightens our spirit. Being an ex Sports Administrator, and ultra distance runner, running in events over 161 kms, now a senior  distance racing cyclist, I have dealt with some tough customers in my time. Many of this lot writing reviews on Amazon Opera section appear ivory tower Merchants, compared to the straight talking sports people I have dealt with.",1309996800,7,2348,4.7995049504950495
7787716,4,B01HJ1INB0,"In my view this is an exceptional performance of Otello, one that ranks with the best of those currently available on video disc.  In addition to Riccardo Muti's masterful leadership in the pit and the quality of playing from the members of the Vienna Philharmonic, there is wonderful singing by the three principles: Aleksandrs Antonenko (Otello), Marina Poplavskaya (Desdemona), and Carlos Alvarez (Iago).  All three of these stars have beautiful voices which they use intelligently and with appropriate dramatic effect for this production.

Marina Poplavskaya easily takes her place with those lyric sopranos able to float beautiful pianissimos.  However, the ease with which both Antonenko and Alvarez comfortably handle piano and pianissimo passages is both an unexpected bonus and quite beautiful to hear.  Oh, they can certainly produce thrilling, ringing high notes when appropriate (check out the ""Si pel Ciel"" duet between Otello and Iago!), but when the score markings call for softer singing we are treated to something truly special.

For example, in Iago's Second Act aria, ""Era la notte,"" Alvarez's pianissimo delivery evokes a degree of menace that's quite chilling.  And the duet between Otello and Desdemona that brings Act One to a close is gorgeously sung and ends, not on competing forte high notes, but on softly sung high notes that allow their voices to blend with the believable tenderness of young love.

One hopes that Mr. Antonenko will be careful in his choice of roles as he builds his future repertoire so that he can preserve not only his heroic, ringing tenor voice, but also his ability to sing such lovely pianissimo notes when the music and the story-line call for it.

Secondary roles are all capably handled, with especially impressive singing by Stephen Costello (Cassio), Barbara Di Castri (Emilia), and Mikhail Petrenko (Lodovico).

The costuming in this production is nicely done in styles that are consistent with the time-setting of the story.  As to the staging, those who admire the beauty and time-period-appropriate designs of, say, Franco Zeffirelli, will be disappointed.  However this production's staging, though somewhat sparse, is not jarring and it does feature some interesting symbolic effects.

Most Blu-ray discs these days feature picture and sound quality that is a joy to the viewer/listener and this one does not disappoint.  In addition, the disc's bonus extra, ""Talking Otello,"" features especially interesting and insightful interviews with the stage director, Stephen Langridge, and with all of the principle singers and with several of those in secondary roles.

One minor criticism is Antonenko's acting which is a bit unimaginative, consisting mostly of striding aggressively around the stage and scowling or sneering.  However, one has the impression that this young man will quickly move up the learning curve of his profession and that his acting will improve dramatically (pun not intended) in future performances of this opera.

A more serious criticism, and the reason for four stars instead of five, is the excessive use of extreme close-ups of the lead singers.  (One can literally count the sweat drops on the faces of some of the singers, especially Antonenko's.)  This technique, which inexplicably has become de rigueur with today's opera video directors, is more off-putting than it is entertaining.  It robs viewers of the perspective and scope of a given scene as viewed by the opera theater's live audience.  But even worse, it can completely destroy the mood of a given scene---a prime example is the end of the Act One love duet when Otello and Desdemona embrace and kiss prior to adjourning to their bedroom.  Instead of being swept up by the music and the romantic mood of the moment, viewers are inclined to wonder what Ms. Poplavskaya was thinking as Mr. Antonenko planted a drippingly-wet kiss full on her lips!

On balance, however, a superb opera experience.",1276473600,26,3953,5.229793977812995
8765546,4,B01HJ1INB0,"....shouldn't.
  This is a superior musical performance sabotaged by poor production.  Antonenko has the power and acting ability for the role.  Yoncheva sings and acts to great effect and the baritone, Lucic is perfection itself.  Nezet-Seguin conducts a powerful performance.
  Everything is wide open and can be seen or spied by all the performers.  Even during the great monologue, ""Dio mi potevi"", a very private moment, Desdemona is seen watching a bit...luckily she moves away quickly.
  The action seems to have been moved up to the 19th century; the pretty gowns worn by the women are merely a distraction.
  Why isn't Otello in blackface?  Kaufmann, in his DVD also is clearly white.  Verdi referred to the  as his ""chocolate project"".  There's no drama without this distinction.  Othello in Shakespeare is black, a prince among his people.
  Tebaldi and DelMonaco were the great team in this opera at the Met.  Tebaldi chose it as her final performance.  Her acting was sincere and her singing perfect, with all the high notes and diminuendos in place.
  Another great Met Otello on DVD stars Jon Vickers and Renata Scotto.  There's no greater opera than this and Verdi profited from the wonderful libretto of Arrigo Boito.",1537747200,,1234,5.024875621890548
8765547,4,B01HJ1INB0,"I got this to augment my other Otello blu ray with the same Otello and Muti conducting. The production sound and video are heart-stopping-ly gorgeous, truly stunning. The singing is inferior in every respect, the Otello's voice is significantly degraded for example. Yoncheva's costume is very sexy compared to Poplavskaya her singing is slightly less pure though.",1512518400,,364,5.4035087719298245

8765549,5,B01HJ1INB0,"This is a very, very good production of Verdi's Otello -- an operatic retelling of Shakespeare's classic play. We watched this and enjoyed it very much. If you like opera, and like Verdi, then this is a no-brainer in my opinion at $15-$20. The video is very clear and the audio is excellent. The singers are superb -- especially Yoncheva and Antonenko. His voice is so incredibly powerful -- it's huge! And Yoncheva's voice is glorious -- with great control even when singing very high up and pianissimo -- and a lovely vibrato. I felt great emotion in their singing. She is beautiful and was very convincing as Desdemona. Antonenko does a good job too and does look positively scary at the end.

Watching this for the first time, and immediately after watching the new Met version of Wagner's Ring, we were initially a little underwhelmed by the first half (acts 1 and 2). I felt it really picked up towards the end of act 2. Then acts 3 and 4 are really superb -- the pace quickens a bit and the drama increases, with more interesting singing passages. That is just my opinion as a first-time watcher. By the end, I thought it was really great.

Eric Owens (who I love) does some nice interviews mid-production, which are good, but they are short and there aren't many extras sadly.",1484611200,7,1284,4.578260869565217
8765550,4,B01HJ1INB0,The singing parts are very good as expected from Sonya Yoncheva and Zeljiko Lucic but the acting and character of Otello is not as impressive in comparison to Franco Zeffirelli's production with Placido Domingo in the title role.,1483228800,4,229,5.052631578947368
8765551,5,B01HJ1INB0,"This recording of the 2015 production by the Metropolitan Opera of Verdi's take on Shakespeare's Othello, is worth the watching and the addition to the collection.
Shakespeare's multi-subjected play of a warrior brought down by jealously, is in part the Bard's look at undeserved European racism.
This being opera, where the old play teenagers, productions have traditionally had the lead roll masked in blackface. (While having African American singers in all kinds of characters these days without disconnect by the audience) The Met abandoned this convention for this production much to its credit and without any issue - particularly since it serves little purpose in Verdi's take on the story.
The production is both abstract and particular. The singers superb.",1480982400,8,766,5.391666666666667
8765552,4,B01HJ1INB0,"I do not wish to write a review about this release. I would only like to point out that the voices on all MET video releases, broadcasts and HD transmissions are compressed. The result (and the goal) is that all singers sound equally loud. They usually don't use body mics, so it solves them the problem of singers voices' dropouts when a singer is off the axis of the super-cardioid stage mics on the MET huge stage. It also saves singers with a small voice an embarrassment. The result flattens the real dynamics of the voices of the live, inhouse performance, and singers with bigger voices, like Antonenko lose the ping of their projection. Listen to the long quiet passages in the last act where there is no music - they are far from quiet, the noise floor is very loud, you can clearly hear the sound 4,000 people make - AND THIS ONLY FROM THE STAGE MICS (because the pit tracks are not compressed)!. This can only happen with dynamic compression, which increases the noise floor - if you place a Schoeps microphone of the kind they use, even an omni-directional one, in the house, even if you place it in the audience, rather than on the stage and pit as they do, you will NOT get this level of noise floor as long as the rest of the gear chain is top-notch.

They could have used compression without increasing the noise floor by NOT choosing the lowest starting point for the compression as minus infinity. They could have chosen about 3-5 dB ABOVE the noise floor, but this could have resulted in ""pumping"" - any sound that falls around the starting point for compression to kick in would be intermittently amplified and not amplified as it dances around the chosen point for starting the compression. There is a way around that in post-production, but not in a live transmission, and it seems they used the audio from the live transmission straight off the mixing-board - lazy bazzturds. Also, they did not have to chose such an aggressive (high) ratio of compression - a ratio of 1.1/1 soft-knee compression would have been enough IMHO, but they used in my estimation at least 2/1, because they wanted to completely flatten the voices.

Update 4/8/17: where I'm wrong here is that they use analogue limiters for the stage, not digital compression. The result is still extreme dynamic compression of the stage tracks.",1480982400,11,2328,4.661800486618005

8765554,4,B01HJ1INB0,"This Otello originates from the Salzburg Festival, and it is apparent in many ways. The singers seem to be chosen so that their voices can fill the Grosses Festspielhaus. This is not always comfortable when it comes to listening at home. Aleksandrs Antonenko (Otello) and Marina Poplavskaya (Desdemona) have big voices, but I've seen much better acting. The sets are dull, but the costumes are fine. Superlative playing from the Wiener Philharmoniker under Riccardo Muti. The sound is terrific.
