8756703,5,B01DRD02JA,"ISLANDS IN THE STREAM, based on the Hemmingway novel, is my favorite film. Why is it my favorite film of all films I have ever seen? There is just something about this character that I like. I liked this film the moment I first saw it when it was released in 1977. George C. Scott is Thomas Hudson. He is an American and is a artist who has left the mainland and lives on an island in the Caribbean circa early 1940. He has several friends that come an go in and out of his isolated world, a world surrounded by the enigmatic veneer he has constructed around himself through his lifetime. His friends include Eddy played by David Hemmings, Joseph played by Julius Harris, Captain Ralph played by Gilbert Roland, Willy played by Richard Evans and Lil played by Susan Tyrrell. George C. Scott's Thomas Hudson seems as though he is somehow playing Hemingway. He is as much a worldly man and down to earth as he is intensely introverted, remaining ever enigmatic. He is a man with passions, yet his passions seems to make him such a distant figure and still a man everyone admires and tries to inch just a bit closer to be a part of his worldliness. His friends seem to know him better than he knows himself. I suppose that is why I like this film.",1507680000,,1244,4.366379310344827
