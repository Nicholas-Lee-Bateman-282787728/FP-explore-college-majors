2425697,5,B000BMY2NS,"I must admit that my first reaction to this film was not immediately positive; Herzog's presence seemed overbearing and intrusive, and Treadwell himself was a figure so tragic as to be somewhat alienating. And yet I found that, days later, I found I was still thinking about it, still mesmerized by the questions it raised. How truly unsympathetic was Treadwell? Should I be somewhat jealous of him, for all the joy and depth of experience he found in his work? I have, as few have, found little in life so enriching and gratifying as what Treadwell appeared to find in the wilderness; are thirteen summers of that worth an early, terrible end?

So I saw the film again; I recommend that others do the same, if they find themselves at all intrigued after the first viewing. And then I saw the film again, and again. What I found with time -- as I let it develop into an obsession -- was an incredibly complex artwork, capable of provoking rich and sometimes startling meanings.

At its core, I now understand Grizzly Man to be a document of the desperate search for kinship in an alienating world; an insight into what happens when, failing to find an object which fulfills our desires, we resort to projecting our desires onto whatever might hold them. For as Treadwell imagines the bears to be his companions, so too does Herzog attempt to imagine Treadwell as a filmmaker of his own lineage, a comrade in the struggle to capture beauty in a wild and unforgiving universe. Intentionally or not, Herzog's intrusion into this documentary comes to parallel Treadwell's own intrusion into the bears' wild habitat; and we come to realize that the strange and austere beauty he finds in Treadwell's footage is more Herzog's invention than it is a product of the man who captured the images.

One reviewer has noted the failure of this film to acknowledge the ""culture of artifice"" which drove its participants to such extremes. I would argue, however, that both this phenomenon and the underlying anomie are central to the film; and that acknowledging them would only serve to undermine their tension and delegitimize them as themes, for to do so would require Herzog to depersonalize them, to suppose that he was somehow outside of or above their influence, and in doing so allow the audience to treat them as foreign objects as well. Instead, we come to recognize them empathically, and are left on our own to decide their personal meaning.

In short, this film manages to span the full spectrum between fascination with the other and deepest introspection. And that versatility is a rare quality, truly deserving of five perfect stars.",1133740800,53,2634,4.820796460176991
2425698,3,B000BMY2NS,"Werner must have been smacking his lips when the 100 plus hours of Treadwell bear footage was made available to him to shape this exegis on a man gone lose in Alaska in more ways than one. The material is everything Herzog himself would have liked to have shot, and here it was served on a platter, requiring only his own disingenuous narration, to frame it. So, the work appeals to the voyeur in us without coming to grips with the psyche that determines why one person unhinges into self-serving freekdom, while another buttons up on the porch, patriotically holding the Stars & Stripes. The inevitability of the plot, the pathetic railing of Treadwell's deranged attack on the National Parks etc. can mask Herzog's own agenda. The most insidious aspect being his pretense at objectivity, headphones on, suggesting to the keeper of the final 6 recorded minutes of Treadwell's life, that it should be destroyed as it would serve as a 'white elephant'(did I get my mammals right?)for the rest of her days. This is from a guy who allowed dwarves centre stage in, 'Even Dwarves Start Small'! There's something derisive in this guy, and little has been said about it. Admittedly, Herzog has created some majestic footage; the opening passages of 'Kasper', of 'Aguirre', and I recall some aerial footage over burning oil wells in the Middle East. And his agency here has permitted what is arguably the best part of Treadwell's footage to surface. Let's just say that the disurbing element in, 'Grizzly' isn't entirley of Treadwell's making. Footnote;Richard Thompson's pluckings to accompany Treadwell's path through artic grasses are exquisite!",1133654400,,1641,5.036764705882353
2425699,1,B000BMY2NS,"Timothy Treadwell used a video camera and a grizzly bear preserve to create a land of make believe where he starred as self-anointed protector of beasts and nature show host extraordinaire.  Beneath Treadwell's  naturalist  guise and self-delusion, ""Grizzly Man""  offers a disturbing look at one person's total disconnect from reality, which is the film's buried core.  This  failed actor, former substance abuser and reality drop-out was a product of the alienation and rage induced by repressed homosexuality and narcissistic personality disorder.  There was no agenda, conservationist or otherwise, outside the imperatives of his own injured psyche.  Treadwell was strictly damaged goods.

Treadwell's footage, which shows the bears up-close, Treadwell talking to animals, and Treadwell's tirades against park rangers and others, is meant to convey his special oneness with nature and the import of his mission.  He creates an impression of connectedness with the bears through their physical proximity on camera.  The animals, in reality, are incidental to Treadwell's story, functioning as dramatic props in a self-promotional theater of the absurd.  After 13 summers of ""observation"", this ""self-styled"" ""naturalist"" and ""educator"" demonstrates a less than zero understanding of the bears who he habituates to the potentially deadly human predator and sentimentally characterizes as Disney-like creatures.  The deeply sad irony of the film is not that Treadwell was killed by the bears he ""loved, loved, loved"" but that even here animals are objects of human exploitation, used solely for personal gain.

Treadwell's misconstructions are defects common to narcissists and other anti-social personality types who lack self-awareness and the ability to understand others or display genuine affect, as they themselves are devoid of many of the human feelings and expressive abilities that make such understanding possible.  Hallmark inspired sentiment, not surprisingly, is where they resort to for verse,  when not raging.

Herzog doesn't uncover the real story here which is the critical state of personal and social anomie in American culture,  opting instead to consecrate Treadwell's Nature Man shtick by adding his own manipulative and overblown narrative.  We need Herzog to tell us how special, meaningful and poignant this, now his, story is.  And he does so with faux gravitas, adding a new layer of melodrama to the other simulations that make up this film.

Herzog, now part of the story, appears on camera with headphones so the audience can watch him re(act) as he listens - unbelievably for the first time - to a tape of the killings.  Viewers, not privy to the sound,  must imagine the incident taking cues from Herzog, and are thus made accessories to the production.  After some dutiful head-shaking, pater Herzog admonishes Treadwell's ex-girlfriend not to listen to the tape, in fact to destroy it, presumably because it is just too shocking (in this culture?).  But wasn't she the one who gave the tape to Herzog?  She appears confused but amenable because this obliging female is along for the ride, in much the way that Treadwell's companion Amie Huguenard seemed to be.

Herzog's cinematic spirit is infectious.  The coroner's classic camp performance in the dead man's watch bestowal scene further consolidates Herzog's new documentary style.  In fact the stagings, rehearsals, director cameos, ham acting and amateur nature footage prove so compelling that everyone climbs on board, including most movie reviewers.  Their awe inspired commentaries are dismal reflections on the state of our society, indeed.

The bears, for their part, go about their business, occasionally inspecting Treadwell, one more object in their domain.  They offer little resistance to his worldview until the day that one bear, food supply low,  kills him and his female companion, the only part of this story that seems real.",1132185600,49,3932,5.435643564356436
2425700,5,B000BMY2NS,But well worth watching.  It doesn't exactly paint a pretty picture of liberal PETA types like myself.  This guy is crazy.  Out of touch with the real world. Probably a gay man in denial(you'll see what I mean when you watch this).  Definitely in denial about the danger of hanging out with grizzly bears. There is a haunting segment of him on David Letterman.  Letterman asks if one day we'll read about him being eaten which he laughs off.  But of course he does end up as an early dinner one evening.  It is a shame what has become of the grizzly bears in the continenal United States.  Losing their majestic habitats for shopping malls and ski resorts.  I'm not sure this film supports the cause to repopulate them but it is a fascinating film that shows a man on fire without taking a stance one way of the other.,1131753600,,818,4.4
2425721,5,B000BMY2NS,"I began watching this film, assuming it would be another tragic tale of a nut heading off in the wilderness to get close to nature. Anyone watching the film will have an opinion as to whether Timothy should have been out there or not, whether he invaded the bear territory, encroached, etc. This isn't the first time someone has gone to live and study nature. I think the film footage provides insight into nature and Timothy Treadwell. If you can set aside judgment and just watch, it's amazing that he was able to spend 13 years (he took a break in the winter) filming the bears and other wildlife.  I find it interesting that when someone decides to study gorillas, lions, etc no one thinks anything of it but head to Alaska and it's a different story. While Timothy seemed quite intelligent, he also seemed to struggle with anxiety or some other personal demon that created the occasional frenzied behavior.  Yet, his films let us see the bears and environment through his eyes.",1515196800,,982,4.670520231213873
2425722,5,B000BMY2NS,"I was a little North of Anchorage in August. Just a few mother after he was killed...Seeing this documentary (at least 100 times now) or more so just the scenery of AK in the background definitely takes me back. Very nostalgic. We actually met a couple who knew him while in anchorage. Locals all kind of thought he was nuts. In one scene a bush pilot says, ""The bears must've thought he was mentally retarded.."" Not cool. Howeverrrr, you can tell towards the end there that he had his demons, as we all do. He found his sanctuary with bears/away from people. He said himself that's how he would want to go. Tim seemed to be a very kind, loving, human being (favorite scene is when he thinks the bee is dead, and BAM it's not ) His reaction is priceless. So much passion. Damn did he love those bears...and for 13 years. I can't stress that enough. If he had left when he was supposed to I believe he MAY still be around. Others say it was a matter of time-eh. I bet he'd be stoked about this movie....I can't help but to watch this over and over. Hope this helps! Watch it, draw your own opinion! I love reading other peoples views on this as well.

2425730,4,B000BMY2NS,"A wonderful film,both heartbreaking and infuriating. Timothy Treadwell's footage of the Alaskan wilderness is breathtaking---and even more memorable than the grizzlies are the shots of Treadwell and the red fox he befriended: in particular, one gorgeous and heartrending clip of this fleet creature scampering across a blue green meadow toward the photographer, Sadly, many view Treadwell and nature itself as an either/or proposition: Treadwell as either a saint or feather headed, pathetic fool. Herzog himself argues that nature is a chaotic and horrible place and the bears simply bored and cruel---he had voiced a similar sentiment about the Amazonian rain forest in his 1982 film Fitzcarraldo: the jungle as a place where even the birds screech with pain. Given that ""burden of dreams,"" this is unsurprising.

Yet this is a false dichotomy. Nature is certainly merciless and ""red in tooth and claw"", but at the same time full of grandeur and sweeping beauty, which is why Treadwell, like Chris McCandless, another unfortunate Alaskan sojourner, sought solace in it. Treadwell was certainly wrongheaded, egotistical and muddled in his quest, and his omission of his girlfriend, Amie Huegenard, from all the footage, is highly questionable. It is no doubt the death of Huegenard, who feared the bears, that led the callous oaf Grizzly Man to proclaim that Treadwell ""deserved it.""  This is a hideous and utterly appallling thing to say. Huegenard was an adult who sought Treadwell out from the beginning; she knew what he did and she knew what she was getting into, though it greatly frightened her. Neither she nor Treadwell ""deserved"" to be torn to pieces by massive, 1000 lb. predators. And despite Treadwell's foolishness, I do understand his hegira. I salute his barbaric yawp. Treadwell wanted to do what had never been done before---and what is more red-blooded and American than that? The pioneer in the last frontier. He was a damaged soul who couldn't live in the regular 9-5 world, and the end, one who was consumed by the wilderness he so loved. Godspeed, Timothy.",1509667200,,2080,5.150887573964497
2425751,5,B000BMY2NS,"This Film blew me away. I waited years to watch it because I'd heard so many negative things about it but I found it to be very positive. It almost didn't seem real and that can really twist your brain around. This guy walked with bears and foxes. He was killed by a bear but it seems like he would have died from drinking way before that if he had stayed in his previous ""normal"" life. He was a little off but who isn't.

2425754,5,B000BMY2NS,"I thought this was a well done documentary. It is obvious that Timothy Treadwell had some serious psychological issues. I'm amazed he survived as long as he did in Grizzly country. I will say that the Medical Examiner seemed more nuts than Treadwell did, I didn't know what to make of him. I felt really badly that Treadwell pulled his girlfriend into this, resulting in her death, but on the other hand she agreed to go. I'm glad his friend apparently threw out the audio tape of his death as that would just be too horrid to hear, and too much of an invasion of privacy. RIP to Treadwell and his girlfriend.

2425755,5,B000BMY2NS,This story had a horrific ending but up until then it was hilarious. The people being interviewed were so blunt it was ridiculous. I've watched it multiple times and I feel guilty for the hysterical laughter knowing the tragic end.,1504483200,,231,4.8
2425756,5,B000BMY2NS,I just finished watching this documentary and I am truly in awe of the edgy realness and brillance of this cinematic endeavor.  How do you portray a story that no person can completely understand until they have experienced even a slice of what Timothy experienced.  I would venture to propose that maybe Jane Goodall would be the only one that might be able to comment on this life lived.  I see it as such an honest picture of what humans could be without all the masks shoulds and obligations that keep us marching to another's drum.  I would have liked to meet this man.  I had similar reactions to the others who rated this film inside while watching him and it forced me to see inside of myself.  Any piece of work that can do that is brilliant for most of the time we walk around putting that best foot forward as outside perception while the inside withers anyway from lack of attention.  The only reason I see that he died is because the world was so overwhelming he had to go back to the wilds at a time that he knew was not probably safe.  I just see this as a living masterpiece thank you for making it.  It has touched me somewhere very deep inside.,1504051200,,1162,4.317972350230415

2425771,5,B000BMY2NS,"The real truth about why Timothy Treadwell about why he went to Alaska and spent the summers to live with Grizzly bears. Most people believe that timothy Treadwell Really cared about the environment and the Grizzly bears, and wanted to save their habitat which they lived in. Timothy Treadwell said that he was protecting grizzly bears from poachers and hunters, which also was a false statement according to the DNR in Alaska. I do believe it is partially true that he did care grizzly bears and their habitat which they lived in but it was not the main reason.
Timothy Treadwell had a hard time relating to people because he acted real feminine for a heterosexual male. This is why it was hard to finding a girlfriend and to have male friends in his life. I don't believe its his fault, there was a problem with his DNA, and he was born with it thats my belief. I cant prove it but you can tell by the way he acted so feminine in the movie. It is my belief that because Timothy Treadwell had more feminine genes than the average male it made hard for build relationships with men and women, this why he turned to drugs and was depressed and became Bi polar. It is also my believe if Timothy Treadwell would of found a women who loved him for who he was, he would of never went to Alaska. I also believe he would of never would have been involved in drugs .Most of his girl friends with him because he was a celebrity there was one ex girlfriend seemed like a good person but she didn't want to stay with him for whatever reason.
Timothy Treadwell was a failed actor and he used some of his acting skills when he making videos in Alaska. The real reason why he spent 13 summers in Alaska filming Grizzly bears, is that he because he was a outcast in society ( his own quote struggling against civilization itself) as a result he created a world where betrayed himself as hero and courageous. The truth is that he was camping on a national forest so those bears were not endangered of losing their habitat. Those grizzly bears didn't care if he was there or not, and didn't need him to survive. I believe he is partially responsible for his girlfriend death, he shouldnt of taken her out there with him.  On the other hand he didn't kidnap her she knew what she was getting herself into. She had to be in her late 30s or early 40s its not like she was 18yrs old. The way he could survive close encounters with grizzly bears was amazing to me. I believe 95% of the bear biologist would not be able to survive 13 summers with close encounters like he did without weapons or pepper spray. I will give him credit for that. In the end I do believe that Timothy Treadwell was a good person he didn't hurt anybody just himself.",1499817600,,2720,4.343811394891945

2425780,5,B000BMY2NS,"One of the best documentaries I've seen.  Herzog I think does well exploring his idiosyncrasies, possible pathologies (bipolar), personality, sexuality, friends, family, and history.  The movie takes a deep look at one person who seems so different from ""normal.""  Herzog doesn't seem to judge him but does disagree with some of his behaviors and positions.  While I tend to agree with Herzog here, I'm not even sure I agree with his choices to add his opinion.  Full respect for Herzog, but if it were me, I'd probably frame the footage with questions rather than assertions of his opinions.  I don't know.  His opinions are interesting too though, so I like the film either way.  Some of the interviews seemed overly awkward and contrived.  They don't really detract however.  I probably would have included less emphasis on his death, and more emphasis on his life, what he was trying to achieve, his talks with school children, how he was sustaining himself this way, etc.  Too much about his death I think, although I think it should be included too.

Of all the critics, I agree most with the Native American who points out that habituating bears to humans endangers humans and the bears, which undermines Treadwell's stated purpose: protect the bears.  I think Treadwell's behavior is most problematic on this point.  Wanting to do something incredible, be watched, be some type of spectacle seems ok in and of itself... most people have some desire to be honored, achieve great things, be respected, and recognized.  But this is usually accomplished by doing things that benefit others as opposed to say bombing a restaurant full of innocent civilians.  Treadwell's life seems to teeter toward the latter, not that I would compare his life to bombing a building. I wouldn't.  As Herzog points out, his filmmaking is amazing.  I've watched some of Treadwell's shows on Netflix, and they're pretty incredible, not just the clips that Herzog puts in the movie.  In the end, he has a lot of positive traits, and some negative ones too, as does everyone, which is why I appreciate Herzog's concluding remarks.  He's very human.",1491609600,,2130,4.946478873239436

You can see his 'personality'...taking a turn for the worse. He had expectations...the weather, the national parks personnel, the bears themselves ...his unwittingly loyal girlfriend. This resulted in a real disaster. Did Herzog do it justice?.Many would say NO! However....some of Tim's self filmed footage is compelling. Also...some was definitely filmed by his 'companion'...even though he is claiming only to have ever been there 'alone'. Would I recommend it?...yes!  For human weirdness; its hard to beat.

He is truly a man who is fascinated by human oddities, not to gawk or laugh, or pity and deride, but to try and understand Timothy Treadwell with all of his passion and flaws.  Treadwell comes across as a eccentric child-man, obviously traumatized by something in his past, perhaps even on the Asperger's spectrum in his joyous but willful ignoring of the dangers of hanging out with wild grizzlies.  Knowing of his fate beforehand, you cannot turn away from watching his unwitting day to day explorations and video taping, knowing all the while the clock is ticking down to the end of his life.  And the horrible tragedy that his girlfriend had joined him for a short while and they were literally packed and about to leave when they were confronted by a hungry, desperate old 'outsider' bear.

I was right about the documentary part - but this whole DVD is just a tribute to a guy Timothy Dexter - who changed his name to
Timothy Treadwell. I have some mixed thoughts & feelings about Timothy.
In some ways a highly sensitive person. Probably got teased as a kid for being such an open heart.
Also an alcoholic and drug user - who stopped - but apparently without the help of AA (etc)
Some footage shows Timothy ranting and raving - and swearing with awful language.
Clearly in some ways a kind heart - and mentally ill too.
He basically moved to the wilds of Alaska - and 'thought' of himself as a friend to Grizzlys (and other critters)
He wad Delusional in his beliefs that he assumed the Grizzlys were his friends too.
In Oct 2003 he and his girlfriend were ripped to shreds by a grizzly - and partially devoured.
This DVD does not show his death (thank God) - but made me cringe to hear how they went.
They were alive an conscious through much of their being killed.

2425829,5,B000BMY2NS,"On a philosophical level, as a discussion on the ethics of the documentary, on a character level, on a discussion of who Timothy Treadwell really was, this is an excellent 'documentary', where Werner Herzog sometimes inserts himself into the story, editorializes Treadwell's experiences but respects him for what he's done.  There's something compelling in watching the 'takes' and something eery in between those moments of talking and action where the wind sways bough and stem - somewhere in there is an apparent or elusive truth.",1475712000,,533,5.270588235294118

He never settled for a 9 to 5 job, marriage or children.  It's easy to say the main character lived in a fantasy world but chances are you do too.  Either way you get pulled into the story because the characters are fascinatingly real.  I always appreciate the awkwardness that Herzog can capture.  I love when he just keeps the film rolling after you think the shot/scene is done.  Golden moments.

2425887,5,B000BMY2NS,"I watched ""Grizzly Man"" twice and found it to be a well documented and clearly presented documentary. This is Werner Herzog's best work and presented with taste. I felt so sad about Amy and Tim. Tim clearly demonstrated signs of Bipolar Disorder with some secondary diagnosis of addiction (alcohol) in the past as Timothy admitted in the film. I do believe that his journey included a death wish that he often spoke about in passing while he was filming himself. This story brought about so many questions such as ""How did he come to choose his path with the grizzlies"" I know that he connected his resistance to alcohol in place of living in the wild with Grizzlies. What a waste of life. He had friends who loved him, a partner who fought to the death with that grizzly. Tim had many demons to battle but was resistant to confront them through his obsession with the bears. This film is worth watching because it goes deeper than how he died but touched key points about how he lived and how he considered himself in the lowest esteem. I was surprised that he was on a number of talk shows as a guest. I was curious as to how he made a living using the expensive type of equipment that he used and the expensive editing features that he was able to afford. He definitely lived off the grid. I do think that he was largely a danger to himself and others in his decision making but at the same time he was rather courageous to not only film the bears so intimately but that he did show a great closeness with the bears. It would have been wonderful if he did this as his career where he would be paid a salary and could have approached this with professionalism; if he had he would still be alive today. This film is still on my mind and it told a very solid story of this man's obsession with the wild and the comments from close friends and family helped to tell the story in a ""page turner"" pace. I so wish that this did not happen to him and Amy. Even right to the end he continued to foretell his own death.

2426115,4,B000BMY2NS,"Timothy Treadwell's story is a wild journey into nature, but also the mind of a man that saw in bears something that he didn't find in humans - freedom of existence, and a state of ""being."" I think that Werner Herzog did a great job in making you understand Treadwell and his need for independence and his adventurous spirit, while also keeping the documentary grounded in reality - Timothy was a former drug addict living with wild animals that ultimately killed him.

Timothy's communing with bears is viewed as an escape from a society that he didn't feel like he belonged to. Herzog, who narrates the documentary, shows fascinating footage of Treadwell playing with foxes and bears - and he speaks lovingly about them. Any romanticism about Treadwell is balanced by interviews with scientists and the locals of Alaska, who criticize the eccentric Treadwell for crossing the line between man and beast that centuries of man have stood by. We watch as Treadwell, who spent thirteen summers with the bears, becomes unhinged and his sense of self starts to break down. We witness his breakdown on camera where he rants at the National Park Service and a society who has shunned him. He seems to take pleasure in finding a way to live amongst nature and acknowledges the fact that he could be killed at any moment. The fact that he is killed by a bear, validates his beliefs and also the voices of his critics.

There is something infantile about Timothy Treadwell and I think the documentary captures his spirit in wanting to live on his own terms, and prove people wrong by bridging the gap between man and animal. I think that Treadwell did have a death wish and that he was naive, but there is something fascinating about his story and I think Herzog did an excellent job of balancing the crazed Treadwell with the wildness of the bears.",1454284800,3,1840,4.711180124223603

2426236,3,B000BMY2NS,"Tim Treadwell, bear lover, in the documentary film Grizzly Man is the main character whom went about documenting his time spent in the wilderness of Alaska through dramatic videos. Without a doubt he has a passion for grizzly bears of Alaska and in many ways he demonstrates his love, and I mean LOVE, for the majestic giants of the wild. The director, Werner Herzog, uses Treadwells videos and does a good job of narrating the chaos of the one-and-only Tim Treadwell. The film successfully documents Treadwells adventures, but at the same time succeeds in conveying the invisible line between humans and wild grizzly bears that he crossed many times. It is one thing to care about a cause and want to make a difference, but it is another when it completely consumes the advocate. The aspect of the film that is a little puzzling is how the scenes linger on dramatically or unnecessarily. For example, the scene when Treadwell is talking about the forest services neglect and he rants on and on was a bit over the top and awkward to watch. I questioned the scenes like these at first, but now I realize they were all part of Herzogs plan to not only show Treadwells work with bears, but to simply show Tim himself. It was a unique biopic of a man who longed for some screen time. I would recommend this if you enjoy a film when you have no idea what is going to happen next. Also, if you have an interest in grizzly bears obviously it would be an interesting watch because Treadwell gets some pretty awesome shots of the grizzlies.",1449273600,,1531,4.570909090909091

I'm not so sure Treadwell was mentally ill, so much that he was self-aggrandizing and had appointed himself some type of protector for a wild animal he knew very little about. The original version I saw years ago played the audio tape of Treadwell screaming as he was being torn apart. I believe the family sued and they edited it out of the film. That audio, however, I will never forget. Truly horrifying, and testament to his profound error in judgment.

Two poignant statements made by the narrator seem to encapsulate the film: 1) in observing Treadwell's bears, he ""discovers no kinship, no understanding, no mercy; he only sees the overwhelming indifference of nature ... a blank stare that speaks only a half-bored interest in food"". Why do we think we can tame these wild creatures?

2) A disclosure from Treadwell's journal that Amy had a deadline in Spokane for a new job and spoke openly of leaving him for good, saying he was hell-bent for destruction. It's way too bad she realized his destructive delusions too late.

I gave 5 stars because, in listening to his rantings about his fellow human beings, it brings home the truth in John Dunne's words: No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main. ... Any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind ...""

I think it also did a good job in showing that while he was unstable, he did realize he was always in danger among these animals.

2426466,4,B000BMY2NS,"In terms of the measure of a film, this was a very well made one that deserves the accolades it received. I admire Treadwell's basic idealism to a point, but ultimately...it's misguided bridging on fanatical psychosis. Which I suppose is the point of making this movie entirely. I'm not sure there is a message here other than Treadwell had incorrect notions about these bears, himself, and pretty much everything else. Habituating bears, or any wild animal, to the presence of man, will only increase the chances harm will come to the bear, or another person. If there is a moral to the story, it's don't underestimate an animal...especially a territorial one 4-5 times your weight and size, no matter how much you love them, want to be like them, and endeavor to protect them.
I read once some experts estimate a bear's intelligence to be approximately that of a three year old human or a gorilla. Anyone familiar with this age group knows if they is one predictable aspect it can be unpredictability. In other words, smacking daddy in the head with a choo choo doesn't need a ton of motivation or forethought, the berating for doing this prior went right out the window all of a sudden, it's just something to do as much to assert oneself as it might be funny. Now imagine a primal animal rendering of that ""emotional"" state in the form of a huge very strong beast with very large claws and very strong jaws. I'm no expert, but I'd say do not crawl around on all fours trying some overtly feminine sing song voice routine to be closer to it, referring to it as ""my friend"" allowing yourself to gain confidence this approach is sustainable or remotely understood by the bears. Just a thought...trying to humanize these animals with cute names and personalities endangers oeself and ultimately the bear. ""Grizzly Man"" does a lot of talking, very little to none based in scientific method, more an immature infatuation rant about bears. In the process he appears much more obsessed with himself and his self proclaimed eco-warrior message than a broader awareness about the majestic power of these animals, the natural and human elements that truly effect them, or their fascinating behavior in general.
If we garner any insight, it's how foolish the hubris of one individual, taking risks for attention, or simply being blinded by ones own ambitions can be. His verbal attacks on park rangers were unjustified, the threat to the bears is delusional. No matter how accustomed to the scent of this human, his antics, or if he cries over one of their cubs, they will act out in sudden unpredictable ways. They can possibly tolerate or ignore you on a Wednesday while swiping and eating fish. If they don't like your movements on a Thursday, perceive you as a threat or a food source...you can be in the biggest trouble....no matter how many years you have been camping out in their territory promoting yourself and incorrect notions of them. This happens in a flash and the bear responsible was shot for acting naturally and instinctively like a bear.

Because the movie was put together so extraordinarily well, I feel as though I was there with him when he died.  His death isn't on film, video or audio, but the recounting of it was chilling to say the least.  There is also that godawful insatiable curiosity that made me go find it myself via google.  It saddens me that this is how he died, and that it was obviously not quick or merciful.  That his girlfriend also died while ""leaving him for good"" earlier in the week, is the super sadness frosting on this cake.  I wish I could ask him, if he knew then what would happen, would he still be so anti-gun, so against killing a bear if it attacked him despite being in their territory.

Timothy Treadwell was delusional, immature, intensely annoying, and completely full of baloney. My guess is that he was actually clinically ill, and it is astonishing that he lived as long as he did. I frankly found his claims arrogant in the face of what others are actually doing, but that is what can happen with pathological disorders.

Herzog has done an excellent job with a complex, unnecessary and tragic situation, and he kept his compassion... far more than I was able to. I had read the book first, so was pleased to be able to put a real face to Timothy.

""  It seems that the description is an oxymoron.  Anyone who spends 13 summers among them certainly has credentials and is not an amateur.

Treadwell was filming a documentary, or a series of documentaries, with excellent photography and narration that allowed the production of this documentary.  Treadwell's progression, his mental state, his anti-social behavior, his roots, et al, are woven into a cinematic tapestry.

Werner Herzog was just right in this, both as director and narrator.

The coroner offers a performance that could not have been scripted any better if he were a fictitious character, which he was not.

Bear behavior during the drought could have provided a clue to bear behavior just before hibernation.

I found this to be captivating.

Confusing isn't it?  I gave it the 5 Star because everyone who worships the creation in place of the Creator comes to a tragic end of their self reasoned deceptions  By exposing this truth so nakedly I hope others may be turned from their folly.

So I suggest that you pray for surviving family members to know in whose image we are all created and being drawn back to.  Humans are the endangered species we find ways to kill our children while in the womb to the tune of 73 million since abortion was legalized.  This is something even animals won't do.  This could be the only likely good outcome from this autobiographical human extinction documentary.  Sadly enough he killed not only himself but his girl friend and the bear that ate them both. The bears are still flourishing in their millions of acres set aside acres for their preservation. Not so their would be protectors!

2426702,5,B000BMY2NS,"I think this film is less about our need to connect with nature and more our need to be the hero of our own story, which becomes even more desperate the more we suspect that we might not be. While Treadwell's lack of filters meant he was less clever at hiding this need than most people are, I think it's also a fairly universal drive to feel that we are good people, that we are making a difference in the world and that we have some control over our destiny. The tragedy is that this drive can lead to disastrous unintended consequences (such as acclimating bears to human presence and making them more likely to be shot by poachers) and is occasionally interrupted by brutal reality.
What I love most about this film is its generosity in taking Treadwell at his word, at giving him his opportunity to be a star, while never losing sight of the wider context - that nature doesn't suffer heroes, that the world keeps turning whether we stand in the middle of it or not, but that the drive to connect, to nurture and to protect is still an admirable one.",1446249600,2,1055,4.387755102040816

DVD version states it's been altered and indeed the opening sequences with Timothy on Lettermen and Tom Snyder are gone, deleted, replaced with different interview footage. Also Treadwell recorded 100+ hours of footage so there is a lot of stuff we could have seen but instead we get to much of some interviews especially with some woman who was in a past relationship with Mr. Treadwell. But this biggest error is in not including the audio of Treadwell and Amie Huguenard meeting their end. Oh we get the scene of Herzog listening to the tape and saying it should never be heard. But this is like making a documentary of 9/11 but not including scenes
of the planes crashing into the building. If its too upsetting or ""disrespectful"", then maybe don't make the movie. Treadwell is on record as not only predicting this to be how he would die but actually wanting it. And there is plenty of footage here of people saying pretty disrespectful thing about the guy so I don't buy the reason the audio wasn't used because of some kind of respect.",1442880000,,1111,4.702564102564103
2426734,3,B000BMY2NS,"The helicopter pilot sent to haul away the remains of Timothy Treadwell and his girlfriend after they were eaten alive by a bear suggests that Treadwell was a retard who got what he deserved. Perhaps thats true. If he wasn't suicidal, and it doesnt seem he was, he had to be either stupid or crazy on some level to do what he did for so long. Not to mention his eccentric personality. Imagine Andy Dick camping out at Katmai National Park, talking to and interacting with wild grizzly bears as if they were harmless pets; no gun or anything to protect himself if one decides to attack. He loves those bears, he repeatedly insists, and lucky for us he was thoughtful enough to capture his antics on video.

Its only fitting that someone made a documentary about him, but Werner Herzog wasn't the right man for the job. Instead of an objective presentation, he inserts his own opinions, which portray Timothy Treadwell as someone to be admired. The worst part is when Herzog shows himself listening to the final minutes of Treadwells life; an audio tape of him and girlfriend Amie Huguenard struggling against the bear who ate them; without letting us hear any of it. Instead, he starts to cry and tells the woman playing it that it should be destroyed. What a complete idiot. People like him shouldnt be making documentaries. This one would be better if it were a lot shorter and stuck to the facts.

His ignorance of, and disrespect for, bears directly caused his death. He KNEW it was late in the season and bears were trying to fatten up prior to hibernation.  The fact that he lived for years on their periphery before one of them KILLED AND ATE HIM (""I'd die for them. I will not die by their claws."" Ha-ha! Are you sure about that?) doesn't prove his theories about grizzlies. It meant that he was so insignificant to them as to be beneath their notice.

Beautiful photography of beautiful animals, compiled from the film recoverd from Treadwell's camera after the attack, this is the story of a ""Darwin Award"" winner.

You can really see this in this film, in which he does nothing to pretend that the sacrifice of the main character was anything other than foolish, yet still manages to create an incredibly sympathetic portrait of him.  You truly get the sense that while Herzog disagrees with him, he still maintains nothing but respect for his ideals.
This is the kind of film that is frequently described as being ""once in a career,"" but increasingly it seems like these are the only kinds of films Herzog is capable of making:  triumph after triumph, any one of which most filmmakers would be delighted to call their career highlight.

I felt like he was doing what some of his critics said - not honoring the bears, but trying to subdue them or bend them to his will. It seemed to work with bears who were younger when he first met them, but it didn't work with mature, adult bears who had never encountered him - to his demise.

2427116,3,B000BMY2NS,"I originally wrote much more favorable review of this film.  (I'm trying to keep this a review of the film, not of Timothy Treadwell.  After I thought about it for a while, and it is a film that sticks in your mind, I decided to revise this.  Herzog narrates the film, stating iclearly that where Treadwell saw nature as a benign place where men and animals can live in harmony, that he sees it as violent and filled with hate.  Whee Treadwell sees a particular bear as loving him, Herzog says the bear only sees him as a potential meal.

The film does feature some of Treadwell's friends who shared his passion for caring for the bears and who see Treadwell as heroic.  But there are many more people who state that Treadwell was a fool who crossed the line between man and beast.  Apparently Treadwell gave
free presentations to school kids but we see only one brief still shot of that.  We see more shots of the coroner who gives way too much information than I needed to hear, than I cared to see.  The scene of him proudly presenting T's wristwatch to his friend was.....creepy.  Actually everything about the coroner was creepy but maybe that's the kind of personality who is attracted to that kind of work.  Theee ia a brief scene of Treadwell's parents that I personally found very offensive.  I wish Herzog would have left them in peace.

What Herzog fails to give any weight to, is the fact that Treadwell did survive for 13 seasons with the bears successfully.  That's a long time.  He must have done something right.  Why Treadwell chose, at the end of his 13th successful season to suddenly return to Grizzly Maze, is anyone's guess. Maybe he did have a death wish, maybe he wanted to go out, like the bumblebee who died while gathering pollen from the flower, doing what he loved to do.

The film is greatly enhances by Treadwell's own shots.  Herzog does give him some credit for his skill as a photographer even as he lambasts him for his over-acting.

I did a little research on Herzog's life.  He was born in Germany during WW!!.  The house next to the one where he was living was bombed by allied forces, forcing the family to  flee to the mountains.  When he was still very young his father left the family. I can certainly understand how such a traumatic childhood would instill in him the view that life was cruel and hateful.  Unfortunately I think his pessimistic view influenced this film for the worse.  The film is fascinating but I think it is seriously imbalanced.  I wish Herzog had used his great skill to make a better film.",1431388800,,2556,4.514161220043573

Unfortunately, Timothy Treadwell became too comfortable among them, and his naivet&eacute; and hubris proved to be fatal. He never understood the nature of these beasts, as even the native Americans, the Eskimos, were/are wary of the grizzlies and never venture into their territory. Whatever possessed Treadwell to do just the opposite for fourteen summers in a row is the subject of this remarkable film by one of his  friends the great documentarian Werner Herzog.

Treadwell was an interesting, albeit somewhat misguided character who spent 13 summers living among the Grizzlies in Katmai Nat'l Park in Alaska. I've read a variety of opinions about Timothy Treadwell and am inclined to agree with most of them. He was a troubled individual with good intentions who crossed the boundaries between man and beast, leading to his (and unfortunately also his girlfriend's) demise as a result. But what spoke to me most profoundly in this film was not the death of Timothy Treadwell by a creature he claimed he'd die to protect, but the life he was able to lead because of it. At one point in the film, Treadwell's own footage shows him overcome with emotional gratitude for his life among the bears who he claims saved him from spiraling drug and alcohol addiction. He had no life or purpose before his first grizzly encounter, but because of the bears he loved so much, he was able to live an impassioned, purposeful existence for 13 years (summers) among them. While I believe his end was tragic and unnecessary, it would feel wrong to condemn him for finding a reason to live.",1430092800,,1242,4.701834862385321

The film leaves you hanging thinking that all the work he did was useless and for nothing.

There is one guy that calls him stupid, I guess that there are people that fight for different causes and this was Timothy's.

2427265,5,B000BMY2NS,"I was intrigued through the entire film. I love how Herzog allows his subjects to express small frivolities that seem inconsequential, but actually allow you to feel a closeness to them. He allows you to care about what happens to them.
And thanks to Treadwell's snips, you come to know more about the bears , too
Unlike other reviewers, I find Treadwell compelling & deep, if unbalanced. He's certainly not the only person walking around who lives for the 'highs & lows'.  My take is that he wanted to be famous ala Steve Irwin & such. But he didn't fake his love for the animals. That was obviously sincere, as was his harmless, kind soul.
He actually becomes an over-emotional lunatic somewhere along the way.
It was clear on the last trip that Treadwell really didn't care if he lived or died.
I was almost convinced to despise him because of what happened to Annie, but then I thought she must have wanted to be there. At least, at first.
Herzog has that special knack to pull you in, give you different perspectives, allow nuances in personalities on screen.
Of course, not everybody is into documentaries, but I always think about his films for days after watching & always recommend them. .",1424995200,,1198,4.650943396226415
2427266,5,B000BMY2NS,"Treadwell documented the beauty and terror of nature, almost by accident sometimes.  Far from showing the bears as something that could be lived with, his films revealed death itself in the wild.  The viewer loves the little foxes he adopted, as though they were dogs......and then sees the fox remains after the wolves attacked.

Treadwell himself seemed developmentally delayed.  To be blunt, the kid wasn't all right.  He screamed at God when the bears were starving, cried about how much he loved them.  In the meantime, death was all around him.

Herzog is respectful of a man who inspired mockery, and Treadwell is given his place as a man who chronicled the best and worst of the wilderness.  But what makes it unforgettable?  It is a meditation on the fear that humans literally evolved from.....of being eaten alive by a monster.",1422921600,,838,4.886524822695035
2427267,5,B000BMY2NS,Wow. What a far out film.,1422748800,,25,3.3333333333333335
2427268,5,B000BMY2NS,"This is the third Werner Herzog movie I have seen, now, and I am becoming a huge fan of his.  His films have taken me into fascinating worlds I will never physically be in myself (a year in Antarctica, a winter in the Siberian Taiga, and thirteen summers living among grizzly bears) and I appreciate having had some taste of those worlds.  These three worlds are almost completely alien to my own life in Los Angeles, and yet I can feel a yearning for those other environments, or at least appreciate those who actually have lived in or adventured into them ""for me"".

It's very easy to condemn Timothy Treadwell, and from the advertising clips of this video, I figured I would hate the man who appeared foolish, and yet I felt that there was something in his life that was worth finding more about.  I admit to being prejudiced against his feminine voice, and his baby talk (""Over there is Mr. Chocolate...hi, Mr. Chocolate"", and so on), and he also seemed deranged in is self-aggrandizement.  But soon enough, I got over that.

Upon seeing this film, I do not condemn him at all. Yes, certainly, those bears that he lived amongst were already protected, he wasn't helping them at all, and yet it isn't fair to say that he wasn't doing any good for wild animal preservation efforts world wide.  After all, he did have that Grizzly foundation, and he was a welcome guest at schools.  He must have had some impact on ""the movement"" to protect certain wild things (whether people agree with the value of that or not is a different story.  The point is that he believed in it, and I believe he ultimately did do some good in that realm.  I, myself, had never seen a grizzly bear except maybe some photos or sculptures (the California Capitol building in Sacramento is loaded with grizzly bear motif carvings), not even in a zoo, and yet, thanks to Timothy Treadwell's hundreds of hours of footage and Werner Herzog's compilation, editing, and addition of other footage has made it so that anyone watching this movie will really get an eyeful of grizzlies in something close to their natural habitat in Alaska.

Treadwell was certainly always aware of the danger of being amongst the bears, he talked about it in his films almost constantly and also showed some scary moments that he had been able to back out of or gently escape from.  So it wasn't that he was stupid or unaware. Also, while he did end up being eaten by one of the bears, it ought to be appreciated as phenomenally remarkable that prior to that end, he had successfully lived thirteen summers with them!  That is not an achievement to be taken lightly, in my opinion.

I would have assumed that grizzlies were so dangerous that if you were anywhere near them at all, you would end up being eaten alive.  Ipso-facto--grizzly bear = death to a human.  But that ended up not being true, at least when it came to Timothy Treadwell, who, as I said, successfully lived with them for thirteen summers. How was he able to do that?  Was he really, truly, a ""Grizzly Bear Whisperer"" (as he seemed to think he was), or are grizzlies not really as dangerous as they are made out to be?  I think Timothy proved that humans actually could live among them safely (for a while, anyway!) if they kept to certain behavioral bounds, which he must have done, himself.  I don't doubt that if he acted or operated differently, then he could have been killed by the first bear he ever saw the first time he ever set foot into that habitat.  But somehow that didn't happen.

As his success with the bears continued summer after summer, I could imagine that he would develop the attitude that he had somehow been accepted by the bears, as that was his actual evidence.  It makes me think of a man in the news a few months ago who had a rescued Pit Bull dog as a pet. The dog was a sweetheart, very affectionate, and the man and dog slept cuddling in the same bed for months.  Very cute. But then one morning, the man's wife awoke to see her dead husband's face chewed off, having been suddenly attacked in the night by beloved Pit Bull.  It seems that you can never really determine the safety or danger of an animal until either it lives to an old age without incident and then dies, or it kills you first!

My guess is that to whatever it is that operates within the mind and heart of bears, Treadwell appeared to them as something that just did not quite compute. He was an oddity, so that while they may be interested in eating him, they thought it might be better to simply not mess with him.  As long as they had plenty of food that they were already familiar with, it might not be worth their while to attempt to tackle this oddball one.  Perhaps their palates had not yet developed a taste for this weird creature that roamed around on two legs, nor had they known yet how easily conquered a creature like that really was.

It was fascinating to see (and frightening to watch) the two male grizzlies battling it out over the female bear.  Despite how vicious it seemed, once it was over, it was clear that each bear had operated within a system of restraint.  It really was more like a wrestling match instead a battle to the death.  I think the bears were taking it up close to the limit of death, as if to say ""I could kill you now if you don't back down"", but their intention was not to go all the way if it wasn't necessary to do that in order to win the contest.  So they're not just cold-blooded killers; their rituals and their feeding habits have a certain intelligence and system behind them. Timothy Treadwell was something that did not really fit into that system, and that is probably what kept him alive so long, along with whatever cautions and restraints he had put forth.

SPOILER FOLLOWS HERE:  After all, it was a breaking of his normal pattern that seemed to get him killed; his coming back after it had been high time to leave, after the fight at the airline counter over the validity of his ticket made him get mad and take his girlfriend with him back to the Grizzly Maze (why she went along with all this is a mystery, but beyond my analysis).  Unfortunately, though, by now the bears who ""knew"" him were hibernating in their caves and the food supply was so low that that a new bear, migrating into the territory, very hungry, was seen desperately diving down to the bottom of the river with hopes of catching dead fish carcasses for food, that made Treadwell and his girlfriend vulnerable like they had never been before.  With there being no other food around, the stranger, the very hungry bear, had no restraint and that was the end of the two humans.

The same sort of ""violating the season"" thing led to Christopher McCandless  (""Into The Wild"") dying in Alaska.  He had waited too long to leave (in his case, being overcome by the arrival of spring) and thus felt trapped by the raging river that he could not cross to continue on his trek back out of Alaska.  He decided to stay put and wait for winter to come to freeze up the river again so that he could cross it, but there in the fields where he decided to stay, he ate toxic plants that looked like the safe plants he had been eating all along.  END OF SPOILER

The ultimate ending that had long been presumed for Treadwell eventually happened to him, but that should not obliterate the wonder of his success previously, nor does it diminish the value to us of the footage he filmed of these bears and thus generate the appreciation of this movie for its beauties, wonder, and exploration into the psychology of a person undergoing a unique and fascinating experience.  It doesn't matter to me whether he was insane or not (who am I to judge?), I can only say that he marched to a different drummer and his obsessions led to some knowledge and experience that I found beneficial for me to see.

The film actually made me come to like Treadwell and feel that I could partly understand him.  Instead of thinking that he was off his rocker, I feel that he was amazing to have been so relentless in following his dreams.  And I don't buy the argument that he brought harm to the bears due to his killer bear being put down.  We had already learned that the numbers of the bears have to be harvested from time to time or else they will be too numerous for their habitat and then some of them would starve.  This particular bear who fed his desperate hunger on the bodies of Treadwell and his girlfriend might very well have starved to death if he hadn't had that meal.  So like the Chinese tale of ""was it a good thing or a bad thing"" that happened, I can only be respectful of the fact that because of Treadwell (and Herzog) we have this fascinating film.

Where I really began to like Treadwell was with his scenes with the foxes.  Those were wild animals, too, and yet they got so they would lie with him and allow him to pet them for hours, which they seemed to enjoy (you can see how due to their curiosity and their ready acceptance of humans that the ""dog"" would be one of the first animals to be domesticated!).  He certainly must have had something that connected in a positive way with these animals.  His absolute love for them and appreciation of their beauty and of their ways is contagious and his adventures made it so that we could see and appreciate that, too.  Perhaps he had actually achieved something with the grizzlies.  Herzog didn't seem to think so, but I'm not so sure.",1422403200,,9424,4.438189204875218

2427292,5,B000BMY2NS,"I laughed.  I cried.  I cringed.

It is in many ways a heartbreaking story about a troubled guy.  Perhaps a ""touched"" guy who is capable of ferocious anger and childlike, angelic idealism.  The Yin and Yang, if you will.

Timothy Treadwell - the main character - is a lovable train wreck.  And - I suppose many of us have one or two of those troubled souls in our families.  Although - if you don't have one of those challenged spirits in your family, well, then maybe it's you!  Haha.

Timothy is a native New Yorker who grew up in a solidly middle-class family.  As an adult, he appears to have struggled with drug addiction, perhaps bi-polar issues, maybe depression,  anti-social tendencies,  and even schizophrenia?  But I'm no doctor.

Some of us find distractions to the toils and tribulations of life through: TV, dance, music, wine, Mario Brothers, tennis, work, travel, or other more self-destructive ventures like: motorcycles, sky-diving, drug abuse, promiscuity, self-harm and self-sabotage.

Timothy finds his blissful distraction from the toils of his earthly existence by living with Grizzly Bears.  I guess it would have been harder to live with Great White Sharks - because it's difficult to make a camp-fire in the middle of the ocean.

So - Timothy finds a way to hang out in Alaska for about 13 Summers.  And he records his experience with video cameras.  The recordings are amazing: beautiful, magical, ominous, scary, humorous, disturbing, well-edited, well-lit and well-framed.

Kudos go to Werner Herzog.  He edited Timothy's footage and narrated the story in a highly insightful, thoughtful and capable way.  The interviews are also enlightening.  The opinions shared by those interviewed in this film can probably represent most of the sentiments people would have regarding Timothy's choice to live with Grizzly Bears for the summer.

The helicopter pilot and former rodeo-rider who drops off and picks up Timothy from the wilderness seems to be the ideal character:  he is rugged and macho - yet he speaks of Timothy with love and compassion.  He's almost a saint-like character.  Perhaps he deserves a documentary of his own?

Some said Timothy was mentally ill.  Some said he was disturbed and found solace among the bears.  Some said he was violating the laws of nature.  Some said he was attempting to give his troubled life a sense of purpose.  One seemingly mean-spirited guy said Timothy was ""retarded"" and that ""Timothy probably thought the Grizzlies were people in bear suits.""

Well - I for one - believe that Timothy believed the bears were real bears - haha.

This documentary also reminds me of Sigmund Freud.  Freud wrote a book called ""Civilization and It's Discontents.""  Some people simply have a hard time fitting in to the confines of civilization.  This may have been Timothy's challenge.  The judgments and restrictions of modern times can be so hard for some sensitive souls to accept.  Also - perhaps within Timothy is the struggle between the Id, Ego, and Superego.

In the end I believe his Superego succeeds in the face of what must have been a most fear inducing experience.  He is still able to think of others when he tells his lover to run away.  Will she make it to safety??

Of course - the resistance to civility is no excuse to be an evil criminal.  But Timothy was not an evil criminal.  He seemed to be a troubled and childlike guy who had a difficult time accepting the notion of working in an office cubicle.

So - he lived with bears.  And recorded the experience.  And shared his experience with others - especially with kids.  And he seemed to feel gleeful and purposeful in doing so.

This film is definitely a moving and insightful gift.  Grizzly Man has abundant life lessons.  One of which is:  if you follow a troubled soul to the end of the earth, you may be killed in the name of love.  Another lesson?  Who are we to really judge the journey of someone generous enough to let us see his interesting world?  Especially when his world didn't seem to ""bother the cows...""",1415059200,3,4046,4.816326530612245

2427314,5,B000BMY2NS,One of the most entertaining films I've seen. I give this as a gift regularly to fellow academics. The story of Timothy Treadwell is narrated by a German who comments subtly on the downward spiral of Timothy's grizzly encounters and the brutality of nature that Timothy doesn't seem to perceive. The editing is fantastic and I've found it a conversation starter about states of mental health and perceptions of danger and self preservation. I'm in public health field so perhaps more interesting to me that others but a good purchase for anyone wanting to be amazed and shocked a bit. No gruesome imagery is shown so there is no actual attack on film (only muffled audio that is barely featured).,1407456000,,696,4.808333333333334

2427316,5,B000BMY2NS,"I can't say that I loved this film BUT not because it was poorly made.  In the world of film making this is an exquisite example of using kid gloves to document Timothy Treadwell's descent into madness.
It is my opinion that his obsession with the grizzlies was just a replacement for his alcoholism.  Treadwell credits the bears for his sobriety but it is clear that he is intoxicated with their mere presence.
He was a passionate man who, according to various acquaintances, led a troubled existence outside the wilds of Alaska. This 'protector of animals' shows us his delicate reverence for them.  However, reverence is not respect.  It is the act of bowing to an entity greater than oneself.  If you believe in a God then perhaps there is a reason a person experiences heaven at the end of ones time on earth.  We are meant to LIVE life.  Treadwell lived his idea of heaven, never taking into consideration that it was not his time to be there.
This young man's broken psyche increasingly makes itself visible the closer he comes to the end of his life.  He is seen speaking to his animals in a childlike voice that can be interpreted as meant for his juvenile viewers.  Then his commentary becomes peppered with obscenities.  Eventually he goes off on an almost incomprehensible rant against the Park Service who is the true protector of the animals.
Herzog rightfully pays tribute to Treadwell by showing his brilliant footage of a wilderness community of which he believed he was a citizen.  The director of GRIZZLY MAN exposes a new, perhaps expanded audience to the sad plight, not of the wildlife population, but of a solitary man who managed to cheat death for twelve years before he succumbed to it in his thirteenth out on the Grizzly Maze.
Although Treadwell was excellent at showing us his world he broke the first rule of documentary film making; tell the story, don't be the story.  Because of this deadly mistake, Herzog becomes the storyteller, only once taking part in the narrative when he is seen listening to the last awful moments of the lives of Treadwell and his girlfriend.  Herzog created an even more macabre documentary when out of respect for these two lives and those of the loved ones they left behind he did not share the audio of the actual event .
As I said at the start of this review, I did not love this movie.  I do say this is a work of cinematic art which need not be pleasing; it simply needs to be thought provoking, which this film is.
I highly recommend GRIZZLY MAN.",1406160000,6,2513,4.605381165919282
2427317,5,B000BMY2NS,"Hard to explain how fascinating this movie is.

Not nuts about the way the director inserts himself into the movie. He films himself listening to the audio of a bear attack. And there's a scene where a lady is given the personal belongings of a dead friend where it seems very awkward and staged (the director seems to have set up this scene, or perhaps asked them to reenact something that had already happened previously).

Still, it's a kind of beautiful movie to watch. Very nice use of the fellow's camcorder recordings.",1406160000,,525,4.695652173913044
2427318,5,B000BMY2NS,"On the one hand, the film footage is remarkable and astonishing.  Lots of shots that could have never been done any other way.  On the other, clearly Treadwell didn't have a clue how nature works.  He not only thought he was part of the bear community, but was actually a bear himself.  Not only did the bears know differently, but I didn't see him catching salmon in the river or hear how he hibernated in the Alaskan mountains during its brutal winters.  In fact, the video didn't say anything about how he spent his winters.  Also telling was how he mourned the death of a fox pup without showing any understanding (or rejoicing) that the wolves had meal to help them survive another day.  Short sighted at best?  In the end, this mistake cost him his life.

Overall the documentary it very slanted as it portrays Treadwell in a favorable light.  Whereas, hes just another space cadet who doesnt have a clue about the physical world around him.  At one point the film parades out an X-girlfriend of only a couple of years and then treats her as if she is his widow.  If not misleading, its a real cumbia moment thats cheesy, hooky, and lame.  Treadwell and folks like him need to get it that animals are not humans and stop attributing human characteristics to them.  Or, tragically, their fate will be like his.",1405900800,,1315,4.540425531914893

2427321,5,B000BMY2NS,"Five stars says ""I love it,"" but this isn't the kind of movie one loves -- any more than one might say, ""I just loved that King Lear!"" All I mean is that it is very compelling, in something of the same way that Jon Krakauer's ""Into the Wild"" is compelling. What drives people like Chris McCandless or Timothy Treadwell? we're tempted to ask. And Krakauer's book and Werner Herzog's movie exist in part to show that that question can't be answered and that yet what we're contemplating is a human life. So we reach for familiar terms --""crazy,"" ""idiotic,""  ""heroic"" -- and realize that these categories don't help. They allow us the cheap luxury of judgment, but they add nothing to our understanding. What follows are some random comments on a fascinating documentary:

1. As a film-maker himself, Herzog (who narrates as well as directs) is fascinated by Timothy Treadwell's own film-making -- how deliberate and careful it is, even in the inhospitable conditions. Treadwell's focus of interest, even obsession, was the grizzlies, but he would do retakes of scenes of his own narration to get them the way he wanted them. Herzog also notes the histrionic element in Treadwell -- he's an actor as well as a film-maker, and he's conscious of how he wants to come across. So, the movie can be seen as a kind of tribute from one artist to another.

2. Treadwell seems to see himself as a protector of the grizzlies, even though the grizzlies aren't really in need of protection, living as they do within a National Park. There is hardly any poaching (though Treadwell talks as if there is), and it becomes clear that for him ANY human interaction with the bears, apart from his own, is seen as a kind of violation. Clearly it matters to Treadwell to see himself as a defender. We learn that some of his behavior in late adolescence and young manhood was rather self-destructive. Is his engagement with the bears -- 13 years worth of it -- a kind of over-compensation for his earlier carelessness? A kind of commitment to a very hard kind of caring?  Incidentally, Treadwell was 47 when he died.  He comes across as much younger, as if there is something not quite fully adult about him -- but then ""adult"" might be another of these unhelpful categories that make us think we're describing when in fact we're judging.

3. Like Chris McCandless, Treadwell seems to have won the affection of a number of people who have a sense of him as a special kind of person. There's something likeable about him, perhaps never more so than in the scenes with the foxes, which seem totally comfortable in his presence. He says he loves them, and they are lovable, and that helps us take seriously his assertions of his love for the bears -- that and the wonderful images of them, which, for all his sentimental rhetoric about them, nonetheless don't strike us (the viewers) as sentimental domestications. These are big hairy beasts, with huge claws and big teeth. We don't believe that he's blind to the dangerousness of these creatures -- and besides, we hear him say frequently that they might kill him, and that he would under no circumstances kill one of them (he was unarmed on his trips).

4. Treadwell does seem to believe that he has achieved something unusual, even unique, in the way he has established relations with the bears in the wild. He talks as if the bears ""know"" him in some meaningful way.  Herzog at one point makes clear that he thinks that that was a dangerous illusion and that species boundaries are clear and uncrossable. When he looks into the eyes of a bear that Treadwell has filmed, he sees ""a gaze blank and pitiless as the sun"" (Yeats's phrase, not used by Herzog, but you get the idea) indicative of an indifference of nature to us which we humans deny at our peril. Some others in the movie echo these sentiments. Are they right? Treadwell spent extended periods over thirteen years close to these creatures -- what boundary are we talking about exactly, anyway? Treadwell never thought of himself as a bear, nor (despite giving them names) did he see the bears as human, so his sense of his difference from the bears seems to me always present, despite his awareness of the unusual relation he is in.

5. The most disturbing character in the film is not Treadwell but the coroner who had the job of examining the remains of Treadwell and his girlfriend -- remains, as he is at pains to tell us, that had to be recovered from inside the bear that ate them. There is a creepy intensity about his narration that bothers me more than any of Treadwell's own sometimes self-aggrandizing comments. Talking of probably meaningless categories, I find myself wanting to call the coroner ""unprofessional"" -- but I really mean ""creepy""!

6. I haven't made up my mind about the scene in which we see Herzog listening to audio of the deaths of Treadwell and his friend, played through headphones, while one of Treadwell's friends, an ex-lover, looks on. The viewer does not hear the audio. Herzog seems visibly upset by what he hears (he stops the audio before it's finished) and tells the woman to destroy the tape. What's the point of that scene? It seems perhaps self-indulgent on Herzog's part. Does it add anything?

Treadwell says that he would never hurt a bear, and we believe him (he is, in his own eyes, ""the kind warrior"").  In Coleridge's poem, The Ancient Mariner just up and killed the albatross. Why?  It was in him to do it, just as it was in Treadwell to act as he did. In a sense that's no answer to the question of why, and yet it's maybe the only answer we can honestly give before the culturally-conditioned rationalizations kick in. Treadwell's life was a human life. Deal with it.",1404604800,,5707,4.6442021803766105

2427334,5,B000BMY2NS,"The strength of this movie is Herzog's very respectful but hard look at its subject, Timothy Treadwell. Unlike Sean Penn in his movie Into The Wild, Herzog is much more skeptical than Penn about his subject's motives as well as the place of man in Nature. Nature for Herzog is an inspiring and magnificent force that has no place for humanity. Treadwell believes that he can be one with Nature and the grizzlies, but he ultimately ends up as bear poop. You might say that Nature literally shat him out. That might seem cruel, but that little joke of mine sums up Herzog's attitude to Herzog and all of us. Needless to say, Herzog--a filmmaker legendary for mounting impossible productions in the wildest of natural locations--sees a little of himself in Treadwell. His ironic and detached attitude--unsentimental but never cruel--is also a reflection on his own role as a movie director.

The biggest problem of the movie is Herzog's own philosophical musings throughout the movie. For the most part, they seem unnecessary, self-indulgent, and condescending. He should know that the average person who watches a Werner Herzog movie is probably an intelligent, educated person who has no need for elucidation and BGO (i.e., blinding glimpse of the obvious).

Finally, if you've read a lot of Melville, especially Moby-Dick, you will probably enjoy this movie as much as I did. Herzog's view of Nature is very similar to Melville's in Moby-Dick.",1403395200,,1443,5.008333333333334

That is a full 180 degrees from the truth. You are not a victim or hero if you walk up to the edge of the Grand Canyon and jump off. What makes you a victim or hero if you pick a fight with a white shark? Or a 600 pound tiger? Or, probably worst on land, a grizzly bear?

The recordings Treadwell made of the animals and nature around him were indeed beautiful.  Unfortunately that was the only good thing that could be said about this person.

For Treadwell was clearly a basket case of mental problems.  He traveled to a state park in Alaska and camped among the bears and foxes, giving them cutesy names like Mister Chocolate to a grizzly bear and Ghost to a red fox.  His monologues vacillated between aw-shucks speeches and high-pitched, profanity-filled screeching.  He fancied himself a protector of the bears-but of course he could give the bears no protection from any possible danger.  He even brought his childhood teddy bear to his camp from home.  I found him irritating, deluded, and frightening-someone who lived in his childhood fantasy world where the wild bears and foxes were his friends, when at best they probably viewed him as some oddball creature who appeared in the locale every once in a while.  He had friends, but it was hard for me to imagine how anyone could stand to be around him.  He ended up staying later at his camp than usual, owing to scheduling problems-and he encountered a bear who did NOT know him or view him as a normal part of the local area, and that what killed him.

The best account of him came toward the beginning from an Alaskan native, who said that Treadwell was a man who had no respect for the bears.  I agree.",1402617600,2,1610,4.710714285714285

2427341,5,B000BMY2NS,"I think many of the reviews here miss the deeper message within this film.  The purpose of this film was not to explore whether or not Timothy was misguided in his pursuit of a life with wild grizzly bears. Rather it is a profile of a troubled spirit that found solace in a unique and extreme way of life.  The tragedy of the story is that the very source of his solace ultimately took his life.

Remarkably, Timothy never seemed to show regret over that. In fact, he appeared to accept that death in the wilderness may ultimately be his fate.

To me this is a story about the human spirit, inspiration and love.  Although I would never advocate his methods, I personally found Timothy's purity, drive and commitment inspiring and found his story to be uniquely beautiful.",1400544000,,772,4.565217391304348

The footage of the bears and their environment is spectacular - Treadwell was an excellent cameraman - even though I watched his close encounters with the bears with an undercurrent of anxiety and even some voyueristic guilt, knowing the ultimate outcome.

2427356,4,B000BMY2NS,"I am a big fan of Werner Herzog's documentary work, including ""Into the Abyss"", ""Cave of Forgotten Dreams"", ""Happy People: A Year in the Taiga"" and ""Encounters at the End of the World"". I may not always agree with his viewpoint, but he never fails to bring an engaging documentary. Somehow I had never seen what is perhaps his best known documentary, ""Grizzly Man"". I finally corrected that oversight recently.

""Grizzly Man"" (2005 release; 103 min.) brings the story of Timothy Treadwell, the self-proclaimed ""protector"" of grizzly bears in the Alaska Peninsula. The movie opens with footage from Treadwell in Alaska, proclaiming his love and loyalty and respect for the bears. Then we learn that after spending 13 summers in a row, Treadwell and his girlfriend were killed by a bear in 2003. Herzog's documentary can be divided up into two parts: a look at the immediate circumstances of their deaths, and a broader look at the life ot Treadwell, including a selection of the ample amounts (over 100 hours, we are told) of footage he shot during his stays in Alaska. As to the immediate circumstances of their deaths: it is incredible difficult to sit through that, for obvious reasons. The attack of the bear was recorded on audio but not video, but thankfully we do not hear the audio. Beware: there are some gruesome/shocking pictures of those events shown in the documentary. As to Treadwell's life and his visits to Alaska,: it turns out he is a very troubled, and troubling, individual, almost delusional really. He talks about his respect for the bears and other animals, ""loves"" them the way I love my cat, except that of course bears and wild foxes are not pets. Even stranger are his repeated claims how he is ""protecting"" the bears, but not once do we see him actually DO something, other than hanging around. Most telling are the comments from the locals, including the Alaskan natives: ""Tim crossed a line that we haven't crossed in 7,000 years. By showing up in their midst, he disrespected the grizzlies."" Another comments: ""Tim got what he deserved, he basically asked for it"". Wow. Of course, the true tragedy is that his girlfriend, who didn't care much for the bears in the first place, was pulled into this tragedy, paying with her life. So sad.

""Grizzly Man"" is an outstanding documentary, on so many levels. Even though it is hard to feel ""bad"" for Treadwell, given the overall circumstances, it nevertheless is a human story that should be seen, and who better to bring it than Werner Herzog. It's is yet another must-see documentary from the legendary German director. I'll go see any documentary he makes. ""Grizzly Man"" is HIGHLY RECMMENDED!",1395360000,,2669,4.850877192982456

The part that was most powerful for me was when the filmmaker was listening to the last audio recording of Timothy and his girlfriend before they died.  In this scene, we as the audience didn't need to hear is as it was more powerful to witness someone else responding to the audio track.

Our imaginations are often more powerful than the visuals on screen.  I think the message for me at least while watching this film was to leave wild animals alone.

Treadwell The Imbecile:

As far as Tim Treadwell goes. He's a screw-up. Someone who just never got it together. He's delusional, self-aggrandizing and at the same time self-loathing. He appears to be so uncomfortable with his own being that it makes watching him painful. This self-proclaimed ""protector"" of the bears actually does nothing except watch them. Why is that? The answer is simple, they don't need his protection and he is ultimately powerless to begin with. His ""quest to save the bears"" is really a sad attempt and getting some attention.  Unfortunately for Treadwell and his partner, his game is also dangerous. Some people feel bad for him - after all, his death was gruesome, but somehow all I could feel was disbelief. It was like watching an idiot standing on a train track, then walk off just in time to avoid being hit. He does this over and over until finally, one last time, he doesn't walk away soon enough. The saddest part was that he convinced his companion to go along for the last visit to ""the grizzly maze"". I wasn't sure what to make of Amy - you learn almost nothing about her. I have to think she was a pretty sad person as well for no reason other than she was Treadwell's partner and he was so disturbed. Two go in, none come out.

Herzog The Mocking Film Maker:

There was also something extremely creepy about this film. It's as if Herzog said, I am going to make a movie about this pathetic and sad man. I will pretend to be making a movie that is objective yet sensitive to Treadwell's ""cause"" but ultimately I will show him and his family for the fools that they are. And he did just that. Each interview is shot in such a way that you felt you were watching Second City TV. The way he presented Treadwell's parents was very telling. The camera shows the father and mother sitting indoors and the father is wearing those flip-up sunglasses that fit over regular glasses. They were flipped up because they were indoors. The result is that he looks like a caricature of Eugene Levy. It is intentional because from any another other angle you would see that he is wearing sunglasses - but from straight on, he looks comical - laughable. Why didn't Herzog say ""for this shot please remove the sunglasses"" - I believe he didn't because he wanted to make these people look stupid and foolish. He used them.

There is another clip of an old ""friend"" of Treadwell's.  Of all the footage and conversation that must have taken place, Herzog selects a few lines of dialog for the movie. And of those few lines,  he chooses to include one in which the friend mentions how amazed he was that Treadwell's receding hairline was always covered by his prince valiant haircut. Wtf? Again, this interview appeared to be a comedy sketch. I wonder if that person was actually a real friend or maybe the entire interview was bogus.

Herzog also goes out of his way to show Treadwell's two female friends in such a way that they come across as spaced out, naive and yes, once again stupid people.

The medical examiner comes across like a cartoon character. Again, it had to be intentional  - it was just too comical.

I won't go into the sound track other than to say I have one of those songs stuck in my head and I can't help but think it was originally written for A Mighty Wind but didn't make the cut.

I think Herzog is also mocking the American audience with this. He's laughing at us.

I don't think this is an important film. Actually, I think it is a POS. I am not alone in this opinion - it is so bad that there are a series of youtube videos out there dedicated to poking fun at Treadwell, the movie and Herzog.

With that said, I'd also say - watch it when it is convenient. When you're totally bored and there's nothing else going on. If you need an excuse to not shovel the walk, or not paint the room or not take out the garbage - tell yourself ""I think I'll watch that Herzog film - he's such a great writer/ director"". If you happen to have a TV in your bathroom, all the better.",1392422400,3,4333,4.39875
2427365,5,B000BMY2NS,"It's almost too easy to dismiss Timothy Treadwell with condescending words like ""naive"" and ""misguided."" Like a felon who finds religion, the film explores the unanswerable question of what drove Timothy Treadwell's obsession, and whether it was his salvation in a short but well-lived life or just another demon in a doomed, troubled life. It tells the story of one man's ultimately fatal search for meaning in his life.

I agree with the review that says the filmmaker's point of view can seem almost satirical at times. But to me, Tim Treadwell comes across as most people do once you see them up close or know them well--sometimes heroic, loving and full of good intentions, and sometimes a childish, self-involved jerk. His acknowledgment of the very real danger in what he was doing meant that either he knew he could be killed and didn't care, as he claimed, or that he was just engaging in grandiose mythmaking because he didn't really believe it was risky due to a real or imagined rapport with animals who were used to his presence, as he also claimed. It's complicated.

And was there any validity to his belief that the animals in the preserve knew him well enough not to harm him? The fact that the killings occurred outside of the protected area at a time when he intended to be gone speaks to the possibility that his 13-year mission was not necessarily the delusional deathwish that some people think, and that returning to the camp at that time could have been just one very unfortunate risk that should never have been taken.

What seems to anger a lot of people is that he brought Amie Huguenard with him. Her death is obviously terrible and tragic, but she was an adult woman and it does her a disservice not to give her credit for making an informed decision to accompany him. The fact that two bears ended up being shot dead because their self-appointed guardian was in their natural habitat at a time of year when he probably shouldn't have been, and with no non-lethal protection that might have saved them all, is an irony that makes this story almost Shakespearean, with Tim Treadwell playing either the tragic hero, the villain or the fool, depending on how you see it.

The film briefly touches on the seemingly good work that Treadwell did with children during the school year but, by the end, it isn't clear if he did more good or harm for the cause. Whatever judgments people want to make about him, the film documents an admittedly flawed man who was either unwilling or unable to live an ordinary life. He wanted to be famous and now he is.",1391904000,5,2573,4.635964912280702

2427367,5,B000BMY2NS,"The movie is a compilation from about 100 hours of video taken from Tim Treadwell's camera.  The footage that is shown slants or biases the movie in a certain direction toward Treadwell.  Herzog (movie maker) isn't fair in selecting his cuts to make the movie...I know because I watched more video that was presented on Discovery Channel that showed much more in 1/2 hour segments.  That being said here is my review.

First, the movie is well made and is crafted in a way to entertain, bewilder and make you shake your head.  It is simply a work of art by Herzog.  The scenery is stunning, the scenes that are selected are funny, amazing and tragic so there is a roller coaster ride for the viewer.

Second, Herzog presents Mr. Treadwell as somewhat off-center, always showing the more vulnerable moments (which makes for great viewing and entertainment).  I don't believe the scenes chosen for the movie present Mr. Treadwell his total personality when he was filming himself.  It mostly showed Tim's darker and volatile side.

Third, To fully understand Tim Treadwell one needs to do some quick research.  This will give you a total picture of what he was about.  There are some fascinating facts about Treadwell (not his real name) that are glossed over in the movie.  I'm not defending Treadwell just trying to get the big picture of what he was about and who he was.  The movie definitely shows only one side and one should know that there are many sides to a person.

Overall, I really did like this movie.  It really forced me to make choices and I found myself asking, ""What would I do"" or ""Would I do that?""  One can't help but judge Treadwell from the slant the movie takes.  That is a natural reaction.  But in doing so revisit some comments by Treadwell and Herzog alike and then investigate Treadwell beyond what the movie shows.  Some might change their views on certain things that are presented in the movie.  I hope that anyone who watches the movie does investigate further rather than have a knee-jerk reaction to the movie and leaves it at that.  It is about much more than what is presented.",1391644800,,2113,4.638814016172507
2427368,5,B000BMY2NS,"Spoil alert: this is based on a true story and if you did any research you know that this man does not live to tell his story as he was alive. However, his story lives on through his diaries and footage that he had collected over the years he spent with these gentle but wild giants. The moral of this story is that we must respect the wild and not try to get too close. I am glad Timothy Treadwell had advanced what we now know of grizzlies today, but I am saddened by the outcome and how he had perhaps gone too far to get a closer vantage point.",1391385600,,548,3.9909090909090907
2427369,5,B000BMY2NS,"I gave this 5 stars just mostly having received the product and at a reasonable rate (I could easily find worse ways to spend 10 bucks but learning something from it, is never a waste), and as part of an Environmental History course that I was going through in College I wanted to prove to my professor that was taking his course seriously.  Just a warning before you buy the 'Grizzly Man' (or at least something that I would give to myself, before watching this in the classroom) expect to watch a lot dumb or weird self blogs from an environmentalist that is probably delusional with a list of psychological issues that range from A-Z on their list.  I even leaned over to one of my classmates in the front row, and asked him what age that he thought that he was in one part of the segment while Timothy Treadwell was exploding in front of the camera...

I have a lot of regards and respect for Mr. Treadwell, but presentation was not a clear factor while he was making these footages; despite the retakes.  It's hard to defend the environment if you allow yourself to become this hysterical over the topic, you must take it personal (YEAH) because it's your world and your environment; but try to bring yourself to the same level as the people that you're trying to convince.

2427370,3,B000BMY2NS,"Is this how madness vis-a-vis man's relationship to animals begins, with the anthropomorphization of them so that ever-needing-to-be-dominant man may feel comfortable in his conceit that the lesser creatures are comprehensible by his own lights?  By way of his talking cartoon animals, has Disney and others of his ilk done more harm to man and his relationship with animals than good?  In the case of Timothy Treadwell obviously so.  Early footage shows him as a boy with his best-friend squirrel.  Filming himself in his tent while on one of his thirteen bear seasons in Alaska, there is the cutest little stuffed teddy bear right there with him. He gave the real grizzlies cute pet names like Mr. Chocolate and Rowdy - when he perhaps would have maintained perspective much better if he'd called them Rip and Claw instead.  A few years back a man and his wife brought a birthday cake to their pet chimp - and for whatever reason the cute chimp the couple had raised from infancy turned on the cake-bearing man and took away his face and testicles.  An old lady who loved her dozens of house cats and thought they loved her as much as she loved them died and, when found, the cats had eaten her face off.  Dr. Doolittle was a movie - and the ""wild"" world that animals inhabit isn't called wild for naught.

But Treadwell seemingly believed love could conquer the most savage nature - but his love doesn't seem to be so much a love for the creatures he loved to lord it over as it was his attempting in some strange way to convince his bears and his foxes that he loved them so much that they would be completely incapable of not loving him back.  The tragic truth is he looked for love in all the wrong places.  When he is seen on tape mourning the little dead fox, is it the plight of the fox that he is truly saddened about?  Or is it that by transposing himself into the fox's fur he is only just pitying himself?  Remember Travis Bickle in TAXI DRIVER talking loco to himself in front of his mirror because his life in the city has proved lonely, loveless and therefore inevitably violent?  Well, on self-filmed tapes we see Treadwell in the loneliness of the wilderness likewise going loco in his insane rant and rage against the world of men that he simply couldn't control and conquer. In this disturbing sequence are we seeing a man who truly is a spokesman for the wildlife he vows to protect even with his life, if needs be - or are we seeing a man who feels so ineffective, so inconsequential in the world of his kind that he must create a kingdom all his own amongst the beasts?  In the scene where he prays for rain so that the river will rise and the salmon swim into the bear-jaws of death, when he rudely, arrogantly demands rainfall from all the deities at his disposal, and when that rain does, indeed come, is he thankful to a higher power or does he instead only see himself as that higher power?  As Nietzsche said: ""In the end, all we experience is...ourselves.""

Werner Herzog, maker of this film, says in it ""I believe the common denominator of the Universe is not harmony, but chaos, hostility and murder.""  Tim Treadwell believed that behind the savage facade there was love and compassion to be found if only one looked deeply for it. Both men are right and both are wrong.  There is chaos, yes, but there is also unending creation.  There is hostility, but there also is the holy. Murder to be sure, but also the saving grace of new birth. There is harmony and there is horror.  There is love and there is lunacy - and Tim Treadwell exemplified both those qualities. He walked the tightrope betwixt those two fragilities trying to tread well until he lost his footing and fell into delusion and madness.  Perhaps he should have taken off the sunglasses oftener - and not viewed the world through the glass darkly, but seen it much more clearly than he ever thought he did.

Werner Herzog's nihilistic agenda isn't so much about offering us a fuller picture of Tim Treadwell.  Herzog wants to offer unto his viewers evidence for his thesis that the Universe is, ultimately, a charnel house, a cosmic cell wherein all living things are inmates and await the time and terms of their executions.  But where in GRIZZLY MAN is the Tim Treadwell who wrote a book and was on Letterman?  In the 13 years in the wild, did he ever actually edit and release a video for public consumption? How often and how far and wide did he go on his classroom talks? What about his life away from the grizzlies, each year he would fly home to humanity?  We learn little about these and other matters - so as a more complete view, the work fails.  Herzog's purpose was to illumine the lunacy much more than the life of Timothy Treadwell.  But as an examination of the thin line between love and lunacy, GRIZZLY MAN makes for some very sad and savage viewing. But keep the kiddies away - and not so much because of the Grizzly Man's grisly fate. No, rather because this Mr. Rogers of the Wild talks cartoon cute on minute and foul-mouthed beyond belief the next.  Witnessing these sudden Jekyll and Hyde transformations would only disturb youngsters not clued in yet to the duality in man.

Did Tim Treadwell have a death wise? Or was he daring the Universe to be a kinder and gentler place by offering himself up as sacrifice if his challenge should fail?  Was he daring the Maker of men and bears to kill him by using the claws and teeth of those creatures he loved just to prove to himself who was really the more powerful? If he could demand rain from the gods and get it, did he therefore think he could further command Creation to acknowledge his vital importance in the scheme of things and thereby prove itself worthy of his love?  Did he dare death so that he might feel he could ultimately control it?  When the grizzly that ate him had hold of his head and he was screaming for his life, did he then feel that it wasn't he who had failed but rather god?  And if it was god who failed him and not he who had failed God, then the better of the two had to have been Treadwell himself. It is said that one always kills the thing they love.  In Treadwell's case, the things he loved killed him.  He said that he loved the bears so much that he would die for them.  Instead, he died because of them - and because of him two bears were shot to death the day after his demise. If only Treadwell had heeded the words and wisdom of Dirty Harry who once said ""A man's got to know his limitations.""  If only Treadwell truly and fully respected Nature instead of wanting to own and control if.  If only...",1390780800,4,6607,4.428925619834711

2427390,4,B000BMY2NS,"Compelling retrospective documentary about maverick animal activist, Tim Treadwell, who lives with bears for months at a time in the uncompromising Alaskan wilderness. Directed with brutal frankness and sensitivity by Werner Herzog [FITZCARRALDO, 1982; ENCOUNTERS AT THE END OF THE WORLD, 2007], we see the seemingly carefree and likeable adventurer tempting fate living among these ravenous mammoths without weapons or other safeguards. It soon becomes apparent that we are seeing a dysphoric young man---angry, delusional, often paranoid, possibly bipolar---and we are witnessing his descent into self-termination. The story predictably ends in tragedy. A female friend who Treadwell brought along, purportedly afraid of bears, was also victimized. Herzog does not shield us from the horrors of Treadwell's demise unsettling the viewer with simple descriptions of the discovery of the attack site, of a few minutes of audio that he listened to [thankfully and properly never revealed] and a visit to the pathologist.

Herzog sporadically interviews people throughout the docu including Treadwell's inner circle of friends, critics, and enablers. There is even a brief talk with his parents and a bizarre and creepy interview with the pathologist who conducted the autopsy on his remains.
Life's cast of characters that we all know are probably here: the envious and the hateful who are constantly waiting for one to fall;
the superficial and showy who like to hang and gabble but don't care about delving any deeper; the unyielding and self-righteous traditionalists/conformists who prejudge without working hard to procure veracity; the empty and lonely who often blindly follow the kind and friendly without testing their judgement.

Although there may have been an inborn proclivity to his mental dissolution it is probable that there were plenty of zombies, false prophets and other bystanders in this eccentric's life who contributed or just didn't make things any better. His social isolation, aversion to people, especially of authority, and escape from the pain of disordered relationships and an elusive identity suggests this.

There is a tremendous clip, filmed by Treadwell, of two huge grizzlies brutally battling it out for dominance. The struggle is so ferocious that one of the behemoths empties it bowels. The filmmaker, however, is unable to grasp the import of what he is filming: feral indifference to anything except survival and reproduction.

This story just a reminder that prejudgement of those who are different is not just a racial issue but is omnipresent among and within homogeneous or specific groups such as families, friends, fraternities and the factory; and that indolent caring [feeling and saying] is not enough BUT caring AND being physically proactive and persistent, early in the course of our suspicions, when logic, experience and instinct tells us that an individual's behavior is anomalous.",1379894400,,2936,5.503325942350332

I lived in Alaska and helped develop some homesites (similar to homesteads) in the interior (between the Alaska and Brooks mountain ranges). This land is the Last Frontier and it remains essentially wild. It is a land of tremendous beauty based on scale, of unfolding naturalness. It is a land of present day Darwinism, which doesn't suffer fools. Timothy Treadwell didn't understand this and thought himself something more than he was. Maybe his previous years of substance abuse scrambled his greymatter. He thought he was a champion of wild animals and, more appalling in a delusional sense, one of them. In the end, I guess that's what he became. The tragedy is that he was complicit in taking his girlfriend with him. My heart goes out to her family. This story is similar to but fundamentally different from Chris McCandless' story portrayed in John Krakaeur's excellent book Into the Wild (the movie is also very good).

2427416,3,B000BMY2NS,"Timothy lost his life, and the life of another, because of some sort of quest to be famous. Only someone with a mental illness could rationalize living among the wild Grizzly populace and pretending to talk and play with them for some irrational quest for stardom that really never made since. These wild animals are extremely dangerous and it is documented knowledge that the Grizzly have been known to hunt and devour man; the same way a man would hunt and devour the Grizzly.

The only thing amazing I found about the footage shot was that Timothy survived 13 years before being eaten alive, with his female partner, apparently while resting in their tent. Then again, that is exactly how these animals will strike - when you least expect. Timothy obviously did what he did for some type of celebrity status - he did mention such, that he was a self made celebrity during the film. However, It was apparent to me that Timothy was also uneasy or scared during a lot of the documentary - I could hear and sense the fear in his voice.

He continuously made the comments that he would give his life for those Grizzly - and so he did by being devoured and eaten alive. He noted on several occasions that he would not harm the Grizzly in any way and that he loved them all - but obviously had some sort of mental block going among them with nothing more than a camera. He had to be mentally ill not to know that his demise would certainly come if he continuously pestered these animals without any armed protection. If he was not suffering from some type of mental illness, then he was a damn fool for doing what he did.

I seen nothing in the documentary that made me understand the wild Grizzly any better other than they are a force of nature not to be reckoned with. They are best left alone in their environment because they will, at their leisure, hunt and devour you.

Most of the film footage was of poor quality. I give it 3 Stars ""It's okay"" only because it may instill in others not to undertake such foolish acts.",1370390400,,2022,4.42741935483871

He and his girlfriend eventually got eaten alive by a grizzly bear.

He shot over 100 hours of footage during his dangerous expeditions.  His footage is among the best ever for grizzly bears, but was it worth it?  Absolutely not.  If I were him I'd wear a powered mech suit to take that footage, I certainly wouldn't have risked my life.

This documentary covers a lot about his life, from his childhood all the way to his death.  It even includes footage of the bear that killed him, and a detailed description of the audio that was recorded during the attack.  Unfortunately it doesn't tell us much about his girlfriend who also died in that attack.

The way this guy got so close to the grizzly bears reminds me a lot of Steve Irwin, the Australian who got killed because he got too close to a dangerous animal (in his case a stingray, but he had many close calls with crocodiles).

If they gave us more information on his girlfriend, given us a clue as to why she would choose to risk her life for him, I would give this documentary a higher rating.

2427433,4,B000BMY2NS,"After viewing GRIZZLY MAN, I am left with a haunting sense of perplexity that such a scenario was ever allowed to unfold.

From a superficial and nave perspective, Timothy Treadwell is perceived as an environmental hero who dedicated the last years of his life to filming Alaskan brown bears up-close in the Katmai nature preserve, and educating the public about these amazing creatures.
Admittedly, Treadwell had a propensity for cinematography, and he managed to capture some incredible moments on film. (His footage of two alpha male grizzlies fighting for mating rights is, perhaps, the best footage of this kind that I have ever seen).
However, as we learn more about Timothy Treadwell and the tragedy that took place in October 2003, legitimate questions are raised concerning the appropriateness of his activities in the nature preserve.  Additionally, I would argue that mass media outlets (e.g.,The Late Show with David Letterman, The Rosie O' Donnell Show, Dateline NBC, People magazine, et al), and the National Park Service, were also culpable in this avoidable tragedy - the former via rewarding Treadwell with national exposure for his reckless behavior, the latter through largely turning a blind eye to several years of wanton violation of park regulations by Treadwell.

Truth be told, Treadwell was a ""damaged"" individual; he was a college drop out and a failed actor, he was socially awkward with women, and he struggled with alcohol and drug addiction.  During a nadir in his life, Treadwell made a capricious motorcycle trip up to the Katmai nature preserve in Alaska where, as explained by his ex-girlfriend Jewel Palovak, he had a kind of ""religious"" experience in the bear sanctuary; he subsequently gave up alcohol and narcotics, and found his calling as an ""eco-warrior"" for the bears.

While I do not doubt that Treadwell believed that he had good intentions, in reality it seems that his experience in the nature preserve was more about his own self aggrandizement than the bears and foxes for whom he expressed his unfettered love and allegiance.

In GRIZZLY MAN, director Werner Herzog presents highlights from the 100+ hours of footage that was meticulously shot by Treadwell, (the majority of which includes Treadwell giving narration in the foreground).  It is here that we see Treadwell reviving his role as an actor, and wearing multiple bandannas, hats, sunglasses, etc., to create a specific ""look"" for the camera.
It is also through this footage that we see Treadwell's bizarre, childlike behavior toward the animals, attempting to treat them as if they were domesticated pets; on multiple occasions we see him petting foxes as if they were house cats, invading the personal space of the bears and touching them, speaking to the animals in a falsetto voice, telling them that he loves them, personifying them with individual names, etc.

While some of this behavior on the part of Treadwell does result in rather amazing film footage, the fact remains that habituating these wild animals to such direct human contact is detrimental to the natural instincts of these animals.  (One of Treadell's exaggerated and paranoid delusions was that he needed to protect the animals from the ever-present danger of poaching; if there actually had been a poaching issue [which in reality was almost non-existent in the Katmai nature preserve], Treadwell's ""Doolittle-esce"" behavior toward the animals would have only served to facilitate such an issue).

Herzog underscores the aforementioned sentiment in his documentary through his interview with Alutiiq Museum Director Sven Haakanson Jr.

Haakanson, an Aleutian native, states that Treadwell's obtrusive interaction with the bears was in contrast with an indigenous/naturalist perspective of proper comportment.  As state by Haakanson, ""[Treadwell] tried to be a bear.  He tried to act like a bear, and for us on the island, you don't do that.  You don't invade on their territory... [W]hen you habituate bears to humans, they think that all humans are safe... If I look at it from my culture, Timothy Treadwell crossed a boundary that we have lived with for 7000 years.  It's an unspoken boundary, an unknown boundary.  But when we know we've crossed it, we pay the price.""

Additionally, through segments of Herzog's interview with Jewel Palovak, we come to understand that Treadwell suffered from extreme emotional swings for which he had been prescribed anti-depression medication. However, Treadwell eventually stopped taking his medication because, as stated by Palovak, ""he said 'I had to stop... I can't have the middle grounds.  I have to have the highs and the lows.  It's part of my life, it's part of my personality.'""  These ""highs and lows"" are overtly recorded in Treadwell's film footage.  We witness a spectrum of emotions on the part of Treadwell, ranging from childlike, playful ecstasy with foxes, to vitriolic, profane tirades against the National Park Service; it is clear that Treadwell had unchecked, emotional issues that, at times, may have clouded his sense of rational thinking.

It is also noteworthy to point out how much Treadwell seemed to relish in continually mentioning (rather graphically) the extreme dangerousness of his activities in the bear preserve; for all intents and purposes, he seemed to replace one dangerous, thrill seeking activity (i.e., alcohol and heroin addiction) with another that was exponentially suicidal.  While not explicitly stating that Treadwell intended to be killed by bears in the preserve, Herzog highlights a couple of moments that make this a plausible assertion:  The first, being a letter written by Treadwell to an ecologist friend, indicating that his work would be taken more seriously if he was killed.  The second one being Treadwell's abrupt return in October 2003 to the nature preserve -- occuring after a dispute with an Alaskan airlines employee regarding the validity of his return ticket to California.  After 13 seasons in the sanctuary, Treadwell (who normally did not camp in Katmai into October) was fully aware that this was the most dangerous period of time to interact with bears in the preserve.  In one of the final film segments made by Treadwell before his death,  he introduces us to a heretofore unknown bear that he has named ""Ollie"".  By Treadwell's account, Ollie is an older, underfed, and aggressive bear that he has just met within the last couple of days.  Moreover, he further asserts that while the majority of the bears with which he has a rapport have already left the area to go into hibernation, Ollie is still desperately searching for food.  Treadwell, in an almost nonchalant tone, explains that this is a very dangerous scenario in which a bear may be tempted to attack a human being.  In what would be a haunting harbinger of things to come, Treadwell says to the camera, ""Could Ollie, the big old bear, possibly kill and eat Timothy Treadwell? ... I think if you are weak around him, you're going to go down his gullet.""

The most shameful part of this tragedy was the fact that Treadwell allowed his then girlfriend, Amie Huguenard, to be with him on his reckless endeavor; it was inexcusable on the part of Treadwell to allow anyone to join him in his madness and, at this point, there should have been an intervention.  Unfortunately, Huguenard placed her trust into the fallacy that Treadwell knew what the was doing, and this mistake let to her demise.
Interestingly, Tredwell's camera recorded 6 minutes of audio-only footage of the fatal bear attack.  Although the recording is not played for the viewing audience, we are given details of the recording via an interview with the coroner who performed the autopsies on Treadwell and Huguenard.  In a later segment of the film, we also watch as director Herzog listens to the death recording through headphones.  By all accounts, this is a nightmarish recording that will never be released to the general public.  I respect the decision not to release the recording.  However, I fully admit that there is a tiny, macabre corner of my mind that wants to listen to it.

So, in recap... Timothy Treadwell - a man who lacked any formal ecological training, who struggled with alcohol and substance abuse issues, who (in all likelihood) suffered from bipolar disorder, and who violated national park regulations with impunity - was unable to perceive any sense of impropriety vis-a-vis his obtrusive behavior, for 13 seasons, in the bear sanctuary at Katmai national park.  Yet, as shown in his film footage, this did not stop Treadwell from irrationally demonizing tourists, and other visitors, who occasionally came to the Katmai preserve.  As stated by Herzog, ""for Treadwell, they were just intruders.  An encroaching threat upon what he considered his Eden.""
However, true to form for the mass media, shows such as Dateline NBC, and The Late Show with David Lettterman invited Treadwell onto their shows as a novelity interest piece... never actually exploring the possibility that they were exploiting and exacerbating a potentially horrible situation.  It is important to note that, at the behest of Letterman, a segment of his interview with Tredwell, that had been included in the theatrical release of GRIZZLY MAN, was omitted from the DVD version the film. In the omitted segment, Letterman asked Treadwell the (now prophetic) question, ""is it going to happen that we read a news item one day that you have been eaten by one of these bears?""  According to the IMDb FAQ page for GRIZZLY MAN, Letterman believed that it was inappropriate to utilize the segment of his comedic interview in the context of a film about Treadwell's horrific demise.  However, I tend to wonder if Letterman was making a calculated decision to distance himself from what could properly be perceived as a serious faux pas for being directly involved with raising Treadwell to celebrity status which, in turn, emboldened Treadwell in his fatally misguided activities.
Moreover, it would seem that Treadwell's rising celebrity status may have played a role in the hesitancy on the part of the National Park Service to fully enforce regulations that he was blatantly disregarding.  According to Herzog, several reasonable regulations (e.g., minimum distances to be kept between animals and people, permanent camping restrictions, et al) were, despite warnings, being violated annually by Treadwell.  Had they wanted to, the Park Service probably could have banned Treadwell from the park, (long before the tragedy took place), and subsequently have him arrested for trespassing if he did not comply with the ban.  Worst case scenario, they could even have tracked and stopped him at the airport - not even letting him get anywhere near the bear sanctuary; had these measures been put into effect, Treadwell, Huguenard, and two bears (involved in the deaths, and subsequently shot by the Park Service) would most likely still be alive today.

GRIZZLY MAN is an intriguing documentary.  Beyond the tragedy of Timothy Treadwell and Amie Huguenard, the film has opened my mind to ethical questions associated with the ""extreme wildlife footage"" that has been popularized over the last 25 years, and the role of the mass media that has propagated this form of entertainment.

The director's nihilistic narration is in stark contrast to Treadwell's giddy naivete. The movie escalates into a surreal fanaticism that probes Treadwell's mental instability, terrible judgement, and wild crusade that culminates in two pointless fatalities.

2427462,5,B000BMY2NS,"Werner Herzog's 2005 documentary ""Grizzly Man"" was such a disturbing experience, I continued thinking about it for days afterward. The work details Timothy Treadwell, an amateur naturalist who filmed 100 hours of video as he camped with grizzlies in Alaska's Katmai National Park. The jarring contrasts are many. Treadwell speaks to the bears like pets followed by his uncomfortably close footage of grizzlies viciously fighting. Treadwell's tearful fantasies about the beauty of the wilds are accented by Herzog's theories on nature's ugly chaos. Most troubling, Treadwell's belief that he is a grizzly protector -- a bear whisperer if you will -- to the final day when he's killed and eaten by the animals.

""Grizzly Man"" details early on the tragedy of Treadwell and girlfriend Amie Huguenard being killed by the bears (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Grizzly-Maze-Timothy-Treadwell-s-Fatal-Obsession-with-Alaskan-Bears/dp/0452287359/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Grizzly Maze: Timothy Treadwell's Fatal Obsession with Alaskan Bears</a>). They stayed in Alaska too long in October of 2003 when grizzlies were intensely feeding in preparation for the coming winter. Treadwell camped in what he termed the ""grizzly maze,"" an ominous brushy locale where bears traveled to hibernate. The remainder of the documentary, shaded by these deaths, details Treadwell's life leading up to his fateful decision to live with Alaskan bears over 13 summers. There's something bordering on the occult in the final hours of Treadwell's footage, as if he knew what was to happen and seemed giddy about such an occurrence.

I can't think of a better filmmaker than Herzog to document this intimate disaster. Here's a man driven by dangerous obsessions in a spectacular career spent, more often than not, in the wilderness forging&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aguirre-the-Wrath-of-God/dp/6305972761/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aguirre, the Wrath of God</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fitzcarraldo/dp/B00001ODHV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fitzcarraldo</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cobra-Verde/dp/6305972796/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cobra Verde</a>&nbsp;while battling the madness of Klaus Kinski.

If you've hiked alone in the wilderness for days without seeing a human soul, there's an intoxicating beauty as you confront the belief the world is yours. The overwhelming euphoria is addictive. Author Jon Krakauer has documented such madness in his classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Into-the-Wild/dp/0307387178/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Into the Wild</a>&nbsp;(made into the fine film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Into-the-Wild/dp/B0012FHGCW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Into the Wild</a>&nbsp;by Sean Penn). But Krakauer's work is more than the story of Christopher McCandless, who hiked into remote Alaska and starved to death. He devotes passages to similar historic souls who became obsessed with desolation, traipsing into the wilds to disappear forever. Perhaps these reclusive explorers fell into a crevasse and died, but they suffered from similar ailments in that, the Gothic beauty of nature can alter the reality of the most invincible urban man.

Okay, I've taken the long way around the grizzly maze to say I related to Treadwell's madness, though have never remotely considered a quest near the realm of a grizzly. Treadwell, raised in New York, came to love camping in areas only accessible by plane. Like many, he had great difficulty relating to the dull hum of civilization and found peace in the wilderness. But such a quest can be deadly. What did Treadwell see in the bears? Certainly a deluded kinship, akin to well-documented explorers communing with gorillas, whales and dolphins. But those mammals do not eat people. For Treadwell to live with creatures who kill their cubs when hungry is the ultimate naivete.

Herzog provides excellent interviews with Treadwell's family and friends, disturbed by his demise. We learn he was a failed actor suffering from manic depression, who began to abuse drugs and alcohol. And then the bears became his savior. Alaskan rangers and natives are also given time, stating emphatically he crossed a line and was lucky to live as long as he did. Treadwell's footage is a marvel as grizzlies race across the horizon. He befriends a family of foxes and they chase him through a meadow. There's extraordinary scenes in his tent trapped by a rainstorm and you feel as if you are camping with him.

I would have liked more detail on how Treadwell evolved into this doomed figure. When did he first see a bear and what led him to Alaska? By the conclusion, Treadwell believes he's being harassed by the rangers and a flood of rage pours out before the camera. It's apparent he views himself as an immune larger-than-life figure, a ""gentle warrior."" Treadwell staked out this dangerous corner of the world and fully expected to achieve fame from his communion.

As Herzog well knows, humanity's evolution is unique in that we have an ability to see beauty amidst enormous chaos. Treadwell, without protection, chose to live within brutal indifference, emboldened by illogical beliefs akin to religion. There's arrogance in such a quest, but also purity. An unlikely example of both, Treadwell held on to his faith to the end, and painful death came to him. To date, Treadwell and his girlfriend are the only humans ever killed by grizzlies in Alaska's Katmai National Park.

2427463,5,B000BMY2NS,"For one thing, ""Grizzly Man"" is (unintentionally) ironic if not outright funny in the almost self-parodying contrast between its director's bleak, European-style cynicism and its eponymous subject's manic, animistic idealism, as epitomized in the screen-filling closeup of the bear's (possibly the ""murderer's"") face, over which Herzog's VO says that he himself can discern in it nothing apart from the mindless cruelty of nature and a ""vague interest in food"".

Other scenes in which ""Grizzly Man"", were it not a true documentary, might almost be mistaken for a ""Best of Show"" type mock-umentary included the interview with Treadwell's parents; the friend who reads aloud a letter from a caustic right-winger expressing a wish that the ranks of liberals like Treadwell could be further thinned by releasing grizzly bears on the Berkley campus, and, of course, Treadwell's own monologs, like the one in which he anthropomorphizes the combatants in a mating battle between two male bears in a way that would make a Disney scenarist blush.

And yet, of all the interviews that seemed conjured to fit Herzog's thirst for the grotesque, the most indelible was with the coroner who conducted the autopsies of Treadwell and his girlfriend: his quirky, disjointed voice and gestures (which one can't help suspecting may be attributable to too many years in his profession) would have been, but for the grim context, hilarious. Yet his words, and his obvious sympathy for the victims, made him perhaps the most compassionate character in the film.

Finally, there's this: while it was unconscionable for Treadwell to have put the girl in that hideously perilous predicament, the way they both met their deaths offers some cause for admiration, not only regarding Treadwell and her, but by extension, the whole confused species to which they belonged.

The audio tape clearly revealed that, in his final agony, Treadwell had every reason to beg the girl for help, and that she had equally good reason to try to flee the horrific scene. But neither of them behaved that way. Instead, he begged her to save herself, and she died trying to save him.

However respectively weird and naive the pair may have been, they finally (evoking Emerson's ideas on Man's place in Nature) helped to legitimize mankind's claim to the top spot in the terrestrial pecking order: for in addition to their presumably higher intelligence, they had courage at least equal to their bestial adversary's: In the end they proved themselves, in a way that would've made Faulkner proud, as brave as any bear.

While I'm aligned with those in the 'favorable' camp, two things I feel strongly, that no one else has seemed to mention. One, I do believe that Mr. Treadwell did have a relationship with some of those bears, or he would most certainly not have survived as long as he did. Even the most carnivorous of beasts (including man) can have heart. He was killed by a strange bear, one that he had not seen in a prior year. I watched the scenes of him walking with his back turned on two giant grizzlies strolling behind him and thought, my god, what a brave man. Which brings me to my second point. Every one of us sitting in our beds or at our desks writing these reviews--what have we done that is remotely comparable to spending 13 summers among wild beasts, unarmed, and mostly alone? I am in awe. Sure he was mentally unstable. Who isn't? But instead of medicating himself, numbing himself with TV and pharmaceuticals, he chose to breathe in Life. The man in the documentary who said ""he got what he deserved"" is just an evil, nasty, spiteful little man who can't imagine thinking outside the box, and therefore, anyone who does is a loony.

Werner Herzog is in stellar form in the telling of the story through film.

Even more interesting than Grizzly Man the movie is the documentary of the making of the musical soundtrack included with it. Created by Richard Thompson, with Werner giving him cues, but ultimately letting him do what he does best, the studio footage of creating the soundtrack is just as exciting and even more interesting than the movie to me. Probably partly because I'm a musician/producer/engineer myself, but also because the essence of the music creation is captured so well in the filming of it, and the music they created in the moment is just gorgeous.

With hundreds of hours of footage shot by Treadwell himself, in addition to the wide variety of interviews, I don't understand why this director decided to narrate over 75% of the film. Maybe he just liked the sound of his own voice.

Worst of all was the scene around 50 minutes in where the coroner describes the state of the remains he received and what he examined. I honestly wonder if the coroner was as mentally diluted as Treadwell. The man seems to almost relish in the gore while he overacts throughout the entire scene. The good doctor clearly thought this film was all about himself, rather than the victims he examined.

2427474,4,B000BMY2NS,"""Love that is not madness is not love.""
 -Pedro Calderon de la Barca

 After watching Werner Herzog's ""Grizzly Man,"" I knew two things to be true: 1) Timothy Treadwell was mentally ill. And 2) this didn't bother me. While there is not doubt most viewers will come to conclusion one without much convincing, it's how the viewer processes this fact is what leads to a conclusion two, one that will either make or break the film.
 Don't be deceived by the movie's cover; this film is not about bears.  It is a story about Timothy Treadwell, bear enthusiast and self-proclaimed bear protector. But in the few first minutes, our ""hero"" is dead. Treadwell's life ends by the paws of the very creatures he tried to protect, a plot line fit for the worst of Greek tragedies. But Herzog, perpetually direct, told us what would classically be viewed as the end of the story first for a reason. Treadwell's life and death are aspects of an even bigger story. Those excited to learn more about these wild creatures through Treadwell's footage will be disappointed; Herzog is controlling the reins.  He went through this Treadwell's footage, and shows us what he wants us to see.  Because what's important to understand about this documentary, like every documentary, is that we're looking at the world through the director's eyes. In Herzog's eyes, Treadwell is more than a bear enthusiast, and even more than  a crazy wanna-be Animal Planet star. He's a filmmaker; a passionate artist wrapped up in his work. Herzog measures Treadwell's worth not in what he was passionate about, but in the amount of passion he projects.
  It's too easy to get turned off by Treadwell's voice, his mannerisms and what he does for a living. It's different than what you're used to. A person's not supposed to go drop everything and live with bears, talking to himself on camera --it's absurd!  Only a crazy person does that! But as someone who knows many beautiful, creative people with diagnosed mental illnesses, it's easier to appreciate this kind of madness. A person going off the beaten track sees the world in a different perspective, and we can learn a lot from that. As a viewer, if you can't get past he is probably ""crazy,"" it's really you're loss. If anything, he makes a good story, which in a world of so much normal is hard to pull off.
 It's also too easy to see the film as nothing more than it's parts, which include clips from Treadwell's own footage, horrible reenactments, and interviews that make you feel like you're watching The Twilight Zone.  But if you step out of that mindset and let Herzog's accent take you along for the ride, you might notice something more. Like the beautiful footage of a fox pup's shadow, as he presses his paws against the top of the tent. Or when Treadwell mourns the death of a little bee, who dies on a flower while collecting pollen. This breaks Timothy's heart, so he films it and says, ""The bumblebee expired while working...I love that bee."" The metaphor is painfully obvious. And then another moment, my favorite moment, was when Timothy's ""platonic"" friend spoke about Timothy right before he would leave on his adventures. Without fail he would turn to her and say, ""I love you. This is going to be the best day of my life. And if I don't come back, it's what I want."" Look out for these moments, and appreciate them for their idiosyncrasies and almost childish wonder.
 Overall, I enjoyed the film immensely. I loved how it focused Treadwell's life, not necessarily his tragedy. It took footage not meant for analysis or dissection, and made it mean so much more.  Treadwell's project on his own could be interpreted millions ways. There were moments I was confused by the strange interviews and painfully obvious reenactments, but they made me think. I left the film wondering about the nature of mental illness, and the beautiful naivity of following your dreams no matter what anyone thinks of whatever what society and logic tell you you should live your life. I too hope one day to find something I'm as passionate about.",1352678400,,4062,4.73371104815864
2427475,5,B000BMY2NS,"I've read a number of reviews here that fall along the lines of, ""Timothy Treadwell was really stupid and should have gotten eaten by bears."" If that's your takeaway after seeing the movie, then you have surely missed the point. In fact, one of the people in the film makes this same remark very early on. There's still an entire movie to watch!

Werner Herzog's goal is not to make a judgement on what happened, but to paint the picture sensitively, and from all sides. And a complex picture it is! He isn't asking anyone to celebrate a person's lapses in judgement, but to celebrate in life. This is NOT a documentary about bears.

His work with children and his love for nature is highly admirable... but he definitely was losing grip with reality.  And unfortunately, got exactly what he was asking for.  I definitely hold a lot of respect for his feelings about these animals and nature in general.. his love of the bears was heart warming... I wish everyone loved nature as much as him.

2427478,2,B000BMY2NS,"This movie tells the tale of Timothy Treadwell which of course isn't his real name.  He goes to live with grizzlys because I guess he thinks he's a grizzly or whatever. I know I'm being harsh, he says he is protecting the Grizzlys, and since he isn't he probably thought he could befriend them or he was invincible.

He ignores warnings that grizzlys are wild animals and he could get killed and deludes himself into thinking that he can live with grizzlys because he is special.

He gets on TV and tells kids a bunch of untrue things that could get them killed and everyone thinks he's amazing for acting stupid.

I could forgive him for all this but he also insists on bring his girlfriend into all this mess.

Of course he ends up getting himself and her killed and eaten in horrendous fashion which is not the slightest bit unexpected.  I mean really, he wasn't a hero, he was foolish and selfish for dragging his girlfriend into a very dangerous situation.  Or maybe he was delusional.

In any case, he shouldn't be celebrated but you can learn something from his story that you already knew.  Stay away from Grizzly bears, they can kill you very easily and will do so if they are hungry or think you are infringing on their territory or threatening their young.

When you travel in bear country bring bear spray and a decent caliber gun.  If you don't own an appropriate gun, at least bring bear spray.  Timothy initially carried bear spray and if he had continued to carry bear spray he might still be alive.",1347494400,3,1515,4.509157509157509
2427479,5,B000BMY2NS,"I think you should watch this movie if you want to learn more about how a human can mistakenly perceive nature as a salvation when he/she is very troubled. This story is about how one individual is seeking a place in the world and finds it by assigning human characteristics to wild animals. It is an excellent film. Herzog (the director) does an great job of neither condemning nor praising the subject of his film. It is nuanced and there are times where he speaks highly of his subject and times when he points out how dead wrong the subject really was.

I am torn about his recommendation to advise that the owner of the tape of the bear attack destroy the tape. On one hand he should be applauded for what he suggests to the distraught friend of the subject of the film. On the other, I feel like the tape itself and the contents could have very clearly shown how divorced from reality this man had become. In addition, I think it would have provided a stark contrast to the playful and seemingly harmless visuals of the wild animals that are portrayed by the video throughout most of the movie (The only scene that showed the ferocity of the bears was the fight between to the two males for mating rights to a female). While personally it was tough to watch the coroner talk about the last moments of the characters life, and I think I would not have been able to listen to the audio of the attack. I think it would have provided the contrast needed to make Herzog's point.

There is a point in the film when the curator of the museum makes the point that the native people of the land have lived for thousands of years respecting the bears and keeping a safe distance. I think that statement is the real take-away from this film.",1346544000,2,1736,4.388198757763975

I suspect he was suffering from severe depression; his treatment (living among bears in the wild) changed his addictions (marijuana, alcohol, etc.) to an addition to epinephrine--much like the sky-diver.  He was able to obtain a natural high, living on his own, among danger and being delusioned he was safe.

He wasn't safe.  Never was.  This is no different a story than a ""pet"" Shamu whale turning on its trainer.  Same thing.

The only difference:  We got this on film.  Our Grizzly man needed profound help.  To me, this documentary represents a failure of our mental health system, how they failed a severely depressed man, with addictions, and let him get eaten by bears.

What is the role (or importance) of personal choice in taking such risks?  What were the real consequences of Tim's actions - not only for himself, or his girlfriend (who, i'm pretty sure, was old enough to make her own choices, including remaining at the airport), but the bears, the wild sanctuaries, and the lifestyle that Tim led, the values underlying those choices and their consequences?  I think the film maker does a great job exploring Tim's persona and the mark he left in the world in a very balanced, non-prejudicial way in spite of the fact that he obviously held respect for this young man.  The funniest moment in the film for me was listening to one of the Treadwell detractors who obviously had no single piece of information about the young man or what he'd been doing other than his name and his proximity to wildlife.  Timothy was obviously, like us all, a deeply human, simultaneously flawed, insecure, egotistical, emotional, insightful, creative, tender soul who felt lost in the company of human and found a real, if not always correct, connection to the wild souls he spent so many years studying and clearly identifying with.  I think he was trying to be responsible in warning people that what he was doing WAS dangerous; i think he was aware of it; i think he may have had both a grandiose side, and a self-destructive vent.  He appears to have been a young man with many demons.  He may have been bipolar, experiencing cycling mania and depression.  Personally, I found more kinship with him, than not.  It's easy to see others and believe we are the ones with 20-20 vision, harder to turn those lens on ourselves and come to any real reckoning.  I respect Tim for what he wanted, I understand Tim's sense of alienation because I share it, I empathize with his pain, and I honor his choices even as I acknowledge he probably did do harm as well as good for his subjects.  Personally, I would rather be eaten by  a bear than die in some freeway accident or on the operating table, or slowly eaten away by some cancer.  Maybe i'll get lucky and die a quiet death surrounded by loved ones, but I know if i do, i'll be in the minority of Americans.  He had the guts to go out and follow his dreams, and I'm happy to say it's because of people like him, and because he was both brave and proud and delusional and childlike and loving and selfish and human, and therefore like me, I'm going to go out and follow mine.

I did not think him crazy or irrational but I did feel like I was watching an episode of Captain Kangaroo and as the film progressed, the Captain on drugs.

The interviews with Jewel and the coroner were just as disturbing as the story itself as they both seemed like scenes from a bad soap opera.

I wish the film maker had given Treadwell's mental and life history earlier in the movie as I spend much of the first half hour thinking, ""Is this man serious?  What is wrong with him?  Why hasn't anyone tried to get him some help?""  Clearly his friends and family saw his mental instability.  It's so sad his life had to end so tragically and another human being lost her life as well.

2427495,4,B000BMY2NS,"Werner Herzog was given a strange mission with the film, ""Grizzly Man."" How do you take 100's of hours of tape made by a delusional, self-centered and mentally imbalanced man who is ultimately killed (along with the poor woman he drags along after him) by his obsession with Alaskan Grizzlies and make him someone somewhat sympathetic? The documentary manages to do just that, with Herzog inserting himslef as a conscience/narrator into the tapes of naturalist and self-described ""kind warrior"" Timothy Treadwell. For over a decade of summers, Treadwell would haul himself to Alaska, embed himself in a State Park and try to become one with the grizzlies.

Yes, you're right...anyone with a lick of sense would see this as a fool's errand, and the movie doesn't even bother to hide that fact by mentioning at the beginning that Treadwell and lady friend Amie Huguenard become lunch for a ""bear full of people and clothes."" Treadwell fails to recognize what Herzog knows by instinct and a few millenniums of evolution; nature is ""chaos, hostility, and murder."" Treadwell looks at nature as some sort of Disney-fied harmony, where if you just dance with the animals, they'll be your friends and all will live in the big unity of the universe. This despite ample evidence to the contrary (adult males eating cubs to foster mating with females, the killing of one of his fox pup 'friends'); Treadwell rails on about the bear world versus the people world.

Herzog keeps Treadwell from looking like a blithering idiot by balancing some of the most intimate footage you'll probably ever see of bears in the wild and commentary from both the friends and enemies of Treadwell, and ultimately sacrificing an opportunity to exploit Treadwell and Amie's death. A narcissist to the very end, Treadwell had a camera running even as he and Amie were being attacked and killed, and Herzog makes the decision to not include the audio (the lens cap was still on the camera) or include the pictures from the coronor, going as far as to implore one of Treadwell's few friends to destroy the final tape and never look back. It's Herzog's sense of compassion for his subject (aided by a terrific score by guitarist Richard Thompson), even as he understands the madness, that makes ""Grizzly Man"" so compelling.",1341273600,3,2288,4.924870466321243

Granted, Irwin was more grounded in reality, and his death really is more closely deemed 'accident', but the sheer joy is what's the same. Treadwell is not a statement as people make him out to be, so much as he his the embodiment of childlike play, where your parents were counted on to protect you. Here, with no parents around, his fantasy that he is on equal footing with these animals is a clearly risky one.

Some of his genius was the ability to assimilate, and communicate on a fundamental level with these animals, in terms of space, and personal boundaries, and yes respect. He demonstrates the principle of Requisite Variety - his ability to vary his responses (tone of voice, gestures) beyond the range of those the bear could express, as a way to control the system of him+bear. He had tremendous empathy - he understood what would be and not be a threat, what would be and not be a challenge. He danced the bears.

But have you never met people who related to animals better than people? The type who are into animal rights but think the human race is a black hole of worthlessness (which is sometimes true)? I have known several people like that. Look at the average PETA campaign that will equate a human homicide with eating a chicken sandwich.

And it's not as if Herzog has not documented madness before (""My Best Fiend"", about Kinski)

What is great about this portrait is that Treadwell is the perfect embodiment of that personality; the childlike person who was hurt by people and disillusioned by society and thinks that the animal world is ""Pure""-- a common romantic delusion that ignores the brutality of the food chain and the lesser known & lesser docmented facts of bizarre animal behavior (infanticide, eating the young, necrophilia--even one breed of male bears will kill the young to provoke females into mating again). So the futility of those romantic notions are really laid bare (inevitable unintentional pun) here. The world is a very dark and cruel place no matter how far away you try to get from society. And when you hear of Native American response to his acts (they basically say, you respect the animal, you respect the power of death, you don't mess with it), you can really see how this is sort of a Western White People's thing- to romanticize the 'primitive', like it's some Garden of Eden that holds no evil in it.

Treadwell's obsession gets to the inexcusable point when he entraps a girlfriend into his deathwish. You really lose sympathy for him. You see his pathologically childish selfishness.

2427502,3,B000BMY2NS,"This was a rather disturbing, but fascinating portrait of one man's obsession.  What that obsession might be is the real question raised by this movie.  Was it really as much about the animals as it was about his trying to find a unique role for himself?  I agree that he was not likely made wealthy by his ventures and many good works have been done for actually selfish interests.  If I'm poor and someone feeds me, do I care that the person is helping due to selfish or selfless reasons?  Of course not, I'll judge the deed on what good happened.

That said, I don't know if Treadwell did do any good here.  I found the museum curator (Native American) very credible when he noted that Treadwell more likely did harm than good by making animals believe that they could get close to humans.  I'm sure that would make the job of a poacher of fax fur much easier that Treadwell trained the fox and cubs to approach at least a human.  The movie does make clear, and his family seems to agree, that the guy was deeply disturbed.  He even tried to change his voice to sound more of an authentic outdoorsman.  He also falsely portrayed himself as venturing on all of these trips by himself.  In fact, he had company for at least several of his trips.  The movie does not clearly state how many.  I think that he suffered from Bipolar disorder accompanied by delusions of grandeur.  He would have made for an interesting clinical discussion.

As for the movie, my only problem is with Herzog telling the owner of the ""death tape"" (yes the guy dies, that is not a spoiler to the movie, it is stated at the very beginning); he tells her to destroy the tape!  Really that is what a documentarian does with unique evidence--destroy it?!!  This is where Herzog erred in this movie.  He became too involved and placed himself as a character in the movie.  I'll give it 3 stars since I do recommend it, but fewer than I would have because of the above concerns.",1337990400,2,1949,4.436619718309859
2427503,2,B000BMY2NS,This movie was hard to watch. It was a sad commentary on Tim's life and how far from society he removed himself. Some of the footage of the bears was great. I enjoyed the Alaskan scenery but the great shots were far and few between. The interviews were over acted it seemed like and hard to watch. I couldn't watch the whole thing (I skipped a few interviews) but kept watching in horror because the story was just so sad.,1337817600,,422,4.2875
2427504,5,B000BMY2NS,"Grizzly man is a first-hand account spanning several expeditions in the wilds of a Alaska by a man named Timothy Treadwell. Treadwell is about as eccentric as anyone you'll ever see, real or fictional. After overcoming substance abuse due to some sort of mutual agreement reached between him and the bears of Alaska, Treadwell begins to develop weird feelings of kinship with the bears. He begins to see himself as the protector of the bears, and is so overcome with feelings of love and affection for the bears that he comes across as hysterical. The bears in this film often approach Treadwell, and in some cases threaten to charge, but Treadwell simply stands his ground simply telling the bears ""no"" and ""don't you do that"" much in the way a parent would correct a small child. This tactic worked for more than a decade, which probably only served to reinforce Treadwell's feeling of kinship with the bears. Speaking of which, Treadwell spoke to the bears in an almost baby-like voice. (the sorta voice people use when talking to their pets). When Treadwell did it, however, it was very unsettling. Perhaps because he was speaking to a creature capable of ripping him to shreds with minimal effort as if it were a poodle.

The real tragedy of the story is two-fold. For one, I agree with one of the film's commentators that Treadwell did more harm than good in that he habitualized himself with the bears. The more familiar the bears became with him, the more inclined they would be to do the same with other humans, which is a scenario that will ultimately harm the bears more than anything. Second, it's incredibly sad that he would bring another person along with him during these expeditions. If you want to risk your life in order to fulfill some eccentric desire to be one with the bears, that's fine. But risking another person's life is despicable.

All in all, the film was one of the better documentaries I've ever seen. Most of the film consists of footage shot by Treadwell himself, although we are occasionally given testimony from his friends and family about the man. If there's any lesson to be learned here it's that bears are wild animals incapable of possessing a kindred bond with humans. Again, a great documentary and a good way to spend a few hours if you're bored.",1337040000,,2292,4.713216957605985

Given that some of the screen sequences he took with his hand held camera are remarkable, his narration of same was limited. In fact if you removed all versions of the ""f"" word from his vocabulary, the Alaskan portion would be improved, but shorten considerably.

I love animals, wild and domestic, but I have the common sense to know my boundaries with them, you do not mess with wild bears, you leave them alone. The Fox can become like a domesticated dog, he had to be feeding it or something because they don't just hang around because they love you, but they can give you companionship like a dog. All I can say is Timothy Treadmill was nuts and if he and his girlfriend did anything good for the wild bears it was providing them with extra nurishment before the winter set in, The fox probably came bck also and got a snack.

2427508,3,B000BMY2NS,"Grizzly Man is one of those movies that I'd heard a lot about over the years, but never watched because it just didn't sound that interesting to me until recently. A guy who, every year, would move out into the Alaskan wilderness by himself and document his life with bears...how was that different from any other nature show or movie that's been released? Well, just a few minutes into the movie, it became quite clear that Timothy Treadwell, wasn't your average host, or person for that matter. As we all know, Timothy was killed by a grizzly bear near the end of one of his trips, and while there's a lot to say about the guy and how he's presented in the footage that makes up Grizzly Man, I won't disrespect him by labeling him as crazy.

The movie is a collection of footage shot by Treadwell and interviews with people who were close to him, as well as those who had some kind of connection to Timothy's trips. Werner Herzog narrates now and then, with an unbiased view of everything that goes on in the footage. Most of what we get to see is Treadwell talking to the camera, going on about how much he loves the bears and being able to help them. There are many times when Timothy gets within a few feet of the larger bears, and several times when he pets or pokes the noses of younger ones. Where most camera men would simply use the zoom feature, Treadwell is right there with the bears, not showing any fear. He explains that he holds his ground to establish dominance and that it shows he isn't afraid of them, that he respects them. However you feel about this, you have to admit that it's crazy that he was able to do this for so long before being attacked and killed. It's hard to 'spoil' anything about the movie since it's a documentary, and we know the outcome, but there's a good of good stuff here mixed in with Treadwell going on about the usual bear love talk. Seeing foxes follow him around, stealing his hat and playing with his tent is some of the coolest footage of wild animals I've ever seen, as silly as it might sound.

Regarding how Timothy says he loves to help the bears...how he's helping them is beyond me. At one point, several men that Timothy claims are poachers, encounter one of the bears and throw rocks at it. Timothy is clearly disturbed by this and begins to cry, but never does anything to scare the men away or help the bear. What you'll notice in this scene is that the bear never does anything in defense. Did it get used to being around Timothy so much that it saw the other humans as non-threatening? At first it seemed like Timothy genuinely cared for the animals, but by the halfway point, I couldn't help but wonder if he was legitimately 'crazy'. He'd have mood swings, start cussing up a storm all of a sudden, and at one point, proclaims himself to be Allah's disciple. My jaw slowly dropped when I heard that one. When Timothy was around the bears or just walking around, he came off as a man-child and someone you couldn't help but feel sorry for in some sense. He seemed like a nice guy until the 'real' Timothy started to show. Then again, I don't think we ever got to see the real him in this documentary. How was he when he got back to the real world? THAT is something I thought about a lot when the movie was over.

Werner Herzog isn't a favorite director of mine, though I do enjoy his work. However I don't like how he handled some parts of the movie here. When Timothy was killed, the camera was on and recorded the audio of the fatal attack (with the lens cap still on though). Herzog listens to this with headphones right in front of Timothy's ex-girlfriend and longtime friend, Jewel Palovak. We don't hear anything, but Herzog seems unphased. He then tells Jewel that she must never, ever listen to the audio (she is in possession of the tape), and that she should destroy it. Why did he do this, and why is it included on the movie? It seemed sick to me, almost like he was tempting her to listen to it and capture her reaction. There's another scene with the coroner that examined what was left of Timothy, and when he's done talking, the camera slowly zooms out for a [long] few seconds while he stares at the camera the whole time. What was that? None of the other interviews end like this, so why the heck did he do it here?

When it comes down to it, I feel sort of bad about giving Grizzly Man 'just' 3 stars. But honestly, I don't know how to feel about the movie. If anything, it's more of a character study than showing how a guy lived around bears. You get to see how Timothy tried to make every shot perfect, and cut out his girlfriend Amy for some reason, making it seem like he was out there alone for the last couple of years he made the trips. If it weren't for Herzog and several others mentioning her, and showing very quick clips of her, you wouldn't know that Amy was with Timothy during the trip at all. I'm the kind of person who has been desensitized to weird and brutal things, but Grizzly Man managed to make me feel uncomfortable at times. It's definitely worth watching.",1335571200,4,5068,4.348468848996832
2427509,4,B000BMY2NS,"Fascinating look at Treadwell, thanks to his own half-baked but inspired footage in which he plays center stage.  Yes, he was obviously a narcissistic fool, but who else has even come close to this and lived 13 summers?  Who else would have had the guts to pop a surly grizzly on the nose and scold it, and then turn your back to it and continue talking to the camera?  This is impressive, and heck, even another grizzly might have only lasted that long. I for one trust the fox family's instincts -- they must have sensed something pure in Treadwell.  It is a little harsh to judge him by the footage, obviously much of it was just him acting for himself and never meant for the public.

Now, I found the film fascinating, and I thank Herzog for that, but ... I think this works only because Treadwell was already dead and so Herzog could not interview him.  Have you ever noticed how people perform like demented puppies for Herzog?  He must encourage them to bring on the weird for their minute of fame ultimately to reflect Herzog's own power.  But I loved the old Herzog.",1335052800,,1076,4.454081632653061
2427510,3,B000BMY2NS,"This documentary does help to show the uniqueness of Timothy Treadwell's personality, his combination of determined goodness, need for personal redemption, innocent vanity, and ""rambunctiousness."" He probably wouldn't have been able to do this if it weren't for all those traits. Treadwell recognizes the harshness of the natural world, but seems to think there is a kind of honesty or lack of malice in that harshness that makes it a much healthier environment to be in than human society could be. It is touching that the simplicity of his relationships with the animals is what allows him to love them in such an unrestrained way. In some ways, Herzog does justice to all this, though Herzog can be a bit condescending sometimes, as he is towards the end, when he suggests that Treadwell imagined he was seeing goodness and love in the animals he lived with, but was only projecting human nature onto them; the animals according to Herzog are simply lacking in thought or feeling. If that's true, then Treadwell really is a fool; on the other hand it's possible that Treadwell's commitment to being with these animals allowed him to appreciate something about them that we can't.
Herzog's interviews in the film can occasionally be uninspiring and a bit artificial-feeling (especially when discussing Treadwell's death with the latter's close friends). It feels as though Herzog is trying to be 'deep' while nevertheless trying to take advantage of the sensationalism of how they died.

Treadwell is a fascinating character, almost inhumanly naive and childish but also extremely knowledgable in the actions of wild animals and the demands of life in the wild. Ultimately he allows his passion to get in the way of good judgment, as he madly rails against new park regulations installing a hundred-yard cushion between man and bear just weeks before becoming grizzly food himself, but there are both positives and negatives to take away from the story. His interactions with wild foxes make for some charming, amazing asides, and the unique perspectives afforded by his lifestyle share an intimate peek into the tendencies and temperament of grizzlies at their least guarded.

2427536,5,B000BMY2NS,"Grizzly Man follows Timothy Treadwell in his attempt to escape civilization and inhabit a world with one of the most dangerous animals on the planet - the Alaskan Kodiak. Treadwell, who sees himself as a misunderstood ""kind warrior"", shunned by mainstream society, escapes urban LA every summer and journeys to the Alaskan wilderness. However, as we quickly learn, Treadwell may have other motives for his annual journey besides protecting these majestic creatures. Werner Herzog, with his enlightening and intelligent narration, is your guide as you watch his main character descend into madness. Herzog accurately portrays Treadwell as an ego-maniac, confused by his sexuality, and misguided by mental instability. As one reviewer accurately put it, Treadwell is, ""a whack job loser, self-proclaimed warrior for the bears, [who spends most of his time] worrying about how his hair looks or what hanky to wear in a shot..."" Treadwell's attempt to convince his audience to understand the Kodiak parallels his own attempt to understand himself. He persuades himself that the bears, like him, are victims of the evils of society and envisions himself as their only savior. Treadwell, deluded by this fantasy, mis-judges the true nature of these wild animals. He and his companion ultimately suffer a horrible fate.

2427537,4,B000BMY2NS,"I first watched this film in 2006 shortly after it was released on DVD. I had seen Timothy Treadwell on David Letterman, knew of his violent death by grizzly, and was curious. I was drawn to his story by the irony surrounding his death... a man who gave up so much of his life in pursuit of a spiritual connection with one of nature's most fearsome predators, only to have his life taken by those same creatures. It was too much like a Greek tragedy to overlook.

I am embarrased to admit that on my first viewing I laughed. A lot.

The film was well directed and edited and had a great soundtrack, but I honestly wasn't sure if striking a comedic note was not Werner Herzog's real intent. The true-life supporting cast were not unlike the characters who ambled in and out of Bob Newhart's ""Stratford Inn"". And nearly all of Treadwell's self-portrait footage was so outrageous and far over the top that if I didn't know it was a true biographical account of a unique life and death, I would just as easily believed Grizzly Man to be a mockumentary of the oft-pilloried ""Berkeley crowd"" of left-leaning environmentalists/conservationists.

Then I watched it again.

Before long, I was purchasing copies of the DVD for friends and relatives who had never seen it. And as much as I had a hard time accepting the notion that it was actually not just somewhat entertaining but a worthwhile film, I have come to consider Grizzly Man as being one of the most important, if not one of the best, films of the new millenium thus far.

And the credit must go to Grizzly Man's director, Werner Herzog, who saw the the value in the story and somehow effectively pieced it all together.

To begin with, it is a hard-copy of evidence that nature has drawn clear lines in the sand regarding our interaction with wild animals, regardless of how much we as humans would like to believe otherwise. And despite our best efforts and intentions, these lines should remain clear and fixed, whether in the wilds of Alaska or the pools of Sea World. I was left with the impression that Treadwell probably did much more harm than good for those advocates of ""becoming one with nature"", which he himself accomplished. Literally.

Grizzly Man is also a unique look into the mind of a disturbed individual. Rarely does a documentary capture such skewed thought processes and delusional ideations (2007's ""Crazy Love"" comes to mind). As can be evidenced in his rantings, rages, and curious soliloquies, psychological issues are what seem to have driven Treadwell to the wilderness and ultimately to his death. And we can thank Timothy Treadwell himself for capturing it all in hours upon hours of film spanning a decade.

But what I find most interesting about Grizzly Man is the subject's desire to extricate himself from the human race. Filmed in both the 1990's and the 2000's, I'm struck by the notion that at any other time in my fifty-five years it would have been easy to discount Timothy Treadwell as an eco-nut and Grizzly Man as a cinematic anomaly. However, this crazy notion of escape doesn't seem quite so crazy today. With a seemingly endless war raging in the Middle East, high unemployment, a crumbling economy, loss of faith in our government, etc., etc., escaping ""civilization"" doesn't seem as crazy as it once did.

While the events of September 11th, 2001 played out live on millions of televisions across the world, at least one man was oblivious, happily cavorting with the wildlife of Alaska. That alone is worth watching.

Also highly recommended is the 1996 book ""Into the Wild"" by Jon Krakauer and the 2007 Sean Penn film of the same name.",1315699200,4,3636,4.720820189274448
2427538,4,B000BMY2NS,"The fascinating parts of the movie for me were the scenery of Alaskan wilderness, the fauna and the lesson inherent in the tale of the central character. The two things that i admired about Treadwell were his ability at filming the wild and his tenacity at living the life of his choice. However, i am not so sure of his intentions. He repeatedly calls and portrays himself as a savior of bears, but there has been no huge threat of poaching in Alaska in the last three decades with the state supporting a healthy bear population. As such, i believe his life in the forests was all about getting away from the real world that he despised. That he loved animals is beyond a doubt, however i saw in the movie a distinct lack of respect for nature and a complete misunderstanding of his own role in the world as an environmentalist. His close physical contact with the formidable behemoths, and his interference with their daily world betrayed his lack of appreciation for the jungle and natural law, and it could not have ended in any other way but in the death of this lunatic. What's worse, he takes another human life with him. The only environmentalist who is good for the world and can teach us something about it is one who can learn from nature without attempting to change it, a concept certainly lost on Treadwell.",1311552000,3,1321,4.554621848739496
2427539,5,B000BMY2NS,"Prior to viewing this film I was given a two sentence synopsis from a friend: ""It's about some guy who lives in the woods and then him and his girlfriend get eaten by bears. He was an activist or something....total idiot."" Immediately I was filled with contempt, yet intrigued to learn more about this deviant individual who defied civilization. After many days spent with a Google search engine (obsession - a personality component Treadwell and I share), I came across articles, video clips, and excerpts from books Treadwell had a hand in writing. Slowly but surely my ire waned and, before I even attempted a viewing, I got a sense of this manic-depressive's inner turmoil.

After viewing the film, Treadwell's delusions, paranoia, and narcissism are accented. We see an individual struggling with demons stemming from an unsavory past that had culminated in a severe identity crisis. Admittedly, I have a soft spot for deeply troubled individuals and I truly felt more pity than contempt after researching/viewing Herzog's film. It's just a shame Treadwell's story had to end the way it did. A little common sense would have gone a long way. On a lighter note, the nature shots are incredible and feature Grizzly Bears lumbering, fishing, and even brawling amid the breathtaking Alaskan landscape.

My only complaint is that Herzog gets a little too mellow dramatic at times: comparing Treadwell's soul to a jagged icy trench, filming himself listening to the attack audio, etc. He is a filmmaker after all and part of their job is to manipulate the audience's emotions, endearing us to Treadwell, I suppose. The soundtrack is fantastic as well. I had never heard 'Coyote Song' by Don Edwards and found it to be the perfect compliment to a nature film. Overall, the film is great and the DVD includes an extra worth checking out aside from the trailer: 'In The Edges: The Grizzly Man Sessions' (about making the soundtrack). No director's commentary which is a shame because Werner Herzog is a brilliant director, but the film is great and at Amazon's price I would highly recommend adding ""Grizzly Man"" to your DVD collection.

If you want to read more about Timothy Treadwell I would suggest checking out one particularly poignant article: Vanity Fair's 'The Man Who Loved Grizzlies' by Ned Zeman. A quick Google search will bring you right there...fascinating stuff.",1311120000,2,2374,5.0050632911392405
2427540,3,B000BMY2NS,"I work up in Kodiak, Alaska 5 months out of the year and I am in the company of bears often. The locals keep a respective distance from the bears. I too enjoy taking pictures and videos but the ""Grizzly Man"" was a total fool to think he could interact with these creatures. These are top level predators that will look at you one day, lay down near you the next day and then rip you to pieces whenever they want. The fool in the video attempts to humanize nature so he could ""bond"" with the bears. I hate to say it but in the video he quotes ""I would die for these bears"" Well guess what...no surprise there.
Other than that the video is passibly interesting but the interviews drone on and on. If you need a cautionary tale to show the kids what not to do with nature then get a copy, but save yourself some money and borrow a copy from a library, or heck i will send you mine.",1311033600,4,878,4.08092485549133
2427541,4,B000BMY2NS,"I love Werner Herzog movies. My favorite is ""Aguirre the Wrath of God""; which is a portrait of a deluded madman bent on conquest and fortune. Herzog's documentary ""Grizzly Man"" is much more disturbing because it is 100% true. This docu is about a madman named TIm Treadwell, a man who is basically a loser searching desperately to find something to do with his life a self-important mission. The scariest thing about this docu is that the madness is not limited to Treadwell, it seems that everyone around this man was either weird or downright deranged. The basis of the madman's life is told to us by his parents who also seem a little out of touch with reality. They inform us that their son was a diver with a scholarship who got into alcohol and drugs and then lost his scholarship. With no education, Treadwell allegedly focused on acting. His parents claim that he came up second to Woody Harrelson for the bartender role on Cheers. I seriously doubt that this madman ever did any acting of consequence. He was first an alcoholic and then turned to heroin. Heroin claims most of its users' lives in this case it claimed Treadwell's sanity. Once he supposedly got off drugs he became obsessed with ""protecting"" bears. With camera in tow this froot loop goes to Kodiak national park in Alaska to ""protect the animals"". You read that right he claims to be ""protecting"" the animals. From what? Any rational person would ask; after all this is a national park where the animals are supposed to be protected by the park. Herzog includes an interview with a park official who basically says that Treadwell's so-called protection is basically useless! Yet Treadwell insists that these animals are being ""f'd over""! He rants, raves and curses like a rapper over and over about how the park is trying to stop him! These are the ravings of a self-important lunatic. As mad as Treadwell was the women in his life were just as crazy. The biggest nut of the bunch was a woman named Amy Hugenard. We the viewers see only a couple of glimpses of Hugenard in the countless hours of video tape which showcase Treadwell's madness. Hugenard died alongside Treadwell in his tent. She was so insane that she feared bears yet she lived with this unbalanced man in a tent in a national park full of bears! There are also two other women in his life who are now determined on getting camera time and lionizing Treadwell's insanity. There are also disturbing scenes of the doctor who performed the autopsy on Treadwell and Hugenard. He seems to love the camera as well, describing the crazy people's bodies and injuries with great relish and bugged out crossed eyes! Fortunately in this menagerie of madness that is this docu there are a few voices of reason, oddly enough Werner Herzog is one of them. In the last few minutes of the movie Herzog shows a close up of one of the bears and says that he does not see any of the mad romanticism with which Treadwell spent endless hours babbling about, all Herzog sees is the animal instinct for food and survival. In the end, Treadwell's mad promise to protect the bears was nothing but a hyperbolic lie. For one, when the madman and his crazy gf were consumed by a bear, the bear was shot and killed as was another bear that confronted the park rangers. So he did make a difference for the bears; because of his nonsense two innocent bears were killed just for being bears and doing what they naturally do. As a helicopter pilot puts it simply yet eloquently Treadwell ""got what he deserved"".",1310428800,2,3520,4.624600638977636
2427552,5,B000BMY2NS,"This documentary is a few years old, but it seems to pick up sales and interest around the holidays - somewhat a disturbing trend, when you consider Treadwell will forever be known as the guy who went up to Alaska and got eaten by bears. I actually have an opinion of why it's a popular documentary around the end of each year: the pending New Year will always bring reflection, looking back, and wondering where, if we have not yet realized them, our dreams have gone. Therefore, a movie about a man who did what he wanted to do - hell, he packed up every year and went up and lived with 700 pound bears, filmed them and gave each and every one of them names -, is interesting. His journey may have ended badly and tragically - even moreso because his girlfriend was also killed by the bear which killed Timothy -, but at least, he followed his heart. This may be why Treadwell has so many followers and fans; like another young man who went to Alaska, Christopher McCandless&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Into-the-Wild-Blu-ray/dp/B001GMH8SI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Into the Wild [Blu-ray</a>] (Chris would be found dead from starvation a few months after walking 'into the wild' of Denali National Park), Timothy will be the subject of argument forever. I myself am surprised that, although I think the documentary is brilliant, well directed and beautifully photographed, I have far less sympathy for Treadwell than I do for the beforementioned McCandless, because both men seem cut from the same cloth. But, while McCandless was obviously responsible for his own end as well, he did not 'intrude' on nature to any noted extent, nor did he try to 'change' a wild bear's mental makeup. McCandless, while a loner with some real dysfunctions, seems to have been  -for lack of a better description - a danger to nobody but himself. Timothy, on the other hand, put into motion the events which ultimately cost his girlfriend her life, and I do agree with one of the individuals interviewed that Treadwell may have 'done more harm to the bears than (helped them).' As other reviewers mention, the bears caught on film often truly do seem confused at this man's presence, and very few seem all that happy. If you are going to disagree with me after watching this film, please go back and track the 'lighthearted' moments between Timothy and nature - they are almost all of the wild foxes, which sit quietly as Timothy pets them. You can see the man's good intentions, then, in these scenes, but there is a hell of a difference in  a fox the size of a family's pet dog and a bear the weight of four average grown men. I found myself thinking that had Treadwell just figured out borders, and what lines not to step over, he might still be here. I would gladly suffer the loss of some close up shots of the bears if Tim were still around to turn out panoramic scenes, more work on the foxes, so forth. And so... why didn't this man, why didn't Chris McCandless, why didn't so many other unnamed individuals whom have yet to have documentaries made about them, books written about them, know when to step back from the precipice (a precipice that Treadwell himself acknowledges, in the film, that he is dancing along the edges of)? Well, that's what makes the story so fascinating. The majority of mankind will have dreams, and some will never even get to begin to follow them; the day to day life will take over, the bills will need paying, and so forth. Then there are the few who will set out to discover their dreams; they'll backpack, hitchhike, get up on stage with a guitar they saved four paychecks to buy, and they'll damned well try...and an even smaller percentage will succeed, reach the peak of the mountain, the edge of the sea, receive the applause and praise that they sought. Then - then...there are the one or two or six or eight, in this entire world, who will do a Treadwell or McCandless and do what they think they must do, and they will become so determined to live those dreams, that slowly (or maybe not so slowly, maybe Treadwell, watching and listening to him in this film, knew all along what was going to happen - he says again and again different mantras of ""I'll die for my bears"")they are no longer are dreams, they are necessity. And when dreams become necessity, that is when stopping at the edge of the precipice and looking over, and allowing oneself to be thrilled and proud of that accomplishment in itself, isn't enough. There's only one thing to do from that point then, and that is jump, and I personally believe that Timothy Treadwell jumped. We are watching a man basically commit suicide on film, and we know it, and he knew it, and he didn't care how his actions would affect survivors, family members, even viewers - I was stunned at some of the gruesome footage of the bear that purportedly killed Treadwell and his girfriend, cut open in search of body parts. But it is a fascinating film that one watches, nonetheless, and not for a 'snuff film' sick thrill. It is a reminder that we are each only human, we are way, way down on the universal and karmic food chain, and we had better not get too big for our britches. There is no denying that Treadwell was a dreamer, but dreams, you have to remember, can be both good...or nightmares, and they are of our own making. A five star tale of caution-",1291939200,,5385,4.65546218487395
2427553,4,B000BMY2NS,"This movie is PAINFUL to watch! At every moment you cringe and wince at the cheesiness that spoken by this insane lunatic...Your mouth gapes open with horror and disbelief as he pets GIANT HUNGRY PREDATORS and talks to them as if they are puppies. The bears don't look at him like they love him or are ""bonding"" with him. They just look at him like, ""What is that THING doing in our home? Maybe if we ignore it, it'll go away!"" and they are pretty much indifferent and just seem to be tolerating him rather than befriending him. This is obvious to everyone except for Timothy Treadwell.

No joke folks. Timothy Treadwell actually caresses bear poop in this movie and goes on about how it's still warm and (ew!) just was in her. Then he goes on about how `perfect' the bears are. It's creepy, it's disturbing and I confess at times the movie is downright laughable. This movie is a train wreck but for a different reason than many other movies. It is the true and tragic story that proves how real life can sometimes be crazier than fiction. At this point in the movie I was like ""Okay, this man is officially whacko!"" and yet I couldn't stop watching.

There is some beautiful wildlife and nature footage but this movie isn't about wildlife.  It is more of a statement about the nature of human mental illness. It is about one sick, delusional, self-centered and basically insane man who thinks he is some kind of ""bear whisperer"" and he spends 13 summers with them claiming he is 'protecting' them from poachers...Huge scary animals with big claws and teeth who live in a PROTECTED park...clearly what they needed was an effeminate buffoon there to protect them for a few months a year, right? Um, NOT! Also, how is a buffoon with no weapons supposed to protect huge, scary animals from scary guys with guns? One has to wonder...

Tim Treadwell ended up doing far more harm to the bears than good. If he ""loved"" these animals as much as he claimed he would have realized the best thing for them is to stay WILD and thus, to stay away from humans. Instead, Treadwell spends much of the movie baby talking to these huge beasts as if they were teddy bears. All the while the bears seem to be merely tolerating him. The ""bond"" that he imagines between him and the animals seem more like a fantasy imagined in his own mind. It is clear that he wants to escape the human world and puts the world of bears up on a pedestal as if it were some high school clique he is trying to fit into.

He sits curled up in his tent with stuffed teady bears (again no joke) making videos while real, dangerous bears lurk outside. He is supposedly this ""rugged"" mountain man yet we never see him in dirty clothing or shoes, his hair is always trimmed in the same bowl-haircut (with a matching colorful bandana) and his face is always clean shaven. If he was some tough mountain man, why wouldn't we see him with scraggly hair and a beard? Yet we don't. We see him go on long-winded, emotional, angry rants about the park rangers, the human world and society and even his own (questionable) sexuality.

As it was said so well in the movie, Tim crossed the invisible line that exists between man and nature. We should fear wild animals and they should fear us. Both are safer this way. If we DO choose to observe wild animals in their natural habitat, we should respect their home and obey safety rules. Wild animals should stay wild and those of us who truly are `at one' with nature recognize this. We are HUMAN and this means we should use our large brain to make educated decisions like keeping ourselves and the wilderness we love safe from harm.

Chances are, you already know how the movie ends but you have to see the movie to really understand the madness that is Timothy Treadwell. This isn't a movie about bears. This is a movie about a man losing touch with reality. Tim became so lost in nature that he forgot the natural order of things...The natural order that says bigger predators eat smaller ones! Tim forgot that humans are a predator too and we have HANDS so we can carry WEAPONS! ""Kind warriors"" were probably not the reason that humans survived. We survived because most of us have the common sense to either AVOID or KILL a huge predator like a bear! Most humans in our history probably had the common sense to NOT do the things that Timothy did...but we see early on that Tim isn't like most human beings!

Bears are dangerous wild animals. People can try to `befriend' them in the wild, feed them, put them in circuses and make them jump through hoops but the fact remains they are and will always be WILD and DANGEROUS! If they don't eat us it is because they aren't hungry enough...Unfortunately for Tim, the bear that ate him just happened to be hungry that day. The bear also wasn't afraid of humans probably because Tim had `bonded' with them and didn't use bear spray...Didn't use a harmless pepper spray to scare off a HUGE animal that can tear a human to pieces...a weapon that could have saved the lives of two humans and the bear.

As far as this being a ""good"" or ""bad"" movie, really it is hard to say. It is a REAL movie and reality can be harsh and nature can be cruel. Some people might say it is exploitive but I think it is educational. I think this is a story that is better off being told. I don't think I would buy this movie but I would probably watch it again. If you are the type who hates to know the ending, DON'T watch this because the ending is obvious to everyone but sadly for Timothy, he could not see the obvious until it was literally biting his head off.

My hope is that this film serves as a warning for people. Someone out there might see this and say ""Maybe it ISN'T a good idea to make friends with ___(insert dangerous wild animal) I could get eaten like Tim Treadwell!"" For that and that I give it four stars, not because it was a great movie but because it has a great message. Herzog didn't lie or bend the truth. He used the footage that told a very sad and very true story and he lets us be the judge. If you love this movie or if you hate it, if you think Timothy deserved his fate or if you don't one thing is certain: After watching this you probably WON'T want to go on any camping trips in the Alaska wilderness!",1286150400,11,6261,4.380378657487091
2427554,4,B000BMY2NS,"""I love you and If don't come back. That is what I want""

A pretty disturbing view of a man spiraling down into complete detachment from society, reality and his own self. We first start with Treadwell the filmmaker who simply wants to show people the beauty of the bears such as when he goes to schools to give presentations, then he turns into Treadwell Nature's advocate who wants to protect the Bears from intruders and finally we see Treadwell the extremist who has completely divorce himself from society and its rules and simply runs amok with the bears just to later find out that Nature can be as fricking brutal as civilization.

You can argue that he was probably hurting the bears more than protecting them by breaking their territory thus making them get accustomed to humans.
And although that's  true I think his love for the animals was honest. I think he seriously whole heartily believed he was understood and loved by the grizzly bears. Treadwell mistakes the grizzly bears' indifference or incompetence as a sign of acceptance, and falls in love with them and see him get over emotional for these animals that most likely don't share the same feeling is just beyond sad.

Its a tragedy but all we can do is learn from his failures and appreciate his gift to us which is all the beautiful footage he was able to obtain through out the years. And appreciate and respect nature because nature is indeed part of us.",1283126400,,1431,4.644268774703558
2427555,4,B000BMY2NS,"As a whole, `Grizzly Man' really works.  As far as creating a fascinating and engrossing documentary, I have rarely seen any this well crafted.  Sadly though, upon reflection I do have some issues.

I happened to see the film alongside the short documentary counterpart, `Diary of the Grizzly Man' and the two together are perfect complements.  They create a great film.  Separate though, it becomes apparent that `Grizzly Man' is missing some important facets to a great documentary.  I kind of had similar issues with Sean Penn's film `Into the Wild'.  The film focuses on one aspect of this person (obviously the most influential) but by leaving out the other areas of his personal life we get an almost manipulated idea of who Treadwell was.

I think it's hard with a subject like this.  Your obvious inclination is to focus your efforts on the thing that made him so well know, the crazy bear lover side of him.  But, without much time (if any really) spent on dissecting what he did when he wasn't with the bears we get an incomplete knowledge of Treadwell.  I really wish that `Diary of the Grizzly Man' were a part of this film, because the debated segments and comments made by friends of Treadwell really help elaborate on who he was to them, outside of the bear lover the world knew him as.  I also felt that certain segments of `Grizzly Man' that didn't make it into the final cut really would have helped flesh out the motive stirring within Treadwell a little more.

One of the issue commented on in `Diary of a Grizzly Man' was that the film makes poaching seem like a small problem.  A scene cut from the film that is shown in `Diary of the Grizzly Man' shows that in the months following Treadwell's death there were six poached bears found.  It is a disturbing sight to behold, and it also gives a validity to Treadwell's claims and his mission that I think is lost a bit in the film itself.

That isn't to say that Werner Herzog doesn't `respect' Treadwell and what he stood for.  In fact, Herzog's treatment of the controversial subject, I felt, was superb for you could really see the unwavering respect he held for the life Treadwell lived, even if he didn't agree with him 100%.  It's just that the films focus at times seems to paint Treadwell a certain way to the general public.  While it is easy for a filmmaker and or someone who dwells in a similar world as Treadwell to see past appearances to the meat of who he was, to those on the outside so-to-speak, Treadwell appears crazy.  While I wouldn't doubt that he had a few mental issues (a lot of which I feel came from isolation for all those months), I don't think he was crazy.  Omitting key moments like the uncovering of the poached bears makes Treadwell's whole purpose seem in vain.  I think had that moment been kept, as well as some more in depth discussion about his home life (and by home life I mean life away from the bears) been filmed then the film truly would have breathed a new life into Treadwell.

One thing that I will say about this film, that I absolutely loved, was the contrast between Treadwell and Herzog.  Their views are very different, and having someone like Herzog direct this film, for me, was a very smart move.  You don't have something who overtly sympathizes with the man's viewpoint, and so you have a film that remains very objective, and one that stirs debate.  In fact, when you factor in the sad demise that befell Treadwell, Herzog's sentiments in regard to nature in general seem to ring loud and clear.  That said, having two sharply contrasted viewpoints only goes to make Treadwell seem all the more `crazy', despite claims by his friends that he comes off like a rockstar.  I don't see a rockstar, I just see the films `star'.

Still, I highly recommend this film.  Despite any flaws I can find, it is remarkably engrossing and completely engaging from start to finish, and the footage documented by Treadwell himself (which litters the screen throughout the film) is glorious to behold.  It is some of the most beautiful footage I've ever seen taken in the wild.",1281312000,2,4090,4.576923076923077
2427556,4,B000BMY2NS,"For thirteen summers, Timothy Treadwell lived among the wild grizzly bears of Alaska.  An untrained but fervent bear-lover, he took his videos and message of bear preservation to schools during his off-season.  This documentary alternates Treadwell's footage with interviews of his friends, family, and co-workers.

The result is a portrait of a man with a childlike enthusiasm and certainty that he could live with the bears as one of them.  He also comes across as a grandstanding showman determined to make himself immortal.  This documentary has done that much, although Treadwell and his girlfriend were killed and eaten by one of his beloved bears.  There is no footage of bears showing anything but indifference to him, but Treadwell endlessly proclaims his love for the grizzlies and says he would willingly die for them.  One can only imagine the horror of it.

The Alaskan footage is lovely and one is impressed with the power and size of the bears.  Unfortunately, the pristine beauty is usually interrupted with Treadwell's showboating antics.  I think he was delusional when it came to his safety and I feel sorry for those who mourn him.  Heartily recommended for nature lovers and those interested in a man recklessly pursuing a bizarre lifestyle.",1280361600,,1262,5.107317073170732
2427557,4,B000BMY2NS,"Grizzly Man is a Werner Herzog-directed documentary about Timothy Treadwell, a man who went to the wilds of Alaska to live amongst the Grizzlies for 13 years until his death at the hands of one in 2003.  When it happened, his and his girlfriend's deaths garnered much attention both because he had already attained a minor celebrity for his documentary trips, and because the audio of the attack was captured by Treadwell's video camera, which had been left on with the lens cap attached.  Alas, if you're interested in this movie for morbid reason, then you'll be disappointed.  While there are descriptions of what happened by the coroner and Herzog, who both heard the tape, you will not hear the audio here.  But what you will get is a moving portrait of a disturbed but well-intentioned man, a man who found no solace from a life that he found increasingly difficult to live other than in the love of animals.

The film consists mostly of shots from Treadwell's own camera.  Most of them show him talking with a bear in the background, explaining where he was, what was going on, who the bear was, or simply to profess his love to the animal.  Usually all four in a single shot.  Throughout, the bears seem to pay him a little attention, but there are some scenes where they get so close I felt nervous just watching.  Herzog narrates over a good stretch of it, giving us his interpretation of what's happening.  He also interviews friends and family for further context.

Though Treadwell was obviously troubled, there was something deeply moving about this film for me.  I felt for him.  Treadwell was disturbed, but still struggled to improve the world.  His films were meant to educate and he thought he was protecting the bears.  While it's unclear from the movie just what impact he had on grizzly poaching, there's no question he tried to bring awareness to the public through his voice and videos, something he seemingly did for free or very little money.
Part of the reason we have empathy for Treadwell is in Herzog's presentation of him.  In the first half, we see the endearing side of him, his concerned love for the bears, his child-like playfulness with foxes.  (The scenes with the foxes were the most moving to me because they showed, I think, that while he couldn't really connect with the bears, he could do it, to an extent, with smaller, less dangerous animals.  Similar to what we can have with pets. )  We hear from his friends and family about what a great person he was.  We also hear the rational Treadwell, a man who admitted he could be killed, but was willing to die for his cause.

But in the second half, Herzog unleashes Treadwell's madness.  We hear about his failures and his shifting personalities and even identities.  We see him childish in his anger over the harsh realities of nature, like when he finds the remains of an eaten baby fox or when he rages against God for causing a drought.  Or when he goes on his lengthy rampages against the people he perceives as his enemies, including the Park Services and the Federal Government.  We soon come to understand that we are all his enemies; the human world is his enemy.

As Herzog narrates the final days of Treadwell's life, it seemed to me that maybe his voyages to the wild were just an elaborate suicide.  He knew he would die, though he says at one point he doesn't want to.  But his actions at the end showed caution thrown to the wind.  What else is one to think?  Though his inclusion of his girlfriend gives one pause.  Could he have been so disturbed and care so much for animals yet drag a girlfriend to her own death?  (Many will think he dragged her to her death whether he meant to die or not.) My feeling is that he was not.  Perhaps instead he just grew careless and cocky from surviving with the bears for 13 years.

I think if you're an animal lover, you'll watch this film and be moved.  The scenery of the animals and their environment is stunning in places and always interesting.  Treadwell knew how to compose great shots.  You'll probably think him saner than you might have going in, but I think you'll still find yourself shaking your head through much of the film.  If you're not an animal lover, I think you'll see him as an unambiguous nutcase, and think, like one person in the film, that Treadwell deserved what he got.  Either way, whether you feel for him or not, the film will engage you and make you think again about nature and our place in it.",1279843200,,4475,4.54625
2427558,5,B000BMY2NS,Herzog has done something extraordinary with the story Treadwell.  This film is more engrossing and has more emotion and feeling than almost every scripted film I've ever seen.  One really sees this unique man up close and is able to get a feel for how different parties feel about him.  The audience is also given the creative room to come up with their own view.  A film not to be missed.,1273968000,,390,4.450704225352113
2427559,5,B000BMY2NS,"""Grizzly Man"" is a powerful movie by Werner Herzog, a movie about the life of Timothy Treadwell, who hardly needs a closer introduction. Treadwell lived around brown bears in Katmai (a national park in Alaska) for thirteen seasons in a row, somehow getting the wild bears to tolerate his presence. He became a national celebrity in the United States, claiming to defend the bears from poachers and other threats. In 2003, tragedy struck: Treadwell and his companion Amie Huguenard were killed and eaten by brown bears as they were camping in an area Treadwell called the Grizzly Maze.

Herzog's movie paints Treadwell as a loner who gradually looses grip on reality and rejects Western civilization as he becomes more and more obsessed with the bears. Treadwell wants to bond with Mother Nature, unable to realize that nature is chaos and brutality rather than love and harmony. Eventually, he looses it completely, and develops a veritable death wish. ""Grizzly Man"" implies that the death of Treadwell at the hands of a bear might actually have been a form of suicide. To Herzog, Treadwell is an idealist who crosses the line between beast and man, and gets punished for it. His destruction is seen as inevitable. In a sense, Timothy Treadwell becomes the New Age version of Aguirre.

I don't deny that the movie is captivating and the message powerfully delivered. But is it true? Probably not. Here and there, another possible explanation for Treadwell's behaviour emerges: he had a celebrity complex and wanted to shoot a sensational film, with himself as the lead actor. Judging by Mike Lapinski's book ""Death in the Grizzly Maze"", this comes closer to the truth. Frankly, I suspect Treadwell was something of a con artist. Where Herzog saw a man slowly descending into madness, I see an actor playing out a part. The man may have been ""nuts"" in the everyday sense of that term, not to mention reckless and irresponsible, but I can't find any evidence of a death wish in Lapinski's book. Still, even Lapinski is willing to concede that Treadwell might have suffered from a clinical condition, bipolar disorder.

Ultimately, of course, everyone must make up his or her own mind about Timothy Treadwell. ""Grizzly Man"" is a good place to start. Then, read Mike Lapinski's ""Death in the Grizzly Maze"", Nick Jans' ""The Grizzly Maze"" and Treadwell's own book ""Among Grizzlies"".",1270512000,,2376,4.949874686716792
2427560,4,B000BMY2NS,"You should not judge a man's life until you have walked his path. It astounds me how many people have judged Timmy incorrectly. I actually liked the movie, but I didn't interpret Timmy's behavior as most people did. Everyone says he was a nutcase, a crazy fool with a death wish. In fact, Herzog seems to imply this. Well, Timmy wasn't a nutcase at all. We all need something in our lives to make us feel important. For some people it's a job, for others a relationship. For Timmy, it was bears. Yes, Timmy did something dangerous. But people do dangerous things all the time. Do we think race car drivers are nutcases? No. How about people who climb Everest, where every 1 of 10 climbers gets killed? What about an astronaut, blasting off into space, knowing that two space shuttles have exploded in the past? These people are seen as normal, as courageous, even as heroes. There is NO difference between what Timmy did and what these people do, except that what he did was not socially acceptable. But besides all of that, you need to realize how many hours Timmy spent with the bears. Something between 30,000 and 40,000 hours over 13 summers. How long is that? Well, if a work week is 40 hours, then Timmy spent the equivalent of 17 years full of 5 day work weeks with the bears without incident. Now, imagine YOU do something, Monday to Friday, 8 hours a day, for 17 years, and nothing happens to you. Wouldn't you, at the very least, feel some sense of personal safety? Of course you would. Timmy wasn't crazy for feeling safe around bears. They didn't so much as scratch him for the equivalent of years and years! Finally, Timmy didn't take stupid risks. He knew that all bears weren't safe. Sorry to all you people who think that bears are just man-eating monsters, but they're NOT. In most cases a bear will do everything to avoid a human being and to avoid trouble.  But they do have personalities. Think of your pet dog if you need an example. Some bears were aggressive, dominant males in particular. Most bears were not. But Timmy (and rightly so) knew which bears posed a threat and which didn't.  And he was very, very careful around those bears that were dangerous.  Timmy had a gift; he understood bear behavior better than many bear biologists with dozens of years of experience. And he was right about their behavior, he knew what he was talking about. He knew how to read them, and he was always correct. Is it any surprise then that he felt safe around bears? Then there is the topic of Timmy's seemingly crazy-sounding ""confessionals"" on tape. I didn't see anything crazy about this. People get emotional and angry all the time. I've seen people get a lot angrier than Timmy, and not alone in front of a camera, but in real life among other people or even in public. And I'm sure he never really meant to have the angry, emotional footage showcased.  He was human, give him a break. Some complain that Timmy talked to bears. So what? Have you seen how people talk to their dogs? Even huge dogs are often talked to in the same way Timmy talked to the bears. Nothing crazy there.  Timmy came from a difficult background. It's true that he had a troubled past. It's true that he wanted to be famous. It's true that he wanted to be the main character in his movie. But this made him feel important, a basic human need. We all look for things that make us feel important, because it gives us purpose. We all want to be the main character in our lives. Timmy just went about it with bears and a camera. Crazy? Well, not if you look at the amount of reality TV shows out there. How many of those people wanted to be famous? And how many people watch those shows? There's nothing crazy about that. Timmy wasn't a bad man. So many of the people who knew him, liked him.  He was a nice guy. He was troubled, yes, but a good person. He certainly didn't ""deserve"" to be killed by a bear, no more than someone who takes a car to work (which by the way, is statistically riskier than living in bear country) deserves to die in a car accident, or a race car driver deserves to burn to death. I think he should have carried bear spray, just in case. But I know why he didn't. If nothing bad happens to you for years and years you begin to believe in a certain margin of safety. I don't agree with Timmy on that point, but he was more of a risk taker than I am. Finally, the ""bears"" didn't kill Timmy. It was one, specific, particular bear who did.  The bear was old and cranky, and probably hungry and desperate to feed before the end of the season. What this bear did is extremely rare.  The bear appears in the film in the scene where Herzog says Amie filmed because the shot was hand held. He was big, he was red. His lower lip stuck out, possibly due to a past injury. Could it be that the injury made it difficult for the bear to find food, therefore making him more desperate? We'll never know.  We should be so lucky to know a person like Timmy. Timmy was caring, sensitive and had a good heart.  Was he a little strange? Yes. But if you look closely enough - so is everyone.",1267488000,5,5088,4.36325237592397
2427561,5,B000BMY2NS,"Herzog has a certain vision of life.  It is nakedly brutal, raw in its rapacity and ambition, and ruthlessly egotistical.  These themes occur in all of his fictional films, perhaps most successfully in Aguirre.  Well, here he had found a remarkable subject, the Grizzly man, who left a record of his unusual life and even of the moment of his death.

He started out as a misanthropic alcoholic, failing at everything he tried, but with the ego to push forward.  Believing that he found something in nature and the most unpredictable predator of all, the grizzly bear, he carved a unique niche for himself as an educator and conservationist.  In this, he was a pioneer, in his attempt to breach the barrier between man and bear that had stood for 7000 years, bringing back a film record of his adventures and stories to enchant children and adults alike.  Though a failed actor, he developed a persona and ideals that he claimed saved him from drinking himself to death.

But something far darker lurked beneath the surface, which perhaps Herzog was the best person to plumb.  Herzog gained access to his film archive of hundreds of hours of revelatory solitary conversations, statements, and images.  He went over them carefully and pieced together a record of wonderfully human complexity, showing a conflicted man who was deluding himself as to the nature of the world (at least as Herzog sees it) and creating an act for his career as well.  Herzog also interviews many friends, family members, and critics, to gain a full perspective on a life at the limits.

While critical, Herzog was also deeply respectful of the talents and drive of this man, which is one reason why he did not include the footage of his death for consumption by a bear.  I thought that he chose to respect the proper distance and discretion in his approach, which he did not overtly use to titillate the macabre minded.  It is a difficult balance brought off perfectly.

If you are a Herzog fan or seeker of starkly unromantic realism, this film will fascinate you.  Many will disagree with his conclusions, but no one can ignore this masterpiece.  Warmly recommended.",1267401600,,2145,4.801089918256131
2427572,1,B000BMY2NS,"Disturbing on so many levels; even if you don't feel like sitting through my entire review, just read the last 2 paragraphs which epitomize my point.

Proclaims director Werner Herzog, ""I believe the common denominator of the universe is not harmony but chaos, hostility and murder.""

And boy, does he ram that thought down our throats.

To those of you who are familiar with Herzog's films, this is nothing new. In fact Herzog and his better half Klaus Kinski made some fantastic films centered around this compelling theme. There's ""Fitzcarraldo"" about a madman who fights against the jungle and gets his butt kicked. There's ""Aguirre"" about a different madman who fights against a different jungle and gets his butt kicked. And now we have ""Grizzly Man"" about a madman who fights against the Alaskan wilderness... and... ??

The problem is this. While the former two are magnificent works of fiction which I hold in the highest regard (really, they are 2 great movies if not for the fact that he chopped down half the Amazon to film them), here Herzog crosses the line by attempting to sell this story as a ""documentary"", when it's no more than a cleverly-edited manipulation of truth. I'm surprised Fox News didn't offer him his own show after this.

Timothy Treadwell was not a madman. He was just an unusual person who, in his solitude, liked to rant into a videocamera (wouldn't you?). Then an unfortunate thing happened--no different from what happened to Croc Hunter Steve Irwin. Herzog bought the footage. And with some clever editing we get the image of a frothing, rabid lunatic. Eager to punish him for his arrogance, we get once again the evil forces of nature (this time: angry, vindictive ursines) who conspire to commit bloody murder in the night.

But listen up; it gets worse. The clincher is at the climactic scene when, having whipped us into a bloodthirsty frenzy, Herzog moseys on camera holding the coveted tape of Treadwell's gruesome death. But instead of airing it for us, he pulls a total Geraldo Rivera and says in his most melodramatic voice, ""This tape must never be played. It must be destroyed.""

And we are left disappointed, embarrassed, cleaning the drool off our shirts while Herzog pats himself on the back for tactful journalism. What a circus this is! And we, my friends are the suckers. This way to the Egress. This way to the Egress.",1265241600,5,2375,4.820638820638821
2427573,4,B000BMY2NS,"It's easy to be needlessly cruel to Timothy Treadwell. Here is a person who dedicated years of his life to grizzlies, living among them and treating them as friends, despite all expert advice and warnings to the contrary. And Treadwell ended up being killed and eaten by the very creatures he loved so much. Those with a twisted sense of karma can certainly have plenty of fun with him. But Werner Herzog showcases another side to Treadwell, and presents us with a different view of this Grizzly Man. Not necessarily better, but different.

Treadwell is often ridiculed as narcissistic and deluded, and at times the film partly reinforces this view. Certainly his extended juvenile rants to the camera and his laughable belief that the bears cared about him (""wow, Miss Chocolate did a giant poo just for me!"") make him seem like an egotistic nutter.  But other parts of the film showcase a deeply troubled soul; a former drug addict and misfit who found it difficult to live in human society. It's easy to see how Treadwell regarded the bored indifference of bears as non-judgemental friendship, and how his love for grizzlies brought some meaning and direction to his wayward life. It's also easy to see why he despised the rangers and experts who tried to prevent him living among the bears....without the grizzlies, what else was there for him to live for?

Sadly, Treadwell's misguided love for grizzlies caused him to overlook one obvious fact.....animals are not human. No matter how much we try to interpret their behaviour in human terms, an animal does not feel emotion or affection the same way we do, and they do not rationalise their actions. Wild animals especially are impulsive creatures governed by instinct. For me, the saddest part of this documentary is where Herzog notes that he looked into the bears' faces and could see no sign of friendship or affection. It's never pleasant to tread on another person's dreams.

Herzog does a good job with the film; he collates clips of Treadwell, interviews from third parties, and adds his own interpretations and narration. Herzog is clearly genuinely fascinated by Treadwell, a man who seems to mirror the unstable protagonists of several Herzog films. But his is certainly no hagiography; wildlife experts and other opponents are given just as much screen time as Treadwell and his supporters. And Herzog is at times critical of Treadwell's behaviour, in particular one instance where he censors a particularly nasty Treadwell rant because it is too personal and extreme.

In all, this is an interesting, well-made, but sometimes disturbing portrait of a man whose belief and obsession caused him to become blind to reality.",1264896000,2,2689,4.993303571428571
2427574,2,B000BMY2NS,"Despite the breathtaking images of nature and the almost comical character of Timothy Treadwell, I disliked watching this and would not watch it again. At times I wondered if it was all an act. Treadwell is (unintentionally?) funny, the coroner creepy, and both seemed like B-grade actors.

Was Treadwell gay? I think so, and even though some will argue that it does not matter, to the extent that he was running away from society, from people with whom he could not or would not be honest, that led him to Alaska and ultimately into a bear's tummy for dinner.

Was Treadwell mentally ill? He certainly seemed a quarter or two short of a dollar. It's one thing for a young child or even a daydreaming teenager to have grandiose dreams and to humanize animals (although I suppose Mr. Chocolate *was* hungry!). It's quite another thing when a failed actor and former drug addict in his mid-40s does it.

Was Treadwell selfish? Unequivocally, yes. In the end he got his girlfriend killed, not to mention two grizzly bears.

I am reminded of Into the Wild (the book, as I have not yet seen the film): Weirdo goes up to Alaska and gets himself dead...tonight at 11. Yet Krakauer's book succeeds where Herzog's film fails. That is, creating a personal connection between the protagonist and the storyteller. Krakauer uses his own harrowing experiences as a mountain climber to gain insight into Christopher McCandless' demons, while Herzog simply uses Treadwell's own videotapes and words against him, possibly making the bear lover out to be even crazier than he was.

I tend to side with naturalist (and true bear expert) Charlie Russell. From whom did Treadwell think he was protecting the bears? Why did he so unnecessarily put himself in harm's way? To set himself up as a hero, probably. My guess is he intended to sell his own movie. To be fair, Treadwell took time to observe animals in their natural habitat, but he crossed the line. He loved the grizzlies as most of us would love a stuffed teddy bear. But, he abused this relationship. On an appearance with David Letterman in 2001, Treadwell called the bears ""party animals."" He was disconnected from reality, but his luck and the bears' own self-restraint kept him alive for more than a dozen years. As Deb Liggett, National Park Service Superintendent (Katmai and Lake Clark National Parks and Preserves), told the Anchorage Daily News two years prior to Treadwell's death, ""At best, he's misguided. At worst, he's dangerous.""

One star for the bears and foxes and another for the cautionary tale this documentary tells. Anything higher risks idolizing this idiot.",1263254400,5,2622,4.880898876404494

After watching more of his works like 'Little Dieter needs to Fly', I've come to the reasons of why he does this types of movies. I'm giving this three stars now for knowing who the Director is and NOT because of that story of a Deluded man-boy who by his own actions killed a women for his pride.

The man within this movie was real. That is the only truth within that is undeniable, but to place such praise on this one individual who ""fought the man"" to protect one single animal that was never endangered was ludicrous from the very start. Soulful music and ""grand"" over-reaching narration does not make ones' tale epic. So driven was this man that he ignored all those danger signs about a Wild Animal and while he himself was narrating his ""sad"" tale he was attacked and mauled by the very animal he believed he was protecting. How do I know this? Because his recorder was still on while the bear was Tearing him apart.

2427578,5,B000BMY2NS,"Timothy Treadwell spent 13 years among grizzly bears in Alaska with his video camera before he was killed by one of them.  A recovering alcoholic who never fit in human society, he found meaning living with the bears, whom he loved for the romantic characteristics that he projected upon them.  He saw the bears as beautiful and authentic and believed that he had a genuine connection with them.

How ironic and interesting that the filmmaker who presents and shapes his footage is Werner Herzog.  Treadwell captures Herzog's sympathy because his crazy obsession to confront nature is so similar to that of many Herzog protagonists in other films.  Yet, where Treadwell saw beauty, Herzog sees only cruelty and chaos.  Nevertheless, he seems to respect Treadwell's compulsion and presents his story with great sympathy.  He also admires Treadwell as a filmmaker, and we are treated to many extraordinary images.  After listening to the tape that recorded the deaths of Treadwell and his girlfriend Amie Huguenard, he tells the woman who owns the tape, a close friend of Treadwell's, that she must destroy it and never listen to it.  This is far more affecting and dramatic than any voyeuristic thrill the viewer might get from actually hearing the horrible sounds.

2427579,5,B000BMY2NS,"Wernor Herzog's Grizzly Man is a fascinating portrait of how an individual can come to be a self-deluded savior.  Before watching it, I gave Timothy Treadwell the benefit of the doubt.  I figured he was a reasonably intelligent, if not eccentric, person who got a little too close to his subject, perhaps let his guard down, got too relaxed, and forgot about the ferocity of the beasts he was dealing with.  After watching it, I'm convinced Treadwill was, for the most part, an unstable, self-deluded idiot.  Numerous times throughout the film, we see Treadwill disturbingly close to his subjects, as if they were simply misunderstood and not capable of killing a human.  It's a theme throughout the movie where Treadwell talks about how dangerous these animals are and how dangerous it is what he's doing, but he either doesn't believe what he's saying or doesn't care.

Treadwell's megalomania comes through when he constantly talks about how he ""protected"" the bears for another season, how nobody else could or would do that, but he did.  If we saw him stop some poaching or something along those lines, there might be some validity to his claim.  But the only time we see any visitors to the area, he hides behind some foliage and complains about people harassing the bears to photograph them.  Treadwill has convinced himself he needs to be there every year, and the bears need him there too for their own safety.  How he's protecting them by following them around with a video camera is beyond me.  He did get plenty of excellent footage of the bears so all his time is not spent in vain, but other than this, there is nothing that leads me to believe any of his time is spent in scientific pursuits.

One of the Alaskan natives that was interviewed for the film says he believes Treadwill got what he deserved, and that the reason he thought Treadwell wasn't killed sooner was that the bears probably sensed he was mentally retarded and thus, not a threat.  I couldn't help but laugh at that, because I can see how there seems to be some truth to it.  Several times in the movie, Herzog shows footage of an obviously unbalanced Treadwell lashing out at different groups of people he believes have wronged him.  There is also an interesting exchange where Treadwell discusses his sexuality.  He talks about how he has had problems in relationships with women, how it might be easier if he was gay, but then emphatically states that he is straight.  I got the feeling his sexual identity was confused, and that had something to do with his isolated existence living with the bears in the Alaskan wilderness.  He also alluded to an alcoholic past when he was younger, and how living among the bears had saved him from that fate.

The film itself was very entertaining throughout.  Treadwell took some incredible footage that is a joy to watch.  Herzog blends the footage and interviews seamlessly, and the soundtrack fits the footage very well.

Timothy Treadwell wasn't a bad person, and I think he meant well, but he used grizzly bears as escapism, a way to leave his turbulent younger life behind and find some stability and a way to cope in this world.  Perhaps he found a measure of this, but unfortunately for him, those who cross that invisible line into nature need to do so shed of fairy tale notions and beliefs.  Treadwell definitely didn't do that, which ultimately led to his demise.",1242691200,6,3401,4.725423728813559

We'll never really know for sure, because the script for Grizzly Man allows the viewer to come to his or her own conclusions.
But one thing is for sure; after watching Grizzly Man, my opinion of bears has been lowered significantly.  I once viewed bears as honorable creatures.  Now I view them as ungrateful creeps who think that it's okay to eat people whenever they want.

By the way, Timothy Treadwell's girlfriend (Amy) gets eaten along with Timothy.  I don't really have a problem with that part of the movie because Amy wasn't very nice to the bears.

2427593,4,B000BMY2NS,"This is a very, very disturbing documentary about a sick individual, a man who re-named himself, ""Timothy Treadwell: Kind Warrior. "" The most alarming aspect of this biography may not be his lunacy but the huge of numbers of people out there who support a wacko like Treadwell. That's frightening.

This was a very interesting film, but not one I would recommend particularly to my friends, at least those who are offended by the f-word. There are 50 cases of that in here so be forewarned. There are also a few short scenes that will visually disgust you. In other words, this is not an easy film to watch and ""Grizzly Man"" may sound like a nice Disney adventure but it is anything but family fare.

The movie gets points for keeping one's attention and making us think about it, but a film on horrible car crashes could have the same shocking effect, so I wouldn't go overboard in praising this film just because it held our attention. Nonetheless, an intriguing film and one that should encourage intelligent debate, and for that, it's very good.

Veteran German filmmaker Werner Herzog narrated and put together this film, from many hours of footage all shot by Treadwell. Suffice to say the documentary paints a disturbing portrait of a Far Left radical who goes way over the edge. If Treadwell was a Christian, the filmmakers would be quick to point out here is another ""religous nut,"" but Treadwell was the opposite, a non-believer, a man who admitted he was clueless when it came to whether there is a God or not or what He would be called. I only mention this because Treadwell's atheism points out one of the dangers of it: you make up your own set of rights and wrongs, based solely on what pleases you, what you can live comfortably with, and it's extremely selfish and usually very destructive in the long run.

Treadwell worshiped himself....period. He loved his looks, his courage, his noble actions, as he puts it, on and on. Just listen to him. That constant ""I love you"" to all the animals and even insects was another mask for his inability to adjust to his own human species and sexuality. In his selfishness, he forces himself on a world that wants no part of him and where he has no business being......all in the name of being this great protector of animals.

An extremist like Treadwell winds up hurting his well-meaning environmental cause for the more sensible people who might be on his side, but at least have respect for laws, know the difference between humans and animals and have tolerance for all viewpoints. Treadwell cared only for himself, despite his claims, and to filmmaker Herzog's credit, he shows this.

The real tragedy in the whole story was that someone else also died a horrible, violent, unnecessary death along with Treadwell. And - despite Treadwell and his friends opinions - human beings are far more precious than animals.",1234915200,5,2875,4.728542914171657

I notice that virtually everyone tries to psychoanalyze Tim but I feel I really relate with the guy and so I'll offer up my own.  I think he knew how ""cold"" the world really is, likened it to the food chain of the animal kingdom, and was attempting to explain that fact to his viewing audience.  In the midst of the eat or be eaten craziness of the animal world which he was too compassionate to take part in, he grabs a camera and within his kindness shows to you what does happen.  I love his narrations and call them sermons.  He had some problems in life and simply couldn't get ahead, so he takes a deal to document his own death for money.  In fact, if you watch his video clips with that in mind, you can see that that is the case.  He talks of his trouble getting along with women, bosses, authority figures, and with people in general, struggling with homelessness of course, yet he loved nature and felt that they didn't, so he proclaimed, ""I will die for these bears."" And he did die in order that the bears be filmed, which he definetely knew was coming, and consistently conveys to the audience that this was the whole plan all along anyways.  I notice with his sermons that that was the point, and in the midst of that of course it's also clear that he genuinely loved animals, especially the bear.  I think most will disagree with me on my analyzation of the man, but hopefully we can all agree it's an epic documentary.",1234224000,2,1499,4.344086021505376
2427595,5,B000BMY2NS,"Grizzly Man follows Timothy Treadwell in his attempt to escape civilization and inhabit a world with one of the most dangerous animals on the planet - the Alaskan Kodiak. Treadwell, who sees himself as a misunderstood ""kind warrior"", shunned by mainstream society, escapes urban LA every summer and journeys to the Alaskan wilderness. However, as we quickly learn, Treadwell may have other motives for his annual journey besides protecting these majestic creatures. Werner Herzog, with his enlightening and intelligent narration, is your guide as you watch his main character descend into madness. Herzog accurately portrays Treadwell as an ego-maniac, confused by his sexuality, and misguided by mental instability. As one reviewer accurately put it, Treadwell is, ""a whack job loser, self-proclaimed warrior for the bears, [who spends most of his time] worrying about how his hair looks or what hanky to wear in a shot..."" Treadwell's attempt to convince his audience to understand the Kodiak parallels his own attempt to understand himself. He persuades himself that the bears, like him, are victims of the evils of society and envisions himself as their only savior. Treadwell, deluded by this fantasy, mis-judges the true nature of these wild animals. He and his companion ultimately suffer a horrible fate. If you are expecting a feel-good nature documentary, this is not for you. This film is raw and crude. It is a true, post-modern tragedy.

2427596,5,B000BMY2NS,"The version I watched had a disclaimer at the beginning: Modified from its theatrical release. I don't know what that means, but the film I watched was riveting and always interesting. Mr. Herzog's narration keeps everything in perspective, telling the sad story of a man who was disillusioned with society at large, and his own disappointments at success (it's said he lost a role in ""Cheers"" to Woody Harrelson). I'm reminded a bit of ""Into the Wild"", but this is more a story about a guy who was a bit removed from reality, and thought he could empower Mother Nature herself. He thought of himself as primordial, when in fact he was clueless that nature has its own idea of survival. I guess it's no different than the crazy people who want exotic animals for pets, and end up being their lunch. Nature cannot be out-guessed, and poor Timothy Treadwell got crazier over the years. Too bad Amie went with him; she's an enigma in this film, never a clear shot of her.  Mr. Herzog's narration is intelligent enough to make this an interesting story about a delusional (albeit well-meaning) person. The stunning shots in Katmai Nat'l Park in Alaska are breath-taking. But it's all about the bears.  Bears will be bears, and Tim couldn't understand that. Tim was nave and a bit of a narcissist; his association to reality deteriorated, and he got the obsession, as most people crave to fulfill, but it was his demise. There's a fine DVD extra about Herzog's input into the music score, whch was very interesting. ""Grizzly Man"" won many awards as Best Documentary Film in 2005, but failed to get an Oscar nom. I guess that just goes to show that we're all entertained differently, and we can't all relate to certain things. Indeed, I heard how violent this film was (NOT!), but watched it because of its awards recognition. It's basically a film about obsession gone bad, and not as gruesome as I'd been led to believe.

He obviously had an amazing way with animals. Having lived with bears for 13 seasons with no other incident proved overwhelmingly that bears are not unpredictable and that bears that did not fear humans were not inherently dangerous.  As Charlie Russell states (one of the world's most knowledgable bear researchers ), "" the one thing that upsets people the most about Timothy, to the point of loathing him, was that he talked to bears in a kind way. In Alaska this type of behavior is unforgivably stupid. If Timothy had spent those thirteen years killing bears and guiding others to do the same, eventually being killed by one, he would have been remembered in Alaska with great admiration.""",1229212800,2,1090,5.072625698324022
2427599,3,B000BMY2NS,"What an insane arrogant moron he reminds me of Andy Dick! Anyone could see Treadwell wasn't long for the world in the film's opening. Far from protecting these animals he was doing great harm. Exposing the animals actual location only encourages other people to come and interfere with them. Habituating these animals to humans greatly increases the danger for park visitors, which in turn increases the chance that the park service will have to move or destroy animals. In the aftermath of the attack the park service destroyed not only the bear mentioned in the documentary but also another bear that challenged the rangers during the clean up. The second bear was omitted along with other inconvenient facts to make the viewer more sympathetic to the victim's fate.  The movie mentions that Amie Huguenard had joined Treadwell for two seasons before their death what they neglect to mention is that Amie carried bear repellent both those seasons but she didn't the last trip. That's like not wearing a life vest when you're water-skiing because nothing bad happened the last time. But the most glaring failure of safety omitted from the film was that they were eating in their tent right before the attack!?!?  My claim to possible grizzly fame was a three-day trip to Yellowstone and even I know food handling and storage is a major safety concern. Treadwell was cited before by the park service for storing food in a cooler in his tent! Add to this they stayed a week longer than any other trip before which placed them well into a pre-hibernation feeding period known as hyperphagia. During this period the salmon run ends and unfortunately the berry crop was poor that year. When you know all the facts Treadwell's death is a foregone conclusion.

Kevin Sanders (a professional guide) has written a full report of the investigation with many details not included in the movie along with a theory on the attack. It can be found at the link below.

2427600,5,B000BMY2NS,"I thought this documentary was really well made and showed Timothy Treadwell in a sensitive way, exposing his excentric way of thinking and unusual - and most would think misguided and quite foolish way of living in Alaska (then again what 'most' people in rich and richer nations,(and rich people in every nation) think is a normal lifestyle nowadays is pretty similar corporate influenced wasteful self-centred consumerist lifestyles which when thought about doesn't seem that valid as a sane way to live in this environmentaly degrading world anyway). I found the whole film very moving - combined with the wonderful music. It does come across like an emotionally wounded and complicated man (but basically a nice guy) going to be amongst nature with what (in his mind) he sees as kind of friendly bears. The film ends with a natural result of extreme hunger with dwindling supplies of fish at the end of the season. It is a tragic story but contains beautiful imagery from Treadwells films, and paints a portrait of an unusual man with an unusual life and who had an unusual death.
Some reviewers say it is a 'fake' and are surprised that people can 'believe' it. It doesnt come across as at all fake to me and the story of Treadwell is well known as authentic. I saw recently the horse**** that is  Werner Herzog's 'Incident at Loch Ness' which is obviously a spoof and reveals a part of Herzogs sense of humour which is opposite to mine as it made me cringe with uncomfortable feelings that he would make such a film. But Grizzly man is a great film, along with many of Herzog's other films, and shows Herzog's sensitive approach and brilliant artful documentary making.",1226966400,,1676,4.759450171821306
2427601,5,B000BMY2NS,"Yes, Timothy Treadwell was certainly narcissistic; he clearly tried to create a personality that screamed ""hey, look at me!""  And his life among the bears was just as much about filling certain voids, disappointments, and shortcomings in his own life as it was about protecting the animals.

But, oh, those animals.  There was a genuine rapport between Mr. Treadwell and his subjects.  It wasn't just in his head.  The way those little foxes followed him around all during the movie (playing with him, sitting on the roof of his tent, etc.) will break your heart.  Maybe the bears ultimately didn't have a clue, but those little foxes knew that Timothy Treadwell, whatever else was going on in his head, genuinely loved the wild denizens of the Alaskan wilderness.  So, for me, the central tragedy of the movie resonated well beyond feelings of ""well, his death was a shame but he kind of asked for it.""  Or, to put it another way, though a definite animal lover, this cynical reviewer doesn't usually anthropomorphize our four-legged friends, but I somehow know that those foxes mourned and were saddened by their strange human companion Timothy Treadwell, so that made me mourn Mr. Treadwell, too, at least more than I would have otherwise, if I'm honest.

On the special features front, an excellent look at the scoring sessions of the film, rich with comments and input by director Werner Herzog, further enhanced this special little film.  I enjoy special features that genuinely illuminate the creative objectives of a film's director, and the way his or her process fulfills those objectives, and this fifty-plus minute extra feature did that nicely.

The coroner gives a very detailed description of what is going on while Treadwell is being attacked by the bear, so other than to satisfy his own morbid curiosity, there was no need for Herzog to listen to the tape.  And, though Herzog recommends to Treadwell's ex-girlfriend (the owner of the tape) that the tape should be destroyed, reportedly the tape still exists.

2427605,5,B000BMY2NS,"Tragic yet unapologetic, Werner Herzog's ""Grizzly Man"" is an in-depth character study of a man who grew increasingly uncomfortable living in society (perhaps because he failed at it) so sought refuge in the Alaskan wilderness with ferocious Grizzlies. Many viewers have complained that the film is about Timothy Treadwell, not bears, but one glance at the title tells you who the protagonist of this documentary is.
  Timothy Treadwell grew up ""a normal kid"", excelled at high school swimming, and seemed fearless when surfing or immersing himself in the ocean. One wonders if this was the beginning of what would become increasingly alarming suicidal behavior. He admitted to problems with alcohol and drugs, to the point where he would drink every day and couldn't pry himself from the lure of the bottle. He came close to death during a drug overdose, and this was his ""epiphany"", a wake-up call that something needed to change in his life.
  So he found his calling trying to protect bears. The ironic thing is, one cannot form an intimate relationship with bears, since they do not experience human emotion. Timothy felt he was doing them an incredible service, but it's a mystery to me (based on the movie) exactly what he did for them. Did he feel his mere presence warded off poachers and thrill-seekers? He educated kids about bears and formed an ecological group dedicated to bears, but the film focuses mainly on his wildly irrational judgment in choosing bears as his companions in a world he deems antagonistic.
  I believe Timothy was failing in real life and needed something to make himself feel valued. He admitted to having problems maintaining relationships with women, verbalizing this in an almost despairing way on camera. Since the wilderness was often mind-numbingly boring, he created drama to elicit emotion from himself. In one scene, he mourns the plight of a bumblebee that has perished while ""doing its pollen thing"". A few seconds later he says, ""It moved. Was it just sleeping?"" The same could be asked about Timothy Treadwell. A friend states that a doctor wanted to put him on medicine, but he took himself off the drug because he couldn't live with the middle ground that most humans rely on to function. Timothy wanted the ""highs and lows"". Quite possibly manic-depression made him feel larger-than-life, a hero of nature, a Herculean savior who got mauled by the very animal he was trying to save.
  Indeed Timothy appears manic at times, ranting about the Wildlife Service that fails to protect the bears, and declaring himself the only person who cares about them. He barks angrily at God when there hasn't been enough rain and the bears grow so hungry from fish-deprivation they start devouring their young. This is only after his attempt to create a channel in the river fails, and he unknowingly tampers with an ecosystem that should best be left alone. During the movie, Treadwell repeats ad nauseum that he ""loves the bears"", and also the foxes that frolic around his campsite. I wondered if he was repeating this over and over to try to convince himself that it was true. It is normal to feel love for nature and its beauty, but it is dangerous to relate to an animal that stares at you without a hint of reciprocal passion and will act on instinct to mutilate you if you do something that is deemed even remotely threatening.
  Sadly, Timothy tempted fate by staying in the wilds too long, which perhaps was becoming his only comfort zone in a reality he couldn't comform to. His female companion was sacrificed for a cause that Timothy considered noble but was actually a delusion to keep himself productive and satisfy an overwhleming need to conquer his own demons by exorcising himself through animal-preservation. How sad that the animal he was trying to protect was possibly his own worst enemy.",1221955200,5,3847,4.886503067484663

2427607,4,B000BMY2NS,"Why is glorifying the insane and stupid an American obsession over the last couple of decades? The documentary Grizzly Man does not attempt to answer this query, yet it does its best to bring this tendency to its odd apogee, and is literally unlike any other documentary film I've ever seen. Coming off his participation in the great mockumentary Incident At Loch Ness, it should not come as a surprise that German filmmaker par excellence, Werner Herzog, would stick with the documentary format in this, his latest film. No, it is not a nature documentary, as most film critics, including Roger Ebert, have written, simply because it follows a man who spent thirteen consecutive summers filming grizzlies on an Alaskan wildlife refuge, Katmai National Park, on Kodiak Island, but a documentary whose subject matter is a man's flaming insanity, as it charts the life and death of a fey, severely mentally ill blond man with a Prince Valiant haircut, originally from Long Island, New York, named Timothy Treadwell, who spent summers filming bears, and the rest of the year going to schools, showing his films freely.
  I get tired of books and films devoted to the worst in society- the insane, criminal, selfish, greedy, shallow, etc. While watching the tale of this supposedly reformed drug addicted alcoholic-cum-New Age weirdo, I could not help but compare his life and death to that of another deluded narcissist who perished over a decade earlier than Treadwell, also in the wilds of a Alaska- Chris McCandless, whose delusions of being one with nature led to his death in 1992, chronicled in adventure writer Jon Krakauer's bestselling book Into The Wild. McCandless was another bored, spoiled, upper middle class white boy whose easy life was seen as something `terrible' to deal with. So, he bummed around the country, using many aliases- including Alexander Supertramp, until he decided he would go and rough it in the Alaskan wilds, alone and ill-prepared. That he ended up starving to death in an abandoned bus made him a hero to addle-minded nature buffs, and a target of scorn to Alaska natives who respect nature, and resent twits like McCandless being seen as anything other than the fools they were. Yet, Treadwell was worse, and his end even more ignominious, because not only did he get himself killed and eaten by a bear, but also his 37 year old blond girlfriend- Amy Huguenard. And, when he died in 2003, Treadwell was 46 years old, while McCandless was only half that age upon his death in 1992.
  Yet, there is no denying Treadwell, was mentally unhinged, even as Herzog rapturously declaims his filmic abilities with a camera, and imbues the most banal shots with an intent and skill that just is not there onscreen, lacking any real style. Herzog must have had to tell himself this to justify his fascination with Treadwell's bizarre antics.... I would have cut the film thirty to forty of its one hour forty-five minute running time, because much gets repetitive. This is a film worth seeing, but only if you bear in mind the wisdom of one of the helicopter pilots who flew home the duo's remains. He calls Treadwell a retard, then states, `He was treating them like people in bear costumes. He got what he deserved,' a statement echoed by a Native American Kodiak Island museum director, who says, `My people have been living nicely with bears for thousands of years and we know enough to stay out of each other's way.'
  That Treadwell did not only begs the question I opened this review with- why does Herzog feel this man's stupidity and idiocy are worth glorifying in film? Especially when he clearly believes Treadwell's philosophy is wrong. Where Treadwell sees cuddly things he'd die for, cooing he loves them, even as he actually taunts the bears, as if they were stuffed animals, like the teddy bear he sleeps with in his tent, Herzog sees indifferent creatures who could make a meal out of you at any time, and we see a well meaning idiot, the New Age nuts that revere him, and a film that is perversely fascinating.

2427610,4,B000BMY2NS,"Unabashedly: I love H.D. Thoreau. He was a thinker, a poet; he was also a strange duck. Recently there have been Christopher McCandless--who walked headstrong, headlong, one-way into the Alaskan wild unprepared--and Timothy Treadwell--who returned year after year to a preserve of Alaskan bears to try to become a Grizzly Bear. They were just strange ducks. (My apologies to those who knew, and loved, these men.)

Some of Treadwell's footage is spectacular. (And the real film maker, Werner Herzog, has chosen and included the best.) Herzog was sympathetic to Treadwell--he cared for him; he interviews (and grieves with) others who cared for him.

Much of Treadwell's footage reveals--not nature--but his nature. He intrudes on the bears' space (to prove his superhuman bravery?); he fondles a pile of bear excrement (to prove his love for the bear?); he rants about the National Park Service; he cuddles at night with his stuffed toy bear: he prays to Jesus-child, ChristMan to send saving rain to the bears . .

In an interview with Treadwell's father, we learn Treadwell auditioned for a major part in the TV series ""Cheers"". He wasn't chosen; Woody Harrelson was. Treadwell, according to his father, never recovered from that trauma. Then, this psychological study, makes more sense. This Expedition 2000, Expedition 2001. . .these return trips to live among the Alaskan grizzlies become Treadwell's show--footage of grizzly bears starring Timothy Treadwell; footage of Alaskan wilderness starring Timothy Treadwell. Clearly Treadwell is moved by the magnificance of Alaska and of the grizzlies. But his film project ultimately is more about him: his bravery, his sense of ecological justice, his sentimental view of nature, his attempt to become the superhero: Grizzly Man.

But then I think, how is Treadwell different from the likes of Steve Irwins and other animal behaviorists, scientists, etc.?  Don't they all risk their lives when exploring animals, especially those who are exotic, territorial and/or menacing?

The thing about *The Grizzly Man* was that I found it to be boring and redundant.

2427624,2,B000BMY2NS,"It is hard to distinguish a review of the documentary from a review of the reckless behavior of Timothy Treadwell itself, but I will try to be fair. First, as to Treadwell the person, let's make no mistake about it: he was not a scientist or conservationist, what he ever wanted was nothing more than fondling with the bears he claimed to ""love"". To him, bears were just a substitute for the narcotics that he used to use. What he loved was himself and himself only. From the ever-so-queuer way he talked to the bears one had to agree with one of the people interviewed in the movie: he treated the bears as people wearing bear costumes, and yes, I agree with the same person who said that he crossed the line and got what he deserved.

What is sad is that the bears he tried to ""protect"" had to be shot dead. And what is ironic is that he mostly roamed in federally protected lands. Those bears did not need his ""protection"". If he wanted to protect bears, he should have gone back to where he came from and started educating people about conservation.

And what made him think that he was a ""protector"" of bears? Did he think he was God incarnate?

What is amazing is that he actually had a girlfriend who went along with him. It is beyond belief that anyone would actually trust her life with such an apparently mentally problematic person. Ultimately, I suppose, we are the decisions we make -- she probably also deserved her fate for her poor judgment. I know I may sound insensitive, but this is what I feel -- I don't think I am being insensitive, on the contrary, I think I am just speaking the truth, however painful it may be.

Back to the documentary, I guess I did get some information from it, so I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. What I don't understand why make it so long? It can be summed up in a 5-minute news cast at most. Here's my try: ""Young Caucasian male with history of mental instability and obsessed with himself, went to Alaska to mess with bears, got eaten along with girlfriend.""",1200787200,2,2007,4.372654155495979
2427625,5,B000BMY2NS,"""Grizzly man,"" a gripping documentary made by the eccentric though well-regarded German filmmaker Werner Herzog, is the tale of one Timothy Treadwell, a self-appointed naturist, narcissist, filmmaker, educator, fantascist and savior of Alaskan Grizzly bears. Consisting largely of footage that Treadwell himself made (some of which is breathtakingly beautiful), documenting the animals in their natural habitat and his ""conservationist"" efforts, ""Grizzly Man"" reasonably asks whether Treadwell was a true ecologist, a foolish dreamer or simply a flat-out nut-case. Whatever the case, this cautionary tale bears more than a passing resemblance to the megalomania that eventually consumed Dian Fossey, that great champion of gorillas in Rwanda, who in 1985 suffered an equally gruesome death (though at the hands of humans) in the name of her cause.  Unlike Treadwell, however, Fossey was a true scientist, whose work has contributed greatly to our present-day understanding of the animals she so painstakingly studied.

Over the course of 13 summers, Treadwell gave his ""pet"" bears ridiculous names like ""Saturn,"" ""Mr. Chocolate,"" ""Sergeant Brown"" and ""Tabitha.""  He got frighteningly close to the bears, wading into water to touch them, venturing too close to females and their cubs (he is even seen touching and cooing over a bear's excrement!).  ""Grizzly Man"" effectively shows Treadwill's transition--again much like Dian Fossey's--from naive enthusiast to paranoid and delusional misanthrope as he distanced himself from the world of humans and tried to descend into that of the animals.  The film never really answers the question of why or how Treadwell came to leave the safe cocoon of a middle-class upbringing, gravitate West, nearly self-destruct in the process and, finally, stumble onto the cause which gave him a certain notoriety.  Central to ""Grizzly Man"" are the interviews of close friends, associates, wildlife professionals, academics and reproachful, fatalistic voiceovers from Herzog himself--most of which bemoan Treadwell's willful ignorance, disrespect and violation of the laws of nature.  In essence, most observers felt that Treadwell's habituation to the bears did much more harm than good to the cause of preservation.

Nevertheless, the Treadwell saga came to an abrupt end in late 2003, when he and his girlfriend, Amie Huguenard, were killed and largely devoured by a marauding bear at their remote camp. In fact, the saddest story of all in ""Grizzly Man"" is that of Huguenard, who had planned to break with Treadwell, due to her (healthy) fear of bears and her (rightful) sense that her boyfriend had an all-consuming death wish.  Whatever one thinks of Treadwell's methods (and madness), ""Grizzly Man""  makes a powerful case for respecting choices that individuals make to give meaning to their lives--even if some of those choices seem horribly misguided, deeply disturbing and needlessly tragic.",1200096000,5,2931,5.551569506726457
2427626,4,B000BMY2NS,"This fascinating documentary has many aspects to enjoy such as real-life tragicomedy, unique up close video of the bears and a cast of Alaskan eccentrics in the background. The contrast between subject Treadwell's moon beam emotionalism and narrator Herzog's heavy German realism is unintentially hilarious and has already been parodied. Personally I'm much more comfortable with Herzog's approach; grounded by his pessimism he does at least stay on planet earth while we can only watch the flight of Treadwell's indulgences with amusement, disdain and a hint of admiration. You have to admit he did do amazing things even if he was essentially an idiot. Come for the nature footage but stay for the human drama.",1200096000,,712,5.2
2427627,5,B000BMY2NS,"I loved Mr. Herzog's look into Timothy Treadwell's world. You can say what you want about Timothy Treadwell, but it was obvious that he was a lost soul trying to make something out of his life. Living and playing amongst Alaska's brown bears takes a great deal of responsibility and knowledge of the unpredictability of wild bears. Timothy Treadwell is an example of a person not adhering to appropriate behavior in bear country. I feel most sorry for Amie and the two bears that lost their lives because of careless human behavior. Mr Herzog does a great job of putting together this really sad tale and ""Grizzly Man"" is well worth viewing.",1199836800,,641,4.732142857142857
2427628,1,B000BMY2NS,"Clearly the man was insane and is desperate for attention. He supposedly cared for the bears which I imagine in his own warped way he did. However, by placing himself in such a dangerous position (note how he hypes up that danger by constantly telling us) and getting himself killed he's put back the work done by Charlie Russell and other real bear conservationists by adding to the big bad bear false reputation. If you actually want to really learn something about bears and not some hero talking to a camera about his babies etc then ignore this lame Hollywood drama and watch 'Bear Man Of Kamchatka"" on BBC DVD.",1199577600,5,616,4.609090909090909
2427629,3,B000BMY2NS,"I watched most of this documentary on the Animal Planet Special.  It was very interesting but could have been condensed.  I also think it aggrandizes a misguided person who probably caused more harm than good to his cause, Alaskan grizzlies.  In addition, the film didn't give equal time to Treadwell's opponents, the National Park Service personnel, who tried to save his life by warning him.

I find it interesting that a man who claimed to spurn human society, as Treadwell did, could revel so much in the attention it gave him.  Unlike the Alaskan natives and Park Service personnel who lived in Alaska all year and spent most of their lives in Grizzly country, this rock star wannabe surfer dude spent a few months a year there and probably the rest of the year in the lower 48 trying to promote himself.  I'm sure he told alot of ladies at local watering holes about his exploits.  I thought it was humorous that the guy spent alot of time primping himself before he went on the camera by combing over his receding hairline and carrying a comb and mirror in all of his jackets.  The picture I got of Treadwell was a self-infatuated phony despite the documentary trying to glamorize him.

I can't deny that Treadwell truly loved these animals but he never really understood them.  To Treadwell, grizzlies were his pets and giant teddy bears.  The real experts tried to warn him about the danger in which he placed himself and the bears by losing their fear of humans.  His response was to give them the middle finger.  In the end, this arrogant punk was killed by his own foolishness.",1199232000,2,1589,4.632142857142857
2427630,4,B000BMY2NS,"There is not much I can say about this film that hasn't been said before. This film puts together some of amateur bear expert Timothy Treadwell's many footage tapes of the 13 summers he spent living in the company of wild grizzlies. Meanwhile he fought to preserve them and was an instant celebrity in the matter, which makes his death - at the hands of a grizzly - even more disturbing.

This film features some amazing footage - footage other wildlife enthusiasts could only dream about. Timothy almost always being the star of his narratives, along with the bears, his commentary shows him talking about, f.e., just how dangerous bears are. Yet he really doesn't seem to find these words to apply to himself; in many shots he gets in closer proximity to the bears than most would attempt, and he calls them affectionate names as if they were his pets. In addition, Timothy sometimes lets his fury on the system explode through himself in some tapes. This documentary on Timothy's life is also full of interviews with wildlife experts as well as people close to him.

As much as I like this cinematic documentary, I don't like Werner Herzog's narrative. He's more of an idealist than a neutral speculator, as far as I can tell. I particularly don't like his comment on how he sees Timothy's life's work only worthwhile because it's a story about the human spirit - he's practically overlooking everything Timothy did for grizzly bears, and the significance of it. Herzog can hardly keep his own disdainful feelings for grizzlies out of his commentary, either.

Still, I have to credit the man for collecting and arranging these out-of-this-world tapes, showing footage of grizzlies nobody else would ever dare attempt to capture. Herzog himself chose to leave out the audio-only tape that captured Treadwell's tragic death, and perhaps it's for the best. What we do see, however, gives us a great insight into not only the beauty of grizzlies, but also the intense struggle of a man trying to find himself in this world.",1198886400,,2022,4.821325648414986

2427643,4,B000BMY2NS,"The love-it or hate-it responses of the Amazon viewership to Werner Herzog's Grizzly Man illustrate quite nicely the theory that art exists not wholly formed on the page, canvas or celluloid, but somewhere between the viewer and the ""text"". If you come to this film expecting a beautifully shot wild-life documentary and hoping  for a picturesque education about bears and the Alaskan wilderness, you'll be sorely disappointed. The wildlife footage - some quite remarkable, notwithstanding - was shot by a paranoid loner on a handycam. You'll also have no-one to blame but yourself, since nothing about the film, even down to its name, let alone its maker, is suggestive for a moment that that's what it's about.

If, on the other hand, you come armed with some background knowledge about German director Werner Herzog and what he's about - not ordinarily a documentary maker as such, although some of his feature films have an almost documentary quality to them as studies in human obsession  (not least his own) - your expectations will be quite different, and I dare say your reaction to Grizzly Man will be too.

Over forty years Herzog has obsessionally directed obsessional actors (Bruno S, Klaus Kinski) depicting obsessional/delusional figures (Kinski as a psychopathic conquistador&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aguirre/dp/6305972761/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aguirre</a>&nbsp;searching for El Dorado, a barmy opera nut&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fitzcarraldo/dp/B00001ODHV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fitzcarraldo</a>&nbsp;with a dream of bringing high art to the deepest recesses of the Amazon rainforest, and as the good Count in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nosferatu-The-Vampyre/dp/B00005YJMX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nosferatu: The Vampyre</a>; Bruno S as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kaspar-Hauser/dp/B00005R248/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kaspar Hauser</a>, a man trapped from birth  for 20 years in a windowless dungeon in rural Germany, or in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stroszek/dp/B000059PPT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stroszek</a>&nbsp;as a man resemblent of himself vainly trying to escape his condemning past by going to America), in obsessional ways (Aguirre and Fitzcarraldo both filmed on location; in Aguirre Herzog allegedly held Kinski at gunpoint to prevent him walking out; in Fitzcarraldo when the script called for a paddle steamer being pushed by hand over the crest from one valley to the next, Herzog required his cast to actually carry out the operation).

Seen in this context, Timothy Treadwell represents almost found-object sculpture for Herzog: you couldn't make this up, and for much of the documentary, Herzog is arranger, art director and chief contextualiser; providing background interview material only to back up his own view of the world, which he openly concedes is quite contrary to Treadwell's (such as it was a coherent world-view). So to complain that Herzog is distorting; contorting; contriving an outcome is also (to my mind) to miss the point.  Yes, he is, just as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Marcel-Duchamp/dp/0939594102/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Marcel Duchamp</a>&nbsp;was contorting the true purpose of a urinal by inverting it, signing it, and entering it in an art exhibition. That's what artists do.

While it may be selectively edited, it is difficult, all the same, to conceive that what Herzog left out might negative the impression that Treadwell was an ignorant, paranoid, delusional burn-out, and that his most impressive achievement was not being eaten earlier.

Contrary to some reviews here Herzog is not by any means completely unsympathetic to Treadwell, but he sees him not as a naturalist but a natural film-maker. Some of the footage - when Treadwell can keep his sorry face out of it - is quite extraordinary, and reminiscent of some of the German director's own impressionist output, as Herzog remarks. As he was director, cameraman and star, Treadwell often had no alternative but to leave the camera running, and Herzog draws our attention to it - the random play of rushes in blustery wind reminiscent of the opening scene from The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser, which reflects on a ripe stand of barley in much the same way. And the final shot of the film, wherein we see Treadwell hiking away from the camera towards the perils of nature - bears, mountains, brewing inclement weather - is not unreminiscent of Bruno Ganz's departure into the Transylvanian mountains to confront the count in Nosferatu.

There are some aspects of the film I found less persuasive, and in particular Herzog's melodramatic decision to film himself listening, on earphones, to an audio-tape of Treadwell's actual death, then commending its possessor, a former girlfriend of Treadwell, to destroy it without listening. Herzog has managed to find a consistently weird cast of hangers on, ex lovers and Treadwell fans - and the oddest coroner I've ever seen - to backfill Treadwell's story - and while this does lend proceedings the unfortunate air of a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Christopher-Guest-mockumentary/dp/6305922756/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Christopher Guest mockumentary</a>, I expect it is no more than anyone would find if one poked around in remote Alaska long enough.

I loved this film. If you did, I would heartily recommend a look at Herzog's classic seventies output in particular featuring Klaus Kinski, which is anthologised in a pretty economical single edition:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Werner-Herzog-and-Klaus-Kinski-A-Film-Legacy/dp/B00005YKXQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Werner Herzog and Klaus Kinski: A Film Legacy</a>

2427644,5,B000BMY2NS,"If you search various internet search engines using ""grizzly man hoax"", you will find a number of discussion boards where people are intelligently and actively questioning the validity of this story, because so much of the information available to us today is completely suspect, and because the movie views like a mockumentary. I thought this was a hoax when I saw it at the theater, before reading or researching anything about the film or its subject matter. The only other Herzog movie I'd seen at that time was the Loch Ness mockumentary, which was not really that well done. So, I figured, he just got it (a seemingly ""airtight"" hoax) right this time. I experience huge amounts of cognitive dissonance from the 'information' people give me based solely upon media reports, on a daily basis, so I am not convinced that the information reported anywhere about Timothy Treadwell is valid.  After seeing more of Herzog's work, I do believe that he is entirely capable of staging such a hoax, including setting the main character up as a would be nature cinematographer/enthusiast well in advance of the production of the documentary. It wouldn't be impossible for anyone to do, especially Herzog, with years of experience, an iron will, and a demonstrated love of both the absurd and social commentary. We, the public are known to be relatively easily manipulated, as the majority of us take for granted that anything even marginally well stated is believable. I think that could be the real point of the film. Based upon Herzog's other work, I believe that he is mainly a performance artist, and that he just happens to use film as his medium. I believe that this is performance art - the whole thing: the set up, the delivery, and ultimately, the revelation and understanding that it's a hoax designed to measure the public's level of gullibility, which we already know is huge (weapons of mass destruction, anyone?). If you don't believe Herzog capable of such a hoax, just do what I did, and watch a bunch of his movies, including the ""Loch Ness Incident"", ""My Best Fiend""(sic), ""Fitzcarraldo"", etc., as well as reading discussion boards and reviews that discuss the ""hoax"" aspect of this film, and if you don't think a man who took a crazed Klaus Kinski into the Amazon jungle for three years and pulled a massive steamship over a mountain and dumped it into deadly rapids using only the manpower of a bunch of Amazonian locals just to put the whole thing on film and maybe make some statements about obsession, greed, imperialism, etc., isn't capable of pulling off a mockumentary of this scale, then I don't know what to tell you.  In any case, I've never seen a documentary about one man's angst and tortured existence with so many (or, any, for that matter) hilarious scenes that made the theater audience laugh out loud over and over again, ever before in my life, and I just can't answer the question of why that is without coming to the conclusion ""because it's a comedy"".  If Treadwell did really exist and die in this manner, then the other questions that I and others are asking about the film's veracity and/or intent still remain unanswered.  Don't forget that a well respected doctor perpetrated the famous ""Loch Ness"" photograph hoax and that he waited a long, long time before admitting to the hoax.  That guy wasn't even an avant garde filmmaker, just a well educated guy with an idea and a camera who wanted to have some fun and do a little experiment about what people are willing to believe based upon scant evidence.",1191715200,6,3543,4.782679738562091
2427645,3,B000BMY2NS,"Timothy Treadwell spent 13 summers protecting grizzly bears at perilously close range in a remote Alaskan peninsula - and then they killed him. His 'honest' straight-to-camera commentary depicted a man at odds with himself and what he called the human world; however, the irony that Treadwell died at the paws of those he was trying to 'protect' was not lost on the local National Park inhabitants, who felt that Treadwell was only dicing with death in getting so close to the grizzlies. Treadwell was obviously in love with himself more than his hairy friends; at times he worries more about his receding hair line than the bears themselves, and he feels no embarrassment in boasting that ""I am a kind warrior"" Director Herzog edits footage of Treadwell's documentaries with his own interviews to piece together a character of a man who tried all his life to be someone else.  Treadwell travelled around schools showing his footage to school children while never once soliciting a fee - and his skills as a documentary maker, as Treadwell's footage boasts coverage that studio directors with union crews wouldn't have got. Grizzly Man is a captivating and intriguing documentary, and a thought-provoking insight to one man's struggle - the shame is that the real struggle is with reality.",1190419200,4,1289,5.0233644859813085
2427646,4,B000BMY2NS,"It's easy to sneer, I admit.  Here's this fast-talking, ditsy Hollywood wannabee, capering around in the wilds of Alaska, foolishly risking his life out of a misplaced sense of kinship with dangerous wild animals.  A Darwin Award winner, you might think, and on one level you'd be right.

But the sad thing is that there is really no place in our society for people like Timothy Treadwell to go, anymore.  And it shows.  Henry David Thoreau and John Muir may well have been reduced to spewing profanities at the U.S. Park  Service, had they lived in the present.  Sure, Treadwell got lost in over-identifying with the bears, with his cute names for them and everthing.  Pure cathexis, concentrating emotional attachment onto a single, probably inappropriate object.

But he also achieved a cracklingly intense union with nature.  Going ga-ga over bear scat, or a dead bee on a blossom, he truly saw ""the world in a grain of sand, and a heaven in a wild flower"".  However maladroit he may have been in human society, Treadwell nevertheless experienced nature with a joy and savor and depth that many a more conventional environmentalist could envy.

Of course he was never in a position to protect the bears.  Indeed, being killed by one was a sure death sentence for the unfortunate mankiller--bears with a taste for human flesh could not be allowed to remain at large.  In that respect Treadwell was unforgivably selfish.  He should have known what would follow the event of his own death.

Director Werner Herzog mentions his own run-in with madness in the wilderness, alluding to the famous incident when he threatened to shoot Klaus Kinski during the filming of Aguirre, The Wrath Of God.  He admires many of Treadwell's shots, for effects both intended and unintended, and see-saws between treating him as a crazy romantic, and a fellow cinematic artist.

The best thing about the film?  The excellent folk-electric soundtrack by Richard Thompson is close to it.  The rustic stylings of the ex-Fairport Convention guitarist suit the gorgeous natural setting to a T.  The DVD has a nifty in-the-studio featurette with him, in the extras.

Animals can't tell you to buzz off and mind your own business, in so many words, which is why nature worship is so popular among busybodies nowadays.  We are not all brothers under the fur.  Some of nature's children are just plain old, unemployed, probably agnostic, wild beasts, into whom the lonelier of us project ourselves.  On that account, Treadwell wasn't much different from the batty old maid with an apartment full of cats.  But, for the transports of ecstasy he experienced in bear country, and filmed, and shared with thousands, he is someone whose memory will be long treasured.  The gifted, sensitive filmmaker will be remembered, not the suicidal fool.",1188950400,15,2811,4.950854700854701
2427647,5,B000BMY2NS,"Werner Herzog's documentary is excellent.  I thought it to be among the very best I've ever seen.  ""Grizzly Man"" deals with the crazed Timothy Treadwell who was doomed to eventually get himself killed.  The odds were against his ever reaching retirement age.  Treadwell so hated the civilized world that he deluded himself into believing that wild animals had more love to offer than other human beings. Amie Huguenard and the other women in his life were probably mere sex objects.  They were nowhere near as important as the grizzly bears.  It is obvious as you watch the film that Treadwell is increasingly becoming more unbalanced.  A group of men, for instance, visit his ""private"" island and are obviously non-threatening.  And yet, Treadwell imagines them to be the very opposite.  Some true believers (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-True-Believer-Thoughts-on-the-Nature-of-Mass-Movements-Perennial-Classics/dp/0060505915/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The True Believer: Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements (Perennial Classics)</a>) seek their utopias in political systems such as Communism, Nazism or environmental radicalism.  Treadwell instead opted for anthropomorphic extremism.  This is a sure one-way ticket to madness and eventual suicide.  Sadly, Amie did not recognize the danger signals.  Experts believe that an older and perhaps desperately hungry bear saw them as an easy meal.  There is one consolation regarding the deaths of Treadwell and Huguenard: they never murdered people on behalf of their utopian vision.  Only these two individuals paid the ultimate price.  For that, we can be thankful.",1188864000,2,1664,5.987288135593221
2427648,2,B000BMY2NS,"I turned off the movie with about 20 minutes left.  Herzog uses
private material from Mr. Treadwell to do a layman's psychological
profile of him.  This is an invasion of privacy and overall is deplorable.  It's also twisted how he focuses a lot of time on the gruesome death and details, including the audio tape.  If done with respect, this could have been an interesting, although more pedestrian documentary.  Herzog goes for shock value and thru hype and violations of privacy exploits this unique individual.",1188086400,4,514,5.0
2427649,5,B000BMY2NS,"Largely using Treadwell's own footage of himself in the Alaska wilds, Herzog combines this with his unobtrusive interviews with the principals who knew the errant wild animal lover and self-styled protector. The German director earned the trust of his subjects and they reveal as much about themselves as they do about Treadwell.

Patiently, Herzog edited Treadwell's own footage to let the tragic, delusional story unfold. Make no mistake about it, Grizzly Man is both painful to watch and completely absorbing. Treadwell loves to be on camera in a way that gives one the creeps. In the service of a seemingly noble cause, a disintegrated and finally paranoid Treadwell shows us how little he understands the wilderness he claims to love and the civilization he despises.

During the commentary, I thought I heard Herzog associate Treadwell with other American ""loners"" like John Muir and Henry David Thoreau. If so, it should be noted that Treadwell is devoid of Thoreau's high principles, discipline and literary gifts. Muir, after all, founded the Sierra Club, and could converse with naturalists and politicians. Neither sentimentalized the natural world and had accomplishments outside of their naturalist activities. And their love of wilderness was grounded in keen observation and metaphysically moored.

A much needed upbeat note in the DVD is given over to a feature showing Herzog's encouragement of the musicians recording the soundtrack. Richard Thompson puts down some mesmerizing licks and tells you about it a warm, engaging manner. After watching Treadwell's solitary antics in Alaska, it was a tonic to see humans working together to make compelling art and enjoying the experience.",1185408000,9,1701,5.3632958801498125

Grizzly Man falls short as a biography because Mr. Treadwell was in no way great or inspiring.  However, he was nuts.  Those interested in seeing a self-deluded, poor man's Crocodile Hunter destroy himself may find some value in this film.

2427651,4,B000BMY2NS,"Timothy Treadwell was a troubled human being. He had always been a charismatic clown and misfit, barely able to hold down any kind of job. He made a short attempt at being an actor, proud of the fact that he was born the same day as Daniel Day Lewis; April 29th. He ended up being at liberty a lot, doing a lot of surfing, drinking, and drugs. A handsome man, he had no difficulty having an active social life.

At some point in 1990, at 33 years old, after a drug overdose that nearly killed him, he found himself on the Katmai Peninsula in Alaska, on a Federal Nature Reserve, swarming with grizzlies. He began to become ""friends"" with the bears, giving them all pet names. After several summers in a row, he decided he had a special ""feeling"" for the Ursus Horribilis. His broken dreams and sad life took on a new focus, and twisted a new direction. His life turned ""positive"", and from his perspective he morphed into a unique individual, the ""Grizzly Man"".

He returned to Katmai 12 summers consecutively. He had picked up a female companion and employee, Jewel Palovak. He decided to film his time with the bears, giving himself the starring role as ""Eco Warrior"". They created a non-profit organization called GRIZZLY PEOPLE, and they solicited funds to keep his ""research"" active. He began to consider himself as a ""bear expert"". His exploits were shown on the Discovery Channel, and on Dateline NBC, and he made an appearance on David Letterman. He took his show on the road, and he began to talk with school children, lecturing and entertaining them. He amassed more than 100 hours of film, always with himself down front doing absurd and dangerous things like standing off bears, or swimming with them, or trying to pet them.

Late summer 2003, at the airport, getting ready to come home, he got in an altercation with an airline employee, became incensed and decided to return to the Katmai. He had no business returning to the bear domain as food was less plentiful for them, and many of them were beginning to hibernate. He had a companion, Amie Huguenard, who was deathly afraid of bears. One night in October 2003, a rogue grizzly, an embittered old boar, came into their tent, and dragged Treadwell outside. It all happened in a flash, but Treadwell was able to click on his ever-present camera, but there was not time to remove the lens cap. The terrible audio recorded the bear killing Treadwell, and then beginning to eat him. He had screamed for Amie to run, but oddly she grabbed a frying pan and tried to fight the bear. The grizzly killed her too, and over the next two days he devoured and ate both of them. All that was found later of Treadwell was ""a head connected to a piece of backbone.""

A year later, famed director Werner Herzog decided to make a documentary about Treadwell. He reviewed the 100 hours of film, and trimmed it down to 103 minutes; over half of which were interviews with friends, compeers, and experts. He has directed 52 films since 1962. He is no stranger to documentaries -over a third of his movies are documentaries. Many of his other films centered on a protagonist who was mad, or was driven mad. A number of those films were done with manic actor Klaus Kinski, an artist with titanic talent and a fragile mental balance. Together they made AGUIRRE, WRATH OF GOD (1972), NOSFERATU (1979), WOYZECK (1979), and finally FITZCARRALDO (1982). Their relationship was rocky and tumultuous. Their cinematic collaborations were legend; capped with a Herzog documentary that chronicled all those years in MY BEST FRIEND (1999).

So Werner Herzog approached the Treadwell project with an affinity for this unfortunate misfit -this emotionally immature, posturing, arrogant, possibly bisexual and foolish man. But by the end of the project, the director seemed to take on a more somber pessimistic tone, suggesting that Timothy Treadwell's hubris, fearlessness, and ignorance finally cost him his life. The music for the film was composed by famed guitarist Richard Thompson. Herzog spent a long time doing hands-on direction of the musicians. He knows a lot about music, and the scores for his films reflect his knowledge. One of his films that reveals a bit of this expertise was THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE WORLD INTO MUSIC (1996).

Despite its sensationalism and sentimentality, I feel that GRIZZLY MAN emerges as a powerful piece of cinema. The reality of who Timothy Treadwell was, and his untimely demise at 46 years old continues to haunt me, and will not go away. I personally believe he was misguided, mentally challenged, and extremely, lethally foolish. This is a man who had to hide out from authorities, camping out on federal land, standing ""guard"" over grizzlies that did not need his assistance, who were already guarded by the boundaries of the reserve. These bears, while busy eating salmon and summer berries simply tolerated his antics and presence -until that late Fall day when one surly old boar decided to end the charade, and to give what Treadwell craved, a ""martyr's death"".",1185321600,7,5044,4.81199538638985

2427654,5,B000BMY2NS,"The biggest surprise of Werner Herzog's `Grizzly Man,' is the focus on the titled subject matter.  The animals are important, but wisely kept as second focus in favor of Tim Treadwell.  Tim was a filmmaker himself who tried to bond with grizzly bears until his tragic death when he and his girlfriend, Amy, were mauled and eaten by a grizzly in Kodiak.  Now this fact is established in the first few minutes and elaborated throughout the film.  Mostly, I went in believing that the film would consist of Treadwell's films mixed with commentary.  However, slightly over half of the material investigates their deaths and mostly his life.  The angles make this documentary so special and complete.  To establish an understanding of Tim the person, there are testimonies by Tim's former lovers, family, and friends.  As an investigation of his death, Herzog interviews an ecologist couple, the Park Service, and the coroner.  In addition friend and Bush pilot, Willy Fulton, has a great deal to tell us about both his death and life.  Everyone has something to bring to the table--even the hunters.  We first have to learn about the man; then we have to see what went wrong when he dared the ghost too long and too often.

One of the best perspectives offered is from Native Alutiiq museum curator, Sven Haakanson, PhD. who says it best:  ""If you look at it from my culture, Timothy Treadwell crossed a boundary that we have lived with for 7,000 years.  It's an unspoken boundary, an unknown boundary.  But when we know we've crossed it, we pay the price.""  Which is certainly a refreshing departure from the usual sentiments:  ""He died doing what he loved best."" Or having to listen to some conservatives invoking the death penalty like it was poetic justice.  (Imagine taking sides with an animal instead of a human!)  Herzog himself seems to invoke nature as cold-blooded.  Tim also articulates the harm's way he's put himself in several times, but he balances that--or unbalances that!--with a child-like exuberance for creatures he's seemed to project himself upon.  It's not that much different with pets, except Tim has a protective nature for the grizzlies like it was an extension of himself.  The other revelations are meant to unearth yourselves.

'Grizzly Man' is really about a man's passion, his vulnerability, his enthusiasm, but also his disintegration.  Like tracing bear paw prints, the movie does a marvelous and responsible job at reinacting a tragedy.  There was a second big surprise for me:  Herzog wisely leaves out the recordings that Treadwell unintentionally provided at the time of their deaths.  Having seen TV news magazines that have left nothing to the imagination, it's taken me this long to see this incredible documentary.  Herzog uses prudence.  And prudence is sorely needed.",1183852800,4,2809,4.993534482758621
2427655,5,B000BMY2NS,"Sometimes you eat the Bar---& sometimes, well, the Bar eats You., July 3, 2007
By  James Stephen Garrett ""Teep"" (Arkham Asylum) - See all my reviews

""Grizzly Man"" is the story of what happens when a Freak of Nature meets a Force of Nature.

The results aren't pretty. Tim Treadwell (the Freak) goes toe-to-toe with a young, hungry male Grizzly Bear (the Force). Bottom line: the Freak gets 187'd by the Force, who ends up using Treadwell's guts for garters (according to eyewitnesses, quite literally).

Long-haired Hippy tree-hugging dancing fools: Zero. Annoyed Alpha Male Bears: 1. The rest of us: 100!

Why? Because crazed, visionary film-maker Werner Herzog has effectively captured Treadwell's quixotic quest in his documentary ""Grizzly Man"", loaded it up with tons of raw footage, and served the demented---yet disconcertingly touching---story up smoking hot with his trademark fruitbat strangeness.

Herzog is a great choice to direct this one, considering the director's long-time obsession with crazy people. And Treadwell is a great subject: a naturalist! a teacher! a hiker! a conservationist! a King of the Sea!

By serving as a kind of mytic crystal revelatory channel to Treadwell's own peculiar brand of wonkish, Granola country wild-bore lunacy, Herzog's film serves as a fitting last testament to the man, additionally hooking up a kind of ephemeral shortwave radio into the craziness that---let's face it---made America what she is today.

The story is simple: Tim Treadwell---naturalist, conservationist, um, bear-itarian, crazy freaky monkey---loved the grizzly bears of Katmai National Park, in Alaska. Revered them. Adored them. Wanted to, uh, ""protect them"".

Think about that for a minute.

Treadwell probably tipped the scales at 150 pounds soaking wet, and a young male grizzly is looking svelte at around a ton, but Treadwell felt he needed to protect these brutes all the same. ""Protect"" them seems a little, well, insane, particularly when you get a shot or two of a couple of youjng male grizzlies unleashing a little jihad on each other around mating season, slapping each other in a playful ursine backhand that would leave a man's guts neatly delineated in a pile of bloody slop on the ground.

And that's when they were just playing.

Anyway, for 13 years, Treadwell spent the summer in Kamtai, ensconced in a pup-tent, fortified with some scant provisions, maybe a hand-camera & tripod-mount rig, a few camoflage do-rags, & a small army of stuffed animals. He had a stuffed bear, which gets quite a bit of air-time in ""Grizzly Man"", and serves as a fine example of what academics might call ""foreshadowing"".

He filmed himself. ""Grizzly Man"" is not so much the portrait of the grizzly in the wild, or a documentary about the Big Brown One's challenges in the rapidly shrinking outdoors (hey, Evolution sucks): it's really about a wild man living very close to the Edge.

Very close, until he slips over. And the joy of ""Grizzly Man"" is that through the film-footage and through Herzog's inspired interviews (was someone looting David Lynch's casting couch?), we get a very fine-hewn, very stark, gloriously intimate portrait of the man himself.

Treadwell let forth his barbaric yawp. He tried to bond with Nature in all Her howling Majesty. He tried to match his strength pound for pound and tooth by jowl with the furry grand eminences of the forest primeval, whose comradeship Treadwell wanted so desperately.

There is great tragedy here in watching this Holy Fool Treadwell stomp and fret and dance and rusticate amid the bears, and as the film winds down I can't help feeling Herzog's pessimistic conclusion is dead on: Nature is cold, callous, by-the-numbers. She doesn't do favors. Perhaps intelligence really *is* an evolutionary dead-end, in which we ponder how to save these beasts, this vast forest, this planet warmed, for now, by the furnace of a dying sun.

We invite them into ourselves. And they invite themselves to dinner.

2427656,5,B000BMY2NS,"Werner Herzog (who directed such classics as Aguirre wrath of god, fitzcaraldo, and the brilliant adaptation of nosferatu) has been making some fabulous documentaries in recent years.. He seems to be obsessed primarily with the bizzare.. In particular with people who have big dreams - and usually very absurd dreams.. I think Herzog, more than anything else, identifies with such people (afterall he worked in the most impossible conditions himself to create his greatest films)..
The subject of this film is Timothy treadwell a man who for a number of years actually managed to coexist with a group of giant grizzly bears..
Treadwell was an interesting often humorous figure who really meant well -but was driven over the edge by his own philosophy.. The man, as herzog claims, had a view of nature similar to walt disney.. while i think this claim may be slightly exagerated given the fact that treadwill actually did live in nature and must have had some notion of reality and the cycle of life - there is deffinately some truth to the fact that this man was slightly, shall i say, off his rocker.. As the film progresses and we learn a little about his background - we tend to wonder how much of a role drugs played in his early years.. I admit i had many laughs at treadwell's expense throughout the film - but that did not take away from the devistating notion of how he was killed..
Herzog's point of view in this movie is thought-provoking and highly subjective.. But it is his insistance on digging deeper and learning more that make this one of the most interesting documentaries i have seen..",1182124800,,1604,4.732142857142857
2427657,5,B000BMY2NS,This DVD describes the life and death of Timothy Treadmill. A sad yet inspiring movie. The cinematography of his interaction with animals is  second to none!!,1182038400,,158,5.076923076923077
2427658,1,B000BMY2NS,"Looking for insight into the man so fascinated by grizzly bears that he lived among them for years? Looking for reasons why he was invited to give lectures at schools? Looking for the information about the bears themselves that this man documented and the organization he founded to protect the bears and their habitat?

I was. Boy, was I wrong. That's not at all what this film is about.

This film is not a documentary, it's a propaganda piece made by people who don't know animals, for people they consider too stupid to know how to live.

Watching this film, you'd think director/narrator Werner Herzog has a personal vendetta against Timothy Treadwell. As a professional filmmaker, his job in skewing the facts had to be incredibly easy--Think about it: If you were to film your life like a video diary, like Timothy Treadwell did, with the basic assumption that no one would see the films until after you edited them, wouldn't you get a little crazy sometimes? And then if all your raw footage went to someone else to edit, couldn't they paint just about any sort of unsavory picture they wanted about you?

Timothy Treadwell supposedly had a view of the universe as full of love. Herzog says he sees the universe in terms of ""chaos, hostility, and murder"", and he apparently will go to great lengths to defend that point of view, because in this film there is nothing at all that explores Treadwell's point of view, but plenty of scenes selected to drive home the point that Treadwell was a raving nut case.

So, actually, we don't get to learn about the man's stated point of view, the life he lived, or the animals he filmed. What we do get reveals more about the filmmaker than about the supposed subject of the film.

Herzog is not afraid to come out and say that Treadwell ""crossed the line"" that Herzog believes MUST exist between humanity and nature, and Herzog does not like his lines crossed. The film is mostly dedicated to driving, hammering, pounding home the point that Treadwell's chosen lifestyle led to his death. Actually, that's about all this film is about--Treadwell is dead. 10 minutes into the film I was yelling at the screen, ""I KNOW he's dead, tell me something else!""

In his efforts to manipulate the audience, Herzog even goes so far as to find a person who never knew Treadwell and gives him extended screen time to go on and on about his OPINIONS of the man he never met. This is a hatchet job masquerading as a documentary.

Herzog even goes so far as to insert himself on screen, heroically listening to the audio recording of Treadwell's death and gallantly protecting everyone else from it. What else are you protecting us from, Werner? Do we need to be protected from the truth?

Herzog is at his most disingenuous when he decides that since he can't ""connect"" with animals, no one in the audience should think that they can, either. He picks an extreme closeup of a bear, and tells the audience that no one can see anything in its ""blank stare"". So there. Clip over, case closed, no one can ever connect on any level with an animal.

Anyone who calls this a documentary hasn't paid attention to it. It's an anti-learning experience. Herzog's bias in making this film is so overwhelming that no one can get any real idea of who Treadwell was--all they have is the ugly picture Herzog painted. From what I can glean, Treadwell doesn't seem much different from a great number of people who also have a deep, soul-based affinity for one sort of animal or another. Yes, Treadwell made some mistakes, but those should not be used to prevent us from knowing what drove the man.

But one thing is clear: Even though Treadwell is dead, dead, dead, he died doing what his heart said he should do. How many people actually live and die according to their heart's desires?",1181347200,5,3803,4.62759643916914
2427659,2,B000BMY2NS,"Treadwell is quie frankly a loser who turned to the outdoors to soothe his ego because he just didn't fit in. The film is intriguing because you do get a glimpse into what makes morons tick. It's kinda like watching a kid play with a book of matches near a gallon of gasoline. You want to do something, anything but nothing can help the kid. Treadwell is such a basket case and the only one in the film that calls it like it is, is a helecopter pilot who essentially explained the bears didn't kill him right off the bat because they probably thought he was ""retarded"" or something was wrong with him. In Treadwell's case, there was a whole lot wrong with him. This doc. vaunting his name only would have sent joy into his heart if he were around to see it. If he knew the fame it brought him, Treadwell surely would have considered his death part of his mission accomplished, too bad he had to sacrifice his girlfriend, too. The making of the music doc on the DVD is excellent because it shows Herzog was not necessarily a sympathetic story teller. An ode to goofy people brainwashed by the cult of fame. Treadwell was a zealot in that church. Some seriousness here, but much of it laughable at what a nimrod he really was. He was checking the temperature of bear poo, folks. Let's think about that for just a moment.",1180483200,4,1318,4.383673469387755

What emerges is a portrait of a truly unique individual; Timothy Treadwell, the man who spent 13 summers living amongst the grizzlies. Never exploitative, and never boring, Herzog seems to hope to learn about the Grizzly Man in much the same way he tried to learn about the bears. You really do have to see this film to believe it--astonishing.",1179446400,2,424,4.902777777777778
2427672,5,B000BMY2NS,"Timothy Treadwell loved bears. He loved them so much that he taught elementary classrooms about them for free. He loved them so much that he went and lived with them in a protected wildlife preserve for 13 summers. In that 13th summer, he outstayed his welcome and ended up being killed by one of the grizzlies, along with his girlfriend.

In the 13 summers that Treadwell lived with the bears in Alaska, he filmed 100 hours of footage. Director Werner Herzog has taken that footage, along with interviews with friends, family, bear experts, and others and pieced together the story of, as the DVD cover states ""A Life Gone Wild"".

Treadwell is so eccentric that at times it feels like you're watching a fictional film where the lead character is played by Crispin Glover. The way Herzog pieces the film together makes for an exceptional viewing experience because he starts out with all the kind, childlike, sympathetic clips of Treadwell and his bears and slowly begins to insert the footage showing Treadwell's more violent, fanatical nature. As we start to see more of the other side of Treadwell, we feel the despair of having lost a kind-hearted soul to discover that he's actually an extremely off-kilter man.

If nothing else, it can be said that Timothy Treadwell lived the way he wanted and lived where he wanted doing what he wanted. Whether he should have is another question. And it's definitely a tragedy that his girlfriend at the time, Amie Huguenard was killed with him following his mad lifestyle.

Herzog makes the discreet decision not to play the last 14 minutes of audio clip in which Huguenard and Treadwell are heard screaming while being eaten by a bear. Herzog could have easily based his film around such shocking footage, but instead, he respectfully declined to use it, instead featuring a clip of himself listening to the footage with Treadwell's ex-girlfriend, breaking down into tears himself, and then telling her to destroy the tape and never listen to it.

Overall, Grizzly Man is a stunning documentary that provides a brilliant study of a mentally unstable man and the effects of his life.",1179273600,2,2126,4.878116343490305

General opinion up here is that he got what he deserved, but took an innocent person and the animals he said he wanted to protect with him. Basically he was an idiot with a really good camera and a talent for shooting bears in their natural habitat, he should have overcome the urge to interfere with those animals and save the lives lost at his ignorance and stupidity.",1179100800,3,638,4.705357142857143
2427674,5,B000BMY2NS,"Grizzly Man is Werner Herzog's 2005 documentary about Timothy Treadwell, a man who spent 13 summers in a National Preserve in Alaska living amongst grizzly bears. At the end of his 13th summer in 2003, Timothy and his girlfriend were killed by a bear. Whether you like Treadwell or not, Herzog has crafted a fascinating documentary about the man who filmed his exploits over the course of his thirteen summers at the preserve. Herzog blends over 100 hours of Treadwell's footage in with interviews of people who knew him or knew of him. This is a Herzog film, so some of these people (notably the coroner) stand out as being a little quirky but you might not notice then when seeing footage of Treadwell.

Clearly Treadwell's passion and disregard for the dangers involved are what attracted Herzog to this project, as Herzog is known to be a very passionate man who disregards things that stand in his way. Through this footage and interviews with his close friends, we can deduce that Treadwell was a troubled man-child, slightly delusional but very passionate about the bears that he lived amongst. Deep down he was a good person, but a flawed one. When not at the preserve, Treadwell would tour schools and (free of charge) share his interaction with grizzly bears with schoolchildren. My own personal opinion of Treadwell is one of mixed feelings. It's hard to defend the sanity of someone who gets excited over bear excrement, but I admire his dedication (no matter how flawed it was) and in a way I find him an inspiring figure. Treadwell, in his footage, speaks frequently of death and how living amongst grizzly bears could lead to him dying but he seems okay with that. Although not on the DVD edition, but in the film at one point, Treadwell was interviewed by David Letterman who asked him if we would go on to read an article about how he'd been eaten by bears, a question he took with denial and good-humor. Love him or hate him, Treadwell died doing something he loved and was passionate about. How many people can you say that about? Unfortunately, Treadwell's girlfriend also perished in this mishap and, while this film does little to enlighten us about her story, she seemed more passionate about Timothy's passion than she did about bears making her seem even more tragic.

The film is narrated by Herzog is his wonderful German-accented dialect and emotionless delivery. Herzog has never been a conventional filmmaker and while his narration serves to inform us of the background of several scenes, he also uses it to give us his own perception of Treadwell. What no one can deny no matter what their thoughts are on Treadwell and his cause is that the man obtained some beautiful, ethereal footage. As Herzog puts it (and I'm paraphrasing) `No studio director could hope to capture images as beautiful as Timothy did.' Scenes such as a fox trotting up to Timothy unannounced in the middle of his monologue and a scene of two bears fighting achieve a very rough, real beauty that you can't find in even the most stylized, high-budgeted nature documentary.

Herzog's Grizzly Man is a great achievement in documentary filmmaking and one of the most accessible documentaries I've seen. Herzog takes Treadwell's footage and makes something exquisite out of it that I doubt Treadwell ever envisioned possible. While Treadwell reached a tragic and (no pun intended) grisly end, Grizzly Man is a very humorous documentary that treats its subject with both skepticism and respect. It's ultimately a haunting film and many images will likely remain with you. In the last bit of footage shot mere hours before his death, Herzog helpfully points out that Treadwell ""seems hesitant to leave the frame of his own film"" and watching the scene, I saw no reason to argue with him. Anyone expecting to see a video of Treadwell's death will be disappointed, as only audio exists and Herzog declines to use it in the film. While people are naturally fascinated by the morbid, we are told what happens on the tape so many times that Herzog's reaction to listening to it on-screen is effective enough to get the point across. While people may question the authenticity of the interview segments due to the strange, eccentricities of the people interviewed, my simple response would be: That's a Herzog film for you. Overall, it's a documentary that's not to be missed as it's a poignant, haunting, funny, and depressing film about a delightfully weird man who did what he loved to do and whether or not he was wrong or right to do so, he's a fascinating person that deserved this great documentary about him.

2427675,4,B000BMY2NS,"This is the fascinating story of Timothy Treadwell, a man who wanted to protect Bears from the threat he perceived came from us humans. Treadwell spent 13 summers in the wilds filming Grizzlys and shot over 100 hours of wildlife film.

The wildlife film itself is stunning. Grizzly bears are awesome creatures. At one point a large one stands up on two legs in front of Treadwell as he is filming. Minutes later when the Bear has gone Treadwell films himself standing in the same position and as he says the Bear on its two hind legs must have been 10 feet tall. From a wildlfe point of view this is a stunning film, but I would have preferred a

little more film of wildlife and little less of Treadwell.

The other side of the film revolves around the death of Treadwell and his girlfriend Amie by a Grizzly attack. There death was captured on audio (Treadwell had his camcorder running) and Werner Herzog wisely decided against putting the audio track into his film. We see him listening to it and this is disturbing enough.

Herzog has made a film that leaves you to make up your own mind about Timothy Treadwell. Both critical and appreacitive words are spoken about him in the film but I suspect most people will view the film and be grateful for the footage he shot, and be sad that he and his girlfriend were killed. There probably isn't enough information in the film to pass judgement on the rights and wrongs or validity of what Treadwell was doing.",1178064000,,1460,4.518939393939394
2427676,2,B000BMY2NS,"I was hoping to be inspired by this documentary. It was a disappointment. Timothy was a vain, deluded, paranoid man. His mission was ""protecting"" a species that is not in any danger, in a protected wildlife preserve, with a healthy population that in no way under threat. He suicidally invades their space and worse is directly responsible for a young girl's death.

 Treadwell was clearly a very lost soul and his delusions about the world seem sad and pathetic instead of endearing. Don't be expecting lots of great documentary footage of grizzlies either. The actual scenes of the bears aren't great, which is not so surprising considering he was an amatuer film maker working alone. The cover is very dramatic but of course no scene like this appears in the film.

 There is nothing really to recommend this in my opinion. Timothy is not a very sympathetic character. The filmmakers ""psychology 101"" lessons are irritating rather than insightful and we don't learn anything about the world or human nature. When a lunatic goes into the woods to play with bears he gets eaten. Did we need a movie to tell us this?",1178064000,9,1116,4.796875

Then naming the foxes around him names like Skydancer Rainbow (I can't remember the exact names, but yes, they were that bad).

Then later, hearing him talk about his troubles with women, and how he wishes he could be gay, had me rolling on the floor.

There are many more hilarious moments in the movie.  Some with foxes, one with a bumble bee, a rock, and of course, there is the poop humor too.

It is too bad that he got killed.  As disturbed as this guy was, his intentions, if not his actions, were good.  Even more tragic was the death of his ""girlfriend"".  She was just an innocent bystander in this whole ordeal.

I do think that despite his ""death by bear"", they probably extended his life longer than it would have been.  He probably would have overdosed long before his actual death.",1177459200,,1175,4.4392523364485985

I was fascinated by Werner Herzog's documentary ""Grizzly Man"" (2005) but its main character, Timothy Treadwell induced very controversial feelings. At first, I was very impressed by his love for the wild animals but further into the picture I began to understand that there was something unhealthy in his obsession, that he was deluded. He took it upon himself to ""take care"" of the grizzly bears, to ""protect"" them but I don't believe that they needed his protection. He needed them to make his life more useful and meaningful and nothing is wrong with that but in doing so he had crossed the line - he humanized them and he saw himself as the part of grizzly world. He kept repeating feverishly that he would gladly die for them and should he be killed by them he would not want any of them hurt. Well, it all ended tragically - he and his girlfriend (who joined him during the last summer) were attacked by a bear, killed and partially eaten. The bitter irony is that he had sacrificed not only himself but another human life. The bear that killed them, the very creature Treadwell was so in love with, was killed by the police the day after Treadwell's and Emmy's death. Many people say that he got what he deserved when he chose to cross the dangerous line and get too close to the ferocious animals. But he also got what none of us would get - he got Werner Herzog to make a documentary about him. Herzog used the footage (almost 100 hours) that Timothy Treadwell had shot during all these years. Herzog' was the only artist who could say so much and so well about man's obsession that borders with madness. He narrated the movie himself and he said that in his opinion the common denominators for the Universe are chaos, hostility, and murder - not harmony. Anyone who saw Herzog's films would agree with the statement. I just want to add that Universe in his movies radiates magnificent indifference (in the best case scenario), not warmth or love.",1176595200,2,1999,4.583798882681564
2427679,4,B000BMY2NS,"I think one major theme of this movie is that we treat animals like people, and that is wrong. Treadwell crossed that line continually and lost his respect (read: fear) for the bears by treating them like friends or ""stuffed animals"". Actually, we do this constantly in our modern civilization, and people (kids, often) get killed as a result of it. I think one way to read this film (and like all good films, there are multiple ways to view it), is to see it as a cautionary tale, that wild animals are not humans. I personally also hope that all the romantics and ""animal rights"" people watch this documentary. There is a reason that in every culture, there has been a firm line between animal and man. We might like animals and think they are our ""friends"", and think that they are ""family"", but in the end, they aren't really. All our attempts to make them coequal with us will fail, and that is our illusion.

I agree with the other reviews that this is a fantastic documentary: great shots, great interviews, great footage of bears, and of Alaska. The voiceovers by Herzog are amazing, and he always makes pertinent, incisive points.",1176163200,2,1139,4.610837438423645
2427680,5,B000BMY2NS,"Treadwell was a lost soul in search of a cause; at one point he wanted to be an actor but lost a starring role in a hit TV series (although later got his 15 minutes on the David Letterman Show which includes an offhand remark by Letterman about Treadwell being killed by a Grizzly...) and decided to become a hermit and a Saviour of Ursus Terribilis. He is an entertaining subject by virtue of his manic on-camera antics and his apparent fascination for the Big Bad Grizzly Bears. His penchant for giving them names and imbuing them with little personalities and cartoon-like foibles is a bit too saccharine and elicits some squirms.

These are not Disney cartoon characters, nor were they happy to have this hyperactive human living among them. The bears were fine before Treadwell declared himself their rescuer and defender and are fine now...no bears were being poached nor were they in the dangers Treadwell intimates.

He has one scene which is probably closest to his true persona where he has a meltdown on camera and just goes off on an enraged, over-dramatic speech and we see how truly disturbed this guy is.

He did believe he was literally saving these beasts, and he did get some great footage of them, but his own self-indulgent drama overwhelmed any potential benefits of these efforts.

The only sympathetic figure in this story is Amie who stayed with Treadwell despite her own well-founded fears, and interestingly, she had a far more pragmatic and accurate POV of these bears than he did.

Treadwell never did well when interacting with people in general, and on their way home after their last summer in Grizzly Maze, he and Amie were at the airport when he had a run-in with ""an obese"" airline employee which was enough to send the uber-sensitive self-described naturalist scurrying back to the bears, much later in the season than was wise.

At the end of the film we see Treadwell's parents, his mother holding his favorite childhood toy...a stuffed bear, the two of them sitting at their Florida home, looking bewildered at their son's final outcome and how it all came about. That moment is really sad.

Herzog made in impressive film about all this self-indulgent drama and really cared about his reckless star, being moved to tears listening to the audio recording of their last few minutes. It is horrifying to realize just how terribly Treadwell and Amie suffered, physically and emotionally, and how utterly unnecessary it all was and how easily it could have been prevented. Amie, of course, had the worst role of watching her lover being literally devoured by this rogue bear and being helpless to stop it.

The Greek Chorus of women who may or may not have been intimate with Treadwell are depressing, and their girlish, coy hints at a physical relationship are grotesque. One wonders; would they have been so devoted to Treadwell if he had been less attractive?

But kittenish females aside, the documentary is gripping and holds you rapt throughout; it is Herzog who turns Treadwell's footage into gold and makes it unforgettable.",1174780800,2,3066,4.85823754789272
2427681,1,B000BMY2NS,"I thought I was buying a documentary of a brave man, living among the grizzly's for research and his quest to save the grizzly's from poachers.  I was expecting enlightening footage of grizzly bears and beautiful Alaskan scenery. What I actually bought was 110 minutes of Timothy Treadwell bragging about how he is the most brave, wonderful, caring, loving man on this earth living all alone among the bears as their protector and savior. He even goes as far to boast what a tiger he is in bed. He claims to be transcended into a bear. Treadwell appears to me to be a narcissist,paranoid fruitcake and the only transcending is from a crazy man to a more crazy man. He interprets a smiley face drawn on a bolder as a threat against him! Every scene appears to be staged. He is definitely not alone as he claims but is accompanied by his girlfriend another deception.  The movie ends with Treadwell ranting and raving like a lunatic, practically foaming at the mouth like a rabid animal. If I were to give this movie an award it would be for the worst documentary ever made. I feel like a real sucker for buying it!",1174694400,7,1113,4.5049504950495045
2427682,5,B000BMY2NS,"Timothy Treadwell fits the profile of your typical suburban raised white liberal California transplant that people love to hate. Individuals like him spend their whole lives earching for substance or meaning in their sheltered lives by jumping from liberal activist cause to cause. Most are usually content in pursuing ""safe"" activism in organizations like PETA or Greenpeace. If some worthwhile wildlife protection organization managed to recruit Treadwell he may have become an invaluable, dedicated, and productive member. The main problem was that Timothy Treadwell's form of activism was also augmented by mental illness and an insufferable ego. Having been to Alaska several times in the past there are a myriad assortment of oddball characters who choose to live there. It's become a common running joke amongst the Alaskan population that the ""outcasts"" from the lower 48 tend to find refuge in the new frontier. I suppose this is one of the reasons why Treadwell's activities were never questioned by the public at large. This film's purpose is not a look into  environmental or wildlife protection but a journey into a deeply disturbed individual's mind and the eccentric company that he kept. Werner Herzog's vision is masterful as always as he blends his own tongue in cheek commentary with Treadwell's own. Critics of this film have complained about the hammy acted out interviews by Treadwell's ""friends"" and aquaintences but I believe this was done knowingly. Herzog may have fooled us all with the brooding music and tone of the film by producing a documentary containing an homage to his own brand of dark humor. By comparing this film with the one he made on Klaus Kinski it becomes readily apparent that Herzog doesn't expect us to take the subject matter and commentary too seriously. There's a reason why Herzog is considered one of the most respected and gifted filmmakers of our time.",1170979200,2,1907,5.131832797427653
2427683,5,B000BMY2NS,"Having just watched this film for the first time I feel compelled to write a review.  Firstly, I gave this film five stars because it is worth watching, for the simple sake of learning from the lessons (mistakes in my opinion) of Timothy Treadwell.  This movie is about much more than the bears, although they have my respect and I enjoyed the close-up, wild footage of these creatures.  This film portrays the mission of a bi-polar, anti-social man who feels his purpose in life is to protect these bears from anything and anybody who does not share the same wildly loving and affectionate feelings Tim has for them.  He truly feels he is Jesus to these bear: a savior of sorts.  He shows incredible love for them and in his mind thinks the bears share similar feelings towards him.

It is hard to say what makes a man have such unrealistic convictions as Tim does in this film.  As the movie progresses he becomes increasingly paranoid of the ""outside"" world coming to harm him and the bears.  He also shows more and more disdain for this outside world, as evidenced in some of his tirades.  I feel Tim is a man who was dealt many blows in his life and he did not know how to handle the failures of his pursuits.  He eventually turned to drugs, which only compounded his mental instability and he became more and more closed off to the larger world around him.

Perhaps he is smarter than I seem to be giving him credit for. After all this wannabe actor played the ultimate tragic figure on the ultimate stage making the grandest of exits.  In a way his life was one big tragedy, and I am sorry for that.

All-in-all I don't think he did those grizzlies a bit of good.  In his head Tim would believe he saved them from certain death at the hands of humans, but I don't think he would have physically stopped anyone from killing the bears.  I feel the park service does a fine job to enforce the laws of the park and they are the ones who are truly protecting the bears.

Even though you will probably disagree with the protagonist's approach (or antagonist, depending on your perspective) coupled with the fact that his fanatical convictions boarder of mind-boggling to the viewer, this movie is worth watching as we can learn from the mistakes of a near mad-man.",1170892800,2,2265,4.487804878048781
2427684,4,B000BMY2NS,"I think this whole movie had a sick feel to it, and it's fitting it did. It also was marketed in an exploitive way, with the cover art to the DVD reflecting that. There's no easy way to sum up the doomed Tim Treadwell and his brave, foolish, desperate, crazed, idealistic visits to the fatally-attractive ""Grizzly Maze"" in the Alaskan wilds, so I'll leave further analysis to others. What I will simply say here is that this documentary, assembled as I'm sure everyone knows, from the footage Treadwell left behind after his 2003 mauling death, makes for the sort of film you watch closely despite somehow not wanting to. The scenes captured are stunning and unlike anything one would expect to see, as Tim Treadwell lived among grizzly bears in their native habitat. We observe Tim sitting calmly within a few yards of bears as they eat, fight, rest, and at times investigate Tim right back.  I was struck at Treadwell's demented courage, even as I shook my head at his naivet, for he somehow seemed to believe the love he felt for these beasts would shield him against them. He spoke openly of the possible consequences of what he was doing but then again he so anthropomorphized the bears with sweet pet names that it was as if he never truly thought a violent end would ever come. Finally two concluding observations. One is I think more time should have been allotted to Amie Huguenard, who also died in the bear attack on that awful day, and secondly, German filmmaker Werner Herzog was probably the best possible individual to have combed through Treadwell's confessional-like footage in order to create this morbidly voyeur-esque tribute to a unique man who could rightly be described in many contradictory ways.",1170288000,3,1720,4.7912457912457915
2427685,5,B000BMY2NS,"In my work towards a sadly neglected German degree, film played an important role, and Werner Herzog's films were always a main topic of discussion.  Although his popular Dracula remake, ""Nosferatu"", piqued my interest, I yawned through the ""Fitzcarralldo"" and ""Aguirre Wrath of God"" that others found exciting.  Why was I stuck watching films about Latin America when I wanted to learn all I could about European mannerisms, laws, and culture?

Fast forward you don't want to know how many years, and I am flipping through my cable channels, caught by a documentary about Timothy Treadwell. I know of Treadwell because of a brief report on the news months before....some guy dumb and arrogant enough to think he could talk to brown Alaskan bears had obviously gotten what he deserved. But the dynamic parka-wearing, exuberant blond in the camera had me immediately transfixed.  Soon, I was hearing Werner Herzog speaking for the first time, interacting with those who knew Timothy Treadwell best, and those who had been as puzzled as I at first over why he'd done what he'd done.

The pairing of Treadwell's film with Herzog's gentle, sad and finally, truthful documentary handles this story in a way that doesn't paint the ""Grizzly Man"" (actually the bears that Treadwell camped among were brown Alaskan bears) as a caracature, but doesn't shy from showing his slipping toward maddness.  Even before Treadwell appears to dissolve into a kind of paranoia, Herzog separates himself from Treadwell by saying, ""Here I differ from Timothy, in that I don't believe he had a relationship with these bears.  I believe they were acting on instinct..."" (this is a paraphrase, not exact)

I have not been disappointed with the DVD.  Within the whole film, Herzog interviews parents, childhood friends, people who shared his love for wildlife, the coroner who worked on the bodies of Treadwell and his girlfriend, the pilot who had so often flown Timothy and Amy out to their campsite, and Alaskan natives who explain how they see their relationship with the brown bear and how puzzling it was to them that Timothy wanted to invade the bears' territory.

Thinking back to those older Herzog films, I can't help but see them as tales of creatures trying to push themselves into a setting, or push their ideals into a setting, that simply wouldn't have them.  ""Grizzly Man"" shows a gentler side of this philosophy, because we are given a chance to actually empathize with Treadwell in this film.",1170115200,4,2483,4.973429951690822
2427686,5,B000BMY2NS,"I gave this documentary 5 stars due to director Werner Herzog's outstanding efforts and the pure challenge of putting an accurate and complete perspective on who the grizzly man, Timothy Treadwell, really was. See Amazon.com's editorial review for complete plot synopsis as I don't want to repeat the entire plot line in detail here.

Herzog had complete access to over 100 hours of amateur video taken by Timothy Treadwell during his times spent at the Katmai National Park in the Alaska wilderness. Herzog not only uses some of the video footage shot by Treadwell himself for ""Grizzly Man"", but also intermixes interviews taken of Treadwell's parents, Treadwell's friends and former girlfriend, the coroner who autopsied Treadwell, and the airplane pilot that would drop/pick up Treadwell each year, etc. to give the viewers of ""Grizzly Man"" a more complete picture of who Treadwell really was.

Based on what I saw in this documentary, I think Treadwell is a Village Idiot! Yes, I think it is admirable that Treadwell loved nature and wanted to save the grizzly bears..... BUT Treadwell was an amateur, wildlife activist wannabe with no concrete knowledge about wildlife ecology let along any advanced degrees in biology, zoology, animal behavior etc. before heading off into the woods to live with wild grizzly bears. Let's face the facts here. Treadwell was a college drop, self admitted recovering alcoholic, unsuccessful actor in Hollywood, didn't have much luck with the ladies as he claims, and seemed very angry at society at large, and preferred living in the company of grizzly bears more than with people! Honestly, I don't know how Treadwell managed not to be eaten, mauled, or seriously injured by a grizzly bear sooner than he did. It is very sad that his girlfriend, Amie Huguenard, had to die the same gruesome death Treadwell did. What a tragedy.

I think the moral of the story here is to leave the interacting and observing of dangerous wildlife to the experts! I don't think it is wise for anyone to go around attempting to pet will animals (especially predators) roaming freely in nature, nor invading there space by approaching them to closely like Treadwell did.",1170115200,,2187,5.035911602209945

2427701,5,B000BMY2NS,"Let me preface this review with the following statement: I am a bad person.  That being said, this movie was freaking hilarious.  My friend reccomended Grizzly Man to me and I saw it knowing nothing about the movie or the story of Timothy Treadwell.  After the first scene where we hear Timothy talk to the camera my reaction was something along the lines of ""Man I hope this movie ends with him getting eaten by a bear"" (I told you I am a bad person).  Timothy is (or was) one of the most unintentionally funny characters I have ever seen in my life.  Almost everything he says is hilarious whether it be about his sex life, the fox that stole his hat, the park service people that are conspiring against him, or the deitys that he prays to for rain.  His incessant reiteration of his love for the bears at least hints at the possibility of an amorous love.  He interacts with the bears as if he was another bear (albeit one with a really girly voice).  The truth is, I could not feel bad for Timothy, only laugh and wonder why he did not get eaten sooner.

The comedy does not just end with Treadwell.  Timothy managed to surround himself with some of the strangest people and lucky for us, Herzog put them on film too.  His ex and the pilot that took him to live with the bears are both exceptionally odd and gave me some very good laughs (the pilot sings along with the last song in the movie, the scene and the song are awesome).  Timothy's struggling actor friend's account of how he found out that Tim had been eaten was also great.  His speech is riddled with cheesy dramatic pauses and fake sounding emotion that would make a soap star blush.

Werner Herzog wanted to make a film to give a meaningful picture of who Treadwell was and why he did what he did.  Timothy is portrayed as a sympathetic character and as the other reviews of this movie indicate, Herzog must have pulled this off for some people.  I, on the other hand, saw a bunch of hilarious monologues from a delusional nutjob(Herzog's ultra deep comentary about the meanings and roots of Timothy's actions just made it funnier).

I have written this review for anybody that was thinking about seeing this movie but was turned off by people's descriptions of it as some kind of masterfully-done, extremely compelling documentary.  Those of you who are turned off by such a description but would like to get some cheap laughs at the expense of weird people and a guy who all but fed himself to a bear, Watch this movie (Those of you who like to laugh at the more radical environmentalists and conservationists will probably enjoy it too).",1167955200,8,2609,4.479915433403805
2427702,5,B000BMY2NS,"One has to look at Tim Treadwell and his desire to be close to wild bears from 2 different vantage points.  On the one hand, here is a generally unhappy, alienated, recovering alcoholic spurned by his career choices and shortcomings (acting) who no longer finds any redeeming meaning structure in this fast paced, stressful, cold, artificial, money and performance-oriented capitalist world.  Many in our society feel this way, yet continue on to live lives of quiet desperation, 'anesthetized' by sports, drugs, alcohol, fast food, sex, porn, pop culture, TV, etc. etc.  What else can they do?  But Tim wanted nothing of the above, so he went on to live his ultimate soul-searching, healing fantasy far away from civilization.  For this, I greatly admire him.  On the other hand, you can't help but wonder if he suffered from some kind of delusionary mental abberation, stupidity, or both.  For he crossed a line that no truly sane man would.  Let's face it, living with wild, sometimes unpredictable bears that have been KNOWN to viciously attack and consume humans is certainly not a rational decision!  Did Tim's genuine love and regard for nature and Grizzlies blind him to this fact?  Either way, he and Amie met their fate in a very predictable fashion, and the tragic outcome was that 2 people, AND 2 bears lost their lives prematurely in a violent, bloody, senseless conclusion.

2427703,2,B000BMY2NS,"The subject of the film is obviously suffering from mental problems that cause him to shy away from the civilized world and to only feel a sense of belonging with wild animals such as foxes and bears.  If I had purchased the film and not borrowed it from the library I would almost feel as though I were exploiting someone with a mental defect.

My main issue with the film is that the director was biased in that he was attempting to cast the subject and his plight in the best light rather than a neutral tone that documentaries usually have.  This was to the detriment of the film because although the attempt was made to portray the subject as a conservationist, he simply came across as a crazy person.

2427704,4,B000BMY2NS,"Treadwell was comittable.  The guy was very, very disturbed.  Grizzly Man is painful to watch, because you just feel sorry for this wretched, broken and dillusional human being.

Werner Herzog pulls it all together in a more meaningful way then I ever could have imagined, considering the source material.  I am totally impressed with Herzog.

One thing I took from this movie, is how activism is often a very selfish thing.  Treadwell built up this totally false belief that he was a savior to these animals.  It gave him a reason to live and an engine for his narcissism (ie: 20 takes w/bandana & without).  He turned this awesome wilderness into a petting zoo, a mockumentary theatrical production.  It was offensive and disrespectful to say the least.

He so often referred to how he had ""protected them"".  First, he couldn't have protected anything, including himself.  Second, he only survived so long because it is the time of he most plentiful food for a Grizzly.  But the damage he did is hard to imagine.  Everything from acclimitizing the bears to humans, his wastes disrupting the ecosystem, the food he brought (which is almost certainly why the foxes were interested in him), the increased traffic and interest to the area, breaking, and glorifying the breaking, of the Park Service regulations.  Possibly inspiring others like him to such selfish and reckless behaviors.

I do believe that he ""loved"" these animals and wanted to help them... But at some level I think he knew his presence was detrimental.  But to give up what he did would have been his own [self] destruction.  So he put himself first, was this egomaniacal ""Prince Valiant"", got on TV and in the end killed himself and a bear he was trying to protect. Because in the end, it was all about him.",1165104000,3,1776,4.786184210526316

From what? The only scene we see is a tourist group trying to scare a bear away so they won't be harmed-pretty logical to me. This idiot goes swimming with them and tries to touch them. He considers them play toys and has no respect. He talks to them like they can understand them. He calls excrement ""poopie"", and ""going to the bathroom"" or ""taking a number 2"". He curses and swears about the people that made it possible for him to be there in the first place. There are just too numerous jokes in the whole movie. The coroner was a hoot also. Was Herzog really making a serious piece or was he in on the joke also?? The subject is a nutjob, the camera work pathetic but the music absorbing. Watch the making of doc on the music and skip the main feature. Unless you want to see one of the best unintentional documentary comedies of all time.",1164499200,7,1231,4.356521739130435
2427706,3,B000BMY2NS,"Timothy Treadwell was child-like, paranoid, a certifiable lunatic, and ""hell bent on destruction"" as his girlfriend Amie Huguenard described him.  However, Werner Herzog is a master at making different, visually beautiful, and very interesting films, and the ""Grizzly Man"" is no exception.  If anyone doubts that Treadwell--or ""Dexter,"" as he was called before he changed his name for theatrical reasons--is a fruitcake, just watch the film.  While Treadwell left the lens cap on his camera so all that is left is the sound from a four-minute film, in which a bear mauls Huguenard and him, Herzog's film is not sensational and he tastefully omits it.

It is a weird film about a weird guy, but Herzog brings it together in some coherent fashion, unlike the crazy rants of Treadwell's life.  Whether he was on drugs, or they had simply fried his brain--he admits to being an alcoholic, but he had apparently given up the bottle--the fact is that Treadwell was brave or crazy enough to live in Alaska's wilderness with the bears, until one ate Huguenard and him.  This film deserves three stars for the fact that Herzog brought the story to the silver screen, and less than one for the craziness of Treadwell's life.

To his credit though, Treadwell did live unarmed for 13 summers among grizzlies, foxes and the ever-swarming bugs.  However, one gets the feeling that somewhere along the way, he watched a few too many of Wildlife Warrior Steve Irwin's adventures on the small screen, and that Treadwell was an Irwin ""wannabe"" who was trying to emulate him.  Obviously the difference was that Irwin had perfected his art; whereas, Treadwell might have been an unknown except for his death and Herzog's film.  Both died tragically though and far too young.

Clearly the bears, foxes, and the beauty of Alaska are the real stars here, and a crazed Treadwell is merely an aberration who has floated into the area from God only knows where--perhaps an asylum for old hippies or druggies in the lower 48 States.  Among the bit players is a coroner, who seems to have a fascination with the macabre, but that is presumably consistent with his profession, like morticians too.  He is theatrical in his words and gestures to the point of openly ""auditioning"" for a role in some future film.

For those people who have never seen a Herzog film before this one, I recommend ""Fitzcarraldo"" with the late Klaus Kinski, Nastassja Kinski's father.  It involves hauling an enormous riverboat across a small mountain with aid from the local Peruvian Indians; and it is fascinating, and very unlike any Hollywood film you are apt to see.  I saw it years ago and seemingly will never forget it.  Herzog is a multi-talented and eccentric director, writer, producer and actor; and his extensive filmography is very impressive and worth reviewing.",1164067200,4,2825,4.913684210526315
2427707,4,B000BMY2NS,"Warner Herzog's ""Grizzly Man"" won the Director's Guild Award for best feature documentary, but the people who pass out Oscars apparently didn't agree. ""Grizzly Man"" was not among this year's nominees for Best Documentary.

Many of Herzog's narrative films, such as ""Fitzcaraldo,"" deal with man's attempt to challenge the indifference of nature, so ""Grizzly Man"" is not a departure by any means. Herzog's heroes are often obsessed with accomplishing some mysterious, even bizarre, goal. Timothy Treadwell's fixation is on grizzly bears. ""I am one of them,"" he is heard to say. He survived in the wild, accompanied by a video camera, and, on at least one occasion, by a girlfriend., living among the most dangerous beasts in the world whom he apparently believed he was protecting. ""Animals rule,"" he said, fist defiantly pumping in the air. ""Timothy conquered.""

Treadwell became a minor celebrity during his life, appearing once on David Letterman's CBS show, but he aspired to more. Before letting his love of animals consume him, he tried his luck in Hollywood. He got an agent, and auditioned for TV and movie roles. He was, he told his parents, second choice for the bartender role on ""Cheers"" which went to Woody Harrelson. Missing out on that opportunity left him ""crushed.""

What really drove Treadwell?

He reminds me of fey little Carson on ""Queer Eye for the Straight Guy,"" and as he openly mentions that it's easier to be gay than straight, I wonder if he was homosexual but unable to deal with his orientation, transferred his love of men to the roughest trade imaginable: grizzly bears. ""I like girls,"" he volunteers, but then he mentions various cruising places - truck stops, men's rooms - in such a way as to make me think he had personal experience haunting these kinds of homosexual hangouts.

He was also an alcoholic. Were his wilderness adventures an escape from passions he was emotionally and psychologically unprepared to pursue?

Those who are seen offering their remembrances of Treadwell never allude to his sexuality. They describe a man whose life is ruled by a naive, hippy, New Age approach to nature and who died as a result. The bears, to whom he gave names like ""Mr. Chocolate"" and ""Tabitha,"" need protection, he said, and he was their self-appointed caretaker. Others suggest that, despite his good intentions, he did more harm to the animals than he could have imagined. After Treadwell was eaten by a bear, the animal was shot and its remains became a feast for other forms of wildlife. Shooting a bear because he eats a man is comparable to shooting the customers at KFC for eating chicken. What is a bear supposed to do with a human who invades his turf? Treadwell was an intruder. One mans saysTreadwell made the mistake of thinking these were people in bear suits. But Treadwll knew these were animals. Trouble is, his knowledge of animals seemed to have been learned from Disney cartoons.

The universe, director Herzog says, is ruled by hostility, chaos, and murder. Treadwell had a different philosophy. ""Isn't that sad?"" he squeals in his high-pitched girlish voice as he observes a bee who apparently expired while doing ""his pollen thing.""

""I love that bee,"" he says.

Partially financed by the Discovery Channel, ""Grizzly Man"" is superficially a nature documentary about a man who loved wildlife so much that he felt at home among the bears and wolves more than he did his fellow humans. But it's also a portrait of a highly disturbed man who admits he was treated for manic depression but rejected medication to control the condition because, he admitted, he needed those soaring highs and crushing lows. He also needed to record his solitary life on video. We see him crying as he pets a wolf, laughing when his command that God make it rain seems to have been obeyed, and arrogantly blasting the humans whom he perceives as the enemy of the animals. What we do not see is his final encounter with the bear that ate him. Mercifully, the lens cap was on the camera when he was attacked. The camera was running, though, and Treadwell's screams, and the screams of his girlfriend, were recorded. Out of respect for his family, Herzog does not let the audience hear these recordings. Instead, we see him listening to the audio, and his reaction (telling one of Treadwell's friends that she must never listen to it, just as she must never see the coroner's photos of the aftermath of the attack), is possibly more effective than including the obviously horrific sounds in the film.

""I had no life,"" Treadwell said of his days before he began to frolic with ferocious beasts. ""Now I have a life."" That life is memorialized in Herzog's film.

I mention this because many people, I think, might buy the DVD thinking it's going to be on there somewhere.  No, the special features are crud:  no director's commentary, and a 50-minute documentary on the recording of the film's music, which is pretty much snoresville.

There are no other special features whatsoever.

And I love how Amazon makes it look like Amie Huguenard is ""starring"" in  it.  Sheesh.",1161734400,,1227,4.776190476190476
2427719,4,B000BMY2NS,"I won't recap the film but a few things struck me about it.  The portrayal of Treadwell was a bit one-sided, colored in my opinion by Herzog's ultimate disdain for his subject.  Even Treadwell's annoying self-absorbedness I was willing to forgive because we are ALL two people: our public selves and our private selves - this is something the director forgot to consider.  I would have liked to see the side of Timothy that won over people, got himself put on television, got girlfriends and lovers, got permission from Government agencies.  I would have even liked a notation about the fact that for some reason, that perhaps is beyond us, the man DID successfully bond with animals that COULD have killed him, but did not for well over a decade.  Indeed the killer was a rogue bear, not one of his bunch.

The hubris was something else that struck me.  Timothy's, in that he felt that he could be accepted and somehow control nature - nature creates and destroys at will and at whim.  And Herzog's that he felt he could sum up a person in a documentary that only truly delved into one aspect of that person.  Was Timothy a bit of a fruit loop?  Indeed.  Was he teetering toward insanity any more than the rest of us?  That can be argued.  In a documentary of our own lives, how many of us would come out smelling like roses and be generally liked by all?  Do we not all have our moments when we are raging at the universe about our disappointments?  And to me the REAL story of this man is that he traded in his REAL demons for this fantastical obsession that successfully brought him peace.

I don't think that it is poetic justice how he died.  Serial killers deserve to die.  Tryants and despots deserve to die.  Disappointed and unremarkable souls who choose an uncommon destiny don't DESERVE to die, they simply die as they do.  Judgement need not be inserted here because when the bulk of us die from either calamity (accident, murder, etc) or from disease (invited or not), will we have invited our death?  And in the end, shouldn't the life and OUR OWN FEELINGS ABOUT OUR OWN LIVES be ultimately where the judgement lies?

Timothy Treadwell died happy.  No bears were harmed (well two were, but he would not have had that happen) by his folly.  His girlfriend was not an unwitting victim - a prisoner to his madness, she was a grown woman with her own will and desire who CHOSE to forgo her own better sense to follow her boyfriend around.  Her fate is her own, not an addendum to his.  And Herzog has stroked his own ego pointing his finger at another.

Why aren't we all satisfied?",1160438400,9,2593,4.485042735042735
2427720,5,B000BMY2NS,"When an altruistic but deeply troubled loner remakes himself as an environmental activist, filmmaker, and protector of the grizzlies in Alaska's Katmai National Park, he embarks on a course that leads inexorably to a violent collision with nature. The filmed record of his countless confrontations with the creatures over 13 summers clearly shows not only their terrifying power - as when two adult males square off in a fight whose savage ferocity is almost beyond belief - but also their utter indifference to him.  Nonetheless, Timothy Treadwell believes that he has developed a congenial and ultimately trustworthy relationship with them. His misguided disdain for the boundary between bears and humans leads not only to his own death but to tragedy for others as well, provoking an emotional debate on the proper relationship between civilization and the wild. What makes Grizzly Man a stunning, one-of-a-kind film is the fact that it was assembled largely from Treadwell's own footage by the thoughtful German director Werner Herzog, who both appreciates the idealism of Treadwell's solitary quest and deplores his failure to understand the chaotic, deadly situation in which he put himself and his loved ones. Herzog's clear-eyed direction and circumspect commentary frame Treadwell's increasingly messianic bipolarity as respectfully as possible, freeing the viewer to weigh both sides and marvel at some of the most hair-raising footage ever taken in the wild - of both grizzly and the human animal.",1159142400,2,1508,5.389830508474576
2427721,5,B000BMY2NS,"My father was the person who first told me about this documentary. Upon hearing about it, I wasn't sure what to expect. I didn't recognize who ""Timothy Treadwell"" was and I don't think I had ever heard of Werner Herzog before (when I first saw the movie I almost fainted because I thought the former manager of the St. Louis Cardinals had made this film). After seeing the movie, I remembered that I had seen Treadwell before when he had appeared on television and I was corrected about the mistaken identity of the director. After viewing the movie, I was flabbergasted. It honestly is one of the most well-done documentaries about a person that I have ever seen.

GRIZZLY MAN is a movie about the life of Timothy Treadwell. Treadwell had performed several odd jobs during his life, but worked largely as an actor. At one point in his life he was one of two finalists for the role of ""Woody"" on ""Cheers"", but lost out to Woody Harrelson. Afterwards, Treadwell's life went downhill for a while until he discovered (or perhaps it was rediscovered) nature. I don't remember if GRIZZLY MAN explains how Treadwell became infatuated with grizzly bears, but he did. He began sneaking into a protected (and dangerous) area of Alaska to hang out with the grizzlies. He filmed many of these moments and must have believed himself to be a Steve Irwin of the grizzly bears. However, unlike Steve Irwin, Timothy Treadwell was not a trained naturalist, zoologist, and biologist. He hung out with the bears and thought they liked him; he believed he was one of them and he thought they did, too. The locals believed Treadwell was crazy and that the only reason the bears didn't harm him was because they could sense he was crazy. Treadwell was tragically killed in 2003 with his girlfriend by a grizzly bear. It was a bear he was not familiar with and one that had traveled far south in search of food.

Considering the material that GRIZZLY MAN was based, the film could have turned out terribly. In lesser hands the life of Treadwell might have been parodied and his life made to be a joke. Herzog does not do that. Instead, using interviews and footage that Treadwell shot himself, he presents a very revealing, compassionate, and moving film that captures the best and worst of Treadwell's life.

Documentaries are not for everyone, but this is one documentary that I highly recommend that just about anyone can enjoy. It is a fascinating picture about an eccentric and captivating man.",1158883200,,2476,4.726851851851852
2427722,4,B000BMY2NS,"What could've been sensational and exploitive given the subject matter (and highly ironic title), Werner Herzog's GRIZZLY MAN is instead a mesmerizing, perceptive and heart-rending account of Timothy Treadwell and girl friend Amie Huguenard's fateful attempt to live with and film Alaska's endangered, wild bears.

Their remains were found at Katmai Reserve in October 2003. They had been eaten by the animals they loved.

Culled from over a hundred hours of Treadwell's expert footage, Herzog fashioned a paradoxical portrait of a troubled, compassionate man seeking solace and understanding.

Was Treadwell a nave naturalist who lost touch with reality and died as a result?  Or was he an outcast who found peace for his feral soul in the wild and dangerous place he finally felt most at home?",1158451200,2,795,5.2362204724409445
2427723,4,B000BMY2NS,"A fascinating film- Herzog deftly combines Treadwell's own video footage (of himself, the Grizzlies and assorted wildlife) and interviews with various concerned parties (relatives, locals, park rangers etc.)  It is a gently paced, deliberately undramatized piece of work and yet it moves breathlessly to the brink of true horror more effectively than almost any Hollywood foray into that genre has ever done.

Herzog's brilliance as a film-maker is only let down by one jarringly stage-managed performance (that of the coroner describing the injuries suffered by Treadwell and his girlfriend at the hands of the bear) and one or two mawkish interviews in which Herzog himself seems to be playing for a Best Supporting Actor gong.

Treadwell's suicidal spiral into the ""Grizzly Man"" persona is riveting.  We are left with few answers as to the motives for his self-imposed exile from civilization (were they made more explicit elsewhere on the unseen footage?)  Treadwell is almost the perfect study for Herzog's fundamentally existentialist view of nature, the troubled human (with his grotesque psyche) railing pathetically at an amoral universe which will crush him almost as part of an unwritten pact.

The close-up of the eyes of the bear that will eventually kill him will stay with me for a long time- they seem to have passed an irredeemable sentence on Treadwell, whose foppish rantings he had endured far longer than any human counterpart would.

This brilliant film, with its eloquent soundtrack, is all the more poignant in the face of the death of Steve Irwin.  Don't miss it.",1157500800,6,1588,5.17578125
2427724,4,B000BMY2NS,"The legendary German movie director Werner Herzog's documentary `Grizzly Man' is not only about its immediate subject matter, the life and death of Timothy Treadwill, a nave, self-styled up-close observer of wild bears in the wilderness and the extensive video that he took of his own adventures - it's also an immensely inspiring ode to moviemaking itself.  Watching it, you can really feel how much Herzog loves making movies - he loves the process, the craft and the art of it all.  It may be strange to admit, but as harsh and unyielding as the subject matter is, I actually left the movie feeling happy - it kind of makes you fall in love with movies again.  It was fascinating seeing how Herzog may have disagreed with Timothy Treadwill's take on his relationship with/vs. nature, but what was inspiring was how much he genuinely respected Treadwill as a ""moviemaker"" - almost (and I mean this unironically and sincerely) like Tim Burton's similar admiration of Ed Wood in his fictionalized account of that maverick moviemaker's life - they may be looney souls, but their commitment to living their lives their own way and using their cameras to do their own thing is absolute!  (In contrast to the often florid and bombastic use of Wagner symphonies in Herzog's other documentaries, the wonderful guitar-driven score by famed musician Richard Thompson only heightens the affectionate and warm approach of this movie to its resolutely unconventional 'main character.')

My girlfriend and I talked about it afterwards, and at first she thought that Herzog and Treadwill were at opposite ends of the philosophical spectrum as regards nature and the universe - but I thought that Herzog is very much of a centrist, grounded and rational POV - he, unlike Treadwill, acknowledges the danger and savagery of nature, but he also acknowledges its profound beauty.  It's that contradictory aspect of reality that Treadwill's ""flower child"" POV was obviously never able to grasp, nor wanting to care to grasp.

I may have thought in some of his previous documentaries that Herzog went a little over the top with his own commentary, but I really must say that I've never enjoyed or appreciated his commentary as much as in `Grizzly Man' - I thought it was beautiful and eloquent and expertly and tactfully done.  I love how Herzog shows Treadwill ranting and raving into his own videocamera, cursing at the Park Service that he once belonged to, and then overlaps his (Herzog's) own commentary over that, to point out where he personally feels Treadwill's diatribes mutate into something beyond themselves, into a furious screed against human civilization itself.  I love the sequence where Herzog films the jagged glaciers of the national park and remarked that they were ""a metaphor for Treadwill's tumultuous soul.""  And it's inspired to keep cutting back and forth relentlessly from Treadwill's footage to testimony about his death from the coroners, townsfolk and family and friends as constant counterpoint.  The movie is so beautifully and powerfully edited that as grim as the subject matter may be, the dazzling technique heightens the immediacy of every moment a hundredfold; almost every moment we see Treadwill alive, it feels like it may be his last minute on earth.

The easy thing to say about Treadwill (as so many people had done) would be to write him off as just another drug casualty (like the airplane owner in the movie who mocks Treadwill's wanting to bond with the bears as if they were all ""children of the universe"").  But on the contrary, I think 'Grizzly Man' is a beautiful and deeply felt movie because Herzog can disagree so fundamentally with Treadwill's POV, and yet see the nobility and beauty of his aspirations, not only the tragic folly that resulted from them.  (If I can't say that the movie is a masterpiece, it's only because of my own personally being annoyed with a great deal of Treadwill's own personality - he seems like a nice enough guy a lot of the time, alright, but he also seems like the kind of fellow that you might run into at a party and talk with him for a bit, and then die to be left alone after awhile when he doesn't shut up with his preaching and generalizations and super-sentimental worldview.)  Herzog can see Treadwill's lunacy for what it is and also sympathize that perhaps it is better to be a damned fool and be happy, than live a dull and bland and unextraordinary life. Treadwill may indeed have been a misfit and mediocre amongst general human society. But out in the untamed wilderness, he discovered not just the glorious beauty of nature, but personal happiness and positivity and self-worth - if only for a fleeting and all-too-temporary 13 years, until his and his last girlfriend's Amie Huguenard's brutal final moments.

Last but not least, Treadwill's video captures a see-it-to-believe-it bear `fight' sequence with two adult male grizzlies going at each other that literally has you gasping, ""holy mother of god!!""  (How Timothy Treadwill wasn't quaking in his boots at the thought of coming within 100 feet of any bear after filming this is truly beyond my comprehension.)",1157241600,7,5151,4.936416184971098
2427725,5,B000BMY2NS,"Werner Herzog in the course of his long film career has consistently sought to present men at the very fringes of society, men who do battle with their inner demons whilst battling the insurmountable odds represented by nature itself. In this search, Herzog has taken himself to some of the most inhospitable terrains in the world, but little did he know that he would find the total apotheosis of this thematic concern in over 100 hours of material that was pre-existing and filmed by Timothy Treadwell. Herzog locating this material and making this film, puts into question all of the films he made in the hellish jungle locations he opted for and all the odds he overcame, because Treadwell has done all the work for him, which includes the unhappy ending.  That Herzog should compose a huge percentage of his film out of pre-existing material, shows a post-modern concern with the appropriation of modern technology and as a result gives his film a reality never before seen. ""Grizzly Man"" is a unique and original film precisely because nobody else did what Treadwell has done, and as a result it highlights perfectly that the documentary form is perhaps the only film form that can have a serious claim to originality. But this is not the originality of an artist, but the originality of a somewhat misguided anti-hero, who genuinely thought he was at one with the bears in their own habitat. It is easy to sentimentalise the life of Treadwell, but Herzog's film illustrates the man as being all ego, as he preens and poses in front of the camera. He creates a persona for himself, in order to avoid the harsh realities of our world, and in so doing stepped over an invisible line into a territory that man has no place within. Herzog's voice over and argument is one which dates back to his feelings when he made ""Fitzcarraldo"" and its quite surprising to learn he hasn't changed much since then. The narration provides balance, condemning the arrogance and borderline insanity of Treadwell, but at the same time respecting his self styled eco warrior image and his ability to film some remarkable imagery that comes close to the inner truth that Herzog has sought throughout his career. In terms of Herzog's cinema, this is a masterpiece, but a huge amount of the credit for this would go to someone who is no longer here to enjoy it.",1157068800,2,2342,4.740196078431373

2427728,2,B000BMY2NS,"...but only a short way in, I found myself irritated and repelled by its subject: not bears, but a weird, ranting, self-aggrandizing little man named Timothy Treadwell. He claimed to be ""protecting"" grizzly bears, but he was clearly a victim of magical thinking who wanted, by associating with powerful animals in a wild place, to somehow absorb their mystical life-force.

By mid-way, I was out of patience with Treadwell. I could find no sympathy for his ignorance and pretension, and very little for his mental illness. His downward spiral was inevitable and painful to watch. It was no tragedy; I experienced no catharsis of pity and fear. It was appalling rather than edifying, a portrait of arrogance and stupidity and insanity.

In the end, long after it was clear that the man was a deluded narcissist who needed to be locked up for his own safety, his codependent girlfriend continued to aid and abet his obsession. Of course they both became food for the animals they so foolishly considered cuddly companions. They won the Darwin Award, which is probably the only prize this film should have won.

Herzog's a great film-maker, and I'm a huge fan of just about everything he's put out, from early work like ""Aguirre: The Wrath of God"" and ""The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser"" to such recent releases as ""Rescue Dawn"" and ""Encounters at the End of the World."" However, ""Grizzly Man"" wasn't directed so much as it was simply edited out of found video footage.

As a narrator, Herzog's reflections were trite and unilluminating. He inserted himself and his views of nature into his production far too often and showed through his remarks about Treadwell that he had little or no critical perspective on his subject. All in all, a pathetic and unpleasant film, one I cannot recommend.",1156291200,2,1783,4.874587458745874

2427730,5,B000BMY2NS,"Unfortunately, this movie is brought down by many one-star reviews that are attacks on Timothy Treadwell, not comments on the movie itself.  Hopefully, this review will balance the scales a bit, and discourage such abuse of reviews in the future...

This is really a film by two filmmakers... Werner Herzog, and Timothy Treadwell.  Treadwell is the infamous ""grizzly man"" who lived among the grizzly bears of Alaska for 13 years, until he and his girlfriend were killed and eaten by a bear.  For the last five years, he brought video equipment along and shot movies of the bears, and himself.  He saw himself making a movie about the bears, but really, he was making it about himself.

Herzog is also making two films, in a way.  First, he is assembling and sharing Treadwell's work.  As a filmmaker, Herzog admired Treadwell as a ""methodical"" and dedicated filmmaker who captured exquisite and deeply moving images of the bears he loved.  Second, Herzog created a character study of Treadwell as a person.  What many reviewers here fail to comprehend is that Herzog feels no sympathy for Treadwell.  He considers Treadwell to be a delusional romantic, descending into paranoia and madness from the cognitive dissonance of his romantic imagination colliding with reality.  Herzog, being a stoic German existentialist, sees both bears and humans as heartless killers in an uncaring universe.  Herzog, however, is too good a filmmaker to be completely judgemental.  He balances the opinions of various people who knew Treadwell, along with Treadwell's self-filmed footage, and lets the viewer judge the goodness or badness of Treadwell's life personally.

The combination of Treadwell's own footage, Herzog's editing, and Herzog's interviews make for an extraordinarily beautiful and moving film.  Unfortunately, it is also a difficult film, and most viewers apparently prefer to watch it through the lens of their own prejudices, be they romantic environmentalists or conservative self-styled realists.  I recommend trying to watch the film as a FILM, separating your judgement of Treadwell from your judgement of ""Grizzly Man"".  You'll find it rewarding.",1155600000,55,2154,5.303834808259587
2427731,5,B000BMY2NS,"I would take issue with reviewers who characterize Herzog as being generally sympathetic with Timothy Treadwell.  I believe that Herzog regards Treadwell in much the same way he regards Klaus Kinski --- remarkable in one sense, but ultimately an impossible human being.  Herzog's veiled references to Kinski (during Treadwell's extended, profanity-filled rant about the Park Service) are hard to miss if one knows the background.  Herzog admires Treadwell as a film-maker, one craftsman to another, and there is no denying that much of Treadwell's footage is quite remarkable.  However, it takes a rather skewed perspective to believe that Herzog has taken up Treadwell's banner in any sense.

Herzog makes clear that his view of nature differs sharply from the fantasy-land notion of nature that Treadwell constructed in his mind.  It is one of the few occasions that Herzog goes on record as specifically disagreeing with Treadwell, but Herzog's choice of footage allows Treadwell, through word & deed, largely to damn himself.  It should obvious to almost everyone that anthropomorphizing bears & foxes really isn't a very good idea at all, on multiple levels.  Treadwell's almost-disbelieving response when he finds animals killed, not by the poachers he was convinced were hidden in every copse, but by other animals, makes it pretty evident that his view of Benign Nature was largely divorced from reality.

Herzog also observes that while Treadwell may have been dwelling in some type of Make-Believe Nature World, he was nonetheless quite canny and aware of the image he had carefully constructed and contained.  The conspicuous absence of the assorted girlfriends who accompanied him, as well as the multiple well-rehearsed takes and framing of shots, shows a man who had a very clear idea of what he was doing...at least on one level.

Ultimately, what this film left me with was Herzog's examination of ego run amok, leading ultimately to a self-ordained destruction.  To me, Treadwell never seemed to approach fulfillment or anything approaching happiness, and don't think Herzog sees this in Treadwell either.  One is left then with an ego-driven belief in one's own importance and imperviousness, and where can that lead but hubris?  Even without knowing the background of Treadwell's story, one is certain from the first frame that Treadwell is screwed big time.  It isn't a question of things ending up badly; we've seen this before from Herzog.  It is the journey to the ultimate disaster which interests him.",1155513600,8,2526,5.230769230769231

2427733,1,B000BMY2NS,"I must tip my hat to James S. Robles's review as he pretty much described what this documentary is about exactly, almost to the point where not much else needs to be said. However there were a few things that bothered me about this film and being as analytical as I am I believe the truth really needs to be told about Timothy Treadwell.

Firstly, this film is so watered down it's ridiculous. The viewer discretion warning at the start of the film is not warranted for many reasons. All photos of the human remains and are blurred, now I'm not sadistic by any means but I think it would of been an important part of the film to show what can be done to a human being by a bear if only to serve as a harsh reality check to the public. Secondly the audio tape of the killing was not played, again I'm not one to get off on people suffering but they show someone else listening to it deliberately to entice the viewer into forever wondering. There's no good reason not to play it period. Thirdly there's an Ecologist, who is obviously a Liberal, reads out some hate mail he received from a crazy far-right republican. Why on earth was this included? What relevance does this possibly have to the film and its contents? As soon as I saw that segment of the film which is played right near the start, I lost all respect for the film maker in an instant but continued to watch purely out of interest for bears. There was no good reason to include politically motivated propaganda in this film what so ever, that's a straight up stupid move on Werner Herzog's part and he does not deserve the positive recognition that he received for this film at all. It amazes me sometimes how politics can be pulled into the most random, unrelated topics... Herzog should be ashamed of himself for that.

Now the truth about Timothy Treadwell needs addressing. This guy is not a dedicated conservationist as many would have you believe. He's a lonely, delusional, paranoid striving for fame after a failed career as an actor; it's that simple. He felt sorry for himself, got hooked on drugs and overdosed which no doubt caused some serious brain damage in the process. After his near death experience from drug abuse he had an ""epiphany"" or a metal breakdown, call it what you will. Feeling like an outcast from society and unable to face the real world and the fact that he's a failure he headed for the wild to live with the bears, quite literally. He faked his origin of being from Australia which he obviously is not, I think in a desperate last ditch attempt for fame to become the next Steve Erwin. Fact check idiot, there's no bears in Australia. That's it really, there's no wonderful story of a man wanting to save the bears as even when confronted with a situation where hunters were harassing a bear by throwing rocks at it he did absolutely nothing!

Another part which really annoyed me is that they killed the bear that ate him and his girlfriend which is damn right wrong! That bear did nothing wrong except get a good meal, and what's their response to this? To chase after it with guns! The irony of this film is so insane in many respects. A 28 year old bear lived that long only to be killed because of Timothy Treadwell's insane behaviour. More irony follows, as he verbally abuses the National Park for creating the laws set in place for the very purpose of protecting the bears he apparently loved so much! The irony continues as just hours before his death he states on camera how he's become ""one"" with the bears, and that he's survived in the wild because the bears realize he loves them. What was this guy smoking? It's almost funny in a sick kind of way that he was eaten only hours after he claimed that if anyone else attempted what he did they'd be dead. That basically demonstrates to the viewers that he is exactly like anyone else stupid enough to live with bears, you'll die.

Don't mistake Timothy Treadwell's love for wild animals as true compassion. The motivation behind his actions were purely self serving and in no way, shape or form for the benefit of the bears but more the benefit of himself period. Being an outcast from society he longed for the feeling of being wanted and in his mind living with the bears gave him some level of importance and purpose in life as delusional as that may be.

The reality is this; Timothy Treadwell was nothing but a mentally disturbed guy who failed at life and lost his way and got eaten by a bear because he's stupid. There's no deeper meaning to Timothy Treadwell, and if god is real as said in the film he would not love Timothy for what he did. Instead he decided to swat him down like a fly and send a message to us all; when you go crazy and lose your mind seek professional help and take your meds, don't go live with wild animals that want to eat you for dinner.",1155427200,21,4832,4.43082114735658
2427734,5,B000BMY2NS,"It's been several months now since I watched GRIZZLY MAN, and it just won't leave my mind.  First, it is NOT a documentary about bears; it is about the contrasting points of view of Timothy Treadwell and Werner Herzog.  Unlike Treadwell, who views nature in utopian, teddy bear terms (Treadwell actually takes his childhood teddy bear with him on his expeditions), Herzog sees nature as chaotic and dangerous.  Yet Herzog, a master at what he does, is never judgmental.  He portrays Treadwell, rather, as a kind of innocent whose death, while not a surprise, is nevertheless genuinely tragic.  Watching the story evolve, one begins to wonder about Treadwell's mental state during the time he was filming his own ""documentaries.""  Was Treadwell an innocent or was there a darker element involved in his choices:  Was he mentally unstable?  Herzog never says for sure; he leaves it for the audience to decide.  This, I think, is what makes the film so moving and unforgettable.  Herzog invites us into Treadwell's world but never tells us how to feel or what to think.  Rather, Herzog takes us out of our comfort zone and makes us deal with ambiguities.

Moreover, the music is hauntingly beautiful.  The DVD includes a feature about how the music was created, Herzog calling all the shots from which musicians to use (none of the musicians had ever worked together before GRIZZLY MAN) to how the right tone should be struck for each scene.  Watching the amazingly talented Richard Thompson create and play is a real treat.  GRIZZLY MAN is a highly sophisticated film and will not disappoint those with an open mind and those interested in the modern philosophical view of nature.  Highly recommended.",1155340800,12,1699,4.929577464788732

2427736,5,B000BMY2NS,"Timothy Treadwell did love animals and I think he was very idealistic. And sadly, I think with his idealism was some sort of mental illness. I think he was bi-polar. He admitted he liked his emotional ups and downs. At times his rants against the government and civilization was funny, touching and sad all at the same time. Perhaps I saw a little of myself in him since I have had (and will continue to have) similar rants. Just pure anger and frustration at the world. His ""salvation"" in the long run killed him. Died by one of the bears he loved. Watching this movie, it seems bound to happen, I just wish that his girlfriend wasn't with him and shared his fate.

He couldn't accept animals being themselves, the killing and torture that they inflict on each other. He had this view of the universe being in nature and harmony. The Director Werner Herzog of this film sees it differently. He sees the universe as in constant chaos. To me, it's a paradox. There is chaos in the harmony, harmony in the chaos. We are all one, yet still separate at the same time. An Native American museum curator said his people (Inuit?) lived there in Alaska for 7,000 years and knows that the bears and humans have their own worlds and left each other alone.

I think Timothy had a good heart but I think trying to become one with the bears was foolhardy and sadly what happened was his ultimate destiny. He's not a hero in my eyes but a tender soul who didn't respect nature's boundaries.",1154390400,3,1476,4.462962962962963
2427737,5,B000BMY2NS,"This is an amazing documentary/biography about an eccentric bi-polar man who found his own little salvation and meaning in life through his misguided work with the bears.

Alot of people who gave this movie a 1 and criticize it due to the actions of Timothy miss the whole point of the movie. It never makes Timothy out to be a hero, it never says his actions are correct or smart. If anything the movie delves into Timothy's problems with authority, his extreme swings in mood, his bi-polar nature and the way it affects his ability to cope with life.

The movie is not about bears. If you rented it expecting a documentary about bears you really need to learn to read closer and not blame the movie (with a rating of one) because you could not figure out a movie called Grizzy MAN was about the man more then the bears. Going into this movie knowing what it was about I found it to be a great movie. It is quite a sad story, a man whose heart was really in the right place, thought he was doing the right thing and yet his actions were misguided. He was clearly on the path to his own self destruction the whole time.",1154131200,,1119,4.298578199052133
2427738,5,B000BMY2NS,"Many reviewers show their ignorance and prejudice regarding this film: in the chauvanism re: Amie's death (that a 37 year old woman with relevant wilderness and bear experience was somehow not capable of making her own choices, even a mistake--to go back too late in the season when they were at the airport ready to leave--all contextual facts left out of Werner's film); in the smug arrogance that just because someone is bipolar they are somehow not credible human beings much less the geniuses they really in fact are; and in the lack of wilderness experience and knowledge of the natural world that urbanites simply cannot comprehend that allows them the smug delusion that Tim ""asked for"" or ""deserved"" the death he happened to experience, or that he ""intruded upon"" the bears territory or even that he ""broke the law.""  True, without context and some pretty darned important facts (facts Werner couldn't or wouldn't squeeze into his film or bonus features) most viewers of the film wouldn't know any better and might easily come to these or similar misguided and misinformed conclusions about Treadwell's life and death.  But knowledge is power and knowing more about Tim and what other bear experts and native people thought of him, the outtakes Werner's film omits, enhances the experience of Werner's film.  It allows the viewer to see Werner's POV as Werner's and not the only or definitive approach to Treadwell's life or experiences.

The film also poignantly reveals our own prejudices and ignorance about nature and ourselves as a species, part of nature herself.  Tim, like his friends, behave trippy dippy in the film, and in other interviews, in ways that non-Californians perceive as classically Californian.  I live in CA and know lots of trippy dippy types, but that should not discredit Tim or his friends' perspectives on him.  It's reflective of non-Californian arrogance that allows others to take specific human distinctiveness as a broad credibility cue.  Tim was bipolar and his choice to not medicate is legitimate.  Lots of bipolar people make that choice so they can function with their genius.  On medication they're ""flat"" and cannot work or be creative.  I realize that terrifies non-bipolars but such fears are their problem and they ought to get over their fear of what they don't understand in people who are wired differently from them.  Will BPers off meds make bad decisions?  Sure.  A good e.g. is that Tim went back to the Maze when he should have headed home and, in fact was at the airport on his way home.  An altercation with a ""farmer"" mindset airport agent set him off and he made a poor choice to go back.  Amy made a choice to go with him. They died as a result.  That's life, plain and simple. It takes an urban mentality to judge that negatively or to insist it must be negatively judged.  It would have been great for Werner's film to mention that level of contextual detail.  It doesn't but that's okay too.

I wish there was more bear footage from Tim's library.  I hope Grizzly People release more of that along with the 1000's of still images he created out there.  Still, Werner's film is a good one, and the humorous stuff like the goofy coroner... what a howl!  Well worth purchasing.  But read about Tim, listen and pay attention to the controversies and the agendas and you'll see everyone's darker, fearful sides... then see the film and it'll sit better.  If the death and all that still freaks you out... you live indoors too much.  I've been in bear country many times, and only once had a bad encounter.  Yes, it scared, and still scares the crap outta me, but that's just part of being alive.  If you are truly human you must, absolutely must, accept that risk of death, and your fears, real or imagined, and get on living in spite of all of that; it's all just part of being human.  I had to laugh at the Alaskan reviewers who defame Tim and the film, basing this on their ""wilderness"" clout--clout obtained with a gun, and experience not much more than that of their urban cousins.  Their own agenda is showing.  And that's a very good thing.  It gives us experience as important as the film itself: context.",1153872000,7,4178,4.743767313019391

2427751,4,B000BMY2NS,"Timothy Treadwell's life and death in the Alaskan wilderness. He spent the better part of 13 years with the grizzlies, unarmed and completely unprotected.

This was an odd, yet completely engrossing, documentary. Timothy Treadwell related better to the brute force of wild nature vs. the sometimes subtle force of human nature. By his own admission, he preferred the company of the bears to that of humans, even mentioning the foreignness of the human world in his own diaries. He could talk to the bears in a way that he never could speak to humans. He was more afraid of being hurt emotionally by humans than he was of being hurt physically by bears.

I have no doubt that he passionately loved the grizzlies and honestly wanted to protect them, but he romanticized his relationship with the bears to the point that he no longer thought of them as wild animals. Which proved to be a fatal mistake - it's no surprise that his death was at their paws, so to speak.

Werner Herzog does wonderful and sensitive documentary work, even when his subjects may not be the most sympathetic of characters (I personally found Treadwell downright stupid at points). Through interviews, and Treadwell's own film footage, he constructs a portrait of a tortured, confused soul that's more complete than anything you're likely to read in the press about this man, who, quite frankly, can come off as a complete loon.

Also worth noting is the Grizzly People, an organization founded by Treadwell and other grizzly devotees. The organization does good work for the grizzlies and the preservation of their habitat.",1152662400,9,1597,4.9037037037037035
2427752,5,B000BMY2NS,"I have to say that I am really disturbed by those who are saying that Treadwell got what he deserved in the end. And kind of amused by those saying that they expected this to be a documentary focusing on grizzly bears. (Read the DVD box, I say!)

For those saying that he got what he deserved, consider this. Did he ever intentionally go in to harm these animals or did he only want to connect with them and protect them from those who would? His methods were no doubt, balls out and pretty insane, which was explored, through Timothy's own eyes, in detail. What DOES make a man want to go out and live amongst the grizzly bears and attempt to befriend them? That's what makes this documentary so mesmerizing. Herzog does an excellent job at piecing together the footage that Treadwell left us to depict him in the most human light, the most fallable, the most lonely, the most good-intentioned. It is a study of a man that leaves in his legacy not the fact that he was brave enough to live amongst the beasts, but sad and hollow enough to make it his religion, his salvation. Herzog goes into this from a psychiatric perspective as well, comparing one of Timothy's rants to the camera to one of Klaus Kinski's meltdowns during his work with him. Out of control manic revelations and egocentric grandiosity.

No one should make Timothy a role-model or a hero, but no one should villafy him either. Just recognize him as the saddest part of all of us, like a bombed out building searching for signs of life and hope within. A quixotic and tragic call to no-man's land.",1152403200,19,1567,4.494736842105263
2427753,1,B000BMY2NS,"There is a great little novel called ""The Bear That Wasn't"" which is about a bear who finds himself living in a human world.  What happened to this bear is that a big factory was built over his cave while he was hibernating and when he awoke in the spring, he walked up some stairs toward the light and found himself on an assembly line.  He insists he's a bear and shouldn't have to work in a factory but everyone says, ""No, you're just a silly man who needs a shave and wears a fur coat...""  The people work very hard to prove to the bear he isn't a bear; they show him bears in zoos and in circuses and explain that bears are not in factories.  Time passes and, as human things do, the factory succeeds for a while then goes out of business.  The doors shut, the people go away, and the bear is left wondering what was going on until he notices leaves falling from the trees and feels an irresistable urge to hibernate...which he does.

I watched ""Grizzly Man"" and as the film went on I wished Herzog would have spent more of the time with Treadwell's nature footage and less with Treadwell.  Treadwell DID (as Herzog said) capture incredibly beautiful footage of Alaska and animals and a film of Treadwell's footage of bears and foxes would have been a worthy monument to the one non-idiotic thing that guy did.  But Herzog was strangely fascinated by Treadwell's simpering sentimental teddy-bear blindness, his solipsistic depression, and his sexual frustration(""voglio una donna!"").

Herzog -- oh my, the long shot of Treadwell's parents standing in front of their suburban house as if saying, ""A childhood in this kitsch explains Treadwell's neurosis and demonstrates why he couldn't tell real bears from teddy bears"" -- Treadwell's parents, the coroner, the ex-girlfriend were all as melodramatic and vacuuous as Treadwell himself.  Treadwell was right in seeing that -- in his life -- only the bears had it going on and had no need to play for the camera.  I felt embarrassed about being human as I watched Treadwell and embarrassingly sorry for Treadwell at the end of the film.  I agree with the Alaskan museum curator; all things in nature have their place in nature.  To regard the bear as the enemy of man (""I'm in a very dangerous place; they could decapitate me at any time!"") is absurd.  The bears did not come to Timothy Treadwell; he went to them.

A few years ago Timothy Treadwell and his girlfriend Amie Huguenard were killed and eaten by grizzly bear in Alaska. ""Grizzly Man"" focuses on the life of Timothy Treadwell through his friends. After all, this film is called ""Grizzly Man"", not ""Grizzly Bear"". According to the film, Timothy Treadwell did not have his marbles altogether. Not only was he a recovering alcoholic but he was clinically depressed, coupled with his love for the grizzly bears, the combination was self-destructive. Another problem with Timothy was his enormous ego and desire to be famous and it shows in the documentary. He constantly puts himself in danger by invading the bear's personal space. He also put his girlfriend in danger as well. It annoyed me to no ends of the earth seeing how Timothy treated the local wildlife in Alaska. He treated them as cartoon characters than as dangerous wild animals. Yogi and Boo Boo these bears were not. The most annoying thing about the documentary was Werner Herzog's condescending narration. There were moments during the film when I had to fast forward through the movie or hit the mute button because Werner's narration was atrocious. Werner should have had one of Tim's friends narrate the film. I definitely do not think that Timothy didn't deserve to be killed the way that he was like one helicopter pilot said but I will say that his recklessness and ignorance was to blame. Amie certainly didn't have to die either. She was an innocent bystander in this whole tragedy. Timothy should have been more considerate to her fear of bears when he was studying them. One of my favorite moments during the film was towards the end when Timothy just lost it on camera which obviously wasn't meant to be seen by anyone. That was pure comedy gold.

2427755,5,B000BMY2NS,"It's not an accident that german filmmaker Werner Herzog, interested in outsiders and lunatics searching for their individual Utopias and who has reflected many times in his documentaries his ambiguous relationship with nature, found in the chaotic mind and bizarre adventure of Timothy Treadwell ( an amateur naturalist and wildlife preservationist that was eaten by a grizzly bear after living among them during thirteen summers)  the perfect stuff for his next film. In "" Grizzly man "" Herzog shows video footage filmed by Treadwell himself during his  ""getaways"" to Alaska with the grizzlies and conducts interviews with people closer to Timothy or that knew his work with the intention to go deeply into the reasons that jumped Timothy to such radical resolution, so as to reflect on the limits of human experience, the cruel indifference of nature and the impossible harmony of man with it and with himself. This nihilist vision of nature that frontally crash with the bostonian writters' trascendentalism from the nineteenth century or the arcadic concept of nature that shows the greater part of the movies produced by the Disney factory, is parallel to his disappointment about modern societies, those from whose influence Treadwell tries to find refuge in a wild, simpler form of life. But ""Grizzly man"" is not a dead alley. Like Treadwall or other characters ( reals or invented ) from his filmography, Herzog also looks for his personal El Dorado;like Melville or Poe he hunts persistantly the emptiness or try to  "" reconstruct "" his paradise lost, risking his life or defying the unknown to find the limits of human experience . Treadwall is then a mirror of Herzog himself; in despite of his painful conscience about world and human limitations Herzog has found in Treadwall and other dreamers arranged to conquest his dreams his paradoxal reason to live.

2427756,3,B000BMY2NS,"Grizzly Man is like watching a train wreck, you know something bad is happening but you can't turn away. The film is very biased for a documentary, siding with Treadwell's ideologies most of the time. Scenes involving the coroner were obviously staged and plagued with bad dramatics.

Treadwell was a self proclaimed ""protector of the bears"" but he did nothing but cry in one scene where a man threw rocks at a cub. His time spent with the bears seemed more like a self indulgent getaway from the society he regularly denounced than a wild life crusade (he poses and rehearses in front of the camera, the bears seem like more supporting actors or set dressings to him than creatures to be protected).

He interacts with the animals as if they are household pets, one can see in many scenes how the slightest miscalculation (combined with his arrogance and carelessness) would have led to his death. The man was admittedly troubled, he replaced one addiction (alcohol) with another (bears). Its disturbing that this man was not forced to get professional help. At certain points in the film he says he wants to be a bear, acts like a bear, and is enchanted by bear feces because it was once part of his beloved bear. Treadwell was a tragedy waiting to happen. He ignored safety rules from the national park that were in place not only to protect him, but the bears he claimed to love because at that point he was severely paranoid and in his mind beyond reproach. This, including the fact that his girlfriend who was terrified of bears accompanied him on his final trip, is just one of the many things that resulted in tragedy.

It was unbelieveable when Treadwell's friend said the bear that killed treadwell and his girlfriend ""wasn't friendly and Tim didn't want to be friends with it anyway"". Yeah, blame the bear, thats logical. Treadwell was a man bent on celebrity through delusional self richeousness ( he regularly congratulates himself on being a good human being throughout his footage) unfortunately his delusions of grandeur cost him not only his life but that of his girlfriend, and one of the bears he supposedly loved, third only to himself and the camera of course.",1150761600,47,2181,4.74934036939314

Although, through his odd ways I truly believe his purpose in life was to watch out for these animals. Now I don't know how many of you agree with me on that, but that's ok.

But I do know this, by them making this documentary it has opened alot of eyes and ears when it comes to the struggle with the Bears and the Alaskan wilderness.

2427769,4,B000BMY2NS,"One of the most unique and disturbing qualities of both photography and film is the ability they have of allowing us to see into people's futures before they themselves have had the chance to experience them.  We look at images of people frozen in a happier time before a certain personal tragedy has befallen them, blissfully unaware of the fate that awaits them - and, for a brief moment at least, we sense what it must be like to be God and realize what a burden that must be.  This feeling of prophetic omniscience haunts the audience all throughout ""Grizzly Man,"" a morbidly fascinating documentary about a man who is quite literally devoured by his own obsession.  This is a film that puts its audience into the position of modern day Cassandras - looking on in helpless horror as the subject moves inexorably towards his bitter fate - grimly aware that there is not a single thing we can do to stop the inevitable from happening.

Timothy Treadwell earned notoriety and even celebrity status as a conservationist who, for thirteen summers, lived amongst a group of grizzly bears in Alaska.  While there, he made ""friends"" with much of the wildlife in the area, filming his experiences in an effort to draw attention to the plight of these creatures at the hands of poachers and hunters.  However, in September, 2003, the bizarre idyll came to a tragic end when Treadwell and his girlfriend were attacked and eaten by a hungry bear.  The film, written, directed and narrated by famed moviemaker Werner Herzog, is made up of footage Treadwell himself shot of his adventures in the wilderness combined with interviews with people who knew him or were somehow involved in the post mortem activities.

Herzog makes it clear from the outset that Treadwell was always a controversial figure, one who was beloved by fellow conservationists, but treated with, at best, skepticism and, at worst, hostility and scorn by others less favorable to his cause.  What we see of the man is alternately inspiring and disturbing.  We admire his strong convictions and fearlessness in the face of danger, yet can't help but detect traces of mental illness or at least childish naivete in many of his actions.  He is a man constantly testing limits, crossing boundaries and teasing fate.  He is often shown interacting with these wild animals with that same air of condescension and sentimentality most people reserve for their benign pets.  He names them, talks to them, scolds them, instructs them, cries over them - seemingly convinced that there is some sort of interspecies communication taking place between him and them.  We somehow expect someone this knowledgeable about the realities of wildlife to be less susceptible to the temptation - that seems to overcome even the most rational of us - of viewing animals in such intensely anthropomorphic terms.  Yet, Treadwell was, apparently, unable to separate himself, either emotionally or psychologically, from the animals he cohabitated with, and he wound up paying the ultimate price for that weakness.

As we watch Treadwell's interactions with the animals and listen to the often self-aggrandizing commentary he provides on his own role in the situation, we get the sense that he saw himself, paradoxically, as both a messiah figure for the grizzlies and a sinner who needed to find his own salvation through them.  His experiences with the bears seem as much a way of achieving a meaning and purpose for his own life as it is a way of saving them from the threats of an ever-encroaching and hostile civilization.

As a master director himself, Herzog is also fascinated by Treadwell's techniques as a filmmaker.  He shows how Treadwell, ever the perfectionist and showman, would often film seemingly spontaneous scenes a dozen or more times until he was happy that the final take was the one that would show him off to his best advantage. He would even consciously cover up the presence of the cameraman (or woman) in an effort to make it appear as if he were truly alone on these expeditions.

Was Treadwell an environmentalist hero, a self-promoting opportunist or a victim of a bizarre mental illness that allowed him to believe that he was genuinely connecting with the bears on a psychic level - if not a bear himself?  ""Grizzly Man"" raises far more questions than it answers - but, then again, that is what a truly great documentary should be all about.",1150329600,20,4406,4.895161290322581

Unfortunately he took his girlfriend with him.  AND he'd been taking girlfriends with him all along.  BUT he never filmed them because he was supposed to be alone in the wilderness, total cheat.

Watching the movie I kept looking at other people during some of the funnier moments, like when his friends would talk about him, or he'd go off on some weird tangent.  We all thought he was totally egotistical and dangerous to himself and others. Can't see how most of these reviewers missed this.  He wasn't 'in touch' with nature and the bears - he was totally out of touch with the laws of nature.

2427773,3,B000BMY2NS,"Timothy Treadwell spent 13 seasons with the grizzly bears in Alaska. He followed them, studied them, lived among them. For the first few years he would take pictures and in the later years he carried a video camera with him to document his experiences on film. He would present them at various speaking engagements for which he never charged a fee. He wanted to dispel the feeling that grizzly bears were inherently dangerous. He believed, rather, that they should be respected and loved by humans. His message, from the beginning, was that he was so passionate about this cause that he would die for these animals. Each year when he set off to Alaska he would tell friends that if he should not return, they should not worry because it was what he wanted. It was how he wanted to go, if he must.

In the end, that is exactly what Timothy got. In 2003 he and his companion killed by a bear.

Grizzly Man is a documentary about Timothy Treadwell. It tells about the man before he became obsessed with bears and it talks about the man as he lived among the bears. We see actual footage taken by Timothy and we see first person accounts from family and friends. One of the more interesting perspectives included in the film is that from people who think Timothy got exactly what he deserved. The contrast between a man and woman tragically killed by a bear and sentiment that he was doing more harm than good to the bears he was committed to protect was sharp.

The movie was very interesting. Despite the interference with nature, and the breaking of a few federal laws, Timothy Treadwell had a unique perspective on life. The film would not have been worth seeing if it did not contain so much footage from his time in Alaska. So much of his philosophy was explained as narrative to his video. His transition away from human society was remarkably well captured over the years. He grew more and more comfortable among the bears and less and less cautious. It would be his downfall.

I do not usually make a point to watch documentaries, but this one looked different. It was entertaining in documentary terms, but if you are deciding between this and something a bit more fictional, I am not sure you should pick Grizzly Man.

I liked it well enough, though I do not anticipate the need to ever watch it a second time. Put Grizzly Man on your ""to rent"" list.",1150070400,,2357,4.523474178403756

But don't try to cross them because they are Godless Killing Machines.  They are vicious, take no prisoner, type of animals...ready to gouge out your eyes with a single swipe of their  terrifyingly bear paws.  Oh yeah they are dangerous and now they are interbreeding,  oh yeah the ""grizzly-polar"" bear. Oh MY!, now they can hunt us humans down in all types of climates and terrain.  Next they'll figure out how to fly and then be dropping from the skies.  Nowhere is safe...Go Underground ...but don't any take honey with you..Bears have terrific senses and can sniff that out.  That's what happened Treadwell and his girlfriend,  they were about to make their favorite sandwiches (peanut butter, banana's and honey on wheat) and play their ""hey let's see how much honey we can splatter on ourselves"" game that they love so much when they met their fates.  I'm sure it wasn't just one bear as this film wants us to believe, it was most definitely a Bear Special Unit of 3, maybe 4 bears, that took him out,  even though Treadwell was supposively ""bear friendly"" .  Just remember ""Bears have no friends"", they are Godless killing machines that are ready to gouge your eyes and destroy all human existence.

2427775,5,B000BMY2NS,"I have never seen a movie that broke my heart the way grizzly man did. So many people have referred to Treadwell as 'crazy' or 'delusional', but I think he was one of the most blessed people on this planet. He made the choice to leave behind the security and padding of civilization, and venture out into uncharted domain. Much of his footage contains his rantings about society, and I for one agree with him completely. While we are safe in our climate controlled homes, playing with our technologies, the planet is being destroyed and paved over. Treadwell felt the pain of the earth and her wildlife crying out, and sought to bring himself closer to it. So what if he got dangerously close to wild bears, without a thought for his safety. Not many people would have the guts to do what he did, not without safety crews and a paycheck. I do not think he in any way sought fame on a nature show. Sure, he was a little 'out there', but all the great people in history where. Some of the comments from people in the movie really made me mad, though. Like saying he 'deserved what he got'. He was following a dream, and he believed so deeply in something that he risked, and gave, his life for it. That is the most truly human thing we can do. If you have not seen this movie, I highly recommend you do. But please do not focus on what a 'crazy' guy he was. Look instead to the truly amazing vision he had, and the astounding message that you can find within it, and within yourself. And I think Timothy's death was a poetic justice for him. Where else would he have wanted to die, than in the land he loved? His spirit will always be with those bears, and that land. My praise to Herzog, for bringing these images and words to a beautiful flow, and all of Timothy's friends and loved ones, for believing in a truly great man.",1149811200,3,1824,4.305232558139535
2427776,5,B000BMY2NS,"When the film begins, one might believe Timothy really is connected enough with the spirits of Nature to communicate with grizzly bears. As his story unfolds, though, and this is to Werner Herzog's credit as well as Timothy's, since he filmed himself so continuously...you realize that he probably did this as a campaign to get a job as a nature TV show host! At first glance, one might believe he did his work for free because of his love for nature but gradually one realizes he probably does it because he knows he's a fraud and desperately wants a TV gig! There's a strong ""i can do this"" attitude yet no real respect for or desire to learn how bears communicate with each other, how they grow, how they live (in contrast to Monty Roberts, for example) -- just, how can i be an intruder and not get killed. In fact, he repeatedly tells us how he could be killed any day, but in the film Werner shows us, doesn't really give any useful information about the bears' habits that could contribute to understanding them better. The sad fact is, many of today's more eccentric ""celebrity"" nature show hosts are just like that. And unfortunately, it only reinforces the behavior in animals that encourages beliefs like Werner's (and secretly Timothy's) that Nature is really cold and unjust. This film isn't just about Timothy, though, because if you're a card-carrying human being, you won't be able to help seeing yourself in some of this. Even Werner Herzog, by showing how he worked with the musicians on the soundtrack (a separate documentary on the DVD), is clearly of the same stock - it's hilarious to hear him ""direct"" the musicians, only to hear them repeat exactly what they were doing to begin with!! It definitely gave the impression that in filming himself as a key player in the soundtrack, Werner might have been trying to justify his role in making a film that he didn't actually shoot himself! What makes someone into a Timothy or a Werner? This film doesn't answer that, but seeing the film and the music session kind of guides one into the question.",1149638400,4,2066,4.663013698630137
2427777,5,B000BMY2NS,"Werner Herzog's film Grizzly Man is not a nature film concerning Grizzly bears as some other reviewers thought, but rather an excellent character study of self proclaimed protector of the grizzlies and general nut job Timothy Treadwell. Treadwell spent 13 summers visiting a national park in Alaska to observe, film and ""protect"" grizzly bears. Using film shot and narrated by Treadwell and interviews with those who knew him, filmaker Werner Herzog spins an almost incredible tale of Timothy Treadwells misplaced, almost religious zeal for the bears and nature and his childish and complete misunderstanding of both. Treadwell has little clue regarding grizzly bear behavior or human behavior for that matter. He may love the grizzlies but he doesn't respect them. Instead he anthropomorphizes his 1500 lbs. ""friends"" and seems both unaware and unconcerned of the very real danger in which he puts himself. He often talks about how he may die by the grizzlies hand, or paw, yet never seems to really believe it. Ultimately Treadwell and most unfortunately his girlfriend, pay dearly for his dreamy and foolish view of nature: bears are not big cuddly buddies, and Tim you are not a bear. But his behavior, worldview and the footage taken by Treadwell are as fascinating as they are disturbing. Tim was obviously bonkers yet Herzog seems to see him almost as a brother or seeker on a misguided path in life to be sure, but who also reached for something other than than the ordinary. Herzog manages to point out both Timothy Treadwells obvious mental illness, his misunderstanding of nature, and his humanity at the same time. I'm not going to critique Treadwell's behavior, but rather praise Herzog's portrayal of this complex and bizarre individual: a man who had the stones to spend 13 years with animals that could (and did) crush him with one indifferent paw. The size of the bears is astounding. At one point Tim is babbling about his buddy ""Mr. Chocolate"" who is shown scratching his back on a pine tree. Tim later walks up to the same tree and says ""What a big bear!"" Tim's head comes up to where the bears stomach was, a big bear indeed.

The bonus material contains much interesting extra footage, the best of which concerns the recording of the soundtrack. Avantgarde guitarist, composer Henry Kaiser was the music director/producer for this film. He's shown in the studio recording music improvised by various musicians including string players and guitarist Richard Thompson. Thompson, ex of Fairport Convention and now on a long and fruitful solo career does the lions share of the soundtrack recordings and his guitar playing is glorious. In one scene he is shown being advised by Herzog in order to get the feel the director is looking for. Herzog's reaction to Thompson's playing is as interesting as is Thompson's music, running from initial scepticism and doubt to joy. Thompson really manages to capture the loneliness and beauty of the Alaskan wilderness. The bonus material is truly a bonus especially to music lovers.

Overall I'd say this DVD is well worth buying. The bonus/extras material has some great music and other scenes. The film has some of the best nature footage I've ever seen, and Treadwell is a fascinating character. Herzog's portrayal of him and ultimate conclusions surrounding his life are thought provoking if not perhaps a little over the top with Teutonic pessimism. In fact Herzog seems to be drawn to these types of people, those with very odd and individual world views. For example his working with the German actor Klaus Kinski and the documentary concerning the making of the movie Fizcaraldo paints the portrait of Kinski as being close to madness, tormented by personal demons. Like Treadwell, Kinski too claims a closeness to nature and an understanding of it but that claim is belied by his strange and manic behavior. Perhaps that's why Herzog did this movie.",1149552000,2,3916,4.995405819295559
2427778,4,B000BMY2NS,"I must start this review by recommending the review posted a few days ago by Tracy Hodson--probably the single best DVD review I've ever read on Amazon.  It provides a clarity and depth of analysis that I can't possibly top.

My own sense of the film--somewhat different from Hodson's--is that one of the fascinations of this film is what it says about the possibilities (and limitations, perhaps) of film as a medium.  The film is rich in imagery.  As others have noted, Treadwell's footage of the bears is marvelous--though Treadwell may have been more lucky (being in the right place at the right time) than skilled as a cinematographer.  And there are beautiful landscapes, as shot by Herzog, that capture a beauty and wildness that is immense and deeply moving.

The ""story""--such as it exists--is (ultimately) more about Herzog and his obsession with Treadwell than anything else(a nice parallel, perhaps intended, perhaps not, to Treadwell's obsession with the bears).  But the film isn't really about these people--or even the bears--so much as it is about the way Treadwell and Herzog use film to work out their own visions of a life that is beyond the experience and comprehension of most of us.

That said, the film also beautifully captures some of the other humans involved in this story--minor characters, in a way, but just as important in terms of evoking the way people live in and with nature.  I'm thinking of Treadwell's ex-girlfriend, Jewel; the coroner who examined the bodies; the pilot who discovered the bodies.  To me, these human portraits add greatly to the viewer's satisfaction and fascination with the film.  Each of these people had a connection to Treadwell, a specific and personal understanding of the violent end of Treadwell's life, and a reflective (and nonjudgmental) sense of Treadwell's strange preoccupation with the bears.

This film is worth watching for many reasons.  It is both thought provoking and memorable.",1149465600,2,1957,5.059190031152648
2427789,5,B000BMY2NS,"Merriam-Webster's definition of megalomania is ""1 : a mania for great or grandiose performance; 2 : a delusional mental disorder that is marked by infantile feelings of personal omnipotence and grandeur,"" which I quote to support the thesis that there is no better filmmaker to capture the strange, lunatic story of Timothy Treadwell's life with the wild grizzly bears of Alaska,  than the strange, lunatic storyteller, Werner Herzog, whose lunacy is at least redeemed by a passionate genius which has, in recent years, been mellowing into a kind of philosophical benevolence. Sadly, there was no such personal redemption for the desperately out-of-sync Treadwell, who, along with his girlfriend, the elusive and deliberately invisible Amie Huguenard, died torn to shreds by one of the bears he professed to be studying.  Yet in the hands of this extraordinary filmmaker, who despite his earlier great work may just now be reaching genuine mastery, the story of Treadwell's life has  transcended the facts amply described in these reviews, and become a tale not about the dangers of living with wild bears, but rather the dangers of living with a malfunctioning psyche. Unafraid to show us the full range of madness that described Timothy Treadwell, Herzog, for many years his fellow in madness, shines an unflinching light into the darkness that drove this young man out into the wilderness where his psychosis could become a kind of ecstasy and his delusions an unfettered stretching of the spirit. I cannot imagine any other filmmaker able to accomplish such a feat.

Timothy Treadwell left a world in which he could not function most likely due to untreated Bipolar Disorder, and for 13 summers went to the  Alaskan peninsula where a large area of land has been set aside as refuge for Grizzlies, and in violation of the Park Service and other governmental authorities, not to mention common sense, set himself up as a ""protector"" of bears who had no need of either a ""kind warrior,"" to ""serve them"", nor a ""samurai"" to ""challenge them.""  For the last five years he had a video camera with him, with which he carefully crafted his image as the ""only protector"" these bears had, a man willing to live and die for them, a scientist, a naturalist (despite an appalling ignorance and complete lack of even the most rudimentary collecting of data or preparatory research). While he captured some of the most beautiful and unstudied footage of the grizzlies ever filmed, as the years passed the camera increasingly became a confessional medium, and in evermore disturbing monologues on everything from his failure with women (despite his self-professed sexual prowess), to his extraordinary courage in the face of overwhelming odds and dangers, constantly describing himself as the bravest human being on the planet, the only one who has successfully won the respect of the grizzlies and therefore survived, ""all alone,"" the most ""dangerous place on the planet, the Grizzly Maze,"" we watch the intensity of his delusions and paranoia growing. When he notices a smiley face drawn on a rock, one's first thought is that someone who has heard of him is saying ""hi,"" but this little face on a rock on the beach is seen by him as a cleverly backwards, upside-down threat against his life. His grandiosity is, as Herzog says, incandescent; he burns in his madness, something I do not find funny, but frightening.  As apparently the real victim of this tragedy, Amie Huguenard, did too, stating that he seemed ""hell-bent on destruction.""  Herzog's question seems to be, ""Where does madness end and transcendence begin?"" Only in Treadwell's gorgeous footage does any answer seem to lie.

Treadwell's greatest need and gravest error of judgment is revealed in the way he anthropomorphized these wild creatures, at times to a truly astonishing degree, describing the bears, foxes, bees, and even flies in entirely human terms, projecting upon them his own needs and emotions. Giving 12-ft tall grizzlies such petting-zoo names as ""Mr. Chocolate"" and ""STabitha,"" and naming a fox after himself, so disconnected from reality is he that he genuinely believes they are his friends, believe him to be theirs; is entirely certain that they love him and know he loves them (something he tells them constantly, often in great fits of sobbing).

But what fascinates most is how skewed a vision of the natural world he and Herzog share--Treadwell sees the bears' indifference to his presence as affectionate acceptance and their occasional hostility to him as a deliberate challenge that must be met with strength so that they will respect him, while Herzog just as readily ascribes human terms to the same behaviors (""boredom"" and ""cruelty""). The only difference is that Treadwell bathes the natural world in a rosy-glassed romantic light, while Herzog sees only ""chaos, destruction, and murder."" When he sees the footage of the very old and desperately starving bear that is believed to have attacked Treadwell and Ms. Huguenard, he refers to him as a ""murderer,"" a human term implying deliberation and formed intent. As the film progresses, Herzog is as self-revelatory as Treadwell, and we end up with portraits of two megalomaniacs, each making films more about themselves than anything else. Treadwell is the center of his film, not the bears, just as Herzog increasingly becomes the central character of his ""documentary."" As the camera was running, lens cap on, there is an audio track of the entire attack, and he listens to it under headphones (theretofore only heard for necessary reasons by the coroner) and while I don`t feel it should have been played for us, it is odd that when the tape is played, it is Herzog we are watching as he listens privately while Treadwell's oldest friend watches him shake, clearly deeply disturbed by what he hears. He then tells her that she should destroy the tape, never listen to it, and it while this is sound advice, it seems somehow inappropriate that he should have, through the making of this film, become the most important witness to this event, and the one to decide how those closest to his subject should handle such matters. As Herzog enters more deeply Treadwell's world, he seems more and more inclined to the role of keeper of the keys, rather than filmmaker.

In a disconcerting segment, Herzog follows the graphic description of the cleanup of the bodies of the two humans from inside the bear which ate them with Treadwell's footage of an extraordinarily ferocious fight between two males, so that we cannot help but imagine the attack on two small people as we watch these enormous bears in full battle mode. The scene becomes more surreal as afterwards, Treadwell enters the frame to both talk to us about the intensity of the fight, then to have a relaxed, on-camera chat with the losing bear, even reassuring the vanquished giant that he, Timothy, has no designs on the female in question. This never strikes him as absurd, nor does he see the bear as oblivious to his words of wisdom. Having failed with humans, he insists that the bears stand in as companions, the foxes as playmates. Deliberately camping next to two fox dens, he finds that they abide his presence, even allowing him to pet and play with them, and he calls them ""sweet"" when they permit this. But the loving taping of, and baby-talking to, a fox kit who has grabbed his baseball cap to play with, turns ugly when the kit runs off to its den with this ""vital"" belonging, while Treadwell gives chase, yelling, swearing at, and threatening the kit in frustrated rage. Suddenly the good baby is a bad one, and nowhere in the scene is there any indication that Treadwell understands that foxes are not humans (or even little dogs) biddable to his command.  Despite his claim of being out there to ""study"" the animals, he clearly knows nothing about them, either of their behavior, or even that fox babies are not called ""pups,"" but rather ""kits.""

He weeps over a kit who has been killed by wolves (he thinks), and describes the wolves as celebratory in their kill, and what is clearest is his inability to see that death is as much a part of nature as is life, that animals do not hold celebrations when they kill either to eat, to ensure procreation, to hold their own territory against intruders. And neither does Herzog see this as balance, but as horror. Each is entirely projecting his own prejudices on what is simply the emotionless cycles of nature, a common problem with megalomaniacs, who genuinely lose it when faced with proof that they are not omnipotent; the Marquis de Sade also hated Nature, ""that passionless spectator that can bear everything,"" hence both Treadwell on his tapes, and Herzog in ""Burden of Dreams,"" both expressing the need to ""conquer"" nature. This problem is seen most clearly when Treadwell screams into the camera that it MUST rain, begging the gods to send rain because ""Tabitha is eating her babies!"" That animals sometimes die, sometimes kill one another, seems to be news to Treadwell. One wonders where he thought hamburgers came from.

The one voice of quiet sanity comes from the single Aleut that Herzog interviewed (too briefly), who explained what respect for bears is in the Native American view, that it means understanding who people are, who the bears are, and not impinging on their territory or trying to ""be"" one. In his opinion, Treadwell's actions were the opposite of ""protective,"" were in fact disrespectful and ultimately dangerous to the bears, as a bear who is used to people is in danger of getting hurt or killed. The Indian vision of Nature has nothing to do with Treadwell's pretty illusions or with Herzog`s notions of hostility, but rather with everything holding its place, fulfilling its purpose--all functioning without any unnecessary interference from humans. The People have always taken only what was needed; to kill even one creature more than necessary is criminal; even Treadwell's attempt to influence the salmon run so that ""his"" bears can eat would be considered deeply inappropriate. True harmony can only occur when humans maintain a very light touch. Treadwell's discovery of what he thinks is a dead bee (ignorance about what he calls the ""pollen thing"" on full display), his rage at a fly who is trying to do its job laying eggs on the dead fox kit in order to recycle it back to the Earth is not, as he seemed to think, an evil disruption of perfection, but rather an illustration of it. Yet he swore at the fly as though it's landing on the kit's body was a personal insult directed at him, ""Don't do that in front of me.""

Yet, even with all of this to shake one's head at, what Herzog admires is indeed admirable: Timothy Treadwell's unique footage and his fearless self-revelation. The beauty of the wild is something Herzog has filmed repeatedly, nor has he ever attempted to pass himself off as anything but a madman. His rants in ""Burden of Dreams"" are every bit as uninhibited as Treadwell's rants against the evils of everything from flies to the Park Service. It is a great act of courage to bare one's soul before the world, and both of these men have done that. And it is a gift to be able to do what Herzog has done with this film: he has elevated one man's corkscrewed vision of the world and distilled it to its poetic core, even managing to imbue a cast of oddballs and outcasts with a measure of dignity. Where others see weirdoes and misfits, Herzog has always seen idiosyncricity of character and has honored it as illustrative of the range of humanity. A less judgmental man never held a camera. And clearly, despite their different points of view, Herzog empathizes with Treadwell's enormous struggle to understand and subdue his demons. Perhaps if Timothy Treadwell had lived, he would have found some way to harness them as Herzog has his, and become a fellow visionary, rather than merely a fellow madman.

And speaking of visionaries, let us not forget the exceptional score by genius Richard Thompson, whose guitar speaks to us as clearly and movingly as do Treadwell's images. Through collective improvisation Thompson and several other musicians, with producer Henry Kaiser at the helm and Herzog in the room, created a score that is minimalist yet powerful, authoritative yet playful. On the DVD there is an hour-long documentation of the sessions, called ""In the Edges,"" appropriately enough, as that's where Thompson, Herzog, and during his lifetime, Tim Treadwell, have always lived.",1149292800,25,12515,4.91016548463357
2427790,5,B000BMY2NS,"For starters, if you try to type what I'm about to type, you will laugh!  You will laugh here.....and there!  A forewarning: One must, must, must not misinterpret my words as being informative in any fashion.  Instead, they coagulate rather gruesomely, convening as a compendium on Timmothy ""he who Bears the Mark of the Bear"" Treadwell.  If I should say anything, let it be this much: this film is roaringly genius!

Let us begin, and where that shall be from, this is a paradox for the ages.....18 and above.  You see, I witnessed before my very eye(s) the ugly truth brought to film format by a one Mr. Werner Herzog, director and film maker from above.  Literally, the guys a registered connosieur of astounding acquity and veracity unmatched since the days of Jim Henson and his mudslinging muppets - damn rabble rousers made 'O Arts N Crafts specially formulated materials.  But I digress.  Regress.  And digress again.

Reexamining this blog's premise, the 2005 movie (theatrical release?) Grizzly Man documents, via director Herzog culling and compiling 100+ hours of Timothy Treadwell's Alaskan hiatus' over the course of 13 summers (1990-2003), Treadwell's highs and lows, personal struggles against demons resurfacing in morphed form, family dilemmas be they overcome or latent horror - all is laid bare, but at face-value?  Not necessarily.  Rather, Timothy Treadwell - or Grizzly Man a la glamorous big screen gala title - and his battles against nature, ironically waging them in the hope of protecting her creatures, are relived thanks to his near constant camera rolling done in order to salvage trip notes as well as forge a memoir of sorts... and to carry home a deliverable message about the environment.  Saving bears and convincing park rangers, Alaskan legislators to boot, to facilitate this noble goal of nature's call, his call at that, transcend themselves into mainstays throughout Treadwell's adventures - a Northern Exposure.  A brief expose on the protagonist now deceased - I'll give you two choices of his death's cause...........1) hungry little bear; 2) hungry big bear. [grizzlies both]

Timmothy Drexter, rearranged legally to Timmothy Treadwell, was raised amidst the pluralism that is Americana; small-town boy, athletic, a standout swimmer in highschool and later recipient of a swim-team scholarship, well-rounded lad, and so on and so forth.  He strived and, one could say, in places thrived.  But, as is so often the case with life's travails, his story was one heading for the doldrums, and yet worse - the bear claw.....[not the snack food you demented MF's!!!]  Treadwell dropped longheld interests, engaged himself in hobbies unheard of so much as unbeknownst to close relatives, plus exceedingly sought higher ground - a grander life of the semi-bourgeiose in concotion with on-edge stunts of crazed lunacy only a delusional, well, lunatic would imagine and altogether accomplish (i.e. a lot of puffs of misfilled marlboros marring his formative years).  Treadwell was a man astonishingly quirky while in conjunction periodically dormant and perturbed; this to some level suits his description.  His downward spiral would rushingly approach, studio rejected hooves a clapping homeward bound, jettisoning his vision into a forbidden, forebodding zone of immense unforeseen turbidity as well as acerbic angst.  Essentially, all is told, bitterness steadily enroached rearing its mindless head, finding Treadwell champing at the bit.....of sanity yet contained in his think box.  The screws were gradually turning looser, where alternative escapades started making themselves all the more alluring.  It just so happened this cultured and self-trained theatre hopeful came slamming against an impenetrable blockade, all too familiar to each his own, whether we admit or deny and opt out.  Timothy Treadwell may be remembered as runner up, second place finisher to Woody Harlson for the Cheers bartender character liquered into stardom and affectionately recanted as 'Woody.'  A missed opportunity at landing himself a role on a major NBC sitcom levelled his playing field quite a bit, and he quite reacted in vain.  He now, years after the dreaded fact, decides to air-it-out for Alaska's remote quarters beginning in summer of 1990, longing for a way in which to make his mark on the world - acting salary knocked clear out of the picture.  North to Alaska was he.  Northward towards frigid forest, tumultuous tundra.  Ingnored were the lurking animals of the deep as potential hazards and campsite invaders.  To this notion he would make the ultimate sacrifice, taking along an admirer, a dear friend of his to their lives' ditto tragedy tour de force.

Alright, enough romanticizing.  This tale isn't so much one of irrational personal folly, which to an extent it most certainly is, but instead a lesson of perserverance, determination, embracing adventure & distant travel; to put it bluntly, Treadwell's lore encapsulates a scheme of self-searching.  It was to be the human world where Timothy Treadwell could not find his niche, his place among the clouds.  In the realm of animal and beast - that woodsy domain of legend sending shivers straight down spines of the less attuned with nature and its power/fury - Timothy Treadwell came and conquered for 13 summers, spending all of 2-3 months hunkered amidst remote wilderness alongside its inalienable uncertainties.  Treadwell never appears to take for granted these July-September months of tranquility, for he adapts and learns, be it through spells of sunshine or rainfall, how to fend for his own safety, how to keep his guard (exceptions: his having stored coolers in his tent; his camping at many sites beyond their restrictive safety measure of 5 days continous stay; getting too close to wild bears; setting tent in nondesignated park areas......the list of Park infringements is endless though meaningful in retrospect); and how to surmount difficult, overwhelming odds.  Between tent-collapsing storm-driven gale force winds, threats to his well-being penned by visiting poachers/outdoorsmen, in addition to several encounters with not-so-friendly-but-very-instinctively-impulsive full grown grizzly bears; Treadwell escapes everything unscathed, though remains still damaged from within from prior experience in the human world. Timothy Treadwell's personal tapings and narrations of his own dances with nonexistence are dynamic, profound, illustritive pieces of artistry thankfully captured by a man not clever enough to survive the wild (as we shall see), though sensible enough to journal and record all manner of day-to-day circumstance.

Summer 2000, Summer 2001.....a couple future summers down the road, many looking back: These were periods of momentary blunder as well as inspirational personal achievement and rejuvenation.  However, no matter how many get-aways Treadwell would embark, succeeding returns to normalcy - to society as we know it - never quite agreed with his morales, his eclectic tastes, nor his vision of harmony and balance needed among souls.  This, the film Grizzly Man, is a story of a sole... soul seeking out a plane of peace, respect, natural beauty - elogance made animate,  hope sprung alive without cease.  In the film's crucial segments, Treadwell did succeed fulfilling his goals, his self-enforced obligations, as his daily Alaskan documentary prooves time and again.  Treadwell sought difference; he became that difference - a contrast of consistency clashing with rage, turmoil, anthropomorphic spite/contempt.  A scorn worn anxiously juxtaposing a joyous smile of exhuberance that frequently accompanies satisfying application of one's cherished qualities, best captures Treadwell's character and innate sensibilities.

A warm-hearted fellow, very hellbent on attracting attention to preserving not only Alaska's bear population, but eternal wildness; drastic landscape so permeated by awe inspiring wonder.  In an alterable land, weatherwise, Treadwell discovers his mission of harping on those attrocities at the fore of forest and wildlife destruction - not forgetting the human influence and ultimate hand involved - is an uphill climb, a journey of fractional, constituent minor journies embedded therein.  Many thanks owed to well paid Alaskan private pilots, he enters this jungle, this 'Grizzly Maze' by which he christens that particular part of the park in southeast Alaska flocked to each and every summer.  Back in the maze he finds himself again, the year 2003, 13 summers running uninterrupted, though he is not to return before conclusion of the last of these.

Timothy Treadwell's untimely expiring took place under gruesome circumstance, his friend perishing by his side in the attack.  After 13 years of living largely in concordance with grizzlies and foxes alike, amongst other wildlife, his fate would be sealed - gone now was a bright, witty, zany, caring individual - one September evening.  A rare bear, one perhaps from the interior of the countryside - a nonnative of the habitat traveled to so reheasrsly, directly via commuter, by Treadwell - is the white elephant that was hiding in Treadwell's Alaskan room of tall pine and rippling river torrent.  A lone person's conviction that nobility endures in the face of the wild, in the face of the brute and intemperate, shown foolish once more.  Taming an as yet untouched serenity is risky business, grand scale in Treadwell's case - Alaska.  It goes to show, the honest notion of 'risk meets reward' meets retaliation.  And in the end, innocence is lost, good deeds are spat upon, ultimately  the balance of intention vs. outcome isn't a given.  Perhaps Timothy Treadwell's sweetness and kind hearted nature, albeit the source of his demise at the paws/jaws of the beast, can survive to instruct us of a sole positive moral ending this otherwise utter tragedy at best: When we humans devalue intention, when we become obssessed by the material, by the gratification immediacy of the physical world for all its traps and pitfalls.... we consume not only each other but ourselves.  Timothy Treadwell may go down as the biggest out door's buffoon this side of Al Linder or Babe Winkelman, but all things considered, he is a patron's hero of courage, nobility, and making the waves when sign of trouble nears.

2427791,3,B000BMY2NS,"""Grizzly Man"" is largely made up of footage from Timothy Treadwell's last 5 summers in the Alaskan wilderness before he was eaten, (along with girlfriend Amie Huguenard) by a rogue grizzly.

Treadwell camped by himself and filmed the dangerous bears and other animals, trying to successfully absorb himself into their world.  Some of the more manic and angry rants by Treadwell paint him as an unmedicated sufferer of Bipolar disorder.  His ex-girlfriend even talks about a time when he went off his medication because he said, ""I can't have the middle ground. I have to have the highs and lows.""

The interviews with friends and locals are unintentionally hilarious at times. (Especially the coroner and bear museum curator).

However, the humor is greatly marred by the fact that an innocent woman was killed because of Treadwell's obsession with dying by the hands of a grizzly.

It seems he wanted to die that way, he hoped to become a martyr that way.  I do not think Treadwell intended for Aime Huguenard to die with him, but unfortunately for her, that particular bear did not get the memo.  She believed she was safe with Treadwell.  In the end, she was a victim to Treadwell's destructive and idiotic way of life.

In the end, this is a tragic and depressing film about a mentally ill man who wanted to become a bear.  He had good intentions, but unfortunately, he took them way too far.",1148515200,4,1396,4.75103734439834
2427792,4,B000BMY2NS,"Although the video and photographic footage is amazing, this documentary's greatness lies not with any information about grizzly bears in Alaska or insight into the interactions of wild animals with humans or one another.  You will learn nothing about grizzlies watching this, other than their names given by activist Tim Treadwell.  Treadwell brought absolutely no scientific method to his 13 seasons with these majestic, dangerous creatures, appeared to collect zero data, and arguably learned nothing other than an ultimate and tragic lesson about their awesome power and eating habits.

 This documentary is excellent for two reasons: it chronicles the life of a man who deserves the Darwin Lifetime Achievement Award (you know, those ""awards"" given to people whose deaths and injuries are inevitable in view of the idiotic activities in which they engage); and it is one of the greatest examples of mental illness ever captured on film.  Any attempts by filmmaker Werner Herzog's to paint Treadwell as deep and mysterious, and his actions noble, cannot steer viewers away from the single conclusion that this is what happens when certifiably crazy people don't take their medication (admittedly, too; Treadwell abstained in order to ""keep the highs high and the lows low,"" probably not including a grizzly mauling as one of the lows when he made the statement).  Had he spent a little more time in civilization, a documentary about Tim's life would surely include scenes of a shooting spree and standoff with police.

 For the most part, this film is unbiased, and it rightfully makes the focus Treadwell and not the grizzlies. Herzog presents a nice tribute to Treadwell's skill as an amateur filmmaker, and the footage is undeniably compelling in both its level of sophistication and subject matter: Treadwell proximity to the bears defies belief.  Herzog is as interested in charting Treadwell's departure from reality as in his passion and love for the wild animals.  Interviews are conducted with both detractors and fans of  Treadwell, the latter a strange lot right out of Waiting for Guffman.  [One way to separate the normal people from the fellow nuts in Treadwell's jar:  the normal people's reactions to Treadwell's adventures ranged from disbelief to confusion to hostility.]

One exception to Herzog's objectivity was towards the end of the movie, when Treadwell screamed and ranted about his hatred of the park service.  Watching that scene was to witness a human unraveling.  Herzog's narration, sparse throughout the film, opined that Treadwell's rants transcended anger merely at the government rangers, and were symbolic of his hatred for civilization and mankind.  I disagree, and in fact think he might as well have been (and probably was) screaming at the aliens who put microchips in his brain, or at Count Chocula.

The massive, terrible and ironic tragedy of the film- in addition his poor girlfriend Aimee's death- is that Treadwell  actually caused a couple of his precious bears to die for his lunacy.  These lived on protected land, and were in fact not in any danger... until they mauled Tim, that is, after which a couple were exterminated for an autopsy.  Treadwell's life and work were a charade, and his legacy is not imparting respect for the complexity of man's interaction with beast; it is engendering a wish that more crazy people would disappear into the wilderness like Tim, rather than endanger the rest of society.",1147910400,16,3462,5.15742397137746
2427793,4,B000BMY2NS,"Grizzly Man (Werner Herzog, 2005)

It's hard to imagine anyone watching Werner Herzog's fine documentary and not come to the conclusion that Timothy Treadwell was, at the very least, a certifiable nutcase. For thirteen years, Treadwell spent his summers in the Alaska wilderness, ostensibly protecting the grizzlies from poachers and, for all intents and purposes, attempting to integrate himself into daily grizzly life as if he were living in a Disney movie. Grizzly Man shows the difference between the world of Walt Disney and the world the rest of us inhabit in no uncertain terms; Treadwell was killed and eaten by a grizzly bear in October of 2003. (Tellingly, however, he was killed only after he varied his yearly routine. One wonders what Walt Disney would've made of that.)

Herzog intercuts large parts of the footage Treadwell shot of his own trips to Alaska with is own interviews with friends, intimates, and those who handled Treadwell after his death. The result is a pretty comprehensive picture of a man whom very few people knew as anything more than a celebrity, ""the grizzly man."" Ironically, Treadwell, a failed actor, finally had fame come looking for him after he stopped looking for it. Mother Nature can be cruel.

Herzog, of course, knows how to make documentaries; My Best Fiend was one of the best to come out of the past decade. That Grizzly Man is competently done should be expected. Whereas Herzog had had a long personal relationship with Klaus Kinski when deciding to film My Best Fiend (one, amusingly, that Herzog refers to during one of this film's interviews), here he chose to approach the material the same way; Herzog got to know his subjects, became their friend, before shotting this film. It has the same intimacy, which is something of a surprise. This can be a difficult film to watch, but it's a rewarding one. *** ",1147910400,4,1864,4.889240506329114
2427794,5,B000BMY2NS,"Let me start by admitting that the high rating is mostly due to the film's ""fascination factor"". But don't get me wrong, it's content is gripping and educational (factually educational in a loose sense). Werner Herzog himself recounts Alaskan grizzly bear activist Timothy Treadwell (and to a much lesser extent, Timothy's friend and companion Amie Huguenard) as he spends months at a time in the Alaskan wilderness amongst the wildlife. Rather than re-recount what happens, here's my take:

I don't tend to dismiss or minimalize Timothy's passion for nature, in fact it's something to be celebrated, and it's a passion that friends & aquaintances of his will corroborate, and also one that often comes through in his video diaries. It's quite obvious he felt deeply for those bears... however misplaced those feelings were. As Herzog himself says on multiple occasions, Timothy lost the ability to differentiate between humans and the animals he spent time around and was infinately fascinated with. One thing that bothered me during Timothy's video confessions was the characterization of him being there as ""research"". Now, I have no doubt his observations were genuinely a learning experience for him, but it's apparrent that he was simply a layman. The grizzly expert on Kodiak Island put his into glaring perspective. His sobering attitude and expertise in the field couldn't be more at odds with Treadwell's cavalier behavior. Herzog's own commentary late in the film concerning the very bear that may have killed him just days later as it dives deep into the river to scavange for salmon carcasses provides a insight into the grizzly's behavior that Treadwell seemed to miss completely. Or one he ignored.

His attitude also flied in the face of the reality he was living, and manifested itself into the worst of conclusions. He was pompous and arrogant, at times, toward the very environment he claimed to hold in the highest regard. Treadwell was clearly manic-depressive, if not a touch insane. Fascination turned to empathy, which morphed into a sort of pity. For the sake of full disclosure, maybe it was his physical appearance that provoked the comparison, but I saw the same attitude in one Kurt Cobain. Treadwell, like Cobain, seemed to feel alienated by the world. Only that level of alienation is usually self- imposed/initiated, and at the same time uncontrollable or, maybe more precisely, the way life works (""all alone is all we are""). Both men's contempt for the world would seem completely justified to themselves, but to another might be seen as 'elitist mellancholy'. Nobody can possibly understand them, but at the same time their attitude towards those who don't borders on contempt; their tortured souls are beyond reproach. Treadwell's outburst at the Wildlife Department, and subsiquently, his former friends and colleagues only supports this. Was he someone who never grew up mentally or emotionally? Was he lost in his own mind, in his own world? A daydream believer? There's nothing wrong with having ideals, everyone should, but to dismiss the world that everyone shares is a grave mistake. The Kodiak Island grizzly expert's declaration (after Herzog's question) that Treadwell's need to protect the grizzlys was in fact probably harming them put the entire documentary into perspective for me. Maybe to be more precise, it was a confirmation.

I did, however, take Treadwell at his word when he said 'I would rather die in the wilderness than return' to the world he knew years prior in California; a definite self-fulfilling prophecy. There's a kind of beauty in it. In the end though, his and Huguenard's death can only be described as tragic. This film has the gravitas to teach as well as mystify, and really should be experienced. The scenes at the end of the film are particularly poignant and sobering. I sort of wanted Herzog to make the audio tape available, maybe accompanied by a warning... but at the same time, it's better that it wasn't. File it under morbid curiosity I guess.",1147392000,2,4029,5.073906485671191
2427795,5,B000BMY2NS,"It seems that the many negative reviews here have failed to grasp the intentions of this film. Grizzly Man is by no means intended for consumption exclusively by the coffee-house crowd, however if one is to gain any true understanding of its points it must be examined on a level somewhere beyond the superficial: Superficially we see an emotionally disturbed man floundering in the Alaskan wilderness, yet just inches below this superficiality we find a rare and amazing portraiture of a man's attempts to sublimate his feelings of alienation toward society at large.

Treadwell's questionable ability as a woodsman, the confused nature of his ""mission"", his eccentric enthusiasms or outbursts of anger; all these things are peripheral to the film, however seem to receive the most attention from its detractors. Treadwell is not an easy character to like, but the film does not require us to like him. Herzog neither condones nor condemns Treadwell's actions, and attempts to insert his own opinions into the narration in the least subversive way possible so as not to cloud his documentary with his own subjectivity. It is rare to find a film that encourages you to think for yourself and come to your own conclusions, yet it seems to me that because of this many people have concluded that the film is meaningless, asking ""Why did I waste my time watching some film about this loner screwball nut?""

The thing is that Grizzly Man isn't really about Treadwell. You don't have to like, agree, or even sympathise with him, because he is only the icon that Herzog uses for a much deeper examination of human nature. What IS required is that you empathise with Treadwell, if only on the most common level shared between any two human beings in the universe: the inextricable bond of our humanity.

The core of this film centres around the dichotomy between the individual and the exterior. We feel and know ourselves in a truer, more pure way than we can ever hope to know anything outside ourselves. The question of the honesty of the exterior is one that has been asked by philosophers for years, and if the universe is to retain whatever mystery we are yet to steal from it, is hopefully one that will never be answered. Though we will all assimilate into the world with varying degrees of success it is unavoidable that we will also be one step removed from it at the same time. Treadwell's response to this paradox was simply to remove himself from the human world entirely and assign emotions to creatures that clearly possessed none in order to find some semblance of the love that he believed he was denied.

Grizzly Man is not about bears. It is not about Alaska. It is not about the wilderness. It is not even about Timothy Treadwell. It's content is conceptual and intellectual, though by no means hard to understand. Grizzly Man is a celebration of humanity and of man's endless quest to gain a greater understanding of himself and all the bizarre and beautiful turns this quest can take. If you find yourself disappointed by things as superficial as the shaky camera or Treadwell's attitudes then you've almost certainly been watching the wrong film for the wrong reasons and before assigning a star rating, remember that you are reviewing a film, not a person.

Herzog's editing and the insight and understanding that he brings to his narration has created something close to a masterpiece. This is not a nature documentary and was never intended to be. It is a work of art.",1147219200,6,3487,4.795341098169717
2427796,5,B000BMY2NS,"Warning! This review reveals the end of the movie!

It became apparent from the first scene of ""Grizzly Man"" that I was watching raw film footage of a mentally ill man. Given that the bulk of the film consists of Timothy Treadwell talking into a camera, for the bulk of the film you, the audience member, seek entertainment or enlightenment from a raw encounter with a madman. Tourists used to visit asylums like Bedlam. As I watched this disturbing film, I asked myself, am I no better than those creepy tourists at Bedlam?

""Grizzly Man"" also rapidly became amazingly boring. I say ""amazingly"" because you wouldn't think that a film depicting such a naked encounter - man against nature, or, properly, nature against man -  would bore. But mentally ill people often are quite boring, and Treadwell, so lost inside his own sad, limited, dead-end mind, bored me.

I had to do a forced march through the boredom. And, I came to appreciate this movie as something it isn't marketed as at all, but definitely is. More on that, below.

Timothy Treadwell was a boyish, blond actor who spent thirteen summers doing primitive camping among what is sometimes labeled earth's largest land carnivore: Kodiak Island grizzly bears. (Polar bears are also sometimes labeled earth's largest land carnivore; let the bears duke it out for the title among themselves.) Treadwell and his willowy blonde companion, Amie Huguenard (you couldn't make these names up), were killed and devoured by a grizzly bear; the sounds of that attack were recorded by Treadwell's camera (the lens cap was left on . . . one can't help but think of the sad, sick jokes this might inspire.)

I knew all that going in, from a lengthy ""Vanity Fair"" expose; I thought, what can I get from this movie?

Werner Herzog adds minimal commentary. For the most part, you are watching film footage shot by Treadwell himself, of Treadwell himself. There are a few short scenes of the bush pilot who flew Treadwell in and out of his last campsite, the coroner who examined ""four garbage bags full of human remains"" pulled from the intestines of the killer grizzly, a Native American grizzly museum curator, Treadwell's suburban and normal parents, his flakey girlfriend Jewel Palovak, a male friend from California. No one advances any grand, overarching theory. Treadwell pere does indicate that losing the role of the bartender on ""Cheers,"" that went to Woody Harrelson, drove his son into a downward spiral.

Given the minimal commentary, viewers will inevitably interpret Treadwell according to their own agendas. Rush-Limbaugh, exploit-the-earth types will denounce Treadwell as an ""environmentalist wacko."" This is wrong, of course; Treadwell has as much to do with true environmentalism as Mohammed Atta has to do with safe aircraft piloting.

Treadwell was not an environmentalist. He was not a symbol of the frontier. He was not a man obsessed by love. What Treadwell was, was a narcissist. Did Herzog miss this? I don't know if Herzog uses the word ""narcissist"" once. But what made this movie ultimately worth watching, for me, was its -  perhaps inadvertent -  presentation of a classic case study of narcissism.

The word ""narcissism"" gets tossed around a lot, often in ways that obscure its true meaning. Narcissists are not people who love themselves too much; in fact, true narcissists don't love themselves at all.

Narcissists detest themselves, and avoid, at all costs, any encounter with their true selves. Narcissists seek artificial, choreographed encounters, which they script and control, in which they can be seen as the superior beings that they want to be understood to be.

Unlike Treadwell, most narcissists don't create their dramas by interacting with wild animals; most narcissists create their dramas by interacting with people whom they can fool, manipulate, and control. For this reason, narcissists often associate with people they perceive as being less intelligent than they are, or weaker in some sense. Narcissists often seek out children, the ill, or the poor, whom they cast as characters in their productions.

In any encounter, though, the narcissist is not running toward intimacy, either with the self or the other; the narcissist is running away from contact with the self and the other at top speed.

I can't think of any more perfect encapsulation for narcissism than the image most common in ""Grizzly Man."" Treadwell sets up his camera on a tripod, and then stands in front of the camera, filming himself, with grizzlies in the background.

Treadwell goes on and on, repetitively, about what a great man he is, saying so explicitly. ""I am a great man. I am doing great work. No one loves these grizzlies but I. No one is protecting these grizzlies but I. God is very happy with me"" -  he really says things like this. And the truly telling part of this triangle charade is this -  there is nobody there. There is no audience. Treadwell filmed himself without any other people around. There is no grizzly. Treadwell did not understand these animals at all. He attributed feelings to them that they do not feel. And there is no Treadwell. This is a man who spent his last breath resisting any real encounter with himself.

There is a scene in which the real Tim Treadwell appears. He releases a torrent of violent verbal abuse against the real protectors of the grizzlies, the parks department. If you want to see the true scabrous soul of a narcissist, catch that scene.

There is true human emotion in the movie; I admire the scene where Herzog warns Palovak never to listen to the tape of the fatal grizzly attack, and I admire the concern the coroner shows for the victims whose deaths he must unravel, on the basis of semi-digested human remains.",1146787200,7,5747,4.922440537745605
2427797,5,B000BMY2NS,"If the measure of art is how much you think about it after experiencing it then this documentary is a great film. It was so odd and so divorced from reality that I kept commenting to my friends that it felt like Christopher Guest movie. ""Waiting for Grizzly""? ""This is Grizzly Man""? Apparently I am not alone in that observation since at least one other reviewer saw it the same way.

It has amazingly beautiful footage of Alaska and grizzly bears which helps contrast the insanity that is Timothy Treadwell. From his incoherent rants against the park service (""f***ing nobodies! f***ing losers! f***! f***ing f***s!) to his rhapsodizing about his love for dead bumble bees and fresh bear excrement one can only watch in amazement as this madman slowly moves towards his own demise.",1146441600,3,782,4.835820895522388
2427798,2,B000BMY2NS,"I am honestly not convinced that this is in fact a documentary, because the footage shot by Herzog comes off like a awkwardly acted high school production.

The footage Treadwell shot is obviously real. His eccentricity seems almost too strange to believe, but that kind of over-the-top character is what makes him a worthy documentary subject to begin with.

However, the interviews and other supplementary footage done by Herzog feel so FAKE.

First, one of Treadwells friends talks about the day he heard that Treadwell was killed. The guys eyes dart to and from the camera like he was reading from a cue card as he delivers a monologue remeniscent of a track from William Shatners ""The Transformed Man"".

Throughout the film we meet other characters. His weird ex-girlfriend who gets giddy when she puts on the wristwatch that was taken off Treadwells corpse and marvels at the fact that it's still running. The coronor, who has the same actor-ish feel as the friend, gives her this watch while saying strange things like ""I want you to have this watch"", and ""This really should be yours"". Granted, I've never talked to a coroner before in my life, but I don't imagine them as the people who make decisions about who should have the deceased's property nor who make statements about how much the recipient, who they've never met, meant to the deceased, who they've also never met. It just doesn't add up. Additionally, the initial camera angle of this scene seemed too good to be true. The scene opens with the camera focused over a drawer, and we watch as a hand pulls out the evidence bag with the watch inside, holding it towards the camera for effect. It feels like Herzog must have certainly knew what was happenning, not documenting events as they unfold.

We also meet the man who did the autopsy on Treadwell and his girlfriend (not the same person as the Coroner that gave the watch). He shows us the metal transport box Treadwells body was brought to him in, lifting the lid up and allowing it to slam down in a dramatic fasion. Then, he recounts with a narrative flair the feelings he had as he did the autopsy, and how much character Treadwells girlfriend had to stay with him instead of running when the bear attacked them. Again, I've never met anybody who did this job before, but I would expect them, as people who are trained in that kind of work and have witnessed hundreds of dead bodies, to plainly and matter-of-factly discuss the process, not make emotional judgements on the nobility of the deceased. It felt me like the director told the man to ham it up for the camera.

The crowning glory of this all is a scene where Herzog shoots himself listening to the audio recording of Treadwell and his girlfriend's death (which we never get to hear). First off, in my opinion, it's generally poor taste for a director to insert himself into a film about something he wasn't a part of. But he does, and what's more, we see him telling Treadwells ex-girlfriend (who was given the watch and has this tape) that she must ""never listen to it"" and ""never see the photos"" of Treadwells autopsy. Finally, he tells her he thinks she should destroy the tape. Yes, a ""documentary"" film maker tells somebody to destroy a primary source of information on the topic.

From there on in, I could hardly watch the movie and take any of it seriously. We get a few more heavy-handed interviews with new people and those we have already met, and the film ends with Herzog telling us how important the movie we just watched was.

In all honesty, I do not believe this is a documentary. The supplementary footage is something Herzog dreamed up and created - it's just too unrealistic. Which is a shame, because the footage that Treadwell shot, and his unusual persona, could have been turned into a very good documentary.",1146009600,6,3821,4.658753709198813

There is a snideness that exists in ""indie"" films that mocks (rather severely) its characters.  They would have taken Timothy Treadwell and made him look like a fool with a snarky, snide attitude.  But Herzog isn't like that.  He treats Mr. Treadwell with a profound respect, and a genuine desire to understand him.  It's not a propaganda piece (Herzog shows that Timothy was a bit paranoid and had a dark streak), but Herzog shows respect for this man and his beliefs.  He also shows genuine sympathy towards him, like he was an outcast who could only fit in the Alaskan wilderness.  And kudos to Mr. Herzog for NOT playing the final recording of Timothy.  There would have been no reason for its inclusion, as it would add nothing except cheap shock value.

As Scott asserts, Herzog's movie is unintentionally hilarious, particularly the Huguenard part, but Treadwell's films were impressive when Treadwell got out of the way, as he finally did except for the watch that took a licking but kept on ticking.  (Pulp Fiction, anyone?  This watch ...)

Although the museum curator was correct that Treadwell breached grizzly sovereignity & was dangerously (for the bears) sensitizing them to human incursion, Treadwell's mania is appealing to those of us living lives of quiet desperation.  Tim's desperation was raucous & raunchy.  For 12 or 13 years he was superficially smarter than bears that didn't know enough to kill him on Day One.  And when he finally found a good day to die, it was probably a better death than most:  certainly a better lunatic death than dying at Happy Trails Nursing Home with tubes in his ureter, rectum, and trachea.

(An earnest, not snide, aside:  Was Tim's last girlfriend the cause of the killing?  Heard somewhere that male bears zero in on female human pheromones.)",1145836800,4,1287,5.042654028436019

His behavior was really immature and childish, and the more I watched the video, the less sympathy I had for him.  He did not realize that nature is indifferent to anything and everything.

2427803,2,B000BMY2NS,"When I checked out this movie, I had heard enough about Timothy Treadwell to expect more Steve Irwin than Jane Goodall. Still, I was hoping for some serious enlightment about the ways of bears. I was disappointed. There's precious little enlightenment to be had in this documentary. Aside from one sequence showing two male bears violently clashing over territory/mating rights - you won't see much about bear behavior at all. You will mostly see Treadwell making a spectacle of himself, prancing his way to his ultimate tragedy, strewing self-aggrandizement, goofy bear names, and irrelevant asides as he goes.

I was prepared to place almost all the blame for this on Treadwell himself. But then I read additional material about him that said he really did videotape thousands of hours of telling bear behavior and took thousands of pictures during his thirteen years in Alaska among the grizzlies. So the fact that there is so little substance in this film may be largely the fault of producer Werner Herzog.

Herzog makes grand claims of significance for this movie, as he does for most of his projects. But he is being his usual pompous, pretentious self, and betrays Treadwell and the bears in the process.

The only worthwhile part of this DVD is in the bonus material. Herzog is shown here helping coach the orchestra in composing and performing the sound track for the film. The resulting music is haunting and beautiful, with a feel for wild, wide-open spaces. They produce a musical theme worthy of Brokeback Mountain.

But otherwise, don't waste your money on this movie. If you want insights into bear behavior, you'd do better to check out the Discovery Channel film made about Treadwell. Or better yet, read a book such as Nick Jans' recently published The Grizzly Maze. Treadwell is there, in all his goofiness and ardor. But so are the bears.",1145318400,16,1859,4.910828025477707

Had Treadwell (ironic name) quit on the twelfth year, his films and biography, as well as TV contracts, could have garnered him immense wealth and all the adulation anybody could wish for.

But now for the dark side. Twenty years ago Treadwell would have been diagnosed as an untreated manic-depressive psychotic. Today's gentler term is ""bipolar."" Some of his tribe hate meds because during their manic phases they feel like they are on meth and heroin simultaneously. (And who wants that stopped?)

They acquire the stamina of three people; Their minds race uncontrollably with ideas; They disrespect human-decency boundaries; They are relentlessly obsessive; And they are commonly pathological liars who over-react to criticism. (Maybe that's why T.T. took great pains to blow smoke on his probable bisexuality.) Sixty percent of their output is brilliant, which helps to cover over the disastrous forty percent. Big business loves their workaholic natures. If you work for one and they drive you mad or into heart failure, they simply look at you and say, ""I didn't realize you were such a weakling.""

(Joan of Arc was probably bipolar.) The Treadwells helped settle the Wild West and will help build stations on the moon. But many of them are running around loose all over Africa harassing the wildlife. And like with Treadwell, men and women who smell imminent fame and fortune help prop them up.

2427805,1,B000BMY2NS,"wow. where to begin. First off, this film based on Timothy Treadwell's documentary/random camera footage unintentionally portrayed him as the unstable and psychologically ill man that he most likely was. Interviews with random people throughout this film painted an unflattering picture of both Timothy and his efforts. One man interviewed literally stated that ""He got was coming to him."" He would occasionally break from seemingly pointless footage of enormous grizzly bears doing everyday unremarkable things with the most chaotic and raving monologes attacking the government and basically civilization as a whole. The camera seemed to play the role of a ""confessional"" being that he would occasionally talk to the camera in the manner that a documentary film maker normally wouldn't. I think a rolling camera provided a kind of companionship that he most likely didn't share with human or animal. It was also strange to watch him chase after a fox that stole his dirty baseball cap with the intensity that he did. He was screaming and cursing at it and trying to COERCE AND EXPLAIN TO THE FOX how important that hat that he'd left on the ground was so vitally important to his work. He also wasn't at all qualified to be around these creatures. He tried at times to verbally discipline them as one would a puppy...an 800 lb ferocious puppy. I really don't understand how he thought he was ""protecting"" these animals as he stated he was. Hiding in bushes with a hand-held camera watching bears scratch their asses doesn't exactly qualify him as a hero defending the rights of wild animals. It's unfortunate to realize that the passionate love he had for these creatures wasn't reciprocated. I'm sure these bears looked at him with passive indifference at best. The bottom line is that this man should have been in the care of a doctor or facility equipped to cater to the needs of the mentally ill.",1145232000,10,1902,4.928348909657321
2427806,4,B000BMY2NS,"There is a difference between the theatrical release of ""Grizzly Man"" and this version on DVD.  In the original there is a clip from Timothy Treadwell's apperance of ""The Late Show With David Letterman"" where Letterman makes a joke about how the bears could eat Treadwell.  The audience roars with laughter and Treadwell looks daggers at Letterman.  It's a chilling moment in retrospect when you know what eventually happened to Treadwell.  On the DVD this clip has been replaced with a more innocuous bit of an interview with reporter Keith Morrison.  It's interesting to speculate why the Letterman clip was removed; perhaps Dave reconsidered his permission and thought it made him look like an insensitive jerk.  I don't think that's necessarily true; Dave's joke represented a skeptical view that Treadwell should have taken more seriously.

All that aside, ""Grizzly Man"" is one of the most tragic and haunting movies I have seen in a long time.  Along with Herzog's other amazing recent documentary, ""Little Dieter Needs To Fly"", it is more entertaining and thought-provoking than many fictional feature films.  Herzog once again tells the story of a half-mad dreamer who faces down death in the wilderness of our world.  It's a story he seems compelled to tell again and again (Fitzcarraldo, the monstrous Aguirre, Kaspar Hauser, Stroszek, etc.)  Herzog may believe that the essence of our world is ""chaos, hostility, and murder"" as he puts it in the movie, but he is drawn to unusual people who try to transcend this and find magic amidst the chaos.  Treadwell may have been a fool, but the director manages to extract meaning from his and his girlfriend's unnecessary deaths.  Herzog is one of our most remarkable filmmakers and ""Grizzly Man"" is one of his best films.",1145059200,9,1776,5.0

2427808,4,B000BMY2NS,"Like all the others mentioning the film's unintentional hilarity, I have to compliment Herzog on making such a dryly humorous work.  Treadwell had no business out there among the bears, and obviously had unplugged himself from reality long before his untimely demise.  I honestly think he was trying to work up a demo tape for a ""Crocodile Hunter"" type of program, with his over-the-top proclamations and such (suggesting the fishermen threatened to kill him the following year, f.ex.), and might have made the error into buying into the B.S. he was selling to others.  It's tempting to bring up Darwin when discussing a subject like this, but that's best left for the viewer to judge.  One last thing: another reviewer mentioned there were no actors in this film, apart from Timothy Treadwell.  This isn't so.  The fellow with the salt-and-pepper hair and apparent nose-job was a small-time actor friend of Tim's, and he seemed to be acting during his interview segments.  Perhaps that's unfair to suggest, but it seemed that his statements were contrived by his wording and the way he delivered them.  He was only moments away from shaking his fists at the heavens in outrage, which is something that few Joe Sixpacks have ever done or will ever think about doing.  The end result was a film about what happens when those that deal in fantasy have a head-on with reality and the tragedy that ensues.  There are no real lessons learned by Treadwell's death and nothing is gained by this film, in that if someone doesn't understand the dangers involved in undertakings such as Tim's, that is a person that is probably destined for an early death, anyway (playing chicken with trains, rattlesnake handling, playing with matches at the gas pump, or whatever).",1144540800,7,1757,4.905405405405405

Yes, the film showed his indiosyncrasies and some individuals came off strange, but none were actors with the exception of Treadwell.

Timothy Treadwell's own words and images, captured in 100+ hours of video journal plus interviews with friends, associates, lovers & families, detractors and admirers are all featured in an engrossing mix that most of all reveals the consummate skill of Werner Herzog. Fortunately, he uses a lot of the footage - it really is a visual treat - the bears are magnificently up close and personal.  Against the backdrop of this  ""nature film"" is a murder mystery, a love story, a mythic passion play of redemption. Anyone who read the article in Vanity Fair knows the story.  Treadwell's book ""Among Grizzlies"" is also wonderful. It is no preparation for actually hearing him, watching him in this film. One can't help but see the wounds that drove him to this extreme and what this extreme choice, basically rejection of ""civilization"" has cost him. The way Herzog presents it, Treadwell seems to be emotionally unraveling from the stress of long periods of isolation and more than once Herzog refers to Treadwell's ""demons"". I appreciated Herzog's editorializing which balanced the sentimentality of Treadwell and his female friends.  For example Treadwell's obsession that he was (the only one) protecting the bears when the sanctuary was already a state protected area and according to all official sources, there was no danger to the bears from anyone. Also the little staged ritual of 2 female friends returning his ashes to the bear sanctuary when since he was killed there surely his blood has long ago sunk into that earth which again illustrates that funeral/memorial rites are really for the living. Treadwell kept repeating that he would die for the bears, he clearly meant in battle with humans on their behalf. More than once it is surmised by the filmmaker and others, that there could be no real bonding going on between Treadwell and the bears. Whatever!  Finally,the bears - the land, the fabulous mountains - are the real stars of the movie and no one can speak for them. Their majesty speaks for itself.  Treadwell is a complex, endearing, quixotic character who projected his emotional needs indeed salvation onto another species. His story is only the latest.

But of course the most fascinating part of the documentary was Timothy Treadwell, told in his own words.  Watching him gradually lose touch with reality was a bit like watching a train wreck, as other reviewers have mentioned, but I didn't feel that the filmmaker did this in a sort of gratuitous way. Like I said, the footage speaks for itself.  Living in proximity with the bears as he did...acclimating the bears and the foxes to humans...humanizing them...it was unbelievable. Who doesn't know that you are NOT supposed to interact with wild animals in a way that will compromise their future safety?!?!?

It's interesting that he chose to protect something that didn't need protected.  Surely he knew that 6% of the bear population was destroyed annually due to overpopulation. Also interesting that he didn't rush to protect ""Quincy"" when strangers were throwing rocks at him. A true ""hero in his own mind.""

2427817,4,B000BMY2NS,"""Grizzly Man"" was my introduction to Timothy Treadwell's life and work, though I vaguely recall hearing of his tragic 2003 death.  Sadly, his death has come to outweigh his life....while Werner Herzog's film avoids most of the gory details, five minutes into the movie you know Treadwell was killed by a grizzly, and that specter haunts the remainder of the film.

Under Herzog's skillful editing and direction, more than 100 hours of footage shot by Treadwell are interspersed with interviews with those who were close to him, providing a tantalizing, yet somehow incomplete portrait of Treadwell's life and the 13 years he spent living among grizzlies.  Footage Treadwell shot in the hope of making a nature documentary quickly shows him as the central character, at least in Herzog's view.  And a remarkable character he is....part Johnny Appleseed, part Don Quixote, part lovable lunatic.

But is this truly who Treadwell was?  Many of the details of his life and of those who were close to him are omitted completely.  Herzog uses Treadwell's footage to present his lifelong vision of nature as the untouchable primeval, and Treadwell as one who, in seeking the simplicity of wildness, took one step too far into the heart of darkness.  One ends up watching the disintegration of a personality before the cold eye of a lens....was this really what happened?  Only Treadwell knows for sure.

Herzog seems not far off the mark, but if one avails oneself of other available resources (three books including one by Tim Treadwell himself, along with any number of online items), a far more complex picture emerges, of which Herzog managed to capture only one (and to be fair, the most obvious) facet.  Tim Treadwell remains a mystery to the vast majority of us--even Werner Herzog admits as much.  And perhaps he is a riddle which is more fascinating if one makes no attempt to solve it.

A beautifully crafted film, worthy of multiple viewings.  But please, consider it an introduction to Timothy Treadwell and far from a definitive portrait of him.  Other resources will fill in some of the blanks, but others remain blank, very possibly by Treadwell's intention.  It is best, when all is said and done, to learn what one can and respect what he chose to keep to himself.",1143331200,2,2273,4.9109947643979055
2427818,5,B000BMY2NS,"So were some of the final words spoken by Timothy Treadwell and recorded by his own video camera in a documentary wherein most of the brilliant footage was shot by the deceased. Let me say at outset that this is an absolutely magnificent film. Its excellence is rarely encountered. Indeed, it is one of the few documentaries I ever longed to play a second time after it finished.

Treadwell was an environmental activist, and also, as his narrative makes clear, a very emotionally disturbed person. He failed at making it in society so he turned to the wilderness and the world of the ""misunderstood"" bear as a means to find fulfillment. He went to Alaska every summer to ""save them"" from poachers, but, as an authority stated, the animals were not in need of saving. Their population was so robust they needed to be culled by hunters each year. That the bears somehow needed Treadwell is just one of the many lies this man embraced. One person phrased it aptly: ""He has styled himself the Prince Valiant of the bears.""

The main character is quite pathetic, but the viewer has difficulty feeling sympathy for him due to his negligence in regards to his girlfriend, Amie Huguenard. I have never encountered an individual in my entire life with a bigger death wish that Treadwell. On camera, he imagines his own death several times, yet this supposedly compassionate person stayed with his girlfriend long past the gorged days of summer, and remained amidst the bears while the desperate ones searched for any scrap of nutrients in the hopes of surviving the winter. That he had not ever remained in the grizzly maze past summer before is evidence of his scripting his own demise, and allowing Huguenard to die alongside him was despicable. I'm a very politically incorrect man, and I don't buy into female victimization as a rule-except in this case. Treadwell led the poor woman to her death. Her biggest mistake was trusting the bipolar delusionist in the first place. In the film, he makes repeated references to wishing he were a homosexual, which his words, more so than his obvious effeminacy, suggest that he was struggling with a great many aspects of life. If you ask me, had his girlfriend possessed Gaydar then her death, the only truly tragic aspect of this calamity, might not have occurred.

The ex-girlfriend, Jewel, seemed eager to be cast into the role as Treadwell's ""widow."" She tried too hard to grieve. Director Herzog's voice overs were perfect in tone and messsage.

And the protagonist, Tim Treadwell, who claimed to despise the civilized world, spent the last 13 years of his life trying to appeal to it by way of his loving ""relationships"" with large mammals, creatures that desire to have nothing to do with human beings. I admire Treadwell's passion and pluck, but I believe he believed that if he pretended a line between the species did not exist, it would not exist.

2427831,4,B000BMY2NS,"Anyone the least bit familiar with the films of Werner Herzog knows how he's drawn to the offbeat personality, the slightly tilted sanity, the irrationally driven -- things which make a film compelling to some, ridiculous to others, and downright off-putting to still others.  One might describe it as a morbid fascination, perhaps even a kinship.  Timothy Treadwell is definitely a personality of this ilk.  Sure, he's no genuine hero, but had he lived in another time, might he not have been a less sanitized and un-Redfordized version of Jeremiah Johnson?  Like Johnson, Treadwell is the stuff of myth -- at least post-Herzog.

While Herzog usually places these individuals in equally offbeat scenarios with a keen sense of ""place"" and ""condition""; here, most of the subject footage was already shot by Treadwell and his female companion on location in Alaska's Katmai National Park -- and wonderful footage it is!  We see firsthand his developing megalomania and severe detachment while being witness to his symbiosis with some of the most terrifying beasts on Earth. I don't wish to belittle the ultimate tragedy of it all, but the Treadwell footage must've had Herzog chomping at the bit; this was right up his alley!

Herzog attempts to explain and perhaps even justify Treadwell's strange stance through interviews of those who were closest to him in life as well as his post-mortem existence.  Other reviewers make a point of the seeming ""staginess"" of these interiews; one even suggests that as viewers, we were being had.  While I can't outright dismiss the possibility that the interviews were staged or even loosely scripted, I just never got that impression.  Frankly, most of these complaints are weak.  The story was simply too compelling to be concerned with the absolute veracity of it. Again, such is the stuff of myth.  There was indeed plenty that felt left untold; it was probably a better film because of it.

Folks, this isn't a nature documentary on the habits and habitat of the grizzly bear. This isn't a how-to film on wilderness camping. The only subject here is Treadwell -- a portrait drawn through a singular cinematic sensibility. For those complaining about the questionable motives of the film's subject or the malposed perspective of this so-called ""documentary"", welcome to the whacked-out world of Werner Herzog.

It must be seen to be believed, could be one of the best films of 2005/2006, and certainly raises a hair or two, including the final moments where the ecentric Treadmill probably filmed himself with his murderer. Just watch this and be amazed at the stunning one on one bear footage never seen in the wild this way before, coupled with the local coroner describing how Timothy recorded himself on camera, telling his girlfriend to run away while screaming as the bear tore his skull open.

2427833,4,B000BMY2NS,"Werner Herzog (Director) puts this documentary into a visible masterpiece of a man gone awry. Timothy Treadwell's one hundred plus hours of video footage is condensed into a two hour storyline that borderlines schizophrenic.

Werner Herzog combines interviews of friends, lovers, DNR employees and parents to try to make sense of a man and his obsession with grizzly bears. Timothy Treadwell spent thirteen years in the Alaska Katmai National Park and reserve observing and naming all of the grizzlies that he encounters. Some think that Timothy was acting out as a grizzly. He was acting and thinking like a grizzly in his eyes. The video gives insight into Timothy's modus vivendi.

  The last five seasons he brought along a video camera. The grizzly video is visually remarkable.  The video of Timothy talking into the camera trying to convince the viewers to understand his love for the bears is like watching a man with a death wish. Towards the end of his death the video clearly shows his lost sense of reality. He really thinks that the grizzlies are his friends and not food.

Every viewer clearly understands that these are wild animals. The video takes me back to the first ""Blair Witch Project"" when everyone thought it was real. I felt lucky that was not me in that video. Same of this one, but this video is REAL. And it shows how a man can lose his sense of reality.

2427834,4,B000BMY2NS,"I just finished watching GRIZZLY MAN, the true documentary of the adventures (and final misadventure) of Timothy Treadwell, the man who spent each summer for 13 years living among the grizzly bears in an effort to protect them.  I have to say that this movie will probably do more to set back the cause of environmentalism than any other single event so far this century!

Poor Mr. Treadwell clearly had some very serious mental health issues that were going untreated.  There was a reference to his having gone to a doctor once and being given some sort of prescription that he took for awhile and then quit because the ""highs and lows are part of my personality"".

The film is made up mostly of Mr. Treadwell's own video footage in which he clearly showed his lack of knowledge of how to behave around a large, dangerous animal, rambled on about his insecurities and his wish that he were gay because it is easier to get sex, emotional, abusive outbursts against the park service that allowed him to camp all summer every summer for 13 years, declarations of love directed at the animals and a statement of  his catcher-in-the-rye-like need to ""protect"" them, paranoid fear expressed when admirers leave mementos for him to discover when he returns for the season, etc.  Indeed, one local stated that he felt Mr. Treadwell had only survived among the bears for so long because they sensed there was something wrong with him.  A lot of the footage is oddly reminescent of JONATHAN WINTERS ATTIC: A big crazy, creative kid, playing all by himself.

Producer, Werner Herzog, expresses admiration for Mr. Treadwell's film making ability, and there is some beautiful and unusual animal footage.  Best is the footage with the foxes, who became like pets to him.  But one wonders about, and a local expressed concern over, the fact that acclimating wild animals to humans makes them vulnerable to abuse by humans.  And, indeed, in one scene, Mr. Treadwell is hiding in the bushes filming as one of his almost tame bears gets rocks thrown at it for approaching too closely to a group of people.  He expresses shock and rage and clearly does not understand that he has caused this situation.

Werner Herzog compounds the damage to environmentalism by making several statements during the film along the lines of, ""Timothy Treadwell thought the world was united by love and beauty, but I believe the opposite.  It is united by chaos, destruction, and death.""  and ""When I look at this (bear's) face I see nothing but the primitive need to survive and feed.""  (These are not exact quotes, but quotes as I remember them - pretty closely!)

Now, it may sound like I hated this movie, but I didn't.  It was strange and fascinating and almost painful to watch.  Fortunately, we do not hear the final tape (which is audio only) in which Mr. Treadwell and his girlfriend are killed by a bear.  We only hear about it.  For my tastes, Werner Herzog left too much unanswered.  I would have appreciated some statements from real wildlife researchers who could explain how extremely foolhardy and unusual Mr. Treadwell's actions were and shed light on the proper process for studying and protecting wildlife.  (Incidentally, these bears did not need Mr. Treadwell's protection.  They were already protected.)  I would also like to hear the opinions of some mental health professionals regarding Mr. Treadwell's apparent bi-polar and/or schizophreniform disorder and what might have been done to help and protect him.  I think someone really dropped the ball there!  I am afraid that, without this added information, this movie may leave a lot of people (who already think this anyway) thinking that all environmentalists are like this!

Separately, the soundtrack is excellent!  It is so excellent that we don't even notice it while watching the movie.  It is only in watching the bonus feature, which is a documentary of the making of the soundtrack that we realize what a work of art it is.  I strongly recommend watching this.

I actually would like to see this story made into a well-researched and documented feature-length movie.  I would like to know more about this man and how he came to the place he did.  I would like to know more about his relationships and the overdose incident that is mentioned and his childhood...and so on.  I would like a little more speculation about how and why he and his girlfriend ended up back at their camp instead of returning home (as they started out to do) at the end of the season.  What transpired between them?  Did they fight?  Did this affect the behavior of the bears?  (Incidentally, the bears in the area at the time they were killed were NOT the bears that were normally there during the summer.  They were apparently killed by a bear they did not know.)

I really would like to see more exploration of this story, and I would like to see it played by Owen Wilson.  The physical and speaking similarities between Timothy Treadwell and Owen Wilson are startling!  I almost thought Timothy Treadwell was Owen Wilson at the start of the movie, and a lot of the distance shots of him walking around, going for a swim with a bear, etc., could easily be used in a movie with Owen Wilson playing him. I think Owen Wilson is the kind of actor who would do this odd and complex character justice, and I'd like to see him try.",1142726400,,5351,4.745670995670996

2427837,1,B000BMY2NS,"I thought that this film would be a type of documentary about grizzlies. It is actually about an incredibly naive, egocentric young man who knew precious little about grizzly bears. Most of the film spends its time showing Timothy Treadwell talk about HIMSELF, about HIS experience with the bears, about HIS fearlessness, about HIS gripes with the Park Service personnel. That he survived several seasons in close proximity to Alaskan grizzlies was due to dumb luck, and not to any  knowledge about bears on his part. There are common sense, survival reasons why one should follow Ranger advice about grizzlies; for example, one should stay at least 100 yards away from a bear in the wild; why? Because the bear could kill you. Simple. Treadwell talks and talks about his love for the bears, yet he showed his lack of respect for their essential wild nature by talking to them and treating them as if they were his pets. Dangerous madness! This guy lectured children about bears? I only hope he told them DON'T do as I do. Yes, it is tragic that he was ultimately killed by a bear but, really, his disrespect for their wildness made such a tragedy inevitable. What I find appalling is that he needlessly exposed his girlfriend to the danger, and she also was killed. His carelessness also resulted in the necessary killing of the bear that killed him.

If you see this film, see it as an example of how not to be with bears, or any other predator. He should have left them in peace.",1142380800,71,1482,4.6311787072243344

obviously suffered from some form of severe undiagnosed mental illness,
which is pathetically showcased for all the world to see in the footage of this film.
Now he is dead, along with a naive friend,
because he decided to tread where no one had tread before.
I hesistate to use the phrase ""dared tread"", because the courage of the insane can scarely be considered real courage at all.
But despite Treadwell's meaningless self-sacrifice, and his callous and wonton sacrifice of his thoroughly bewildered female companion,
the man (boy? child?) shot some of the most incredible film footage of Alaskan grizzly bears ever captured.
Those shots, and the shots of the severe and foreboding Alaskan landscape he became psychologically lost in, make this film worth watching.
But be forewarned, it will be a disturbing watch at best.
It will be an infuriating and exasperating watch at worst when one is subjected to Treadwell's pitiful whining blubbering outbursts of pseudo self-examination
and his raging condemnations of others whom he perceives as not cleaving to his unusual world-view.
The best thing about this film is the musical score,
and the special feature included that chronicles the jam session that led to its creation: ""In the Edges: the 'Grizzly Man' Sessions"".
Seeing the cinematic hero Werner Herzog in the same room with the music hero Richard Thompson is more than worth the price of admission.
Truely, the musical feature program is the most valuable, and the only reason I would buy this DVD.
Richard Thompson is one of the greatest, most facile, and most original guitar players (and singer-songwriters) of this or any era.
His dedicated fans will recognize in the soundtrack the melody line of a twenty-year-old song called ""The Razor's Edge"" (perhaps an appropriate choice from Richard for use in this film) from his (sadly currently unavailable on CD) monumental instrumental album ""Strict Tempo"".
In the end,
the image that stays with me the most from the entire effort is from the musical special feature.
It is of Richard Thompson's long and graceful fingers working the fretboard of his Stratocaster,
with Werner Herzog sitting in the background, his face transformed with a look of ecstatic transport.

2427851,5,B000BMY2NS,"""Grizzly Man"" explores the life and death of naturalist and filmmaker Timothy Treadwell, who was killed in 2003, along with girlfriend Amie Huguenard, by one of the Alaskan grizzly bears he had spent over a decade trying to protect and befriend. But ""Grizzly Man"" doesn't cast Treadwell in the heroic light of a wildlife activist or the tragic pall of someone who met a gruesome death. Director Werner Herzog challenges Timothy Treadwell's world view just as he tries to faithfully present it. Treadwell spent 13 summers in remote Alaskan wilderness closely observing, filming, and attempting to socialize with grizzly bears. He shot 100 hours of footage of the bears and himself in the last 5 years, some of which we see in this film. His ebullient personality made him a popular bear educator with schoolchildren. But Timothy Treadwell's sentimental view of grizzly bears and of himself as their friend and protector was undoubtedly delusional. Herzog, who narrates the film, admires Treadwell's commitment to filmmaking but criticizes his self-serving view of nature.

It is unclear what to make of Timothy Treadwell's obsession with Alaska's grizzly bears, and that's what makes ""Grizzly Man"" so interesting. The film isn't about wildlife conservation, a subject upon which it barely touches. Perhaps it is about self-delusion. Timothy Treadwell's self-appellation ""kind warrior"", his belief that a strong face could repel an aggressive bear, the idea that those bears paid any attention to him at all would be strictly comical if Treadwell were not an essentially sincere and likable character. He treated the bears not as wild animals or even as equals, but, bizarrely, as pets. He was an alcoholic who transferred his emotional needs to a fanatic defense of grizzly bears. But Treadwell didn't choose to fight for bears in need of protection. He chose to call himself ""protector"" of  the stable bear population on Kodiak Island.

Yet Treadwell did get a lot of enviable film footage of those bears (by breaking the law). He did educate people about them. He had an appealing sense of humor and revealed more of himself on film than most people would dare. A guy on an ego trip? Certainly. Did he get what he asked for? Maybe. In the end a bear probably killed Treadwell simply because it was hungry, not because it was annoyed, which goes to show how completely indifferent the grizzlies were to Treadwell's efforts to live among them. Perhaps we are supposed to see some of Timothy Treadwell's self-delusion in ourselves. It's there in everyone. Treadwell's case is far from being the most destructive I've seen. But Werner Herzog has done a fantastic job of distilling it. And ""Grizzly Man"" is pretty even-handed in its sensitivity to Treadwell's supporters, detractors, observers, and to Treadwell himself.

The DVD (Lion's Gate 2005): ""In the Edges: The Grizzly Man Session"" (53 min) is a chronicle of the 2-day recording session of ""collective improvisation"" in December 2004 for the film's score.

2427853,3,B000BMY2NS,"Summary

Grizzily Man is about Treadwell who spent 13 summers among grizzily bears. He took the last 5 years and taped over 100 hours of footage of his relationship and connection to the bears. It is a documentary. It also talks a lot about his death from the those who found him and his girlfriend to the medical examiner. You meet his friends and foes. People who agree with his trek and those who do not.

Critique

The footage was beautiful in this film. It shows how close Treadwell got to the bears but it wasn't so much about the bears as it was about the man. I guess that is why it was called Grizzily Man. But I don't think the movie did him much justice, we get a little background about Treadwell and why he probably decide to live with the bears, but there could have been more depth in that. I wanted to see more about the bears. He had over 100 hours of film and yet this documentary is 50 minutes, why am I not getting at least 2-3 hours of Treadwill. I really felt I didn't know Treadwell, only a taste of who the man was and his bears. I mean he was mentally ill but that's all.

I also disliked the fact that they stay so long on his death. And then didn't even let us hear him dying. The director of the film states he didn't want this to be a snuff film, but gave as long narratives from the medical examiners of what he heard on the tape, the person who found him, and the park rangers version of events. What for? If we didn't need to know why mention it? Then we watch the director listen to the actual tape of him dying. Oh please that was so not needed. I felt if we were going to hear on and on about his death...let me hear it and chose to turn it off or at least make it a Special Feature. I am not being morbid, but basically the movie was about Treadwell and his death.

The music and the bears were very good. And I wanted to see more! I wanted to learn more about these bears. I learned really nothing. Only that after 13 years you can be killed by one. Some of the director's footage was at times odd. Some of Treadwell's friends seem to be acting when they knew they were on camera. Suddenly sniffing or in tears and saying they missed him. Did they really? Or did they want to be a part of a movie that would make money? Hm?

This is why I gave it 3 stars, because the movie was really unorganized and not very well told. Some parts were eerie, ""Here is the last shot a couple of hours before Treadwell's death."" I am like wow, but wouldn't it be interesting to know this for sure. How would I know? The footage wasn't dated at the bottom of the television to tell me so. No documentation of any kind.

Reflection

Again, I enjoyed the scenes and nature. I liked seeing those bears close up and I believe Treadwell did a wonderful job getting close to them. However he wasn't wise and that is why he died. I just wish this film honored him for what he truly did...getting close to those bears for 13 years. Not some 50 minutes survey. It was so clear that this film was rushed. And that is sad.

Suggestion

I think there should be another serious movie about Treadwell. One more organized and well thought out. I would have greatly appreciated more information. And although, I am not to unhappy about my DVD, I am not happy with the way it was done.

You can buy it now or later. It is a fair film. But you can wait and save your money. Because believe me for the price 50 minutes isn't enough.

And those are my thoughts....",1141689600,3,3463,4.144560357675112
2427854,2,B000BMY2NS,"It's somehow disingenuine (perhaps even arrogant) for some reviewers to suggest that if a person did not like or appreciate the film, that they simply misunderstood Herzog's intent.

Treadwell, a self-proclaimed, misunderstood social misfit and failed actor, sought refuge and acceptance among the grizzlies in Alaska for 13 summers until his death by mauling with partner Amy. Post mortem, Herzog managed to canabilize his memory and whatever dignity Treadwell had remaining, by exploiting his illness through carefully compiled  video ramblings and ravings (filmed by Treadwell), supplemented with interviews of friends, family, and locals,  all in the name of a ""human interest story"".  [Has society fallen so far?]

The film is an expose` of Treadwell's life with the bears as defined by the parameters of his illness, culminating in a death which was long invited by foolish/cavalier actions and his tempting fate. [Treadwell played in-your-face Russian Roulette with ""top of the food chain"" big brown bears.]  Unfortunately, Herzog took the wrong approach with his project.  Instead of producing a winning documentary about Treadwll's beloved bears -- using Treadwell (with his idiosyncrasies) as the vehicle through which the story was told, together with more nature video -- he did the opposite: he created a film about a sick man, using the bears and Alaska as a backdrop.  It was offensive, while lacking in any true educational or intellectual value. Some may possibly argue that Grizzly Man is entertaining, but in a macabre, uncomfortable, intrusive way.

Can this film be considered art? No. For something to qualify as art, it needs to be truthful in its form and purpose.  This film is not. It intentionally tries to deceive the viewer through creative use of editing:  Herzog attempts to project the film as an empathetic biography, but it simply exploits a dead man.

Watch if you must, but if you're in the documentary mood, there are many other better choices out there. It is uncomfortable and disturbing -- at best.",1141603200,12,2038,5.217791411042945
2427855,4,B000BMY2NS,"I bought this movie for my husband - we had taken a trip to Alaska several years ago and saw a bear, so we were very interested in the subject matter.  This movie left us contemplating what seemed like a very troubled man, possibly one with some mental issues.  The excerpts from the original footage are very stirring (beware of the R-rated language in many of them) and the interviews with those who knew him are heartfelt and well-done.

We think the filmmaker is definitely trying to sway the viewer without actually coming right out and declaring his intention, and this makes the film pretty intriguing - the excerpts and the interviews he has chosen to include are fairly ""telling"" - but I'll leave it up to the purchasers to decide for themselves what the message is here.

I would recommend this movie - the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of all the bad language - I'm glad I didn't sit down to watch it the first time with children!  Although the excerpts that contain the language (extreme use of the f-word) are helpful in allowing the filmmaker to continue his point, it's not exactly family-friendly.",1141603200,,1131,4.606965174129353
2427856,4,B000BMY2NS,"I had read all the headlines, magazine articles, and books that came out about Treadwell after his mauling and I never really felt that I could believe anyone's descriptions and opinions about Timothy.  This movie allowed Timothy to talk for himself and for the first time I think I have an idea of who Timothy was.  I still think he was irresponsible and a little over the edge, but actually hearing Treadwell talk was more authoratative than all the other authors who wrote about him (even though much of his dialog was obviously for the camera.)  The result is pretty surreal and often disturbing.

Werner Herzog does a decent job of directing the story line and keeping it interesting but occasionally scenes seem scripted or contrived.  It really does end up feeling like a Christoper Guest mocumentary like Waiting for Guffman or Best of Show. He is not a detached documenter, he definitely had his conclusions and pushes them in the movie, but Treadwell's footage tells the real story of a man who is not right with the world yet looking for acceptance, fame, and recognition from that world.  And occasionally the footage shows a man who has been alone too long.

I recommend that anyone who has heard of the story, watch this movie.  It will probably just re-enforce your opinions but it's entertaining along the way.  The bonus features are limited to trailers, previews, and a featurette about making the soundtrack which was okay but not something you would ever watch twice.",1141603200,5,1487,4.822834645669292

By anthropomorphizing bears ,or any other animal, it causes harm to them and any other human that comes it contact with that animal.  By attaching human emotion to a bear...by thinking a bear reacts to it's environment like a human is simply incorrect.  The only reason this misguided man was able to survive as long as he did is because the bears had a more nutrient-filled food source available to them in the river.  And maybe because their is hunting on Kodiak. Which is the one of the reasons Kodiak Grizzlies are so prolific on that island.  I hope people don't take anything he says as fact or even as a theory on grizzly behavior.  This film was edited to create as much emotion and drama as it could from a pile of aimless raw footage.

2427858,5,B000BMY2NS,"I won't go into much detail about the movie.  It's very good: moving, beautiful, and illuminating (although Herzog has his own spin on Treadwell's life that may be inaccurate or even intentionally misleading).  As a piece of art it's unimpeachable.

My primary reason for submitting this is to comment on the many sub-imbecilic reviews that are already here.  Read them for yourself - just scroll through a few pages and read all the one star reviews.  I'm not going to argue that anyone who dislikes the movie are automatically wrong, but the reasons given in all the one star reviews here are comical.  Most of them focus on how much the reviewer dislikes Treadwell, or thinks he's not such a heroic guy, or how he wasn't helping the bears at all.  Sarcastic voice on: NO, REALLY???  That's the subject of the documentary!  That's the focus of a lot of Herzog's commentary!!  This isn't a cude-and-cuddly nature doc like ""March of the Penguins,"" and it ain't the newest episode of ""The Crocodile Hunter.""  It's a documentary about Timothy Treadwell, who was an actor, a phony, a mixed-up kid, and a well-meaning danger to himself and others.  The movie presents a VERY flawed man, no holds barred.  Your great insight into his character and his motives was gained from watching this movie.  You don't dislike the movie, you dislike Treadwell.  If you *do* dislike the movie, it's because you completely misunderstood it.  Herzog isn't presenting Treadwell as a hero  - and for those of you who are REALLY confused, the movie wasn't made by the admittedly self-promoting Treadwell, either, even though much of the footage shown was shot by him.

Finally, the people who think the documentary is fake need to do a little legwork.  Look up the book ""The Grizzly Maze"" the next time you're in a bookstore (if that ever happens), or do a quick internet search for news articles about Timothy Treadwell.  The documentary's subject and participants are quite real, even if some of them seem to spend a lot of time acting.

2427860,5,B000BMY2NS,"Grizzly Man is the story of Timothy Treadwell, a wildlife advocate and educator, author, and environmentalist who lived among the giant grizzly bears of Kodiak island for thirteen summers. Treadwell took myriad photographs as well as documented hours of footage of the bears, red foxes, and his musings on life and nature.

In the fall of 2003, Treadwell and his girlfriend Amie were eaten alive by an old and starving grizzly who had come in from the inland while all the bears Tim knew had already begun their hibernation. Tim and Amie had already left for the year. He returned on a whim. In the last moments of the film, it is like watching a horror movie where you yell for the characters to run. Everything screams danger: the ominous gray skies, absence of wildlife, cold winds, and this lone bear who will not look Treadwell in the face.

The film is really worth seeing. I highly recommend it. Completely mesmerizing from start to finish, it touches your heart because of Treadwell's childlike character. As far as those reviewers who see his actions as reckless and stupid, it is because of insensitive people like them that Treadwell was driven into the wilderness. Nature is cruel, but so-called civilization is worse.

I am surprised that no comparisons were made in the film to the 1970's series Grizzly Adams, which was based on the true story of Adams. Adams lived happily among wildlife in the Sierra Nevada in the 1850's - then prime grizzly and cougar habitat. The call of the wild is very powerful. People who at their very essence love nature want to be a part of it to some degree. In cases like Treadwell, Henry David Thoreau, Farley Mowhat (Never Cry Wolf), and Diane Fossey (Gorillas in the Mist) this love is taken to an extreme.

As the director of Grizzly Man says, the movie can teach us about our own nature.

To explain Treadwell's heart, here is the theme from Grizzly Adams. Hauntingly apt.

Deep inside the forest there's a door into another land.
Here is our life and home.
We are staying here forever in the beauty of this place all alone.
We keep on hoping.
Maybe there's a world where we don't have to run.
Maybe there's a time we'll call our own, living free in harmony and majesty.

I first saw Grizzly Man on the big screen and was blown away by its profundity.  I was in turn in awe, dis-belief, empathetic, insulted, amused and angered by the enigmatic Treadwell.  Was he to be pitied, praised, ridiculed, admired?  Those are unaswerable questions.  I've since watched the film four times and each time I come away with a different opinion of him and often those opinions are conflicting.  One thing is for certain, it is a beautiful and compelling film.  The reality of Tim and Amy's brutal death at the hands of his beloved bears harbors an ominous and dark fog that underscores every minute of the film.

One feels as though he/she is watching a slow motion train wreck in progress, which of course, proves to be the case. Treadwell is a lost social soul seeking peace, purpose, and understanding among the bears. The audience becomes a reticent voyeur in his journey -- watching Treadwell's attempt at self-catharsis through communing with these bears in their Alaskan wilderness, being dragged along through his struggle with a variety of emotional demons, witnessing his delusions of self-inflated purpose and dictated importance to these bears, and ultimately, being forced to follow his descent toward death over the course of 13 summers (..... fully narrated along the way). I likewise felt the movie exploited Treadwell's story for gain..... while pitifully attempting to masquerade as a sympathetic eulogy and human interest story. The movie itself is otherwise technically well-made, and would likely serve as an interesting case-study to both psychologists and psychiatrists, but I find no redeeming social value or message in either Treadwell's intent or misguided endeavors, the promotion or suggestion that his misguided endeavors were somehow noble or served some higher purpose (getting oneself and a friend killed .... for no reason?), or in general, the movie itself relative to its overall content or purpose. As a person with a sense of humanity and compassion, I can only recommend that one watch Grizzly Man simply to ""be in the know"", and of course, in order to draw your own conclusions, as some persons have actually enjoyed it.

Yet the story, which I think this documentary DVD is the most objective telling, is extremely compelling, for wildlife lovers or anyone with an interest in man's relationship with nature.  Treadwell lived surrounded by bears, in their natural habitat, for 13 years before he was killed.  This is an amazing feat in itself, it shows that he must have been very adept at interpreting bears' behavior and attitudes.  From the documentary he had obviously come to know each bears' individual personality. Most of the times the bears view him indifferently, or with mild curiosity, sometimes with mild hostility and at the last as a food item.  He did gain a measure of tolerance, and was able to take some absolutely incredible footage of the bears' lives, from struggles with drought and starvation, males fighting over females, mothers raising young.

Yet therein lies the controversy.  He obviously knew that he would most likely be eventually killed by a bear, which is no surprise considering how closely he would try to associate with them. Most would consider this to be ultimate irresponsibility. It doesn't do the bears any favors; nothing good can come to a bear that's been habituated to human presence, or that has gotten a taste for human meat.  But it does show just how closely humans can come to understanding and sharing empathy with wild animals, and how much we have in common. If that knowledge can help the current state of affairs where people consider themselves separate and apart from nature, and to more fully understand our relationship with nature, it will have been worthwhile.",1140998400,2,1863,4.980645161290322

You should turn away but on some low, shameful level it's fascinating so you don't.  Timothy Treadwell treated grizzly bears, one of the most dangerous animals in America, like they were Disney teddies come to life and was roundly despised by many professional naturalists. It is amazing that he survived as long as he did before getting eaten.

That said, the documentary is really superb. It shows you who Treadwell was and it shows you in a crystal clear way why his death was inevitable. There are two scenes in the film that are unforgetable. The first is Treadwell having a cursing tantrum in front of the camera (anybody walking in on him at that moment would've slowly backed away and run for their car) and the second is when the doctor who autopsied what was left of Treadwell is interviewed.

Grizzly Man is a gut wrencher and and outstanding piece of work. It pulls off a nearly impossible trick. It tells the story of an unlikable person and manages to make you care and feel sorrow for his fate.",1140912000,17,1103,4.5606060606060606
2427879,1,B000BMY2NS,"...call me cynical but the whole film smells like a hoax...the interviews sound as if they were scripted and performed by actors -- bad actors I might add...Treadwell acts and sounds flamingly gay and in every scene appears fresh, pale skinned and cleanly shaven despite ostensibly enduring months in the Alaskan wilderness...overall he leaves an impression that he would be lucky to survive the night at a Malibu beach party much less a confrontation with a grizzly bear...and the fact that it was directed by Werner Herzog does nothing for its credibility -- ask anybody who has seen that testament to stupidity ""Incident at Loch Ness""...no, something's not right here -- someone's getting their leg pulled, I think.",1140912000,23,718,5.093220338983051

After the first 30 minutes, I began questioning the validity of its claims.

2427881,4,B000BMY2NS,"I liked this movie but I have to agree with all the reviews (who rate it both good and bad) that say Timothy Treadwell is emotionally and mentally ill.  It's true: the most amazing thing about his story was that he wasn't killed and eaten any sooner.

I sympathize with the family and friends for their loss, but I can't gloss over what a crazy, grandstanding and ultimately suicidal ""mission"" this was.  He wasn't exactly Diane Fossey, who literally fought poachers off the mountain gorillas in Rwanda--these bears were in a state park.

Absolutely NOTHING in science or life tells Treadway or anyone else that it's safe to live with bears.  He ventures into the wild and lives in a constant state of delusion, even as the bears kill and eat each other, his cute little foxes, the adorable little cubs.  As Herzog points out, there's nothing to support Treadway's fantasy world of harmony in the bloody Alaskan wilderness.

GRIZZLY MAN is a fascinating story but I have to agree with the reviews which compare the interviews with BEST IN SHOW or A MIGHTY WIND.

(If you were fascinated by this story, check out the book INTO THE WILD, about another young man who disappeared and died in the Alaskan bush in an attempt to live off the land.  GORILLAS IN THE MIST is both a book and a movie about Diane Fossey, another controversial person who fought on behalf of endangered animals).",1140912000,109,1383,4.658436213991769

Timothy Treadwell seems to be manic, it's really the only was to explain his actions, that and he at first seems to have a death wish, then it like morphs into a serious mesiah complex, it's hard to watch him deteriorate, you want to look away.  Director Herzog, interjects himself into the film and he becomes a character as well, and I was not sure about it at first, but when he listens to the audio of Treadwells death, you could tell that he was truly shaken and deeply moved by what he heard and his decision not to air it, reinforces this.  The interview with Treadwell's parents was heartbreaking, watching his mom clutch his childhood bear that he had with him up until the end, shakes you to the core.  This is a unique documentary, since the subject is actually a sort of co-documentarian...this is really well done, he must have been shocked that one of his beloved Grizzlies would turn on him, that must have felt like the ultimate betrayal.",1140912000,6,1019,4.582417582417582

In his desire to protect the bears he loved, he showed a complete lack of respect for them or their environment.  His attempts at ""humanizing"" them, by giving them names and human emotions made me want to scream.  His life and death are certain proof of natural selection.  Werner Herzog has made a brilliant film, his editing, naration and use of Treadwells own videos were perfect.

For me, it's squarely with the bears.",1140825600,29,607,4.607476635514018
2427885,5,B000BMY2NS,"After reading some remarkable reviews of Grizzly Man and catching much of it on Discovery Channel, I was very interested in seeing the DVD. The film first appears to be a documentary about the misguided naturalist Timothy Treadwell who befriended grizzly bears in Alaska and was eaten alive in 2003 by one. As a local native points out, what Treadwell did was irresponsible in that he crossed the line that had been drawn 7,000 years ago between humans and grizzlies - that is to avoid one another and maintain a respect for the danger one another poses. Treadwell also claimed that he was protecting the bears but his death resulted in the doom of the bear that killed him. When Herzog samples the tape of Treadwell's last moments (along with his girlfriend's), Herzog advises one of Treadwell's surviving ex-girlfriends to destroy the tape and never view the coroner's photographic evidence - just the coroner's descriptions are enough to chill one to the bone.

The director, Werner Herzog demonstrates again what a master filmmaker he truly is. Herzog also created the film that Treadwell never made by editing hundreds of hours of footage into a film that tells the story Treadwell would have himself made. But Herzog does not allow the audience to be seduced into the sentimentalism that caused Treadwell's death - Herzog indeed interrupts Treadwell's narration and explicitly disagrees with the notion that animals and humans can live in a harmonious relationship and indeed shows the fact that the worlds of humans and bears are separate and there is little room for the intersection of the two.

The extended on the DVD is even more remarkable as Herzog demonstrates his depth of understanding as the soundtrack is scored. One of the engineers asks whether he wants the music as background music and Herzog declares that he never has background music in his films. Herzog coaxes out a sound quality that Treadwell would certainly have been proud of - a haunting and poignant score. Yet again, Herzog won't allow us to be lulled into fantasy - when Treadwell is seen wading into a river with a large grizzly Herzog tells his cellist that he wants a strange sound - it is really a perverse sound that shows the perversity of a man reaching out to pet a grizzly bear. And in other scenes, such as one where two grizzlies are fighting - or one where a cub dismembered by an adult bear the music takes on an atonal quality. Indeed we see a pianist applying sheet metal screws and paperclips to his piano strings to produce a sound that reveals that nature is not 'harmonious'.

By the end of the film Treadwell can be seen as both a passionate man and one who is deeply troubled and a victim of his own imagination. Herzog allows us to feel sympathy and pathos for this tragic figure - a man who knew the fate that awaited him but couldn't resist.",1140825600,40,2851,4.720883534136546
2427886,3,B000BMY2NS,"I watched this on the Discovery Channel.  When it was over, I felt guilty about how I felt about this guy.  After reading other reviews, my feeling were justified.  Treadwell had serious mental problems.  He cries over dead bees and salivates over bear poop. I was expecting a nice sentemental documentary about a man who met a tragic end protecting the animals he loved, instead got a movie about a lunatic's ranting and ravings.  Out of thirteen summers he spent with the bears, he didn't seem to know anything about them.  He just gives them cute names.  He tapered with their surrounds by changing the flow of a river so the bears can get salmon. It's never seen as to how he protected the bears.  There is no footage of that.  The bears were in a national park.  He would hide in the bushes when he saw people like Jason stalking teenagers.

The special that followed Diary of Grizzly Man was kind of frustrating.  His friends talk up his praises. One tends to wonder then why didn't they see that he need some psychiatric help.  Also, The special gives some additional about his girlfriend, who was killed with him.  She was intending to leave him and that makes here death even more tragic.",1140825600,4,1197,4.55868544600939
2427887,1,B000BMY2NS,"With over 100 hours of film footage, you think they could have made a fairly interesting movie with this admittedly quirky guy.

However, America's fascination with death takes over in the beginning and we get views that say he Treadwell was ""mentally retarded"", interview a distraught girlfriend, the coroner.  This does not make for very pleasant or even interesting viewing, and is the type of thing one might choose NOT to watch.

The real message is that a man chose to live his life in a way that would chill most of us - but he did so with full cognizance of the risks and rewards and proceeded anyway, content in his choice.

The narrator, who sounds suspiciously like Arnold Schwarzennegger (though of course it's Werner Herzog, once you think this, it's distracting), pays both Timothy and the movie a disservice as his commentary becomes increasingly opinionated, and further distracting.

Werner, by the way, is all over the place in his commentary - like he can't reconcile his views of the man, his life, or even his own film, the documentary itself.  It seems like a rough draft.

All of the intimately personal moments Treadwell records - well, I don't mind them so much, I think everyone ought to do that sort of thing - express oneself, let it all out, do some soul-searching.  But then that should be it - I'm just saying that sort of material just doesn't make for the best story and ultimately detracts from the documentary.  A little bit - fine - give us the flavor of the man.  But just a little.  It's just not particularly entertaining.

If you want to honor a man's life, why not show more of the footage of the bears, the foxes, the gorgeous landscape - the very things Treadwell describes as compelling him to this landscape, these risks, this way of life.  This is what would make him happy - to have his message conveyed.  Isn't the flick ""in honor of""?

I'm not necessarily for the message by the way - Treadwell might have been doing more of a personal journey than anything for the bears.  The point was made in the film that getting bears used to people might be a bad thing - particularly for the bears, when not all people who might travel the wilderness want to cuddle, and some might be, well, armed.

But why else make a movie about the subject!  You have to make the subject compelling and possibly even take a tack that honors their purpose, a favorable eye.  But even if it's a critical eye, Werner can't decide.

I think the filmmakers simply found themselves with a lot of footage, a lot of content.  The commentary seems to be sidelong and undecided, even talking out of one-side of their mouths about the subject at any given moment.  Directionless.

Werner talks about dispassionate nature and how he views the world as murderous.  And then produces the footage to make Treadwell out to be a loon instead of focusing on a film an audience would appreciate watching - the core message of Treadwell's unusual existence.  Whether you agree or not, or want to sleep with bears, the man spoke of Love.

I would have been more pleased if they had tried to write a story that expressed more of what this man was all about, his care of nature, the bridge of nature he had obviously crossed as so few have and, by his own testimony, successfully.  He did what he wanted to do, which is more than many.

What footage they do show is both touching and satisfying, with glimpses of nature seldom seen.  Really a neat approach to one man's life, with an intimate portrait of bears of foxes and man's relaionship to them.

If they felt they needed to temper it, because of the precautionary fear that viewers will suddenly pack up and drive to the Alaskan wilderness and expose themselves to grizzlies, then a little sobering reality about his own death was fine, enough to make me stay away.  But not such morbid fascination, lurid in its detail; instead a greater telling and, here's the bit, actually fits with the story.

Then everybody laments the death of the girl.  Of course it's a tragedy and I don't belittle it, and maybe she just went for an outing in Alaska.  But I am hesitant to believe that she didn't have a good idea of who Timothy was - he was so forcefully honest about his passion, or that she didn't know that she was in Alaska, one, with grizzlies, two.  Despite the loss, I think she was taking a calculated risk in a touchy situation and was at least somewhat aware of the dangers - even though she didn't have the deathwish/found purpose of Treadwell.  Doesn't make it less sad, but when done with consciousness there is choice.

In conclusion, I think this movie had some beautiful moments and rare footage.  I think it presented an odd lifestyle choice, and is thought-provoking because of it.  But I think in the end it ultimately fails to stand up as a film or documentary, and it would have been interesting to see the other film made - the one I think I wanted to see, or to just watch highlights of the incredible footage - the real testimony to the man's life.",1140739200,10,5027,4.537180910099889

I think those who do not have compassion for Mr. Treadwell are cold, freakin' morons.  The guy was a recovering alcoholic.  He clearly had mental health issues.  Significant ones.  But, his heart was not evil.  That was obvious in observing and listening to him in this film and elsewhere.  He was not a dirty rotten scoundrel; he was an emotionally unhealthy person who channeled a lot of effort into something he really thought was positive.  But the film reviews here shouldn't even be moralistic observations about Timothy.  They should be about the film itself and whether it was well-done.  In fact, it was excellent.  Very well-constructed and coherent.  Fairly objective (though no documentary can purport to be perfectly so).  If you love the study of nature, including the study of man, it's seriously good stuff.

As a paramedic, I see many instances of people paying the price for doing something foolish, but his overconfidence and brazen foolhardiness amazed me. He actually convinced himself that these bears were his ""friends"" and would never harm him. Not only did he suffer the consequenses of his delusions, he also caused the person who loved him most her life. The US park service is at fault in this tragedy as well for allowing Treadwell to take these stupid chances and not making him leave. They didn't enforce their own rules.

2427910,5,B000BMY2NS,"Simply, this movie isn't about bears.

It's not about a man ""getting what he deserved,"" meddling with nature, or violating the law.  This movie is barely about the main character, Tim Treadwell; his psychosis, his inability to grasp what many of us take for granted (especially the danger inherent in nature), are largely window dressing disguising the fundamental issues raised by the film.

So many reviewers tuned into this movie expecting a nature documentary, and when they got a two-hour analysis on a desperate man, and a subtle commentary on how far modern man will go to find meaning, they tuned out.  ""He's crazy, a lunatic,"" they write, as though this wasn't obvious to all from the very first shot of Treadwell.  These same reviewers likely think ""Hoop Dreams"" was about college basketball recruiting and ""March of the Penguins"" truly about birds in Antarctica.  I can't argue with the other reviewers; it's like throwing a ball against a wall.

This movie is about modern man, and about his search for meaning.  Treadwell, a failed actor and recovering alcoholic, had nothing to live for before he found the bears in the Alaskan wilderness.  He found meaning in the animals; found meaning in his life.  It was misguided and shortsighted, sure.  But like Jon Krakauer's ""Into the Wild,"" Treadwell's desperate need to find something, anything in his life that had meaning fascinates those of us who stare out of glass towers from 9 to 5 wondering what all this is about, anyway.  Treadwell couldn't find anything of substance in his life until he found these simple creatures in this simple land.  What he found was more than most of us will ever find.

The movie's a scathing indictment of the modern world, where most people think ""meaning"" is something downloadable onto an iPod, and a movie about a man living among bears is really about a man living among bears, and not about a man trying to live.
It's a wonderful movie, as complex and rich as any I've ever seen.  I'm haunted by it, really.

Tim Treadwell gets eaten by a bear.  This is five minutes of the movie.  The remaining 115 minutes is dedicated to showing us how alienated a completely normal man can become in this steel world of ours--where organized religion has become irrelevant and outright quaint, where TV is savior of all--and the lengths some of us will go to to find meaning.

It's a wonderful journey.",1140652800,32,2391,4.787804878048781

As soon as I received my copy I popped it in the DVD player.  I was in awe of the scenery and footage that is photographed.  It was really beautiful.  However, learning more and more about Treadwell...I realized that he was completely confused.  The director/narrator tries to depict Treadwell as a hero of sorts, but the facts and stories of him tell a different story.  He was a man with a personality disorder...it seems that he could never find himself.  This can also be shown by the MANY outtakes of him filming himself to make sure he looks just right...he's in the wilderness for goodness sakes!  Who cares!  He finally found a passion for life while living with the bears out in the wild.  He was very avid in bringing to focus the problems that the bears face with the National Park Service and the Federal Government.  Treadwell was also made many contributions to children in schools to help them learn about the bears and how they interact.  While Treadwell believes ""...he was the only one to protect the animals"" is completely preposterous!  Not only did living with the grizzlies hurt him in the long run...it will the bears too.  Bears and humans do not co-exist.  These bears are going to become more comfortable with people now and that should not be!  I feel that while giving insight to children and others about the bears and their survival...he eventually brought an end to them.  All in all the documentary is average.  The best thing in the movie is the footage that Treadwell gets while in the wild.  It is really like no other I've ever seen.  I was a little disappointed after watching the movie though.  I wanted to see a documentary about grizzly bears and how they live and interact, but this movie is mainly about Treadwell and his sad life.

2427913,5,B000BMY2NS,"Like others who have come across this on Discovery I found this documentary interesting and disturbing.  I was and still not interested who this character Treadwell is, but I am interested in what an idiot he was.  Wow, top notch idiot.  This is a must see for all parents and people who think drugs are not bad.  As clearly stated by Treadwells own friend, Timothy was a drug addict at one time, an alcoholic, and on top of that Bi-Polar.  He actually removed himself from his own meds because ""he needed his ups and downs"".

With that we take off for the wilderness and to protect the brown bear.  As stated by government officials those bears are in no danger of population decrease, yet Timothy decided they needed protection.  A lot of good he did.  The only scene I remember involving poachers (which looked more like fisherman on a canoe), Timothy stayed hidden in the bushes filming.  Even when they started throwing rocks at one bear (not cool by any means and they should have been reported to the park) but he stays in the bushes.  So we never see the danger the bears were supposedly in.  We also learn that poaching was nearly non-existent while Treadwell was there, great, but it starts up right after he dies.  One possible explanation is that his story actually attracted more people to the location.

Is the film good looking?  Yes, some really great wildlife scenes which in my opinion should have been the direction of Timothy's task.  Unfortunately they are interupted by Timothy's psychotic rants which in some cases you will see were shot several times to get his message across.  Yes, he actually will do several takes on his rants against the government.  My personal favorite moment of clarity in this film is when he is in his tent during late summer.  He is pissed that the river levels are so low and the salmon won't make there run.  He screams at God, I mean screams at God, because Butterball (or whatever name he gave a bear that day) won't be able to eat.  Is it sad?  Yes, but that has been part of nature for millions of years.  The weak will not survive and the strong will carry on.  This jackass even tries to move rocks on the river to allow more water through.  What he does not take into account is that moving those rocks might mess with the migration of the salmon.  Perhaps those rocks keep the water speeds down a little so they can get in the river, instead they might have something more like a waterfall to climb.

My favorite part is the laws he broke.  By law I believe you are not allowed to be within 100 yards of Grizzlies.  Obviously things happen that does not allow that, but you make every effort to get to that distance, he doesn't do this.  #2 according to that park you have to change your camping site every week to a location no nearer than 1 mile from the old.  He fails that one too.  Not sure if this is a law or a guideline but when camping in these areas you are supposed to camp in the open fields (the bears will know they are there and will usually avoid them), Timothy camps in camo in bushes, within patches of woods.  0 for 3, great job.

What I don't like besides this guys general outlook and insane ranting is that he drags Amie along with him on the last trip.  Perhaps her fault that she came but it was noted in her diary how frightened she was of the bears and was thinking of leaving Timothy on the trip.  Unfortunately, there was no place to go.  He was so detached from humanity.

You will see in the documentary that while Timothy and Amie were attacked and killed, he actually had the time to turn the camera on and record it (I would think run, fight, or crap myself before I would think to film but whatever), but he never got the cap off the camera.  So the only thing recorded was the sound, but they won't play it on TV.  The wacked narrator (after listening to the tape) advises his ex-girlfriend/co-founder of their organization is that she should destroy it.  Hopefully someone made a copy.

Some will say this is a story of a man finding his own happiness and human spirit.  And maybe we should all take a look at ourselves in the world we created.  You know maybe we should take a good look at what we have created and who we are but the bottom line is this guy was off his rocker.  I take more from Jane Goodall for her mission, and from others that push themselves for thankless lives but do what they do because it makes the world better.  Treadwell did nothing for the bears except put them in danger of humans.  He put himself in danger which as a result killed one of the bears, and his friend Amie.  As humans are only tasks with the wild places of our world should be that of passion to preserve them, to stay out and not be a part of the complex habitat, and to respect the animals.  Treadwell in my mind does not display any of this, how could he, he thought he was a bear.  I don't understand how anyone can support this guy, I mean I know we want to believe in his mission but he makes it impossible to trust him.  Between the rants, the wardrobe changes, left hooking a bear in the head, endangering himself, amie, and the bears, how can you believe this guy?

2427915,1,B000BMY2NS,"I've started this review three times now, and can't quite come at it the right way...rather like the director of this ""tragic"" mess.  Werner Herzog seems to have no idea who he was making a film about, even with all that footage at his disposal (footage that Treadwell himself would surely have died before allowing anyone to see....pun intended).  It was all so patently self-serving, you'd think our director would have smelled a rat and backed off before he began.  But no, he presents us with a Treadwell he considers a tragic hero, a man unique in his fight to preserve the Grizzly: alone, heroic, exceptional.  While all the time Treadwell himself is telling us rather clearly exactly who he is. Or was.  He was a man desperate for attention.  A child-man really, not very bright or insightful, who'd made the usual pilgrammage to Hollywood in search of, I guess, validation.  He certainly didn't go because he was talented.  With no talent, Hollywood was a wash.  So he wandered off to find what he needed elsewhere.  How he happened on bears, the film does not make clear.  Because they are masters of their environment and Treadwell was very much not a master of anything?  Because he thought they were animated Teddy bears?  In any case, Treadwell found the bears.  He had no business being anywhere near the world of grizzly bears, and no understanding of them.  He did them no service I could see.  But he did himself a world of good by creating himself as their ""protector.""  The real tragedy of this pathetic story was the poor ignored girl who spent her last moments on earth trying to save an idiot from his own idiocy.  She could have run, but she didn't.  She banged away on a grizzly bear with a skillet until he'd finished with Treadwell, and then turned on her.  Does the director do her the honor of giving us a moment with her, other than usng her to show us another of Treadwell's lamentable traits...pretending he was a ""lone hero."" The hero here was the girl.  Werner Herzog was a patsy.  And Treadwell a sad little deluded manchild.  The bears, on the other hand, showed remarkable patience.  It took them 13 years to eat him.

2427916,5,B000BMY2NS,"Before I saw Werner Herzog's documentary, I couldn't understand why the commentary on Timothy Treadwell's grizzly bear project was so negative.  After all, he put himself in danger to protect and photograph these creatures whom he obviously loved to obsession.  Others will certainly have different reactions, but the film certainly changed my mind about Treadwell. Unfortunately, he comes across, at least as I saw him, as immature, paranoid, self-centered (his girlfriend Amie hardly even figures in his many hours of filming), somewhat psychotic and lacking even the basics of any scientific standards for research.  As the movie progresses, skillful editing brings out what I believe to be Herzog's justifiably critical attitude.  Treadwell's rants against the Park Service, non-existent poachers (the grizzlys actually have to be ""trimmed"" down each year), a large ""enemies"" list, and worst of all, at least aesthically, his romantic sentimentalization of the bears, and giving them cutsey names, reveals an advanced case of severe anthropomorphism.  Herzog lets Treadwell indict himself on all these counts, which he does only too well.  The project ended in two tragic human deaths, as well as two bears who also had to be shot.  However, the film is not structured as simply an indictment of Treadwell, as vestiges of Herzog's admiration for the man do come through now and again.  I think the merits of the film rest largely on this openness and reluctance to simply condemn Treadwell, as well as the well-justified reluctance of Herzog to sensationalize the story (for instance by not playing the tape recording of the mauling of Treadwell and his girlfriend). The film can lead reasonable people to many different interpretations of Treadwell's behavior, some very different than mine, and I think this nuanced ambiguity and refusal to make snap judgments is at the heart of why I think this is a very important film.",1140566400,141,1928,5.237012987012987
2427917,5,B000BMY2NS,"Having just seen Grizzly Man I am left deeply moved and challenged as a human being. Indeed I feel compelled to share something of my impressions with others. As a philosopher and a psychologist I found this film unique and extraordinary. I cannot think of another recent film that has left me with so many valuable questions...

As the reader no doubt knows, this film documents the life of one man in the Alaskan wilderness. Although the circumstances of his death were violent and certainly tragic for those left behind, I do not believe his death was pointless. Most of us like to forget that we have to face death sometime. The one vitally important question this movie (and Timothy Treadwell) has left me with is this : Am I prepared to live and give everything for something I really believe in? Am I prepared to live for what I love?

But there are many other vital questions that this movie has asked of me. Would I find the extraordinary courage of his girlfriend to stay by someone I loved, if they were attacked (by a grizzly!)? Have I ever loved someone that much that I would give my life trying to save them, rather than abandon them in their last moments, even as they called upon me to save myself? Does that extraordinary, selfless love and courage exist within many of us otherwise ordinary human beings?

I can only hope so.

These questions lead to another deep level of fascination with this movie - the nature of Timothy himself. As the film goes on we discover that Timothy is not just playing his (consciously imagined) role as `protector of the gentle grizzlys', he is also a rich and (perfectly) flawed human being. I cannot help but admire his courage to show the camera (and the viewers) so many of his innermost hopes, dreams, feelings, conflicts and doubts. I feel especially privileged to have been part of it, because it seems that sort of intimate connection was something that he struggled to share with real people in his life.

I saw a person struggling to reconcile the different parts of his own nature, in the end giving a great gift of insight (as narrator Werner Herzog suggested) into human nature itself. I saw a deeply caring child within this man, but there was also an anger and rage within that sometimes exploded in front of the camera. It seemed that all the qualities of the conscious caring child within, Timothy projected onto the natural world around him. He struggled to accept and reconcile that nature could be cruel and unfeeling, just as he struggled to accept and explore the meaning of his own unconscious rage. It seemed to me that in trying to protect the Alaskan Grizzlys, he was also subconsciously trying to protect the innocent child within himself from all sorts of threats, some perhaps real and others quite probably his own projection.

Ultimately he paid for his intent to preserve his idea of nature with his life, yet even that  price was one he was clearly prepared to pay. I found much rich food for thought in this documentary of this man's life. He left me with great insight into the human condition. And the example of his girlfriend's courage was something that will stay with me forever.",1140566400,7,3169,4.648214285714285
2427918,5,B000BMY2NS,"No matter how you feel about Timothy Treadwell, this documentary of his life is insightful. I had a better understanding of who he was and his passion for nature. However, in my opinion, Timothy might've accomplished more if he'd spent time with Native Americans and learned how they bond with nature without being intrusive.

Though his heart was in the right place, Treadwell clearly made mistakes. He had a true love of animals, so I do feel deeply for his loss. I recall a kind man in Florida who loved gators and fed a young one daily. It soon grew huge and came into yards to eat family pets. It was just a matter of time before it ate a toddler, etc. and was hunted down. In many cases, we forget that wild animals are far safer if they remain afraid of humans. This movie weighs both sides of that issue without heavily blaming Treadwell for the tragedy that ended him and his girlfriend's life.",1140307200,5,903,4.472727272727273

2427921,4,B000BMY2NS,"If I had to sum up this documentary I would say it was SURREAL.  There was this subtle level of bizarre behavior not just on Treadwell's part but on the other people in the movie.  There is a scene where they talk to a coroner and his words and is facial expressions are just plain strange.  There are others too: the ex-girlfriend who met him by setting fire to a soup cart, the bush pilot, the museum curator, Treadwell feeling threatened by the picture of a smily face, his father talking about how Timothy was destroyed because he did not get to play Woody on Cheers, his beachbum friend talking about how incredible Treadwell's hair was because you neversaw his forehead, how he pretended to be an orphan from  Austrailia to his friends, all the crying over the animals... foxes, bears eating other bears, the not-so-dead bumblebees, the warm ""poop"" episode...

Treadwell cannot seem to get it through his head that killing is part of nature and he just cries over these things...

What is puzzling is that Treadwell keeps telling us how he is the sole protector of the bears yet there was not one video shot of him protecting anything.  At one time there were some guys in a boat and they threw a rock at a bear so it would stay away. For the most part it was just humans taking pictures.

Treadwell also seems to interfere with nature... like trying to set up a spawning run for the trout so the bears get something to eat.  The museum curator is a native and he give an interesting assessment: ""Treadwell did more harm than good"".

It is quite apparent that Treadwell sees himself as one of the bears, and the bears see him as hamburger.  I am no psychiatrist but it is apparent that Treadwell has some serious mental problems... sometimes it is humorous but often it is sad.

What is amazing is that the bears did not kill him earlier.",1140134400,13,1844,4.4880239520958085
2427922,3,B000BMY2NS,"One thinks, first of all, of Winged Migration, and the sheer reverence with which its subject was treated...or of the equally powerful March of the Penguins, which was both riveting and evocative.  One thinks of Marlon Perkins, the authoritative voice of Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom; one's mind even briefly jumps to the Discovery Channel's various Animal Planet shows and the silliness that reigns there.  But Grizzly Man, sadly, is none of these.  In spite of Werner Herzog's editing and his loving, careful narration, in spite of the utterly inspired scoring by Richard Thompson, the inescapable conclusion is that this film is a breathtaking presentation of incredible footage that has unfortunately been wrapped around a lunatic's home movies.

On the surface Grizzly Man is a documentary, a record of the life and the death of Timothy Treadwell, self-proclaimed ""protector"" of the wild bears of the Alaskan peninsula.  Somehow, Treadwell managed to spend thirteen summers with these Alaskan grizzlies without being either seriously mauled or eaten.  Somehow, in spite of breaking every rule even small children are taught about cute looking, but nonetheless dangerous wild animals, Treadwell went unscathed.  Somehow, he talked a woman, Amie Huguenard, to accompany him on his last two month foray into the wilds; and somehow their luck ran out when a rouge bear attacked and killed them both.  On the surface this seems to be a compelling story, but the claim to documentation quickly breaks down when it is revealed that it is not documentarian Herzog's footage we are seeing, but rather Treadwell's self-indulgent, quiet often juvenile, largely self-made movies.  In short order the notion of this story being at all compelling also fades, as Treadwell's delusions and psychotic behavior rapidly obscure the beauty of what he is allegedly trying to protect.

From the hundred or more hours of film that Treadwell left behind, Herzog fashions a story of sorts.  It is clear from his narration that Herzog developed an emotional bond with his subject; and more than once he surrenders all objectivity completely. Yet he is also honest enough to present, at the film's beginning at least, the unvarnished opinions of several who knew Treadwell either personally or by reputation.  The opinions are not complimentary.  To those whose business is the Alaskan wilds and the animals that inhabit it, Treadwell was a cross between a dilettante and a nut case, dangerously out of touch with reality, a danger to himself and, ironically, a danger to the animals he claimed to protect.  These pointed opinions, however, are not only more than balanced by loving paeans to Treadwell's heart, soul, spirituality and ""mission,"" but by the movie's end they replace any objectivity completely.  Worse still, one of the central testimonials is offered by a woman who seems only slightly more tightly wrapped than Treadwell himself was.

But beyond this, it is simply too much for all but the most saccharine of environmentally conscious viewers to take Treadwell seriously.  His moods swing from the serious to the childish, from the petty to the pompous.  He rants, raves, curses and swears at enemies unseen.  He talks of people who want to hurt him and, when tourists attracted to the very notoriety he himself has created leave a greeting and a smiley face on a rock near his campsite, he murmurs knowingly of dark conspiracies.  He wants his audience to share his reverence, but then spoils it all by worshiping at a steaming pile of bear dung.  Again, it is all too much.

More disturbing, however, is the sense one develops of Treadwell's essential dishonesty.  He speaks of being alone, totally and irredeemably alone, when in fact the camera is being held by Huguenard.  More damning, he brought her along but completely ignores her in his narration. He talks repeatedly of the difficulty of the ""work,"" but in fact no real work is ever anywhere to be seen.  He yammers incessantly of protecting the bears, but there is not a scintilla of evidence that he has ever done anything of the sort.  The closest we ever see him coming to ANYTHING that might (with a generous stretch) be seen as actively protecting the area's wildlife is a scene when in a puppet-like squeaky voice he pleads for an end to fox hunting and trapping.  As for the bears, they never seem endangered or threatened in any way, except for when their familiarity with Treadwell prompts at least one to approach some tourists who nervously toss rocks to shoo the animals, while Treadwell spies from behind a bush and makes nasty noises at the interlopers.  This sense of Treadwell's dishonesty not only removes any last shreds of sympathy he and his quixotic cause might still enjoy, but is ultimately substantiated by the revelation that Treadwell fabricated an entire phony backstory to impress his friends back in the civilized world.  In the end, with all his cursing, self-rightousness and references to sinister forces, it is no more possible to take Treadwell seriously than it was The Blair Witch Project.

The truly sad thing is that, when he wasn't mugging or preening for the camera, Treadwell did manage to capture rare and spectacular footage of the bears in their natural habitat.  Had Herzog focused exclusively upon this, and left all references to Treadwell merely to the narration, he might have had a product that equaled Winged Migration or March of the Penguins.  Unfortunately, however, that was not his choice.  The result is a sad story of a disturbed and misguided man's self-induced death; and worse, his culpability in the death of a woman whose tragic fatal mistake was following him into his delusional but deadly wilderness.",1140048000,7,5725,5.03711558854719
2427923,4,B000BMY2NS,"I liked this film, but not because I felt Treadwell was a great guy doing a great thing.  The guy was insane.  He was delusional for believing his presence there was somehow protecting the bears.  When some fishermen threw rocks at a bear he just hid behind a bush.  What a great help he was.  But this movie stayed with me for a few days, and I felt compelled to tell friends and family all about it in the days after I watched it.  It is odd how the coroner seems to be putting on a show when he describes receiving the bodies (what was left of them) of Treadwell and his girlfriend.  And I found myself really liking Treadwell's ex-girlfriend, and the way she described how they met.  But I feel I was liking a character and not a real person.  Too many people in this film seem like odd-ball characters.  But the views of the Alaskan wilderness are breathtaking.  I really enjoyed watching the foxes.  I left this movie hating Timothy Treadwell, the way he brought his girlfriend there, the way he staged it to look like he was alone when he wasn't, the way he was invading the bears' space, and his utter immaturity.  I think a lot of people who wrote bad reviews are reviewing Treadwell as a person.  But even though I hate him and I'm not at all saddened by what happened to him (even he expected it, and I think he wanted it), I enjoyed this movie and how it left me respecting the wilderness and disrespecting imbeciles like him.",1139875200,5,1438,4.337078651685394
2427924,5,B000BMY2NS,"Checking out a chat room recently someone suggested that Treadwell had the classic symptoms of Bipolar Disorder (also known as Manic Depression). The person making the comment was a Psychiatric Nurse with many years experience. I work in the same field myself and can tell you that Treadwell, with his erratic mood swings DOES seem to fit the bill. Together with his background as a talented but thwarted diver and aspiring, failed actor, it may also explain the underpinnings of his unhealthy obsession with bears.

IMO Treadwell simply channeled his frustrations into nature, having spent his earlier years trying to do something he was good at, and being siderailed, he finally found something he could claim as his own, something he could use to make a name for himself. I don't think his love of nature had as much to do with it as a purely egotistical need to shine at whatever he was doing. Parts of the movie displays this thinking with Treadwell commenting that ""only he"" was trying to 'save' the bears. In fact he uses those words, or some derivative thereof, several times throughout the movie, giving me the feeling that this guy also suffered from delusions of granduer. This sense of granduer can be be seen when Treadwell encounters dead animals in the wild. His reactions to say the least are disturbing as they show a man who lived in a make-believe world where animals get along and don't eat each other. But Treadwell's fictionalized account of nature was probably his undoing as he saw bears as creatures who could do no wrong, including attacking people.

Near the end of the film Treadwell shows his contempt of the Park Service by telling them in one of his homemade movies to go ""f*ck off"". This to me was the most revealing and disturbing part of the movie since it shows just how far Treadwells angry paranoia went. He now sees the Park Rangers, men who had his best interest at heart, as the enemy. As he rants and raves for the camera it's unsettling to see just how delusional Treadwell was.

Herzog did a great job in giving an even-handed account of Treadwell's story, neither lionizing nor demonizing him. He doesn't make him into a martyr either. What he does is show the many sides - good and bad - of a flawed man. Thank you Mr. Herzog!",1139875200,11,2271,4.658354114713217

He felt he was their only protector. He demonstrates this, that when a group of tourists come by boat and throw rocks at the bears he hides in the bushes crying. Giving them names like Mr. Brownie Pants really shows how ""off"" this guy was mentally.  My favorite part of the movie is how he talks about how he's not gay. If this guy wasn't gay he was in deep deep denial. The excellent part of this movie is how he fawns over a fresh pile of bear poop.

The entire movie is filled with the pretentious voice-over of Mr. Herzog--where he selfishly promotes his tiresome opinions about hunters and the universe. Where he believes his ideas to be profound, he falls miserably short.

What could be a chilling climax to the documentary, an audio tape that recorded Timothy Treadewell's brutal demise, is instead diminished to a boring few minutes of film. What the director does give us instead is footage of someone watching Herzog listen to the audio on headphones. Herzog selfishly keeps this audio to himself and then, once again, inserts his uncalled for opinion that the owner of the audio tape should have it destroyed.

Sam Egli(the aircraft pilot who assisted in the cleanup of the dead remains of Treadwell and his girlfriend)said everything in a nutshell about Treadwell. If there is one interview you watch during the whole film please watch his. His statements about Treadwell are on-point and he doesn't sugarcoat things like the others. Timmy Treadwell was a troubled individual on a suicide mission plain and simple. Treadwell knew the dangers of what he was doing, but didn't listen to his own advice. He stated these dangers repeatedly throughout the film. He went into the Alaskan wilderness to get away from the problems he had in the real world. I'm surprised he lasted as long as he did. The only rational people in the whole film were Sam Egli and the native doctor. His ex-girlfriend Jewell Palavok, mom and dad, and close friends were all loony. Instead of them getting him the medical attention he needed they upheld him in his deteriorating mental state. He states in the film that he ""loved"" and ""protected"" the animals but was actually doing more harm by habituating the animals to humans. This film was surprisingly hilarious such as the coroner who was campy and over-the-top, the close friends interviews which seemed staged,and Treadwell's tirades-the drought, against the government, and the fox who stole his hat. The most touching parts of the film were Treadwell's connections with the foxes. He really didn't seem to connect with the bears at all. Whenever he came in contact with them they seemed annoyed with him.

The guy didn't really study the bears (he was no scientist) but instead tried to live with and make friends with them. In his romantic delusional view he was their older brother, who was there for them.

2427964,5,B000BMY2NS,"Like other reviewers, I found myself wishing Timothy Treadwell could have gotten help for his obvious mental illness. But by limiting his contact to equally out-of-touch people he put himself on the slippery slope to his own horrifying end.

Yes, the man filmed spectacular footage of the

Grizzly Bears, but his documentation was interspersed with a disturbing self-portrait of an sick, egomaniacal, anthropromorphic person who never grasped the reality of what he was dealing with. The bears didn't ""love"" him as he believed they did. They merely tolerated him as he played his daily game of Wilderness Russian Roulette.

Throughout the film, he by turns reveres and rages at nature. He professes to love nature, while at the same time seeking to interfere with the natural process. He ""adopts"" a young red fox, acclimating it to people in a way that can only bode ill for an animal that should have a healthy distrust for humans. At one point, Treadwell tries to help the bears by constructing a ""path"" for the salmon during a drought and then railing at the bears for eating their own young when the fish don't follow it downstream as he had hoped. In another eerie moment, he brushes a fly from the face of a dead fox, admonishing the insect to ""show some respect."" Here is a man who claimed superior knowledge of the wild yet failed to understand that a fly has no motive beyond following its instinct.

Treadwell's story is one of unrequited love, and one has to wonder whether in his last, horrifying moments he felt betrayal at being killed by the very animals he fancied to be under his protection.

It was a sobering conclusion, but those who say Treadwell didn't leave a legacy are wrong. His misguided attempts to be one with nature should serve as a lesson that - while animals should be appreciated - they should be respected for what makes them different from humans. People who seek to bond with nature in such an unnatural way not only risk their own lives, but the lives of the animals who don't understand that the next human crossing their path will more than likely mean them harm.

Treadwell's is a cautionary tale for anyone tempted to take their love of nature too far. But it is an unforgettable tale, and if you see ""Grizzly Man"" you will never quite be able to get the hauntingly disturbing train-wreck of one man's life - and death - out of your head.",1139356800,19,2380,4.654761904761905

What would drive a man like Treadwell who claimed to have no prior life of any significance to live out in the country with bears in order to protect them?  Throughout the film various questions are raised about all the elements of Treadwell's life that would drive him to live with the bears.  Slowly, the answers all fall into place.

I can't imagine any other director doing a better job then Werner Herzog on this in-depth film on Treadwell's life with bears.  He presented this film in a most sensitive way, searching for deep meaning in the life of Treadwell who overcame his alcoholism to find happiness and freedom caring for wild bears.

What I found most intriguing about this film was all the emotions and shifts in judgment I went through viewing it.  At one point I liked Treadwell, another moment I thought him an idiot in how he was obsessed with his hair, then another I thought him a bit psycho to put his life below that of the bears who he said he would die for. It went on and on with my going through all these unsusual contortions in my judgment.  In 2003, when I had heard Treadwell was mauled by a bear, I was very quick to pronounce judgment of his having an obvious death wish and that he was some kind of fool.

This film made me rethink my assessment of this man's life and efforts that left me believing we are perhaps too quick to make judgments of other people whom we really don't know of their life experiences.  Treadwell overcame alcoholism and chose his path in life and I believe he is worthy of respect.  His efforts were courageous.  He didn't end up a drug addict living on the streets, but found his passion in life and lived it out, knowing the risks involved.  Though some macho men are quick to laugh at Treadwell for being what they consider looney, after seeing this documentary, I see the depth of this man who is worthy of respect.  He easily could have been a criminal ending up in prison. He chose another path and I think he is a very honorable person, regardless that his life ended tragically under the the appearance of failure and humiliation.",1139270400,4,2176,4.423558897243108

He seems to have lived in his own reality, which unfortunately was clearly not the bears' reality.  Transitions from ranting and raving to weeping, to spying on people who had the nerve to visit what is after all a national park...Treadwell is all over the place and his actual message seems to be  simply ""Look at Me!  Look at me!"" I'm sorry for what happened to him, and even sorrier for Amie Huguenard, whose only mistake, I think, was trusting Treadwell.  The footage of the bears is excellent - shot by Treadwell - he was a talented photographer. Interviews with his friends and acquaintances too often are maudlin and overly worshipful.  On the whole, it's an interesting portrayal of a sad and seriously unstable young man and a sad, almost wraith-like woman.",1139270400,12,943,4.719512195121951

2427980,1,B000BMY2NS,"After two viewings I can still not decide whether Herzog meant for this film to be taken seriously. It has the look and feel of sketch comedy. I am not a discompassionate person, and I literally laughed my way through 2/3 of this thing. One of my favorite moments was the clip where Dave Letterman asked Treadwell if we'd be hearing reports of him being eaten by a bear, and then the audience erupted in laughter--COMIC GENIUS!

Treadwell was clearly insane! Not brave! Those bears didn't want or need him there! So what is the story if not the novelty and irony of this closeted, kooky wannabe hamming it up for the camera and then getting exactly what he was asking for.

If Grizzly Man is satire, then it's a masterpiece and Herzog is a genius. If it was intended as inspirational or tragic docu-fare, then it fell far short of its mark. The guy, the situation, the foolish-looking supporting players and the ultra-serious narration were all just laughable.",1139270400,17,960,4.674556213017752

Herzog and his backers saw an opportunity to make some money off some guys personal train wreck and to call this documentary entertainment, educational or even informative is nonsense, unless, of course, you like to see bears in the wild like I do, which explains the two stars. O.K. film except Treadwell kept getting in the way. Besides, humans cannot be good for a bears digestion, in fact, this poor bear died of lead poisoning. Sorry about Amy though.

2427983,4,B000BMY2NS,"With its inadvertent moments of comedy, it's tempting to describe this film as a Spinal Tap with bears until one remembers that there was a tragic and grisly ending for several characters. In addition to the main character preening in his Prince Valiant haircut during numerous takes, certain supporting players (particularly the coroner) act as if they are hamming it up for the camera.

Despite his friends' protestations over the way he is depicted in this film, one can safely assume Tim Treadwell was at the very least a little crazy. I find it hard to believe a sane person would live among and give nicknames like Cupcake and Mr. Chocolate to a group of animals who could and did eventually rip him apart. Still, the movie is a fascinating character study of how obsession, no matter how well intentioned, can destroy you. The irony is the bears that Treadwell claimed he was saving were already protected by park officials. Treadwell's zeal unwittingly led to the destruction of the animals he was trying to protect.

The film also highlights Treadwell's skills as a movie maker. Nature films tend to bore me and I don't find watching wild animals all that interesting but I have to concede that Treadwell captured some awesome moments with the bears, foxes and their surroundings.

Although we know how the story ends, director Werner Herzog manages to maintain the tension in the film. We know something bad is going to happen but we're not sure how he is going to show us how it unfolded. Herzog is to be commended for avoiding the easy route that too many filmmakers would have gone for by not broadcasting the audio of Treadwell and his girlfriend's final moments.

2428006,5,B000BMY2NS,"This documentary was breathtaking, to say the least. I originally watched it expecting a nature documentary of a man who went and studied the grizzlies. What I came to understand was that this movie is not a documentary of bears or of nature, but rather a documentary of bare humanity.

The film is not one to be watched while expecting to be convinced of any new philosophy on life or to be swayed by any opinions. To watch is as so would be to destroy what it is that makes the film beautiful. Timothy Treadwell is a man who was led into the wilderness by love and also by hatred, by peace and also by anger. The film must be watched with one expecting to observe humanity in its most truly emotional and vulnerable state.

Treadwell's claimed belief in the absolute harmony and order of nature is certainly not one that is logical, but he was also not insane. Treadwell was a man drove to the edge; he was an outcast of love and of life. As you will inevitably come to notice in the movie, he has a very ""unique"" personality - one that would immediately turn most people off. In every way, he exemplifies the misunderstood. With a need to feel purpose and a need to find something to live for, Timothy Treadwell threw himself at the mercy of the unforgiving wilderness and used it as a means to leave the society that he felt rejected in. The wilderness provided him with a means of escape, a means of rebellion, and a means of finding something to live for that did not possess the human ability to reject him. The film is a portrait of a man trying to change his darkness to something bright. The beauty that Treadwell found in the wilderness gave him something to love and gave him a reason to direct his inner rage towards society in a manner that felt selfless. As you will observe in the film, Treadwell expresses extreme hatred of the Alaskan government and of poachers and pretends as though this hatred solely arises because of his care for nature and its animals. However, the film also shows Treadwell becoming filled with rage whenever another person or group of persons is seen in the wilderness. Recreational visitors, campers, all of them were intruders on the land that Timothy wanted to believe was created solely for him. It didn't matter what anyone's purpose for being there was; to Timothy, that wilderness belonged to him, and his divine purpose of guarding it justified his hatred of the outside world. Timothy's enemy was not the Poachers or the Alaskan government; to Timothy, his true enemy was society and all of the people within it.

The film will not show you a man who is spiritually at ease, or a man who has reached a miraculous harmony with the world and with nature, or a man who is, by any means, an innocent one. Rather, the film will show you a broken man trying to find redemption in purpose.",1139184000,8,2834,4.499029126213593
2428007,4,B000BMY2NS,"No one can deny that Timothy Treadwell was unbalanced - or ""off-center,"" as one of his friends describes him in the film. Still Werner Herzog doesn't want to present him as a lunatic. Hence the film's interviews with people who knew Treadwell and liked him -- or at least supported his work on behalf of the bears.

Still, there's hardly any evidence in the film that Treadwell actually needed to protect grizzlies in Alaska's Katmai National Park. It wasn't until I saw the half-hour documentary (Diary of the Grizzly Man) shown on the Discovery Channnel after the movie that I saw any reason to believe that his presence at Katmai might have deterred poachers. This wasn't in the movie and its absence inevitably and maybe inadvertently tilts the scales even more against Teadwell - strengthening the impression that he was simply on a deranged ego trip. Nor is it mentioned in the film that Treadwell had a radio and could have gotten word about poachers out to the National Park Service.

Of course, you would think that serious poachers could simply have tried one of the other areas of this vast park

As for the bears, I have to agree with Herzog, who also narrates, that there's not much sign of a mutual ""connection"" with any of them, except perhaps for a pair of cubs who follow him in one scene. He loves the bears. They're mainly indifferent to him -- until the fatal attack that ended his life and his girlfriend's.

I used to hunt in Grizzly Bear country (The Kootenai Plains in Alberta, Canada) believe me, only a bona fide nut would choose to camp in wild bear country.

Three couples watched this film last night after we had made last minute Super Bowl preparations.  None in the room felt any compassion for Treadwell.  He got what he wanted, we should all be so lucky.

At points, the film was almost like watching an old SCTV sketch.  Here's a guy who read up on a small Outback town so that he could pass himself off as an intinerant Australian!!!

Do not watch this movie expecting it to be a documentary about bears, because it isnt! Its a docudrama about a man.

I missed the story about the bears because I was in awe that not only was he insane, but everyone interviewed seemed to be as well... other than the natives who've lived there forever, and the man who said that they let him live because they viewed him as retarded.

I am amazed that all of these people who loved him didn't think that something was wrong.  He is obviously confused about his sexuality, he is destroyed by not getting a part in Cheers so he turns to alcohol and drugs?  This should have been a warning sign.  In my opinion, he is obsessed with being a 'star' and he used these wild animals to promote himself.  I am not saying he was a millionaire, I am saying he craved attention and these bears tolerated him for 13 years before they killed him.

It was just a matter of time and anyone who believes differently is just blind.  This man set the stage to be nailed on a cross he created and if he truly cared about these animals he would have stayed in his human world and left them to survive as they have.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, he created awareness, and yes, they are beautiful animals but I believe his intentions to be more of a martyr than a wannabe bear.  He cut the wood, drove the nails, and did 15 takes as he hung himself on the cross.  He had a savior complex and interfered not only in these animals lives, but altered their surroundings and cried when they died.  Life isn't pretty in raw nature.  It is real, and chaotic, and death occurs.

This movie/story in my opinion of a great documentary on the most self-serving, psychotic man alive who not only risked his own life, (not that I believe him capable of really understanding what he was truly doing) but also risked the life of another human being and made sure he did an additional 15 takes wearing different colored bandanas.

Everyone has slapped a pretty name on it but it is nothing more than arrogance, ignorance, and pure ego run wild.  He was the wild animal, the bears were just being bears.  This is the most disgusting waste of money.  The bears were beautiful, and he was a visitor that was blessed to be there but just would never leave.

It is vile that we take lunatics and make them heros and saviors.  Let a real filmmaker and animal lover make these films...who know that to really observe the wild you must not disturb or interfere in the environment.

Let's not reward the wackos who want their 14 minutes of fame.  Who is profiting now off of his story is what I want to know? They are probably the people who 'loved' him who should have had him institutionalized and medicated.  He was a danger to himself, and others and a family of bears.  He interfered in their world and they just removed the problem... and he got a bear killed.  The bear wasn't angry, it was a bear and probably just hungry.

2428014,3,B000BMY2NS,"Tim's footage was absolutely incredible, and I would love to see his footage edited into a documentary with respect to Tim's aproach to his work.

The producers of this particular movie did a terrible job.  They chose to portray him as merely a crazy person.  The movie is stuffed with commentators who don't respect him.  They're entitled to their opinions, and viewers should be discouraged from approaching bears, but the commentary on Tim's personality was disrespectful.  If they just tastefully edited Tim's footage and kept their mouths' shut we'd certainly still get a sense of his eccentricity.

I think there's actually more camera time on useless commentators than Tim or the bears.  They even had a lengthy interview with the coroner who received Tim's remains.  It was boring and useless.  I watched the movie on a Discovery Channel broadcast and there was an entire segment between commercial breaks where there wasn't a single frame of Tim's footage.  Instead the producers decided on a lengthy interview with Tim's ex-girlfriend.  Another commentator was apt to compare this movie to a Christopher Guest film.

My friend later brought over the DVD.  Even it's special features were inappropriate.  They included an entire documentary about the musical scoring of the film!  It was boring and useless.  How about more bear footage?  How about the audio from his death, for those not of the faint of heart?  We're adults.

2428015,1,B000BMY2NS,"This film - essentially the ravings and lying and posing and incredible damaged ego of this poor lunatic - does no service to the naturalist's cause.  Treadwill is a crazy person trying to make himself into a mythical hero, and our narrator-director is there to help him.  Why, we must wonder, when he was away from the bears during 3/4 of the year, did he never study about them?  He understands nothing; he teaches nothing - except perhaps that sadly disturbed people often get less help than they need, and sometimes find very interesting ways of destroying themselves and others.

Almost every scene treats us to his mania and self-absorption, and we get precious few bits of great animal footage.

This is no documentary ... this a video diary of a man who was more concerned with what bandanna to wear in each of his ""takes"" than the safety and welfare of his companion, or the genuine welfare of the animals he kept swearing up and down that he loved and wanted to protect.

2428029,4,B000BMY2NS,"Released in 2005, this is a worthwhile documentary by Werner Herzog (director of the acclaimed films ""Agguire, the Wrath of God"" & ""Fitzcarraldo"") on ""grizzly man"" Timothy Treadwell, who actually LIVED with grizzlies for 13 summers in wilderness Alaska from 1991-2003, sometimes accompanied by his bear-phobic girlfriend. Treadwell comes off as a loon yet, at the same time, likable, unique, gifted and dynamic. It's a fascinating story with entertaining touches, like as the hamming-it-up coroner (but I suppose that's just the coroner's whacked-out personality; after all, he examines human remains for a living).

Treadwell documented his 13 summers with the grizzly bears on film and in journals. His journals have been made into a book by Ian Zonglobski. Each of the 13 chapters detail Treadwell's experiences with the bears, one chapter per each summer. The first 12 chapters reveal Treadwell's great love for the animals; to him the grizzlies are lovable cute & cuddly critters. The 13th chapter, however, horrifically details the tragic end of Timothy and his girlfriend as they end up half-eaten by a grizzly, apparently an older bear who was having a hard time finding enough to eat. This last chapter is fittingly titled ""I Guess They Weren't So Cuddly After All.""

Just joking, of course. Treadwell himself testifies that he's fully aware of the life-threatening danger of the bears, but he's learned how to live amongst them year after year. His secret is that you can't make yourself look weak, like a victim; you have to show yourself friendly, but strong. In any case, there's stunning footage of two grizzly males fighting for the rights to a female and it's worth the price of admission. There's also a lot of footage of foxes whom Treadwell befriends, like they're his pets.

One of the best parts of the documentary is Herzog's non-judgmental, but honest insights about Treadwell, which adds a layer of psychological depth. The filmmaker is clearly intrigued by his subject. He informs that he thinks it's a mistake for Timothy to sentimentalize the bears, but he shares his view in a respectful manner. Herzog clearly respects Treadwell for the living-on-the-edge boldness it takes to do what he he does. So there's no judgment to his commentary; he's just fascinated by Treadwell's amazing story, like we the viewer.

One curious part occurs when Treadwell shoots footage of visitors to the park, which shows one of them throwing a couple rocks at a grizzly. Timothy is clearly offended, but fails to do anything about it. As the ""protector"" of the bears, as he continuously claims, I expected him to at least approach the group and verbally castigate the man who threw the rocks, but he does nothing.

(In defense of the guy who threw the rocks, he possibly did so to sway the bear away from them, which is what rangers instruct visitors to do if a bear comes too close).

I'm just trying to figure out what he actually did that ""protected"" the bears? I suppose you could argue that he created public awareness through his videos and appearances, which might have indirectly helped the bears.

The film runs 144 minutes.

I was waiting to recognize one of Treadwell's friends as a character actor.  It didn't happen, but man, those people missed their true calling.  Don't get me wrong, I think his heart was in the right place, but his head was about 3 weeks behind on his medication.  While the illness itself is not a joke, his rantings were hilariously off-base. I'm considered liberal and even I wanted to smack this guy silly.  Even the narration sounded like a joke.  Like someone had punched Arnold Schwarzenegger repeatedly in the jaw with the handle of a shovel and then asked him to read out loud.

I'm sorry for what happened to Treadwell and his girlfriend, but I also think that's nature's way of culling the herd.

Tim's footage was very ""natural"" at times but instead of capturing the beauty of the animals he captured his fractured personality.  Mr. Treadwell could be very coherent and witty at times but more often than that he was belligerent and incoherent which I believe were his true colors.  He should serve as an example to those like him who believe saving animals' lives only comes through blind love and passive reckless actions. Obviously it is not, Park Rangers warned him, Bear Experts warned him but he chastised and cursed them during his many tirades on film.  When I first watched this documentary I thought it was a spoof like Spinal Tap or Waiting for Duffman, mostly because of the supporting characters (Friends and Family).  I realize everyday people when put in front of a camera ""over act"" or have a zombie like appearance but these people were so good at that I thought they had to be actors.  When the narrator/director listens to the last tape and says to the former girlfriend ""you must never listen to this""  or his father who blames Tim's downward spiral in life to his loosing the bartend spot on Cheers to Woody Harrelson was just hard to believe.

I believe if you like nature (Foxes and Bears) this is a sweet movie with a tragic end. If you want to get a good insight into the personalities that make up the environmental terrorist organizations of ELF and ALF then watch his behavior and ranting in this movie.

Had he been a scientist who minutely recorded bear behavior, diet, sleep patterns, and the content of bear droppings, we might have rewarded him with academic honors. Had he recorded the bear's capacity for friendship in many books we may have called him a great author.

Instead, Tim tells us how he loves bears. He is a mystic not a scientist. He is an explorer into the world of grizzley bears. He wants to become one, live as they do, love and be loved by them.

Many people who have reviewed his book and DVD have called Timothy foolish. Some have suggested that he should not have allowed bears to come so close, that he should have carried a gun, and that he should not have lived among them. Everyone mentions Timothy's drug habit as though that would prevent him from learning about or teaching us about bears. But explorers, like Timothy are not ordinary people. Ordinary people on a two week vacation take lots of bear pictures and then hang them in the office. Timothy and anyone who would live with bears or with gorillas in the mist are a bit crazy. They prefer not to live with us.

Famous explorers of the past were also nuts. Nineteen century explorer of the Middle East Richard Burton, had a huge drug habit and was a weird sexual experimenter, who disguised himself as an Arab and snuck into Mecca. Had he been discovered, it would have been his end. Alexandra David-Neel, the woman explorer of China and Tibet who reached Lhassa in 1924, crossed a snowy mountain range practically naked disguised as a beggar, without food except for her shoes which she boiled as soup. Such people are driven by forces ordinary people, including film makers--even Werner Herzog--cannot see.

Grizzley Man the DVD is an example of a film about a wild man made by someone ultra-sane. The film maker betrays Treadwell in the end. When Herzog looks into the eyes of the bear, he can see neither the majesty nor the love that Treadwell sees, only a hungry hulk. Treadwell has a mission. He is incensed by the Forrest service, the government, and others who fail to protect his beloved bears. He rails at them and names names that the film maker is too polite to repeat.

Treadwell will continue to inspire bear watching and bear hunting trips. As long as people accept the barrier that separates man and beast, we will kill and be killed. Had Treadwell known more about bears, he may have survived. He accepted perhaps even welcomed the risk. He wanted to make his statement. He realized that bears can be like people: Some are friends, others can be old, tired, hungry and ready to eat a blonde that looks, smells, and acts like bear food.

2428035,5,B000BMY2NS,"Werner Herzog has always directed unique and truthful films, but ""Grizzly Man"" is a special achievement.  Knowing from the start that the very animal he loves will kill Timothy Treadwell takes nothing from the impact of this film.  Treadwell's affection for grizzlies is simple and direct and he takes enormous pride in `protecting' these enormous creatures.  It isn't just that the film shots are simply amazing, but Treadwell has interjected many of his personal thoughts on his life and the world throughout the film, which Herzog carefully edits.  He states many times that he would rather be killed by a grizzly than to have one killed - a prophetic statement.

There are tender and heartbreaking interviews with family and friends.  One learns as much about Timothy Treadwell's life as we do the bears.  Certainly Treadwell was a nave idealist, but he was able to overcome drug and alcohol abuse as well as the disappointment of coming close to acting fame.  He finally realized his calling in life and lives it fully to the end.  The combination of Treadwell's child-like irresponsibility and Herzog's vision of life as chaotic reality makes for a mesmerizing documentary.  It is beautiful and gut wrenching.",1138924800,12,1215,5.060301507537688
2428066,2,B000BMY2NS,"I felt that the movie kept repeating itself over and over.  Scene after scene, Treadwell is shown talking to the bears, spouting his love for nature, and going on ranting tirades against the government, poachers, and society at large.  I would have liked to see a more linier approach taken to the film with more explanation as to why he chose to live with the bears, and how his unique method of study evolved.  What exactly did Treadwell do in respect to his non-profit?  We are told that he goes around to schools at no charge giving presentations, but what impact did this have?  How did the educators who invited him to speak at their schools view him?  I would also have liked to hear from the Forest service (or at least been told that they had been contacted for comment).  In all, this film was quite redundant with no real climax or ""gee wiz moment.""",1138924800,4,860,4.4743589743589745
2428067,5,B000BMY2NS,"It is surprising that a film which is essentially homemade could be so remarkably engrossing, devastating and tragically beautiful; yet this is what Grizzly Man achieves. Herzog documents not only the views of Timothy Treadwell, but those of his supporters, his friends and his critics.

A well balanced film, its beauty can be recognised in gloriously improvised moments and raw passions. There is something bygone and primeval about Treadwell's existence in the wilds that is so uniquely dangerous and awe-inspiring, that anyone but him and his camera would be powerless to capture it.

The very essence of his life, one that these days is so utterly lost in the modern world, is returned once more to us in this authentic and at times bizarre, but always striking portrayal of a savage, cruel, tragic but rewarding life. Grizzly Man is one of those rare pieces of film that deserves its place among the greats of the genre and is sure to touch the hearts of all who appreciate it.",1138838400,,983,4.845238095238095
2428068,5,B000BMY2NS,"I think that Werner Herzog's documentary ""Grizzly Man"" sheds new light on the Timothy Treadwell saga. From the three books that I read prior to viewing this film, ""Among Grizzlies"" by Treadwell and Palovak, ""Death in the Grizzly Maze"" by Lapinski, and ""The Grizzly Maze"" by Jans, my impressions of Treadwell ranged from misunderstood bear lover to suicidal eco-zealot. Not to slight any of the authors, but the bindings of their books simply can't hold or convey the visual and audible clues necessary to our understanding the crazy dead person that was Timothy Treadwell. To be honest, after viewing this film I still don't know the man, but that was not the purpose of the film. The film simply but powerfully documents Treadwell's imagined bond with brown grizzlies, while unambiguously exposing the fact that almost no bond existed. For me, Treadwell's death was an unfortunate but predictable event, while Amie Huguenard's fate was the real tragedy. Therefore, I judged that my already negative assessment of him was an opinion that would slip even more so by the end of the film. Prior to this film I had never seen Treadwell's videos, nor heard his voice, nor detected his sincerity, nor observed any of his alleged charm or emotional problems. What we immediately detect in this film is his child-like voice and effeminate mannerisms that may have passed for charm in some California circles. And curiously,  we see gentle Tim's friend Jewel Palovak admitting that Treadwell had been taking prescription medication from a doctor for his mood swings, but that he eventually quit taking it. She tells how he said, ""I can't have the middle ground. I have to have the highs and the lows."" Apparently she and other Grizzly People gave Tim the green light to live among grizzlies despite knowing that the boy ain't right. At that point in the film I realized that what some critics had previously labeled as conjecture in Lapinski's book, now appears to be a confirmed medical fact. Also at that point, my assessment of Timothy Treadwell began to change.

""Grizzly Man"" carves out what by now is a well-traveled path of friends, followers and acquaintances of Timothy Treadwell and Amie Huguenard. For me, the down-to-earth Alaskan bush pilot Willy Fulton is easily the most memorable of them all for his recollections of  flying for Tim and Amie, and for his unflinching description of the day that he found his two friends dead. Video footage shot from the air and on the ground pinpoints the places where Timothy camped over the years while videotaping the brown grizzly bears, and the campsite where he and Amie were finally killed. Treadwell's own videos show him repeatedly violating the park rules in order to camp for extended periods of time among the bears, and then crowding them with his camera every chance he got. Treadwell's video images are accompanied by Herzog's careful narration and Richard Thompson's laconic guitar score. They guide us through a maze of Treadwell's own babbling narration and images that often expose Timothy's child-like perception of nature. The years of video tape that he shot inside Katmai National Park were calculated to mislead viewers about him being totally alone, despite the fact that he had made several trips out there accompanied by female companions besides Amie who remain anonymous. Still, he was a meticulous cinematographer, having shot scenes of such spectacular beauty that it prompts Werner Herzog to openly declare his admiration for Treadwell as a cinematographer. Conversely, Herzog's narration often runs anti-parallel to Treadwell's anthropomorphic musings, painting Timothy's world of nature with its beasts as being an unsympathetic jungle of chaos separated by space and time from a well-meaning but fatally flawed man.

Herzog selected about an hour of the over one hundred hours of video shot by Treadwell. The selected images paint a new picture of Timothy Treadwell, and reveal a new context for the circumstances of his death. We are treated not only to Timothy playing with an adoptive fox that he named Timmy, but to Treadwell gleefully palming fresh bear excreta with his hand, declaring that everything in the bear's world is perfect. We get to see an upset and confused Timothy agonizing over the deaths of a bear cub and a fox kit. There is one relatively long scene of him ranting and railing against the Park Service and the wilderness tourists, or perhaps as Herzog suggests, it was Timothy rebelling against civilization itself. During his rant, if it wasn't for the Alaskan scenery in the background, we might be watching the hidden camera video of a mental patient. And finally we get to meet some of the fine Grizzly People who supported Treadwell and launched him on his misguided expeditions. Visually, they project an image of what activists are supposed to look like, rather than being people who take the challenge in stride. Recalling their friend, they explained how Timothy cultivated a near religious experience with the bears. Yes, they actually said ""religious experience."" They seemed to be making excuses for him. But I also got the impression that they were making excuses for themselves, deflecting blame, and being almost apologetic. One wonders if they were mislead by Treadwell, or if it was the other way around. We can see the reaction of horror on the face of Jewel Palovak as she watches Herzog listening to the infamous audio recording of the bear attack. Herzog warns Palovak to never listen to the recording and to destroy the tape. It is a warning for us all. By crossing the line between man and bear, or as Herzog puts it, order and chaos, it was not a matter of if but when one of these anachronistic California flower children would be killed. It was symptomatic of the ""logical disconnect"" that Jans mentions in his book, except it's not just Treadwell that it applies to. This was where things went wrong for Tim and Amie and the Grizzly People. And this film is where my perceptions of Treadwell changed forever. It was difficult to watch these images and not feel pity for him. ""Grizzly Man"" is a film that grabbed me and wouldn't let go.",1138579200,,6162,4.956479690522244
2428069,2,B000BMY2NS,"How someone could take this movie seriously is beyond me. What makes this movie funnier than Chistopher Guest films, and at the same time disturbing, is that it is a real documentary. This is like a new genre of entertainment! Timothy Treadwell had no mission! He was a dilusionary man that saw bears as cute human children in bear suits.  Thats it! He got off on the rush these animal gave him. Thus violating and mocking nature without even knowing it. I thought this movie had to be a mockumentary, but it was not. I found myself laughing through the whole thing because I couldn't believe it was real!!!! Check it out.",1138579200,17,622,4.553571428571429
2428070,5,B000BMY2NS,"I recommend this film because it's an excellent study of the ""do-gooder"" mind taken to the extreme.  Herzog has taken us into the inner mind of people who think they can become something they are not, and attempt to live in dangerous worlds with a belief that they will not suffer consequences just because they intend to do well.

Treadmill's greatest contribution in life may be those 100+ hours of tape, rather than any substantive contribution he made to the bears' well being.  (In this sense, Treadmill is much more film maker, and much less protector of bears.)  In the film's narration, Herzog himself states that he is most fascinated with Treadmill as a film maker, rather than anything else Treadmill claimed he was.

Herzog's film-making craft is superb: he demonstrated how Treadwell wanted to become a bear, or at least cross into the bears' world in a deeper manner than humans are capable.  Herzog also demonstrated how Treadwell kept himself deluded about the fact that his actions could actually harm the bears more than help them and that he would never be harmed himself despite repeatedly engaged in high-risk behavior.

I also find uncanny parallels between Treadwell and do-gooders from America over in Iraq and Afghanistan.  As I write this review a female reporter from the Christian Science Monitor has been kidnapped and may or may not still be alive.  I'm not sure her motivations for going to Iraq, but I'm left to wonder did she think, live Treadwell, that she could live among ""bears"" and not get mauled to death?  Did she ever think that her being in Iraq actually may be harming Iraqis more than helping them?  Did she ever question whether she could become a PR tool for Iraqi fighters or foreign Muslim extremists, just as Treadwill became food for the bears?

I'm one for helping my fellow brothers and sisters in this world, and I try.  However, Herzog's piece is an excellent study and helped me reflect about what my true motivations are when I attempt to help others and what consequences may follow that I didn't intend.

Also, I recommend that film students (as well as the lay-viewer like me who has an arm's-length interest in cinematic arts) watch and take notes of the DVD's special feature where Herzog is working with the musicians and soundtrack production crew.  This feature in its own right is an excellent study of the creative process in soundtrack development and Herzog's approach.",1138579200,8,2437,4.852657004830918
2428071,4,B000BMY2NS,"Werner Herzog has made a movie that is fascinating in many ways.  While Timothy Treadwell captivates us with a natural charisma (flowing from his very deeply self-centered view of himself and the way he projects his needs into a fantasy of the world needing him), we also watch as we would watch a train wreck or a car accident occurring right in front of us.  There is the desire to not see the horror, but we can't seem to look away from something so unusual.

Still, for me, the more interesting part of the movie was not Timothy's stated mission of protecting the bears or his death, but the way he pulled all these other people into his orbit.  Some came in because they fell to his charisma.  Others were drawn in because of services they provided him (flying, supplies, etc.), or because Timothy moved into areas of their purview (the rangers), still others had to deal with the aftermath (the coroner).  It was these professionals that seem to have the most realistic view of what Treadwell actually accomplished, which was nearly nothing beyond self-aggrandizement.  Some might claim that he made the world more aware of the Grizzly Sanctuary.  However, it is already a protected park.  The hunting and killing of the bears if carefully controlled, and despite Treadwell's claims, poaching is all but nonexistent.

I found the scenes with Treadwell's rantings almost embarrassing to watch.  He is clearly a person with serious emotional difficulties.  His shots of the bears are often quite beautiful.  The bear fight is quite special to see, although Treadwell's post-fight play-by-play afterward is marred by his emotionalism and is almost unintelligible, but we get the gist of it.

It is an interesting movie.  Herzog makes it a portrait of many people through their associations with Treadwell.  He even puts in his own assessment of the assessments Treadwell made of nature and the bears, but the filmmaker never judges Treadwell severely.

It is a touching movie, and a cautionary tale of passion going over the edge.  The one thing that struck me as I watched Treadwell wishing he could be a bear was that he got his wish.  Bears sometimes eat other bears.  Timothy was killed and eaten as a bear by an old weak and starving and ill-tempered bear.  Too bad he took his girlfriend with him.

The extras include a documentary on the making of the music for the movie.  It was basically a group improvisation over two days with Herzog himself also directing the broad outline of what he wanted while letting the musicians provide him with what he wanted.  It is a pretty interesting documentary.",1138492800,6,2609,4.837471783295711
2428072,5,B000BMY2NS,Very good. sad ending. There are not many people like Timothy left in this world. All those a$$holz whore criticizd him should learn a lesson from him.,1138406400,3,151,4.62962962962963
2428073,5,B000BMY2NS,"NOTE TO OTHER REVIEWERS: Please review the film itself, not the man of Timothy Treadwell.  Almost every negative review for the film I have read notes how crazy Treadwell was and thus how pointless this documentary is.  One reviewer even noted that he didn't learn anything new about bears, and thus the film was a failure.  These people are missing the point.  Regardless of your feelings towards Treadwell (I think he was a bit daffy myself), this is a fascinating and powerful character study of a tormented man.

Such negative sentiments toward the film would be understandable if it were a hero-worship documentary, but I did not get that vibe from it at all.  Director/Narrator Herzog often voices when he disagrees with Treadwell, interviews people that had negative opinions of him (true, there are no right-wing nuts, but respected ecologists that disagreed with him are given their say), and at one point even says that Treadwell at times seemed overtaken with a madness (he says this during one of the movie's best scenes- Treadwell's rant against the actually effective park service).

What makes ""Grizzly Man"" so good is that it is the study of a flawed human being that met an end so ironic that it almost seemed a higher power was at work.  Treadwell's attempts to communicate with the wild animals are both insane (touching bears on the noses, examining their feces) and touching (the friendships he seemingly develops with local foxes).  His constant ranting against the humans he sees as harming the bears make him unreasonable and unsympathetic, but he also has scenes where he is sympathetic and even likeable (when he laments his past alcoholism, explains his difficulties communicating with women, expresses his love for the wilderness around him).  We see both sides of Treadwell- the loving son and good friend, and the misguided wildman that dangerously habituated bears to the presence of humans.

Ultimately, ""Grizzly Man"" is the compelling and sad story of a unique (or strange) person.  His inevitable end at the hands of the bears he so loved is both appropriate and sad (it is especially sad the woman who accompanied him was killed as well).  Herzog in making ""Grizzly Man"" put together a documentary that will remain the standard of great documentaries for years to come.  This was one of the best movies of the year.",1138320000,9,2350,4.9465648854961835

As mentioned in the movie, he did more to harm bears with his constant intrusion in there areas.  There wasn't one moment in the film were he or the director ever showed him actually helping any wild thing, unless you count the time he sounded as though he was crying at the death of a bee, baby fox, or grizzly cub.  Sounded as though he didn't truly understand the life and death in the animal kingdom or was in some type of denial of the real world.  I'm glad we watched it but I'd suggest renting it, it's not something I need to watch again.

He violated all the rules of human/bear contact and he seemed more interested in playing with the bears than with helping them.  I can't think of one thing I learned about bears after watching this movie other than perhsps to watch out for older bears.

Perhaps the fact that he still slept with his childhood teddy bear should have set off some warning signals. Within the first few minutes of this movie I was rooting for the bears to make his obviously inevitable end painless though mercifully swift for viewer.

To make matters worse when one visits his group's web page, they list a set of rules to follow when around bears. Tim, didn't follow any of them. He was obviously above the rules, what a hypocrite!

The song at the end had me rolling off my chair in uncontrollable laughter (Cochise and Tim Treadwell, give me a break), as did the coroner trying make a switch in professions at the expense of the audience.

When all is said and done this is not a movie about bears. It is a movie about human hubris and psychopathology. It can be viewed as interesting in that context or campy, take your pick.",1138147200,13,1190,4.465437788018433
2428076,5,B000BMY2NS,"Werner Herzog does an amazing job, as does the editing team and people he interviews, at making this a complete view of Timothy Treadwell's life with the Grizzlies. However this movie wouldn't have been possible without the over 100 hours of footage shot by Treadwell during his last five summers with the bears. Herzog is a terrific narator, and I like his laid back interviewing style, and I also think he balances compassion and critism of Treadwell well. We see Treadwell showing his naive love for the bears as he gets up close and talks to them as one would talk to his or her own pet; later we see Treadwell breaking down due to his depression and revolting against the park service that really made his trips possible. He's a fascinating subject whatever one thinks about him. I strongly disagree with anyone who says this film makes a mockery of his death. More than anything Treadwell was lost, and messed up, and naive, but he wasn't a bad person. As much as I respect nature I can't respect his wanting to break the lines between human and wild animal, but I can respect, like Herzog, him giving us this opporitunity to see human nature in a way so fascinating and compelling. In the end Treadwell paid his price, and he took his girlfriend with him, and inbetween all this we see the beauty, the darkness, and the obsession of a human soul.",1138060800,5,1353,4.57201646090535

A lot has been said about how crazy Mr. Treadwell was for going out into the wilderness to live with wild grizzlies.

Crazy? I don't know really what that means any more. Eccentric? I suppose so. Certainly, by the norm.

But he truly gave his life meaning. He found something to do and be to become vitally alive! And he SUCCEEDED for 13 summers! Only failed during one, the 14th. It looks like he gave a great deal back to man and animals and spirit.

He died at the end of the 14th summer. Perhaps not so bad at all. I do wish, however, that he hadn't taken Amy with him. I wish that she had RUN! Another woman loyally giving it all up for her man.

At close to 65 years old, I look at the world and note gruesome death every day--terrorists, disease, war, murder, all kinds of pain and violence. Treadwell's life had lots of meaning for him.

The ironic thing is that Timothy Treadwell thought that he was on the right side of that equation; arguing for the preservation of animals.  Yet, as you watch this fascinating documentary, you see Treadwell slipping into what can only be called madness.  I kept thinking of Captain Ahab as Treadwell yelled at the sky to rain.  He preferred the bear's world to man's world.  The problem was, he seemed to think that made him a bear.

Yet, Treadwell is a likeable guy.  He's like a slightly nuttier version of the Crocodile Guy (if you can imagine such a thing).  You root for him, even though you know he will get eaten.

The tragedy of what happened was hard for me to take because you have to admire their goals. The movie has insight but to my mind it doesn't tell people to stay away from them well enough. I remember years ago I heard about three girls camping out, and that one was dragged out of their camp while in her sleeping bag. The others found her half eaten the next day. At the time I was young and ready to go hunt Grizzlies. I now realize they are just stupid animals looking for a meal. I say stupid because if they had a clue of what humans are capable of doing to them, they would avoid them at all cost. I have a great deal of respect for them otherwise. See the movie at least once and judge for yourself whether his message is inciteful or insightful. I personally like Herzog's documentary ""The White Diamond"" on the rain forest better.

2428105,3,B000BMY2NS,"A sad but highly interesting portrait of a self-obsessed, self-important, idealistic, notoriety-seeking drama queen.

And despite his claims to the contrary, he had to be gay. I don't know of any straight guys who would claim that they ""wished [they] were gay, because it would be so much easier."" Or who talked in that flamboyantly feminine way. Or who went so out of their way to insist that they were not gay. Why was the appearance of his hair so important to him? It seemed like he made himself the center of everything. It wasn't about the bears, it was about Tim Treadwell.

He struck me as someone who could not really cut it in the real world, and so, out of a pure desire for fame and recognition, he invented his own. He saw himself as a kind of ruler or god, and convinced himself that he was protecting the bears and teaching the world about them. He also talked himself into believing that the outside world was the enemy. ""I'll show them, those bastards"" was his mantra, and that vitriolic attitude came spilling out during his paranoid rant.

That he sought no monetary gain is laudable. And I applaud his efforts to find another way of life for himself.

Unfortunately, his subjects ended up eating him.

One thinks of films about loners living in the wild: Jeremiah Johnson, Death Hunt, Dersu Uzala. Films about heroic and courageous men. But to wrangle some poor woman into living out there with him, and then to get her killed too? That's not heroic. Why did he not film the woman? Why didn't he even acknowledge her? I'd guess he wanted us to all believe he was out there totally alone, the brave outlaw, turning his back on civilization because of a stronger kinship he feels for nature in all its rawness and savage beau--jeez, what a load of bollocks!

2428106,5,B000BMY2NS,"I'm not going to reprise what others had said specific to the film. I just want to post a couple of observations. I saw the film in the theater, then read ""The Grizzly Maze"" - a book about Treadwell. I then read Timothy Treadwell's book and watched the DVD. This is an extremely fascinating story that has more about going on than originally meets the eye (BTW, the above mentioned books are both execllent).

I'd highly recommend reading the Grizzly Maze. There are folks in the book who indeed respected what Treadwell had done, including, if I remember, at least one bear biologist.

He definitely endured difficulties that most folks wouldn't endure - living in a tent in Alaska, eating peanut butter and junk foods for an extended time, etc. Secondly, imagine living in a tent in the kind of bear country he camped out in. Not this horse! I've gotten spooked camping out in a tent by racoons at night. :)

I think he did do a lot for spreading awareness of bears and wildlife in general. I really respect him for his gratis lectures to kids.

ALso, I heard some people in the Herzog film show disdain for Treadwell's claims of keeping poachers at bay and that poachers weren't a problem. I find that hard to believe with the going rate for bear parts being what they are (or so I've heard). In Pennsylvania, it's not uncommon for poachers to hunt out of season. It happens all the time and for all manner of animals. Why wouldn't that exist in a dificult-to-police area that exists in Alaska?

Finally, a lot of people lament that he died due to foolishness, bad mistakes, etc. Here's a thought: how many mountain climbers have died the past 5 years alone? Are their goals any more valid than Timothy Treadwell's? Heck, they're usually given a lot of respect, although dying for a mountain can seem absurd to many people.

At least he had something worth devoting his life to and which he, ultimately, gave his life for. I think the world is less of a place without Timothy Treadwell in it.",1137456000,7,1995,4.558659217877095
2428107,5,B000BMY2NS,"I was never a big documentary viewer. Usually with a documentary you really need to be passionate about the subject matter or the human element that the subject matter touches upon. I loved Grizzly Man because it touched on different subjects at once; it's not so much about bears as much as it is about a man who uses bears to fill a hole, a kind of emptiness in his life. Timothy Treadwell was a failed actor who turned his attention to wild life preservation, most specifically, Bears. He lived amongst the bears for 13 years and filming the last 5 of them. The movie is directed... no presented to us by Werner Herzog and he does a great job letting the footage and timothy tell this fascinating yet tragic story. What you will get from this movie is some of the most beautiful scenes of Alaskan wilderness, Bears struggle for survival, like fighting for dominance, while at the same time watch a man slowly drift further away from reality. Timothy at one point states that he wishes he was a bear and could live with his friends. I feel that it was his dilutions that got him and his girlfriend, who by the way really didn't like being there, killed. His growing distain for humanity causes him to break his own rules that eventually cause their demise. Some of the real wonderful moments of the film come when you least expect it, like Tim playing with a fox who is on top of his tent. He eventually befriends the entire fox heard (if that's what they would be called) and almost becomes part of the fox family. You see him really start to consciously hone his filming craft by taking multiple shots of himself and even working from a somewhat constructed script. He was even starting to get some notoriety from this, being on the Letterman show. But as time went on, he found himself wanting to stay longer in the park and further away from reality. Werner Herzog does a great job of narrating while staying someone in the background and not stepping on the movie. If you never thought you would have a documentary in your DVD collection (like me) this will be the one to change that. It is a keeper!",1137456000,4,2107,4.475324675324675
2428108,1,B000BMY2NS,"I bought this DVD and expected to see, at least, some sort of bear behavior in the wild study or organized documentary of grizzly bears in their habitat. Unfortunately,--at least for me-what I saw was about 104 minutes of chaotic splicing of video out of of nearly 100 hours of tape recorded in the last five years of the 13 summers spent by Mr. Treadwell in the wild. Most of this time --at least in the film edited-- crying ""I love you"" to all living animals and talking to them, caressing their excrement and concluding that it came from the butt of a bear, and all that sort of bizarre behavior.

I agree with some reviewers and some ecologists quoted in the film, that he did more harm to the bears and the people who live near this area due to this intrusion in the bears habitat.

I do not think bears --or any other wild animal in their habitat, for that matter--need people like Mr. Treadwell. What I believe bears and all other living animals living in their habitats is to have human beings respect their habitats, perhaps the appropriate technicians and scientists or ecologists assist in the avoidance of their extinction --which is not happening with bears at that place--but what Mr. Treadwell did there? No way. Hope his and his girlfriends' deaths serve as an example on how NOT to intrude in wild beasts living areas. Sometimes Mr. Treadwell gave me the impression that he might have been smoking, inhaling or both, some kind of drug(s) due to his weird, and as he said, ""crazy"" behavior. I am not judging anyone, but I would have not made the investment in this DVD if I had known what I was in for.",1137456000,14,1618,4.5
2428109,5,B000BMY2NS,"There is nothing wrong with ""March of the Penguins,"" or owning cats and dogs as pets. Unfortunately, many of us have affection for the animal kingdom that trancends common sense: wild animals as pets, exotic fur coats, poaching, etc. ""Grizzly Man"" is of course about the ill-fated Mr. Treadwell, whose dedication to the grizzlies is admirable but cannot make up for the instability and recklessness that haunt him. It appears to this reviewer that Treadwell developed a state of dependency through alcoholism and transmuted this dependency from drinking to obsessing about bears.

Herzog correctly emphasizes the problems Treadwell had maintaining close relationships with people, cutting his girlfriends out of his Alaska footage and completely disconnecting from his parents. Such actions are signs of psychological deficits, which Treadwell managed by living among the bears (it appears he stayed away from alcohol this way) but could not escape.

Treadwell's death was seen as inevitable by many people Herzog meets in the film, but the actual circumstances surrounding the bear attack (time of year, etc.) are quite revealing. It makes me wonder if Treadwell really did misunderstand the risks he was taking, or if he simply stopped respecting those risks. Herzog clearly thinks that one of the two is true (I won't give that away here), but I'm not so sure.

Herzog has produced a fantastic product out of interviews plus an incredible amount of Treadwell's footage. Treadwell recorded himself, his surroundings and the bears he loved with impressive competence. Herzog added music and interviews, including the unforgettable Dr. Fallico. Many other animals in film, especially when presented to children, are given artifical personifications. The absurdity of relating to the natural world on purely human terms is demonstrated by ""Grizzly Man.""

Highly recommended, although not for children. Treadwell swears a lot at one point, and Herzog may have included this segment to help discourage parents from showing this movie to children.",1137456000,4,2043,5.415094339622642

I sat through this whole thing with a frown waiting for the big payoff at the end at it never came. Yep' they kept the best part out.

This film does serve as a warning however, a warning that there are very stupid people in the world and if there is a more important message it is that our valuable wildlife does need to be protected. Not just from poachers and development but from people like Timothy Treadwell. Treadwell was an idiot, a complete and total idiot. Only God knows how many bears have had to be killed because they became too familiar with humans and ended up scaring someone. And how many people have already been killed or may be killed because some of these bears familiarization with Treadwell.

Treadwell was a great phony. This was not a man of any integrity, Do not be deceived into believing that he stood for anything at all. If Treadwell was in any way capable of championing any cause that cause was Timothy Treadwell. He definately had no love or respect for nature. He was an intruder and an invader in the world of those animals and he got away with it for 13 years. The local in the middle of the film explains it best, man and bear are not supposed to interact, Treadwell violated their nature. Its amazing he wasn't eaten sooner. Yes this film is tragic, but the tragedy is not that this man was killed but that he lived. Do yourself a favor and do not buy this, I wish I hadn't but I do encourage you to rent it.

2428112,5,B000BMY2NS,"I think you have to ask two questions when judging a documentary:

a) Is it informative?
b) Is it entertaining?

This documentary is both.

Werner Herzog has made a career out of making films and documentaries that depict troubled people.  Here, he went through around a hundred hours of film compiled by Timothy Treadwell, added some interviews, and put together a fascinating examination of a man who had apparently lost touch with reality.

For those not familiar with the story, Treadwell was an actor and recovering alcoholic who studied bears.  For 13 summers he ventured to Alaska and lived among the bears, taking a camera with him for the last few years.  He made appearances on late night talk shows and educational shows, and visited classrooms to educate children about bears.  Despite being criticized by ecologist and park workers, he believed that men could live peacefully among animals and that the bears were misunderstood.

Throughout the documentary, narrated by Herzog, you see a man who was definitely on the edge.  There's footage of him petting Alaskan brown bears.  He treats foxes as if they're family pets.  He talks to the animals and seems to see human qualites in them, though the director confesses that all he sees in the eyes of the bears is an indifferent interest in food.

A lot of this footage was likely never meant to be scene, as there are several instances when Treadwell takes shot after shot of the same thing, just changing his bandana or sunglasses.  There are also instances when he ends up yelling at the camera, cursing the Park Service, and even becoming angry with God because the bears are starving one summer.  Ultimately, Treadwell  and his girlfriend were killed by the animals he loved.

Everyone is familiar with the saying that truth is stranger than fiction, but it's rare to find a film that illustrates that point more clearly.",1137110400,7,1887,4.883647798742138
2428113,3,B000BMY2NS,"Very interesting film.  Though I believe it is true exploitation of the bears, by all involved, including Mr. Treadwell.  He was in an area where he was not supposed to be, doing things around  bears he was not suppose to be doing.  Why the Park Service never put a stop to it, is beyond comprehension.  They knew well what was going on.  They knew, or should have known, it would end in tradegy.  That is why they had RULES in the first place.

For a person, organization, and producer to take advantage of this sick man, and his ""grizzly bear research"", and make money from it, is even sicker.

All these people, who supposedly ""loved"" the great bear, actively took part in, encouragared, and ultimately caused the death of two of the bears they supposedly ""loved"".  The death of the man and woman is sad, surely, but not suprising.  They knew  where they were, and they knew what these bears were capable of.  To do what they did (getting ""close"" to bears) , which resulted in two innoncent bears being killed, is just not defendable.  The idea that for some reason, human beings are not part of the animal world, that we are not flesh and blood like other mammals, that predators never ""mean"" to kill a human, is ridiculous.

If a bear is hungry, and prey not only presents itself, but challenges it, as another predator, or bear might do, it is only reasonable for the bear to accept the challenge, conquer its prey, and then consume it.  Especially since Treadwell and his friend were there, at the time of year bears are trying desperately to put on weight.  Easy prey means life for the bear.  For anyone to benefit and make money over this tragedy is plain sick.",1137110400,3,1671,4.513333333333334

Between Treadwell's amazing nature footage and Richard Thompson's moving soundtrack, it's an aesthetic experience like no other. But Werner Herzog's insightful narrative and his analysis of Treadwell's sad story make this film as deep as it is lovely.

The scenes Treadwell recorded are unbelievable. In one, he wakes up only to find a fox sitting on top of his tent, and another at the door. When he walks away, they follow him like the Pied Piper. I've never seen anything like it.

As Werner Herzog suggests, Tim was a deeply troubled man, but he was also a very beautiful soul. Despite his death, he succeeded in living amongst his beloved bears for 13 summers. He set the terms of his own life entirely, which is more than the rest of us can say. Watch this documentary to be moved by Tim's filmmaking, Richard's music, and Werner's moving testimonial to Tim's enduring spirit.",1137110400,5,944,4.75
2428145,5,B000BMY2NS,"Timothy Treadwell was a mopheaded blond American who spent 12 years living with grizzly bears in the wilds of Alaska. His exploits- sometimes praised, sometimes reviled -would make the Croc Hunter look like a wimp. And in the end, he was killed by his obsession. Director Werner Herzog was able to gain access to all of Treadwell's footage. The resulting documentary is a brooding, intimate portrait of an oddball semi-scientist who felt that he had the answers...but the world just would not listen.

Herzog has become a master at capturing the macabre, electrically-charged essence of the madman, and Treadwell becomes yet another in this pantheon. Under Herzog's crisp, reflective narration we see a man-child who fell in love with the most dangerous terrestrial animal on earth and tried to become one with it.

Treadwell, Aguirre and Fitzcarraldo all had the same type of vision. Each espoused a grandiose idea and became intent on realizing it. Fitzcarraldo had his opera house in the jungle, Aguirre his city of gold, and Treadwell his grizzly protection agenda. All three became so intent on achieving these ends that they destroyed themselves and others in the process.

Herzog listens to the final audiotape of Treadwell and his girlfriend being killed by a starving grizzly, a tear coming into his eye and an expression of dour, empathetic terror crossing his face. It's all real. No one's pretending this time. There's no Klaus Kinski (himself a famed madman), the actors don't go home at the end of the story. This is Herzog's first chance to use primary sources and witnesses to truly get into the mind of a man who failed to find the balance between goals, abilities and reason.

We've seen the wrecked dreams of a man who wanted to bring his passion to a new locale. We've been treated to the tableau of an abandoned, broken man floating down the Amazon on a sinking raft, surrounded by chattering, mocking monkeys. Now we see yet another fool's hero (or hero's fool?) and his animal companions as the world closes in on him. Only this time, they're not monkeys, and they're not harmless.

The film remains respectful of Treadwell's dreams and schemes throughout. This is not a mockumentary of a clownish buffoon. For better or for worse, we can clearly tell that Herzog neither disdains nor outright praises his subject; instead he respects the spirit of the man who seeks to better something in the world, even if, in the end, there doesn't appear to be any tangible result. The story is powerful, the characters are real and (usually) sincere. ""Grizzly Man"" should not be missed.",1137110400,3,2598,4.908883826879271

The truth is this is an utterly fascinating film. Disturbing, yes, but fascinating....and true. Don't let their arrogant criticism deter you from seeing one of the most unique films you are likely to see for some time.

Treadwell had obviously lost touch with reality and wherever the proverbial ""line"" was, he undoubtedly crossed it. His behavior swung between bizarre and very bizarre. Let's face it though, this is what makes this movie so interesting. He had to be mentally detached in order to do what he did. It amazes me he made it as long as he did. How he could stand in front of a bear and shew it away like a harmless dog is unbelievable.

Like any movie, this movie has its good and bad moments, but he gave us some great footage and a fascinating look at a troubled man.

The death of his female companion is the saddest part of this affair. Treadwell did, in a way, have it coming, but it is still sad, and one can only imagine the horror of their manner of death. The gentleman who said Treadwell acted as if the bears were just people wearing bear costumes probably said it best. Treadwell makes it clear throughout the movie that he is perfectly aware of the danger the bears presented, but he was just disturbed enough to think he was immune to that danger.",1137024000,,1432,4.458015267175573
2428147,5,B000BMY2NS,The only setback of this movie for me is the way the director used creepy camera gimmicks of the coroner and other so called Treadwell friends to try and make this whole thing crazier than it actually was.  I think maybe Treadwell was not shown enough for the good things he actually did but painted as some madman with a tent and a camera. While it is clear that he struggled with some inner demons  and perceptions of reality  he could not have lasted thirteen seasons doing this if he was fully  crazy.  There should have been some explanation as to how he began and was able to fund these trips that he took.  I think more could have been explained about how he functioned in the  regular world when it was not season in Alaska.  This may have provided the viewer some sort of balance for Treadwell.  Treadwell was unhappy in the everday world and found a passion  in doing what he believed. What some people see as crazy some might see as almost spiritual.  It's sad that these people were killed and even sadder that people are saying that this was deserved.  Living with bears might be at least as  crazy  as climbing Mount Everest. Treadwell was neither martyr or villian here.  I just hope his soul is finally at piece.,1137024000,,1228,4.443946188340807
2428148,5,B000BMY2NS,"Werner Herzog for presenting this very beautiful and bizarre story of Timothy Treadwell.

Richard Thompson for his sensitive and masterful soundtrack.

This is really two excellent documentaries in one. The first, main show, is the Treadwell story. Initially I really wanted to like Treadwell, and probably would have from more of a distance (from just reading about him, or seeing his wildlife footage), but I find him so odd, often repulsive and yet compelling. His story was at times achingly beautiful - the record of a lonely, isolated, passionate and sensitive soul - , but also at times cloyingly annoying - a delusional, vain and obsessive life's work of filming and acting in his own drama (more often a soap-opera). He sees himself as the heroic gentle eco-warrior but comes across more as a peculiar parody of Mr. Rogers in the Alaskan bush. But it is more Russian Roulett than entertainment.

But besides Treadwell's own odd personality and path (a childish but almost touched-like ability to survive vulnerably in the bush), is his amazing talent for photography and passionate (if misguided) dedication to his work. Herzog treats Treadwell with respect as a fellow film maker, but tempers it with critical balance, seeking to understand and explain his personality flaws. This makes for a facinating documentary, challenging, beautiful, tender and also disturbing.

The second documentary is of the recording of Richard Thompson's soundtrack. This is of a two day session in a Berkeley studio with a small group of serious and sensitive musicians. I found it interesting to see Herzog's direction, appreciation and intimate involvement in the recording process. I also found the music incredibly moving. Richard was the perfect choice to make this music, with his melodic but raw electric and acoustic guitar playing. The interplay between the cello, bass, guitar, piano and percussion players is a real pleasure to watch (and a nice change to see sane creativity after the Treadwell scenes).",1137024000,,2006,5.201238390092879

It's definitely an interesting portrait of an insane man who replaced his drinking addiction with a bear addiction. However, the director creates many forced moments, like when the Grizzly Man's sorta ex-girlfriend is given his watch straight out of an evidence bag. You can just picture the director behind the camera motioning for more tears. He also adds a lot of unecessary commentary and opinions, where the footage itself should be telling the story. ""I believe the universe is chaos."" Okay, thanks Nietzsche, now let's get back to the crazy guy touching the bear poo.

Also, the movie should be called Fox Man, since the foxes seemed to have liked him, while the bears obviously didn't.",1136937600,5,782,4.792592592592593
2428150,5,B000BMY2NS,"Werner Herzog and the people at Lion's Gate should definitely make some more stellar documentaries like this one.  How about ""Cabbage Caller: the story of a man who communicates and lives among a secret society of vicious leafy vegetables""?  Or maybe ""Dust Bunny Diaries: the life and amazing journey of self-discovery of one man's 15-year solitary existence living under his bed""?

This movie is such a joke!  Herzog definitely wins the prize for being the Jerry Springer of documentaries.  This was the most pathetic movie and lunatic cast of characters I have ever seen.  And even though Treadwell definitely wins the Fruit Loop of the Year award, what the heck was Herzog thinking (inhaling, smoking, drinking)?!

Herzog: ""Gee I think I will take as many of the most psychotic staged video clips of this wacko's 100 hrs. of tape as I can find and splice them together to make a quick buck.  And how about I show myself as kind of a deranged cult leader type and try to convince the ex-girlfriend she needs to have a breakdown ON film, convincing her it is the only way she will ever recover from the trauma of her buddy becoming a bear happy meal (can you say 'Mr. Snackwell')?  And oh yeah - this coroner guy I found will definitely add a really nice sicko touch to the whole package.  Oh, zis is looking very good!""

I kept expecting him to bring out surveillance video from some mini-mart, showing Treadwell agonizing over which brand of peanut butter to buy for his junk-food addiction - and Herzog adding a voice over: ""It is evident from zis footage zat Treadwell was full of inner turmoil and ze demons of closeted zexual conflict and peanut envy.""

2428151,1,B000BMY2NS,"This film shows how the not-so-delicate balance between humans and wildlife can be polluted by camera-hungry attention getters.

The protaganist of the film turns out to be the antagonist of the film, a man so smitten with seeing himself on camera that he has to film one take after another of himself saying the exact same thing so that he can look his best on film.

Timothy Treadwell talks throughout the film of how he is the ""protector of the bears!"" He repeats this over & over, as if it were his mantra. But the one time when his camera catches a boatful of fishermen tossing rocks at a grizzly, Treadwell cowers behind his camera, scared to death to let the fishermen see him......afraid of ""protecting"" the very beast he proclaims to love more than anything else on the planet.

By the time Treadwell is killed & eaten by a rogue grizzly, one almost feels as if he deserved what he got. He breached the comfort zone of these wild animals, and eventually paid the price. It was one thing to be careless about his own life, but his inexcusable actions cost the life of his girlfriend, as well.

This film shows the immense dangers of flailing about in the presence of creatures who have a history of being violent.

2428154,4,B000BMY2NS,"The apparent glee with which certain reviewers in this space deconstruct - and then discard - Mr. Treadwell is saddening.  It is also sad to watch the futility unfold in Tim Treadwell's deeply flawed quest to ""protect"" the Alaskan grizzly.  In so many ways, and on so many levels, Herzog shows us the delusion of Treadwell's quixotic ""mission"".

But that's not all.  Treadwell's video of the grizzly is impressive, but similar footage is available from countless other nature documentaries.  A more compelling theme is Treadwell's feckless courage - something to be admired, not mocked.  The demise of this kindly soul was tragically inevitable - he even foretells the precise manner of his doom, on camera, more than once.

Somehow, though, he seems naively detached from death (typical for most).  Treadwell is bewildered and grieved over a fox cub eaten by its parents and the sight of bears killing and eating one another.  His distress reveals an obdurate, childlike refusal to grapple with reality.  His spiritual immaturity is  manifested by an angry prayer to ""God, Allah, Jesus, or whatever"" to bring rain and cause the salmon to run (later that same day he gets a deluge, and then complains about that!).

Shielded behind his video camera, he is detached from his brutal surroundings.  Watching Tim's life unfold, from the comfort of our own homes, puts us out there with him.  There, lying prostrate on our favorite couch, it seems so utterly unreal that the guy behind the camera actually got killed doing this stuff.

But it is real, and by the end of this film, we've come to know Tim Treadwell pretty well.  His appalling death (and that of his girlfriend) confronts us with a stark reminder of our own.  Someday, too, our own delusions will be dissected by the scythe of the Grim Reaper, as we confront the end of life, the only life we will ever live.

This is espeically true for Brown and kodiak bears.  He did far more damage to the bears and any conservation/environmental cause by his actions and this film than he knows.

Then he goes off on some absurd diatribe about his sexuality which we did not need to hear and hear is where I thought: not only does this guy have problems, the director is a moron as well.

2428167,5,B000BMY2NS,"If you want to get together with some friends, have a good laugh and find a lot to make jokes about, watch this movie.  It is a view of the life and amateur videomaking of Tim Treadwell, overgrown adolescent, failed actor, self-promoting protector of some very large carnivores living on a nature preserve in Alaska, and all-around dumb white guy. He acts like Mr. Rogers when he talks to his puppets, and proclaims to be on a first-name basis with these behemoths (warm,fuzzy names that he gave them himself, like ""Mr. Chocolate"") and professes knowing them for years.  He seemed to think he was immune to the fact that they could eat him in a heartbeat, even after observing one mother bear eating her own young during a prolonged drought.  It is amazing that he lasted as long as he did (almost 13 summers in a flimsy nylon tent) -- too bad that he had a naiive lady as company when he finally got eaten up.  At that point, both God and the grizzlies were probably sick of him. As an Aleut museum curator in the movie mentioned when interviewed, if you don't repect grizzlies you pay the price.",1136764800,3,1097,4.49748743718593
2428168,5,B000BMY2NS,"Timothy Treadwell loved grizzly bears; he lived among them for twelve odd years, filmed them, tried to protect them and ultimately was savagely killed by them along with his girlfriend in Alaska. This film, directed and narrated by acclaimed German film maker Werner Herzog, tries to understand his motives and offers differing views on Timothy's quixotic approach to wilderness conservation.

Let's start with the cinematography. Using a hand-held digicam Treadwell's footage is undeniably impressive. You can tell the zoom button is rarely used as he captures shots of fully-grown bears checking out his camp and shooting him hungry stares as he waxes lyrical about his favourite topic. He explains how he cannot be seen to be weak and refuses to give ground to the alpha males or tries to stroke the bear cubs with the mother just yards away. Ozzie Crocodile Hunter, Steve Irwin, has nothing on this bloke. If a fight ever ensued, you know that Timothy would come off a very poor second and since the manner of his death is revealed early on in the film you always feel that violent dismemberment is a distinct possibility. The 100 plus hours of film that was edited into this film captures the full majesty of the expansive landscape and also the personal drama and relationship with nature incredibly.

In contrast with March of the Penguins, for example, Grizzly Man's focus is not on the animals themselves, but on one man's obsession. Park Rangers and ecologists discuss whether this hands-on approach is really beneficial to the animals. Treadwell makes clear his pacifism and that he would never harm a bear, while the rangers explain that to maintain their numbers a 6% cull is necessary each year and that having the bears get used  to a human presence is probably not in their best interests. With each passing year Treadwell associates more with the bears than civilization, highlighted well when he films fellow bear watchers with the kind of paranoia that comes from sitting in a tent with just your teddy for company for weeks. Treadwell is clearly a driven man, and Herzog suggests that this drive comes from wanting to belong to something simpler, nobler and fairer than his life in Los Angeles or Florida would allow. I love that Herzog points out that nature is far from this Utopian ideal. Nature is brutal, dangerous and based on a hierarchical food chain and that's something Morgan Freeman never mentioned about his penguins (""This is a story about love...""). Treadwell turns a semiblind eye to evidence that mature bears have obviously devoured one of their offspring, mentioning all kinds of mitigating circumstances like they would have died of starvation if they hadn't eaten him...

The score by Richard Thomson is fantastic. On the DVD there is a 45 minute mini documentary about its making which could easily be watched in isolation from the film. Thomson is perfect for creating the rough-edged, plaintive soul of the film, nature with a hint of menace, beauty tempered with imminent brutality. Seeing how he crafts the guitar sounds, with cello and acoustic bass, around the progression of a scene is a lesson in professional sound tracking. Herzog is also instrumental in the direction of the sound track. My favourite moment comes when he berates the percussionist for sounding too much like a `bongo playing hippy in Golden Gate Park'. While Treadwell has undeniable hippy tendencies, Herzog eschews direct musical clichs and encourages the band to explore the space and atmosphere of Alaska without sounding like `music for truckers'. Again, compare this to the saccharine Penguins soundtrack which had more in common with Bambi than the unforgiving Antarctic wasteland where it was filmed.

This is a fascinating film which succeeds on many levels. It is perfectly paced featuring candid interviews with friends and colleagues, interspersed with the choicest footage of the bears and, more importantly, the man. Had Treadwell lived to edit his own documentary together it would have been very different, no matter what Herzog implies in his commentary. His film would have been geared towards painting the bears in the best light possible and excluded much of the inherent violence. And the scene where he rants for 5 minutes using very Californian expletives about the attitudes of the park rangers would probably have been left on the virtual cutting room floor. This film is an engaging and fitting tribute to a man whose passionate obsession with bears led to tragedy, yet whose story and filming can inspire similar passion about the wilderness.",1136678400,22,4589,5.0488126649076515
2428169,4,B000BMY2NS,"If you have had  an alcoholic, former alcoholic, bipolar, borderline, pathological liar, narcissist, or any combination thereof in your personal life, you will have a difficult time watching this film.  This may be tribute to Herzog's filmmaking skills, because he distilled the real essence of Treadwell's story from hundreds of hours of bad amateur footage.  But I still had to leave the theater a couple of times.

As an Alaskan, I was familiar with the underlying story, and Herzog didn't change my opinion. I can't manage more than contempt for Treadwell. As far as I am concerned, he killed Amie Huegenard. What I found more interesting are the delusional people who surrounded him: those who got caught up in his fame and looked for ways to profit from it, and those who simply got caught up in his bizarre world. I disagree with the earlier reviewer who accused Herzog of being one of the former. He's done a documentarian's job here.  The real tragedy is Amie, who was among the latter.

A good film, but not a Saturday night popcorn movie.",1136678400,10,1049,4.767955801104972
2428170,5,B000BMY2NS,"In many ways Timothy Treadwell's story of obsessing over bears is a true and tragic retelling of The Great Gatsby, a man who creates a false persona to himself and to others in order to achieve the American Dream. In Herzog's even-handed treatment of this troubled man, we learn that Treadwell grew up with aspirations to be something greater than his mediocrity allowed, a larger than life figure who would proselytize to the world about the need to preserve the ecology and to save bears and as such he would be a great Messiah figure. Treadwell is a failure, a narcissist, and a sexually confused man. We see him fail to become an actor and, failing to beat Woody Harrelson for the spot on Cheers, he goes over the edge, at least according to his father. A third-rate actor, Treadwell works as a ""Prince"" at one of those ghastly theme restaurants where the waiters have to wear unbearable costumes and indulge the tastes of the philistine customers. Like Gatsby in the novel, Treadwell creates a false identity to impress his new friends. Indeed, Treadwell is not even his real name but something that he thought would help spice his acting career. Additionally, he lies to everyone, claiming to be from Australia and affecting an accent so unconvincing that at best, we hear one former friend say he sounded a bit like the Kennedys. To add to his foppish ways, Treadwell grows ridiculously long blond bangs to cover his receding hair line, evincing a megalomaniacal vanity that annoys throughout the footage. But beyond the cosmetics and identity alterations, we see a profile of a deeply troubled narcissist who hates the world, civilization, and the human race more and more for rejecting him as a ""great actor."" As his frustration grows, he becomes more and more absorbed in a fantasy animal world in which Treadwell indulges in the child's cutesy Bambi fantasy that would have him believe he is achieving a mystical bond with the ferocious grizzly bears and is ""saving"" them from destruction. Listening to his high-pitched sing-song ""conversations"" with the bears will make you cringe. His delusions are apparent and it is inevitable that tragedy will strike.

Many people warned me not to watch this film, saying that Treadwell is too annoying in his misanthropic rages and megalomania to watch for 90 minutes. Others told me the film was a laugh-out-loud riot. But I found the film far deeper than a comedy or a mean profile of a troubled failed actor. I saw the film as a profound commentary about how we deal with failure and the fantasies we create to make ourselves acceptable and heroic and the tragic consequences of those fantasies. The director Herzog handles this material with insouciance and sensitivity. A moving, haunting documentary.",1136592000,11,2757,4.9036402569593145
2428171,3,B000BMY2NS,"First off, I have to wonder what Timothy Treadwell would have thought of the film Herzog made with his footage from the wild. TT shot over 100hrs of footage living with the grizzly bears. What got edited down for a feature length film is barely 1/50th. The film is about Treadwell, not the bears. I wonder if he'd lived, if Treadwell would have done anything with his footage. And if so, if he'd made himself feature as prominently as Herzog did? I think he would have made himself the star, but obviously he would have chosen other footage. He would have chosen the *good* takes, not the confessional ones where he comes off like a cursing lunatic. And then what would we have thought of all this? If he hadn't been eaten by a bear (oh yes, of course he does)--and if he edited the film to his best advantage, would we be lauding him as some incredible wilderness guru? I wonder. Would Timothy Treadwell have finally found the love and acceptance he so desperately needed? Well, the problem when you're dead is, you no longer have control over your life's work. If your family wants to sell the rights to your work rather than protect your memory then you're screwed.

Treadwell was DEEPLY disturbed, clearly bi-polar, and clearly homosexual, though deeply in denial. He is the classic self-hating homosexual who can't come out, can't even allow himself to admit it to himself. Who continues to bang his head against woman after woman (pun intended), all the time wondering *What went wrong? Why don't they love me?* --when it's clearly HE who doesn't love them.

I wonder if he'd only been able to deal with his sexuality, if he could have discovered a life for himself that was worth living. Instead, he retreats to the wild, deludes himself into believing he's doing *important work protecting the bears and wildlife*--and ultimately fulfilling his own death wish.

He was a failed actor in the civilized world, a closeted, conflicted gay man with bi-polar illness, who reinvented himself in the wild with delusions of grandeur and a video cam. He made wildlife presentations to grade school children *for FREE*. He didn't even value what he was doing enough to charge money for it he just wanted to be loved and accepted so badly.

Werner Herzog didn't encourage Timothy Treadwell to do what he did, or get eaten by a bear. But he's profited from it. Is that ethical? There's been a raging debate since this film's debut. Herzog chose to expose Treadwell's sickness. That's the *story* of the film. Concealing it would have been unethical too, I suppose. No one could have stopped Treadwell from doing what he did. He'd have found a way. But watching it on the big screen, seeing this lunatic self-destruct, is a spectacle for only the least sensitive, most hardened and hateful individuals. Homophobes, anti-environmentalists, will LOVE this film.

And that's enough to make me sick.",1136592000,7,2889,4.793172690763052
2428172,1,B000BMY2NS,"Treadwell is a sad creature: lost, confused, narcissistic and not very bright. He is nominally interested in bears, but it could be anything: bumblebees, butterflies, foxes, flowers. He loves them all with the sentiment of a child, which in many respects he still is (sleeping with a teddy bear, for example). But what he really loves is the camera and the persona he creates for himself via it. What's lacking, and is immensely sad, is a curiosity for anything other than this. He is not interested in the world, only in himself.

Enter Herzog as post-mortem witness. According to him a man makes only one journey, and it's always into the heart of darkness. The names change (Aguirre, Fitzcarraldo, Kaspar Houser, Treadwell), but the characters and theme do not. For Herzog life is a one-trick pony - vulnerable civilization vs. brute nature, with or without a god overlooking the proceedings.

2428185,5,B000BMY2NS,"Warner Herzog is a brilliant and masterful director. The way he put together the story of Tim Treadwell and his life with grizzly's defies the constructs of formulaic ""nature"" doc's. It goes deep, as we are allowed to dive into the mind and psyche's of both Treadwell and Herzog as Treadwell's fated story is revealed to us through bits of the 100 hours of footage Treadwell left behind, new interviews, insights, and a brilliant and personal narrative done by Herzog himself.

As Herzog gets to know Treadwell through his footage and loved ones left behind, he is touched, changed, and allows the audience to revel in his new found awe, frustrations, and respect for Treadwell's life.

The film documents the life of ""the Girzzly Man"" timothy Treadwell through his leftover footage from thirteen summers he lived with, and immersed himself into the grizzly habitat and culture. He felt he was a grizzly, and thus broke boundaries that have been respected among the Alaskan natives concerning these brown beasts. He created what he felt to be a bond, a brotherhood with these majestic animals. But was this conquest purely for scientific reasoning or was he truly terrified of the ""human world."" That is where Herzog directs this film.

The fascinating thing about Herzog's interviews is what he catches after his participants are done answering his questions, and we see these souls search and ponder for answers to questions they may never know the answer too.

""Grizzly Man"" won the Alfred P. Sloan award at this years Sundance film festival, which goes to the film felt to tie in science and discovery into normal narrative paradigm. This film deserved it's praise and was thusly purchased for theatrical release by Lions Gate before it's release on television through Discovery films.

BUT - If you've seen the film in the theatre, then you'll remember the scene where Timothy Treadwell is interviewed by David Letterman. The clip is short, but key to the film: It demonstrates that Treadwell had achieved national attention at a very high level - and also is memorably and powerfully ironic when Letterman (in his typical snarky manner) asks Treadwell: ""So, are we going to open up the newspaper someday and read that you were eaten by a bear?""  Talk about foreshadowing!

However - This scene is NOT in the dvd version! My guess is that Letterman's company wanted too much for the dvd royalties, so Herzog (or the studio) simply cut it out.  Makes one wonder what else we don't see on dvds.... Too bad.",1136332800,,960,4.730538922155689

Claiming this hastily researched and poorly executed attempt at explaining Timothy Treadwell and the bears of Katmai to be a ""documentary"" is equivalent to calling ""Jaws"" a documentary about sharks. My rating of 1 is, sadly, only as low as Amazon would allow me to enter... This film is below the rating scale.

Herzog has substituted credibility with trite emotionalism, and fact with speculation and made-for-bad-TV theatrics.  He has managed to put together merely a sensationalist enviro-drama of the worst kind.  Herzog's selected choice of Treadwell's video clips and samples of his unbalanced behavior, coupled with his (Herzog's) own bizarrely executed ""interviews"" with an extremely limited group of sources are not only disturbing, but also distort the circumstances and events that took place in the land called reality.  He does no service to either man or bear in this total failure in film-making.

If you - as a Treadwell supporter, critic or undecided - are interested in a credible, well-researched and infinitely more accurate and well-presented account about Timothy Treadwell's life and death among the bears of Katmai - including the motivation behind his choices and his ultimately fatal mistakes, remove this DVD from your shopping cart and read Nick Jans' book, The Grizzly Maze, instead.",1136246400,13,1421,5.2105263157894735

2428193,4,B000BMY2NS,"I still recall reading the local paper's article on Timothy Treadwell and Amie Huguenard's ghastly killings and consumption by a grizzly.  A shame, I thought, but what an idiot Treadwell was.  However this documentary brings me up a little short.  The initial impression remains but is tempered by Treadwell's rather manic complexity and passions.  A failed athlete and actor, he ""spiraled down"" as his father said into drugs, booze, and a false persona he made from scratch.  He finally found his dream in watching over his bears.

Unexpectedly you find yourself feeling some of the same gusto for the grizzlies Treadwell has--for their awesome power and size, and for their right to be left alone by humans, including the buffoon he videotaped throwing rocks at a grizzly.  But normal people also understand to keep their distance.  Even more ironic than his mauling, which was certainly an expected result, was a local Aleut museum curator's statement that Treadwell was actually harming the grizzly population, not protecting it as he thought.  Close encounters of humans and bears could make the latter used to humans, a horrifically bad idea for both species.

Treadwell constantly spoke of how dangerous his mission was, to the point of bragging sometimes.  He seemed immune to his own warnings.  He should have gotten a clue when, in his own tapes, he laments wolves killing a fox kit (not even for food, apparently) and grizzlies eating their own cubs.  You cannot but feel Treadwell's passion for nature, its beauty and brutal simplicity.  But you also understand, as does the documentary producer Werner Herzog, that ultimately nature is about trying to stay alive.  That effort entails killing and eating in the most savage manner.

Inexplicably Herzog begs off any kind of substantial report on Treadwell's girlfriend Huguenard.  Maybe her family didn't want to talk, but she surely had friends, acquaintances, and other relatives to talk to, not to mention yearbooks, jobs, and the like to refer to.  She surely deserved more than just a few sentences.  Nonetheless, this is a sobering and largely sympathetic documentary.  You'll still shake your head at Treadwell's naivete but you'll also get a glimpse at a troubled soul who did remarkable things, one which will give you a glimmer of understanding of why he did what he did.

2428194,3,B000BMY2NS,"""Grizzly Man"" is a decent doc about Timothy Treadwell, the man who spent thirteen seasons in an Alaska national park living amongst the grizzly bears that inhabit the park. The documentary isn't without its faults.

To say that Tim Treadwell was a troubled man, is like saying its dark out at night. He was a very troubled man. Trying to make it in Hollywood, Treadwell was a struggling actor. His claim to fame was being the runner-up for the role that would eventually go to Woody Harelson on ""Cheers"".

With the loss of a role that would have led him to stardom, Treadwell fell into a deep depression (that I truly believe he never got out of, even with his 13 seasons of bear watching) that led to drinking & drug bingeing, until the early nineties when on a trip to Alaska, Treadwell had a run in with one of the park's  grizzly bears. Treadwell held his ground & to his amazement the bear backed off. The following season Treadwell returned & began his first of thirteen seasons with the bears.

During the last five seasons, Tim brought a video camera, chronicling what would be the last five seasons of his life. In the final season, 2003, Treadwell brought his girlfriend, Aimmee Huegenard along for the season.

By early October, the relationship between the two would be severely strained. The couple had made their way to the Grizzly Maze, the land where the grizzlies hunker down for the winter & hibernate. The final day they set up camp on the outskirts of the maze with, would have been, the following day packing up their gear & leaving the area for the season by plane. Treadwell & Hugenhard would never see the dawn. Sometime during the early evening hours the two would be killed & eaten by an older, desperate, hungry, grizzly bear that ironically enough, Treadwell had been filming & trying to communicate with earlier in the day.

""Grizzly Man"" is one of those films that sticks with you after you watch it. The films highlight's include a grizzly fight between two bears over the right to mate with one of the female bears, all nature footage shot by Treadwell, Treadwell's fox friends, the footage of Treadwell actually touching one of the grizzlies on the nose while filming with the hand held camera & the haunting images of Ammie who Treadwell never got a decent camera shot of (all the shots are in shadow or back to the camera, or her hair is over her face). Also some disturbing images that make one believe that Treadwell's mask of sanity was slowly slipping (the scene where he prays to God for rain is a bit much, but, then when it actually rains is even a bit more weird). The ranting of Treadwell & everything that was wrong in his life was absolute bonkers.

There are some problems with this film however (henceforth, the three star rating).

Werner Herzog himself narrated the film in his German accent & sound strained. He should have gotten a professional voice over artist for this.

First off, here is a man who is clearly not in the right frame of mind ""teaching"" kids about grizzly bears. Not so much as teaching the class about grizzly bears but introducing the class to the bears who are his ""friends"".

It's never shown what Treadwell did in the off season.

It's never shown where Treadwell got his money for his equipment & supplies (sure one of the cameras was a Xmas gift but where did he get the other one from?).

For me, the saddest part of all, is a tragic missed chance to really study & possibly learn more about the grizzly bear & it's habitat. Timothy Treadwell had a special gift, but, in my opinion, he never used it to the fullest extent. As for Timothy Treadwell, I hope has become one with the spirit of the Grizzly.

""Grizzly Man"" is a film that is worth seeing, but, like so many other mainstream films, doesn't live up to its own hype.

Watching the footage Treadwell recorded while living among the bears produces the same feelings as listening to a captivating scholar and watching a child touch a hot stove at the same time. He's dazzling and informative, but his life is also frightening. His death seemed as inevitable as the eclectic Treadwell's onetime guest appearance with the bewitched David Letterman.

Because of Treadwell's foolhardy endeavors, he recorded video that only an amateur could capture. For union issues and insurance risks alone, no production company would ever finance someone to make a film while living among bears (he actually touches them on occasion). His footage of bears at play, catching salmon and battling for territorial rights are the film's greatest feature.  But the pleasure gained from viewing them forever tethers itself to the knowledge that the project led to the death of the filmmaker. We literally view the world as a dead man saw it.  Is this exploitation?  Some would say ""Yes"".

Whether the film exploits his death is as ambiguous as the message of his life.  I would guess that a dozen people would come away from Grizzly Man with 12 different opinions of Treadwell.  Some would say he is to be admired, a man so full of life that his love and dreams seemed to infect all who met him (the only detractors in the film are people who never met him).  Other people will find his life laughable, pointing to his lack of accomplishments and the possibility that he caused more harm to the bears by assimilating them to man.

I found him to be sincere, but a bit lost. I saw a boy who played with teddy bears as a child and then tried to play with the real things as an adult...or maybe never really grew up at all.  He was not the grizzly's messiah, as he seemed to believe, but he did live with a zest for life and a determination for curing the wrongs he thought existed.  Should we really judge him so harshly because his vision of the world was a bit unrealistic?

Many define him by his oddities, questionable judgment and grandiose behaviors.  But the film presents a deeper understanding of the man.  By ending with an old cowboy ballad, Grizzly Man marries Treadwell to the romantic ideal of the frontiersman, a man who casts off the comforts and stability of society to quench a thirst only satisfied in nature.  All we can really say about his motivations is that Timothy Treadwell found something living with the grizzly bears that gave him purpose in life.  We should all be so lucky.

2428208,1,B000BMY2NS,"The only thing I liked about this movie was the  photography of the grizzly bears.  As far as Treadway - I thought he was a total nutcase.  He focused too much on himself and really didn't give us much information on the bears at all.  When he got so carried away on flipping off the game department - that entire scene should have been deleted - it only showed what a jerk he was.  That was the part of the movie that really turned the entire movie off for me.  I think that bear had just about enough of him also.  Too bad!

There are much better films out there than this one!  I was very disappointed.",1136073600,9,605,4.102564102564102
2428209,5,B000BMY2NS,"I have read through many reviews and enjoyed some wonderfully insightful ones, thank you!  So I won't elaborate further on the psychological issues and personal demons that tortured Timothy Treadwell.  Still, I'd like to add my five cents.

During the first five minutes or so, your initial reaction will probably be ""what an arrogant prick!"", but hang with it, and this extremely well done documentary will unfold and reveal the depths of this man's feelings, however ""misplaced"" they may have been.  In some instances I could identify with his absolute love for his work and wishful thinking that hunters and poachers and people in general be banned from his self-proclaimed paradise. People can be deceitful, non-trustworthy, and toy with one's emotions.  Animals are none of these things.  And therefore I understand why Timothy Treadwell was drawn to the simplicity of these animals' lives as well as their absolute and raw power.  But he lost sight of that important aspect when he proclaimed himself their master, and in the end that fateful mistake ended his life.

I had to laugh at the segments with a former girlfriend and the parents:  their wooden postures are so true of most people who are suddenly faced with a camera staring at them and don't know what to do and how to behave.  It gives the documentary an authenticity which a more fluent acting might have bleached out.

While this documentary evokes stong and often opposite feelings, one thing is for sure:  it sticks with you.  And this guy had more guts than a hundred people put together.  Maybe one could call it a death wish, but I know that even if I was suicidal I wouldn't try to pet a grizzly! -  In the end, though, how many people can claim that they lived their life exactly the way they wanted and died doing what they love?",1136073600,,1808,4.731629392971246

Ebert and Roeper gave this two thumbs up, I usually trust their judgement.  What they were thinking about in regards to this DVD I have no idea, it is a bloated look at a very self-deluded man who believes he's protecting grizzlies, without providing any evidence he's protecting anything but his own delusions.

I bought this DVD in hopes I'd have a collection of scenes of grizzlies, and while there is about 5 - 10 minutes of great grizzly scenes, which is why I gave the DVD two stars, the rest is all about a man who attempted to create a world of his own on his terms in a world where his terms didn't really matter.  I agree with the locals who criticized Treadwell's intrusive behavior on nature.

If your looking for a documentary on the life of grizzlies like I was; this is not your DVD.  If your looking for a documentary on a man focused on his own selfish need to control nature and experience nature not on its terms, but by attempting to humanize nature, then maybe this is a good pick for you.

This is a documentary based on the tragic life and circumstances that ultimately led to Tim and his girlfriend's death, not about bears, wildlife, nature, etc. It was about how this lost person found solace in an extremely (bizarre) dangerous environment and made it his life's work to ""protect"". No one is claiming from what I can tell that this is anything other than just that, the circumstances and background that led to two fragile human beings awful death, really no more, no less. I AM an Alaskan, I AM a hunter and although I personally thought and now have confirmed that Tim was a nutcase on many levels, but I also recognize genius in his efforts to protect the reserve. He put the area on the map and believe it when I tell you that there are many poachers out there just looking for that rug to hang or walk on, and most of them are trophy hunters from outside Alaska. Tim wasn't the only, the first or will be the last of those that thought way outside the box and was called ill, or crazy for his ambitions.",1135987200,9,1175,4.444444444444445
2428212,3,B000BMY2NS,"GRIZZLY MAN is an intriguing and deeply disturbing look at one young man's end of life experiences in the far reaches of the Alaskan wilderness, living, ""working,"" and isolating himself with the most deadly creatures on Earth: the Grizzly Bear.

Timothy Treadwell is this man, and although the documentary takes on the initial look and feel of a nature film, it is anything but. Tim, as we come to know him, is the focus of this strangely watchable documentary, inserting himself in almost every shot and speaking about how he's there to ""protect"" the bears (even though he spends much of his time in a National Park where they're protected anyway), to bond with them (a definite no-no as we learn through the film's machinations), and to rant about the outside world and how they (we) don't understand what he's trying to do out there.

For those looking for a feel-good documentary about a man living with bears in a beautiful landscape, you'd best look elsewhere.

To me, this film showed how a man with an obvious mental illness can become so obsessed with an idea (""loving"" the bears) that it ends up killing him. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy nature films as much as the next person, but I think if you're looking for information about Grizzlies and how to interact with them, this just ain't the film to watch. Tim constantly puts himself in harms way and even goes so far as to take a dip (swim) with a Grizzly, and then proceeds to pet it! He turns his back on the bears and hides his tent in brambles, a risky way to camp in Grizzly country.

The mental illness aspect of Tim's psyche was smackingly obvious to me. The man's preconceptions of right and wrong were very bizarre. Initially he praises the park service, but later rants about them and their ""F-ing"" policies. He becomes paranoid about everyone and everything, moving his camp into dangerous areas. He befriends every animal as if it had human qualities, even some pretty cute little foxes, and tells them how he ""loves"" them and won't let anything happen to them (I've never heard a man say ""I love you"" more often to animals than Tim). How about loving the race you belong to? You know, the human race?

But even with all these issues, the film pulls you in in a very strange fashion, and this can be two-fold depending on your stance on certain nature issues; some (like me) wanted to scream at the screen and warn Tim about what he was doing and how it would all end if he didn't take precautions (he does get killed and eaten by a bear in the end, by the way); others might say, ""go ahead, let him get killed. Who cares.""",1135987200,16,2596,4.503184713375796
2428213,5,B000BMY2NS,"Werner Herzog, who gave us Fitzcarraldo, (one of the best movies ever made), is really in his element here.  No one understands obsession and madness quite like he does and in Timothy Treadwell he has found a perfect subject. One imagines, at first, a well-meaning introvert more at home in nature than in society. What emerges is a descent into madness and delusion played out in high stakes gaming before a spectacular natural backdrop.

Treadwell sees himself as defender, protector, and advocate for these wild and often vicious behemoths who, ironically, are already being defended and protected in a National Park. As Herzog demonstrates, Treadwell created an elaborate mythology about himself, one major lie is that he was alone - for much of the time he wasn't. As the movie develops Treadwell's rants become increasingly shrill and desperate as he labors to convince himself and us that his uninformed and pointless dare-devil antics actually have meaning.

We can be awed by his insane recklessness but to think that he contributed anything, as he claimed, is ludicrous. Maybe Treadwell swapped his addiction to booze for an addiction to adrenaline. He certainly didn't help the bears any, indeed, he did them a disservice. What makes this film so fascinating is how accurately Herzog captures Treadwell's many personas. Treadwell was quite literally the writer, director, producer, star, (and in an odd way also audience), for his own movie, carefully manipulating and deceiving viewers. If there is anyone who is surprised by his fate just remember that he choreographed it painstakingly and when it arrived probably greeted it with something resembling religious ecstasy.",1135987200,7,1684,5.25278810408922
2428214,5,B000BMY2NS,"After watching ""Grizzly Man"" I must say I can see why such accolades were heaped upon this piece of work.  As a pediatrician taking care of children with mental illnesses including Bipolar Disorder, ADHD and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder this documentary brings multiple thoughts and emotions.  This film was fascinating in that it was by no means a documentary about Grizzlies. By the first frame of video and verbage of Mr. Treadwell it was obviously a film about the face of severe Bipolar Disorder.  There was not a moment of this man on the screen that was NOT a depiction of classic (nearly textbook) fast cycling Bipolar.

  The true amazing nature of this film is the lack of any acknowledgement of what was happening to this man amongst family and friends. So many of the others interviewed seemed detached and blunted which makes me believe they were in need of help or were receiving innappropriate help or self-medicating. (I do believe that even the coroner who received the body parts was ill)  Mr. Treadwell exhibited obviously rapid mood cycling, rages, delusional thinking and grandiose thinking.

  This film was truly maddening to me on several levels.  First, by no means should this man ever be called a naturalist or any sort of Grizzly expert.  Mr. Treadwell was so severely mentally ill that his narcissism could not allow him to think of anyone but himself, let alone a bear in a federally protected reserve. Second, I am personally  saddened that this obviously very bright man with great human potential(as it seems all with mental illness have)never seemed to receive (or possibly accept) good mental health care.  I believe there was a mention of some meds including anti-depressants but it was in passing.(anti-depressants being the very worst thing he could have done-this man was in desperate need of good mood-stabilizers  I understand that this film needed to be couched as a film about Grizzlies by the film makers and the media in order to,in a way, shock the audience when they see what really unfolds-I suppose this does bring about great film rewards and honors...as this film should receive. Thirdly, I must say even though I fully understand that Mr. Treadwell was severely ill I do have anger towards him for getting his girlfriend in the situation he did.  Of course I have no idea of the complexity of the relationship between them(the film makers do keep this very curiously underdeveloped) but I believe Mr. Treadwell despite his issues could have and should have kept this woman safe.  I believe this man committed suicide by Grizzly and was planning it for quite a time hence my disdain for this action that led to her death by mauling.

  In conclusion, this very great film should be required viewing by all mental health care professionals especially if they have interest in identifying and helping children and adults with mood instabilities.  Environmentalists and Naturalists beware; this film will anger and possibly disgust you, as it should.

2428246,3,B000BMY2NS,"I've read a few articles about Timothy Treadwell living with grizzly bears so I knew the main points of his story before watching the film.

Based on the articles it is clear that Treadwell was a bit ""off"". After seeing the film, and hearing him speak, though it is clear that he was really bat sh*t crazy. This guy's perceptions and reality were on two complete opposite ends of the spectrum.

He continually said how he was studying the bears and protecting them yet it is never clear how he was doing either of these things. If anything I think he did the bears more harm than good by habituating them to humans. Let wild animals be wild animals.

That said, the film was entertaining though not very well done in my opinion. Most of the film was pieces of Treadwell's footage slapped together. The footage was interesting but much of it was repetitive. It made me wonder if there were more worthwile clips that were left out by the director. I also found it irritating when the narration would include the director's own opinions. It would have been better to let Treadwell's footage stand alone.

The rest of the footage was interviews with people from Treadwell's life (who all seemed very odd/creepy to me). These interviews were also somewhat repetitive and there were awkward pauses that could have been cut. The footage that bothered me most was that showing the director listening to the final tape of Treadwell's that had audio of the bear mauling. It seemd to be included only to say, ""Look how cool I am. I'm one of only a handful of people to ever hear this."" and didn't do anything to push the story forward.",1135900800,3,1624,4.589655172413793

2428250,4,B000BMY2NS,"While I definitely think that Herzog has pieced together a very good, flowing documentary on Timothy Treadwell, the movie is less a portrait of a conservationist in the spirit of ""Gorillaz in the Mist"" and more a portrait of mental disease.  Everyone asks what motivated Treadwell, but he answers it for everyone halfway through the film.  Essentially, he says ""this is all I have now.""

This is not to say his love for the bears is not genuine.  He obviously cares about them, to the point where he detached himself not only from the reality of the human world, but from the reality of the natural world, best seen when he is unable to deal with the simple facts of the food chain when one of his foxes is eaten.  Treadwell personifies the bears, potentially in need of contact with something that isn't human, a creature he grows to loathe more and more with each passing day.  And with each passing day, his paranoia grows.  At the end of his 200(1?) expedition, he goes on a long tirade about how everyone, including his colleagues for the past thirteen years, don't care about him or his furry friends.  It is also around this point that Herzog focuses less on Treadwell's nobility, and more on what appears to be his fleeting mind.  Even his sexuality is repeatedly called into question, largely due to his own fault: ""I wish I were gay, but I can't be.""

And this is how the film succeeds.  Its not a ""March of the Penguins"" documentary, showing us how bears survive in the wilderness.  It didn't even focus much on how Treadwell himself survived.  Yet Herzog managed to make what could have been a very bland nature film into a story about a lonely, paranoid, socially isolated and confused man who wandered into the wilderness seeking to escape the world of man and its demons, yet took them with him as he undermined the cold reality of the natural world.",1135814400,4,1865,4.581325301204819

This all makes perfect sense, of course -- bears will be bears and all -- but I can't shake the feeling that the guy never imaged such a thing could happen.

  OK. I bought this DVD as a result of the prodigious accolades and plethora of encouraging reviews. I am a documentary fan and possess a prolific number of the most revered around. That being said...

  Wow. Just amazing. I could not have been more disappointed in a film that showcases the harmful effects of one deluded man's selfish agenda to be near one of natures most beautiful but dangerous creatures. Timothy Treadwell's love of the Grizzly is very real and very covered in this film. That is not in contention.  What is in contention is did he do more harm than good by his acclimating the bears to the human presence? This is touched upon briefly in the film. Too briefly. It is the capstone of what should have been the central argument of this film. Herzog, however, wanted to show the love Tim had for all creatures (and he does). Herzog does admit to having a difference of opinion about the cycle of nature as does Timothy. However, apart from that, we're left with a mess of a man who does not truly belong outside of proximity to qualified mental physicians.

  I am not sure where to draw the start line on the bizarre scenes we are treated to in this film. Well, there's the lonely monologue where he declares, repeatedly to himself, that he is not gay. All mannerisms and inflections aside, I could not care less if he mated with rocks. Crazy is crazy.

  How about the conversation he has with a sleeping fox about his prior alcoholism. Or, perhaps, the dead bee he finds that moves his to say ""I love you"" to the insect's corpse. No, no. I got it. It's the pile of bear excrement he comes upon that was recently expelled, as he says, ""from her butt"". He is so taken with joy that a part of her is here, still warm, that he pets the pile of poo. Let me repeat that: HE PETS A PILE OF POO!

  I am reticent about going on. It does not get better. Yes, he loved these creatures. Yes, he thought he was doing well by spending his time with them. No, he did not deserve to die (and neither did Amy). I know he was ""saved"" from his excessive alcohol and drug abuse by these creatures. But these creatures have no idea what your background is and, more importantly, they don't care. No matter what you think. The title should be changed from ""Grizzly Bear"" to ""2 Lives, Wasted.""",1135728000,44,2306,4.390588235294118
2428265,4,B000BMY2NS,"After reading his book and now watching this documentary, I began to realized one major factor in this universe that cannot be denied, Alaskan grizzly bears must be one of the most tolerance creatures on earth.

Okay, now that the joke is over, I am musing why this documentary was made and for what purpose? In one hand, you have the friends of Timothy Treadwell trying to rise him into a mythical status. Then you have Timothy Treadwell himself as the main attraction who basically behaved like some sort of man-child who seem to be suffering from borderline paranoid schizophrenic who anthropomorphized wild bears. I think this is where Treadwell totally missed the boat for all to see. He forgot that bears and man don't mixed, which means he and the bears shouldn't mixed. When a bear get too comfort with a man, that bear usually dies by the hand of man and his rifle. That is one of the basic rules living in Alaska. In one of the great ironies of Treadwell is how possessive he was becoming toward the bears as if he had ownership rights and park services ""don't care"" about them. In this, Treadwell become an unarmed proacher himself, by interfering with the bears' natural state. It was also weird to listened to Treadwell talked about how dangerous bears can be and all that - but yet ignoring his own warnings, relying on some sort of special karma he thinks he have with the bears. His arrogance and ignorance is appalling to say the least.

This DVD reflects the man who was willing to break all the rules to protect a host of animals who in his extreme paranoia, believed to be hunted down without respite. Over 100 hours of video tapes have par down to show us what kind of man Timothy Treadwell was when he was in Alaska and to most outdoorsy type Alaskans like myself, it wasn't a very pretty sight. I supposed you got give this guy credit, he was very stupid but also very true to his nature and cause. His end was almost poetic justice although it was with deep regret that he took an innocent life with him.

Overall, a well made documentary, well edited and although it does dragged somewhat thanks to some dry spots like that interview with Treadwell's former girlfriend which I agreed with one of the previous reviewers, it served no purpose at all in this documentary. That time should have been spend on the woman who died with Treadwell, whose only major mistake she made in her life was trusting him.

The DVD that come with this film is basically your stripped down version. There is a 50 minutes extra feature on how they created the soundtrack for this movie. A very dry and somewhat uninteresting segment. Then there is only the trailer for this movie and trailers for several Lion Gates films. The DVD image proves to be quite good, since much of it is from Treadwell's own tapes, super movie like sharpness probably cannot be attained. The sound is your basic 2 speaker Dolby Surround Sound.

He spent more than a 100 hours of videotaping the bears and himself living with them in their forestes and fields. This is one of the best documentaries ever made about how this man lived and breathed wild life.

The documentary goes on to show how Timothy lived and died with what he loved so much. His death was very tragic to both friends and family but even they say if he was killed by a grizzly bear it would be the one way he would have liked to have gone.

The documentary is filled with hundreds of beautiful shots of landscape. Mountains, lakes, streams, grass fields, and forests show just what Timothy loved to do and film. He made friends with foxes as well as bears and had names for what seemed like 2 dozen different seperate animals. What amazes me is that he remember the names for each animal and didn't even once seem to mix them up. Thats how long he lived out in the wild.

The documentary cuts from different shots of Timothy and what he dealt with besides videotaping the grizzlies. From yelling up at god, or allah, or ""That floating Hindu thing"" as he called it for a rainstorm to come so the salmon could swim upstream and the bears could eat, to watching people actually have the nerve to throw rocks at bears as they came to close as he hid in the bushes nearby.

A lot of different people who knew Timothy talked about how they knew Timothy and what they thought about what he did and how he died. While some say he actually got what he deserved [I personally disagree] to others who say he hated civillization compared to life in the wild, everyone seemed to agree that Timothy loved what he was doing and that he would never hurt a Grizzly bear on purpose.

The story is very gripping and just watching how Timothy talks about the bears and how he manages to approach them almost to where he could reach out and touch them is fascinating enough.

This is one documentary that you need to see for many reasons; for the scenery, for the footage of the great bears and foxes, to seeing friends and family spread the ashes of Timothy in a emotional scene, this is definately worth checking out.",1135641600,5,2286,4.418052256532066

This is a great movie that just begs to be discussed, analyzed, mulled over. I differ from many reviewers who are hellbent on romanticizing or making poetic Timothy Treadwell's life. Or death-by-bear-attack, as the case may be. I saw Mr. Treadwell as a poster child for untreated mental illness. His death, while probably predictable, was all the more tragic because his ""friends"" were caught up in mythologizing a young man who was in dire need of mental health intervention, evaluation and treatment. Narcissism was the least of his problems.

""Grizzly Man"" should inspire all of us to be better, more attentive friends to each other.",1135641600,6,872,5.048611111111111

Although we found the movie to be even more humorous than we expected, we also all agreed that the movie was one of the MOST profound we had ever seen in our lives. Believe me, it takes quite a bit for a film to impress a sense of awe in the minds of a bunch of teenagers who think they've seen it all. Buying this film is one of the best purchases you can make.

Did he help one single bear on any level?  Was it all about him? I'm not one to judge.  What I will say is, I doubt many of us could do what he did, and if we judge a man by his biggest mistakes, then we'd all live in glass houses with shattered windows (homerun Chippah).

I just want to judge the film a bit.  I love Herzog, but come on, not playing the tape after listening to it, telling the lady to burn it:  that's a moment ABOUT HERZOG, not treadwell, not the subject of the film, like he's taking some moral high ground when the same guy puts a 20 minute treatment of a clearly semi-deranged coroner holding the body parts of the victims.

8089172,4,B000BMY2NS,"The story of Timothy Treadwell has both horrified and fascinated me ever since I first learned of his fate.  An environmental activist who opted to live among Alaska's bears with no formal training and improper equipment -- and who ultimately lost his life to the very animals he swore to protect -- his story has both entranced and infuriated people around the world, from bear biologists to the park services to his friends and family.  Evidently director Werner Herzog thought the same, for he decided to tell this man's story in documentary form, using footage from Treadwell's own collection and interviews with those close to him and who responded to the scene of his death.  And while Treadwell will remain a controversial figure for years to come, Herzog has created a shocking yet revealing portrait of a love for nature that ultimately proved fatal.

Herzog narrates this film, telling the story of Treadwell's love for animals that eventually morphed into a fascination with the brown and grizzly bears of Alaska.  For fourteen years this self-taught environmentalist campaigned for protecting the bears from poachers and developers, spoke in classrooms, and spent summers living among the bears.  Despite the noble intentions, however, Herzog doesn't flinch away from the man's flaws -- he was paranoid (believing the government and tourists were out to get him), arrogant and egotistical (he ordered the women he brought along on his trips to stay out of the way of the camera because ""I'm supposed to be alone out here""), and at times seems borderline-delusional (claiming to have brought rain to save the bears and obsessed with handling a bear's poop).  And while those who know of Treadwell either defend his actions and his character or condemn him as reckless or ""retarded,"" it doesn't change one terrifying fact -- that Tim Treadwell and his girlfriend, Amy, were ultimately killed and partially eaten by one of the very bears Tim swore to protect in the fall of 2003.

This film is chilling yet beautiful to watch.  The footage captured of Alaska's beautiful wilderness is stunning, as well as the close shots of bears in their natural habitat foraging for food, fighting for dominance, and curiously investigating Treadwell's campsite.  Treadwell himself can seem charming in much of this footage, looking in awe at the bears and playing with a family of foxes... but the footage also captures his many flaws, revealing an ugly side to the supposedly kindly bear activist.  And hearing him go on about how he could easily be killed and ""I would die for these animals, I would die for these animals"" is even more chilling when you go into the film knowing his ultimate fate.

Much like Treadwell, this film is not without its faults.  It doesn't tell Tim's story in chronological order, which can make it tricky to follow if you're not paying attention.  And Herzog's accent can be a little hard to decipher at times, though I do like his thoughtful, non-hammy narration throughout.  The cinematography and the revealing look at Treadwell and those close to him mostly overcome these faults, though.

Also, this film makes a good call in not playing the audio of Timothy Treadwell's death, though there is a scene that shows Herzog listening to said audio and being appropriately horrified by it.  Including this audio in the film itself would not only have been utterly horrifying, it would have been tasteless to the extreme as well.  Perhaps Tim and Amy brought their deaths on themselves by knowingly trespassing in bear country without proper precautions, but they still deserve some respect in death.

A fascinating and quietly horrifying film, this is worth watching whether or not you agree with Treadwell's actions and mission.  He was a complex and deeply flawed man, and this film doesn't shy away from his ugly side... but his story is still remarkable, if a dire warning to respect wild things in their own habitat.",1520294400,,3949,4.972644376899696

Anyone who thinks that, without formal training (or common sense), it's smart to trust a predator that is much bigger, stronger and faster than he is will eventually find out that he's been an annoyance that the bears put up with.  It was only a matter of time until one of them decided he'd be a better meal. I put Timothy Treadwell in the same group with ignorant children that decide to try mountain climbing in spring fashion wear and inevitably need to be rescued, thus wasting (stealing?) the time and resources of the rescuers.
