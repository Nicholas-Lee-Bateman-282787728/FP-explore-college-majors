5616626,4,B00BGI05Y6,"i am STILL warming up to this series but i must confess i like it better than expected.  first off, i am 64 so it is a stretch for me to tune in to this generation of twenty somethings. if you had asked me when i was this age if i thought young, educated women in new york city would be like this in 2013, i would have said no.  thus, it has been a real eye opener to see how much of their time and effort goes into abyssmal love affairs. one friend was actually married and we got to see the marriage implode over one dinner with his parents.

the aspect of this show receiving the most online coverage is Hannah's continually exhibiting her nude body over the season, when her body is far from being the american ideal. in fact, anorexia remains a real danger for young women in this age group so all the more wonder at this daring and bold aspect. i applaud the show for pursuing this angle.

another compelling aspect is that we see hannah have a complete remission into her OCD psychiatric condition. i have a family member with this condition.  the show is spot on with its exposition of OCD. again, i applaud the show for going where no one has gone before.

my only complaint is that two seasons in, i still don't really care much for the characters as people. this could be due to the disparity in our ages though.  a younger viewer might have a different reaction.

i just checked the status of the show over on METACRITIC and the reviews are coming in much lower than for the first season, both critical and user reviews. They don't feel this achieved the promise of the first season. I really do not see any difference between the two seasons. So I like season one less but season two more than METACRITIC.  METACRITIC draws on reviews from all over the web plus tallies user reviews as well.

all in all this is a well written show which takes on aspects which have previously been untouched by prime time tv.

5616642,1,B00BGI05Y6,"I really wanted to like this series. I usually like scripted comedies like Friends and Will and Grace. I was probably the only hetero male who watched Gossip Girl. However, I simply didn't like this series.

Hannah is an annoying character. She is childish and impetuous. She will sleep with a random guy she knew for 10 minutes. In season 2, she dated a token black guy for the first 2 episodes in order to assuage black viewers. She made some racist comments at the end of the second episode. Besides that, she got mad at Marnie for sleeping with her friend Elijah, even though Elijah is gay. I didn't understand that. And in every episode, Hannah is nude. I don't mind seeing nude women, as long as the woman is attractive. Hannah looks like a 12 year old boy.

A subplot of the season was Jessa getting dumped by her sugar daddy. Out of all of the characters, Marnie is the only one I like. Hannah's constant whining and opening her legs to the first guy she sees, including a junkie, turned me off. By the 5th episode of the season, I got sick of it.",1439683200,,1055,4.350253807106599

5616665,1,B00BGI05Y6,"What began as a comical series has now turned into a showcase of Lena Dunham's attempt to force herself on the audience. The storyline, once rich with supporting characters, now focuses on Dunham and her attempt to make you ""see"" her. It seems like she is using the show to ""get back"" at all of those who doubted her and made fun of her during her development. While I would never condone anyone shaming or bullying another, I'm not so sure Dunham should use this show to address the issue. Overall: this show gets worse the more you watch it.",1423267200,,543,4.44

These girls are filled with drama they create themselves, demonstrate that they do not understand friendships, and make you doubt if they will pull themselves together.  All the while, it is hysterical to watch them screw up their lives. Girls is supposed to be satirical, those that get that will enjoy the show immensely.",1397520000,3,514,4.829545454545454

5616691,5,B00BGI05Y6,"Even though I'm in my early 60s now, I recall all too well being this age and stage in life as these GIRLS. Although they're just out of college and living in NYC, and I was fresh out of a bad marriage, single mom of a 6 year old son and living in Southern California, many of the issues- men, jobs, apartments, friends and family are universal. I love the rawness, honesty, humor and self deprecating nature of the show, and everyone on it is extremely talented and perfectly cast. It's like being a fly on the wall and reliving many of the cringe-worthy, sad and lonely, silly, agonizingly frustrating and touchingly sweet times. I hope it's on for many years so we can all watch more real-life unfold.",1395014400,5,704,4.465116279069767

5616709,5,B00BGI05Y6,"OK - I have seen like 6 or 7 episodes.  I wanna buy the 2 seasons.  When did I see the episodes?  A couple weeks ago, when HBO had a freeview, when it was the debut of season 3 - I watched both those episodes, plus the older episodes they were showing - I saw like 7 episodes in one night.  I became a fan of Lena when I was watching the Golden Globes and she won those awards a year or two back.  I seriously have no idea why - I just thought she was cute, had the tatts - and I just instantly liked her....she's down to earth.  Just got that vibe in the first 5 seconds I saw her.  That said - I remember the first episode I watched...2 weeks ago.  My first Stephen King novel was Gerald's Game, the first Seinfeld episode I saw was the one where they lost the car in the parking garage and Elaine's fish died....Girls?  It was the one where she went up to that guy about the garbage or whatever and stayed at his place and they kept having sex - and she was naked a lot (thank you Lena)  But I liked that episode - it was weird.  Then I just kept watching the other episodes and the new ones.  That all said boils down to this - Lena is a cutie and very smart, the show is realistic, depressing, and I like that..because the world is depressing.  I hate shows that are fake and make the world seem so great.  Lena tells it like it is, and I respect that.  Shows humanity, blemishes and all.  And Lena is brave, not just for showing her body, which I happen to like, but also her soul, which I like and find attractive also.  Love you Lena!",1390348800,,1542,3.9869281045751634

5616717,4,B00BGI05Y6,"I found the first season charming, funny and  wickedly offbeat. The second season offers more of this, but then, in later episodes, starts to veer towards something much darker as the principal characters grapple with core uncertainties and anxieties in their lives, and not always successfully - anything but in some instances. Honestly, it's painful to watch at times because we care about these characters. But that's what makes the show so rewarding. It may be a comedy series, however, its general tone overall seems to be approaching a fugue state. I'm not sure I've seen anything like this before, but I find it intriguing. And I trust Denham's instincts as to where she wants to take the show. She's doing some remarkable work. And Zosia Mamet absolutely cracks me up. What a gifted little comic actress she is!",1387584000,,819,4.892086330935252
5616718,5,B00BGI05Y6,"A+ for casting.  Great show, I am hooked.  Sent this to a friend who has sparse television habits, and he loved it.  Can't wait for next season.  It is a 2012 version of Sex In The City without all the glamour.  Perhaps this is how the characters, in Sex In The City, started out when they first arrived to NYC.",1387497600,,311,4.116666666666666

5616720,5,B00BGI05Y6,Loved the first & second season.  The voicemail that Hannah leaves for Jesse in the last episode has to be the BEST voicemail ever!  It's a great show and I can't wait for season 3!!!!!,1386460800,,185,4.257142857142857
5616721,3,B00BGI05Y6,"Urgh. It's hard to justify this series sometimes.

""Girls"" season 1 was fantastic at capturing the underbelly insecurities of the up-and-coming millennial generation. However, not many viewers understood how big of an asterisk this show needed by its claim as ""a voice of a generation."" The characters are extremes of 20-somethings that need to chill out and find a job like every other sane person. Put on display for all to stereotype an entire group of youngins is whiny Hannah Horvath (Dunham) and her motley gang of screw-ups.

In season 2, we have more of the same. Every character is very much an underdog, but the amount of self-inflicted suffering is debatable. The number of cringe-worthy scenes increases, but the point of much of the struggles each character faces is skewed.

It's interesting to see Lena Dunham's unique style of writing and directing evolve. At the end of each episode this time around, she keeps viewers on edge and interested enough to see what happens next via clear character connections. A far-cry from season 1's almost haunting endings that left viewers with an unclear taste for more, season 2 is plot-driven and mature in its progression. Characters are deeper (still shallow in nature, but we see more rationale, thank God) and interactions drive season 2 forward more than its unique perspective.

Dunham is pushing forward, but this is definitely her sophomore slump. By the end of season 2, her main character just seems pathetic, her friends are all over the place emotionally, physically and mentally, and I'm left with a feeling of ""What just happened?"" While this goes back to the overall feeling of season 1, I would have hoped that the progression element of season 2 would carry throughout the series.

It's hard judge any particular season of ""Girls"" as a stand-alone product. At this point, I'm just hoping season 3 gives season 2 some validation, because, on its own, season 2 is lukewarm at best.",1385769600,4,1951,4.954128440366972
5616722,1,B00BGI05Y6,This is a horrible series the main character goes on debasing herself getting naked and having sex with a man that shows no interest in feelings whatsoever. Her friends are the same as her. Her best friend shows no interest in her feelings either. This may get women angry but it has nothing of interest for any straight man. The main character is whiney unattractive and is the only one who shows her naked body.,1384819200,2,413,4.52
5616723,5,B00BGI05Y6,I ordered this without seeing it on HBO first. Heard great things about this show. Wasn't disappointed at all. Only wish there was more bonus features. Arrived fast too.,1384732800,,169,4.862068965517241

5616725,3,B00BGI05Y6,"""Girls"" season two has lost a lot of the raw energy and adolescent amorality that made the first season such a guilty pleasure to watch.  Lena Dunham no longer writes most episodes, and the new writers have introduced a tortured morality to a series that has no place for it.  In two of season two's most boring episodes, Jessa goes back home and discovers yet again her irresponsible father has not become so and Hannah spends a day having amazing sex with Patrick Wilson and realizes she really enjoys having sex with Patrick Wilson and hates herself for it.",1383609600,,560,4.646464646464646
5616736,2,B00BGI05Y6,"Season 1 hooked me, but now that I finished disc 1 of 2 of Season 2, I barely want to finish the rest of it. More nudity (in not a sexy way), and I found myself wanting to turn it off completely on more than one occasion.

Save yourself the $ and rent it, or borrow it, or don't watch it at all. Or I'll just send it to you.",1383091200,12,324,3.6285714285714286
5616737,3,B00BGI05Y6,"Just finished Season 2, feeling relieved that it was finally over. I'm not sure exactly what Lena Dunham was trying to accomplish, so maybe she achieved exactly what she wanted. I found the show depressing, and faintly nauseating. Maybe that's the ""real life"" coming through. Whatever Lena's intention, I found the Hannah character the most infuriating. Maybe that is because she reminds me of my own daughter. The constant dodge of responsibility, and the incessant escalation of ""making it about her"" as a self-sabotaging diversion the more she was faced with actually doing something substantive.
Regarding Lena's nudity: Nudity is all well and good, but she reminds me of the Pillsbury doughboy. I don't enjoy looking at it, but whatever, that's her body. What bothered me more was her writing herself into sex scenes where hunky guys find her beautiful. She had her cute moments, and maybe some guys would find that beautiful, but *ALL* of them?
Speaking of the guys, Adam was by far the most original and interesting character. Maybe most ""real life"" people are boring, and so the characters also had to be? I wish the script had explored and developed the Jessa character in more depth. It was more complex than the other girls'. The ""her father"" episode attempted this, with limited success.
The fact I that I have this much to say about the show indicates it was art, even if the kind that makes you uncomfortable to witness. That gets it 3 stars instead of 2.",1382745600,2,1469,4.833333333333333

5616739,5,B00BGI05Y6,"Not for everyone, but I'm not everyone, SO....  Lena Dunham's perspective is skewed, sometimes juvenile, always honest, and sometimes abrasive.

It's just that, during the first season, the girls seemed to blunder through their lives and their mistakes with a sort of derring-do and in high spirits whereas, in season two, their lives seemed, frankly, depressing almost across the board. Still, each episode hung together, the writing, acting, and cinematography was first rate and, as before, each half-hour episode seemed to draw to a close very quickly, for me, at least, a clear sign that I'm watching something that is captivating and has held my interest.",1380758400,,726,4.862903225806452

-Jessa's father, totally unnecessary character
-Hannah and the doctor... worst episode ever. So random and pointless.
-Ruined booth's character. Wish it had dragged out longer, wish he remained mysterious and a tease.
-Hannah became annoying and unlikable. Her OCD and the ear situation played out like a weird soap opera.
-Excessive drug use. Hannah doing coke was way too much for her character, would've been better if Marnie tried it.

And like the girls in this fantastic series, I am wiped out!!  Spent!!  Wasted!!
Yes, they all have problems, quirks, idiosyncrasies, neuroses.....call them what you will......but who doesn't??
I'm 69, a white heterosexual male, and I can't find anything wrong about this show!!
Too much foul mouth?
Too much sex and nudity?
Too much whining?
No, none of the above.
They're part of life, and LIFE is what ""Girls"" is about, even if just a wee tad exaggerated!
Was the 2nd season better?  Or worse?
Neither.  Just different!
Do I have favorite characters or episodes??
Of course.
Obviously, as the writer/director/actor etc, ""Hannah"" stands out.
But so do all the others, at various times.
In the 2nd season, I think I liked Episode 5 (""One Man's Trash"") the best.
Would like to see how, or if, that relationship develops.
Also would love to see more of ""Jessa"".
There's drama, comedy, joy, sadness, love....and hate!
We've been there and done that (if you're honest!!), and that's why we LOVE ""Girls""!!

5616749,4,B00BGI05Y6,"As the cliche goes, if you're a fan of the show, you'll like this season. Without giving details on the plot,the story-lines continue, following the same core group of 4 girls as they navigate through young adulthood. There seems to be a lot more sex and skin bearing than season 1, but maybe that is one of the themes? A couple of storylines are dull and far fetched like Hannah dealing with ADHD, and the token black guy shunted into the script to address critics. There are a few new characters added to spice up the mix.
What is new and makes the DVD/Blu-ray worth owning are the 5 minute commentaries by Lena Dunham that give insight into the episodes that you might be missed. Lena's persona behind the camera is assertive, passionate and genuine; the polar opposite of her ditsy character Hannah. In one of the features she confesses she wishes she had edited out an unflattering scene - she suffers for her craft I guess.
In summary, season 2 keeps the story going.",1379376000,,973,4.565714285714286

Lena Dunham is not afraid to take any of these risks and pulls them off with flying colors. What results is a deceptively unique show that, year by year, is proving to be a true touchstone in modern American television. Nevermind the haters, in this day and age anything remotely popular invites backlash from a large number of the population. In this case, all the praise this show gets is completely warranted.

5616766,3,B00BGI05Y6,"I loved the first season. I loved the first half of the second season, especially the episode where Hanna takes up with the doctor she meets over trash, one of the most gracefully understated and affecting things I've ever watched. But the second half of the second season is all over the map of abandonment and, I hate to say it (cringe!), often impausible and unsatisfying even for me, a true believer. I just find it unrealistic that Hanna, with her profound self-awareness, would intentionally puncture her eardrums even if she has OCD, but I guess I'm naive.  And Marnie's boyfriend Charlie: Wasn't he unemployed last season? Now he's phone app millionaire? And Adam's beautiful, sophisticated new girlfriend who seems entirely normal: Would someone like that really allow her recovering alcoholic mother to fix her up with a guy she meets after his outburst at an AA meeting? Especially when he looks, in the words of the minor character played by Amy Schumer, like ""an old-timey criminal""? Suspension of disbelief is something we do when we watch TV or movies.

5616767,2,B00BGI05Y6,"I really enjoyed the first season where the quirky characters delivered some great, cringe-worthy lines, and some parts were laugh-out loud funny. What happened in S2?

Like life imitating art, the writing just doesn't come together. Every one of the main characters becomes annoying  and whiney, and you have no sympathy or support for any of them, with the exception of Charlie, played by Christopher Abbot. The fact that this actor has left the show abruptly at pre-production of S3 as he was unhappy with the direction the show was taking, speaks VOLUMES on how trite this season is compared to season 1.

Each episode seems like improvisation and there is only a loose thread of a storyline throughout, making each episode almost standalone, with cameos from people who are complete caricatures delivery nothing but cheesy lines.

I really hope S3 resembles S1 more, as I would drop this show if S2 is the new vein. It is borderline depressing and really has no message any more.

2 stars for the guys who are probably the most watchable. Incidentally, after Christopher Abbots departure, Lena has said the show does not need the guys to make it work. How wrong she is.....",1378684800,,1178,4.840796019900497

The build up for the 2nd season had taken too long. It actually did not get good until the 2nd disc.  I was so disappointed because I felt I had wasted my money at first. Once I popped in the 2nd disc I was so happy and live into it.  The only thing I have to say is watch the whole thing and you would like it.

5616770,3,B00BGI05Y6,"I've been addicted to ""Girls"" ever since the first season, yet I hate all of the characters SO,SO,MUCH! There have been many times where I want to just scream at the t.v. after one of them does something especially stupid. These girls are young and have everything in the world going for them; how in the hell are they so bad at life?! However, I have to say that it speaks very well of the actors' talents if their roles can bring such a strong response from a viewer. This season seemed to fall a bit short of season one. The drama is a little grittier,but it doesn't have the same innocence. This time around,the girls are considerably more self absorbed, promiscuous, and not concerned with anything but their own wants and needs- making them very unlikeable and irritating. Shoshanna's character in particular is exceptionally annoying. She's basically a 12-year old in the body of a 21-year old Valley Girl with very unrealistic expectations of relationships, love,and life in general. Hannah has gone from loveable flake to complete trainwreck, and feels the need to show us her naked body whenever possible. It's great that Lena Dunham is that comfortable with her physical image and all, but I personally don't want to see it. What I do like about this show is that it stays fairly true to real life. Bad decisions and mistakes are not just forgiven and swept under the rug in a neat 30 minute episode,but rather,shown as lasting consequenses in the forms of STD's,terminated friendships,evictions and such- just as would happen in reality. Let's just say I definitely feel better about myself after watching!",1376611200,4,1618,4.844765342960288
5616771,3,B00BGI05Y6,"I started watching Girls this season and quickly watched both seasons in a matter of weeks. My problems about the first season were all but eradicated in the second season although maybe not for the best. The first season I found uncomfortable to watch. As a 20 something facing similar problems and situations (albeit not in New York) I found the show very real and almost too approachable. The characters are self indulgent to the point of irritability and never reach the self actualization they could have if they stopped to think about any other person but themselves. That isn't a critique as much as it is a failing of all 20 somethings who think their lives are SO hard despite daddy footing the bill for everything.

Th second season was a little bit more scripted in th sense that the characters didn't get into real world situations so much as they got into hyberbolic versions of real world situations. One character's desire to experience life so that she can write about it leads to a hysterical cocaine binge leading up to a confrontation between friends.

One thing I think the show does so well is examine relationships between friends. These aren't Charlotte, Samantha, Miranda and Carrie. These are girls who are much more petty and at the end you don't know if they are goin to be friends again which is much more realistic. Despite these forays into the real life introspective nuances o the 20 something, the show provides enertainment value. Some episodes are better than others so you may want to be careful about buying every episode some of which include mental illness and terrifying visions of what exactly can go wrong when all you think about is yourself.

One problem I have with the show is that these girls, well educated and full of potential to do it on their own, constantly find themselves revolving around a male figure. Marnie and Charlie, Hannah and Adam...the only character with a semblance of self actualization is Shosh who, despite her moments of clarity, still only gets thees moments because she longs to be treated one way and finds that she is actually the caregiver and its not the the way around.

Other than these problems the show is at times humorous and is always witty. The ending will leave you in a loop as you find yourself thinking...what can these girls possibly do to make it worse on themselves? I'm guessing a lot more.",1365724800,16,2383,4.721153846153846
5616772,2,B00BGI05Y6,"To preface this review, I loved the first season of Girls and own it on DVD.  I'm glad I bought it because for me, many of the episodes continue to be enjoyable to watch even after the second or third viewing.  I'm not sure I'm feeling the same way about the second season, to me it kind of felt like it hit a sophomore slump.  For starters, in the second season it felt like they were trying too hard to push the boundaries and make the characters and the story lines.  I realize that often gives a show more critical acclaim, but for me it negatively impacted my enjoyment of the show.  For starters, it meant that some of the characters felt a lot less relatable since they were being put in situations that aren't necessarily as universal among twenty-somethings.  It also made for some very cringeworthy moments were I was almost tempted to fast forward through the episode or simply skip to the next one.  To me this makes the show less worthy of purchasing because many of the episodes I have no desire to see a second or a third time, unlike how I felt about the first season.  And in general (and like much of my criticism this is highly subjective) the self-centered actions and lack of self-awareness of the main characters just wasn't as funny this season.  Last season I didn't mind these qualities in the characters because it often made for good laughs.  This season with the exception of Marnie's vocal stylings (which I think was perfect acting on her part as well as the extras in the scene) I wasn't feeling it that much.  I'm not sure if it was because the writing or acting was off or whether the personalities of these characters become grating quickly.

Overall, (and I never thought I would say this after I gushed over the first season) there didn't seem to be as much to love.  I think if you enjoyed the first season it's certainly worth watching once, but I'm not sure it's something I want to own and watch more than once.",1365033600,12,1951,4.446629213483146
5616773,3,B00BGI05Y6,"After watching both seasons, I can say the show is completely preposterous.  In 20 episodes I watched Hannah sleep with at least 6 different guys. I don't see how showing graphic sex scenes in every episode is instrumental to the plot.  Lacking any passion or emotion, the scenes are ridiculous and awful to watch. The characters on the show are not very likeable.  Hannah and Jessa have moments when you could possibly care what happens to them, which is the reason I watched both seasons.  As for the other characters, forget them.  Marnie is so selfish, I truly wish bad things for her.  Shoshanna is just plain annoying.  It's like she never left middle school.  I'm giving the show 3 generous stars because it has humorous moments and I think it has promise.  But those gross sex scenes have got to go.",1364774400,7,807,4.626760563380282

They sleep around but are all looking for a special someone.  I've been anxiously awaiting the second season because I am so hooked!  Great acting, brilliant stories, an all around success!

5616775,3,B00BGI05Y6,"Overall, Season 2 of ""Girls"" was pretty lackluster. There are a few good episodes (Hannah trying cocaine, Hannah hooking up with a guy twice her age), but other than that, it was all kind of lame. My biggest issues have to do with Lena Dunham's obsession with her own nakedness. Yes, we get that you are comfortable in your plus-size body...good for you. But Hannah gets naked on this show ALL THE TIME, so much so that it starts to take away from the rest of the plot. Cover yourself, already! And I also thought Hannah became more annoying than ever by the end of the season, and I'm not liking the whole OCD storyline for her character. Also, with the exception of Jessa, I really started hating on the other main characters even more than before this season. Shoshanna is so annoying in every possible way, and Marnie is so self-absorbed and nasty. (I wasn't happy with what happened between her and Charlie in the final episode...I hope she gets what she deserves in Season 3.) Truthfully, none of these characters are very likeable at all, and I am not sure if I'll continue watching the show. If Hannah buys some pants that actually fit her, and actually keeps them on for 30 minutes straight, I might consider it.",1364169600,7,1221,4.554545454545455
