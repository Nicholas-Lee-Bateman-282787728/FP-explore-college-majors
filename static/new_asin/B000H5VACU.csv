2627860,5,B000H5VACU,"Best In Show, The Festival, and now The Tournament.

Great black comedy ""mockumentary"" style show that also has a touch of heart.

I too love hockey.  But that has no basis on my love for this show.  You could no nothing about the sport and still love this show.

Check it out.  When I bought it for $17.99, I thought it was a misprint.  Great deal for over 6 hours of the best comedy you'll find on Amazon.",1173052800,5,407,4.141025641025641
2627861,5,B000H5VACU,"Here's some backstory as to when the show first aired, followed by some stuff about the show...

In late 2004, the CBC network saw the writing on the wall and pretty much knew the NHL wouldn't be playing a season in 2004-05.  The World Cup of Hockey took place in September of 2004, which ended up being the last time NHL players would be playing nationally televised hockey for a year.

Though not having hockey really would only take away the CBC's programming for Saturday nights and evenings from April to June, I'm sure they knew the Canadian masses would be starved for anything hockey-related.

Their answers?  One was Making the Cut, an open Canada-wide tryout with the ultimate prize being six NHL training camp invitations, one each for the six Canadian NHL teams.

The other?  The Tournament.  Both Making the Cut and The Tournament aired in primetime on (I think) Monday nights.  (Unrelated, the CBC was heavily promoting the new version of Doctor Who at the time.)

The main character of The Tournament is hockey-crazed dad Barry McConnell, who will stop at nothing to get his 10-year-old son Robbie on his way to the NHL.  Long story short, Barry's trying to live his dream through his son.  Needless to say, Barry has some run-ins with wife Janice as well as just about everybody, from the coach of the team to the officials to his boss at work to the team sponsors, the Farquesons, who have their own hilarious foul-mouthed goalie of a tomboy daughter by the name of Denim.  Perhaps most hilarious are Barry's tussles with Mohindar Singh, the (East) Indian gyno who doubles as team trainer and father of another of Robbie's teammates, Kumar (or K-Mart, as Barry half-intentionally calls him).  Also featured is fresh divorcee Deb Pishatelli, a friend of Janice's and mother of Robbie's teammate, Anthony.  Let's not forget the Frenchman coach Barry tries to impress late in the season.

The characters are hilarious and the whole show just seems real sharp, and there seems to be a constant chaotic/haywire feeling to it, so I could see how people could say it's a relative to Arrested Development.

If the only thing I knew about the show was that it involved a kids' hockey team, their parents, and the fact that the team was named the Farqueson Funeral Home Warriors, that'd be enough for me to buy the DVDs.  Hooray for living near the Canadian border with a stateside cable provider that carried the CBC.",1166572800,24,2425,4.760765550239235
2627862,5,B000H5VACU,"I saw the first season of this show on OLN(now Versus) during the playoffs last year and found it hilarious.  having grown up in youth hockey some of the events that they touched on actually happened to me (the adult video in the hotel room to name one).  Quite an amusing look into what happens when the parents take the game way more seriously then the kids (which is somewhat common these days).

The actual menus are pretty well done and the show is much better watched as a season sans commercials.

I'd recommend it to anyone who likes hockey, has ever been to a youth hockey game, fans of other mocumentary shows(ie the Office, Arrested Developement, etc), or really anyone interested in watching an entertaining mocumentary style TV show .",1163635200,14,747,4.679389312977099
2627873,4,B000H5VACU,"Ving Rhames is by no means an Oscar winning character or even nod on a good day.  In The Tournament, a rehash of any and all 'fight til the death and only one man (or woman) can win' movie, Rhames plays Joshua Harlow, the reigning assassin champion and nearly odds-even favorite.

A mysterious ""someone"" puts a hit on Harlow's wife which eventually lures him into The Tournament again.  He was there for vengeance.  Only, who did it?  Enter Lai Lai Zhen (Kelly Hu -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X-men-2-Blu-ray/dp/B001PPGAJY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X-men 2 [Blu-ray</a>],&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Scorpion-King/dp/B0019IGNRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Scorpion King</a>), the baddest of the bad ass women.

The rest of this movie is a cat and mouse game of hide and seek, ah, make that ""Hide and kill"" with Harlow and Zhen down to the last to finalists.  This movie will keep your attention while watching it but as soon as it's over pretty much any impact it had made on your will dissipate leaving nothing but a warm and fuzzy feeling of being entertained and a loss of 90 minutes.

I was actually pleasantly surprised by how entertained I was. Yes, it's full of gratuitous violence and gore, but as a fan of ""The Walking Dead,"" this didn't bother me at all. As always, Robert Carlyle was great -- he plays a hapless priest who gets drawn into the ""game"" unwittingly, and he adds a whole other layer to the story. Kelly Hu was also good, and Ving Rhames is ALWAYS great. So if you don't mind blood and a bit of gore or the F-word, you might be surprised by this movie!",1426032000,,625,4.216666666666667

Story in a nutshell....but the actors make the difference in this movie. Ving Rhames and Kelly Hu are terrific and Robert Carlyle as the drunken priest who accidentally becomes involved is good too. Ian Somerhalder has a small part as a nutjob killer and he is a stand out in that small bit. Don't expect an academy award nominated movie just sit back and have some sun...gory and gritty.

Pre-screen before watching with your kids, however.  There's a touch of profanity in the first season (nothing terrible, but that's my subjective opinion).  The second season contains a dose of adult subject that many would likely find unsuitable for kids under 12 (and maybe even older).

If you live in Minnesota and your kids play (or played) association hockey, you'll LOVE the protagonist's plan to extend his house into the neighboring township to gain residency through a construction project he calls, ""The long house.""",1366243200,,667,5.196261682242991

2627957,1,B000H5VACU,"This film while having a pretty basic premise, lacks any internal logic which makes it difficult to suspend one's disbelief. Ok, let's say that the world's greatest assassins do meet up in a random town every seven years for a battle royal to see who is number one. The character's have no motivation for doing so for the most part with the exception of Ving Rhames. It's the little details that I can't let go of... the french assassin cuts out his tracking device (which is conveniently placed where he can reach it) and drops it in Robert Carlyle's coffee. Carlye manages to swallow the bullet sized capsule without a problem. And this little device contains enough explosive to blow several individuals into tiny bits. For professional killers they don't seem very good at their jobs. And if Kelly Hu is so racked with guilt for killing a woman who ""didn't see it coming"", about not killing innocents, she has no problem with hijacking a bus full of innocent bystanders when there is no good reason for doing so.",1359504000,,1016,4.681564245810056

But that being said, this movie was good and remained interesting throughout.  As with most action movies, not everything is 100% believable or realistic.  Without giving it away, I'll just say the twist at the end made it all worth it!  I'd definitely recommend The Tournament.",1355788800,,420,4.777777777777778

Now, the game, hosted by Mr. Powers (Liam Cunningham), is about to begin in the city of Middlesbrough, England, and the last champion Joshua Harlow (Ving Rhames) will be back, but not for the money this time.

In the meanwhile, Father Joseph Macavoy (Robert Carlyle), alcoholic and losing his faith, swallows a tracking device of one killer joining the game, without his knowing. This means Father Macavoy also enters the game as a contestant (odds: 500/1), but can he survive the twenty-four hours, with a help from another contestant Lai Lai Zhen (Kelly Hu)?

I think you have heard this story before, and will again. It is ""The Most Dangerous Game"" or ""The Hunger Games"" or any other films in which characters are forced to join the life-or-death game. The success of the idea on screen depends on the storytelling skills, or the ""game"" and how it unfolds.

""The Tournament,"" a British independent film, has decent action sequences and some of them are creative, but the storyline needs improvement, being full of plot holes and contradictions. While one contestant is seen removing a ""tracking device"" implanted in his body, others don't even think about it. This kind of randomness tends to detract from tension.

Still, there are lots of nifty action set-pieces including Sebastien Foucan's exciting free running-style chase sequence that is the highlight of the film. Scott Adkins and Kelly Hu, beating and kicking each other, show what they can do in the film's brief but impressive martial arts action scenes. First-billed Robert Carlyle as a ""lost"" priest is not bad, but still less memorable than Kelly Hu, who delivers a solid performance in the non-action scenes.

""The Tournament"" proves once again that the time-honored concept of the most dangerous game has still potential, even though eighty years has passed since it was first made into film. The idea has been done before and better, but as to the film's action, it is better than average.",1348099200,2,2141,5.019718309859155

When Barry ran a 30-foot extension to have his house cross the county line so his son could play on a better team, I lost it.  Yes, hockey parents are a whole different breed.

The 1st yr focuses on a small Canadian town called Briarside, Ontario, and its Pee-Wee hockey team called the Farqueson Funeral Home Warriors.  They are gearing up for a big tournament in the city of Chateauguay, Quebec.  The hockey action is limited but we see a lot of antics by psycho hockey dad, Barry McConnell, who looks at Chateauguay as a stepping stone for his son Robbie on the way to the NHL.  We've all seen hockey parents from hell and boy do these characters imitate the craziness of youth hockey.

Don't believe this is art imitating life?  Go down to any amateur hockey rink in North America and see for yourself.  The second yr kinda dragged, as the plot got old.  But the first yr is a gem.  This is a very accurate reflection of hockey culture.  If you don't think it's funny, you're the one this movie is portraying.

Ving Rhames wins the one before the opening credits. He comes out of retirement because one of the assassins in the tournament murdered his wife. Some of the action is watched on closed circuit TV by rich people who make bets. Some of the characters are introduced by the emcee of the game. Tracking devices are surgically placed inside all the contestants, who can all track each other.

There isn't much in the way of developing characters. The premise is awful. However, if you like a fast paced movie with killing and exploding heads, this is the one. Now to make things interesting not every assassin plays by the same set of rules. Kelly Hu plays another favored assassin.

2627979,3,B000H5VACU,I think I expected more going into this movie. There are some decent fight sequences although I would like to have seen more of Scott Adkins character. I think the Priest hams it a bit. All in all a decent buy but nothing to write home about.,1318377600,,242,4.170212765957447
2627980,4,B000H5VACU,"The Tournament is one of those action films you've never heard of but is actually superior to the PG-13 trash that passes for Hollywood action these days (I'm looking at YOU, Die Hard 4). It barely got into cinemas for a week in October 2010 and you shouldn't let it slip away.

Robert Carlyle plays a washed-up priest who is caught up in a once-every-seven-years competition in which 30 of the world's best hitmen are pitted against each other in an unsuspecting, random town. The location this time is Middlesborough, England and the 24-hour bloodbath paints the town red before the climactic last-man-standing finale. Among the many hitmen are the gorgeous Kelly Hu and the burly Ving Rhames. There's not much time for character development, but the main trio work well off each other in between the brutal action scenes.

The Tournament does use some CGI blood effects in a few shots, not as awful as it usually is, but most of the gore is good, old-fashioned make-up. And when I said they paint the town red I really do mean it. The film is wonderfully gory in a way we just don't see in action movies anymore. Plus the stunts are all done for real in front of the camera, which makes it all the more visceral and visually appealing.

Don't write-off the Tournament. It delivers everything it promises. It doesn't rewrite the rules or set any new, genre-defining standard, but it's still better than modern, family-friendly 'action'.

The Blu Ray looks good in 1.78:1 1080p with DTS HD-MA sound. There are no extras.",1318118400,3,1521,4.728301886792453

2627983,3,B000H5VACU,"What does it say about a film that was shot in 2007 but not released until 2009...as a ""direct to DVD,"" no theater exposure?

The Tournament has a basic plot, 30 assassins enter a 24 hour contest for 10 million dollars: kill or die.  The movie starts at the end of one such Tournament then jumps to 7 years later and the start of a new Tournament in a ""random"" city.  Welcome!
The first obstacle this movie has to overcome is the unwieldy number of contestants plus the staff of the Tournament: pit boss, woman sidekick, and two dopey geeks manning the cameras that watch all the contestants as they battle to the death.  How do you concentrate on so many characters and have any of them standout?  You don't, as seen with a rushed ""killing montage"" that sped up the countdown towards the end.  There could have been 6 assassins or 14, 30 was an arbitrary number, you don't actually see everyone kill or die, you have to take it on faith that they do and soon enough it's down to the last two standing.
I will admit there were plenty of good fight sequences but they would keep slowing things down to yap now and then.  The pit boss (Liam Cunningham)  was a bit of nothing, his sidekick said and did little; the geeks were standard issue, straight from the box of stereotypes.  Only a few of the players were allowed enough screen time to establish some personality: the rooftop cheater (Sebastien Foucan), the giggly dog killer (Ian Somerhalder), baby-sitter/nurse maid (Kelly Hu) to a swearing priest (Robert Carlyle), and the plodding Ving Rhames as the returning champ.  Everyone else was simply fodder for the action sequences, which were spectacular and plentiful.  Still.  I was left with an empty feeling once it went through its foregone conclusion and the credits began to roll.  There wasn't anything special here that made me want to watch it again.  It was just okay.  And not a keeper.",1301097600,3,1899,4.6101190476190474
2627984,3,B000H5VACU,"I like going into a movie with no prior knowledge of it and no expectations. Sometimes I'll approach a movie and want to like to the point I don't see it's faults. I'm thankful that wasn't the case here. I knew nothing of this movie before I saw so I was able to sit back and let it happen. This is some pretty awful stuff.

Here's the scoop. There is a tournament held every so often by the ultra rich where the world's top assassins compete in an elimination event and attempt to be the last man standing. They are implanted with a tracking device so they can track each other and so some tech guys can activate various security cameras around the city to televise the event via closed circuit to a room full of big wigs betting on the outcome. Things get a stitch when a failed priest accidentally ingests one of the tracking devices that one of the assassins cut out of himself.

OK. Let's be honest. The entire concept of the movie is so over the top you can't even see the top from there. But if that's the case, then that's how you need to play it. That's not how it's played out. Throwing the bit in about the priest is trying to add some degree of heart and seriousness to it all and there isn't any room. You can't have your cake and eat it too. There is also the revenge aspect to the Ving Rhames character. Likewise, there is no room for it.

As for the tournament itself: It's ludicrous. Most of these guys and gals are buffoons. How they ever became the tops in there field is beyond me. Few of them seem to have the smarts, nerves or technical expertise to excel in this line of work. There is one scene set in a strip club that is so bad I nearly (nearly) turned it off.

The production values are surprisingly good. They managed to get a few high profile actors (how did Robert Carlyle end up in this mess?) The stunts and some (some) of the action scenes are choreographed and directed rather well. It's shot well, cut well and has decent music. But it doesn't even succeed on its own terms. If your filming a comic book, film a comic book. Don't try to make it into a real movie with real characters. It simply doesn't work.

I might be being kind in giving this 3 stars. There will be those out there that will love this movie for its kinetic prowess and clever stunts, but unless you're hopelessly addicted to action movies, I'd stay away from this debacle.",1298332800,,2378,4.275555555555556

I wasn't sure just what to expect with THE TOURNAMENT, I knew that it was an action flick, but with a European setting and semi-respectable stars like Robert Caryle and Ving Rhames, this could've been an art flick in a ninja assassin's clothes. Fortunatley, it is what the case promises and more, big guns, big action, martial arts and the very hot Kelly Hu. Hu's fight with scene Scott Adkins is worth the purchase or rental alone, his MMA style against her Hu fu is pure gold. The story is so absured that it is charming and dose not require any thought at all, it's the kinda thing you just have to go with.

2628000,5,B000H5VACU,"What is a trashy movie?  Well in my mind, it is a movie that has a very basic story usually a violent one and doesn't have the really big computer special effects.  These movies have second tier actors, ones that have been second leads in major movies.  These types of movies are the ones that sports figures make their debut in.  Editing and Lighting are fair and the locals are usually some Asian country.  These movies, most of the time, go directly to video, or maybe to the SyFy channel on Saturday night.

Now The Tournament meets most of these reguirements, but time and money were spent to make it something else, in this case a high end trashy movie.  The story of a game for killers to kill each other is long in the tooth and has been seen in several low budget movies.  Here however the writer adds somethings that are different.  A priest is added to the killing spree when one of the baddies gets the inspired idea to cut out the tracking device and have the Priest ingest it.  There are two center pieces of action, the strip club and the car chase.  The strip club shoot out  rivals the bar shoot out in Desperado.  The car chase was not what I was expecting in this type of film. It was exciting, a double decker bus and semi truck.

The ending was interesting in the respect that I really thought the the husband would get his revenge. The way that the real bad guy died was gory and ""neat.""

2628001,4,B000H5VACU,"Hitmen have been a marvelously convenient tool for screenwriters.  Because of their unusual occupation, they have often been used to solve problems.  In the case of director Scott Mann's thriller The Tournament (2009), hitmen are the major players, as thirty of the best in the biz, are competing to the death, for a ten million dollar prize.

Hosted by a fellow named Powers (Liam Cunningham), the contest takes place every seven years, and runs for 24 hours.  Tracked by cameras, betters watch the action, and wager big money on the outcome.  The location is in Great Britain, where each contestant has a tracking device implanted in their abdomen, set to explode when the 24 hour period is over.

With the conflict spilling out on to the streets, the field quickly narrows from thirty, to just a handful of competitors.  Joshua Harlow (Ving Rhames), the winner of the last competition has entered again, after learning that one of the entrants murdered his wife.  Not much is revealed about the other players.  Lai Lai Zen (Kelly Hu) is one of those favored to win, but she gets tangled up trying to protect Father McAvoy (Robert Carlyle), a priest who unwittingly becomes part of the game.  Having removed his tracking device, assassin Anton Bogart (Sebastien Foucan) is a dangerous wild card.  While psychotic Texan Miles Slade (Ian Somerhalder) has a flair for the dramatic, and for collecting souvenirs from the kill.

The inclusion of the alcoholic McAvoy, and his relationship with Lai Lai Zen, introduces the concept of redemption, and keeps the contest from being a pure shoot out.  Harlow's burning drive for revenge, provides fuel that drives the film, which has some mean action sequences, plenty of gunplay, bloody carnage, creative fight sequences, and way too many vehicles turning over.  Hu and Foucan shine in several demanding fight scenes.

The Tournament is a straightforward comic book action feature that mostly delivers.  Those expecting a furious battle royal with dozens of combatants, may be slightly disappointed, as the scale isn't quite that grand.  A wild shootout in a strip club, comes the closest to a war zone, with a totally loony Slade blasting everything in sight.  There are some tinges of dark humor, but the tone is mostly solemn and serious.  With Carlyle, Somerhalder, Hu, and Rhames providing solid performances, the acting is fairly good for a film of this type.

Against all technical and monetary odds, they strive to put on a good show for folks who are willing to take a chance beyond mainstream movie mulch. Finally, finally, finally, however, we have a low budget film that's legitimately capable of going toe-to-toe with Hollywood productions and beating them at their own game while showing up their deficiencies. ""The Tournament"" - the feature-length debut of TV and short film director Scott Mann - is easily the best action flick to be released DTV since the likes of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Undisputed-II-Last-Man-Standing/dp/B000K7UC2Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Undisputed II - Last Man Standing</a>: not only is it packing more gunfights, martial arts fisticuffs, and car chases than the average big-budget picture, but its high production values guarantee that it's not going to alienate people who shy away from movies that aren't 100% glossy and streamlined.

The story: every decade, powerful businessmen congregate to organize and gamble to the tide of 'the Tournament' - a no-holds-barred battle royal pitting the world's most dangerous assassins against eachother. In the midst of this, a troubled, alcoholic priest (Robert Carlyle,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Full-Monty/dp/6305622914/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Full Monty</a>) is mistakenly entered as a contestant; his only hope for survival rests with the efforts of a former Triad hitwoman (Kelly Hu,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/X2/dp/B000AYELVU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">X2</a>) trying to atone for her past. In their way are 29 of the killing world's elite, including a vengeful returning champion (Ving Rhames,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pulp-Fiction/dp/1558908242/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pulp Fiction</a>) and a sadistic rookie entry (Ian Somerhalder, ""Lost"").

Almost as significant as the shot in the arm it gives to the DTV genre is how adeptly this film turns Kelly Hu into an action heroine. Whether you're not really a fan of her or agree with me that she's had it coming for way too long, she proves herself more than capable in here, not just by way of attitude, but also via her impressive physical abilities, best highlighted in a fantastic hand-to-hand fight with the awesome Scott Adkins (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ninja/dp/B002XTBE5Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ninja</a>). Of course, she's not the only one who steals the show: Sebastien Foucan, who was introduced to the world by way of his jaw-dropping parkour episode in ""Casino Royale"", returns to the screen after a three-year absence to reestablish his talents in some thoroughly satisfying free running exhibitions. Frequent shootouts incorporating nearly the entire cast might be considered less original than anything choreographed by John Woo, but nevertheless feature an environmental resourcefulness that, when filmed as well as they are, makes them difficult not to watch. A bus chase involving a cool over-the-top car flip solidifies the package: there's something here for every action fan.

The acting is surprisingly good when you consider that dramatics have always been a grey area for fight movies. The aforementioned cast, as well as Liam Cunningham (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wind-That-Shakes-the-Barley/dp/B000OCY7JO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wind That Shakes the Barley</a>) as the top conspirator, are the only players who need to show thematic talent, and they pull it off admirably, with Rhames giving an especially ringing performance during the film's last ten minutes. This is a surprising asset when you consider the film's level of violence, which could have easily drowned out the movie's more sophisticated parts. Within the first three minutes or so, a man has his head graphically blown off, and this level of bloodletting doesn't let up throughout the film. Most of the gore, however, is pure spectacle - it only gets cruel in a few scenes. Thus, if the movie has a fault, it's a bit self-indulgent with its blood content...but then again, a weathered action fan could easily read this as homage to the glory days of action-oriented bloodletting a'la&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Out-for-Justice/dp/0790740834/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Out for Justice</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Commando/dp/B000GUJYI8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Commando</a>.

All the same, I really can't stress enough how impressive this movie is for being produced on a mere 3.6 million budget and still looking as cool as it does. I really don't know what else to say other than to repeat myself one more time: while ""The Tournament"" will entertain people who have yet to be weaned off big-budget Hollywood blockbusters, it's those of you who know just how hard it is to get an independent film made that will appreciate what a remarkably explosive action package this is.

A bunch of  people, 30 in fact, are involved in a last man standing kill or be killed game instituted by the  super rich for some high stakes gambling. One of our contenders (Ving Rhames) has got a vendetta for  his dead wife. Another, played by Kelly Hu, is a sympathetic character with her own sad secrets  behind her. And the rest are all psycopathic murderers save for a priest (Robert Carlyle) who gets  inadvertantly caught up in the game thanks to the trickery of one of the contestants. What's special  is that somewhere in the midst of this resurrected plot, there's actually a hint of heart to it.  Rhames had me convinced of his character's sadness and rage, unlike most of the actors who have  played similar roles before him.

The movie doesn't dawdle at all. It's action from the very opening sequence and after that its  action sequence to action sequence with stop offs at either the gambling table or the gambler's  techs at their station nearby to set up the next sequence. There is a bit of an interlude at the  three-quarters mark, but it lasts about two minutes and we go back into the fray.

The action shows a lot of variety too. We have martial arts, gunplay, car chases, and even Sebastien  Foucan, who showed off his free running skills to great effect in Casino Royale, and his incredible  abilities has a major role in the film.

That's what really sold me on this death match movie. Many of them stick very much to one style, but  this one tried out several different styles and methods and it worked. All of it culiminates in a  fantastic chase down a highway between a double-decker bus and a semi-tanker, giving a strong  nostalgic feel to classic action from the 1980s (even down the the intense, blaring orchestral score  for the scene).

( This idea..though not yet over used is nothing new, and has been done in similar ways in films like ""Battle Royale"", and more recently ""The Condemned"" both entertaining...but B.R. is a modern classic.)  The Tournament has enough differences to stand on it's own.  The cast in general is really talented and do very well with the characters and script, but there are some stand outs.  Kelly Hu is simply great, in a performance that rivals if not trumps her butt kicking character in X2, she plays an assassin for the yakuza and looks fabulous in the action scenes...she really sells it.  Ian Somerhalder plays a psychopath looking for notoriety, he is an actor I've not seen before but will be sure to keep an eye out for him as he delivers brilliantly...but the best performance by far in this film is delivered by veteran character actor Robert Carlyle, who always delivers...but his star shines bright in his portrayal if a priest who is questioning his calling and gets caught up in the middle of the mass murder parade that is the Tournament.  The cast is rounded out with other notable talents.
With Action that takes place in every possible location from rooftops, to street corners, from barrooms to bathrooms this non stop adrenalin rush packs a wallop...and keeps the viewer excited and attention wrapped until the closing credits.  This is a keeper for any action movie fan.",1256688000,3,1763,4.7730263157894735

2628034,4,B000H5VACU,"Languishing in development and production hell for what seems to be an eternity, Scott Mann's film THE TOURNAMENT finally gets a proper DVD release Oct 20th.  The ""combat death game"" genre has been inundated with several films throughout the years such as BATTLE ROYAL, BLOODSPORT and THE ULTIMATE GAME. THE TOURNAMENT makes its mark by delivering a knockout punch with over the top action and enough plot twists to keep the viewer interested.

The story opens seven years ago with Ving Rhames character in a final bloodbath in a sordid meat packing company with two other assassins vying for the title of ""World's Greatest Assassin"". The scene is ultra sadistic, chaotic and bullets are flying like candy from an out of control mechanical Pez dispenser.  As soon as Ving wins the battle, the environment rapidly shifts forward to the present day and the next tournament begins.

The present day battle, taking place in England, centers on 30 contestants all vying for a 10 million dollar prize and a chance to be hailed as the ""World's Greatest Assassin"". Each of the contestants is fitted with a two way tracking device which not only allows them to be seen by the game's ringleader, but also to be tracked by each other, on a blackberry type gadget. There are street cams, sat cams which are logged in with real time feeds to record the action for high stakes gamblers relaxing comfortably in front of jumbo screens surveying this game of death.

Each one of the devices contains a personal explosive as in the movie FORTRESS. The devises are heat sensitive and the tracking lights go out when either removed or the person expires. This is never fully explained, nor is it consistent. This fact is a major incongruity and contradiction, while also rather confusing.  The relative ease as to which one of the contestants removes their device is bizarre. Probably the 10 million dollar prize would force people to want to stay in the game?

THE TOURNAMENT is a ""story on the fly"" auctioneer. The audience learns on the go about the characters, their faults, past history, and special skills while the action is occurring. There are several twists as the action unfolds and to divulge more about them would deter from the enjoyment of the fast paced, diversified story, which includes an unwilling participant who happens to be a priest. Revealing anything about him or why he is involved would deter from a plot complication which occurs quite early in the film.

Kelly Hu from ""X-Men 2"" and Martial Law plays a Chinese assassin named Lai Lai Zen with a strong set of hand to hand combat skills, combined with lightning fast reflexes. She has several interesting fights in the film. The filming style used when she is involved is like the Jason Bourne series, close up in your face action. The edits are sometimes a bit quick. This slightly deters from the action, but keeps the viewer engaged. The stunt martial duties are expertly performed by 3rd degree black belt Tea Kwon Do instructor, stuntwoman Kimberly Chiang. Ms Chiang is currently working on KING OF FIGHTERS having more than 50 films to her credit.

Kelly Hu has astonishing onscreen presence in THE TOURNAMENT especially as her character is drugged to implant the chip. She has to go through a wide variety of emotions throughout the film and commands the screen with her intensity and fortitude.  A lead part such as this might catapult her back into the action realm.
Ving Rhames plays Joshua Harlow the past winner of the contest and a grieving husband. The story unfolds revealing find out his wife was murdered by one of the contestants. Usually relegated to big scary guy in his films, Rhames plays the role with passion and perhaps delivers one of his most dominant performances in his career.

This movie is so unbelievably violent and the pace is astonishingly frantic almost in the style of SHOOT `EM UP. THE TOURNAMENT also contains a variety of elements to offend everyone. Not for the faint at heart, this movie includes nudity and violence in the same scene, as a strip club becomes a warzone. One of the characters, playing up his crazy cowboy mentality, kills people and dare I say an animal not even in the game just for fun. If these facts are bothersome by all means stay away, the audience has been warned.

The twelve million dollar budget was used to full effect with hand to hand combat, knife fights, gunfights, and a battle on a Double Decker bus! The action is nonstop for 90 straight minutes. Oddly there is a bizarre montage in the middle with the slowest music possible, bullets and bodies are flying. Perhaps this is some sort of an attempt of a dichotomous allegory or maybe simply budget or time constraints.

Even with the incongruities, distractions, rather bad box art, and plot holes this is an unyielding, forceful, and memorable action film. THE TOURNAMENT features several blink and you miss it sequences and is worth repeat watching and should have had a theatrical run. The recommendation is a strong rent even a buy, especially if you liked SHOOT `EM UP or BATTLE ROYAL.
