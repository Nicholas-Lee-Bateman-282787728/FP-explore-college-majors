For some reason three fifths of his  fights are with women.
I applaud the sound effects, background music, witty dialogue, and pacing.
This may be my second favorite Canadian action adventure film.",1369526400,,286,5.0638297872340425
8123603,3,B000FJH5G8,"Now, I know buying this movie that it would probably not be very good, and I was correct. I did underestimate how little it would make sense. There is a robotic bigfoot, and a 20 minutes wrestling scene for almost no reason. That being said, I am glad I bought it, but it is not as good as JC vampire Hunter.",1358985600,,308,4.065573770491803
8123604,3,B000FJH5G8,"I don't know what to tell you. Maybe it's my admiration of independent low budget films, or maybe it was the weed and alcohol, but I really liked this film. It's good in a bad way and bad in a good way. Let's face it, it's no stellar epic and it doesn't try to be. The dialog is over-dubbed (probably do to poor recording during filming) but that adds to the appeal of Harry Knuckles. You won't get blown away with special effects, the acting will not move you but Harry Knuckles will make you laugh. Either you get the joke of this film or you'll laugh in disbelief. Regardless you will laugh!!!",1278547200,,596,4.283185840707965
8123605,5,B000FJH5G8,"This movie Rocks. Funny as hell!!! From the creator of Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter. This is the story of Harry Knucles the Not-So-Secret-Banana-Eater-Super-Agent who has to recover a mysterius pearl neklace stolen by a Gigantic Bionic Big Foot. With the help of his luchador friend El Santos he goes on a quest against nuns,ninjas and sexy spies. The fight scenes are ""classic B rated jewels"" and it got a great story lines and Dark humor (Ie. There's a wrestling move called ""Turbo Gerbil"" Not gonna explain it).There's also a breaktrough in musical Montage never seen before I won't tell cause I don't wanna spoil it for you. This movie includes the original Harry Knucles short that inspire the  movie and a bunch of extras .If you are a fan of B movies, independent films and funny one liners this is a must have.",1154649600,7,817,4.713286713286713
