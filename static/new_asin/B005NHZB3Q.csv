4847671,1,B005NHZB3Q,"What have we done to the people of the Netherlands such they want to emulate the worst of American film. Stay true to yourselves! Don't regress to our cheaply done CGI effects, e.g.  Saint Nick riding a horse amongst roof tops and his poorly constructed sailing vessel and the usual, transitory can't quite see glimpses of Nick's bad helper sailors while they snatch people. The cheap props of fake blood in little rivulets down the face and a few stabbings is so boringly overused that no one even reacts anymore. Nick needs to not be a slave to full moons on Dec. 5 and get a life! What's he doing with all those bodies, anyway? Nick also needs a better PR company; after all he's been around for a thousand or more years through out Europe surely he must have some positives. And, why are the police so dumb during the action but seem so clever in deceiving the public for hundreds of years as to Nick's true modus operandi.",1325030400,4,927,4.452941176470588
4847672,4,B005NHZB3Q,"I watched this on Fios on demand and it was a fun, entertaining Holiday Slasher/comedy..
It is in dutch so I'm sure you will have the option of subtitles or the dubbed version,I always recommend the original sound with Subtitles.
It starts off with the legend of Saint Nickolaus and how he and what 'they call' black Pete's whom are a few of his men are pillaging a village by going on a murderous spree and stealing children that were supposed to be bad in like 1683 AD..The townsfolk have had enough so they sneak up on Saint Nick's camp on the banks of the water and slaughter he and all the Black Pete's then burn them in their schooner. Then it flashes to 1968 and almost an entire family is slaughtered by the disfigured ghost/demon of Saint Nickolaus,but one boy survives and then they cut to the present time and the boy is all grown up and ready to make sure saint Nick and his Black Pete's don't do any more damage. Supposedly Saint Nick can only kill and steal bad children on the full moon every like 40 years or so ""very Jeepers creepers"".
It just so happens that it is a full moon and has been 40 years so he and his men appear again decapitating, killing and slashing through the snow.
It was a great movie with great gore effects and many of them at that ,addsome great humor thrown in and some genuinely scary moments. I think it's a great Holiday Horror film and one that any slasher lover will want to watch and even own.",1319932800,5,1440,4.317343173431734

Having subtitles are great, but it's nothing compared to understanding the story in the language it was written. I liked the plot, characters and cinematography.

4847683,1,B005NHZB3Q,I couldn't get past the horrible dubbing.  The first few minutes were promising then the classroom scene made no sense to me at all.

4847688,5,B005NHZB3Q,"I can honestly say that this story held my attention the entire time, well there was a brief moment when dear ole Nick was m.i.a in the film and it was more of a find the bomber type situation but very minimal amount of time. Soon the carnage began again. Oh and this slayer is very non discriminant in who he kills = Adults, teens and yes there is the splatter and screams of little children. Sint offers a very equal opportunity slayerific experience.

The story was common as any other holiday horror. Promiscuous youths, urban legend and set ups familiar to any horror film. This film however is in the middle of a very active and modern city of the world and has moments were it is more like a Mission Impossible film than a slaughter film. Very reminiscent of when Jason took Manhattan. Some go almost unnoticed by the evil saint while others seem to be dead in his sites at all cost.

This is a really good holiday film that offers more to any horror fans Christmas tradition. So if a Saint Nicholas eating and killing children and terrorizing town folk is right up your Evil Santa and Krampus parade filled affair then check this film out. However be warned your options are this  subtitled or dubbed in English. I chose the dubbed but think I would have experienced it more intensely in subtitle form.",1431216000,,1310,4.495798319327731

4847694,5,B005NHZB3Q,Every year i like to get a horror movie about Christmas and this movie i picked up with Rare Exports:A Christmas Tale and this movie. I enjoyed this movie alot. I don't want to ruin it for people but the story i thought was original. A serial killer psychopath who was killed under a full moon on hos birthday. Now he comes back every 32 years or something. I thought the scenery was beautiful and i think the acting was well done. The santa character really looks nasty which i like and it is just a gory vile fun christmas horror movie. They dubbed it in english so if you don't want to read the film then watch it dubbed. Great film i highly recommend it to anybody who wants a cool horror film or holiday film. You won't be disappointed.,1420761600,7,741,4.26241134751773
4847695,5,B005NHZB3Q,"In the Netherlands, children put their shoes (containing hay and carrots) by the chimney and sing Sinterklass songs, and those who have been good receive gifts from Saint Nicholas and his helpers (called Black Petes).  According to the myth, bad children, however, are put in sacks and carried by Saint Nicholas to Spain, where he supposedly comes from.  This is not to be confused with Christmas, for the celebration of St. Nicholas Day takes place on the 5th and 6th of December.  In this movie, though, we are told that there is much more to the story, that Saint Nicholas was not a 4th century bishop known for gift-giving and healing.  In actuality, he was a 15th-century apostate bishop who, along with his army of Black Petes, pillaged, murdered, kidnapped, and pretty much terrorized the countryside until a group of villagers fought back and burned Nicholas and his ship.  The truth was covered up by the Catholic Church, so now no one believes the urban legend that Saint Nicholas returns every December 5 night with a full moon to exact revenge on the people of Amsterdam.

One man, though, knows the legend to be true.  Goert Hoekstra (Bert Luppes) witnessed the murder of his parents and siblings back in 1968 and decided to become a policeman in order to protect the citizens of Amsterdam the next time a full moon fell on Saint Nicholas Day.  Of course, all of his police colleagues think hes daft, forcing him to try and stop Saint Nicholas on his own.  A teenaged boy named Frank also becomes involved, after he witnesses the handiwork of Saint Nick and his Black Petes firsthand, only to be wrongly accused of murdering two of his friends.

The films special effects are quite good.  Its hard to forget the sight of Saint Nick riding his white steed across the rooftops as police pursue him, and the sight of Saint Nicks burned face is guaranteed not to inspire any visions of sugar plums in anybodys dreams.  A number of the killings are pretty gory and often involve the shearing off of body parts.  The pacing of the film is also quite good; indeed, the film seems to zoom along much faster than its 90-minute duration.  Simply put, this is one of the best Christmas-related horror movies Ive seen in recent years  despite its less than stellar English dubbing.  Just be aware thats it is known by a variety of names, including Saint Nick, Saint, and Sint.  American viewers may not understand the significance of the date or the peculiar Dutch customs around Saint Nicholas, but the glorious horror unleashed by this dude are truly universal.",1419292800,,2564,4.725842696629213

This is Sinterklaas and he has an ax to grind (so to speak) with the not so good people of Amsterdam.  In the melee that follows, people lose their heads while trying not to stay calm and a lot of children go missing.  Best scene, Sinterklaas on horseback galloping along the rooftops, the police in hot pursuit.  I can't think of a better way to deck the halls than with this little masterpiece.  I plan to watch it every Christmas.  If you like slasher flicks AND holiday films, this is for you.  All others need to beware.  No one ho-ho-ho's in this film.",1387065600,5,698,4.433070866141732

When I did get to see it with a friend, we were both pleasently surprised to how good it was. It wasn't the greatest film, but so much better than all the other Christmas type horror films that were released, with the exception of Silent Night, Deadly Night 1-5 (I liked those). If you want a decent entertaining holiday horror to watch, then this is the one for you. None of the other Christmas ones were any good, especially Slaughter Claus (STAY FAR AWAY FROM SLAUGHTER CLAUS!!!!!). SLAUGHTER CLAUS ON DVD IS AWFUL! I SOLD IT RIGHT AFTER VIEWING IT!",1326153600,14,670,4.5
8480487,5,B005NHZB3Q,"Saint is a really well done holiday horror set in Amsterdam about an undead ""saint"" named Nicholas and his undead minions called Black Pete's. This is all part of the folklore of the region and it was fun to see a ""Christmas"" horror movie that wasn't some wacko dressed as Santa or the Krampus. There are some similarities, as Saint Nick is a nearly unstoppable monster with minions who abducts children. The mythology behind it all was pretty cool as well as the fact that the government is well aware that this monster is going to come and visit every 23 years or so. Efforts are made to contain the damage and to cover up the aftermath while most people have no idea of the danger that a full moon on November 5th is bringing with it.

The acting is good, the action is exciting, the cinematography is great and the special effects are quite nice. I felt like the end was a little abrupt and the resolution could have been better but the film delivers with some great setups and scenes a quick pace and good direction. This version is dubbed but hopefully I can watch it in the original language sometime as I think that will make it even better.",1529712000,,1149,4.419811320754717

8480489,5,B005NHZB3Q,"Now this is a real new take on a Santa Claus slasher film.  A bloodthirsty Bishop kills again and again every 32 years under a Christmas full moon.  Great spooky atmosphere, great acting, outstanding special effects, all go together in this 88 minute not rated horror classic.  I could not believe how great this film was.  Dick Maas was the writer and director and he hit it out of the ballpark on this gem.  Great job!!

There are a couple of scenes that stand out.  Watch as the police try and shoot a bloodthirsty Bishop on horseback racing along the sky line of roof tops in  Amsterdam.  I do not believe I have ever seen this in a film before.  There is also a real 'showstopper' decapitation that will have you hitting the rewind button, top notch fx  on this one.

The bloodthirsty Bishop is a real nasty looking character as well.  He is even more evil looking after fire ravages him when the villagers try and kill him.  I am so glad I finally got a hold of this film.  If you are in the market for a Dutch horror movie that excels on every level then purchase this rare, outstanding film.  This is one of the best horror films I have watched in a while.  Highly recommended!!",1514073600,,1186,4.342465753424658

Saint Nicholas is known in Amsterdam to be a benevolent figure that gives presents, but he is actually a corrupt bishop killed in 1492 for terrorizing and killing the native people with his gang. In modern day, Saint Nicholas Day falls on a full moon, causing an undead Saint Nick to return and kill as many people as he can. It's up to a random idiot teen named Frank and a cop named Goert whose whole family was killed by Saint Nick during the last instance on the full moon in that day. Can they save Amsterdam from being torn apart by this undead Saint? Can he even be stopped?

Saint is a dark comedy that puts our idyllic view of Saint Nicholas into question. Instead of a jolly old man giving presents or even the Saint Nicholas who resurrected the dead and performed other miracles that the Catholic Church has revered. This version of him has little to do with the others as a charred zombie with a disfigured face. When he's actually present, his feast is a bloodbath instead of a feast for exchanging gifts or poems and rewarding virtue. He has followers known in mythology as Black Peter, a troubling dark skinned version of Krampus that punishes the sinners as a foil to Saint Nicholas. The portrayal is definitely racist and it was jarring to see people in black face dressed up as this figure. The horror version of this is in a large gang of charred people who followed him in life. The smell of their burnt flesh follows them everywhere and acts as the only warning to their attacks.

The film has two heroes: seasoned cop Goert and teenage Frank. Goert's family was killed by Saint Nicholas and he's been compiling evidence of his regular attacks ever since. It's his mission to expose the saint and the holiday for what they are instead of what the Catholic church and the city officials try to feed the public in the name of peace and control. I liked his straight forward attitude, but his decision making was pretty suspect in the end of the film. Saint Nicholas's boat is full of the children of the town that he kidnapped and Goert's solution to the problem was to destroy his boat with the children on it. He's obviously supernatural, so that may not work in the first place plus he actively murdered many innocent children.

Frank is the most unlikeable of the heroes. He is a typical teenage guy (who looks at least 25 like all the teens in the movie) who cheats on his (also cheating) girlfriend Sophie and is spectacularly dumped in front of his class. In a very telling scene, he approaches the girl he was cheating with named Lisa for sex and she rejects him. He pathetically tries to guilt her into it by saying he came such a long way and insults her when she says no. I don't want this guy succeeding at anything. He's a grade A douche that I would rather see torn apart by Saint Nick than having super awkward sex with the same girl he pressured then insulted at the end of the film. Earlier in the film, he's arrested for killing Sophie, but the police harrass Lisa and imply that Frank is justified being angry after being dumped. I do not like the misogynistic element of the film that blame the women for everything and a guy like Frank comes out successful in the end instead of gutted like the worm he is.

Saint is an overall fun film that takes the slasher formula and adds a very different version of Saint Nicholas than we are used to. The beginning of the film and many of the kills bring to mind such other slasher films as Halloween. I had a few problems with the film, namely in Frank, the supposed protagonist. None of the characters except Goert are truly likeable and even he allows who knows how many children to perish on Saint Nicholas's boat. The kills are innovative and fun to watch, but I didn't really care when most of the people died. The best parts of the film are the zombified Saint Nick and the Amsterdam landscape.",1482019200,2,3895,4.441958041958042
