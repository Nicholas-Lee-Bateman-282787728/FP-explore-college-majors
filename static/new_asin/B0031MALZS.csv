8387087,4,B0031MALZS,I thought that was a very good dvd. It is very informative and would be good for beginners and/or women . To see if they would like to get more instruction from a martial arts class .,1484352000,,183,3.972972972972973
8387088,1,B0031MALZS,"Although Sifu Wallace, is an excellent teacher. That gives clear and excellent instruction, but the video was somewhat misleading! Claiming to have ""Chin Na & Shuai Jiao"", like techniques. Unfortunately, nothing can be further from the truth! The techniques are just random takedowns from various Kung Fu systems. Quite applicable for anyone but..... being an avid and experienced 'Chin Na and Baoding Shuai Jiao', student and practitioner myself. It was something I was hoping to add to my own personal repetoire. Sadly, it failed all of my expectations. However, for anyone interested in these type of takedowns & throws, it just might be of interest to you. To reiterate; Sifu Wallace, is one of the most competent and learned of Kung Fu teachers, I've ever had the pleasure of learning from. She takes my favorite point of view, when learning any of the Martial Arts; ""Always stick to the basics"" approach. I may have not of had a positive experience with these techniques, but you just might.",1483142400,,997,4.976047904191617

8387090,4,B0031MALZS,"The instruction was pretty good. The video is exactly as the title states; it is exactly about takedowns and control. There could have been some good thoughts on stances and more information on strikes and punches. Overall though, these moves can be done by a man or woman, which is important.",1362873600,2,293,4.764705882352941
