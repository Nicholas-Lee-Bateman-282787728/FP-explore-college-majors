7962189,5,B000066C6S,Both versions of cc and ccs are good. Im more of a ccs fan but cardcaptors is what got me hooked on anime. So i watch both versions. This is the best volume in cardcaptors.,1087344000,,172,3.942857142857143
7962190,5,B000066C6S,"When my sister and me saw this video we instantly bought it! We LOOOOOOOOOOVE all cardcaptors things.[C] the first episode was great even though there wasn't much about Li. I'm a big fan of him and it's awfully satisfying to see him squirm, especially when he blushes around Sakura![oh, man I'm laughing right now!!].[K]actually, my sister was cracking up! [okay, i was satisfyied about Li's squirming too]. there's this new kid called Eli [C says he's twisted] and he's causing all these tests for Sakura. Eli actually seems to be in love with Sakura,[{C} YEAH RIGHT!] but not really. he actually wants Sakura and Li to get together[{C&K}heheheheheh!].[C&K] anyway, this DVD is great!! buy it and find out!",1079136000,,707,5.0
7962191,4,B000066C6S,"There is only one way you can determine that they skipped a load of episodes. In the second episode Sakura only made one Clow Card a star one, but it showed that she made at least 15 cards star cards.
In the first episode:
A new student comes to Sakura's class.
A new enemy arrives, and traps Sakura's friends.
In the second episode:
Because it's spirit is caught in transition, the Dash card runs away and Sakura must save it.
In the third episode:
Sakura gives Yukito a bear, but it transforms into a giant.",1062806400,,509,4.368421052631579
7962192,5,B000066C6S,"This is one of my favorite videos because they have my characters in it and has my favorite episodes.
The first one is ""A Strange New Beginning"". This is about a new transfered student name Eli has came to Sakura's school. You think he is the good one but he is kinda of evil. And another thing, Eli is Clow Reed! Anyways, Sakura's wand doesnt work when she trys to fight this evil force. How is she gonna get her wand working?
The second one is ""Running out of time"". Sakura was trying to get her chores done. When Eli came by he was talking to Sakura and when Sakura wasn't looking, Eli took his powers and made Tori's bike get powerful. After all of this, Sakura was in her room and took the Clow and Star cards out. As some of them popped out, Sakura decided to release her key into the wand and transform some of the Clow cards into Star cards. She is suppose to do one or two at a time. So she fainted for only one minute. All of a sudden the Dash card got out and did something with Tori's bike. (Hard to explain). How is Sakura gonna get the Dash card back?
Finnaly the last epidode ""A new set of wings"". Sakura buyed a little gift at the shop for Julian's birthday after school. It was a kit where Sakura had to make this teddy bear by herself. After Sakura and her friends went to the shop, Sakura tryed to make the stuffed animal. I gotta tell ya, she needs more work to do, hehe. Eli is at this home or some place and using his key to transform Ruby Moon and Spinner Sun in there true forms. (Its one of Eli's friends or something). You know how they talk and things. Sakura, Li, and Madison are at some place outside waiting for some evil to come. And there was. Li was taking his sword and trying to hurt Sakura. Something was under his control! Li used his special card and choose the water power. The water looked like string and it was. That is because Eli got string at the store. So Sakura thought of an idea to stop this and she choose the Sword card and transformed it. After that it stopped and she fainted. At school the next day, Sakura was sitting at this bench looking at her cards and all of a sudden Eli came by and seen if Sakura needed help with her teddy bear toy. So Eli cut around the ear to make it even and so the powers went in the bear's ear. After all of this, Sakura was at Julian's house, outside, and was knocking on the door. Julian came and opened the door as Sakura gave the present to Julian. He opened it and he liked it alot. All of a sudden, the bear turned big and started to destroy some houses! Julian transfored into Yue and then the battle began. Will Sakura stop this?
These are great episodes and you should buy it if you want. They are worth your money. Enjoy!",1057795200,,2716,4.136105860113422
7962193,5,B000066C6S,"I collect animae and I've have this entire series, plus the Sakura series. I highly recommend this series, this realeace, it continues the cardcaptor series, in a cute form, that children can understand. Sometimes young children have a hard-time following or reading subtitled animaes like the sakura series. The sad thing about this series is that Pioneer, has cancelled out the rest of the series and there  was 4 more left to be realeazed.",1028419200,,442,4.972972972972973
7962194,5,B000066C6S,"This dvd is fantastic. because it contains my 3 favorite episodes.
