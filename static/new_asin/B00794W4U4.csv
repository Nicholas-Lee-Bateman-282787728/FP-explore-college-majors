1. The President voted in was politically weak
2. He sided with Russian Ruler
3. His cabinet consisted ineffective, inexperienced men
No one in the Czech expected the downfall of their nation to communist rule. It was thirty (?) years of horrific communist rule until the citizens  started the ""Velvet Revolution"".",1481932800,2,462,4.848101265822785

This is fantastic for anybody who is interested in the story of Vaclav Havel, Prague Spring '68, Velvet Revolution and their impact on the Czechs today.  If you happen to be an educator, be aware that there is a 1.5 hour long version and a shortened 50 minute long version and it contains supplemental materials.  I was pleasantly surprised to have these supplementals with the DVD.

In the extra features there's a great full-length interview with Vaclav Havel, portions of which were used in the film.

Like all great stories from the old Eastern Bloc, this film vindicates the lives of many who dared to do what was right amid tyrrany and oppression and to 'live in truth', as Havel phrased it.

For any of you who love the dramtic story of Czechoslovakia from '68 through '89, grab your Pilsner, rock out to some Plastic People of the Universe and enjoy this film! It will inspire you.",1436486400,2,972,4.72189349112426
