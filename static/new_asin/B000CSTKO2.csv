2473744,5,B000CSTKO2,"Christi Taylor is one of my all-time favorite aerobic/step instructors.  On this particular DVD, her enthusiasm is contagious.  She sings, moves and steps along with the music with a ton of energy!
I like the modifiers on this DVD.  They show you how to keep moving while learning the more difficult DVD's.  It will take a few times to learn the ""flipper"" moves, but, it will be worth the practice, because your body will change while you're learning.
My heart rate stayed up the entire time I was practicing this DVD even with the modified moves.  I also did the Bonus Cardio, which is a repeat of the entire routine, without the beginning instruction so you feel like you are in a dance show.
Love this DVD..I did sweat and keep my heart-rate up!
Thank you Christi",1201046400,2,766,4.562043795620438
2473745,5,B000CSTKO2,"The routine is fun and challenging.  I needed to watch the move master to learn the choreography before I was able to master the routine.  Once I learned the routine the workout was excellent.  If you prefer to pop the DVD in and get a great workout immediately, this may not be for you.  The two girls behind Christi perform the same routine and the four girls in the back perform the modified routine ---the routine is not much different and the girls are hard to see) If you are willing to learn the choreography, you will sweat and have a great time stepping!",1199059200,2,563,4.384615384615385
2473746,2,B000CSTKO2,"This is an advanced video, more geared toward dancers than a home fitness vehicle. Easy to get hurt with this tape. No warm up, complex spinning moves  while adding the vertical component will surely bring injuries to any beginner/intermediate.",1198972800,5,244,5.256410256410256
2473747,5,B000CSTKO2,"Great fun & a great workout too.  It's good to work out to the Doors' ""Roadhouse Blues"" instead of the usual irritating disco music (no wonder there aren't many men who do step aerobics -- they have a natural  aversion to anything disco).  The first half is a swingy, leaping blast.  The steps seem a little tricky, but Christi's MoveMaster segments break the steps down for you to practice.  You then see that the steps aren't so complicated afterall.  I recommend this video for intermediate & experienced steppers. For beginners who would like to try something more challenging & who don't mind working on segments at a time, this video makes a good winter project to master over the long months of indoor exercise.",1195171200,3,718,4.75
2473748,5,B000CSTKO2,"I have Christi's Mission Possible DVD and absolutely love it...it didn't take but a couple of times doing it to get it down.  This one took up so much of my workout time just trying to master it that I've given up for now.  My workout time is limited, so I have to get in there and get it done, not mess around until my time is up.  I'm sure that someone more accomplished than myself would enjoy it, though, and I look forward to the day when I can spend the time learning it.",1179878400,8,477,4.0
2473749,2,B000CSTKO2,I have only tried to do this tape twice.  It is definitely not for beginners.  I could barely keep up with the girls in the back who you were supposed to watch for the easier versions of the moves.  I am sure this is a great workout for advanced steppers.,1178496000,2,255,4.06
2473750,4,B000CSTKO2,"I doubt I will ever be able to do all the complex moves in Totally Cool Step by Chrisi Taylor.  I have learned to concentrate on the 4 girls in the back, who are doing simplified moves, and I manage to get a good workout without tripping over the step.  There is a section that teaches the moves if you want to learn to do the more complicated versions.  I haven't had the time or felt the need to do that.  There is a short section on abs and back that I use quite frequently after I finish the aerobic portions of other DVDs and videos.  Christi's DVD is a lot of fun and provides a good workout.  My main complaint is that the moves are too complicated for me.",1168300800,17,663,4.061538461538461
2473751,5,B000CSTKO2,"I love this workout.  I consider myself to be a fairly experienced stepper and this was a challenge.  It took me a couple of workouts to get all the steps, but it was worth it.  This DVD provides a great workout.",1163030400,13,212,4.121951219512195
2473752,5,B000CSTKO2,"I bought this at Collage Video some time ago.  I have all of Christies workouts.  The reason I have them all?  She is AMAZING.  She is totally profesional and a joy to watch.  She has great personality, and she knows her stuff.  She is so quick on the step, I don't know how she calls out all the moves.  She'll cues exceptionally well - she'll sing out the cues to the tune of the great music her dvds have.  This one has We Will Rock You, Heard It Through The Grapevine and I Love Rock and Roll to name a few.  She's quick and on the ball.  The choreography is sometimes complex, but once you've done it a couple of times, you'll get the hang of it and wonder how on earth you are doing it.  If you are still stuck, there are some exercisers in the back row, who do easier versions that makes following easier.  There is also a bonus ab workout.  Christie really is the very best instructor and fun to watch.",1135641600,60,910,4.131428571428572
2473793,5,B000CSTKO2,"I bought Christi Taylor's Totally Cool Step along with Seasun Zieger's Straight Up Step after reading several reviews.  I love them both, but, Christi Taylor is definitely more beginner friendly.  Don't get me wrong- her workout is tough, but she's easier to follow than Seasun.  I like her choice of songs, her pace and the repetition before moving on to the next combination.  I like her  voice, her attitude and her personality, too.  There are several sections on the dvd besides the regular workout. I really like the bonus abs, bonus  cardio and move master.  I would highly recommend this for beginners or advanced steppers just looking to change your routine.  (I was a little put-off by the bible scripture on the dvd case, but, there's no preaching elsewhere so I let it go.)",1332720000,,785,4.798507462686567
2473794,1,B000CSTKO2,"I have done step before, albeit a while back. I should have paid more attention to the reviews, this dvd is HARD!!!! The choreography is fast and actually a bit dangerous. Even the move master moves too quick. Will put this one aside for later, maybe even a garage sale.",1300060800,,270,4.42
2473795,2,B000CSTKO2,"This DVD is way too complicated.  It makes you have to think entirely too much so you won't get your heart rate up enough to maintain it for 30 minutes.  The instruction part is too complicated also.  She really doesn't teach you step by step.  It's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, but she doesn't give you heads up on where she is going. You'll get lost after one, two.

Try Jin Miller's Simply Step. It'll keep your heart rate up with basic stepping.",1297382400,,468,4.395348837209302
2473796,5,B000CSTKO2,"I really like this one. it is very dancey and twirly but you can do the simpler steps if you want to. It took me about 5 goes at it to be able to do it all through without making mistakes but I would rather than than something easy which I pick up straight away but then is really boring to do. I could do this heaps and not get bored of it- it is really fun once you get it. she is fun too- the way she sings the cues and the music is dancey. Its a really good aerobic workout and there are extra features; an extra aerobic session, an ab workout session, an extra warm up and she also teaches the move combinations slower to make learning the step combinations easier. Its a challenege initially (but I like that) and then its lots of fun to do and I look foward to doing it! Thanks Christi!!",1267920000,3,794,4.0
2473797,3,B000CSTKO2,"If you are a beginner, this DVD is not for you.  Christi does not detail the steps with you at the beginning.  The routine goes directlly into a fast pace, with many different steps, hard to keep up with if you don't know the routine.  If she had started out with a slow version, for us to learn it first, then speed it up, that would be better.  She tells you the name of each step, but if you are not familiar with those steps, it doesn't help.  Certainly the girls in the DVD have worked many hours to perfect these steps at a fast, continuous pace, but as a first time viewer, very hard to catch on.",1267747200,4,603,4.076271186440678
2473798,5,B000CSTKO2,"This workout is 49 min long plus a short cooldown, along with almost 40 additional minutes of abs, preview moves, etc.  The workout doesn't call for anything besides a step.  I didn't expect much from this DVD, as I have others that are fairly lame.  To my complete surprise, I loved it!  It's challenging but the instructor never fails to state the next move.  I don't see the need to go back to other instructors - Christi Taylor give an excellent at home step workout!",1264204800,2,471,4.4941176470588236
2473799,5,B000CSTKO2,"I've been doing step for a few years.  This is a fun workout and I enjoy a lot.
I had Gin Miller Simply Step: Classic Moves, and that was an hour boring workout and I couldn't put up with it after a few times, so I bought this Christi Taylor: Totally Cool Step. I watched the master movement a few times after I received the video, which actually is helpful but also harder than workout cause she didn't give clue in master movement part.  After a few workout, I got all the movements and it's still fun and enjoyable for my workout.  Her clue is very good, the music is good, time (45 mins) is moderate and the movement is fun, so I like it and would recommend it to anyone who had some step experience.",1257206400,,704,4.161764705882353
2473800,5,B000CSTKO2,"I have been doing step class for well over 15 years and over the past 6 years I have been relying on DVD/videos for step classes at home.  I have Kathy Smith, Kelly Roberts (including the annoying Cher step tape) and even Gilard but must say once you have mastered Christi Taylor's Totally Cool Step class the others pale in comparison.  She rocks!  The music, the routines, the advanced options all provide an awesome workout and I now have trouble going back to my old workouts as they are too slow and mundane.  Takes a bit to get the groove but once you've got it you want to keep on doing it!",1254960000,,597,4.303571428571429
2473801,1,B000CSTKO2,"Their were too many things that just made me cringe that I couldn't even get a good work out.  They were wearing unattractive outfits, which isn't very motivating.  Their hairstyles were a little too cowgirl-ish.  The music was from hick town.  Her personality bothered me.  She was just trying to make this whole scenario ""cool,"" and it just wasn't.
As far as the actually moves are concerned, I am a dancer and I could not catch on to all the moves the first time through.  I usually do.  They recommend clicking on the option where she goes through each move slowly before trying the work out.  But that is just a waste of time to me.  When I am ready to work out, I am ready to work out.  I don't want to take the time to go through the instructional part.  Then if I haven't done the DVD for a while I'll have to go through the instructional part again before actually doing the work out.  Anyway, I would just like to sell this back or get rid of it because I will never use this again.",1243468800,4,992,4.218085106382978
2473802,4,B000CSTKO2,I've been doing step for 2 years now.  Christi's workout is really hard to follow.  I've been through it 3-4 times and have only gotten down the first part.  She changes steps really quickly without a lot of reps.,1234742400,,213,4.410256410256411
2473813,1,B000CSTKO2,"Have been stepping for over 20 years ,at home & in the gym,and I think I can do some moves. This workout, however,is waaay beyond my ability. Yes, I want a great workout but don't want to jeopordize any of my limbs to get it! As others said, there is no warmup & Christi immediately beings the ""dance"" routine. Too complicated. I tried the movemaster but that didn't help. Tried following Christi a couple of times. Tried following the women in the background but that is annoying. Now I just use the dvd for the ab workout only.",1233014400,5,529,4.408163265306122
2473814,5,B000CSTKO2,"Wow ~ what a classic!  Christi Taylor is an incredible instructor.  She puts together a set of eight 64 count combinations in this video to fun, sing-along classic tunes.  Christi has remarkable cueing and lead-up moves so you never drop your heart rate.  The first few times I did this video I was frustrated trying to follow along with some of the more challenging combos, but I stuck with it and felt a great sense of accomplishment when I got them down.  This is going in my 'must have' playlist of workout videos.  I'm so glad I found Christi Taylor.",1222646400,,555,4.5
2473815,5,B000CSTKO2,"I bought this DVD about 6 months ago.  I use it all of the time.  There are some complex moves, but you don't have to do the ""advanced"" steps.  You can get a great workout just following the basic steps done by the girls in the back.  The music is energizing and fun!  This is the best step workout I own!
This is not a step workout for beginners, but if you have been stepping for a while, this is a great workout!  After the first three or four workouts, you'll have it down and will be moving and grooving!",1222214400,,509,4.04
2473816,1,B000CSTKO2,"If you're a beginning or moderate stepper, this is not the video for you. You also need a ton of space to do the moves she's showing in here. I just found her totally annoying.",1218412800,3,176,4.057142857142857
2473817,2,B000CSTKO2,"I do not like overcomplicated stepping routines with lots of twisting and turning, and this was such a video.  I tried it twice, and had to concentrate so hard on not tripping and falling, that I got a poor workout. I don't mind having to take 2-10 times to really learn a routine and follow it well, but this one discouraged me, making me think it would take forever to get, and I might eventually hurt myself in the process.  It's for very coordinated people, not me!  I like good workout and a bit of a challenge in following to keep me interested, but not this much. Too fancy dancy.",1216166400,,587,4.318181818181818
2473818,2,B000CSTKO2,"As someone who has limited time to workout, this video is NOT what I need.  I kept having to stop and start trying to figure out how to do the steps.  I do quite a bit of step aerobics and still found Christy's DVD to be very complicated. The instructions are not clear and she does not slow it down and let you figure it out before moving on. I finally gave up and shelved it along with another one of hers. I won't be buying anymore Christi Taylor DVDs.",1206576000,2,455,4.044444444444444
2473819,5,B000CSTKO2,"The moves on this step DVD are difficult, but with a little effort in the tutorial, the workout is excellent.  Anyone who has done step before can pick up the moves and once you do, it will be hard to find a better one.  Don't give up! It's worth it!",1204502400,2,250,3.98
2473820,5,B000CSTKO2,"This video is not for beginners, but anyone can do it with time and practice. Even during the first couple of times I was learning the steps, the routine was a very effective workout.",1203984000,4,183,4.411764705882353
2473821,4,B000CSTKO2,"I am an advanced stepper, so I didn't have too much trouble with the moves.  I found them fun and liked her choreography.  The time does fly by and it is very ""dancy"" which is what I wanted.  I have other DVD's that were MUCH more difficult to get the hang of.

Unfort. the workout isn't as hard as I wanted.  I sweat- but was hoping for something more intense.  I do have other DVD's for that though and will continue to use this DVD when I want to take it down a notch.  I could also power-up more of her moves or modify.

Abs section wasn't bad- quick, but worth doing.

It would be nice if she had a better warm up- I wouldn't even call what she does a warm up.

I have only watched this DVD a few times and her singing the queues is KILLING ME.  It's driving me nuts.  Hopefully I can memorize her routine at some point and turn the volume off!

Overall I'd recommend this to an advanced stepper looking for fun/dancey choreography.",1203033600,6,937,4.138888888888889
2473822,1,B000CSTKO2,"This DVD was terrible. If I had known she was going to be dancing all over the place, and throw in some step, I would not have bought it. Along with the bad choreography, she sings along with the cues she gives out, which is annoying and fake. And the ""Move Master"" is not even slow enough for a beginner to learn. You would have to do this DVD so many times to finally learn it.",1202947200,4,379,4.0
8102091,5,B000CSTKO2,"i love this video.
quick service",1495324800,,32,4.5
8102092,5,B000CSTKO2,Had this DVD long time ago. It's strenuous but I Love it and it works. Love how she slow breaks down the movements.  DEFINITELY WORTH THE MONEY,1476057600,,143,4.296296296296297
8102093,5,B000CSTKO2,"Another of my favorite step workouts; lots of dancy moves and 48 minutes of constant concentration.  With a soundtrack that includes Michael Jackson and Joan Jett, you just want to keep moving!
The workout includes a nice warm up; three 64-count routines in the first half, three more 64-count routines in the second half, and a good stretch.  This is not a beginner workout, as the steps are challenging.  The workout does include Christi's famous ""Move Master"" section, which breaks down each step, at a slower pace, and there are 4 ladies at the back of the room doing the easier version of the workout, however they are very hard to see and even harder to follow.
If you love a dance-based step workout with lots of variety, this one's for you!",1427673600,,748,4.651515151515151

8102097,3,B000CSTKO2,"Christi has great energy.  I like the music and the actual step workout is fun.  The first one is more like a warm up and a little too short in length.  The second one is a little more high energy and longer in length.  My one main criticism is that I feel it is a waste of time and rather boring watching the ""making of"".  I would have preferred that extra time to be used with another good workout.",1396828800,,400,4.012658227848101
8102098,1,B000CSTKO2,"I take many classes of different kinds, but I am new to the step workout.  On the dvd there is a ""master the steps"" section.  It's a joke!  When an instructor shows new steps to her class she breaks them down and goes over each step a few times before adding a new step.  This does not happen in this DVD, her idea of teaching you to master the combination is to run the whole combination from start to finish once on each side.  Stupid really.",1369526400,,444,4.116279069767442
8102099,3,B000CSTKO2,"For years, I've had only one step dvd. I really wanted to add some new routines to my step workout and thought I'd try some Christi Taylor workouts due to their high ratings. I purchased her Mission Possible along with this dvd. First off, I consider myself an intermediate/advanced stepper...I am not new to step. I realize whenever I work with a new routine, there's going to be a learning curve. I found this dvd to be so frustrating. I quit before finishing the workout. Instead of feeling as though I'd exercised, I was angry. I think it will take some time to learn her moves. Even the ""move master"" doesn't repeat enough, and any turning move is problematic because your back is to the screen some of the time. I will give it another try, but will expect to start and stop the dvd frequently so as to better learn the move. If you're familiar with Christi Taylor, you will probably like this dvd. If you've not done her routines before or are new to step, expect a steep learning curve.",1358985600,3,993,4.461538461538462
8102100,2,B000CSTKO2,"I was excited about this video because it was for advanced steppers and promised to be challenging.  I have been doing step since it was invented and have taken step classes around the country, but even I had no idea what she was doing on this video and just had to stop and watch in frustration as they all jumped around.

The problem is that there is only sporadic cueing.  It starts out well with Christi taking a fair amount of time with the first two moves, but then she justs starts jumping around either without identifying the moves or she calls them by names no one has ever heard of.  I watched this video numerous times and still have no idea what a ""mambo straddle"" is no matter how many hundreds of times she said it (if I have to hear it one more time, I'll scream)!

I then watched the ""Move Master"" which is supposed to be a slow motion version designed to help teach the moves, but that was even WORSE!  It's just Christi doing a combination while counting ""1,2,3,4..."" - the individual moves are never named or demonstrated. (Also, for some odd reason Christi looks like she just rolled out of bed on this portion - unwashed hair, baggy old sweatshirt - maybe she had to come in on her day off to record this).

In my opinion, good cueing means you should be able to perform the routine by listening to the individual moves as they are called out and then doing them.  With this video you would have to figure out what she's doing in advance, then memorize the entire combination.

Really disappointing.  Also, Totally Cool Step 2 is even worse.",1347926400,2,1563,4.414634146341464
