5991775,5,B00FGVS0D2,"KILLER! Set in San Antonio, TX, where a drug syndicate has taken control of the region, ""Line Of Duty"" follows the lives of four best friends who choose very different paths. Torn apart over time by their ambitions, their choices ultimately bring them back together on different sides of the law. In this urban crime drama, two young F.B.I. agents, Bobby Ramirez (Jeremy Ray Valdez) and Julian Medina (Will Rothhaar), go undercover to infiltrate and take down an illegal drug organization run by the untouchable drug lord Jason Martinez (Walter Perez) and his right-hand man Derek Hernandez (Joseph Julian Soria).",1386720000,5,613,5.14

5991780,1,B00FGVS0D2,"So bad. Enough titty in this movie to feed a small island nation of babies. All the people who rated this movie worked on set. Trust me, I know. It goes to show, if you have a dream to make a movie, no matter how s***ty it might be, some company will back you. Which is a very hopeful conclusion.",1409529600,3,296,3.95
5991781,5,B00FGVS0D2,"Love this movie, and it's based on my city San Antonio Tx I'm glad they didn't show our state and city as a bunch of cowboy's I'm so tired of seeing a movie about Texas and all you see is country and cowboy's",1409184000,,208,3.86046511627907

5991783,3,B00FGVS0D2,This is a good movie I would watch again not the best story line but for a lower budget movie it was good,1403568000,,105,3.608695652173913
5991784,2,B00FGVS0D2,The story line was great but the acting could have been better more intense to make it more believable just ok,1398729600,,110,4.285714285714286
5991785,2,B00FGVS0D2,"4 childhood friends commit a murder they get away with. They grow up going their separate ways with 2 becoming criminals--and 2 becoming cops. Their lives intersect again with deadly results. The film starts off okay, but it loses its way and starts to have big plot holes and scenes that go on for too long. In the end, the baddest bad guy--is more interesting than the hero. Its not terrible--its just not worth recommending. Lots of violence, blood and some nudity but nothing over the top.",1394150400,,493,4.67816091954023

5991787,5,B00FGVS0D2,I haven't seen a great movie in a while. Action pack movie in San Antonio. Great ending.  I will buy the movie!!,1390694400,,112,4.090909090909091
5991788,1,B00FGVS0D2,"Where do I start?  I want my $1.20 back from RedBox.  This was a wretched piece of sh%^$ !  I watched the second half on fast forward just hoping all the main actors would be killed.  And the Director too.  Wow, what a puke of a movie.  If you like this movie, well, I pity you.  You have absolutely no taste.  Best recommendation is to use this DVD as a drink coaster or frisbee.  Just don't watch it, ever.",1390608000,3,408,4.063291139240507
5991789,1,B00FGVS0D2,I rented this because we go to San Antonio quite a bit and I thought it would be fun to see it in the movie.  The acting was horrible and many times really slow.  It could have been done in 23 minutes and shown as a 30 minute TV show.  It was so bad that I I was embarassed that I paid for it,1390176000,7,292,3.53125
5991790,4,B00FGVS0D2,Very Entertaining movie!  We particularly liked the performance of Jeremy Valdez.  We will watch for his performances in the future. .,1389744000,,134,5.333333333333333
5991791,3,B00FGVS0D2,"LINE of DUTY's plot is pretty standard fare, nothing terribly original. While there are one or two surprises, this film doesn't have the layers and complications it could easily have had. A lot of the nostalgia and sentiment regarding these four guys' life-long relationships with one another is contrived and badly acted, going too far in places, not far enough in others. The maudlin repetition of ""One day does not define a man"" kind of kills the point. To top it all off, the very generic title doesn't help much to distinguish this film. Still, the combination of shoot-'em-up cop vs. drug lord thriller and heartfelt soul drama is interesting and helps LINE of DUTY stand out a bit. The common dilemma regarding who're the good guys, who're the bad guys, is also very well-shown. Finally, the way it takes place in San Antonio instead of the usual LA or NYC is a nice touch.

Better acting by the main players would have helped this. Yet, the four boys who play the central characters in their younger years did a fantastic job, as did some of the supporting cast, most notably Will Estes as ""the Dealer.""

Anyway, anyone who generally likes cop thrillers will probably find this worth watching and, judging by some of the other reviews, may even really love it.",1389398400,,1268,4.707207207207207
5991792,2,B00FGVS0D2,"I wish I could choose 2 1/2 stars. This film was okay, not great. The idea is good and the acting is pretty good but the film seems to have been done with more budgeted stunts, makeup and special effects.",1389052800,,204,4.125
5991793,5,B00FGVS0D2,"an action packed tear jerker.  I didn't necessarily know the actors but came to love them, and think they deserve to be in more movies. great show",1388880000,,146,4.407407407407407
5991794,5,B00FGVS0D2,"I love how some reviewers say they only watched 45 minutes of the movie but feel they know the whole story. Good for them. This movie was richly rewarding on a number of levels. It is about friends, brothers, fathers, family, law, order, crime, and chaos. You will laugh, and yes, you will cry. This is so much more than a good drinking or popcorn movie. I am not going to spoil it with details. I have told you all that you need to know. The writing, acting, directing, setting is all perfectly fine. The drama is intense at points, so the proverbial ""roller coaster"" rise is ever-present. You will feel you know these characters as the movie develops. Your heart will break. Will this movie win an award? No. Movies that really touch the human heart never do. Does it deserve an award. Yes. Several.",1388448000,6,801,4.493150684931507
5991795,3,B00FGVS0D2,"As young teens four boys rob a restaurant and kill the owner. Jason (Walter Perez) was the trigger man. Derek (Joseph Julian Soria) was his side kick. The other two boys in the group, Roberto (Jeremy Ray Valdez) and Julian (Will Rothhaar) were not enthused by the murder. As adults Roberto and Julian join the FBI while Jason and Derek work for organized crime and become drug smugglers. Our newly made FBI agents immediately get a field assignment: infiltrate their old gang...and the San Antonio police may also be working with them.

About 45 minutes into the film you get the first unexpected event. Old frictions between the group surface. The film held my interest but I wasn't riveted to the screen. In many ways it was just another me too film without the ""Die Hard"" larger than life good guy.

Might work as a rental if you like crime dramas with mild action.

5991796,1,B00FGVS0D2,"I wanted to spare someone else the pain so I'm posting a review.  This movie is horrendous.  The actors did a fine job with what they were given to work with, but the writing and dialogue is ridiculous.  The incessant and unnecessary narration drove me crazy and this story has been told a thousand times.",1387497600,5,305,4.509090909090909
8615628,4,B00FGVS0D2,"I enjoyed the movie, liked the story line and the ending. The movie needed a bit more ""personal expertise consultation"" in the area of law enforcement and how crime occurs in today's society. The acting was a little rough but it was good.

Producers need to drop the stigma of the Latino's in today's movies. Latino's are depicted in movies as inferior and less educated. Success stories of Latino's movies would be great.

Again, good movie and have no regrets viewing - good job.",1495843200,,481,4.714285714285714

8615632,1,B00FGVS0D2,"So bad! Seriously, this movie was full of bad acting, bad Spanish accents, terrible story lines and even worse dialog.

On a positive note, our family had adopted the phrase ""I'm gonna stab you with my mother effing gun!"" as a result of watching this movie. Which, honestly has made for some seriously laughable moments. Watch the movie and you'll know why... But, for god sakes, don't ever PAY to watch this movie! That terrible line, and the unintended comic relief it provided, was it's only redeeming quality.

P.S. In order to provide this review, I had to give it at least one star; be warned, that is generous!",1453334400,,617,4.651376146788991
