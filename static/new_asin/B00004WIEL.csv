7925526,3,B00004WIEL,"This one caught my eye because it was something unusual for a film portraying the former Yugoslavia.  It wasn't an account of military life from the various factions.  The narrative is provided by two kids from a middle class neighborhood (soon to be lower) in Serbia.  The overall tone of the movie (life is cheap) is like that I've seen with other films depicting this era.  The story told isn't that original, as I understood it.  Poor kids with few inhibitions embark on a trip into a life of crime, attracted to the power it affords, after being disillusioned by watching their ""right path"" elders' lives crumble in front of them.  Of course, they eventually succumb to a life of drugs, and violence.  It's not an uncommon theme in American movies, and it seems like the writer has seen a few of them.  Some scenes resemble those of ""scarface"", albeit a broke one, and ""Resevoir  dogs"", without the clever dialogue.  I do think the movie did some things effectively.  The dark humor works well in this film, and the acting is fairly good.  It's worth watching for anyone interested in a crime drama within a chaotic time in the former Yugoslavia.",1389225600,,1151,4.6716417910447765

7925528,5,B00004WIEL,"Although a lot is lost in translation, this movie is very powerful and disturbing in many ways. Of course, it's lacking mind-blowing visual effects, but consider the budget that director had to follow...

Reccomended.",1112313600,2,217,5.382352941176471

7925530,5,B00004WIEL,"I first saw this movie in 1998 in Belgrade. The situation in Belgrade at that time was quite as dark as the movie itself is.
The plot is about two boys, growing up during the Milosevic regime in Yugoslavia. It is the time of great disappointment in Serbia; disappointment with the Western world (remember the NATO bombardments in 1999), disappointment with socialism, disappointment with humanity. The kids watch their parents falling from the middle class society into the lower class - a class that did not exist before Milosevic in Serbia. They realize that the only way how to avoid a life in poverty is crime. However, the movie shows how crime had not been condemned but glorified at that time, since gangsters aside politicians formed (form) the upper class in Milosevic's Serbia.
Although the movie starts with the words ""this movie is dedicated to the 'post-tito generation'"", refering to people born after 1980, you will be surprised by the deapth of its meaning. The Wounds is a masterpiece truly worth seeing.",1004313600,30,1021,4.941860465116279
7925531,4,B00004WIEL,"I saw this at the 1999 Philadelphia Festival of World Cinema, and it was probably the most riveting and memorable thing I saw there (with the exception of ""Buttoners""). We're used to our own amoral, rudderless youth in America, but the dysfunctional families, violence and cruelty set in today's Serbia gives one who has watched Milosevitch and the brutality of 90's Yugoslavia a new and interesting perspective.
Both hilarious and shocking, this is a must see (but not at this price, wait awhile).",989539200,11,498,5.0120481927710845
7925532,5,B00004WIEL,"I first saw this film at the 1999 Seattle International Film Festival, and I've been trying to find it here in the States ever since.
This is a fantastic film!  Set against a background of Yugoslavia over the last decade, the film is a great blend of personal character growth (er, well, growth is used tongue in cheek) and political history.
Advertising for this film was banned in Yugoslavia, and it still shattered box-office records.  This is a fine film!",976492800,4,459,4.725
7925533,5,B00004WIEL,"""Wounds"" is fantastic; The movie is capable of rivaling even the best of what Hollywood can offer. ""Wounds"" was one of the fun movies and in the same time very seriously movie abouth growing two young kids in country without perspective. In Milosevic's Yugoslavia. The only one way is way of crime. In one moment you will cry , in the another you will laugh.
This movie will back you to past, for ten years and in two hour will show you what hapend with yougolsav kids in this ten years.
Look this movie and see the pain of serbian people in the  time of Milosevic, War, nomoney.",974592000,6,579,4.361111111111111
