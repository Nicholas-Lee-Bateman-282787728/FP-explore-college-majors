7959456,4,B000063K2M,"First Review: Virgin Fleet.  A story about choices and a power called 'Virgin Force' which seems to act very much like the force out of Star Wars.  The setting seems to be Japan, 15 years after an enemy invasion was stopped by a battleship crewed by a female crew.  Now female cadets are being trained to fight and win the next war.  They have to know how to fly, fight and, yes, be virgins.  The three episodes focus mostly on three cadets, their reasons for wanting to join the Virgin Fleet and the results, good or bad, their choices bring about.  Lots of violence and a strong pro-virgin position.  Made in the late 90s, the music and themes remind me a lot of 'Oh My Goddess!'series (but not as much humor). Total time is 90 minutes. I give it 3 out of 5.
Second Review: Gall Force.  Seems to be the first movie out of a whole series of 'Gall Force' movies.  And it was a movie, not a series of episodes stringed together.  Made around the mid-1980s, it is full of mecha and battles, very much like Robotech, but it is more polished.  The artists took a lot more time on each cell, each scene, being that it is about 86 minutes long, they could spend a lot more on the flow of the plot, the surprise ending and even the cool alien race (who really remind me of the Invid).  The music is used just like in a live-film, to help the mood in flashbacks and such.  Also, there is a lot of nudity, slight nudity and, of course, violence.  I give it a 5 out of 5 and it's really what saves the 2-pack.  Lots of plot twists which keeps you hooked AND guessing.  Also the writers were willing to kill off characters to keep the plot going.
Note: IF you can get Gall Force WITHOUT Virgin Fleet go for it.",1057104000,,1699,4.197530864197531
