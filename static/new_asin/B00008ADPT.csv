7980907,5,B00008ADPT,"First i saw kansas in concert only twice. in 1981 and there last show of 2013 on dec. 28th in tampa. I own all there older cd's  and the blu-ray there's no place like home. Is the sound quality of Device -voice as good as the high-def soundtrack of TNPLH -no. But, something was missing though on there's no place like home and at the concert in tampa . It was Robb'ys vocals( who by the way was in the audience at the tampa show). i just bought this dvd after seeing the concert 2 weeks ago. The vocals of Steve and  Robby and their harmony is what makes DEVIICE superior to TNPLH. . if you are a fan a Kansas this show is a must own. This concert is the closest thing you can get to the old kansas that i grew up listening to.",1389398400,3,728,3.9794520547945207
