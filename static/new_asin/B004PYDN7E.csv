8437807,5,B004PYDN7E,"As a high school science teacher I am always looking for videos that will teach something meaningful (beyond what the Standards require) and will also keep a load of post-pubescent juveniles' attention.  I have never seen a science video work so well.  The kids eyes were nearly superglued to the screen! It was necessary to discuss what they had seen, but they did a nice job of demonstrating how the genes we carry are influences, not iron-set rules written into our fate.  It only requires a little bit of 2 + 2 work to make the connections between what this video is saying about who we are and broader issues in our society.  For teaching teens, it is excellent.  For adults who know nothing about genetics beyond what they forgot in high school, the video is not a review of those boring details that slip off the brain so easily.  It focuses on the relevance of genetics, on how genes influence who we are and how we think - but don't assume it is going to tell you that your genes do everything.  The ending will surprise you.",1306713600,3,1034,4.468085106382978
