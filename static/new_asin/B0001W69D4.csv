8016755,5,B0001W69D4,"""Twelve Months"", or ""Anya, la princesa de las nieves"" as I've always known it, is one of the most beautiful Japan-produced animations I have ever had the pleasure to come across.  This 1980 adaptation of a classic European fairy tale is the story of a kind young girl named Anya who after being orphaned is left in the care of a mean old woman and her daughter, who's twice as evil as her mother.  In that humble home, Anya lives like Cinderella, working and doing the daily labors for the family that cares very little for her, but in spite of all this, Anya remains kind, gentle and caring for everyone around her.  One day, the queen of the land, who is no older than Anya and is very ignorant and childish, becomes enchanted with a picture of a rare wild flower, the galanthus.  On New Year's Eve, in the middle of winter, the queen sends out a message announcing that she'll reward a basket full of gold coins to the person who brings her the rare flowers.

When the old woman and her daughter hear the announcement, they rush home and send poor Anya into the snowstorm in search for the galanthus, though all three of them know the task will be impossible.  Anya walks and walks through the forest, almost freezing to death and calling to her dead mother for help.  When it seems that all is lost and that the girl will hopelessly die, the snowstorm calms down and Anya is able to resume her journey.  After more walking, the girl discovers a great fire, where twelve men are sitting in a circle around it.  Anya humbly asks if she can warm herself and the men agree to allow her to get close to the fire, Anya then discovers that she has met the spirits of the twelve months of the year.  The girl tells them about the task she must accomplish, that of finding the flowers and after a great big round of laughter from the twelve spirits, it's the spirit of April who offers to help her.  The spirits of January, February and March take their turns in clearing away winter and bringing the fresh air of spring, then April makes the flowers bloom all around for Anya to pick, the galanthus.  After she's picked a basketful of them, she gets ready to leave, but before she is asked by January never to reveal to anyone that she met the Twelve Months.

This story is absolutely enchanting in every sense of the word and is brought out by beautiful and artistic animation as well as gorgeous snowy and grassy landscapes.  The protagonist is likeable and even the selfish, spoiled young Queen is a character you can feel for.  The old woman and her daughter are hateful and well, the Wise Man, the Queen's advisor is someone you can feel for, too, for having to put up with the Queen's ignorance of the answer to three times three is not easy.  The music varies from powerful and sinister to melodious and sweet, the Japanese theme song is beautiful, too.  The English dub?  I can't talk about that for I have only seen this film in its Spanish/Castilian (As in Spain-produced) dub, which I found to be delightful and nicely carried out.

I recommend this film to anyone who grew up watching timeless fairy tales by Disney, Golden Films and other studios, for if you haven't seen this delightful classic, you are missing a real masterpiece.",1167523200,3,3241,4.471986417657046
8016756,4,B0001W69D4,"TWELVE MONTHS (1980) is a Japanese animated version of a Slavic fairy tale, as written by 20th century Russian poet and folklorist Samuel Marshak. As such, it's a beautifully designed and illustrated tale involving Anya, a poor girl whose encounter in the woods on a snowy night with the spirits of the Twelve Months changes her life and, ultimately, that of everyone in the kingdom. It's perfect for children and quite rewarding for adults who enjoy artfully animated, well-told stories. And, at 64 minutes, it's not too long (about the same length, in fact, as the similarly-styled Russian animated feature, THE SNOW QUEEN).

The orphaned Anya lives in a cabin in a northern kingdom with a cruel foster mother who dotes on her own daughter while making Anya do all the work. When the capricious young queen offers a basket of gold coins to anyone who can bring her galanthus flowers in the middle of winter, the greedy mother and daughter force Anya, who knows every inch of the woods, out into the coldest, stormiest night to achieve this impossible task. After she is saved from freezing to death by the Twelve Months, who'd then enabled her to find the flowers, Anya comes back with the flowers which are taken to the spoiled queen who demands to be shown their source. Anya had promised not to reveal what happened that night, so she is put in a very difficult position. She offers to go on her own, but is soon followed by a royal party who are all eventually forced into a confrontation with powers they can't comprehend and can't control.

The full-bodied orchestral score is by Russian composer Vladimir Grifutsov and is performed by the Leningrad Symphony Orchestra. The film's director is Kimio Yabuki, who directed quite a lot of children's animation in Japan, including versions of ""Swan Lake"" and ""Tales of Hans Christian Andersen."" This is one of many Japanese animated versions of famed literary works and it shares the qualities of many of these adaptations, most notably a respect for the source, attention to detail, and a tone of emotional honesty.",1104624000,5,2069,4.84180790960452
