7852554,5,6303646638,"I love Roy Clark to death. He's an american icon. He's still alive till this day. He's 81 in real life. And this is the only available video tape of his on the market. And that's able to be found on amazon.com. You may know of him from Hee haw, because, he produced it himself. And it went on for 25 years. The seller got this to me within 2 days from West Palm Beach, FL. And I live in Winter Park, FL. It came by USPS First Class Mail. Which is pretty fast shipping. I give the seller major credit for the fast shipping. And this VHS Tape was very affordable too btw.  I would highly recommend getting this brand new. Not Used! This is something that you'll love. And he performed this concert live from Branson, MO. The famous town in MO. I give this  a 5/5 star rating. So get your copy today before there all gone.
Sincerely,
X: MR. Chris Harvey

Here, on this tape, you will have the benefit of enjoying  Mr. Clark's musicianship & fluid playing on several instruments, over  & over and in the comfort of your own home.  His band is quite  entertaining, as well.  Besides all this, Mr. Clark seems like a genuinely  nice person, too.  I think you will enjoy this tape as much as I have!",949795200,,501,4.2
