7825825,5,6302424194,"I had been looking for this tape for a number of years after first seeing it on one of the educational or arts channels.

Error. Error. I discovered to my dismay that I had used the  wrong scale on several items. I reviewed every purchase in about the last five years and discovered several comparable errors. The changes should be posted within 48 hours. Terribly embarrassed about these errors.",1072828800,3,646,4.91743119266055
