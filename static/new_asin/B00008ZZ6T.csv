7988349,4,B00008ZZ6T,"Fans of the original ""The Gambler"" will want to catch these last two movies in the series. These two DVDs contain 180 minutes each. This was great western entertainment on TV and I'm glad it is now on DVD. Fans of Kenny Rogers will definitely like them. The casting is well done on each movie. Plenty of action on both. The Gambler Returns is a little more special to fans of westerns from the 1960s since the original stars from Bat Masterson, Gene Barry, The Rifleman Chuck Connors, and Wyatt Earp, Hugh O'Brian, and one of the Mavericks, Jack Kelly make guest appearances along with several others. A nice peformance by singer Reba McEntire as well. I enjoyed this one the most of the two. Great gambling story and it was fun seeing all these TV western stars after all these years. The Gambler V is a bit more dramatic with the Gambler looking for his son that has become involved with Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Good story but not the happiest of endings. The two together for this price are a bargain.",1107043200,,1016,4.4972972972972975
