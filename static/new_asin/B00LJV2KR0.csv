6488644,5,B00LJV2KR0,"The ONLY complaint I have with this product is with the packaging - the DVD boxes are large and bulky, and all three cases had a broken ""flipper"" page inside (see photos, this is ONE box of three one the set, as compared to one traditionally sized dvd box, and the box open with broken page) - which need to be secure to keep from scratching or damaging the dvd's.  The cases are difficult to close (think rigid, small plastic pizza box) and must be stored in a different location from all my other dvd's because of the European case.",1423267200,8,534,4.34

6488649,1,B00LJV2KR0,"it came fine but it was for 2-4-5 zones which i had never heard of. I could not play it on my dvd.
I sent them back.
I think you should mark this with an explanation better. I have learned to  make sure it is playable in the US.
However, I am still troubled I will make the same mistake when I go to buy another movie.
I have bought a lot of movies from you and never had this problem",1486944000,,384,3.740740740740741

6488658,3,B00LJV2KR0,The show is great. The DVDs worked fine. The case they come in is atrocious . What a pile of junk. I have to spend 5 min putting the piece of crap back together every time I remove or replace a disc. Whoever developed this case should find a new line of work.

6488660,4,B00LJV2KR0,"Seasons 1 and 2 Universal did a *expletive* job of the formatting and menus. Yes still Bluray quality but really sparse on the menu details
Season 4 they stepped the quality up to match the Amazon Prime quality and the menus and ""extras"" are nicely included.

I am ""late to the party"" but binged watched Seasons 1-3 in a week and a half, taking my time through Season 4. Awesome series as it is filling in for me until new Longmire episodes air.",1458345600,,445,4.36144578313253

8666250,1,B00LJV2KR0,"I'm disappointed with this set. On the display from Amazon,they give you the impression the Whole set is Blu-Ray and Digital HD, Upon arrival of the set,Season 3 is the only set that is digital. When I tried to download the redemption code for the digital copy. the redemption code was invalid for this set. I then notified UltraViolet Universal.com of this situation I have received no feedback in correcting this situation I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND. BUYING THIS SET.for the above reasons. I recommend buying each set separately if you want the digital copies of Grimm.",1497657600,,566,4.90625
