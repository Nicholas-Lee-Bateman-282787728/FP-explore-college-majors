3464882,3,B001AR0D6I,"Ok,""mother of Tears"" is better than Argento's last couple movies but it really isn't a worthy ending to such a great trilogy! I agree with people I've talked to about ""wheres all the colors?"" and I also had high hopes because of the Screenwriters involved. But to me, after viewing it a second time, it is not the Argento I want! Starts promising and  rapidly goes down from there. The ending also really kind of ticked me off. Oh well, at least his Masters of Horror episodes are great.",1220140800,3,487,4.47191011235955
3464883,4,B001AR0D6I,"Let's get one thing out of the way first - considering that no one actually believed the three mothers trilogy would ever be completed, the release of this film is reason enough for horror fans to rejoice. Now, as for the the finished product itself, I think it ought not surprise anyone. People have complained that Mr. Argento has failed to grow beyond the parameters of the zenith he reached in the 1980s. I would agree. But for what it's worth this installment does deliver much of the director's trademark touches - souped up with what can be described as a delirious abandon to the absurd. Nothing in the convoluted plot involving a diabolical relic that somehow triggers the destruction of Rome makes any real sense but then neither did those in Suspiria or Inferno. Writing has never been Mr. Argento's strong suit anyway. What seemed lacking here was the originality and verve of his mesmerizing visuals in Suspiria which had elevated that film to its deserved cult status. We do get in its stead a ratcheting up of the gore and the (intended or otherwise) camp quotient replete with nubile lesbians chaneling the Comme des Garcons school of witchcraft, a hysterical monkey and one hunky sympathetic detective. So, while this doesn't quite achieve the brutal beauty of Suspria, it does manage to close the trilogy with a film that is nothing more or less than classic Argento. And that's not a bad thing.",1218585600,7,1413,4.795081967213115
3464884,5,B001AR0D6I,"After the last few Argento films, I must say I went into Mother of Tears with low expectations. I left the theater, however, exhilarated and pleasantly surprised. This film is imbued with the best qualities of an Argento film: visual beauty, inventive direction, incredible soundtrack, and a wicked sense of humor. Oh, and violence. Lots of violence.

It shares with it's predecessors (Suspiria and Inferno), a few flaws: dodgy acting, lousy dubbing, questionable special effects, and a rather abrupt ending. But these are shortcomings (qualities?) that haunt every Argento film, but somehow only end up adding to the unique experience. The script of Mother of Tears is a bit more linear and thought-out than usual for Dario, and there's not a dull moment in the film.

For a serving of Italo horror at it's baroque, bloody best, I say buy Mother of Tears: it's a new horror classic, Argento updated for our times, yet still holding on to the traits that made us love him in the first place. There are many who won't take to this potent brew, but that's to be expected. Don't miss out.",1214784000,12,1085,4.7967914438502675
3464885,3,B001AR0D6I,"LA TERZA MADRE (or MOTHER OF TEARS) is the third and final film in Dario Argento's Three Mothers trilogy. Dario's daughter Asia Argento stars in the film as Sarah Mandy, an American student working in a museum in Rome, Italy. Rome is the last city where the last witch Mother of Tears resides in.

When an ancient urn is located, it is sent to the museum in Rome where Sarah and her boyfriend Michael (Adam James) works. Unbeknownst to them, Sarah and her co-worker Giselle (the stunning Coralina Cataldi-Tassoni) breaks the seal to the urn and unleashes an unspeakable evil. That evil is the last and final witch Mater Lachrymarum (Moran Atias). With her powers restored, she and her followers plagues the city of Rome with violence, murder, rapes, and suicides. To say that all heck broke loose would be putting it mildly. When Sarah finds out about her family ties to the Mother of Tears witch, it is up to her to destroy her once and for all.

The violence was over the top and a visual eye candy for those who love their horror films to be gory and bloody. The first ten minutes of the film was an indication of what was to come through out the film. For me, the violence was a bit much but I will give Dario credit for giving his victims an interesting and colorful death. It is easily one of the most memorable death scenes I have ever seen which is a good thing. The performances were campy and over the top but then again what performances aren't in the horror genre? Still I did like the camp value in the actors' performances especially Udo Kier, who makes a cameo appearance in the film. As much as I liked the film score, film score was obnoxious and distracting. Sometimes less is more, and I think this film would have benefitted from that concept. For all the gore in the film, it was not bad in comparison to the stupid anti-climatic ending which left me thinking ""is that it?!"". I wished Dario could have come up with a better scenerio than what he did in the film. Another flaw with the film is the scenes between Sarah and her deceased mother (Asia's real life mother). They were unbelievably corny and too Obi-Wan Knobi-ish. And if Sarah was supposed to be a witch, why was she only given the power of invisibility? Talk about lame.

I may not be into horror films as I once was as a teenager but to see a Dario Argento film in the theatre and not on dvd was a real visual treat for my eyes. MASTER OF TEARS is definitely not for the casual horror fan. The death scenes depicted in the film is graphic and cringe-worthy at times. For fans of today's brand of horror fans or Dario Argento's films, this is definitely worth seeing in the theatre if you can.",1214092800,9,2676,4.402020202020202
3464919,1,B001AR0D6I,"Definitely your run of the mill horror film.  But it's what we expect, right?  Poorly written, developed, and acted.  But I did appreciate the attempts at shocking moments. That was something different. Definitely has its share of boob and sexual suggestions.  I like the fact that you had no idea what the motivation was at any given scene.  People going through several emotions in a few seconds and the erratic vocalizations.

Dario has directed MANY films. Two/three of his films are true horror classics...many of his films are bad. Really bad. Really....really....really....really bad. Some things can never be unseen....

The Three Mothers are a trio of ancient witches, probably vampiric, from the Black Sea area, who want to take over the World by Black Magic. Mother of Tears is the bloodiest, and later on the most manic of the three, despite having been played in Inferno by Eva Pieroni. A little plastic surgery never did a witch any harm. The director could have given us a bit more of the first victim, which is upstaged by a similar victim in Suspiria, and then there is less bloodletting for a while. But slow starters often make excellent film, and soon the bloody victims are coming thick and fast. The kebab one is a more aesthetically pleasing victim than the similar ones in Patrick Still Lives and Caligula La Storia, and is just as bloody if a little more brief. Argento also manages a homage to Hithcock's famed shower scene with his daughter Asia, the undoubted Star of the movie.",1399852800,,1128,4.702020202020202

3464946,1,B001AR0D6I,"1 star, or 2? who cares this movie is sad, sad stuff from Argento. I give it 1star because there are some really dark gore moments but it's not enough to make up for the lack luster aspects of the entire film overall. Dario Argento shamelessly casts his own daughter thinking it would be a great idea to finish off his Three Sisters Trilogy and it just fails, his ex wife, Asia's real life mother shows up as her characters deceased mother in transparent ghostly images lol... it's horrible. This movie just lacks the classic Argento touches, there's a shot where the main character is supposed to hear voices telling her to concentrate and she'll become invisible, the guy searching for her then can't see her and he senses she's near and they show him close to her face in the shadows, NOW classic Argento would have zoomed in with a vivid close up showing their faces almost touching adding suspense... but no, we get a standard modern film shot of him hunching over her face in the dull shadow of the book store etc. It just seems like Dario Argento half assed his way through what should have been his crowning achievement regarding the finishing off of this trilogy.

There are a lot of gore moments but not mush else which is just the opposite of how I feel about all his better films. Asia Argento inherited her father's looks unfortunately, she's ugly to me, her voice is coarse and she's graceless in front of the camera. Nepotism sucks, ask Will Smith and his stupid family of goons force upon the film viewing world. Argento casting his daughter is pathetic because it's no way to finish off his legacy at all. A bucket load of gore slopped onto his daughters wannabe career.",1398729600,3,1687,4.567656765676568

3464959,5,B001AR0D6I,"MOTHER OF TEARS (R-Rated) came out some time ago & it was very entertaining, but, due to editing done in order to receive the ""R,"" some things seemed inadequately explained.  The Unrated version fills in those gaps.  The unusual mixture of subtly and gross-out horror in MOTHER leaves most egghead-critics bewildered.  The script for MOTHER OF TEARS was some 20 years in the writing, off and on, and of course Argento can knock off a passable script in a short amount of time, but those movies are merely entertaining at best.
  The 3 Mothers (Mothers of Evil, as in Witches) movies are, however, quite good.  Each of the 3 Mothers has an Argento film devoted to it.  The first was SUSPIRIA, the last film anywhere to be shot in the old three-color Technicolor process (see GONE WITH THE WIND, designed by Menzes, for the best example of this Technicolor process).  The next Argento film in the Witches series was INFERNO, the weakest entry of the 3 films.  The 2007 MOTHER OF TEARS is, I suppose, the last in the series, unless Argento comes up with a previously ignored ""4th Witch"" movie.  Or a prequel.
  Anyway, MOTHER OF TEARS Unrated, for me, is the best film he's ever done.  He had a strong hand in bringing the original DAWN OF THE DEAD, dir. by G.A. Romero, to the screen.  Argento brought Romero to Italy and gave him the $$$ and privacy to write the DAWN screenplay.  Also, Argento wrote the dialogue, all of the music, and had input on the storyline for DAWN.  So, for those of you familiar with the original DAWN OF THE DEAD (not the dumb remake), suffice it to say that MOTHER OF TEARS is far more Extreme than DAWN OF THE DEAD.  And also, MOTHER has several scenes of humor and emotion that DAWN lacks.",1391212800,,1718,4.508090614886731
3464960,5,B001AR0D6I,"This very brutal, very gory evil witch demon film brings to an intestine-tangled close Argento's ""Mother Trilogy"" in blood-soaked form.

Sarah Mandy (Asia Argento) is an American art student in Rome.  Unfortunately for Sarah, her supervisor opens an ancient container filled with ancient things and reads some ancient words...and we all know that reading ancient words scribed on ancient things is a death-dealing no-no.  I mean, did you see Evil Dead (2013) or The Cabin in the Woods (2012)?  So terrible evil immediately converges upon her and, if for no other reason than proximity or contact with the box, that evil subsequently aims itself at Sarah.

Opening this ancient cask has unleashed The Mother of Tears (Mother Lachimarum), the demonic spirit of a long dead witch, upon the city--resulting in a wave of suicides and violent behavior.  Also serving as a dark arts homing beacon, gothy witches in outrageous fashion and loud eye make-up from around the world are gathering in Rome to celebrate the return of Mother Lachimarum and bring about the ""second fall of Rome""...basically Witchageddon.

Looking for answers, Sarah seeks help to learn about a spectral ""voice"" that guides her to protection from the invading witches and how she and her deceased mother are linked to the witches.  Sarah meets an exorcist, Father Johannes (modern horror forefather Udo Kier), who explains much of this mystery.

Director Dario Argento (Suspiria, Tenebre, Phenomena) brings us a dark story with gothic scoring (which is at times perfect, and at others poorly rendered).  This is the third and final installment in his ""Mother Trilogy,"" which he began 30 years prior with Suspiria (1977) and Inferno (1980).  This is not a fraction as eerie as its trilogy predecessors.  However, the gore is deliciously over-the-top from the beginning, including images of flesh-tearing torture, smashing heads (repeatedly and to gut-oozing malformation), BDSM, blood-spewing gashes, dismemberment, eye-gauging, disembowelment, gushy cannibalism, wading through a pit of partially liquefied human offal and being strangled by one's own intestines.  There is even a scene in which a woman is speared in her...ummm...reproductive system--it's all pretty brutal.

All of these images are meant to shock and provoke cringes and winces.  Regarding this suspected goal they are often successful, especially during the finale as we are bombarded by what could only be described as the Devil's orgy.  After all this successfully provocative imagery, Sarah's defeat of Mother Lachimarum is abruptly lame and anticlimactic.  At least it occupied but a minute of a 10-minute gross-out montage full of activity.

The story was alright, but suffered a painful slowdown at about the halfway point.  But what fueled this movie was a shock and awe campaign of gore and brutality.  With that, Argento was quite successful and I was pleased.",1378512000,,2905,5.3150984682713345

The atmosphere that built up during the other 2 is absent.  While they took their time into drawing you in ( helped in part by the great music) this one lacks any of the creepy feeling you got watching the others. Gone also are the great lighting effects from the original film and the story from the second. The actress who plays the mother is laughably bad as well as Asia Argento herself. Asia is great as the tough chick if she has a small roll, but in this movie she just comes off as whiney and annoying. This movie is a perfect reason why a sequel shouldn't be done almost 30 years later. Argento was once a great director whom had great cinematography, lighting and music now all that is left is a final chapter that pales in comparison to the other films in the series. Pick this up if you want to see  how it ends, but if you are a fan of Suspiria and Inferno you are probably going to be disappointed.

3464965,3,B001AR0D6I,"I've waited a long time to watch this, partially because I wanted to lower my expectations for it. I'd heard that the reviews for this predominantly stated that this was a mediocre movie for Argento and a somewhat disappointing finale to the Three Mothers trilogy, so I wanted to distance myself from Suspira and Inferno. Given how much trouble this had coming to the screen, which is never a good sign, I wanted to give it a fighting chance. Those are two of my favorite movies and it's not entirely fair to hold them up against those two. I hate to say it, but this film fully lived up to the reviews.

The story here is decent enough and Argento has a good way of bringing a story to the small or big screen. There's some great atmosphere here, but ultimately this just fell short of what it could be. It was fun enough to be a ""beer and pizza"" movie for many, but I kept feeling my attention wandering. The violence is decent and as always, Argento never spares anyone. It's one of his calling cards, that he won't spare someone if they're in a situation where they're going to die. This is what makes so many of his films so horrifying and for supernatural horror, rather realistic at times. If someone is going to go crazy, they're not going to stop for cute kittens or whatever equivalent there is in a horror movie. I'd elaborate on the ""equivalent"", but it'd be semi-spoilerish.

It's not a bad movie, but you feel every minute of this movie towards the end and I can't help but wish that there'd been about 10-20 minutes shaved off. I think that Argento did well enough given the amount of time that passed between the movies, the almost unfair expectations of the film by many viewers, and what I've been told is a rather small budget for a movie that is relatively flashy. This probably won't bring in any new converts and if this is your first time watching an Argento film, be aware that there is better and this isn't the best he has to offer. Would I recommend purchasing it? Nah. Borrow a friend's copy or Netflix it.",1350345600,2,2034,4.421333333333333

If one were to remove Argento's name from the credits this film would come off as a mediocre scyfy channel production, but sadly Argento's name is all over this one, there's simply no excuse.  Some trilogies are better left undone.  Gone are the masterful shots with extraordinary primary colors, wonderful music and nightmarish imagery.  Gone too is our concern for the lead role.  The film is too bright and little is done to promote anything but the flattest of visual interest.  The acting is poor, Asia Argento's performance is weak and more annoying than pulling to warrant any sympathy towards her.  She is simply a vehicle to get from one lowly scene to the next.  We're given only glimpses into her past and motivations, but these are forced upon us through dodgy dialog in a rushed fashion.  Scenes of this kind should carry some cinematic weight to them, but are shot in much the same manner as a mentos commercial.  The direction is completely phoned in.  To hear Dario speak of the passions he had for the previous two installments, it's no wonder Suspiria and Inferno were so expressive and unique.  Mother of Tears is anything but... it fails to make us feel anything for the characters, and those we are inclined to like, live only minutes.  The film cannot sell us on it's own premise... even as Rome is meant to be falling apart with evil, we see only the weakest of visual examples (a few thugs beating a car)and some awful cgi fires.  The murder scenes themselves are pretty well done, but there is little else in this film that would suggest Argento had anything to do with it.  It should be an embarrassment to him.  It's worth seeing to complete the trilogy.  Most have tempered their anticipation with this one, but even that isn't enough.",1348358400,5,1818,4.684542586750789
3464967,1,B001AR0D6I,"It takes a really bad, really disappointing film for me to warn people not to waste their time.

This is one of them.

EVEN IF you go into viewing this with no expectations based on previous Argento films, it's still bad. It's a parade of wasted opportunities. Wasted locations, wasted sets, wasted ideas, wasted chances for anything approaching suspense, tension or terror. There are maybe 3 scenes tops which even begin to approach the style and fever-pitch tension of films from back when Argento was at his best. And those scenes squander that potential within seconds. This is NOT the work of a ""maestro"", and, as a fan, it saddens me to admit that. But, it's true.

And, with nothing of any substance to distract me, yes, the acting IS dreadful. Only Valeria Cavalli comes close to displaying any presence and conviction onscreen. The story telling is downright asinine. Half the characters serve as nothing more than exposition mouthpieces and murder victims. Asia Argento mumbles and stumbles through the narrative as she seems to completely forget about the brutal murder of a colleague and friend mere HOURS AFTERWARD by showing more interest in a cup of hot cocoa! And if this is meant to indicate she's ""in shock"" there's nothing in the writing or her acting to support it. The titular nemesis is laughable as a ""mistress of cruelty"", unless that cruelty involves watching an actress put herself in a paper bag which she can't act her way out of.

Oh, and, apparently, Dario Argento finds little monkeys absolutely terrifying. However, he has yet to convince me this one is anything more than shrill and irritating.

I don't offer these criticisms casually, I am a HUGE fan of Dario Argento. However, had his name not been in the credits I never would have guessed this was his work.

3464968,5,B001AR0D6I,"Dario Argento is one of the greatest Gallo writers in the world, he is also one of the scariest horror director ever.  He smashed into the horror genre with the classic Susperia, he followed that up with the second installment of the trilogy: Inferno.  Thus bringing us to our movie.....Mother of tears is the final story, the third witch.  She is more ruthless and evil than the oher two combined, her presence brings forth madness to the world which we witness through random acts of violence i.e murders, rapes and beating through the streets.  The only person who seems to understand what is going on and is immune to the effects of the mother of tears is Asia Argento, the ensuing battle between good and evil takes you to places you have never been and don't want to revisit.  Dario truely is a genius.

The one special feature worth noting is an interview with Dario where he actually explains the process in which he created this trilogy.  And note this movie was released in 2009 while the first movie was released in 1977.  Much thought was put into the creation of this series.",1322092800,2,1088,4.601036269430052
3464969,2,B001AR0D6I,"The ""Three Mothers"" series (Suspiria, Inferno) is concluded by Mother of Tears and the best part of this event is that this series is hopefully concluded. Argento's supernatural movies have had the weakest stories among his not-so-strong-on-stories output. Suspiria overcame this issue through its haunting cinematography and exceptional Goblin score, but such inspired combination is hard, if not impossible, to replicate. Inferno was already mediocre and now Mother of Tears just makes me want to watch Inferno again.

At least, I could stand to watch MoT until the end - often thinking of Argento's past movies and how this is a pale shadow of them. There are small moments in MoT (the timed light switch scene, for example) which remind me who the director is, but they are too short and are never fully realized. Others just feel so ridiculous they made me laugh - not a good thing for a movie that takes itself seriously.

3464972,3,B001AR0D6I,"As a stand alone B horror movie, Mother of Tears was fun and entertaining. There were some gorgeous scenes in the film such as the long single take of Sarah (Asia Argento) walking through the decrepit mansion. However, as part of a series with Suspiria and Inferno it seemed to be hampered by some issues that were not present in the two earlier movies in the series.

First, when watching it one got the feeling that the budget that was MUCH LOWER than the grand vision the director had. As a result, the movie seemed to jump around quite a bit and did not really explore introduced storylines (such as Sarah Mandy's latent powers, the exact powers of the tunic etc.). I think the low budget also had an effect on the violence in the film as much of it looked frankly silly (for instance, the ""baby"" falling apart before it hit the water in one scene) and this damaged the overall power that such scenes should have to disturb. The ending likewise struck me as abrupt. I expected more after the build up to it throughout the movie and I can only assume that they may have run out of budget.

Secondly, much of the acting in this movie was quite simply not up to par. In other reviews I have read, people point the finger at Asia Argento but sadly it's not just her that seems to be sleepwalking through lines here. Moran Atias as the witch (although definitely hot) was especially terrible and I think her acting ability (or rather lack thereof) may have limited what they could actually have her do.

Ultimately, these problems mean Mother of Tears just doesn't have the beauty and mystery of the other two in the series. Still, I am glad it was made as it brings closure to a fine series.",1312848000,,1691,4.430868167202572
3464973,4,B001AR0D6I,"Fans of Argento should delight in the fact that his Three Witches trilogy is finally completed with the recent opus Mother Of Tears. Sadly, this one has gotten a lot of mixed reviews but I rather enjoyed it despite it's flaws or shortcomings. I mean, 28 years is a longtime to wait for the conclusion but die-hard fans can surely forgive.

A few things to remember. This isn't Suspiria. Nor is it Inferno for that matter. If you can get past that, you will probably have a good time. While Argento has made some revered classics which are undisputed in the world of horror, too many fans will be quick to criticize Mother Of Tears for simply not being a repeat of the oldies.

Dario has not lost his touch. Trust me. He still knows proper techniques when it comes to the use of lighting & artisitically can still create some of the most unusual death scenes in the horror industry. Mother Of Tears definitely looks & feels like an Argento film for the most part even though the atmosphere may be somewhat different than his other films as it lacks the cheesey metal/electronica soundtrack & the colored lights are all but gone. This time around, we also have CGI effects which is somewhat uncharacteristic of an Argento film.

In light of all it's minor flaws or it's break with tradition, Mother Of Tears is entertaining & we must give it that irregardless of whether or not we like the new direction.  The story of a young woman tapping into her psychic powers or discovering truths about herself has been done before but Argento knows how to keep things interesting. He employs unique characters whom we can imeediately relate to & root for even when they look almost depleted. The gore scenes are a nice touch here but I wouldn't go so far as to label the film a blood bath nor does it belong on the same shelf as the torture porn films.

All things considered, I think hardcore fans have judged this a bit harshly & should give it another try. I will definitely revisit it sometime in the near future as I thrilled to own the film on DVD now. Ciao baby!",1309219200,,2058,4.477333333333333

3464975,3,B001AR0D6I,"Or so I thought.
Perhaps the best way to ease into understanding Argento's third installment of the Three Sisters trilogy is to consider how the nameless alchemist sums up his craft as being ""a little of this, and a little of that"".  And so, we've pretty much nailed Mother of Tears, a hodgepodge of images stitched together by excessive periods of exposition.  The short end of it:  MoT doesn't even come close to Suspiria or Inferno, Argento's first and second respective entries for the Three Sisters.  To quickly compare:  Suspiria and Inferno used the primary colors of light to a gloriously hallucinogenic effect that was saddled by some of the most creepy music you will ever hear by the band, Goblin--(Emerson's contribution to Inferno is at best an acquired taste)--not so in Mother; it's as if Argento is trying to convince everyone that he is as good as any other director by trying to be identical, or he just wants to remind us (with the way he shot the mass mayhem in Rome) of the part  he played in bringing Romero's Dawn of the Living Dead to Italy and thereby reignited the zombie craze.  Sadly, what made his movies stand out for this writer, was the otherworldly lighting (and that music!) that permeated so many of his works.  Also, the music for this film, by Claudio Simonetti, is about as unremarkable as a mid-week school recital--we're talking big, fat zilch on the creepiness factor.  Thanks for the lullabies!  One of the key considerations for Suspiria and Inferno was in how the real stars of those two movies were the camera and set designs.  Sadly these get traded for Asia Argento's excessive exposition and over the top acting.  Still, one cannot have everything.....  Finally, this installment gets a Harry Potter theme of good witch vs. bad witch-an utterly ridiculous decision of plot, coupled with the secondary storyline of a single dad trying to make it in the world with his son, blah-blah-blah.  We cared about the protagonists in Suspira and Inferno, because they had absolutely no control over their fates---their victories were by lucky accident.  Not so for Sarah (Asia Argento), who gets help from a friendly ghost (a shamefully underused Daria Nicolodi) who helps her tap into her inner witch.  That isn't to say the movie isn't without its hair-raising moments.  There is a truly terrifying Japanese witch, some really well done scenes of butchery and violence, and the last 20 minutes almost make the viewing worthwhile when Sarah finally finds the witch's house.  The DVD extras are respectable.  The making of had interesting interviews and observations by key cast members.  Interestingly, the music for this was better than the stuff in the actual movie!  Is Mother of Tears worth seeing.  This writer will probably return to it some day.

3464979,3,B001AR0D6I,"I am a fan of Asia Argento, so was curious what she and her dad could do in the horror genre.  I found this in a discount bin ($5, in Europe) and thought what the heck.  The attraction of horror films, for me, is a combination of mood and extremely esoteric concepts.  I do not like gratuitous gore or incoherence, unless they fit with the concept or emotional theme.  So I rarely watch them if they are not made by first-rate directors like Polanski.

This begins promisingly, but almost immediately becomes, well, bloodily completely horrible.  A medieval object is discovered, with strange inscriptions on top and mysterious objects within.  Asia is a curator student, young and very beautiful, if outwardly troubled and sad.  The violence starts immediately and she flees a prescient monkey, to sleep with her boss out of fear at what she has witnessed.  She goes on a journey of discovery, in which she resolves her sorrow at being an orphan and learns about herself - these are promising themes, but the execution is rather clunky and so much that is superfluous - like a lesbian theme with one of her suddenly appearing helpers -  that by the end I was waiting for it to finish, having tired of splurting blood from neck slashes, crushed jaws, skinnings, etc.  Moreover, the details do not fit into some intelligent pattern, but arbitrary and off the cuff, kind of amateurish.  It also ends abruptly, without the kind of twists that can enter the imagination in any way.  There is some good acting in this.  Asia is quite stunning as a nubile young thing, as are other actresses including the seamy lesbian theme and naked witch coven.  This is fun.  But it doesn't hang together as a whole.

REcommended for Asia Argento fans and indifferent consumers of horror films.  This is basically junk, admittedly of higher than usual quality I suppose.",1280102400,,1852,4.752351097178684

Technically, Argento is at the top of his game, and there are many set pieces in the film that will linger with you long after you forget the basic plot (plot is never the thing in Argento's films, although there's always enough of one to hold your interest).

Nothing works in this mis-fire.... from the miscast and minimally talented Asia Argento in the starring role - a performance that is a real stinker, though i put blame primarily upon daddy's shoulders here for his appalling (I repeat APPALLING) direction.

Completing the trilogy that began with SUSPIRIA (1977) and continued with INFERNO (1980), the film sees the titular witch awakening to unleash apocalyptic evil on Rome. A grisly and excessive hoot, this is one of the director's strongest efforts since the 1980s. After construction workers discover an ancient urn near a cemetery, it is sent to a Rome university where Sarah Mandy (Asia Argento, daughter of the director) is an art history student. Shortly after opening the urn, Sarah's associate is brutally murdered (in an frighteningly creative manner) by a mysterious being who also unleashes an evil monkey in the halls of the school. Sarah escapes to tell the police, but they find her story implausible. Soon, though, it becomes apparent that a tidal wave of evil is washing over the city as a serious of excessively violent crimes is committed. Matters are worsened when the international black magic community--aware that the urn has unleashed Mater Lachyrmarum, The Mother of Tears--begins to descend upon a chaotic Rome in droves. Within its first 10 minutes, MOTHER OF TEARS features a woman being strangled by her own intestines, and continues with well-paced shocks from that point on. While featuring none of the candy-colored lighting that made SUSPIRIA and INFERNO such surreal nightmares, this is still a rock-solid horror film with more originality.",1259712000,4,1526,5.2326530612244895

Set in present day Rome, a large chest is unearthed in an old cemetery and is sent to Rome's Natural History Museum for inspection. Once it is opened by an unsuspecting archeologist (who meets a heck of a demise BTW), it re-awakens the last surviving Black Witch known as Mater Lachrimarum (Mother of Tears) and restores her powers. She then summons all witches from every corner of the globe to travel to Rome and witness her return. In the meantime, Rome becomes engulfed in violence and chaos and it is up to our heroine Sarah (Asia Argento) to try to find a way to defeat this ungodly witch since she is linked to the current events through her deceased mother, who when alive, was a powerful White Witch.

Dario Argento finally finished his ""Three Mother's Trilogy"", the first being the classic ""Suspiria"" (1977) followed by ""Inferno"" (1980), with this rather nasty little horror flick. In comparison to the glorious original, it is sorely lacking. Not in the gore since there is an abundance of it here, but in its originality and overall execution. ""Suspiria"" is one of my favorite horror films of all times. Despite a bizarre storyline with loop holes galore, Argento was able to create a masterwork of suspense, creative camera angles, some nice cinematography with rich vivid colors despite the over-use of 70's cheesiness and a haunting score. ""Mother of Tears"", set several decades later, doesn't offer that kind of visual magic and although it's more visceral, the violence far more graphic, there is little to no suspense. With that said, this film entertained me immensely. Argento's film catalogue throughout the last two and a half decades have been lacking. It has been forever since he has delievered anything of high quality; this effort, although miles away from some of his more accomplished pieces, is better than most, if not all of his films released throughout the last 20 years. Some have speculated Argento lost some of his touch after 1987's ""Opera"" and I tend to agree to a certain extent (although I immensely enjoyed his ""Masters of Horror"" entries- ""Jenifer"" and ""Pelts""). This film does offer a rather clumsy, mildly intriguing storyline as did the original. ""Suspiria"" made up for it with its clever execution; several decades later, that film is still a splended watch. ""Mother of Tears"" made up for it, at least to me, with the incredibly explicit murder sequences and I have to admit, the pacing was swift. Despite a lot of mumbo jumbo, the film moves along at killer speed from one elaborate murder sequence to the next. Some of the gore sequences are effective while others are just plain lazy, using a combination of CGI and practical effects. The cast is worth mentioning, Asia Argento, Udo Keir, Dalia Nicolodi, all whom offer middling to good performances but Argento's films are not noted for their actors masterwork but more for Argento's creativity and style. Lastly, the location shots of Italy are sumptuous.

Judging by its reviews, this is a love it or hate it type of film. Especially if you are comparing it to Argento's earlier greater efforts. However as a horror film, it delivered what it promised. It may lack suspense & wit but the gore, nudity, outrageousness and scenes which many will consider ""bad taste"" are here in abundance and for those that like this type of morbid entertainment, it may be time well spent. Yes, it is not worthy of being uttered in the same sentence with ""Suspiria"" and as a follow-up, it doesn't even come close, but as a tasteless, revolting, shocking piece of horror cinema, what can I say?

I found Asia to be one of the bigger offenders (the films star!), as her acting was stilted at best and just dreadful & (dare I say) amateurish at its worst! Much fun to see Udo Kier in his brief appearance, his demise (like the other similiar scenes) was particularly vicious. In fact, the gore in this film made me feel like I was watching another misogynistic Fulci movie instead of Argentos latest.

So if it stunk that bad,why three stars? Like any good roadside accident,I just couldn't tear my eyes away. The combination of (unintentional) comedy,including but not limited to the laughably bad acting & the films surprisingly swift pacing kept me away from the fast forward button.

I have been generally disappointed by Argento's post-Opera work, most of which has been mediocre to deeply awful.  The only latter day film of his I liked was Trauma.  This is the long awaited conclusion to the ""mothers"" trilogy (based on a work by Thomas de Quincey), and I regret to say that I really hated it.

Most of Argento's work has little to no character development, generally poor acting, and wooden dialogue, but his sets, use of color, camera movement, use of music, lighting, etc., etc., are what makes his best films great.  He did that superlatively from Four Flies on Grey Velvet (the best of his animal trilogy) through Opera.  Then he just lost it, and this film confirms that.  The acting here is terribly wooden, the dialogue is laughable, the plot is confusing (despite being told in a linear fashion), the lighting is very dull, the gore is ridiculously over the top (especially the first murder, where Argento is trying to top the murder scene in Suspiria, but fails miserably), and the film is ridiculous at times.

Udo Kier's character appears in one scene and immediately gets killed, there's a ridiculous lesbian makeout scene thrown in, a pyschotic monkey that is mostly cute, not scary, fight scenes that look amateurish, a gang of ""witches"" who look like they stepped out of Argento's Demons films from the 1980's (and are unintentionally funny), and Asia's central performance is quite dull (even though she has a very enigmatic presence on screen).  There is one decent performance by the chief inspector (who has some funny lines and goofy mannerisms), and there's a good chase scene in a train station, but that's it.  The ending is ridiculous as well.

I wasn't expecting a copy of Suspirira or Inferno (the first two Mothers films), but I wasn't expecting this piece of junk either.  It's a really disappointing film from a director who has seen better days.  I gave the film two stars mostly out of respect to Argento's previous work.

The gore level is about the same as Suspiria, while the acting is only as good as Inferno. It is also the first time I have seen Asia Argento overacting.

It is also worth noting that it appears that Dario Argento had a large budget that he spent on Gore and effects and not on actors. One of the major positive aspects of the film apart from the gore, is the soundtrack. As usual the soundtrack fits as well with this film as each of his other films(In case you haven't seen his other movies the soundtrack always fits the movie well, whether or not you like the movie).

Overall, I feel that this film is the second best in the series, between The best Suspiria and the second movie Inferno.",1239321600,,1063,4.31

But if you're into some violent, gorey scenes, lush colors and dramatic camerawork, then you haven't seen many of Dario Argento's movies.  Man is this one heavy on the red stuff.  And Dario is still the Maestro.  I gave it 4 stars, probably because I feel I've waited so long for the 3rd mother, I feel it could've been better.  But I am in no way complaining.  . .

Suspiria, being one of his best horror films to date,is graced by Mother of Tears,  an excellent completion to his Three Mothers films. Better than Inferno, and second to Suspiria in horror and an interesting storyline. The gore and pure violence in this film is vintage Dario Argento. For the weak at  heart, BEWARE!!! Extreme gore and pandomonium. Thx...",1239235200,,560,4.704081632653061
3465002,2,B001AR0D6I,"I am a long time Argento fan, and consider Deep Red one of my favourite films of all time, though I always felt that Argento lost his way somewhat when he started making out and out horror rather than giallo films. I was never that taken with Suspiria and actually preferred Inferno, despite its poor ending.  However both the first two of the 'Three Mothers' films stand head and shoulders above this - the final film in the trilogy. Shot without any real style and at times just laughably ludicrous (I am thinking in particular of the ancient robe which looks suspiciously like an old sweatshirt with some silver paint daubed on it, and the 'witches' who descend upon Rome looking like they just stepped out of an 80s girl band).  Yes, it has a certain entertainment value, is spectacularly violent in parts and has a good pace, but this remains a very poor Argento film.  With Inferno I could cope with the bad ending because the rest of the film had been stylish and fascinating.  This just has a bad ending with little of merit preceding it. I think Argento peaked in the 1970s and has been declining ever since.",1238976000,3,1117,4.54228855721393
3465003,5,B001AR0D6I,"This is an excellent horror movie as only Dario Argento can make. In a way, its like a greatest hits movie, combining past films like Deep Red, Phenomena all into a gore filled truimph. One thing that I like about Deep Red is everyone has been burned by hot water so its scarier because you can equate that pain to real life. In Mother of Tears, there's a scene with a woman crawling around on the floor and she reaches for a desk and hurts her hand. I can't really relate to a knife wound because I have only cut myself minorly when cooking. That's why scenes like that work so well. You also get a similar scene from Phenomena where Jennifer Connelly is swimming through some nasty looking water, filled with maggots, I think and it almost mirrors the ending of Mother of Tears with Asia in some kind of vile water.
Its very unusal for a father/daughter team to work so well as Dario and Asia do in Mother of Tears. They are able to separate their family identies and work together as director and actor. I think this is what gives the movie its own unique charm. Any other actor playing Sarah Mandy, would have fallen short. Another good idea was to include Asia's own mother, Daria Nicolodi, in the cast. They have a special bond that accelerates the emotions needed to make horror films like this work. Again, I don't think that Nicolodi could have been replaced by just another actor.
However, the real star to me was Moran Atias, who plays the third mother, Mater Lachrimarum, she is beautiful and filled with evil and hell-bent fury (my favorite kind of horror movie woman just like Carrie.)
This movie really plays on people who are agoraphobic, with rabid people suddenly attacking each other. It has that same kind of collapse of society that I associate with well-made horror movies like Dawn of the Dead (1979 original) and At the Mouth of Madness (an underrated Lovecraft inspired movie by John Carpentar.) Both movies show how easy it is to break through that thin layer of reality and allow chaos to come through. Choas is a lot of fun to watch, in horror movies anyway, and it offers Argento a chance to show audiences that he's still got it. I hope he keeps making films because good or bad, they all have something good that no other director seems to have.
I also like the Japanese gothic girl and how she was chasing Asia on the train. It was a nice touch and shows how an international cast can offer something to everyone open-minded.
Overall, I think this is a good conclusion to the Argento Three Mother trilogy. It may not please everyone but that is impossible to do. I think that if you like Argento and have seen a lot of his work, then you will have no problem enjoying Mother of Tears.",1235174400,,2716,4.477822580645161
3465004,2,B001AR0D6I,"I'll say one thing; Dario Argento has guts. And if you want to see 'em, he'll show you lots of them in Mother Of Tears. The film and its story are terrible, incoherent and devoid of any actual substance, moving to the top of my list for dumbest movie I have seen this year. Funnily enough, I did watch the whole thing, which is something I haven't been able to say about other bombolas I have attempted to get through. Mostly you want to stick around because of the WTF value of the killings and gore Argento dreams up, as the events range from utterly perverse to hilarious. The film has absolutely no shame or propriety-but if you're the kind of sicko who likes their video steak Pittsburgh rare, then you've found your movie here. Chopped up babies, pointless nudity, intestine strangulation, crushed brains, cannibalism, all the wholesome stuff you'd expect from Italian b-grade.

3465006,3,B001AR0D6I,"Mother of Tears (known as La Terza Madre in Italy) is a film by Italian horror master Dario Argento.  The film serves as the concluding part to his horror trilogy began back in 1977 with Suspira and continuing with Inferno in 1980.  27 years between sequels is a long time but the film plays on its own merits and there is no need to see the first two except to maybe develop a feel for Argento's style.  The films have revolved around the ""three mothers"", hateful and evil witches who seek to rule the world.  This film's antagonist is Mother Lachrymarum, the mother of tears.  The script for the film has been kicking around since the early 80's when a third film would have made more sense.

Argento's daughter, Asia, stars in the film as Sarah Mandy, a student assisting at the Museum of Ancient Art in Rome.  Crews digging near an old church unearth an old coffin along with a funeral urn.  The urn is sent to the museum to have it's contents inspected and cataloged but when it is open, in true Pandora's box fashion, a great evil is unleashed upon the world.  Rome is soon hit by a plague of suicides and murderous rampages.  Some people are driven to insanity while others become followers of the Mother of Tears.  These followers are essentially Goth-inspired bullies who harass all those they encounter and they have set their sights on Sarah.

Sarah learns her deceased mother was a powerful white witch and that she also has latent magical powers.  Sarah has to learn and gain control of her powers to defeat the Mother of Tears before she becomes too powerful.

Mother of Tears is one very sick, twisted, and often repulsive film.  The gore is extreme to the point of being sublime.  Among the gruesomeness is a priest who has his head chopped to hamburger by a meat cleaver, a woman whose eyes are gouged out, and another who takes a spear ""down below"" and up through her mouth.  You'll also be treated to perhaps the most depraved orgy ever filmed. The film is so violent that the distributor, Medusa Films, demanded it be heavily edited for theatrical release in Italy although the edited scenes have been put back into the DVD version.  That's just a brief summary of the film's escapades and it will have to do because it is thread bare when it comes to plot.

While I never found Suspira to be the classic that some did, it excelled in atmosphere and a visual style that has been abandoned in favor of blood and guts.  All this might have worked if the ""Mother"" had been an evil old crone instead of looking like a porn star with fake boobs.  Argento seems to have been influenced by modern day torture-porn films and deviated from the themes and visual storytelling of his earlier efforts.  On the plus side, the set design and scenes in old churches greatly enhance the creepy factor.

Asia Argento is not strong enough to carry a film on her own.  Her emotions and expressions hardly change throughout 90 minutes.  The most enjoyable character was a psychotic Japanese disciple of the Mother of Tears who attempts to kill Sarah in a train station.  Udo Kier has a short but enjoyable role as the unfortunate Father Johannes.

Extras:

The disc includes a couple of special features including a 33:00 documentary on the making of the films with comments from the cast and Dario Argento.  There is also an 8:00 conversation with Argento as he relates the inspiration for the film and the mythology of the Three Mothers.  Note that both extras are in Italian with English subtitles, which is not the case with the film itself.",1233014400,,3545,4.580952380952381
3465007,4,B001AR0D6I,"There are an awful lot of negative reviews here for Dario Argento's Mother of Tears, the very long anticipated conclusion to Argento's Three Mothers trilogy that began with Suspiria in 1977, and continued with Inferno in 1980.  The point here is that if you love Argento's work, you'll either love what Mother of Tears has to offer, or you'll hate it and not deem it worthy in comparison to Suspiria, or to a lesser extent Inferno.  Argento once again employs his daughter Asia in the lead role of Sarah Mandy, an art student who becomes the target of the resurrected Mater Lacrimarum (Moran Atias), and soon enough, evil witches gather and waves of chaos ensue in Rome.  Sarah luckily has her own dormant psychic powers to aide her in her quest to stop the evil from further spreading, culminating in many montages of psychotic and bloody violence.  As said before, Mother of Tears can't compare to Suspiria, but the film is plenty enjoyable on its own merits regardless.  Argento is still a master at his craft, and there is some great camerawork and gorgeous cinematography to behold.  The practical effects scenes of ultra-gory violence are pretty effective as well (except for the scene where a mother drops her infant child over the side of a bridge and the dummy's arm pops off before hitting the water), despite the fact that some of the CGI-based effects don't always work quite well.  The acting ranges from decent to dreadful, but the unsettling atmosphere somehow manages to make up for it.  All in all, Mother of Tears is certainly flawed, and is certainly no Suspiria (or Inferno), but it still manages to be an entertaining and unsettling ride that displays that Argento still has the tools that made him a master of the horror genre in the first place.",1232496000,2,1768,4.754901960784314
3465008,1,B001AR0D6I,"Twenty-seven years is a long time to wait for the final part in a trilogy. And unfortunately, the eagerly anticipated The Mother of Tears does not look like a film that was twenty-seven years in the making. It seems more like a rehash of older ideas that was hurriedly thrown together at the last minute.

WARNING!!! SPOILERS ALERT!!!

While I try not to give away all of the plot, there are some definite spoilers following. If you intend to see this film fresh, read no further.

YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!

The Plot: During the excavation of a graveyard in Rome, a coffin is found in an unmarked grave with a mysterious wooden box chained to it. The Monsignor of the church sends the box to a museum in Rome, where he hopes his friend, Michael, the museum's curator, will be able to shed some light on its contents. Michael is away when the crate arrives, and his two assistants, Giselle and Sara (Asia Argento), are unable to resist opening the box on their own. Inside they find three talisman figures, some knives, and a tunic with some strange writing on it. When Sara goes to another room to retrieve some books to help with translation, the three talisman figures and their pet monkey appear and horribly murder Giselle. Sara returns to see the strange figures toying with Giselle's remains, and, aided by an unseen savior, barely escapes with her life.

The police react with suspicion to Sara's story of the three deformed figures and a monkey. She and Michael, the curator, begin to make plans to track down the meaning of the artifacts and their relation to Giselle's murder when Michael's son is kidnapped. Michael disappears to look for his son, leaving Sara alone with the mystery.

From there, Sara wanders from person to person, seeking help with the situation, amid the growing chaos of a violent crime wave that has seized Rome, and the arrival in Rome of scores of witches from all over the world, come to celebrate the return of the Mother of Tears. Along the way, she encounters an exorcist (the always-delightful Udo Kier), a psychic, and an alchemist, all of whom give the young woman a lead in the mystery, and all of whom are then murdered in grisly fashion.

The story of the Three Mothers who have ruled the world for a thousand years is helpfully recounted by the exorcist for the benefit of Sara and the film's audience, briefly covering the plotlines of Suspiria and Inferno to tie the three films together. There are a few inconsistencies in the storyline. Mater Tenebrarum, for example, is referred to as the Mother of Pain rather than the Mother of Darkness. Most of these can be overlooked as realistic inconsistencies in the characters' researches and knowledge, but none of it amounts to much anyway. There are a few intriguing ideas, but most of them have already been covered in Inferno. One tale of the Third Mother is told over a series of drawings that may be intended to evoke classical woodcuts, but actually look more like comic book illustrations.

The psychic, for her part, helps Sara establish visual contact with the spirit of her dead mother (played by Daria Nicholodai, Asia Argento's real life mother) who appears, like Obi-Wan Kenobi, as a spectral figure to give advice whenever Sara gets into a tight spot. (The line ""My mother was a dancer"" suggests that perhaps the part was originally written for Jessica Harper, the star of Suspiria.)

The alchemist had in his possession a book which reveals the look of the house where the third Mother can be found. It also contains a red herring ""puzzle"" which has absolutely no bearing on the film's resolution. Sara uses the book's illustration to find the witches' lair, where she is confronted with a hellish tableau of inhuman torture and murder. She and a police officer who has been following her face the Mother of Tears herself and manage to bring an end to the reign of terror in a rather rushed and perfunctory conclusion.

The story, for all its sturm und drang about the end of the world, is wrapped up much too quickly, and rather unsatisfactorily. The punchline is like a throwback to the Hammer Films days when Dracula would trip and fall to his death just as he was on the verge of victory over his adversaries. While this kind of ending may have been acceptable in a 1960s thriller, it is distinctly unsatisfying in a modern horror film. Honestly, is this the best Argento could come up with in twenty-seven years?

There are some attempts at Argento's usual striking visuals, and the expected elaborately staged murder scenes. But even these look strained and unimaginative. There are also many gruesome references to motherhood and womanhood, but, as usual with Argento, these are without purpose other than as prompts for more shocking visuals.

The film is most pointedly let down by terribly weak performances, particularly from Asia Argento in the lead. It badly needed a much stronger actress to carry the film's absurd premise and preposterous situations. Asia revealed in the Q & A session following the film that she had lobbied her father for the part. So perhaps family politics won out over artistic aspirations.

Argento himself has revealed in an interview that he had not originally envisioned a trilogy until after Suspiria was completed. Perhaps it was a conceit he was mistaken to follow. Despite the director's half-hearted comment that he will miss having the Three Mothers roaming around in his imagination, the film looks more like someone's overdue homework assignment than an obsessive labor of love. Argento seems glad to be done with it.

I echo his sentiment.",1232064000,5,5600,4.801661474558671
3465017,3,B001AR0D6I,"After releasing a string of films in the early '70s, Italian writer/director Dario Argento made a huge splash in the horror world when he released the 1977 witch-filled cult classic Suspiria, as well as the subsequent 1980 sequel Inferno. Three decades - and a string of not-so-well received horror movies later, Argento is back with the finale to the trilogy begun by the two classic films. To grasp the full space of time between Suspiria and Mother of Tears, consider that the film's lead (Argento's own daughter, Asia Argento), was only two years old when the first film was released. Much has changed in the world of horror - and in Argento's directing style, since the late '70s.

And while Mother of Tears still packs a pretty decent punch when it comes to standard horror fare, Argento is no longer a leading voice in an expanding genre, instead he's a legend returning to his masterpiece a bit late in the game to see what he can salvage. Much like Stephen King's Dark Tower series finales or George Lucas' Star Wars prequels, Argento doesn't quite have the touch he had when he began to bring this final movie up to the level of its predecessors. In order to compensate for a general lack of continuity and relative drop in quality, Argento has settled back on what most horror directors start out with: excess gore and gratuitous nudity. Luckily, Argento manages to present both in impressive ways so though Mother of Tears is no Suspiria - it's not even an Inferno for that matter - it still stands on its own as a horror film.

The plot is pretty straightforward: an ancient urn is uncovered and sent to an art museum in Rome where American art student Sarah Mandy  (Asia Argento, with an obvious Italian accent) is working. Sarah and a coworker proceed to unwittingly unleash an ""unimaginable evil"" by opening the urn. Destruction and mayhem descends upon the city and Sarah is called upon (by her mother's spirit) to realize the hidden power within herself and to confront the powerful Mother of Tears before she regains too much power.

Along the way a few unfortunates are disembowelled (one choked with her own intestines in the goriest scene I've ever seen in a film) and many others are murdered. There are enough scenes of well-done violence for Argento to remind viewers that he's still capable of orchestrating a fright-fest, but by the time the finale is reached - and the CGI emerges - it's clear that Argento's budget wasn't enough to pull the film along. Argento fans will rejoice that he's finally completed his trilogy, but those clueless to the history behind Mother of Tears may find themselves wondering what the fuss is about in this fairly standard B horror movie.",1231718400,,2698,4.746268656716418
3465018,3,B001AR0D6I,"First of all please excuse my English.

The Third Mother is no more than a fairy tale written in a classic style, following the scheme suggested by the Russian literate and folklore scholar Propp. Argento demonstrates to know it very well and he follows this scheme much more than he previously did in other movies, such as ""Suspiria"", ""Inferno"" or ""Phenomena"", some of his previous works he much more recalls in this new one. The ""Suspiria"" and ""Inferno"" plots were beginning in a chaos background, in a universe where all rules were already subverted; in The Third Mother Argento urges to follow a much more linear structure. That's the reason why the screenplay is maybe too didactic. While in Suspiria or Inferno much remained unexplained, here Argento needs to explain everything, even using drawings, just like a children fairy tale book when dialogues are considered not to be useful enough. The director is a great art connoisseur. In fact he uses the most popular iconography to present his witches: sometimes they are extremely beautiful, young witches, (like Snow White's witch), sometimes naked, as Mater of Tears often is in the movie, sometimes they are torn-weared, long-nailed witches, like those invading Rome, gathering for a Sabbath.
The heroine of the story is Argento,'s daughter Asia, while the actress Daria Nicolodi (star of many glorious Argento's movies and Asia's real mother) is a good witch, or a fairy, helping the protagonist fighting evil. Appearing as an ectoplasm, made visible by a blow of white powder, she actually is the symbol of Argento's old style, which no more exists and of which only frequent recalls and self-hommages remain. In fact, the first murder is a remake of Suspiria's firt one. In Suspiria's cast there also was also Udo Kier, here playing the role of an exorcist priest, there playing the role of a black magic expert. In ""Inferno"" there was a scene shot in an old library in Rome, in The Third Mother a scene shot in a modern book shop located in Rome's central station. Again much alike ""Phenomena"" we have a scene in a pool filled with corpses and a monkey as a player. (In Phenomena the monkey was a friend of the protagonist, while here it is her enemy). And so on and so forth. It seems that Dario Argento wants to say that he is the same director as he was thirty years ago, but his way of making movies, today, cannot be and will never be the same again. As some peopled said in the cinema where I first saw the movie in Italy, is the Third Mother a splatter version of ""Harry Potter""? I think it's much more an authorial divertissement, as the final scene, again lent by Suspiria, could suggest. Maybe only Argento could tell us what The Third Mother really is. Anyway, this movie could seriously be a cult in another ten years.

Like most of the latest Argento's movie, also this one had very bad reviews when it first came out in Italy. Those reviews were all based on what the movie is not but was supposed to be. I think this is the worst way of reviewing a movie: it's no sense to say what it is not (you can just see, there is no need to be said) or what it should be, it is even worse. I think we are lucky that Dario Argento is no more what he was thirty years ago, that his ""gore"", the locations of his movies are not always the same. We are lucky that is not an eternal clone of himself, as some people would enjoy him to be. Maybe his latest movies are not so good, or even bad, but he often surprises and that is a good thing. His way of making movies has never been stereotyped, his style overcomes genres, he bites, crushes, goes through all genres and stereotypes. In his movies a crime story is melted with horror or supernatural. That's the reason why all of his movies are always puzzles with is a missing or a unmatchable piece. A couple of years ago Italian television asked him to realize a classic crime TV movie. Well, the only way he could realize a classic TV crime was by remaking Hitchcock endlessly. The movie was in fact called ""Do you like Hitchcock?"" and at the very beginning of his career, Argento was often and unappropriately acclaimed as the ""Italian Hitchcock"". We have been able to appreciate completely some of his masterpieces like Deep Red, Suspiria or Phenomena only several years after their first release. At first it was hard to comprehend a universe populated by mediums who feel the presence of insanes, and amazing walking puppets as in Deep Red, or locations in an almost Escher's buildings as in Suspiria or Inferno, or a girl talking to insects as in Phenomena. Maybe we need some more years to appreciate the Stendhal syndrome or The Phantom of the Opera, (that I don't like at all, but was well reviewed in France), or The Card Player. What you can be sure is that every time Dario Argento does what you would not expect from him. You like it or not, he is a free artist in every way.

One last thing about actors performances. I don't know how they are in the English version. In Italian version of all his latest movies they sound horrible. And I think this is another incomprehensible Argento's choice, as he has the complete control of production and post-production of all of his movies. Maybe, just like a great Argento's predecessor, Mario Bava, he's much more interested in things than in people.",1231718400,,5323,4.583420776495278
3465019,3,B001AR0D6I,"Some of the acting was bad. The ending with the Mother of Tears death was the easiest most lackluster killing of the main villian I have ever seen. The kill scenes besides the one I just mentioned are unparalleled to most horror movies I have seen in the last 10 years. The rich colorful panoramic scenes of""Suspira""and""Inferno""are not here but Argento makes up for this with impressive scenes of gore. If you are a fan of Dario Argento,then it's a passable effort.",1229731200,2,465,4.682926829268292

The gore and violence is done in a creative and stylish way, so it is better than a cheesy Friday the 13 gore-scene. I actually LOVED the soundtrack! The creepy chanting of ""Motheeerrr"" added some definite tense goose bumps to the experience! What I didn't like about this film is the final confrontation. Wow....what a rip-off. Even the anti-climatic end to Stephen King's The Stand is better than this! The Third Mother can be destroyed that easily?! Maybe Sara could have just gave her a mean look, and the hag might have dropped dead from fear of retaliation! Other than the awful final ""battle"", the movie is good. The monkey is so annoying though! I was glad when it was disposed of...in a typical Argento fashion! That scene was actually funny...sorry, but it was. I couldn't stand that thing! Overall, descent movie with awful conclusion, and stylish gore and soundtrack. I do not regret buying it.",1229644800,,1008,4.832369942196531
3465021,2,B001AR0D6I,"Not the greatest of horror movies, MOTHER OF TEARS is entertaining enough for me to say that it is worth the rental fee, but not to buy.

3465022,2,B001AR0D6I,"to me, a good movie is a good movie, and a bad movie is a bad movie. And this movie is bad.  Really bad. This movie started out fairly promising and caught my attention.  By the middle, I found myself growing more and more frustrated by how much I was forcing myself to care.  Towards the end, it was a painful struggle not to eject the disk. I simply wanted to know how it ends so I didn't waste an hour of my life watching the first half.  To add insult to injury, the ending was so generic and anticlimatic, it might as well have been a Charmed episode from 1998.  But not as good.  The film builds up and has the nerve to expect you to care about the main character, who is nagged by the generic and silly ghost of her mother to ""USE YOUR POWERS MY CHILD!!!""  What powers?  She can turn invisible at will, which we already know.  You're made to anticipate a dramatic finale where she discovers her powers and it helps her to destroy the Mother of Tears. Turns out anyone could have done it with a fireplace poker. She's told her mother was an incredible healer and she inherited her gifts, but nobody is healed...in fact, she's kind of a bad luck charm because people drop like flies when she's around.  One is left with the feeling that this movie was thrown together last minute, which is why I find it so shocking that it took over 25 years to conclude the trilogy.  The only reason I give this film two stars is that there were a few genuine moments of surprise, and it was filmed beautifully. To balance that out, the movie resorts to gore and gratuitous nude scenes straight out of a Friday the 13th Part 1, 2, or 3...you pick (that's not a compliment). ""Mother of Tears"" is a pretty accurate description of this poor excuse of a movie.",1227916800,3,1746,4.276595744680851
3465023,3,B001AR0D6I,"Which pretty much sums this up.  I've never felt compelled to write a review, and as a writer with a number of books on Amazon with varying reviews, I tend not to pay too much attention, but this was an important film to me in many respects-the emphasis being on ""was.""

I write at night, and religiously watch all of Argento's works at least 3-4 times a year to keep myself entertained.  I consider the man a genius, and even thanked him in acknowledgments in one of my books for keeping me so entertained through the years.  I had been awaiting this film for several decades, admittedly with unrealistically high expectations but always in the hope that the brilliance and cinematic flair that marked so much of Argento's work would again resurface.  Now, after 3 viewings, I am forced to admit that the film is not only a disappointment but is easily outshone by any other number of his works.  My problem stems not from Asia Argento's performance, which was adequate, but rather from the film's look and from its plot.  I would have loved an attempt to stylistically recreate some of the master set pieces from Suspiria or Inferno, the deep saturation of color, the flowing camera work of Tenebrae, the Grand Guignol atmosphere of a house of evil.  It was all missing here.  A few colored lights, a few filters, a few dolly shots, and more concentration on the house in Rome as a center of evil, with a malignant atmosphere-any of these things would have gone some distance in setting a tone that matched the first two parts of the trilogy.  Critics of Argento like to argue his lack of plotting, but certainly the first two parts were strong in the vital issue of relating a story-and I wonder how much, if any, input Daria Nicolodi may (or may not) have had with this new film, as one suspects her grasp of the magic that so made the earlier films come to life might have helped immensely here.

So many missed opportunities, and even the echoes of previous films-of the pit of human remains from Phenomenon, of Varelli's book from Inferno-seemed pedestrian; I even thought I sensed nods to La Chiesa and to Torso, and it pains me to say that both are better, more satisfying films than this work.  The only consolation is Dario's mention of a possible prequel-something I can only hope he does, and does by slavishly returning to form, even if that form is thirty years old and he might regard it as outdated.  There is a reason Suspiria is a classic (like Deep Red), and Argento still has a chance to do justice to the story as I know he can do.

The ultimate test, as a truly die-hard fan of Italian horror and of Argento in particular, is Will I keep the DVD?  Will I watch it often?  It's a yes to the first, but a no to the second, and it saddens me to say that I even find a film like Sleepless or Stendhal Syndrome superior to Mother of Tears.  It is definitely worth a watch but a watch with lowered expectations.",1227139200,,2928,4.463414634146342

My first thought upon finishing this movie was ""we waited twenty-seven years for this?"". My second was ""I'd be more than willing to wait another twenty-seven if we could get a movie as good as Suspiria, or even one as good as Inferno, out of this mess."" The problem being, of course, that the intervening quarter-century and change has obviously disrupted Argento's thought processes on the Three Mothers, and what's left is the cheesiness of the first two movie, but without any of the atmosphere that made the first film brilliant and the second watchable, if not classic.

If you've seen a few Argento films, you know the drill here. Through machinations we see in the first few minutes, an urn is delivered to an art museum in Rome. One of the workers there, assisted by art student Sarah Mandy (Asia Argento), decides to open it. Mandy cuts her finger in the process and drips blood onto the cape contained therein, beginning the resurrection of Mater Lachrimarum, the third mother of the title. Immediately, people start going crazy in Rome, unleashing a tide of violence and mayhem, as Lachrimarum gathers an inner circle of worshipers, most of whom seem to be nubile young things who have an overweening fondness for eighties fashions. Since Sarah started this all, she feels a duty to finish it as well, and finds herself helped by supernatural powers she was unaware she had.

Sounds familiar, doesn't it? Of course it does; it's pretty standard Argento, but without any of the trappings that made so many of Argento's films such treats to watch. The director seems to have phoned this one in, drawing liberally from the work of inferior directors who were influenced by Argento back in the day (particularly Lamberto Bava; substitute a church for a movie theater and the bulk of this film comes straight from Demons). A depressing, if somewhat unsurprising, conclusion to the Three Mothers trilogy. Go rent Suspiria again instead. **",1227052800,2,1983,4.895833333333333
3465025,1,B001AR0D6I,"I was thrilled when I learned that Argento was finally making the final installment of his ""Three Mothers"" trilogy. So I pop this DVD in, sit back and.........wonder what the hell I'm watching.

Sarah (Asia Argento) is an alleged ""student"" at the museum of art in Rome when she and her dim-witted friend decide to open an ominous urn in order to catalog its contents. What could possibly go wrong? Well, how about getting strangled with your own intestines for starters and then pursued by a monkey from hell. Things generally go downhill from there. Apparantly Sarah is the only one who can save Rome from the eponymous ""Mother of Tears."" She gets some help along the way from an ineffective Udo Kier, and the spectre of her dead, puffy mother.

No one ever said Argento wrote great dialogue or cared much for the development of his characters. His great strength rests in his amazing use of color, of camera shots, cinematography, and soundtrack. How quick cutaway shots can make ordianry things (doorknobs, vents, gutters,) seem sinister. None of this is remotely present in ""Mother of Tears."" In fact I wouldn't be surprised if Argento didn't direct this at all. I don't see his signature on the film, and so all you're left with is water-retaining ghosts and intestines as garrotes.

I do like that references to both ""Suspiria"" and ""Inferno"" were used, but this movie doesn't even begin to come close to its predecessors. Its a sorry conclusion to his trilogy, but I live in hope that the master of giallo's next entry will be more satisfying.",1226880000,6,1549,4.772388059701493

Argento's influence on horror and slasher films is undeniable and it is hard for me to criticize him openly, but this was a shameless and shallow effort to say the least.  Suspiria is arguably a masterpiece of the horror genre for its visual style, soundtrack, and unnerving suspense.  Here though, Argento abandons those strengths in favor of gratuitous nudity and often completely ridiculous, albeit at times shocking, murder sequences.  There are endless complaints about this film but most of them are quite superficial and apparent only moments in.  Examples include; misplaced accents, unconvincing and often wooden acting, unlikely dialogue, and a plot that is not even worth engaging.

Sarah is played by Asia Argento (Dario's daughter).  She is an American studying in Rome.  She helps uncover a relic that unleashes the Mother of Tears and all of her evil powers unto the world.  Worshippers across the city begin lashing out in order to honor her return and all out chaos starts.

The only thing that creeped me out about this movie was the fact that Dario Argento's film contains a gratuitous shower scene starring his own daughter.  This is something he has done before and it just gives me the creeps.  At least more so than a women being choked with her own intestines which is really just so ridiculous it becomes funny, but then again maybe that's your thing.  I regretfully but confidently refuse to recommend this movie to anyone, even the hardcore fans.",1226620800,5,2084,6.064846416382252
3465028,3,B001AR0D6I,"While I didn't love ""Mother of Tears"", the latest entry from Italian horror master, Dario Argento, I didn't hate it, either, which comes as something of a surprise, considering a lot of the negative press that it's received.  The third and final installment in the long-planned, oft-delayed ""Three Mothers"" trilogy, the film was preceded by Argento's 1977 classic, ""Suspiria"", and the less successful, ""Inferno"" (1980).

In ""Mother of Tears"", Asia Argento (the director's daughter), plays Sarah, an art student in Rome who witnesses the gruesome murder of her mentor and boss (played by Coralina Cataldi-Tassoni) immediately after they open a decaying urn containing powerful artifacts.  As demonic  monsters disembowel and strangle the woman (with her own intestines, no less), Sarah flees the museum, with a screeching, evil monkey hot on her trail.  Overnight, Rome turns into an epicenter of bloody violence as it quickly becomes apparent that the Mother of Tears has been released to unleash a reign of chaos and horror upon the earth.  With the evil monkey, his even more evil masters, and a disbelieving police force chasing her around the city, Sarah hides out, first, with her boyfriend and his son, and later, with a helpful lesbian couple.  As Sarah grapples with visions of her dead mother (real-life mom, Daria Nicolodi) guiding her through one situation after another, the brutality closes in on her and her shrinking circle of confidants.  Eventually she realizes that it's up to her to utilize her own inherited powers to defeat the powerful witch known as Matyr Lachrymarum, and her depraved followers.

""Mother of Tears"" starts out intriguingly, and then gets lost in its own mythos.  The deaths, in true Argento fashion, are spectacularly gruesome, so be prepared.  The acting varies wildly.  Asia Argento is confronted with horrific scenes that would permanently traumatize most people, but a few minutes later, she's laughing and making love with her boyfriend.  I've seen her give better performances, certainly; she seems to be sleepwalking through the role of Sarah.  Dependable Euro standby, Udo Kier, is on hand briefly as a priest who is quickly (and gorily) dispatched by--I'm assuming--a mad parishioner--it's hard to tell who this woman is.  And Matyr Lachrymarum, herself, is played by an Israeli model who looks as if she just walked out of the pages of Playboy.  Her snarky, giggling fashion-model henchwomen add an element of camp to an already out-of-control movie that needs grounding.  Cristian Solimeno and Adam James play the male leads, although only James' role is fleshed out enough to elicit much empathy from the viewer.

The script, by Argento, Jace Anderson, and Adam Gierasch is confusing, and seems to try and encompass several genres of film, before crashing in a blaze of glory with a finale that seems lifted from a seventies TV movie.

Having said all that, there is something about ""Mother of Tears"" that kept me interested and entertained right up to the ending.  The ominous musical score, the beautiful cinematography, the creepy sets, and genuine suspense had the effect of keeping this viewer glued to his seat.",1226448000,,3169,5.15234375

Co-starring Udo Keier and Daria Nicolodi, this eargerly awaited after two decades sequel to ""Suspiria"" and ""Inferno"" from Dario Argento is finally here! this movie concludes the ""Three Mothers"" Trilogy.

This is a stunning and shocking horror fantasy is a nifty Italian/U.S. Co-production from one of Italy's true horror masters besides Mario Bava known as Dario Argento is shot in English and is not for the faint of heart but still worth owning to any fan of Italian horror, Dario Argento or gorehound.

But every negative word you've read is, unfortunately, true.  The movie starts out ok, but really degenerates into a mind-boggling mess, and not even an entertaining mess at that.

The Mother of Tears is a young porno girl, the effects are wretched.  A lot of blood and nudity seems like a good combination, but it isn't. It's just lame and as much as I wanted to love this movie, it is a disaster on every level.  I can't imagine what Argento was thinking.",1223942400,8,592,4.485981308411215
3465035,4,B001AR0D6I,"In the interest of full disclosure, I must state that I am an Argento fan, and not likely to be entirely objective when reviewing his films. I don't hold him to the same set of standards as other directors. It's a given his stories will have plot holes, and not all the actors will be Oscar-caliber. But the fact is, his genius often shines in so many other areas that the flaws are entirely forgivable. That said, Mother of Tears is Argento's best work since Tenebre.

It's pointless to spend too much time comparing this newest installment to either Suspiria or Inferno. There is more than twenty years between Inferno and Mother of Tears, and like most other artists of note, Argento has evolved his style. However, with the continually prowling camera, the mixture of the supernatural with detective work, and violence that is as creative as it is macabre, Mother of Tears strongly identifies with the films from Argento's classic period. On the other hand, it contains more violence and gore than all of his other films combined, which may put some viewers off.

I really wanted to give this movie five stars. But there are two detracting elements. First, not only is the actress who plays the eponymous Mother of Tears terribly miscast, but the character itself is weakly drawn and unconvincing. Thankfully, her cheesy scenes don't dominate the movie. Second, the ending itself, which involves a final confrontation with the Third Mother, is slightly ludicrous. Not to spoil the plot, but the supposedly all-powerful witch is fairly easily disposed of.

Whatever flaws this movie may have, it's a worthy addition to the Dario Argento catalog, and stands heads above any other horror movie that's been released in the past couple of years. The story is inventive and suspensful, the action fast and furious, and there are genuine shocks along the way. Whether or not you are familiar with Argento's other work, this is a great movie for horror fans who want more than standard fare.",1223683200,2,1987,4.872781065088757
3465036,3,B001AR0D6I,"""Mother of Tears"" does not have the arresting genius of ""Suspiria"" or ""Inferno""--Argento has become far too gore obsessed for that--but, for all that, it has some echoes of those two masterpieces that make it worth watching.  You'll have to get through babies thrown off bridges by mothers under the spell of the ""true"" Mother of Tears (who lacks any mystery at all); and assorted scenes of fetid corpses passionately making out.

But any movie where Udo Kier plays a priest has to be seen to believed, and boy, this movie has to be seen to be believed.  Argento has the audacity of the Marquis de Sade/Edgar Allan Poe hyped up on occultism and imaginative amphetamines.

The plot, what there is of it, goes roughly like this: when the opening of a long-buried urn containing several ancient artifacts occurs, an apocalyptic plague is unleashed on Rome (of all places!) and everything gets buck wild. Sarah (Asia Argento) is an art student, of course, and happens to receive the accursed urn.  In a simultaneously amusing and horrifying scene, a fellow student who sees the urn is butchered by two mysterious gloved hands and a monkey--a real monkey--who jumps on her head and just won't let go.

There are some visually brilliant moments here, recalling the hypnotic magic of the first two (the Vatican's courtyard turns into ""Dawn of the Dead"" when Sarah's real mother, her ""spirit guide"" through this distasteful ordeal appears) and her trips through apocryphal alchemical libraries are haunting as always.

My big issue with this is how half a**ed Argento portrayed the Mother of Tears.  She's just this lady with wild hair, naked, who stands in hell screaming with corpses surrounding her.  Part of what made the first two films so hypnotic was the concealment of the head honchos' true identity.  The ending was a total disappointment, with Sarah spearing the Mother and everything becoming right again.  Then, after crawling out of a sewer, she laughs, just as Jessica Harper did in the first film after destroying Mater Suspiriorum.  But the sense of pressure and terror isn't there.  Argento lives in that idiosyncratic world of the true artist, and he never realized that this series is what more or less makes and breaks a certain percentage of his fan base.  Still, he gives us ashes of the supernatural terror he delivered in the first two, and for that we must thank him...kinda.",1223164800,3,2393,4.891089108910891

3465046,4,B001AR0D6I,"The Italian Hitchcock, Dario Argento, brings the world to the brink of disaster in the ""Mother Of Tears,"" the third installment in the Three Mothers Trilogy.

  The Three Mothers are evil witches who spread death and destruction wherever they go.  In the first film ""Suspiria,"" the Mother of Sighs is destroyed in Freiburg, Germany by ballet student Suzy Banyon.  In the next film ""Inferno,"" the Mother of Sorrows is destroyed in New York City by music student Mark Elliot.  I have written detailed reviews for both ""Suspiria"" and ""Inferno.""

  In the third installment, art restoration student Sarah Mandy has opened an ancient urn, restoring power to the Mother of Tears, the most evil and beautiful of the Three Mothers.  Chaos reigns n the streets of Rome.  Citizens commit vicious, unexplainable crimes against each other as witches all over the world converge on the ancient city.  Sarah races against time to kill the Mother of Tears before Rome falls again.

  ""Mother of Tears"" is a family project.  Director Dario Argento casts his daughter Asia Argento in the role of Sarah Mandy.  She has starred in numerous films which her father has directed such as ""The Stendahl Syndrome"" (her debut), ""The Phantom of the Opera"" (Dario Argento's only gothic horror film to date), and ""Trauma"" (a giallo).  Her superb performance as a gritty, gutsy police officer in ""The Stendahl Syndrome"" won my respect for her as an actress.  Daria Nicolodi stars as the spirit of Sarah's murdered mother and is the real-life mother of Asia Argento and ex-girlfriend of Dario Argento.  Nicolodi was the one who gave Dario Argento the idea for ""Suspiria.""  She has also starred in numerous of his films such as ""Deep Red,"" ""Inferno,"" ""Tenebre,"" and ""Phenomena"" - all of which are excellent Italian gialli except for the occult thriller ""Inferno.""

  The plot, the gore, and the music of ""Mother of Tears"" reminded me much of ""Demons"" and ""Demons 2,"" which were produced by Dario Argento and directed by Lamberto Bava.  Instead of zombies, ""Mother of Tears"" has demon possessed individuals who are committing atrocious acts.  The gory makeup is provided by Sergio Stivaletti and the pounding rock score is provided by Claudio Simonetti of the disbanded Goblin.  Both of these highly talented men have worked with Dario Argento on numerous projects.  In the film, there was some unnecessary use of gore and sexual perversion.  Fortunately, it only hindered the plot rather than overwhelm it as in the case of ""Jenifer"" and ""Pelts,"" episodes that Dario Argento recently directed for the cable series ""Masters of Horror.""

  The gorgeous blue and red color scheme that was prevalent in ""Suspiria"" and ""Inferno"" is not found in ""Mother of Tears.""  Therefore, it lacks the nightmarish, dreamlike quality of its two predecessors.  However, this movie had a greater feeling of impending disaster, a disaster that would affect the entire world and not just a ballet school or high rise luxury apartment building.

  Indeed, ""Mother of Tears"" is not the classic mega hit that was ""Suspiria.""  Nevertheless, it is an enjoyable horror movie that can stand alone.  This film will terrify and repulse you with its dark, barbaric images.  The ""Mother of Tears"" is recommended viewing for fans of modern horror and for fans of Dario Argento, the Father of Horror.",1222905600,4,3332,5.020109689213894
3465047,5,B001AR0D6I,"Ten reasons to like this film: the soundtrack by Simonetti is great; the credits are beautiful; the cinematography is often gorgeous even on DVD; Asia's performance is solid; the Mother, while no actress, is very hot; it has Udo Kier; the street witches are uniquely Argento; the ape is cool; the script is more coherent than haters claim; and Fulci's effects man worked on it! Also, it's never boring and much better than Argento's TV work. And Daria Nicolodi is back, if unrecognizable. So see it. As for the Vid Watchdog attack on MOT, they seem to have forgotten that the third mother enjoys cruelty; it's her theme. Also, they give Suspiria a pass when its script is little better, and Inferno is mostly a (delicious) disaster. Their claims of misogyny are problematic. If audiences don't feel the characters are in danger, where's the scare? Gratuitous cruelty (and stupidity, in comedies) is inevitable when movies compete to be the latest and greatest. (Welcome to Capitalism, folks. I guess you thought it couldn't have a downside.) The point of horror ""art"" is to explore the dark stuff on purpose - safely, from a distance. So when the Mother licks up a dying woman's tears, that ties in to the ""mother of tears"" title pretty well, don't you think? The lack of crane shots or primary colored sets is an intentional step away from his old style, says the director. So no points detracted there. Who knows - or cares - why some are so upset about the monkey. Isn't it enough for it to be weird and unexpected? That fits nicely with the characterization of Argento as a sort of Surrealist. Sure, there are plenty of sloppy moments here. And beautiful ones, too. But watch again for when Asia discovers the lair of the Mother - if you don't think that lighting is intentional, and very cool, you probably can't be won over to the Argento camp.

3465048,5,B001AR0D6I,"If there is one thing that two seasons of the often underwhelming TV series Masters Of Horror gave us, it was a rejuvinated Dario Argento.  The Italian director delivered a pair of entries(Jenifer and Pelts) that stand not only as some of the best from the series, but also some of the best material(and most extreme) that he had done in nearly 10 years(Opera from 1987 being his last great work in my opinion), and showcased that he still had the ability to disturb and entertain.  Gone was much of his famous trademarks-- inventive camerawork, use of heavy colored lighting, and artistic quirkiness; which were now replaced with more straightforward and solid pacing and scenes of shocking grue.  With Mother Of Tears, Argento uses that same aforementioned formula from his Masters Of Horror episodes, except now stretched into full-length form AND used to complete his 28-years-in-the-making ""mothers"" trilogy of films(begining in 1977 with Suspiria, and it's sequel Inferno from 1980).  The movie follows Sarah(poorly acted by Dario's own daughter Asia Argento), a museum worker who unwittingly unleashes the evil of the Mother of Tears on Rome when she opens an ancient cask... hijinx ensue and feature some of the Italian maestro's most excellent moments of depravity ever, including(but not limited to) stangulation by one's own intestines, baby cannibalism, and impalement(Cannibal Holocaust style!).  Throw in some solid atmoshere, brisk pacing, tons of nudity(even some full-frontal for the gents), and a fantasic jump scare towards the middle of the movie(so good I had to watch it twice in a row), and we have a definite winner here(all that was missing was a soundtrack by Goblin).  Between the joy of seeing Dario Argento's return from Hacksville(where Tobe Hooper and George Romero unfortunately still reside) and the amount of fun watching this provided, I have no choice but to deliver a rare 5 star rating... not to mention that I feel the film does catch some unnecassarily harsh critism due to Argento being the director; let's face it, if this was some nobody fresh out of film school he'd be heralded as the ""next big thing"" in horror cinema.  Still, this isn't a true return to form for Argento as far as his classic style is concerned... it IS a return for Argento to making a great horror movie though(and that's a start right?)-- ABSOLUTELY RECOMMENDED!",1222560000,42,2379,5.053571428571429

The excessive gore does not make up for the familiar story plot that many movies today employ. The rod through one of the actresses, is an update from a sword used in the same manner from 'I DRINK YOUR BLOOD' and the later 'LIVING DEAD GIRLS.' The third mother reminds me of a over glamourized 'COLLEGE GIRL GONE WILD.' The movie is definitely not close to the atmospheric scenary as with 'INFERNO' and 'SUSPERIA.' Of all the ""Mothers"" the second really didn't die. She willingly engulfed herself in flames; and in my opinion was the best of the three and the best lookin, despite being older than the 3rd. Even Asia Argento looks a bit beat or tired. This is the 3rd movie and ranks that as well, compared to the others with 'INFERNO' being the best. The gore is over the top with a few revolting scenes, but the story line on a whole is a familiar one. If Argento rigs up another ""Mother"" movie, it should deal with 'The MOTHER OF DdARKNESS'....INFERNO. She is the only one not killed.",1222473600,,1093,4.525252525252525
3465050,4,B001AR0D6I,"I am a big fan of Dario Argento and I have been ever since I saw Deep Red in a small auditorium on my college campus back in the early 1980's.  And ever since I heard that Suspiria was supposed to be a trilogy, I have eagerly awaited the sequels.  Truth be told, Inferno, the second installment in the Three Mothers Trilogy, was a bit of a letdown.  Inferno was a visually strong film, but the story seemed weak.  Mother of Tears, on the other hand, is the opposite, a strong story which I feel successfully ties the three films together, but visually, the film seem rather devoid to me of the visual style present in Dario's earlier works, the weird camera angles and the vivid colors.  Dario seems to fill the void in this film created by the lack of his trademark visuals with extreme and excessive gore, even for Dario.  The gore in Dario's earlier works, such as Deep Red or Suspiria or Opera, seem to puncuate the film in moments that are extreme and savage, but not long sustained, but the gore in Mother of Tears seems to go on much longer.  The camera seems to linger on it.  I'm a horror fan, so I don't mind gore and the gore in this film isn't bad in any way, just different.  In that respect, this film reminds me stylistically more of Dario's second season Master of Horrors episode, Pelts, rather than any of his other earlier works.  Nonetheless, I enjoyed this movie very much and, as far as the story goes, I think that it is a fine conclusion to the Three Mothers Trilogy, but I can only give this film four stars.  It is simply not the five star masterpiece that Suspiria, and Opera, also, are.

I should also mention that Dario's daughter, the beautiful and talented Asia Argento, stars in Mother of Tears and she turns in another fine performance.",1222473600,2,1769,4.409230769230769
3465051,4,B001AR0D6I,"THE GOOD:
The Maestro is back!!!
And apparently has gotten alot more visceral in his old age.
(Which I personally blame Masters of Horror for. Thanx MOH!!!)
He's turned the sex & the gore ALL the way up for this final installment into the ""3 Mothers series""
AND MAN IS IT EXTREME!!!!
Easily the most extreme piece Argento's ever done!!!!!!!!!
The gore & the nudity were magnificent!!!
Made me wanna kiss my fingertips.
Every, and I mean EVERY death scene will make you cringe like you have Parkinsons.
The direction was excellent,
the set-pieces were gorgeous,
the gore was astonishing, and the nudity was delightfully delicious.
But that's where the fun stops.

THE BAD:
Essentially all this magnificence is marred by terrible,
just god-awful writing and acting.
Jace Anderson the writer behind Crocadile, Mortuary, & Toolbox Murders really botched up this project.
Everytime someone would open their mouths, I would wince in pain.
The dialogue was honestly that bad.
There was no character development what-so-ever.
Most of the film, characters spent their time either researching,
or traveling from location to location to talk to other characters
you already forgot about.
Not one character shined through.
Each was as forgettable as the last.
Half the time I was asking ""Who's that?"" or
""Is that the same guy as that other guy??""

So many different elements of this flick could be considered god-awful.
The music was nowhere near up to par with that of Suspiria.
The plot skipped around, with no real sense of direction.
You never got that ominous dreadful feeling, it's predecessors portrayed.
The guiding voice of the main protagonists mother; &
the ability to see spirts using some kind of compact mirror spell,
was laughable at best.
And the ending seemed like it should have been different,
like it was screwed up due to budgetary restraints.
What should have been an epic conclusion to an unforgettable series,
was instead woefully amateurish and obviously rushed.

If you can turn your intelligence off for any length of time,
this is an excellent flick.
The gore & the nudity are the real stars here.
But if you need substance, story, and character development,
I would seriously look else where.

MORAL OF THE STORY:
Hell hath no fury, like a mothers scorn.",1222387200,5,2271,4.984168865435357
3465052,3,B001AR0D6I,"Legendary horror filmmaker Dario Argento returns as writer and director, the man has definitely made a name for himself for his mischievous flair and touch of the macabre. MOTHER OF TEARS: The Third Mother is the supposed third installment in his ""Three Mothers"" trilogy which began with ""Suspiria"" and its follow up ""Inferno"". Now, the question on everyone`s mind; is it worth the wait after more than 2 decades?

When an ancient artifact becomes uncovered in an old cemetery, it proves to be the harbinger of doom. The murder of an art historian is just the beginning as Sarah Mandy (Asia Argento) is caught up in a frightening situation that she doesn't have the knowledge to grasp. Sarah is pursued by forces beyond her understanding and she enlists the aid of museum specialist Michael Pierce but he proves ineffective. Amidst the widespread chaos that ensues in Rome, Sarah then approaches a local exorcist and even an alchemist for aid in hopes of uncovering the mystery of her mother and her connection to a coven of evil witches. Mother Lachrimarum (Moran Atias) has risen and plans to orchestrate the second fall of Rome unless Sarah can find her hidden power and stop this dark witch.

The Italian maestro of horror returns to his tale of witchcraft, chaos, evil and darkness. Part of me is very pleased that the legendary horror director had stepped up to finish his ""witches"" trilogy. After the very disappointing ""The Card Player"", one wouldn't be hard-pressed to think that he has lost his touch but thankfully, his ""Masters of Horror"" entry ""Pelts"" did have its moments and it gave hints that Argento still had it. Thankfully, amazon friends Puzzle Box and Dave K. have caused me to lower my expectations, nothing could compare to ""Suspiria"", which is arguably Argento's finest film, so I approached this film with an open mind. While ""Mother of Tears"" may somehow fit the trilogy, if you elevate your expectations, it may result in a timid laughter.

The film does start fairly strong. The discovered ancient artifact is an interesting enough concept although it is a hugely unoriginal one. Then again, what could past for a TRULY original horror film anyway these days? Sometimes I feel that Horror filmmaking may have already peaked and it shouldn't be how original a horror film is but what the director does with a concept. The film does have a fair amount of blood and gore, in this unrated version, we get to see more gruesome deaths and nudity. Death by intestine strangling, literally screwing the mouth open, a spear driven to women's vaginal areas, infant slaughter, impalements, all contribute to the film's main draw: ""Brutality"". Argento doesn't hold back when it comes to these elements.

The plot elements does have potential. Sarah's investigation into her past displayed a lot of ambition, accompanied by eerily creepy scenes mildly enhanced by CGI with the old-school blood and gore. I found some elements mildly interesting but unfortunately, these scenes were only used to delay the film's outcome. The proceedings didn't exactly help the film's resolution and I felt that it started running out of gas in the 45 minute mark. I also felt that the chaos caused by the supposed ""rise"" of Mother Lachimarum is severely underused. Where is the army when all these hinted wanton acts of violence, rape and murder is occurring? Some characters were merely plot devices, supporting characters were so unconvincing and once they served their purpose, you guessed it, they will suffer a grisly death. Some scenes were also too convenient.

The dialogue in the film feels a little too perfunctory for my tastes. It just proved too ""card board"" and it isn't helped along by the casts' very ""robotic"" acting. I also wondered whether the film was dubbed in English and was originally meant for another language. The so-called ""Mother of Tears"" was too underwhelming; after all the overlong dialogue and fact-finding, this is how she is finally overcame?  I'm NOT spoiling anything, as you would know that the bad guy has to be beat. I have to admit that Moran Atias' scenes of almost ""very"" nude may be worth the price of the dvd itself.

Ultimately, Dario Argento's heart seems to be in the right place when he made this film. However, it was quite obvious that he was being held back due to the film's measly budget. The blood, guts and gore were very nice to look at, (despite the fact it isn't anything new) and the back story of the ""Three Mothers"" does tie up some loose ends. However, the film does feel that it came straight out of the Hollywood oven and made to fit more ""mainstream"" tastes. Still, the film is a decent dose of lusty, brutal fun that is a welcome change from all the horror remakes we've been plagued with of late. The film does feel quite ridiculous and rather rudimentary. But it's very nice for fans of Dario Argento to witness that the horror legend can still dream up ludicrous mayhem and violent deaths.

3465053,3,B001AR0D6I,"When you've been waiting for something as long as a lot of folks (myself included) have been waiting for ""Mother of Tears,"" there's bound to be some disappointments.  But let's talk about the good stuff first.

From beginning to end, this is clearly a Dario Argento film.  There's some great locations, over-the-top gore, a driving musical score (though this element is somewhat more restrained than it is in the director's now-classic works like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Suspiria/dp/B00005ASOI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Suspiria</a>), mystery and mayhem.

However, being a Dario Argento film, there are also problems which are common to much of his efforts.  The script, while nominally more linear than, say,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inferno/dp/B000KRNG5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inferno</a>, is still fairly disjointed.  And the acting is uniformly bad, with the chief offender being Argento's daughter and frequent star Asia.  I know, she looks great, but the offspring of Italy's most successful horror auteur is NOT a great actress.

The DVD itself offers a few extras of note to Argento fans.  A featurette on the making of the film offers a fascinating glimpse into the director's creative process, as does a brief interview with the man himself.  An Italian teaser trailer and full U.S. trailer round out the extras.

Outside of a sizable cult following, mainstream success has eluded Argento in the U.S.  Sadly, Mother of Tears did not (in its theatrical release, anyway) broaden his audience.  If you're a fan, it may help you to know that Mother of Tears is certainly a cut above his recent films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Card-Player/dp/B0009RQRSS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Card Player</a>&nbsp;and the made-for-t.v.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Do-You-Like-Hitchcock/dp/B000FS2W2Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Do You Like Hitchcock?</a>.  For those who may be uninitiated into the world of Dario Argento, you'll discover a stylish and gory thriller. . .and probably not much else.",1222128000,,2205,6.637630662020906
3465054,3,B001AR0D6I,"At one time Italian cinema was really popular from Crime/Dramas, Westerns and Action flicks, many people don't realize how much influence these films had on filmmakers around the world and the Horror genre might be where the Italians really made a huge impact that can still be seen to this day. But around the mid 80s Italian films started to get weak and many of the great filmmakers have either passed away or making some really bad films and it got to the point to where many of these filmmakers struggled to get funding; the exception was Dario Argento and even to this day many of the filmmakers who are still around barley work anymore and when they do their movies don't see the light of day in the States, but again Dario Argento is the exception.

Dario Argento though has sort of hit a bit of a slump in his career the 90s started off well for him in my opinion with Two Evil Eyes, the criminally underrated Trauma and The Stendhal Syndrome, but after that Argento really started to lose it and made two of his worst films with The Phantom of the Opera and The Card Player. While he did make a slight comeback with the entertaining Jenifer and Pelts for the Masters of Horror and the TV movie Do You Like Hitchcock?

The Three Mothers is Argento's first theatrical flick since The Card Player and is the long awaited follow up to his classics Suspiria and Inferno. Going into The Mother of Tears I hoped for the best, but expected the worst.

The screenplay by Dario Argento, Jace Anderson & Adam Gierasch was rather weak; I suppose the one flaw in Dario Argento as a filmmaker is his writing, but he did write some solid scripts early in his career, but around the time of Suspiria his scripts started to lack a little bit. While I don't think he's a poor writer, but some were lacking. I think the biggest problem is Argento's characters are a little weak. For the most part he's never really had an Iconic character. This time around the script is quite flawed and at times even cringe worthy. The only movie I've seen written by Anderson & Gierasch was Toolbox Murders and I wasn't really impressed and I'm not very impressed here.

While Mother of Tears isn't terribly written, but the script does often lack and is never really all that interesting and the characters are very much lacking. There are some good ideas, but nothing that really works for the most part. While not a terrible script it does overall lack.

As director there really isn't anything Argento about this movie; visually the movie looks good, but don't except Suspiria or Inferno. The visual side is pretty much toned down and doesn't look nearly as good as most of Argento's movies. Also lacking is the use of colors, which is the biggest flaw with the movie. The suspense and tension do lack and honestly Mother of Tears sort of has a DTV feel to it for the most part. Also Mother of Tears feels much more like an American production. I've always been a big fan of Italian cinema; I love the style and look of their movies, but Mother of Tears really doesn't have that vibe. It really does feel like more of an American production.

I've been waiting to see Mother of Tears for quite a while now and it really wasn't worth the wait, but with that said it wasn't horrible or anything, just lackluster. At this point in Argento's career you can't really expect another Bird with the Crystal Plumage or Suspiria. The best you can hope for is an entertaining flick and for the most part Mother of Tears is semi entertaining. The first half of Mother of Tears was for the most part good, but the 2nd half is where it starts to slump and does drag and the final act drags big time. The ending was so anti-climatic and quite idiotic.

The highlights of the movie were seeing Daria Nicolodi back in an Argento flick; they were in a relationship for a long time and when that ended they stopped working together. The last time Daria appeared in an Argento flick was Opera back in 1987. While the role was brief it was still great for fans of Argento. Asia Argento works with her father again as actress and director for the first time since 1998 with the amazingly horrid Phantom of the Opera. Asia gives a pretty good performance, but some her dialogue was rather terrible at times and that makes it tough to sell, but overall I don't have many complaints with Asia's performance.

Overall Mother of Tears is fairly decent, but very lackluster. The first half was fairly good, but the 2nd half is where things start to go down the drain. Though I suppose it could have been a lot worse seeing as many of the filmmakers from Argento's era have gone on to make some really horrible flicks. Mother of Tears never really shows what made Argento such a brilliant director, but it's nowhere near as poor as Phantom of the Opera or The Card Player. Keep your expectations low and you might enjoy it a bit more.

The visual side and use of colors were lacking big time and had those played a part of the movie it would helped, but for what it's worth Mother of Tears is watchable, but forgettable. Mother of Tears gets a very light 3-stars.",1221609600,4,5115,4.473740621650589
8278916,5,B001AR0D6I,"Mother of tears.... By far is. Way better than inferno and stands out. As one of Dario Argento's best films since his 1992 film the Stendhal syndrome. Which also was with his daughter Asia Argento in which they collaborated in in 1992. This is the third and I believe final film in the 3 mothers trilogy the reason why I said I think is I don't know if they plan to do another one. I don't really have anything bad to say about this movie, I really enjoy it to me. It seems like Argento has come more into. the way files are produced and done now instead of the way his films were done in the 70s and 80s. Meaning that a lot of his films back then were arc in the sense that they were worn movies with a ton of pa like music for a school instead of. La Rock or top 40. But just music that is not father, some after a while for a just gets old quickly. Because it just doesn't fit with the comments that go on in the film. Meeting his films in the past. And the one thing that I will say that is not necessarily a complaint, but it's just an observation is that I'm sorry I don't remember the name of the character I thought my head is if this is a followup to inferno. And Suspiria. How is the actress is playing her playing in a modern time when it's 30 years later and supposed to be the same age? Also the one thing and this has to do more with Evans on but just bringing it to people's attention due to the fact that we are paying money for this and I know for a fact that dimension extreme does do this once in a while they don't make it mainstream. However, is the mother of tears that they are selling on here actually the are rated on Easter here is because when I bought the wizard of gore, which came out about the same year as this film, did I had to buy it twice to get the unrated because they were releasing certain versions for Wal Mart and for blockbuster when blockbuster was open and then. Other places Amazon orders etc. Or selling the unbraided however if he tried to buy the rated any place other than the 2 places I mentioned they weren't even able to get it so I noticed that Amazon sells edited versions of films on line and not know it until you bring it to their attention. The company wants you to go out and buy the DVD, so thought I'd bring that up in my review because this is not on bluray, which is why I bought the HD of it. But I give this movie 5 stars I really like to I don't have anything bad to say about the film. And if you type in inferno or click on my name, you'll see the last thing I reviewed was inferno and I did not give it a good review well, a great review. I should say I did give it an ok review. So I recommend it, I guess, also recommend that maybe google the time on the braided version and unrated and see if theres any difference because Amazon sometimes has the wrong image of. And right now, its too late and I don't care. Because I already spent the 8 dollars.",1518739200,,2921,3.986348122866894
