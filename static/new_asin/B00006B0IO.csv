7966789,4,B00006B0IO,Haven't had a chance to go through the various riffs yet but look forward to doing just that .. many thanks,1381708800,,107,4.142857142857143
7966790,1,B00006B0IO,"VHS QUALITY NO QUALITY CONTENT. There is no on screen tablature! Sure the guy can play guitar but as a lesson its terrible. you're better off watching youtube videos of SRV and trying to tab/learn to play yourself.....because thats all this video is. oh wait, except its not SRV!",1377820800,,279,4.714285714285714
7966791,1,B00006B0IO,"I've been playing guitar for almost 15 years - I've always had trouble playing lead, so was hoping to pick up some instructional material to help me finally throw down a lick or two at the local guitar shop when I want to try out a new axe.

Well, this DVD wasn't it - that is, there was no 'instruction' at all.  Here's how it goes...

1.  Watch guy who is way better than you play a SRV lick.
2.  Watch him play it a little bit slower.
3.  Repeat 49 more times.
4.  Turn off amp, put down guitar, hang head and walk away.

I didn't expect to watch the DVD once and all the sudden be able to play like SRV, but I was hoping to at least make bit of progress or find something encouraging.  Oh, and to boot - the 'Tabs' section of the DVD is out of sync with the music playing behind it.  So the 'instructor' doesn't tell me what he's playing, and I can't read the tabs of what he's playing, so...

My recommendation?  Look elsewhere - perhaps in Andy Aledort's direction.  Not only can that guy play... he can teach.",1200268800,4,1016,4.070707070707071
7966792,1,B00006B0IO,"I bought a copy, and I rented a copy on Netflix ... both had the ""50 Blazing Riffs"" version on the disc (a version I already had).  I was quite miffed that I spent a lot of money and time getting this just to find out that the people making it have crossed up (apparently) a lot of these and printed them on the wrong discs and put them in the wrong jackets.  Buyer Beware!!",1174953600,,374,3.973333333333333
7966793,1,B00006B0IO,"Well -- I guess you get your fifty licks.  Mitchell, who can obviously play, stands in front of a console and plays SRV licks and riffs at approximately recorded tempi, and then plays them again somewhat slowly.  He offers no commentary, no technical explanations or advise, and doesn't identify what it is that he's playing.  Useless.

Oh, and dig -- you *can't* fast forward through five or so insufferable mintutes of advertising before you can access the menu.  HUH???  And to make life just a *teeny* bit more difficult, you gotta go to some website to print out the tab.  I guess twenty bucks doesn't buy printing and a couple of sheets of paper any more.

Instructional snake oil.",1170806400,3,687,4.714285714285714
7966794,1,B00006B0IO,"There are one or two useful licks on the DVD. But since the publishers were too damn lazy to put in more detailed markers/indices you have to scroll the licks too many times from the beginning. Thus you cannot loop one single lick in order to repeat it while you rehearse along with it. No camera on the picking hand - they let you figure it out. Home video quality - VHS simply transfered to DVD in order to make a buck or two. If zoomed to full screen you get more pixels than picture - pathetic. I should have read the other reviews before buying - will do next time :-(

DO NOT TOUCH...",1142985600,7,590,4.130434782608695
7966795,1,B00006B0IO,"I could not be more dissappointed. Stay far away, from this and I'd guess any such dvd. This guys idea of a SRV blazing riff is one and two note phrases any bonehead with a guitar could figure out. Nothing useful at all.",1139702400,6,220,4.1395348837209305
7966796,1,B00006B0IO,"I bought this because I was new to guitar and wanted to know how to play ""Pride and Joy"". The sheet music and notes for this song are wrong and how to play it is wrong and the rest of the riffs are silly at best. I finally went with a Hal Leonard book and trashed this poorly made video. Is there any way to give Zero stars as a rating?",1134000000,6,336,3.7464788732394365
