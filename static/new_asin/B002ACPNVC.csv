 However, this video is one of the worst martial arts DVD's that I have purchased.

In one clip as the instructor is explaining a technique, he stops and video is cut to another clip, without a complete explanation of the last technique.",1502409600,,330,4.559322033898305
8359324,4,B002ACPNVC,"This DVD is pretty good, however, you need to look at it with open mind. What I mean by that is, you can analyse the moves where if you are learning Silat from other instructors or if you buy the other DVDs of this professor, you may be able to put it together into your combinations. The quality of the production is not that great, since it was being filmed on the spot and the partner did not have the coordination correct for the filming. Sound was affected for parts of the recording. All in all, you can get something out of this.",1403568000,2,536,4.213592233009709
