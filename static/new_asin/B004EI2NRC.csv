8426962,4,B004EI2NRC,"The saying ""Be careful what you pray for"" comes true for one character who prays for the strength to get through one final evening with her husband and ends up getting through a lot more than that. The ""plans"" in this film are all based on relationships, with synchronicity and chance throwing ironic unpredictability into futures all mapped out. Mostly the characters meet the sudden shifts in fortune with resilience, often coming to understand that what they want and what they need are two very different things. The outcomes they didn't plan for are frequently far more fulfilling than the myopic vision they had set their hearts on.
There is humor for the viewer who knows more than the characters and can spot the irony of their blindness or ignorance. There are also satisfying moments when characters rise above venal behavior to achieve a certain nobility. Watch for the scene in which the daughter who has repudiated her father catches him dancing to old sixties pop songs with the father-substitute she has married.
This is a light film, but with more depth than a bedroom farce. It is enjoyable viewing.",1393545600,,1116,4.878947368421053
8426963,4,B004EI2NRC,"This French comedy shows a family and friends during two dinner parties a year apart.  Both nights are during the Fte de la musique during the summer solsice, so the streets are crowded.  Families are in trouble, friends are having affairs with each other, and some have deadly diseases.  A year later, and various issues are resolved, mostly.",1379548800,,343,4.879310344827586

8426965,3,B004EI2NRC,"I'm being generous by awarding this film three stars.  The truth is that I didn't really like it but I did sit through the whole thing.  I am a sucker for anything French and this was set in Paris...there is a stunning shot of the Eiffel Tower at night, all lit up, and another brief one of the Arch of Triumph.  Apparently the characters in the film live in a good location.  Another nice thing is the background which is a city wide street music festival that looks like a lot of fun.  Another good element is the final scene with a Flamenco dancer in great costumes.  I'm trying hard to find justification for my high score.

There are some good actors, I guess.  My problem with the film is the really dopey script.  It tries to be clever and I suppose some people will find it so.  A group of middle aged people have love affairs with other people, some married, some not.  They change partners in the midst of the film for various reasons, a surprise pregnancy, a crippling accient.  People find different jobs and lose them... It's one of those ideas that sounds good on paper but didn't work out very well. Most of the characters are just not very likable and I couldn't really care about them.  Save your money.",1351814400,,1220,4.392857142857143
8426966,5,B004EI2NRC,"This is a very entertaining and clever movie, with quite touching moments of serious observations. The humor permeated throughout, in typical French fashion, a melange of sarcasm, causticity, lightness and sincerity. You need to be alert to comprehend who has an affair with whom, as this group befriends each other on one day in June every year. The acting is perfect, the women are elegant and beautiful, the flamenco dancer is passionate and impressive, and the two old guys dancing together to the tune of Paul Anka is simply hilarious! This is a refreshing film. Enjoy!",1299888000,10,574,4.989583333333333
