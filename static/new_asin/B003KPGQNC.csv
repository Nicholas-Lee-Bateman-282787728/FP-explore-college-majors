4133982,5,B003KPGQNC,"I never get enough of watching this DVD.  I am fortunate enough to have been able to visit the Island every spring (before the hordes arrive) and I take the time to explore the interior on my bike.  Yes, the town is small but very interesting and the Grand is everything it's name implies, but the true treasure here is the history and geology and the interior is so interesting.  This DVD is very well written and edited and the photography is great!  Purchase it if you can, and enjoy it for a lifetime!  It is one of my all time favorites!",1412467200,2,542,4.2745098039215685
4133983,5,B003KPGQNC,this dvd brings back the wonders of Mackinac Island and shows how beautiful and unique it is even in the dead of winter,1360886400,3,119,4.217391304347826
4133984,5,B003KPGQNC,"For anyone who has ever dreamed about living on Mackinac Island -- or those of us too afraid of the winters there -- this is a revelation.  Beautifully filmed, humorous, compelling...this shows the true Mackinac Island.  I've watched this over and over, and never get tired of the little things they show, like the cat jumping over the snow drifts, or the steam on the lake.  But, I bought mine on Mackinac Island, where it was much, much cheaper.  Still, if you can't get there, buy this video.  If there is a drawback, it might be that the film was a bit too long.",1360281600,6,566,4.403846153846154
4133985,5,B003KPGQNC,"This is a Great Video on the Beautiful Island of Mackinac.. I Love this Video, I recieved it in Great Condition in a Fast and Timely Manner..

4133986,5,B003KPGQNC,"I live in Michigan, and this dvd sells for $20 to $25 dollars here. I picked it up while in the U.P., great video, narration, all of it is awesome. I can't see paying what Amazon has it listed for when I/you can get it here in Mi. so cheap, do some online checking. It is well worth watching/having don't get me wrong, but that price is a bit overdone.",1350777600,22,352,4.042857142857143
4133987,5,B003KPGQNC,"I am a year round resident of Mackinac and, without a doubt, this is the best view of what life is like here. You get to see far more than some travel promotion video would EVER show. My parents keep a copy of this film to show to friends when they want to know what our life is like up here. HIGHLY recommended!",1319155200,10,312,3.9682539682539684

8398859,5,B003KPGQNC,"As a Michigander who frequents the U.P. regularily, this opens the window to all of us to the changes of seasons and the exclusion of winter on the island. Love seeing the snowmobiles casually ride from land to lake and back again. I want to ride a snowmobile across Lake Superior/Huron so bad!! Thank you for this!",1515283200,,315,4.543859649122807
