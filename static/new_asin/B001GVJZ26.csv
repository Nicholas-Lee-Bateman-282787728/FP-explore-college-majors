3621721,5,B001GVJZ26,Do you like pinball? If you do then this is a documentary for you. Lots of great information and done in an entertaining way.,1279756800,2,125,4.25
3621722,5,B001GVJZ26,"I think I own all the different pinball DVDs, even some hard to find ones.  I like them all for their contribution to pinball, and they all seem to compliment each other pretty well with only some content overlap.

Where other documentaries focus only on one topic of pinball (ie: history, or pinball 2000, or players in competition, etc.), This DVD is unique in that it takes you through the world of pinball step-by-step, introducing you to the people who are in-the-know and let them tell the story.  While it is not the most flashy of movies, it certainly hits the bar and achieves the purpose of expressing what passion means to the people in the pinball culture and along the way tickles the passion I have for the hobby.

I wasn't going to review this, but after I read the one star review here, I had to chime in.  If one thing pinball has, it is a fair share of out-spoken negative naysayers.  Basically, the reviewer rated it one star because it was not the dvd he wished it was going to be.  Yes, I agree the second disk feels more like an after thought, but that is always the case with most 2 discs, I don't let that detour me form enjoying the main movie.

So, don't be disappointed, this story does not explore only one narrow topic in depth but rather walks you through the world of pinball in a broader overview, some history, some contributors, a rare candid interview with Gary Stern of STERN pinball and many others.  Anyone new to pinball or any old pro who wants - no - NEEDS more pinball, I think will enjoy this movie even if they know it all already.

I am hard pressed to pick one pinball documentary as my favorite, and I won't.  However, when I host a party, this is the dvd I play on loop in the game room.  And further, this is the DVD I purchase as gifts, quite a few times now.  So...what ever that is worth, buy with confidence.",1277683200,11,1861,4.328530259365994
3621723,1,B001GVJZ26,"2 short DVD's with almost the same content. The only part i enjoyed was the tour around the Stern factory. There are only interviews on these dvd's telling you how great pinball is and why you must love pinball. I already love pinball so they don't have to explain that to me. I was curious about the evolution and history about pinball, but the only thing they mentioned was when the first flipper was invented and some other inrelevent info for me.

So don't expect to actually see some pinball action on these discs.

waste of money.",1265760000,3,536,4.515463917525773
3621724,5,B001GVJZ26,"I picked up this DVD on a whim since I just purchased my first pinball table (Star Trek: The Next Generation, for the curious). I had low expectations, since it had no reviews and I'd never heard of it. I'd watched the ""Tilt"" documentary, which I liked. ""Pinball Passion"" is just as enjoyable. Its scope is broader, examining the intrinsic appeal of pinball as compared to video games; 3D physics-based gameplay, no digital patterns to memorize, etc. It also does a good job of conveying the mechanical complexity of a table's inner workings, with respect paid to the engineers that bring them to life. The rising scale and budget of pinball tables through the decades is well illustrated. It doesn't discuss Pinball 2000 at all, but it does cross paths with ""Tilt"" briefly by exploring whether pinball has a future.

The editing is very well paced, and the camera work is good for a true indie film (it was supposedly made for the cost of two pinball tables). My only complaint is the length. I want more. At 50 minutes, the main feature feels more like a television special than a feature documentary, and there is no topic that couldn't have been explored deeper. That said, there is a commentary mode, and a second disc that contains extended interviews.

All in all, I really enjoyed this disc. It is a great primer and tribute to the hobby of playing/collecting pinball tables. The interviews are well done -- the names will be familiar to fans and collectors, but the discussions are inclusive and accessible. I could see this movie piquing interest of people who previously just didn't ""get"" pinball, and that's an achievement. Well done.",1250899200,22,1646,4.792253521126761
3621725,2,B001GVJZ26,"I gave this 2 stars because, in the main, it is so short I felt completely ripped off; the ""special features"" are neither and equally short. This is about 30 minutes of Gary Stern, the same Sterns who ruined pinball in the late 70s and again in this century, walking through their factory showing all their probably illegal immigrant workers, bragging about how no one is full time (notice how their quality sucks? shocker), Stern drones on like a fool about how they are not the ""last"" pinball builder (clue- you're not) but the ""only"" one (clue- again, you're not), as all these part time temps who know nothing about pinball and couldn't care less build the ugliest, flimsiest, most poorly designed and executed games in the history of pinball. I think there is a colorblind Monkey on acid with crayons in a cage in the back that does the ""art"" work. DO NOT buy this dvd ever, under any circumstances, it is a complete waste of money, unless you consider watching gary the hack stern pull his own pud for 30 solid minutes trying to convince himself how great and what a gatekeeper he is- he is a hack and a fool, and as transparent as they come.",1394841600,,1148,4.497607655502392
3621726,3,B001GVJZ26,"Not a long, animation/narration/information filled documentary.  This is a collection of interviews done (in about 2006) relating to the pinball manufacturing/playing/collecting society.  There is no narrative or history offered.  No specific angle or opinion given from the film makers' point of view.  They let the cameras roll and the interviewees speak.  It is a nice watch for those of you who know a little about the pinball community and pinball's history.  You will see interviews from individuals you will recognize from internet forums, pinball shows, pinball publications and collecting.  You get to see Wayne Neyens and Alvin Gottlieb speak, if you never had the chance, along with others whose interviews have been recorded in the longer more in depth documentaries on pinball.

If you are new to pinball or unfamiliar with its past,  you will find this movie quite dry.  A bunch of engineers, designers and collectors talking about pinball.  It would be best for you to at least watch one of the other more in depth documentaries first.  I did enjoy this short film, as a rental, but not enough to purchase at this time.  If you are a pinball enthusiast, like me, I'm sure you will enjoy it once, anyway.",1382918400,,1218,4.97029702970297
3621727,5,B001GVJZ26,If your into pinball then you'll enjoy this movie. Happy to see this type of content for the enthusiast or hobbyist.,1378944000,,116,4.571428571428571
3621728,3,B001GVJZ26,"My wife bought this for me as a gift.  We have 20+ pinballs in our collection, so you would think I would love something like this.  Special When Lit was very well made, but showcased the ""weird"" side of pinball.  Fine for me, but not something you can show your friends.  Tilt The Battle to Save Pinball was also well made, but focused on the Pin2000 saga.  As for this movie, well, what was it really?  I can't put my finger on it.  I felt this movie was really short.  I don't know if its because they didn't have enough footage, or because they got tired of making their movie.  It wasn't great.  It was ok. If you like pinball, you'll get something out of these DVDs, but not much. You're better off watching the past seminars from pinball expos and shows that are floating out there for free.

The best parts of this DVD set were the interviews with some of the not often interviewed Alvin G and his son, and the interview with Wayne Neyens on the extra ""ball 2"" dvd.  There wasn't enough with Dennis Nordman, Steve Richie and Pat Lawlor.  Seeing Tim Arnold talk about his collection was sad, knowing how his health has declined since this film was made.

The worst parts were the misspellings.  Seriously guys?

As a pinball person, what I want to see is a movie with some of the people behind the scenes.  Like a Operator documentary would be fantastic.  How about Marvin and his museum, or Shaggy and Norm?  Or follow Gary Flower around for a while to see how boring his life is outside of pinball.  Just something different would be great, and this movie was not something different. I know, there is no money in making pinball movies, as these guys found out if you listen to their commentary.  I'm sure they'll be glad if you give them their $1.99 to rent it on Amazon prime.

I guess that's about all there is to say about it.  Meh.",1371600000,2,1845,4.3617647058823525
3621729,5,B001GVJZ26,A good video about the history of pinball. There are numerous interviews with pinball designers about some of the popular pinball games.,1368921600,,136,5.2272727272727275

3621734,3,B001GVJZ26,"The question I had was how does this compare to the other pinball movies out there?  So I finally rented it.

There is a kind of trilogy so far of recent pinball movies that I've been recommending.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TILT-The-Battle-to-Save-Pinball-Two-Disc-Set/dp/B000OV967S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TILT: The Battle to Save Pinball (Two-Disc Set)</a>&nbsp;is still the best, a very absorbing tale of the Pinball 2000 attempt to save Williams, with lots of great stuff on the second DVD as well.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Only-Interstellar-Pinball-Lives-Forever/dp/B003U4VGII/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Only Interstellar Pinball Lives Forever</a>&nbsp;is a very strange puppet movie that I really like, definitely not for everyone, but it's obvious that the filmmaker loves pinball and pinball designers.  For the third movie, probably get Special When Lit, but you can swap its place with Pinball Passion, depending on which is less expensive, since they are very similar to one another (even though Special is more of a complete movie).",1314835200,2,1495,7.429378531073446

8307268,2,B001GVJZ26,"This was purchased as a gift for me 2-3 years ago.  I couldn't really remember how it was so I just watched it again.  Unfortunately in 2015 it's simply not good.  This was completed around 2008, but doesn't not support widescreen????  You have to stretch it.  The accompanying music is horrible.  If you ever have a chance to watch this, you'll understand what I mean about the music.  I just noticed that the discs are DVD-R's and not even a ""pressed"" disc.  Who knows what media they are burned onto and what kind of life they will have.  It's short which is a bonus.  You have some Pinball Pro's wasting time comparing pinball to video games which in my opinion is just ridiculous.  Who cares what peoples opinion are on the differences?  They should have provided their opinions on the difference between pinball and Icelandic ice fishing.  I would have gave this one star, but there were a few ""bits"" of pinball info I didn't already know so at least I learned a few (not great) things.  It would be tough recommending anyone to buy this at $10 shipped.",1442016000,,1059,4.534391534391534
8307269,2,B001GVJZ26,"Before the review, I see that people say there's a commentary track. But I can't see any commentary track option when I play through Amazon Prime. Am I just out of luck, or is there some option that I'm missing? Same with Trollhunters: the soundtrack is in Danish, and to get the English dubbing I had to order the DVD through Netflix. What's up?

Sad. Pinball was, for a while, it's sad to admit, my life. I was the biggest fish in my small pond when it came to ability. But as time went on and pinball became more electronified and more complicated, you had to invest more and more money into a machine to figure it out, to know what your goals were at any given point in the game. (Maybe hundreds of dollars.) Eventually it was too much work, no fun at all, and I gave up. Also sad is that, as the biz has become more competitive, they had to start really screwing their employees--as they themselves admit--to stay alive. That may be necessary for their survival, but I don't want to support keeping employees on call and outsourcing. Better to just let the whole thing die and remain as a memory. The documentary was a bland lot of talking heads saying bland things.",1429315200,,1171,4.3963133640553
