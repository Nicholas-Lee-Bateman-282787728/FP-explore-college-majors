8169354,3,B000MIONNA,"1984 concert from New Orleans shows the craft and showmanship of Kool and the Gang. James ""JT"" Taylor is a talented performer and Michael Ray is just as sparkling.  Warning: if DVD is from a Brazilian source, this show is a copy of the VHS tape released in 1984 and not remixed or remastered; clarity and sound is poor, and there is an obvious omission on the DVD. ""In the Heart"" on the VHS tape was deleted and you can see where they skipped over the number.  Too bad, Clifford Adams had a duet with JT on the chorus. 4 stars for the concert; but only 2 stars for the DVD. Try and buy the VHS original instead.",1180310400,5,611,4.169491525423729
8169355,4,B000MIONNA,"I originally bought this in VHS tape at Blockbuster in New Orleans. It was lost during Hurricane Katrina. This concert was taped in 1984 during the Louisiana World Exposition (World's Fair) at the ampitheatre which is now the Morial Convention Center.  It was a great show and everyone had a great time. J T Taylor was his usual great self, but also putting on a great show was New Orleans own Michael Ray, who now performs with his own group called Michael Ray and the Cosmic Krewe.  This DVD is worth every penny and will give K&G fans something to treasure for a long time.  AWB",1173139200,5,581,4.462264150943396
