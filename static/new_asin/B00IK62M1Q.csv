That's better then most on here, i mean  i usually quit after 5 minutes they're so bad. All this is, is an ultra cut rate  version of bangkok dangerous with some really pathetic dialog that reminds you of a skit performed by school students. The cast would probably be ok if you wrote a better script without such cheesy ridiculous dialog.and without so many pathetic scenes. These guys have potential to make cool movies but you can't write stuff like a high school skit, etc.",1523318400,,574,4.617647058823529

8642932,1,B00IK62M1Q,This film suffers from a level of amateurism that makes it unwatchable. This is sad given how terrific other films from Africa are and especially given the level of talent there.  Tough to ignore such bad directing.,1498348800,,215,4.8108108108108105
8642933,3,B00IK62M1Q,"This is an interesting and informative movie based in Nigeria about a martial artist who is hired to kill African leaders who are reportedly committed to keeping their people down. the assassin kills several leaders, and one day comes across a homeless man who is being abused and almost killed. He saves the young man, takes him home and trains him to kill. and he tells the man why he is killing political leaders, Then there is a twist in the plot when the assassin meets the final man on the list to be killed and has a conversation with him about what he is doing. The leader tells him that he is killing the wrong men and that they are committed to helping their people. With this new information, the assassin goes after the man who hired him to kill African leaders. The theme of this movie is based on what is happening in Africa today and the struggle between those who want to help Africans live a better life and those who want to oppress their people.

8642934,4,B00IK62M1Q,"For a Nigerian film, I have to take my hats off for the filmmakers. They did a fantastic job. Best Nollywood film I've seen so far. And they shot this in 2010? Very impressive. A bit slow at the beginning but once it takes off, it was worth the wait.",1483142400,,250,4.02

8642937,1,B00IK62M1Q,"Emmanuel (George Davidson) is a Nigerian hitman. He eventually recruits Samuel (Leo U. Che) to help carry out Government assassinations on orders given to him by a contractor (GuGu E. Michaels, also writer/director and a guy who owes me $2.00) through a woman (Akeyno) who gives him the ""Mission Impossible"" speech because a tape recorder was beyond the budget.

The accent made film watching nearly impossible. The film moved at a slow awkward pace with character build up arranging from none to poor. Emmanuel works out and manages to do one push-up before the camera cuts away and then we get to see him do that same push up again. The skip a scene technique is not wasted as we see Emmanuel on top of an escalator and then the scene jumps to the bottom. All this so he can bump into a guy and stab him. Sometime he works out so he can drop poison into a glass.

The choreographed Samuel training gives the FF button a real work out, and I felt as tired after it as I was watching the one push up over and over. This is a film that one minute into it, I could tell I wouldn't like it and begged God for it to either get better or my DVD player to break. No luck. Complete hell.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. Brief sex. No nudity. The biggest groan was that this was originally called ""Chapter One""  and paves the way for a sequel, one that can't possibly be worse.",1404518400,2,1362,4.329411764705882
