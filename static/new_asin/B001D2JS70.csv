3522899,2,B001D2JS70,Show apprears very staged and scripted. As if they are acting and not living. There are. Very obvious scenes that look staged. It is bad reality show acting. Love these ladies hate the show.,1394841600,,190,4.617647058823529
3522900,4,B001D2JS70,"I enjoyed watching. Although it's another reality show, I love seeing religious people show that they are the same as anyone else.  I look forward to the rest of the season.",1394323200,,173,4.580645161290323
3522901,4,B001D2JS70,"Tina, and sometimes Erica, need to stop using the Lord's name in vain! People who really know the Bible will understand this. Jesus name is to be used for praying to the Father, not to be using while yelling at daughter, etc. I have a relative who used to do it. Also, there is too much arguing going on. When a man is left alone too long, he may or will cheat. The Bible says not to deny each other, except with consent. Your body is not your own in marriage, but belongs to each other. Denying this will cause one or the other to stray! I watch the show mainly for the singing and will also be glad when the Sheards come back on. L.A. Preachers was interesting at times also.  I was trying to watch the latest episode through Comcast and the commercials were longer than the show and I was not able to skip them. They kept showing commercials of that trifling show about couples trying to stay together. I think Tina's husband will have to prove his faithfulness in the future.  She said he was cheating for years, not just one time. One thing though, they do show her telling him that he will have to leave and him walking out with suitcase.  Cheaters don't just cheat on spouse, but on the innocent children!  Once saw a reality type show where the Asian guy's wife started dating a Black man. After a breakup with man and a baby by him, the husband tried being around the child, but just could not anymore and finally left. I just wish they could put Christian type shows on a Christian channel, not WETV, BET, etc.",1394150400,,1520,4.304195804195804
3522902,5,B001D2JS70,They are good Chistians women living life for the lord. I love watching them and their everyday lives. Praises for positive balck woman doing their thing.,1393977600,,154,4.961538461538462
3522903,4,B001D2JS70,It was a great start to a brand new season.  They allowed themselves to become translucent to their fans and it made for a good show,1393891200,,132,4.076923076923077
3522904,5,B001D2JS70,"Well, the Mary's are at it again, but this season is even more fierce with life's endless drama.  In season 3 Mary Mary battle a number of personal and business issues and must find their way to solid ground.  Tina finds out that her husband has been unfaithful, Erica is struggling with health issues and trying to find a way to balance the Mary's and solo career, their father battling cancer and Manager Mitch....on the way out!  One thing we can't deny is the honesty of these young ladies who are willing to show all of the ups and downs of a career in the music industry.  All that glitters isn't gold, but when they get up on that stage, God is undeniably present and they can't help but to run straight to their heart wrenching destiny. Definitely a must see!",1393804800,,767,4.418439716312057
3522905,5,B001D2JS70,"The show is great. I have watched all of season 1 and 2 and dare not to miss any episode of season 3. I love to sing. Erika and Tina inspires me to pursue my dreams of being an artist. I have written about 14 songs, recorded a single and one album which has room for improvement. Hats off to Warren for being such a talented writer and producer of music. My son is pursuing the same thing. He actually attends Daytona State College. Music is all in my family.",1393632000,,459,4.111111111111111
3522956,5,B001D2JS70,"I love these ladies because they keep it real! I am a Christian and although I feel a strong responsibility to allow people to see Jesus in me, I know that I am only human and still struggle at some issues in my life and I want people to know that it is okay to be real and vulnerable and call on Jesus for his strength to  make it through what ever test or trial I am going through.  I know that Tina will get through this and come out on top.",1398211200,,444,3.8152173913043477

3522959,5,B001D2JS70,"Mary Mary does everything with good character and integrity, even though they are having an human experience they don't allow that to bind them up. I see that they are in pursuit of Lord Jesus ways.",1397433600,,198,4.527777777777778
3522960,1,B001D2JS70,"I really think that both Mary's should sit down and find the God in them. Mitch be  glad they let you go. Now it's time for you to go find some professionals to manage. Cause these two women, have put God on the shelf. Really Tina, you put your business in Ebony, now you want to run and hide from the public, you should have got on your knees and prayed, and saw a therapist.

3522965,5,B001D2JS70,"I'd rather see Christian reality any day of the week. Erica and Tina show the reality of living as a Christian in every aspect. Very real, raw emotions that everybody experiences at some point in their lives and as Real Christians know and understand, We are Not Perfect!  If we were, well then Jesus died in vain! We as Christians Striving to live a perfect life, because of the Holy Ghost that lives within us.",1394841600,,412,4.493333333333333

8291359,5,B001D2JS70,"I understand that Mary Mary the Christian group are trying to be real with integrity, but you don't show it much with poor Mitchell. I feel so bad for him. You can't just say what you want to a person and expect a relationship to work. Oh my goodness, Tina you are all over the place, why is Mitchell the reason for the loss of your finances when you refuse to work when asked to at times? I just had to say that... I love you guys and this show, but you guys are so wrong. It's okay to be real, but be loving and not so selfish. Warren you be instigating alot and I just realized that you are probably trying to increase your ratings to get the audience all worked up. I love you Mitch. Stay Strong.",1468972800,,700,4.043165467625899

8291365,5,B001D2JS70,I love the show and I understand what both sisters were going through. It's not easy having a career and run a household. But with God's help they'll make it through. I'm starting my career in singing after all these years due to fear of failing. Keep doing what God want you to do as individual and together . He'll take care of the rest!,1402012800,,339,4.230769230769231

8291367,5,B001D2JS70,"I was a fan of Mary Mary's music before the show but now I'm a bigger fan because they're inspiring me on a greater level. I've been going through VERY difficult circumstances for almost 2 years so many of the episodes have encouraged me to keep moving forward in faith, hope and expectancy when I REALLY wanted to give up on everything and everybody. Keep it coming ladies....this world is in desperate times and need to see great examples in the midst of SO much mess on tv!!!",1399075200,,478,4.443181818181818
