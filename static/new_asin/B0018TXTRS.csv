8271138,1,B0018TXTRS,"My daughter loves everything about dogs, so as one of her Christmas presents I said she could pick 10 dog movies to download.  This was one of the movies she chose.  Little did I realize that I was paying $4 for TEN MINUTES of poor acting and no plot.
The entire movie:  A car drops a dog off in a neighborhood and drives away.  A man sees the dog, talks to it for a minute and it follows him home.  He tells the dog to leave because his wife hates dogs.  The dog stays.  The next morning the dog is still there.  When he gets home after work he brings the dog in because it looks hungry.  His wife becomes angry and he makes her put the dog out.  She does, they argue.  The next day when he comes home the dog is gone and he says he is going to leave her.  He enters the house to find her playing with the dog. End of movie",1451433600,,824,3.8682634730538923

8271140,5,B0018TXTRS,"This is such a sweet, uplifting movie about the soul-healing power of animals.

If you live in the San Francisco Bay area, you'll undoubtedly recognize the lead actor as the guy who plays ""Clip the Clipper Card"" in those public transit commercials. Turns out he's a wonderful actor even without the big, blue foam suit ;-)",1400889600,,322,4.75
8271141,5,B0018TXTRS,"We are interested in doing a little hunting and wanted to buy a dog to hunt with.  But because we're not very experienced with gun dogs we went looking for books or videos that could help us out.  Well, this one sure DID!  It was just what we were looking for.

The material was written and presented by really experienced, very knowledgeable men.  Guys who have spent their lives hunting, and writing about it, and training dogs, and hunting behind LOTS of different kinds of dogs.  They know gun dogs backwards and forwards and from the middle both ways.

They explained the 4 basic types of hunting dogs with specific breed representatives of each type, how each type hunts (to my surprise they're NOT all the same), what their strengths are, and what can be problematic about each breed or type.

Originally we had borrowed this from our library.  But we liked it so much (and we kept learning more each time we watched it) that we bought a copy for our own library.  (Thanks Amazon for having the best price out there!)

We can highly recommend this video, especially for people who are not very experienced with gun dogs.  Before you make a 12 - 15 year committment to a hunting dog you really SHOULD watch this vid.  Happy hunting!!!",1299456000,2,1240,4.5565610859728505
