Textbook writer marries on the rebound after being dumped by his fiancee, but then she returns to England after marriage and a three-year absence having realized shed made a mistake. This is a bittersweet and intelligent story with first-rate acting from Walter Pidgeon and Deborah Kerr, and all others, actually. (A young Janet Leigh plays a significant part in this film.)
