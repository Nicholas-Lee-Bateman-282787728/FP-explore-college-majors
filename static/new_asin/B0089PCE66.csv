5144742,5,B0089PCE66,"This is an excellent, safe workout. It's slow paced, but within 15-20 minutes, I was breaking a sweat. It really firms you up quickly. I've been doing Sahra's mother's workouts, Classical Stretch, for years now, and felt I wanted more. This fits the bill. I am a healthy 64-years old, and I feel that I can do Essentrics and Classical Stretch as long as I'm vertical, so to speak, which is definitely not true of some other exercise programs I've tried, particularly The Firm. I like that Essentrics is based on what dancers do, rather than what gym rats do; ladies want to look long, lean and graceful; working with weights (yes, even low weight with high reps) bulked me up and caused me to gain a lot of weight. So I stick with Lotte Berk, Bar Method, Pilates and Essentrics, because they give me the results I want. Of all of those, I find Essentrics most enjoyable.",1411862400,103,870,4.512658227848101
5144743,5,B0089PCE66,"Sahra is personable and elegant at the same time.  The whole production is very professional, the music is good, and the scenery of Montreal in the background is awesome.  This workout is not difficult but effective and I felt great afterwards.",1403395200,28,244,4.926829268292683

5144766,5,B0089PCE66,"This is very similar to the warmi-up moves I learned as a professional dancer. It's a nice complement to yoga or weights. It's safe, low-impact and my body feels better when I do it!",1470787200,6,182,4.382352941176471
5144767,5,B0089PCE66,"Love this.  I just can't explain how good it feels to STRETCH every muscle.  I have a bad knee and have to be careful with moves, but the moves in this DVD don't bother my knee at all.  There is NO impact, (no bouncing, dancing, etc...).  I really enjoy this and find it very relaxing!",1462838400,9,285,4.127272727272727
5144768,3,B0089PCE66,"This dvd is preformed by The daughter of the founder. I have a hard time taking her seriously. The original classical stretch is not bad but, when you listen to her daughter in this dvd, she tries to sound like her mother and it just doesn't fly with me.",1461628800,3,254,4.204081632653061
5144769,5,B0089PCE66,"I have enjoyed Miranda Esmonde-White's TV series videos for Classical Stretch & do the exercises faithfully. They are short enough, 25 minutes,  that it is easy to fit into my day. I bought her daughter's one hour video to do once a week for a longer workout. It is easy to follow & she is good at explaining the moves & doesn't seem to lose count , like Miranda often does. Even though this video is an hour, you can break it up. Classical Stretch is a tremendous way to stretch & strengthen your muscles & I highly recommend it to people of all ages. You will notice a big change to your body.",1459555200,11,595,4.219298245614035
5144770,5,B0089PCE66,"This is not the most physically challenging tape I have, but it is definitely now one of my favorites.  I have been doing P90X, Pure Barre and other videos for years but as I get older (now 49), I am feeling more stiff and less flexible.  This definitely loosens me up and stretches me out.  And I actually enjoy it and look forward to exercise on my Essentrics days.  Sahra gives great cues and guidance.",1453420800,9,405,4.36
5144771,5,B0089PCE66,Love how this DVD encourages stretching in a way I've never experienced before.,1453161600,2,79,5.153846153846154
5144772,5,B0089PCE66,"Great workout- harder than it looks if you really follow her instructions. You will feel strong, toned, flexible and even taller after completing the dvd. Great for loosening joints and posture. It took me a few attempts to master some of the standing floor worked you have to try to watch her while performing the movements. The program is broken into 3 parts- standing floor work, lying floor work and using a chair or barre if you have one. They can be done separately if crunched for time. They use no equipment other than a mat and a chair.  I have since bought the entire series as I feel this technique will help me meet my goals of weight loss, toning , and flexibility all while not risking injury. I only wish there was an essentrics class or studio nearby.",1451260800,18,767,4.478571428571429
5144773,4,B0089PCE66,A nice change from fast paced workouts,1448064000,4,38,4.571428571428571
5144774,5,B0089PCE66,"This is my favorite of the Essentrics DVDs. Good music too. Sometimes I do just one segment, some days more. I have been a long time fan of Classical Stretch and now mix it up with Essentrics and work on my Pilates Tower. Sarah is great with cuing and counting, Miranda ( Classical Stretch), not so much. But I am so familiar with the basics that I can learn quickly. I am in my 60's and overweight. Most of my life I was thin and athletic but not lately that's for sure. This program keeps me strong and dowager hump free. So I have muscle under all the fat and I have good posture. This means I can still walk gracefully and don't lumber about, at least most days. I have problems with my hips so the plies are not my favorites. I find that after awhile with standing leg work my feet ache. This form of exercise lengthens and strengthens and, yes, at first it is difficult . Quite difficult! Hugely difficult!  especially when the instructor is perfect, lithe and young! Do not give up! This and any of the other DVDs both Essentrics and Classical stretch will keep you strong and flexible as you age. Do what you can do with the best form you can. Do a little bit a day If that's what you need to do. I am serious. This will change you like nothing else and is the program I come back to again and again. I simply can't recommend it enough. Especially for those of us not so young. When you lose flexibility and muscle as you age you are going down a slippery slope. Now, if I could just figure out how to get those straight, broad shoulders.........",1447718400,14,1554,4.25

 Verified Purchase
I have used this twice now, There is a learning curve for sure, which im still working on. remembering to stretch all the time, and engage my muscles , to get the best toning session I can, I am recovering from a frozen shoulder and I believe that essentrics is really helping me regain my flexibility, slowly but surely. the floor work is good though im still not convinced that 16 reps is as effective as other higher rep floor workouts, though im not so tired or horribly sore , so that is a Good thing. I really can feel the increased blood flow throughout my arms which is evidence that this workout is working like they say , I do the whole hour but you can choose just the standing, floor, or barre work. I also have the Body sculpting dvd and I use these two workouts alternately so far, I think I will also add in the BB sculpt and burn 30 minute floor work routine , maybe once a week. another interesting side note is all day into the evening I can feel much more blood flow throughout my limbs, I didn't have this sensation with other workouts I have done in the past. I am really, really liking this way of getting exercise .",1431993600,16,1224,4.195744680851064

5144802,5,B0089PCE66,"I am totally smitten with this workout. Essentrics is much more flowing and graceful than a barre workout, and I feel like the stretching is far superior. When I first tried it I thought it looked way too easy... until I started to SWEAT. Because of the flowing nature and lack of discomfort, I sort of assumed that I'd do it once and then get bored and move on to something else. But I've been doing this or one of the other Essentrics workouts every day for the past few weeks and I love them more and more. It doesn't take long to work up a thorough sweat, and it's not at all boring. I have to say, though, that you get out of it what you put into it. When she says reach, you better reach like it's going out of style. I think it would be easy to phone it in with this workout. Don't make that mistake! You can get a killer workout with this DVD, and still feel refreshed afterwards.",1419033600,46,888,4.109195402298851

No where near as tight and lumpy when she massages and I can tell such a difference.  I do these 4-5 times a week. I started with the basic DVD's for beginners and got all the moves down.  They are wonderful at explaining what each stretch does and exactly how you need to be doing them which I absolutely loved!!!  If you have tight muscles, or don't like to lift weights, not a gym or class person, this may be the ticket for you.  Certainly has been for me.",1498348800,2,632,4.216666666666667
