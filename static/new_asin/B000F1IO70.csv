2548183,5,B000F1IO70,"Piel Otoo (Autumn Skin - 761 minutes)

Otoo (Autumn) is the on-line name an unhappily married woman uses as she communicates with ""Viento"" (Wind). We watch Ramn (Sergio Goyri) her successful husband, bully and humiliate her in front of their two VERY spoiled children. The daughter slips away to Spain to have an illegitimate baby, while the boy squanders his education money on dissipation with booze and prostitutes which result in expulsion from college.

Our set-upon heroine, Lucia (Laura Flores) has two close friends: Christina (Yousi Diaz), who also has two (very sensible) children the same age, and Triana (Raquel Olmedo) who seems to have a mysterious past and appears to be secretly ill. Triana advises the two younger women on their inate value and urges them to become more independent. Her sudden death is a shock and Lucia discovers she must go to Espaa to collect an unexpected inheritance.

In Spain she is welcomed with open arms by some friends of her benefactor, having no idea of the incredible wealth that is now placed at her disposal. She immediately has the resources to track down the baby girl her irresponsible daughter had abandoned.

In the meantime she meets Santiago (the incomparable Rene Strickler), a successful painter, but when she starts to feel attracted to him, she feels a twinge of guilt for being ""unfaithful"" to Viento. She tries to share the news of her inheritance with her husband back in Mexico, but he burns her letter without reading it.

Now things get interesting... Expect deceitful behavior, corporate shenanigans, potential violence toward women, the evolution of two timid women into successful businesswomen, and the joy of seeing four young adults take control of their lives...eventually. Of course there are sudden gaps that we automatically fill in because we are experienced telenovela fans. ...smile...

We love seeing the bad guys get their comeuppance and the good guys get their rewards. Very nice telenovela; I'm glad I got this one from Amazon.",1398211200,,2013,5.084848484848485

2548185,4,B000F1IO70,I  saw this program when it aired on TV the first time ane likee it very much.  Only reason I didn't rate it that I loved it is because there were some parts of the novela that weren't in this version and I missed not seeing them.  Would have helped with continuity a little more.,1361923200,,280,4.054545454545455

2548187,1,B000F1IO70,"Don't waste your money. I enjoyed the original on TV in all its glory and bought this expecting much more than the bland, insipid musical theme the original was replaced with, the crappy, bad editing, just a terrible job. If you can, wait for the original to be re-shown on TV and record it. These ""original"" DVD versions of popular soap operas are all terrible. Badly planned and executed. Just a cheap way to rip consumers off. The day I bought this DVD I bought two others, Los Ricos Tambien Lloran and La Madrastra. They're the same, badly edited (cut and joined at the wrong places) and with bland, worse than elevator music. All the life is sucke out of them. Don't buy them. Send Televisa a message by letting them know, they could've done a better job.",1246924800,,760,4.5144927536231885
2548188,2,B000F1IO70,This soap was edited in a boring way.  Was not interesting at all. I wasn't focused enough I wanted for the soap to be finish.  I had to fast forward it.  The only thing that I could enjoyed a bit were the bloopers.,1245369600,,215,3.953488372093023
2548189,5,B000F1IO70,"This is the best telenovela I've ever seen. It's so realistic, the love story between two main charactesr is so beautiful (Lucia and Santiago).The acters, Laura Flores, Sergio Goyri, Rene Strickler did a really great job. I've seen many telenovelas and I didn't like all of them, cause some of them were bad, but this one is really good. If you like telenovelas, buy this one, you won't be sorry.
Here is a short version of novela, that's the only bad thing about this DVD.",1185926400,4,473,4.576470588235294

8116443,4,B000F1IO70,"i really like this soap. laura flores is so beautiful.

laura was raised an orphan. she married young and very much wanted a family. she has everything on the surface - a wealthy husband and two lovely kids entering young adulthood. however, her husband is cold and a perfectionist, always criticizing her and cheating with other women. he and her kids take her for granted and are insensitive to her feelings. she feels sad and lonely.

she gets emotional support from an older friend, who dies and leaves her a lot of money. she also finds a letter among her friends belongings with an email address and begins corresponding with a mysterioius man who she falls in love with. she corresponds under the name ""otono"" meaning autumn. she doesn't know his real name either.

her daughter is keeping a secret from her, but laura discovers that during the year that her daughter was in spain, she had a baby and left it with an orphanage. (i'm not giving anything away here, as viewers find out about her daughter's pregnancy in spain at the beginning of the soap.)

when she discovers her husband kissing a co-worker (played by sabine moussier, whose character wants to get him to divorce laura and marry her so she can have his money), laura runs off to spain to find her grandaughter, see the country her friend was from, and meets close friends of her dead friend. through them, she meets a handsome and wealthy painter, who (unknown to her or him) is the man she fell in love with over the internet. they fall in love in spain.

meanwhile, her husband and kids are finding out how much they needed her. however, urged by his lover and his ego, her husband burns her letters and divorces her in mexico.

she discovers that her painter is the man internet man, but goes back to mexico to face her kids. while there, they beg her to give their father and family another chance. since it's a soap, she moves back into the house but doesn't resume the romantic relationship with her ex-husband in order to make her children happy.

she is willing to sacrifice her future relationship with the painter for her children to try to play happy family for her kids. however, sabine, her husband's lover, is still working to become her ex-husband's new wife.",1442880000,,2247,4.616541353383458
8116444,5,B000F1IO70,"I watch very few movies and ZERO telenovelas. I bought it when a local Hollywood Video was going belly up, along with every other Spanish speaking DVD they had in the place. It was at least 4 years before I popped it into my DVD player. But when I sat down with this, we had to force ourselves to pause and take breaks. I never saw the original on TV.  I knew nothing about the plot or actors, etc. I took us 6 days to see the whole thing, and the characters and situations were on my mind almost continually.  So much insight into human nature in many ways. The acting is totally great. It's focus on characters, rather than car chases and eye candy, was very welcome. I found myself researching the actors and watching them sing and dance on youtube in their out-of-character modalities -  you gotta see ""Victor"" dance! You gotta watch ""Lucia"" sing - wow!  Also, superb for people learning Spanish (clearly delivered lines, accurate subtitles, lots of repeated phrases - if you don't have ""Te amo"" and ""Perdoname"" down cold by the end of this movie, you might as well give up learning Spanish.) Bravo to producer and cast!",1441065600,,1124,4.495098039215686
