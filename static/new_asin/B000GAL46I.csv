8484540,5,B000GAL46I,"One of the very finest ""gay"" films I've ever seen, where gayness is really the pretext for a subtle/very (to me) emotionally moving  story--I'm also inordinately fond of the actors in it (elderly performance by the famous Jeanne Moreau).  I bought this for a friend, having played my own copy several times in the past.  Highest possible recommendation!  Many thanks, aab",1470441600,,371,5.032786885245901
