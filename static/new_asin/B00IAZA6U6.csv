8640537,5,B00IAZA6U6,"The filmmaker is from Long Island City and was engaged with 5 Pointz long ago when it was created by Pat DiLillo and called the Phun Factory back in the 90's. in 2010 the filmmakers approached the new curator, Meres, for the project and he agreed and signed 2 release forms. During the course of the project, the filmmakers learned that Long Island City was really about the developers and the condominiums and not the artists, instead of producing a project that would boost the developers, the filmmakers focused on the artists instead, and so the original project title ""The L.I.C. Arts Project"" morphed into a series of separate projects that was focused on the artists themselves. After spending $40,000 producing the film from their own pockets, the filmmakers still offered Jonathan ""Meres"" Cohen a royalty on sales of each DVD, directly after the offer, instead of praise, they were met with insults, ridicule and threats of litigation from Meres, who seems to only want more money than what the filmmakers had offered him, even though he agreed to do the project for free. Since not only do the filmmakers have 2 release forms, Meres is also the subject of the documentary, which shows him in a positive light. So now, instead of fighting against the entity's who are destroying the history, they are now fighting against the people who wish to preserve it.",1401321600,,1366,4.8418803418803416

it was featured on ny1 as such in 2010 as the project was still on going.
In May 2014, this new title 5 Pointz a historical journey is released following the tragic lost of the site in November 2013. Meres one curator of 5 Pointz has not seen the finished product This documentary may or may not be informative, but it is not endorsed by 5 Pointz. None of the proceed of the sales are going to 5 POintz or Jonathan Cohen.
it is important for the audience to know that this is an independant project by 2 film makers and it is not featuring interview of Meres one or 5 Pointz past 2010 .",1401235200,3,793,4.122580645161291
