5731338,4,B00CNZCF3K,"Great stretches, but taping was possibly done rushed, on the fly

I don't understand why this marvelous former ballerina, who has revolutionized stretching, won't bother with a good director or editor.  She cannot count and all too often there is too much stretching done on one side of the body and not enough on the other.  On this particular series she does it more than six times and it can be a real pain. Even more often, she doesn't narrate the motions well enough and you have to be looking at the screen at times when it's awkward to do so, just to follow.  She'll be gabbing instead about how great it feels or how it helped some friend.  All very chatty and friendly and I appreciate the smile and cheer, but I need the technical narration, too.  All that was needed was a sharp director to catch this and then some good editing.  Was the hotel too cheap to let the crew stay long enough to film enough footage?  Miranda loves to joke that the ""sarcasm police"" are going to get her.  More like your first math teacher's gonna find you, hon.

Look, this is still a recommend to buy.  It's a great workout, just flawed.  This is a great technique she's developed and I am glad for the DVD's nearly every day.  You will be healthy if you start your day with these great stretches.  But if you are like me, and you really do start every day with her DVD, well, it's the same infuriating mistakes, and there's a bit of ""is it on this lesson where she quickies the left leg?""  It gets frustrating trying to keep things even.  And I'm not even a perfectionist.  Just want full benefits, both sides.

Miranda includes on many of these episodes two certified Esmonde Technique trainers working out alongside her, who clearly don't have the ballet training she had, don't have the level of body awareness she has, and one of them does some inadvisable stances and movements.  Thank goodness Miranda's out there in front to properly demonstrate the movements, because if you do some of these while watching the male instructor (and not her in the center), you risk injury.

A tougher series of workouts than Series 3, maybe not quite as varied, but really rewarding for health and feeling good.",1410566400,26,2194,4.534351145038168
5731339,5,B00CNZCF3K,I love Classical Stretch!  It has helped me to get lean strong muscles.  I used to kill myself with exercise and would just bulk up and hurt my joints.  This feels great and I look better than ever.,1402876800,10,198,4.157894736842105

5731341,5,B00CNZCF3K,"I've been doing this program for many, many years on our local PBS station. (The location was so enticing, we made it our vacation destination and LOVED it. It was beautiful!) Miranda's classical stretch techniques have been the most effective method I have ever used (yoga, pilates, kick boxing, etc.) in improving the way my body feels. When I went back to work, I had a hard time fitting in the 6am program so having the CD makes it much more doable. It's 25 minute programs make it easier to squeeze it any time of the day. I just leave it in my TV and it's ready to go. A very worthwhile investment in one's health!",1393200000,18,620,4.353448275862069
5731342,5,B00CNZCF3K,"I own just about everything Miranda produces, especially her ""Series"" collections. The technique is different from other methods and actually it's hard to put it in a category. Her method absolutely stretches you but there is so much more. You strengthen your muscles as well and are challenged in flexibility, balance, etc. All without using weights. As you learn the techniques, you will work harder. I never feel tired after her routines, rather energized. NOTE: The prices at her site are much more reasonable than here. This particular dvd is well over priced as you can get the ENTIRE season series for the the same price at her site. Buyer beware, check her site first before purchasing elsewhere.",1370044800,50,704,4.97457627118644

My only complaint would be that they would have been labeled Disc1, Disc2, Disc3, Disc4, etc. instead of repeating Disc1 and Disc2 over and over. This would have helped to distinguish them better so I could know which one I've already done.",1439164800,4,491,4.395604395604396

5731351,5,B00CNZCF3K,"It's so pleasing to workout with a pro and not yet another amateur figure, Mrs Esmonde-White is so knowledgable and it's a pleasure to do her workouts ( I own all of her dvd's ). They are  incredible, they can do everything one wants to achieve from doing a workout. Regarding my back round I have done for many years yoga, pilates, aerobics all sorts of activities on a higher level but this is absolutely the best fusion of everything I have encountered in my life time! Don't hesitate to give the dvd set a try you want regret it. Every workout makes one feel amazing either relaxed or strong she has one for every moment in your life. When it would be possible I would rate this one hundred stars.",1425686400,14,701,4.351145038167939
5731352,5,B00CNZCF3K,"the stretches were difficult at first, after a few tries my body loved the stretches . I am 67 am feel younger, it is well worth the investment and it is fun.",1421798400,11,158,3.96875
8583839,5,B00CNZCF3K,"I have never had a work out this tough and had results as quick as this one is!  After about three weeks, I am in better shape than I have ever been, and have lost nearly 5 pounds.  My stomach is half of what it was, my rear is tighter and higher, my thighs are actually thinner, and I have muscles, long and lean, that I have always wanted.

I love Miranda's talking during each episode, as she tells why she is doing what she is doing, and she reminds one constantly to maintain positions that one tends to forget whilst working out.  She is very vocal about adapting positions to one's body's ability, which is nice for those that aren't as flexible as she is.  One doesn't do a movement too long, so one doesn't get bored or lazy.  About the time one is losing interest,
she changes, smoothly, and there is a new movement to do.

One doesn't need too many items- a stable chair or bare wall, a mat, a hemorrhoid pillow (which makes a world of difference, but a simple pillow will work, too) and something to sit on, like a phone book or yoga blocks, if one can't sit correctly when flat on the floor.

My only complaint is that she is rather, well, uneven when she is showing movements.  She often works one side more than the other, and for someone with OCD (like myself :) ) it can be rather distracting.  However, the body still gets a total workout, leaving one feeling either stretched, toned, energized or all three.

I have more energy, my clothes are getting looser, and I feel absolutely wonderful.  I can't believe, at my age, how terrific I feel.  My mood is better, too, as I feel stronger and have better posture.  The best of all, my husband is amazed at the changes and loves what he sees.  Can't do better than that!

May, 2018

I wanted to post about the DVD after one month of doing the workouts.

I am flabbergasted at the changes I've seen.  I have never, ever had a workout make the drastic changes I'm seeing, all without pain to my joints or back.  My posture is incredible, and my clothes don't fit tightly anymore.  (I was going to make a few new skirts, but I think I'll wait until I am done losing inches before I do.)

I finish my 25 minutes feeling thoroughly worked out and energetic.  I love how she reminds you to monitor your back, and how she makes adaptations not an evil or embarrassing thing to do, but a normal and necessary thing.

I can actually FEEL the changes.  My stomach feels tighter and more toned.  My arms look much better than they did, and my fanny is actually small.  (If you knew the women in my family, you'd think it was am impossibility!)  I have nearly lost my saddle bags, my legs show muscle, and my calves are super-duper toned.

Miranda, I love you.  You have given me the body that I never had, and all in such a fun, never boring manner.  I am a fan for life!",1523491200,2,2826,4.275471698113208

8583841,4,B00CNZCF3K,"I have been through two of the four discs in this set.  Although the stretches appear fluid and low impact, they are definitely a powerful workout.  Instructor Miranda gives lots of tips for doing the moves correctly and information on which muscles are affected.  Occasionally, she switches gears rather quickly and without warning, and some of the workouts are fast-paced.  I am a 57-year old female who is quite active and exercises regularly, and I found these workouts were more intense than I anticipated.  I had never done a full workout with the TV show, but I'd done a few moves from the website videos.  At the end of each session, Miranda says she ""recommends you do them every day"".  From now on, I plan to alternate them with my other workouts.  After doing the ""Office"" workout which uses a chair for the moves, I over-stretched my muscles and now have a lot of hip and lower back pain, so I won't be doing any workouts for a few days!  Lesson learned.  I would recommend Classical Stretch workouts, as they are unlike any in my extensive DVD exercise collection.  Just use caution, and don't overdo it, as these stretches are quite powerful.  One more comment, regarding the background music - much of it is classical, and I was hoping for something more Caribbean, as it was filmed in Jamaica.  Once I get used to the moves, I'll just put on my own reggae music in the background.",1498608000,3,1396,4.603238866396761

8583848,4,B00CNZCF3K,"My wife and I have been doing the classical stretch program for about three years and own seasons six through ten of this series.  Although the video quality of the DVD's does not even come up to standard definition quality, it is easy enough to follow the exercises even with low quality video.  Season six is in our opinion, the best season of the entire program.  We have done all of the seasons six through ten more than once, but always come back to season six.  While they are all good, Ms. Esmond-White seems to take more time with the stretches and other exercises than she does in the later seasons.  Season ten is significantly more aerobic than season six and aerobic exercise is not why we bought the DVD's.  The real benefit is from the variety of exercises that stretch and heal the body and season six does that best.  If you are not careful, with the other seasons, you can get injured because Ms. Esmond-White rushes the exercises in some instances.  One thing that does get monotonous, even with season six is the continual dialogue from Ms Esmond-White.  As one of the other reviewers noted, it would be nice to have a disk that explains the rationale behind the exercises, and then to simply do them.  The way it is now, Ms. Esmond-White explains things time after time and frequently looses count in number of repetitions and which part of the body she is exercising.

I have exercised regularly for the last 50 years, and have found this to be the most balanced program there is in my experience.  After running two to three miles per day for over 30 years, I had to quit running because my joints became so painful.  Over the years, I also tried a number of other programs, like Total Gym, treadmills, Gazelle, free weights, elliptical machines, NordicTrack, etc.  None of these programs or machines were bad in and of themselves, but I find the 25 minutes a day I spend with Classical Stretch not only meets my physical needs, but is also a program my wife and I can do together.

Therefore, even given the shortcomings, I don't believe that there is any better exercise program out there.  If you want to minimize the effects of aging, you can't go wrong by doing this program seven days a week.  We have seen significant benefits to our health, mobility, and reduction in pain.  It is a truly great program and I highly recommend it.",1476835200,11,2359,4.562945368171022
