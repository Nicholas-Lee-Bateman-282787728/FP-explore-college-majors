6452659,2,B00KWTEO4M,"Episode 1 left me both excited by what I had seen and a little perplexed.  The show touched on so many issues: deplorable attitudes towards women's health, marital infidelity, blackmail, socio-economic class disparities, the stigma of mental health problems.  Episode 2 left me more than a little frustrated in leaving some glaring problems unsettled, or not properly resolved.  Episode 3 was the worst. There were so many different directions the final show could have taken to give the viewers a more satisfactory ending; however, none of those possibilities were explored and I was left shaking my head in disbelief.

Other reviewers thought the show spoke down to viewers in that women were pretty much dismissed, thought of as pretty objects instead of being appreciated and respected.  Having lived through that time period, I can tell you that is precisely how I was treated.  Some of us were powerless and had little control at home, in the workplace, or in matters of our own health care.  Fortunately, those days are past.",1409702400,22,1032,5.035294117647059
6452660,1,B00KWTEO4M,"In the case of this show, ""Breathless"" is a merely a euphemism for ""gag"" or ""retch.""  There are so many reasons to be disappointed in this series.  First, the script talks down to the audience.  I understand that we have come a long way in women's rights since the 1960s.  But, in this series we are led to believe that in ""those days"" all male gynecologists were perverted and saw women as stupid and childlike.  All the women in this show (except for our heroine Angela) are weak and seem to accept this fate.  This feels more like a political contrivance than a solid period-piece.  Second, almost all of the characters are morally bankrupt.  Our main hero, the dashing ""Otto,""  has no problem cheating on his wife or performing illegal abortions under the table- for money not for compassion.  In fact, he feigns compassion for patients as a way to influence his standing with Angela.  What a slime.  And we are supposed to cheer this couple on as the next great love story?  Dr. and Mrs. Enderbury seem decent.  But, unfortunately, both are too daft to see what is going on or do anything about it.  Lastly, the message seems to be that in order to be successful -forget about ability.  You need to be more ruthless and underhanded than the other guy.  If you are a woman in power, you need to look the other way.  If you are a powerless woman, you'd better sucker some doctor into marrying you or you can just forget about having any kind of quality life.  What garbage.  There is just no one or nothing to root for in Breathless.",1409529600,13,1536,4.4765342960288805
6452661,3,B00KWTEO4M,"No mystery here. Just a lot of soap opera. I didn't like Mad Men and thus one is the same genre. If you liked Mad Men, you like this.",1409529600,9,133,3.6206896551724137
6452662,2,B00KWTEO4M,"I felt like this series tried to be a cross between Mad Men and Masters of Sex, but with terrible characters.  I really disliked the main character - a slimy married doctor who's obsessed with a new nurse - and didn't care for any of the female characters either.  I can honestly say this is the first Masterpiece Mystery I haven't liked.  Didn't keep watching, and read it wasn't renewed for a second season, that's not surprising.",1409443200,11,432,4.584415584415584
6452663,4,B00KWTEO4M,"If you would like a stylish 1960's medical drama, this may be a 5-star series for you.  This centers around doctors, nurses and their mates in a medical ward.  Head doctor is played by Jack Davenport, and his beguiling affability keeps you watching the show.  It seems he is attracted to a nurse who isn't his wife.  Other characters are similarly challenged which provides much of the dramatic tension in the show.  There are other plot strands involving illegal procedures and past histories.  Would say it is more character-driven than plot-driven. There is no one central conflict providing cohesion.  It is not a typical Masterpiece mystery if that is what you are expecting.

It's also fashion-driven and set-driven as these compete equally for attention.  The casting is inspired with star performances by female leads Zoe Boyle and Catherine Steadman who play nurses.  It's a visually appealing series.  I don't usually watch medical shows, and didn't find the plot strands in this as compelling as the actors, dialogue, sets, and costumes.  But those who love medical dramas with a hint of revealing past secrets, this may be worthy of 5 stars.",1409443200,20,1153,5.010526315789473
6452664,5,B00KWTEO4M,"My fondness for this medical crime drama stems from its vivid expression of London in the early 1960's
`Breathless' ,captures this unique period of social history perfectly as post war Britain slowly emerges from austerity.

Not entirely procedural- it's more than just theater life and illegal abortions.  It's a clever and detailed look into lives and aspirations of Doctors, Nurses and their families.  Women in the 1960's were still perceived in society as inferior and not expected to retain or pursue careers after marriage.  Strict moral codes of conduct applied.

Jack Davenport's performance as Senior Consultant Gynecologist Mr. Otto Powell, within one of London's shiny new National Health Service Hospital's  is superb  - in fact all the cast are equally captivating in this character led tale of secrets and lies.  Keeping us in exquisite anticipation and suspense as the story unfolds.
I'm not going to divulge or explore the plot, let's just say everyone, especially  the  golden couple, {to whom everyone aspires}  Otto and his wife Elizabeth  have  secrets which have the potential  to ruin their reputations and  lives .

This production is beautifully crafted, from detailed set designs, period camera shots, fashion and 60's music - all making it a classic.  I loved it and I'm left aching for more................",1407542400,48,1334,5.246445497630332
6452665,3,B00KWTEO4M,"When I received an advance copy of this new PBS miniseries I had great hopes and expectations for it. I love good British mysteries  and have reviewed many DVD and BDs of them here on Amazon. I do not like to include spoilers in my reviews but Ill have to provide a few here because its impossible to honestly review this product without divulging a few things.  If you don't want any significant spoilers then read on until I write STOP!

Breathless was period drama produced by the commercial ITV studios (not the BBC) in 2013 and it is now airing in the US on PBSs Masterpiece Mystery series. There are six episodes which each run  about 47 minutes. The PBS Home video version is the Original UK Edition. The PBS version was edited but I not by very much. I think it was for language (there is an F-word at least once). There is no nudity or graphic sex or violence.

The story takes place in 1961 London  a point in time when abortions were still illegal and the birth control pill was just being introduced. The series reeks of early 60s ambience (clothes, music) just like the TV series Mad Men. Only this time all  or most of the story takes place in the OB/GYN section of the London City Hospital. The relationships between the medical staff and they wives and families has the same ring as early 1960s movies too.
As I said this series is being shown as part of Masterpiece Mystery but  honestly  no mystery occurs until the third episode and then its not a detective kind of mystery  its the divulgence that something has happened in one of the characters ,lives and well have to wait a few hours to learn what it is. The other story lines are interesting and the casting is superb. The actors make you feel for them and their emotions. And the acting is the main reason Im giving this a positive rating.

Okay, now is the time to STOP reading if you want no more spoilers. They won't be many but one important one.
As I noted above the event is discovered at near the end of Episode Three and youll find yourself wanting to know how the characters deal with it. Episode Four has a cliffhanger and youll find yourself wanting to watch Episode Five immediately to see what happens.  All the events in the first five episodes come to a head in the last episode (six) and it is then you find out that Breathless was to be the first of a series of seasons. (Similar to the recent real-mystery series Endeavour).  And the writers  I think there were different writers for different episodes  leave you hanging with nearly every characters situation unresolved  The only thing that is resolved is knowing what the event was. I felt like it was the end of a shaggy dog story! What makes this even more frustrating is the fact that  BIG SPOILER ALERT here!  The series was NOT renewed by ITV.  I feel that I have to reveal this to those who plan to invest 4  hours watching the show.

The BD has  like Endeavour 2  english subtitles that move around the screen and not always on the side where the person speaking is located. But, unlike Endeavour 2 I found the accents on Breathless easy to understand, so I turned them off.  And the BD/DVD does not have any special features such as behind-the-scenes featurettes.
The only Mystery to me was the series title. Other than the fact that one of the main characters is an anesthesiologist, I pondered  but not for long  what the title was referring to.

As I said at the beginning, I had high hopes for this show. But Im afraid this one was an honest disappointment.
I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

6452668,1,B00KWTEO4M,"I streamed this video from Amazon.  It was fascinating because it was so horrible and the only reasons  I continued watching were to see what implausible twist would be thrown on the screen next and to find out what the big mystery was. Almost none of the characters were in the least bit likeable, particularly the supposedly ""charismatic Dr. Powell."" with his carefully modulated manner and voice. He oozed as much oil as his slicked backed hair.  You would need to be pretty desperate to visit any of these sleaze bucket doctors.  The villain was right out of a cult horror movie and the brave little nursey was another caricature from a Victorian novel who could do no wrong and whose virtue caused men to swoon at her feet. The ending was a Gothic horror ending sort of like the ending of the Evelyn Waugh novel about the guy who ends up stuck in the jungle for the rest of his life reading to his savior.  I watched this thing in disbelief at how bad it was and the only mystery I could figure out was now it ever made it to Masterpiece Theater.",1436745600,4,1051,4.396907216494846

6452676,5,B00KWTEO4M,"Very steamy tale of doctors making fools of themselves when they have perfectly submissive wives at home!  Ill never understand doctors; they are always cowering behind the sanctity of doctor/patient relationship, like defrocked priests?  Some of the wives and nurses in this series deserve to be seduced, they are so lovely (but then Im jolted back into the real world and remember they are just actresses).  Not to take anything away from nurses, quite a few of whom Ive lusted after in my encounters with them.  This would be rated as a girly movie by some of the men I know who would much rather watch a John Wayne epic.  Perhaps theres something wrong with me but whatever it is, I enjoy my lustful thoughts as I watch this presentation.  Arouse and enjoy hours of lustful thoughts as you watch this story, I have every confidence that you will not be disappointed and Ive giving this to my youngest daughter who is a nurse anesthetist and is assigned to tell me how closely this series mirrors her own experience in her work location.

6452687,5,B00KWTEO4M,"I love it!  But surely this is not the end of Breathless.  There were too many question left unanswered when it finished.
Please tell me there is going to be more....",1412985600,,166,4.32258064516129
6452688,2,B00KWTEO4M,"If characters in movies acted rationally, the plots would shrink to maybe five minutes screen time. So, characters will invariably make wrong decisions (they never call the police, for instance) thus delaying the plot's conclusion. So you find yourself yelling at the screen: ""No, don't go through THAT door!"" The problem with this British series is that all of the characters keep making the same mistake and not learning from it, thus rendering them stupid. There is not a single character one cares about.

""Breathless"" is as glitzy as it can get, the talented cast is very attractive, but the script lets them all down. Obviously striving to be another ""Mad Men"" it fails in every department. In the American series, Don Draper's ""secret"" is so outrageous that once it is revealed (early in the series) you are kept hooked wondering who will find out and what will be the consequence. Unfortunately, in ""Breathless"" the ""big secret"" is not revealed until the very end, and when you find out what it consists of, you're reaction will be the title of that old Peggy Lee ballad (and the title of this review).

The Blu-Ray is tack sharp and color saturated. The production values are all that money can buy, but personally, the old 70s Hollywood potboiler ""Doctor's Wives"" is much more trashy fun and a better recommendation.

AS for a future SEries 2, I think I'll pass.",1412467200,3,1372,4.805084745762712
6452689,5,B00KWTEO4M,I really thought Breathless was one of the best I've seen on Masterpiece Mystery.  Jack Davenport did a stunning portrayal of Otto.  He broke my heart many times.  The story line was really good but we need at least one more season to tie up all loose ends.  Please convince the powers that be to continue it,1411430400,,308,4.350877192982456
6452690,5,B00KWTEO4M,Enjoyed the movie breathless . Sorry it ended the first series so quickly. I love watching most all British movies and series. They usually don't end in less than two hours  like our American movies. Their actors don't have to be so stunning. They just have great quality acting. Can't wait for series 2.,1410652800,,304,4.62962962962963
6452691,3,B00KWTEO4M,"What a disappointment!  Usually, the Masterpiece Mystery series is worth putting on my schedule in order to make a specific effort to be there to watch!  However, this particular series is a 'dud' from the word 'go'.  The characters are shallow, the story-line does not hang together, and there are no clues as to why the characters do what they do.  I've only watched the first three episodes that were shown very recently in the U S 2014 showing on PBS - I kept thinking it would get better! - and not only was there no mystery at all until at the very last of the third episode (when the series ended for this year), the story line is hard to follow, as there is no smooth transition from one scene to the next.  I think this probably had potential to be a good series, but between the shallow characterization of the characters and the lack of mystery, this storyline, so far, is a dud.  Do the next 3 episodes redeem the first 3?  We shall see ...",1410307200,2,952,4.314606741573034
6452692,3,B00KWTEO4M,"Because of the excellent acting, I kept watching ""Breathless"", but I have to confess I was left scratching my head. And then I read that the series, which is set around a 1960s London NHS hospital, was meant to have a second season, but was cancelled. This explains why threads of really absorbing plots were left hanging like wires from a 1960s' electrical appliance, leaving so many unanswered questions.

The actors, directors, and costume designers invested a lot of talent and effort in the aptly named ""Breathless,"" which because of it's cancellation, had the wind knocked clean out of it!",1410220800,6,595,4.95
6452693,4,B00KWTEO4M,"I have just watched the final episode on Masterpiece Theatre,  It was broadcast as 3, 90 minute episodes. I can say that the two negative reviewers might possibly have a different opinion had they watched the whole series. They made assumptions based on the first 90 minutes or so which perhaps should have been better left until the end.

I won't spoil it to for those who haven't seen it yet, but it should suffice to say that things are not what they seem with most of the characters and that the final 45 or so minutes  will leave you with a whole new perspective.

As for the way the time period and peoples behavior is portrayed, I think this comes pretty close to my knowledge of the late 50's, early 60's before the sexual revolution. I can't tell you how authentic it is for the English background. Most of the roles seem to be superbly acted and the sets make you feel like you are actually living in the time period. If it offends you what the attitudes were and how people were treated, join the crowd. We explore history to help us learn what we want to change so we never go back to that again.

I would like to see this renewed for another ""Series"" but I am not sure where the story line would go. It seems to have had quality writing so perhaps a second season would be just as good as the first.",1410134400,5,1312,4.253012048192771
6452694,5,B00KWTEO4M,"Bought this PBS Masterpiece series due to Iain Glen (Game of Thrones) being listed but Jack Davenport's character drew me in and kept me intrigued.  Breathless reminded me of the short-lived television show Pan Am (another show set in the 1960's) or the older British mini-series Jewel in the Crown which is slow moving yet suspenseful and full of great acting.  These shows take older taboo subjects which no longer leave society ""gasp"" Breathless but make great period dramas/mysteries, in my opinion.

This drama/mystery slowly pulls you into the story that one has to be patient to realize the mystery.  Times have changed drastically since the 1960's and I found Breathless to depict this quite well.  What would be shocking and taboo then is no longer today which one has to remember while watching this series.  I enjoyed sneaking a peek into 1960's London and found the story to be intriguing.  For me, the acting was top notch along with the depiction of 1960's scenery, glamorous clothes and historical cars, I truly felt like I was in 1960's London.

Lovely cast, who captured the style, grace and controversies of the early 1960's. On the eve of the women's movement, the human rights movement and the breakdown of racial barriers, this story has a way of moving all of these important themes into one setting with a strong ensemble cast. Jack Davenport does a great job of being the pivotal face in this drama. I will look for more of his work!  PLEASE bring Season 2!!!

Jack Davenport makes American actors look like baby faced school boys.  Davenport is probably the top actor in the world today. His masculinity and overall appearance is reminisce of actors we all long for and used to see in period films. He reeks sex appeal. Oliver Chris is eye candy as well. The story is never dull but sadly I will say I hated the ending.  Still, I would watch it again for the compelling story and acting. If only American film could  measure up to the Brits.
