7955287,2,B00005UQ7F,"Im not sure about the movie i don't think it was very good,what do i mean when i say i think it was no good.....I couldn't watch the film becouse the video was poor first off lets get this out of the way again. Dont buy fullscreen movies especially action movies, buy them as they were meant to be shown or your gonna miss some, in the case here we miss alot fights break out and you cant see them becouse the stupid pan and scan has got to pan over to catch the action in Kung Fu flix the fight could have already been over. People still holding on to that belief that fullscreen is better becouse no black lines and it fills your screen up,that might be true but you cant say you've seen the matrix untill you see it in widescreen becouse literally you havnt seen all the movie,you just watched a little over half even though you may have watched it to the end. So i guess im off topic with this movie but this is a prime example of awful video",1082851200,,946,4.091397849462366
7955288,5,B00005UQ7F,"I've been watching kung fu films for ages and have to say this one is a total rarity. Never heard of it. It must have been made at the height of the Jackie Chan craze in the early 1980's,since it stars `Jackie Chen'!The guy looks and moves like the real Jackie! He fights Bolo,and it also stars John Chang,who made Snake in the Monkey's Shadow. The film quality is great,but it's a full screen transfer. It is in 5.1 sound though. And the extra features are terrific-loads of cast and crew clips(including one on Jackie imitators!),and plenty of Wu Tang Clan material. These guys really live what they preach! I recommend this and the other Wu Tang Clan DVD's like-Shaolin Drunkard,Incredible Kung Fu Master,Snake Shadow Lama Fist,Kung Fu of 8 Drunkards, Revenge of the Patriots and 18 Fatal Strikes.",1018137600,3,800,4.762589928057554
