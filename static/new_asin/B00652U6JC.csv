4959639,3,B00652U6JC,"Custer was such a rock star in his time that, when the news of his death spread across the country, Americans reacted to it with the same shock and disbelief we felt upon hearing the news of President Kennedy's death, or the attacks of September 11th. He was the gallant and reckless brave Civil War hero, the glorious Indian fighter of the West. It was not possible that he could be defeated by a bunch of godless ""savages"". For those that know his name and of the battle, but not much detail regarding either, this DVD provides enough information to satisfy. I am among those who are endlessly fascinated with the topic, therefore I was hoping for more information than was presented. I expected a two hour discussion of the events leading up to the battle, including more Native American perspective. It was more a Custer bio than a true study of the actual battle. The Little Big Horn Fight is discussed only in the last 20 minutes or so. Sitting Bull is mentioned,(he actually did not play a significant role in the actual fighting) but no mention at all of Crazy Horse, who was responsible for rallying warriors and leading charges against Custer and his men. No mention of Gall, who, after his family was killed during  Reno's attack, distinguished himself as one of the best Sioux tacticians that day. One aspect of the DVD I did enjoy, were all the photos of Custer, some of which I hadn't seen before.(more photos exist of Custer than of Lincoln... he was great at self promotion) It will forever be debated if Custer alone was responsible for his death, and the deaths of over 200 of his men.  Was he impetuous and fool hardly or let down and abandoned by Reno and Benteen. Custer always said he if he had a choice, he would choose to follow those who refused to settle on a reservation. His admiration for the Native Americans who wanted to live the ""old ways"", didn't prevent him from slaughtering those same Native Americans.(mostly women and children) What happened to Custer on the hot June day in 1876, I would say he had it coming.",1329523200,24,2049,4.580381471389646
4959640,5,B00652U6JC,"Very good PBS ""American Experience"" (as usual !) - - it presented a very fair and balanced story of George Custer, warts and all.  Custer was a master of self-marketing, taking dozens upon dozens of photos of himself, even with a dead buffalo to show American readers he was the true trailblazer and ""man of the plains.""  But what I really enjoyed was the good deal of time that was spent on Custer's wife, Ms. Bacon, who was truly the inspiration and brains behind George Custer - - often sitting him down to teach him how to act when NOT on the battlefield, and became his ""social coach"" behind the scenes.  Well done broadcast !",1328572800,6,631,4.469565217391304
4959641,4,B00652U6JC,"I have purchased this video for my son. To me that is the standard to be met for teaching US history; is this something that we as parents want to be taught to the next generation of Americans, and more specifically our own children? On the other hand, nothing angers me more than revisionist American history that is based on a hidden political bias and is secretly taught in classrooms. This video presents the story in a similiar manner as a college level history course, although it does not tell the entire story and that cannot be done in a couple of hours so no one should reasonably expect that. My son and I did visit the battlefield and listen to the Park Ranger's description of the events leading up to the battle and what is known about it and even that left us wanting to learn more. This video explains why we keep coming back to Custer and the significance of this battle in our history: ""Custer embodies.."" the part of American History ""that makes us uncomfortable"" like ""the way Americans sometimes rush into military action, the way America has treated Native Indians and other peoples here and around the world."" We as Americans have not resolved these relevant issues and until we do ""we keep coming back to Custer."" It is just small part of the story, presented fairly. If it was intended to stir up the discussion and interest it surely does that.
Since I wrote all of the above some time ago, I have visited the battlefield two more times and read four books on Custer, and thus I have reduced the rating by one star. The Park Service hands out a brochure at the Little Big Horn with a painting of Custer on his hands and knees. If you knew nothing of him except the last day of his life then this is how you would portray him. I have learned of Custer's bravery in the Civil War and believe that history has been forgotten. He was surrounded and outnumbered many times and always seemed to get out of it and be successful in the end, and thus the legendary ""Custer's Luck."" No one wins all the time. However, in his last moments alive he should be remembered as standing like the brave man that he was.",1327104000,9,2127,4.428571428571429
4959642,4,B00652U6JC,"Custer's Last Stand: American Experience

This story starts with a telegraph message: Custer and 261 soldiers were killed by the Little Big Horn river, around the 100th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. Brigadier General Custer defeated J. E. B. Stuart's ""Invincibles"" at the Battle of Gettysburg to prevent a Union loss. At West Point Custer set a record for the most demerits and finished at the bottom of his class. He showed skill in battle at the head of his troops. After the war Lt. Colonel Custer was sent west to fight Indians (who raided the homes of settlers). It was difficult to find Indians when they avoided combat. The US Army decided to attack the Indians in the winter when they were most vulnerable. Custer was placed in charge of this operation. His victory was praised by the eastern newspapers.

The Indian reservation covered most of what is now South Dakota; the Black Hills were considered sacred land. The Sioux received rations in return for their peace. Sitting Bull and his followers kept to their traditional life as buffalo hunters. The Northern Pacific railroad was built north of the reservation. In 1874 Custer and his troops explored the Black Hills to find a location for a new fort. Was there gold? Miners went to the Black Hills to look for gold. Custer testified against President Grant's policies (the corruption in the Indian agencies). The army was ordered to bring in the Lakota Sioux who were off the reservation. The tactic was to use three converging columns of troops to attack the hostile Sioux. Custer was sent to the south of the Indian village. ""No, I will not."" The Sioux and the Cheyenne attacked General Crook's forces using new tactics. They had the largest force of Indians ever assembled.

Custer pushed his men towards the Indian camp. Did he underestimate the forces against him? ""We've got them"" was Custer's last recorded words. Reno's command sought refuge on the hill. ""Where is Custer?"" Reno, Benteen, and their forces defended themselves until the Indians withdrew. The following day the other forces arrived to find the bodies of Custer and his soldiers. The news reached America on July 6, 1876. Custer's wife Libbie defended his reputation and memory against those who attacked Custer. Publicity boosted Custer's memory. He was a hero to the American people until corporate publications attacked him in the 1950s. [So who decided this?] I think those closest to the events were the best judges of Custer.

This interesting and informative documentary should not prevent you from reading a book, such as Robert M. Utley's ""Cavalier in Buckskin"". The best Hollywood movie is still ""They Died With Their Boots On"" (for drama not history). Was Custer sent into a perilous situation as payback for his testimony to Congress? A loss would damage his reputation. Custer and his wife are buried at West Point.",1326844800,6,2883,4.950413223140496
4959643,5,B00652U6JC,"The massacre of George Armstrong Custer and the 261 men of the 7th U.S. Cavalry under his command on June 25th & 26th, 1876 at the Battle of Little Bighorn looms large in the American psyche.  The image of Custer himself depends largely from which vantage point you study him.  The man of American myth and memory can be seen as a martyr, a hero or a villain; a loving husband and a strict disciplinarian; a general and a fool; an egomaniac and a romantic.

The critically acclaimed PBS documentary series ""American Experience"" explores the life of George Armstrong Custer in a 2 hour episode entitled ""Custer's Last Stand.""  Beginning with Custer's battle with the Confederate cavalry under J.E.B. Stewart on July 3rd 1863 at Gettysburg, writer and director Steven Ives, presents Custer's life in linear chronological order with occasional flashes back to his less than illustrious career as a cadet at the American Military Academy at West Point, and his courtship of and marriage to Elizabeth Bacon.

After the war the army shrank and Custer went from being a Major General of volunteers to a captain in the regular army.  In short order he was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel of the 7th U.S. Cavalry and took up residence at Ft. Riley, Kansas.  He took part in Major General Winfield Scott Hancock's expedition against the Cheyenne in 1867, from which campaign he returned to Fort Riley without leave to Libby's loving embrace, an act for which he was court martialed, found guilty and was suspended for one year without pay.

Custer's suspension was short lived, and he soon found himself called back to duty.  Under the orders of Major General Philip Sheridan, Custer led the 7th Cavalry in an attack against the winter encampment of the Cheyenne chief Black Kettle on the Washita River.  Though Custer claimed it a victory, it was a massacre, of the killed and captured, only a few were Cheyenne warriors, most were old men, women and children.

The documentary highlights Custer's decision not to look for a detachment of the 7th Cavalry led by Major Joel Elliot after the battle on the Washita.  The bodies of Elliot and his men were found a few weeks later.  For Custer it was a decision that would sow the poison seed of distrust that would take root and grow among some of the men of the 7th Cavalry, and would result in the bitter harvest of 261 of his men at Little Bighorn.

In 1874 he led an expedition into the Black Hills of the Dakota Territory, where gold was found, it would prove to be a discovery that would lead to a flood of white settlers into a place considered holy by the Lakota Sioux, and the virtual ending of the Laramie Treaty which guaranteed the use of the Dakota Territory to the Native Americans forever.

His next assignment would be at Fort Abraham Lincoln, where George & Libby Custer were at the center of the social circle.  It was a circle that included a large number of Custer's own family: his brothers Tom and Boston, his sister Margaret and her husband James Calhoun who was also a member of the 7th Cavalry, and his nephew Autie Reed.  Among those that were not included in the Custer family's social circle, were Major Marcus Reno & Captain Frederick Benteen, who harbored resentment and criticism of Custer's decision not to search for Major Elliott and his men, and who would be major players in the drama that would unfold on the banks of the Little Bighorn River.

The last 30 minutes of the documentary covers the battle of Little Bighorn, or what until very recently has been known as ""Custer's Last Stand.""  It gives an overview of Custer's plan of attack, and the splitting of the 7th Cavalry into detachments led by Benteen and Reno, and ultimately their failure to come to Custer's aid.

Using archival photographs, illustrations, present-day landscapes and interviews with historians: Nathaniel Philbrick, Richard Slotkin, Louis Warren, Michael A. Elliott, Edward Linenthal, Gerard Baker, Paul Hutton, Louise Barnett, Shirley Leckie Reed and Philip J. Deloria; many of whom have written books on the Custers and the Battle of Little Bighorn, it is hard to find much of anything to criticize.

However, it is a telling of Custer's life told by and large from a white American point of view.  The documentary could have only been enhanced by the adding in of the Native American viewpoint, which would have necessarily lengthened the film, and in all fairness to the producer, writer and director of the project, Custer was the main focus of their documentary.

Nathaniel Philbrick, however is in a unique position of having written ""Mayflower: A story of Courage, Community and War,"" a book about the friendly relationship of the Pilgrims of Plymouth Colony with the Native Americans which devolved two generations later into King Philip's War, and also ""The Last Stand: Custer, Sitting Bull and the Battle of the Little Bighorn,"" which according to the documentary was ""the last major battle of the Indian Wars.""  It would have been interesting to hear Philbrick's thoughts on the evolution of the relationship between the white settlers and the Native Americans.

I do have one very minor, nit-picky criticism:  early in the documentary Custer is referred to as ""the first born son of a blacksmith turned farmer,"" which is incorrect.  Custer was in fact the third child Emanuel Custer's second marriage, and his fifth son.",1326672000,41,5383,4.841875681570338

4959655,5,B00652U6JC,"The Fort Laramie Treaty in 1868 designated the Great Sioux Reservation to encompassed most of South Dakota and the Black Hills. This land was granted to the Sioux and Lakota Indian bands. Sitting Bull was the leader, who was looked up to during a time of cataclysmic change in their lives as the white civilization encroached on them. Publicly, the U.S. government supported the Lakota's rights to the Black Hills. Privately, Washington wanted to move in white settlements and render the Fort Laramie Treaty null and void. On July 30, 1874, gold was discovered in the Black Hills. By the fall of 1875, more than 15,000 miners had come to the Black Hills area, establishing the towns of Custer and Deadwood.  The U.S. government, to avert clashes between gold miners and Indians, offered the Lakotas $6 million which they turned down. On November 3, 1874, President Ulysses Grant issued an ultimatum that in effect forced the Lakotas to sell the Black Hills. About 18 months later, on May 17, 1876, the Seventh Cavalry under General Custer began their 700-mile journey from Fort Lincoln near Bismarck, N.D., to remove the Lakota. Chief Sitting Bull was expecting, over these months, that an attack might be imminent. He put the word out to the surrounding Sioux and Cheyenne bands of the threat he was facing. Chief Sitting Bull pulls his people together, he recruits and gathers a huge resistance force to stave of any incursion. Hundreds heeded his call and came to unify and hunker down with the Lakotas. They felt they had no where to turn or escape to from this assault; this was their fight for survival. Chief Sitting Bull presumed that when the cavalry came upon this enormous encampment, they would use caution and negotiate which he was prepared to do. Instead, they immediately opened fire shooting his horse out from under him. Chief Sitting Bull then ordered his men to counter attack which they did en masse. Some 2,000 Indian warriors drove the shell-shocked cavalry to the south to retreat back into the hills. And then again when Custer's forces arrived from the north, all 261 men of the Seventh Cavalry were massacred. Chief Sitting Bull moved his band of 8,000 men, women, and children out of the territory. He went to Canada for a time but eventually settled on the Great Sioux Reservation to live out his life.",1466985600,2,2331,4.8275

4959679,2,B00652U6JC,"There are quite a few things to fault in this video. I will name some of them.
1. It is too long and it drags. If it had been 30 to 60 minutes shorter it would have been much improved. Points are made and then remade and then made again, instead of moving the story along. It needs to be tightened up.
2. There are, as almost always in PBS productions, too many commentators aside from the narrator. Many of them have sloppy diction.  It is annoying to have them repeatedly interrupt the narration with usually insignificant comments that add little or nothing to our understanding. Most are identified simply as ""historians"". So are they self declared historians or are they attached to some institution""? We are never told. If they have any academic credentials, it would be nice to know what these are.
3. Too much emphasis on his wife and marriage. Important no doubt, but the viewer is more interested in the event.

So make it shorter, reduce the number of outside commentators, tell us what their credentials are. And focus on the event itself, not on Custer's home life.",1360281600,16,1078,4.609375

4959682,3,B00652U6JC,"Following a terrific background build-up, this DVD inexplicably ""drops the ball"" and fails to deliver this DVD's punch line, i.e. a meaningful description of the battle details of Custer's Last Stand.

This 2012 DVD is entitled CUSTER'S LAST STAND.  Therefore, when I purchased this expensive DVD produced by the prestigious PBS, I naturally expected this DVD would provide meaningful, detailed historiography of Custer's Last Stand.  However, this DVD absolutely does not do so.

An extremely compelling way to illustrate this DVD's failure to provide meaningful detailed coverage of Custer's Last Stand is to view this DVD's ""Scene Selection"" feature, and to select what PBS itself labels as ""The Last Stand"" scene.  Take a close look at this brief footage, and closely listen to the commentary.

PBS's ""Last Stand"" scene lasts ONLY A FEW MINUTES, and consists NOT of describing the activity of Custer's battalion while meeting its gruesome end, but of a supposed conversation between Benteen and Reno, who were located elsewhere, far removed from Custer!  This DVD then describes scenarios of wild speculation of ""how Custer died,"" all of which are completely unsupported by the historical record presented by PBS.  Then this DVD, without any justification except for PBS's new story line of the ""Major Elliot card,"" completely blames Benteen and Reno for the destruction of Custer's battalion!  Furthermore, this DVD states the Indians claimed Custer was killed early in the battle, when in fact THE INDIANS DID NOT EVEN KNOW WHO CUSTER WAS, or that Custer was in command of the troops!

In extreme irony, the ""Last Stand"" 'Scene Selection' feature of this PBS DVD primarily consists of an enlarged, screen-filled depiction of a second-hand audibly and visually clicking around a clock.  This scene is apparently intended to convey the skewed message that Benteen and Reno are responsible for the Custer catastrophe.  However, as a viewer, this scene had a completely different effect on me.  As the clock's 'second' had audibly clicked tediously by, what I was wondering about is ""WHEN, WHEN, WHEN is this PBS DVD finally going to get around to its supposed task of providing meaningful coverage of the battle details of Custer's Last Stand?""  But, as the seconds on the clock tick tediously by, this PBS DVD in fact NEVER ATTEMPTS TO DISCHARGE THIS TASK.

This DVD's ""The Last Stand 'Scene Selection'"" also presents its speculative and unsupported inferences about the battle WITHOUT REFERENCE TO ANY TIMELINE for either Reno's, Benteen's or Custer's battalions, or the pack train!  Of key relevance to a critical evaluation of this DVD is the glaring absence of a TIMELINE.

Giving this DVD the title ""CUSTER'S LAST STAND"" is a COMPLETELY DISHONEST and DECEPTIVELY MISLEADING MARKETING PLOY by PBS - ergo, it's fraudulent.

I absolutely would not have purchased this DVD had I known that this DVD does not, in fact, provide meaningful, detailed coverage about Custer's Last Stand.  I suspect that many buffs, or serious students, of Custer's Last Stand would feel the same way.

It would be delightful to have a DVD that meaningfully covers the specifics of Custer's Last Stand.  However, after viewing this DVD, it seems that instead of DVD coverage, one must access the book market to obtain this information.  Search AMAZON.com's book listings for ""Custer's Last Stand.""  Your search should be rewarded.

I broadly characterize Custer's ""Last Stand"" as encompassing the destruction of Custer's entire battalion of five companies, from the time Custer's battalion separated from the rest of the 7th Calvary, until this battalion's final remnants were wiped out on ""Last Stand Hill.""

The only fighting at the Battle of the Little Bighorn this DVD portrays is the attack by Reno's battalion on the Indian village, and the horror of Reno's panicked retreat to the bluffs across the river.  This DVD's coverage of these features, while not comprehensive, is informative.

The real ""mystery"" of Custer's ""Last Stand"" are the details of the horror of the disintegration and final destruction of Custer's battalion - exactly what this DVD completely fails to do.

The details of the destruction of Custer's battalion have long been a ""mystery"" because there were no survivors (troopers or ""scouts,"" and one newsman) of Custer's battalion, and no other ""White"" witnesses to that destruction.  Until relatively recently, the primary evidence we had of this disintegration are the location of the corpses of the troopers of Custer's battalion, as presumably indicated by white stone markers scattered across the prairie at Little Bighorn.

In 1983, a major prairie fire destroyed the centuries of impenetrable growth of prairie grass which covered the ground of the Custer battlefield.  This permitted - for the first and only time - a two year (1984-1985) bonanza of archeological excavations of the Custer battlefield, which included use of metal detectors. A book was promptly published about these archeological excavations (which I promptly purchased), as was a National Geographic magazine article which included a fold-out color map detailing the battlefield locations of these archeological excavations.

The National Geographic magazine's fold-out map includes blue-shaded areas where concentrations of army artifacts (expended cartridge cases, etc.) are located, and red-shaded areas showing the locations of concentrations of Indian artifacts.

In contrast to the CONFUSED scattering of stone markers across the prairie at the Custer battlefield, indicating where Custer's troopers fell, the historical record indicates that Custer's battalion fought by individual companies (too far apart to support one another), indicating that Custer deliberately made piecemeal dispositions from his battalion, by periodically detaching individual companies of his battalion, one company at a time: ""THOUGH THIS BE MADNESS, YET THERE IS METHOD IN 'T.""  Archaeological excavations now provide a completely different perspective, which this DVD could have illustrated.

This DVD - which is not a National Geographic DVD - does not mention the 1984-1985 archeological excavations at the Custer battlefield, and what these extremely revealing archeological excavations tell us about the nature of the Custer battle, as so graphically illustrated in National Geographic magazine.

Where were PBS's ""BATTLEFIELD DETECTIVES"" when this PBS' DVD was made - when these BATTLEFIELD DETECTIVES were so DESPERATELY needed - to explain the archeological record revealed by the 1984-1985 archeological excavations?

Parenthetically, shortly after the post-1983 archeological excavations of Custer Battlefield, I had several lengthy conversations with Crow Indian employees of the National Park Service's Headquarters of Custer National Park Battlefield, concerning these archeological excavations.  The first Crow Indian girl I spoke to said, of the major prairie fire in 1983: ""Yup.  Got rid of all the rattlesnakes!""

This DVD contains virtually NO color footage of the SPECIFIC terrain - hallowed ground - over which the disintegration of Custer's battalion occurred.  There is much general and unexplained footage of the prairie (presumably located in or near the Black Hills), and some footage of SOME stone markers in the prairie grass, where some of Custer's troopers fell.  However, a viewer does not know exactly what terrain this DVD depicts, some of which does not even appear to be ground of the actual battle - although generally representative of the visually ""deceptive"" type of terrain on which Custer's troopers fought.

There is a visual shot of bluffs, to which Reno supposedly retreated, but this DVD only implies this.  Indeed, there is a COMPLETE DISCONNECT between this DVD's verbal commentary, and this DVD's visuals of the terrain.  This DVD does not specifically trace the route taken by Custer's battalion; does not identify names of prominent terrain features described in the literature (excepting - again by implication - Weir Point, but from which direction is this shot taken?); and does not provide tactical explanations of Custer's (apparently inane) piecemeal detachments and dispositions of his battalion's troops, and the progress of the fighting.

This DVD honestly states that the Battle of the Little Bighorn was, in effect, the ""LAST STAND"" of the Indians; that the Indians were the wronged party; that the U.S. broke its own treaty obligations to the Indians, and used the U.S. military to do so, to further ""White Imperialism.""

This PBS' DVD is in PBS' standardized 2-hour format, to apparently fit into standardized TV program time slots, which therefore imposes ARBITRARY time constraints into which PBS had to fit this DVD's supposed treatment of ""CUSTER'S LAST STAND.""

For this DVD to provide meaningful coverage of the details of Custer's Last Stand, and STAY WITHIN PBS's ARBITRARY 2-HOUR TIME CONSTRAINTS, PBS would have to radically edit the DVD's contents, to radically cull and delete some of the coverage currently contained in this DVD, which means most of the (admittedly excellent) biographical coverage of Custer and Libby in the first portion of the DVD.  That would enable the COMPLETELY INTACT retention of about an hour of this DVD's current content, dealing with the Battle of the Washita, the Black Hills' campaign, the Battle of the Rosebud, Sitting Bull, the 1876 Indian campaign, and Reno's attack on the Indian village.  At least an entire hour could then be devoted to provide meaningful, detailed coverage of Custer's Last Stand, including a completely new interpretation of the disintegration and final destruction of Custer's battalion, in accordance with recent revelations by the archeological record.

PBS has ample talent who could present blockbuster coverage of Custer's Last Stand, including PBS' easy ability to convey this new archeological information in a brilliantly insightful and highly instructive way - such a blockbuster DVD could be a PBS best-seller.

When this DVD reaches its ""Last Stand 'Scene Selection'"" juncture, this DVD references some familiar facts about the Battle of the Little Bighorn, and bases inferences and conclusions on those facts - without, however, relating these facts and associated inferences and conclusions to the context and framework of a TIMELINE as a unifying reference point, which would be a sine qua non for validly inferring and interpreting the import of any cited (familiar) facts and interpretations therefrom.

In conclusion, more books have supposedly been written about Custer's Last Stand than any other U.S. battle in history, except for the Battle of Gettysburg.  What is the reason for this continuing, gripping fascination with Custer's Last Stand, which involved only a few hundred U.S. troops?

The producers of DVDs about Custer's Last Stand seem to believe that the continued, gripping public fascination with Custer's Last Stand is due to this event's supposed ""mystery.""  For this apparent reason, DVD producers seem compelled to compulsively continue to stridently engage in ridiculous, pathetic, and embarrassingly absurd attempts to inject ""mystery"" elements into their depictions of Custer's Last Stand.

I always had a completely different idea.  I believe that Custer's Last Stand, and Reno's attack on the Indian village and panicked retreat to the bluffs, are basically horror stories, from the perspective of ""White"" psychology.  Horror is the reason why contemporary investigators of Custer's Last Stand wanted to know from the Indians whether the Indians took any prisoners, to subject to the horror of Indian torture.  These horror elements of Indian warfare out-horror the horror fiction of Edgar Allen Poe or Steven King.  ""Horror"" is a subject of ""entertainment"" that sells extremely well to the consuming public.

The horror element in fighting Indians, including the horrifying prospect of being taken prisoner by Indians, underlies the old adage: ""SAVE YOUR LAST BULLET FOR YOURSELF.""

A possible enormous irony of this PBS DVD is that that the ""Custer Myth,"" of each trooper of Custer's battalion valiantly fighting against impossible odds, to the ""last man"" and ""last shell,"" did not happen and that ""Last Stand Hill"" wasn't even where any real ""last stand"" of Custer's battalion may have occurred.  The irony is that the valiant 7th Cavalry's resistance took place virtually nowhere within Custer's battalion, but at the Indian's 36 hour siege of the Reno-Benteen battlefield, and this defense at the Reno-Benteen battlefield was most likely lead by Captain Benteen himself!  That is what the archeological record seems to indicate, of ""Custer's"" fight.

Also, ironically, the ""Last Stand"" of the 7th Cavalry Regiment was at the Reno-Benteen battlefield, rather than at the Custer battalion's ""Last Stand.""

Aside from this DVD's GLARING OMISSION of any meaningful, detailed treatment of Custer's Last Stand, my one criticism of the coverage this DVD actually does contain is this DVD's superficial, ludicrously one-sided, biased treatment of U.S. Army Captain Benteen who, truth be told, is recorded as being the ""heart and soul"" of the U.S. cavalry's defense at the Reno-Benteen battlefield during its 36-hour siege by Indian warriors, during which time Captain Benteen's superior officer, Major Reno, is presented as impaired by being drunk on whiskey.

What I have read states that at the Reno-Benteen battlefield, Captain Benteen was constantly moving about his troops, advising and encouraging his troops, setting a personal example to inspire his troops, and personally exposing himself to enemy fire while doing so, in Benteen's disregard of his own personal safety.

At one point, at least, a counterattack was ordered to repulse encroaching Indian warriors closing in on the cavalry's defense perimeter, and I believe - but am not certain - that Benteen personally lead at least one such charge.

It's said that if another officer, of Benteen's caliber, had not been present instead of Benteen to direct the U.S. cavalry troopers' defense at the Reno-Benteen battlefield, the Reno and Benteen battalions of the 7th Cavalry would have been destroyed by the Indians, just like Custer's.

Most critically, PBS's DVD FAILS TO STATE that the Custer trumpeter who delivered Custer adjutant Cooke's note to Benteen was an Italian immigrant WHO DID NOT SPEAK ENGLISH, and that Benteen did in fact attempt to question this Italian regarding relevant details of Custer's circumstances and intentions.

This DVD also blames Benteen for the destruction of Custer's battalion, without providing any judicious explanation and justification for this accusation against Benteen - particularly as there were extenuating circumstances affecting Benteen.  For example, Benteen had just joined Reno's defeated and PSYCHOLOGICALLY SHATTERED battalion, which had just been physically decimated by severe casualties sustained from Indian warriors - as the troopers of Benteen's battalion could PLAINLY OBSERVE, including the obvious fact that instead of running away (as everyone assumed), the Indians were fighting like hell, as evidenced by the severe defeat of one of the three major battalions (Reno's) of the 7th Cavalry.

Everyone reads Custer Adjutant Cooke's ""note"" (""order,"" to Custer apologists) in COMPLETE, EX POST FACTO, HINDSIGHT.  Cooke's ""note"" does not indicate that Custer's battalion IS IN IMMEDIATE PERIL or even engaged in actual combat, but that Custer needed more men to round up the inhabitants of the Indian ""village,"" which were probably seen by Custer's battalion as being in flight.

Benteen's SUPERIOR military officer, Major Reno, had requested Benteen's immediate assistance to brace Reno's shattered battalion, which was seen by Benteen as - unlike Benteen's knowledge of Custer's battalion - being in IMMEDIATE PERIL.  However, PBS's DVD presents Benteen's conduct, in not immediately moving out to support Custer, as being EXCLUSIVELY DUE to Benteen's animus toward Custer individually, while PBS simultaneously ignores Benteen's consistently dedicated concern for the welfare of ordinary U.S. cavalry troopers (including Reno's troopers)  - ergo, PBS suggests that Benteen callously allowed 210 U.S. cavalry troopers be slaughtered solely due to Benteen's animus to one single U.S. Army officer, Custer!

PBS presents Benteen's historically demonstrated concern for the welfare of the ordinary U.S. cavalry trooper as being due to illegitimate and unjustified animus, when in fact Benteen's animosity toward Custer was due to Benteen's legitimate disgust at Custer's reprehensible conduct as a field commander of U.S. troops - as when Custer infamously abandoned 20 U.S. troops of Major Elliot's company to be slaughtered at the Battle of the Washita, while Custer's exclusive concern was Custer's ability to parade 50 captive Indian women and children upon Custer's return to garrison.  Twenty slaughtered U.S. cavalry troopers, VERSUS fifty piteous, captive Indian women and children, ergo, Indian NON-COMBATANTS, on ""glorious"" display as Custer's vaunted ""battle trophies!""

In fact, PBS's DVD initiates PBS's biased treatment of U.S. Army Captain Benteen by PBS's biased ""spin,"" when PBS uses deceptive innuendo, with the words ""feels"" (twice), ""thought,"" and ""felt,"" in PBS's description of Benteen's view of Custer's reprehensible ABANDONMENT of twenty U.S. cavalry troops to be surrounded and slaughtered by the Indians - the frozen and mutilated corpses of these twenty slaughtered U.S. troops were discovered later that same winter.

PBS's DVD misleadingly presents U.S. Army Captain Benteen's concerned perception, about the possibly avoidable fate of U.S. Major Elliot and nearly 20 U.S. troops, as an apparent product of Benteen's warped or psychologically disturbed imagination, rather than as OBJECTIVE FACT.

PBS's DVD accentuates its apparently malicious, deprecatory, and ludicrously biased depiction of U.S. Army Captain Benteen, leader and commander of U.S. troops, by deliberately employing several of the most uncomplimentary photos which PBS could locate of Benteen, to make Benteen look foolish and ridiculous.  PBS selected these visually disparaging photos of Benteen deliberately and intentionally, because PBS's selection of all of the other archival photos in this DVD are conspicuously choice and consistently superb, even the including majestic photos of an obviously handsome and charismatic Sitting Bull.

NOTE:  See my ""customer review"" on AMAZON.com of an earlier DVD on Custer, from the A&E studio, entitled BIOGRAPHY - GEORGE CUSTER: SHOWDOWN ON LITTLE BIGHORN (1987).  This earlier, 1987 DVD has very serious credibility problems.  Although this earlier, 1987, A&E DVD was produced several years AFTER the 1984-1985 post-prairie fire archeological excavations at the Custer battlefield, this earlier, 1987 DVD (like PBS's 2012 DVD) utterly fails to mention these 1984-1985 archeological excavations, an inexcusable omission, even in 1987!  However, as noted in my ""customer review,"" this earlier, 1987 DVD depicts Custer's cavalry charges during the Civil War as unimaginative, frontal cavalry charges.  These depictions suggest that the nature of Custer's cavalry charges during the Civil War are highly relevant in evaluating Custer's defective performance at the Little Bighorn.

POSTSCRIPT (July 6, 2012):  DELIVERANCE!  I followed my own advice, in my foregoing ""customer review,"" and conducted an ""advanced search"" on AMAZON.com, for books regarding ""Custer's Last Stand."" This search revealed a book by Richard Allen Fox, entitled ARCHAEOLOGY, HISTORY, AND CUSTER'S LAST BATTLE (published in 1993).  A brand new copy of this superb book cost me $ 6.37, through AMAZON.com.  I highly recommend this unbelievably comprehensive, WELL-REASONED and OBJECTIVE book for details and extensive, innovative analysis of Custer's Last Stand.

Please see my ""customer review"" of Dr. Fox's book, posted here on AMAZON.com's website

Richard Allen Fox's book, ARCHAEOLOGY, HISTORY, AND CUSTER'S LAST BATTLE, published NEARLY TWO DECADES AGO, could have been the source on which PBS chould have based PBS's 2012 DVD, CUSTER'S LAST STAND, and PBS could - or should - have utilized Richard Allen Fox as PBS's principal commentator on that DVD.",1338595200,8,20356,5.496151379089159

8493199,5,B00652U6JC,"Very good documentary. It confirms Custer was an egomaniac, addicted to fame with a sadly misplaced sense of destiny. There were many items in the film that were unknown to me. I only wish the film makers could have delved into the personal history of the individual Native American leaders that were involved like Crazy Horse, Gall and others. Their stories are just as fascinating and complex. We visited the Battlefield two years ago and were deeply moved. There truly is a presence in that place. This documentary is worth the money, a great learning tool. We highly recommend it.",1523577600,,584,4.85
