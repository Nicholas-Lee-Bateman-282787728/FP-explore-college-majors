8692756,5,B00QSUYADY,"Typical of Tom Feldmann's instructional videos, you get a performance by him, a laid back, step-by-step breakdown of the tune, then a nice slow tempo split screen play through of the song. Does he try to mimic Skip Jame's falsetto? No.  Bearing in mind this is first and foremost an instructional DVD, do his performances still stand on their own? Yes.

You also get a PDF file of all the music & lyrics, some audio recordings of these tunes by Skip James himself, and a bit of pretty cool archival video of Skip singing and playing.  It'll take time, but the material included here is sufficient to help you learn to play some great blues tunes.

I got my copy of this DVD set from the Stefan Grossman Guitar Workshop, and like most of their other DVD lessons, this is a labor of love. No caveats.",1497916800,,798,4.445205479452055
8692757,4,B00QSUYADY,"Skip James is one of the highlight figures in American music.  He had a distinctive personal style, is as eerie is as ectoplasmic as a night at the crossroads, and is every bit as much a singer-songwriter as the graduates of the folk revival.  Learning his stuff is not just a matter of technique. With guys like him, Charlie Patton, and Blind Willie Johnson, it's a matter of getting inside their heads.

Tom Feldman gets in pretty deep with this lesson.  He has mastered Skip's moves and does a good job of breaking them down. He nails the performances, too.  The only caveat is that Feldman lacks the vocabulary to some of James' moves musically--you just get the positions. But that's enough to get you on the way home.  Btw, Skipper's CD She's Lyin' is essential listening.",1494201600,,778,4.642335766423358
