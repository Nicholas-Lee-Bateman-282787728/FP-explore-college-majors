4686080,3,B005FUTCCM,"It doesn't by far deserve a 5 star rating as others have given it on here, because this film is cheesier than spaceballs and hardware wars put together. However, it does properly illustrate the frustration of us Star Wars fans. We are sick and tired of Lucas' half attempted efforts at giving us what he thinks we want. Jar Jar was a tragedy of epic proportions and george is even in denial about that.

This film properly illustrates how George gave us all the finger when it comes to what we want. He's too busy sitting on top of his piles of cash that we so foolishly made for him.
At one point in the film, he even says that SW is his film and in so many words, to hell with the Star Wars fans that see it differently.

After spending countless thousands of dollars on SW merchandise over the years since the age of 5, I'm proud to say I've broken the cycle. Haven't bought anything with the SW name on it in over 5 years.

Gene Roddenberry started Star Trek. He led the dream. After he passed away and others picked up the light, the best Star Trek film of all time was created (the latest one). So George, if you can no longer cut the mustard and it's obvious you can't, pass off the legacy to someone who can carry it on from here. You're too old and crusty, give it up. You hate SW fans and you have enough money to be buried in a pyramid of hundred dollar bills larger than the Giza pyramid. So what are you trying to accomplish?

Why is it the heroes we grew up on have all sold us out? Ozzy doing commercials with Justin Beiber, Gene Simmons doing a reality show with his wife (or was that Ozzy?, oh it was both of them). Then there is George with his Jar Jar creation. How much disgrace and embarrassment can we fans take?

Adding insult to injury, you KNOW it can't be about the money. Ozzy,Gene and George have more money than their great grand children's grand children could ever spend. Do they insult us just because they have nothing better to do?

4686081,4,B005FUTCCM,"""I love/hate George Lucas, I love/hate him hard."" A documentary that deals with the ""Star Wars"" saga. Unlike most other movies about this subject this one is a series of interviews with people telling about their love of the original three movies, and the hatred of the prequels. It begins with people telling about how their childhood was shaped by the movies and the extremes they go to to show it. Not only do the people have all multiple copies of all the movies but the merchandise they have is amazing to see. This movie is worth watching just to listen to and watch the passion the fans have and how they almost crucify Lucas for what he did with the prequels. Interviews mixed with homemade tribute movies make the movie very funny and very interesting. Much like ""The Captains"", this is a movie that will appeal to more then just fans of the series. The most amazing part of the movie is that there are points where you feel like you should defend Lucas against the things people are saying about him. Overall, this is an extremely entertaining documentary that will appeal to all viewers, not just ""Star Wars"" fans. One of the best for-the-fans movies I have ever seen, and a very worth while watch. I give it an A.

4686082,5,B005FUTCCM,"In the wake of the Star Wars blu-ray releases comes the arrival of The People vs. George Lucas, which takes a courtroom video approach of looking at the phenomena of Star Wars and what its cultural impact has and continues to be after the release of the prequels and Special Editions.  At the heart of it all lies the bigger question of ultimately what does an artist owe the public who supports them, and does a change of direction signal adherence to one's ideals or a betrayal of them?

The film is broken down into four segments, all comprised of interview snippets and quotes interspersed with a myriad of clips from Star Wars fan films.  These clips themselves are often amazing- both for the techniques displayed in creating them and the passion that inspired them.  The interviews feature a range of creative and critical personalities: Chris Gore- nerdlebrity; Todd Hanson- editor, The Onion; Joe Nussbaum- director, George Lucas in Love; Doug Jones- associate director, LA Film Festival; MC Frontalot- a performer of Nerdcore hip hop; Glenn Kenny- editor, A Galaxy Not So Far Away; Jonathan London- geekscape.net; Ian Freer- editor, Empire Film Magazine; Kevin Rubio- director, Troops; Clive Young- author, Homemade Hollywood.  There are also contributions from such notables as Gary Kurtz, Neil Gaiman, David Brin, Bill Plympton, Boo Friedmann and Ray Harryhausen.

Ep I: Nerfherder from Modesto.  Mostly a retrospective on George's life and some of the significant events that shaped it, from a high school car accident to his experiences with corporate indifference to the art of filmmaking.  Lots of behind-the-scenes footage and photos from his early days.

Ep II: The Great Tinkerer.  Examines the release of the Special Editions and Lucas' reasoning behind making them.  One interviewee likened it to discovering a lost chapter of the Bible; others have a more grounded take- that the Spc Eds are like fanfilms with Lucas being a fan of his own works.  It's interesting how Gary Kurtz explains that the difficulties that prevented filming the original Jabba scene in Star Wars caused all the pertinent info to end up in Greedo's exposition.

An overview of the changes made is presented ranging from small- slight screen shifts and frame cutting- to 'egregious'- Greedo shooting first, the latter dissected from every possible aesthetic angle.  Questions are also raised regarding the existence of the original negatives and prints, which Lucasfilm maintains are destroyed.  The most damning argument against this claim is Lucas' own Congressional testimony when Ted Turner began his infamous colorizing of classic black & white movies.  Lucas himself argued that these films, which are considered part of our cultural heritage, shouldn't be tampered with.  Star Wars occupies this space as much as The Maltese Falcon does, so why would it be alright to alter his films but not others?  Or as is pointed out, why not simply preserve the original prints and use copies to make the changes?  Regardless of your opinion, stating that the originals were destroyed when they had to be restored in the first place is both insulting and arrogant.

An interesting aside in all this is Francis Ford Coppola's observation that due to the success of Star Wars Lucas has never directed another film outside of the franchise, and Coppola laments what other achievements have been lost as a result.

Ep III: Revenge of The Geeks.  The first prequel looms and the world holds its collective nerdy breath.  I have to say that after watching some of those fanboy reactions to the Phantom Menace trailer I am officially embarrassed as a human being; those were some truly pitiful displays.  Everything is in place- the stage is set, the curtain rises, the opening crawl appears... and it all goes downhill from there.  Juxtaposed against the fans' disillusionment with TPM is the argument that artists must be allowed create their vision... and take the audience's money in the process.  As to Jar Jar Binks, well- his popularity with children can't be denied or overlooked, which seems to be the entire reason for his existence regardless of his role in Attack of the Clones.

And then there's the one word that defines the prequels more than any other: Midi-chlorians.  As a fan I have to agree that this concept destroyed more of the Star Wars mythology than anything ever did or will.  Lucas took us from a spiritual analogy of having faith in yourself and mistrusting technology to a primer on eugenics.  Your spirituality and ability to lead now comes down to a blood test, not the power of the life and the universe itself.  Thanks a bunch.

In the midst of this are interview snippets revealing Lucas' passion for filmmaking and great relief at no longer having to answer to anyone how to make his movies.  Not lost in this is his ironic observation that after promising his father he'd never go into business and his own disdain for the corporate machine that he has now, in fact, become the devil himself.

TPM also gave rise to the fan edits: homemade re-imaginings of the franchise.  Born out of their passion and anger they're as much an artistic movement as well as direct shots at Lucas.  Honorable mention is also made of the Star Wars Holiday Special, which I'm old enough to have seen when it first aired.  Not a lot of time is spent on it and the less said, the better.

Ep IV: A New Hope.  Will geeks ever burn out on Star Wars?  The best quip comes from Todd Hanson who likens disgruntled fans to Sith lords- hating what they once loved and revered.  The topic spins towards Indiana Jones and into the South Park episode where Indy gets raped by Lucas and Spielberg- a very disturbing sight, even for a cartoon (taken from The Accused with Jodie Foster).  I wasn't previously aware of it and found its inclusion odd and unnecessary until it segued into analysis of that abysmal last Indiana Jones film and over-the-top assertions that Lucas' tampering with Star Wars and Indiana Jones has raped their childhood.  I'm not happy about any of it either, but please- get over yourselves already.  What I found interesting is that no mention is ever made of the Expanded Universe novels- especially Timothy Zahn's Thrawn Trilogy which rejuvenated the franchise- and their role in the scheme of things.  Finally, we're treated to a few allusions of George's own life being paralleled in Luke Skywalker's character arc through the trilogy.

This is a fun, informative take on the Star Wars phenomenon, overflowing with geeked-out moments that will make you smile one moment and cringe the next.  It's all about the prosecution's case as little evidence is forthcoming from the defense and what's presented here undermines their argument.  The verdict?  I rule in favor of the plaintiffs- The People.  You have failed us for the last time, George Lucas.  The sentence?  A settlement: release the unaltered original trilogy on dvd/blu-ray, take the truckloads of cash that it brings in and ride off into the sunset, free to pursue other endeavors.  Court adjourned, and May The Force Be With You.",1318636800,6,7107,4.933557611438183

4686086,5,B005FUTCCM,"The People vs George Lucas is a wonderfully funny documentary.  It is mostly made up of longtime fans expressing their longtime admiration for the original Star Wars trilogy and distain for the special edition version and abysmal prequel trilogy.  This documentary is worth watching for the Star Wars Holiday Special alone.  I was laughing my brains out watching that, along with the South Park scene of George Lucas raping Indiana Jones.  Then the Misery sequence with the crazy fan wanting George Lucas to rewrite the prequel trilogy was hilarious.  Seriously you have to watch this DVD if you are a fan of the movies those 3 clips are worth the price of the documentary.

Having been born in 1980 I was on the tail end of the original Star Wars toy run.  I had several of the action figures and some of the huge toys.  They were cool and fun to play with as a child. I did not worship or buy everything that had the name Star Wars on it like most of the fans in this documentary.  I moved onto G.I. Joe figures because they could bend their arms and legs unlike the Star Wars figures and it was always a challenge putting together the huge toys when they came in 100 different pieces it was like a fun puzzle.

I consider myself a fan of the original trilogy and did not mind the special edition versions of A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back.  Yes Han did shoot first but I could live with that.  I enjoyed seeing the battle on the Deathstar surface with the different shots of the X-wings and Tie fighters.  But Lucas butchered Return of the Jedi.  The dance scene in Jabbas palace was horrible and he totally screwed up the ending which was sacrilege.  The movie ended perfectly whether you liked the Ewoks or not.  Whats more is that revised ROTJ ending does not fit into any of the timeline of the book series that followed after Return of the Jedi.  The empire still held Coruscant doubtful there would be parades and fireworks.  I thought Cloud City was abandoned under imperial control.

The documentary does a good job of showing how excited everyone was for the premiere of Episode 1 The Phantom Menace.  It was a huge deal and had more hype than any movie in motion picture history.  The reactions from the fans is exactly how I felt.  The prequel trilogy sucked.  It did not kinda suck, or sort of suck it was a full on turd.  You can shine it up as much as you want but all 3 installments of the prequel trilogy are garbage.  I get sick of people claiming that Revenge of the Sith was ok or somewhat decent.  That is BS it was awful, go back and watch it again people or read my review for that movie.  I found it ironic that these fans kept going to see Phantom Menace over and over hoping that it would get better.  Or the fan that gave up and would not even go see Episode 3 because he had lost all faith in the franchise.

I feel these fans pain.  These same people held George Lucas and Steven Spielberg on pedestals as great film makers that could do no wrong.  Until the Special Editions came out, then a dark cloud loomed on the horizon and the blasphemous prequel trilogy followed in its wake.  Followed by Indiana Jones 4 Kingdom of the Crystal Skull which was terrible.  Truth be told if Lucas wanted to do another Indy movie he should have done it 15 years ago while Harrison Ford was still in his prime around the time just after  The Fugitive movie.  It is hard to watch our favorite actors get feeble and old.  It is like a going to a Rolling Stones concert now compared to the mid 1970s.  Which representation of the band do you want to stick in your memory.

I have 2 young children and when they are old enough to understand and appreciate Star Wars I will break out the old VHS player and play the THX original trilogy versions, so they can see the films in all there glory.  Not the Special Edition versions and certainly not the prequel trilogy.

As for the new films by Disney the jury is still out but I enjoyed The Force Awakens.  The acting was not dumbed down and the director did not treat his fans like Neanderthals.  A lot of the elements were taken from a New Hope but the acting was very good so was the story.  There is hope that J.J. Abrams can make the next film totally original and exciting not just a bad repeat of The Empire Strikes Back like the Clones Wars was.

Overall this is a very funny documentary.  Jaded fans of Star Wars will really appreciate the time and effort put into the film.  I would rate this 5 stars it is funny, just be prepared for some profanity and lots of laughs.",1455062400,,4547,4.3278106508875736

4686088,5,B005FUTCCM,"Must-See for Any Star Wars Fan!
  The People vs George Lucas is an entertaining, well-presented analysis of the on-going love-hate relationship that exists between Star Wars fans - particularly those that had grown up with the Original Trilogy (Episodes IV-VI),  and George Lucas. The original trilogy was created in the late '70s -
80's, long before digital effects and under financial constraint (the original Star Wars, Episode IV, was expected to be a flop). Many fans that grew up with the Original Trilogy accepted the movies as they were, flaws and all - and that was fine with them, and there was a great admiration for Lucas.
  As new technology, particularly the advent of digital effects. became available, new ""editions"" of the original trilogy were released. At first, some of the changes were improvements - correcting visual errors, adding more explosions, etc... However, with the release of the much anticipated prequel trilogy (Episodes I-III) between 1999-2005, long-time, hard core devotees began to be disollusioned with Mr. Lucas. The disappointing Episode I, and the entire new prequel trilogy, were over-laden with CGI and digital characters that became the source of much resentment (see Jar-Jar binks). Further, Lucas went back and added unnecessary CGI to the Original Trilogy, poorly edited Episode IV's famous ""Han-shot first"" scene to change the introduction of a much beloved character, and generally changed the films for the worse.
  The People vs George Lucas chronicles the controversial manipulation of one of the most popular movie franchises of all time. It does so with slick humor that includes many fan-created pieces and is must-see for any Star Wars fan who knows ""Han shot first"" and cringes everytime Vader says ""NOOOOOO"" at the end of Episode VI.",1454371200,,1792,5.2229965156794425

4686091,5,B005FUTCCM,"I tried to watch this last year but since I hadn't seen the prequels I couldn't get into it.  Then I finally watched the prequels last weekend and truly they are as bad as everyone has been saying.  Anybody who says otherwise just wasn't there in the 70's.  No matter what kind of excuse you try to make for them, the prequels were shocking.  After seeing them it was a blast to see this movie.  What a masterpiece, it captures the cultural phenomena from all angles and documents it perfectly.  Cultural history owes these guys a debt of gratitude.  My take on the whole phenomena from 1977 to 2006 is that by being as bad as they were, the prequels have given us a more robust and interesting cultural phenomena to remember and discuss and probe, than had they been just passable.  And this movie is the culmination of all of that energy, both positive and negative.  Kudos to the film makers.

4686097,4,B005FUTCCM,"When the new re-digitized enhanced versions of the original three Star Wars films (now called Episodes IV-VI) were released in the late 1990's, some fans were outraged about certain elements. While overall, the enhancements did improve on the original, particularly the scenes in space, a few little ""changes"", some hardcover fans protested. The two biggest annoyances were from the first film: the killing of the agent in employ to Jabba the Hutt in the bar at Los Eisles Spaceport. In the enhancement, the agent fires first, then Han fires his gun, unlike the original. Fans who had seen the original more times than going on dates during adolescents complained it diminished Solo's character from being ""dangerous"" and ""unpredictable"". Problem no. 2: the inserting of a scene with Jabba Hutt in discussion with Solo outside the Millennium Falcon. I think those two things might be questionable but they didn't really hurt the new enhancements significantly. But if fans were nit-picky about these aspects with the new versions, they didn't know what being unhappy with Star Wars was really about.

Most fans would admonish the new films of the series, the prequels, Episodes I-III. Bad characterizations, particularly Jar-Jar Binks, bad writing, silly dialog, and terrible acting plague the more recent films. If these films had been not great but good, I think fans could have lived with that. But these films were for the most part god-awful. The visuals were good, but visuals don't make up for a bad story and really bad screen writing. Although the films made a zillion dollars at the box office, most fans, including myself, were beyond disappointed. The resulting Star Wars product appeared to be what a 12 year old might come up with, not a seasoned filmmaker whose creative control would supposedly make the films incredibly good without the interference of dimwitted studio executives. (See my review of Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace, where I gave it 2 stars out of 10.) I rated Episode III a mere 5 stars, that would be barely a C- without much entertainment value but still better than Menace. However my minimum for real entertainment value is 7.

The present film, called The People vs. George Lucas, is a kind of cinematic hate mail response to Lucas from the fans of Star Wars in the form of a loose-format documentary. The film is mainly about how the fans of the original Star Wars films, and a little bit about the 4th Indiana Jones film, felt betrayed by Lucas. The first part demonstrates how the original kids who saw Star Wars in 1977 (before it became Episode IV) and the two sequels energized a cultural phenomenon, now called ""fandom"". The first generation of kids in the late 1970's and early 1980's did more than simply see the films, they lived and reenacted them. They made their own videos, movies, and plays, even their own props, as well as buying all the merchandise for sale. The documentary shows endless homemade videos and movies inspired by Star Wars, as well as interviews with the most hardcover of fans.

These same kids were young adults when the new films were released in the late 1990's and early 2000's and felt betrayed by Lucas. I saw it during its first run at the Chinese Theater in Hollywood, and I remember there were screams of elation when the words ""STAR WARS"" in its special lettering took over the screen. But there was little to be happy about when by film's end, all of my group were talking about how dumb a film it was and how could Lucas have come up with something so ill-conceived and poorly produced. Some people regard it as Lucas' worst film since he became a high-budget filmmaker, right up there with Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. It may be the worst film to gross over $1 billion.

Some elements could have made the documentary much better. I didn't want to just hear endless fans talking about their disappointments. There's a few scenes where hardcore fans are tearing up their cherished Star Wars toy collections. Even one group of conspiracy theorists proposed that Lucas was in fact dead, having been killed by corporate executives circa 1990, and a corporate figurehead had taken his place which will do the studio's bidding! I wish the documentary had gone into more details about the releases of the original films and the newer ones, and offered box office and merchandising information. That said, the fans needed to have their say about why they were disappointed in Lucas. It shows that sometimes artistic creations can occasionally have lives of their own outside their creators. Lucas may be the creative head of the Star Wars Franchise, but he doesn't and can't own how fandom will either deify or vilify him for his next Star Wars creations. In a word, Lucas inadvertently created a Frankenstein's monster (the fans) when he made the original Star Wars movies, and now he can't seem to control them.",1429920000,,4907,4.838095238095238
4686098,4,B005FUTCCM,"The People vs. George Lucas offers very legitimate arguments from irate fans who basically question the sanity of the iconic filmmaker. Two very good points made by the fan base immediately come to mind. First, it really is a slap in the face to the special effects crew of the original trilogy to have a lot of their work replaced by CGI in the Special Edition films of 1997. Simply put, why tinker at all with movies that are embedded into our psyche for decades, whether we're talking about script changes, brand new scenes, or enhanced shots using CGI? Yes, George wanted to finance the prequels with the revenues of the Special Edition films, as well as CGI them to get them looking a lot like the forthcoming prequels. But to totally nullify the Greedo/Solo blaster scene in the cantina? Greedo misses from two feet away? What's this? The thing that gets people's blood boiling is the supposed fact that the original unaltered trilogy is no longer available? The original negatives are gone, thereby never going to be released on DVD or Blu Ray? This is just crazy, if true. And I want to know why George put so much emphasis (and time) on the pod races in The Phantom Menace; Anakin becoming a skilled pilot really doesn't have much relevance or impact for the remaining movies that he or Vader are in. Why spend so much time on them? To sum up, I think that the fans have a right to be furious at the decisions that have been made in recent years, as they continually get offered new products that are simply inferior and unwanted. I drew the line when Sebastian Shaw was completely eliminated from Return of the Jedi, then the icing was the infamous ""Nooooooooooooooo!!!!!!"" The People vs. George Lucas is worthwhile entertainment for those who can tolerate being frustrated for an evening.",1429401600,,1799,4.678233438485805

4686100,5,B005FUTCCM,"This film is about fanatical Star Wars fans and their love/hate relationship with George Lucas, especially after he started tinkering with the original trilogy in 1997.  This film is very informative, funny, and shows a lot of fan-made parodies, skits, fan-made edits, etc. that portray fans' disenchantment with George Lucas and what he has done with the Star Wars films in the last 20 years.  There is quite a bit of discussion about the Special Editions from 1997, The Phantom Menace (1999), Jar Jar Binks, and the raping of many fans' childhood - that is, mainly the original fans who were around when Star Wars (1977) came out, followed by The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return Of The Jedi (1983).  Also discussed is the slap in the face to the people who worked on the original trilogy (i.e. model builders, the special effects crew, etc., who won Academy Awards, no less) and how Lucas dismantled their award-winning work and replaced it with CGI.  I also got a kick out of the discussion about midichlorians and how awful that concept is.

Yes, anybody with at least a little bit of knowledge about these movies knows that George Lucas lost his mind about 20 years ago, becoming obsessed with CGI, making changes to the original movies, and coming up with everything from Jar Jar Binks to midichlorians.

For any Star Wars fan, this is a must see.  Let's hope the new Star Wars movie (Episode VII) is better than the prequels.",1422057600,,1438,4.728
4686101,4,B005FUTCCM,"This documentary, through interviews with various writers and filmmakers but PRIMARLY S.W. FANS, lays out the fans' beefs with George Lucas.  Primarily his tinkering with the original trilogy, and Episode 1 overall.  In terms of covering the star wars fans this doc had similarities to another, ""A galaxy, far, far away.""

For me, this was a bit overkill on the ""SW geek-dom.""  Oh, I get why the fans dislike a lot of the things Lucas did and how Episode 1 was bad- yes we all know in the original trilogy that Han appeared to fire first, and we know that Jar Jar was a stupid, stupid character at least for adults.  But for some reason all the angry fans going off for me was a bit excessive and made me very slightly queasy...  But I still gotta give it 4/5 stars, cause after all it is SW related.

Although it goes over ""Ep 1,"" one thing I was expecting and hoping for more of was a layout of the problems and flaws of episode 2 (i.e. lame storylines and bad love story, and the way Lucas tied the characters all together in way that made no sense and contradicted episodes 4-6).  But the documentary barely mentioned episode 2, if at all.

For the tinkering of the original trilogy, the doc lays out nicely the various changes in the ""special additions"" and why they were disliked.  In addition it lays out fans' grievances and in cases profound disappointment with episode 1.  Another interesting aspect was the covering of various ""fan projects"" and fan-made pics.

The doc also covers the ""Star Wars - Holiday Special..."" not that fans disliked it, but rather how Lucas practically denies its existence and refuses to let it to be viewed again.  For my part, in regards to the SW Holiday Special, which is considered (and probably was) infamously bad, did I like it?  He>> yes!!  I was 7 and would have loved anything S.W.  I didn't get to see the whole thing as my sister was babysitting me the (only) night it (ever) aired and made me go to bed; then when my parents got home my mom let me get up and watch the last bit.",1420329600,,2030,4.431266846361186
4686102,4,B005FUTCCM,"I watched this to better understand the perspective of devoted fans. Star Wars has definitely cultivated a deep base of followers. The film captures the impassioned views of a wide range of followers across several generations. I was entertained and give credit to the work for engaging me in the debate. Did George Lucas have every right to protect his franchise? Many disagree. The first three movies held the first generation of followers and the next three gained new ones but probably at the expense of losing the early ones. This film made me laugh inspire of my self. As one of the early followers, I held mixed views on the second set of films. Star Wars was and is a game changer. Through Disney and JJ Abrams, we be about to witness a regeneration of the older works. Watch this film to catch up on the controversies, laugh a little, and get ready for the new action!

4686108,1,B005FUTCCM,"I've been a Star Wars since 1980 so it's safe to say that I'm from the ""old school"" so to speak.  My first complaint is the way it treats people who enjoyed the prequels (I'm one of them).  You get less than 5 minutes from people who grew up with the special editions and the prequels.  The other times prequel fans have been treated woefully. They are either mocked or their intelligence has been brought into question.
Secondly, some of the statements by ""old school""  fans are straight up embarrassing.  Someone is moaning and whining about how much they hate the prequels and then goes into say that they saw the movie thirteen times when it was out at the cinemas.  Seriously, what gives? Why would you waste so much money on a movie you hate?
Thirdly, many ""old school"" fans complain about the special editions.  I'm fine with the changes except for Greedo shooting first and replacing Sebastian Shaw with Hadyen at the end of Return of the Jedi but I can understand why people are unhappy with the special editions.  Still I have no idea why they are complaining about it because you can buy the original editions on DVD.
I'm not someone who praises every thing George Lucas has ever done. I believe Star Wars has become too commercialized. They sell everything under the sun now. There are too many books, comics and toys out there that are seeing a reduction in quality.  I'm also annoyed with the lack of continuity in the Expanded Universe.
I would have preferred to see a Trekkie type of documentary where  Star Wars is celebrated rather than listen to a bunch of whiney fan boys who do nothing but complain.",1409616000,6,1620,4.57439446366782

-It examines the love and hate relationship that people have for George Lucas and his work
-It defines George Lucas from his early life to his career today
-Follow the economic and cultural times that drew people to the movie theatres and the inspiration it gave fans worldwide to create their own films and art
-Changes made between the 1977 original and all others after, specifically the constraints on time, money and effects when shooting in 1977
-Debate over an artists' right to continually make changes as they grow and a fans' right to fall in love with the original and unaltered artists' work
-Fury over Lucas' double standard that old movies shouldn't be altered and colorized as it is our duty to preserve our culture, yet his disregard for this standard when re-making Star Wars in 1977 and forever ruining the original film and prints
-The morph of how George Lucas started fighting against corporations and how he's ""become"" the corporation...bottom line merchandising is only successful here because of fans continuing to buy into it!
-Very neat collection of b-role footage from fan movies, skits and parodies that blend seamlessly into the different arguments

Overall, I highly recommend this movie whether you are a star wars fan or not, this is comedic and gives great inside perspective on George Lucas and the Star Wars trilogy.",1384214400,,1625,4.82437275985663

4686119,3,B005FUTCCM,"This is a difficult documentary to judge (IMDB rates it 6.7). It is like many film documentaries that hit or miss the mark at times. If you liked the original trilogy but disliked the prequels you will probably enjoy it. Fans discuss George Lucas, the Star Wars film and merchandise universe, the changes Mr. Lucas made to the original trilogy and the new trilogy. Overall, many of the issues raised are valid and are still being debated today by SW enthusiasts (e.g. Han shooting first, too much merchandising, edits to the original trilogy, etc.). Since I am a huge fan of the films I appreciated the fan-based perspective but some parts could have been polished more. George Lucas isn't even interviewed.

Most fans will consider this a must watch because the interview subjects are fans themselves. There are no major celebrities connected with this feature. If you aren't a Star Wars fan this won't change your mind because it does have some great moments but it is mostly one-sided in its attack on George Lucas. Overall, this documentary could use a good edit and polish. The People vs. George Lucas does manage to say some things that need to be said and it is remarkable how much fans are united against certain ideas (e.g. Jar Jar Binks, the prequel trilogy being a letdown). They mention the prequels (and Jar Jar Binks) being appealing to kids and I would have liked to hear more about that. After 10 years I still don't quite believe it myself because the prequels would have faded away by now without the original trilogy. It is amazing how quickly our heroes fall. Lucas was almost God-like in the 1980's but now seems more like a businessperson than a film director. However, the chin jokes move it away from insightful analysis to the personal realm. More insights about George's own view and response would have made this more balanced. Despite its length this documentary doesn't cover much in the way of new material for fans but does summarize some key issues with the handling of the franchise. There is much more to say now that we are getting new Star Wars films. The People vs. George Lucas isn't something many people will watch repeatedly but it's worth a rent. There are better Star Wars documentaries available (e.g. Empire of Dreams, When Star Wars Ruled the World).",1380067200,,2296,4.754385964912281

4686121,1,B005FUTCCM,"What a waste of my time. the whole thing was a bunch of stuff I'd already heard before. the same praise, but also the same old complaints.

My biggest problem was that it was just so one-sided. it was almost all older fans who grew up with the original Star Wars trilogy, and the counterpoint to the prequel trilogy was just kids, who only got a few words in. Episode I came out in 1999, and this was made in 2010, so there are bound to be plenty of people who saw this when they were pre-teens or teens who are older and have a better appreciation for the films. it didn't let those people who deeply enjoyed those films explain why. the prequel trilogy brought Star Wars to a new generation, and in some years, so now there are people who look back on them in the same way as fans of the originals look back on those films.

Personally, I grew up in the 90s, and before Episode I, I'd only ever seen a screening of the Episode IV special edition just once. I watched Episodes I-III all in theaters, and eventually saw Episodes IV-VI on DVD. I enjoyed the prequels very much, and also liked the originals, and to this day I love all six of them equally, and opinions from people like myself, who have this more open-minded perspective, were sorely needed as a counterpoint, otherwise you end up with an unbalanced rant-fest",1376006400,6,1324,4.3562753036437245

4686125,4,B005FUTCCM,"I was eight years old when my dad finally got around to taking us to see Lucas's magnum opus in December of 1977. It was as much a part of my childhood as kick the can (remember that??)  and peanut butter & jelly sandwiches.

This documentary brilliantly illustrates the disillusionment so many of us have felt over the last fifteen years. From the poorly made judgment calls in the ""special editions"" to the introduction of midichlorians and Jar Jar, it's been a rocky number of years for us folks who remember how important and significant his little space opera was to our generation. This film speaks to us and, surprisingly, FOR us. The film acts as an advocate for the disillusioned, but also as an advocate for the man who is ""the creator"". It does a great job of playing devil's advocate and is surprisingly balanced as well. It's not 90 minutes of Lucas bashing....it clearly illustrates the love/hate relationship we have. It's almost like the parental love/hate relationship. I've always loved my parents...but there were times I truly thought I hated them as well. The point being......he gave me some of the best memories of my youth. The original trilogy, Indiana Jones, a truckload of REALLY fun toys, and the desire to let my imagination fly to galaxies far far away....all thanks to him. Can I really bring myself to loathe him for letting Greedo shoot first??? The answer is yes....and no. Like any loving relationship, there are tons of grey areas. This film cleverly (and lovingly) sorts through those grey areas and provides a loving and light-hearted tribute to a creator/visionary, and those of us who love/hate the hell out of him.

Certainly a must see for those of you who cringed when the fridge was nuked, or cried out loud when Greedo shot first.",1362614400,4,1775,4.7752442996742674

The movie delves into George Lucas and his world, and some of the changes that came to him with success. It also explores the fanaticism of the Star Wars universe and its fans. Also, very fun, are the extensive 'what if' questions coming from the fans, including a love/hate relationship discussed throughout the whole movie. George Lucas is a hero, and a genius they say.... but... He also is a sellout, and NOW has ruined the greatness of Star Wars. No matter your opinion on George, if you are in any way a Star Wars fan, this is a fun watch.

4686128,3,B005FUTCCM,"I hesitate to call ""The People vs. George Lucas"" a documentary film. It is more like a passionate love letter (and hate letter as well) from millions of ""Star Wars"" fans in the world. Though I enjoyed listening to what these fans have to say, I think for many avid fans living in the time of the internet, the film has nothing new to offer.

The considerable portion of the film's running time is spent on interviews with ""Star Wars"" fans and the ""fan film"" footage. And it seems most fans interviewed here are disappointed and even angered by the reissued ""Star Wars"" trilogy, and their prequels. It is easy to dismiss their complaints as nit-picking - ""Who shot first - Han or Greedo?"" - but the film suggests that there is something more to the voices of the disenchanted fans. What it is, however, ""The People vs. George Lucas"" does not tell us much.

Another disappointing thing about the film is that we are not allowed to hear much from the creators and artists. Not surprisingly George Lucas seems to have refused to be interviewed (he only appears in archive footage), and those who agreed to appear - including the writer Neil Gaiman and the ""Star Wars"" producer Gary Kurtz - reveal little, and is very guarded about what they say.

If nothing else, the film will be a visual record that will remind us of the excitement of the time when we first saw ""Star Wars"" back in 1977, and then ""Episode 1."" It was a massive cultural phenomenon, something we look back with nostalgia.",1349049600,4,1485,4.5543071161048685
4686129,5,B005FUTCCM,"I approach this as someone who has never been a Star Wars fan.  I couldn't be bothered to see Episode V until its theatrical re-release in 1997 (I read the Mad Magazine parody back in 1980 and was satisfied with that, I guess).  So I didn't feel personally screwed by the quality of the prequels or with Lucas' ""editing"" of the original trilogy, and can approach this movie with a relatively neutral perspective.

Listening to an assortment of Star Wars geeks rant and rave about Jar Jar Binks and other perceived atrocities is hugely entertaining.  They may suffer, but by golly, their suffering will make you laugh.  On the other hand, they raise interesting points about just how much creative license a movie maker has once he released a presumably ""finished"" product and has gotten an audience to invest money & time in it.  Where does Lucas' personal ownership of the franchise end and where does the collective possession of the concept of Star Wars begin?  The more people discuss it, the more complicated it gets.  Also complicating matters is the generational perception of the movies, which is something I hadn't considered before.  The Jar Jar haters are people my age or slightly younger...people who were kids or young adults when the original triology came out.  By contrast, present-day youngsters have never known a Star Wars Universe without young Anikan or Jar Jar, and they seem pretty much OK with it.  To them, the latter-day suckiness of prequels is no better or worse than some of the truly awful features of Episodes IV-VI which older fans seem able to ignore at their convenience.

To take it a step further...eventually all of the irate older fans of Star Wars will die off, and be supplanted by younger generations who do not differentiate between the earlier and later movies.  This movie may end up being the only remaining evidence of a time, long long ago, when there were a bunch of people got really really mad at one man and his space operas.",1347148800,,1977,4.762463343108505
4686130,4,B005FUTCCM,"This is a surprisingly effective documentary about the fandom of Star Wars. It's not about the movies, or the making of the movies, but rather the effect the movie has had on fans. It primarily tracks the original generation of Star Wars fans who played with the original Kenner figures back when the movie was simply called ""Star Wars"". It then shows fans' reactions to the Special Editions and the Prequels.

The thing that makes the documentary unique is that it's comprised almost entirely of interviews and fan videos. There are some really funny videos - by fans - spoofing the movies. Some of them are really impressive too. Almost no clips from the actual movies, which I think helped show how fans feel such a sense of ownership over Star Wars.

The movie also gives you insights into how emotional Star Wars has become for some fans. I was shocked by the vile and vitriol expressed by some fans on film. Some of it inappropriate for kids.

There were two points where I felt the documentary fell short. First, the director could have used a bit more discretion in selecting the more interesting interviews/clips. I for one found the various fan Star Wars songs painful to the ears.

Second, the documentary largely sticks with the older generation of fans. I think it shows their journey well. However, younger fans are only given a brief moment on screen. It would have been interesting to see if (as I suspect) many of them like the Prequels and Special Editions better. After all, Star Wars fandom is still alive and well, with many who turn to the Clone Wars show to get their fix. I myself am in the in-between generation so while I don't like everything about the Prequels, I don't feel they raped my childhood.

Overall, this is a great trip down memory lane for fans.",1345939200,,1785,4.636075949367089

The People Vs. George Lucas shows folks from all over the world, not just 30's Caucasian Americans, bearing their souls over their relationship to that galaxy...far...I'm under doctor's orders not to finish that sentence...

Meanwhile, Lucas himself seems to realize that he has to poop or get off the pot. Despite his success at creating a machine that could crank out SW movies at-will, he seems more comfortable doing anything but.

There's even a rumor he's gonna abandon his grand Universal-like studio facility in Marin County and just put up cheap housing.

If only Ned Tanen, the bully at Universal who was so abusive to George, (parodied by Tom Wilson in Back To The Future), could have lived to see how his bad attitude and poor business judgment not only backfired, but how it sent GL into a downward spiral that has essentially destroyed everything we loved about him and his creations from his earlier days. Citizen George? Meanwhile his films remain available and viewable indefinitely, in an age of web-based fanatic instant feedback.

Do we long for the days when one had to write a letter and put a stamp on an envelope to tell the studios how we felt about their content?

4686134,2,B005FUTCCM,"Is there any movie that has more dedicated fans than Star Wars? I can't think of any that even come close. With the first movie coming out back in the late 70s, George Lucas has managed to keep the franchise alive and kicking over the last couple of decades mainly due to merchandise. No matter what, it seems like Star Wars can't die. Toy after toy gets released, and people still buy them. Aren't there enough Skiff Han Solos out there? How many do we really need? I was a huge Star Wars geek when I was younger, and like nearly everyone else, when Episode I was announced and I saw the trailer, I couldn't wait to see it. Seeing pictures of the characters made me come up with so many different things in my head as to how they'd be in the movie. All those Jedi! A bad guy with a double bladed lightsaber! A cool looking race scene! Man, this was gonna be great, and here it was- my moment to see the new trilogy in theaters at the same age as a lot of fans saw the originals when they came out.

Then I saw the movie.

I saw it with my dad, who was a big fan of Star Wars.

We never talked about it once after seeing it, and I slowly stopped caring about Star Wars until it got to the point where I literally don't care about the movies any more.

It wasn't until I checked out a few movie sites and message boards that I saw many people were just as disappointed as I was, to the point where it seemed like they'd be willing to kill someone over the movie. People are THAT passionate about this damn series! The People vs George Lucas covers what it is that people think went 'wrong' with both the new trilogy, and the changes made to the original trilogy in the 'Special Edition' cuts. Geeks from all over the world join forces to talk about how much they love and hate Star Wars, and what could've been done better. Luckily, it's not just couch directors- some real, big time directors and others weigh in on what happened to George, and how if he had continued to make films instead of sit comfortably, milking the cash cow that is Star Wars, everything would be much better and he'd be more respected.

Quite frankly, there's very little new information here. Chances are that if you're a big Star Wars fan, you'll already know most of what's being talked about in this documentary, and you'll probably have the same stance as the fans interviewed here. Everyone hates the changes to the original trilogy, the political stuff in the new trilogy was boring as hell, we all hate Jar Jar, etc. It's redundant and seems to be there as something to help make the viewer rest assured that they're not alone, that there are many other negative people out there. Fortunately, there are a few people who take a different approach and realize that they're not kids in the 70s or 80s any more, and that they've grown up, and that these movies aren't made to be specifically for adults. And guess what: many children DO like Jar Jar, in the same way that many children in the 80s liked the Ewoks.

What The People vs George Lucas boils down to is that the average fans thinks they can do a better job, and feels that George owes them some kind of apology for 'ruining their childhood', for lack of nicer term. It got old fast hearing the same thing time after time, and what boosted the score for me was finding out that George was against classic movies being colorized when Ted Turner got a hold of them. Yep, the same guy who keeps going back and 'fixing' his own movies to keep them looking more modern, was at one point against something very similar to what he does now. I also liked some of the animations and fan movies that were shown, as they helped with the pacing of the movie.

I won't/can't deny that I'm a big geek myself, but many of the people interviewed here are downright embarrassing to listen to and watch. If Triumph the Insult Comic Dog were around during filming, let's just say that he'd have a goldmine of material for the next 10 years or so just from the dozens of fans shown here. So much snark and custom t-shirts in one place...it's like a sci-fi  message board came to life and exploded. The People vs George Lucas is worth watching only for a couple of tidbits from the other big name directors and a cute girl or two (hello Cecil Castellucci!). Do you really need to hear about how much Vader's ""NOOOOOooooooOOOOOooooo!"" in Episode III sucked? Or about how Han shooting first drastically changed his character somehow? Like I said, very plain stuff here presented in an average manner.",1335830400,3,4517,4.3818615751789975
4686135,5,B005FUTCCM,"A great documentary on several angles.  It captures a good deal of the breadth and depth of the fan base of G Lucas movies (it is MOSTLY about Star Wars but has some Indiana Jones stuff) and all the activities of those fans.  It also lays out both a great case of wrong-doing of Lucas in mishandling his own legacy AND the great things he has done from creating the world to begin with to actually ENCOURAGING some of the fan films and fiction.

Bottom line, Lucas is a little bit of a dick, but could have been a much worse one, and we only think of him that way because he came up with such a fantastic universe for us to want to inhabit anyway.

I strongly suggest watching it a second time with the commentary on.",1330646400,,717,4.173913043478261
4686136,5,B005FUTCCM,"In the wake of the Star Wars blu-ray releases comes the arrival of The People vs. George Lucas, which takes a courtroom video approach of looking at the phenomena of Star Wars and what its cultural impact has and continues to be after the release of the prequels and Special Editions. At the heart of it all lies the bigger question of ultimately what does an artist owe the public who supports them, and does a change of direction signal adherence to one's ideals or a betrayal of them?

There are also contributions from such notables as Gary Kurtz, Neil Gaiman, David Brin, Bill Plympton, Boo Friedmann and Ray Harryhausen.

Ep I: Nerfherder from Modesto. Mostly a retrospective on George's life and some of the significant events that shaped it, from a high school car accident to his experiences with corporate indifference to the art of filmmaking. Lots of behind-the-scenes footage and photos from his early days.

Ep II: The Great Tinkerer. Examines the release of the Special Editions and Lucas' reasoning behind making them. One interviewee likened it to discovering a lost chapter of the Bible; others have a more grounded take- that the Spc Eds are like fanfilms with Lucas being a fan of his own works. It's interesting how Gary Kurtz explains that the difficulties that prevented filming the original Jabba scene in Star Wars caused all the pertinent info to end up in Greedo's exposition.

An overview of the changes made is presented ranging from small- slight screen shifts and frame cutting- to 'egregious'- Greedo shooting first, the latter dissected from every possible aesthetic angle. Questions are also raised regarding the existence of the original negatives and prints, which Lucasfilm maintains are destroyed. The most damning argument against this claim is Lucas' own Congressional testimony when Ted Turner began his infamous colorizing of classic black & white movies. Lucas himself argued that these films, which are considered part of our cultural heritage, shouldn't be tampered with. Star Wars occupies this space as much as The Maltese Falcon does, so why would it be alright to alter his films but not others? Or as is pointed out, why not simply preserve the original prints and use copies to make the changes? Regardless of your opinion, stating that the originals were destroyed when they had to be restored in the first place is both insulting and arrogant.

An interesting aside in all this is Francis Ford Coppola's observation that due to the success of Star Wars Lucas has never directed another film outside of the franchise, and Coppola laments what other achievements have been lost as a result.

Ep III: Revenge of The Geeks. The first prequel looms and the world holds its collective nerdy breath. I have to say that after watching some of those fanboy reactions to the Phantom Menace trailer I am officially embarrassed as a human being; those were some truly pitiful displays. Everything is in place- the stage is set, the curtain rises, the opening crawl appears... and it all goes downhill from there. Juxtaposed against the fans' disillusionment with TPM is the argument that artists must be allowed create their vision... and take the audience's money in the process. As to Jar Jar Binks, well- his popularity with children can't be denied or overlooked, which seems to be the entire reason for his existence regardless of his role in Attack of the Clones.

And then there's the one word that defines the prequels more than any other: Midi-chlorians. As a fan I have to agree that this concept destroyed more of the Star Wars mythology than anything ever did or will. Lucas took us from a spiritual analogy of having faith in yourself and mistrusting technology to a primer on eugenics. Your spirituality and ability to lead now comes down to a blood test, not the power of the life and the universe itself. Thanks a bunch.

In the midst of this are interview snippets revealing Lucas' passion for filmmaking and great relief at no longer having to answer to anyone how to make his movies. Not lost in this is his ironic observation that after promising his father he'd never go into business and his own disdain for the corporate machine that he has now, in fact, become the devil himself.

TPM also gave rise to the fan edits: homemade re-imaginings of the franchise. Born out of their passion and anger they're as much an artistic movement as well as direct shots at Lucas. Honorable mention is also made of the Star Wars Holiday Special, which I'm old enough to have seen when it first aired. Not a lot of time is spent on it and the less said, the better.

Ep IV: A New Hope. Will geeks ever burn out on Star Wars? The best quip comes from Todd Hanson who likens disgruntled fans to Sith lords- hating what they once loved and revered. The topic spins towards Indiana Jones and into the South Park episode where Indy gets raped by Lucas and Spielberg- a very disturbing sight, even for a cartoon (taken from The Accused with Jodie Foster). I wasn't previously aware of it and found its inclusion odd and unnecessary until it segued into analysis of that abysmal last Indiana Jones film and over-the-top assertions that Lucas' tampering with Star Wars and Indiana Jones has raped their childhood. I'm not happy about any of it either, but please- get over yourselves already. What I found interesting is that no mention is ever made of the Expanded Universe novels- especially Timothy Zahn's Thrawn Trilogy which rejuvenated the franchise- and their role in the scheme of things. Finally, we're treated to a few allusions of George's own life being paralleled in Luke Skywalker's character arc through the trilogy.

This is a fun, informative take on the Star Wars phenomenon, overflowing with geeked-out moments that will make you smile one moment and cringe the next. It's all about the prosecution's case as little evidence is forthcoming from the defense and what's presented here undermines their argument. The verdict? I rule in favor of the plaintiffs- The People. You have failed us for the last time, George Lucas. The sentence? A settlement: release the unaltered original trilogy on dvd/blu-ray, take the truckloads of cash that it brings in and ride off into the sunset, free to pursue other endeavors. Court adjourned, and May The Force Be With You.",1325894400,2,7065,4.933557611438183
4686137,5,B005FUTCCM,"I really wasn't sure what to expect from this film.
Would it be a ""bash Lucas"" fest or would it defend him?
I was surprised it managed to do both very well.
For all of us who grew up with the original trilogy who feel betrayed by George's constant tinkering this movie is justice.
That said the film also paints Lucas in a sympathetic light somewhat.
I do kind of feel bad for him that the Star Wars universe has become somewhat of a prison for him.
No matter what he does, it will never be good enough for some diehards.
I would really like Lucas to say ""heck with it"" and just start making movies again that are separate from the ""Wars"" universe.
Even if they bomb, who cares?
He really needs to free himself as a director and an artist and just go for it again.
In this movie there are TONS of interviews.
Both pro and con for what George has done over the years.
I think the criticism lobbed at ""Menace"" was a tad overdone.
I would have saved that for ""Clones"" lol.
All in all.
Funny.
Entertaining.
A must watch for Nerf Herders everywhere.

This documentary is loaded with clips of fan-made parodies, Lucas' backstory, preservation politics, honoring, and of course, ranting.

Yes, there are good criticisms here - for those who hate Jar Jar Binks, and remember that Han Solo did indeed fire first at Greedo.  But those themes are drubbed completely into the ground until you have heard far too much about them.  The editor should have cut the film in half.  If your reaction is like mine, you will want to watch this with your finger very near the fast-forward button in many spots.  The illuminating statements or moments are interspersed with far too much meaningless, vulgar, or tediously repetitive video footage.

4686141,5,B005FUTCCM,"""The People vs. George Lucas"" review

 First things first: I consider myself very lucky that I was the perfect age when the first ""Star Wars"" film debuted in 1977.  I was eight years old.  My father's love of science-fiction had been passed to me through treasured, dog-eared paperbacks that I voraciously devoured.  I'd seen a few of the classic 50's sci-fi movies as well, but none of them had made a really strong impression on me.  I'd enjoyed them, but they hadn't tattooed themselves into my psyche, taking up permanent residence and make me want to re-enact my favorite scenes.  ""Star Wars"" was different.  I saw it eight times in the theater.  I specifically recall my father saying that he had been waiting his whole life for a sci-fi movie like this.  We both felt swept away by the epic scope and thrilling adventure, and it is still a very precious memory for me to have had the experience of being there at the beginning.

 ""The Empire Strikes Back"" was one of those hallowed cinematic rarities: a sequel that actually improved and developed upon the original film's story, characters and ideas.  A darker and more dangerous vision was presented to us, a world of betrayal and intrigue that shocked us to the core with its terrifying revelations.  Anticipation for the third and possibly final film was high.  However, ""Return of the Jedi"" was unfortunately where the worm began to turn.  While the third original film contains a magnificent lightsaber and space battle denouement and the bittersweet culmination of a long family legacy, even as a middle school child it still left a sticky sweet yet unpleasant residue in my mouth with the saccharine introduction of the diabetes-inducing, cloying cuteness of the Ewoks.  This obvious and ham-fisted attempt to appeal solely to the single-digit age viewer was unnecessary, unwarranted and unwanted.  The first two films had managed to draw in viewers of all ages with overwhelming success without pandering to one specific section of the audience.

 I still remained an avid fan of the franchise for many years afterward.  However, when the first of the prequels came out, my initial excitement over the prospect of new stories in this wondrous universe of possibilities was soon completely crushed.  Like many fans, I was shocked at how un-engaging, bland and BORING this new film turned out to be.  The characters had no personality, and the few that did were exceedingly annoying or just outright racist.  What I recall being the most astonished about was that fact that this world, which had looked so real in the original trilogy, had now been transformed into a sterile, almost cartoon-like environment.  Where was the wear and tear, the rust and scratches and dirt that made the world feel lived in?  Why is everything and everyone so impossibly clean and shiny?  Well, we all know the answer to that, and I'll not debate the merits of Lucas' new style of filming.  That's been done to death.  I felt I should say a few things about my history with the franchise so that the words that follow will hopefully provide the proper context for those may disagree.

 ""The People vs. George Lucas"" attempts to examine the rocket-powered rise and alleged slow, tragic fall of the ""Star Wars"" franchise as seen through the eyes of many of its most fervent fans.  While I also have a LOT of misgivings about what the ""Star Wars"" franchise has become, I've long since divested myself of most of my emotional connection to it.  However, I cannot ever erase the initial feelings of joy and inspiration that the original films inspired in me, and I'm almost always visited by a small pang of disappointment when I see what I feel is the great potential of the franchise continuing to be squandered or misused.  I will always love the original films, but even that once pure nostalgia has become tainted by what has followed.  I was more than a little hesitant about the tone that this documentary might have.  What I didn't want to see in this film was a long, whiny diatribe and thankfully, that is not the case here.

 What ""The People vs. George Lucas"" does very well is dive into those feelings of disappointment on the part of fans and asks: ""How did this happen?""  Well, it's a pretty complicated answer, and one that may not be satisfying to anyone.  The film is broken up into four sections, each one chronologically detailing the reactions surrounding the original trilogy, the special editions, the prequels and the infamous holiday special.  For extra measure they even spend a few moments with the horrific fourth ""Indiana Jones"" film.  The editor of ""The People vs. George Lucas""; Chad Herschberger, deserves an award of some kind for assembling and organizing a massive rat's nest of footage, both archival and contemporary, into a funny and bittersweet celebration of adoration.  I've watched this film three times so far, and each time I'm amazed at the film's dexterity in providing a wealth of visual and audio material that is succinct, cogent and very compelling.

 If you are a fan of the original, unaltered trilogy and pretty much abhor anything that has come after; you will most likely find yourself talking to this film a LOT.  Even after repeated viewings, I still find myself verbally and vehemently agreeing (using more than the necessary volume) with viewpoints and opinions that accord with my own.  It's an often unsettling and yet affirming experience to hear people articulate exactly what's been racketing around in your brain for years, and the film runs the risk of being too seductive in its desire to win you over to a point of view which you likely already share.  However, the truth is undeniable.  ""Star Wars"" is here to stay, whether you like it or not, and that is probably the greatest struggle with which many older fans must unfortunately wrestle.  Our rosy memories of the late 70's have become permanently shaded with added visions that we don't really care for and would probably prefer to do without.

  I won't re-hash all the various opinions discussed in all the different sections of the film because it's such an individual experience.  Each viewer will bring their own personal history to bear on the proceedings, and whether you agree with what you see and hear will depend irrevocably on your own feelings about what ""Star Wars"" means to you.  I can say for certain that even if you are a passing fan of the franchise, you will want to see this film.  You might even wonder if the filmmakers were somehow spying on your internal dialogue while they were putting the movie together!

4686142,4,B005FUTCCM,"I missed seeing this when it came to a few select theatres in my neck of the woods.  The main movie is broken down into 4 segments or ""episodes"" as the authers did it.  With a mix of fan reactions, interview footage with Lukas at various points in history.

Darkwater, HIRAM & thetraveler333 have the more in-depth reviews.  Anything else I would write would echo most of what they wrote.

I did like the easter egg extras more then another reviewer did, particularly the fan reaction to the 3D versions.  If there's one thing I would say that I would've liked the makers of this movie to delve into, possibly as another easter egg, is the expanded STAR WARS universe (Tales of the Jedi, the various novels, Legacy era, & soon the upcoming MMO) & how it relates to what Lukas has been doing.  Hows the reaction on peoples ends on that equasion?

Regardless, if you're a STAR WARS fan, particularly if you're old enough to remember even 1 of the original movies (long) before Lukas began with the changes then you do yourself a disservice by not seeing or having this film in your collection.",1320019200,2,1091,4.530612244897959
4686143,4,B005FUTCCM,"Patrick Naugle, DVD Verdict --The People vs. George Lucas is essentially one long rant for the fans. Although it certainly falls on the side of letting art stay as it was originally created--e.g. ""George, stop mucking around with your movies!""--it also attempts to lend a sympathetic tone to Lucas and his revisions. Although the man has made fans furious with his tinkering (and become the one thing he always loathed: a businessman), moviegoers also wouldn't have their beloved Star Wars universe without his vision and filmic genius. On one hand, the Star Wars movies are owned by Lucas, and he should be allowed to do whatever he wants with them. But is it hypocritical for a man who stood up against Ted Turner for colorizing classic movies be allowed to rewrite his own cinematic history? Weighty questions, indeed.

Lest this sound like a downer of a film, The People vs. George Lucas is also a celebration of the entire Star Wars franchise; there are interviews with fans, fan films (some good, some...not so good), fan videos, fan writings (Wookie Poetry!), and fan appreciation for everything George has given us. Director Alexandre O. Philippe (in his first major film) has given a good portion of runtime to defending Lucas and his creations (well, except for Jar Jar Binks). Interview subjects run the gamut from writer Neil Gaiman (Neverwhere) and producer Gary Kurtz (The Empire Strikes Back), to casual fans and fan filmmakers, all offering their personal opinions on the subject. While I wouldn't consider this an exhaustive dissertation on the Star Wars universe, it's certainly a fun look at how fans feel about Lucas and the decisions he's made.

When the dust finally settles, The People vs. George Lucas doesn't really provide any rock solid answers. Some think Lucas is the devil, while others hold him up as a film God to be revered for all eternity. While everyone seems to want the original movies as they remember them, the idea of art vs. its creator muddies the issue. Fans will find this love/hate relationship core of the film fascinating, no matter what side you fall on.

The People vs. George Lucas is presented in 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen. The transfer looks good, but is understandably uneven; some footage is reference quality (like some fun animation sequences), while others look mediocre (mostly the off-the-cuff interview segments). Considering the genre, fans won't likely have a problem with the image quality.

The audio is presented in Dolby 5.1 Surround and, much like the video transfer, the mix is neither exceptional nor poor. Dialogue, music, and effects are all easily heard without any defects or interference. Also included are English and Spanish subtitles.

Bonus materials are slim, but should satisfy fans. The best is a screen-specific audio commentary with director Philippe, cinematographer Robert Muratore, and editor Chard Herschberger; the three presenting a lively discussion of the production. We also get bonus interviews with producer Gary Kurtz, deleted poetry slam footage (yawn), a comment on the forthcoming 3D versions, and a music video for the subtly titled song ""George Lucas Raped Our Childhood.""

8470705,2,B005FUTCCM,"I learned of this film from Red Letter Media when they had a bit/interview with creator Alexandre Philippe. I have to say, I enjoyed the RLM interview with the creator of the documentary more than the documentary itself.
The People Vs George Lucas is a film about the love/hate relationship between Star Wars fans and George Lucas. For one, as of 2016, this documentary feels a bit dated already; Disney controls everything Star Wars related so a lot of the discussion here is no longer relevant. Number two; besides Disney, I found the documentary just a bit messy.

It's difficult to explain, but I found this movie to be all over the place. It jumped from one topic to the next too much and didn't really make me care for any of the arguments against George Lucas and what he has done with Star Wars. The documentary is also a bit one-sided, as it 99% of it features people who oppose everything George Lucas has done with Star Wars since the 90's. What about people that actually liked his changes?  Because I'm sure some of those people exist. The movie only really critically analyzes ""A New Hope"" and ""The Phantom Menace"" as well. What about the other four films?
One of the main topics I liked in this film was when they focused on how George Lucas changed the movies (especially episode four) when his film is now 1) in the national film registry and 2) belongs to the fans. Philippe talked a lot with Red Letter Media about this. Does he has a right to change the films or do they belong the the fans? I honestly think that this subject should have been the main and only focus of the film; Lucas altering the original films that is. A significant chunk of the documentary is, instead, spent on introducing us to the documentary and Star Wars fandom, and how much people hate ""The Phantom Menace"" and the prequels. At most, a footnote would have been nice that people dislike him because of the prequels. But I think there is a bigger philosophical subject in asking if George Lucas has the right to alter the original films and never release the theatrical versions.

I would have liked to see a documentary more on the philosophical discussion of Lucas being allowed to alter the original films and not  release the original theatrical cuts. Instead, we got a very long documentary on things I don't care about that are related to Star Wars. My advice; again, can't say it enough. Watch the Red Letter Media interview with Philippe. It was more enjoyable than the documentary itself, and the director/creator of this film actually is an insightful guy. I think he should have featured himself in the documentary, instead of all these random Star Wars fans.",1476662400,,2668,4.622362869198312
