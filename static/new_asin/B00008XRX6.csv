There are plenty of marvellous show in the past that this new generation have not seen that would blow their minds. For now we take you on a journey to the police force that go beyond the call of duty to catch their man, a serial killer that isn't easy to catch. Now we all have heard this all before in other movies but this one is very more convincing than most, that will have you on the edge of the seat waiting for the next move. A serial killer a hostage and a determine cop that must win. The question is will he win or lose I'm not telling you.
