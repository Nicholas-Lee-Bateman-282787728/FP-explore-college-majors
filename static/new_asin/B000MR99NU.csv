8171267,5,B000MR99NU,"First let me say that all of my past experiences with Amazon.com have been very positive and I'll continue to be a life-long customer.
My most recent purchase, ""Mark Alfrey's Sculpting with Water Clay"" is no exception. When my DVD arrived I couldn't wait to pop it in my player and give it a view.
Mr. Alfrey is one of the all time greats in sculpting figures and his teaching videos are top shelf all the way. I don't actually sculpt with Wet-Clay, but I purchased this simply to see and learn from his techniques. My work is on a much smaller scale and now days is mostly for my own personal collection and enjoyment. My hobby is Figure Modeling with resin and vinyl model kits known as ""Garage Kits""..  I recently sold out my on-line business but my work can still be seen at:[...]
For anyone looking to enhance their sculpting talents, you simply can't do better than taking a look at any of Mark Alfrey's Instructional Videos, he has quite a few covering a wide range of subjects and techniques. The ""Wet-Clay"" video is actually three videos in one as he demonstrates three different techniques creating three different subjects. I'm not much on words, but I hope I've said enough to help you make a choice regarding this item..
Sincerely......JC Williams",1300665600,3,1260,4.650224215246637
