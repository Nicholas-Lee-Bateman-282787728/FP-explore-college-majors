5560102,5,B00B6RBT1A,I just purchased the First Season for my 10 yr old grand daughter because she loves horses ans is taking lessons now so I hope she will enjoy Heartland. My husband and I are now watching Season 6 that I got for us for Christmas. We love this show and hope it continues for many more years. The thing I like most about it is that most all of the original characters are still with the show. It's great to see how each individual progresses through the series and life on the show.,1389225600,,479,4.161290322580645

5560118,5,B00B6RBT1A,We always enjoy the Heartland series.  I do think that I need to look into how the UP version compares in Season number to the Canadian version so that we can purchase the Canadian version in the future and have the benefit of English subtitles for late night viewing.,1472688000,,268,4.469387755102041

8563432,4,B00B6RBT1A,"I love this show! I enjoy the characters, the horses, the scenery...everything about it. The only reason that I'm knocking it down a star is because there is no Season 7 UP version. I see where the seasons continue for the Canadian version, but stop at season 6 for the UP version. Why??? According to reviews, the Canadian version seasons are numbered plus one season from the UP season. So...I'm going to buy the Canadian Season 8 version and hope that it picks up from the UP season 6 version. Why don't the UP versions continue after Season 6. It's such a drag when the ""powers that be"" manage to screw up a fantastic show with frustrations and obstacles like this!!",1524182400,,670,4.545454545454546
