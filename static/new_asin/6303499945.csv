7848764,3,6303499945,"The plot: A grieving fortysomething widow (Ingrid Bergman) becomes entangled with a troubled young gambler (Rip Torn) in Monte Carlo circa 1900. The acting is fine, though the story lost much of its emotional impact in the translation from Zweig's novella to the small screen. The result is not a classic, but not awful either.

The script is by John Mortimer, and the supporting cast includes John Williams and Jerry Orbach.

This ""Revlon Presents"" drama special aired on CBS television in 1961. It was produced in a studio on videotape but survives here as a video-to-film transfer (kinescope recording). The Rhino VHS tape I bought was recorded at the slow speed, which means the picture quality is less than stellar. Still, as the other reviewer noted, Bergman is a pleasure to watch in just about anything, and it's interesting to see what Torn was like as a young actor just starting out.",1308268800,,894,4.875
7848765,3,6303499945,"I watched the video two nights ago. The movie is recorded in EP mode, HI-FI. The sound is not very clear, and the story line is not very developped. However, I am a big Ingrid Bergman fan, and her being in it, is what makes the movie so enjoyable to watch. Too bad the picture isn't that clear either. But listen... for (this price) this movie is a well worth addition to my Ingrid collection!",977356800,5,393,4.253333333333333
