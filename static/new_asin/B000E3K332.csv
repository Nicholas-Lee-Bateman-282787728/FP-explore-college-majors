8105059,4,B000E3K332,I thought this film was a refreshing adaptation to an age old story.  Very creative!  I enjoyed it.,1292716800,4,99,4.444444444444445
8105060,5,B000E3K332,"I received this DVD as a gift, I really liked it. I think I'll send a couple copies to friends with kids, it's really cute and a great classic story, I remember reading it as a kid I think.",1292630400,5,189,3.871794871794872
8105061,5,B000E3K332,"Very fun to watch, this was a Grimm tale that I did not know of so I was very surprised to see a new one. Kids and adults will really like this one!",1290816000,4,148,3.515151515151515
8105062,5,B000E3K332,A nice story that is easy to watch over and over. Deep colors and fun costumes make it appealing for children. Good to have around when kids come over,1289433600,10,150,4.206896551724138
8105063,3,B000E3K332,"You would think this film was made in the 1960s, rather than the 1990s.  It has a grainy look to it, but that is not a bad thing.  There are many beautiful images here, in soft, welcoming colors.  The plot is a bit thin.  There is a gratuitous nudity scene near the start of the film that serves almost no purpose.  If you liked ""Farewell My Concubine"" or ""Shanghai Triad,"" then you should enjoy this too.",1254182400,,405,4.276315789473684
