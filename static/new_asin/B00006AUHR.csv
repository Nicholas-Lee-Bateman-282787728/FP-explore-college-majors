1739247,4,B00006AUHR,"As with most things Muppets this can be taken on many levels with lots of gags aimed primarily at adults while still being very entertaining for the little ones. It has rapidly become one of my 18 month old's favorite movies to watch and gives us a welcome break from Elmo/Sesame Street. The outtakes at the end of the movie and in the special features also give some ""behind the scenes"" insight into what goes into a muppet production. Pilgrim the dog is also the most lifelike yet expressive muppet I have ever seen.
In many ways this movie is a muppets ""Stand by me"", a coming of age movie for Kermit and his buddies that isn't always pretty. If you are easily offended stay away, but otherwise step back and enjoy this little romp that gives us some insight into why Kermit became the frog he is today...
To respond to the other posters who object to the ""violence"", it has to be said that the bully bullfrog ultimately learns the value of friendship, helping others and self-sacrifice. Most kids will meet real life bullies soone enough, and I hope they can learn something from how these frogs deal with that situation. The dissection-happy ninth grade biology professor also soon learns the error of his ways.",1036540800,9,1216,4.608294930875576
1739248,4,B00006AUHR,"After 10 years of being shuffled back and forth between corporate gurus, the Jim Henson company is trying it's best to remain what it once was....a genuine entertainment company. This is getting harder and harder to do, since many of the Muppet trademarks have been sold off, piece by piece. I believe that this is a last-ditch effort to keep the Muppets alive in some form.
As far as actual Muppets, the only one familiar is Kermit (with the exception of a VERY short appearance by ""younger"" versions of Statler and Waldorf). Most likely the reason for this is lack of original Muppet performers. Jerry Nelson, and Dave Goelz, once principal players, are reduced to 10 seconds with the old hecklers, and Frank Oz, Henson's one-time partner, has nothing to do with this film. Again, this seems like a sign that the Henson name is slowly slipping.
As for the film itself, I very much enjoyed it. As for the people who did not approve of it's violence, they apparently never watched the original Muppet show (where Gonzo was routinely fired out of cannons and there was even a performer who literally beat little musical fur-balls senseless, all in the name of entertainment). This is what the Muppets are known for. And the creativity, although not quite as sharp as Jim Henson's, is still there (including a VERY clever reference to Henson is worth the price of the DVD alone!).
In my opinion, while this is not quite what it could have been, it is still a great movie. It's the Muppets. How can you NOT like it?!",1035676800,6,1513,4.649253731343284
1739249,3,B00006AUHR,"If I were to rate Muppet movies amongst each other, Id place Kermits Swamp Years somewhere in between Muppet Treasure Island and Muppets from Space.  It wasn't as loud, visually or story-wise, as Treasure Island, but it had the simplicity and compassion leaning slightly towards Muppets from Space.
The best parts of Kermits Swamp Years were, by far, the scattered in-jokes.  There were countless missed opportunities for obvious in-jokes throughout Muppets from Space, and I was disappointed after every such scene ended without one (but thats another movie).  The pig scene, while it had no point, came with an obvious, yet entertaining gag at the end.  The young Jim Henson, the Statler and Waldorf-like tortoises, and the Statler and Waldorf cameo (gods, but I miss their original voices) were executed beautifully.  The movie house scene was inspiring, and I enjoyed the fact that the swamp alligator was named Arnie; both mild references to the original Muppet Movie.
Now on to the dismemberment
Remember that annoying, singing kid from Muppet Treasure Island?  Every human actor in this movie made my teeth itch as much as that little nancy-boy did.  I have no doubt in my mind that the guy who played the 9th grade science teacher in this movie is actually a 9th grade science teacher in real life.  Why?  Because he sure as hell doesnt teach acting!!  And if he does, he mustve taught the kid who played his younger self in the flashback scene.  Both of them should be banished to accounting school to do math problems, as far away from the camera as possible!  Mr. Wilson, the pet store owner, was Jim Varney-ing all over the place, I thought I mightve hit the remote by accident and switched to Ernest Scared Stupid.  And why didn?t Kermit swallow that damn fly at the beginning?!  If he had, I wouldnt have had to put up with him at the end!!  (Although, his CG joke during the outtakes was a nice touch.)  At least the songs were bearable.  The song in the pet store had some great Muppet-style puns in it.  But the score just screamed made for video. (oh wait?.)
Ill admit, the movie had some slight saccharine issues, but the relationship between Goggles (the dumbest name in the whole film) and Blotch (the coolest name in the whole film) was probably the sweetest element the movie had going for it.  As long as you're not looking for good human actors, and are looking for great Muppet actors, Kermits Swamp Years is pretty entertaining.",1033603200,4,2455,4.747641509433962
1739250,2,B00006AUHR,"Henson Studios flails for the cash in a Disneyesque straight-to-video maneuver. Oh, Return of Jafar, what havoc you've wrought! Like every single one of Disney's ""milk the cash cow til it drops dead"" releases, Kermit's Swamp Years is low on original ideas (let's recycle every previous plot into one huge unimpressive ""new"" plot!), low on production value, and low on humor (at least relative to the original Muppet stuff). Seeing a young Statler and Waldorf is nice, and some of the ""outtakes"" are kind of funny, but even those feel so calculated. Finally, what's with all of the talk of killing and knife-fights? Since when was it cool for that kind of stuff to be so overt with the Muppets? Sure, I'm a diehard soldier of the nostalgia wars when it comes to Henson, but surely many people must agree that Jim would've never allowed a story like this to see the light of day. Bogus.",1033516800,7,884,4.673076923076923
1739251,5,B00006AUHR,"I am a huge fan of the Muppets and have been since I was growing up watching THE MUPPET SHOW. I've seen every Muppet movie and mourned on the day Jim Henson died. However, I wasn't sure what to expect with KERMIT'S SWAMP YEARS. I knew it was the Muppets, but it was a direct-to-video release and I haven't seen very many good direct-to-video movies.
Well, I had nothing to worry about because KERMIT'S SWAMP YEARS is a great family movie full of the wit and humor that's so characteristic of The Muppets. The story is a bit cheesy, but much better than most other direct-to-video movies. The editing is great and the soundtrack isn't too bad. The film introduces several new Muppets who are friends from Kermit's youth, including Blotch the bully Bull Frog, Croaker the Frog, Goggles the Toad, Horace the Horsefly, and Pilgrim the Dog.
Kermit returns to the swamp he grew up in and tells the story of the first time he left the swamp when he was 12 years old. Blotch and Goggles get in a fight and are amphibian-knapped by a pet store owner. Kermit and Croaker set out to free their two friends and along the way meet Pilgrim, are chased by a pig, and are almost captured by a mean biology teacher.
The extras on the DVD are a real treat. They include an on set interview with Kermit, a behind the scene featurette, trailers, and a blooper reel. The blooper reel is particluarly hilarious and the behind the scene featurette is hosted by Joe the Armadillo and is really entertaining. Youngsters may not enjoy these extras as much, but older viewers will find them to be a real treat.",1031702400,28,1583,4.5
1739252,1,B00006AUHR,"I have a three-year-old, and I am very selective about what he watches. I had thought that surely I would be safe with a Muppet movie. I was very wrong. The movie had more than a few potty jokes. The sinister doctor/professor yelled ""Shut Up!"" and frequently spoke in an angry and threatening manner, which was distressing to my child. Then the doctor conducted a class during which Kermit, his friends and some other frogs from the pet store were to be dissected -- a frog was even restrained on a dissection table. Fortunately, at this point, I had hit the mute button and begun fast forwarding the movie, while reassuring my child -- who is working to come to grips with his own normal childhood wariness of the doctor's office, that yes the frogs were just getting a check-up and then they would be ok and could go home. Again fortunately my finger was on the fast forward button, and took away most of the impact of the fight between the maniacal doctor/professor and Kermit, while the doctor weilded a scalpal and he and Kermit essentially had a knife fight. Who decided that this was subject matter suitable for young viewers? Why does our urge to be ironic and to put adult words in the mouths of little ones have to invade all areas of entertainment? Can Nothing be left For Children -- Just For Children, geared to their sense of humor and level of emotional development? My husband and I have chuckled over ""South Park"" and ""King of the Hill"" -- but at night, when our child is asleep. I don't want to see the outtakes from this Kermit movie shown before the credits if the humor is aimed more towards adults and teens than toddlers and young children, which I had thought was the target audience for Muppets. Sure it's funny for adults to see stuffed frogs grumbling at a human and calling him a loser, or some may find it funny to see a frog say in a longing voice that he's been a bad boy and needs a spanking and then see a frog spank him. But this is not what our children need to see. At least, it is not what I want my child to see. And my child, of his own volition, said he wanted to watch something else instead.",1031616000,8,2133,4.36180904522613

This Direct-to-DVD flick starts with a travelogue of a swamp.  That's literally the best part of this pathetic effort.  As for the rest of the movie, never has 82 minutes felt more like 2 days of unending banality.  Featuring everything from a CGI fly to a talking star offering empty platitudes.  The story is beyond basic, a bull frog and a toad are kidnapped leaving Kermit and another frog to rescue them before they are dissected in a biology class.  I don't know what kind of biology they are teaching these days, but when I went to high school we worked on dead frogs, we didn't try dissecting live ones!

What I have seen is a very kid friendly, adorable film that offered a wonderful story line. All the muppet characters were very expressive and had distinct personalities, and the rabbit at the pet store had me in stitches. It's a simple story, but has wonderful morals. The bullfrog and toad relationship was fun to see bloom. And of course, Steve Whitmire as Kermit can't ever be below my expectations. I think he's a great replacement for the wonderful Jim Henson, and he's often under rated. Joey Mazzarino and Bill Barretta were great as Kermit's buddies. I especially liked the bloopers. I wouldn't put this on a par with the other muppet movies, ie The Muppets Christmas Carol, but it is entertaining and made me smile.",1325808000,6,819,4.655172413793103

We must have watched it ten times before we had to return it. My kids are 4 and 6 years old. we are still quoting the funny lines from this film. I am buying a copy from amazon so we will never be without it.

1739479,1,B00006AUHR,"My parents got this for my daughters at Christmas (16 mo. & 30 mo.).  Both were excited, they had only recently discovered Kermit.

We do a movie night every week.  This movie was awful, ruining the night for the girls!  The 16 mo. old was bored after only a few minutes and the 30 mo. old was frightened.  She is very empathetic, so she was quite upset to see the bull frog beating up the smaller toads.  Plus, I'm trying to teach her not to hit and this video has puppets fighting!?  She was so upset about the bull frog, we never even made it to the disection scene.

My parents are also upset that their gift was frightening.  They thought it was ""The Muppet Movie"".  When we finally got the correct movie, it took two weeks to convince my daughter to try watching it, and that it wouldn't be scary.",1171152000,6,803,4.258278145695364
1739490,3,B00006AUHR,"This movie is very different from any of the other muppet movies I have seen to date, for a number of reasons.  Firstly, the muppets had the brilliance to appeal to children and adults at the same time--this movie focuses solely on the first group.  There is little of the witty rapport between the characters that really makes the muppets have their zing.  Its on level with ""Bear in the Big Blue House"" except it lacks the sweetness of that show as well, its straddling some middle line with humour that its quite un-muppet like (the mooning--which will probably get laughs from the right audience, but it seems demeening and below what muppets should do) very juvenile.  The plot is only so-so.  the songs, none of them really stand out except for the Me First and the Gimme Gimmes cover of the Rainbow connection, which wasn't even original to the movie.

What I did enjoy were many of the new characters introduced.  Croaker and Goggles are very enjoyable in terms of muppet aesthetics, they really fit in, but in new ways.  Blotch is a fun character but I didn't enjoy is character design as much he seemed a little too stiff in the body, the facial close ups though really highlighted the innovantions they have made with allowing the puppeteers more control of over the face--such as the eyes and the eyelids.  Pilgrim--eeeeh, the puppet design was sort of weak I though, she looked too much like a puppet trying to look real, they should have gone one way or the other.

I did not enjoy the disection scene (uh didn't we already go there in ET? maybe they should have found a way to pay homage to that)  Originally when the Mister Doctor guy was collecting frogs I was thinking Steinbeck's character Doc in Cannery Row (which is similar but not quite what they had).

There are enjoyable little homages to Henson in the film (""Let me give you a hand"") and if you watch the movie with the selected audio commentary on kermit points these things out--but the commentary is kinda boring really.  The bloopers are kinda funny--they are the best extra feature followed by the behind the scenes footage with Joe the Armadillo.",1167782400,4,2129,4.63031914893617

We liked the trailers shown on the Bear in the Big Blue House series we have and thought our son would enjoy Kermit.  BIG mistake.  Near the end of the movie one of Kermit's frog pals is strapped down on a table for disection and has a near rabid Biology teacher holding a razor sharp scalpel to it's throat while it squirms in horror.  I all but yanked the power cord on the TV to prevent my son from seeing anything further.  I am very glad we monitor what our son watches.  Who would have expected such a stupid move on the part of the Henson group?  Parents beware.  I like many Henson products.  This one is banned from our library.

I guess the true critic would be my two year old and she asked for it so much that I had to buy it to keep her quiet! ;-)  For some reason she likes the Croaker as she keeps asking for the blue frog!

1739513,1,B00006AUHR,"Most of the other reviews have adequately summed up what is wrong with this movie.  For my two cents, I must repeat that this is a bad movie for ANY age.  I originally bought this for my 3 yr. old son and stopped it halfway through the movie due to too much hitting, inappropriate comments by the characters, and also because I just couldn't stand to expose him to such terrible acting.  It is embarrassing to watch!  I later fast- forwarded and viewed the rest of the video to see if there was anything worthwhile and was glad my son had not seen the ""near-dissection"" scene.  He would have had nightmares for days.
This movie is highly inappropriate for ages 1 - 4 and I would also want older children to stay away from it as well.  The redemption of the character at the end is too little, too late and does not make up for the other situations in the movie.  Even if you think your child can handle the violence, scary situations, and inappropriate comments, I would really recommend keeping them away from such poorly produced garbage (cheap sets, bad puppetry, awful script and acting).",1040515200,7,1092,4.5126903553299496
