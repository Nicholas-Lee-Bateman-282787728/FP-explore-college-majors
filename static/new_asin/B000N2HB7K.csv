8174090,3,B000N2HB7K,"To make a documentary about V.V.Mayakowsky without once referencing ""The Cloud in Trousers""  is an unjustice to the great poet. Some recordings of his readings make it worthwhile, but Mayakowsky was, and still is a lot more than allowed opinion in the western world portrays him to have been.",1511222400,,292,4.959183673469388
8174091,3,B000N2HB7K,"I just wish this were better. The narration is just okay, but the content is so interesting and compelling. It's just production values that holds this back, but the subject matter is so strong. And sad, of course.",1399248000,,214,4.657894736842105
8174092,5,B000N2HB7K,"The man was a giant in his time ... his poems are still powerful ... to watch and listen to this DVD ... to hear his voice .... is priceless. This type of poety is loss to a time long passed ... but still alive. If Vladimir had just ""willed"" himself to live more than his thirty-six years. Some of his poems have dated, sadly enough ... but many still ring true enough today. This DVD lets one see AND hear, "" My voice thundering everywhere, I go, handsome, Twenty-two-years old.""  Thank God for the likes of Vladimir Mayakovsky...its been seventy-eight years this month (April) of his passing ... I still feel his thunder.  Buy this DVD if you want to witness a time ... read his poems to witness his LIFE.",1208649600,6,707,4.348484848484849
