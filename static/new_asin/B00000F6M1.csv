1203284,5,B00000F6M1,"my son was devasted that they took dragon tales off the air, so glad for this dvd, he loves it.",1301961600,,95,3.8
1203285,5,B00000F6M1,"This is my son's favorite Dragon Tales video. He asks for them by name-- I like the stories; they are sweet and always have a nice moral message without being preachy. All the stories are good, and the best one is where ORD loses his ""lucky stone"" and all the kids go out to find it in a submarine.

My son's favorite character is Weezy.

A good video series for kids.",1261785600,,368,4.169014084507042
1203286,4,B00000F6M1,"My 4-year-old likes the fantasy and make-believe elements in Dragon Tales - the story of a pair of siblings who go off into a fantasy world inhabited by dragons appeals to her as she likes making up stories and playing make-believe. The bonus is that the language is clean and each episode has a positive message such as the importance of sharing, playing fair, being responsible, not hitting, not lying, jealousy and how to deal with it etc.

In ""Believe in Yourself"", there are 5 episodes:
""Head Over Heels""
""The Balancing Act""
""Just For Laughs""
""Lucky Stone""
""On Thin Ice""

There aren't any bonus features, and the DVD's running time is about 63 mins.",1240531200,2,654,4.728070175438597

1203291,5,B00000F6M1,"After ""Blue's Clues"" and ""Bob The Builder,"" this is my 2-year-old son's favorite TV show on DVD.  It may take a few episodes to appreciate ""Dragon Tales,"" which was jointly developed by the folks at Sesame Street and Sony Pictures.  ""Dragon Tales"" focuses on different ways to deal with emotions and interpersonal issues. The animation for this series is basic but effective.  One of the more subtle aspects of ""Dragon Tales"" is the way it introduces classical music - the musical score is entirely performed by a ""concert band"" with full brass and woodwinds sections.",1111104000,10,568,4.957894736842105
1203292,5,B00000F6M1,"Once again, PBS has scored a hit with this Dragon Tales DVD.  Like most of the others, it has continuous play and play all, very convenient for parents.  My son is 2 1/2 and this is his favorite show, he will sit and just laugh and tell me about the show.  As soon as its over, he shouts ""again again"" and we pop in the DVD.  I haven't watched each of these episodes yet with him, this is his newest DVD, but he likes it as much as the others.  These 5 episodes are suppoed to teach kids to trust in their abilities and take on new challenges.",1105660800,7,543,3.990740740740741

7907049,5,B00000F6M1,"After picking up a Dragon Tales VHS tape secondhand, our 2 yr. old daughter was hooked.  Since then we've picked up about every Dragon Tales tape, book, and toy we could get our hands on.  Each tape has about 3 short stories on it, which is nice because it keeps the attention span of a toddler longer than a full length movie.  The stories teach morals and lessons like self confidence, sharing, helping, etc.",1363824000,,410,4.513513513513513
