7823923,5,630227088X,"I've wanted this film ever since seeing it on television, but have not been able to locate the DVD.  Settling for a VHS copy, I'm just happy to have it.  It's a wonderful film about a divorced woman with two boys, who takes photos that begins the terrifying journey; being chased by an incredibly evil man, her involvement threatens a mysterious man hiding from his past.  Cast is terrific, the locale is beautiful and gloomy (very much the Northwest - lots of rain and storms, adding to the story!).  If it ever comes out in DVD, I'm there!",1284336000,2,541,4.489795918367347
7823924,4,630227088X,"I think ""Fatal Exposure"" is an excellent movie. It has a well-written script that isn't predictable coupled with good acting and sure directing. It is one of those rare films that keeps to its stated purpose of presenting a good story peopled with interesting characters. There's a fine villian, an unlikely hero, some romance, and several entertaining twists and turns in the plot that keep you interested and entertained.
The cast and crew should be commended for their fine work on this film. If you want a movie that you will enjoy seeing more than once, then ""Fatal Exposure"" is a good choice. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have, and I hope it will be released on DVD. It deserves to be.",961200000,8,695,4.523809523809524
