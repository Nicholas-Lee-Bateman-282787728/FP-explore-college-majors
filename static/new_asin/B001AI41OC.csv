3448944,5,B001AI41OC,"Both good classic movies.
Both unrealistic but welcome to the 80's.",1413849600,,67,5.181818181818182
3448945,4,B001AI41OC,Two classic movies in one neat package.  I bought this for my kids because we are going to Space Camp in Huntsville this summer and I wanted them to have an idea what it was all about.  They loved it!  More surprising was how much they loved War Games.  They had so many questions - it ended up being an historical lesson on why the guy had to hook up the phone to the computer and other technology differences than they were used to.  Fun and enjoyment for the whole family!,1396224000,,475,4.175824175824176
3448946,5,B001AI41OC,"Amazing how War Games seems to be completely appropriate for the world today. Space Camp still creates an eagerness to explore like nothing else can. (except maybe Star Trek, Star Wars, and All Steven Hawking's Into The Universe series)",1393545600,,236,5.076923076923077
3448947,5,B001AI41OC,I purchased Space Camp and War Games Double Feature 2-dvd Set because I have them on VHS and the VHS tapes are wearing out.,1363305600,2,123,4.166666666666667
3448948,5,B001AI41OC,Thank you. Two really good movies to enjoy watching. Nice that they came in a two pack. Highly recommended movies.,1359676800,,114,4.75
3448949,4,B001AI41OC,I would have preferred a cheap Blu-Ray option for these great 80s movies that I loved but I was happy to get them nevertheless.,1345420800,,127,4.333333333333333
3448950,4,B001AI41OC,"'Space Camp' is one of our favorite flicks, as we are definitely space nuts, despite some of the obvious errors (Space Camp is in Huntsville, AL, yet the characters drop into Kennedy Space Center, FL, several times in the movie - it took us a very long day's drive to get between the two, not just 10-15 minutes.) and 'hollywood changes' (such as the hand controller on the multiaxis traininer); 'War Games' is also highly rated at our abode.  The opening sequence is similar to the training film I saw on my first day of training at the USAF Security Police Academy back in the early 80's, called 'First Strike'. A frolic with a very serious base story.",1321142400,,654,4.5423728813559325
3448951,4,B001AI41OC,"Space Camp - I think it is a fun movie about kids growing up.  They were put in a scarey situation, blasted into space where the only adult with them is hurt so they have to apply what they learned to get them back alive.
War Games - I think everyone has heard about war games.  Teaches kids be carefully what you are hacking into when on computers.",1267401600,,349,4.117647058823529
