8030090,3,B0002OXV8C,"The story is a bit lacking, and the characterizations of Siegfried and Roy are.... interesting. The animation is retro, but it looks pretty neat. I think, for a diehard fan, don't pass up on this, but if you're looking for something more modern, go turn on Cartoon Network or the Disney Channel, because this is not what you're looking for.

I regard this as a horribly guilty pleasure. I liked it.",1431907200,,398,4.605633802816901

8030094,5,B0002OXV8C,"This movie is awesome, albeit cheesy.  If you like cult classics and mystical stuff, you will enjoy this animated classic.
