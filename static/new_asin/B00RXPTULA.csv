6936380,4,B00RXPTULA,"Great DVDs with lots of episodes.  We use this for long car rides to keep the little one entertained.  The only thing I didn't like was the commercials that come on right as you think the episodes are about to start.  They are short, so it's not a big deal.",1442275200,2,257,4.1

6936390,5,B00RXPTULA,"This is the best show. It actually teaches kids grammer. My two year old loves watching it. It helped him learn his ABC's and what sounds letters make.

6936395,5,B00RXPTULA,"My toddlers love this DVD.

6936397,4,B00RXPTULA,"I love Super Why in general because it teaches children to read.  What I dislike is the number of advertisements/commercials before and in between episodes.  I purchased a DVD so I just want to see the feature.  Maybe advertisement just at the beginning of the DVD is fine, but before each episode is overkill.",1469750400,3,310,4.703703703703703

8696231,5,B00RXPTULA,"My toddler LOVES Super Why, and I actually don't feel bad about letting her watch it. She particularly likes the Hansel and Gretel episode, and wants to watch it over and over, which is great because it talks about healthy eating - eating a variety of things including fruits and vegetables, and talks about how eating too much candy and sugar is bad for us and makes us lose our energy. This has resonated with our daughter and she's LESS likely to want candy after watching Super Why. Not that it's eliminated candy, but at least it's positive reinforcement that she seems receptive to. She's also starting to recognize more letters. We are ordering more Super Why DVDs!",1513728000,,672,4.703389830508475
