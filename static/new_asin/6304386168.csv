854905,4,6304386168,"Sit back and enjoy the artistic vision of the commencement of judeo-christian culture.  i like my Bible and history movies to be as accurate as possible and this one did okay.  the serpent in the tree was portrayed by an ominous man hidden in the shadows of the branches which was silly.  all of the ""bad"" characters use lots of dark make-up and jewelry made of bones in order to villify themselves.  it's slow, but grand.  One wishes it could go on and tell the story of jacob and joseph and moses and joshua, but i guess a movie about the whole bible might be a bit of work.",996969600,,576,4.247706422018348
854906,2,6304386168,"From a scriptural standpoint, it isn't too bad. But the production is rather poor, as others in the reviews mentioned. The use of color in the film makes the scenes feel dull. And the acting is rather average.
I think this would be a good movie for young children, though. They aren't as critical as we adults and they will probably get more out of it.",995414400,2,352,4.348484848484849
854907,1,6304386168,"Read the book! Nice cinematography by Giuseppe Rotunno, but, read the book! The only good scene is when Stephen Boyd confronts the Tower of Babble. This is the type of film that put good actors like Stephen Boyd, rest his soul, out of work. By the way, I must say that Stephen had nice eye shadow. That is a sad testament for a team of good filmmakers.",972086400,3,352,4.268656716417911
854908,5,6304386168,"This movie comes up as # 2 right behind ""The 10 Commandments"" in my book. It is a good visual description of what it was like then.

855079,5,6304386168,This is a total classic.!! I love the music in Abraham's story. Every Bible believer must own this. It's not a script that's 100% Biblical but the actors are great and the stories are Biblical. I love it.,1523232000,,204,4.394736842105263

855081,5,6304386168,"On the surface John Huston, a professed atheist, might seem like an odd choice to direct a film based on the Bible. On the other hand, as a director notorious for biting off more than he could chew with literary works that were essentially unfilmable (""Moby Dick"" is an obvious example, it was perhaps inevitable he would attempt to tackle the greatest book of all time. ""The Bible: in the beginning . . . "" was filmed roughly the same time as Huston's ""Reflections in a Golden Eye,"" with which it shares a number of stylistic features as well as Italian locations and a score by Japanese composer Toshiro Mayuzumi. While never a big favorite like ""The Ten Commandments"" or ""Ben Hur,"" ""The Bible"" is interesting as an attempt to take the Biblical text on its own terms without a lot of narrative embroidery. Perhaps that's part of the problem: Huston was no Cecil B, DeMille, and the film lacks the sheer melodramatic exuberance that made earlier Biblical epics so much fun. Originally Italian mogul Dino di Laurentis envisioned a massive, 14-hour account  of the Old Testament, with each segment made by a different director. What we got instead was the first 22 chapters of Genesis directed by John Huston. Huston wanted Sir Laurence Olivier as the voice of God and Charlie Chaplin as Noah, but ended up undertaking both parts. Despite its uneven quality, there is much to admire about this underrated film. The widescreen photography by Giuseppe Rotunno (a frequent Visconti collaborator) is uniformly excellent. The ""Six Days of Creation""  sequence features a number of spectacular sequences, not least of which is a volcanic eruption in Iceland to represent the creation of the dry land. The Garden of Eden sequence is rather dark, and Michael Parks and Ulla Bergryd are perhaps understandably uncomfortable as Adam and Eve. Things shift into high gear with the flood sequence: Huston plays Noah for laughs, as per the medieval pageant plays, and the loading of the Ark is a masterpiece. The last half of the film is devoted entirely to the story of Abraham and Sarah, portrayed by George C. Scott and Ava Gardner. Scott's Abraham is a typically larger-than-life characterization, most notably in the scenes leading up to the aborted sacrifice of Isaac. Scott and Gardner generate plenty of chemistry in their scenes together, suggesting that Abraham and Sarah were a more passionate couple than readers of the Bible might have imagined. Zoe Sallis is delectable as handmaiden Hagar; not surprisingly she became Huston's main squeeze. Parts of the film have an almost surrealist quality, not least the nightmarish Sodom scene, choreographed by Katharine Dunham. Richard Harris (Cain), Stephen Boyd (Nimrod), and Peter O'Toole (the enigmatic Angel of the Lord) contribute memorable performances, and supporting parts include Franco Nero as Abel, Gabriele Ferzetti as Lot, and Italian screen beauty Eleonora Rossi Drago appears all too briefly as Lot's wife. This film is a fascinating though necessarily incomplete fragment of what might have been a cinematic landmark. There are worse ways to spend your money, and it's better than most movies available today.",1522713600,,3165,5.072936660268714

The Blu-ray transfer really preserves the 70mm quality of the original print and of the cast, George C. Scott is remarkable as Abraham with the still lovely but ageing Ava Gardner just fine as his wife.  Peter O'Toole is also quite good as the 3 Angels and the creation is brought together brilliantly by Huston and his cinematographers.",1521849600,3,485,4.563218390804598

I was a Theology Major in college (40 years ago) and the portrayal of ""the beginning"" seemed a bit lame most of the time, but that just may be my opinion.",1515196800,,291,4.388888888888889
855203,5,6304386168,"The key for this movie is the subtitle - ""In the Beginning."" It actually covers only the first few chapters of the Book of Genesis. Still, the acting is good and it is interesting to see the director, John Huston, do his own take on Noah. Some don't like George C. Scott as Abraham, but I think he works well in the role. Yes, this is not a literal retelling of the Bible stories, but it is a fairly good artistic rendering. I find the movie enjoyable and one that I'll watch often.",1508889600,6,482,4.193548387096774

855429,5,6304386168,"I saw this movie way back in the early 1950's in a theatre and was very impressed by it, which is why I wanted to add it to my movie collection.  I recommend it for every person who has an interest in the CREATION as Dino de Laurentiis brought the story to life and should be an inspiration to all Bible scholars.  The whole story was filmed with due respect to the CREATOR, but it also had its lighter moments during the building of the ARK by John Huston as Noah and the way the animals were ushered into the ark - a really beautiful, but also funny piece of work, especially the scramble to get the tortoises into the ark as they were slow creatures.

Did not really like George C. Scott as Abraham since all I can think of with him is his Gen. George Patton role, thus I thought Charlton Heston would've been better as Abraham, having already done Ben-Hur/Ten Commandments.  Also didn't like the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah scene, was just a mushroom type cloud in the far background, though back of dvd case describes this scene as 'mind-blowing'. The only extra on dvd is a theatrical trailer, wish there could've been a documentary also at least; all in all liked this movie.",1460073600,9,1081,4.811827956989247

856497,4,6304386168,"The Bible: In the Beginning is a religious epic film recounting the first 22 chapters of the Book of Genesis from Creation through Noah's Ark through Abraham's near-sacrifice of son Isaac. The ensemble cast includes Stephen Boyd,Ava Gardner,Richard Harris,John Huston,Peter O'Toole,Michael Parks and George C. Scott.

The 174-minute movie has consists of four main sections: Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, Noah's Ark, and the story of Abraham. There are also a pair of shorter sections, one recounting the building of the Tower of Babel, and the other the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. The sections vary greatly in tone. The story of Abraham is somber and reverential, while that of Noah repeatedly focuses on his love of all animals. The destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah and the Tower of Babel could be called precursors to special effects spectaculars, although there are no real effects in the Tower of Babel sequence, and the special effects in the Sodom and Gomorrah sequence do not appear until the cities are actually destroyed.

The major triumph of this film is that despite the insanity of the attempt and the grandiosity of the project, the technology doesn't dominate the material. Also,the greatest stories of the Old Testament are brought to the screen with astounding scope and power that will provide the viewer with genuine awe.",1428451200,,1349,5.099547511312217

Hate to beak it to everyone but civilization was around awhile before this. The sumerians and egyptians were black dravidic hindus
and came from a reasonably high culture themselves which is why egypt and sumer just seemed to pop up from nothing. Around 5400bc the icecaps melted and started flooding coastal cities around the world, this caused migrations of people. History is keeping a secret and this story here helps keep it. You bible story OT anyway is mainly the story of aryan sun worshippers but wrapped in the lineages and stories of other people to hide this fact.  Read Pheonician origins of scots and brittains by l.a. waddell. Who was ab'ram(indian name)abraham because he didn't speak hebrew. Its funny how so much of jewish culture is pheonician but history is totally silent on them, even youtube is silent on them, hmmm.

However, as anyone who has read scripture knows, you simply cannot do justice to the vast story of the Bible by squeezing almost 4000 years of history into a 3-hour movie!  In a adult study of the book of Genesis our group used the beginning minutes to drive home the enormity of creation and the starkness of the ""blank slate"" with which God worked.  Not a movie to be glanced at and mothballed, I think people of any age will enjoy the way this movie has been done and the impact it brings to the screen.

The movie does have a lot of dialogue and slow scenes but that is kind of expected for a movie that was made in 1948 (guessing, but not 100% sure). However, the director and writers forgot to study all the chapters about Abraham.  There are major inconsistencies, the information is there but scrambled around.  For example, Ishmael is shown to be circumcised as an infant when in the bible he was circumcised at age 13. I did like how Sodom and Gomorrah was portrayed.  The wickedness was displayed very well and actually made me cringe lol.

857008,2,6304386168,"This would have been a one star review because of all the misleading added dialogue and actions that are not found in the Bible.

  I thought the first part (before the intermission) stuck pretty close to the Bible with few liberties, such as Noah acting like the pied piper with a flute. The second half was pretty bad. One of the parts that I appreciated was the part when the angels blinded the Sodomites and Lot and his daughters were rescued. This seemed pretty accurate. The last bit about Abraham was the worst! Even worse than the new ""The Bible"" series' depiction of the story of Abraham and Isaac.

  The scriptures clearly says in in Hebrew 11:17-19  ""17 By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac. He had received the promises, yet he was ready to offer up his only son. 18 God had told him, Through Isaac descendants will carry on your name, 19 and he reasoned that God could even raise him from the dead, and in a sense he received him back from there.""
  SO Abraham knew 2 things. One, Isaac was going the one would carry on his name and two, God was able to make a dead person come back to life.
  Verse 19 says he ""reasoned"" and so when God asked him to sacrifice his son. We can speculate that he might have initially been surprised, even shocked but then... he reasoned.
  He knew that no matter what happened on that mountain, Isaac would be coming back down. That's why he even tells the servant at Genesis 22:5 ""5 So he said to his servants, You two stay here with the donkey while the boy and I go up there. We will worship and then return to you. He knew that somehow they were both coming back, because he believed in what God said when God promised him through Isaac himself in Genesis 17 :19 ""To this God said: Your wife Sarah will definitely bear you a son, and you must name him Isaac.* And I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant to his offspring* after him.

  SO why is that in every movie that talks about Abraham going to sacrifice his son, I see an angry, rude, man who is blindly putting faith in God?

857343,5,6304386168,"The Book of Genesis - the very first written volume of the Old Testament within the Holy Bible, comes alive on this big screen adaptation. As Master Producer - Dino De Laurentis, brings Hollywood's classic stars: Actors George C. Scott, Ava Gardner, Peter O'Toole, Richard Harris and John Huston... who, directed the film and portrayed Noah, within this magnificent epic..., to the forefront. The objective? To depict the early beginnings of the Genesis account to the movie audience, worldwide. From the six day Creation, to Adam and Eve and their sons - Cain and Abel, too the arrogant and rebellious Nimrod and his prideful blunder in building the Tower of Babel to supposedly reach God, so he can become, God. Followed by the lovable and obedient Noah and his gigantic, floating zoo. And on too, the colorful rainbow in the sky, the Divine insignia marking the Noahatic - Covenant of Peace between God and Man after the destructive Great Flood, subsided. Followed by the descendants of Noah and the repopulation of the entire, Earth. Then the dramatic illustration and pioneering call on the life of Abraham. And the merciless, unwarranted, barrenness which was Divinely and cruelly imposed upon his wife, Sarah. That is, until the appropriated time of conception and subsequent birth of the Covenant Son, Isaac. A revealing look at the 'Cutting of the Abrahamic Covenant' and all that it entailed. In addition too, a glimpse of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah along with the battles with various invading kings. And the climatic ending, illustrating the brutal and supremely sacrificial test that the Lord demanded of Abraham on Mount Moriah, later called: Place of the Skull and the Hill of Golgotha. The test was cruelly imposed upon Abraham to see if he loved the Lord or his covenant son - Isaac, more so? Abraham passed the test and the Lord... much later, substituted His own Son - Jesus the Risen Christ, instead of Isaac. This is a riveting, detailed, masterpiece from start to finish. And a epic, DVD collectors item from Hollywood's Golden Age of Cinema, that's entertaining and spiritually educational. A definite keeper. Nina Kish",1409961600,6,2153,5.016759776536313

detail we do have some of what happened by reading the bible. I Love It :)",1408579200,,130,4.24
857398,3,6304386168,"It's a money making venture, its following of the Book is not there, writers, director and producers didn't read The Book and neither most of the costumers who gave most of the reviews. Intrinsical, important parts of God's message are left out of the movie thus it nullifies the real value of the movie. I could write pages on the parts of the Book that were left out either by ignorance or convenience, but I'll only mention a couple.
The first thing that called the attention of the Lord about Sodom and Gomorra was that all women were over weight because the men had slaved themselves to paraphilias and neglected women entirely, or very often .

When Lot is sitting at the city's gates in the evening and sees the two angels approaching he recognizes them immediately and practically forces them to stay at his house instead of the city square as the angels had planned; Lot knew the town's people and what they were capable of doing.

After they ate and were getting ready for bed, ""every man from every part of the city of Sodom-both young and old-surrounded the house. They called to Lot. 'Where are the two men who came to you tonight? Bring them out so to us so that we can have sex with them.'"" GENESIS 19:4-5.
Lot tries to dissuade them to no avail, even offers them his two virgin daughters as an exchange for the angels, but like anal-sex addicts they refuse Lot's offer and begin to brake the door, at this, one of the angels reaches out, grabs Lot and pulls him inside the house, the locals dominated by their addiction are loosing self-control, so the angels create an intense, blinding light that blocks them from finding the door.
In the morning Lot sends the two fiancs of his daughters away and informs them about the destruction about to occur, they think he's yoking and leave; the angels urge Lot, his wife and two daughters to leave, and not to look back, for the mountains.
""But I can't flee to the mountains, the disaster will over take me, and I'll die. Look, there is a town near enough to run to, and it's very small. Let me flee to it-it is very small, isn't it? The my life will be spared."" GENESIS 19:18-22.
The name of the town is Zoar which means small. ""But Lot's wife looked back and she became a pillar of salt."" GEN 19:26.

""Lot and his two daughters left Zoar and settled in the mountains, for he was afraid to stay in Zoar. He and his two daughters lived in a cave. One day the older daughter said to the younger, ""Our father is old and there is no man around here to lie with us, as it is custom all over the earth, Let's get our father to drink wine and then lie with him."" GEN 19: 30-32.
So they do as planned, and unbeknownst  to Lot, while drunk, both his daughter lie with him. They both become pregnant and the older names her son Moab, and the younger names her son Ben-Ammi; both children become powerful leaders and create the nation of Moab and the nation of the Ammonites of today. GEN 19: 30-38.
These nations, in time, become fierce enemies of the Jews that the Lord brings out of Egypt with Moses.

If you want to know about the Scriptures don't watch the 10 Commandments, Ursus or The Robe, read the Bible. It's a book full of magic, mysteries and predictions; it predicted the campaigns of Alexander The Great 300 years before they happened. Heed my advice, you will not regret it, I guarantee it.",1408492800,,3355,4.40483870967742

Perhaps someone with more technical expertise would not have my problems - or someone with more energy - I am 77. I recommend the movie as a reasonable and entertaining interpretation of scripture.

The paired animals co-mingling was quite a feat considering there was no special effects such as blue screen, digital imaging available at the time of production. However, the actors appear a bit wooden and over-act occasionally (I'm certain none of the major actors brag about their performances in this film), the dialogue was flat and choppy--but then, it appears the director and writers scripted directly from the book.  The pace was slow at times--at least 30 minutes could have been edited out. The story itself has everything: slavery, infidelity, child-abuse, animal cruelty, sexism, homophobia, mental illness (certain characters hear voices, see visions), rape, murder, and incest (uh, Eve was the only female and mother of Caine. When Caine was banished to the East of Eden he 'knew' his wife---who was she?  Where did she come from? Hmm.). Over all the film was entertaining, but I don't recommend viewing it a second time unless the viewer considers the subject matter non-fiction--which in that case, the narration creates a documentary feel but doesn't add much to the creativity of the film.",1405209600,,1230,5.109452736318408

John Houston certainly saved the best role in the film for himself.  His Noah was tough and loyal to God, but also a man with a good sense of humor.  There are a few moments where he is looking directly at the camera with a smile, but it just added to the charm of the story.

Peter O'Toole should be singled out for his portrayal as the Angel of the Lord.  Regal and yet very humble in the service to his God.

For this reason the humorous aspects of some parts, such as the (overly long?) Noah sequence, are in keeping with a mythic presentation. The Adam and Eve section is as good as can be expected of a story that can't really be visually portrayed; Cain's murder of Abel is actually quite harrowing and not a little moving, despite the histrionics of Richard Harris; the Noah's ark section is simply delightful; the tower of Babel is perhaps the best of all, it is in the best sense exactly what we want to see.

The '60's ""all-star cast"" trend can be distracting here at times, as it detracts from the universal quality of the stories. I was also a little bemused by the ""modern"" score, which seemed to want to create--in the opening scenes in particular--a sense of alienation rather than awe.

Unfortunately, there seems to be some damage to the film in the Adam & Eve sequence. I don't know if that is a problem with the DVD or the original copy, though I suspect the latter.",1388016000,2,1145,4.548543689320389

A solid remastering and a 3-hour making of documentary would be terrific for a future release. This Blu-ray has managed to hold its value.

858643,4,6304386168,I think this movie was great and I would have given a five had they not messed with a few of the text. One of a few other errors was the rain before the flood. As far as I can remember in the beginning rain did not exist until the great flood but in this movie it is seen while eve is giving birth to one of her children. I would recommend this movie to anyone who knows about the Bible and can enjoy their excellent acting while knowing which are facts and which are not.

858880,5,6304386168,"John Huston told the story of the Bible, the old testament, very accurately, beautifully and with excellent cinematography.  It was very entertaining, even humorous at times, without the director taking too much artistic liberty with the script.  To me that showed respect for the Word of God.  John Huston also played the part of Noah.  He was Awesome!  Sometimes I guess he you can't fully explain to someone else how you want a character to be portrayed.  You have to just do it yourself.  And his portrayal was just as the Bible described nothing added and nothing taken away.  I was also impressed by his courage to tell the true story of Sodam and Gomorah, just as the Bible described, with out being too ""politically correct"", it is what it is.  And he did it in such good taste.  He didn't have to be too graphic.  The characters' lines were quoted straight from the Bible.  Now, who can argue that?  I recommend this movie to everyone.  It's so sad and disappointing that the 2013 History Channel's version was so soft served and inaccurate.  You can't call it history if you add your own two cents so not to ""offend"" some. Tell it the way God said it.  The Truth will make you free!  Everyone should own a copy of The Bible, directed by John Huston.  It's Beautiful!  : )",1365984000,11,1281,4.5152838427947595

This film opened up the Scriptures of Genesis 1-22 better for me. I have read those chapters in the Bible but it was good to be able to put pictures to the words, like Noah's Ark was bigger than I thought it would be, and the example they showed in the film had separate places to keep the different types of animals that were taken on the ship.

Also, the God-fearers in the film appeared spiritual instead of religious to me, which I was glad to see.

I think my favorite is Noah's Ark. All of the other Biblical stories are done fairly well but I'm sure we all will find some deviation from our own interpretations.

At times charming, at others frightening, occasionally awe-inspiring, how anyone can fail to be struck by this most primal act of film-making is beyond me. All I can figure is those who genuinely don't like Bible: In The Beginning must have calloused souls. Call these fairy tales, call them history or metaphor or literal truth, whatever your choice of terminology, the Book of Genesis is the art of the story at its most ancient, and whoever doesn't appreciate that or the labor of love within this project doesn't deserve to be taken seriously as an evaluator of the motion picture craft. These earthy and sometimes shockingly lurid tales of humankind's formative years, when the God of the desert had a temper, are a true cinematic masterpiece! There is a raw tone here that is simply absent from 21st century movies and it makes for compelling viewing. No CGI whatsoever, just physically built glorious sets, ultra-effective makeup, and strong performances by an outstanding cast who respect what in other hands could have been campy material.

It's a mixed bag of good, interesting and sincere. I think George C. Scott as Abraham is probably the best thing about the film. I also found the music by composer Toshiro Mifume to be very bland and mundane. Definetly not as uplifting a musical score by likes of Miklos Rozsa or Alfred Newman.

  * John Huston's The Bible ... In the Beginning was one of two films photographed in D-150 (the other was Patton), designed to be projected on a deeply curved screen 92 feet wide from a 70mm print. In any home theater I've ever seen it would be impossible to get the hypnotic immersion and suspension of disbelief available in either a D-150 equipped theater or in one of the other 70 mm theaters ... and suspension of disbelief is especially helpful with a film like The Bible.
  * The older DVD of The Bible was very substandard, but in 70mm the film had a marvelously clear ""walk into it"" quality.  If the Blu-ray is good, sitting much closer to your screen than usual may help get some of the involvement back.  This would be true with most Blu-rays made from 70 mm prints (or 65 mm original color negatives).
  * At the San Francisco Film Festival John Huston said he regarded the film as ""a poem of a myth, like the Illiad.""  Most reviewers didn't get that.  Religious liberals tended to object to, and were mystified by, the literalist treatment of the subject matter, and some fundamentalists didn't like the (few) liberties taken.
  * Certain sequences (e.g., The Creation) do constitute a visual poem, and a good one at that.  Huston's portrayal of Noah was utterly charming, as was that whole sequence.
  * The Noah's Ark sequence was shown during Huston's appearance at the film festival.  Immediately afterward, someone in the audience asked him ""How could the critics so dislike this film?""  Huston answered, ""They really missed the boat on this one.""  That got a laugh.

Now on the blu-ray disc it finally has a crisp, colorful picture and sound treatment that such a monumental picture deserves. It,s like watching it for the first time! John Huston (director, star, narrator)would be proud. As I have already stated this movie was a monumental undertaking as evidenced in the Tower of Babel scenes and the flood and Noah's Ark. The only thing that I might want to criticize is its tendency to rather plod along at times especially in the scenes between Sarah (Ava Gardner) and Abraham (George C. Scott), but then it transforms into a haunting reminder of the results of man's depravity and God's judgment in the scene where Abraham and Isaac are walking through the udder destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. George C. Scott gives a wonderful performance of the tortured but nevertheless obedient Abraham in a test of faith.
  This movie has been lovingly restored. The details are incredible. The sound is thunderous. The musical score by Toshiro Mayuzumi is a masterpiece in its own right.

859698,4,6304386168,"John Huston does a peplum, and the fact that it's based on Biblical myth, and has Italian production values, really carries it off. It's generally unjustly maligned, but it's a splendid epic, somewhat unfocused, but beautifully designed and shot. Its best characteristic is that it avoids spiritualistic pandering, and has a curiously faithless core. The set pieces by Mario Chiari (Babel and The Ark in particular) astound even by today's CGI standards; and the creation sequence is a tour-de-force of natural vistas, strong narrative power, and features a magnificent musical treatment by the film's Japanese composer, Toshiro Mayuzumi. The film loses power as it progresses (aside from George C. Scott's thrusting histrionics), but it's still filled with effective moments from start to finish.
The Fox Blu-Ray is impressive and true to the film's premiere roadshow quality, particularly if you have a large projection system with 6-track sound:  originally filmed in the wide-gauge 70mm process known as Dimension-150 (along with PATTON), there is restored DTS-HD audio (purists can even indulge in the original 4-track, magnetic stereo delivery).",1300838400,13,1151,5.5397727272727275
859699,5,6304386168,"Only those for whom the Bible, God (Elohim), Jesus (Yeshua) are myth and fantasy is ""The Bible: In the Beginning,"" ""silly,"" not ""lively,"" or boring.  What IS amazing is the care and detail which Huston put into this epic film which was in fact meant to be the first in a series, ultimately intended to cover the entire Bible, OT and NT.  What is indeed silly is the superior, disdainful perspective of those who deny the legitimacy of, and the Truth which constitutes, the Bible.  Huston is to be applauded for his dedication to sticking close to the literality of the Holy Scriptures, particularly so since he himself did not accept The Bible as God's word, or Jesus as the second person of The Trinity!  I wonder if reviewers who mock The Bible and Huston's grand rendering of history as recorded in the Pentateuch would hold the same view of a similar film account of the Koran's rendering of history and Mohammed's interpretation of God (Yahweh), to wit, Allah; or a similar rendering of Buddha and his teachings of how the earth and mankind came about.  I seriously doubt it.

""The Bible: In The Beginning"" is not only true to the Pentateuch, but infused with astounding reverence from an essentially agnostic director.  The acting is good, free of unnecessary, detracting--and distracting--""poetic license"" with which almost all works attempting to expand on historical accounts, legends, or myths are fraught; witness the many attempts to depict The Iliad and The Odyssey, adding and changing details to suit the screen writer and, or the director.  ""The Bible: In The Beginning"" displays little of that, and yet, for those whose scope has not been attenuated by the ADD-fostering techie gadgets which determine the thought patterns of so many in today's ""post-modern,"" whatever that means (what can possibly follow ""the post-modern era?""  The late post-modern era?  The nouveau post-modern era?).

Forget about all of the MODERN, anti-God, secular humanistic, progressive views, regardless of your own views on ""the meaning of life,"" and enjoy one of the few true-to-the-original epics ever produced, and enjoy the powerfully understated acting of some of the greatest actors and actresses of the mid-20th century: George C.

859704,5,6304386168,"This film was released in September of 1966, which placed it at the close of a long tradition of Hollywood Biblical epics. I was around ten years old and had a vinyl LP of its great musical score which I played over and over before I finally saw the movie on the big screen of a theater. Our family was not particularly religious, but this film was one of those that had a profound influence on me and made me interested in knowing more about the Bible.

Looking at it today, I see more depth. The opening footage from all over the world of the days of the Creation is still breathtaking. As a child I felt uncomfortable with the partially nude scenes of Adam and Eve, and even now I believe nudity needs to be implied. Otherwise my mind stops focusing on the story and thinks ""I just saw a naked actor!"". Also, a theory of some Bible commentators is that animals are clothed with feathers or fur, and Adam and Eve were clothed with a glow of light emanating from within them; when they sinned that glow disappeared and they were then totally naked before they hit on the idea of fig leaves. (This interpretation would not likely have been known to John Huston). Beyond that, the film rolls on quite nicely through the first twenty-two chapters of Genesis. The cinematography is rich and beautiful. I do think a few too many scenes were interpreted as desert settings, since many of the Bible lands were lush and only outskirted by desert as a result of the climatology of the region being somewhat different more than 4,000 years ago (though of course that's controversial). Either way the storyline still follows the episodes of salvation history. One reviewer said it looks like they just kept shooting until they ran out of film and decided to call it quits. To me it was essential they kept going until they climaxed the film with the sacrifice of Isaac, which pointed forward to the day when God would inaugurate a new creation. Thus there is a great arc of theme in the epic from ""In the Beginning"" to ""The New Beginning"".

Overall the movie looks like a live-action version of Sunday School art. By that I mean most of the scenes are like pictures I've seen in religious artworks. For example, Adam and Eve are portrayed by clean-shaven white people. Cain bashes Abel over the head instead of slitting his throat (like the sacrifices he'd watched - see I John 3:12 in the original Jerusalem Bible [1966], not the New Jerusalem Bible [1985]). This Tower of Babel somewhat rightly resembles a Sumerian ziggurat, yet more resembles Renaissance paintings of it. Modern researchers have discovered that Noah could have been a king, and the ark was actually a huge flat barge shaped like a giant shoebox to ride the tidal waves of the Flood. The movie pictures things like I've seen them all my life: a peasant Noah, and a rounded boat with a house on top (and that shape would capsize in no time). The only thing they didn't have was a giraffe sticking out of the window.

Nevertheless, you may enjoy these traditional depictions. I'm just preferring literal Biblical research combined with the look of what has been discovered in archaeology, yet for me the overall effect of this film is still profound and quite moving. It's been said that George C. Scott's portrayal of Abraham was the low point of the movie, but I thought his crusty performance was inspiring! (I was also thankful they didn't picture Abraham like Santa Claus). For the most part, watching this film was an enjoyable and uplifting experience. Any Biblical movie should give us a taste of what things were like; then we should always go back and read the Book. There we will find the authentic atmosphere of the actual words. Still, one line the scriptwriters put in the mouth of Abraham is not found in the Bible, yet it does reflect what the Bible says of him. It has helped me with my faith. It is the line where Abraham asks, ""Shall the Lord speak, and Abraham not believe?""",1289692800,4,3952,4.594900849858357

859811,3,6304386168,"I saw this in the theater when I was 10 years old, and I was both captivated and bored at the same time. John Huston once said he always wanted to do a biblical epic, but unfortunately he was a little late. By 1966 these type of epics had become passe as indicated a year earlier by the box office and critical failure of George Stevens' mammoth all-star production of the story of Christ ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"" (PLEASE! John Wayne as a Roman centurian?). Biblical epics hit their stride in the 50s with the first Cinemascope presentation of ""The Robe"" through ""The Ten Commandments"" and then hit their peak with ""Ben Hur"" in 1959. By the early 60s, it had become more fashionable to do epics that were straight out of the history books rather than the Bible with the likes of ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and ""Doctor Zhivago"".

So what does old John do? He goes way back to well...The Beginning. Starts off with the story of Adam and Steve, oops...Adam and Eve (my apologies to gay community) starring a very young pre-""Then Came Bronson"" Michael Parks in the buff. This segment is rather frustrating because to get the censors off his back for the nakedness presented here, John opt for soft-focus lenses and very little exposure resulting in a rather dark fuzzy picture. We, of course, move on to Richard Harris playing Caine beating his brother Abel to a pulp, the world's first murder, and then cast out of the Garden of Eden. Then we come to the most entertaining part of the film, Noah and the Ark. With Huston himself playing Noah, this segment has the only comedy you'll find here while still maintaining the dignity of the story. Whenever I watch this part, I just can't help but be reminded of Bill Cosby's classic Noah routine:

God: NOAH!
Noah: What! What do you want?
God: YOU GOT TWO MALE HIPPOS THERE AND YOU NEED TO TAKE ONE OUT AND BRING IN A FEMALE!
Noah: I'm not doing nothin' you change one of them!
God: COME ON, YOU KNOW I DON'T WORK LIKE THAT!

After the intermission, we go into the Tower of Babel with an unrecognizable Stephen Boyd playing Nimrod. Then the film really starts to bog down with the story of Abraham that is just too slow and long despite George C. Scott's passionate performance. The only highlight is when we get to Sodom and Gomorrah. Here, Huston does a really neat little special effect with Peter O'Toole playing the three angels. You see the angels all sitting in the same frame with their hooded robes shadowing their faces, when each one speaks, you see O'Toole's face appear! Pretty nifty! After that, the film just continues to drag on to the final attempted sacrifice of Abraham's son Isaac at the conclusion.

Is the film a total failure? I wouldn't say so. Technically, it's beautifully done with great cinematography and a majestic music score by Toshir Mayuzumi that would've even made Mikls Rzsa (Ben Hur) envious. Huston initially wanted this to be part one of a series on the Old Testament, but the box office performance pretty much nixed that. So, basically I would recommend this film to Bible completist and maybe parents who would want to present the Old Testament to their kids in a more entertaining fashion. The Bible is a very metaphorically cryptic book to be able to translate well to the big screen. Only ""The Ten Commandments"" was able pull it off successfully in terms of going more verbatim while the ""The Robe"" and ""Ben Hur"" used the Bible as more of a backdrop of a human story.  Again, nice try John for tackling a difficult source, but too long and a little too late.",1262908800,2,3546,4.586750788643533

It does show Creation, Adam and Eve and the Flood. The Noah's Ark portion was my favourite,  mostly because I like animals, but also because it shows the point of the story very well. I thought this was the best part of the film altogether.

The sets and cinemascope are wonderful, the music is epic (and beautiful and well in keeping with the grandeur of the topic), but that is about all. The script and dialogue are laughable, not to mention silly to the extreme. It was definitely a product of its times, and well, we can and should do a much better version of the same thing now. Since it is covering certain chapters of Genesis, one cannot expect any smooth flowing of plot, as we are actually dealing with many small stories. But, as a point in favor of the movie, that fact really doesn't upset the viewer at all. We just take it for what it offers us. It was a bold move, to try and make a movie about the Bible (and admittedly, we are not really seeing a movie about the Bible, had that happened, I think we would still be watching the first showing today, it would take that long to tell the tale), and I have to admit that the project did come off rather well in places, and proved it could be done. I only wish the director actually believed in what he was producing. He didn't believe the Bible to be truth, nor did he believe in God, so he really didn't have anything to ""bring"" to the table when creating this movie, and it shows. He is basically presenting an emotionless, empty, liveless, portrayal of things he really thinks were less important than standard fiction of the day. The fact he could actually step outside himself long enough to do what he did, and accomplish what he was able to accomplish (which was really quite a lot) is a miracle. But I am left wondering, ""How much MORE could we have had, if he actually was creating a project he actually believed in?"" I haven't bothered to watch the movie again since I watched it after I opened up the wrapping. Kids and other visitors have tried to watch it, but usually turn it off because they are so bored it isn't funny. They don't get a thing out of it. It was a great attempt at doing something really good, of actually having a ""Bible Epic"" that deals with the Bible and not some fictitious character ""living at the same time as great Bible events."" There are people today who really enjoy this movie, and it ""speaks to them"" in special ways. It proved there are audiences out there who wouldn't mind having a Bible movie that actually is based on the BIBLE. Now we just need someone who believes in the Bible and believes it actually has lessons for our times worth hearing who will create such a movie for us. Someone who will make these people spoken of in the Bible into real Flesh and Blood people, like they were when they lived on this earth adn recorded their life stories for the future generations to read. I rated it only 2 stars because of the stupidity of the writing, I give it 5 stars for effort, and 2 stars for results. It does have something to offer, though, and that I am not overlooking as I share what I found wrong with the movie. And I know that those who really find it fabulous, it is what those things are bringing to you that makes this movie touch you as it does. It is just the movie didn't bring those things to me in the way I really would have wished to have experienced them.",1219708800,8,4047,4.312335958005249

As for the light-heartedness of the people in the ark, from a dramatist point of view, smart move.  The flood was a horrendous ordeal so some lightheartedness about it helps keep the faith of the folks inside.

I was impressed by the movie.  If John Huston was an atheist, I wouldn't have known.  It was a job well done with the right pacing and performances.  George C. Scott was brilliant as Abraham.  Some of the moves seemed a little ""theatrically stylized"", but those are theater actors on film.  Nothing new.  Richard Harris (the original Dumbledore) did a great performance as Cain.

Standout scenes are the death of Abel by Cain, Adam and Eve being driven from the Garden of Eden, Abraham's visit from the Angel of God and the gathering of men at Sodom, blinded by the two Angels. The Sodom scene, with all its wickedness, would be considered ""politically incorrect"" by Hollywood today, but is a directorial masterpiece. The Noah's Ark gathering of the animals is a commendable assemblage of creatures, but John Houston's portrayal of Noah is much too comical for such a strong Biblical patriarch. Adam and Eve seemed too mechanical, in a very pale Eden, in what should have been a beautifully breathtaking opportunity for the cinematographer of Paradise. And according to scripture, Isaac was probably a bit older than the small actor we see in the film. But George C. Scott believably delivers as Abraham; especially when about to give his son as a sacrifice. Not the best adaptation of Bible stories, but at least the Hollywood of old, was well aware of a large audience for sacred things it seemingly ignores today.",1179360000,7,1120,4.838541666666667

860143,5,6304386168,"John Huston's The Bible...In The Beginning is wonderful movie that captures on film the emotion and drama of the first books of the Bible.  From the beautiful images of Adam and Eve in Eden - including the strange shape/figure of the temptor in the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil - up to Abraham's life everything here rings true.  Yes, he doesn't follow the Bible to the letter, but that is a minor criticism since it was the director's intention to tell the story in a realistic and believable manner.  One person here said it was ""silly"" that the temptor of Adam and Eve wasn't in the form of a serpent/snake.  Well, I say that it would have been even ""sillier"" to see a snake moving its jaws and having human speech coming out of its mouth than the presentation in the movie.  John Huston's role as Noah is fantastic, being one of the highlights of the film but pay attention to the people playing his sons and daughter in laws and appreciate how well they were.

Though some here say that George C. Scott over acted in his portait of Abraham, I say that you don't have an appreciation of true drama.  In fact, those who call the movie slow fail to capture the same thing.  This is a dramatic movie, with little in the way of being ""exciting.""  The Ten Commandments is a good movie, but come on!  You can't hardly compare the two.  Huston went to great lengths to actually present this as if we were viewing the past and to my mind, he succeeded greatly.  Yes, John Huston was an atheist but he shows an understanding and deep-seated appreciation for the people and the material that is hard to find in many people who claim to be all about the Bible.  It makes me wonder what kind of movie these people would have made had they had the same resources.  John Huston was one of the greats and I simply love this movie.  If corny, largely ficticious movies are your cup of tea, then stick with the Ten Commandments but if you want intellegent, fine drama you would do very well to give this movie a watch.",1092700800,16,2015,4.3646112600536195
860144,4,6304386168,"The Bible ... in the Beginning is a most interesting motion picture.  Over the course of almost three hours, the people and events of the first twenty-two chapters of the Book of Genesis are brought to life by a star-studded cast of characters under the direction of John Huston (with Dino Delaurentiis as the producer).  It is a strange film; at times it is very moving and communicative of the Biblical message, but at other times it becomes strangely surrealistic or downright comical.  It is, with a few exceptions, a pretty faithful reenactment of the Biblical text, however, and that certainly does count for something.  The film can basically be broken down into several sections: the Creation, original sin, and the first murder; Noah's flood; the tower of Babel; and the life of Abraham.

The creation of the world is given a slow and sonorous treatment that tends to drag just a little bit.  Then we have the creation of Adam and Eve (although there's no mention of the whole rib business).  I found it somewhat strange to see Eve drawn to the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil almost immediately - the serpent's job was made quite easy, and I must say I rather liked the manner in which the serpent was represented here.  The ejection of Adam and Eve from the Garden is pretty powerful stuff, as is the later murder of Abel by his jealous brother Cain (played by a young Richard Harris).

Then comes the story of Noah and the Great Flood, which has to be my favorite part of the movie.  John Huston himself plays Noah, and it is a remarkable performance that oscillates between seriousness and downright goofiness.  The Ark is impressive and truly communicates the immense size of the thing, and one cannot but get a big kick out of seeing all the animals trot in two by two (including lions, tigers, polar bears, elephants, penguins, etc.).  I also thought the Tower of Babel was presented in an impressive fashion, and the sight of Nimrod climbing to the top in order to shoot an arrow up into the heavens was a nice touch that more than earned God's anger and resulted in the dispersal of different languages among the people.

I have mixed feelings over the action surrounding Abraham.  George C. Scott is one of the greatest actors to ever live, but I'm just not sure he was a good choice to play the Hebrew patriarch.  Ava Gardner also did not thrill me with her performance as Sarah, who came off as a cold and rather unbecoming figure.  Her first scene is apparently supposed to show the love she and Abraham share with one another, but the whole episode makes Sarah seem wanton and made me feel pretty darn icky long before it was over.  Of course, Sarah's wish to have her servant Hagar bear Abraham the child she could not give him has always hurt my opinion of the couple, a feeling only exacerbated by Abraham's abandonment of Hagar and Ishmael after God delivers on His promise that the elderly, barren Sarah would bear a son to be named Isaac.  The destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah is of course interesting, and Huston certainly made the point about Sodom being a den of pure evil as the angels of the Lord enter to save Lot and his family (including his wife who would pay for disobeying God's order not to look back as the family is fleeing).

The film ends with Abraham's almost-sacrifice of his beloved son Isaac.  Abraham totally wigs out a couple of times, especially as he and Isaac make their way through the ruins of Sodom, but the reaction is understandable.  This was the hardest test God could have given to Abraham, and the man's faith cannot be questioned by God or man as the film's credits begin to roll.

This film really isn't that well-known these days, and I think it does have some weaknesses.  Ironically, the humor that works its way into the story of Noah makes an otherwise long, dry film much more bearable, however.  No other film I know of sets out to do what this film does, however, and that makes it more than worth one's time.  I don't think it will necessarily help to convert unbelievers, but those of Christian or Jewish faith may well benefit from this recreation of the earliest stories recorded in the Bible and Torah.",1091318400,7,4188,4.57429718875502
860145,4,6304386168,"I liked the movie in all parts except for two.  I'll start with the positive things.
Another reviewer mentioned it was a little slow in the beginning, and that is true, but if you can be patient, you can get into it.
The Ark scenes were great -- a little humor never hurt anyone.
Sodom and Gomorrah was icky.  Probably they did a good job of recreating what it was like, but really, I don't want to see all of that.  If a couple quick shots were removed, this scene would be good.
Abraham goes on this weird monologue sort of thing, that I didn't really get.  I am engineer, so perhaps I just don't appreciate the drama of it.",1087430400,2,626,4.191666666666666

Much of the second half of the film is rather boring, with a great deal of monotonous conversation between the characters.  The first half of the movie is much better, with Huston's humorous characterization of Noah a highlight.
Most upsetting of all is the DVD presentation.  The box indicates the film is presented in a 2.55:1 ratio, which is a super widescreen image.  Instead, the film is shown in what looks like 2.20:1.  Interestingly, the widescreen VHS tape presents the film in 2.35:1.  Therefore, for some reason, we are being robbed of part of the film image.  Why?  The film gets 3 stars, but I take one away because of the botched presentation.",1071360000,6,827,4.694444444444445

I have never seen a biblical film that spent so much time on the 'beginning' as this one did.  The Noah story was REALLY great to see, being an animal lover and seeing Noah's love for the animals was really nice to see.  The Soddom and Gamorrah scene was just as I had always pictured.  Strange thing is, I think I may have seen this movie when I was a child...some imgages were very familiar to me.
The shame on FOX thing was due to the actual DVD being POORLY made as far as sound and picture.  The sound is beyond horrible in the first Adam/Eve story and mostly through out.  I had to blast my speakers just to hear loud music but faint dialogue.  The picture was very dark as well...FOX cheaply converting this to DVD is the reason im told.  I had to keep the subtitles on just to understand and catch all the words.
I would still say if you are interested in this picture, DO NOT pass it up just due to the sound issue, I am still very glad I have this DVD and would not consider selling it.

860210,5,6304386168,"1966: Huston's film covers the first twenty chapters of Genesis- from the Creation, the Flood to Isaac's near sacrifice. With lush cinematography, fine acting and superb music. Richard Harris, Ava Gardner, George C. Scott and Peter O'Toole are among the cast. In the 60's, and in fact years before in the 50's, the bible dramas were quite popular and appealed to many audiences who had undergone war and conflict from home- it was the turbulent 60's after  all. The Ten Commandments and Ben Hur were transcendent films only a couple of years before.
Making a film about the first book in the Bible, the most mysterious and most alluring, Genesis, must not have been an easy task for director John Huston, nor was it easy enough for actors portraying biblical characters. But this film is exquisite, well-done with fine performances by the actors, most notably Richard Harris as Noah and George C. Scott as Abraham. The actor and actress playing Adam and Eve are just as most of us imagine them to be - gorgeous in the nude, walking around a beautiful, semi-tropical garden and being seduced by the apple in a tree which a treacherous snake deceived them into eating.
The film goes on to describe the biblical scenario established before the Flood, of humankind's lechery and vice in Sodom and Gomorrah, and God's wrath resulting in destruction. Very powerful imagery and very fine interpretation. It is not just a Christian or Catholic film, it is a film worth watching just for the moving drama. After all, life is but a drama, a film of which we all take part of. The music to this film is also very inspiring, although subtle and haunting. ""The Bible.. In The Beginning"" (as this film is often called) makes a great assignment to watch in a college or high school in which students read the Bible as a form of literature and work of human history, mainly that of the ancient Hebrews.",1049241600,54,1886,4.715151515151515

Outstanding are the first 15 minutes, with director Huston narrating a mix of verses from Genesis Chapters 1 and 2 (KJV), and I have a special fondness for the sprawling ""Tree of Knowledge"", with its strange looking white leaves.
Other favorite sections:
The great Richard Harris, fabulous in a highly choreographed telling of the Cain and Abel story.
The animals going into Noah's Ark, with its wonderful music, is a delight for kids of all ages.
The Tower of Babel, as an awesome ziggurat, with Stephen Boyd looking simply stunning in exotic makeup.
Peter O'Toole as the Angel, always a fascinating actor, and even in a small part, a scene stealer.
Yes, it's abysmally slow in parts, especially in the final Abraham section, which could have used some serious editing. A half an hour could easily have been cut from this portion, and also, this is where most of the stilted dialogue can be found...but nevertheless, even though it dwindles as the film progresses, this telling of the first 22 chapters of Genesis is one I've seen numerous times, and am sure to view again.

860213,5,6304386168,"Although some parts of this film are slow, it is still a great movie.  I think some of the unemotional acting (not all, just a few scenes) is due to the times--This film was made in 1966--a time when (in my opinion) acting was melodramatic in general.  I believe Huston was attempting to give this film a more solemn, perhaps respectful, tone, thus the acting was ""subdued"".  Film and acting has definitely matured, however, I still feel this is a classic.  I've even come to enjoy the ""slower"" moments of the film to reflect on what it must have been like in ancient times.  I give it 5 stars for this reason.

860214,3,6304386168,"This was indeed a monumental project, but not perfectly handled.  Of course, John Huston was an atheist, and this needs to be taken into consideration.  He did soften parts of this to portray more typically human reactions, especially with the scenes between Abraham and his son Isaac, than the Bible portrays.
The portrayal of God seems accurate enough.  But to portray the devoutness of the human characters would take a more devout director.  The result is a lack of conviction in some scenes.
This lack of conviction therefore will disturb many drawn to the movie who will see that this isn't truly filmed as a portrayal of actual history.  It comes across more as a dramatization of myth, and the viewer's reaction therefore will depend on that viewer's perspective.
As spectacle, it avoids the DeMille type excess.  As acting, Huston himself does take the spotlight with his portrayal of Noah.
Seen without great expectations, one will find it suitably reverant and still entertaining.",1028073600,15,991,5.049079754601227
860215,3,6304386168,"Legendary director John Huston's ""The Bible...In the Beginning"" is something of a mixed bag.  Though undeniably reverent and generally (though not totally) faithful to the original Scriptures, Huston's film is ultimately epic in scope but too often cold and unmoving.  There are certainly some fine scenes, particularly in the Creation , the story of the Garden of Eden (Adam and Eve's storm-shrouded exile from Paradise is perhaps the most powerful moment in the whole film), Cain and Abel, and an especially moving interlude between Abraham and only son Isaac in the ruins of sinful Sodom.  But Huston fails to make the movie emotionally appealing on a consistent basis, so that what should have been an enthralling picture is merely adequate--which, after all, is not so bad.  The cast is very powerful, featuring Richard Harris, Ava Gardner, George C. Scott, Peter O'Toole, and Huston himself as an endearing Noah.  If only Huston had let his performers live a little on camera, this might have rivaled The Ten Commandments.  As it is, the whole is respectable but flawed, too passionless and slow-paced to match The Ten Commandment's grandeur.  Even so, ""The Bible"" does bring the opening chapters of Scripture to life, and if this movie is not thrilling, it is nonetheless enlightening.",1022630400,116,1292,5.123809523809523

The part with Abraham and his son is totally off key when you examine the Bible,s Account. God would never accept such worship in the way it was displayed were Abraham was rebelling and fighting all the way and then finally started to offer up his son Isaac. Abraham was willing to offer up his son because, for one thing, it was an act of God that he and his wife had him. His wife was well beyond child-bearing age, so he had faith that God could bring him back to life and that's why God blessed him. When Biblical Movies are made, they should be accurate.

860219,3,6304386168,"New on DVD is John Huston's all star ""THE BIBLE"" .  Not really the whole Bible, or even the first five Books of Moses, rather, this is a condensation of the first 22 chapters of the Book of Genesis. There's the Creation, the Flood, Tower of Babel, Abraham (George C. Scott) and his family problems.  Huston seemed to not have his heart in the production but certainly brings to life the character of Noah, whom he plays with a comical turn.
Some of the scenes are startling in their scope -- like the view from atop the Tower of Babel -- but many are not, even though there is a somewhat faithful adherence to the source material. What remains on screen, and lingers in the mind after final fade out, is the initial dysfunctional family split that has given rise to the historical conflict of the two great family lines that were promised to Abraham's seed.  Is our world a bomb whose fuse was lit because Abraham doubted God?
Someone recently said to me in earnest, ""Why can't everyonejust quit fighting and act like Christians.""  While the world still exists, check out ""MOHAMMAD: MESSENEGER OF GOD,"" ""THE MIRACLE MAKER"" and consider what's behind the screen.  Go back to the source...",1000857600,7,1187,4.633333333333334

7869193,5,6304386168,It did not arrive in the original case like the VHS with Abraham holding Isaac up to the Almighty like the picture shows but the DVD content is the genuine article. This is a DVD that Jews and Christians need to have in their collection! I have the original VHS version but my VHS player died. So I decided to purchase this DVD because it is still the best representation of the Genesis story that I have seen! I absolutely love the movie and the lessons it teaches. It is a blessing to anyone who loves the Almighty like I do!,1524614400,,527,4.227722772277228
