885782,4,630440283X,"The story of Kaspar Hauser has many layers of evil tricks in it. It does a great job of presenting the corruption of wealth and power in the ruling families of old Germany.  Poor Kaspar was really at the mercy of people with selfish and callous motives. In the end he meets a tragic fate.
Well worth the time to watch this one indeed!",1222646400,2,334,4.21875
885783,5,630440283X,"There are presently two films out about the unfortunate person of Kaspar Hauser, a man who was dumped in the city of Nuremburg, Germany, in 1831 after what must have been nearly 20 years living tied up in a cellar without human contact.  The first film is by Werner Herzog which hardly touches upon the mysteries of this poor man's origins, nor does it give much information about the diligent efforts to find the criminals who did this to him before he was mysteriously murdered.  Peter Sehr's film takes on the difficult riddles of Hauser's origins and upbringing and does so in a most humane and insightful way.  With this film we get a real picture of a Nature child, someone growing up without human contact or civilization, and the efforts to civilize him to the societal norms of his day.  He presents us with a heartwarming character who trajicly falls from grace as the newborn son of the King of Bavaria only to be a pawn of the powers that be in his day.  A must see film for every film goer.",1127174400,11,1003,4.459016393442623
885784,1,630440283X,"Despite its title, this film isn't really about Kaspar Hauser.  Like the underground prison into which he is thrown for years, Kaspar is a black hole into which his story is sucked.  This film is really about two connected themes, both reflecting German anxieties about its past.  Hauser's treatment and fate exposes the Enlightenment society that destroys him, just as his seemingly primitive characteristics (grunting etc.) undermine its insistence on artificiality, manners and wit.
Secondly, a film set in Nuremberg, with a hero twice wrenched from his home and incarcerated, and who has his diary burnt, is clearly 'explaining' a more recent notorious past, that of the Nazis, showing how Germany would rather couch uncomfortable history in vague mythology.  A comparison between this tricksy, paranoid, exhausting film, and Herzog's restrained, enigmatic version of the same story would be instructive.  The latter is a masterpiece.",982108800,8,938,5.486111111111111
885785,5,630440283X,"This is a brilliant film, superbly acted.  Save for the conspirational  aspects, it keeps fairly close to the documented facts in the case -- but  that is pretty much irrelevant.  One does not expect historical accuracy in  films, after all.  What one *does* get is Andre Eisermann's touching  depiction of a young man who, after years of growing up in isolation  becomes the sweet and naive centre of a whirlwind of courtly intrigue; and  Jeremy Clyde's equally intriguing performance as the enigmatic and  ultimately dastardly Lord Stanhope.  (Clyde might also be remembered by  viewers as half of ""Chad and Jeremy"", the 1960s pop duo.)  The  sub-titled translation is reasonably accurate, although it does  (inevitably) miss some of the nuances of the German.  Very highly  recommended ... although, alas, most of us will have to wait until the  price comes down.",969148800,5,866,5.064285714285714
885786,5,630440283X,"This film is intriguing and provides a stunning plot which keeps one in suspense throughtout the entire movie.  The viewer begins to see the world around them in an entirely new way, through exploration of the  circumstances surrounding a young man's lack of contact with other people  and his mysterious origin.  Also gives fascinating insight and historical  facts about one of Germany's royal families.",940377600,6,405,5.265625
885936,3,630440283X,"Strange,  and a little disturbing but overall a good watch.",1412812800,,59,4.9
885937,4,630440283X,True and interesting story. Good acting.,1409529600,,40,5.833333333333333
885938,3,630440283X,This movie cannot be made in 1905 - please have Amazon correct it.,1408752000,,66,4.153846153846154
885939,5,630440283X,"German w/English subtitles.  This was a really different kind of story than I had ever seen.  It tells the story of an unfortunate boy who happens to be born into royalty, into a family that has relatives who would prefer that he wasn't in line to the throne.  I don't want to give away anything important, but let me just say that it will at once anger you, and shock you.  It was very well acted.  I really enjoyed it, in spite of the fact that it is a sad story line.",1408492800,,470,4.065217391304348
885940,3,630440283X,"A mystery that I had not heard of from the past.  I am Learning German, so it was hard to follow.",1405382400,,97,3.619047619047619

885942,3,630440283X,"It's not arresting as cinema art, but it's a good reconstruction of an interesting historical case.  The film--it would be hard to avoid this without being entirely confusing--takes a position on the ""truth"" of the case, but there's still plenty of room for viewers to form their own opinions.",1401753600,,293,4.979591836734694
885943,4,630440283X,"The movie was not all bad.  The staging, photography, costuming and acting were good.  I found the dialogue confusing, but I sense that it was not well translated.  I thought that the degree of Kaspar's social skill had developed was less than believable.  A Human being having missed care and environmental stimulation in formative years would be hard put to develop mental development that Kaspar in the movie demonstrated.",1400371200,,425,5.115942028985507
885944,5,630440283X,I'm a devoted follower of director Werner Herzog.  The movie is well done.  I would not rate it among my favorites.,1395187200,,115,4.428571428571429
885945,2,630440283X,The move is well acted. But the story is kind of sick. It's move you would like if you are interested in history. But not for normal folks to just enjoy a pleasant time.,1392681600,,169,4.0
886007,4,630440283X,"Interesting story that is a twist of other similar stories - The Man in the Iron Mask, the Scarlet Pimpernel, etc.",1386288000,,114,4.476190476190476
886008,4,630440283X,"Unlike the tripe that is being pumped out of Hollywood, this German production shows how entertainment can be produced with meaningful undertones of profound human consequence.",1382659200,,176,5.8076923076923075
886009,5,630440283X,"Loved this movie. Just a beautifully filmed work of art. Makes a compelling case that Hauser actually was the legitimate heir to the Grand Duchy of Baden. But then we will never know the truth. The film did a good job of realistically following the truth of what is known about this case. Or at least painting a reasonable scenario. Loved the acting, the set and costume design, the filmography. Wish there were more historically based movies like this one.",1375315200,,457,4.725
886010,5,630440283X,"Interestingly depicting the greed and violence of this particular era, and makes one wonder how many conspiracies will be uncovered as continuous history is written.",1374364800,,165,5.64
886011,4,630440283X,"A look to the past, and how the German aristocracy was not unlike some groups and individuals today.

886012,3,630440283X,"Kaspar is portrayed differently here than by Herzog in his earlier film Kaspar Hauser. Herzog's Kaspar remains much a mystery even at the end.

Peter Sehr's Kaspar, not appearing until well into the film, is explored in detail.

I liked the supporting cast, although Professor Daumer looked so much like a young Karl Malden that I was always distracted when he appeared, and that horrible Major/Adjutant looked like Ron Jeremy.",1369008000,,427,5.085714285714285
886013,2,630440283X,This is an ages old sinister story of a royal plot. There are a few die hard conspiracy lunatics out there that want to perpetuate the belief that Kaspar Hauser's story actually happened. The story has been disproved in the past in several occasions and at best there is some inconclusive DNA evidence to that effect.,1369008000,,317,4.678571428571429
886014,5,630440283X,"Great to get details on a mystery that has always fascinated me.  My students loved it as well.  They were so surprised at the ending,",1365206400,,134,4.32
886015,4,630440283X,"This was a good movie but very sad. I like the time period the story was set in so enjoy the experience of seeing how people lived before their was electricity, running water and indoor plumbing.",1360540800,,195,4.444444444444445
886016,5,630440283X,"I rarely suggest a movie as a must-see movie, but this is one of them.  I tend toward the foreign films because of my time spent in what was West Germany in the state where this movie takes place.  It never ceases to amaze me how much history exists in Germany, and this film brilliantly covers a thin sliver of its turbulent past.  The acting is superb, the subtitling actually follows the script very well if you don't speak the language, and the plot line has enough twists and turns to keep you watching the movie to the very end.",1360454400,,534,4.32

7872430,3,630440283X,"This movie is certainly not a Hollywood production but it is pretty good for a 1974 German movie.  I liked it for its 19th century German setting.  It wholeheartedly adopts the populist conspiracy theory, as opposed to the historical evidence that Hauser was a fraud.
