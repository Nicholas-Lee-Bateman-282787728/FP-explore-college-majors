3076555,5,B00124SNK2,It is a excellent product. And it shows step by step bellydancing in a easy manner.,1278374400,,83,4.25
3076556,5,B00124SNK2,Love it! I finally know what that song means! so much fun and feels great afterwards after you get used to moving those parts.,1261440000,,126,4.291666666666667
3076557,5,B00124SNK2,"Dolphina is such the epitome of the rich, blonde, god-realm California-girl I had trouble watching the first few minutes of this video.  But the workout is fabulous, and I must admit, it is a joy to watch this very beautiful dancer, regardless of her background!  It's separated into different sections, so your workout/dance routine can be developed any way you like.  I highly recommend it!",1261008000,5,392,5.0
3076558,5,B00124SNK2,"Dolphina's workout is amazing. Ive tried some dancing/ bellydancing/ striptease workouts before, but this tops them all.  She is so empowering and mezmerizing to watch.  This is a great workout for the Mind, Body, and Spirit. I found myself sweating within 10 minutes.
She will teach you how to shake your hips and love doing it...
There was one line I loved.. ""Just think about all the other people in this world and all the boring things they are doing right now. Love yourself for choosing to shake your hips right now.""
Her videos also include some extras, and bonus performaces of Dolphina herself.  She also teaches you how to create your own bellydancing costumes, and how to perform for your man.",1240185600,18,704,4.754098360655738
3076559,4,B00124SNK2,"I was not disappointed with the Goddess Workout Collection. It ticks the boxes. A fairly light workout if you have a high level of fitness. The technical instruction of each Bellydance move is well explained, the pace of learning I found just right for me (a beginner). However the camera angles frustrated me at times. While Dolphina is busy explaining a move as she demonstrates it, the camera zooms in on her head and shoulders.

3076560,5,B00124SNK2,"Dolphina Belly Dance is a great series for women who want to get a good and fun cardio work out.  Dolphina's focus and goal is to help all women enjoy themselves for who they are and what their bodies have to offer.  While the work out is focusing on your physical appearance, hips, buns, thighs, and abs, Dolphina adds a special introspective view to strengthen the mind and spirit as well.  I highly recommend Dolphina to any woman looking for a fun, exciting way to refresh their daily routine.",1225584000,10,497,4.561797752808989
3076561,4,B00124SNK2,"I really enjoy Dolphina's teaching style, but none of the workouts are really long enough to get your heart rate up or to really ""practice"" the moves. You get about 5-10 minutes of core training with a break between each target area. At the end of each instruction video is a routine, but only 5-10 minutes long. Not enough for real value without the constant need to ""rewind""/""repeat"". I use these videos for core toning and use my Zumba DVDs for the cardio workout. I do find that the core work on the Belly Dancing videos is helping my Zumba workout. Dolphina seems to leave it to the watcher to learn from the tapes and then choreograph their own routines with their own music. Since I am not a choreographer, I can't really do that. But, as I said even though the DVDs aren't what I expected, I am enjoying them very much. I will agree with other viewers that it would be more helpful if they gave Dolphina less face time and focused the camera one the area she is demonstrating. And, it would help if she spent more than 5-10 minutes on each zone. I'm glad that I have them, but I was looking for more of a workout.",1361923200,,1121,4.317535545023697

Had them now about 3 years and after the first year of just these dvd's I joined a class and about a year after that I joined a troupe. These are awsome CD's to do at home as a starter and if you can get in an actual class these make great workouts at home. I usually do her cardio dvd a couple times a week.
I gave only 4 stars because the feet movement is very important and she does not go into it to much on the discs.",1313884800,,472,3.6831683168316833
3076565,5,B00124SNK2,"I have been very out of shape over the last few years and dreaded the workout part of my new lifestyle change but knew I needed to do something and have been searching for at home workout that will keep me motivated.  So I ran across this collection and after watching some clips online decided to give it a go!  How fun this truely is!  I have only gotten to workout to the Intro and Cardio so far- but for what I have done so far I am glad I took the chance on these.  The Intro dvd workout I will admit did not really make me break much of a sweat but the instruction was good and the moves are fun and Dolphina really made a great impression on me.  This one will be more of a ""I don't feel like really working out but want to move and have fun"" dvd I will use.  lol!  A good one to practice the moves with.  I do agree there should have been more focus on what the legs and feet were doing at times though.  The Cardio dvd is my favorite!  I was surprised how much of a workout it was compared to the Intro.  I felt my heart rate go up and the sweat did come on this one and it was a blast the whole time!  She goes into more description of what your body should be doing and explains all very well but keeps you motivated and wants you to master at your own pace. Its definately the one that will get the most plays.  I really like how Dolphina motivates and reminds you to appreciate your body.  These will make you feel like a Goddess!  Great quality production and worth the price!  I recommend it!",1313366400,3,1507,3.9899665551839463

I love using it in the morning or in the evening when I'm too tired to workout - or if I've missed a few weeks, to start my workout routine all over again. Dolphina is fantastic, very encouraging, and she gives very good direction for those new to bellydance. I very rarely write reviews on amazon, but I LOVE LOVE LOVE this bellydance collection. I bought it over a year ago and I'm still in love. If you're looking for a new addition to your fitness or dance routine, you MUST try this.",1312934400,,653,4.360655737704918
3076567,5,B00124SNK2,"I would consider myself a normal working gal with little time to exercise.  I am not a fitness-guru/junkie/expert; which means I am probably like most of the people reading this review.  This video was something I tried as a teen because a friend had it.  I absolutely loved it.  Over the years, I would try other bellydancing workouts that would come on tv, and they all seemed to just be showing off, so to speak.  I would shout at the tv screen ""But what is she doing with her feet?!"", ""What am I supposed to be doing with my arms?!""... the tv shows would never actually teach you the movements, or even warm you up for that matter.  I found this collection much to my delight and was able to purchase it for my home; I couldn't be happier.  Dolphina knows what she is doing (if you have any question of that, go to her website - she has been bellydancing since she was a child).  You will feel great during and after this workout.",1309996800,,934,4.297142857142857
3076568,4,B00124SNK2,"Dolphina can be a bit much, but that enthusiasm translates into a good bellydance workout! I like that she builds up the difficulty, so you can increase the challenge at your own pace. Some of the camera work isn't helpful (like not being able to see her feet sometimes, or not being able to see what she's moving and how) - but those moments are rare.

I'm happy to take some over-emphasized enthusiasm about kundalini or the sacredness of bellydance in order to have an instructor who can break it all down to the basics, who also manages to build confidence through the TV screen. You go, Dolphina!",1303516800,,601,4.564814814814815

I personally feel that I get an exceptional workout, while getting a dose of positive thinking. As a nursing student and mother of three, I look forward to these workouts each day as a way to relax and unwind, and also to feel positive about my body and good about myself in general.

On a side note, Dolphina can be difficult to follow at first, even in the basic video. It took maybe 5-6 workouts for me to be able to follow some of her moves (and I have been bellydancing from various videos for almost 14 years). But then again, many exercise videos can be that way. Also, it can be annoying that the camera focuses on Dolphina's face quite a bit. She's pretty, but I didn't buy the video to look at Dolphina's face...I want to see what her hips, legs, and feet are doing so that I can follow her movements.
