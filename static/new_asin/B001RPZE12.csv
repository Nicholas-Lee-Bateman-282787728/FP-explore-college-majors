3778198,5,B001RPZE12,This documentary on haunted castles is amazing. It was practically a tradition to watch it every Halloween on t.v.. The seller was great too and I received it sooner than expected. Thanks,1326931200,,187,4.875
3778199,5,B001RPZE12,"Product was as promised, came on time. Love it! Anyone who likes history of haunted places will enjoy these DVDs.",1319673600,2,113,4.7
3778200,5,B001RPZE12,"This is a fabulous documentary that is perfect for annual viewing during these ""spooky"" days of Autumn!!! Robert Hardy's narration is superb and the dramatic recreations are excellent.(Occassionally, the graphics are a little lame, but the overall 2~Disc set is well worth the cost and well worth your time.)It is also very ""family friendly"".

3778201,5,B001RPZE12,"I watch England, Scotland, and Ireland over and over and over again, to the point that I can very nearly recite them all. Robert Hardy was a perfect host for this series because he is an accomplished Shakespearean actor (this comes directly in handy twice as I remember, once in England, once in Scotland), which brings his skill as a narrator to a dramatic high meaning that, whether the situation is intrigue (a dime a dozen, but all still creepy) or tragedy (take the worker in Glin Castle [Ireland] for example), Mr. Hardy makes you feel the situation directly.  I'm ordering this one soon, so that I can begin to recite the Wales volume also.  I'm kind of curious why this volume didn't catch on in the secondary VHS market because, despite all the castles in the other three, I have heard Wales called ""The Land of Castles"" at least once.",1249948800,11,844,4.582781456953643
3778202,5,B001RPZE12,"I'm so glad they finally released all of the Castle Ghost series on one DVD.  You get Castle Ghosts of England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales.  Great stories and lovely scenery.  These were formerly on separate VHS tapes and not easy to find.  If you like ghost tales and recreations, this is a great DVD for you.",1246665600,13,311,4.5
3778203,5,B001RPZE12,"4 segments- England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales
Each travels to the location- discusses the apparitions- AND covers the history of why they're thought to be there.

You get the beauty of fantastic castles AND the fascinating history of the events thought to cause the disturbances.

It's bloody good fun for everyone.  In my opinion, it's hands down the most entertaining ""ghost"" documentary out there and would be fantastic for anyone looking to build up the atmosphere with a different episode each night approaching Halloween.",1246320000,21,527,5.325301204819277
3778204,5,B001RPZE12,"I watch this over and over, it makes you feel like you are really there.................I LOVE IT",1245542400,6,97,4.764705882352941
3778215,5,B001RPZE12,I brought this book to find which castles to visit in the UK.  Castle Leslie in Ireland won hands down!  I have visited there twice now.  This book is a must for anybody wanting to find real castles to visit.,1394668800,,208,4.15
3778216,5,B001RPZE12,Entertaining.,1389830400,,13,13.0
3778217,3,B001RPZE12,"Information about the individual castles is really brief and vague. They don't cover any haunting in depth, but it is an interesting dvd to add to your collection if you are into hauntings.",1383955200,,189,4.757575757575758
3778218,5,B001RPZE12,"First saw this when it aired years ago, been looking for it on DVD for years.  Definitely not for children.",1376870400,,107,4.35
3778219,5,B001RPZE12,"I first saw these documentaries on TLC, in the 90's, and thought they were really well done.  After having watched these copies, I am amazed at how much TLC edited in the original showings that is now shown here. Very cool!",1374537600,,223,4.439024390243903
3778220,5,B001RPZE12,"I first saw this years ago on TLC (back when it was The Learning Channel, not True Life Channel)--anyway, I was intrigued by the stories presented.  I did enjoy this program, for ghost stories are a favorite of mine.  What I really liked was how there was history and background given for each haunting.  Regarding the haunting of the Piper of Duntrune, for example, the background of the war between Parliament and King Charles II was given and how it impacted the various Scottish clans.  Or, the reason of King James V's persecution of the innocent Janet Douglas (the presumed Grey Lady).  Robert Hardy did a nice job of hosting each episode, and spoke of his own experiences with hauntings.
I would like to see further episodes done, and of different castles in the British Isles--Berry Pomery Castle, for instance.",1371254400,,819,4.821428571428571
3778221,4,B001RPZE12,"I enjoyed this series even though I'm not a believer in ghostly stuff.
Lots of history and scenes of British castles brought back pleasant memories of the two years I lived in England.",1364947200,,184,4.606060606060606
3778222,5,B001RPZE12,Loved watching it though wished it had closed caption capabilities But it was very well done and was a treat to watch,1362528000,,117,4.363636363636363
3778223,5,B001RPZE12,"I had seen Castle Ghosts of England, Ireland and Scotland when they aired on American TV and had all three of these on VHS tape. WhEn I saw this DVD set and the addition of Castle Ghosts of Wales, well, it was a ""no-brainer"" How nice to have all 4 and on DVD. The best part is there are no parts of commercials on them.",1353283200,,319,3.923076923076923
3778224,4,B001RPZE12,"I bought this because one of the castles in this DVD is in our family heritage.  My dad and I visited there.  The head of the clan, who lives in the castle, said his dogs will suddenly look towards where the ghost is, and act like they ""see"" someone.",1344816000,,250,4.081632653061225

8338624,5,B001RPZE12,All I can say is I wish they would make more like this. I've loved this documentary for years - glad I own it now.,1414108800,,114,3.6

8338627,5,B001RPZE12,I wanted to lighten up the book I wrote on my families castes.  The subject while interesting needed something more than just factual information.  The information was used to help keep peoples attention and severed its purpose.,1401580800,,228,5.135135135135135
8338628,5,B001RPZE12,I saw this when it originally aired on TV.  I recorded it on VHS but as I no longer have a VCR I boxed it up along with all the others and put them away.  I was browsing through ghost stories on DVD and saw this.  I had never seen the Wales segment so it nice to experience something new.  Anyone who enjoys ghost stories really needs to get this.  You will not be disappointed.,1400630400,,378,3.986666666666667
