What is funny is that some predictions that brought laughs when this was made have actually come to pass. Hedgehogs have a better record if the time frame is extended. While hedgehog predictions tend toward being more extreme, it is logical that extreme outcomes might take longer to fulfill.

As typical in economics, a story of success can be derived if we take a selective time slice.

Finally, there is nothing about run-time in the description. This runs less than an hour and isn't particularly well done. There's a lot of stalling and stammering around a deck of PowerPoint slides, half of which aren't discussed.

Move from Tetlock to Bayesian analysis (and there are some very good introductions to both the theory and the practice available) and couple these with 'the signal and the noise' (Nate Silver) to give a totally new perspective on what you are being told to believe, and maybe even on what you believe you believe.",1388016000,,576,4.712871287128713
