The pictures told a story, and that was helpful. There was a lot of good common sense portrayed, that I did not even think about. Thank you!",1506038400,,289,4.178571428571429
8434597,3,B000DZ6VPU,I have other videos and like them much better.  I will keep this for others to borrow or watch.,1404345600,,95,4.0
8434598,1,B000DZ6VPU,"There is no self-defense instruction in this video.  Repetitive videos show you again and again common sense things like ""don't leave your phone sitting on a table"" and ""if you're being followed onto a dead-end street, turn around and walk out"" and ""be watchful when approaching an ATM"".",1395360000,3,287,4.979166666666667
8434599,5,B000DZ6VPU,"This video was produced very well with simple highlights on how a woman should response if physically attacked plus great safety awareness and minimizing victimization. I have interest in developing a woman self defense program and this video helped me observe and reinforce what I was thinking of. It is important to educate a woman on what her natural weapons are and help her develop dexterity using them. Learn main targets like eyes, neck and groin to escape. An attack on a woman usually is more on the intimidation form and several types of threats. Therefore, she should be trained and educated in order to empower her how to respond in that moment of fractions of seconds. This video at minimum can help you get the wheels turning in that direction. It also has nice scenarios.",1379376000,4,786,4.786764705882353
8434600,4,B000DZ6VPU,The other person who wrote a review on this product did not know what they were talking about. This DVD is a multi region DVD (Region 0.) It may not play if you have an old DVD player but otherwise you should have no problems. I have a gopy of this DVD and it works fine. Also the content of the DVD is very good. It was shot nicely and has very high production value.,1220572800,,368,3.92
