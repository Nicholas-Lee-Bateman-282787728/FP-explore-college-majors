8197903,4,B000QXCP04,"This is a 22 minute news program episode that was filmed in April of 1997, so ten years older than its release date. However, the information in the program is valid and as necessary as it was 13 years ago. The program covers an intervention model used at that time in Vermont where new parents were visited, those with risk factors identified and programs offered to the parents and the children to help them both. The governor at the time, Howard Dean, reported that child abuse dropped 30% which he attributed to this program. The focus seemed to be mainly on IQ scores and readiness for school. There is also a short interview with Stanley Greenspan in which he tried to broaden the focus from only IQ to self-concept and social capability, which those of us in the field of early childhood understand is equally important. The age of the video was a disappointment, and I think the airing date of the DVD should also be reported before you buy. But the points the DVD makes are useful, so I can still use it in the teacher education classes I teach to springboard discussion.",1269907200,,1080,4.572164948453608
