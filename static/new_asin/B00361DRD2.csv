8389335,3,B00361DRD2,"A poorly produced video.

Some nice scenes and the music is very good, but it's like someone walked about with a video camera and filmed what ever occurred to them.

Scenes of just the sun and clouds - seriously?

No narration is fine, but a few descriptions of what is being shown would have been nice.",1453939200,,303,4.375

8389339,4,B00361DRD2,"An Artistic video of Switzerland set to Mozart.  Some of the shots are a little blurry, and some are not so beautiful, but on the whole it makes a lovely and relaxing hour.  I look forward to watching more Naxos Musical Journeys.",1373587200,,229,4.428571428571429
8389340,5,B00361DRD2,"I totally enjoy watching, and listening, to Dan Gibson's Solitude tapes and videos. While much of Dan's material centers on Nature and music, the Naxos series of movies are just as relaxing and visually stunning. Great if you have had a stressful day, just want to have some quiet, peaceful time, or just want to light up the fire, have a warm java or hot chocolate with a loved one and relax....I look forward to watching others in the Naxos Scenic series...",1364515200,,459,4.609756097560975
8389341,3,B00361DRD2,"I've bought one of these Naxos Musical Journeys before, so I knew what I was in for.  The music is brilliant, beautiful.  The accompanying film is just ok.  You get to see some lovely scenery, but the images are not sharp.  On my Plasma TV, they came out pixellated.  On top of that, some of the images shown are a waste (e.g. focusing on Swans, sunsets, unflattering cityscapes), it should focus on the scenery and unique/special cityscapes.  SO, I would reccommend you get this, or any other Naxos musical journey, if you're a huge fan of the music and/or the location.  If you have just a mild interest, I wouldn't particularly reccommend it.",1278806400,5,645,4.654867256637168
