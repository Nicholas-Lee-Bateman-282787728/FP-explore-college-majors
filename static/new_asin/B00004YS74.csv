1377604,5,B00004YS74,"Eddie Foy, A vaudevillian meets and marries an Italian Balleria I think her name is Isabelle. Anyway He is in a show called""Mr. Bluebeard."" I remember the name of the show he preformed is Mr. Bluebeard,when tragedy struck at the Iroquis Theater,He was probably in the wings,that day getting dressed,He said,There's something I have to do,I have to see that these people don't get hurt. Eddie also had his son,Bryan with him. He calmed the audience down,which is a vaudville tradition,but most of the musicians left the theater. He became a national hero after December 30th 1903,More people would've been killed if it wasn't for him. Then more children are added to the family when he gets more parts on broadway. His wife dies,of what,I don't know. The kids go on stage.",1129766400,,771,4.848484848484849
1377605,4,B00004YS74,"Good old fashion family entertainment. Bob Hope is the wise cracking head of the wild bunch, who atfirst detest and then learn to love him. The music and comedy is woderful, if you like Vaudeville.",1125014400,3,197,4.6571428571428575
1377606,4,B00004YS74,"I am NOT a fan of Bob Hope's movies. I really never watch him as a comic but this movie was very enjoyable! Great musical numbers and the kids are dolls. Rags to riches. With the combination of music, kids, Hope not playing Hope...you will spend an delightful evening renting or buying this movie.",1040083200,9,297,4.518518518518518
1377607,5,B00004YS74,"This Brentwood Bob Hope DVD has beautiful color and a razor sharp image. The movie is aimed more at music than comedy, and comedy fans may be a little disappointed. But Bob Hope fans and musical fans will be amused.",994464000,10,215,4.4
1377608,3,B00004YS74,"I'd read the previous reviews of this movies and saw it this weekend.  While it was entertaining, it wasn't as funny as I'd anticipated.  The story line was pretty weak too.
On the other hand... The costumes were spectacular, and it was worth seeing the movie just for that!
I was amazed as how great a dancer Bob Hope was!  The table top dance duet with James Cagney was absolutely brilliant!
This isn't really a musical in the sense that people don't suddenly burst into song.  But, there is a lot of music, dance, and vaudvillian routines.",983750400,3,542,4.556701030927835
1377609,5,B00004YS74,This movie brings back so many childhood memories! Bob Hope is at his best in this well done musical. The story is sweet but not over the top. The child performers are excellent! The Christmas scene on the train that becomes Foy's epiphany is touching. Any fan of Hope's or of old time movie musicals MUST add this to their collection.,976665600,,335,4.508196721311475

1377638,4,B00004YS74,"This is a fun movie and ...mostly true.  It is narrated by Charlie Foy one of the seven kids Eddie Foy (originally Fitzpatrick) was left with when his wife died.  Both Charlie and Eddie Foy Jr. had careers of their own in entertainment.
Bob Hope is fine in a real acting role and one of the best scenes is between Hope and Jimmy Cagney.  Cagney reprises his
role as George M. Cohan and the two do a tap dancing number on top of a table at the Friar's club roast of Foy Sr. The movie is worth buying just for that.",1408665600,,513,4.0594059405940595
1377639,3,B00004YS74,"I liked parts of this movie but not all of it. I didn't like how the Father didn't seem to have the concern for his wife the way he should have. I didn't like how the Father went on his merry way after his wife died performing his act with his kids. It seemed to me that he didn't show much remorse or grief about his wife dying and how he should have been a better husband, a caring husband. I didn't like that it didn't have a happy ending and would not recommend that my friends buy this movie.",1396656000,,497,3.98

1377655,3,B00004YS74,"A nice change of pace from the Bob Hope formula, ""The Seven Little Foys"" (1955) is a lively biopic with spirited performances and vibrant Technicolor photography. The tabletop dance with Hope and James Cagney (reprising George M. Cohan) is one of the Great Movie Moments.

1377658,4,B00004YS74,"THE SEVEN LITTLE FOYS (1955) is narrated by Foy boy #2, Charley, who sounds just like kid brother Eddie Jr. Accepting that this musical biopic is mostly fiction, its 93 minute running time would have greatly benefited by the addition of a single reel. Foy Sr.'s early song and dance routines are most interesting (as are his later on-stage struggles with the children). Once Eddie (still a 'single') graduates from vaudeville to Broadway, career success and the passage of time are noted by the use of a series of lighted ad signs that proclaim his hit shows. An opportunity to present a song highlight from each is squandered here. To have done so would've added greatly to this film's depth and in hindsight, its value as a source of theatrical history.

Jimmy Cagney appears briefly as George Cohan. In a testimonial dinner highlight, he mounts a long, shiny black table top and performs his famous ""Yankee Doodle Boy"" steps from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/YANKEE-DOODLE-DANDY/dp/B0009LPY0G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">YANKEE DOODLE DANDY</a>&nbsp;(1942). Although 13 years older and clearly heavier, Cagney has lost only a little of that loose-jointed flexibility. Hope (as Eddie Foy) follows him and delivers a vigorously impressive tap routine. They conclude with a precision softshoe duet.

In typical Hollywood fashion, all this frivolity unfolds while Foy, who's just returned to NY, is unaware that Madeleine (Milly Vitale), beloved wife and mother of his seven children, has died from a lengthy illness that she kept hidden from him.

Angela Clarke is Aunt Clara, the deceased's meddling older sister who, incensed that they must play the Palace during Christmas week, tries to wrest the kids away from Eddie by getting the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children involved (this organization's actual name was the Gerry Society). Foy has his brood do their pathetic stage specialties for the presiding judge and he rules that they aren't performers. Although defeated, Aunt Clara decides not to return to Italy and on one auspicious Sunday, Eddie actually makes it to church with the family!

1377660,5,B00004YS74,"This was a very cute movie. I bought it for my wife because her father Lee Erickson played the second to the oldest kid, Charley Foy. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the movie. There was a scene where Charley Foy was rollerskating through the house and Bob Hope grabbed him and spanked him. My father-in-law told my wife that Bob Hope really spanked him. I believe his words were ""Bob hope has some hands..""

You will really enjoy this movie.",1309910400,,448,4.397590361445783
1377661,4,B00004YS74,"Unlike most slipcovers in which the videotape is removed through an open bottom, this 1987 RCA edition of THE SEVEN LITTLE FOYS (1955) has a tucked-in flap on the long edge that must be opened first. It's a full screen non-pan and scan transfer of a VistaVision Technicolor picture, thus we don't always see all the actors in group shots. Although the tape has a CD-quality HiFi audio track, sound is badly filtered; highest frequencies are damped into oblivion.

1377666,5,B00004YS74,"I had seen this movie before, so knew there was a lot of Bob Hope in this movie.  This movie depicts Eddie Foy as a bachelor, when in fact Madeline was his third wife, who bore him 11 children, seven of whom survived.  The movie indicates Eddie formed a family vaudeville act after the death of his wife in order to be close to his children; but in fact, ""Eddie Foy and the Seven Little Foys"" toured the country from 1910 through 1913, his wife passing away in 1918. My main motivation for seeing this movie was seeing Jimmy Cagney!  He reprises his role as George M. Cohan (ever see Yankee Doodle Dandy?) with a song and dance with Bob Hope.  Watching them dance on a table is priceless.  I'm more a Jimmy Cagney fan than a Bob Hope fan,and it's good, clean entertainment all should enjoy.

1377667,4,B00004YS74,"I'm a big fan of Bob Hope but I'm a bigger fan of James Cagney and it was with with Cagney in mind that I bought this VHS copy of ""The Seven Little Foys"".  The movie itself is rather predictable but Bob Hope helps move it along as he delivers wisecracks as only he can.

I was surprized that the movie began in 1898 because I knew that Eddie Foy had what must have been an interesting career before that.  In a biography I had read of Wyatt Earp, I was surprized to discover that Eddie Foy was an entertainer in the Dodge City of Earp's era.  Couldn't there have been 5-10 minutes on what that part of Foy's life must have been like?

I would have rated this movie ""3 Stars"" but for the scene that I had been waiting for.  James Cagney won the Best Actor Oscar for his role as George M. Cohan in ""Yankee Doodle Dandy""; one of my favorite movies.  I would have thought that the Cagney of ganster movie fame would have been miscast in ""YDD"" but he was quite a hoofer then as well as his encore preformance in ""The Seven Little Foys"".  What I really appreciated, along with the top-notch bantering between Hope and Cagney, was that the duo was given three songs to strut their stuff.  Both Hope and Cagney are very adept at tap dancing as well as ""the old soft shoe"".  Cagney's stiff-legged style is worth the price of admission to (or purchase of) any movie he dances in and I got more than my money's worth in this one.  The scene with Hope and Cagney is one of the great lesser-known moments in American cinema.",1187481600,2,1511,4.229965156794425
