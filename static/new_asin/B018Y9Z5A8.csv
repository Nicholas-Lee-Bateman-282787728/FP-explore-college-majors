7559666,5,B018Y9Z5A8,I got on a Warehouse 13 jag and had to buy this set. Found several episodes I didn't have along with the 5th season (which I didn't know about at all). So far every disc has worked just fine. Great show. Fair price. Nice addition to my collection.,1470528000,,247,4.166666666666667

8743330,3,B018Y9Z5A8,"This rating has nothing to do with the content of the shows. I may be doing something wrong, but I'm watching this on a computer Blu-Ray player. There doesn't seem to be any typical menu icons. There is an option to open a side bar and there are ""Title"" with numbers presumably representing different episodes. But there are no episode titles, and so it's difficult to navigate. And there isn't anything anywhere including the cover or papers included that give the titles of episodes on any one disk. It's a pain to try to watch and be sure you're watching the next episode. Even the numbered titles in the sidebar pane are not in sequence.",1503619200,5,641,4.582608695652174
