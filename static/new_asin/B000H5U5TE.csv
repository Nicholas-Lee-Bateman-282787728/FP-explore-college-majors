2627532,5,B000H5U5TE,"For the uninitiated, these five Canadians are the standard to which all other sketch comedy acts must follow.

Most people know them for Mark McKinney's ""Head Crushing"" bits or Scott Thompson's Buddy Cole monologues. The fact of the matter is that they are so much more than a few memorable catch phrases. Their irreverant humor and ability to find a laugh in the most incredibly mundane situations makes them comedic masterminds. There is nary a dull point in all of their seasons. Some may be quite funnier than others, but they are a joy to watch nonetheless. There is chemistry here...and in spades.

One particular favorite is watching Dave Foley as a lounge pianist who doesn't know a single note on the piano..and he sings about his shortcomings with such glee. Enter Kevin McDonald, who glides across the piano, his lankey frame sporting a sequinned coctail dress. He knows he's not a singer, but like Foley, he sings of his own ineptitude so horribly off key. In about a 60 second bit, they have me rolling. It's so bizarre, yet undeniably hypnotic. That remains my single favorite moment in the whole of the series, and I laugh about it to this day (16 years later).

Other faves include...

Bruce McCullough's open letter to the guy that stole his bicycle wheel..and his open letter to the people that watched the guy steal his bicycle wheel.

Dave Foley as Kevin's pet demon who just want's someone to talk to.

Scott Thompson's ""Running Faggot"".

Mark McKinney as a French Canadian pyromaniac office employee.

The list goes on...

If you haven't given these guys much attention, then you missed out on the best sketch comedy show since Lorne Michaels introduced us to Belushi and company 30 plus years ago. This is your chance to get in on something wonderful that many of us have been cherishing for nearly 20 years.",1193961600,8,1831,4.768987341772152
2627533,5,B000H5U5TE,"Anyone actively or inactively into comedy in the early 90s remembers the ireverence and audacity of this fantastic Canadian comedy troupe. Bring back the experience with this massive, 20 disk collection. The kind of collection that, if you dropped it on your cat it would die, IT'S THAT BIG! Timeless characters like; Mr. Heavyfoot, Cabbage-head, Buddy Cole, Idiot Boy, Danny Husk, Gavin, the Steps trio, Jerry and Jerry Sizzler, Flying Pig and many many more can be yours forever with this great set. By the second season it was clear that these fresh-faced canuks had a great synergy and a type of comdey that hadn't been seen since Monty Python. You won't find original sketch comedy like this anymore. And you won't find a better deal than on Amazon.",1176163200,8,754,4.852713178294573
2627534,5,B000H5U5TE,"If you're checking out this page, you're probably already a fan (or at least know) of the Kids In The Hall, probably the most inventive and weird sketch comedy show from the early 1990's.  Not only is every season worth owning, there really aren't any weak seasons--each one has its ridiculously hilarious highlights, the writing is great throughout, and it's really great to watch certain small characters keep popping up again and again (like Danny Husk, for instance).  The question is, though, is it cheaper to buy the Megaset, or to buy them individually?

I bought all 5 seasons on DVD, which is exactly what's being offered by this product.  I bought mine through alternative sellers, though, which can be a pretty awesome deal--Season One goes for less than 5 bucks these days, and each consecutive season goes for a little bit more; the longer they've been out, the cheaper they are.  If you're willing to buy them as you finish watching them, you could probably save a lot of money going individually, but it might be worthwhile just to get them all at once--just be sure you check around for prices, because you might be able to get a stellar deal.

If, by some chance, you haven't heard of the Kids In The Hall before, now's a perfect time to start watching what you missed--it's kind of like SNL, except less focused on celebrity hosts and a whole lot weirder, more cross-dressing, and more creative.  Fans have always been entertained by great recurring characters like the head crusher, Simon Milligan (lord of the underworld), Gavin the annoying nerdy kid, Buddy Cole, and the list goes on (and on!).  Like any sketch comedy show, some of the bits aren't as successful as others, but that's to be expected--what really entertains me is the Kids' relentless pursuit of fresh ways to get a laugh and look at situations.  If you're new or haven't seen much, I'd definitely recommend starting with a single season, like maybe 2,3 or 4, after they'd hit their stride, then move on from there.

2627571,5,B000H5U5TE,"KITH is the preeminent sketch comedy act. They are in the top with the classics like Minty Python, Carol Burnett Show, and  Benny Hill.
They started in 1984, and their show aired on the CBC from 1989 to 1995. Each season is excellent. They're still collaborating and their live tour is excellent.

I would also add all of these (because I have great taste) to the list, and I know some had shorter runs: UCB, Mr. Show, The State, Exit 57, Little Britain, Key and Peele, Chappelle's Show, Dana Carvey Show, The Kroll Show,Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job! and spinoff Dr Steve Bruelle and Michael & Michael Have Issues. There are so many more and they are excellent, but KITH was way ahead of it's time.",1440892800,3,706,4.5078125

2627592,5,B000H5U5TE,"This was one of the funniest shows I could recall during my teenage years.  I believe this show is Canadian, and it is pact with some very wild and outrageously humorous material for an age range from teen to adult.

 I don't know which sketch I liked the best, but one that stuck out in my mind had been this ""Bobby Terrence vs the Devil"" guitar skit which had me rolling with laughter.

 Big stars, praise, & A+ to this franchise, those Canadian folks are a very funny group of characters up there.  If you like SNL, In Living Color, Mad Tv, Benny Hill, and this older Canadian comedy show called ""Bizarre"" then you will probably like this show too.",1431129600,,651,4.383333333333334

2627601,5,B000H5U5TE,"If you weren't around to see them in the early 90's, some of this stuff borders on comedic genius. It's comedy with it's rough edges proudly displayed, and social taboos disregarded plainly. The troop was made up of men who were brilliant on their own, yet really did feed off of and inspire each other to greater heights. I was a teen of the 90's and remembered many of the characters and skits prior to getting this collection, but owning the total run of the show is something I'm very happy to have the ability to do. I think it's a gem that many will never have the privilege to see, and though that's a shame, it leaves a special place in the world for those of us who have.

Every episode is in it's entirety, including a special episode starring Scott Thompson's character Buddy Cole, and the overall presentation and packaging is superb.

All of the stores I had been in were charging at least $120 for this collection, and somewhere between 30-50 per season. If you love Kids in the Hall this is a great buy. Packaging is.. so so.",1304726400,,348,4.057971014492754
2627715,5,B000H5U5TE,"Still incredibly funny, with quote that i still bring up on a weekly basis. IF you like the show, you'll love this set.

As for the set, the quality if fantastic, the menus are good, the packaging is... adequate. The extras as good, and best of all, all is COMPLETELY uncensored. Any copies I've found previously has been censored. No that CBC censored a lot to begin with, but it's still nice to see.

Oh yes, and although i have ""backups"" of every single episode from TV-Rips, I've discovered a few scenes that I've NEVER seen before. Very nice.

Even for shipping to Canada, the price was great, and quite worth it.

UPDATE: okay after watching about 5 discs, I find that there are MANY scenes that I've never seen, and many were (not surprisingly) never aired. Season one alone, has at least 10 skits I had never viewed before, and most are pretty damned funny.

I've also found the audio to have more highs than i would have liked, but the quality is still great. AH, even now, as I type this, there's yet another ""new"" skti I've never seen.",1301011200,,1046,4.455497382198953

If you like Monty Python, then Kids in the Hall is right up your alley. KITH have so many strange, funny, awesome skits like Night of the Living Dead, 30 Helens, Citizen Kane, Head Crusher, Girl Drink Drunk, and Dave's monologue about the difficulties of being a serial killer. And I love Dave Foley. He was always my favorite. (And he makes a disturbingly pretty girl!) I'll admit, sometimes their sketches are little weird or unfunny from time to time, but that could just be my own sense of humor. But 90% of this show is gold! I recommend this to anyone who loves a good skit show.",1301011200,3,852,4.16969696969697

But, I can't stop watching it now.  I think there are one or two episodes that if you chose to buy (as a single season) or start watching from the megaset that could make you think it used to be funnier when you were younger.
But, get to know them again.  I have to give Scott Thompson and Mark McKinney special recognition.  They play an extreme range of characters and each one is convincing and funny as the last.

The special features are good.  Some live stage stuff and compilations of the seasons best scenes for each season.

A true modern classic.

This is the Monty Python's Flying Circus of Canada and the entire run of the Kids in the Hall is complete and collected here in this fabulous box set.  These masters of sketch comedy evoke the silly, right-out, randomness of the aforementioned Pythons along with the nostalgia of close-knit improv troupes found within the Second City and early SNL-ers.
What a beautiful package this is.  Thoughtfully designed, each season is broken into about four discs with the slim-line cases visibly marked and color coded to let you know which volume of which season you are choosing to view.  The back of each case lists every skit contained on that disc so you can find all your Chicken Lady and Head Crusher bits.  Not only that, but for each season there is a disc set aside with bonus features and a ""best of"" selection of skits for grab and go hilarity.  I was also happy to find a ""Play All"" option along with the usual ""Episode Selection"" choice on each disc's menu.  I don't believe you could ask for a better set without throwing in their diabolically comedic film, ""Brain Candy"".

2627740,5,B000H5U5TE,"I grew up watching The Kids in the Hall and had the fondness memories of them. So I was a little concerned, going back to it now, that the show may not hold up(as so many things do). It took me about 2 months to watch every episode in this set but now I can definitively say The Kids in the Hall produced the funniest sketches I've ever seen.

The creativity, adventurousness and finesse they repeatedly display keeps each sketch fresh and engaging. The Kids can easily jump from mixing up genders, to exploring racial issues, to artsy industrial irony, to slapstick. I'm unaware of a comedic angle that isn't in their wheelhouse.

I also think a big part of their success comes from the structuring of each episode. Sometimes they'll have a reoccurring bit that quickly reappears between main sketches. Sometimes they'll have a sketch that plays out of the entire episode broken up by other sketches. And it may even suddenly merge into another sketch and play out while the credits role. The Kids clearly put a lot of thought into the structure of each episode and use it to great effect.

I recommend The Kids in the Hall to everyone. Bruce McCulloch, Mark McKinney, Kevin McDonald, Scott Thompson and Dave Foley are masters of their craft.",1285113600,,1243,4.666666666666667

I watched this series when it came to Comedy Network and never saw it in it's original incarnation on HBO so I'm looking forward to seeing if anything is different from the old episodes I'd collected on VHS. Now to the only gripe I have... the quality of the video is no better than I'd expect from a VHS. I'd always blamed the less than sharp picture on the quality of the tapes Comedy Central was airing but now I'm wondering if this was just poor quality from the get go.

For instance the Cabbage Head guy, the chicken woman, the head squasher etc.  The office ladies were pretty funny, actually anytime they put dresses on which was often they were pretty funny, and they did not look like to bad of chicks either.  If you were a fan back then this set is worth having.  Nothing was off limits for the kids, from sex,race,gays,death,religion and so on and so on.  They were all over the place.

They are all priceless. One of the sketches that always cracks me up is when Scott Thompson's character decides he wants to be an Indian woman. I don't know why, it just does. Bruce McCulloch's annoying kid Gavin is awesome as are Simon and Hecubus (""EVIL!""). And the one where Kevin and Dave are trappers in an office building. I could go on and on, it is impossible to pick one favorite. Then there are their monologues...absolutely priceless!
