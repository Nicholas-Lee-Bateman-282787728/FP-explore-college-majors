8411861,4,B004047Y0Q,"Be aware it's a sub not a dub.
Nice little slice of life story about young girls wanting to play baseball and the trials they endure. It left me wondering how close to reality the story could have been.",1421625600,,202,4.205128205128205
8411862,4,B004047Y0Q,"""Taisho Baseball Girls"" is a series that will never gain any major accolades or high popularity.  Nor is it flashy or dramatically riveting.  But even so, ""Taisho Baseball Girls"" is a good and charming anime that takes place in a time period often overlooked.  ""Taisho"" is no homerun, but in it's 12-episode run they still win the game in good stride.

CONTENT ISSUES:
Generally, this series features absolutely nothing to worry in it's visuals or language.  However, there is one bath scene (Episode 10) but nothing is shown.  Most of the shots are the girls in the water with only shoulder to head visible.  There are short clips of the girls scrubbing each other's backs (as is the custom) but hands, arms, and rocks cover the vital areas.  And the one clip where they leave, it's an upper and side view where they walk out while blocking ""the view"" with towels and each other.  One other remote thing that some parents may find a little heavy thematically for little kids is the fact that ""girl B"" has a bit of an attraction to ""girl A""...and ""girl C"" has a bit of attraction to ""girl B"".  Nothing really comes of this, and it's mainly used as means of subtle comedy.

MOVING ON:

Plot (absolutely no plot spoilers)-
Honestly, this is not a complex show by any standard.  A high school girl wants to challenge a boy's high school baseball team for reasons that are her own...and with help from her friends and American English language teacher she puts together a team to do just that.  That's all there is to it haha.  I'd even dare say that the synopsis given on the back of the DVD is a bit misleading, trying to make this show seem much more than it really is.  In the end, even the general plot is merely a backdrop for the show.  The joy of the show isn't so much in the story, per se.  It's actually in the everyday journeys they take to improve and explore new things...while developing a stronger bond as a team and friends.  The pacing, itself, is pretty good.  They never let you stay in one spot too long...but calmly take you from each event to the next.  There are is some drama and tension...but it's not really as ""heart wrenching"" as other shows.  That's not to say it's bad...in fact, the situations are very real situations an issues that ADD wonderfully to the story...not detract.

Girl power without the girl power -
One thing I really appreciated in this show was the portrayal of the old ""girl power motif"".  A lot of other shows follow the ""don't-disrespect-me-just-because-I'm-a-girl"" kind of idea...and then go beating down boy team after boy team to show that boys aren't ""all that"".  ""Taisho Baseball Girls"" is drastically different.  Taisho's angle is this: if you want respect, put in the effort to deserve that respect...don't assume you are simply entitled to it.  And that, to me, is a much more meaningful and lasting message.  It plays out really well in the show.  As they struggle to improve and become better, the girls realize that by treating their practices lightly they disrespect the efforts of the boy's team (who are vying for a national ranking, btw).  And as the boys watch the efforts and growth of the girls, they learn to take the girls more seriously...not because they are afraid of losing to them, but because playing the girls with less than their own personal best is a huge insult to the real serious effort the girls have invested...a far more real and lasting equality if you ask me.

Dub versus sub -
No debate here.  There are only Japanese Dubs with English subtitles...as has been the trend with other ""Sentai Filmworks"" products.

Extras - Absolutely none ^_^ save some trailers for other shows and dvd credits

ALL IN ALL -
""Taisho Baseball Girls"" will be a hit or miss.  It's extreme slice-of-life'ness with a plot that becomes more of a backdrop than a driving plot will win some audiences and lose others.  Still, for me personally, this is a wonderful show that I find worth keeping.  It has a wonderful message and vibrant atmosphere.  It was quite refreshing to see one side earn major respect without completely destroying and stepping all over the (supposed) opposition.  Not only that, but the character interactions really make this quite amusing.  It is no home run...but it is solid and good.",1367193600,2,4273,4.65287049399199
8411863,5,B004047Y0Q,"On paper, Taisho Baseball Girls seems incredibly dull.  The story is pretty typical of sports anime (motley crew of seemingly incompatible personalities overcomes adversity to earn the respect of their peers), the baseball scenes are portrayed more realistically without the flash and over-the-top animation of incredibly mundane plays typical of the sports anime genre, and the girls (being polite, reserved, and modest girls of the Taisho era) are hardly what one would call ""hot-blooded"".  Despite the premise in the description on the back of the DVD, it's not really a female empowerment (Do people still say ""Girl Power""?) anime either.
So, without a real message, fairly sub-par animation, a story that's been done to death and a lack of fanservice (which studios often use to compensate for weaknesses in the other three), you get an anime that, on paper, seems like a throwaway, shovelware, busywork to show your economic partners that you're still working...

So why is it so good?

If I had to condense it to a single phrase I would say ""Consistency of Tone"".
The fact that it isn't really bogged down with symbolism of some kind of message; the fact that baseball is portrayed as it is without trying to replicate the excitement of a real game with flash; the quiet, reserved, yet generally cheerful girls; and the incredibly vanilla, yet very heartwarming romantic sub-plots make for a naturaly lighthearted feel that is absent from even most Slice of Life series.  Add the fact that the characters are a lot of fun and interact naturally (in no small part thanks to the voice actresses who portray them), the art-direction, and the unique time period and you end up with a very memorable series which, by all rights, should have only been a footnote AT BEST in anime history.

It's really surprising how something so mundane can be so unique.
If I HAD to compare it to something, the closest thing in overall tone/feel I could compare it to is the 1993 film ""The Sandlot"".

Put simply, if you have any interest in this series at all, buy it.  Chances are very good that you won't regret it.",1341273600,5,2104,4.825
8411864,4,B004047Y0Q,"Actually , except for Koume, most of the girls come from wealthy families.

Akiko, the pitcher, is wealthy, and her fiance was a scion of the family which owned Mitsubishi (which would be so obvious to Japanese viewers,but not to Americans).

The firebombing of Tokyo largely missed the wealthier part of the city, so most of them would have survived.

Koume is loosely based upon a real person whose father cooked the first dish of curry in Tokyo. In here Koume's fiance is a Japanese, but in reality he was an exile from India, who ended up as a cook in the Tokyo restaurant to cook authentic curry and married the owner's daughter. They had two children, but one of them was killed in the Battle of Okinawa.",1312934400,4,710,4.53125
8411865,4,B004047Y0Q,"Taisho Girls doesn't belong in the same league as Neon Evangelion or Utena, but it isn't trying to either. It's a sweet and very funny show about a group of girls who want to play baseball. The show's writers do a great job developing many characters in a short amount of time. For you yuri fans out there, the show definitely has yuri undertones, but it stays firmly grounded in the PG world. The plot is quick-paced and the show closes with a solid resolution. Although Taisho Girls doesn't tread any new ground, it is a lot of fun. Definitely worth checking out.",1306281600,,565,4.495145631067961
8411866,5,B004047Y0Q,"This is a light, twelve episode anime based on a series of YA novels (which evidently haven't been released in the US). The target audience is reportedly Seinen, or YA boys. I am not sure I'd agree. This is a girls sports anime all the way. Sure, there are boys, but the girls have to play somebody. I liked it, even though it was too sugary-sweet in places. This would make a great Disney movie, if only they could get a dog into it.

It's set in 1920's Tokyo, during a period of widespread Westernization under the Taisho emperor. As everyone who reviews this anime will tell you, this is when the sailor suit uniforms were first introduced, for boys as well as girls. What they won't tell you is that, while the boy's uniforms are reasonably well portrayed, the real girls sailor suits were black, had skirts down to the ankles, and looked like something a 1880's American school-marm would wear, unlike the ones portrayed here, and everywhere else.

We start out with an introduction to Tokyo of the early 1920's (before the earthquake) through the ""Tokyo Song"", which shows off many of the prominent landmarks of the city, and is set to the tune of ""Marching Through Georgia."" Quite aside from the story, this is a good slice-of-life look at a country in transition.

The plot, such as it is, revolves around one middle school student deciding her all-girl academy should have a baseball team, as a way of showing up her traditionalist fiance (arranged marriage), who believes a woman's place is in the home. The story proceeds through the Recruiting of the Nine, the Floundering First Steps, the Determined Training, and the Final Game. Along the way the students, with their blonde American advisor -- in an anachronistically short, pink 1990's style outfit -- invent most of the basics of baseball. They scout the other team, the catcher passes signs to the pitcher, they even develop a `magic pitch' curve ball, after accidentally inventing (and then discarding) the knuckleball.

The chief dynamic here is the interaction amongst the girls as they learn, bond, and form a team. Along the way they face opposition from their parents and many of the school officials, but that only makes them work harder. At one point, episode 7, probably the funniest of the twelve, they sneak out at night for some batting practice.

Each of the girls has a distinct character, even if some of them aren't very deep. The main POV character is Suzukawa Koume, the catcher. Her restauranteur family are fairly strict traditionalists. She wears a kimono to school and calls her parents ""honored mother, honored father."" Her father disapproves of girls acting like tomboys, and halfway through the series her parents arrange for her to be betrothed to their apprentice cook. The girls characters develop as their teamwork does, and it's this that makes the anime worth watching. Unlike Big Windup, there's not a lot of baseball detail here, but there's enough.

The anime is subtitled only, with a surprising number of footnotes (except they're at the top of the screen) explaining such things as what ""Girls Friend"" magazine was, and what the girl's term for a leadoff batter meant. The artwork is realistic people (no anime faces), with a subdued watercolor background. I'd recommend it for anyone with young teen or maybe preteen daughters. They might be inspired to go out and achieve things of their own. You don't have to mention that these girls, 14 and 15 years of age in the mid 1920's, will be in their 30's at the start of WWII, and will likely die in the firebombing of Tokyo.",1294444800,3,3578,4.790923824959481
8411867,4,B004047Y0Q,"We don't get enough sports anime in america so I was real happy when I first heard about this show. This is typical sports fair where a group of people get enough people together to create a team and from there learn to play with one another as a team and get better through a series of trials. What makes this series different is it's very short at only 12 episodes and it takes place in the 1920s so everything is just starting to get westernized. Not as good as Touch, H2, or more recent ones such as Cross Game and Princess Nine but at only 12 episodes there's not a lot they can do. If you like sports anime, this isn't bad. It kept me entertained for the entire 12 episode so I can't complain.",1290297600,5,699,4.147058823529412
