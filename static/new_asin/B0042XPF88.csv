4252398,1,B0042XPF88,"I had the impression this was an all new movie. In fact, the Lion of Sodor feature is one of 4 shorts. I thought it was going to be like Misty Island Rescue, which indeed was a full-length, one story adventure.",1295481600,10,210,4.146341463414634

in feb. but couldn't help but open it and watch it sooner. We love
this DVD. Its super cute and my son was happy to see Hiro in another
DVD and loves the piglet episode. Definately would recommend this
to any parent who has children who likes thomas.",1294531200,3,314,4.080645161290323
4252401,5,B0042XPF88,"This is an adorable Thomas DVD. It is about learning to listen, rather than just assuming which is what Thomas does.  My boys are only 2 and 3 years old and of course don't listen so I am hoping this DVD will kick something into gear for them!  I also love it because it is in the new CGI animation so it is more brightly colored and animated than traditional Thomas.  This DVD has a total of four great episodes and lots of extras, great DVD for the price!",1291939200,19,457,4.112359550561798

4252405,5,B0042XPF88,"One of the things that I like the most about the Thomas movies is that they always succeed in teaching my daughter (currently 3 years old) some good lesson about life.  This time it's all about listening carefully and being patient.  Given the fact that Thomas movies typically sell for more than double this current price ($4.50 + free shipping with Prime), there's no reason not to pick this one up if you have a Thomas fan.  We didn't have any issues with the sound or movie quality.",1398902400,,486,4.5

4252415,4,B0042XPF88,Grandson watches this often but not a true favorite.  He may have seen it too many times before we got a Roku and liked some of the lesser known Thomas movies better,1376438400,,165,4.15625

4252419,3,B0042XPF88,This is a very good Thomas and Friends video but the sound kept wavering soft and loud. If it wasn't for the sound issues I would have given the video a 5-star rating.,1371859200,3,167,4.090909090909091

4252421,1,B0042XPF88,"Both of my grandchildren watched this one-hour video last night, and actually showed signs of worry when Thomas entered the mine!  Great fun, and well done as are all the Thomas products we've used (eg., the Thomas & Friends games from the iTunes store).

Biggest negative: after the show, my youngest (3) insisted on seeing another one, rather than going to bed as agreed beforehand!  (He lost that argument ;-)",1362528000,,412,4.857142857142857

8414005,5,B0042XPF88,Another great Thomas and Friends movie. I really love watching Thomas and Friends with my toddlers. The lessons they learn about being polite and listening are valuable in today's world. I think these movies and the books teach children to consider others and how they feel and how their own actions affect their community as a whole. I also really enjoy the little features in between stories with Mr. Perkins. He is so lovable. My children love him and pretend to be him when they play with the trains.,1465776000,,504,4.674157303370786

8414007,5,B0042XPF88,Used to watch this show with my kids back when George Carlin was the conductor in the early nineties. (What a unique casting choice that was.)
