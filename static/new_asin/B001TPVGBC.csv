The applications section is poorly lit, but you can glean some useful stuff from them. I was disappointed that she didn't include the Teacups exercise, which is almost more important than the forms. It's seems she saved her variations on that for her Martial Rotation video, which I have as well. Though she doesn't call it Teacups. It would have been good to include it here and fewer applications. Sadly, Ms. Zorya has passed away and it seems Julie Hinder or whoever her successor is or was is not continuing in this vein. However, for the price, it's very good.",1407369600,,699,4.737704918032787
8342247,5,B001TPVGBC,"I'll get the bad over with, real quick:  it's a tad on the grainy side, Ms. Zorya's accent is a little thick at times, and if you're looking for your idea of flowing, pretty, mystical internal martial arts mumbo-jumbo, this ain't it!

I was really surprised at what you get here, there's a lot of content.  It's two DVDs, with lots of demos.  I was so happy to find so many demos of Bagua in use!  Looks pretty darned painful too, to be on the receiving end, I really winced and felt bad for Ms. Zorya's training partner a lot!  You can find some footage on YouTube to get an idea.

So if you've done a little Bagua or seen some, you know that a lot of time is spent walking the circle, perfecting the forms/shapes, and so on.  And a lot of that is covered in the first disk.  But you also get a lot of what those ""shapes"" are used for in actual application, what might seem like just gently raising an arm up in a single change turns out to be levering the enemy's arm to break or lock it, and so on.  Really interesting stuff, especially when done so the training partner is being thrown around so hard.  Yeesh, I'd hate to get hit like that but that's training.

Now if I could just find someone who's schedule & interests are aligned with mine enough to practice some of this stuff with!  So yah, if you're interested at all in Bagua, or just a martial arts fiend, I highly recommend this one.  Don't let the fact that it's ladies training you bother you.  In fact, come to think of it I reckon that's a plus!",1253145600,9,1513,4.186851211072664
