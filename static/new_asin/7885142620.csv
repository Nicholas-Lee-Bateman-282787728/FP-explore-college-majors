I enjoyed the intimacy that the film maker allows us to experience with Bruce's family and moments. Also, the way they broke down and focused on Bruce's fighting technique was great and made me feel like I stumbled upon a magician's secret. Bruce's relationships with his family and friends were very entertaining to watch.

I highly recommend it to a movie fan and then a Bruce Lee fan.",1308096000,3,537,4.826086956521739

The only thing any of them had in common was they were trying to take advantage of Bruce's fascinating life story for financial gain. This film is different. It is closely CLOSELY based on the book by Bruce's younger brother Robert of the same name. It is by far the most accurate account of his life. It takes a few dramatic liberties but the important things are very very accurate. For example, it shows Bruce with IP MAN, his wing chun teacher, but most interactions are with Ip's disciples, which is historically accurate. Excellent action choreography; excellent acting; awesome story. A must-see. This DVD was also terrific. Very high quality high-bit rate video. Minimal compression. Excellent sound and English subtitles. This DVD on Amazon here is all-region so you can play it in the USA.",1296086400,8,899,4.960264900662252
