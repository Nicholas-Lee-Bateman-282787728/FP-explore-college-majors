2711110,5,B000LP521Q,"I watched this video when I still lived in China and it was an excellent source, indeed. The way he shows you how to tie the rope dart in a certain way so that it functions as a chain whip until a loose loop is released is worth the price of admission alone. It blew this experienced martial artist's mind.

I feel as if he is both humble and mad at the same time, as he isn't afraid to show when he makes a mistake (as is bound to happen with flexible weapons) and truly has some martial spirit that he unleashes with some of the techniques that he knows could pierce a man's heart. At the very end of the video you will see him showcase the power of the rope dart and to say that I would not like to be on the receiving end would be a grand understatement.

This video will not teach you how to become a rope dart master, but it will guide you in the right direction. That's certainly more than I can say for many other videos which offer flash when what you seek is substance. I rate this video five stars for offering clear instruction and some practical knowledge.",1283990400,2,1069,4.134615384615385
2711111,5,B000LP521Q,If your thinking of getting into Rope Dart martial arts but don't want to go to a dojo you gotta get this dvd.  The instructor is very good and clearly demonstrates all the moves at the best camera angles.,1277942400,2,205,4.256410256410256

8162503,4,B000LP521Q,"Mr. Kiolbassa presents a structured approach to using a rope dart, and the video has a menu that is very helpful to jump back to pieces of material.  His program is broken up in to four weeks of skill drills and five weeks learning a form.  The only part that confused me about his presentation is that he doesn't explain the grip that he's using on the rope with his right hand (it felt backward to me, but I got used to it), or how he has the rope wrapped around his left wrist (so I just wrapped it around my left hand a few times to get the length about where he has it).  Also, I assume that the form he's presenting is a competition form since he mentions ""facing away from the judges"" at the start of it, instead of being a ""traditional"" form.  Personally, I study/practice martial arts for my own benefit and am not really concerned about the ""lineage"" of the material, but some people are so I figured I'd throw that comment in to this review.

The video is a little grainy, it looks like it was recorded on video tape and transferred to DVD, and I really didn't like the music that was chosen for the menus.  But, overall I'm very happy with it.",1434672000,,1155,4.2272727272727275
8162504,5,B000LP521Q,Nice instruction. Some good tips.,1420329600,,33,5.8
8162505,5,B000LP521Q,"This video is the only source of information I found to have the weight of a traditional rope dart (which is 350 - 400 grams) as well as a meteor hammer (750 grams).  There's also some cool things you don't see like how to ""schlep"" or carry the rope dart.  He has one way in which he strings it along the rope dart around his body and another where it wraps around his waist.  He also shows how to basically convert your rope dart to the length of chain whip.  I've watched this video a couple times, but I see it more as a video to watch and practice in-depth when my training is more advanced, so I have something to look forward to when that time comes.  Although you can find this video on YouTube, I bought it because it wasn't that expensive, and it has better quality compared to the YouTube video.  It was hard to see the details of the video on YouTube compared to the actual DVD.

I have a YouTube video that talks about the rope dart specifications (my channel name is ""Xolette"") and I'm in the process of making a video that shows how to make a practice rope dart using a rubber ball, o-rings, screw eye, and rope.  In fact, I've used how he converted his rope dart into one that is chain whip length to practice chain whip skills first.  (If you can do a chain whip drill, it's easy to transfer over to rope dart;  chain whip is said to be a pre-requisite to rope dart, or is taught simultaneously, with rope dart).",1397174400,6,1428,4.216911764705882
8162506,5,B000LP521Q,Worth every penny spent on this dvd!! Bought this dvd few years ago-- I still didn't master the move where you shoot the dart behind your body with your FOOT--i consider that an advance move--still working on it. Great production and instruction--Master Kiolbassa wants you to succeed--he is a great instructor --he even answered some questions I had via his youtube channel.  Great for beginners that want to see the breakdown of each move.  Its too bad he doesn't have any intermediate or advanced rope dart dvd.,1390089600,,514,4.896551724137931
8162507,5,B000LP521Q,This was a great introduction to ropedart. It walks you through step by step and will take you to low level competions.,1342137600,,119,4.454545454545454
8162508,5,B000LP521Q,"Very good movie, very well explained. I wish a few more moves were broken down but its royalty useable. Also an above head camera would make some moves much easier to understand. I highly recomend this product to anyone who want to at least try to use a rope dart or meteor hammer, as much of the movements are alike, I myself cauldnt do badly anything before watching this movie, now I can do almost everything in it. You've just got to practice and don't become discouraged because you wake up the next morning and you've got a bruise pb the back of your arm big enough to cover a bent paper plate. All in all, this is a highly recommended product it is very easy to learn from. 5 stars.",1326067200,,689,4.267175572519084
8162509,4,B000LP521Q,"Shi De Biao does an excellent job of demonstrating many techniques in this video as well as giving some basic information about the weapon.
He shows you 3 excellent ways to transport your ropedart, one being a slip knot around the body for keeping the weapon ready on a trek and one way to effectively turn it into a chain whip that slips back into a ropedart when you throw it out the right way! The form demonstration on this video is not particularly great, or easy to follow, but the real value in this video is in the techniques presented. All of the techniques are described and broken down into easy to follow pieces. He starts off with very simple and basic techniques, but progresses to some more advanced techniques towards the end of the video. The part I find the most impressive, is that he is demonstrating these techniques with a proper traditional ropedart head, which is effectively a 400 - 450 gram (About one pound maybe a bit less) sharpened double-edged spear-head! If it hit you, it would ruin your week!
My only real complaint is that the translation is a bit hard to follow, though you can get the gist of what he's saying. Ultimately it doesn't matter too much because the physical demonstration is well done.",1310947200,,1234,4.588235294117647
8162510,5,B000LP521Q,"Don Hyun Kiolbassa, the winner of a gold medal at the Shaolin martial arts competition, teaches a clear and well coreographed Rope Dart form in this video.  He describes each move in adequate detail, breaking it down with different camera angles and some slow motion.  It contains more advanced moves than the video by Eric Shou-Li Yao (which is also worth watching).  Well worth the investment.",1297382400,2,395,4.954545454545454
8162511,4,B000LP521Q,"This is an excellent instructional video. For anyone looking to carry on the art, this video is a beginnners lesson that is second only to one on one training with a Sifu. Explaining the mechainics of the weapon before basic movements is always a sign of someone who is a master of their craft. Steps are well paced and instruction is clearly defined. Audio tracks may slip from time to time but the visual ques allow you to infer what the audio may confuse. Dont be put off by the home made look of the dvd jacket and disc. The information on the disk is the beginners treasure anyone without a Sifu trained in the use of the rope dart can ask for.",1284854400,2,649,4.284552845528455
