2629311,5,B000H6SY28,"I just got ""That Girl - Season 2"" over the weekend, and even though I haven't finished watching all the episodes, I can say that this set is as great as Season 1! The picture and sound quality are the best (which is true of all sets I've bought that were put out by Shout! Factory), and the episodes are as funny as the first season's. The New York City location shots for the 1967-68 season are outstanding, and there seem to be a lot more of them than in the previous season (plus there're a lot more guest stars!). One thing I did notice was that the bonus features for disks 1 & 2 were actually reversed from the way they were listed on the packaging, but this is minor. I especially enjoyed watching the black and white, unaired pilot, ""Two's Company""...the show that got Marlo Thomas noticed by ABC (there are some moments with Paul Lynde in this that were absolutely hilarious!) I hope that the future seasons contain a lot more of these archival materials, like more network promos, and maybe an early episode of ""The Joey Bishop Show"" with Marlo playing Joey's sister, Stella.
Now if Shout! Factory would just release season sets (complete with similar bonus features) of a few fondly remembered, one-season-wonders from the same era: ""Hey, Landlord"", ""Love on a Rooftop"" and ""Occasional Wife""!",1163980800,16,1303,4.645021645021645
2629312,5,B000H6SY28,"One of my favorite sitcoms!!!! I knew no matter how many extras there were it wouldn't matter as long as I had every wonderful episode. The show is timeless and it brings back so many memories of that era. The only thing different with the season 2 package is there was no episode guide with the plot descriptions as with season 1. I was wondering if there just isn't one or if I am missing it.

No matter though. I cannot wait for Season 3!!!

2629358,5,B000H6SY28,"This show aired as I was born.  When I was a kid, and it was syndicated on UHF, I thought it was cootie-girlie stuff!  However, I was always fascinated by the ""That Girl"" kite, I noticed the fancy clothes she wore, and that winking-waving mannequin in the opening was a demonic monster-doppelganger...

40 years later, I ran across this show on MeTV and was amazed at how well written and acted it was.  ""That Girl"" is a semi-buried gem of American TV. There was nothing like it before or after.  The witty romance-comedy writing and performances make this series shine.  It takes a lot of hits from critical creeps claiming it is too aged, or the clothes are dated, or the show doesn't look like modern TV.  Who would say such things?  ""That Girl"" portrays an honest, though glamorized, view of romance in the pre-revolution of American culture.  This is a peek backwards to morays and entertainment of a better time in our culture when people weren't portrayed as mere lust puppets or treacherous backstabbers.  There was charm and sweetness along with less-admirable traits creeping into many stories' situations.  Greasy and lascivious aspects were displayed, but they weren't hammered home with relish, while the fast banter and clever word play often keeps the viewer above the mire by a thread.  Marlo and Bessel were SO good together that they probably destroyed their future acting careers with this show--they would always be Ann and Donald to American audiences.

This show always had the cooties.  It still does.  The only difference is that I'm old enough to enjoy cooties.  I just missed the show by a few years--those years when most guys would love Ann Marie to fly their kite.",1436918400,4,1693,4.826388888888889
2629359,5,B000H6SY28,"It all started here. Before Mary Tyler Moore, Rhoda, and Murphy Brown.  A lot funnier  in my opinion. I love seeing all the old 1960's car scenes.",1435881600,2,146,4.37037037037037
2629360,4,B000H6SY28,"The Season Two Box Set of ""That Girl"" (1967-1968) includes a very odd Bonus Feature: The un-aired, unsold pilot for ""Two's Company"", in which Marlo  Thomas played Caroline Summers, a young wife who goes back to work as a model after her husband quits his job... but she doesn't tell her husband she's going back to work.  What?? This premise definitely does not fit Marlo Thomas, as a strong actress or a strong woman. Good thing ""Two's Company"" did not sell to series. When ABC TV came calling on Marlo  soon afterwards, she had the much more solid, and feminist-minded, idea for ""That Girl."" It's a good thing that Marlo played Ann Marie, and it's a great thing that Ann had boyfriend Don Hollinger (Ted Bessell). In Season 2, the relationship between Ann and Don grows tighter and deeper.
  Season Two features the ""Opening Sequence"" that is fondly remembered: Ann runs around New York City, she smiles and waves at an exact, but slightly more glamorous, double of herself in a department store window, and joyfully flies a kite. As on the Season 1 Set, series co-creator Bill Persky and Marlo offer warm commentary on select episodes.
  Ann has lost  neighbors Judy and Leon (Judy Scott and Dabney Colman) from Season 1. I don't know where they went or why. Don's co-worker from Newsday Magazine, Jerry (Bernie Koppell) and his wife Ruth now live next door to Ann. A pre-""Laugh-In"" Ruth Buzzi has a slightly odd recurring role as Ann's tomboyish friend Pete. Ann also makes friends with Broadway star Ethel Merman, who appears in two episodes.
  Ann's career as an actress does not exactly go smoothly, however. In the two part episode ""Philadelphia Story"", Ann lands the lead in a Broadway play and must go to Philadelphia for the ten week out-of-town tryout. Don is put in the unfortunate position of reviewing the play, which is terrible. A devastated Ann briefly goes back home to Brewster before returning to NYC and Don with renewed spirit. When Ann gets her next shot at Broadway, her father (Lew Parker) causes havoc at the theatre when he keeps buying and switching sixty five tickets. In between Ann's Broadway dreams are the end of the year holidays. Ann's attempts to prepare a big Thanksgiving dinner turn into a double family farce, and Ann and Don spend Christmas Eve in jail.
  Noel Prince, a handsome British photographer, poses the only real threat to Ann and Don's relationship. In  another two part episode, Noel falls in love with Ann and plans to take her away from Don. A jealous Don does not take this lightly. Noel refuses to give up, and returns in a third episode. In a dream sequence, Ann wonders about being married to both Don and Noel simultaneously! Ann realizes, of course, that she likes Noel but she truly loves Don.
  There is only one Don... or is there? In yet another memorable episode, Don goes out of town for a few weeks, An injured Ann, meanwhile, goes to hospital and meets sexy Dr. Rex, (also played by Ted Bessell) who is Don's exact double, except for dark hair and glasses. Unlike devoted Don, however, Rex is a swinger! Rex can't resist showing up at Ann's apartment pretending to be Don! It almost works, but when Rex kisses her, Ann knows that Rex is not Don. Season 2 confidently capitalizes on the fact that the real chemistry between Thomas and Bessell gives ""That Girl"" its endearing sparkle.",1434931200,,3351,4.704273504273504

I would say that women would enjoy it more than men, but even my husband got tickled at a few lines he would walk in on.  The show is so refreshing.  ""Anne"" and the other characters are fervent in their patriotism, respect for others, love, doing the right thing just because it's the right thing to do, work ethic - values that seem to be deteriorating today.  The cast and sets are GREAT; the story lines are cute and funny.  I LOVE seeing Anne's now-vintage clothes and jewelry!  The sound, picture quality and packaging are GREAT.  I own all 5 seasons, watched the whole series twice and can assure you that at some point, I'll watch the whole series again.  It's truly a 5-Star purchase.

2629398,5,B000H6SY28,"Twirl your purple parasol in the air with joy; ""That Girl"" charms her way right into our hearts for a second season.
This 1967/68 season brings more of Ann Marie (Marlo Thomas) and her antics in trying to become an actress, dating Donald (Ted Bessell) and wearing great clothes and the best false eyelashes ever!!

Special moments from the season feature:
-Ethel Merman and Ann bonding over stuffed cabbage in ""Pass the Potatoes, Ethel Merman.""  There's real chemistry between Merman and Thomas that is endearing.
-In ""Absence Makes the Heart Grow Nervous"" and its second part ""The Philadelphia Story,"" Ann gets a part in a play that will take her out of town for rehearsals.  Worried about being apart for a while, Donald and Ann decide to spend as much time as possible together before she leaves.  This is noteworthy for the scenes of them exploring NYC - dancing, dining, at the Statue of Liberty, at the train station.  It feels more like a movie with the nuances in detail and the wonderful music.
-""It's a Mod Mod World Parts 1 & 2 are especially noteworthy since Ann is modeling, and the fashion that was such an integral part of this show is heavily featured.  Marlo is stunning.
-""The Good Skate"" features Donald and Ann doing a commercial together...or trying to.  They are always funny, romantic, sweet and real.
-""Thanksgiving Comes But Once A Year, Hopefully"" features Ann cooking her first Thanksgiving meal and brings in her parents as well as Donald's.
-""'Twas the Night Before Christmas, You're Under Arrest"" is a cute Christmas episode with Ann and Donald getting arrested on Christmas Eve as they try to prevent a potential robbery that Ann may have caused.
These are a few favorites of mine, but all of the episodes are so much fun it's almost impossible to choose.

Extras include:  A 1965 pilot starring Marlo called ""Two's Company.""  This is a very nice extra to have.  It's black and white, features Anne Jeffries and Paul Lynde and really shows what was probably the first step in creating ""That Girl,"" even though Marlo is quite different in this.  Even her voice is pitched a bit lower at times.  Another enjoyable feature is ""That Show...That Woman...The Creation of That Girl:  A New Beginning for Women.""

The DVD quality is excellent.  The colors are fantastic.  The theme song will just make you happy!  This girl highly recommends ""That Girl!""",1392076800,,2377,4.812807881773399

2629402,5,B000H6SY28,"After a solid debut, the groundbreaking sitcom That Girl, returns for a second season that features a lot more fun, romance, and laughs, as aspiring actress Ann Marie (Marlo Thomas) continues to pursue her dreams in New York City, with the support of her devoted boyfriend Donald Hollinger (Ted Bessell), and her loving parents.  The show also features a brilliant new title credit sequence emphasizing Ann's zest for life, which ends with Thomas' signature hair mussing.

With Ruth Brooks Flippen taking over as story consultant, and a new group of writers on board, the stories are stronger, and the writing more creative, and on point.  Ann and Don, are involved in adventures that take the series in fresh new directions, which reflect Ann's maturity, and also her evolving relationship with Don.  Lew Parker and Rosemary De Camp return as Ann's parents, but she has some new neighbors, as the Bessimer's have departed, and been replaced by Don's co-worker Jerry Bauman (Bernie Kopell,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Get-Smart/dp/B001E0O8DA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Get Smart</a>, The Love Boat), and his wife Ruth (Carolan Daniels).

It is clear from the start, that the bar has been set at a new level, as the season opens boldly with Broadway legend Ethel Merman appearing as herself, starring in a stage production, in which Ann also has a minor part.  ""Everything is coming up roses"", when Ms. Merman comes to Ann's apartment to prepare dinner, and also give cooking tips to Ann's father Lou Marie.

Season Two is mostly a delightful journey for Ann and Don, as their love grows and faces new challenges.  Some serious subjects are featured, as in a modest way, Ann's morals and sexuality are explored, as she is pursued by other men, tries to help a chronic drunk, receives obscene phone calls, gets involved with a wealthy older man, dates a gigolo, and is offered a movie role that requires her to be nude.  Marlo Thomas, who was already 30 years old, was usually very convincing, playing someone much younger, but Ann often did seem much wiser than her years.

Other highlights include a return visit by Ethel Merman, who nearly breaks up the marriage of Ann's parents.  In another episode, Ann hosts a Thanksgiving dinner where her parents and Donald's parents meet for the first time.  In a two-part adventure, Ann journeys to Los Angeles, working with a famous British photographer, who has fallen for her.  And an all time classic episode, Donald returns from a hunting trip sporting a huge beard, which affects the way that Ann feels about him.

The second season of That Girl, might be the best in the series, as the young actress from Brewster, appears to be growing up fast, and spreading her wings.  Ann gets some cool jobs, meets a variety of people, and visits new places.  Her relationship with Don is tested, and only becomes stronger, as Ann remains sweet, angelic, and virginal, an idealized role model, for the newly liberated mid-60's woman.

Shout Factory has done a stellar job with the DVD releases of each of the five seasons of That Girl.  Image quality for the 30 episodes in season two, is consistently very good, although unfortunately there are no subtitles.  Marlo Thomas and series' co-creator Bill Persky, provide commentary on three episodes, and also included is the unaired pilot for a 1965 series called ""Two's Company"", that Thomas co-starred in.  If you are looking to get into That Girl, Season Two would be an ideal place to begin.",1376784000,,3527,5.037865748709122

2629417,5,B000H6SY28,"The fun continues in season two(1967-1968) of That Girl on DVD. Shout Factory added extra features such as a Marlo Thomas featurette and the rare, unaired Two's Company pilot. Musician Earle Hagen composed an alternate That Girl theme music that was used until season five. The last season added lyrics to the That Girl theme. One of my favorite episodes in season two is where Ann Marie meets Dr. Rex Kennedy, a doppelganger of Donald(also played by Ted Bessell). There's a two parter where Ann Marie travels to California to work with an English fashion photographer. There's another episode where Ann Marie has to learn how to skate so she can act in a TV commercial. Around 1970, Marlo Thomas did try to get away from her wholesome ""Ann Marie"" image with the drama Jenny(1970), but that's another story. Ted Bessell does deserve the nickname ""That Guy"". Marlo Thomas and Ted Bessell did have a lot of chemistry together. Bessell worked on the Tracy Ullman Show. He passed away in the 1990's. Bessell was polite, well-mannered, and good looking. The late Lew Parker was also good as Ann Marie's old fashioned, conservative father. In the unaired That Girl pilot, Harold Gould played Ann's father. Ethel Merman played herself in 'Pass the Potatoes, Ethel Merman'. In another episode, Ann Marie tries to force Donald to shave his beard and Ann gets even by cutting her hair short! Season two of That Girl is just as fun as season one.",1345939200,4,1435,4.790322580645161
2629418,5,B000H6SY28,"First let me say that the official Amazon review is quite a good one. The only problem I have with it is the retroactively conceived comment ""...the chaste morals of 1960s television--ridiculously out of step with 1960s real life--"". It IS true that nothing suggestive ever happened on TV sitcoms (or any other genre of tv show) at that time, which largely stayed that way through most of the 1970's as well (check out That girl's clear successor, The Mary Tyler Moore Show, or the even later double entendre filled ""sex romp"" Three's Company), but it is FALSE that the wildness portrayed today about that era was about anything other than a tiny fraction of the population, even the including the youth. Yes, things did go crazy later, without question, and post-67 '60's was ""freer"" than the period of most of the first two seasons of That Girl, but only by so far. This is a clear example of rewriting the past based on perceived Pop culture attitudes and a superficial myth-induced understanding of history. The Amazon writer would be be correct if he was talking about the mid, and certainly late 1970's, but alas not about the mid to early-late 60s.",1340928000,,1155,4.7227722772277225

2629420,5,B000H6SY28,This show was the best in it's time. Very funny and also Marlo is a role model for women. I own the whole series and watch it alot.

2629421,5,B000H6SY28,"When this television series premiered in September 1966, I was just past my twelfth birthday and was beginning to notice girls pretty steadily or to be more accurate, notice pretty girls steadily!  I was already infatuated with Elizabeth Montgomery's delectable good witch Samantha in ""Bewitched"", and Barbara Eden's curvaceous Jeannie sans bellybutton in ""I Dream of Jeannie"", they plus a pre-liberated, sun-kissed charmer, Jane Fonda were my three favorite blondes in the entertainment industry.  Still, I think my motor raced a little more for the classy brunettes: the doe-eyed, gloriously gorgeous Natalie Wood, 60's supermodel Jean Shrimpton with her marvelous face, and slender mini-skirted legs that seemed to be eternal, and of course Marlo Thomas' pretty, effervescent actress Ann Marie of the glossy ebony, flipped out hair and dazzling smile in ""That Girl"".

The series ran for 5 seasons from 1966 through 1971, and in it's portrayal of a young woman who wants to achieve a career as an actress and is in no hurry to get married, ""That Girl"" was considered to be a trailblazer.  It paved the way for other classic sitcoms about single woman pursuing careers such as ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" and ""Murphy Brown"".  The premise is of Ann Marie (Marlo Thomas), a young recent college graduate who leaves her parents' home in suburban Brewster, NY to try to achieve her dream as a successful actress in Manhattan.  Although she has a steady boyfriend, Donald Hollinger (Ted Bessell), who is a reporter for ""Newsview"" magazine, her immediate goal is her career, not marriage, even if she has a lot of detours and setbacks on her path.  She also has to take some rather unique and humorous part time jobs to pay her bills when the acting opportunities are slim.  Her overprotective but loving father Lew Marie (Lew Parker) continues to be a strong, often interfering presence in her life, tempered by her more sensible, pragmatic mother Helen (Rosemary DeCamp).

The Second Season of ""That Girl"" is my favorite and in my opinion the best of the series.  As in the case of many successful television shows, all the elements began to click, the show found its rhythm and style, building on the firm foundation of the First Season.  The romance between Ann and Don was stronger, the warmth and attraction starting to deepen into love.  The scripts are sharper, more creative than Season One, and now that the series is a confirmed hit and was renewed, the production budget has been substantially increased.  Besides having more stylish and expensive sets and costumes there is also more location shooting, all around New York City, there are also forays to Philadelphia and Los Angeles.  A colorful, jazzy new opening is introduced with a bouncy musical theme highlighting a starry eyed Ann Marie enchanted by the myriad delights of New York City ranging from a montage of glowing Broadway theatre marquees of then current hits to coming face to face with a chic mannequin version of herself in Bergdorf Goodman's windows.  In this season, Jerry and Ruth Bauman played respectively by Bernie Kopell and Carolann Daniels came into prominence not only as Ann and Don's best friends but also as Ann's next-door neighbors.  They balanced Ann and Don well and added a nice comic touch to the proceedings.  Guest star appearances this season include Ethel Merman, Sid Caesar, Joan Blondell, Bill Bixby, Rich Little, Ruth Buzzi and Dick Shawn.

Some of the better episodes are: the two appearances by the queen of the Broadway musical Ethel Merman, who is a clarion powerhouse and also utters the title line of this review, very droll Thanksgiving and Christmas stories, a two parter where Ann is discovered and romanced by a famous young English photographer who hires her as a model, Ann being offered the starring role in a film that requires a nude scene, Ann worrying about her lack of sex appeal, the appearance of Don's twin, Dr. Rex Kennedy (Ted Bessell is a dual role), Don growing a luxuriant beard to Ann's dismay and when Don's fault finding mother (Mabel Albertson) discovers a pair of his trousers in Ann's closet and jumps to wrong conclusions.  Still my all time favorite is another two-part story, ""Absence Makes the Heart Grow Nervous"" and ""The Philadelphia Story.""  In these, Ann gets a lead in a Broadway bound play that has its first out of town tryout in Philadelphia.  In the first episode, Ann and Don dart all over New York City just like tourists with marvelous location shooting at landmarks such as the Statue of Liberty and the Central Park Zoo.  In the second there are some great shots of Philadelphia such as Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell.  These episodes sparked my love affair with New York City, although I lived a mere hour away in a Long Island suburb, up to that point I had never been that attracted; it also piqued my interest in the Broadway theatre.  I even reenacted the Manhattan episode with my future wife, where I introduced her to several NYC top tourist spots and included a matinee of a wonderful Broadway musical on one sun splashed Saturday in May.

The role of Ann Marie made Marlo Thomas a household name, and she is the perfect ingnue, eager, fresh, and beguiling without being cloying or coy.  Her sunny optimism and joy of life shines through, and she is extremely endearing and loveable, yet is ambitious and determined, her goal kept firmly in sight.  Ms. Thomas also was quite the clotheshorse, immaculately dressed in the height of late 1960's/early 1970's fashion, and was very fetching in them, even if as a struggling actress there's no way she could afford such an extensive wardrobe.  Regardless, it's quite apparent why she was a role model for young girls and an early crush for young boys like me!

Ted Bessell's Donald Hollinger complements Ann perfectly, his own man comfortable in his own skin, more pragmatic than the quixotic Ann, but always supportive of her career dreams, even if her methods for achieving them sometimes baffle him.  There is an astute intelligence, a low-keyed attractiveness and an underlying strength in his portrayal.  Bessell and Thomas make the classiest, most appealing television couple since Dick Van Dyke and Mary Tyler Moore, and their vibrant chemistry is the key factor in making the show work so well.  Also, even though Ann and Don maintained separate apartments, and the relationship to all intents and purposes appeared ""chaste"", now viewing the series as an adult, there seems to be a sexual undercurrent between the couple, and it wouldn't surprise me if they were lovers in the flesh as well as in spirit.  In one of the episode commentaries, Marlo Thomas and one of the series creators and writers Bill Persky more or less confirm this that they thought the relationship was certainly consummated.

Regarding the DVD transfers of the show and the sound quality, uniformly excellent ""The Shout Factory"" does an exceptional job.  The bonus features are a short subject on the show's creation called ""That Show...That Woman..."" quite interesting, a never aired pilot Marlo Thomas did before ""That Girl"" called ""Two's Company"", while you see Thomas' appeal revealed, the show itself is rather mediocre, you can understand why it wasn't picked up.  Finally, there are commentaries by both Thomas and creator Bill Persky on several episodes that are informative and fun overall.

So, if you like a lighthearted fairy tale that has romance, sparkle, style with a veneer of elegant sophistication, that actually depends on good writing and acting to gets its laughs and the entire family can watch together, you won't want to miss- ""That Girl""!",1294963200,,7658,4.940763834762276

2629438,5,B000H6SY28,"Marlo Thomas returns as perky Ann Marie in the second season of this memorable sitcom.

Ann's journey toward becoming an actress leads to many hilarious adventures - usually along with her dry-witted journalist boyfriend Don Hollinger (Ted Bessell).

Memorable episodes include ""Thanksgiving Comes But Once a Year, Hopefully,"" in which Ann cooks for the Maries and the Hollingers, with hilariously disatrous results; ""The Collaborators,"" in which Ann and Don attempt to co-write a play; and ""Pass the Potatoes, Ethel Merman,"" in which Ann meets her Broadway idol.

Of course, each time Ann comes within a breath of possible stardom, she generally winds up losing it due to some unforeseen circumstance. It doesn't make viewers love her any less; instead, they continue to root for her, sure that the next episode will bring her everything she's ever dreamed.

This box set also includes a bonus feature, in which present-day Marlo Thomas comments on her experiences within a series which really broke ground in how female television characters were portrayed. 'That Girl' lead to 'The Mary Tyler Moore Show' a decade later, which in turn lead to countless modern shows viewers often take for granted.

2629445,5,B000H6SY28,"The second year of THAT GIRL is one of my personal favourites.  The writers really got a sense of life in New York showbusiness, with cameos from many great stars including Ethel Merman and Sid Caesar, amongst others.

The series follows the experiences of a young woman trying to lead her own life in the big city of New York--a bold concept for situation comedy in the 1960s.  Marlo Thomas plays Ann Marie, who leaves a comfortable homelife in small-town Brewster for the bustle of New York.  Armed with Broadway dreams and faithful boyfriend Donald Hollinger (Ted Bessell), most of the episodes in THAT GIRL tended towards Ann's various attempts to break into showbusiness.  Lew Parker and Rosemary DeCamp play Ann's well-meaning parents.  Sadly, producers did not bring back Ann's neighbours, Leon and Judy Bessemer (played by Dabney Coleman and Bonnie Scott) for the second year.

THAT GIRL was a ratings smash for the ABC network, originally airing in the lucrative Thursday night line-up with ""Bewitched"" and ""The Flying Nun"".

This 4-disc set from Shout! Factory includes all thirty uncut episodes from the second season of THAT GIRL, plus some great extras (new interviews with Marlo Thomas, audio commentaries on several key episodes, and rare promotional footage).  The original unsold, unaired pilot of a proposed sitcom entitled ""Two's Company"" is also included here.  It was Marlo's performance in this show that got producers at ABC talking about tailoring a sitcom especially for her...and the result was THAT GIRL.

2629465,5,B000H6SY28,"I forget just how ground breaking and cleaver this great series was.  And Marlo Thomas and Ted Bessell had so much chemestry.  They were funny, sweet, respectful and very realistic as a loving couple.  The comedy never gets old and I enjoy watching it over and over.  The release of this series on DVD was long over due.

  Season one had some sound problems, at least the dvd I got did.  The sound was very bad and you had to turn the volume up very loud to hear it and even then it seemed muffled.  They have corrected that problem in season two.  The sound is great, although I did find a couple of spots where the words were slightly off from the movement of the mouth - kind of like watching a Japanese movie, but those moments lasted only a few seconds and it could possibly have been a problem with my system and not on the dvd itself.

  The bonus features were hit and miss.  The unaired pilot of ""Two's Company"" where producers first discovered Marlo Thomas and liked her so much they vowed to make a sitcom for her, was ok but weird to watch.  Marlo Thomas IS Ann Marie and seeing her as another character in another situation just seemed awkward.  It was intersting to watch, though.  However the audio commentary with Marlo and Bill Persky for the Ethel Merman episode was irritating.  This is a concept that needs to be abandoned.  You can't hear the dialogue of the show and you can't see the two commentators (Thomas and Persky) as they talk over the show and tell their thoughts about each episode.  It got old very quickly.  But that isn't what I bought the dvd for... I bought it for the 30 wonderful episodes and I was not disappointed.

2629468,5,B000H6SY28,"A lot has been said about Ann Marie (Marlo Thomas) but I would like to take some time here to explain why I love and not merely ""like"" this show: That Guy, Don Hollinger. Ted Bessell was a comic GENIUS. His greatest asset was not ""trying"" to be funny. He was cool, he was kind, he was jealous, he was the perfect compliment to Ann. That Girl may have been a success without Don, but  I stand here today to tell you this show would not have lived this far beyond 1971 without Ted. Beyond him were the smart styles of the era, Ann's innocence that did captivate, but the true heart and motivation that was at the soul of That Girl was Don. I suppose if you wanted to draw comparisons Desi to Lucys Lucy could serve in a pinch but looking deeper there was genuine affection that Don and Ann had that cannot be manufactured through goofy mishaps. These two light up the screen like few others and I for one am HONORED to be able to have a piece of this special time when TV was more about charm than harm.

The boxset itself is another Shout! masterpiece full of content like commentaries (when they speak!) and even an unseen pilot Marlo shot before That Girl. The packaging is smart and colorful, durable and yet sensible, in a way they just packaged That Girl in the very way it was produced.
