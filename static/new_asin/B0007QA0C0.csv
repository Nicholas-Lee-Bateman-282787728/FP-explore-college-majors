8050401,4,B0007QA0C0,"This dvd is about 6 focus points of powerful breastroke: streamlining whilst gliding, pointing toes to the sides and then kick, closing feet together after kicking thus hiding it before the next cycle of kicking, jumping up and front to get the maximum head pull, dive to the front rather than down thus channeling energy to the front, and wide and fast armstroke.

But to be fair, Amanda stated that some of the techniques are especially her own style and not for everybody.

This video has helped me in achieving fast breastroke, fast enough to challenge a decent freestylist at 50m just by applying fast start-up, powerful kick and streamlining, and with just an average of 8 strokes per 25m length.",1214524800,8,702,4.793388429752066
