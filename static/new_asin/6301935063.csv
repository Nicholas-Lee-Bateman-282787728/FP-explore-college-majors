388216,5,6301935063,"This little gem of a movie never struck it big. It has gentle humour, with no overt vulgarity, but with just the right touch of fun, leaving you with a warm feeling all over. Victor Banerjee as Ram Das & Warren Mitchell as I Q Patel are superb, particularly the latter. The music is amazingly perfect, with little theme music for each character. The movie captures a flavour of Indian-UK mixture, in a pleasing way, without any supercilious or racial overtones. All in all, a rare gem. I wish there could have been a sequel.",1157760000,8,524,4.526315789473684

388292,4,6301935063,very funny  movie. Saw it in the late 80's and loved it. Has stood the test of time. Being a physician it is even more funny. These things can happen. Mr. Bannerjee is a very good actor and Trevor Howard was a riot.,1390348800,,215,4.0
388293,5,6301935063,"Who doesn't like a predictable fairy tale? Same old plot with refreshing humor. Virtually everybody have good performance. My favorite dialogue -

- I don't like violence. It's against my religion.
- Mine is not.

That sums up how Great Britain conquered India. Well, history has its own sense of humor. Hindus and Muslims are now conquering London.",1389312000,,349,5.0

388295,5,6301935063,"I watched this movie first time in 1989 in a remote theater in India. Since then I have been looking for this movie to watch it again and to show it to my friends. Did not find the movie in the internet for years. I am so happy to be able to watch this movie after a long time. This is one of the finest comedies I have ever watched. In spite of good actors, good story and excellent acting I have no idea why this movie has been lost under the shelves.",1353283200,,453,3.881720430107527

388297,5,6301935063,"I watched this one in 1988 on a tape. Somehow, the title of this movie was ""hotel calcutta"". I think people misclassified this as some kind of soft porn. However, it is one of the most poignantly funny movie. Typical British attitudes and points. It is really funny with quite serious acting. I recommend it to be watched with your partner.",1322956800,2,340,4.590163934426229

388301,5,6301935063,"Foreign Body is a sexy, sassy comedy about a fake physician in London who specializes in a very different kind of bedside manner.
Victor Banerjee, the India-born star of  A Passage to India, stars in  Foreign Body a unique British Comedy of errors. Based on the novel by Roderick Mann. He plays a jobless immigrant from Calcutta, Banerjee steals money from his own father in order to get to the UK . There he makes contact with his cousin Warren Mitchell, who arranges for him to get a job as a bus conductor. But when he begins to  pursue a pretty white woman, Banerjee loses his job because of the girl's influential father. His luck changes radically when he performs mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on a bus accident victim, whereupon he is mistaken for a doctor by friendly model Amanda Donohoe (liar of the white worm). Donohoe talks up the skills of this ""new Indian doctor"", and before he knows what has hit him, Banerjee is head physician to the Prime Minister of England--with virtually every woman in the land vying for his services in bed! Never letting on where it is heading next. Trevor Howard plays the veteran physician who lends Das his expertise along with a vibrating couch!",1219708800,4,1191,4.716346153846154
