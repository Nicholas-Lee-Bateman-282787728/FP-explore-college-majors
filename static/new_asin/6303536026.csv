676419,5,6303536026,"Okay, okay, so Xtro is no academy award winner, but in terms of sheer bizarre entertainment, it can't be topped. I first remember seeing Xtro when I was about 9. It was a strange film experience that I never forgot, if you see it you will certainly understand why. Xtro has to have one of the most disturbing and entertaining birth scenes of any film, ever, period. I happen to own a vhs copy of Xtro that has been seen many times by myself and friends and family alike. Check it out if you have a sense of humor and an apreciation for cheesy sci-fi.",1035244800,2,550,4.247619047619048
676651,5,6303536026,"Not only is this movie a cult classic, I've liked this film for years.  An alien comes to Earth and has to take the form of a human.  The only way it can do this is to be born from a woman.  The rebirth, so to speak, is one of the coolest (and shocking!) moments I've ever seen on a sci-fi film.  A must-see for horror and science fiction fans.  No doubt!",1359849600,,355,3.875
676652,5,6303536026,"One could never accuse Xtro of being a copy of any other film as the whole thing looks like it was thrown together and made up as they went along.
A man taken by aliens returns for his son and from the moment it starts xtro is a wild, wild trip.
Made on a very limited budget this film is very good because you can add to or take from it what you will, it can mean anything you want it to mean with the ending only making matters more confusing by giving us a deeper void to ponder.
I guess you could call Xtro a sci-fi art film.
I love it.",1295568000,2,540,3.830357142857143
676653,4,6303536026,"It was the summer of '94, when randomly skimming through my idiotic Leonard Maltin movie guide, I discovered an intriguing yet haphazardly produced film entitled Xtro. After reading Maltin's critique, I was still curious of the films content, regardless of Maltin's bad review. Despite all the hubbub, I finally sat down in my new pad and watched this so-called bad movie.

A quick opening scene zipped by, that of an Englishman Sam, played by Philip Sayer who's playing in the yard with his son Tony. Thereafter an Xtro, or alien, abducts Sam who then returns 3 years later as an alien. At this point Sam rapes a woman who then gives birth to a full grown man, the new and improved Sam. Monotony occurs when Sam return to his wife and the film dawdles in scenes where a midget clown turns Tony's nanny into an alien breeding machine.

As you can see Xtro has its good and bad moments. However, even if these scenes (i.e. the pregnancy scene) may seem revolting, they were done for a reason:  Hint, the birth of the 2nd coming (ala the film Begotten). If the director Harry Bromly Davernport had eliminated these ingredients for ""family viewing"" (ala, Leonard Maltin) we'd have motel art. In short, a composition is not completed until it has its colors, and Xtro is filled with 'em. Xtro represents the security from fear, disturbance, and bigotry; in effect Nirvana. As you finish watching the film you'll understand why.

I deeply recommend Xtro for cult buffs who relish grade Z production. However, those repulsed by gore should stick with a Spielberg production.",1289779200,2,1568,4.796296296296297
676654,4,6303536026,"""Xtro"" is a cautionary tale about what may happen if Daddy was kidnapped by aliens and then three years later........he returns...  It's how Dad returns that has to be one of the most outrageous, slimiest, and twistedly funny scenes I can recall, at this moment, ever seeing.......More on that later.

Mom and Dad, Rachel and Sam with their young son Tony are staying at their cottage in the countryside outside of London.  Rachel leaves to do some errands and father and son are playing fetch with the family pet. The sky blackens, winds reach hurricane force and a shaft of light envelops Dad and he vanishes.

Three years later Rachel and Tony are living in their apartment in London along with Analise, a French Au Pair and Rachels new boyfriend, Joe.

Rather than detail the whole story, their are some scenes that should be explored including Dad's outrageous return to Mother Earth.

A small space vessal crashes in the countryside and a creature resembling a combination of a piranha, reptile and a grasshopper, slithers and hops towards the cottage once occupied by the family, taking a brief timeout to kill a nosy motorist and his girlfriend.

A young woman now residing at the cottage is attacked and knocked unconscious by the pir-rep-hopper creature and it then prceeds to mouth-rape her.

Now for the outrageous scene---when the girl wakes up she finds herself 9 months pregnant with a baby bump the size of an over-sized beach ball and something is trying to claw its way out. She falls to a sitting position on the floor, wracked with contraction pain and as her legs spread, out slides Father Sam all six feet of him, covered in slime and after-birth as he savagely chomps down and severs the umbilical cord.

Father and son now reunited, the son is horrified to witness his father greedily slurping down the contents of the eggs from Tonys pet snake. Tony runs away but Dad finds him and convinces Tony that he has changed and needed the snake eggs. Sam then bites down on Tonys shoulder and transfuses some of his alien DNA into him.

Tony starts to turn alien and with the help of a midget clown with a rubber hammer, AnaLise is knocked unconscious and Tony tranfuses her which turns her into a human egg sac and the eggs bright as Easter eggs slide down a chute fron inside to outside her body.

Father and son now completely morphed into pir-rep-hopper creatures prepare to return to whence pir-rep-hopper creatures come from but first alien dad kills his wifes new boyfriend.  Apparently even ugly, evil aliens get jealous.

""Xtro"" is one of my guilty pleasures from the 80's and one of the film's assets is, at 83 minutes it plays like half that time. And there are no ""filler"" scenes to pad the running time-every scene speeds to the next one.  The movie may be outlandish, outrageous, gory and unbelievable but hey, that's its charm and although I remember the movie, Father's rebirth scene I will never forget.",1279411200,3,2938,4.724070450097847
676655,3,6303536026,"Let's not be mistaken, this is not a very good film by most conventional standards. It lacks some basic character and plot development, particularly between the father and son characters and has more than a few non-sequitur moments that are seemingly included just to exploit the whole slime-bucket, B-movie schtick. With that said, it does just that very well. In fact, this film pioneered new frontiers of gross out, almost to a surreal extent, most notably the ""birthing scene"" that most people seem to remember. It's not just the absurd grossness, however. XTRO actually has moments of ""atmosphere"" and a very creepy one at that, particularly toward the end in a scene where the alien version of Sam is holding the hand of his half mutated son Tony in a field before they flash off followed by a creepy, ambiguous 80s-synth tone that isn't really ominous nor reassuring, just bizarre and unsettling. However, I was a bit disappointed when I heard the director say that any atmosphere was merely an accident. For the good things I can say about this film there are more bad moments (In fact, watching the trailer for XTRO might be better than the actual film); including random midget clowns, sadistic toy soldiers and a black panther that comes from nowhere, all orchestrated by the increasingly evil brat of a son, Tony. In fact, neither the father nor son come to be very amiable in the least. They are actually quite evil toward everyone except for each other which is another unsettling feeling XTRO converys, very nicely summarized in its tagline. XTRO is nothing to be read into in great detail, its bad but almost so bad its good but not quite there (still worth a viewing). Its really nothing more than an excuse to be gross and a big middle finger to ""friendly"" alien films of the day (ET).",1276387200,,1803,4.745222929936306
676656,4,6303536026,"Back when I was a kid, scanning the horror titles at the local video store, I'd always been drawn to that cool looking cover box with the little boy and the creepy looking alien.  NO, I'm not talking about Mac and Me, I'm talking about Xtro!!  Yes, Xtro, that quirky low budget British alien flick.
For those who weren't blessed with these childhood memories, here's the rundown:
Sam disappears one day while playing with his son, Tony.  Tony saw that his dad was whisked away by aliens.  Three years go by and Tony is still haunted by the incident, and his mother Rachael, has moved on and got herself a new man, Joe.  But one day, out of the blue, Sam returns!  He's not quite the same Sam he was-he arrives on Earth as a slimy, fanged creature, but soon returns to his normal form(in an interesting birth scene).  He finds his way back to his family and causes a stir, now being plunked right in the middle of his wife's relationship with another guy.  Tony is pleased as punch at having his dad back though.  Soon Sam is spilling the beans to Tony about his having been abducted and living on another planet for the last three years.  Soon he's eating Tony's pet snake's eggs and infecting Tony with Xtro-itis.  Now Tony has his dad's Xtro powers, and now accompanied by a midget clown, starts doing evil Xtro things like killing his annoying neighbor lady(which he does by blowing up his toy soldier figure to life size and sending it to the old bat's apartment to kill her), and impregnating the sexy housekeeper(Maryam D'Abo, who's on hand to show the audience a bit of skin) with Xtro eggs.
Sam plans nf bringing the whole family into the fold, but it isn't as easy as he expected, especially with the nosy Joe around.
I really like this movie.  It's quite bizarre and hallucinatory(though not artsy).  A lot of the movie doesn't really follow logic or make a bunch of sense.  Much isn't explained, such as what exactly the aliens are trying to accomplish.  You can make educated guesses on that point, but you're left in the dark about a lot.  In the disc interview with director Davenport, he says that folks have tried to dissect the film and find meanings, but Davenport assures us there is no meaning to be found.  They were just trying to make a bizarro movie.  It's not as bloody and gory as it's reputation would have you believe, but for the time it might have surprised some folks.  A very cool and (almost)forgotten movie.
 The disc has an interview with director Davenport, where he talks about the Xtro trilogy.  He's a very funny and amusing guy who's not above making fun of or all out trashing his films.  He really makes Jan Michael Vincent sound like a dunce.
Definitely an Xtrordinary film.",1241308800,,2717,4.535934291581109
676657,5,6303536026,"XTRO concerns a man abducted by aliens, who returns to his family 3 years later. The coolest thing about this movie is its sheer oddness and loony set-pieces. We get a crawling grasshopper-legged alien, a man born fully grown (in disgusting fashion), murder by 6' tall living action figure (one of my favorite scenes in any movie), an eeevil, homicidal clown, and a woman turned into a coccooned egg-laying machine! XTRO is a nice, unsettling sci-fi / horror oddity w/ weirdness to spare! Also, Maryam D'Abo just doesn't seem to be able to keep her clothing from flying off! Eeek!...",1240444800,2,583,4.84
676658,3,6303536026,"The quality of the DVD is clear & very good. But I love to watch this movie when I was young, but right now, I don't feel it so scary anymore like last time when I watched this movie",1198713600,,182,3.6923076923076925
676659,3,6303536026,"Sam Phillips(played by Philip Sayer)is a family man with a wife ,Rachel (Bernice Stegers)and a son Tony(Simon Nash)One day he is abducted by aliens and the sct is witnessed by his son .His wife will not believe her son's story and insists he is rationalising his fathers abandonment of the family.
Then 3 years later Sam returns claiming he remembers nothing of what has happened to him in the interim. Soon his family begin to notice something odd is happening -such as his eating snake eggs ,and leaving behind a trail of horribly mutilated bodies .In the time of his abduction Sam hgas become an alien -a reptilian creature with a voracious appetite for human flesh .The object of his return is to take his son back with him to the alien planet from whence he came.

This movie bore the poster tag line ""Not all aliens are friendly""in what seemed to be a refutation of the warm cuddliness of ET .The main point to make aboutthis movie Xtro  is that its effects are gross and quite repellent. The gors content is high and viscera abounds .It is NOT for the delicate of stomach. The domestic scenes are poorly acted and directed and some material is just palin irrelevant -as per the telekinesis sub-plot and the scenes of toys coming to life .On the plus side you do get a very clear sense of the sheer""alien-ness""of the creature and its utter disregard for human life and its own urgent need to survive

Stir in some nudity with the violence and you get a graphic and explicit movie that when it works it works well but overall has too many dull patches to be anything more than adequate",1195603200,2,1590,4.533101045296167

676760,4,6303536026,"I saw this film at the cinema when it first came out and there are some sequences that have stuck in my mind ever since. This flick is a whole lotta fun when you're not in the mood for a serious drama or heavy type of film. For a low budget job, it has very good acting and some cool sfx, and whilst it's obvious where it's inspirations come from, it really doesn't matter, at least not for me. (and I like serious sci-fi too!) It does have some very creepy moments and seriously stomach-churning gore, but it's just so weird you can't look away.

676761,2,6303536026,"First of all the special effects are bad, but this is to be expected in the early 80's. It's almost bad enough to look like it was made in the early 70's though. I wasn't expecting too much here though, so no surprise.

What's disappointing was the story. I enjoy random events in movies (The Lost Highway for example), but this movie was random half the time, and the other half it tried to tell a story. This conflict made it impossible to enjoy the movie. It had 2 or 3 enjoyable scenes, which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. But they weren't enough to make this movie bearable.

I watched the commentary by the director Bromley-Davenport after the movie. Can you be any more ridiculous? He trashed his own movie for like 10 minutes - ""This film is just trash."" And you know what? He's right, this movie sucks. I wouldn't even call this a decent B movie.",1134777600,4,864,4.294478527607362
676762,5,6303536026,"In the ""It followed me home, Mom---can I keep it"" camp of storytelling comes XTRO, a little tale of intergalactic parenting that goes to show the lengths some guys will go to to get out of paying child support.

""Xtro"" proves that even if you're the ultimate in deadbeat Dads---one who traded the basic patriarchal duties to go intergalactic bar-hopping for a few years with alien abductors---you can always go Home again.

Only: Home might not be exactly what it was. And you might not be exactly the same Dad you were to begin with. And when you get done, Home is going to *definitely* have gone through some radical remodelling.

Call it Home Improvement, E.T.-style.

That's pretty much the raw meat and bloody viscera of ""XTRO"", a deliciously sick, gloriously gory, considerably raunchy little tale of alien invasion, glistening, silky little alien eggs, bloodsucking parasites, leering circus dwarves, coughing panthers, and one man's quest to secure visiting rights to his estranged son, and the Devil take the consequences!

Whatever you think of XTRO, you've got to admire Sam Phillips's (Philip Sayer)pluck in getting back together with his kid (wee little Simon Nash). For one thing, the flick's relatively sane opener---a scene of Yorkshire domestic bliss, daddy playing outside a rustic cottage with his son---is interrupted by a little fire in the sky, and poof!: XTRO serves up one nasty alien abduction, piping hot!.

Things careen from one level of insanity to another pretty much after that.

Sam, evidently, sustains something considerably more life-changing than an anal probe. Then, two years later, without even phoning home to tell his long-suffering wife ""the check's in the mail"", he shows up.

Well, sorta.

After a fairly complicated re-entry---you'll know what I'm talking about when I see it---Daddy Sam re-inserts himself in his estranged family's life. I mean, Hell, who can blame the Old Man: he just wants life to be like it was, back before he went on an unscheduled Extraterrestrial Magic Carpet Ride, back before Mommy got a whiny new boyfriend (who, frankly, merits instant destruction: look at it from Sam's viewpoint).

Back before Daddy was so dang seepy and goopy.

Anyway, Sam is back in the future, and before long starts working on building a real Family Nest Egg.

If you know what I mean.

Now: all sarcasm aside, ""XTRO"" is some pretty demented, outrageous, fairly nauseating filth. If I weren't the jaded, gore-crazed monster I am, I might even have found it fairly disturbing. Strike that: I *do* find it disturbing, especially the fate that descends on hot little Maryam D'Abo, a fate that shouldn't happen to a dog.

It's genuinely scary and creepily repulsive. Take that POV-shot of a car, headed down a dark, mist-shrouded, winding English road: what's that---is something hauling itself through the heather, crawling weakly towards the side of the road? What's that---my God, *that*, in the headlamps!

Or take the way Harry Bromley-Davenport upstages Japanese wildman Takashi Miike by about 20 years with his---umm, unexpected---alien re-entry method. And no, it doesn't involve a space capsule.

Or take the sustained, purposeful nastiness of XTRO: its relentless goopiness, its gleeful obsession with the seminal, the fluid, the fact that we human beings are an incredibly messy species, and the myriad ways in which a fiendish alien intelligence could take advantage of this to spread the spores, so to speak.

XTRO likes webbing. And things that spit. And bile, and pus, of course: and most of all slimy extrusions. Oh, and Eggs. Definitely Eggs.

Really, this should serve as warning: I can't get over just how unrelentingly disgusting XTRO is.

The extra features include an embarrassed interview with the director, Bromley-Davenport: it's evident that he felt he was meant for better things, and that he was slumming it with XTRO. Which is a pity, too: a glance at his subsequent career (from the IMDB) shows that he had it exactly backwards, and should have staked his ground deep in horror territory---if XTRO was achieved more by accident than by design, as Bromley-Davenport claims, then the man had a rare gift for horror.

At any rate, posterity has this marvellous little gem---erm, egg---to delight, repulse, confound, and horrify. It's actually scary, which can't be said about many flicks. And for those seriously deadbeat dads out there scraping bottom on excuses for not getting the child-support, it's inspirational!

Oh: and for anyone with a sensitive psyche, XTRO might very well blast your sanity.

676763,3,6303536026,"Earlier this week I watched a thoroughly disgusting movie called Slugs (1987)...and tonight I watched Xtro (1983), another sloppy charmer featuring some wildly visceral and repugnant imagery.  It's not that I mind the gross out stuff so much, but too much of it does create a strain on my gag reflex...oh well, don't weep for me, Argentina, as I follow the path, regardless of mucky entrails I may stumble over and slimy gristle I may slip on, in my perpetual endeavors in acquiring true, cinematic enlightenment.  Co-written and directed by Harry Bromley Davenport (Xtro II: The Second Encounter, Xtro 3: Watch the Skies), the film features Philip Sayer (Slayground), Bernice Stegers (Sky Bandits), Danny Brainin (""John and Yoko: A Love Story""), Simon Nash (Brazil), and former Bond girl Maryam d'Abo (The Living Daylights, Timelock), in her cinematic debut (hers and her `twins').

As this English production begins we see a cottage in the countryside, and a man playing with his son in the yard.  Shortly after the mother leaves, the skies turn dark, the wind picks up, strange lights appear overhead, and poof! the man is gone...fast forward three years...the boy, named Tony (Nash), who lives in the city with his mother Rachel (Stegers) and her boyfriend Joe (Brainin), still has nightmares about the event, one which no one believes happens, as the thought is his father, Sam (Sayer), just picked up and left, never to return.  Until now.  Once again some strange lights cruise the night, depositing something in the area where Sam disappears so long ago...something nasty.  The creature finds an unwilling participate in a bizarre mating ritual (an extraterrestrial shagfest), which results in one of the more repulsive scenes in the movie as Sam makes his grand entrance (if you've seen the movie, you know what I mean).  Sam then `arranges' a ride to the city for an awkward reunion of sorts with his family, bearing a gift for his son.  Tensions rise as Rachael doesn't know what to make of her supposedly amnesiac husband, and Joe distrusts him completely, thinking his intentions are to try and pick up where he left off.  Also, it seems Sam's picked up some strange habits since his return, like eating reptile eggs and purposely breathing gaseous vapors, along with giving his son a hickey you wouldn't believe...and then the killings start...a throat slash here, a bayoneting there...and what's the deal with the clown dwarf with the rubber hammer, seriously?  And let's not forget about Analise (d'Abo), the live-in housekeeper...I don't think her job description included being the `eggbearer'.  If I seem obtuse in my descriptions, it's intentional as to say much more would be to give away all the depraved, nasty little treats in store for those who choose to watch...

First of all, for much of the film I though Maryam d'Abo's character was named `Analease', like the lubricant,  as that's exactly how it sounded whenever someone said it (her character's actual name is `Analise').  While watching Xtro, the often bloody, surreal, and often absurd and warped imagery reminded me of something you might see in a David Cronenburg (Shivers, Rabid, Videodrome) film, the difference being where Cronenburg's movies tend to present underlying, thematic assessments of modern beliefs, Harry Bromley Davenport offers up none of that, but rather a superficial mixing of curious sci-fi and grotesque horror with no ulterior motive other than to entertain.  There is a structure within the story, but it's fairly fractured, even more so as the film progresses.  Despite this, things did work themselves out (for the most part), and after the film ended a good deal of it made sense, so I would suggest, if you are going to watch this feature, to just sit back for the ride and not focus too much on that which will never be understandable (who says everything has to make sense in a film anyway?).  The creepiest part of the movie for me was what happened to Maryam d'Abo's character, and her eventual role within the context of the story...a truly revolting fate, if you really think about it.  One of the things that really impressed me was the special effects, and their level of sophistication...no computer generated images here.  The humanoid grasshopper, the birthing scene, the implantation mechanism, the pulsating larva sacs, the creature near the end, all done very well and quite effective, in grotesque fashion.  I thought all the actors did pretty well, but I can't help wondering now what their thoughts were at the time they were making this movie, given its overall mondo weirdo nature.  Maryam d'Abo didn't have much of a part, but she's probably the most memorable particularly due to her willingness to appear nekkid...homina homina...all in all a creepy, low budget, decent production values film that wallows around in its own vulgarity, worth seeing if only to serve as a reminder that not all aliens eat Reese's Pieces and heal ouchies with glowing appendages.  If you have delicate sensibilities and a weak stomach, best stay away from this one.

The picture presentation on this DVD is in anamorphic widescreen (1.85:1), and looks decent enough, but it could have used a little cleaning up.  There are some noticeable elements on the picture, but nothing that stands out as major defects.  The Dolby Digital mono audio track comes though nicely, and I have no complaints.  There are some good extras, or `Xtras' (Get it?  Stop it, you're killing me...), including two alternate endings, an `Xtra' scene (sans audio), a featurette titled `Xtro Exposed' (17:21), which is a great interview with the director who's a really funny guy, a theatrical trailer, and an Xtro gallery.  The film was followed by two sequels, Xtro II: The Second Encounter (1990) and Xtro 3: Watch the Skies (1995), neither of which has much of anything to do with the original (I heard the second one, featuring Jan-Michael Vincent, is particularly craptastic).

Whew i didn't know what i was buying, because i had seen xtro 2 on tv the other day and was very interesting, so i decided to go hunt for the first on. Well there is a bunch of sex scenes, but they are really weird and don't fit in with the movie. The first scene was the kids dad gets abducted and then it plays the credits, those were the longest thing i have ever seen. The next scene shows a guy hit a thing in the road, he goes to see what it is and bam hes dead. then theres other weird disturbing stuff i don't want to tell. after the weird scene, the kid wakes up and he is drenched in blood, and blames it on daddy. Well, demented daddy comes back and finds out that another man is having an affair with his wife. So the two men don't get along the whole movie. I don't understand, what does a midget clown have to do with xtro, i don't know, the little kid has ""powers"" says daddy and the little kid makes a little acrobat dude thats about 2 inches long turn into a weird clown dude with a yo-yo that can slice you into bits.

<SPOILER>

The end is the best, daddy turns into and alien and kills the guy thats with his wife, and takes the little kid in a spacecraft. don't be fooled by the cover, the alien looks nothing like the alien on the cover, it looks like a deformed skull with crab claws and the best part is, he is a walking night light. after the ufo takes off, it shows the woman nurturing the eggs in what looks like cement, well there is a panther in the end scene which makes no sense.

Sounds fairly standard.  But when you have a woman give birth to a fully-formed man, Maryam D'abo getting turned into a cocoon, and a strange sequence involving clowns, you roam off the normal path.  The acting is good, and not just in the 'good-for-a-B-movie' way, and this probably helps things.  Plus, while the plot isn't much to speak of, the scenes manage to keep you interested anyway.  This can either be enjoyed as is, or in a 'so-weird-it's-good' way.

The re-birth scene was like a brainstorm in my mind and I feel the most strange situation of mind damage  in all my life.  Now, I want to see it again but at the same time I feel scared.  Its the most strange alien classic, but that's why you would never forget it.

676769,3,6303536026,"This is one of those movies (like the bargain-basement ""Carnival of Souls"" or the Japanese ""Attack of the Mushroom People"") which critics and audiences immediately write off, and yet the images and atmosphere seem to creep up in your psyche and stick with you for years. The concept: Daddy disappears, later returns a changed man, and everything falls apart. Sort of a wacky reinterpretation of the Judeo-Christian apocalypse, with Christ's return signalling the end of everything we know. The special effects are superb on this film, as evidenced in the rebirthing scene, but it is the unseen and implied which makes this film truly horrifying (what WAS that creature they ran into?). Philip Sayer is perfect as the quiet, transformed ""father"" of all the horror, and his performance is a large part of why the film is so disturbing. Maryam D'Abo adds little to the piece aside from her value as a sexual object (which she ultimately becomes in the film, in a horrific way). This film confounds our expectations, which all horror films should seek to do. Of course it is low-budget and low-brow, but that doesn't detract from its ability to frighten its audience. Years after I first saw it, this film still has the power to give me the creeps.",1053475200,15,1244,4.845070422535211

7849749,5,6303536026,"XTRO (Harry Bromley Davenport, 1983)
[originally posted 27Mar2000]

In the world of 1983, everyone was happily proclaiming that alien life would be warm and happy, and would like to eat Reese's Pieces and mashed potatoes. Ridley Scott? Who's he? We remember the little guy with the healing touch and some greys who like to play Simon with a really, really big board.

Harry Bromley Davenport singlehandedly brought the menace back into extraterrestrial life with XTRO, a low-budget British film from 1983. I saw it once, upon release, and it scarred me for life. Of course, I was fourteen at the time, and I have often wondered whether I was exaggerating the brilliance of this little gem in my head when placing it in a position of prominence on my 100-best list. Thanks to the wonders of ebay, a copy came my way last week, and Saturday morning I had a chance to sit down and relive the wonderful world of nasty, disgusting aliens who like to abduct people and do extremely tasteless things to those still on earth.

It hasn't lost a beat. Sam Phillips (Philip Sayer, best known--how depressing--for Shanghai Surprise; his career was cut short when he died in a car crash in 1991) is a family man abducted by aliens when only his son (Simon Nash, who only made two more motion pictures, Breakout and Brazil, before going on to a TV career in the nineties) is around to see. Of course, his wife (British TV mainstay Bernice Stegers) assumes he's gone off and left them... until he shows up again three years later. How he gets from his alien abductors back home is the first twenty minutes of the film, a marvel of proto-splatterpunk low-budget effects making that must be seen to be believed-- assuming your stomach can handle some of the nastier bits.

In a reversal of what Sam Raimi had done two years previous in his classic The Evil Dead, Davenport dispenses with the gore early on, for the most part, and spends the rest of the movie building suspense. It's a tricky way to do things, since if you set the audience up with a gorefest for half an hour and then work on atmosphere, what most of your audience will leave saying is ""good beginning, then it gets real slow."" Again, this movie isn't for everyone-- along with an appreciation of fuzzy horror [viz. The Ninth Gate review for a definition] (especially in the soundtrack), you have to have the stomach for some of the gorier scenes and an appetite for the surreal (Maryam d'Abo-- in her acting debut, by the way-- in the bathtub. If you've seen the movie, you know exactly what I'm talking about).

This is a movie that truly must be experienced to be believed-- and it's unforgettable, at least for seventeen years. My original ***** still stands.",1376179200,,2713,4.64375
7849750,1,6303536026,This has to be the worst movie ever for me. I won't even consider parts 2 and 3. I regret wasting my money but ill sell it at my summer garage sale.,1362096000,,148,3.65625
7849751,4,6303536026,"It was the summer of '94, when randomly skimming through my idiotic Leonard Maltin movie guide, I discovered an intriguing yet haphazardly produced film entitled Xtro. After reading Maltin's critique, I was still curious of the films content, regardless of Maltin's bad review. Despite all the hubbub, I finally sat down in my new pad and watched this so-called bad movie.

A quick opening scene zipped by, that of an Englishman Sam, played by Philip Sayer who's playing in the yard with his son Tony. Thereafter an Xtro, or alien, abducts Sam who then returns 3 years later as an alien. At this point Sam rapes a woman who then gives birth to a full grown man, the new and improved Sam. Monotony occurs when Sam return to his wife and the film dawdles in scenes where a midget clown turns Tony's nanny into an alien breeding machine.

As you can see Xtro has its good and bad moments. However, even if these scenes (i.e. the pregnancy scene) may seem revolting, they were done for a reason: Hint, the birth of the 2nd coming (ala the film Begotten). If the director Harry Bromly Davernport had eliminated these ingredients for ""family viewing"" (ala, Leonard Maltin) we'd have motel art. In short, a composition is not completed until it has its colors, and Xtro is filled with 'em. Xtro represents the security from fear, disturbance, and bigotry; in effect Nirvana. As you finish watching the film you'll understand why.

I deeply recommend Xtro for cult buffs who relish grade Z production. However, those repulsed by gore should stick with a Spielberg production.",1361923200,2,1567,4.796296296296297
