622551,1,6303316379,"I purchased this story as a part of Volume One from Babies R Us on DVD.  I thought it would be a very sweet DVD with new stories of Ariel for my 2 year old to watch as she loves the princesses. BUT, I found the Ariel story of Wish upon a starfish to be very frightening for a 2 yr old. The DVD did not have a rating on it (like G, PG, etc) and there was no description on the back explaining the story had monsters and frightening scenes of thunder storms in it. I feel it would have been better if the DVD had listed a short decription of the story on the back and a suggested age should have been printed as well. I would say this DVD is good for age 9 and up. But definitely not a toddler. I just wish I had enough information ahead of time and I would not have purchased this DVD. Especially since I can't return it now that it's open.",1131062400,3,839,3.877906976744186

7843229,5,6303316379,"The person with the 1 star review is incorrect! These episodes or series are NOT available on dvd. Also they are NOT scary. The actual Little Mermaid was scarier than all of these combined. And the person with the 1 star reviewisnot an Amazon verified purchase so I doubt this VHS is even what they purchased. It's sad that people are giving false reviews because I thought they were all awesome when I was a kid and my daughter loves them too.

These stories send great messages to our young kids. The princess Ariels Songs & Stories and also the Ariels Adventures series are both great short stories. Each VHS has a couple episodes. I would recommend them if anyone asked me what I thought. Quality classic Disney artwork, music and voices. These were also played on the Disney channel in the 90's and the VHS was a hot sale item back then too.",1444089600,,846,4.4935064935064934

7843232,4,6303316379,"My twin daughters (age 4 years old) love this video.  It contains 2 stories--""Wish Upon A Starfish"" and ""Metal Fish.""  Now if you're going to compare these with the full-length Little Mermaid movies then you will definitely be disappointed.  However, if you put into perspective that these short segments were created for a young audience (as opposed to ""for all ages"") then I think you'll find that they are very entertaining for young Ariel fans.",1153440000,4,448,4.946666666666666
