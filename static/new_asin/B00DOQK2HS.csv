5838800,5,B00DOQK2HS,"Outstanding musicians, outstanding performances. Anyone who is a fan of any of these guys is obligated to get this Blu ray!!!!!",1381190400,,127,5.095238095238095
5838801,3,B00DOQK2HS,"As a huge fan of Dream Theater, T. Mac, and Sheehan's separate careers this was a no brainer to buy.  The sound quality is great...and you can imagine how tight the band performs.  My only gripe is the constantly changing camera angles!  As a guitar player, I like to watch the pros play and hopefully learn a trick or two but the fast paced angle changes make it nearly impossible to get your eyes focused before it changes again.  Maybe it settles down towards the end of the set but I had a hard time watching the first half before shutting it down.  The sound is phenomenal on my 5.1 system but I just can't stand the fast angle changes which seems to be the norm these days.  :/",1381104000,,683,4.255813953488372
5838802,5,B00DOQK2HS,These guys keep it high paced and smoking hot. The technical prowess is top notch and the tunes are well selected and executed. For me MacAlpine is the star of the show with blazing solo runs and bruising chops. Highly recommended.,1380844800,,231,4.658536585365853
5838803,4,B00DOQK2HS,"Not much more to say then what I already said in the CD review.

I liked the stark stage setting.  Audio is top notch as is the visual.",1380672000,,135,3.7857142857142856
5838804,4,B00DOQK2HS,"I had the privilege to attend this show in Holland, when PSMS were just starting the tour. A great concert even if it was only their second gig in this line-up. Had high expectations for the blu-ray, which took ages to be released. Now it's finally here, and it presents a very good capture of a very good show. Unfortunately the audio mix is not up to standard. For an audiophile like me, that is a serious downer.",1380672000,,415,4.333333333333333
5838805,5,B00DOQK2HS,"This band and dvd are absolutely amazing!!!!!!!!!!!! Pourtnoy, Macalpine and Sheehan I have known of and listened to for years, Shennian, not so much, but WOW!!!!! If you are a true fan of music at all you MUST get this dvd. It will blow you away!!!!!!!!",1380326400,,254,4.543478260869565
5838806,3,B00DOQK2HS,"The project of this super group was meant to last a couple of shows, but with the public request, the band decided to did a full tour without their own technicians and crew. The band is comfortable playing together on this night. The level of musicianship is high and not too many notes are left out. The music is a celebration of songs played in the past from all the members involved. All songs are instrumental, except ""Shy Boy"", a strait forward rock song. The Japan audience was expecting a demonstration of some impressive technique on how to play guitar, bass, keyboards and drums,at a fast pace and that's what they got.

The overall sound of the music is similar to Planet-X, obviously because of the presence of Derek Sherinian and Tony Macalpine. The camera work is quick following the pace of the music with many close shots that place you in the stage with the musicians. The picture in high definition doesn't disappoint. As far as the sound mix in HD-Master, it's mostly for ambiance, but prepare to jump out of your seat in one occasion.

While i have enjoyed the Blu-Ray, i don't think i would listen anymore to this kind of music in my audio system very much in the future, but those who are following Planet-X and the projects of Macalpine and Sheehan, will not want to miss this concert.",1379548800,7,1307,4.581196581196581
5838807,4,B00DOQK2HS,"Really awesome show except for the fast moving camera work, these guys are so great that the camera should halt and stay on them and move a little bit like i'm standing there, picture and sound awesome thank you",1379116800,,211,4.435897435897436
5838808,5,B00DOQK2HS,"if you follow any of the musicians on this dvd then you are aware of the monster talent each musician has.
From pounding drum work to outstanding bass lines to the haunting keyboard work and out of this world guitar playing that is the supergroup Portnoy,sheehan,macalphine and sherinian.
Outstanding.
The dvd is nicely packaged but the stage lighting is pretty simple beyond that you will need to hang on to your instruments as the elite take you on a hurricane of their best tunes from their respected bands and display the reason they are a power house.
Enjoy",1378857600,4,562,4.744897959183674
5838809,5,B00DOQK2HS,"Let me say I'm a huge fan of all of these musicians. I've followed them all for years in all of their various projects/solo careers. So naturally I'd jump at this DVD. Let me say, it doesn't disappoint. I was intrigued to see how Tony would handle the guitar parts for the DT/LTE songs. He definitely held his own, interjecting his own style, giving these songs I've heard countless times a new twist. The only problem I had is with the first audio track cutting out part way. Switch to the higher DTS audio and all was cured.",1378684800,2,526,4.377551020408164
5838810,4,B00DOQK2HS,Recommended!,1429488000,,12,12.0
5838811,5,B00DOQK2HS,This is an excellent concert of some very tight playing by some the best musicians in their instruments. I learned of Sheehan and MacAlpine whom I never identified before. I am always glad to see talent I wasn't aware of before.,1429401600,,228,4.585365853658536
5838812,5,B00DOQK2HS,"These guys are amazing musicians.  This is a great display of talent.  The part of Sherinian's solo where he plays Eruption on the keyboard is worth the price of the dvd alone.  Buy this and be impressed, very impressed.",1427241600,,220,4.589743589743589
5838813,3,B00DOQK2HS,"I will agree with many reviews regarding the musicianship and talent on display - absolutely 5 stars. The guys are in great form and the music is fantastic. But I also have to agree with another reveiwer concerning the ridiculous amount of camera cuts. I haven't had a drop to drink today, but halfway through this show I feel hung over and dizzy, and slightly nauseous. WHY do these idiot editors have to change camera angles every 1-2 seconds. They destroyed a Joe Satriani concert (either SF or Montreal, I can't remember now) doing the same thing. You get absolutely no feel for any ONE of the musicians, rather a blurred mess of all 4 of them every 1 or 2 seconds. I don't recommend buying this - get the CD instead.",1425686400,8,721,4.46969696969697

5838824,5,B00DOQK2HS,"What can be said about 4 of some of the greatest world's musicians coming together for an astounding, jaw-dropping performance that is guaranteed to keep you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. Of course, you must have some knowledge and appreciation for exquisite, top quality musicianship.  Mr. Portnoy always manages to round up the best of the best. These guys certainly have a special chemistry, and this is an amazing DVD that captures it well! I highly recommend this for progressive music appreciaters everywhere. You will not be disappointed!",1398470400,,563,5.053763440860215
5838825,4,B00DOQK2HS,"To much Guitar wizardry for me. The musicianship is unbelievable, but I could not listen to the whole thing. This is more for the technical guitar person, than for the fan of these guys. If you like fast Beethoven type stuff you will like this.",1398297600,,244,4.444444444444445
5838826,5,B00DOQK2HS,"Always liked Dreamtheater but now have a greater appreciation for MacAlpine and Sheehan. I dare you to double bass any faster than Portnoy. The audio on this dvd is great. Take note that Simon Phillips mixed this show. The first song is way over the top with spasmodic camera shots but settles down a bit for the rest. Only singing was on Sheehan's ""Shy Boy"". Catch the Winery Dogs for more vocals with Portnoy, Sheehan and Kotzen.",1394755200,,431,4.6103896103896105
5838827,3,B00DOQK2HS,"Supergroup Portnoy,sheehan,macalphine and sherinian. they're all insane , more then an hour playing great music until the last song you will not disappointed .
Only one thing about this DVD not sure mine was defective or their recording this way, on DTS HD sound was not working right. The surround sound was so poor.  I only play the 2 channel stereo on my audio system. Other wise this blue ray will get the 5 star rating !",1394668800,,425,4.51948051948052
5838828,5,B00DOQK2HS,"I really enjoyed this, more than I expected.  It's the kind of performance which makes you want to go back and watch it again soon after you finish it.

The band and audience are enthusiastic (though Tony could engage with the audience more and smile now and then), great musicianship across board, good chemistry among the band members, good sound quality, and nice variety of songs.

Highly recommended for fans of any of these musicians or their style of music.",1393200000,,464,4.775
5838829,5,B00DOQK2HS,Fantastic musicians with a fantastic show. A must dvd if you appreciate great musicians playing incredible music in a live setting!,1392595200,,131,5.285714285714286
5838830,4,B00DOQK2HS,"this is a fantastic dvd..these guys are awesome..i only knocked a star off because of the constant camera switching..
as soon as the eye can focus on what tony macalpine is playing the camera switches to another view..very annoying,,,,but the music totally makes up for it.virtuosity at it's best..(video producers take note:we are musicans that watch these videos and really want to watch what the guitar,drummer etc.is doing...the constant camera antics is very disturbing at times,,,i would suggest adding a menu item that allows the viewer to pick the guy they want to see in an isolated view)
progressive metal rules!!!!",1388793600,9,625,5.198019801980198
5838831,5,B00DOQK2HS,Saw the show in Bucharest and want to put it on my collection to remind me of it. Thank you !,1387584000,,93,3.4761904761904763
5838832,4,B00DOQK2HS,"This DVD features four great musicians playing music from their own carrer (and some covers) Tony MacAlpine is, in my opinion, one of the most underrated guitar players alive, and I think this DVD may help to show his endless qualities to a lot of people that doesn't know him. Billy Sheehan is probably the greatest rock bassist in the world, and so is Mike Portnoy, who seems to be enjoying a lot to play some of the Dream Theater/LTE songs. Derek is also great in the show. It would be great to listening to some new compositions from these marvelous musicians.",1384387200,4,564,4.53921568627451
5838833,4,B00DOQK2HS,4 stars cause some of the songs listed on the bluray case are not shown on the video. Very misleading. MacAlpine  sounds pretty damn good on here. Portnoy and Sheehan sound great as usual and Sherinian is a very good keyboardist too.,1384214400,,233,4.5476190476190474
5838834,5,B00DOQK2HS,"This is an amazing example of great musicians playing great music.  I was stunned to see some of these technical masterpieces played to perfection by guys who have played together for a minute, Amazing!!!",1383436800,3,204,5.0
5838835,4,B00DOQK2HS,"TO BE EXPECTED, THE TALENT WAS THERE. I THOUGHT THE AUDIO COULD HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE
IN DTS-6.1 SURROUND, BUT I GUESS THAT'S ASKING FOR TOO MUCH. I REALLY MISS MIKE PLAYING WITH
DREAM THEATER, BUT I LIKE THE CHEMISTRY HE HAS WITH THESE GUYS. OVERALL THIS IS A GOOD BUY FOR
THE FANS OF GOOD TALENT ON LIVE THE LIVE STAGE.",1382659200,,319,4.245901639344262
5838836,5,B00DOQK2HS,"If you are here looking at this concert to purchase then you already know who the cast of characters is. This blu-ray is totally insane. All virtuosos and the talent comes through in force. Billy's solo is just flat out insane........heck, they're ALL insane. In fact, why are you even reading this......just go buy the disc and be insanely amazed!",1382400000,6,348,4.816666666666666

8595465,5,B00DOQK2HS,"The edits are not as bad as some have suggested. Then again, I saw the KISS dvd, Kiss Symphony: Alive IV, and the edits are so fast they would literally give some people who are susceptible, an actual seizure.

The music here is stellar! I played the first two songs for a friend who doesn't like this type of rock, and said, ""Watch their hands and fingers,"" and she was suddenly impressed as all get up!

If you don't own this, then you NEED to own this. They're all great, but it reminded of just why Tony MacAlpine is my favorite guitar player!",1492646400,,547,4.300970873786408

8595467,5,B00DOQK2HS,"An AWESOME presentation involving 4 of the finest musicians in the world (a very short list). An absolute stimulation of the senses. If you are a musician, these 4 guys are the standard by which any musician would strive to be.",1481846400,,227,4.560975609756097

8595470,5,B00DOQK2HS,"This blu ray has excellent picture and sound, especially for a live concert. I am a huge Dream Theater fan, and miss Portnoy, but this was a great group to see him in doing everything from Dream Theater stuff to Derek Sherinian's songs (Ex- Dream Theater keyboardist as well, whom I greatly respected as I do Rudess). They play a few songs from each of the artists own collection, making a very interesting, eclectic mix. High energy, superior musicianship as one would expect. and an overall fun, loose performance. One technical issue, this is NOT DTS-HD MA as the case and online will tell you, it is the slightly lower bit rate DTS Hi Res (which is still far superior to Dolby Digital and regular DTS). On my Marantz SR8002 receiver it shows up the correct layer being played. But overall I wasn't expecting much getting this blu ray, just nostalgia from Portnoy, and I ended up sitting through the WHOLE blu ray concert. which is rare for me to with any band. Must have for the great price!!!!",1445644800,,998,4.581005586592179
