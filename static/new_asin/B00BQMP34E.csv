8572727,4,B00BQMP34E,"I have been a fan of the Ton of Fun since first seeing them when they appeared on television in the ""Old Time Movie"" segment of the original ""Howdy Doody Show' back in the late 1940's. Their humor is certainly ""politically incorrect"" these days and is not usually found on other silent comedy collections. When I saw this Alpha Video set I had mixed emotions. Alpha does a good job locating forgotten films but apparently does nothing to try to restore them.  Still, with films as rare as these I was willing to take a chance. It turned out to be a good one.  The eight films in this set are in reasonable condition considering they are approaching 90 years old. Only one film ""Tailoring"" seems to have been taken from a dupe print. The titles for the other seven show some wear but when the action starts the picture quality improved.  Another feather I really appreciate is most of these films still have their original opening credits.  There was only one reason for not giving the set five stars.  The Amazon description and Alpha's description state the film ""Two Wise Goofs"" is on this set.  It is not.  Instead the film ""3 of a Kind"" takes its place.

To sum it up,  This is a good collection of the work of an almost forgotten studio and three talented silent comics who deserve more acclaim. Based on how well they did with this set, if Alpha produces another set with The Ton of Fun  I'll be adding it to my DVD collection.",1416009600,4,1433,4.435114503816794
8572728,4,B00BQMP34E,"Meet Fatty Alexander, ""Fat"" Karr and Kewpie Ross, all 950lbs+.  No chair or model-T is safe from collapse when they have a seat.  In between scenes of their sheer girth cutting a path of destruction, you'll marvel at their combined appetites and their colossal  incompetence in just about any pursuit.  They're cute, they're rolly-polly,  they often roll down inclines, they cause a crater when they land.  As an original act, they are worth their weight in gold and thankfully their performances are preserved, albeit in some pretty scratch-filled, though mostly watchable prints.  Guess we're lucky these films are not among the many lost silents.  A few of the shorts are outstanding, certainly original with the plus-sized cast, the rest at least average....and well worth a look at the modest price.  These guys could really turn a viewer into a fan of  the whole realm of silent comedy.  Oh, and the musical accompaniment is not bad; mostly ragtime-style piano...not wretched organ music as I've endured with other silent films.",1388707200,3,1034,5.095238095238095
