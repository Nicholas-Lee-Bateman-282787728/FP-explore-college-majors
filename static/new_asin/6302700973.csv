7830511,4,6302700973,"This is a remake of Night and the City (1950) directed by Jules Dissan, who was blacklisted by Hollywood because of actions by the House Un-American Activities Committee, and for that reason is dedicated to Dissan who had to continue his career in Europe.  The original film starred Richard Widmark, Gene Tierney, Francis L. Sullivan and Herbert Lom.  I haven't seen that film, but I understand that it is very good.

This film from 1992 is not bad; however for some reason its reputation isn't much.  The voters at IMDb give it a rather tepid 5.7 stars out of 10 while giving the original 8 out of 10.  I'm not sure why, but I think it has to do with:

(1) Robert De Niro playing a non-heroic character. It certainly doesn't have anything to do with his acting.  He is outstanding as Harry Fabian, flimflam low life lawyer and cheap BS artist who tries desperately to make a big splash as a fight promoter.  I think most De Niro fans would prefer to see him in a more two-fisted role.  At any rate, those who didn't like the movie almost certainly didn't care for De Niro's performance since his character dominates the action.

(2) The ending, which some might see as unfinished and others as disagreeable since, regardless of what transpires, Fabian is still a loser, perhaps bigger than ever.

(3) Some rather cheesy plot play.  Near the end Fabian and Helen (Jessica Lange looking as fetching as ever) hide in a dead end alley among dumpsters and trash cans.  Well, they should have continued running since the guys after them were only walking.  Also when Fabian and Helen run out the side door of the restaurant they go the wrong way so that the heavies can see them running across the street.  Had they turned left instead of right (as anybody in their situation would have done) they would not even have been seen.  Furthermore, Fabian in a flamboyant gesture throws $12,000 into the air that flutters to the ground in the dead end alley.  Nobody bothers to pick it up.  That could happen.

What cannot be faulted is the authentic New York atmosphere created by director Irvin Winkler, who is better know as a producer, most notably of the Sylvester Stallone ""Rocky"" films, and the fine work by the rest of the cast, especially Alan King (Ira ""Boom Boom"" Grossman), Eli Wallach (Peck), Cliff Gorman (Phil Nasseros), and Jack Warden (Al Grossman).  The story itself, from a novel by Gerald Kersh (script by Richard Price), is a variation on the ""lovable, colorful loser makes good"" theme, only in this case, like an inept noir anti-hero, he falls on his face--more than once, by the way.

No real De Niro fan should miss this.  Personally I thought it was one of his best performances.  The rapid fire dialogue, the fawning, pathetic, yet somehow uplifting personality were not something most actors could pull off, at least not nearly as well.  De Niro became the character he portrayed.

Bottom line: definitely worth seeing.  You will not be bored.",1165622400,,2959,4.67504835589942
7830512,3,6302700973,"As the title of this review suggests that NIGHT AND THE CITY  is kinda like BROADWAY DANNY ROSE MEETS RUPPERT PUPKIN; or JOHNNY from MEAN STREETS if he was a shmuck lawyer instead of Pure Anarchy. I'm big fans of Cliff Gorman and Alan King. And JESSICA LANGE will always be a Hollywood goddess to me. It's just an old-fashioned gangster melodrama of the type Warner Brothers put out in the 1930s and 1940. DeNiro was in the John Garfield role, and Jessica Lange was in the Ann Sheridan role. Cliff Gorman was played by George Raft, or Bogart. And Alan King was played by E.G. Robinson.  Jack Warden was played by Alan Jenkins. He loses his mind before the big fight and dies of a heart attack. NIGHT AND THE CITY is a tribute to the old fashioned classic gangster films.",1156464000,,770,4.415492957746479
7830513,2,6302700973,"Gerard Butler fans, don't rush out to buy this one. He is not in it. It's a glitch on the part of Amazon. If you did buy it and are still looking at the extras in an attempt to find him, just relax and forget it.  Eat popcorn.  This one is a pale copy of a 1940s film with Richard Widmark that you may like much, much better.  Widmark could have menaced snarly rings around ol' 'You talkin' to me?'",1138838400,11,398,3.95
7830514,3,6302700973,"""Night And The City"" is not a great drama, neither a great comedy, but it is an entertaining and funny movie. Robert De Niro is Harry Fabian, a loser who tries to put his hands in more things that he can really manage, and Jessica Lange is Helen Nasseros, Harry's love interest, despite she is a married woman.
As the story unfolds, there will be several tragedies in the path of our two antiheroes, all these tragedies are a combination of drama, farce and comedy. Definitely, ""Night And The City"" is not a classic, but it is a funny movie, recommendable for all the fans of the great Robert De Niro that are trying to see the entire Robert De Niro catalogue (like myself). At the end of the day this is an entertaining movie.",1069372800,,727,4.392592592592592
7830515,3,6302700973,"This version of Night and the City is a good movie mainly because of the performaces by Robert DeNiro and Jessica Lange. The direction is average. However, I give a more generous opinion if I hadn't seen the original 1950  version directed by the great Jules Dassin, and starring Richard Widmark  and Gene Tierney.  The 1950 version is a masterpiece, to say the least, and  is one of the greatest film noirs ever made.  Although the 1950 version is  a masterpiece, It is nearly impossible to find a copy for sale anywhere.  IF BY A MIRACLE SOMEONE OR ANYONE ANYWHERE HAS ANY INFO. ON WHERE I CAN  PURCHASE A COPY OF THE 1950 NIGHT AND THE CITY, I WOULD BE FOREVER  APPRECIATIVE!",954028800,,678,4.491803278688525

I  love films where there are no true heroes or villains.  This is definitely  one.  The good guys aren't always good and the bad guy have certain  virtues.
The film is very funny especially Alan King as a rather  ruthless promoter himself.  But the film is ultimately about the struggle  within oneself to break destructive patterns, take risks, and rise above  present circumstances and all of the obstacles encountered both without and  within.
Not a classic but definitely worth viewing.",950745600,,708,5.017241379310345
7830517,3,6302700973,"This movie could've been great except for the plot being so predictable.  You know everything's destined to fail from the get-go but still, it's very entertaining due to the dynamic stars and the basic setup.  DeNiro is very  funny here and even the cameos (the one with Regis is amusing) are mixed in  well.  A real New York story that can't help being depressing but one of my  favorites.  Just can't rate it better because it doesn't have any  surprises.",935539200,,457,4.625
