290594,5,6300270424,"If you were fortunate enough to be born during the reign of Led Zeppelin, I praise you, especially if you saw them live.  I was not fortunate enough and that is where this video comes in.  To hear Robert Plant's vocal  dynamics, Jimmy Page's electric guitar make Hendrix look like a rookie, Jon  Bonham's drumming a work of art, and John Paul Jones's work on keyboards  exceptional.  There is only band in the world where each band member was so  superior in his forte... that group is LED ZEPPELIN.",912902400,,499,4.53932584269663

It has a bunch of live performances from Madison Square Garden and some revealing segments about all four band members. Also, Bonzo has a great 12 minute  rendition of ""Moby Dick."" If you're a music or Led Zeppelin  lover, this is a must see film. The only minus of this film is the  backstage language, its pretty graphic.",911952000,,386,4.408450704225352

290767,5,6300270424,"great restoration,
 the picture is crisp,
 the sound is too
That bulge in Robert's trousers, comes out at you from the blue!
I had this on VHS & since I'm a big advocate for scrimping 'n saving  I've been viewing this from tape since I first bought my first copy, the ol' VCR is failing so I'm upgrading my library to DVDs & BluRay.
I know that this was definitely NOT captured in HI-DEF, so I'm not going to bother with the extra charge most retailers charge simply because it's burned onto Blu Ray,  normal DVD is just fine for me.
There's extras on this 2-disc package TOO,  it is well worth upgrading.
OR, if you're a younger fan of Led Zeppelin DO NOT hesitate,  pick this up and learn what REAL rock & roll is.  Many disrespect 'Zep. for ""ripping off"" some of the originators of delta/Pure blues music but I cannot & will NOT agree, just as [many other bands, guitarists,  acts] did, they HEARD the music & added their OWN style.  I sincerely hope all that purchase this package,  whichever format, really enjoy ""The Song Remains The Same"" as much as I do.

290802,5,6300270424,Works beautifully. I mean it's an old VHS so I wasn't expecting much but what i got is amazing. And its different to see the film in a full screen 4:3 format. More on the top and bottom but less on the sides compared to the dvd/blu ray which is widescreen 16:9. More on the sides bit less on the top and bottom. Interesting. And it seems like the vhs has a slightly different audio track from the original dvd release...not the remastered one from 2007 im aware its slightly different haha,1501977600,,489,4.326086956521739

290806,1,6300270424,"For now I gave 2 stars because it was a disappointment that after waiting for almost a month until it was delivered I rushed to open it to see my new BR and looks through a book or booklet. After unwrapping a plastic I opened the box of a disc... something hit me: I didn't feel the resistance of a adhesive seal because it wasn't there. Neither I found any book inside. Becoming suspicious about quality and who made it.
Haven't watched it yet. Will update after I do.
Unfortunately the disappointment continues: a ""Blu-ray"", to be called, has video quality of DVD in the beginning of its era. Disc menu provides access to extra features but no audio selection option could be found. That thing limits you to preselected audio mode which doesn't sound as good as it would be expected with ""Dolby TrueHD 5.1""
 The movie/concert/documentary  seems to be OK.
I guess, - you get what you pay for. I'd like ""amazon"" to have better description on the item they sell or check the quality of the product. You can't sell DVD when you say it is a Blu-ray in blu-ray box and no seal.
Although I like Led Zeppelin I will be returning it unless Amazon can provide the real Blu-ray quality disc in exchange.

Unfortunately Amazon could not promise that the replacement will be with better quality. They issued a refund on the item without returning it.

Well... there is some of that here, along with a heavy helping of mid 70's cheese (weird montages and a dumb gangster intro).  As for the concert itself, there was far too much drum solo, guitar solo, jam session type stuff that I have always felt are mainly popular with people that are high.

So, it's okay, but if had been able to preview it first or read this review I would have left it unpurchased.",1482105600,,571,4.117117117117117

The movie recorded to history a powerful band at the peak of its powers. It is not only concert footage, there are some bizarre filming around, that I personally thinks distracts the viewer from what it matters: the live performance.

Anyway,the quality here is very good, both sound and image.

The remainder of the music comes from Led Zeppelin I ""Dazed and Confused "", Led Zeppelin I I ""Whole Lotta Love"", and of course Led Zeppelin IV ""Stairway To Heaven."" The only downside are the cutaways. Each of the band members is recorded doing the things that they would like to be remembered for. For example, in John Bonham's cutaway he is seen as a race car driver and actually races a dragster  on a track. I gave it five stars in spite of the cutaways. This film is a piece of rock history and if you have never seen Led Zeppelin in concert then I highly recommend this video.",1459209600,22,932,4.38728323699422

291202,5,6300270424,"An incredible music video that lets you see what the band really can do way beyond their studio work.  The lead guitar work by Jimmy Page is especially incredible.  Not only is he an incredible creative talent,  his endurance is unbelievable.  It's a shame he wasn't given more leeway on the studio albums as his true talent was rarely presented except at live shows.  The remarkable speed and power of John Bonham is also well displayed.  There was at least one time where I thought that they may have sped up the audio his speed was so amazing.  The off stage video  leaves much to be desired but with the exception of Peter Grant needlessly screaming at one of the local promoters it is moderately interesting.",1455753600,4,713,4.603174603174603

Then I learned they didn't get good footage in MSG and had to recreate the stage setup and re-film in England months later.  So it's a bit of a slight of hand and you'll see costume changes between cuts and all sorts of problems.  But I still like it warts and all and used the film many times to see how parts were played in the days before youtube.

291250,3,6300270424,"Even though John Bonham is considered a great drummer Led Zeppelin could have used 100 other just as talented drummers and been just as successful. Absolute perfection in rock blues drumming is Ginger Baker without equal, now that I have that off my mind the Movie The song remains the same is truly not well done and on par with the sub-par creativity that Bonham was. His most remarkable thing he ever did was ruin the best blues rock band of all time by killing himself drunk chocking on his own vomit AKA Jim Morrison, Elvis Presley and Jimi Hendricks. A symptom of an overzealous ego. Though the last three names contributed hugely to rock and roll Bonham got lucky hooking up with JPJ and then Page and Plant. The music in the movie is straight off their albums so no creative usage of a great opportunity to be wizards. Why they ever did this ganster 20's style gig is puzzling but then I have to remember it was written by a drunk who didn't know what love was.

Once word of this got out, Plant and Branson both went on record denying the deal.  My belief is that LZ was holding out for a billion pounds, and Branson blinked.

If grainy, shaky YouTube vids disappoint you, then buy and watch TSRTS.  You will not be disappointed.  Well, only a little disappointed, that LZ declined the 500 mil.

291552,5,6300270424,I was at the 1973 Madison Square Garden Saturday night performance of this movie.  My friend Ken and I snuck in our tape recorders and had this movie concert before the actual release.  3 hours of Led Zeppelin just blew my mind. I played the tapes endlessly until the cassette tape broke. Still ranks as the best concert ever. I also remember the tapes being played in the parking garages leaving the Garden. Really fun!!!!!,1424131200,,424,4.64

291570,5,6300270424,I have been a Led Zeppelin fan since I first heard their music. my dad used to not change the radio station when Stairway To Heaven was playing while we were in the car visiting family. He did not like there music but would let me listen to one of their songs before he changed to another station.....now thats what I call a great dad. I was 11 when Zeppelin released their 4th album and I am still a fan today 44 years later and their music still packs a wallop. I remember when this movie came out I lived in south Chicago on 84th street and rode my bicycle to 95th and Cicero to the Coral Theater and they had huge speakers to the left and right or the movie screen and some more behind the last row of seats. Jimmy Page said this was not their best. well if this is not their best live performance I would like to get my hands on the one that is better than this. I felt like I was at a Zeppelin concert when I saw this. Jimmy Page really jams here and this is the best Bonham has sounded. I have seen this more than 20 times and It gets better with age always remember to play it loud it sounds better no matter what you play it on.,1422576000,,1137,3.96943231441048

291574,3,6300270424,"I'm about the same age as the surviving members of LZ and take a back seat to few in my appreciation of their music.  So I was very disappointed after watching this concert film on Blu ray.  Let's get one thing out of the way up front.  There is no problem with the performance of the band.  The concert was shot at Madison Square Garden in late July, 1973 over 3 nights.  The band was still in their 20's and at the height of their popularity.  So from a historical perspective, the film is worth seeing.

The ""film"" itself is a mess.  Even the surviving band members have suggested as much.  The disc starts off right away (no menu comes up to select audio, etc.) and features a 5 minute video of band and tour managers, Peter Grant and Richard Cole dressed up like 20's era gangsters mowing down a room of strangers with automatic weapons.  I thought I had gotten the wrong disc.  In any case it is all stupid as are most of the other fantasy sequences that permeate the movie.  I suspect that they didn't really have enough stage footage for a 2 hour movie so extended these sequences which were likely planned.  There are a couple that break away from Jimmy Page's blistering guitar work, to watch him climb a rock.  Please.  Even the closing credits, which features the studio version of ""Stairway to Heaven,"" continues to play to conclusion even though the credits had ended minutes earlier.  Basically staring at a blank screen.  OK, yeah, that's a quibble.

The Blu ray video is acceptable, better than the DVD but hardly great.  The video resolution is 1080p with a 1.78:1 aspect ratio (vs. the original film 1.85:1).  The original film doesn't appear to have much digital manipulation.  Grain, blemishes and other artifacts are seen throughout.  The sometimes amateur-looking camera work can be annoying and ideal lighting is rarely evident.  At the same time, some of the detail is very good.  Sweat, spit and Robert Plant's below the belt ""package"" are clearly visible.

The audio includes a Dolby TrueHD 5.1 track, a Dolby Digital 5.1 and a Dolby 2.0 stereo option as well.  For the most part I listened to the TrueHD.  It is very good especially in the upper and midrange which is where Plant voice and Page's guitar reside.  The lower end which should handle the John Paul Jones' bass and John Bonham's kick drum are severely lacking to my ears.  What you do hear from the lower end comes in a forward sounding mix (by Page).  I basically got nothing that moved my subs.  I tried this in 3 different setups including a 2 channel mix and got nothing.  Don't get me wrong, the musicians are great and the overall sound may be better than what you've got already, but my old vinyl records blow this disc away from an audio perspective.

There are a host of subtitle options on the disc, too many to list here.  Options include 4 songs omitted from the film, a news report of the mysterious $200K safety deposit box theft, a BBC interview with Plant and more.",1421712000,3,2971,4.553875236294896

291611,5,6300270424,"This is, quite possibly, the best docu-rock concert film ever made!  Led Zeppelin was the quintessential rock band during a magical era when bands actually had great talent, and room for originality and experimentation (60's thru 80's, arguably the best era for pop/rock/R&B, etc.).  Radio stations would play 10 minute long epic rock songs, or even whole album sides, and up and coming or successful artists were given free reign to compose and record pretty much whatever they wanted to.  Creativity was at an all time high.  The Blu-ray quality of this video is a noticeable improvement over my regular DVD, played on my Samsung plasma HDTV.  This release is a 'must' in anybody's rock video collection!",1418428800,,706,5.0
291612,5,6300270424,"I reckon everyone should have a copy of this in their collection. I first ordered this on VHS at horrific import price of $45. Now you can get the super duper collectors edition on DVD for under $15 - how times have changed in the last 20 years. I can't count the times I'd watched to VHS version. At the time it was a pinnacle of what to aspire to in performance. And while their performance (and any) was not perfect it documents and exceptional point in their career.
While it would be great to turn off the fictional film included it is nonetheless part of it. However in the extended DVD version they've included extra performances which are well worth it and a bonus.
Personal favorites would have to be Dazed and Confused (even though I'm not a huge fan of the song itself - but because of the included film footage and of course Jimmy's playing on this live version - those mean riff's) and Whole Lotta Love (With the improve - this shows off Jimmy's improve - awesome). And of course Jimmy bringing out the double neck - always special. Is there a need? Probably not - but cool nonetheless. Yes and this is why I have a double neck nearly the same in the jamming room for 20 years.
If you're a Led Zeppelin fan, you've most likely got it, If you don't you need this. It shows the excess, the musicianship, the extravagance that was the period and the legend that is Led Zeppelin.
I've picked up that many riff's to rip off it's not funny. For aspiring guitar players you need it. The other DVD is The Who - The Kids Are Alright. Get these two and you're on your way musically and mentally.",1418428800,,1598,4.33

291806,5,6300270424,"This review is for the Blu-Ray release specifically.
As a Led Zeppelin NUT, since I was a child, I have collected Led Zeppelin Live Concerts.
I was too young to see them live, just barely. Just as i was becoming aware of them, John Bonham Died.
I remember paying exorbitant amounts of money for a factory VHS of this film.
I never imagined I would have the option of Lossless HD audio and 1080p Blu-Ray Video.
This is an essential release and while at the time it may have seemed cheesy, it is now considered Classic!
The multiple audio tracks (5.1, 2.0, and Losless Hd 5.1) are all excellent,  the Bonus tracks are worth getting for this alone.
I just wish these tracks would be re-cut into the film presentation, just for the sake of accuracy, and the fact that the songs omitted are arguably better songs than those included. They are Celebration Day, Over the hills and far away, Misty Mountain Hop, and The Ocean (including John Bonham's great intro) You also get some great vintage TV spots.
There is also a deluxe 2 DVD version of this for those who wish to own the remastered version on DVD, but I personally recommend the Blu ray. Everything is exceptionally sharp, with no digital enhancement apparent. The Colors on the Blu-Ray are saturated and gorgeous, just beautiful. Its also 16X9 aspect ratio, perfect for all new widescreen TV's. It is a MUST for Zeppelin Fans or anyone who wants to know more about the Zep. I think critics of the fantasy sequences sometimes missed the point, which is that this is a musical presentation, and as such, the visuals are there to compliment the music. If you have a killer Stereo, and a wide screen hi def system, you would be denying yourself not to purchase this Blu Ray.",1405036800,5,1723,4.576051779935275

The revenge upon the thieves, who stole LZ's money during their tour in NY, was pretty funny. Viewer gets to see press releases, interviews regarding the stolen money. Jimmy did a nice job with Moby Dick: lots of great footage of John Bonham (drummer) - nice dedication to John's memory. Every time I hear the song played, I now think of the rare video footage. LZ's Madison Square Gardens performance in 1973 is great. Money well spent.:)",1402963200,,580,4.481132075471698

The film was entirely financed by the band and shot on 35mm with a 24-track quadraphonic sound recording.

The remastering is very well done. The sound and video quality is as good as I think you can get it. For those who haven't seen it yet, this is a mixture of live concerts from the tour in 1973 with some occasional (often strange) video sequences of the individual band members acting out scenes, playing with their families, rescuing medieval damsels, or racing hot rods.

292048,5,6300270424,"This movie & soundtrack amazes me anew each time: like a companion to the 4th album. But it's not for critics or rock fans who LIKE LedZep: it's for people who either LOVE Zeppelin, or at least LOVE some thing for its precious charm & mystique. Like many reviewers, I too dismiss all negative reviews by bozos, wiseasses, & middleminds. If one isn't trying to be cute picking it apart, one is open to a very rewarding piece of Zep art: only a fool critcizes Zeppelin for underachieving at what ONLY Zeppelin could imagine. Zep was always about rock magically elevating life to higher state, so complaints about ""authenticity"" are puny nitpicks for puny minds. Symbolically, the fantasy sequences make alot people uncomfortable so they resort to labeling them as cheesy: again, this is ignorant, like trying to win a poker game with a Tarot deck.  It's not cinema or tv, it's a rock fantasy home movie, not edited for an Oscar; just personal dream sequences about Inner Courage, staged for 70's celluloid.
No matter how many people get used to Zeppelin, the Wonder of Zeppelin is also their Message. Zeppelin is the opposite of habitually measuring with known parameters. Losers posing as historians often take points off from the Heartbreaker solo for execution: as if there were other electric guitar solo breaks to compare then!  Likewise, if someone can show me a more coherent movie that punctuates an arena show with euphoric medieval fans & fantasies, and the urgency of hot rods, motorcycle cops, & rowdy fans made BEFORE this movie- then I'll be willing to admit shortcomings. While you're at it; WHO PLAYED KASHMIR BETTER BEFORE LZ?
 As great as Zep sounds in studio, most of these performances EXCEL or in different ways MATCH what made the studio versions interesting. Many hard rock fans don't appreciate how Jimmy Page's sound is cleaner: outgrowing his early vision of sustaining fuzz, here Page is reacting to his guitars'  precious woody tone with wonder & subtlety rather than executing wellrehearsed pyrotechnics for show. Why he outstrips peers like JGarcia & JHendrix is his scope for pushing the blues envelope along with Asian & Middle Eastern & Celtic pastoral vistas- not as a master, but as a cartographer sketching undiscovered territory with only pencil & paper. This film is pure Led Zeppelin because it accidentally appeals to more people than it should, so there's big riffs for the little guy, threaded among unpolished details that contain passageways to the Hidden. Before you see the Light, joy & terror look the same in the Dark.",1371254400,,2564,4.9282407407407405

Over The Hills and Far Away
The Ocean
My gripe is that they were not edited into the other concert footage.  They have to be accessed through an ""extras"" menu.

292169,5,6300270424,"Over 30 years on and I am STILL blown away, each and every time; hearing and feeling something different every time.  In fact, I propose that listeners actually NEED 30 years-plus, spanning generations and eras, to absorb the sounds.  And yet, that's still not enough time to take it all in.

Led Zeppelin is NOT a band.  Led Zeppelin is a 4-piece orchestral explosion; birthed, nurtured and conducted by the mind-boggling Jimmy Page.  People this staggeringly brilliant are so often clinically insane; how Page managed to escape the doom of such a fate is a miraculous gift to music.

On today's listen, it was John Bonham's train that reached inside, grabbed hold and would not let go; driving through, nonstop, unable to stop, still feeling his beat long after he had stopped and there was silence.  Am half-way through the tape and still haven't once laid eyes on Bonham live during the concert footage, but he permeates every pulse and every breath.  Shamefully, it took me 30 years to truly appreciate what the surviving band members had been saying all along; that Bonham was the beating heart of Led Zeppelin.  Bonham was the master of ""less is more,"" giving life to what jazz artist Miles Davis knew was the key to greatness, which is knowing what notes NOT to play.

Many will disagree, but for me personally, the attempts at avant-garde cinema in this film were completely unnecessary.  I fast-forwarded to the point the REAL magic began.  The concert itself is more than us mere mortals can bear, both energizing and exhausting; the concert itself needs NO distractions.  The only joy I got from these interruptions was the rare opportunity to stare in awe at the young and in-his-prime Robert Plant's 70s-era seductive androgyny.  That mass of swirling curls around his classically-elegant face has moved millions of women to envy and jealousy of his beauty.

Um, 26 minutes of a Dazed & Confused jamming lovefest how can you go wrong. It will elevate you in ways that I'm to much of a gentleman to elicit here, :P -> Riffing/Soloing Nirvana

A much under recognized favorite jam of mine that just explodes out of Jimmy Page also is during Whole Lotta Love towards the end when he belts out the classic licks of Boogie Chillen(J.L.Hooker). This little Vin-bit clip in the overall W.L.L song is an older but stupendous classic blues riff that Jimmy really updates an metalized an just jams out a masterful rendition of the old blues standard. It's some of the best video out there displaying Jimmy Page fingering prowess out there in this man's humble 2 cent opinion. Anyway this movie is simply just Led Zeppelin in concert playing their hearts out to what I consider some of the best music, the best songs made ever overall!

For the record, I've must have seen this movie 100's of times back as a teenager if I've seen it once when I first began my perennial Zep Odyssey or Zepyssey. See, where I lived they use to play it at the theaters at midnight when I was a teenager back in the eighties(46 now) and usually every 4-6 months they would cycle it through for like 3-4 weekends in a row. It was by far the only way I was gonna ever see or specifically the closest I would ever get to seeing the all mighty Zep in a true sort of concert venue really ever. While watching it on my big 65"" screen now of course is very cool, it just can't compare to the huge screens and thunderous sound of the theaters all those years ago. It was such a chaotically good scene of just a couple hundred Zep Heads all convening and soaking up the sauce/smoke of whatever they could smuggle in with them while watching massive 20 foot images of the Wizards from Wembley play their collective a**es off. hehe (ok I know, none were specifically from Wembley, it's england though right & it just kinda flows and fits so no flaming please, lol)

This movie has it all....so if..... Your a Led Zep fan you should already own this, in fact shame on you if you don't! hehe. Ok joking, unless by this time next year you still don't have it, then I'm dead serious you my friend need fanboy absolution like fast) :P

- Your a Classic Rock fan, Get It!
- Your a Hard Rock fan, Get It!
- Your a Heavy Metal fan, GET It! (I know Zep's not regarded as metal overall, but in parts, Zep is banging as heavy as any metal made post since.)

Apparently they fired the first director of the movie.  There was much footage lost during the making of the film.  The finished product had a lot of gaps in it.  So, the band decided to fill in the gaps with those fantasy sequences which were done years later.  Another interesting tidbit:  They had to redo some of the songs on a sound stage.

292214,4,6300270424,"In case of content there are already enough reviews here. So I will focus on the video quality and compare this release with the older one. First of all let me mention that audio is really improved here compared the 1999 disc.

VIDEO: Old vs. New

To my big disappointment video quality here is not that great. In deed, it is worse than the older release.

SHARPNESS:
Probably the most important parameter of defining the quality of the video material is its sharpness. 1999 release is sharper than the 2007 one. Analog to digital transfer was done with higher resolution as the Blu-Ray release is definitely sharper than 1999 DVD. This means that it is only a problem of a DVD encoding.

COLOR AND BRIGHTNESS:
Judging by brightness and color some scenes are better on the old version and others are better on the new version. 2007 version has washed out colors in many scenes. 1999 version has better dark background while 2007 has some haze in some scenes. Overall, it is difficult to give advantage to one over another, in my opinion 1999 is still better most of the time.

BLENDING:
In 1999 release the film is soft telecined on DVD which means that it contains original 24 progressive frames per second. 2007 release is hard telecined but not via 2:3 pulldown which is common for NTSC DVD. Instead, some frames are blended and the video requires deinterlacing which sacrifices a vertical resolution. So, in addition to the fact that 2007 version is already less sharp compared to 1999 one this blending and deinterlacing downgrades the image more.

WHITE BALANCE:
White balance has been modified from scene to scene. 2007 release has green tint in many scenes, some frames look blue on 1999 and green on 2007. However, some scenes are in opposite way. I find the older release to have more natural colors but somebody may prefer the newer version.

BOTTOM LINE:
The old release has a better video quality, it is sharper and contains progressive frames. The new remastered release is softer and is hard telecined via frame blending. Audio is better on the new one.

There were no audio problems, either in Dolby 5.1 or dts hd, throughout the movie. However, I noticed that the extra songs (misty mountain hop, over the hills and far away, etc) sounded flat and tinny. On the led zeppelin DVD (2003), these performances had not only better sound but better visual effects and editing.

The picture, however, looks great; hard to believe this was filmed almost 40 years ago.

There are a few extras, 3 or 4 songs that were previously left out, as well as an interview. Standard blu ray case.

292218,3,6300270424,"Pretension runs all through director Peter Clifton's 137 minute long, 1976 quasi-documentary on Led Zeppelin and a series of three concert performances at Madison Square Garden, in New York City, during July of 1973, called The Song Remains The Same. Aside from the concert footage, the film weaves assorted silly fantasy sections into the film, as well as footage of backstage goings on, such as security guards beating rowdy fans, the theft of $203,000 from the band's safe deposit box at the hotel they were staying at, and band manager Peter Grant's bullying of various Garden personnel over matters trivial and not, among others. The film was not the first attempt at a true `rockumentary,' but it was the first rockumentary to try and add extraneous fictive material so the whole could be seen as a work of art, apart and above the actual music. Prior to The Song Remains The Same such films, like Michael Wadleigh's 1970 documentary Woodstock, on the famed 1969 rock festival, were basically strictly journalistic endeavors or attempts at cinema verit. Not so with this film. And that's its fatal flaw.

  While the music, and even the band's lapses into self-indulgence, are great, the film's cinematic pretensions bring the whole effort down into a barely passable cinematic mediocrity. In a sense, parts of the film play out almost like a precursor to Rob Reiner's seminal 1984 `mockumentary' classic This Is Spinal Tap. Numerous shots where the band is actually `live' in concert are mixed in with scenes of them on stages at Shepperton Studios that do not resemble their American venues, and numerous other little alterations had to be made. The film would have been so much better had they simply filmed the concerts, then did the fantasy sequences and combined them, rather than the time and money wasting rigmarole that ensued.

  Unlike the Beatles' A Hard Day's Night, which received overwhelmingly positive reviews for a bad film, The Song Remains The Same, a merely mediocre film, was almost routinely savagely attacked from Day One, mainly for the fantasy sequences. That said, like the Beatles film, the Led Zeppelin film did well at the box office. Unlike A Hard Day's Night, though, The Song Remains The Same was, indeed, a highly influential film. Almost all concert films and rockumentaries that have come since have this film's DNA stamped on it, for the good or the ill. And, unlike the Beatles film, this film's improvs are restricted to the musical stage, where Plant and Page were masters of that art form.",1340236800,,2536,4.955294117647059

Shows how much is lost from the masters. And you see enough to realize why they were the ""Kings of Rock"" from the late 60s through the 70s.

As most already know, the movie is quite uneven. Even Plant said it was ""a load of Bo%%ocks"". The fantasy scenes are just plain strange. Chalk that up to the 70s I suppose. The performance was self indulgent and long winded at times. Some parts were right out of a scene from Spinal Tap. Though I admit I'm not a huge fan, I've never seen a great live Led Zeppelin performance on film yet, and this didn't change anything. Mediocre at best. Very loose performances of some of their hits and long boring solos that go on forever.

I remember this film being a staple of ""Midnight Movies"" when I was a kid in the 70s and I always wondered what all the fuss was about. Now I know I wasn't missing much. This film was meant to be viewed stoned I suppose. Some of the most interesting bits were of the behind the scenes stuff. They could have made a much better film if they'd skipped some of the fantasy sequences and put more of that in there. The shot of the first song from above, when the lights go on and the first notes are played, was amazing, but it was mostly down hill from there. This concert came late in a long tour and you can tell the band are tired of playing songs straight up. They just tend to venture off in self-indulgent directions as a result. I was left wondering if they were even capable of playing the songs as recorded or were they just bored. I suspect the latter, as moment of sheer brilliance did occur. Not that live performances need to sound exactly like the recording, but at times I couldn't even recognize the songs.

I was left with an even greater appreciation of Page's, and even Bonham's playing. Bonham seemed as if he was going to destroy his drum set he was hitting so hard. Its apparent Page really was the heart of that band, though Jones steady contribution can not be ignored. Plant? Well you either love him or you don't. Great rock voice. But some of the screams and yells in the film seem so forced and out of place.

Reading about the production problems they had with this film, its a wonder it turned out as good as it was. It explained a lot. Like John Paul Jone's ridiculous wig. The lack of continuity.

especially the one from knebworth, which was one of bonham's last performance, he plays as if his life depended on it.  it was kind of ironic that he played that night with all his might, and that would be the last official video released.  even though they are a lot older now, their knebworth far out weighed song remains the same.  it is too bad that they full knebworth and earl's court performance was never released in full officially.  regardless the video footages are a testimony that these four lads from england, wales, and scotland did not go down like a led ballooon, but flew as high as anyone could, and crashed landed in 1980.  along with the beatles, they are still revered as the greatest  rock band ever that walked the earth among the giants.",1333411200,,1042,4.553763440860215

So, being the huge Led Zeppelin fan that I am, I decided to watch this as I was doing my homework. Needless to say, I have been on problem #21 in my differential equations book for the past 2 hours and 17 minutes. I simply could not peel my eyes away from the screen. I was drumming along with my pencils along with Bonzo the entire time. The world around me ceased to be as I was there in New York City 35 years ago. I can only imagine how much better it would have been on DVD or Blu-Ray with surround sound. Regardless, do yourself a treat and set aside some time to watch this. And if you have Prime, it's absolutely free! So what more reason do you need? I might be a little grumpy at my 8AM class tomorrow morning as I likely won't finish my homework until 3AM now, but without any shadow of a doubt, it was worth it. I probably will watch it again before I go to bed. It begins a little strangely, but it got right to the point. The setlist is superb, playing all of their biggest hits up through Houses of the Holy, although being Led Zeppelin, they could have played anything and it would have been equally amazing. Throughout the film, they highlight each member of the quartet individually as they play a song that specifically takes advantage of their abilities (No Quarter for JPJ, Moby Dick for Bonzo, The Song Remains the Same for Plant, and Dazed and Confused for Page). Furthermore, the visuals throughout the entire movie are simply breathtaking, from actually being in the stadium as they play to the sub-stories of each individual member. In typical Zeppelin fashion, each song is heavily improvised and never fails to astound. They do things with their music that I had never imagined possible. When Jimmy Page began playing with the bow during Dazed and Confused, I was astonished that firstly I had never heard of him doing this before and also that more people don't do this. Never before in my life have I wished so much that I had been born 30 years earlier so I could have actually been there. Since I can't (sigh) this is certainly the next best thing.

292228,5,6300270424,"In the early 70's when Rock was still young and concerts were a major geographical social event, the greatest Rock band of all time decided to pursue a movie project and The Song Remains The Same was born...
Each member of the band has a personal vignette that attempts to capture some of the soul of that person, with the rest mostly being live footage of the 1971 concert in New York's Madison Square Garden. As awesome as the Led Zeppelin albums were, Zepp really took flight when playing live and it shows in this spectacle of the legendary guitar riffs, pounding sonic drums behind the music, magically lifting keyboards and bass, and soaring vocals that scream into the heavens only to lilt softly back to earth... Robert Plant, Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones, and John ""Bonzo"" Bonham come together to show the world what Rock and Roll was meant to be.
If you were born too late and missed out on the most fun decade the world has known, or just want to go back and revisit the majesty and surreal greatness that was the the epitome of rock concerts, this DVD will do the trick.

292231,1,6300270424,"No one can question the rank and prestige Led Zeppelin deserves in the pantheon of rock. The Beatles, Stones, Who, Sabbath, Zeppelin, and the like. No questions. No ifs ands or buts. Well, one but. The Song Remains the Same is the mighty Zeppelin's thorn. In Chris Welch's book on manager Peter Grant, Grant called it nothing better than an expensive home movie. The fact was, the film was a dysfunctional mess from its conception that the band originally felt nothing but indifference towards. Even hardcore Zep devotees were disappointed - but so were the band members.

In fact, the whole concert had to be recreated at Shepperton Studios after the Madison Square Garden dates in order to add material, fix mistakes, and alter poor performances. Yes, even Zeppelin had to Milli Vanilli overdub/reshoot their own production to salvage the film. And, this was an embarrassment to the band because they were among the most authentic bands of the day. Zeppelin was a band who took pride in the purity of their music. They refused to go on television shows that required them to use canned music to mimic their own music (such as Top of the Pops). In Uncut Magazine's May 2008 issue, Page admitted ""... I'm sort of miming at Shepperton to what I'd played at Madison Square Garden, but of course, although I've got a rough approximation of what I was playing from night to night, it's not exact. So the film that came out in the '70s is a bit warts-and-all.""

One may think that this criticism is mostly for the uninspiring and almost laughable fantasy sequences. Rather, the movie was always deadpanned. And it still is. It was often viewed as self-indulgent. However, for this I defend Zeppelin. Is not rock by its very nature self-indulgent! And if a band deserves a bit of self-indulgence, Zeppelin is arguably just. Yet, all the hoopla about how the updated soundtrack mix, retooling, and surround sound heighten the experience of being at the actual 73 Madison Square Garden concerts is trivial at best. You hear Shepperton reshoots again and again. As David Cavanaugh in Uncut Magazine said, its a sonic experience of a concert never really heard. Warts and all.

So, there are much better examples of filmed live Led Zeppelin out there. True Zeppelin fans can point you there quickly and honestly. The Song Remains the Same is not one of them. Though Zeppelin's prestige simply cannot be beat by most any other band other than the Beatles or the Stones (maybe The Who on a good night), many agree with Kathleen Carroll of the New York Daily News who was not fooled by the deception and described the film as ""a hopelessly pretentious piece of trash...in what is laughably called a performance.""

Now, that is a bit harsh. Live early 70s Zep is among the best live rock available. This film is still watchable. But, with the caveat that one remembers it is what it is AND it isn't what it isn't. It's a bit like seeing Page's name as the credited writer for Dazed and Confused. Check that one out (hint: Holmes).",1325980800,6,3016,4.717267552182163

292246,5,6300270424,"This is the review of the Blu-Ray version of the movie that i saw for the first time in theater a long time ago. There is a improvement of the picture quality compare to the DVD version, but nothing as good as a Blu-Ray of today. What is so interesting about this movie is that it's not only a music concert, it's a lot more. There is some fiction images throughout the movie along with behind the scenes and real day life action footage with each members of the band. The musicians played a role by illustrating the story of the songs like characters in a movie.

The movie starts with the arrival of the crew and the band in Manhattan by car. The city where the show has taken place has a important meaning to the movie. There is some entertaining behind the scenes footage, that had took place during the show. It's a real treat to see the manager takes on his crew members who had let circulate some pirates posters of the band. There goes down the drain the merchandising profits! And not only that, but we learned that the show's profits have disappear in what looks like a robbery!

Now for the actual live footage! To have footage of the legendary band is a rare historical moment and i have never been disappointed by the quality of the footage, a little dark with no visuals, because the music was so appealing to me. The idea of illustrating the show with a story is not a bad idea, but at times, i was missing the joy of seeing the band play their instrument, it's the case, especially during the song ""The Song Remains the Same"", who is one of the best Led Zeppelin songs, along with ""No Quarter"", simply because for me that's the songs that are the closest to Progressive rock with their nice atmosphere. Another highlight of the show is the 15 minutes drum solo of John Bonham, who is captured nicely by cameras.

The extras contains more songs, and more footage of the conference press talking about the robbery that i was talking earlier in my review. After 38 years, it's easy for me to give this a 5 stars, because it's still a great music to hear today despite some flaws on the quality of the footage, but put in the context of the 70's and restore on Blu-Ray, it's nice to watch.

The absolute worst part is that the matching of the video to the audio is probably the WORST I've ever come across.  Hardly one lick from Page matches the video - it is matched singularly to Plant, and sometimes even misses that mark.  So, it is really hard to 'get into it' during a lick or solo when the timing is off.  IT IS JUST THAT BAD.

When I first saw this streaming, I thought it was a bootleg because it was so poorly edited.  Then a friend brought the disc over and we checked it out.  I can't believe that the original members of the band approved of this release.  Scenes are noticeably, drastically out of sync w/the soundtrack.  Moby Dick was completely hacked up, and at one point they show the end of Bonham's solo on a different track!  Splicing is so bad you can see close up shots of an artist doing something or nothing and the soundtrack doing the opposite - just bad work.  It is actually hard to watch.

I really wanted to like this concert film, I mean that, but have got to be honest here. It was interesting in spots, yet disappointing as a whole. I know, sacrilege! Hang the blasphemer.

But here's why, OK?

Robert Plant's voice was irretrievably, undeniably SHOT. He couldn't hit those soaring high notes and seemed a parody of himself, all slender and fem and with skintight hip-huggers that only teen girls wear these days. And what was it with those constant looking-up camera shots of his groin? (Yes, it's draped to the left. We get it.)

Everything went rapidly downhill during the John Paul Jones organ solo. This was followed by one LONG self-indulgent jam after another for nearly an hour. It was stultifying.

John Bonham's spotlight, Moby Plant's Crotch, was spoiled during his hands-only playing by inconsiderate audience yowps and whistles. So was Robert's ""Stairway to Heaven"" solo. He also killed it himself though with pretentious ""ad-libbed"" comments like, ""Does anybody remember laughter?"" No. Never heard of it, Bobby.

Quando tudo estiver dito e feito, o que est realmente na caixa que me preocupa  o 2-DVDs remasterizados da The Song Remains the Same concerto ( um DVD do concerto, o DVD  outro material bnus) - que, passado vez que eu olhava, tinha apenas $ 13,99 na Amazon. Assim, o filme Zep no s custa menos, mas o padro de 2 DVDs remasterizados da The Song Remains the Same  uma caixa de DVD tradicional. Em outras palavras,  resistente. Ela vai estar na sua prateleira sem cair, ser esmagado, ou arrastados para cima. E para assisti-lo, voc no tem que puxar para alm de uma caixa, fumble ao redor do estojo, extra-lo, e depois tentar recuper-lo quando voc estiver pronto - tudo sem prejudicar ainda mais o carto. Soa como uma proposta perdedora para mim.

Em suma, embora a verso remasterizada The Song Remains the Same filme  excelente (eo conjunto de 2 CDs de udio  impressionante!), A edio deste Collector's DVD conjunto  frgil, no ser bem pensado e surpreendentemente espetacular. Eu no recebi o ""Uau!"" fator quando eu abri a caixa. Eu tenho o ""Gee? Agora o que eu fao com essas peas, agora que a T-shirt (que serviu como um espaador na caixa)  removido?"" fator.

Eu digo poupar o seu dinheiro no presente Collector's Edition DVD. Compre o DVD remasterizado 2-set de The Song Remains the Same vez. Voc vai conseguir o que  realmente importante e voc vai evitar a dor de cabea tentando descobrir como armazenar cuidadosamente ""bnus"" itens sem danific-los.

292290,5,6300270424,"The Song Remains the Same film is one of the most entertaining rock videos of all time. Despite the band's own criticism of the project, this film nonetheless captures a lot more than just playing in concert at Madison Square Garden in July, 1973. The film starts out with some violent scenes (shooting) which is a subliminal message of sorts to the band's critics, followed by some cherished footage of each band members' activities before embarking on their long tour. Sprinkled into the video are each member's fantasies that are presented in song format. John Paul Jones' fantasy is during NO QUARTER, while Page's fantasy is during DAZED AND CONFUSED, Plant's during THE RAIN SONG, and Bonham's during MOBY DICK. As one continues to watch this film, it becomes more and more obvious that the rules were loose at the Garden during the concert, as police and security guards were very accomodating to those who wanted to sneak in without paying. Also, illegal concessionaires got away with selling poses of the band members for quite some time, and it was Zep's manager, Peter Grant, who discovered them--NOT Madison Square Garden personnel, much to the displeasure of Grant. Grant goes on a tirade, accusing the MSG personnel of getting ""kickbacks."" I'm emphasizing this scene because it adds to the entertainment value of the film, as this scene has humor in it. Grant leaves nothing in the bag when addressing the MSG people. He very well may have been the star of the film!!! Finally, Zeppelin winds up losing over $200,000 from a safe deposit box at their hotel. So, this film has a little bit of everything, including a very undersized shirt that Robert Plant is wearing!!! The Song Remains the Same is a very cool film that depicts an early 70's hard rock band's lifestyle, and life in general for fans, as well. This is nostalgic Led Zeppelin.......a time when they were at their creative peak. 10/10",1290816000,3,1911,4.847094801223242

If you are a die hard Led Zeppelin fan you will like this DVD set. The concert footage is what makes it. The movie scenes are for the most part cheesy,but it's still fun to see the band doing anything other than being on stage rocking. I enjoy getting a peek of them in the real world with families.

It's been digitally remastered and has a couple of never before released performances-Celebration day and Over the Hills and Far Away

292292,2,6300270424,"Since there's plenty of reviews concerning the movie I wanted to focus on the packaging.

When this edition was announced I was quite excited to get my hands on a copy. I was more interested in the packaging including the shirt and other extras not included with the other editions of this release. I'll cut to the chase. The outer box is made from flimsy cardboard that can be easily damaged. I bought several extra copies since I wanted to have at least one sealed since I'm a collector. Both of those copies arrived damaged and I don't blame the dealers but whoever the brainchild was whom created this version. These two were also cut out copies. Upon opening my original copy I couldn't help but notice the cheap quality of the shirt included. Very thin cotton and after about 6 months of use there's not much left of shirt and it looks very worn now. For the most part I'm very displeased with the material used for this set marketed as 'Collector's Edition"" I think more thought could have gone into this and considering the original price when released, it should have!!!

""
Their are two versions of the ""Collector's Edition. I believe when originally released, their was material used that Zeppelin did not own the copyright to nor get permission to use so it was discontinued quickly. This version has white symbols like the picture used for this review. The second version omits this material and has black symbols which is more than likely what you will receive when ordering. You might want to check with your dealers to confirm what your getting and I'm still looking for the white symbols box.",1281052800,6,1609,4.661971830985915

292297,5,6300270424,"This is by far one of the greatest concerts ever captured on film, and it looks and sounds completely amazing on Blu-ray!

Let's get the age-old nit-picks that still exist out of the way right now: Yes, the fantasy scenes can get annoying sometimes, but you can easily skip through them (even though the music flows very well with them). Yes, some of the music doesn't sync up with what you see on the screen part of the time, but that's because this concert contains separate footage from 3 shows Zeppelin did at MSG in 73' (they patched the songs together to make it appear that this was all one concert, when in fact you can see the band members wearing different clothes in the footage in different songs). The reason for this: The show originally wasn't released until 1976 (3 years after filming) due to legal struggles the band and their manager (Peter Grant) had with the original director (Joe Massot) regarding possession of the film after Massot was removed from the project. Massot was eventually court ordered to give the film back to the band, but there were visual and audio elements of the show that came up missing (as well as ones poorly recorded because of the camera men's level of intoxication). Therefore, when this show was released (and especially when Jimmy Page remastered it for DVD and Blu-ray release), what you actually see on the screen has both visual and audio elements that are compiled and patched together from the material the band was able to work with.

The creation of this concert may sound like it was an exhausting task, but the truth of what is presented as the end product is quite to the contrary. The video quality is top notch to say the least, and the audio is COMPLETELY mind blowing. If at times the audio may not sync up perfectly with the video (aka the opening solo to Since I've Been Loving You) you'll find yourself not even caring because the sound is simply superb (I recommend using the DTS or HD decoding). Every song this night was played much better than the studio version, and in my opinion much better than any of their other live shows captured on film (with the exception of Rock-n-Roll and Whole Lotta Love, I like the ones from Knebworth 79'...another great show). The fantasy scenes are rather weird, but each of them actually plays a solid role in some message the band is attempting to express. An example of such is the opening scene with the faceless mobsters being annihilated by gunmen; gunmen led by Peter Grant. This is representative of the band's feelings toward the faceless British media who constantly degraded them as a worthless band.

When all is said and done, just buy this concert. You will not be disappointed, especially if you are a Zeppelin fan. If you already have the DVD and aren't sure if the Blu-ray is worth the cost just for the better picture, trust me when I say it is worth the cost.",1268697600,14,2886,4.6

292321,2,6300270424,"Wow. I'm super disappointed in this DVD. Just watched a bit today. The sound of Bonham's drums is awful! They are all full of reverb and the crack of the snare is completely gone. Jimmy Page is losing it. The powerful ""Thunder of Drums"" is not there. Zeppelin is not Zeppelin without the classic sound of Bonham's Vistalites. I'm sorry I wasted my money. I'll probably go back to watching my old DVD of TSRTS.

1-26-2013
To add to this review, I must put some blame on Kevin Shirley. I'm sure he had something to do with the horrible mix and the neutering of Bonham's snare drum sound. I just watched the two versions back to back yesterday. It's really bad.

I will say one thing positive - there is an absolute gem on the second disc. When the menu comes up, the music that plays is a previously unreleased short segment of Whole Lotta Love that is probably one of the grooviest things Zeppelin ever played. Too bad the original soundtrack didn't have this nugget of gold, but given the fact that the original movie was pieced together from different nights and that the film crew didn't actually capture an entire version of Whole Lotta Love during the three nights in MSG, I guess it's somewhat understandable. But since they filmed the concert over again a year later at Shepperton studios, they could have picked the best sounding bits and made the film fit the sound. Don't believe that most of the movie is not from MSG? Read ""Peter Grant - The Man Who Led Zeppelin"" or Google ""Led Zeppelin Shepperton"" and see what comes up.

Plant of a few years earlier.  Get the excellent double DVD ""Led Zeppelin"" instead - way, way better.

Most noteworthy is the drum solo from ""Moby Dick"" from the late John Bonham. It is long,but anything but boring. Overall,this is evidence of why their will never again be quite a decade like the 1970s for music.",1257724800,,482,4.488636363636363
292362,4,6300270424,"For Zeppelin fans a review is unnecessary.  For those just discovering the band here's what you need to know.  Should you see it?  Definitely.  Should you buy it?  Depends.  It helps to know the studio versions first since many of the songs from the concert use the studio version as a jumping off point for long sonic explorations and solos.
 The high points:  The music is very good and has aged quite well in my opinion.  I also enjoyed the backstage scenes and the segments of the various goings on with the fans, the band, and the crew members. The scene where manager Peter Grant confronting the venue manager over a man selling pirated photos of the band comes to mind, or the garage scene where security lets in a group of surprised and appreciative fans that don't have tickets.  These are very reminiscent of scenes from The Grateful Dead Movie and offer a wider perspective of the whole concert experience.
 What does not work... are the fantasy scenes of each band member played against the backdrop of songs associated with them.  To be blunt they are dated and cheesy.  And so are their outfits, but that can be more easily forgiven.  It was the early seventies!  And last but not least, the sound it good and the video is surprisingly clear and clean for a show that was shot over thirty-five years ago.

Yes, there is an ample supply of fodder for ""Spinal Tap"" parody in this film, but this is also part of the intrinsic magic of this film.

In spite of the excesses, and the silly (but entertaining) excursions into the short ""fantasy sequences""...this film ROCKS. Yeah, it was 1973, and there is some rock n' roll bloat, but there is also greatness, and sheer joy at the quality of the performances.

The Blu-ray of this film is very good. We are all fortunate that this movie was made because we have a record/time capsule of the rock scene circa 1973.

If you don't know Zep well, this won't help, but if you understand Aleister Crowley, the arts, the seventies, and magic, this will click unlike the VIDEO TAPE of later items.

292395,5,6300270424,"Released in 1976, The Song Remains The Same is footage taken on three nights in Led Zeppelin's 1973 concert at New York's Madison Square Gardens.  The band performs ""Rock and Roll,"" ""Black Dog,"" ""Since I've Been Loving You,"" ""No Quarter,"" ""The Song Remains The Same,"" ""The Rain Song,"" ""Dazed and Confused,"" ""Stairway to Heaven,"" ""Moby Dick,"" ""Heartbreaker,"" and ""Whole Lotta Love.""  The film is structured such that it starts off with a fantasy sequences and then shots of the band at home with their families before the tour starts, then there's documentary footage of the band arriving in New York and driving into Manhattan, before the concert begins. The onstage shots are largely of Robert Plant, with some of Jimmy Page, less of John Bonham, and really only one or two of John Paul Jones (who literally wears a heart on his sleeve).  Robert Plant is dressed in jeans, shirtless under a dainty vest, John Paul Jones is also pretty in some sort of Victorian garb, Jimmy Page is an alien in a star suit, and John Bonham a lad in white pants and a t-shirt.  The onstage footage is okay, but there's probably too much camera attention given to Robert Plant, rock 'n' roll's great Adonis, not nearly enough to Jimmy Page, rock 'n' roll's great Anubis.  For some of Page's solos the camera is elsewhere (such as on John Paul Jones during the amazing ""Since I've Been Loving You"" solo, or on all the other members of the band when the crunchy riff of ""Dazed and Confused"" kicks in at the beginning of the song), or even when the camera is on Page during a solo the focus is too high and you can't see what he's doing with his hands, very frustrating.  During other solos the director cuts to a fantasy sequence or shows documentary footage.  Sometimes this works well, such as during the wanky 20-minute ""Dazed and Confused"" solo, but I'd liked to have watched the ""No Quarter"" solo.

The fantasy sequence that start the movie is probably the best one, showing John Bonham, manager Peter Grant and tour manager Richard Cole dressed up as gangster hitmen driving an old-timer from one country estate to another, which they proceed to shoot up with machine guns.  Whoever their enemies are (one of them, apparently, is Roy Harper) is never explained, the episode is quite surreal.  Then it goes to the present day, Peter Grant is on a phone, a message is dispatched, a messenger delivers a letter to Robert Plant on his farm in Bron-Yr-Aur where he's watching his kids playing, the five-year-old Carmen Jane and the two-year-old Karac (who would, tragically, die of a viral infection four years after), John Bonham is plowing the fields with a tractor, John Paul Jones is reading ""Jack and the Beanstock"" to his daughters Jacinda, Tamara and Kierra, Peter Grant is driving an old-timer with a woman, Richard Cole is driving another old-timer to a pub, and Jimmy Page is playing a hurdy gurdy by the lake (he turns around, his shades glow orange and the world goes psychedelic).  John Paul Jones gets the only lines of any of the intro or fantasy sequences, when he reads the letter: ""Tour dates!"" (goofy grin).  ""This is Tomorrow!"" (look of dismay).  Cue Led Zeppelin's jet The Starship landed in New York, limousines, police escort, the pastoral ""Bron-Yr-Aur"" plays as the limos approach Madison Square Gardens.  Doves fly through the air.  We are in a dark, crowded space, the band seems to be onstage, we hear the massive drum intro to ""Rock 'n' Roll,"" then the lights come on and it's Led Zeppelin!!!!

But you do see some Jimmy Page, there is even a nice shot that highlights drops of sweat that have fallen on his Les Paul. In many of the shots of Robert Plant, his crotch is in clear view and the shape of his genitals is quite clearly outlined through his tight jeans.  Great crowd shots, including scenes of girls in rapt attention, plenty of stoners, even black guys dressed like pimps. Cool theremin bits, including one blast in ""No Quarter,"" and plenty more in ""Whole Lotta Love.""  Too many non-band members in view in some of the shots, so it's not very intimate.  Bonzo working the drum, grimacing and gnashing his teeth, flicking his tongue.  Snatches of ""San Francisco (Be Sure To Wear Flowers In Your Hair)"" sung during ""Dazed and Confused,"" also the violin bow, and a slight bit of ""Black Sabbath"" at one moment.  There's a cool guitar jam at the end of ""Dazed and Confused"" that could probably even be considered a song of its own.  The camera work, while it was generally quite weak throughout, does some interesting things at times, such as going around 360 degrees as some points, and at one point in ""Stairway to Heaven"" there is a cool split-screen mirror doubling thing, like Prince did in ""When Doves Cry,"" highlighting Jimmy Page playing guitar (and another of Robert Plant quadrupled.  Of course, in other parts you get the sense that shots from other parts of the night have been stitched edited together, and there is occasionally the feeling that what we're watching is authentic - apparently some gaps in footage were filled by having the band re-shoot on a recreated stage in 1974, aping their movements of that night in New York.  But the band is tight, and it is amazing how, after a 20 minute digression in the solo of ""Dazed and Confused,"" the band gets right back into the song without stumbling in the slightest.

There are also subtly amusing bits, like when Robert Plant flashes the two-finger salute with one hand and the V for Victory with the other during the ""you know sometimes words have two meanings"" lyric.  Of course, there's also the famous ""Moby Dick"" drum solo where everyone goes off, that show Bonzo throwing away the sticks and using his hands to drum, splicing elegantly at one point to a clip of Jason Bonham on the drums - he must have been five years old in the shot.  Interesting in ""Whole Lotta Love,"" you actually see Jimmy Page for the first time stepping up to the mic to perform some sort of backup vocals in the chorus, although you don't really hear him.  Why that song and no other?  Nice shot of Jimmy playing the theremin in ""Whole Lotta Love,"" then Robert in Jimmy's underarm.  Cool shot of Orange amp head at 1:58:23.  Robert ad-libs a lyric ""some are lined with gold - Acapulco Gold.""  They finish the set and Bonzo attacks a gong with a flaming mallet, and the gong frame lights up.  The band walks offstage, the house lights come on, and the band gets into their limo and moves on.  The band are seen at the airport getting into the Starship, and that's all there is.

Besides the opening fantasy scene, four others appear throughout the movie; the first one spliced into the concert is John Paul Jones', which comes during a long organ and guitar interval in ""No Quarter,"" it shows him playing a huge church organ, then riding around in a mask with three other masked horsemen, before he returns home to a Victorian household and his beautiful wife and daughter (played by Jimmy Page's girlfriend at the time and their daughter).  Robert's fantasy scene is during ""The Song Remains The Same"" and ""The Rain Song,"" it shows him on a beach with a sword, riding around on a horse, galloping, eating a big red toadstool he found in the forest, the sword burning on the beach at night, a castle where he uses his falcon to attack people in the castle, then he goes up and has a sword fight, rescuing a damsel in distress.  Great long shot of him riding in the mountains, the camera pulls back to show the gigantic valley he's entering.  Jimmy's fantasy scene is in ""Dazed and Confused"" and shows a mountain at night, a full moon, Jimmy climbing up the mountain (the way renowned occultist and mountaineer Alistair Crowley, his idol, did on so many treacherous passes), kind of an odd thought for such an un-athletic person. He reaches a ledge where a man is standing, it is The Hermit from the Tarot deck (and also seen on the band's fourth album).  The Hermit lifts his head and regresses in age until you realise it's Jimmy Page, then a baby Jimmy, then a foetus in the womb, then a flash of lightning, then he ages again into The Hermit (later in Dazed and Confused"" there's also a cool section where a shot of Jimmy freezes and the camera zooms up into his eye and cuts to a documentary scene). John Bonham's ""fantasy"" sequence in ""Moby Dick"" is more like shots of him hanging out with his family.  He's got shorter hair than he did onstage in 1973, and is shown with some sort of a mullet, playing pool, hugging his wife.

Documentary clips that are interspersed show Robert and Peter talking, Peter Grant arguing about how they caught people selling bootleg material inside the venue - posters - and arguing with the venue manager about it, security cops and fans hanging around outside, a cop on horseback saying ""no comment,"" guys getting let in without tickets, a guy getting chased and nabbed and taken into a toilet by security cops, another guy getting ejected, there is also some footage concerning the lost $200,000, for which there was a press conference at the time and some of the people involved were taken in for questioning.

The extras on the second disc are not bad, although there's nothing really remarkable there either.  There's a news report from a Tampa TV, showing lots of long-hairs and parking lots full of 1970s gas guzzlers, channel that is probably the crappiest bit of news reporting that I've ever heard, talking about the biggest crowd ever assembled in ""the history of the world!!""  Yes, 50,000 people were there, and scraggly mustachioed John Jones reported on it.  ""I'm pleased to say that one of the group's four members has my same name, that's John Paul Jones,"" he cleverly points out.  He repeats himself, ""Now, I said this was the largest single performance crowd ever to attend any concert in the history of the world, and I meant it!""  The host then jumps in and repeats John Jones' intro of the band: ""Their names are Robert Plant, John Benham, Jimmy Page, and John Paul Jones.  Robert, Jimmy, John and John; doesn't quite have the appeal of John, Paul, George and Ringo, but they certainly have the drawing power of the Beatles.""  Hey - who's ""John Benham?""  Sheesh.  There's also some more footage of the robbery of $200,000, a small part of which was put in the film, as ell as the original film trailer.  Then there's an 8-minute long interview with Robert Plant and manager Peter Green on a boat going down the Thames, not of much interest except when Robert hints at how they ""rented the sharks,"" referring to the infamous shark incident with the groupie.  There are four other tracks that weren't cut into the movie: ""Over The Hills And Far Away,"" ""Celebration Day,"" ""Misty Mountain Hop,"" and ""The Ocean.""  All of the performances are straight, meaning no cutting into documentary footage or fantasy sequences.",1232755200,21,10832,4.655299055613851
292396,3,6300270424,"This is a mediocre movie, but Led Zeppelin was a great band if you liked their headbanger heavy metal sound. When I saw that this live concert at Madison Square Garden took place in 1973, the year I graduated from high school, I thought a blast from the past would be interesting. But concert movies are tricky. In a sense you get the worst of both worlds -- you are not, in fact, present at a live concert, but watching it second hand, and the quality of the music doesn't compare to the studio recordings we're used to from CDs. There's no narration in this film, and really no narrative. By today's standards the technology is forty years old. We learn nothing from or about the band. But for those of that generation like me, it was still fun to watch a band that defined a generation (and sold 300 million albums) with songs like ""Stairway to Heaven,"" ""Whole Lotta Love,"" ""Heartbreaker,"" and ""Dazed and Confused"" -- Jimmy Page on what the film hails as ""the electric guitar,"" Robert Plant (vocals), John Paul Jones (bass guitar, keyboards) and John Bonham (drums).",1232582400,,1069,4.602094240837697

Ever.  The things Jimmy pulls off are amazing.  With this DVD you get to see Led Zeppelin all at the height of their creativity, talent and ability.  I was a little surprised when I first realized that the newly included songs that were left off the original motion picture were placed on a separate disk and not inserted into their respective places in the concert film.  But then I read that due to legal reasons, they weren't allowed to alter the original format of the film...only remaster the sound and images, but not mess around with the order of songs.  So they had to put those other songs from the NY concerts on a separate disk.  No biggie, at least you now have them all.  The Ocean, Celebration Day and others!  Some cool extras that I hadn't seen before.
  Some people who don't understand Led Zeppelin have complained that the live versions don't sound like the studio versions.  However, Led never tried to reproduce that sound.  They played these songs differently every night.  Another complaint is that some say Zep live is self-indulgent.  It's not.  Per Jimmy Page, Led Zeppelin live allows for all four members to take their turn in ""steering the ship.""  In this manner, it's actually very generous to the other members and not selfish. What else can be said that hasn't already been said by thousands (millions?) of other Zep fans.  This concert is tremendous and the level of musicianship is awe-inspiring.  And why wouldn't you want to see Jimmy at his height, playing his double-neck Gibson plus his famous Les Pauls!  If you like rock music, you've got to have it.",1226880000,11,1770,4.737704918032787

292443,4,6300270424,"I got to see this on the big screen as part of the DVD promotion. If you want to see why LZ was a great live band, get the self titled DVD.

For years, the only live Zeppelin you could get were either bootlegs or this movie, but since Page opened the vault, you've had the ""BBC Sessions"" and ""How The West Was Won"" (also the beginning of the ""Houses of the Holy"" tour, TSRTS was the end of the tour), both of which decimated the original soundtrack. Until the rerelease. So do get the soundtrack CD even though you might think owning the movie alone is fine. It sounds great and you can throw those old copies away.

But the DVD is meant to be played loud on a surround system. The original film was shown in some theaters in Quadrophonic, so it was always intended to be heard that way. Bonham's drums, Page's guitars are all put to good effect in surround. But what you will notice is how clean the movie print looks, a lot more colorful and brighter than probably when it was originally shown in the mid 70s.

I thought they were going to add the outtakes into the movie, but they left it as bonus footage. And it would have been a nice option if they were able to set it up where fans could watch the concert itself instead of the ""fantasy"" sequences and the theft which annoyingly cuts into a great song.

Warning - the ""PG"" rating needs to be revised, because the other copies of the home video have the part with manager Peter Grant going off on MSG staff censored. On this DVD, there is no mistaking the 4 letter words. Not once, not twice, but 17 times. It would have been great to hear some commentary from the band and the director, looking back at it.

There are better concert films and there are some really ridiculous scenes in this,and the lack of continuity of what they're wearing is pretty hilarious, but the point of the film was to capture a band in its prime on a big screen and escape for a couple of hours. It's by far not their best performance captured on film or tape, but there are some great moments on stage where you're definitely feeling like you missed out on a great show.

I had seen this movie maybe 10 times, and I think this sorely needed remastered version will renew your interest in it for the first time in years.",1215561600,,2255,4.269320843091335

Would have been always really cool if they would have made this with just the jams on stage through out the soloing as opposed to their fantasy impressions.

Or see Jimmy Page do all of the guitar work instead of climbing that rocky hill with his climbing shoes on.

292484,4,6300270424,"UPDATE: This flaw was corrected in a silent replacement of the title.  It took over a year for Warner to fix it, but they did fix it.  I have changed my rating of the disc as a result.  I realize some were not happy I was critical of this because the gap is only 7 seconds, but a 7 second dropout during a drum solo is pretty bad IMO.  Some also may not have experienced the glitch due to getting a fixed copy (again, a year after release) or were not streaming TrueHD.

Anyway, good that the glitch is fixed, however it would have been better if Warner had an official replacement program instead of just silently fixing the problem in an unlabelled 2nd pressing.

BELOW IS ORIGINAL REVIEW TEXT:

Unfortunately the Blu-ray version of this concert has a 7-second long sound dropout in the TrueHD soundtrack at timecode 1:40:45 - all copies of the Blu-ray currently available are affected.  The TrueHD soundtrack of the previously released HD DVD does not suffer from this dropout (nor does the Blu-ray's lower quality DD soundtrack), so it is clear this was an encoding goof-up on Warner's part.

This type of QC problem is unacceptable for a product that costs $20, yet Warner has not mentioned any intention of fixing the issue.  Hopefully they get on the ball and set up a replacement program for those who buy this defective disc.

Note that the recent re-release of this disc still suffers from the dropout problem.  Maybe the third time will be the charm... :\",1206835200,169,1466,4.574712643678161

Anyway I have the ""standard"" remastered edition for ""Region 2"" and this is not a big issue.

I don't know if this ""Collector's Edition"" will become available also for other markets, but I couldn't find any news about it...

Historically Led Zeppelin preferred the U.S. market instead of the ""ancient"" Europe, and this could be a reason why this package is available for the U.S. market only! Every time I was in the U.S. I found lot of radio station broadcasting Led Zeppelin music, this doesn't happen in Italy...

""Celebration Day"" was one I have always wanted to see - purely because of the monster guitar solo.  It did not dissapoint.  I would have preferred to see a direct guitar shot for the whole solo, but overall, the song was filmed and synched up with the music very well.  ""Over the Hills And Far Away"" was stunning.  I was suprised how well it came off live.  ""The Ocean"" was the same version that was on ""How The West Was Won"" as was ""Misty Mountain Hop"".  The best part of the new release is definitely the re-synching of the video and audio - a much better job than the original, although still not perfect.

My fantasy for this movie is to have all the live footage released WITHOUT those stupid, drug induced, amateurish, fantasy sequences that ruin the best parts of ""Dazed and Confused"", ""No Quarter"", Moby Dick"", ""The Song Remains The Same"" and ""The Rain Song"".

292548,4,6300270424,"This movie deserves four stars simply because it is Led Zeppelin, and I am always transfixed to the screen when I am watching anything relating to the mighty Zep - the greatest rock band that ever existed or will ever exist.  In terms of  excitement and entertainment value, it scores big.  Since there is not a whole lot out of the Zeppelin history out there on video, it remains a relatively iconic portion of the Zep legacy.  Most of the decent video footage that has surfaced has already been released by the band (in part at least).  A notable exception is the Seattle 1977 show, which is definitely being held back by the band due to the difficult performance offered by Page that night (although Page looked like he was having a great time on stage at least).  I think it is apparent that, to the members of Zep, the maintenance of the Zeppelin image for posterity overshadows all other considerations, including satisfying freaks like myself that want to see it all, the good and the not as good (I subscribe to the NBZ idea - No Bad Zep).  This unpredictability and playing on the edge of pandemonium are part of what made Zeppelin so interesting.

I have a bootleg of one of the 1973 MSG shows and the playing is probably average or slightly above average for a Zeppelin show at that time.  1973 is when the first signs of strain started to appear in the Zeppelin live experience.  The (bootleg) shows from 1968-1972 are all very consistently good, I think peaking in 1972 which simply put had some of the most powerful and well-executed live performances ever given in the history of rock music.  Even the British swing of early 1973 was still at or near this level.  By the American tour of 1973, I think the strains of the constant touring were taking their toll on the band and the playing began to become more inconsistent.  I also think real indulgences by the band were starting to factor in slightly, but were a long way off from creating the serious problems as they began to do a couple of years later (1975 there being discernible signs of it, and by 1977 the cat was out of the bag, for Page at least, and also Bonham to some extent who just seemed to overcompensate by playing more ""over the top"" than on previous tours - leading to some fantastic executions of Moby Dick).

The thing to remember with this film is that it is a movie, and some of the stage performances are as much a fiction as the fantasy sequences.  It is apparent to anyone watching closely that occasionally the activity you are seeing on the screen does not match the sounds you are simultaneously hearing.  Quite a bit of it does match, but a fair amount of it does not.  The parts that do match, particularly some of Page's wizardry, are worth the price of admission (whatever this means) and are primarily why the movie gets 4 stars.  But it is tough to watch certain parts, as the idea that much of it was overdubbed in the studio is hard to get by.  This bothers me even more than some of the abrupt edits which definitely could have been done more smoothly (most notably during No Quarter and Whole Lotta Love).  Also the fantasy sequences in No Quarter and Dazed and Confused prevent us from seeing the display of some of the most amazing guitar sequences ever played.  Now I have heard that it has been said that they did not have complete video footage, and had to make do with what they had and thus could not match the audio to the video in many cases.  This might be true, but nonetheless, for a hardcore Zep fan like myself, it is frustrating and one gets the feeling they could  still have somehow done more to make it at least feel more authentic.

The thing about Zeppelin is they were experimenters on stage.  No two shows are alike in the sense that a Rush concert, or a Clapton show might be.  You can listen to ump-teen bootlegs and not find two shows that are even close to being identically performed.  The same songs would sometimes only vary slightly from night to night, but vary they would.  A great example of consecutive shows that are each markedly unique from each other are the Los Angeles shows from June of 1977 (6 nights in 7 days I think).  On what was an otherwise inconsistent tour, Zeppelin managed to string together a set of really fine performances over this week, and each show having something remarkably unique about it (or at least the three that I own are this way, but I have read reviews of the other three).

But back to experimenting - this is what made them the most interesting live band around.  The problem with experimenting on stage, is that, by definition, not all experiments work, but when they do the rewards are great.  The detractors like to focus on the times when they do not work.  However, claims that Page or Bonham are sloppy tend to focus on the rough spots a bit much, where they might be in unchartered musical territory, and ignore the other large portion of the time when what you are witnessing are almost supernatural displays of talent and precision playing - by all members of the band, Plant (vocally) and Jones included.

By the end of the 1973 tour when the film was shot, Zeppelin were clearly a bit worn out.  Page did his best to look and act like the rock-God he was, but it almost seems a bit forced or manufactured.  He seems much less relaxed than he does during other live performances I have seen, especially from before 1973.  But Zeppelin had painted themselves into a hole with the time frame of the filming.  Due to financial or other considerations, this film became something like a Zeppelin version of Operation Barbarossa - started too late and hoping for some good fortune.  What they got, however, were a series of average performances at the end of a tour that seemingly had lasted for 60 months.  So what was Page and Co. to do?  Well wave the magic wand of technology and try to make it better!

The fantasy sequences are revealing as to the band members' mentality.  The weakest of them is Plant's sword fight and maiden rescue.  His easy demeanor does give the feeling that this is how Plant spends his off days - consuming fungi in dark arboreal settings and then riding about saving maidens, all the while thinking of lyrics.  Jones' sequence is a bit more interesting, as his true Jeckyll and Hyde nature is revealed.  You always knew he had it, I mean no one can be in a band like Led Zep and really be so mild mannered underneath it all.  Page's sequence is cool, not because of the supremely trippy encounter with himself as the Hermit, which is actually a piece of great cinema, but because it proved that the fragile appearing Page was still in pretty good physical shape.  I mean I was concerned he was going to fall off that cliff he climbed up - seems kind of risky behavior if you ask me.  But the best sequence, without a doubt, is Bonham's.  That scene where he is revving up his car and then takes off, as all the while the drums are matching the activity of the engine, is just freaking amazing.  Seriously, this is the best piece of artistry that the movie had to offer (other than the artists themselves performing live on the stage of course).

I first saw the movie when I was 13 years old in 1982 at a midnight movie (back when you could smoke J's in the theater and no one cared).  It was like a religious experience for me.  And it will remain so for legions of hardcore Zep fans around the world.  And the video and sound production on the new film is far superior to the previous edition.  And the bonus tracks and other materials really round out the experience.  I just wish that the band was willing to give Zep fans a little more credit and just give us the real goods.  Unfortunately for every understanding fan, there is some jerk off who bemoans some flaw to the point of absurdity.  Just because Jimmy did not execute some reverse-arpeggiated pentatonic scale or something, perfectly...  (I do not even know if these are valid guitar terms - I play drums).  The truth is Page opened the door for all of the (mostly boring) blazing fast precision-meisters.  This is why guys like Satriani for example, feel compelled to record the live version of Dazed and Confused from TSRTS, and I must say it was pretty damn good (a friend made me listen to it against my will), but still missing something, a presence, if you will, that Page had that others lack.

The main thing that The Song Remains The Same reminds me of is that Zeppelin was about energy above all else.  This is not to say that Page did not have the natural talent of a Clapton or a Beck, but if he did not, he certainly made up for it in sheer will, determination, and energy.  The main reason why for at least a five year period, Page was the best guitarist on the planet, was this energy.  And this can be said of all the members of the band at this time.  So ignore my purist ramblings and go buy the damn thing.  Shut the blinds, grab a draught, turn up the speakers, and take the journey.  Nick nickf314@cox.net.

P.S. - one last bit of advice for first timers - this movie is rated PG most likely in no small part due to Robert Plant's member starring as the sixth member of the band (closely following Peter Grant).  It probably could have been rated R.  Unless you are real secure in your manhood, do not watch with your girlfriend (or maybe you should as she might get all wokred up - it's a coin flip). One of the most awkward moments of my adolescent years was forcing my Mom to watch the movie with me.  When the sixth man took center stage, there was an uncomfortable silence and I think I got up to make some popcorn.  >> I debated whether to add this comment, but hopefully it will do somebody some good...",1198713600,16,9713,4.427927927927928

292565,5,6300270424,"""The Song Remains The Same"" is an amazing DVD set, a classic. Plus now, you get an extra Bonus disc with rare live footage like the great ""Celebration Day"", ""The Ocean"", ""Over The Hills & Far Away"" (blistering solo!), ""Misty Mountain Hop"", and other rare, priceless behind-the-scened footage of the legendary Led Zeppelin. Guitarist Jimmy Page was on fire, the slickest he ever played or looked. The guy moves and plays like a demon, there is none cooler. Page is a true star and it couldn't be more obvious than on this DVD. The classic versions, killer vibe, and pure power brings back so many memories...""in the days of my youth"" indeed. I will always have a soft spot for TSRTS. There something special about Page's great tone on TSRTS, it is perfect, he was out to kill for sure. Check out Page's fluid as lightning 12-string solo on the title track ""The Song Remains The Same"", then scratch your head at how someone could play this good. Then check his guitar solo on ""Stairway To Heaven"", as this version is famously known for what is perhaps the most killer, tastiest improv guitar work ever laid down, live or studio. Doubt me? Listen to it and it is obvious this isn't a normal band. Watch Page coax razor-sharp, soaring, crystal-clear sounds out of his Theremin on ""Whole Lotta Love"", you just don't see other bands pulling off cool stuff like this. John Paul Jones's bass lines are incredible, this guy is about the hottest bassist you will ever encounter, I guarantee you, his clarity, groove, spontaneity, fluidness, and speed are unequalled in the rock world, as is John Bonham's legendary drum work. Bonzo's speed, dynamics, creativity, musicality, and power is immense. His cymbal work is also extremely refreshing. And Plant's power and range matches the music like no other vocalist can. But musicians know this. Talk about red-hot improvs!! All the naysayers whining about an edit or two are completely missing the point. Ignore them, they know not what real rock and roll is, trust me.

All in all, a must-have for any Zeppelin fan. If you like rock and roll and don't dig at least some of music on ""The Song Remains The Same"", you may need a cat scan to check for brain damage, and also recommend an immediate hearing test at your local ear doctor. The live improv jams here are to die for, the seemingly endless barrage of rapid-fire, catchy, classy, tasty riffs and improvs from all the players seem almost inhuman in their intensity and quality. Page keeps coming at you like a machine, and has thrown away more great riffs in an afternoon than most bands base their entire careers on. These guys were the kings of fearless live improvisation, while still being expertly structured as well. They had it all. The sound mix is killer. Put on Bonzo's lightning-fast drum triplets at the end of ""Rock & Roll"", crank it, and be prepared to clean you tongue off when it hits the floor. Bonzo is so fiercely fast and powerful it is scary. Same goes for Jimmy Page's violin bow section on a spellbinding version of ""Dazed And Confused"", you've never seen a human being chop at an instrument like this. If you like rock and roll or music in general, get this now, it is that good.",1198368000,4,3196,4.656637168141593
292566,3,6300270424,"As most long time Zeppelin fans, I was extremely eager to get my hands on the remsatered SRTS.  After the fantastic jobs that Jimmy Page and his crew did with the Zeppelin DVD, and How the West Was One, I was ready for something sonically exceptional.

The results were mixed.  The concert sound is clearly improved on the remastered SRTS. But despite the decent performances, the Zeppelin energy that was so present on the early shows in the DVD and on How the West Was One are clearly lacking.  I guess studio magic can only do so much! And it highlights how good Zep could be when they were on!  The additional footage, although fantastic to watch, really highlights that's Plant's voice was in trouble. Compare the versions of The Ocean and Over the Hills and Far away between the SRTS New York show and the earlier HTWWW LA show!

Nontheless, the Song Remains the Same, is the Song Remains the Same - it hasn't changed since I first watched it at as teenager at a late night theatre back in the late 70's.  It's not perfect, but it sure sounds a lot nicer! And is a heck of a lot of fun to watch.

I have a bigger beef with the remastered soundtrack however! The same edits/cuts prevelent in the film (some annoying ones all over the place - No Quarter, Dazed and Confused, Whole Lotta Love), were thankfully, never part of the original soundtrack.  In No Quarter, during the key board solo, there is a delightful break after Bonzo enteres on drums, where Page plays a nice background riff for a minute before his solo.  It's gone on the new soundtrack!  Equal issue before the thermin section of Whole Lotta Love.  I don't know why the Soundtrack couldn't have remained as a better record of the shows.  It didn't need to match the movie 100%.  I prefer the old Soundtrack, even though it omits Black Dog, Over the Hills, etc.

I had a similar beef with the BBC session. Little 3 to 5 second bits of songs were edited out - still sounded nice - but for us bootleg collectors, we knew those BBC recordings like the back of our hands!  It was a shame to seem the needlessley altered.

In closing, if you don't have a copy of the SRTS, go out and get it.  If your're die hard Zep, you have to get it anyway.  My suggestion though, don't get the Soundtrack!  Stick with the original!",1198368000,,2285,4.395238095238096

Sure it is dated and the ""dream"" sequences may be a little much, but listen to the haunting vocals on Dazed while it rolls through 5.1 surround system and tell me Zep wasn't masters of mixing and live performance.

292571,1,6300270424,"As a lifelong Led Zeppelin fan, the proposition of an expanded and remastered Song Remains The Same was very exciting and of course I opted for this, the ""collectors edition"" rather than the standard DVD edition and that is where the problems started. First of all I should say that the remastered soundtrack is superb, much better than the original, also some of the extra's are entertaining but hardly essential. My first real disappointment however was with the additional songs; if you have the Led Zeppelin ""DVD"" then you pretty much have all the bonus music already and rather than include them in sequence as the band would have played them (as they have done on the audio soundtrack CD), they are just stuck on disc two in no particular order. Now we come to the package...APPALLING BEYOND BELIEF! Firstly the outer box is not even worth keeping, it's like a breakfast cereal carton, really thin. Inside there is a T-Shirt which is the poorest and cheapest quality shirt I've ever seen, it's not even made of cotton, it's some kind of synthetic hybrid which will no doubt last one wash. Now that we have removed the shirt, the DVD's are rolling around inside the breakfast cereal carton, pull them out and they are housed in another thin fold out affair that creases if you breath a little too heavily on it. The discs are accompanied by a handful of pointless postcards with poor quality stills from the film and imitation invites to premiere showings printed on them. To be honest I don't believe that Pagey knows anything about this release, as he is known for his quality control regarding Led Zeppelin's output and I would advise anyone wanting to buy the new version of the film just to get the regular packaged 2 disc set. If you are new to the band, ignore anybody who tells you that this film is self indulgent, these performances while not Zeppelin at their very best, are still a vital document of one of the greatest and most influential bands of all time.

292602,4,6300270424,"Well since I didn't score tickets for tonight's Led Zep London gig, I did the next best thing and watched the remastered DVD of the NYC concert ""The Song Remains the Same.""

Having recently just seen 2/3rds of the Yardbirds at the July '07 Chicago ""Crossroads Guitar Festival"" where Eric Clapton and Jeff Beck stole the show, I watched the Madison Square Garden 'Zep disc with those performances in mind. (BTW, I enjoyed Row 5 center floor seats for Zeppelin's July 7, 1973 gig in Chicago, just a couple weeks before the filmed 7/27-29 NYC dates.)

I have to say that Pagey has not aged well in comparison to his former Yardbirds comrades. In TSRTS concert, he is quite the technician, fast and agile and confident playing the limited repertoire of looping frantic riffs that he favors.

With the exception of ""Since I've Been Loving You,"" Page seems disconnected from the blues roots that are still so richly evident when you listen to Beck and Clapton today.

Pagey's last major tour as a sideman with The Black Crowes should be a warning for any idealistic Zep reunion fans. It was not pretty. And Plant still regrets the silly travesty of the UnLedded joke.

I hope Robert will pass on the obscenely lucrative profiteering of a full-blown Zeppelin worldwide junket and just stay true to his muse by touring this Spring with Allison Krauss.

On his best night at his present age, Pagey no longer has the mojo to play like he once did, and nobody wants to see the legendary Zep magic defiled by a tragic charade.",1197072000,,1514,4.651685393258427

292639,4,6300270424,"I was really excited when I heard about this reissue/remaster, especially the extra material and improvement of the audio. For 30 years this film has been a mixed blessing/curse of great live playing and poor film making, bad editing choices and worse wigs. The excellent DVD release of 2003 gave me hope and I thought JP and Co. would finally do it justice, by giving us more complete, less chopped up performances. While this reissue is nicely done, especially the remastered sound, I think it could have been so much better.
For example, the inclusion of additional songs is great but frustrating.
While it's great to finally see the omitted songs performed, the quick cut editing is so frequent that I feel like I'm watching a video produced for VH-1 rather than a concert performance. WTF!... Do they think that most people don't have the attention span to watch Jimmy Page actually play a solo from start to finish? I don't know, maybe garbage pop culture has changed the way we experience live music on film too much. I can understand filling in missing gaps with other footage but this is extreme.
There's a cut like every 1/2 second!
I think many of us also hoped that we might have the option of watching the actual performances rather than the fantasy sequences; the solos on No Quarter, Dazed and Moby Dick I could watch over and over but, as for for the fantasy sequences, once is enough! Legal reasons or whatever, alas, it was not to be. We still have to sit through lame acting and silly drama (except for Bonzo's unpretentious scenes). It always irks me that people talk so much about how great a band is/was and then they do a film to show how great the band is/was and then they don't just simply show the band playing! I disagree with the description on the insert...this is ""not"" the version fans have been waiting for. That version would be a Director's Cut with the concert footage only, in original performance order.
Ultimately, despite the old and new flaws, it's still nice to have the improved quality print and sound as well as the extras.

292640,5,6300270424,"In a current Guitar World interview, Jimmy Page explains why this film has always had ""sync"" problems.

Per Jimmy, after the MSG concert, they looked at the footage and realized that the director ""missed"" certain parts of the performances, and that they actually needed more footage.

So they later set up a replica of the MSG stage in a controlled environment and filmed the band lip-syncing and ""playing along"" with the film soundtrack to get the required footage.  However, according to Jimmy, it was difficult for him to accurately mimic what he actually played at the concert because a lot of it was improvised on the spot at MSG.

So that's why there were sync problems between the performances and the visuals.  Per Jimmy, on this release, they were unable to change even a single frame of the film, but they were able to tweak the sound to make it match better.

This release is definitely an improvement and this is the best this film has ever looked.  The sound is great and the four bonus live tracks on the second disk are wonderful, especially ""Over the Hills"".

Zep is great but I think it's an un-even film that spends too much time on the local NY flavor and fantasy sequences.  Heck, the live concert doesn't even begin until chapter six!  The fantasy sequences of course are pretty dated by now, and it all makes one wish that they had included just the concert performances on a seperate disk without all the other stuff.

292699,5,6300270424,"This 1976 concert film is one Led Zeppelin item that really did deserve to be improved and expanded. In the November 2007 glut of new Zep products related to the film, this 2-DVD set is clearly the optimal purchase. (Note that this review was written after actually purchasing and consuming the item in question, which appears to be a real rarity so far.) The ""Collector's Edition"" DVD set adds merchandise that will only be of value to super-diehards, and the new edition of the soundtrack album is apparently built around the new remaster of the movie itself and displays some odd editing choices. I have always felt that the purely audio soundtrack of the movie suffers from the lack of visuals - for example, all 27 minutes of ""Dazed and Confused"" makes more sense visually because you can watch the theatricality of Jimmy Page's stage performance, while merely listening to the accompanying soundtrack can be tedious. To a lesser extent, the same goes for the extra lengthy ""Moby Dick"" because while soloing, John Bonham could be even more enjoyable to watch than to listen to. So the film itself is the apotheosis of the entire ""The Song Remains the Same"" project, and this 2-DVD set presents much needed improvements in audio and video quality, with some bonus items that add value for the enthusiastic fan without becoming obsessive.

Though I'm a lifelong Zep fan, I actually hadn't seen this movie in around 20 years. And I had forgotten how cheesy the non-concert footage truly is, with the fantasy sequences serving as little more than period vanity pieces that rarely rise above the amateurish. But who cares, because the concert sequences are stupendous, and in this DVD set they have been presented for maximum aural and visual impact (yes these two shows weren't the band's best, but they were still light years beyond most other rock acts). As for the DVD extras, the interviews and news segments have some curiosity value, but the true goodies are the extra concert sequences. We finally have official video for the blistering performance of ""Celebration Day,"" which was always my favorite from the old original soundtrack album. Other bonuses include ""Misty Mountain Hop,"" though the uncoordinated performance of this song deserved to be left out of the original film; plus a surprisingly heavy take on ""Over the Hills and Far Away.""

For many years the original movie and soundtrack were the only (official) live Zep documents available. For the real live goods, we now have the 2003 CD package ""How the West Was Won"" and the 2003 self-titled DVD set, which are considerably more hard-hitting and far-reaching than ""The Song Remains the Same."" But even though it's no longer the definitive live document, fans have long deserved an improved version of the film. For all but the most obsessive collectors, the 2-DVD set is the way to go.

On the negative side however, unfortunately they decided to put the edited songs from the new soundtrack of the movie (done to match the visuals of the film) on to the CD?? This was just plain lazy and insulting. This wasn't even done back in 76!! There should have been no limit to what they could have put on the CDs. They didn't have to match the audio to the film footage so they should have re-mastered the best available performances, in their entirety, from all the available 73 Madison Square Garden shows into one complete show on a 3 CD set! Instead they just did a direct transfer from the re-mastered Movie and new songs on DVD II to the CD in the original running order of the concert (this is why I give four stars instead of five for the CD and Five stars for the DVD). Back in 76 They chose better song versions for the album then what was in the movie because they could, and some of these performances are possibly their very best live versions of some of these songs and far better than the ones on this current CD or DVD (for instance compare this new version CD/DVD to the older version Song Remains the Same CD/Album of Celebration Day which had Page's greatest realized live guitar solo ever for this song and then compare the older audio version of the middle section and Jimmy's guitar passage/solo on No Quarter to this new version. There is absolutely no comparison and this was arguably one of Page's greatest live solos ever-bold statement I know but true- , and the comparisons of whole lotta love from new to the old CD/album is an absolute joke! All of these old versions are now completely lost in this new shuffle as a few examples- Inexcusable!! Hang on to the old CD/Album!) .

This all being said, we must appreciate that Zeppelin is even trying to fix up and put out some of their priceless material officially and with superior sound these days (for profit or not). So in summary the performances we do have here are different from the ones released in 76. The new additions are greatly welcomed, the sound is better across the board, However some of these new versions of songs are not even close to as good as the old album versions that were some of the best live Zeppelin realizations of these songs ever and that have now been lost. Overall though we are talking about Led Zeppelin during their peak tour and of some of there best performances ever (proven in detail below!!). This alone will hopefully and finally put these incredible performances in their deserving historical place, perspective and give them their do justice. This brings me to my next important point.

Don't listen to the negative reviewers calling themselves Zeppelin fans. I can tell from what many have written that they don't know Jack squat about Zeppelin or what they were like live throughout their career. They are merely clowns dressed in sheep's clothing wanting to hear themselves talk about something they know very little about (their extravagantly large red floppy shoes give them away).

Led Zeppelin has been my favorite band for the past 29 years and I have read, studied and listened to their entire career (every tour of live performances included) in depth. I will tell you in simple chapter and verse that this show (culmination of shows at Madison Square Garden at the end of their 1973 tour) is incredibly underrated and has been horribly misrepresented and maligned over the years by a few people that are full of hot air. I don't care how many of these sheople/clowns try to say that these were sub par performances (even Page himself has tried to insinuate this for unknown reasons in the past and at other times he has claimed otherwise), I'm here to tell you, as an actually well educated die hard Zeppelin fan, it is absolutely not true!! This has just been self perpetuating opinions over the years from hot winded nobodies that really don't know what the hell they're talking about following along with what a few other people have said before them.

Back in the day (1976 and forward) when this movie and the soundtrack were actually released it was one of the most popular live albums and movies (midnight movies) on the market. It was constantly listened to, watched, talked about and absolutely revered by music heads and fans throughout my junior high and high school days in southern California-all the way into the early eighties (It still played at the Midnight Movie into the early 80's!). I have listened to all the great unreleased live Zep performances and proclaimed greatest Zep shows and I have to yell, from the mountain top to all, that these performances from The Song Remains the Same of: ""Dazed and Confused (the old album/cd version)"", ""No Quarter"" (the old album/cd version), ""The song remains the same"", ""The Rain Song"", ""Celebration Day"" (the old soundtrack/cd version), ""Stairway to Heaven"", ""Whole lotta love (the old album/cd version)"" and the recent release of ""The Ocean"" are still some of the best, if not ""The"" best live versions of these songs ever -period!!

To categorically back this opinion up here's a brief, ""true"" story, of the actual live history of Led Zeppelin for those who would like to learn a little something:

(1968-1970) Led Zeppelin live from 1968 to 1970 was powerful, fierce, raw and unlike anything that anyone had ever heard or seen. Zeppelin during this time toured around the world constantly, devastating audiences and honing their skills and musical catalog along the way. They were new, hungry and building a loyal live and album (Zeppelin I, II, and III) following as they blew everyone away in their path. However, instrumentally the band was still developing. Plants voice was incredible and the Rhythm engine of Bonham and Jones was amazing and would never disappoint throughout Zeppelin's career yet they were still young and developing their craft. As incredible as Page was at that time he was still in progress as a guitarist, as a musical visionary, in his image/stage presence, and in his eventual forge into musical territory that had never been blazed before. Page was also still in his climb to becoming the ultimate guitar legend/hero and the unequalled technical and most innovative guitar player of his time. This pinnacle wouldn't be achieved by Mr. Page until 1971 and through 1973 (this can be witnessed from unofficial live recordings between 1971 and 1973 or from ""How the West Was Won"" 1972). The Concerts from 68 to 70, put into proper historical perspective, are absolutely amazing relative to everything else at the time yet the band as a whole and the material had not reached its next or ultimate level. Page had a vision and he was about to lead himself and this band to greater heights than any guitarist or band had ever achieved.

(1971-1972) Led Zeppelin reached a level of frightening instrumental machinery by 1971. The band members had all honed their skills from countless live performances and non stop touring and recording from 68 onward to the point of perfection as individual musicians and as a cohesive musical unit (Each member of Zeppelin would later be considered one of the very best musicians/vocalists for each of their individual crafts across the board). Zeppelin continued to hone this musical power and devastating musical machinery conquering all audiences in their path around the world during their 71 and 72 tours (as ""How the West Was Won"" can attest from 1972 and any other recordings you can find from 71 to 72). This was Led Zeppelin at their instrumental best. Their reputation was larger, their audiences were larger, as was their catalog of styles and songs to choose from (Now touring behind the fourth biggest selling album of all time!!- Zeppelin IV). At this time they had honed their stage presence, their cohesiveness and their individual musical prowess to a point that would never be equaled again in their career. Plants voice reached its peak in this era. He would never sing with as much range, control, power or clarity again and along with Pages peak of sheer virtuosity, speed, fluidity, and confidence of playing they had no equals in the rock world instrumentally during this era. Jones and Bonham never failed as one of the very best rhythm sections in rock throughout the Zeppelin Career. Jones and Bonham were always able to match what was coming from the front men, to play up or play down to whatever was coming from Page and Plant. Zeppelin were four pistons in perfect harmony by 71 - 72 and performances from this era can only be described as ferocious, devastating and mind blowing to audiences around the world. Zeppelin's legend, popularity and live reputation had been solidified here.

(1973) The 1973 tour can only be defined as Superstardom. This tour was huge, electric and the band was revered as nothing short of gods at this time. This was Led Zeppelin riding their reputation of being the most successful rock band in the world in record sales, their recording catalog (now incorporating the great ""Houses of the Holy""), and from their legend as a live act that they had developed through countless tours up to 1972. The 1973 world tour broke box office attendance records and would be the pinnacle of Zeppelin live as far as their stage persona, rock star status/mystique, catalog of albums/songs to choose from, their realization of their live song structures, the size of venues and audiences, and their ability to still be able to capture the tail end of their absolute instrumental power and peak and play at the top of their game. This was Zeppelin at their most electric -The world's biggest rock stars, flying around in their own private jumbo jet to the world's biggest sellout shows and venues. Plants voice had changed by this tour and did not quite have the power, range or clarity of 1972, Jimmy Page at this time was considered the greatest guitarist in the world and the pressure also began to show on him at times during this tour. Though the instrumental machinery had slowed down a bit, the prowess and power was still there for much of this tour. They were still at the top of their instrumental game more times than not and the band also wielded a bigger legacy, legend, mystique and catalog of albums/songs to choose from. The band had also refined the set list and the structure of live versions of songs to their most realized and refined at this stage of their live career. Also, Zeppelin's further developed rock star stage presence/energy of 73 combined with the energy of the 73 audiences was never at a higher level. This magic chemistry mixed with all the reasons given above gives you some of the most satisfying and quintessential Zeppelin performances of all time. When people think of Zeppelin live in the prime of their career, the 1973 version of Zeppelin is what most people envision. Now to my point about the Song Remains the Same.

I have heard many performances from the 1973 tour and there may be shows with more energy or have certain versions of songs that are unsurpassed yet there are truly very few moments from any other 73 Zeppelin shows that rival many of the songs captured at the end of this tour at Madison Square Garden for the ""Song Remains the Same"". For instance: Rock and Roll, Celebration Day (the old CD/album version), The Song Remains the Same, The Rain Song, No Quarter (the old version), Dazed and Confused, Stairway to Heaven and Whole Lotta Love (the old CD/album version). These are hands down some of the best realized and performed versions of these songs captured live anywhere and from any time-period!

(1975) Led Zeppelin didn't tour again until 1975 (it had been two years!). The Led Zeppelin 1975 tour was a tour of great imagery, mystery and anticipation for audiences that had built Zeppelin up into something beyond legend or even as gods. However, this popularity, the resultant pressure and drug use over the years (mostly by Jimmy and Drinking by Bonzo), and the long lay off from touring had taken its toll on the greatest live band of all time. As Composers and song writers their legacy was still only growing due to their incredible double album released this same year (touring on Physical Graffiti - arguably their greatest album ever), and their imagery from this tour is at times unequalled due to the famous ""black dragon suite"" warn by Page, the even longer hair worn by Plant and Page, and the larger stage shows (the first time use of lasers even-a new effect for the time) during this tour etc. However, the band was older, slower and had lost some of its instrumental prowess and pure power machinery that they once had. Plants voice was far removed from the quality it once had only 2 years prior. Page was now battling with a heroin addiction that took its toll from show to show on his guitar playing that only two years prior seemed to be unstoppable and was unequaled from 71-73. This tour was marked by some magic shows that were unfortunately the exception and not the rule at some of their favorite haunts such as Long Beach, The LA Forum, MSG and moments at the end of the tour during their stand at Earls Court in England. Although many magic moments were captured, the shows were instrumentally slower, less technically proficient, and lacked the energy and power that Zeppelin once controlled. Things would never be the same for Led Zeppelin ever again.

(1977) Led Zeppelin toured America for the last time in 1977. Zeppelin hadn't toured since 75 and the lay off again showed more times than not. There were again some magical shows and moments, most notably at certain stands at the bands favorite stomping grounds such as: The LA Forum, Long Beach and Madison Square Garden once again. Their reputation and audiences were larger than life itself at this time. Tragically however, Jimmy Page was battling some serious drug addictions, most notably his heroin addiction. Pages playing could go from close to his hey day of 71-73 to absolutely embarrassing from night to night. There were shows when you wondered if page could even hold up his guitar, much less play it. Plants voice was at times actually better than in the 1975 tour yet the performances as a whole could be shaky with a few high lighted exceptional shows along the way. The band was blowing audiences away at this time from pure reputation and status. Much like the Beatles making audience members pass out without even playing a note back in the 60s. Listening to performances from the 1977 tour, you have to really search to find a few great shows from this tour that can even compare to the power and virtuosity of Zeppelin between 71 and 73. This tour was also cut short due to the tragic death of Robert Plant's son.

(1979-1980) Zeppelin would not play again until they played two warm up shows in Copenhagen Denmark in 1979 in preparation for their two huge festival shows at Knebworth in 79 and then the final European shows in 1980 before Bonham's death. Continued Drug addiction and lay offs only further steered the once mighty Zep downward. Although the band gave it their best effort and put up some very admirable fights (shows), none of these shows can truly compare to the power and devastation these four highly tuned pistons could pump out back in 73 and prior to 70/71.

This brings us back to why these Madison Square Garden shows at the peak of the overall greatest band in the world's career and possibly some of the peaks of the 73 tour itself are so, so priceless and underappreciated. Don't listen to the naysayers (remember, look for their large floppy red shoes) and now go and listen to these treasured performances from the hands down greatest Rock Band of all time with fresh ears, a new perspective and with complete reverence my friends! Maybe in the future we can only hope for a complete best of performance from the entire stand at Madison Square Garden 73 in a full, uncut 3 CD set. Until that time however, we should all appreciate that Zeppelin is at least finally trying to put some of their priceless, timeless material, that has been locked away and hidden in their vaults for all these many years, out to the public over the past few years. Keep it coming and thank you!",1195776000,11,16351,4.737008426966292
292702,3,6300270424,"In 1976 Led Zeppelin released The Song Remains The Same. This is Led Zeppelin's much loved and much criticized performances pieced together from three Madison Square Garden Shows at the end of their record breaking 1973 tour. I have always had a love hate relationship with this show as its not Led Zeppelin at its best yet like all Led Zeppelin shows has some great moments. There is great interplay and improvisation in No Quarter and Dazed and Confused which for me personally are my favorite live versions of these songs. On the other hand you have a raw and weak voiced Robert Plant and shoddy camera work which left gaps in song which required fantasy sequences by all the members which are both funny and tedious. Yet I bought the 2DVD re-mastered version and was it worth it you ask?

Yes it was. The re-mastering job by Page was phenominal. The audio is much more vibrant and crisper. John Bonham's prototype kick drum gets the sound it deserves and Page's leads and solos can be heard in all their fiery glory. Even Plant who is the weak point of this show sounds better and not so raw throat sounding. Let us not forget John Paul Jones the unsung hero of the band whose marvelous bass sound comes through much better and No Quarter is my favorite part of this movie and his fantasy sequence certainly matches up well with the song. Other highlights include getting to hear Over the Hills and Far Away for the first time  and seeing Celebration Day played live on the DVD. Page's violin solo is fantastic and turned up loud in 5.1 is smoking.

The Song Remains the Same is Led Zeppelin at its best and worst yet vital to the Zeppelin catalogue and a must for fans. Get it for the superb re-mastering and picture. I was really let down when I first watched this having heard all of Led Zeppelin's albums as a 16 year old kid in 1990 yet at 33 I feel this movie got a much deserved make over which I enjoyed. If you want Led Zeppelin at its best get the 2DVD set Led Zeppelin. If you enjoy the self indulgence of 1970's Rock and Roll then The Song Remains the Same is the epitome of those times. Led Zeppelin has brought so much joy to my life that other than my wife I could never imagine a day without this passionate band and the timeless music. Right now is a great time to be a Zeppelin fan.",1195776000,5,2304,4.3534883720930235
292703,5,6300270424,"Wow ,Not only does this prove Led Zeppelin to still be the #1 best band ever ,but there so far ahead of who ever is #2 . The Sound is crystal clear . The peformance is great . Thank god for Led Zeppelin .",1195689600,4,204,3.659090909090909
292704,5,6300270424,"Because of legalities involving the director of the film, the most that Pagey was able to do to alter this vintage concert film was to remix with Kevin Shirley, the sound for DOLBY 5.1 and DTS 5.1 and two-channel STEREO. Where this was really noticeable was in the stand-out tracks DAZED AND CONFUSED, WHOLE LOTTA LOVE, and the MOBY DICK drum solo.

Whether it is with the guitar and bow workout in DAZED AND CONFUSED or the Theramin ""Pit of Hell"" in WHOLE LOTTA LOVE -- Page and Kevin Shirley have been able to add many new dimensions to the sound mix. For example, the rear channels of the 5.1 system have an added new dimensionality to the sound and the overall ambience -- the original QUADRAPHONIC 4-channel mix from 1976 just didn't have the depth of field to sound the way Page intended, using today's advanced technology.

Even the cobbled-together 5.1 surround mix for the original DVD of TSRTS -- which was done without the supervision of audio producer extraordinaire Jimmy Page -- sounds sub-par and quite unsatisfying to my ears. This may be one of the reasons why this never got a fair shake from the group's worldwide fan base, and is largely detested by this selfsame group of people.

THE EXTRAS ...

The second DVD and the printed materials that have been included with this COLLECTOR'S EDITION provide some historical context -- such as the concert reviews, and the news article on the Drake Hotel robbery. Also included are invites and facsimile tickets to the films' theatrical premiere, two sets of lobby cards (one in color, the other set in b & w), a copy of the 1973 tour itinerary, and a t-shirt of unknown size -- which features the soundtrack artwork.

DVD # 2 contains some nice extras:

01) The remaining songs from the concert, which because of space limitations in 1976, were never included UNTIL NOW.

02) A TV news report from Tampa, Florida USA about their sold-out show there, which broke attendance and gross gate receipts established by The BEATLES August 15, 1965 Shea Stadium concert.

03) A nice BBC interview with Robert Plant and Peter Grant, as they ride aboard a boat on the Thames.

04) Extensive news footage on the Drake Hotel robbery, which was never solved, to the best of my memory.

05) A Cameron Crowe radio profile of the band. And, considering what he went on to do with his life, this is nice to have. [NOTE: Robert Plant's infamous ""I'm a Golden God!"" exclamation found its' way into Crowe's 2000 film ALMOST FAMOUS. This film has another Zeppelin connection. Crowe, in his 'director's cut' DVD of the film, the viewer is instructed on when to begin playing Stairway To Heaven at a certain point in a deleted scene. Crowe could not afford to pay to license the song, and it was up to the viewer to pull out their own copy of Led Zeppelin IV to reach full effect in this scene.]

All in all, a well-deserved update to an important musical artifact of the raucous 1970's.

The Led Zeppelin 1975 tour was a tour of great imagery, mystery and anticipation for audiences that had built Zeppelin up into something beyond legend or even as gods. However, this popularity, the resultant pressure and drug use over the years (mostly by Jimmy and Drinking by Bonzo), and the long lay off from touring had taken its toll on the greatest live band of all time. As Composers and song writers their legacy was still only growing due to their incredible double album released this same year (touring on Physical Graffiti - arguably their greatest album ever), and their imagery from this tour is at times unequalled due to the famous ""black dragon suite"" warn by Page, the even longer hair worn by Plant and Page, and the larger stage shows (the first time use of lasers even-a new effect for the time) during this tour etc. However, the band was older, slower and had lost some of its instrumental prowess and pure power machinery that they once had. Plants voice was far removed from the quality it once had only 2 years prior. Page was now battling with a heroin addiction that took its toll from show to show on his guitar playing that only two years prior seemed to be unstoppable and was unequaled from 71-73. This tour was marked by some magic shows that were unfortunately the exception and not the rule at some of their favorite haunts such as Long Beach, The LA Forum, MSG and moments at the end of the tour during their stand at Earls Court in England. Although many magic moments were captured, the shows were instrumentally slower, less technically proficient, and lacked the energy and power that Zeppelin once controlled. Things would never be the same for Led Zeppelin ever again.

(1977) Led Zeppelin toured America for the last time in 1977. Zeppelin hadn't toured since 75 and the lay off again showed more times than not. There were again some magical shows and moments, most notably at certain stands at the bands favorite stomping grounds such as: The LA Forum, Long Beach and Madison Square Garden once again. Their reputation and audiences were larger than life itself at this time. Tragically however, Jimmy Page was battling some serious drug addictions, most notably his heroin addiction. Pages playing could go from close to his hey day of 71-73 to absolutely embarrassing from night to night. There were shows when you wondered if page could even hold up his guitar, much less play it. Plants voice was at times actually better than in the 1975 tour yet the performances as a whole could be shaky with a few high lighted exceptional shows along the way. The band was blowing audiences away at this time from pure reputation and status. Much like the Beatles making audience members pass out without even playing a note back in the 60s. Listening to performances from the 1977 tour, you have to really search to find a few great shows from this tour that can even compare to the power and virtuosity of Zeppelin between 71 and 73. This tour was also cut short due to the tragic death of Robert Plant's son.

(1979-1980) Zeppelin would not play again until they played two warm up shows in Copenhagen Denmark in 1979 in preparation for their two huge festival shows at Knebworth in 79 and then the final European shows in 1980 before Bonham's death. Continued Drug addiction and lay offs only further steered the once mighty Zep downward. Although the band gave it their best effort and put up some very admirable fights (shows), none of these shows can truly compare to the power and devastation these four highly tuned pistons could pump out back in 73 and prior to 70/71.

This brings us back to why these Madison Square Garden shows at the peak of the overall greatest band in the world's career and possibly some of the peaks of the 73 tour itself are so, so priceless and underappreciated. Don't listen to the naysayers (remember, look for their large floppy red shoes) and now go and listen to these treasured performances from the hands down greatest Rock Band of all time with fresh ears, a new perspective and with complete reverence my friends! Maybe in the future we can only hope for a complete best of performance from the entire stand at Madison Square Garden 73 in a full, uncut 3 CD set. Until that time however, we should all appreciate that Zeppelin is at least finally trying to put some of their priceless, timeless material, that has been locked away and hidden in their vaults for all these many years, out to the public over the past few years. Keep it coming and thank you!",1195689600,10,16356,4.737008426966292
292706,5,6300270424,"I would like to share something that may help you understand and appreciate this film even more.  First, please understand that I am a huge Zeppelin fan.  I never got to see the band in concert but I own all of their albums (in LP and CD form) and listen to them often.  I received the new DVD about a week ago.  I had not seen this movie before so the first time I watched it, I was a little confused about the various non-concert segments.  I found a short but effective explanation of the band's ""fantasy sequences,"" which I have copied below.  Now that I understand what the band members were trying to achieve, I appreciate the film more.  Personally, I would not have included the clips about the money being stolen or the rude scene where Peter Grant cusses out the MSG guys (about some counterfeit posters) BUT I would not let these small things keep you from enjoying the most important part of the film, which are the music and the performances.

There are dozens of incredible solos throughout the film but I would like to point out one in particular that blew me away and is very easy to miss.  It is Jimmy's guitar work in No Quarter.  This is the song that contains John Paul's fantasy sequence.  This particular solo comes in the middle of that sequence so you don't SEE Jimmy playing it; you have to listen for it.

Anyway, I hope this helps.  The older I get the more I appreciate the great music we got during the early 70's.  I feel fortunate to have lived during those great years.  I also appreciate the fact that we can still enjoy these amazing performances more than 30 years later.  Rock on.

ABOUT THE FANATSY SEQUENCES

With an intention to give an insight into the individual personalities in the band, several out-of-concert 'fantasy sequences' were shot by Massot for each of the band members, in addition to Peter Grant and tour manager Richard Cole. The sequences are as follows:

Peter Grant (left) and Richard Cole Massot originally shot Grant walking a cameraman around a collection of antique cars, but this footage was quickly abandoned. Instead, Grant and Cole were filmed as hitmen driving towards Hammerwood Park estate in Sussex in a 1928 Pierce-Arrow car. Roy Harper also makes an uncredited guest appearance as one of the 'greedy millionaires' portrayed at a business meeting of multi-national corporations. Massot envisioned Grant and Cole in the hitman roles, as it symbolised the tough business decisions they made on behalf of the band. The female passenger wearing a scarf with Peter Grant driving on a country road is his wife, Gloria.

John Paul Jones was filmed first at home with his wife Mo, and reading Jack and the Beanstalk to his two daughters, Tamara and Jacinda, before receiving a call to join the band on their American concert. For his fantasy sequence, Jones initially wished to use footage from the original Doctor Syn film, but was prevented from doing so as this film was owned by Disney. Instead, his fantasy sequence involved a reinterpretation of the film. Jones portrays a masked gentleman known as ""The Scarecrow,"" who travels at night on horseback with three others and returns home to Sussex, an ordinary family man. The three other horsemen with him are a reference to the other band members. Jimmy Page's girlfriend, Charlotte Martin, and baby daughter Scarlet Page can be briefly seen during the closing moments of this sequence, which was filmed in October 1973. Thematic music: ""No Quarter"".

In his fantasy sequence, Robert Plant was captured relaxing on his Welsh country farm with his wife Maureen, and children Karac and Carmen. His fantasy sequence involves him being a knight rescuing a fair maiden (played by Virginia Parker), who is a symbolic representation for his vision of the ideal - his personal search for the Holy Grail. Scenes from the sword fight were filmed at Raglan Castle in Wales while the sailing, horseback riding and beach scenes were shot at Aberdovey then Merionethshire and now Gwynedd, in October 1973. Thematic music: ""The Song Remains the Same"" and ""The Rain Song"".

Jimmy Page is filmed sitting by a lake next to his 18th century manor at Plumpton, Sussex, playing a hurdy gurdy. The tune played is called ""Autumn Lake"" and the scene was filmed in October 1973. Page's fantasy role involved climbing up the face of a snow capped mountain near Boleskine House, Loch Ness during the nights of a full moon on December 10 and 11, 1973. The act was meant to show man fighting his way to the top, only to be greeted by The Hermit on the untitled fourth album. Thematic music: ""Dazed and Confused"".

John Bonham was shot with his wife Pat and son Jason Bonham on their country estate, Old Hyde Farm in Worcestershire. It is interesting to note that part of his fantasy includes him spending time at home with his family. Bonham was known for falling into deep depressions while on tour away from his family. His heavy drinking, which ultimately resulted in his death, is usually attributed to his homesickness. The game of pool was shot at The Old Hyde Hotel and the Harley-Davidson riding near Blackpool. His fantasy sequence is the most straightforward of all the members, with Bonham drag racing an AA Fueler at 260mph at Santa Pod Raceway, Wellingborough, Northants, UK, in October 1973. Thematic music: ""Moby Dick"".

Yes, Plant had lost a bit of his primal howl (but not at the end of 'Whole Lotta Love', that is just ferocious...), and that late-60s energy had dimished a touch, sure (those BBC shows are out of control, just astonishing). And yea, Bonham got better and better, so that by the time Plant and Page were spent in the late-70s, he was on a whole different planet (so sad). Sloppiness? If anyone has the secret non-sloppy Zep recordings, I'd love to hear them. I LOVE their mess, that's one of the many things that makes them so special. They jumped and fell and jumped again. Anyway, here is when they were all alive and happy, mature and graceful but not too burnt yet, just on top of the world. There are too many moments to count, but the interplay between JPJ and Bonham in the uptempo theremin bit in 'Whole Lotta Love', and just the band energy they all have for that whole tune, that is the zenith of Zeppelin.",1195603200,6,1005,4.408602150537634

292740,3,6300270424,"I'm a Zeppelin freak. I own everything they've ever released. Probably twice. I bought this the minute I saw it.

Now I wish I hadn't.

The T-Shirt inside is very thin and not at all an XL as it states on the tag. If it were an XL, I'd wear it with pride. As it is, my wife can wear it. (What kind of material is that, anyway -- gossamer?)

But once the T-Shirt is removed...

That's where the problem with the packaging comes into play.

The T-Shirt is what held the DVDs and the extras in the box, which is a very thin cardboard to begin with. Take the T-Shirt out and you have a large space in the box. When you put back the DVDs, they rattle around in the box.

If you take them out of the box, they're packaged in their own little sleeve, but the cardboard of the sleeve is very thin, too. If it was a heavier slipcase-like cardboard, it would be okay. But it's not. It barely stands up on its own. By the way, one item in the sleeve is the 2-DVD set. The other item in the sleeve holds the bonus materials. But, together, they're only 1-1/4"" deep. The box is 2"" deep. The T-Shirt took up the remaining 3/4"" to make the box full.

So, okay, minus the T-Shirt and despite the wafer-thin cardboard, what do we have left? What are the bonus materials?

Again, no great shakes. There are numerous postcards (most pictures are blurry and oddly cropped) and movie promotional items, plus a couple of other pieces of colored cardboard meant to look like tickets. Big deal. Interesting, perhaps even cool. But worth another $10-$20 over the price of the 2-DVD set by itself? You be the judge.

So, okay, minus the T-Shirt, despite the wafer-thin cardboard, and aside from the assortment of passable postcards and promotional items for the movie, what's in the box?

When all is said and done, what's really in the box that I care about is the 2-DVD set of the remastered The Song Remains the Same concert (one DVD is the concert, the other DVD is bonus materials) -- which, last time I looked, was only $13.99 on Amazon. So the Zep movie not only costs less, but the standard 2-DVD set of the remastered The Song Remains the Same is a traditional DVD box. In other words, it's sturdy. It'll stand on your shelf without falling over, getting crushed, or scuffed up. And to watch it, you don't have to yank apart a box, fumble around for the slipcase, extract it, and then attempt to get it back in when you're done -- all without further damaging the cardboard. Sounds like a losing proposition to me.

In short, although the remastered The Song Remains the Same movie is outstanding  (and the 2-CD audio set is stunning!), this Collector's Edition DVD set is flimsy, not well thought out and surprisingly unspectacular. I didn't get the ""Wow!"" factor when I opened the box. I got the, ""Gee? Now what do I do with these parts now that the T-Shirt (which served as a spacer in the box) is removed?"" factor.

I say save your money on this Collector's Edition DVD set. Buy the remastered 2-DVD set of The Song Remains the Same instead. You'll get what's really important and you'll avoid the headache of trying to figure out how to carefully store the ""bonus"" items without damaging them.",1195516800,261,3181,4.417094017094017

No Quarter, The Song Remains The Same, Rain Song, Since I've Been Loving You, are all spectacular! And then there is Dazed And Confused; this song continued to grow and mature live just as the group did. The '73 edition is the pinnacle of that songs existence. In '75 although it was longer, it began to meander and loose focus. Dazed from this show is tight, moves gracefully from passage to passage, builds, releases and shows why Jimmy Page is a master craftsman.

of the group to be awful. Each to his own, but in my humble opinion - it is absolutely smoking... Page's guitar-work alone is some
of the most creative, melodic and powerful of his career.
His extended journeys on Dazed and Confused, and his solos elsewhere
blaze - several songs feature his rarely heard jazz-inflected harmonic side, neck-in-neck with typically fierce blues riffing
and angular lines..some of his most accurate playing as well. All this about the guitar! suffice to say, the singing,
bass, and drums add their own live-wire energy to the mix. The rhythm

In fact, the version of many of the songs are more enjoyable than the originals for me, especially (gasp) Stairway to Heaven.
The footage is grade A cheese, but so what? Is there no value in Jimmy Page and his devilishy horrible glowing red eyes or the bizarre mafia sequence or John Paul Jones scaring the crap out of his kids? As a special kick for Pittsburgh folk like myself, the opening sequence of the arrival at the airport and the supposed drive to the MSG show was actually footage from Pittsburgh and not NYC, so that always got a rousing cheer from us stoners at the Stanley Theater midnight showings.
This is a classic bit of raw rock and roll. It isn't studio wizardry, especially welcome coming from master producer and reknowned anal retentive control freak Jimmy Page. I still enjoy the charm of this movie despite the flaws. Live music is about more than perfection.

Then there was a year or two during my very early 20's when, far from home and terribly homesick, i couldn't go to sleep at night unless ""Stairway To Heaven"" (or Boston's ""Dust In the Wind"") was lulling me there via my trusy little red plastic portable tape deck.  I'll forever owe loyalty and homage to Led Zep for helping me get through that bleak time in my life.

Finally, my now-19-year-old daughter discovered and began listening to Zep when she was about 15.  Because 15-year old kids can only hear music if it's turned up high (i remembered that from when i was 15), i had Zep's music around a lot again, and through the magic of a heart and soul just discovering it for the first time, too.  Watching her joy in this ageless, timeless, ever-appealling and compelling music helped me fall in love with it all over again.

While i've learned that the song doesn't actually remain the same, it __does__ remain, and that's enough to get me here to fork out a fistful of cash in order to buy yet another ""new"" Led Zep Collector's Edition.

That's my story and i'm sticking to it.

""We have revisited 'The Song Remains The Same,'"" says Jimmy Page, ""and can now offer the complete set as played at Madison Square Garden. This differs substantially from the original soundtrack released in 1976, and highlights the technical prowess of Kevin Shirley, who worked with us on 'How The West Was Won.'

So, if you can afford to wait until November 2007 and have $35 to spend GET THAT RELEASE.

What I'm about to say has already been said, but I'd like a chance to say it, too.

For starters, this is a major upgrade.  My first impression in watching this would have to be:

""Jonesy can be heard!""

I think the most criminal aspect of the original release was that Jonesy was non-existent.  Even when he played the keyboards, you could only hear him if he was the only one playing.  As soon as Page came in, Jonesy was gone.  Hence, No Quarter just didn't sound that great.  But now, Jonesy is there in all his glory.  The bass can be heard quite well.  The keyboards can be heard.  Same is true also for the drums.  In the old footage, you got a lot of cymbal and snare and even a little high-tom, but you couldn't hear any of Bonzo's bass or low-toms.  Basically, in the old footage, it was all treble and no bass.  Now the mix is perfect, and the balance between treble and bass is perfect.

I also love the footage itself.  I am probably one of the rare Led Zeppelin fans who loves the fantasy/movie sequences.  The only sequence I think is rather stupid is Robert's.  It's cliche, sappy, and really just un-creative.  I would have hoped Robert could have come up with something more thought-provoking and imaginative.  I love Jimmy's different sequences, especially his main one, climbing up the mountain to the wizard, and Jonesy's sequence is really cool.  Bonzo's is the only other cliche one, but at least it isn't sappy.

The special features, to me, are really neat.  Though I admittedly can't understand this whole idea of legal issues that prevented them from tampering with THEIR MOVIE (caps for emphasis, not yelling :D).  I would have liked to see the songs put in their original running order.  Also, the exclusion of Thank You from the last night (I have the bootlegs, and it's a very good rendition) makes me kinda sad.

Now, onto the extra stuff:

The t-shirt is fine.  It's size is mis-labeled, but it isn't that small.  Trust me.  I'm 6 feet tall and 200 pounds, and I'm ashamed to admit that muscle comprises only a small percentage of that (something I am working on).  But the shirt fits me perfectly.  When you get this set, do NOT expect an extra large.  This shirt is no bigger than a large.  Keep that in mind and you'll be fine.

I am definitely looking forward to the poster, which I've already sent in for.  I love the pictures and the tickets, and even the paper article.  My only problems with these extras is that the only reviews they include are negative reviews.  Come on!  You can't tell me there wasn't one positive review of this movie when it came out.  You can't.

Now, I have listed some things that bother me, but I give this five stars because I love it, and because, in the end, I'm quite satisfied with what I got.  Ignore the nay-sayers, because they are not Led Zeppelin fans.  I have the majority of Led Zeppelin live recordings in existence, including studio sessions and all of their official releases (except for Mothership, which I'm still debating over).  I can tell you this is definitely a good performance from Zep.  It's no where near one of their best, but it's so far from their worst it's ridiculous.  This set is worth it.  Thank you, Led Zeppelin.",1188172800,,3512,4.790969899665551

292858,3,6300270424,"In some ways this film was rendered obsolete by the 2003 Led Zeppelin 2-disc dvd set, in terms of Led Zeppelin live on video. Shot at the end of the 1973 Houses of the Holy US Tour over several nights in Madison Square Garden, the Song Remains The Same had been shelved for a few years and only managed to get released when lead singer Robert Plant's car accident sidelined the band for a year. The concert footage finds the band a bit spaced out and exhausted at times in terms of the performances (although I suppose buggering daft teenage runaways and consuming vast quantities of booze, coke and smack will tend to do that to you); a nearly half-hour version of Dazed and Confused becomes particularly pondersome about 7 minutes in. Combined with the live footage were fantasy concept sequences, most of which appear to have been directed by 1st year film school students tripping on mescaline. Only John Bonhams really works well. Still, it is an unapologetic display of the debauchery, confidence and mystery that Zeppelin evoked at the time - just not really some of the band's best performances.",1175472000,2,1103,4.75
292859,5,6300270424,The Song Remanis the Same DVD - Super DVD - it Rocks!,1168300800,2,53,3.5
292860,5,6300270424,"What can you say about THE SONG REMAINS THE SAME--or Led Zeppelin for that matter--some 30 years after the film's release?  Everybody pretty much knows where he (or she, but let's be honest, we're mostly talking 'he's' here) stands on all things Zep. For those who never saw the band live (like me), it certainly gives you a taste of what that experience was like.  But then, I'm told that the DVD more recently compiled by Jimmy Page did a better job at that.

But still, this performance film/cum documentary/cum pre-MTV video fest captures an era in the group's history and our own in its own unique fashion.  I was never an ueber-fan, so maybe it's not really for me to say, but I, for one, did not come away from this film feeling too disappointed.

Some maintain that SONG really would have been much better had it simply been a performance film, with no pretensions.  But actually, there have been VERY few pure performance docs historically.  Even the best concert films (THE LAST WALTZ,say) usually throw in a least a few documentary elements, a la WOODSTOCK.  And it can give the viewer a better sense of place (here NYC) and time (1973).  The documentary elements give some flavor of the rock'n'roll life as it was lived by both musicians AND fans.  And it does so more by presenting random clips of backstage life than by interviews.  It speaks volumes to me that in one scene, security is letting a couple of kids sneak backstage with  a proverbial nod and a wink, and in another, someone--who may have been a little drunker, more high or otherwise more disorderly--is being chased down like a (black)dog.

And all those shots of the NYC skyline in 1973 register in a very strange way in these post-9/11 times.  Those towers were pretty new back then.

As for the much reviled ""fantasy"" sequences.  Well, I admit, I'd probably prefer to see more live sequences myself.  But they really do serve as a precursor to the video-era (and you'll recall that the first videos weren't exactly big budget spectaculars either, so having Robert Plant in medieval garb ride around on horseback for a couple of minutes or having Jimmy Page scaling a mysterious mountain, only to meet up with a mysterious warlock (who looks, again mysteriously, like his own bad self) is scarcely any sillier than what was being broadcast 24 hours a day on ""Music Television"" a few years later.  As a bridge between psychedelia and the MTV era, THE SONG REMAINS THE SAME is an invaluable document.

Besides would a full length performance film really have been everything some fans seem to imagine it could have been?  I don't think so.  At some point, I concluded that the cinematographer must have had a mad crush on Robert Plant.  The shots of his, uh, torso were getting a little monotonous.  And poor John Paul Jones is all but ignored in the live shots.  He gets a few moments where he's fingering the fretboard, before the camera action is once again lovingly diverted back to Page and Plant.  Well, they were the showmen after all.  And this was quite the show.

For good or ill, depending on your point of view.  At the time, as I recall, I was just purist enough to think that I could have done with less 'show' and more of the musicianship I knew the group was capable of.  But looking at the film in 2006, I'm more ""que era, era.""  It was what it was.  And it's worth a look.",1164585600,2,3369,4.565

292862,1,6300270424,"""Hideous"" is the best adjective to describe this pile of rubbish.

I loved Led Zeppelin and was one of the first to see this film when it came out in Los Angeles in the mid 1970s.  I watched in dismay, as what once was a fine group of musicians descended into sloppy performances and laughable, amateurish ""fantasy"" sequences.  Jimmy Page's horrid playing mars the entire affair.  The group seems full of themselves, forgetting where they came from and the great musicianship that got them to the pinnacle of rock. Truly one of rock's great players, he appears drunk on his own ego, awash in an ocean of Jack Daniels. Anyone who paid to see these concerts deserve a refund, and then some.

A much better version of the band is captured in the recent DVD collection of a few years back that shows performances from the late 60s into the late 70s.  The early stuff shows them at the peak of their powers: a tight knit group that roared like rolling thunder.  That's the true reflection of this great rock band, not this monument to rock sloth and gluttony.

I read the glowing reviews with disbelief from others here, and they seem caught in a web of their own cognitive dissonance.  The music and playing is so poor that it's beyond subjective perspective.  This is a third-rate concert film and and a huge embarrassment to one of the greatest rock bands.",1157760000,11,1354,4.580912863070539

292865,5,6300270424,"Can someone say ""Jimmy Page is a Guitar God""? Sure, I knew you could. Even now, with both Page and Plant getting on in years, there is still something 'there' when they merge together. Just listen to their No Quarter versions of old Zep material and their own material: ""Wonderful One"" and ""The Truth Explodes"", as well as the stuff they wrote with some Moroccan musicians: ""City Don't Cry"" and the ""Wha Wha"" song.  Tell me there isn't still Page/Plant magick going on within the realm of their music. Some slam ""Walking Into Clarksdale"" Page/Plant's project from 1998, but even though I think some of those songs could have had a bit more edge to them, I still enjoy many of the finished products like: ""Most High"" ""Shining Light"" ""When The World Was Young""-a song, which I believe Robert is speaking about him and Jimmy-and ""House Of Love"", the magick remains the same.  (If the two men can just come to some agreement and continue being who they are, I honestly don't think their fans would complain.) I am enjoying my DVD of ""The Song Remains The Same"" (haven't seen it since I was a teenager and even then I was seeing it at a Midnight show on Friday's and Saturday's before the God machine of church ""saved"" me from my 'sinning' ways and I let go of the one band that I fell in love with at first sight.) And I do mean fell in love with. It wasn't just Jimmy and Robert's physical appearance, although that was nothing to sneer at, it was their amazing confidence when they fell into their music, their sheer charisma with both voice and guitar. John Bonahm, may he rest in peace, was also something of a marvel I'm discovering now in this second go round. I listen to him play on the recordings and his drumming was as smooth as silk, and in concert, he knew how to listen to the lead men and fall into step. John Paul Jones, the quiet one of the quartet, I look at him now and see how amazing he was on stage, being calm, reserved and simply allowing himself to flow with the energy around him from the music created. (Just ignore the wigs, if you can.  The pageboy look just was not him!) Everything about this band was and will continue to be a study in the complexity of confidence and being one with each other as well as one within themselves on an individual level. I noticed right off that all musicians on stage trusted each other to do their part.  There was no one out of 'place'; each had their job to do and the others made space for the individual auras to do their thing.  Jimmy and Robert may have been the 'front men' and  with their flare for charisma they fit that role well. Jonesy and Bonzo were content to stay in the background, offering their strong and smooth backup.  Jimmy's guitar playing is the stuff of legend, and Robert was once quoted as saying that he, ""Plays a little left of heaven.""  Perfect analogy. Jimmy is always in a world of his own making, making him a one-of-a-kind guitarist.  Jimmy loses himself in his music and its very evident on camera.  He knows he's being filmed but doesn't seek the camera out, he lets his music take him where he wills and where he wills to play is to the audience.  The members of the band did not think these nights of concerts were their best...not their worst, but not their best.  I beg to differ.  From a viewer who had never even heard of Zeppelin before seeing this movie (with the exception that they did this song called 'Stairway To Heaven'), I was floored from the first moment I laid eyes (and ears) on what they could do. It's been 30 years since The Song Remains The Same movie was released, and it's still as fresh to me each time I see it as though it were brand new.

292866,5,6300270424,"No other film could have captured the grandeur of Led Zeppelin and incorporated an insight on the band members and their adventures and personalities than ""The Song Remains the Same.""  Even if you were not a wild child of the 70's (like myself), you got the feel of the times and the concert, and the emotions of the audience leaked through onto you.  It is my favorite movie, because there is nothing I love more than Led Zeppelin.  I laughed, danced, and cried through out this film.

The film starts out oddly with Richard Cole in a mob scene and Peter Grant getting tour dates, but is a quiet transition into what the picturesque daily lives of all 4 members are...and it is truly sweet.  For example, Robert is with his kids and wife, as is Jonesy, Bonzo is farming, and Jimmy is playing a hurdy-gurdy in a lovely autumn setting.  But you totally feel the love and overall high of New York City in the 1970's, venturing through out subway tunnels and skyscraping buildings...to the sounds of Zeppelin LIVE!!

Each band member has their own scene in which their ""theme"" song, if you will,is performed and each of them get to be a little dramatic through amateur acting (and they don't do half bad...but their musical performance is a million times better!).  The members and their songs are as follows, along with a brief description of the scene :

""No Quarter""-John Paul(A dark horseback rider [Jonesy] in the night, playing a church organ)
""Dazed and Confused""-Pagey(Mysterious and insane things that REALLY make you think about your own life)
""The Rain Song""-Robert(Dramatic LOTR type acting...but very daring)
""Moby Dick""-Bonzo(The maniac himself doing his best)

It is a lenghthy movie, but if you are a true fan you will not get bored.  It is so natural, and the concert spectacular, for this is Zeppelin at their peak.  I HIGHLY recommend it, before any concert movie by ANY artist.",1153699200,3,1894,4.758409785932722

292881,3,6300270424,"Led Zeppelin fans are deeply devided in their feelings for the band's 1976 concert film ""The Song Remains The Same"". They either love it or they think it's outright horrible. Personally, I'm in the middle. I don't hate it, but I do think it could've been (and should've been) so much more.

First of all, let me start off by saying that i am a huge Led Zeppelin fna. I think they are the greatest rock and roll band ever. I have never heard a band with more soul, talent, emotion and presence than these four guys.

""The Song Remains The Same"" is a compilation of select performances from the group's legendary 1973 concert at the world renowned New York venue Madison Square Garden. However, we don't even get to see the whole show.

The movie opens with some weird (and bloody) gangster movie fantasy sequence, then goes throgh about 15 minutes of the band at home with their family and getting ready for the show.

The concert opens with a flacid and uninspired performance of ""Rock & Roll"".  The band is playing with the least of their abilities, andPlant's voice sound shot. Next is a more lively version of ""Black Dog"", followed by a raw and powerful ""Since I've Been Loving You"". Next comes ""No Quarter"", which, while a great performance, features a horridly cheesy fantasy sequence, the first of many.

After a few minutes of backstage footage, we get ""The Song Remains The Same"", which is a solid performance. Next comes ""The Rain Song"", which, while performed beautifully, is accompanied by yet another cheesy fantasy.

After some more backstage footage, we get to the film's low point. ""Dazed And Confused"" was known to drag on for a good 25 minutes (sometimes more), but this version is exceptionally boring and the fantasy sequence is horridly uninteresting.

The rest of the movie is pretty solid. The performances are all full of life and overall great, especially ""Stairway To Heaven"", which manages to go completely uninterrupted throughout its length. The movie wraps up with a powerful ""Whole Lotta Love"".

Overall, not a bad effort, but this is not the best of Zeppelin live. Thankfullt in 2003, Jimmy Page compikled a new two disc dvd featuring concrts by the band spanning nine years, including lost footage from the movie. It is much better than this, though I would recommend buying both since this film while flawed is quite intersting and overall enjoyable.",1149292800,2,2383,4.7926829268292686
292882,3,6300270424,"For decades we've seen this movie. We know it as the back of our hands. You already done a fantastic piece of work by releasing the essential Led Zeppelin DVD Box Set.

Having found the Madison Square Garden tapes (that's undeniable because of the previously unseen footage on the 2 DVD Box Set) my question is simple:

WHERE IS THE DIRECTOR'S CUT?.

I can't believe this is a copy-paste DVD from the VHS we already have. Why not the uncut footage instead?. We've seen the filming scenes... and we don't like them, face it my friend. All that stuff is just pointless, filler, pathetic. I give this 3 star just for the concert alone and the parts we can see the band playing.

Its so annoying not to be able to see John's keyboard solo Paul on Not Quarter, or Bonzo's quintessential solo on Moby Dick, the interpretacion of Dazed And Confuzed, Rain Song, etc.

Easily the most memorable, viewed and  recalled part of the whole film is Stairway To Heaven... not only for the song but it appears complete without any scenes interruption!.

Moreover, even we can't have the complete version of Heartbreaker, and it's probably that also exist Celebration Day.

It's about time that you make justice to this document of the history of the music, truly, we are tired of waiting.

If you grew up in the LZ era, and you were a FAN, then you went to the movies at midnight to see this tour and you hoped the theater let the movie finish all the way! You sat until the credits had rolled, then totally spent from air guitaring in front of the screen to the movie audience you went home...with very little voice left. That's how I experienced it, 50 times along with a pretty packed theater full of rockers. If you missed this experience...Meybe you should write a review of something else, since the whole point of the fantasy sequences will be lost on you. As will the blind emotion of feeling a part of it. Looking through the eye of Jimmy Page as he takes you into his dark world from who he is to where he started , Plant eating the mushroom and telling of his trails and travesties ""I felt the coldness of my winters...I thought, it would never go""...Jonesy out for a days work dealing with the demons of who pull him away from those closest to him. And Bonzo, Truly a drummer in his mentality, linear...black and white with a little psychedelia...and fun! The rest of the movie is there to give you insight about what happens in a tour. It does this. The two kids getting in... Later this would inspire a movie called Detroit Rock City.  The wasted groupies watching the limos drive away, another movie called ""Almost famous"". The roadies  making a little on the side. The bouncers not being all bad. Peter Grants struggles to control the concert machine. One of the best shots ever was of the NYC cop being transformed from a pig, there to keep these kids in line, to an awestruck man wondering what the hell was going on. Its indellibly etched upon my mind. {and his} The mounted police saying ""lotta fun lotta fun"" as they rethink their image and actions in front of a camera. The woman shown in the audience reaches that place she's been striving for in her buzz as they start to play. You get to see Led Zeppelin play a song for 26 minutes for christs sake. You really get to SEE Led Zeppelin! What more can you ask? This movie is not an editors choice... What were some of the other reviewers thinking?! It is the Fans choice though. Who wants to see or hear a perfectly edited LIVE concert? Isn't that an oxymoron? I ONLY recommend this tape footage for people who at least occasionally leave their terminals.

The Song Remains the Same consists of Led Zeppelin performing songs live (Black Dog, Rock & Roll, No Quarter, Moby Dick, and Stairway to Heaven to name a few) and then we have the fantasy sequences of singer Robert Plant, guitarist Jimmy Page, bassist/keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. Watching this it's apparent how talented these men are. Plant has an great stage prescence, Page is a marvelous guitarist, Jones is a very low-key guy who stands in the background most of the time, and Bonham is on fire when he's banging those drums.

However, it'd be nice to be able to give it ten stars, because I have to give a whole seperate five stars to the concert itself.  The Madison Square Garden Concert is incredible.  I love it and how it was put together.

Also the live performances stand up more than they ever did on the album version. For example because of the visuals Dazed & Confused, Moby Dick & Whole Lotta Love are not as tiring as listening on the album. And also there are some added songs Black Dog (though for some reason it's been cut in length) & Heartbreaker, although for some reason Celebration Day (which is on the album) isn't included on the film version!!!

Overall The Song Remains the Same is not an essential Zeppelin DVD now that the 5 1/2 hour DVD is out, but it is worth buying to see what Zeppelin & their management were like back then (the film though released in 1977 is based on the bands Houses of the Holy tour of 1973) & it is also possible to see how the press & public thought of Zeppelin at the height of their popularity!!!!",1124323200,,1165,4.150442477876106

No Quarter from the album has the most riveting organ and guitar solo, but it must have been filmed on a different night for the film, because it is shorter and lacks bravado.

292919,4,6300270424,"The Song Remains The Same (1976), the Led Zeppelin movie

[This review also refers to the CD 'The Song Remains The Same' soundtrack and so this review appears on that product also]

There is little that hasn't already been said about Led Zeppelin. Simply one of the greatest bands of all time, their studio albums are one amazing collection, however, the one thing that lacks with the band's catalogue is recorded live material. Led Zeppelin, for all their popularity and fame, were a pretty camera shy band who avoided giving interviews and releasing live footage of them playing. However, for many years, the one exception to this was 'The Song Remains The Same' movie, released in 1976, which combined the band playing live at Madison Square Garden in 1973 with various other scenes in between.

Since this film's release nearly 30 years ago, there have been recent releases of the band live which supercede this DVD. These include the awesome 'Led Zeppelin' double DVD and the 'How The West Was Won' soundtrack both released in 2003. However, in perspective, 'The Song Remains The Same' still remains an awesome live document and should not be ruled out. Some reviewers seem to have bashed this release with comments such as relating to the fact the concert footage is intermingled with scenes of the band at home and fantasy settings. I take these people's points however at the end of the day this DVD is a MOVIE not solely a LIVE MUSIC DVD. Also, when the scenes do eject away from the concert footage, the live music at the concert continues playing and so you still hear Led Zeppelin live even if the scene is concentrating on something else. Furthermore, the other scenes aren't all that bad. Some of them are just fantasy settings, whilst others are scenes of the band members at home and in other parts we even get interviews (including a 5 minute rant from manager Peter Grant at the concert; filmed backstage where he is rightfully complaining about fake posters being sold of the band).

For the music on 'The Song Remains The Same' release, you really have two options. The first is to get the DVD, which gives you the full film, and therefore the music played, the live footage and the extra scenes. Alternatively, if you just want to hear what features on the film, buy the soundtrack CD which features the 9 live tracks which are played, plus the Bron-Yr-Aur intro and the 'Stairway To Heaven' studio version which plays at the end of the film.

The actual Madison Square Garden concert from 1973 was one of Led Zeppelin's highlights in terms of their live career. All in all, 9 songs which they played there are captured in the film. The highlights have to be firstly, the almost half-hour long version of 'Dazed and Confused', where the band keep the song in suspense in miraculous style. 'No Quarter'. which features some whizz keyboard work from John Paul Jones and some great guitar solos played by Jimmy Page (during ths song, another fantasy scene ensues in the movie). John Bonham's drumming is furious and creative during the performance of 'Moby Dick' and the band's closing showcase of 'Whole Lotta Love' is a memorable finisher. All in all, the music itself is great.

Eventhough I would never say this film DVD holds a candle to the recent Led Zeppelin DVD release and the 'How The West Was Won' live set, it is still an excellent film with some timeless captures of the band performing live at the time when they were at their peak. The concert is brilliant, the few interviews are good and the fantasy styled editions, yes are a little cheesy but aren't too bad non the less! For any Led Zeppelin fan, this DVD is a great extra for your collection.",1123027200,,3682,4.691950464396285
292920,5,6300270424,"I'm as big a fan of Led Zeppelin as there is.  I live for Jimmy Page's 25+ minute long solos, and John Bonham's pounding drums, and Robert Plant's ear ringing vocals.  If you're a similar Led Zeppelin fan, this legendary DVD is an absolute essential for your collection.

 It combines the band's fascination with fantasy and folklore and their incredible onstage talent and poise.  It also shows glimpses into real life, unedited, unstaged scenarios from the lives of the band members.

 I bought the other live Led Zeppelin DVD, ""How The West Was Won"" (an I strongly, strongly recommend that as well for any true Led Zeppelin fan.  John Bonham's amazing 10 minute long improvised drum solo during ""Moby Dick"" in this DVD (The Song Remains The Same) is astonishing.

1. The first part of the film that show some movie clips of the band members is quite interesting but it went tooooo long.

2. You will see clip that show the band members riding a horses instead of play their instruments while the concert is going on.

3. Dazed and Confused, I have no complain about the song, it's great!!! espectially the violin part but then........during some interesting effect you'll see Jimmy climbing up a mountain and next time you see the band is when Jimmy DONE his violin bowing!!!!!!!

4. Moby Dick, You'll see Bonzo work in his farm more often than playing drums.

5. Heartbreaker, I'm not sure if they want us to see the band playing or watching news about the money stolen.

6. The band themself sometimes look lackluster.

1. The footage of many songs is very good.

2. You'll see clip of JPJ during his solo on No Quater and it's interesting.

3. The magician clip during violin part in Dazed and Confued is totally high art!!!.

4. Stairway To Heaven is cool!! but not as great as the one from Earl's Court that includeed in ""Led Zeppelin"" dvd

5. Full lenght of Whole Lotta Love!!!

If you're a casual fan you should buy ""Led Zeppelin"" instead of this one. But some song here like The Song Remain The Same,The Rain Song, and Heartbreaker that the band play very often on the stage during their career sadly not include in their full length on ""Led Zeppelin"" dvd.",1114300800,7,1574,4.401384083044983

I have watched this movie over and over again. the music is of course awesome...and some of the songs are played better live than they are on the original albums....the particular song that comes to mind is ""The Rain Song"". the fantasy sequence in the rain song is amazing too. Other songs they play include ""Since I've been loving You"", ""Dazed and Confused"", ""Stairway to Heaven"" & ""Rock and Roll"". A must have for any Led head!",1112918400,5,670,4.537190082644628

The real genius of these musicians can be seen in this presentation. Four of the best at what they do in action. Yes,it has some faults but lets not forget that this was created back in the mid-70's & was an after-thought rather than a planned project.

If you have trouble staying awake through ""Dazed"" then you are not a true Zep fan, which is not a crime. Personally, it's one of my favorite tracks as it shows Page at his finest(best rock guitarist IMO). One may not care for the version of ""Stairway

to Heaven"" at 1st but it grows on you. If I had a gripe it would be that they didn't put the same tracks on the CD set as that are in the movie. Other than that, I can live with any other shortcomings one may point out.",1111449600,3,840,4.084848484848485

Yes, we thankfully have the new DVD, and the West Was Won CD, but to say that they couldn't cut it on Song Remains Same is just a flat out LIE.  To be fair, YES, there is some cutting of performances using video footage from different nights and things like that, and there is the ""fantasy"" footage that may or may not bug you.  BUT, there is plenty of live music and live video to show you Zeppelin flying high in all of its glory!  The bow sequence alone during Dazed is EPIC, Jimmy is channeling the music from somewhere, who knows where!  Anyway you cut it, the band is in AMAZING form, pure and simple, and if you are unable to be moved by this performance, that is ok I guess, but you should stick to your Sinead O'Connor records and other ""brilliant"" ""artists"" of the like.",1108425600,4,1009,4.306878306878307

In this concert we can appreciate deeply what means to be a star in the 70's; the hair cut, dressing, even the jimmy page old school way to play his double-guitarr... it's just magnificent, glorius and beautiful the power that contains inside... and thats why I gave to this dvd 5 stars.

292933,4,6300270424,"I had a different review posted before I rethought it, and decided that a rewrite was in order.

Originally, I based my four stars on this movie in the assumption that anyone that has ever listened to Zeppelin enough would come away a rabid fan. I realize that this is not so, and it bugged me enough to put forth a revised justification for those four stars.

To enjoy this concert/movie, you have to be a fan. If you lived in a vacuum and this was your first exposure to the band, there is no guarantee that you would walk away loving them as so many of us hardcore fans do.  Bad editing, weird sound, the general creepiness that clings to some of the ""music video before it was music video"" scenes, and even those down to earth moments with the band are not something that just anyone can appreciate.

I have had it in my collection in some form or another since high school, and I still watch it when the mood hits me, enjoying it every time.  It's not something that I watch every day, and it never was.  But it's cool. It's enjoyable. It's fun. The creepy stuff has a haunting quality to it that draws you in, cheesy though it is, and the performances are not their absolute best (though Jimmy Page can never do wrong!). But if you are a true Zeppelin fan, it is an essential.

As I have grown older, I watch it less and less, but I still watch it, and may in fact, watch it tonight. Some of its magic is gone and I generally just prefer to listen to Zeppelin. However, it still shines with a certain timelessness that gives is a 4-star rating after all these years.",1102723200,,1572,4.25503355704698
292934,5,6300270424,"Im 17, so i have not had the chance, and will never, to see this legendary band play live, but at least i can watch their unbelivable performances on dvd.  Personally i think Page is the best guitar player who ever, and will ever live, and getting to see him solo with a violin bow for 20 mins is a blessing.  Plant's vocals are mesmerizing, Bonham's drumming is undeniably some of the best, if not the best, and he also gets his 20 min solo in between Pages constant masterful guitar work, and Jones shows us he can carry rythm, while Page displays his skill.  Have i mentioned Page is the best guitar player ever, yeah thats right i said he was better then Hendrix, what are you gonna do about it?  Hendrix is defintly  a true master, but unfortunatly he didn't write material worthy of his skill, but i mean how many guys do you know that can set their guitar on fire and play it with their teeth, and more, but i like Pages music better.  The fantasy scenes were wierd, didn't make sense, but what do you expect from potheads, at least they keep playin kick ass music throughout, and the opening when Bonham shoots the guy and his head falls of and skittles spurt out was funny.  10 out of a 10 for the best band ever, playin the best music ever, cant wait to get the complete studio recordings box set, i just need the $100.  RAP SUCKS, if you have taste listen to ROCK, if you want to hear black guys talk about drugs and shootin white people watch cops, don't give them millions for ruining music.",1102464000,3,1504,4.289752650176679
292935,2,6300270424,"I'm not that big of a Led Zeppelin fan at all. I never will be. However, I thought that this would open me to liking this band. It  put me back a few steps.

The movie starts off with a mob ""wacking"" (am I using that right)? A man without a face, a man that's a bear-type of thing like Star Wars, and one guy gets his head blown off and multi-colored blood squirts out of his head. Sounds like something they'd make fun of on Monty Python. Who are these people, why are they killing these other people?

Then we see a kid my age on a bike, delivering a message to Robert Plant, who is watching his nude children run around in a river, with presumambly his wife next to him, I wouldn't know. We don't find out what the note says either.

Then John Paul Jones in drag, and John Bonoham on a farm, Jimmy Page with lazer eyes. This is what the band does before a show? I didn't really find it hillarious.

As for the music a third of it was quite good, but it just goes on and on and on. For example the Moby Dick thing, the ""orgasmic"" version of Dazed and Confused.

Stairway to Heaven is the greatest song ever? Led Zeppelin is the best band? Stairway has the best solo ever? Bonzo the best drummer ever? Page the best guitarist? Plant the best singer? Gimmie a friken break. I say Hey Jude;Beatles;Free Bird;Keith Moon;Jimi Hendrix;Roger Daltrey. I believe that the best live band is Pink Floyd or the Who. The best musical band is maybe the WHo, and the best songwriting is definatley the Beatles.

I'm not putting down Led Zeppelin. I have the BBC thing and it rocks. They have a number of good songs, but the group is very overated. I get tired of hearing ""get the Led out"", every friken day, not only on the radio, but from a classmate of mine.

Skip this, get their studio stuff, because they are terrible live. Leave these kinds of movies to Pink Floyd or the Who, who are veterans at making interesting Documentary/concerts films, and also real movies with stories. Check out ""Live in Pompeii"", ""The Wall"", ""Live at the Isle of Wight"", ""The Kids are Alright"", and the brilliant ""Quadrophenia"".",1102118400,,2099,4.350383631713555
292956,5,6300270424,"Though the 2003 Led Zeppelin DVD set might even be a bit better than TSRTS musically, this is still the Zeppelin DVD with the best picture quality. All performances were filmed on 35mm film, not on video tapes or 16mm film. That's why TSRTS DVD has the most stunning footage of Led Zeppelin that you can get. The weird ""fantasy""! sequences are excusable IMO, since the musical performances are all very good. I would rate the performances on this DVD as follows:

Rock & Roll 9/10

Black Dog (sadly cut) 9/10

Since I've been loving you (10/10)

No Quarter (10/10)

The song remains the same (10/10)

The rain song (10/10)

Dazed and Confused (9/10)

Moby Dick (8/10)

Stairway to Heaven (10/10)

Heartbreaker (only snippets, too short to rate)

Whole Lotta Love (10/10)

Robert Plant's singing is very good (in particular in TSRTS, Rain Song and Stairway to Heaven), Jimmy Page is in top form and Jones/Bonham are flawless as usual.

Killer versions of The Song Remains The Same and Stairway to Heaven!!! Maybe the best Stairway guitar solo ever!

292957,5,6300270424,"Potential viewers shouldn't be deterred by pointless and ridiculous commentaries of seemingly short-attention-spanned reviewers who like other bands anyway and shouldn't bother writing about Led Zeppelin. This movie was meant to present the four individuals of the band in a collective context,therefore each group memeber is showcased in the live footage and in a fantasy sequence. The original three-hour concert is not fully used,instead relevant parts where interwoven with off-stage scenes,hence creating a closer outlook on each individual. Jimmy Page is featured on 'Dazed And Confused'(where he plays a sort of warlock),Robert Plant on the ""double header"" 'Song Remains/Rain Song'(with an Arthurian character),John Bonham on 'Moby Dick'(he preferred an honest,family-and-friends environment) and John Paul Jones on 'No Quarter'(presenting himself as a man with two faces,one as a musician and one as a""pater familias"").The live footage is superb and so is the playing. Critics of the era always stated the difference between the heavily orchestrated studio versions and the four-piece live arragements,often calling them ""thin"";their gullable readers trusted this assumptions and not their ears,and the accusation is present to this day. I'm not old enough to have seen Led Zeppelin Live but I have read such articles and I do trust my ears and you can trust yours by listening to this DVD,its soundtrack,the Led Zeppelin DVD and 'How The West Was Won' on CD,you'll be able to tell if live Led Zeppelin is worthy of the legend they created. The marvellous renditions of 'Since I've Been Loving You','Stairway','No Quarter',the title track,'Dazed','Heartbreaker/Whole Lotta Love' and the sheer power of the band on stage in '73 are enough reasons to purchase this DVD.There's a criticism by someone who claims to have seen Zeppelin in '77,if you want to experience the awesome power of the band in '77 go to the Led Zeppelin DVD,on disc two select promos and the menu is a bootleg recording of the June 21st concert at the L.A. Forum with accompanying bootleg footage(from Birmingham and NY),listen an marvel at it(the picture is not very good but the audio is excellent,that is why it was relegated to a menu feature).The only drawbacks in the movie are the re-enacment of some bits-mostly close-ups(Page had to struggle with gaps in the footage to match with the audio) that are only apparent by very close inspection. Also the audio editting suffers somewhat when matching,almost by force,some scenes. This does not occur on the soundtrack where such limitations where not imposed by the lack of visuals. Also the output of the DVD is not as loud as the Led Zeppelin DVD,but the '76 mixing work is outstanding. Another inhibiting factor is that the fantasy sequences are shown during some instrumentals,and songs like 'Over The Hills',although played at this concerts of July '73 when the shooting of the film took place,were discarded. This DVD is a great remnant of the Led Zeppelin experience. Miss it at your own risk.",1099699200,56,3032,5.25360824742268

Because of that, this particular video can now be enjoyed without having to worry about the documentary or ""dream sequences"" getting in the way of the live performance.

The live performance is pretty good, but, sadly, sounds somewhat sloppy and rushed in comparison to the wealth of material on the new DVD. Plant's voice even breaks unbecomingly at several points during a rather strained performance of ""The Song Remains the Same."" And the ""dream sequences""? Oddly enough, I find them kooky & charming, and they're actually the reason I still like this video. I--and many others, I'm certain--am particularly fond of the sight of the late, great John Bonham puttering about his farm and of Plant playing with his late son, Karac. There's something very melancholic about it, and I, at least, see no problem with that.

Video-wise, during these shrieks we see dawdly 'fantasy' sequences, with some backstage interludes,  where we get to see their acrimonious manager trying on his backend ""hip"" and gleefully abusing stadium employees.

This is not my opinion....THIS IS FACT!! I am a guitar player (for nearly 40 years), as well as a dabbler on the keys. If you are a musician, you must have noticed it. The sound is NOT....I SAY THE SOUND IS NOT IN-SYNC WITH THE VIDEO! What amatuer let this slide by. There are many places where this is noticible. You can's miss it. Plant bellowing out a howl (like during RnR), yet for a split second, the mic is still near his waist...it's not anywhere near his mouth. I thought that this was just an overdub. But no because during the intro to Stairway, Page (my beloved guitar GOD himself) is doing his little riff on the  6 of his EDS and....my gosh people, the sound and video are no where near in-synch with each other. There are many other moments just like this. I can't believe Page let this thru the out door (pardon the pun). I enjoy this concert. I don't believe it deserves the bad rap it has recieved over the past 25-30 years or so. If you like live albums that have been totally redone in the studio, try Rush's Exit...Stage Left or Show of Hands. Live albums were (I say WERE) meant to be made in the raw!...mistakes and all. And there are many of them (LEAVE THEM IN...THIS IS LIVE BABY). Musically I rate this as a (LIVE album) a 5 star PLUS!

John Paul Jones tears of the bass and when he plays the keyboards on 'No Quarter' its so freakin cool! Robert Plants vocals are great like always. Jimmy Pages guitar playing is insane, I was watching them play 'Since I've Been Loving You' and Jimmy has to be one of the top guitar players ever, as if you didn't already know that.

What this movie does well is show the amazing showmanship and incredible magnetism of the band, something that may not be evident to those of us too young to have seen them perform.  Robert Plant is an amazing frontman and it was fascinating to see the unattractive Englishman with bad teeth (sorry, Mr. Plant) that I saw at the beginning of the movie morph into an amazingly attractive, vibrantly sexual performer by the end.  The raw passion of the band is laid bare.

A drum solo from John Bonham that lasts (I kid you not) 20 minutes exemplifies my feelings on the movie, because though I found the solo electrifying in short bursts, I was also checking my watch by the end of it.

So they had to put something in there to take up the space of the missing footage while you heard the song being played. I agree the dream sequences are a bit silly, but it does show a side to each of their personaities at that time in their lives. You have to remember that this was shot in 1973, people...30 yrs. ago! For not having today's technology, you have to admit that it doesn't sound that bad and the picture quality is quite good! I think Jimmy's solos are exceptional! Dazed and Confused does go on quite a bit too long, but that's what made him a legendary guitarist...his improvosational skills were unmatched by any guitarist then, and since, and he does a supurb job of showing that off in this film!

The DVD version is different from the VHS version in the following ways: It was very nice to see extended scenes in the ""Mob Rubout"" chapter and some better editing overall. Of course, the picture and audio quality are far superior than the VHS version also. My main gripe about this DVD is that the ""Widescreen"" is totally fake! What I mean by this is that all they did was put black bars over the same picture in the VHS version. (I compared them side-by-side.) True Widescreen is when you get extra picture on both sides and the shot is shrunk down to fit the TV. So really what we're getting here is the top and bottom of the picture cut off! What an insult! I don't think most people would notice this, however, so I can really only subtract 1 star for this must-have Zep DVD!",1050537600,5,1055,4.443298969072165
292984,3,6300270424,"I first saw this movie back in '77, and being a huge a fan of the group, I was both delighted and disappointed.  The group performed predictably well over the 3 nights at the Garden when they were filmed, but the live footage of the band was mediocre with too many close-up shots and not enough of the band performing as a whole.  (There's amateur bootleg video available of the group from '75 in Chicago that has the vantage point that I wish this movie had - single camera from the first row.)  With the exception of Plant's fantasy section during ""The Rain Song"", the others were distracting and disjointed, and only stole away from the performance.  (Fans may care to seek THE SONG REMAINS THE SAME outtake bootleg video, which has the ""damsel in distress"" role played by Plant's ex-wife, Maureen.)  Another major problem with the movie from an historical perspective is the somewhat outdated nature of the live material shown.  Back then, the group had the classic PHYSICAL GRAFFITI album out for 2 years when the movie was released, but none of that material was covered.  If they included footage from the '75 tour, that would have helped tremendously.  Also, if the band had performed an acoustic set during those shows, that also would have given the overall performance more flavor.  The addition of some offstage footage of the group (in their famous Starship jet, for example) would have added interest to the film.  One major plus with the movie is the inclusion of ""Since I've Been Loving You"", with didn't make it to the soundtrack album (but that's another review).  In summary, the movie would have been more enjoyable if it was longer and without the peripheral ""fantasy"" sequences.
  It's unfortunate that so little quality film footage is available from this legendary band, which by default makes this film the best live document available.  It's too bad that the group never performed at Woodstock, because their performance in that film would have been awesome.  (Note: The band was actually in the region during that week in August '69, performing in Canada.  DAMN!)  But, save for a few decent bootleg videos (Danish TV, Staines, Paris '69; Chicago, Inglewood '75, etc.), this film will unfortunately remain the best historical concert film document of Led Zeppelin, and as such should be regarded as indispensable.",1047686400,,2340,4.898477157360406

When I purchased this DVD I frankly expected more. I (being a guitarist) expected to see Jimmy Page in all his glory thrashing out riffs for everybody. Instead, i get Jimmy playing at his sloppiest. Robert Plant keeps saying ""push, push"" during every song which is, quite frankly, disturbing. John Paul Jones and John Bonham sound great, but stand behind Robert and Jimmy like statues (which I guess is okay). Robert, Jimmy, John, and JPJ all look tired and worn out. To put it, they look lazy. Add to this the annoying ""dream sequences"" and there you have it. I expected a Zeppelin concert, not a freaky LSD trip.",1046563200,4,786,4.390410958904109

Upon seeing this movie, I went into my room and sat down with the 10-disc box set of all their songs, and listened to it all the way through. More than half of those songs I had never heard. I liked them before, but after that, it was unmistakable, I knew at that moment, they were the greatest band I ever heard of, indeed, the greatest band ever. Now, I can play almost any Zep tune you could want to hear on my  guitar, and they have inspired me to play more than anything else. Now I play all the time. I write a lot of music now too. This is clearly the most inspirational thing I have ever seen.

293002,1,6300270424,"I'd discourage anyone's interest for any of these performances (VHS or DVD are both of bad quality). The sound and picture quality has to be the WORST I've ever heard from any live band. The sound is flat and gets drowned out easily. No matter how far sound quality standards have changed since the 1976 release of this movie, the sound remains as horrible as ever. As far as the picture, I've done better framing with my home camcorder.  As a TV and movie viewer in the 21st century, I've been too used to seeing several frames per minute, while this movie often shows the entire stage of the band playing instead of cutting to different frames, and belive me.. you'll go CRAZY.  In addition, the DVD is exactly the same as the VHS since it was originally recorded with [bad] analong systems in 1973 and is practically incapable of a good remaster. DO NOT BUY THIS. I was very disappointed as a big fan of Zeppelin to say the least. It is NOT worth the money. To add to the poor sound quality, the band played pretty poorly too. Some renditions were way too long and needlessly draggy. I understand the improvisational culture of blues music, but .... Robert's voice is also very weak and stripped and you almost NEVER see John Paul Jones. (Did Robert and Jimmy eternally hate that guy or what?).  The whole movie has been over rated since it's the only official Zeppelin live performance (I'm talking the REAL band with Bonham and all).  The Stairway to Heaven performance is very over rated too.  I was so disappointed in that.  I wouldn't recommend the soundtrack either, since it's the same songs with the same POOR quality.  It also lacks the live version of ""Black Dog"" which was one of the only decent renditions in the whole movie.
For new Zeppelin fans, STAY AWAY FROM THIS.  It will only turn you off from the band completely since it does NO justice to their real power and talent.  For older fans... DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.
To sum it up, it's just a HORRIBLE movie and I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy. No wonder it bombed at the box office in 1976.",1041206400,3,2071,4.486702127659575

Don't get me wrong, he is an excellent singer. Maybe this was an off-night for him. Or mabe it's the fact that he blew out his voice somtime around 1972.

The picture quality is very good in widescreen format nonetheless. My complaint is the audio side of it as it comes off tinny.

BUT!
This is one of the (worst) DVD trasfers I have ever seen.
Except for the original trailer, there are no special features.  And the sound is HORRIBLE!  I REPEAT, HORRIBLE!  Anyone familar with the film knows that some of the editing is dubious at best.  Jump cutting around different performances within the same song.  After decades of watching the film you kinda got used to it.  Well, whenever there is an edit between performace footage in a song, the sound goes completly out of phase, and you're left with a thin, ""flangy"" sounding audio track.  It gets very annoying, and very mich in the way of the music.
I guess Jimmy Page wasn't consulted on this DVD reissue, much like he wasn't for the original CD reissues of the Zep catalouge.  The band hass always seemed keen to wash their hands of this project anyway.

Robert Plant was competely on his game, and gave us one of the best performances i've ever seen, in every song.  Stairway to Heaven was done wonderfully, with Jimmy Page giving us one of the best guitar solo's i've ever heard.  John Paul Jones was good on his bass, but even better on the keyboards, especially with No Quarter.  John Bonham delivered a powerfull, heartpounding drum solo (with his bare hands) on Moby Dick.

293036,3,6300270424,"Could these guys have taken themselves any more seriously? Along with Emerson, Lake & Palmer and The Moody Blues, I think Zep takes the cake for the 70s hubris crown. Of course, that doesn't necessarily mean that their music is bad. It's just not as great as Zeppelin thought it was. The Song Remains The Same is really a prototype for the state of modern hard rock music. If you catch any of those ridiculous rock videos on MTV, TSRTS's influence is usually obvious.
John Paul Jones (who's by far the most dignified of the bunch) is seen galloping around in some graveyard with a K-Mart Halloween mask on. He then goes to his incredibly nice house and returns to being a normal family man.
Robert Plant (who's the most earnest of the bunch) goes off on some knight-in-shining-armour kick complete with fair maiden and castle. Plant has some Welsh flags flying around, but I believe Bobby-boy is English.... Nevertheless, at least we don't have to listen to a violin bow screeching on a guitar for ten minutes through this sequence.
John Bonham (who was the most obnoxious of the bunch, if you believe all the stories) is shown racing in a car, walking around with a cow, and beating on a drum. Bonham's video isn't as pretentious as the others', it's just merely boring.
Jimmy Page (who's by far the most self-absorbed of the bunch) has a very, very scary sequence that involves some old guy on a hill. It was so scary that I was on the floor laughing about three minutes into it. Personally, I enjoy atonal music, but Jimmy's little violin solo is purely self-indulgent.
However, the music redeems TSRTS to a certain extent. No Quarter is truly a haunting piece, as is also Since I've Been Loving You. Rock and Roll is as good as rocker as any, and Moby Dick is the best rock drum solo that I can think of. Stairway is almost capsized by Robert Plant's extracurricular vocals, but it still remains majestic.
Not that it's Zeppelin's fault, but Whole Lotta Love, Bring It On Home, and Black Dog sound like every hard rock band of the last thirty years. Hey, I know Zep was the first but a little overexposure goes a long way.",1025308800,2,2126,4.553524804177545

THE SONG REMAINS THE SAME is al that and more. Watch Jimmy Page play a medieval wizard! Watch their burly tour manager in a mini ganster film! Watch Robert Plant play the noble knight! Watch Bonzo racing cars! See the HOUSES OF THE HOLY album sleeve come to life!
It also contains one of the most mindblowing renditions of ""Moby Dick"" I have ever heard. WARNING: Haters of drum solos keep your finger. on the forward button. Standards such as ""Black Dog"" and ""Whole Lotta Love"" will peel the paint off your walls too. And if you can still stand the song, there is an incredible rendition of ""Stairway to Heaven"" topped only by the one they played at their ""reunion"" concert in 1980.

When I saw them in The Garden in N.Y. in 1977 the first song they opened with was The Song Remains the Same, it took me about a minute to realize that. I saw them twice on that tour and must say compared to the other bands I mentioned their live show was a dissappointment. Many times it would take a minute to be sure what song they were playing. Jimmy Paige would be playing three guitars on some tunes on the albums and could not reproduce the music as expected. I did enjoy the shows, but they didn't sound right. A few years ago Paige and Plant hired a good group of musicians to help out and that was better. I used to be a big Zeppelin fan in the 70's but after seeing the other big groups of that time then and now they blow Zeppelin off the stage, especially The Stones and The Who. Unfortunately this is the best video you can get of Zeppelin even though it's only partly a concert film. Jimmy should have hired an extra guitar player to help out. All the other groups hire extra help and they sound great, Jimmy shouldn't have been concerned to share the stage with another guitar player, the fans would have respected it and John Paul Jones could have had someone play bass while he played keyboards.

293055,4,6300270424,"Wow. It really is fantastic to finally see my favorite band in the world performing live.  I wasn't even born when they were still together, so when I went to buy this DVD I was extremely excited.  I got home, popped it in, and immediately said, ""What the hell?!""  Then, I fast forwarded past all the scenes of the band members with their family members and other crap and then got to the actual performance.  It opens with Rock and Roll, of course, a great opener.  I sat there, mesmerized by seeing the musicians who I worship as gods performing.  A little while later, I again was forced to say, ""What the HELL!!!?"" Because they had spliced in weird scenes such as Robert Plant walking some grassy plains or something with a sword and then rescuing this chick from a couple of guards during the song No Quarter.  The music is still playing, but it's annoying if you really were in the mood to see them band perform.  Some of the scenes were short, inobtrusive, and cool, though.  Like the one where an old cloaked guy morphes slowly into Jimmy Page and back again during Dazed and Confused.  I was glad that they didn't show this through the whole bow solo, though, because I really wanted to see just how Jimmy did that.  You do get to see plenty of it, too.
My favorite parts:
Stairway to Heaven.  All of it.  They smartly show it uninterrupted by those stupid short movie clips.  It is fantastic, what can I say?
Dazed and Confused.  This whole song is great to see performed live, but I really like that part near the beginning (around the ""If you're going to San Francisco"" part) when the camera stays on Jonesy and Bonham.  You can see them talking and interacting while Jimmy's playing, and it's just good to see all that ininterrupted Bonham.
Whole Lotta Love.  For the part with that antenna thing that makes the weird noises (I know what it's called but it just slipped my mind for the moment - I hate when that friggin happens!), and the fireworks and the gong on fire.
Now, when are they going to start releasing more concerts?!  I know that they must have them in some vault somewhere, or they could take the many, many bootlegs out there and fix them up for official release.  The Jimmy Page/Black Crowes concert would be cool, but I'd rather have old concerts with the real band (preferably with some of their blues covers! this had none and I love those songs!).",1011398400,6,2381,4.469907407407407
293056,3,6300270424,"Granted this is probably the only live performance Zepplin will ever release.  I found the performance to be good but the cinamatography to be, at best, poor.  Like one reviewer mentioned, the band members are wearing different clothes in the same song, check out ""Dazed and Confused"" for instance.  It looks like the music and the video aren't insinc in places.  Regarding the ""dream sequences"", I think they were added so the viewer would not get bored with the length of some of the songs.
I wish this performance would be remastered and re-edited for the fans sake.  If you surf Zeppelin web sites you can find what the set list was for a given night.  The nights that Zeppelin was in New York filming, ""The Ocean"", ""Over The Hills..."", ""Going To California"", and several others were omitted due to time constraints.  These forgotten performances should be added plus give the fans a complete version of ""Heartbreaker"" minus the Zep hiest business.

This was best examplified when Jimmy Page released the humongous 'Led Zeppelin' box set in 1990. In ""The Song Remains the Same,"" the musical prowess of each member shines throughout the entire concert. Listening to Led Zeppelin is like listening to the Shakespeare of hard rock. My only beef is the length of the songs played. ""Dazed and Confused"" is way too long, clocking in at a half an hour, while ""Whole Lotta Love"" finishes at just over ten minutes. While this film certainly shows the great song writing ability of the band and musical ability, the concert seems to be more of a chance for the band to show off rather than entertain the crowd.",1009497600,,785,4.695652173913044

The DVD really brings out the vivid colors and the sound is great. You can see the details and I heartily recommend it. The fantasy sequences don't interfere with the concert footage and they give you insight into the personalities of the band members. Jones is a dark avenger riding through the graveyard at night in a midevil village. Plant a king Arthur who finds a sword and a fair maiden after a journey through the forest in the springtime. Page a sorcerer who meets himself on the mountain in the dark forest. And Bonham, a pool playing, beer drinking, car racing family man. This concert still holds up today and there is nothing like it. Ive watched it over a 100 times over the last 10 years and I still never get bored of it. There's always something new to see.

This is a second rate concert at best. At the time it was released Plant himself acknowledged its shortcomings, saying it simply had to be released, regardless of the calibre of the music. His words were to the effect that it 'certainly wasn't magical'. And it isn't.
For those of us lucky enough to have heard/seen a magical performance of Led Zeppelin in their prime, this concert representation is a pathetic farce. It doesn't even scratch the surface of the brilliance of the band.
On top of the mediocre performance, the editing is simply brutal. The 'dream' sequences spliced in and out of the concert footage are rather silly and beside the point, and even the live footage is so butchered that the sound/images don't match half the time.
As for the 'dream' sequences themselves.... the fact that the makers of this film are trying to 'liven up' a Led Zeppelin concert should be your first clue that something is wrong.
It's not that this film is so bad that bothers me, it's not terrible... it's just mediocre. BUT THAT'S THE PROBLEM! Led Zeppelin was one of the best rock bands of all time.. anyone watching this who had never seen a 'magical' concert would scratch their heads and wonder what all the fuss was about.

293093,5,6300270424,"In the ""Editorials"" Section, there was a saucer-eyed review by a guy from Pennsylvania.
To set this all in context, I saw the Zeppelin fly in concert three times, including Robert Plant's all-time personally rated best performance, the legendary San Francisco/Kezar Stadium appearance in early Summer 1973. For the sake of brevity, I'll have to save those details for another time and forum. Sorry, folks, but it WAS BOSS!!!
Anyway, I have a very wide range of musical tastes and have found God just as easily in seeing Herbie Hancock (Jazz) in concert; hearing Django Reinhardt (Jazz, again); listening to Classical French Romantic to Recent Pipe Organ music (both live and recorded); and seeing both Albert King and John Lee Hooker (Blues).
I have seen Link Wray, and Black Sabbath (SIX times!!), and those legends do have their own styles, but you can find God just as well, and they're in the SAME genre as the Zepps. Why, on the Sabbs' ""Dehumanizer"" tour, I saw Tony Iommi do an amazing 20-odd minute free-form solitarty solo in his own right. He looked as if he were in deep meditation during this segment of this performance. The Sabbs must have played close to THREE HOURS, in Oakland in 1992.
So I don't dash/disabuse poor Saucer Eyes of his perceptions entirely, I will voice a vast amount agreement with him that ""Song . . ."" has to be in the top five, if not the top seven rock films of all time.
Here's a Robert Plant fantasy that I'd like to see. For those of you who are also fans of Anne Rice's ""Vampire Chronicles"", I'd always felt Robert was the perfect Vampire Marius, Lestat's patient mentor. I have no idea why Robert isn't appearing in the sequels to ""Interview with the Vampire"". He'd look just dandy with a set of stiletto fangs!

Plant sounded like he was losing his voice, the music wasn't always synched with the video, too many ""cheesy"" (IMO anyway) effects, etc. This couldn't possibly have been the best footage available, could it?

The band sounds tired and I have a lot of better sounding bootleg shows from that same period in Zeppelin's career. To make matters worse, Madison Square Gardens isn't known for being all that acoustically happening. Fortunately, the live footage is tight and the video remastering is well done. You get to see how they reigned on stage, and that does add quite a lot of impact to the tunes. The audio crew gets it dialed after the first 15 minutes, and from there on, it's a decent-sounding show. I could do without the band's personal fantasy sequences, simply because I want to see more of the musicians doing their thing. But, hey, it's always a hoot seeing Bonzo doing anything.

Well, in the 25 years since I saw this film in the theater, I had forgotten the details, which all came back to me during the viewing of this DVD.
As in all concert films, anything that appears in the film in the middle of a piece, that is not taking place in the concert hall, is an unfortunate distraction.  This is true, whether it is the interview segments in the Black Sabbath reunion concert video, or the ""fantasy scenes"" in this film.  Whether or not those scenes are of any interest to fans is one question (most of them are pretty silly), but they certainly don't belong in the middle of the performances.
As far as the performances themselves, they just aren't that good - for Led Zeppelin.  The studio album performances are better.  This may be true of all Led Zeppelin live performances (although I haven't heard enough to be sure), since they don't seem to do anything to compensate for the fact that Page did both the lead and rhythm guitar tracks in the studio - and thus one of the two is always missing in the performances on this DVD.  Other power trios, such as The Who and Cream, simply did not use very many overdubs of lead and rhythm guitar at the same time, but Led Zeppelin did - and I think the studio albums are all the better as a result.  But this live performance seems a bit ""thin"" in comparison.
The other problem - for me - is that the material included is weighted somewhat towards the ""ballads"" rather than the ""metal"" style which was their forte.  This was no doubt designed to increase the breadth of appeal of the film in its theatrical release - probably a good decision in terms of the bottom line.

293144,4,6300270424,"Now, I like Led Zeppelin as much as the next girl, but this movie, from a purely technical standpoint, is hilarious in how terribly it was just  slapped together and sent to theaters.  The beginning sequence, where the  band is sent summons to perform, is choppy and makes no sense at all.  First you have Robert Plant frolicking with his family, then John Bonham is  plowing the back forty, then John Paul Jones (was that his real hair or a  wig?) is reading bedtime stories to his kids, and that whole Jimmy Page by  the lake scene?  For a second I thought I was seeing the Blair witch, but  then I realized that Jimmy just needed some Visene.
The concert sequences  looked like they were cut and pasted from different performances, which I  think they probably were.  You have people in different clothes RIGHT IN  THE MIDDLE OF THE SONG! The camera operators have an annoying habit of  focusing in on the part of the musician's anatomy that has absolutely no  bearing whatsoever on what he is doing during that portion of the song, or,  worse, on a person who is not really doing anything interesting at that  particular moment in time. The sound could stand to be digitally  remastered, and the ""special effects"" are hilarious.  The dream  sequences are so weird they're great.  My favorite is the primitive  morphing of the old man on the mountain (The inspiration for Obi Wan  Kenobi? You be the judge.) into baby  Jimmy Page and back  again.
Technically, this movie would get a film student expelled from  college.  Musically, it's amazing.  Most people will agree that Zep does  not sound their best here, but what passes for an average show for them is  so much better than many acts' best efforts.  For people like me, who are  too young to have seen Zep live, this is as close as we'll ever get.  If  you like classic rock or cheesy special effects, see this movie.  Either  way, it will brighten you day in ways that Led Zeppelin never intended.",967075200,17,1958,4.573913043478261
293145,5,6300270424,"There are three kinds of critics for this film.
The first include ""The ignorant"" They are about 25% of the Zeppelin Fan Base, These  are the complainers about poor film editing, bad sequencing, and they are  quick to point out that it is just another dollar made for jimmy page.
The second type are ""The Easy to please"" They are about 60% of  the Zeppelin Fan Base, These people are those who are absolutely enthralled  that they get to see Jimmy with his bow, John beating his drums with his  bare hands, and the sexual vibe of Robert, and well, Nothing from the  faceless Jones, They don't care about the edits they just enjoy the music.
The third type is ""The Eccentric"" They are about 15% of the  Zeppelin Fan Base, They have read all they can on Zeppelin, Wrote  discourses for high school english class, and used the same document for a  college paper and could tell you everything there is to know about Zeppelin  from the Riot House in LA to the ranch at Bron-Y-Aur pronounced (brom-rhar)  They like to explain to their friends what the ""tripped out""  sequences are about.
Personally much like the second group I enjoy the  music, and the rememberance, I also like the insight to their personas and  I find it hilarious that as much as anyone complains about the quality,  they still end up buying the disc, as other reveiwers have said.
If your  a guitarist, drummer, or was once a pot head you're going to love this  movie.  That's all that needs to be said.
I'm just glad Zeppelin has  something to show for their years on the road.  It's too bad they were  screwed by the original film editor, remember they were lucky to produce  what they did.",966988800,6,1657,4.489932885906041

The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because of the lack of extra's, the only difference is the trailer, other than that it is identical to the video  version. Of course DVD is better quality video and sound, and that makes  this a must for Zep fans everywhere. If you are a new fan to the group this  movie will solidify your enjoyment of the band, and unfortuantely is the  only official release of the band live, with some movie extras with members  of the band.

293148,3,6300270424,"I still consider myself a big Zeppelin fan although I am actually more into Deep Purple now, but I still like to put in the ""Song Remains The Same"" from time to time.  However, many people who are not big Zep  fans will not cotton to this video.  It captures the band on an average  night: the end of the 1973 tour, when they had just been robbed of a  fortune at their hotel.  Plant's voice is not at its best, Page (while no  Blackmore technically) does a decent job but seems grumpy at times, Bonham  plays well, and Jones seems like but a ""sideman.""  As for the  fantasy sequences, well, they are truly vanity pieces.  I always  fast-forward Jones' ultra-lengthy graveyard horse-riding scene in the  middle of the already highly boring ""No Quarter,"" and once you've  seen Page turn into the old wizard once, you've seen it enough.  (And his  glowing eyes when he sits by the lake are cool, if you're about 12!) I kind  of like Plant's sequence though, knowing how much he loves Celtic legends.  Otherwise, this is a somewhat amateurish piece of cinema.  I don't usually  comment on things like this, but in places the sound editing is not quite  up to snuff.  Take for instance the scene early on where Plant is walking  with his kids and a messenger delivers a note.  You hear the little boy  giggling, but no dialogue from anyone else.  No one is going to tell me  that Plant took that note without saying ""Thank you"" or the  messenger saying ""I have a note for you.""  And what about that  opening gangster scene?  Who the hell is that werewolf that jumps out in  the middle of the gunfire?  Even when the band is coming out of limos, you  don't hear any dialogue even though Jimmy Page is coughing and other people  are moving their lips.  Also, what the hell is Plant talking about  backstage when he goes, ""Everybody goes yeah--bash! ""  And what  about that stoned girl outside going ""Any tickets for sale?""  and  everyone just ignores her?  For some reason she reminds me of a girl I used  to date.  By contrast those two kids who bribe their way in remind me of my  friend and I when we were teens.  What an uneven film.  Don't get me wrong,  though, if you're a hardcore fan buy it if you haven't already had it since  the day the video was released!",959990400,,2262,4.386861313868613
293149,4,6300270424,"Okay, now this video isn't a cinematographer's dream, but there is some really talented musicianship displayed in this video.
  First of all, Page pours out his heart and soul into his guitar on this film. I don't  know about you, but I've never seen anything like ""Since I've Been  Lovin' You"". Before seeing this film I had never seen Zeppelin live, I  had only heard their Awesome albums. Page's blistering solos on this and  most other pieces blew me away!
  John Bonham played the drums like he  was on crystal meth at the time. There was one point in the movie were I  thought I had hit the fast-forward button on the remote. His speed is just  plain frightening.
  Plant and Jones also delivered good performances;  however, Robert Plant wasn't in top form on all of the songs.

This DVD is not in Dolby Digital, but what's the point anyway, it's music recorded in the 70's, all you need are two speakers and a whole bunch of watts; anything else is just for show.

They are the worlds primier heavy metal band.  This video includes the best rock song of all time-stairway to heaven. They  are the best, why just listen to Jimmy Page as he electrifies audiences  with is supernatural guitar playing skill. John Bonham was the best drummer  ever, his melodies go great with John Paul Jones' bass & organ playing  to form a band within a band. Then Robert Plant comes with one of the best  rock voices ever, not to mention exelent on stage presentation. If you love  music at all, Led Zeppelin is the band for you.

If you're a  fan, of course you have to own this, but if you're a REAL DIE-HARD FANATIC,  then send some blank tapes to someone in a newsgroup and get yourself a  copy of a performance from the early days or the L.A. shows of '77.

293176,5,6300270424,"This video is great. Especially eerie is when Jimmy is climbing up the mountain while using the violin bow on the guitar,this creates a very creepy sequence that sends chills up my spine when Robert Plant lets out  the most eerie chant ever. I did notice that  Plant wasn't quite warmed up  while performing ""Black dog"" and ""rock and roll"",but as  the show went on his voice became better. Also excellent was the version of  ""the rain song"",which sounded almost identical to the studio  recording. Some of the songs are complimented by fictional sequences,which  are a mixed bag. The sequence of jimmy climbing the mountain as  aforementioned is haunting,and John Bonhams ""Moby Dick"" sequence  is humourous and adrenaline packed. This version of Stairway to heaven is  adequate,and ""whole lotta love' is exellent. If you're a fan i  recommend you buy this,if you're not a fan at least rent.",952041600,,890,4.945945945945946

Contrary to the opinions expressed by others, I sorta  like the little dramatic bits inserted here and there throughout the movie.  They can be cheesy at times, but the Jimmy Page / Hermit of the Tarot bit  in the middle of ""Dazed and Confused"" is really very  cool.
There are, however, continuity problems that any die-hard zep fan  will notice right away. Bad edits, if you will. You can clearly tell that  they cut and pasted two or three performances together, which would be  fine... except for the fact that they do it RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF SOME OF  THE SONGS! They chopped off a huge portion of ""Whole Lotta Love.""
Except for the obvious problems with this film, it's still Zeppelin...  and if you're reading this, you probably are already familiar with the  movie and its contents... after all, most people considering buying this  disk are probably already huge fans, and would buy it no matter how bad the  film was.

Jimmy Page really tapps into ""the Cosmic  Energy"" as Robert Plant described it.  Some music can really stir the  soul and Zeppelin's music really hits the spot.  It takes certain  frequencies to stimulate the sympathetic nervous system and cause one to  feel good; like Hendrix and Pink Floyd they were the masters.

The place was reekin' anna rockin'! I didn't see anybody leave  early.  I still watch my VHS copy, even though I've seen it so many times  it's about worn out. So, it's time to pick up the DVD version.  Check out  Peter Grant laying down the law to the rip-off artists at MSG. Peter is one  of the reasons that Zep was so successful. He's MY kind of manager!
