8075987,5,B000A7S1U4,"These guys are true characters who keep the tradition of western singing alive. ""The Cowboy Way""! Fine singing, sharp wit and your on your way to understanding harmony structure without the dull dry music theory. Great breakdown of song examples with repeated demonstrations of how to vary harmony combinations on a single song. Highly recommended. Let's see another one soon with more songs from your recordings!",1383868800,,413,5.2727272727272725
