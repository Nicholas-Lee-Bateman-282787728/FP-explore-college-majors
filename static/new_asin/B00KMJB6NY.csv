8660127,4,B00KMJB6NY,"I've never watched a running film before, I didn't know what to expect. A bit of jogging, a soppy story? Instead I got an engaging film. Sometimes there was too much running, unless you like that sort of thing, but the places she ran. Man! I've never seen these places in a film before. The geography of this film is quite stunning. The young actress is really good, and its hilarious when her boss is caught in pink underwear trying to tell her how to sell lingerie. The film is a bit too long and some of the camera work is a little shaky, but otherwise, I really enjoyed this refreshing, carefree movie.",1415750400,,606,4.371681415929204
