7101324,5,B00VS01A0A,"This is my first exposure to the Asterix cartoon series. I was indeed delighted. It contains modern political satire in a form that even children can digest. In this episode, Rome wants to conquer the Gauls in Britain by Romanizing them by placing apartment complexes nearby their village. The names of the individuals were mostly Latinized versions modern English words giving the name a significant meaning, a meaning easier to grasp than a J.K. Rowling name. Great fun.",1455408000,,472,5.064102564102564

7101328,5,B00VS01A0A,"Finally! Another Asterix film that follows the spirit and humour of the original comic strip. I am a little bit sad that this didn't get a wide U.S theater release or advertisement, as this would have been the perfect film to try to introduce non-Euros to the beloved and genius series. There are some parts that may throw off completely new viewers as the magic potion is just given a brief brush over, but otherwise, I hope this company continues to adapt more comic books as they did such a fabulous job with this one.",1441497600,2,521,4.494736842105263

8711035,4,B00VS01A0A,"This was released to theaters in 3d in europe. Of course we did not get it here. But you can get the 3d blu ray of this one. It's a animated film and it's in english.  The picture is good and the 3d is great.  If you collect 3d and have a all region player, then get this one.",1488672000,,276,3.6610169491525424
8711036,4,B00VS01A0A,"It is broadly based on the Asterix comic book, 'Mansions of the Gods,' but in many ways, it is very different. It gets a little weary towards the end as if it doesn't really know where it's going. Overall, it's just okay. I wish they had just stuck to the story in the book and left it at that.",1487635200,,294,4.0
8711037,5,B00VS01A0A,Great movie - plays on Region 1 dvd players.  My level 3 French students study French comics and this movie was a greater success than the live action Asterix movies.,1481760000,3,166,4.533333333333333
8711038,5,B00VS01A0A,"I did not know this movie had been made. Delivered in a nice timely manor. I see many other Asterix films out there, but this quality is the style I love best. Very high quality image, almost looks 3D on my TV, but that is the only thing that would make this a better film...MAKE IT IN 3D. It would have been simple to render this into 3D with the software style that this movie was made in. Very fun it educates Americans like me on the story of what Asterix is. Great family fun too.",1481414400,,485,4.0625
8711039,5,B00VS01A0A,"I own over 10 Asterix movies, live action and animated... but this latest installment in 3D rendition is just amazing, mind blowing !!! the story, the action & the faithfulness to the original characters Wow ! by far the Best Asterix movie ever made!  let me just add this... one had to be brought up with Asterix like myself to truly appreciate this incredible production. Two thumbs Way up for all whom participated in this truly remarkable Work of Art.",1480636800,2,455,4.6875
