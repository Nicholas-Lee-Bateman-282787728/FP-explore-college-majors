1378209,4,B00004YS59,"I take OCTOPUS for what I think its producers wanted:  a corny, old-fashioned let's run from the giant monster movie.  Sure, it's effects are no where near what a larger budget would have entailed.  But, still, there are some pretty neat shots, especially of inky's mouth!  Jay Harrington as Turner, is so inept and bungling, it had to be intended.  How many times does the slippery terrorist slip away?  And poor guy won't shoot a gun in cold blood?  Remember---he's not a special agent..he's an analyst.  David Beecroft as the demoted captain has a world-weary edge that gives his performance both a sharp and comic bend.  And with all the crew going psycho after the octopus attack, it certainly lends credence to the government's psychological profiling attempts.  The addition of the ocean liner as the climactic finish also bends convention wisely.  And, hey, we had to let Turner be heroic at SOMETHING!!!
Corny but I had fun!",1081382400,,933,4.8789808917197455

1378211,1,B00004YS59,"Octopi are absolutely amazing creatures.  With no bones, they can reshape their body incredibly and squeeze into tiny spaces.  Their skin can change not only its color, but its very texture.  Their tentacles are much suppler than a human hand, and the suction cups give them a grasp stronger than our own.  Their beaks can break crab shells with ease.  They have a natural jet propulsion system.  Most importantly, octopi are very smart creatures.
So the best this film can do is come up with a giant mutant octopus that can apparently barely move.  It writhes its tentacles about with the lack of control of a newborn baby's hand.  The poor beast is anemic, but rather than chase after a hearty meal of sperm whale, it picks off humans from a submarine.  Now, the thing is bigger than the whole nuclear sub--would a lion feast on field mice, when a tasty impala is waiting around the bend?  This film simply compounds idiocy on idiocy, with ""special effects"" that come from a low budget 50's movie.
And of course, Hollywood has yet to discover the effects of explosive shock waves.  Our plucky hero goes to certain doom with a bomb, deep underwater, yet manages to surface after the explosion without even a nosebleed.
Okay, okay, so it's a B movie--well, no, a D or even F movie; and I'm not taking the proper attitude toward it.  But what's the point of making a movie with a plot so silly, effects so childish (although one shot of the Octopus' mouth is pretty good),  and acting so amateur?  Personally I like my horror films to be smart and scary, not insulting.  Octopus is a total waste of time, not even worth renting.  Get Deep Rising instead, for a really terrific and frightening view of monsters from the deep.",1062201600,6,1723,4.6
1378212,1,B00004YS59,"All I can say is - avoid this like the plague.  Incredibly BAD, amateurish and a total waste of time.  You have been warned!",1052524800,3,124,4.125
1378213,1,B00004YS59,"Man, this was a pretty painful movie. There's like a couple of different plots going on to create this mish mash of a movie. I wasn't expecting a whole lot from this movie, but I found it difficult at times to keep my eyes open I was so bored. And the direction of the movie seems to really suffer from lack of knowledge about how to effectively use particular shots. It was like a shot was set up to offer a moment of suspense, but then there was no payoff, and I found myself asking, ""What was the point?"" Another problem with this movie is that I was able to predict fairly accurately what was going to happen, who was going to live or die. One of the most obvious instances of this was at the beginning when the older agent was talking about how he had been on the job for like fifty years, and is dispensing his wisdom to the younger agent. At some point, I believe he says something about how's he's overdue for retirement...and you can take a wild guess what happens to him. And I found it fairly annoying how the male 'hero' is unable to act like a hero at many key points in the movie, especially when having to deal what's posed to us as the world's most dangerous terrorist, which makes the hero seem extremely ineffective and just plain useless. Actually, I found just about all the characters to be pretty annoying or just plain dumb and that put me in the position of rooting for the octopus, encouraging it to take as many of them as possible. There are a lot of scenes obviously copied from much better movies, but poor dialog, acting, and direction turn this effort into a big, heaping, steaming pile. Maybe it falls into the category 'so bad it's good', but not so much for me. I did get quite a few laughs from this turkey, but purchase at your own risk. You are warned.",1050624000,10,1789,4.295857988165681
1378214,4,B00004YS59,"As schlock fans may have noticed, there have been a glut of straight-to-video creature features released the past few years.  Most of them have been crap, some have been kind of fun, but without a doubt, Octopus is the most enjoyable of them all.  Granted, this isn't saying much, but I'm almost to say this; I actually liked this movie quite a bit, and when it comes to the sea monster genre, the only movie of the past few years to have this beat is Deep Rising, so it's not surprising to see there are plot similarities between the two.
Both films feature a giant octopus and an oceanliner that's attacked by said animal.  But the majority of Octopus is set on a submarine transporting a a dangerous terrorist named Casper (Ravil Issyanov).  Playing his escort is Jay Harrington as young CIA agent Roy Turner.  The captain of the sub, Shaw (David Beecroft), is a rather grizzled veteran, judging from his initially aloof and sarcastic demeanor.  Given the movie's title, it's no surprise to see that the sub will be attacked by a giant sea creature and massive chaos will ensue.
For what it is, Octopus is a pleasant gem.  This is a monster movie with plenty of action, suspense, humor, and even likeable lead characters.  Now how often can you say that about a STV release?  Oh, certainly, it's not without its flaws.  The story's about as silly as you'd expect and the final scenes defy logic, but it's all in good fun.  Really, the only things about the movie that truly bothered me were some of the sets, which are given a cheesy-looking green lighting, which is something that's always been a pet peeve of mine.
From an action point-of-view, director John Eyres does a fine job, given obvious budgetary restraints.  The opening chase/shootout delivers quite a few large-scale explosions and flipping cars, though Eyres does shake the camera during this scene too much for my tastes.  The rest of the action's even more relentless, with more fun gunplay, shaking sets, and an exhilarating finale set onboard a cruise, an elaborate setpiece involving not only a large ship, but also a helicopter and a submersible.
Once the mayhem begins, there's almost no point of let-up. So it's a good thing the cast has a good sense of chemistry that makes them rather endearing, with nice, unforced humor that's good for some belly laughs.  Faring the best are Jay Harringotn as the inexperienced CIA agent and David Beecroft as the grizzled captain, a mismatched pair that grows on you.  Rounding it out as a trio is Carolyn Lowery as an enthusiastic oceanographer.  Oh, she's hot, too, and almost a dead-on for a young Virginia Madsen (and does anyone else find it amusing Lowery was also in Candyman, as Madsen's rival?)
Most of the special effects and sets are really quite good, so long as you remember that is was probably shot on a low budget without any major players.  The monster is the kind of effects work that you know is obviously CGI, but gets more of the ""that's pretty cool"" response than unintentional laughter.  Hey, by the time I saw the tentacles wrapping around an oceanliner, threatening to drag into the sea, I was completely won over.
Octopus isn't the kind of movie that will any major awards, but it's a fun, unpretentious way to spend 100 minutes.  The winning mix of action, adventure, and horror adds up to excitement that not even some big-budget blockbusters could compete with.

I really liked it alot, but from there it starts to go down. I didn't mind the United Embassy stuff but it seems that it is the main focus rather than the Octopus. This would of been better if there were more attacks on ships, if the Octopus is that big you can't expect it to kill people so why not make it destroy big things but it doesn't do that, instead we are stuck with  just one sub, which was boring at times.

1378223,1,B00004YS59,"Thanks to the reviews posted here by other viewers, I didn't waste my money on this stinker, but I felt it was my civic duty to warn others about Octopus. No one is joking about how terrible this movie is, so please don't freak out on any of us. Don't say you weren't warned. Now, if there is nothing on TV, you might be pleasantly surprised by checking out the Sci-Fi channel which seems to truly relish movies this bad (if you still don't believe me, look up Megalodon 3...so bad it's hilarious). I felt the beginning portions of Octopus were a bit slow. At the beginning, look out for the gratuitous pile of watermelons. Yes, you'll see it coming miles away. You know something is going to run into them. Bad acting, bad script, but in summary, if you can get to the scene where the octopus is attacking the cruise ship, you'll crack up.

1378224,3,B00004YS59,"It is the sort of movie you can only expect the stereoptypes of stereotypes, to the degree it must send itself up - eventually anyway. Surely an octopuss with jaws is tongue in sack, err cheek. Or else this film is neo nature unrealism.
  But all I see it for is the monster - the good bits. I was not disoctoppointed.

  Besides all the other movies mentioned that were derived from this (why can't those big Hollywood blockbusters stop copying these films?), add The Abyss (of course) - derivitive diving dialogue, or DDD.

  A shame the beast didn't fall or rise for the blond. Then we coulda had a Titanic love affair... HUBBAH BUBBLE!

THE MAKING OF...
  See the making off, you realise how much effort went into films like this, increasing appreciation.
  A sea of plenty models.
  The making of was actually one of the most thorough, satisfying ones - it showed everything I wanted, but the one big tentacle in action.

1378225,1,B00004YS59,"Before I came to work, I was treated to a screening of Octopus. I thought I knew what would make the octopus a giant evil creature as soon as I saw the nuclear sub, but I was wrong.

It's wasn't a mutant octopus due to radioactivity.

It was an mutant octopus due to artificial anthrax and an iron deficiency.

Buh?

The movie is chock-full of all sorts of bad. The obviously fake submarine bounces and crashes and rolls all over the place, but somehow, maybe due to top-secret gyroscopic technology, the interior is always level. And the interior is very large--unlike what I suppose a real sub might have. I can't imagine your typical submarine having nice and high cathedral ceilings, but this one does. I guess it's a deluxe model.

I don't think any of the movie clichs are skipped. We have our token black guy. We have our squabbling heroes. We have a Shakespeare-quoting bad guy. We have a hot chick. And although there's no nudity, there are plenty of gratuitous underwear shots (both men and women, for equal-opportunity leering). And plenty of people die, often for no plot-related reason.

Although the fun parts are very fun, there are far too many badly acted, slow-paced, octopus-free scenes to make the movie very entertaining.",1117497600,5,1242,4.753488372093023

I feel like I've somehow been violated.

When I was stable and no longer a threat to myself or others, I would brave another ten minutes of this thing, only to have to surface once more.  What can I say of this experience?  Only this: I have a kind of sublime reassurance now, a serenity not unlike that described by others who have had near-death experiences.

1378227,1,B00004YS59,"Let me be perfectly honest: I enjoy campy, stupid, and bad films. So why do I hate ""Octopus"" so much? Because it tries too hard to work every possible worn out subplot imaginable into one movie, with results akin to making Jell-O with gravy instead of water. Some things just don't mix. In the end ""Octopus"" is 100 minutes of tortuous boredom and eye rolling sedation.

I would outline the plot if there was one, but there isn't. There are seemingly hundreds (I lost track after the tenth) of subplots masquerading as a story instead. There is a subplot about the Cuban missile crisis, and the sinking of a Soviet submarine with Anthrax on it. There is a subplot about an incompetent US agent who sees the Sofia, Bulgaria embassy blown up, yet will never use a gun. There is a subplot about a crazy US Navy officer who is the Captain of a nuclear submarine because he has been put out to pasture due to mental instability (yeah, right, that's the way it works.) There's a subplot about a cute female oceanographer along on the submarine who is always playing strip poker and running around in her underwear (and who has a cabin on the sub roughly the size of the Presidential Suite at the Waldorf-Astoria as well as her own personal chemistry laboratory.) There is a subplot about a terrorist loose on the submarine, which ties into another subplot (somehow) about a giant computer generated octopus chasing the submarine through underwater mountains, eventually sinking it. There are subplots about mutiny, cowardice, submarine hardware that has never existed, and the most unfathomable conspiracy ever. This is a conspiracy so big that terrorists have hijacked a cruise liner and plan to rendezvous with the submarine where the terrorist is, then sink it with bombs, yada, yada, yada.... Of course the octopus takes a crack at the ship, engulfing most of it and singling out the terrorists for special treatment. It also downs a helicopter. (Really.) Sound confusing? It is.

This movie is veritably scarred with the stupidest sets, the hokiest creature since ""Robot Monster,"" and possibly the worst acting I have ever seen. No wonder we have never seen these people since. Yes the script is dismal, but the acting would make Ed Wood blush. I would especially like to single out David Beecroft who plays the loopy and arrogant submarine Captain in such an overblown manner that he makes William Shatner look like a positively understated Sir Laurence Olivier.

7927690,2,B00004YS59,"I've never been much into political intrigue stories, so a movie about a foreign terrorist being transported to the US after bombing an embassy in Bulgaria isn't going to do much for me. Even when that terrorist is being transported by submarine while his cohorts hijack a cruise ship with the intention of intercepting and rescuing him. It's just not my thing. But you throw a giant octopus into the mix and you've got my attention.

This pretty much sums up the premise of director John Eyres (SHADOWCHASER) 2000 movie OCTOPUS (story by Boaz Davidson--WICKED LITTLE THINGS--and written by Michael D. Weiss--JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH). CIA agent Roy Turner (Jay Harrignton, ""Better Off Ted"") is far from being an active field agent, so when he and his partner are chasing down the terrorist Casper (Ravil Isyanov, ALONG CAME A SPIDER) through the streets of Bulgaria after Casper has bombed the US embassy, Roy finds himself unable to pull the trigger. Casper almost gets away but Roy's partner Henry shoots at Casper's getaway car with his last breath, sending the hijacked taxi careening into a fruit stand before flipping it over. Roy hauls Casper from the wreckage and the two are assigned to the SSN Roosevelt, piloted by disgraced Navy Captain Shaw (David Beecroft, CREEPSHOW 2), a man serving out the last of his years being kept out of the way. Shaw's current assignment is to carry Dr. Lisa Finch (Carolyn Lowery, CANDYMAN) to an area known as the Devil's Eye, a place in the ocean where, according to Dr. Finch, 27 ships have gone down in the last several years.

By the time they reach the Devil's Eye, most of the crew is already dead and the SSN Roosevelt is grounded at crush depth. Time is running out, but the beast outside--and this thing is MASSIVE--is still hungry. Scanning the area, they discover the remains of the first sub to go down in this area, a Russian sub taken down during the Cuban missile crisis. The Russians had been transporting a variation of the anthrax virus to Cuba, but when the US shot them down, some of those tanks spilled out into the ocean, causing the mutations that eventually led to our heroes being hunted by a giant octopus.

Luckily Captain Shaw has a plan, and he leads the few lone survivors into the submersible where they finally make their way to the surface and are only too thrilled to find a cruise ship directly overhead. What luck! Or not. The ship is taken over by Casper's associates, and all looks bleak for our Captain, the Agent and his girlfriend Dr. Finch. But things look even worse when they realize whatever tactics they thought taking the submersible would result in them escaping the octopus for good didn't work. It's simply followed them to the surface and now, with an entire cruise ship at its disposal, it's got a whole ton more food than it got from the SSN Roosevelt!

OCTOPUS was a bad bad movie, as I'd expected it to be. Everything about it screamed SCIFI Original (although it's not listed on that channel's website as one of their original movies) from the writing to the acting and especially the effects. The DVD included a 25-minute making of feature which showed the construction of the octopus and the various submarine and cruise ship models, so at least the effects were physical--and they looked really good--but the process of putting the humans and octopus tentacles in the same shot was terrible. At various points throughout the movie, I had to just hang my head in shame, sad for the movie over the lows to which it had sunk in terms of effects.

The acting was just silly, as was the script, which relied too heavily on being ""cute"" and not enough on serious storytelling. I know, I know, these movies are not meant to be taken seriously, but for the love of God don't shoot yourself in the foot before the viewer has even gotten a chance to TRY to take it seriously (I will admit, however, to chuckling out loud at one point, although I can't remember now what brought it on).

I think the biggest problem I had with OCTOPUS was the run-time. 99 minutes is a bit much for a movie this low on story. It could have been cut by at least 20 minutes and had just about the same amount of character development and excitement, as far as I'm concerned.

Or maybe the biggest problem was that I went into the movie expecting it to be bad and it didn't disappoint. Nothing pleases me more, when watching these kind of movies, than being shown how wrong I was to judge so quickly. I love finding the hidden gems among the trash. But it happens so rarely, and OCTOPUS was no exception. They set out to make a giant monster movie, and they built their plot around a story about terrorists and a young CIA agent's journey of discovery. It's not a bad premise, if you can pull it off. Unfortunately, they didn't. Maybe OCTOPUS 2: River of Fear will be better.

I'm not holding my breath.",1342656000,,4884,4.586483390607102
7927691,4,B00004YS59,"After just seeing ""Octopus"" and enjoying it for what it is, all these ultra-negative reviews are hard to figure out. What were these critics expecting from a Grade B sci-fi flick from 2000? Sure the script and cast only play it semi-straight, but you can tell they had a good time. Sure the special effects reflect the cartooney CGI of that era, but they get the job done. The question is, is ""Octopus"" entertaining for what it is? Does it deliver the goods, so to speak? Definitely.

The first thing that impressed me was that the filmmakers actually came up with a wildly creative and original plot rather than rip-off one of Peter Benchley's stories (""Jaws,"" ""The Beast,"" etc.), which is what the sequel did, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Octopus-2-River-of-Fear/dp/B000067J2Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Octopus 2: River of Fear</a>"". The story of ""Octopus"" starts in Bulgaria, where the film was shot, with some intense action. A love-to-hate terrorist is captured and needs taken to America. The quickest way to do this is via a dishonored submarine captain who's in the area. To escort the terrorist, the US government is forced to use a CIA agent who is really just an analyst and has no experience being ruthless when necessary, like, say, James Bond. Meanwhile the terrorist's organization seeks to abort this transfer by taking over a cruise ship and intersecting the sub at sea. On top of all this is the titular sea creature, mutated to behemoth proportions, which dwells in the 'Devil's Eye' (similar to the 'Bermuda Triangle') and threatens to put the kibosh on both submarine and cruise ship alike.

Totally outlandish and larger-than-life? Yes, but the filmmakers and cast play it pretty straight with some lighter aspects and humor thrown in for good measure. The film only turns totally outrageous like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deep-Rising/dp/6305090564/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deep Rising</a>"" in the final act but, by then, it's pretty much expected and (for the most part) welcomed.

Aside from the highly creative storyline the film impresses with its five main characters: the world-weary captain of the sub, his black first officer, the CIA agent who doesn't want to be James Bond, the sexy blond oceanographer, and the love-to-hate villain. They're all fleshed-out well and are memorable characters. The viewer comes to care for the four protagonists and can't help but root for them. The oceanographer is intelligent & spirited and looks great when she's ultimately forced to take off her skirt (lol).

The ending is too over-the-top and ridiculous, but it comes with the territory.

The film runs 100 minutes.

FINAL WORD: I was expecting a lame low-budget sea-creature-on-the-loose flick and got a low-budget sea-creature-on-the-loose flick with an imaginative story, flashes of intense action, notable characters, likable protagonists and the ultra-alluring Carolyn Lowery.
