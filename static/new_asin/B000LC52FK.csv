8655703,2,B000LC52FK,"One of Mark Harmon's very very early movies and one i'm sure he would like to forget. It can almost not be rated as worth seeing. It gets a star because the VHS tape (at the time not available on DVD) was in excellent condition and i received it promptly.
It is long and outdrawn - with not much of a story line, bad plot, bad actors and even worse acting.
I watched it once and probably will never again ( unlike my other movies i watch again and again)",1285545600,,454,4.055555555555555
