4641178,1,B005AMJ3CE,DVD quality was horrible and movies are unwatchable,1405900800,8,51,5.5
4641179,3,B005AMJ3CE,I was disappointed with the movies that were included in this set . Most of them I never heard of and the ones yhat I did hear of I wouldn't have view a second time. As usual the box was intriguing . Leads you to think that known actors were included. Before buying this set better do some checking  so your sure about the contents.,1379289600,21,332,4.107692307692307
4641180,3,B005AMJ3CE,Some movies not the best of quality but decent presentation. I a disappointed in the fact no schedule of the movis ar given. You don't know what movies are on what disc. Very irritating.,1372636800,16,186,4.5
4641181,5,B005AMJ3CE,"This box set contains about 20 different movies having to do with the ETO, the Pacific, and the submarine and U-boat war in the Atlantic. This box sets also comes with around 6 to 10 documentaries having to do with World War II. The price of this box set is extremely cheap and well worth it. You will have hours of time spent learning about the greatest generation.",1364688000,3,366,4.397058823529412
4641182,2,B005AMJ3CE,"While the selection of movies is great, the picture resolution is terrible!  It's actually worse than watching them on VHS!  Save your money, and buy something else.",1360022400,44,165,5.074074074074074
4641183,2,B005AMJ3CE,"For the most part I try to give positive reviews, but in this case I am making an exception.  I was really excited about getting this package, but when I started watching the movies I was very disappointed in the film quality.  Sure they are from the 30's and 40's in most cases, but I have seen plenty of other movies from this era and the quality was excellent.  Not here though.

If you want any of the movies contained in this collection you'd be better off getting them elsewhere.",1354579200,58,485,4.355555555555555

8463435,3,B005AMJ3CE,"Not exactly what I thought it would be.  There are some movies (the majority) that I would not pay a dime for.  Subject to lame, acting and director have much to be desired!!  So it was ok.",1459296000,,189,4.054054054054054

8463437,3,B005AMJ3CE,"A rather interesting perspective on WWII, but lots of things are just missing. I didn't really appreciate the collection of highly susceptible ""biographies"" of the leaders of the war. I guess we can never really get real information about the war without our rose-colored glasses.",1436486400,2,280,5.2444444444444445
