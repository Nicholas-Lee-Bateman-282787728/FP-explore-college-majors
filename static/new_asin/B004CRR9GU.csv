8423522,5,B004CRR9GU,"This is a ""Pioneers of Television"" documentary on early kid shows.

I really enjoyed it because as a child growing up in a small Arizona town, we received the Phoenix TV stations.  A big part of this documentary covers the Wallace and Ladmo show which aired on KPHO - channel 5.  It was the type of show that came on in the early evening after you got home from school and was geared to the young teen and under crowd.

Bill Thompson was Wallace, Ladimir Kwiatkowski was Ladmo, and Pat McMahon played numerous characters including Gerald-the spoiled brat.  The show ran in one form or another from April 1, 1954 to December 29, 1989 so I got to see it from early childhood until I left for college in 1964.

The documentary also covers some of the other kid shows like the Romper Room franchise as well as a few local shows from other cities.

It's a great look at kids TV during that not so innocent cold war time when many of us baby boomers were young.  It brought back a lot of good memories of the fun we had watching them.

Definitely a must see if you were a baby boomer during that time period of the 50's and early 60's.",1389830400,2,1129,4.262910798122066
8423523,5,B004CRR9GU,"I've purchased lots of books and studies on the evolvement of children's television throughout the years and have to say that this was the most entertaining and efficient way to get all the information one needs to truly appreciate children's television.  This documentary upholds the integrity one comes to expect from a PBS production, as it covers the early years of local children's programming with highlights from shows like Bozo, Romper Room, Sesame Street and others.  It also includes clips of Jim Henson's early years and interviews with the master's behind this genre.  This DVD is like unlocking a time capsule!  It holds so many gems and reignited my passion to work in children's television.",1349049600,2,705,5.104347826086957
8423524,4,B004CRR9GU,"PBS Pioneers of Television: Pioneers Children's Programs;
I first watched this on TV, and wanted a copy for myself. I'm almost 50 (April 2011) and I grew up watching some of this in the 60's. There is quite a bit about Bozo and his (their) history, Willard Scott is interviewed as the first Bozo on TV.
Romper Room and how it was almost like a franchise.  And Jim Henson and Sesame Street.
I grew up 'here' in Massachusetts - and was disappointed to Not see Captain Kangaroo or Major Mudd on here.
Watching the DVD was my 2nd viewing of it, and like most things - the first time was the best.  It says approx 60 minutes on the box, I don't have my note in front of me, but it was more like 53 or 55 minutes.
Also explains the demise of local kids shows. Focuses on one in Arizona and some others I never heard of. But overall - I'm glad I bought and have it. Fun memories and interesting history. Scott MacNeil.",1301270400,4,911,4.2
