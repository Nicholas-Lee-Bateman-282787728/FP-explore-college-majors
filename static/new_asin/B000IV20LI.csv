8147510,1,B000IV20LI,"It is what it is. Foster Brooks appeared on many shows - like The Dean Martin Show. He played a drunk who staggered, slurred words, used words inappropriately. He wasn't vulgar. He was like Otis from the Andy Griffith Show but with a better education and suit.
Watch a clip from an old TV show before you buy. I bought this for an elderly relative who saw an ad for the Dean Martin Show, and the ad contained a clip of Foster Brooks with Dean. It was funny 40 years ago. I don't think it has held up well over time. My relative watched it twice.",1369699200,,545,4.150943396226415
