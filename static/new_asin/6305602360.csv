1051303,5,6305602360,Really enjoyed this movie! The version I watched was the prereleased one in full screen (the blu-Ray has the theatrical and prerelease version with full or widescreen aspect ratios) And it looked amazing. Reminded me a lot of Henry portrait of a serial killer. Special features are great too. Highly recommend this if your into character study horror films and/or period pieces .,1481760000,5,379,5.031746031746032

1051305,5,6305602360,"THE DRILLER KILLER
Abel Ferrara's old cult Horror classic from 1979 is finally on blu-ray courtesy of U.K. Arrowfilms and is ABC coded
with permision by Abel Ferrara himself
Arrowfilms have added the 1979 Theatrical version 95mins with new 4k scan of the 1980p transfer
in both ratios 1:37:1 which is Abel's preffered ratio and the usual 1:85:1 ratio
so you can choose what ratio you want to watch the film in, i prefer the widescreen ratio if possible in this case it is
i don't like the left/right black bars on the screen but it's matter of personal preference
Arrow's 4k scan of the film does look amazing very nice colour corrected sharp & clear picture quality
probably the best the film has ever looked
while Arrow was doing this new 4k scan with Abel Ferrara, Abel also found a new Extended cut print of the film aswell at 101mins
which is the workprint version so ofcourse Arrow included this new 101min version on this blu-ray aswell
given the same 4k scan as the Theatrical version in both 1:37:1 & 1:85:1 ratios
so you get 2 versions of the film with new 4k scans with 2 screen ratios to choose from on 1 Disc incredible!
the sound quality is only 1.0 mono sound mix which does sound Good but not excellent
a 2.0 master stereo mix would've been much better thru my surround sound system
8/10 for the 4k scan, 4-5/10 for the sound quality
EXTRAS Arrow recorded a new interview with Abel Ferrara earlier this year about his film Driller killer
interesting interview goes for 17mins
there's also Abel's 2010 Doco MULBERRY ST included on this Disc and new Visual essay on Abel Ferrara's career
plus new Audio commentary with Abel Ferrara & moderated by Brad stevens author of Abel Ferrara a moral vision
like all arrowfilms blu-ray's there's thick booklet included aswell
the DVD Disc in this combo set has the same content as the Blu-ray but the picture quality for both versions
is only Digital remaster transfer, not 4k 1080p quality big Difference
Arrow has reissued this blu-ray/dvd in Steelbook packaging & standard blu-ray case both are ABC coded
5 stars for this new blu-ray reissue worth buying for sure",1481414400,2,2120,4.671122994652406

1051307,3,6305602360,"Film doesn't lend itself to the rock 'n roll aesthetic very easily.  It's too controlled, too collaborative, and too artificial to have the same kick as Ramones song.  But there are a few directors who seem tuned into that musical language and have a rare ability to translate it to film:  Martin Scorsese, whose slow motion entrance of Robert DeNiro in Mean Streets set to Jumpin' Jack Flash is a revelatory moment in cinema, is one.  Abel Ferrara, whose eclectic career is full of highs, lows and plenty of cinematic filler is another.

Ferrara, who only chose film after failing make it as a musician, really made a mark with his second feature, The Driller Killer (1979), which earned a spot on Britain's list of Video Nasties and was banned until 2002.  Of course, any attention is good attention when you're a struggling filmmaker and the controversy gave Ferrara enough traction to move on to more polished pictures like Ms. 45, Bad Lieutenant, and King of New York.

But what about The Driller Killer itself?  Ferrara calls it a ""preamble"" to his later work, blending the slasher appeal of Texas Chainsaw with the more experimental approach of directors like Stan Brakhage.  Set and filmed during the burgeoning punk rock era with camerawork that feels as rough and raw as the soundtrack itself, the story, such as it is, revolves around a struggling artist, Reno Miller (played by Ferrara himself), whose frustration boils over and sends him onto the streets packing an electric drill and portable power supply.  Early targets are limited to neighborhood drunks, but as his romantic situation implodes, Reno's new form of expression branches out into his personal life.

Ferrara's film bears only a passing resemblance to the slashers it's modeled after.  To be sure, there's a good bit of blood, but it's rarely convincing and often flat-out amateurish.  It's likely the authentically grungy New York vibe that British censors reacted to, with a layer of filth so thick it fogs the screen, making the violence seem more authentic than it really is.  The Driller Killer is the work of a filmmaker still learning the cinematic language; as such, it's often a slog to sit through, full of youthful pretensions and sloppy technique.  But as the movie progresses, so does Ferrara's skill, resulting in a learning curve that's not always entertaining, but cinematically fascinating.

The director would take a huge leap forward with his next film, Ms. 45, which made it's Blu-ray premiere last year.  But Arrow Video chooses the path least taken by rescuing Ferrara's baby and giving it a high-definition makeover.  Originally shot on 16mm, the film has simply never looked better with enhanced clarity and unbelievable colors.  Viewers can choose to watch in either 1.37 or 1.85 aspect ratios with a 10-minute longer pre-release version included along with the theatrical release.  The special features shine a light on Ferrara's unique (and often amusingly profane) personality with an audio commentary, new 17-minute interview and autobiographical documentary Mulberry Street presented in full.  Along with trailer and liner notes, Arrow adds another superlative ""visual essay"" which explorer every title in the director's filmography from beginning to end.  Essential stuff even if the film itself isn't.",1480809600,,3312,5.128491620111732

A ridiculous punk band moves into the building he lives at and makes a lot of noise that effects his concentration and he slowly goes over the edge and starts murdering random people on the street, its crazy how no cops are around to catch him.

1051342,1,6305602360,"Tedious.  Dull.  A disjointed mess signifying little if anything.  The story features a struggling artist (Abel Ferrara, who also directed) of dubious distinction, who suffers some type of meltdown.  He's clearly identified as having anger issues to begin with (he throws a phone through a window because the phone bill was so expensive.  Leaving him with a window pane to replace).  He yells, he yells a lot, and mopes, mumbles, looks INTENSE, rants.............  Scenes jump back and forth, short in length, higgledy-piggledy.  There are an inordinate number of scenes featuring a loud band, cut to a shot of the Goodyear Blimp, then the band, then the artist sketching a guy sleeping on the street, the band screeching............  It also doesn't help that the main character is a bully and a creep shown in an unending downward spiral that finally turns to murder when this artist buys a Porto-Pak for his drill and hits the streets at night randomly killing people.  In the end, this is just another routine slasher flick shot in a supposedly artsy-fartsy fashion as though that elevates it somehow.  Instead, Abel Ferrara has only succeeded in doing the genre a great disservice by making his film so utterly boring and endlessly repetitious.

I didn't have a problem with the gore level.  There wasn't enough to suit me.  I also failed to see why this movie was labeled as controversial.  I was singularly unimpressed.  Can't imagine ever wanting to watch it again.",1430352000,3,1473,4.975409836065574
1051343,1,6305602360,"What can one truly say about this highly exploitative and utterly mindless piece of garbage?  Well how about wtf?!  Was there really a need for this movie in the first place?  Let's just see.

This movie centers around a troubled New York City painter named Reno Miller.  Reno is struggling to find an inspired concept for his latest painting, his art dealer is a rude, pompous elitist who puts a lot of pressure on him,  his landlord expects rent money from him soon,  his relationship with his girlfriend is becoming strained, and on top of that a loud rock band moved in his apartment building only to make a lot of noise on a fairly regular basis.  To make matters worse Reno's landlord doesn't care a bit about the noise that the rock band make.

As a result Reno who was initially passive and emotionally numb, just snaps.  The incomprehensible thing about his emotional breakdown is he takes all of his frustrations out on the homeless.  Come that point of the movie, the whole thing falls apart.  And that's when he goes from Reno Miller the painter to Reno Miller ""the Driller Killer"".  I mean I get his aggravations with other people but why the homeless?  What did they ever do to him in the first place?  He just invades any alley, street corner, or alley seeking out any homeless person he can find and slaughters them with his drill.  WTF?!!

The acting is this movie is terribly lackluster in that everybody in it is amateurish and wooden in their performances,  the characters are mostly annoying and forgettable, there are way too many filler characters and filler scenes that prove a distraction to the already going nowhere plot.

The sound quality to the DVD is dreadful and requires one to turn their tv up a little high.

The violence is way over the top for no apparent reason.  The main character goes from just stressed out and relieving tension in his anti-social manner to actually enjoying murdering the homeless.  Wouldn't you know it, neither the police nor the news seem to know that anything has happened.  In a City like New York it seems weird that no one would have at least heard something.

The only scenes that were entertaining at all were the scene where one of Reno's sexy female roommates is being taught this song vocable(oob sha doobie) to sing for them,  that scene was a bit comedic,  the sexy shower scene between his roommate and another woman,  and that hilarious scene where the lead singer of the loud band in his apartment building asking Reno to paint him a picture of himself, and while Reno working on the portait of the rocker, he talks to Reno, he reads an excerpt from some book to him, and then he has sex with his hot female roommate.  And through all that Reno is never once distractred.  That scene is one true laugh riot!

Otherwise, Reno only kills 2 people that did anything to get him po'd and that's it.  The ending however is a trifle tough to totally make heads or tails of, but after how unsettlingly dreadful and worthless this sad p.o.s. proved to be who really cares about its ending.",1411084800,2,3057,4.574585635359116

1051345,3,6305602360,"Nine Things about the Film The Driller Killer

1. This movie is about a New York artist named Reno who cant handle the daily pressures of life and has strange visions.

2. When Reno sees a commercial for a portable battery pack, he buys one and uses a power drill to kill homeless people and relieve his stress.

3. This movie is interesting mostly for historical purposes. Its the first movie that underground director Abel Ferrara directed, and he also stars in it. Also, it serves as a bridge between the early 70s slasher films like Halloween and the 80s interest in gore.

4. Its super low-budget, with terrible acting and a terrible script. And random lesbian scenes.

5. But it also has a genuine punk rock sensibility that really works in its favor.  Its an early, grungy, punk version of American Psycho.

6. As a horror film, its pretty boring. Theres a lot of talking, and even more scenes of rock bands playing and rehearsing. Perhaps the movies biggest value is in its depiction of the late 1970s New York punk scene.

7. While mild by todays standards, the kill scenes are more brutal than I was expecting.

8. The movie was officially banned in Britain until 2002.

9. People who are interested in the evolution of the American horror film need to see this. Otherwise, theres not much point to it.",1391126400,,1312,4.592274678111588

1051350,2,6305602360,"This movie initially seemed to have a lot of promise in the slasher flick category.  You have a guy quickly going crazy because of stress and punk rock.  You have an early cordless drill.  You have lots of people in a big city just waiting to be drilled.  The guy quickly going crazy seems to be psychotic.  This movie has everything for a recipe for fear and terror!  I would not count on much fear and terror.

Reno Miller is an artist with a couple of live-in girlfriends, an obnoxious agent, and neighbors that like to practice their punk rock music when he wants to paint.  Reno is under pressure to pay bills.  In addition to the stress, at least one of his girlfriends is ditzy.  The stress is driving Reno crazy, literally.  One day, Reno uses an early cordless drill and starts to have visions.  In a movie like this, you take one drill, add visions, and mayhem is sure to start, and it does.  Reno soon practices his drilling technique on an array of people.  So, is Reno an artist or a budding doctor with a drill?  Trust me; Reno was much better at art than drill surgery.  I consider what Reno did to that poor drill to be drill abuse.

Even though drill surgery without anesthetic sounds bloody, there was a surprisingly small amount of blood.  On the other hand, that sort of special effect requires money and this movie seems like it was very low budget.  Nor was there much excitement in this movie.  In fact, much of the movie was devoted to the rock group next door or downstairs or wherever it was.  It seems like the rock music was a substitute for an actual plot, of which there was too little.  We did have some scenes that supposedly communicated Reno's descent into madness, but I thought the scenes were annoying and tedious.

Few movies have ventured into the sub-genre of cordless drill slasher films.  Considering this movie, perhaps that is a good thing.  It may be that this film has achieved cult status.  I am not a member of the cult.  I found this movie boring and uninspired.  Reno was hardly a sympathetic character.  The special effects were lacking.  Even the sound and picture were lacking, with the sound muddy and the picture needing clean up.

Quite a number of good horror movies exist that are substantially superior to this one.  Go watch one of those instead of this movie.

You've already read several reviews telling you what this film is about. You don't require another. I love this film for its images. I love Abel Ferrara for his sense of daring recklessness. His films are dangerous because they leave you grasping and gasping and left to work out their meanings on your own time. I love Abel Ferrara because no other filmmaker but John Cassavetes  gets so completely inside the action on screen.

1051382,2,6305602360,"The Driller Killer (Abel Ferrara, 1979)

Abel Ferrara and Nicholas St. John have been working together for a long, long time. They'd been doing their thing for years on the indie and porn circuits before The Driller Killer, Ferrara's first feature film (and the first of many scripted by St. John) appeared. And yet somehow this movie still has all the hallmarks of a first film, without really having any of the strengths one expects.

Reno Miller (Ferrara) is an artist, living in Manhattan with two women, Carol and Pamela (Carolyn Marz and Baybi Day, neither of whom ever appeared in another film-- and with good reason). While on the surface this would seem to be every man's dream, Miller is struggling to pay the bills, and to make matters worse, the landlord has just rented the apartment upstairs to a horrible new wave band who practice at all hours of the night. In order to combat the stress, Miller does what any normal person would-- he starts carrying a portable power drill around with him and using it to randomly kill bums on the street.

I'm still trying to figure out why this film was cut for release (two minutes were shaved off for UK release). I haven't seen the cut version, but I'm guessing the majority of the cuts were made in the cheesecake scenes (Carolyn and Pamela are just as happy with one another as they are with Miller, a minor character feature that adds absolutely nothing to the film save a modicum of watchability during one or two of the slow bits) rather than the pedestrian, uninspiring violence (and it's not a time-frame thing; the movie came out a couple of weeks after Dawn of the Dead, shot on a similar shoestring budget, but with far more explicit, and everpresent, gore effects).

In all honesty, I think if this movie weren't known as the feature film debut of Abel Ferrara, it would have faded into well-deserved obscurity decades ago. And really, it's not worth hunting down. Ferrara and St. John got a lot better real quick. * ",1133308800,3,1983,4.638176638176638
1051383,4,6305602360,"This film has gained notoriety and infamy due to it being banned in Britain under the Video Nasties Act. For someone like me, that kinda serves as a catalyst into seeing why these films were banned in the first place ( as well as being a bit of a gore hound as well ). For me though, this is/was the ultimate video nasty in that before I had read so much about this film that I wanted to see it at all costs. In the end I got it cheaply on DVD which I'm pretty happy about.

This film tells the story of Reno ( Jimmy Laine AKA Abel Ferrara ), a struggling artist who slowly goes insane trying to finish his masterpiece while a crap punk band called The Roosters move in and disrupt his space. It's all very realistic as it shows the run-down surroundings that Reno lives under where he regularly sees violence of one sort of another. All this plays on his psyche and gradually he succumbs to violence.

Obviously you know what happens next after he purchases a battery operated powertool so I'll leave you to watch the rest of the carnage from there on. In a sense I'll let you be your own judge on this film because it's not for everyone and I certainly can't judge whether some people would want to watch it. Certainly though, it should be viewed for the amount of notoriety it has picked up if nothing else.

First off, what a concept for a movie, a man who runs around with a drill and kills random people on the street! The storyline was weak and there were plotholes everywhere. Half the movie was made up of unnessecary scenes that were just there to fill time such as: the random lesbian shower scene, the annoying shots of the band practising and the disgusting scene where Reno chops up the rabbit. The reason for Reno's sudden insanity is hardley explained, he just starts drilling bums on the street, oh and by the way I think it might take a little more then one drill hole in the stomach to kill someone! And whats up with the red screen! That was just annoying! This movie is honestly horrible in every single aspect, it has no redeeming qualities whatsoever and all copies of it should be destoryed! Just to make this clear to everyone I am a huge horror movie fan, this movie was just a sorry excuse for a film. The director should hang his head in shame. Cult status for this movie?

1051385,4,6305602360,"First off sorry about the poetry. I have a workmate who keeps saying stuff like this, so I think it's rubbing off on me. I considered banging my head against the wall in frustration, but decided against it on the chance that a strong blow to the head could cause me to become normal (ha ha).

DRILLER KILLER opens with the notice: THIS FILM SHOULD BE PLAYED LOUD.  The film makes the feature directing debut of cult legend Abel Ferrara, and along with MS .45 remains in my opinion among his finest work.  Ferrara is also the lead actor, under the pseudonym Jimmy Laine, Ferrara plays Reno Miller; a struggling artist, living in a cheap apartment with his roommate Carol (Carolyn Marz) and her lesbian lover Pamela (Baybi Day).

Reno is currently under a lot of pressure at work. He has been given one week to complete his next painting or he will find himself unemployed.  That may sound bad enough, but to make matters worse for Reno if he doesn't pay his rent on time his landlord (Alan Winroth) will evict him.  Add to this a deluge of mentally ill vagrants littering the streets outside his apartment block & a Z- grade punk rock group (The Roosters, who sound like The Jesus Lizard, only crappier) rehearsing above his apartment. Despite Reno's complaints the building superintendent won't do anything about it. The noise doesn't bother HIM! All these distractions don't exactly help fuel Reno's creativity, in fact his artwork is not progressing well at all & gets to the point where he has psychotic episodes in which his art ""talks"" to him.

However one night while sitting around watching TV with his roommate & her lesbian lover, an ad comes on for a $19.95 proto-pak drill.

Reno's first victim is a poor defenceless wittle bunny wabbit which he kills by bludgeoning it with a hammer.

This leads to Ferrara's notable homage to Roman Polanski's ""Repulsion"", which the movie is more comparable to, rather than its expected slasher or ""video nasty"" tag of course bestowed by paranoid nitwits who never bother to watch the movies. David Lane: Are you reading this?!

Then he gets his drill... I mean the movie's called DRILLER KILLER, so a hammer wouldn't work. How about a remake with Stallone as Reno? They could call it HAMMER SLAMMER, and Sly sells his own paintings too! Though it's a safe bet his wife pins them on the Stallone family fridge.

Actually, the murders themselves come off as more amusing as opposed to revolting (Watch the movie & you'll understand). PASSION OF THE CHRIST is ten times bloodier than this. Seriously.

A word of warning to first time viewers: It's been noted in some reviews here that others have been disappointed by the film due to its lack of gore. In fact there's only two scenes of graphic violence in the entire movie, & the first drilling, (in which a bum gets it in the forehead) doesn't happen until 40 minutes into the movie & even then, by contempory standards at least, the gore is minimal.. In retrospect its downright bloody daft how this was originally banned in the UK & NZ because a couple of stupid old biddies (namely Mary Whitehouse & Patricia Bartlett) saw a couple of movie posters, & donned their Nazi regalia spewing forth a blatantly fabricated tirade of lies and paranoia to make England & NZ boring, conservative & ignorant just like them. While I'm on the subject of censorship, I think this could have come very close to getting an R16 in NZ if it were cut (something I'm seldom in favour of). Ferrara also composed the Roosters songs under the Lane moniker.

The movie is also chock full of  unintentionally hilarious dialogue aided by Ferrara's (presumably) reefer induced performance. Add to that a good lesbian shower scene thrown in for no other reason than to show some T&A.

The Australasian DVD bonuses only include trailers (but not the trailer for DRILLER KILLER), Ferrara's filmography & an intro by Xavier Mendik, Director Of The Cult Film Archive at the University College Northhampton.  Sounds like my dream job! But alas, alack, he's a pretentious twonk. And the Vidiot hates pretense. The intro's only about five minutes long, but Mendik is a huge bore with his analysis of the themes of ""urban decay"" in the movie.  I'm annoyed that the Australasian release wasn't the same as the one available here with a Director's commentary and Ferrara short films.  That's my only complaint about this.

In summing up, the films detractors will be shocked to know that DRILLER KILLER is not as earlier said, a video nasty; it's not really a slasher and it doesn't actually belong in the horror category either. In actuality DRILLER KILLER is, in my opinion, one of the maverick film-makers best features along with MS .45.  It mixes a gritty bargain basement look and feel with some brilliant camerawork, an effectively menacing atmosphere and a number of simple but very effective setpieces, all of which adds up to a movie that you really ought to see at least once.  I'm definitely going to watch it again at some point in the future.",1092355200,11,5016,4.73593570608496

Driller Killer is a great first film from a promising director who has never caught on or fully lived up to his promise.  The DVD transfer is by far the best I've seen so far - you can actually see the painings and the color scheme in this copy.  The sound is still muddy but much more comes through than on prior VHS releases.

Rambling and comments that have nothing to do with what was on the screen.  great exploitation flick that was never meant to be art-house (a mantle that critics hung on Able).

""The Driller Killer"" is a prime example of how the government, media and some film censors can cause nations to want to see something that simply does not exist! i.e - The most disturbing scenes in a movie ever!!

Hmm . . it's a strange mixture of a film.

However the film is not without its artistic moments -  the opening scene in a church, the reccuring television advert driving our  artist insane, the almost freudian dream-like images of him covered in  blood drilling an un-seen victim, and the soundtrack relentlessly crying  'Reno' as his madness takes its toll.
While not entirely devoid of  violence, this film is definitely one for the obscure art-house film-buffs,  not for the gorehounds.

Somewhere along the way I let my taste in film genre off of it's leash one day and the dang thing went wild. You know when a Horror film fanatic starts watching Musicals, there's gonna be trouble in the neighborhood, but among many other things, I got interested in the films of this Abel Ferrara guy.

Some of his movies were a challenge, but his style really started to to grow on me. This was a Director who not only took chances, but I believe he did so because he FIRMLY BELIEVED IN HIS VISION and would not allow them to be presented in any other way than what he saw as his art.

So I began to desire a revisit of this early Ferrara effort, and after seeing Ms. 45 awhile back and having my senses knocked sideways over it, I knew another date with The Driller Killer was inevitable. When I heard Arrow Video was planning a Director-Approved Special Edition of it, I started remapping my destiny.

Little did I know what was in store for me. Remember what put me off of the film when I was younger? Those are the very same qualities that I loved about it this time around! Only now I see that THIS IS AN ART FILM which is undoubtedly why I couldn't comprehend it as a Horror film back in the day.

One of the many extras provided here is a documentary called Mulberry St. that still haunts me, and that's only a portion of the treats in store.

The plot line is fairly simple. Ferrara stars as well as directs here, playing an artist struggling to make it in New York City. Hes been working on one project in particular, influenced by the violence and street scenes around him and hes being pushed to complete the project. As he continues working to survive and to create his art he slowly descends into madness. Taking to the streets at night he begins killing people with a power drill.

So why does this film get mentioned time and time again, why the notoriety? To being with it was part of the infamous video nasties, a term designating a list of films that at one time were prohibited from being seen in England. That label guaranteed the fact that people would seek out these movies to watch. With that in mind those movies became ones that were watched more than others and thus gained their fame.

The movie has so many flaws its hard to know where to start. The acting is sub-par for even a low budget film. The cinematography is barely passable. The effects are some of the worst with a bright orange blood used in scenes of carnage. The pacing is so slow you may find yourself dozing off from time to time while trying to watch it. The scenes of New York depict the city at its worst. This is not a place youd want to visit. But for some they love that sleazier, filthy depiction of the city that way and bemoan the fact that it was cleaned up later on. Sorry, not my thing.

In the end I found no enjoyment in watching this movie. Ive seen a ton of slasher films and enjoyed many of them. I love horror movies. This one left me longing to go back and watch a good one or at least a passable one. This movie relies on its title and its legendary status to lay claim to fame but as a movie it is one of the worst. Honestly I think I enjoy watching PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE more than this one.

All that being said Arrow Video has gone out of their way to provide the best copy of this movie for fans who still love it.

MOVIE REVIEW

The Driller Killer strives to show you the seedy underbelly of New York City. The film follows struggling artist Reno and his two female roommates, who are low on money and trying to make ends meet. Reno figures once he finishes his epic Buffalo painting, he will sell it and strike it big. Unfortunately, an encounter with a strange man (I assume his father) sets Reno down the path of insanity. Tipping the scales is the punk rock band that moves in downstairs, playing loud music at all hours of the night. Reno eventually snaps (over an hour into the movie that is) and starts running around the streets, drilling hobos.

With a title like The Driller Killer, all I expected was a crazy psycho running around drilling people up in gory fashion. Instead, I got tricked into some weird artsy 70s flick, about punk rock, lesbian showers (which I will admit is the best part) and a tiny, tiny bit of drilling. The only positive I can throw at the flick is the performance from director Abel Ferrara as Reno. He does do an excellent job at capturing the cracking psyche of a struggling, poor artist. Everything else just felt slow and boring. I am sorry, but I do not consider a tension-filled pizza eating scene as avant-garde filmmaking, although it was pretty disgusting watching Reno suck down a damn gross looking slice of pizza.

BLU-RAY OPINION

Okay, I did not like the movie, but like many of my other reviews I have done, I am still willing to praise the Blu-ray, as Arrow Video has made it for the fans. The two-disc set (1 Blu-ray, 1 DVD) from Arrow Video is a sight to behold. Arrow has gone out of their way to give the people everything they can muster up. Were you worried that the film was originally shot in a Full-Frame format, but matted to Widescreen for theatre runs? Dont, as Arrow has included both aspect ratios for all the purists out there. Could you not get enough of the theatrical version and wanted more? Arrow has thrown you a bone and dug up an extended cut, featuring five more minutes of unseen footage, seamlessly branched into the theatrical version. If that is not enough, the Blu-ray features a stunning 4K transfer that keeps the grindhouse look alive and an audio presentation that booms Joseph Delias music loud and clear.

If the movie is not enough, Arrow Video has also served up some pretty substantial special features, some new and some old. We have a new commentary with director and star Abel Ferrara, a new interview with Abel Ferrara, a new visual essay detailing Ferraras career, and finally, the biggest being a feature-length documentary portrait of the New York locations that have played a key role in his work.

VERDICT

The issues I had with The Driller Killer, it being dreadfully slow and lacking enough violence, isn't a reflection on the quality of the Arrow Video Blu-ray. Instead, the Blu-ray is phenomenal and worth every penny for all the fans out there prowling the streets.",1486598400,2,3625,4.6267496111975115
7891995,3,6305602360,"The Driller Killer,"" directed by Abel Ferrara, focuses on Reno Miller (Ferrara), a painter who shares a New York rundown apartment with two lesbians (Carolyn Marz, Baybi Day). He cant make ends meet because hes taking too long to complete his latest work. He is constantly distracted from his painting and slowly loses his mind when a band called The Roosters in the apartment below practices loudly night and day. When pressures become unbearable, Reno grabs a power drill and takes out his frustrations on a harmless vagrant.

This is a film where the title is far more intense than the actual movie. Like the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Driller Killer sets the viewer up for quite a fright fest. Unfortunately, the film kind of lumbers along. The first killing doesnt occur until about 40 minutes in, and only two are particularly bloody and gruesome. Most of the time, the film is laid back, a quality most fans of gore cinema don't appreciate.

Ferraras background was in porn. This was his first non-porn movie, and it reflects a director not completely sure of himself. Performances are stiff, and opportunities to build suspense aren't properly tapped. He spends a great deal of time letting us know Reno and establishing his devotion to art, but payoff is meager. What is successful is the depiction of the New York punk scene of the late 1970s and the type of lifestyle that gave birth to punk. Cinematographers Ken Kelsch and James Lemmo contribute rich atmosphere to the night scenes. Ferrara reveals his porn background in a lurid shower scene with ample close-ups that has nothing to do with the story, and exists purely as exploitation.

Bonus features on the newly restored unrated Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack include audio commentary by director and star Abel Ferrrara; brand new interview with Ferrara; visual essay guide to the films and career of Abel Ferrara; Mulberry St., Ferraras feature-length 2010 documentary portrait of the New York location that has played a key role in his life and work; theatrical trailer; and reversible sleeve containing original and newly commissioned artwork.",1481932800,,2117,5.0256410256410255
