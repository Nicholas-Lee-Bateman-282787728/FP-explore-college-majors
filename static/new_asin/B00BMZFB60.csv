8571261,1,B00BMZFB60,"He starts right out talking about what's in his pants and never gets off the topic as his profane words get more filthy.  Typical male, his brain has only BM, homosexuals and sex topics.  God actually said that if ""men"" refused to rise to the Spiritual office of HEAD of the family *which means to put the Kingdom first by meeting with God every day for the purpose of receiving the wisdom of God, to pass on to the wife and children in order to pass on on the righteousness of God to each generation), then God will curse men by causing them to become lovers of themselves.  When men mock and reject God they are NOT head of anything nor will they ever reach their potential.  That's the reason these men say they ""need women to keep pumping them up"".  They think only in the flesh, it is GOD that they NEED.  Their piece of flesh has become their god.  They believe espousing their love for it is funny, interesting and entertaining.  The new meaning for comedian is : ""one who worships his own flesh.""  God told man to ""Be the head, not the tail"".  Men don't need a stage to prove God right, women already know it.",1505606400,,1117,4.301435406698564
