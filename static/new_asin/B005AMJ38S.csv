4641153,4,B005AMJ38S,Although the box of dvd's are good I found out that the description for the DVD MPAA ratings were incorrect. The dvd of Chato's Land is rated PG not PG-13 as described. The other two dvd's are not rated. Otherwise the set is good.,1353283200,,230,4.25
4641154,5,B005AMJ38S,"This collection is just like buying the movies on DVD through MGM. All three of these movies are in Widescreen and the picture is really great. There isn't a menu, except the three choices for the movie in which it just takes you to the start of the movie. Overall if you don't already have these films, I would recommend this set.

4641186,2,B005AMJ38S,"There is one good movie in this group - Chato's Land.  The other two movies are ridiculous, predictable, and boring.  The Way West is an abysmal visual depiction of the excellent book by A.B.Guthrie.  Read the book and avoid the movie like you would a kiss from your aunt!  Escort West is a black and white disaster that should never have been filmed.  Victor Mature's talent is wasted  in this boring, ridiculous tale.",1421452800,3,419,4.671232876712328

4641188,5,B005AMJ38S,Two great movies and one mystery.  I have seen escort west only one time and not even the entire movie.  The other two movies are understated classics.,1417737600,2,151,4.555555555555555

4641190,2,B005AMJ38S,Image quality is OK. It has to suffer when you cram so much info on one disc. The best picture of the bunch is Escourt West. The Way West is an embarrassment. Chato's Land is what you'd expect from director Michael Winner.,1410566400,,222,4.309523809523809

4641192,5,B005AMJ38S,"The Way West is one of the best depictions of the western movement wagon trains that I know of. Saw this in the late 1960s at the old local theater and always remembered the challenges our forefathers faced heading west. When I came across this, I bought it to own a copy. What a tough life, with tough choices they had to face. This is an American History Classic in my book.",1409702400,7,376,4.236111111111111
4641193,3,B005AMJ38S,"The Way West as it was partially filmed here in Sunriver, OR where we live, so primarily just wanted to see the backgrounds...for the price is was so so.  Did not watch the other 2.",1405468800,,181,4.171428571428572

4641195,5,B005AMJ38S,the best of the three was Charles Bronson and Chato's Land........ an invader cannot beat a native who is fighting for his own land.,1403308800,,132,4.541666666666667
4641196,5,B005AMJ38S,All three movies were great.  I had seen them all before but bought the DVD mainly to get The Way West.  No extras but so what.  I just wanted The Way West at a decent price.  I am a big Richard Widmark and westerns fan and wanted the movie for my collection.  I highly recommend the DVD as the quality was great also in both sound and picture.,1394928000,6,344,4.0
4641197,4,B005AMJ38S,"I bought this for the films, The Way West and Chato's Land. The Way West features the trio of stars (Kirk Douglas, Richard Widmark and Robert Mitchum) in a tale about settlers heading toward the Willamette valley in Oregon. It has drama and beautiful scenery as the backdrop to the tales of the journey west, forbidden love, cowardice, deception, bravery and hopeful dreamers. Escort West is a standard western featuring Victor Mature as a noble former Confederate officer who is the last hope of the surrounded cavalry, two sisters, and an emancipated man. It is shot in black & white and has decent drama and some action. The last film, Chato's land is another version of one man who is the subject of bigotry and hatred. He is hunted by a posse of adventure seekers, bigots and so-called neighbors much to their misfortune. There is a rape, violence and betrayal in this powerful western. Charles Bronson and Jack palance shine as the two main protagonists.",1394496000,12,960,4.824242424242424
4641198,5,B005AMJ38S,"I loved the Way West - some great actors giving it their best - Kirk Douglas, Robert Mitchum, Richard Widmark. And it said this was Sally Field's first movie!!!
Escort West was an average western.
Chato's Land was different, but time has made it seem a bit dated with it's 70's music score. Must have been an Italian film. Charles Bronson was good, but Jack Palance stole the film.",1379462400,4,381,4.536231884057971
4641199,3,B005AMJ38S,Chato's Land is why I ordered this product.  This version stated it was unrated.  But the movies are all unrated except Chato's land which is rated pg.  I already ordered and received the PG Rated version from amazon,1378425600,,216,4.631578947368421

4641201,5,B005AMJ38S,For the price these were three great movies. We enjoyed every one of them. Well worth the price. Don't be afraid to buy this if you love westerns.,1365897600,,146,4.25
4641202,4,B005AMJ38S,"For those of you who love the classic westerns, you will not be disappointed in this trio. My favorite was The Way West. It has a slew of very talented actors (Kirk Douglas, Robert Mitchum and Richard Widmark). I would highly recommend this DVD to those of you who are addicted to good westerns.",1364342400,,295,4.481481481481482
