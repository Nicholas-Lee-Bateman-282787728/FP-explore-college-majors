8476109,1,B005JY5G7O,"did I miss something in the description of this dvd?  I didn't expect it to be a children's pageant, interesting, in my mind, to only the relatives of the, ""actors.""",1483660800,,165,4.5
8476110,5,B005JY5G7O,"My children (7 & 10) truly enjoy this version of the story of St. Bernadette. They learn something new each time they watch it, and haven't grown tired of it after watching it 4 times.",1470009600,,184,4.285714285714286

8476112,4,B005JY5G7O,"My wife and I both found the DVD to be very ""moving"".  We showed it to our grandson who said he wanted to learn to say the Rosary after seeing the DVD.  It does not get better than that.  On the other hand some adults may be distracted from the use of young actors playing all of the parts.  e.g. the police chief actor is a teenager.  The Blessed Virgin Mary is a teenager.  For me the use of young actors worked.",1381363200,2,414,3.9878048780487805
8476113,5,B005JY5G7O,"I loved every aspect of this movie. It was a joy to watch! I loved the unique perspective of children playing all the parts in the story, and playing them well!",1370563200,,160,4.193548387096774
8476114,4,B005JY5G7O,"I generally consider it unwise to do a movie with a cast of -only- children.  Occasionally, there's a child actor who knows what they're doing, but most of the time, people just don't have any faith in all-child casts, and so, a film like this one would wind up with very poor sets or costume-design, or with several lousy shots, which could have been done over, to make them look better, and while I will admit that many of the children in this movie are clearly reading from cue-cards, I was surprised by just how many of the key players in the piece were convincing.

Bernadette, to start with, and the skeptic, the priest, and although he played a somewhat cliche part, I though the police commissioner did a fine job acting it out.  Some actors were truly bad, and others just average, but there were just enough good ones, and in the right places, that the movie is enjoyable nonetheless.

As for the rest, I was genuinely shocked by how good the costumes and sets were.  For the most part, they actually looked convincing, which is hard to do when you're dressing kids up as military guards or saracens.  I was particularly impressed with the scene, near the very beginning, of dozens of kids, all dressed up as saracen invaders and Charlemagne's troops, charging each other from either side of a field, and battling it out as best they could.  Clearly, some significant manpower, and expense for costuming was needed to put just that one scene together, and it wasn't lost on me.

There is a narrator, but only briefly at the beginning and end of the film, so I didn't mind him so much.  What surprised me, though, was that while there is humor in the movie from time to time, it doesn't generally play up the humor of having an all-child cast, preferring to play the story almost completely straight, regardless, and here's the weird part; it actually does a pretty good job of that.

The sight of kids in nun outfits, or wearing soldier's uniforms did throw me off just a bit, but not as much as I might have expected it to.  I'd like to give it a slightly-less-than-perfect grade, but to be honest, it's amazing they were able to do so much with the cast they had.  I was very impressed, overall.",1362268800,3,2207,4.517587939698492
8476115,5,B005JY5G7O,"Grownups loved this moviie, too. All the actors are children, but they do a very believable performance. Once you get used to the fact that they are all children the story is completely believable. Kids watch it over & over.",1357516800,4,224,4.625
8476116,5,B005JY5G7O,"This presentation is well written, with very nice scenery, and very appropriate and pleasing music. It is dedicated to Catholic children, who ""are the future of the Church,"" and this makes a lot of sense as the actors are all aged 20 or younger. No adults are in the cast. The story has many moving and funny moments, and respectfully portrays Our Lady's apparitions at Lourdes.

The director and writer, Jim Morlino, did research and used a historical person, Estrade, to narrate the story. Estrade went from skepticism to belief in the apparitions and became a friend of St. Bernadette. His writings on Lourdes were used very effectively by Morlino in the movie.  The teenage lead actors gave moving performances, especially Genevieve Morlino, who played Bernadette. The credits indicate that in the battle and crowd scenes, 166 children participated; it was delightful to see them.

As someone who's 60-plus,  I found it a little disconcerting to see police guards, soldiers,  and nuns portrayed by people less than 4 feet tall! At the end of the movie, one of the sisters makes a joke that indicates the writer/director is aware of this incongruity. I also found the consistent mispronunciation of the word ""imbecile"" puzzling, but the director explains that it is Bugs Bunny's pronunciation; the people making this movie were having lots of fun!

This movie shows the everyday faith of regular Catholics in a way that makes me hopeful for the future! I will be sharing this DVD with others, hoping that they also enjoy it. Highly recommended!",1306195200,13,1547,4.976744186046512
