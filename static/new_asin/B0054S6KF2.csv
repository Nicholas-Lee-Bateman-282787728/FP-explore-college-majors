8456994,4,B0054S6KF2,"At age 12, William (Aj Nicol) was convicted of killing his parents and his three year old brother. He escaped the death penalty because of his age. He has offered his story to a ""lazy"" reporter in exchange for experimental suicide pills from his wife's pharmacy. Ryan (Christopher Hatherall) wants the story, but has to work for it. It stresses his relationship with his wife (Siobhan Bermingham) who believes he is having an affair.

William speaks in cryptic messages as Ryan attempts to piece together the events and most of all, find the location of the three year old, whose body was never found. William has his own issues and frequent prostitutes for arousal, but then he goes and works out in the bathroom.

This is not a horror movie as the back of the DVD suggests. It is a drama about a crime. Nor does it have ""Occult images"" and I wouldn't call what I saw ""graphic violence"" either.

The film does contain discussions about suicide. This is a drama that has a slow developing twist that makes it seem like a gentle curve. You see it in the distant and it becomes more apparent as the film goes on. We get to feel what Ryan fells in the film. Kudos Simon Tate.
