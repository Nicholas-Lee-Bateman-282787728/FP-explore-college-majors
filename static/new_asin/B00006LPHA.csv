But here is a twist for you to catch, Micheal may not have been the killer in H20! Or I bet that there was to killers in H20 and Micheal was not the man who was decapitated. I will go see it the first day it comes out! If you are a fan of horror movies, go see this!",997660800,,371,3.5365853658536586
1785690,4,B00006LPHA,"i think this movie is going to be good and promising to fans of the previous ones. Here is what i know about the movie so far: Jamie lee's character is in a mental institution. And micheal comes back from the dead to kill her. The rest of the cast that i know of is : Sean Patric Thomas (Save the last dance) Busta rhymes (rapper) and tyra banks (model,actress)",997574400,,361,4.171428571428572
1785691,2,B00006LPHA,"The Halloween machine chugs on, most likely following up on the alternate track the series has taken, in which Laurie Strode didn't die, there are no Druids and Myer's head is lobbed off in the end. It's just as well since no matter how M is brought back the series cannot resurrect its greatest asset which was the late Donald Pleasence. Dimension hyped up the return of Jamie Lee Curtis, but let's face it. She was simply the hapless victim not unlike you or me, while H20's hoo-haa about her conquering her demons was just an attempt at giving weight to an otherwise limp story. It was Pleasence's Dr. Loomis and Myers who were the true diad with each movie following the same pattern: Myers, obsessed with killing shows up, followed by Lomis obsessed with bringing him down. Pleasence's performance lent true gravity to the situation. We believed him when this accomplished psychiatrist called Myers Pure Evil and knew the most scientific method of dealing with him was to, say, blow Michael up (after all he studied Myers his whole life). Halloween 6 actually had a different cut that what was finally theatically released (the original known now as the rarely seen Producer's Cut) but I believe the quite hokey final cut is the best way for the original Halloween plot track to end, with the ambigous final shot. We get the sound clue of Loomis screaming (being killed by Myers or simply fighting with him) and the visual shot of the mask without its owner (a clue that perhaps Myers is the one being finally put out of commision) There is nothing else to reveal and no other way to end the series except with the final bout between the two old foes, the winner's identity left open if there is one at all.
It's not clear who the hero of the latest Halloween would be. Hopefully the filmakers would copy the move they did with the last one and include an exceprt from Loomis' dialogue as a memorial. After all can there really be any one else with the mettle to take on Myers?",997315200,15,1982,4.570224719101123

1785750,3,B00006LPHA,"A good but never really great chapter in the 'Halloween' series. A decent script and good direction are hurt by corny, some just down right terrible performances. Sure, this is not exactly supposed to be an acting lesson, but the cast choices clearly hurt the film. It does have a few scary, intense moments, but nothing memorable or noteworthy. The best performance is from JLC, who didn't even want to be in the movie, but got offered a huge pile of loot to get killed in the first 5 minutes. I'd call this a must have for die hard fans of the franchise, but even they might find it a bit bland. Its worth seeing, but nothing spectacular.",1480809600,2,640,4.432203389830509

1785782,3,B00006LPHA,"They tacked a mini-movie in front of their very short feature and decided to call it a day.  The opening sequence serves as a bridge between the last movie and this one only because they wanted Michael Myers to continue his rampage.  To accomplish this, they needed to show that special guest star Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) decapitated the wrong man.  Not one to let a good grudge go by, Michael shows up at Laurie's home away from home, a sanitarium, to deal with her once and for all!  And he does.  Fin.  End of story.  That's all she wrote.  Except, someone wanted to move the series along with a new installment.  And so, instead of going after Laurie's unmentioned son, Michael goes home and finds squatters have invaded his domicile.  Without a decent rent agreement, Michael has no choice but to evict them with extreme prejudice.

They brought back the old theme song and filled the cast with questionable actors and Tyra Banks.  With hidden cameras and bad editing, they sought to give the film some much needed snazz.  But.  This movie is too disjointed, too disconnected, and at times too dull.  This series ended with a whimper.",1445644800,3,1148,4.67

1785814,3,B00006LPHA,"First off, I am, and have always been a huge and loyal Halloween\Michael Myers fan, so I don't want anyone out there thinking I am some amateur to the series. I am a loyalist, and even recently picked up the new boxed set which was pretty good, and worth the price (I got it here on amazon a few months ago on sale for less than 100$!) So, with that being said, I know what I'm talking about when it comes to Haddenfield!

I myself, like most people felt when this movie first came out it was just another ploy to crank out another sequel to milk the franchise dry, and it WAS, but isn't that the point of EVERY sequel, good or bad! It is called show business, there's the SHOW part and the BUSINESS part!

I waited, opting not to see it in theaters, but on DVD, and when I saw it I too thought it was pretty ridiculous, and one, if not the worst in the franchise. And it IS! But having taken a second look at the film recently after buying the box set, I must admit, I LIKED it!

The main reason so many people are upset with this entry in the series is the fact that it seems to pee all over the pretty impressive work that went into H20, suggesting that the whole time it must have been an imposter Michael Myers when obviously they DID KNOW they just would not tell you that when H20 was in theaters, even though they new then they really had no intention of ever killing off Michael Myers.

So, I get why people felt duped, but we shouldn't fault this movie or the film makers, because after taking a second look, it's actually pretty decent.

The first thing people tend to forget or overlook (this is something I have always admired about the film) is the opening Laurie Strode death scene. I think a lot of people overlooked this scene because they were still butt-hurt over them killing off the most popular character in the franchise as well as the fake Michael Myers H20 thing, but this scene alone isn't just good, it's BRILLIANT! From the direction, to the writing, to the editing, to the great performance from Jamie Lee, to the crazy serial killer obsessed guy that Michael hands the knife to when he's done with Laurie, even the cinematography is great. Everything in this scene is pitch perfect! It's just good film making! Now, for the rest of the movie, well...it reminds me of A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: Dream Child, if you take that film out of the context of ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" it's a pretty interesting take on a horror film (a metaphor for teen pregnancy) but when put in the context of the the Nightmare series you tend to think ""Freddy's having a baby, what""? Same thing with this film, group of college kids spend the night in the house of a notorious killer while broadcasting it all on the internet, doesn't sound half bad, right? But being put in the Halloween series you tend to think ""Michael Myers is killing people on the internet now, what""?

Watch the movie without thinking the killer is Michael Myers, say you call him just ""Crazy Jack,"" whatever, the point is you will see a whole 'nother movie that is well directed, well paced, well acted, well written, well edited, funny in spots, and there's even a little good 'ol gratuitous nudity thrown in.

And before I end this review I can't not mention the other thing people tend to hate about this film, Busta Rymes. I know people to this day are so appalled that they would let a rapper disrespect our beloved Michael Myers, please people, RELAX! The whole point of bringing him into the the film was for COMIC RELIEF! He was suppose to be funny which he WAS! That scene where he is dressed like Michael Myers and unknowingly encounters the real Michael Myers is one of the funniest things I have ever seen. I nearly bust a gut every time I see it. It's HILARIOUS! He did what he was suppose to do in the film, present laughs, which he did well! Whatever problems they film may have he is not one of them!

I think if you give this film another look, you will find that it's not that bad, pretty well made and an enjoyable watch!",1436832000,,4028,4.347074468085107

It was a great movie and really kick started the slasher genre but it want earth shattering. Now i am a huge Halloween fan. But for me it should have ended with part 2...So needless to say this movie is overkill...H20 ran with the Scream generations new interest in the slasher Genre. It needed to be more self aware and witty. Now not that h20 was amazing but it at least tried ya know? This movie just lacked in all aspects...The cast was ehhhh, Busta rhymes? Dude was way over the top and just ridiculous. That approach works in your music but doesn't translate to film...And this movie bumbles through slasher cliches in an embarrassing fashion...The promiscuous girl-The guy who's into the Promiscuous girl, The Goody Goody girl and then add the THEN new web cam Era technology inclusion that is just corny...And the worst aspect of all Michael Myers in this movie just has no presence.

1785821,1,B00006LPHA,"I saw this with my now dearly departed father in 2002.

I found it suspenseful and intense in certain parts I also did not mind the Michael in this movie.

However the beginning of the movie ruined the entire film as did the stupid concept with the webcams and crap.

When I originally watched it I found the concept...interesting somewhat unique at least.

I also remember almost falling asleep more then a few times because this movie was pretty damn boring.

The characters were all dispensable and almost everyone of them was either cocky or just flat out annoying.

The lead actress taking over for Laurie Strode will get too that in a minute was okay in her role I liked her originally up until the end of the film when she saved a character I truly wanted too die with a passion.

Then I wanted HER too die immediately.

Busta Rhymes what can one say? He cant sing for s!%^ he also cant act for s@!^ he was basically himself just more cockier if even possible with that douche.

He was one of the most obnoxious and unlikeable characters in this film by far.

Thomas Ian Nicolas was a stereotype a horny boyfriend who wanted some from his annoying girlfriend we all know what happens too guys like that in a horror movie.

Katee Sackhoff who I think is normally a wonderful actress as well as likeable in real life was totally obnoxious in this film and it really sucked that they wrote her character the way they did.

She was not only obnoxious but also ditzy stupid and braindead too boot.

The rest are actors I cant even remember their names except Tyra Banks who didn't have much ACTING ability in this film and didn't last long either.

She was also a stereotype horny black woman with sass thrown in for good measure.

The writing in this movie was absolutely horrible.

Then there are the teens watching at home and the guy helping the main girl try too survive they were also cocky and unlikeable.

I was rooting for them as well as the equally boring and dispensable teens who join the slaughter party near the middle of the movie too also die.

Literally there is hardly anyone whatsoever in this movie that you actually want too survive including the good looking moody so called macho guy with the leather jacket.

Or the trampy red head who just wants too get laid yet actually acts as if she has scruples lol

Or the black guy who loves too cook and also acts cocky from beginning too end...what a moron this one was especially.

Oh did I mention Laurie? Silly me well no worries there pay no attention to that mention considering shes only in the movie for about 5 freaking minutes if that.

Yes SPOILER ALERT!!!! They kill Laurie off in one of the absolute stupidest ways possible and they also insult the intelligence of the viewer by actually making us think the once clever smart and creative Laurie could actually be this clueless stupid and wreckless.

After killing Laurie Strode this entire movie was a total waste of my time from then on there.

Extremely stupid move no wonder so many Halloween fans think this and the Halloween remake sequel are 2 of the worst entries into the franchise I agree completely.

Oh and did I forgot too mention theres some very dumb scene where the main actress lets out this unbelievably grating scream ...due too a light falling behind her and shattering?

Yeah this one was a real winner  sarcasm detected sarcasm detected.",1411689600,,3391,4.543657331136738

1785825,1,B00006LPHA,"The worst in the series, after H20 delivered such a great sequel, this delivered a humongous dud. The premise was okay but I felt it should have ended in the previous film. One of the worst things of this film was the inclusion of teen wisecracking and stupid jokes. The acting was stupid at times with not much horror nor true feel of being pursued.

The other bad thing I found about this movie was the inclusion of Busta Rhymes and Tyra Banks. Neither added anything to the film, just occupying movie time. This movie gets a 1/10 in my book, a true lackluster in the series.",1409529600,,577,4.392523364485982
1785826,1,B00006LPHA,"The original Halloween is a classic, and the first three sequels, including the unrelated Halloween III, are excellent, but after that, the quality of the franchise takes a noticeable decline.  Halloween 4 was the last installment of the franchise that was truly good.  Halloween 5 and 6 (""The Revenge of Michael Myers"" and ""The Curse of Michael Myers,"" respectively) were merely so-so.  ""Curse,"" in particular, with returning the story to Smith's Grove and bringing back the grown up character of Tommy Doyle, had a chance to be an excellent sequel, but still failed to live up to it's potential.

This........is terrible. It's a movie that should never have been made.  Halloween is a victim of it's own success, in that it's a franchise that has been terribly saturated, worn out, and overdone.  Each sequel in this franchise has featured progressively less and less continuity to its predecessors, and with ""Resurrection,"" they hit the bottom of the barrel.  By this point, all continuity is gone, and any connection to the rest of the series is nonexistent.  It was clear that the franchise was - literally - bled dry, and that the writers had nothing new to offer whatsoever.  This is just another mindless, clich&eacute;d slash fest, with the Myers character hacking up a group of random, obnoxious teenagers in an old house (one that was billed as the ""old Myers house,"" but of course bore no resemblance to the actual ""old Myers house""), with another group of random, obnoxious teenagers watching on webcams.  And although Jamie Lee Curtis is emblazoned prominently on the cover, don't be mislead.  Curtis does return for one final, uninspired performance as Lori Strode, but her character is quickly (and finally) disposed of in the first five minutes.  Don't waste your time, and more importantly, your money, on this one (or the equally bad Rob Zombie remakes, either).",1406851200,,1881,5.012861736334405

It just doesn't fit with the overall message that every other Halloween movie has issued (with the exception of Halloween III of course since it wasn't about Michael whatsoever). They would have been better off keeping the movie the way it was for the first 20 minutes or so until Laurie dies, then go after either John (Laurie's son from H20), Jamie Lloyd's newborn baby (from The Curse of Michael Myers), or both. I mean after all both John and Jamie's baby both live at the end of each their perspective movies right (unless I'm supposed to assume Michael has killed them both before Resurrection has even started)? And even if Michael has killed both character's off before Resurrection, it would have been nice to know how that happened.

The beginning was good (but infuriating), I enjoyed watching the teens in this movie, I got excited in some scenes, nervous in others, I laughed and shook my head in others. I like how fast paced many fight scenes were and I thought it was simply a nice fun time.

But this movie did have flaws in it. The beginning was a slap in the face to many Halloween fans and the explanation between films didn't make sense (what happened to Laurie's son?). This film really didn't have any reason to exist except for being a cash grab (just like most Friday the 13th movies). The teens are very sterotyped and why would Michael go back to his old house?

1785859,3,B00006LPHA,"I guess this is the last (so far anyway) entry into what I consider the ""original"" Halloween story before Rob Zombie re-launched the series with his films. I have to say that I really enjoyed ""Resurrection"" and it could've been so much better if only they had made better casting choices.

""Resurrection"" begins a short time after the end of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halloween-H20-HD/dp/B009K52CEI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halloween H20 [HD</a>], we see that Laurie Strode is now locked up in a mental institution (not Smith's Grove unfortunately), and is in a semi-comatose state...or so we are lead to believe. See it seems that when Laurie thought she had killed Michael at the end of the last film, she actually killed an EMT who had been attacked by Michael and forced to wear the infamous mask. With a crushed larynx, the EMT couldn't tell Laurie who he was and lost his head for it. Does this make sense? Hey..why not, at least it's better than the whole Thorn conspiracy from 4, 5 & 6. We discover that Laurie is only pretending to be disconnected and is shoving her meds in doll, biding her time until Michael's inevitable return.

No spoilers here, and I have to say that this beginning really works. The mood and feel re-capture that classic ""Halloween"" vibe that ""H20"" tapped into. But right from this opening segment we meet the real cast of the film, and it's the usual group of stereotypes who have signed up for a reality show called ""Dangertainment"". This group of kids will be staying in the Myers house on Halloween night. Each will be wearing a head-cam and the whole house has been wired with cameras so that viewers can watch the proceedings live online.

Of course once they are trapped in the house, it's not long before Michael shows up and begins hacking his way through the cast. There are some neat elements here, like when the final girl begins texting with a friend who is watching the events unfold and he's guiding her away from Michael, and for the most part the acting is on par with a slasher flick, with Katie Sackhoff from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Battlestar-Galactica-The-Mini-Series-HD/dp/B002VELCNC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Battlestar Galactica:The Mini-Series [HD</a>] playing one of the hapless teens.

Where the movie goes off the rails is by inserting Busta Rhymes into the mix. LL Cool J did a great job in ""H20"" and I guess the filmmakers wanted to run with the idea of adding a rapper to the cast...who knows? The problem is that he is painfully bad, just horrible and every time he appears onscreen I'm taken right out of the movie. It wouldn't have been as bad if he played a minor role, and maybe popped up here or there to provide comic relief, but he's all over this thing and you don't buy it for a minute. I was really hoping for a horrible death for this character about 2 minutes into his first scene.

This is far from the worst entry in the series, and there is actually quite a bit to like about this film, and if it weren't for that single character, I think this film would've been regarded with as much love as the original films and ""H20"" seem to get.",1382659200,,3218,4.9408502772643255

1785861,4,B00006LPHA,"The decision to watch a Halloween this time around was an easy one. A couple of weeks ago we read the novel that the legendary original Halloween was based upon. This was our favorite excerpt.

Dr. Loomis brushed aside his trench coat as he knelt to the floor. This only took a moment but it was long enough for the last 15 years of his life to flash before his eyes. He saw those first five years he spent with Michael, trying to reach him, then the next ten years doing everything he could to keep Michael within the walls of Smith's Grove. ""At least I know what I'm up against,"" Loomis thought as he glanced at Sheriff Bracket, who was looking at Loomis with puzzlement not knowing what Loomis knew. Hell had come to this small town. As Loomis thrust two fingers into the damp carpet he almost chuckled to himself thinking what his failure to keep Michael contained has brought him to. He brought his fingers to his tongue and appraised. Loomis turned to Bracket ""He's urinated here once tonight,"" he said. ""I think he'll be back.""

Ok onto Halloween: Resurrection. This was the eighth installment of the greatest horror franchise of all-time. It was released in 2002, in retrospect a really strange time in B. It seemed like any rapper with a hit or two was a prime candidate to land in a B. Its not a coincidence that B hall of famer Steven Seagal pretty much carried the movement. In steps Busta Rhymes who is an Internet reality show producer that decides to film some college students spending a night in casa Myers. The students included the kid from Rookie of the Year and Sean Patrick whatever from Save the Last Dance. Sid honestly couldn't wait to see Myers make fruit salad out of these two. Myers really brought his A game this time around. In the first scene Laurie Strode is in a mental institution after their last ridiculous encounter and Myers finds her. She ends up getting Myers hanging from the roof by his feet with some wire. Solid job by her but then instead of killing him she kisses yeah kisses him and goes to take off his mask. It was no surprise when Myers stabbed her but he must have felt really good about himself. He'd been after her for over 20 years! The rest of the movie was cookie cutter slasher flick. We shift the house where Myers goes through these college kids like a hot knife through butter except for one girl. In the final scene Busta fights Myers with some wang Chung he learned on YouTube and eventually electrocutes Myers. They don't show Myers in the hospital for no reason. The poor person in the morgue goes to take off Myers's mask and he jumps out of his body bag like...you know. And that was that.

Overall this was a decent Halloween. It had all of the goofiness of the later sequels with no hilarious hick tumbles so we had to take away 1 star for that. The best things about this one were Myers cracking a skull with his bare hands Principal Vernon style and the Myers hair. It took on a life of its own this time around. At one point it looked like there was something a few feet to Myers left but no just his hair sticking out that far. Fantastic stuff. So when Halloween Ressurection is on this month catch it one of the 20 times it'll be on, but don't feel bad of you only watch the first 45 minutes or so.",1381276800,2,3272,4.369458128078818

The problem is that instead of being suspenseful and scary, it's really generic with a pace that moves WAY too inappropriate and flat out wrong for the Halloween series.  Every scene goes by so fast that even bothering to keep up with the events isn't an option.  How can a movie be scary when everything's quickly rushing by?  No character development, no suspense, nothing.

The only segment that was passable is the one where the young woman is busy watching security cameras but turns away to make a cup of coffee/blast loud music as someone is conveniently being killed/dragged away.  This means she misses this entire event since her back is turned.  The scene where the woman is attempting to take the mask off the killer while he's suspended in the air resulting in the obvious part where he comes back to life, grabs the woman by the arm and throws her off the building top is dreadful since it happens in a slow-moving/overdramatic kind of way.  This is the only part that isn't rushed and yet, it fails in being unnecessarily overdramatic.  Yikes.

Halloween: Resurrection is absolutely terrible.  No reason for its existence either.  You have to actually have horror elements sometimes.  I know, it's a big stretch.",1372723200,,1367,4.8111587982832615

1785904,1,B00006LPHA,"This was an amazingly bad movie that should have never been made.  They had the perfect ending to the Halloween franchise (not counting the Rob Zombie reboots) and they threw it away to make this steaming pile.  I am guessing Halloween H20 did well enough that someone saw dollar signs and decided to make another one.  When Jamie Lee Curtis finally got to chop his head off in H20, that should have been it.  But they come up with the implausible story about how he switched with a paramedic, which would make sense except anyone who has seen Halloween H20 knows that what she did to him from the van ride to the time she cut off his head would have killed everyone except Michael Myers instantly.

The only good thing that this movie did was finally convince them to stop making the movies (although they left the possibility open at the end of this one for more).  No, I do not count the Remakes as a part of this line.  They wasted Jamie Lee Curtis in this movie, then had Michael killing random people because they were in his house.  When throughout the entire series the whole point for his killing is to kill is family members and anyone who gets in his way.  Not that there has to be a lot of logic in a horror movie, but it is just a shame after they executed Halloween H20 so well that this was the follow up.  About the only appeal this will have is to Battlestar fans who get to see a young Katee Sackhoff.

Aside from what it did to the franchise overall (kind of like what Batman and Robin did to the Batman movie franchise until Nolan came along) it is a run of the mill horror movie.  The acting is about what you would expect, there was the gratuitous partial nudity and really dumb decisions by the characters getting killed off.  If you skip this one you will not miss much.",1362700800,4,1794,4.303571428571429
1785905,3,B00006LPHA,"I am one of the biggest fans of the Halloween series.  I have enjoyed the films since I was 3 years old, when my Dad took me to see Halloween II (1981) in theaters.

This film isn't as bad as most fans say.  I actually enjoyed this film in the theater, & when I went on opening night, the theater was packed, people were screaming at the scares, jumping, laughing, having a good time.

The film does have it's low points, especially having Busta Rhymes playing the lead.  His karate, and bad one lines are probably the reason why this film gets such the bad reputation that it has.

Rick Rosenthal, director of ""Halloween II"" (1981) returns to direct this installment, and does a wonderful job.  I love some of the tie-in's in this movie to ""Halloween II"".  The security cameras in the hospital showing The Shape waling it's halls immediately reminds you of ""Halloween II"".  Rick Rosenthal even has a cameo on the film as college professor ""Dr. Mixter"".

Fans have stated how much they hate the first 15 minutes of the film, and have deemed this film ""unwatchable"".  I actually felt a little emotional after the ""Laurie Strode"" character was killed off.  I don't know.  I feel like a true fan, and enjoyed the creativity in the film with the reality show and the webcams.  I thought it was suspenseful that viewers at home could watch what was going on in the house, and that the ""Decker"" character was assisting in helping ""Sarah"" escape.  I have to admit there are some ironic scenes & dialogue in the film, though.  One being a character saying, ""She really is a very talented actress...""

I give this film 3 stars.  The film does have it's problems, and it's a FAR cry away from the original Halloween & Halloween II, but I have seen MANY MANY MANY horror films that seem like they are a far cry away from ""Halloween Resurrection"".  Not as bad as they say.

We had Jamie Lee Curtis back in the saddle again and a cast of talented young actors that went onto great things.  How the filmmakers decided to do damage to the series with this one I'll never understand.  At this point, I don't think it's a surprise to anyone that (SPOILER) Jamie Lee Curtis is killed in the first twenty minutes of this movie.  Of course who knows if she'll come back again, I mean Michael Myers has been killed in so many ways and keeps getting revived without any realistic explanation.  Although rumor has it Jamie Lee Curtis wanted out of the series, but was contracted for one more film and she agreed to this as long as they killed her character off.  I can't imagine that this was the only way out.  After she's offed, the movie predictably heads down hill.  It turns into just another horror slasher flick with a bunch of teens all spending the night in the childhood home of Michael Myers for a reality web tv show.  What they all don't know is Michael just happens to be staying there too.  You get the drift.  This had the opportunity to be a better movie and I think you and I together could've put something great, but instead we got this.  See it once to get it out of your system then shove it back on the shelf to collect dust.

1785922,4,B00006LPHA,"I remember seeing this movie when it first came out oh so many moons ago.  My friend was (and is) a Halloween fanatic and wanted to see this flick.  I figured I was game and said I would go see it with him.  Now when I watched the movie back 2002, god has it been 10 years already, I did not think too highly of this film.  Actually, I thought it was a piece of crap.

A decade has gone by and I have been adding movies to my slasher collection.  I knew it was only a question of time before I got a hold of the Halloween movies.  However, I felt very dubious about picking this entry in the series, mainly because I remember it being as cool as a tepid bowl of diarrhea. Nevertheless, I was able to get my copy in a multi-pack that was reasonable priced.  This past weekend I watched this movie again with slightly different eyes.  I am not sure what changed my perception, perhaps my age has mellowed me out or I have seen so many sub-par slasher movies in the past 10 years this movie didn't seem that bad.

I want to set the record straight, this movie is very inferior to pretty much every other Halloween movie in the franchise (not counting the dismal Rob Zombie versions).  What bugged me so much about watching this movie the first time around was the first fifteen minutes.  I truly feel that it was a slap in the face to hard core fans of Halloween.  I will not give details away but I will just say it involves the main protagonist, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis in an extended cameo which would have been better fitted as a denouement). In addition, once the first fifteen minutes pass I was left wondering, what else is there to do?

Well this motion picture takes a group of college students and has them spend the night in Michael Myer's house.  If that isn't interesting or trite enough, the group is being filmed for an internet reality show called ""Dangertainment"" The host of this show is Freddie play by Busta Rhymes.  Okay now stop the presses and hold the phone.  This idea right here is so ridiculous and obtuse that it insults the integrity of the ""Halloween"" series.  That bugged me 10 years ago and it still sort of bugs me today. Yet during my second viewing, I watched this movie as not a ""Halloween"" movie, but rather just another campy horror movie....my perception began to change.

""Halloween: Resurrection"" has a very high entertainment significance and if taken at face value it can be a fun ride.  These are just a few of the magnificent things one will discover in this schlock sequel:

- Sarah's (the final girl) dubious cyber relationship with Myles/Deckard.  They never meet and his character is so moot and pointless.  It is safe to say Jar Jar Binks is more useful.  Maybe the actor was related to the producer.

- Watching the antics of a younger Katee Sackhoff as the cheap girl/fame whore.

- Thomas Ian Nicholas (American Pie) as a horny guy who meets an unintentionally  funny demise.

- Sean Patrick Thomas as a guy who is obsessed with healthy food.

- The forced chemistry between the ""smart"" girl and the ""artistic"" guy.

- Michael Myers just killing for no reason.

- Michael Myers cooks a rat.

- Busta Rhymes obsession with kung-fu.

- Hearing Busta Rhymes say ""Trick or Treat Mother F******"".

Speaking of Busta Rhymes, I have to say that he delivered a solid campy performance.  I am not sure that was his intention or not, but this was the end result.  Another interesting thing is now that ""reality television"" has been around for longer period of time (rather novel when this movie was released) the irony of it really shines through in this film.

In conclusion, this movie is utter crap and nonsense as an entry in the ""Halloween"" series.  It doesn't even belong in the same zip code as the original.  Notwithstanding, as a cheesy haunted house, horror, slasher movie that is liberal with blood, foul language and some nudity it is rather entertaining.",1338940800,2,3915,4.499290780141844

1785924,1,B00006LPHA,"I love the Halloween franchise. For the most part. I've been a massive fan of psycho slasher Michael Myers since I was little. He was the boogeyman that I dreamed about, the one I always thought was under my bed or in my closet or in my basement. And for good reason. Myers is an unstoppable force of terror, slashing, killing, and rampaging his way wordlessly through his victims without one hint of emotion or remorse. This is why Halloween: Resurrection, sucks.

For the most part, the scares were decent. But after killing off Laurie Strode, his sister, then Michael is reduced to doing nothing but slashing his way through a terribly acted, written, and even directed film. The plot works, but is uninteresting, and we (once again) attempt to explore Michael's origins, which are falsified for the story. The ending is extremely predictable and anticlimactic, and you don't remotely care about the cast in any way, shape, or form. By the end, you'll be rooting for Michael to kill them all.

The main reason you should stay away from this blu ray release, however, is because of the lack of features. I bought Halloween H20: 20 Years Later on blu ray and was partially satisfied with it. The blu ray transfer was done perfectly, and it really added to the movie. No doubt, this transfer will be more of the same. But the part where H20's release failed was that there were absolutely no features on it what so ever. Not even a trailer. It was just the movie, and a nice menu. So, if you're looking for a special features release of Resurrection, and a decent movie, you'll be wasting your money on both counts.",1334102400,3,1615,4.623693379790941

This movie must have tried to appeal to blacks or African Americans, but being white the black characters did little for me. For one, I detest that airhead Tyra Banks. Second, Busta Rhymes, who I guess is a rapper was in the movie. He was ok. I'm not sure who the other black guy was.

Anyway, we see a college party with many drunk guys and gals watching the Micheal Myer's House pay per view. The event was of course on Halloween. It was like Survivor or Big Brother but in the old Myer's house. The house now suddenly is very cavernous with a ginormous basement or holding area for Micheal. The house is basically abandoned and falling down in a relatively kept up neighborhood. Such dilapidation of course would never be allowed by any city, but whatever. So Mikey shows up just randomly killing people because I they are in his house and killing is what he does best.

The movie has regular shots and goes back in forth from those shots to camera shots from camera's affixed in the house or on the kids who try to spend the night in the house.

1785927,1,B00006LPHA,"This is one of those good/awful news that turns dreaded in the matter of minute's type of movie... it sets out to do so much yet fails at every attempt!

Plot: When Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) thought she decapitated the man of her nightmares she soon realizes that Michael had tricked her and put another innocent man behind the mask. In the grand scheme of things Michael finds the mental hospital she has been assigned to and (Minor Spoiler Alert!!!!!) Kills Laurie... Now that he has fulfilled his dark deeds he descends back to his origin.... the good ol' Myers house... But soon after a group of reality show contestants enter to win big and the only thing they have to do is live (or should I say) survive the night in the Myers house but evil has come home and soon they are being slaughtered by the boogeyman himself... the devil within the flesh.. The one, the only, Michael Myers!

Review: With it's $15 million budget, Rick Rosenthal (Director of this and Halloween II the 1981 version), Larry Brand (Story/Writer for this movie), and Sean Hood (Writer for this movie) come up with a movie that bites the big one and creates an unneeded and unwanted sequel to the 1978 hit! This was a success at the box office (surprisingly) and there were some good gore scenes along with decent acting but the whole thing reeked of that ""Been done to death"" feeling! This was just another teenage slasher flick in my opinion... this is no doubt the one of the worst dimension slasher film release of the mid 90's to the early 00's! The deaths were cheesy, the story/plot was quarter great and three quarters dreaded, and the soundtrack wasn't that original. Everything about this movie was pretty much just a big fail in my opinion!

Acting: It felt like I was watching an Uwe Boll film in some aspects of the acting.... They should not have ever casted Busta Rhymes or any other rapper/singer in this movie or any other Halloween movie of the franchise!

Gore: It is physically impossible to decapitate a human with one swipe of a kitchen knife; I don't care how small your neck is! We get impalements, a wicked bad decapitation scene, some stabbings, a slit throat, a crushed head, a severed head, and some more! Not even the gore could save this movie!

Bottom Line: This film grossed $37 million and has a cult of haters behind it... it wasn't all it could've been and I don't think it should've ever been attempted.... it was just another attempt to make some money in the world of Hollywood!

1785962,4,B00006LPHA,"I can understand why this movie is hated by all fans of the series. I thought it was a joke at first as well. Four years had passed since the release on Halloween: H20 (1998) which I tought was intended to bring an end to the series. I thought that H20 was the best in the series since Halloween 2 (1981) and really brought the franchise back to the basics, even though I enjoyed the other sequels. H20 brought back a lot of the style from the first film and it was well executed. It's one of my personal favorite horror sequels. I thought that the ending did a very inspired job at bringing a close to the series so when I herd that this movie was being made, I was a bit worried.

Released in 2002, this film I belive was originally intended to be a sequel without Michael Myers along the lines of Halloween 3: Season Of The Witch (1982) but because of the success of H20, I guess making a film without Michael wasn't an option. Plus, H3 recieved a lot of hate from fans and still does to this day. What came to be was Halloween: Resurrection. The film opens with Laurie Strode now in a mental institution, I'm not sure why, it really makes no sense when I think about it. She is still haunted by Michael and it is revealed that she killed the wrong man in H20 which completly ruins everything that was so great about the H20 ending. This was the first thing that put me off on first viewing. I won't give away the details of what happens next for those who haven't seen the film but despite it's flaws, I thought that the opening of the film was very well done and even works as a prolouge to the film and even though I still feel the series should have ended with H20, the opening still works.

The rest of the film focuses on a group of college students who agree to spend the night in the Myers house hosted by a web cam crew. I don't need to point out what happens next since it's pretty obvious. While I didn't think this was a great movie and I didn't care for some of the descions that the filmmakers made, it still is a fun entry in the series and I enjoy watching it. Sometimes I belive that what makes a good movie is if the story works well, even though it does suffer from flaws. If you're into the moody atmosphere that the Halloween series contains then you will like this movie. I thought that the cinematography was very well done and Rick Rosenthal (director of Halloween 2) brings an inspired approuch to the directing. I think that the biggest problem I have with the movie is some parts of the script but the direction sort of lets you look past all of that and enjoy the movie for just what it is, a sequel.",1308873600,,2631,4.1976284584980235

Meanwhile, across town, Myles 'Deckard' Barton is watching Sara do her interview, because he is interested in her and has been helping her with internet stuff. on HALLOWEEN, they all go to the Myers house, and broadcast live on the Internet for millions of people to watch. No one can leave until the show is over, so they are all locked in. Little do they know, Michael is back and doesn't like uninvited guests. At a college HALLOWEEN party, Myles 'Deckard' is watching the show, and when Michael shows up, Myles believes that the people are actually being killed, but no one else at the party does until Sara is the last one alive and calls Myles for help to tell her where Michael is at.

The Franchise had it's high points, Halloween I & II and it's not so high points, III & VI, H20 was probably the best entry since II and IV and V did their best to revive the Myers franchise after III totally bombed.

1785968,3,B00006LPHA,"This movie starts out with Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) being bumped off by Michael Myers, the very man Laurie killed in Halloween H2O by chopping his head off.  Huh?

Why kill off Laurie Strode?  Because this happened, Michael Myers wins.  He finally got his prize kill - his sister Laurie, thanks to John Carpenter's strange, sharp-left-turn screenplay for Halloween II.  Laurie Strode should never have been Michael's sister, but that's another story.  So, after Laurie is killed off in Halloween Resurrection, it becomes an entirely different movie from that point on.  The audience is supposed to say, ""OK, Michael just won by killing off his sister who is the lead character from the first two Halloween movies and later H2O, so now we're ready to watch him stalk and kill a bunch of young punks who are exploring his childhood home, with Busta Rhymes as the new lead character.""

After getting over this sudden change of trajectory, that is, if you can swallow it, the movie becomes a teenage/twenty-something stalk fest.  However, I must say that the idea and concept of this movie (excluding the Laurie Strode killing) is unique and holds my attention.  A bunch of young people exploring the childhood home of Michael Myers with webcams and having Michael himself stalking around the house and thousands of people watching on the Internet is a unique idea.  The movie has enough tension to really keep me on the edge of my seat.  I felt this way when I saw this movie in the theater in the summer of 2002.  I liked it for the most part.  However, the casting of Busta Rhymes is questionable to a lot of people.  To me, he definitely is entertaining, but karate chopping Michael is a little cheesy.  This movie was trying to reach a target audience - the young people who are Internet and computer savvy.

I give this movie 3 stars.  When I take it at face value, it's a solid, entertaining movie.  I deducted 1 star due to Michael killing off Laurie Strode.  This movie is a prime example of a Halloween movie that has Michael Myers being just a stalker killer with no playful side like he had in Halloween and Halloween II.

Do I recommend this movie?  Yes and no.  If you can just take it at face value, you might enjoy it.  If you're a Halloween franchise purist, then this movie might be a violation of what you expect and want in a Halloween movie.",1281916800,,2366,4.605263157894737

1785970,1,B00006LPHA,"Whether they intended to make another Halloween film after Halloween H20 or not is irrelevant at this point. H20 gave the series a satisfying ending that few other endless slasher series ever attempt - its unkillable killer is truly killed once and for all. But they went and ruined that rare, cherished finality anyway and made Halloween: Resurrection.

We now find Laurie Strode locked away in a psychiatric hospital. Why? Because before she could lop off the head of her evil brother, Michael Myers, the ever-clever ""Boogeyman"" managed to pull a switcheroo. Choking out a paramedic and swapping clothes, Michael disappeared into the California night, leaving the poor paramedic to meet the business end of Laurie's home run swing with the fireman's axe. Guilt-ridden that she had killed an innocent man, Laurie goes crazy and is committed. But this turns out to be a ruse, as Laurie has set a trap that was apparently approved by Wile E. Coyote, intently lying in wait for Michael to come for her once again. And indeed he does, and after a brief chase, Laurie is finally slain.

The story shifts back to Haddonfield, Illinois, Michael's hometown. The old Myers house, still abandoned, has become the setting of a reality show produced by internet mogul Busta Rhymes (more on him later). Busta Bust picks a handful of attention whore college kids to explore the condemned Myers house on Halloween night, giving them each a wireless camera to film their activities as the footage is streamed live over the World Wide Web. At one point, the kids even reference The Osbournes in the dialogue. You can literally feel the desperation to make this film relatable to modern teen audiences.

Well Michael Myers comes home again, and isn't too happy to find these intruders in his crib. The young Flip Mode Squad recruits start dying one by one as internet audiences watch, uncertain if what they're watching is real or a hoax. But I guess that even a shark in the white mask and baggy-ass overalls is no match for Busta's mad kung-fu skillz. He's straight gangsta, yo.

While the Rear Window-esque voyeur element is rather inspired, nothing else in the film really is. The original Scream Queen is uncerimoniously eliminated in the first ten minutes of the film, leaving the audience with no one but a group of dumb, horny, weed-smoking, stereotypical college kids and a kung-fu kicking Busta Rhymes to deal with. If Halloween didn't jump the shark before (And how couldn't it have after EIGHT installments?), then it certainly did once Busta kicks Michael through a window. It's up there with Indiana Jones surviving a nulcear blast by hiding in a fridge with god-awful, laughably absurd moments in film. And we gave up the emotional closure of Laurie triumphing over Michael at the end of Halloween H20 for this?

Even diehard Halloween fans like myself try to pretend that Halloween: Resurrection never happened. If they wanted to make the franchise ""hip"" and relatable to today's younger audiences, I honestly wish they had given the franchise to Rob Zombie sooner if it meant avoided this embarrassing film's creation. At least the classic Halloween storyline would have ended with dignity.",1281484800,,3190,4.955140186915888
1785971,3,B00006LPHA,"Well, H20 proved successful and had a great following in my opinion. It had a great ending, and SHOULDVE been the ending to the series.

Rick Rosenthal, who directed Halloween II, is back so I expected it to be good, but what I got, was this, let me just explain throughout the whole movie, what happens.

Well, we open up at a mental institution where Laurie Strode is residing. If you ask me, this scene shouldn't have existed. Michael is still alive, because apparently at the end of H20, Laurie decapitated a medic who was stuck with the mask on, and vocal chords crushed, I died alittle on the inside when I first heard / saw that. So Michael finds Laurie, and kills her.

WHAT?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?

Thats the whole thing that ruined it for me, Laurie dying, that was not the right move at all, Rick Rosenthal, you messed up bigtime with that!

Well, after getting that out of the way, we cut to the main plot of the film, which is pretty much a group of kids with cameras camping in Michaels house on Halloween night for an internet webam show. That was an OK concept and I might have liked the film abit more if the opening scene with Laurie never existed. The host of this internet show is Busta Rhymes, nuff said. Then his co-host is Tyra Banks! Of course, all of the teens get killed exept for the one shy girl (how different is that?!) Then we come to the grand finale, the showdown with Michael in a burning building, ***SPOILERS FOLLOW*** once you think the girl is done for, Busta Rhymes breaks in with his badass attitude and beats the hell out of Michael Myers.

I mean this was another ok end to the series, an I'd admit, if the Laurie Strode beginning was not in the film, I would've respected it better, so in that case, I give it a 3/5. Acting was ok, and an ok plot, but nothing too special, check it out if the price is fair, don't expect it to be top notch.

Halloween: The Homecoming. This is the workprint of Halloween: Resurrection i got at a convention. It just features some alternate scenes and an alternate ending (but the ending could be viewed on the special features on the normal disc!!!)

If you ask me (in my honest opnion, the series should've been like this:

1. Halloween
2. Halloween II
3. Halloween III: Season of the Witch
4. Halloween H20

I wulnd't mind keeping Halloween III in there due to it being good in my opinion, but the whole Jamie thing didn't do it for me and the dumb cult stuff in part 6 definitly didn't dtick with me, so those are my thoughts on the Halloween series.

1786005,1,B00006LPHA,"Apparently it's impossible to keep a masked homicidal maniac down. Despite being shot numerous times at point blank range (""Halloween""), engulfed in a raging inferno (""Halloween 2""), and stabbed multiple times before eventually losing his head (""Halloween H20""); it seems that nothing can stop Michael Myers from partaking in his favorite trick-or-treating past time... murder. Five years after ""Halloween H20: 20 Years Later"" appeared to bring the franchise to a satisfying close, Michael has returned for more All Hallows' Eve mayhem in ""Halloween: Resurrection"".

""Halloween: Resurrection"" finds Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) locked away in a psychiatric hospital after the events of the previous film. All appearances to the contrary, Laurie is not as disturbed as she lets on, but is merely biding her time as she awaits her brother's inevitable return. Meanwhile, back in Haddonfield a reality TV show is taking place with six teenagers being asked to spend one night in the childhood home of Michael Myers. What was intended to be a major ratings bonanza for the show courtesy of some cheaply staged scares and urban legends run amok, turns into a night of terror when Michael finally comes back home.

Let's take a moment to break down the quality of the ""Halloween"" franchise, albeit only recognizing those movies included in the generally accepted continuity. The first film was innovative in its methods and overall execution, not to mention it created an entire sub-genre of film; although it did contain some weak points courtesy of hit-and-miss character development and dialogue. Number two amplifies the problems from the first film, while at the same time replacing genuine scares with too much gore. Skip ahead 17 years after ""Halloween 2"" and ""H20"" does its level best to correct the past mistakes of the series in an attempt to recapture the essence of the original; plus, it supposedly gives fans a satisfactory ending to the series' 20-year long storyline.

In summation, we find that the first and third movies in the established continuity are good, but the second by comparison could be considered bad. So, if one believes that history can, and will, repeat itself, then one could easily presume that the next film in the series will also be bad. Now, I'm sure you're all wondering, ""Does history repeat itself within this franchise?"" The answer is... Yes, I believe it does.

Trust me when I say that going into this movie I did try my best to keep an open mind about the prospect of another installment despite the fact that the series felt resolved. Mostly I was curious to see how the ""creative"" minds behind this series were going to prove Michael Myers un-killable, at least permanently, this time around (hence the subtitle of the film).

Surprisingly the story for this installment, written by Larry Brand (""The Right Temptation"") and Sean Hood (""The Crow: Wicked Prayer""), did seem to show some promising signs that perhaps the audience would be in store for a good movie. The concept of once again creating that voyeuristic feel to the proceedings via webcams, rather than the first-person viewpoint of Michael, was for all intents and purposes intriguing. Even though the reasoning for Michael still being alive after the last film was a little too convenient for my tastes; the result of this retcon (retroactive continuity) to ""H20"" had potential for yet another exciting showdown between brother and sister. Alas, as is so often the case with horror franchises that have dragged on for far too long, the chances of having yet another ""good"" installment becomes more and more fleeting.

While some plot points could have been interesting if handled properly, the end result was nothing more than a boring exercise in by-the-book horror filmmaking. The online reality show set in Michael's house was made completely annoying due to the fact that almost every single character was written to be as irritating as humanly possible. Although there was one tolerable character named Sara (Bianca Kajlich), her role was ruined by some inexplicable character quirks that should not have been left unexplained. At almost every turn, the writers squandered countless opportunities for character development within the story. Instead, they opted to introduce more and more character ticks and/or flaws to make them seem more fascinating, but without the use of helpful exposition the writers were never able to fully sell these eccentricities to the audience.

Then there's the issue, or should I say issues, surrounding the retcon of the closing moments from ""H20"". As I stated earlier, this modification to the story did present a potentially engaging twist; however, when all's said and done, the change just felt like a sad excuse to keep the franchise going. The retcon also enabled a return appearance by Jamie Lee as Laurie, although this proved to be little more than a disappointing cameo that had no real significant impact on the overall story for the film. Truth be told, the series would have been better off had it ended after the conclusion of the previous movie. At least then the fans would have been satisfied with the series' finale; instead of being left with this poorly executed attempt at a follow-up.

Continuing the trend of weakness that permeates almost every inch of this film is the cast of actors and actresses assembled to annoy audiences to seemingly no end. Honestly, there are no real standouts in the movie to speak of, I mean, there are a couple of decent performances (one of them I mentioned earlier), but nothing to get excited over. To be fair I will elaborate a little further on Bianca Kajlich's performance, along with touching on the shameless appearance by Jamie Lee Curtis, and lastly, chastise the casting of rappers and/or models that cannot act to save their lives.

In what comes as close to the starring role as one could get in this horror movie ensemble is actress Bianca Kajlich (TV's ""Rules of Engagement""). Throughout her performance there were moments where Bianca shined, displaying a sincerity and innocence that hadn't been seen in the series since the first film. However, some oddities about her character that never get explained and a generally uninteresting story arc overshadow anything positive that she could have accomplished in the role.

As for Jamie Lee's part in the film, can anyone say ""stunt casting""? Her portion of the movie was the biggest waste of time out of the entire duration. Granted the reason for her story's occurrence is vital to the continuation of the series; even with that, one cannot deny that the end result feels like an insult to everything the previous film achieved. At least I can say that Jamie Lee was given more to do in this glorified cameo than the entirety of her role in the dismal ""Halloween 2"". Jamie Lee should have been wise enough to just say ""No"" to this movie, and maybe the series would have ended on a high note rather than in despondency. For those not aware, ""Halloween: Resurrection"" is for all intents and purposes the final installment in the original franchise; a reboot of the series began in 2007 under the direction of Rob Zombie (""The Devil's Rejects"").

Last, and definitely least of all, are the talent-less performers (in terms of acting), Busta Rhymes (""Shaft"") and Tyra Banks (""Coyote Ugly""). For the most part, I am not a fan of rappers turned actors, I don't think they have the chops to play with the big boys, so to speak. I will admit that there are some exceptions that could be found. So, perhaps I should say most gangsta rappers shouldn't be considered for movie roles, even for something as inane as a horror film. The problem with Busta Rhymes was that he was so over-the-top in his delivery, that it was obvious he was just playing a slightly caricaturized version of himself. Of course, there's also his character's obsession with all things martial arts and his apparent skill with that obsession that seemed a little unusual and frankly, unbelievable. Some screenwriters need to learn that adding character quirks does not equal instant character development or generate further interest from the audience.

Models on the other hand are not necessarily as limited in range as the previous grouping, but that's not to say that all of them need to find their way onto a movie set either. Tyra Banks' performance in the film, much like Busta Rhymes, seemed to be an exaggerated impersonation of her celebrity persona. Her portrayal was much livelier than Busta's, and her dialogue didn't appear to be nearly as limited to slang. Still, I never really believed her in the role, she just didn't seem tenacious enough to be in the position of power she found herself in. I hope that this movie will mark the final time she is ever considered for a part in a movie, even if the role is that of a model.

""Halloween: Resurrection"" not only lessened the impact of the previous film on the series, but also wasted any and all opportunities to capitalize on the retconning that occurred early on in this film. Jam-packed with annoying characters, hackneyed set-ups and dialogue, and let's not forget an overbearing sense of predictability; this sequel is just another shameless attempt to cash in on a franchise that has apparently lost every shred of quality and entertainment value.

As an interesting side note, the director of this film, Rick Rosenthal, just so happened to be the director of the ill-conceived ""Halloween 2"". What are the odds that the same director would be responsible for the weakest installments in the official continuity of the series? Apparently, the odds are quite good, much to the audiences' dismay.

He is still on the loose and she confronts him for one last time, but now back in Haddonfield where he lives there is this Web producer named Freddie Harris (Busta Rhymes) with girlfriend (Tyra Banks) are coming up with an ideal WebTV reality program for halloween. They make a program called Dangertainment where they hire college students (Sean Patrick Thomas, Thomas Ian Nichols, Luke Kirby, Bill Kay, Ryan Merimann, Katee Sackhoff, Bianca Kajlich, Daisy McKracken) particapte in this project as they wire cameras and film in the Myers home. However Michael has returned home as he kills anyone to set foot on his property as he terrorizes them.

The worst movie of the franchise! some say it's part 3 but ""Halloween 3: Season of the Witch"" was an experiment to turn the franchise into a big screen horror anthology. And some say it's ""Halloween: Curse of Michael Myers"" which maybe bad but not as bad as bad as this one, this one is an embarassment to the franchise. The series could have ended well with the excellent ""H2O"" but this went too far for the series even though there was an interesting idea of an internet show in the Meyers house but it got wasted here in this mess. There are some defining bad moments like Busta Rhymes kicking the butt of Michael spewing one-liners like ""Trick or Treat Muthabeeper"" which is one of the stupidest moments in horror film history. The acting is also twice as bad and so is the direction despite being directed by Rick Rosthenhal who did the excellent ""Halloween 2"", this one really crippled the franchise for good.

This DVD has good extras like commentary, deleted and alternate scenes with commentary, Photo Gallery, Tour of set, Featurette, interviews and storyboard comparision.",1231804800,,1946,4.858433734939759
1786010,5,B00006LPHA,"HAPPY THIRTIETH ANNIVERSARY, MICHAEL MYERS!!!

  ""Halloween:  Resurrection"" is the best sequel since ""Halloween II.""  It is everything a slasher flick should be:  attractive young coeds in peril; an abandoned house; unique death sequences (Jen's beheading was excellent - loved it when the head bounced down the stairs); an eerie soundtrack; dark humor; tension galore; and a beautiful female lead who, towards the end, runs screaming through corridors and up and down stairs while discovering dead bodies.  It is very reminiscent of the slasher films that I loved to watch in the eighties.

  Jamie Lee Curtis, scream queen of the eighties, briefly reprises her role as Laurie Strode.  We learn that she has been locked away in a psychiatric hospital for three years.  She is emotionally traumatized from beheading a paramedic who was wearing Michael's mask.  Unfortunately, Michael breaks into the hospital on Halloween eve.  Pursuing Laurie to the roof, he stabs her, causing her to fall to her death.  I am greatly saddened by her lost, feeling as though a dear friend of mine is gone forever.  I can only hope that she somehow survived but I seriously doubt it.

  The viewer is transported to Haddonfield, Illinois, home of Michael Myers.  Michael always returns home after he kills.  He discovers cameras and cables in his home.  A television reality show called DangerTainment is filming a group of college students exploring the Myers home on Halloween.  They have been instructed to look for clues as to why Michael went insane.  While they search, Michael kills them one by one in gruesome fashion while millions of viewers are watching.  At first, the viewers believe the killings are fake; later they realize that Michael Myers has returned.

  Sara, the heroine, has an internet boyfriend, Dexter.  He and his friends are at a Halloween party.  They gather around the computer and watch the slaughter.  Upon realizing that it is real, Dexter begins text messaging Sara, giving her help on escaping from Michael.  Some of these scenes are very tense - the best in the film.

  Bianca Kajlich (""Rules of Engagement"") is excellent as Sara Moyer who reminded me of Laurie Strode.  She is very shy, intelligent, and down to earth.  Other stars who gave good performances are supermodel Tyra Banks, rap star Busta Rhymes, Sean Patrick Thomas (""Cruel Intentions"" and ""Dracula 2000""), Katee Sackhoff (""Bionic Woman"" and ""Battlestar Gallatica"") and Thomas Ian Nicholas (""American Pie"" series).

  I said in an earlier review that ""Halloween,"" ""Halloween II,"" ""Halloween:  H2O"" and ""Halloween:  Resurrection"" are best when watched together.  ""Halloween III"" is very enjoyable but can be watched alone because it is the only installment in the series without Michael Myers.  Parts four, five, and six lack continuity (and have tremendous amounts of plot holes) but have high body counts.  I pretend that they happen in parallel time.  At least Dr. Loomis is alive in them even though Laurie Strode isn't.

  ""Halloween:  Resurrection"" is a must have for those who enjoy good holiday slasher fare.  Unless more sequels are made (it is highly unlikely that there will be), ""Halloween:  Resurrection"" is a great capper to a wonderful horror series.  It is very reminiscent of all those classic slasher flicks of the seventies and eights that involved a beautiful young girl trapped in a house such as ""Hell Night,"" ""Sorority House,"" and ""Black Christmas.""",1225411200,,3455,5.120503597122302
1786021,1,B00006LPHA,"Let me start out by saying that Halloween III:Season of the Witch, is better then Resurrection. I guess where most of you know where I am going to go with this review. For some reason, this has been the only Halloween Movie that I have missed in the Franchise(except the remake), and since I have been watching them in order, I was kinda of looking forward to this. Mind you that H20 had huge plot holes and was slow moving, I was still wondering how they were going to make a sequel to it, since those that saw the end of H20 know what I mean. What we get in the beginning of Resurrection gives us some answears to H20's ending, but that is about the only good part of the movie. From there we get a comedy of horrors that has nothing that works for it. There isn't one scary part in the whole movie, no suspense, nothing, not even any shock value cause the films special effects look like they are about thrity years dated! What we do get is a MTV based video or reality show, that has Busta Rhymes peforming Kung-Fu on Micheal Myers. SPOILERS below if anyone really cares, please save 90min doing something better with you time such as counting toothpicks! Wonderful, Busta kicks Micheal out the window and injuries him, yet  Micheal gets up in two seconds after being shot, stabbed, clubbed, burned, decapitated, has a Swat team blow about 30000 holes in his body, BUT BUSTA kicks his tush...I mean the movie was going no-where before that, but that was the final nail in the coffin for me. Listen, all the Halloweens have things that I like about them, even though Halloween (1978) is the best, closley followed by IV. I even stated that I liked III, and that has nothing to do with the series except name, and thats exactly what this piece of garbage does, well it tries to, but it ends up a waste and a joke. WORST sequel I have ever seen, Even worse than Jason X, Nightmare, Freddys Dead, and Rocky V. AVOID",1225238400,,1915,4.379213483146067

1786023,2,B00006LPHA,In 1978 John Carpenter released one of the greatest horror movies in the form of Halloween. It's first sequel was okay but after that the series went downhill. It seems that every sequel would have a new backstory on Mr. Meyers and this is one is no execpation. I think the producers made a mistake by killing of Jamie Lee Curtis. Mrs. Curtis is what Halloween is about and only she can stop Meyers. I think the producers should have brought in Josh Hartnett 7 Danielle Harris together since techinally they are siblings if you tie all the loose ends together. Halloween: Resurrection isn't scary but it's funny which isn't a good thing. Busta Rhymes makes the movie as Freddie Harris with his one-liners and the chicks in the movie are very hot. The film will disapoint hard core fans of the movie and those in the mood for a scare. The film might be better in my book if Bianca Kajlich had shown her knockers but all in all the film is just a gulity pleasure. The death scenes are okay and the chicks are hot.,1221350400,,1011,4.411764705882353

1786025,3,B00006LPHA,"After the lack of Michael in Halloween III, Michael was dead and the attempt at a new franchise failed. But Halloween 4 Michael was back and the movie was a hit. Halloween 5 was the lowest grossing of the series and while Halloween 6 made more money it wasn't well received. With the Halloween series at a crossroad Halloween H20 brought back the series in a big way cashing in on the success of the Scream films. It seemed the series was over after the way H20 ended. I suppose the ending of H20 was due to if the movie fails at least we have an ending, and it was a definitive ending. But in Hollywood money rules and you know Michael some how would be brought back.

Many consider Halloween: Resurrection the worst of the series, while in many ways I agree I also disagree. Resurrection is a very flawed film and overall it's really not a good movie per se, but has some fairly decent moments. To be quite honest H20 is my least favorite of the series. It's nothing more than Scream with Michael Myers as special guest star. While Resurrection does follow that format a bit, I still liked this one more. I found H20 mostly dull with some decent scenes if not for Jamie Lee Curtis I think H20 would be a total waste.

The problem for the series was when H20 came out and ignored 4-6 a lot of possible ideas can now never come to be, and while I found H20 average at best there really wasn't a direction to go after that. And that is the biggest problem here the lack of direction and with the ending of H20 it's gonna be tough to bring Michael back.

The screenplay written by Larry Brand & Sean Hood is quite weak; the characters have no depth and are as thin as the paper they were written on. None really served any real purpose. They try to be smart and witty and by the time Resurrection came out the Scream era was all, but done for. So therefore what may have worked in the past feels like a holdover from another era. The script was weak, but it wasn't really terrible. This is pretty straight forward neither Hood nor Brand really try anything different and in some ways that's good. Despite the flaws of the script it was a simple idea and while it mostly fails it does have some decent moments. They were able however to work out Michael survived the previous movie. An idea was that it was an imposter in H20, which would rule the movie pointless, the idea of Michael switching clothes with a paramedic isn't as silly as it sounds.

The biggest complaint is that Jamie Lee was killed off. But really what direction could this movie have gone with her? It would be a rehash of past installments and the character went as far as she could go. There really wasn't much left to do. But at the same time I do think it was a mistake. How can you kill Laurie Strode? But I do understand why, there really wasn't much to do with her character.

Rick Rosenthal who directed Halloween II returns to the directors' chair and it's very much a mixed bag. The first 15-min of Resurrection was actually fairly solid. It was creepy and suspenseful and was very much on the right track. But it was also very flawed, which is more on the writing. Laurie's death lacked logic. She gets him and has him beat, but he starts to grab at his mask to trick Laurie, but does it matter? The guy just tried to kill you! And also if it wasn't Michael why didn't he speak? Rosenthal handles the scenes well, but they just lacked logic, but Resurrection was off to a good start.

But once we meet the new characters things just start to fall a part. Despite the weak script I think Rosenthal could have still made a scary movie. None of the sequels had a great script, this is one of the weaker ones, but Rosenthal still could have made up for that.

But even the scenes of Michael Myers lurking around fail to spark any real suspense. Despite the flaws of the sequels I do think Halloween 2-5 were fun movies. By no means do they compare to the original, but fun in the 80s sort of way. At least they were horror movies though. Michael was always there even if we don't see him we know he's there. Which brings in some suspense, but does it work? That's a matter of opinion, but at least they tried to build suspense.

Unlike H20, at least the feel of dread is attempted in Resurrection. We know Michael's in the house waiting and watching, but something was just lacking. In the case of most of the franchise they just weren't able to make the transition into the 90s and failed in the post 90s. Sure there might be that one sequel that sort of worked, but not like they used to. Rick Rosenthal does what he can, but it never works his problem was unlike Halloween II he didn't have John Carpenter to bail him out and save his movie it was all on him this time.

Sarah played by Bianca Kajlich was a fairly decent character, but really lacked any depth for the heroine. While Kajlich does bring a little more to the character she's failed by her writers and director and she just might be the weakest heroine of the series. I still liked Sarah and too bad more wasn't done with her. I have to say though Jenna played by Katee Sackhoff should have been the lead. Katee is an actress I'm becoming quite fond of; she's attractive and has such great charisma. She's always a blast to watch and her character was a lot of fun actually.

Busta Rhymes is one of the most despised characters of the series, but if you want my honest opinion as much as his character may have hurt the movie, you take him away you have one hell of a boring movie. Sure the character was a bit much, but he was entertaining. Busta does give a good performance, but he cannot be blamed for the idiotic things that he says.

The biggest problem with Resurrection is really the middle scenes, which can at times lag and Michael lurking around just doesn't seem to work as well as past movies. The attempts at the flashy editing don't really work. The final act is where things get better, but also gets very messy. Rosenthal was building some decent suspense, but than Busta comes in with his one-liners and kung-fu moves or as I call it Busta-fu. Right there the tension was killed and Rosenthal never ever got it back. It wasn't that suspenseful to begin with, but fairly decent.

Having Busta Rhymes do a karate stance and spin kick Michael Myers out of a window is not scary, it's just stupid. Having Busta Rhymes beat the hell out of Michael and always have a comment isn't funny, it isn't suspenseful it's stupid. Michael is the villain and not a punching bag. I like when characters put up a little fight and not just stand their and die, but you don't have your franchise player reduced to getting beat up like that. After so many movies with Michael Myers I think the fear begins to leave and Rick Rosenthal made sure of that. All the fear of Michael is gone. There isn't anything scary about him anymore.

If you are making a horror movie make one! Those scenes serve no point other than to get a laugh from the crowd, which kills all the tension that was just built up. What could have been an excellent final act that might have helped some what make up for the middle is just destroyed. The scenes weren't funny they were idiotic and after that all the tension is gone and there was no way of getting it back. I have no problem with comedy in horror, but if you are making a horror movie with some comedy you have to know when to end the comedy and focus on suspense and clearly Rick Rosenthal didn't understand that.

So is Halloween: Resurrection really that bad? Well yes and no. I do think this is one of the weaker parts and despite 4-6 being ignored I actually prefer those, but Resurrection does have some fairly decent moments and isn't the big waste of time most would make it out to be. As a slasher film it's some what enjoyable, but very forgettable. Dimension films is all about going with what's in. H20 was made in the style of Scream and with Reality TV quite popular at the time and the Internet age getting bigger, Dimension films went down that route.

What helps Resurrection is Brad Loree as Michael Myers; in my opinion he was one of the best actors to play Michael. He made the character some what creepy. Also I really enjoyed Katee Sackhoff in the movie and she elevates any scene she appears in. Also brining it back to Haddonfield is a plus and the score by Danny Lux was far better than anything in H20.

What amazes me is how many people are willing to accept this sequel over the remake. Even those who disliked this part were more in favor of a follow up. I just don't understand that. Do you all really wanna see Michael Myers being reduced to a punching bag again? Resurrection makes me appreciate the original even more as well as the remake. Overall Halloween: Resurrection is flawed movie; while it works decent as a slasher film it's mostly just forgettable. There was potential, but Rick Rosenthal was just clueless. Though I still favor Resurrection over H20, but while no doubt this isn't a good movie it does make for a decent time killer, but just barley.",1200960000,4,9065,4.361374407582939
1786026,4,B00006LPHA,"On terms of story line, this movie is not the strongest Halloween, but the first part of the film is what you get your moneys worth. They explain how he is still alive from H20, and it isn't corny. Nothing supernatural, don't worry. Then a shocking moment happens when Michael and Laurie confront each other again. It's edge of your seat stuff. What I also really liked is the crazy guy explaining Michael's killing career and he ignores Halloween 4,5, and 6. Those of you Halloween nerds, like myself, that hated 5 and 6 will love that. After the nut-ward scene of the movie, it is just a body count movie. Halloween has never really been a body count movie, until this one.

That is why so many people didn't like this Halloween, because it didn't have much of a story. It was just Michael walking around his house killing people. I love the Friday the 13th series, and those are the body count movies, so of course I liked this Halloween. Don't expect H20, if you loved that movie. This Halloween really stands alone.

If you're more open to just a really good horror film with cool photography, a nice score, some pretty cool death scenes, and that can make you jump a few times this is something I believe you would like.  Many Halloween fans do not like this movie, but there are quite a few that do.  I have really liked the film ever since the first time I saw it.  Its a fun movie to watch; by no means should you take the film too seriously.  Just watch it and go with the ride.  If you're the type of person who likes to nit pick every single aspect of a movie saying ""that would never happen"" then don't buy this.  Don't watch horror films for that matter!  Furthermore, I do believe this is a good sequel.  I actually like it a lot more than Halloween H20.  The best word to describe the film is fun. Thats the way I think of it.  It does certainly have its share of thrilling and frightening moments.  Its an underrated film in general and its nice to see that some do actually like this film.

The main storyline: six young people are chosen to spend a night in Michael Myers' old house with each person wearing a web cam to watch their every move. Guess what happens next. The camera movements of these web cams are extremely distracting, and in the process gave me a headache. The characters are uninteresting individuals, the writing is pathetic, and the directing by Rick Rosenthal, who helmed the very good ""Halloween II"", is not very good. There is, however, one uproarious scene where Michael Myers confronts one of the characters who's dressed up as himself. The guy dressed up as Michael Myers thinks that it's someone else, saying that only one person can play Michael Myers, not realizing that it's actually the real Michael Myers. This scene is absolutely hilarious. I wish the filmmakers of this movie would have added more scenes of comic relief like this one. If they had, then maybe this would have been better.

1786049,2,B00006LPHA,"This movie was a HUGE disappointment.  Its predecessor was a pleasant surprise, intelligently resolving (or so we thought) the whole ""Halloween"" series with a tremendously satisfying confrontation between Michael Myers and his long-suffering sister/prey, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis).  After that, I am baffled as to why Ms. Curtis (or should I say Mrs. Guest?) took part in this travesty, which undoes the above in ten misery-filled minutes.  After which Jamie Lee is not seen again...guess why...  Also, Josh Hartnett, as Laurie's son in ""H20"", isn't even mentioned as the series reverts to one-dimensional, character-free bloodletting.  The rest of the movie is typical process of elimination of clueless teenagers, with some not-bad new twists (reality TV and webcams) in the formula.  But all is hopelessly tainted by what came before.

In the long run, these series are unrewarding because the villains keep coming back, the heroes never really win, and the victims are never avenged.  Unless the next sequel reveals that Laurie Strode survived her injuries, I'm going to consider H20, with its infinitely more satisfying (and logical!) conclusion, to be the end of the series.

Two stars because it's not awful, especially if you're fine with the callous disposal of the human element of the series (Jamie/Laurie) in favor of the faceless Michael Myers machine (and its conducivene$$ to more facele$$ $equel$).",1186185600,,1421,5.336322869955157

And that is when we get over the limit and manage to believe the unbelievable. Carpenter is also extremely good at keeping the film in dark shadowy half lights that are necessary for him to play on the depth of the picture and to hide what is going to come out of the dark without any due process of announcing itself. You must not look for any deeper or wider meaning, because there is none, except that we accept to be the eye of the camera, or we accept the camera to be our eye, hence we accept to be voyeurs inside a film that is itself a voyeuristic adventure since we capture the action through cameras and TV screen relayed onto the internet and a portable telephone. We are confronted to at least two if not three levels of voyeurism with the organizers of the first level becoming the direct victims of the adventure, and then the guinea pigs of these becoming the victims of the voyeuristic and exhibitionistic game they had accepted to get into. And even further the audience of these two levels on the Internet becoming themselves victims of the game because they believe it is a game even when it turns more than sour. It is the use of a portable telephone via an instant messenger that will enable this voyeuristic audience to become compassionate. And we, the voyeurs of Carpenter's film, are like innocent angels victimized by Carpenter and his tricks and what's more we enjoy it and would like to see some more, so that we even know, accept, desire and enjoy the very last punch line that closes this film without closing Michael Myers' eyes: he is eternal because after all this is reality TV and not any virtual fable told by some perverse deranged greedy film director.

This time around, Michael Myers returns home to find that an ""internet reality show"" has set up shop in his old digs, and Busta Rhymes and Tyra Banks are heading up the whole clown-show. This royaly pisses Michael off, (and rightly so).

It's 'Fear-Factor' meets 'Halloween' meets what I puke in the toilet after a weekend of binge-drinking. Unlikeable characters are killed, Busta Rhymes tries to act, Tyra Banks stagnates... it has to be seen to be believed.

The main thing that this movie suffers from is Busta Rhymes horrendous acting job.

Michael finally reaches his goal by killing Laurie Strode.  He then goes home only to find a group of teens filming a reality series about the Myers house.  Michael gets very, very angry...again.

To be perfectly honest, this is the weakest entry plotwise, but it's simplistic nature works wonders for the movie as a whole.  The teens character's are very 2D but their performances create lasting impressions on the audience.  Rosenthal has worked his magic again for the Halloween series.

This Halloween movie has the most special features out of all.  It has an audio commentary with the director and editor a featurette about the web cam aspect of the story and much, much more.  Rick sounds very intelligent in the commentary, but the editor doesn't really know the series and makes some idiotic comments, but Rick's comments are much to be treasured especially when he reminices about Halloween II.

1786086,3,B00006LPHA,"first of all, i am a big fan of the halloween series since my high school days. halloween 1 and 2 are so scary even when watched today (1978, 1981) primarily due to john carpenter's excellent directing and original score! halloween 3 stands alone but given credit, it is also one scary ride. it was in halloween 4 and 5 that the plot thickened and took a new direction. if not only for donald pleasance, these sequels would have been a disaster. in halloween 6, we see the most excruciating death of a female character in the first 20 minutes, but again, the plot seemed to lead somewhere else. thank god for john carpenter's theme - the only factor connecting the whole series so far.

then came one of the best entries - halloween H2O. with jamie lee curtis reprising her decades-old role, the series was given new life and credibility. jamie's acting was top-notch and was ably supported by upcoming stars (hartnett, williams, arkin, etc). it was a great sequel, with the music updated by john ottman (orchestral version of the synthesized original), a great horror classic!

then came halloween resurrection. i hated this movie for killing off jamie lee's laurie strode character! what a letdown. i was so mad and sad after watching this movie. while the new cast was good, i don't think the series could survive without the laurie factor. it was the glue that held the series.

i heard that ""halloween 9"" simply titled ""HALLOWEEN"" would be dwelling with the history of michael - back in 1963 when he first murdered his older sister judith. i hope that the background story in part one, which will be the full blown plot of part 9, will rise above all the fans expectations.

Meanwhile, across town, Myles 'Deckard' Barton is watching Sara do her interview, because he interested in her. on HALLOWEEN, they all go to the Myers house, and broadcast live on the Internet for millions of people to watch No one can leave until the show is over, so they are all locked in. Little do they know, Michael is back and doesn't like uninvited guests. At a college HALLOWEEN party, Myles 'Deckard' is watching the show, and when Michael shows up, Myles believes that the actors are actually being killed, but no one else at the party does until Sara is the last one and calls Myles for help to tell her where Michael is at.

First of all, its very dissapointing to see that the continuation of H2O was simply Michael Myers not actually dying, rather fleeing away through some bushes dressed as a paramedic.

And then Jamie Lee Curtis being eliminated without a follow up at the beginning of the movie paves the way for what is one of the worst horror films ive seen lately.

The concept of having some people in Michael's house is not terribly bad, but the fact that they made it so to today's standards of ""horror films"" just discredited the whole movie. So many characters with pointless roles, this whole rapper celebrity trying to fist fight Michael Myers, its just too many elements that don't help.

First, after 25 years of trying to escape from brother Michael, this is how Laurie Strode goes out???!!! Major let down, it should have been more shocking and spectacular. Second, while ""20 Years Later/Halloween 7"" was made for Lifetime, this one seems to have been made for MTV. All Dimension films have done for this franchise since taking it over for Part 6, is give it style, no substance whatsoever. The only one of their 3 sequels that was remotely scary was 6, fully due to bringing back the guy who played Michael in 4(the last good Halloween film)George Wilbur, he's sorely missed but probably too old for the part now. Third, I'm so sick of rappers and models thinking they can act as is the case in this film with Busta Rhymes and Tyra Banks. No talent Busta needs to stick to cursing and throwing his hands around to a repetitive beat and Tyra needs to stick to walking a catwalk in some designer dress with her mouth shut. They suck. Hopefully Hollywood feels the same way since I haven't seen them in anything since, thank god. Fourth, the story is just another retread with a new gimmick, the internet web cam. Poorly executed, no suspense at all in this film. The film was originally suppossed to be released for Halloween '01, but they had to do reshoots to improve the film, unsuccessfully I might add, so it was released in summer '02. Funny, this film was directed by the same guy who directed ""Halloween II""(the best sequel). Even funnier is the fact that they had to do reshoots for that one as well, but John Carpenter did them and it DID improve the film. His touch is sorely missed here.
  So, if dreadful acting(except Jaime Lee Curtis, but she's only in the first 10 minutes, unfortunately), boring, dumb story and dialogue, shockless, routine kill scenes and no scares or suspense(unless your 10 years old and have never seen a horror film) if all that's your cup of tea then by all means watch or buy this waste of time, money & effort(if there was any). It's just another insult to fans of the original.
  And now, for next Halloween('07) we will get ""Halloween:The Remake"" directed by none other than the man who brought us the classic(NOT!!!) ""House Of 1000 Corpses"", Rob Zombie!

I love the original which came out in 1978 and the following sequal Holloween II. Both are top classics in the Horror genre. After 24 years and upteenth sequals later, this wacko is still alive? Come'on, Michael Myers should be in a wheelchair by now if not already dead but wait a minute....he was dead long ago when his sister Laurie, played by the lovely Jamie Lee Curtis who had killed him (i won't tell you how if you haven't seen it but it look pretty convincing to me) but he is back...i guess something never dies like Michael Myers. Speaking of which, you ever notice his mask looks like Captain Kirk in Star Trek? Well i did some research and found out that the mask was indeed made from William Shatners face. I guess he needed something to do when he is not out battling Klingons. Wouldn't it be cool if ST has Myers as their secret weapon which we send to the Klingons, they would surrender in no time haha.

If you don't know the history of the Myers, well back in 1965, Laurie and Michael's parents died in an automobile accident. Laurie and her parents went to visit Michael at the sanitarium where her parents instructed her to just sit and wait in the office. She waited for a time, but went off on her own and located her brother's cell. Laurie entered his room and the two saw one another. Then Laurie's parents found her and they hurriedly left. On their way home towards Haddonfield, they crashed their car, but Laurie had survived. She was adopted by neighbors Morgan and Pamela Strode. The Strodes requested to the court that the files of Laurie's biological family and her adoption be sealed for their protection. Laurie was only two when her brother killed their seventeen-year-old sister Judith. She was four when she lost her real parents. As Laurie got older, she forgot about her real family. Sometimes she has flashbacks of her early childhood and her one-time visit with Michael.

What does that has anything to do with Resurrection you might ask...well it doesn't which is partly why the movie so bad. I think i fell asleep watching this one but continue it in my dreams where he was chasing me where I climb onto this tree to hide which was weird.

The house, the small portion of the street that is actually visible on film and the ""outdoors"" were all created on a studio filming lot.  This, I feel, granted the movie a terribly fake aura.

The idea for the movie is an attempt to stretch the dark origins of Michael Myers into the modern, technological day.  It's a bit too much of a stretch, to be honest.  It comes off as cheesy.  The acting is not that bad, but the plot and the way it is played out are just short of pathetic.  The movie is not scary, suspenseful or even that interesting.

1786174,3,B00006LPHA,"""Halloween: Resurrection"" seemed sure to be a stinker.

  For one thing, the movie is the eighth installment of the Michael Myers series and horror films tend to go downhill with each new sequel. For proof, rent ""Jason X,"" the 10th film in the ""Friday the 13th"" series.

  Then there's the report that ""Resurrection"" was set to be released last fall, but was postponed so scenes could be reshot. Finally, it wasn't screened in advance for critics - which generally means the studio execs knows their movie is a bomb and want a few days to score some cash before the negative reviews hit the street.

  Yet, while not exactly quality cinema, ""Resurrection"" isn't nearly as terrible as it could have been. The story is mildly satisfying and it offers some truly suspenseful moments.

  As soon as the movie opens, the script by Larry Brand and Sean Hood rushes to explain that Myers didn't really die in the 1998 ""Halloween"" installment, ""H2O."" It turns out Jamie Lee Curtis killed another man who was wearing a similar mask. Whatever.

  From here on out, we should all just assume that anyone who dies in a ""Halloween"" movie may, in the next edition, come back to life, like Kenny in television's ""South Park"" before he finally was killed off for good.

  Curtis makes a brief appearance at the beginning of ""Resurrection,"" and it's easily the scariest and most artful segment of the film. The story suggests that this will be her final appearance as Myers' sister, Laurie Strode, but who knows? She may pull a Kenny and come back for ""Halloween Nine.""

  Things go slightly downhill from there. Six collegians are selected to be the subjects of a reality Internet site (sort of like MTV's ""Real World,"" only online). Because of the computer connection, the movie was almost given the pathetically lame title ""Halloween: MichaelMyers.com."" But director Rick Rosenthal does use technology to his advantage. During Friday's screening, some members of the audience jumped when the words ""He's still alive"" popped up on one character's Palm Pilot.

  At any rate, their assignment is to spend the night in Myers' childhood home on the night of Halloween. It probably would have been better if the movie had been released in the fall, as it's slightly disorienting to see pumpkins and youngsters dressed in costumes in July. But we digress.

  A number of the movie's young twentysomethings are bland and unusually homely as far as movie actors go. Especially annoying is Jim (Luke Kirby), who spends the entire movie doing a bad Jack Nicholson impression.

  One charming exception is Rudy (the talented Sean Patrick Thomas), who loves food and blames Myers' homicidal tendencies on a diet low in protein. Bianca Kajlich, the heroine who may just be smart enough to escape Myers' shining knife, is quite good. Rapper Busta Rhymes and model Tyra Banks give adequate performances as the producers of the Web site.

  More than two decades ago, Rosenthal directed ""Halloween II."" He clearly has a solid feel for the material.

  The most frightening thing about Myers has never been his knife. Rosenthal understands that what's even scarier is Myers' cold calculation. He puts more energy into showing us that - like the numerous scenes where he zooms in on Myers taking careful, slow steps toward his victims - than orchestrating elaborate slasher shots.

  Rosenthal won't take home any awards for his work in ""Resurrection."" But fans of the ""Halloween"" series will walk away satisfied with his work.",1132444800,,3495,4.92967409948542
1786175,4,B00006LPHA,"There is more than one way to view Halloween Resurrection. And depending on which you choose, you'll either like or hate the film. You can view it as a sequel and part of the convoluted ""back story"" involving Michael Myers, his sister and by extension, her daughter Jaime, Jaime's caretaker Rachel, the weird adult Tommy Doyle, an infant, somebody's dog, various teens' parents, the entire Thorn cult, drunk country boys with shotguns, Dr. Wynn in his cape and hat, a number of Sheriffs, and tiny clones in X-Files jars (it was the 90s, shrug). Or you can sit back, lighten up and enjoy it as a film that finally restores Michael Myers to what creators John Carpenter and Debra Hill originally intended him to be--a creep in a mask killing anyone in his path. The sister and ""Samhain"" subplots--which led to Thorn--were entertaining in their day, but not really what Carpenter wanted to emphasize. In this film, certainly not the best, but far from the worst, Myers returns to his roots. He literally leaves an institution, returns to Haddonfield and finds young people barging into his home (this time, to earn a few bucks with an Internet broadcast). The kids start poking around, Mike wants some peace and quiet so before you know it, he's mowing them down, kids are cheering at their monitors and Busta Rhymes (a rapper who also provided most of the energy in Singleton's Higher Learning) has to bust a few kung fu  moves on him. Resurrection's nothing serious or important; but it's got laughs, action, suspense, a decent Michael mask, a hot looking blonde and Mike respecting that, unlike his other victims, Busta hits back. Better in some ways than a few of the other sequels.",1132185600,,1683,4.783505154639175
1786176,4,B00006LPHA,"HALLOWEEN RESURRECTION
BRILIANT IDEA

When reviewing this film it is necessary to look at it from all angles. It's another sequel, the end of a legacy, and has a great idea in it. We'll start with the sequel thing, yes it is another in a long on going series. And yes some thought there should never have been another film following ""HALLOWEEN H2O"". But I think they covered those tracks pretty well with the reasoning in this one. With the way Michael switched with the medical guy and Jamie chopped his head off instead. So if one were to go by that this film makes perfect sense, and I for one enjoyed it.

With the end of a legacy is that Jamie Lee Curtis's character finally gets killed by Michael Myers, surprisingly in the very beginning of the movie. It was nice how she set him up though, with the way she lead him to the roof. And then got him strung up, but he held it down and made her think he was a different guy in the suit again. Of course she has to be sure, gets close, and he grabs her which brings the knife right down into her, she says ""see u in hell"", kisses him, and falls to her death.

Now the great idea was the head cam thing, it captures moments at angles the film cameras had no chance at getting, real emotion when the characters run into each other. That was brilliant, which brings me to writers Larry Brand, and Sean Hood, producer Paul Freeman, and director Rick Rosenthal who all did great jobs on this film. I give much props to them for bringing something original to a horror series without going to space. The idea of taking a reality show to the Myers house with a bunch of stupid kids was brilliant, especially since reality shows are real big now days. I enjoyed all the performances to a point, some better then others. Mainly Busta Rhymes, and Sean Patrick Thomas to point out some in particular. Each of these actors did excellent jobs with their characters such as Busta watching the kung-fu flick, and when he cussed out Michael Myers. And Thomas's performance as a guy obsessed with his work as a cook turns in an annoyingly funny performance, shown best in the scene where he is about to be killed by Myers, or when he talks about a diet being Myers problem.

Over all this is a worthy member in the HALLOWEEN family. Is it a classic like the original, no. Is it a fun new change for the franchise, yes.",1132185600,,2353,4.328798185941043
1786179,4,B00006LPHA,"As with any movie franchise that is nearing the double-digit mark, it proves tougher and tougher to try to bring something new to the table. Filmmakers, writers, producers, etc., seemingly are always deemed to add another notch to all ready squealed-to-death series'. Such is the case with the classic `Halloween' franchise.

However, instead of attempting to put Michael Myers (aka: The Shape) into such silly realms as outer space (a la `Friday the 13th's' Jason Voorhees-in what turned out to be nothing short of pure embarrassment for both the producing studio and fans alike!) `Halloween 2' veteran director Rick Rosenthal decided to take a more modern-day, practical approach. Using what every American all ready knows all-to-well about: reality television.

For some, this may have been the final straw that broke the camel's back; using what most moviegoers would consider to be unprofessional, low-end methods in an attempt to revitalize an ailing series. Such, were my thoughts! It seemed an odd attempt, this guerilla style filmmaking, in what is usually such a technically sterile environment that is Hollywood.

Guerilla style filmmaking or not, Rosenthal manages to pull off the impossible; not only using the consumer digital video format but learning to integrate it with the professional look of 35mm film! Some are quick to state that this has all ready been done via `The Blair Witch Project' but that would be a false assumption. `Blair Witch' used 16mm film and DV, both which were later blown up to a 35mm format so it could be viewed in theaters. Therefore, `Halloween 8' is unique in it's mixing both formats simultaneously.

Rosenthal and company were looking to create a more `documentary' type feel to the latest installment in the series and they managed to create just that. This proves to be vital to the film since, at this point in time, there is little left to reveal to the audience, at least as far as it's main characters are concerned. Probably, more people know more about Laura Strode and Michael Myers than they do some of their own family members!

Having said that, what else can one do to try to still maintain the audience's interests in these all ready exhausted characters? Gore will only carry you so far and big names will only cost your production a heck of a lot of money. Neither is a guarantee for success. So, what do you do? Why, you must reinvent!

`Halloween 8' is like a phoenix rising. And, while it is not perfect, it does manage to spark interest again. There are some `name' actors (or, at least, some familiar faces running around) that kill the suspense of the film. Those being Busta Rhymes, Thomas Ian Nichols (`American Pie' veteran), and Sean Patrick Thomas. And, while I find all three of these actors superb in their own right, I feel that their presence here is disingenuous and distracting. Whenever I see Mr. Nichols running frantically about, I keep waiting for Stifler to show up! These celebratity faces just produce the results a good horror film should not.

Pretty faces aside, the rest of the film generate some heart-pumping thrills. Rosenthal and director of photography, David Geddes, keep light levels low. And, as mentioned in the commentary, almost to the point of being dangerously low that should a mere candle have been blown out the picture would have gone entirely black! Video footage shot by the actors themselves is integrated with the look of professional film. Giving the overall production an `edgy' feel with its digital glitches sprinkled throughout partnered with the imperfectly framed DV shots. Surprisingly, it works!

Musically speaking, Carpenter's original main score is still recognizable but little remains of it. Composer Danny Lux does a descent job combining the past with the present. The 5.1 Dolby Digital mix is also very active and effective enough so that you'll be snapping a few quick glances over your shoulder to be sure the Shape himself isn't standing behind you!

Unusual as it may seem, Dimension Home Video has packed this disc full of fun, informative bonus features. First, a must listen to commentary track by director Rosenthal and Editor Robert A. Ferretti. Like Carpenter, Rosenthal is quick to point out his `areas of improvement' and even goes as far as to point out a crew member lying on the floor holding a flag in the film! Mostly, his self-critical analysis is typical of any director and it just goes to show how much of a professional Mr. Rosenthal is and how he has evolved over the past 20 years since his having helmed the 2nd entry in this series.

Topping off the disc are such gems as a deleted scenes section (with commentary!) as well as a 40-minute webcam special (also with commentary) which gets to be so slightly nauseating after awhile.  There are numerous featurettes dealing with set design as well as Jamie Lee Curtis's thoughts on finally killing off her much admired and loved character Laura Strode. Also included is a very healthy Stills Gallery.

With a clear conscious, I can state that `Halloween: Resurrection' is a welcomed new entry. Having said that though, I'm not sure where the ol' Myers kid is to go from here. For the next director that should dare to helm yet another entry, I can only state that the Shape needs to stay put at home. Avoid the wackiness of space and ignore any high-flown ideas that would make our beloved Michael into something he's not; such as an angry spirit or evil alter ego via Martha Stewart. Keep him grounded safely in his roots. Just another deranged serial killer, who as Rosenthal jokes, is getting ever so closer to collecting his social security! And, at this point in the franchise, that may not be such a cursed statement. After all, if I see Myers terrorizing a retirement home, I'm definitely throwing in my `Halloween' towel!",1131580800,,5834,4.881818181818182
1786180,3,B00006LPHA,"When I heard they were making an eighth Halloween movie, I didn't really know what to think. Of course the initial thought that popped into my head and most others was, ""Wait Michael died in the last one, didn't he?"". Well of course not. Halloween: Resurrection is indeed the most laughable installment in the entire Halloween series (except once again the utterly awful Halloween 3), and I like most other fans feel this movie is really an injustice not only to the other movies, but to the fans themselves. There's nothing remotely special about this movie except the fact that Myers is alive and killing again, and has a new batch of victims to take care of. While Rick Rosenthal dose a stellar job directing, and the actors and actresses for the most part are decent, the script completely kills this movie, and despite having a full suspenseful moments, this movie is as unscary as Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers. You definitely have to go into this one with an open mind if you want to have any attempt at enjoying the film.

Ok so big questions will be answered first. Of course everyone wants to know, how in the world is Michael still alive. Well the clever writers took it upon themselves to come up with the idea that the ""Michael"" that Jamie Lee Curtis killed in Halloween H20 wasn't really Michael Myers. Yes it turns out that the Michael that Jamie chopped the head off of at the end of the last movie, was actually a paramedic, whom had his vocal cords crushed by Michael Myers while investigating the scene of the crime. Michael then of course dressed the unconsciouss paramedic up in his clothes, and promptly fleed the scene. You'd think some of the other paramedics would wonder what happened to their co-worker. I imagine their conversation went something like this:

Paramedic #1: ""Hey have you seen Bill? He was supposed to be back from cleaning up that body like 20 minutes ago.""

Paramedic #2: ""No, but maybe we should ask that big guy over there in Bill's clothes, walking into the woods with the large knife if he's seen him.""

This just utterly insults all the fans of the movies. This movie seems like nothing more than an attempt to bring Myers into the new Millenium and to a new audience of younger viewers who have never watched his movies. Unfortunately with terrible plots as this one, I hope these poor children are never subjected to such cruelty. On top of Myers coming back from the dead, Laurie Strode (once again Jamie Lee Curtis) is effectively killed off within the first ten minutes of the movie. The writers have now effectively killed any motivation for Myers to kill anyone anymore. With Dr. Loomis and Laurie Strode dead, the story immediately collapses. From there the movie shifts to a group of college students who have all been selected to spend the night in Michael's old house for scholarship money, and possible fame. Of course the student's stay will be broadcast on the internet. Once inside the house they of course discover that Myers is not dead and that he has been living under his house the whole time. So the shows quickly shifts into an attempt by the students to stay alive, while Michael has his way with them. Woo. While the story had some potential, the characters lack depth and originality, and with the main characters of the story (Laurie Strode, Dr. Loomis) dead, there's no real reason for Myers to even be around anymore. These facts all bring the movie down significantly. Also for the most part Myers isn't even scary. There's very little suspense or intense scenes, which makes the movie feel stale and unoriginal. Not exactly what you'd want to be watching for an hour and a half.

The actors and actresses aren't particularly bad, they just do not have significant developments, or parts to work with. Most of them are just there to get killed, and surprisingly you don't really care when it happens. It's just like, ""Oh well, scratch up another one for Michael."" The best character in the Movie is Busta Rhymes, who actually saves the movie from being an utter dissapointment. His scenes with Michael Myers are particularly memorable, especially the one when Busta is dressed up as Michael, and Myers stalks up behind him. The internet broadcast aspect adds significant depth to the plot, but overall it's used poorly. If it wasn't for seeing Myers back in action, I just wouldn't have even been able to stand this movie.

Like usual the ending leaves you with the idea that Myers isn't dead, and that there will inevitably be another sequel. If there is, I can only hope it is a step up from Halloween: Resurrection. I don't really understand where they could take the story though, since Laurie and Loomis are dead, and apparently nothing that happened in Halloween 4-6 was real. I can only see Myers going after John Strode (Laurie's son, aka Josh Hartnett from H20), but I'm scared at even the thought of what something like that might turn out like. Overall Halloween: Resurrection is about as dissapointed as I've ever been in a Halloween movie. Even Halloween : The Curse of Michael Myers is more engaging than this one, and the story in that one doesn't even make sense!(at least not in the theatrical cut). So if you're a Halloween vet, prepare to be dissapointed, and if this is your first introduction to the Halloween series, please do yourself a favor and see the original movie. This pales in comparison to anything the franchise has ever done, and is definitely the black horse of the series. Don't get your hopes up.",1131408000,,5524,4.695562435500516
1786181,3,B00006LPHA,"Rick Rosenthal returns to the directing chair for Halloween and does a pretty good job, not as good as his efforts on Halloween 2 but still good.

Jamie Lee Curtis is in the movie for a total of almost 18 minutes, but her performance is really good. Brad Loree, is probably the 2nd best when it came to playing Michael Myers, he moves well as the character. Another actress i will give credit is Bianca Kajlich as Sara, the character Sara is basically the only character you can take seriously in this movie, besides Laurie Strode and Michael Myers.

Now on to the actors who shouldn't have been in this movie. Busta Rhymes, he cannot act. LL Cool J in H20 played a very similar role but since it was kind of small, nobody really cared. Busta Rhymes is completely different, he has a starring role, which sucks. I'll never forget when this movie debut in theaters, people cheered when Busta Rhymes finally got stabbed.

Rick Rosenthal brings back some classic Halloween shots that H20 didn't really do. 1 was Michaels Myers being able to somehow appear and disappear, H20 really didn't do that. 2 was giving some scenes a very dark tone. A nice example of that is Myers killing the character Donna, when the chase starts, Myers begins walking and all you see is part of the mask hit the light, i thought shots like those were awesome.

Overall, a 3 out of 5. It is definitely not perfect but it is not bad. Resurrection is a really entertaining film with few scary moments, but it is worth watching.",1131235200,,1499,4.520295202952029
1786182,3,B00006LPHA,"I've watched quite a few slasher flicks in my day.  I've never been a huge fan of them, but the ""Halloween"" movies always seemed to be a step up from the rest.  With that said, ""Halloween:  Resurrection"" is one of the better sequels in this series.  Sure, it's a bit silly at times, but even the silly parts work in this film.

The story is primarily set in the Myers' household on Halloween night.  An internet-based entertainment company, represented by Busta Rhymes and Tyra Banks, invites a group of teenagers to spend an evening in the home.  The idea is that they must spend a night in the house and anyone who makes it through the night is awarded with a scholarship and internet screen time.  To try and scare them away, Rhymes has a few tricks up his sleeve(including dressing up as ol' Mikey himself).

There is a brief appearance by Jamie Lee Curtis in this flick which is rather unceremonious.  However, it's fun to see that she and her sibling still love one another after all these years.  After the cameo, we are introduced to a small band of teens at a Halloween party watching the action on the internet.  One of the teens has a softspot for one of the victims in the film.  Naturally, he helps her via the internet by telling her where Michael Myers is hiding out in the house.

Though most of the acting is modest at best, you'll recognize at least two of the victims in the house.  One of them is the boring kid from the ""American Pie"" series.  He basically plays the same boring and annoying character except this time he's a little bit more aggressive with the ladies.  The other guy you'll recognize is the college man off of the ""Barbershop"" flicks.  His character is one of the more entertaining ones to watch.  For SciFi channel fans, Katiee Sackhoff will look familiar.  She's Starbuck on the new ""Battlestar Galactica"" series.  Of course, there is also the aforementioned Tyra Banks and Busta Rhymes, who gives the best performance in the flick.  He's downright funny at times and when he get medieval on Mikey, it's hilarious.

In all, this isn't a very shabby movie.  It isn't the best flick in the series, but it is better than most of the other slasher sequels out there.  Recommended to ""Halloween"" fans and slasher fans in general, but I'd rent it before I'd buy it.",1131062400,,2300,4.537712895377129

When H20 made money at the box office, they just thought of that dumb idea. Then, they killed Laurie Strode {Curtis}, that was dumb too.

Now, this is where it gets really dumb...the film's plot. A group of dumb teenagers decide to do this internet thing of going in the Myers house. while their in the house, they don't know that Michael Myers {Loree} is in there, and nothing does Freddie {Rhymes} who dresses up as Michael Myers to scare the dumb teenagers.

This film is the worst Halloween film in the entire series. I looked at my watch many times, saying how much loner does this film have left. The fight between Myers and Freddie was retarded, seeing Busta Rhymes acting like Bruce Lee.

Halloween: Resurrection is a piece of junk. They should've just ened the series with H20, because this film did a bad job resurrecting Michael Myers.",1128816000,5,1100,4.545454545454546
1786202,1,B00006LPHA,"This is a review of the HALLOWEEN RESURRECTION DVD rather than its contents.

I am so sick of Hollywood's poorly manufactured DVDs.  I rented a copy of HALLOWEEN RESURRECTION from Netflix, popped in the DVD player.  I saw the FBI WARNING, then the Dimension logo, and then ... NOTHING.  It just sat there, a black screen.  I waited and waited, I pushed both the Menu and Play buttons, among others.  Every time I pressed a button the DVD flashed that familiar stop sign in the corner of the screen.

I removed the DVD and popped it in again.  The problem persisted.

So I returned the DVD and got a second one.  SAME PROBLEM!

So I tried it on my Thinkpad laptop, and it worked.  Actually, it stopped the first time in the middle of the credits, and I had to eject it and pop it back in -- and see the FBI WARNING and Dimension logos and previews yet again -- but I was finally able to see the movie on my laptop.

However poorly manufactured this DVD is, Dimension sure makes certain that you see that FBI WARNING.  No problem with that playing on any DVD player.

I have a JVC DVD player that plays most DVDs, but maybe once every month or two it finds a DVD it can't play, but that my laptop can.  I assume you need a higher-end player to play some DVDs because Hollywood's manufacturing is so shoddy you need a player that can correct for crappy DVD tracks.

Also, if you google ""DVD rot"" you'll see that there's a major problem with DVDs rotting away over time, so forget about building a personal film library.

For some reason, CDs and CD-ROMs don't have the problem of DVDs.  I suspect the film studios intentionally use low manufacturing standards because they don't want people building up film libraries.  After all, they make no money on used DVD sales.  Better that DVDs should rot, or easily scratch, over time so that consumers will be forced to buy new copies, especially after they switch formats yet again.

As for HALLOWEEN RESURRECTION's contents, it's okay.  If you liked the previous HALLOWEEN films, this is decent enough.  I'd give it three stars, but the crappy DVD manufacture deserves less than one.",1127692800,,2126,4.505235602094241

1786204,3,B00006LPHA,"Reports have it that Jamie Lee Curtis only agreed to reprise her role as Laurie Strode if it was the last time the character was used.  With that in mind, it's still amazing that Curtis can take even the smallest of roles and make something of them.  Her scene with brother Michael on the roof of an insane asylum is quite chilling.  It was bound to happen in this technological age of ours that the setting for this eighth edition of the Michael Myers series takes place on a reality type show set in Myers' now abandoned abode.  Rap singer Busta Rhymes (proving that rap singers should stick to rap singing) is the instigator of a reality show that will be available for viewing on the Internet.  Of course when a gang of party revelers signs in to watch, they think that what's going on is really just typical t.v. hype.  There's lots of blood and gore and the participants are wasted in the appropriately ghoulish manner.  Myers continues to murder with a cold heart and a quick thrust of the knife.  Of course the ending is open-ended enough to postulate a ninth entry, but in all reality (no pun intended), it may be time to let Myers stay dead this time.",1126396800,,1161,4.443396226415095

Some show biz people are broadcasting a show over the internet about some people who are going to stay in the legendary Myers house for one night. But when they enter into the house, the bloodbath begins as they are fighting for there lives against the real life boogeyman, Michael Myers.

But this story, like Halloween: H20 completely ignores sequels 3-6. Supposedly nobody has lived in the Myers since the incident described in the first Halloween, but it is clearly shown and is basically the story line in Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers about the family that is living in the Myers house. So that cleary shows the continuity of this movie. If you are going to make any respectable sequel, you must acknowledge the ones that come in between.

The beginning prologue in the movie is okay until [SPOILER!] Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) dies. You cannot have a movie where the woman who has survived Michael's rampage through three movies have some little cameo in a series that made her famous. Seriously, because of the death of Jamie Lee Curtis, this movie has only been rated two stars in my mind!",1120521600,2,1207,4.742857142857143

Once the actual plotline gets started the movie starts to move farely slow, small background appearances of michael, but nothing major.  Finally within the last 20 minutes of the film he starts his usual killing frenzy.

The webcam aspect of the movie was extremely original, but not enough footage of the webcam was shown.

Rick Rosenthal directed Halloween 2 which was great and with this one he just didn't do a good job.  The beginning is really interesting with Jamie Lee Curtis locked up in a mental institution. I won't give away why. Michael of course finds her like usual. But the beginnng in probably the best part of the movie, where Jamie ( Laurie Strode) finally confronts Michael for the last time. Then the story turns to a handful of college kids picked to go to Michael Myers house to investigate why he went mad. This is telecast to everyone watching it because they all have there cameras on with them and what they see the audience sees. The college kids are part of a reality show called Dangertainment created by Rhymes and Banks.  They all assume this will help advance their careers to a higher level.  Of course there is the usual perverse  ""humor"" and some nudity. The acting is extremly poor when it comes to the college kids.  Tyra Banks is horribly cast and so is Busta Rhymes. There is the usual gore but it is really not that scary except for Michael Myers. Even the shots made at night didn't have the usual gloomy atmosphere. I hestitated giving it 2 starts because I am a huge fan. The extras like the making the movie maybe more interesting to some people than the actual movie itself.  It shows how the Halloween house was made and a few behind the scenes moments including one with Jamie Lee Curtis.

1786218,5,B00006LPHA,"In 2001, director Rick Rosenthal, who had directed the second installment to the HALLOWEEN series had returned to the director's chair to direct the series' eighth installment entitled, HALLOWEEN: RESURRECTION.

  It has been three years since LAURIE STRODE (again played by Jamie Lee Curtis) had once again come face to face, with her mad brother, MICHAEL MYERS (played by Brad Loree). Laurie is now in a mental institution, just outside of Haddonfield. The reason for her being there is that, Halloween Night of 1998, just three years ago, but twenty years after her first encounter with Michael, Laurie had thought she decapitated Michael Myers. As it turned out, she didn't. After Laurie had left him for dead in the Hilcrest cafeteria, a paramedic showed up and decided to check him out. At that moment, Michael regained consciousness and crushed the paramedic's larynx, causing him to lose total control of his voice. Michael stripped out of his clothes and stripped the paramedic out of his. Michael dressed in the paramedic's outfit, dressing the paramedic in Michael's and putting the paramedic in the Myers mask. Laurie had killed the paramedic by mistake, thinking he was Michael Myers.

  Two nurses enter Laurie's room to give Laurie her medication, talking about what had happened to Laurie, three years earlier. The head nurse reveals to the other that all Laurie does is stare out the window. As the nurses leave, Laurie spits out the two pills and hides them in her little doll, where millions of other pills are hidden. She goes to the window and sees another apparition of Michael.

  The hospital's security guard, WILLIE (played by Dan Joffre) is walking around the front, making sure everything is in order, until he runs into HAROLD (played by Gus Lynch), one of the hospital's patients. Willie escorts Harold back to his room, but the head security guard claims to see Harold walking around in the basement. The two head down to get Harold and put him back in his room. While the other security guard goes down to get Harold, Willie stops at a vending machine. But he does not have enough time to eat, for he runs down to the basement after hearing the other guard scream. The other guard is dead. As Willie panics, just as Michael appears behind him and slashes his throat. He enters Laurie's room and is bashed over the head with a lamp, by Laurie. She runs to the roof and traps Michael by roping his leg and hanging him upside down. She tells him how he failed. She begins cutting the rope with Michael's knife, but he begins acting strange. Laurie, remembering the mistake she made three years earlier, tries to pull off Michael's mask, but he grabs her and the both go over the roof. Michael, holding on the rope with one arm, stabs Laurie in the back, finally killing her. Her last words are, ""...I'll see you in Hell..."" He drops her down to the ground, where she immediately dies, after her 23-year fight.

  The next morning, October 30th, three friends, SARA MOYER (played by Bianca Kajlich), JEN DANZIG (played by Katee Sackhof), and RUDY GRIMES (played by Sean Patrick Thomas) have entered a contest entitled DANGERTAINMENT, where six winners will be selected for an Internet Reality show of the same name. The first assignment will be the investigation of the Myers house. Sara, Rudy, and Jen are three of the six winners. Sara is not sure about this, so she asks for some advice from one of her e-mail chat buddies, who she only knows as Deckard.

  Deckard's real name is MYLES BARTON (played by Ryan Merriman). Myles is sort of shy and would rather spend more time inside on the internet than outdoors. SCOTT, Myles roommate, is more outgoing.

  The next morning, Halloween, Sara, Jen, and Rudy, meet up with the other three contest winners: JIM MORGAN (played by Luke Kirby), BILL WOODLAKE (played by Thomas Ian Nicholas), and DONNA CHANG (played by Daisy McCrackin). The winners meet FREDDY HARRIS (played by rapper, Busta Rhymes), creator of Dangertainment, and his girlfriend, NORA WINSTON (played by Tyra Banks).

  They arrive at the Myers house and begin their investigation throughout the afternoon, and into the night. Myles was forced by Scott to attend Scott's sister's college Halloween party, but Myles found a room, where he can watch the investigation. Basically the whole party, after awhile, joins Myles and watches the investigation with a lot of interest.

  One by one, each of the contestants are killed until only Sara and Freddy are left. Sara has with her an internet keypad, where she talks to Miles. He helps her out, as Freddy tries to beat the hell out Michael. Michael knocks out Freddy, sending Sara to the garage, where a large object traps Sara, as a fire is created in the garage. Freddy comes and sort of electrocutes Michael with broken wires. He and Sara flee the garage and reach safety.

  This was definitely a worthy follow-up, but I was disappointed in seeing Laurie Strode killed. I was disappointed in not seeing the re-introduction of her son, John. More importantly, I was really disappointed at the fact that every HALLOWEEN sequel that comes along, Donald Pleasance will not be there to participate since he sadly passed away over ten years ago now.

So far Halloween 4 is the only one to arguativly measure up, while five and six tried to incorporate a storyline which was retarded and thus would have killed the franchise had Jamie Lee Curtis not wanted to do H20.  Now H20 wasn't a scary move in the least bit, but it was a respectable Halloween sequel, this one...this one was ok, not the best, but it wasn't horrible, it's watchable because there are some scares and fans love Michael and the Halloween Theme music.

And it must set a record for one actor successfully killing an entire movie with godawful acting. This, of course, is Busta Rhymes, a rap star turned dreadful actor who gives what must be the worst performance ever put on celluloid. I'm not sure why it became trendy to put rap stars with no acting abilities in prestigious films (ie Redman in Seed of Chucky, for one), but hopefully the trend will die off soon. Why not hire someone that can actually act? Hearing Busta shout ghetto-hip profanity with Michael while engaging in kung fu is one of the most painful viewing experiences one can imagine. This is not acting, this is a cheaply done rap video come to life. And part of the blame must lie with producer Moustapha Akkad, who probably thought it was better to create something trendy than a genuinely suspenseful sequel.

I think the best thing about the series is Laurie Strode, and Jamie Lee Curtis has some of her best acting throughout the beginning of the movie. That's why I gave this not one star, but two!

They really could have made something good, but it was all wasted as soon as the real credits started and there was some lame plot. The camera angles are so confusing through the whole thing except for the beginning, and the acting flat out sucks (after Laurie Strode's part). It's a flat out waste of money to rent or buy this film, because I can honestly say that I won't be watching it again, although I might watch the beginning with the great Laurie Strode many times to come.

It doesn't seem like a real Halloween film should be, because it's a bunch of wacky college or high school students staying all night in the Myers' home for people on the internet to watch. The murders began, but you can't really figure out WHY Michael wants to kill all of these people. The reason he really kills people is because they're in his way for him to get to his family, but now, he's just going on a killing spree for no apparent reason other than a few people are staying in his house.

So I guess it would be a good idea to check this movie out because of the really great beginning with Laurie, but I barely was able to watch the entire thing. It kept me bored and yawning.",1112140800,2,1591,4.240924092409241
1786233,5,B00006LPHA,"In my opinion this film is was not the best entry in the series, although it does have some interesting and innovative ideas flying here and there it really can't compare to the previous Halloween films. The unstoppable serial killer Michael Myers is back once again in the 8th Halloween installment. A few years ago Laurie Strode decapitated Michael Myers, she is now locked up in a psychiatric hospital for killing a person who believe it or not wasn't the real Michael Myers; it was actually an EMT who got his larynx crushed by Michael Myers and switched clothes with him. The people working at facility are convinced that she has a mental disorder. She knows that Michael Myers is stalking her and must hide. Michael kills off most if not all the guards and immediately walks into the hospital. Another patient in the hospital who really does have a mental disorder sees Michael Myers walk down the hallway and is curious about him. Michael Myers walks into Laurie Strode' room only to discover that she's not there then Laurie walks out of the closet and knocks him out straight cold.  She escapes and Michael Myers gets back up, he walks up to the top of the building and he steps into Laurie' trap that she made. He is now hanging upside down, Laurie then decides to cut the rope but before that rope is cut, a weird sound coming from Michael makes her repress the feelings about him. She stops cutting and attempts pull off Michael' mask. Before she can get it off, he grabs her and then they fall over the building and Michael stabs her with the knife. Michael Myers is still hanging while Laurie Strode falls to the ground and dies. While Michael Myers is walking down the hallway, he notices the psycho patient in the room. The mentally disoriented man is happy to see him and Michael Myers realizes he is special so instead of killing him he hands his legendary knife over to him as a gift. Michael Myers then walks out of the hospital and then it cuts to an much different part of the story. A group of young people who go to the local college in Haddonfield, Illinois have selected to be in a reality entertainment show called ""Dangertainment"" that is to be broadcasted live on the internet. The reality show is run by a young black man named Freddie Harris played by Busta Rhymes the innovative rapper and actor. What contestants don't know is that Michael Myers is in Haddonfield and he's come to clean house. While Busta Rhymes' assistant and monitor played by Tyra Banks is drinking Cappacino one of the camera crew is stabbed by Michael with the sharp end of the camera, Michael Myers had already dragged him out before she could take a chance to look. The contestests soon enter the home and the broadcast begins, one by one the they get killed during the night by Michael Myers.

Meanwhile at a teen halloween party in Haddonfield, a teen boy named Miles ""Deckard"" Barton played by Ryan Merriman has started a little party of his own. Soon many of the teens at the party are watching the contestests die one by one on the plasma screen. They think it's fake and that it's just apart of the entertainment, but they are really getting killed by Michael Myers it's not fake. As the film gets to the end only two survivors remain a girl and Freddie. Michael Myers attempts to kill Freddie but he is no match for his impressive Karate skills, and he gets his ass kicked out the window. At the end of film Michael Myers is electrocuted and the entire Myers house burns down, Freddie warns everyone in an interview about the danger of serial killer Michael Myers before he leaves.

Jamie Lee Curtis may be on the cover, but she is killed before the opening credits. I'm sure she's relieved because her character and this whole series should have died years and sequals ago. I'm more of a Jason Vorhees fan and Michael never really got my blood pumping, but I like these sort of movies and have seen them all. The Michael Myers saga is really running on fumes and this movie may be the last.

'Dangertainment' run by Busta Rhymes and the beautiful (I mean really hot) Tyra Banks gets six kids to spend Halloween night in the old Myers place. Everybody wears these annoying webcams on their heads and everything is broadcast over the internet via live feed.

Well Busta wants to give everyone a good show, so he plants stuff everywhere and even dresses up like Michael. I had to admit it was pretty funny when Michael meets Busta dressed up as himself. He just stands there as Busta assaults him with profane gangsta jive.

Well let's see who's in this. You remember the black dude who crashed the party in 'Not another teen movie'? You remember him, he was mixing drinks and was asked to leave by 'the' black guy. Then we got that annoying kid from American Pie, thankfully he was killed first. A really cute red-head who does show her boobs during a botched love scene in the basement. A hot but ditzy blonde who's head takes a tumble down the stairs, a freaky music major dude, and our heroine who is about as rememberable as any female survivor from Friday the 13th.

A couple of decent kills, but nothing that will make you jump. The best thing about Mike Myers was the way he can just slowly appear out of the shadows with his mask showing first. Thankfully they left that in.

The bonus materials are OK. The original ending stunk, and so did the alternate endings. The deleted scenes were nothing special except for the photo album that was found showing baby Michael chained in the high chair.

1786239,1,B00006LPHA,"Michael Myers is dead. Why won't Halloween executive producer Moustapha Akkad let him rest in peace?

There is a moment, a brief, fleeting instant, in this unbelievably unenjoyable train-wreck of a movie, where Halloween:Resurrection actually creeps and crawls. It lasts about 30 seconds, so if you're fast forwarding through this unending yawnfest (and I used the fast-forward button early and often throughout Halloween:Resurrection) you might miss it.

A door opens, and the series's Shatner-mask wearing slasher glides through and into a shadowy room, butcher knife held aloft. Seconds later, the same door clicks open, and yet *another* Myers glides through, following the first; through the darkened, poorly lit rooms of the old Myers house they go, one following his twin like a shark. Creepy.

And really, with the exception of the opening sequence in an insane asylum (which dispatches poor heroine Jamie Lee Curtis with all the aplomb of a tailgate drunk squashing an ant), this scene, about 30 seconds long, is all the fun you're going to get out of this movie. And that's somewhat surprising, particularly given the success of its clever and refreshing little exercise in bloodlust ""H20"", to say nothing of the fact that ""Resurrection"" is helmed by director Rick Rosenthal, who was at the reins of the second Halloween installment.

Is it really that difficult to make an entertaining slasher flick, particularly if you've got a passle of libidinous teen-agers who are going to be spending the night in the old Myers house, now a rotten, crumbling derelict? Is it really that difficult, considering that the infamous serial killer, thought to have been beheaded by his sister in the previous film, has in fact fooled everybody, murdered his sister, and is now heading home for the holidays?

If the film in question is ""Halloween:Resurrection"", the answer is: it's pretty well nigh impossible. I went in with low expectations and a case of India Pale Ale, and all I wanted was a little spooky hack-n-slash, and perhaps a game of cat-in-mouse in the shadows.

I didn't even get one halfway decent kill. The movie's premise is as thin as this month's supermodel: a group of teens wins a contest to appear on an Internet reality show (original, huh?), which offers them the chance to spend the night in Michael Myers ruined house. Live through the night, get great door prizes!

Cameras are affixed throughout the house, and emcee/producer Busta Rhymes and his lovely assistant (played by supermodel Tyra Banks) load the house up with spooky goodies to scare the kids for the viewing pleasure of the home audience.

Busta Rhymes? Tyra Banks?

Never mind that, it's going to be the least of your worries. Michael Myers, of course, is loose in the house, and for about 30 minutes one entertains the hope that all sorts of wicked mayhem will ensue. For the love of Jason, you've got Busta Rhymes dressing up like Myers to scare the kiddies---surely they'll wise up to the ruse, and later confront the *real* Myers, only to get slaughtered, right?

Wrong. The most obvious set-up in the whole film doesn't happen. And worse still, despite the fact that a house-party-full of annoying teenagers has occupied his old home and hearth, Myers spends the first half of the movie just wandering around from room to room, killing---absolutely no one.

To recap: we have a listless & bored Michael Myers, we have a mask with big bushy eyebrows, we have Busta Rhymes and Tyra Banks, we have boring kills, we have lots of grainy Internet-cams that look worse than your home PC's camera unit, and---oh yes, don't let me forget---we have one of the house guest's friends, in attendance at another party, watching the festivities on *his* computer and making helpful I-pad suggestions, like: ""HE'S IN THE HOUSE!"", or better yet ""HE'S STILL ALIVE!"".

If your idea of horror movie fun is watching a screenful of drunken teenage idiots staring at a grainy computer screen and yelling ""don't go in there"" to the heroine, then you'll love ""Halloween:Resurrection."" Otherwise, the DVD makes a nice coaster for your drink while you're watching a real horror movie.

1786241,4,B00006LPHA,"well when i first saw this movie in cinemas i loved it because it was a hell of an experience which can not be denied, the score is excellent and creepy and we had some good violence and gore and some interesting new details about michael and his history. Ofcourse i to would have liked it if michael pursued his family and it would have made sense but look at it this way. Michael is under the curse of thorn and his body is playing host, he can sometimes fight the pain which is seen in some of the halloweens (if you haven't seen the other ones and/or don't know what i'm talking about then you're no-one to judge this film)so anyway i believe that michael went back home to grant him the serenity and to stop himself which is why he concreted himself in a room but one night the power of the curse was so strong that he went mad and just had to go to laurie to kill her to stop the pain and as far as these kids in his house goes michael feels invaded and goes into an all out rage. I definetley would've liked it if the baby or tommy or danny were in this but with the way movies are being made these days did you really have your hopes up?.

Jamie Lee Curtis' prologue is tame and very unoriginal. Blah.

But then the rest of the movie is just as bland and boring.

I was wishing for each teen in the haunted house to get taken out but sadly a few live. Each teen was dumb as hell and just as tedious. Heck, even the death scenes were lame. How many stabbings and slashings can we get? From the first to the last death scene there was not one original 'death.' No funny or witty killings like in a Jason or Freddy movie. Nothing. Blah.

The only thing i really liked about this movie was Busta Rhymes, which is a scary thought. He had a few funny lines with his trademark curse (mofo) and his karate scenes were funny, though im not sure if they were intended to be comedic...

1786248,3,B00006LPHA,"The 8th (and probably final) installment of the Halloween series wasn't half bad considering the expectations I had for the movie, but this time I don't even think Busta Rhymes had a chance!  The original idea of Halloween is so worn down and the idea of Michael Meyer's killing spree was so focused (if Jamie had lived they may have had a chance) that it was time for him to be finished killing.  This plot is finally exhausted, however it did go out with a decent blaze of glory.

Michael Meyers has finally done it, he's sent Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) to the nut house and this time she's not going anywhere.  Just in case, Michael breaks into her institution and kills her off.  Now Michael is being tempted by an online gameshow that puts contestants in the Meyers house and tries to have them live the night.  Naturally everyone thinks Michael Meyers is dead, but they soon realize that they may have a hit on their hands as the gameshow is much more than they bargained for when the contestants begin to turn up actually dead!

Like I said in the heading, I know the direction they were going with this film, they killed off Laurie and now he's got nothing to do, why not intice him with modern entertainment?  They put together a decent script that keeps you interested for the whole hour and a half but my biggest problem is that I have no compassion for the characters!  Only because of his stardom outside of this movie did I even root for Busta Rhymes (although I saw this in a Chicago south side theatre and the loud young ladies that were HUGE Busta fans made this film twice as good, if I could get a version with their commentary this movie would get another star)!  The deaths have a decent amount of gore, although most Halloween fans aren't looking for that.  The character development is so weak that you'll never root for anyone in particular (except maybe Busta, but it has nothing to do with the script).  All in all the movie is a typical ""introduce a bunch of good looking young kids and kill them off one by one"" script.  Laurie dieing definitely admits defeat in trying to keep her in the picture and the way this movie ends leads me to believe that the lid has been closed on this horror series (but hey, we can always weave him into a Freddy Vs. Jason sequel)!

The DVD doesn't really have much to offer, but I don't even think that avid fans care.  If you dug the movie you'll get the near-theatre experience (unless yours was as entertaining as mine) with a crisp widescreen transfer and sharp 5.1 surround.  This movie doesn't compare to the classic 80's and early 90's horror films, but when compared to some of today's modern horror movies (Soul Survivors?) it's not bad.  If you get this movie it's because you like it (or you're a completist) it's not because it's a member of the Halloween series.  My advice: rent it and decide for yourself (or hell, just buy it like I did because it costs like $3 to rent and $10 to buy).",1093392000,2,2968,4.434622467771639

1786263,3,B00006LPHA,"Michael Meyers returns again to spread horror and invoke the bloodbath due to this cinematic legend spawned of the Shadow Side of the dark recesses of the mind. He passes through the Samhein veil to walk again amongt the human sheep as the Repaer with a butcher knife as scythe.  Very few characters manage to provide that certain eerie embience as Meyer does, and it does prove evident in this chapter, although still not comparable to the first two, which thuroughly preserves the pure 'spirit' of horror and fear, which is sadlt deficient in the 'current' herd world's  entertainment fare beyond these haunted walls.

The distinctive theme is timelessly unforgettable, bringing the haunting enchantment forth in full.  A serial-killer card collecting horror-fantom adorned as a clown receives a most impressive bestowal during one of Meyers' killing sprees during the introductory sequence - his freshly bloodied knife, possibly to carry on the tradition. This film certainly offers an exceptional bent, calling to mind the program 'Fear' where, by the attept of two media entrepreneurs, think up an idea to install cameras in Meyers' home, which has also been equipped in a few places with prsthetic body parts, arranged in a manner relative to  the legend, but they certainly were not counting on Meyers still residing therein the basement. So he goes about dispatching these squatters, all broadcast in prime time on Halloween night for the Letharginator audience to see, of which they are oblivious to the actuality of the slayings, and instead derive their eustress, gaffawing while gawking at the slaughter.

It eventually dawns upon the participants {victims} that this is the genuine article, taking their final breaths {sometimes through their gaping throats}while the clownish masses reel in blood-thristy bliss.

I found it rather pleasurable to witness this pretentious lot placed to death after becoming acquainted with their rude, vulgar,and dishevelled manner.

It was also interesting to notice that the mask appears to display eyeliner upon it, which is only a small-bit sitacting, ad somewhat takes away from its original cold countenenace, considering it was initially fashioned in the likeness of William Shatner turned inside-out.

He is also just terrible, even by the standards of this genre. Rick Rosenthal directed Halloween 2, which also blew, and shows that he still has no sense of suspense whatsoever, and is incapable of creating scares. His idea of horror is just to occasionally show some gore, that's it. This movie has a good concept, but couldn't be worse. Watch 1 again, watch 4 (it's real good!) watch 6.

1786265,3,B00006LPHA,"What can I say about Halloween Resurrection?  It not H20, that's for certain.  This film is more of a step back from the step forward the previous film took.  After saying in an interview during the filming of H20 that she would not do another Halloween film for any amount of money, here's Jamie Lee Curtis is doing a cameo in the beginning.  I guess the money was too good to pass up.
Despite what the previews would lead you to believe, Curtis is not the main character of the film.  She's mainly in this one to give the Laurie Strode character a proper send off.  Unfortunately, it's not a happy ending.  The story for this Halloween movie centers around a group of kids who are doing an internet broadcast show run by Busta Rhymes' character, Freddie. The catch is that this show is being broadcast from Michael Myers' house and, of course of all days of the year, the show is being broadcast on halloween.  Once the kids are inside the house, the doors and windows are locked as they are to spend an entire night in the house.  What the kids don't know is that Michael is back home and he's not happy with his uninvited guests.  You can pretty much figure out the rest of the plot of this film.
For a Halloween film, it's not too bad.  I liked the originality of the headsets the kids had to wear that showed their points of view.  As the kids get picked off one by one, their deaths are shown from the P.O.V.s so it feels like Michael is looking right into your eyes as he kills everyone.  It does feel creepy at times.
As usual the whole cast of characters are mainly unknowns with a few celebrity cameos like Busta Rhymes' character and his girlfriend played by Tyra Banks.  You'll also see Sean Patrick Thomas (Save the Last Dance) and Thomas Ian Nicholas (American Pie) playing two potential victims in the house.
Overall, the movie isn't too bad.  If your a hardcore Halloween fan, it's right up your ally.  But if your just a casual viewer and you saw H20 you might want to skip this one.  The one gripe I have with the film is the explanation of Michael's survival from H20.  It doesn't make sense and the writers definately could've done better.  All I can say is thank God they ditched the whole cult angle from H6.  That was just too much.  Of course, as usual, the ending leaves room open for another sequel.

The lighting (or lack of) is perfect. The elements the film lacks is orginality and a suitable plot. Although the acting isn't that bad.

Why did he NOT remove the mask while he was still inside the van?  If it wasn't supposed to be Michael, then why when he (the supposed human ambulance attendant) crashed thru the windshield did he sit up in the road like Michael?  That's because in H20 it WAS Michael.  Talk about doing anything to make a fast buck.  I was absolutely disgusted by the first 15 minutes of this movie and ended up getting a refund.

Let me just start by saying it is increddibly typical, and if you're into horror with psychological depth, skip this watch Psycho, The Others, Signs, The Shining ect...Fountually for me I like both. I like psycoloical and no-brainers. My actual favorite horror is A Nightmare on Elm Street. I discuss that more later.
Okay lemme just start by saying something. There are a lot of reviews that say this is nothing compared  to the first and that it's tottaly differnt. Okay. Let me get this straight. The first one is about a dude who for some reason is killing people. Why? Because he wanna. And alot of reviews I am reading are saying this is doodoo compared to the 1st and is totally differt. Okay, in the first one he was killing people. What is he doing in this one...ooo that's a toughie....y'know what I think...yep he doing the same thing. The same thing is so differnt! (In case yer an idiot that was meant to be said in sarcasam)I will admit Jason is a ripoff of Mike, but neither I are scary. I think it is stupid how my friends will watch a slasher and after that they will get scared that a killer will be coming after them. Yea okay there is some curse on the movie that right after you watch it a killer will come after you. I will admit that has happened to me once but that's not important. I belive in a scary movie it shouldn't scare you with gore. Or making you jump. To me it is what makes you scared that your gonna jump until you do. But the true thing to me that makes a movie scary is if it scares you afterwords. If it haunts you in your sleep. I have watched alot of scary movies none of which striked me as 'SCARY.' Well one did and that was the movie ""The Shining."" (Stanley Krubick...got some issues)But anyway as I said before A Nightmare on Elm Street is my favorite, and for a reason. It is slasher. But it is an oringinal, psychological slasher. The killer doesn't only kill teens but he kills them in their dreams. Plus the killer in NOES talkes to his victims. Michale doen't do that. Never. Mike is like every typical slasher killer. If you like psycholical slahers I highly recomend Final destination. Watch it and you will know why.

This film drips with cynicism and is indicative of the current low point of the horror film.  The film is no fun, it works too hard to provide every element of a Halloween film with minimal efforts.  The acting, the writing, the loud, crashing music.
It's funny, but this film is no better than any of the direct to DVD Hellraisers that the same studio )Dimension) releases as well.
The director is Rick Rosenthal, who directed Part II.  The two films couldn't be more different.  Part II had atmosphere, it was stylish.  Resurrection is a retread, completely by-the-numbers.
The franchise will continue, despite the fact they kill off Jamie Lee, as if you didn't know.  The series died with Donald Pleasance.
And let's say nothing of the mask.  I can't understand what they've done to the mask.  It looks like a cartoon version of the Myers mask.  Is it so hard to recreate the original mask, or is it another attempt to get artistic in a slasher film?  Nothing about Michael Myers is scary.  He is clearly now the hero, killing us, and we keep coming back.

(USA - 2002)

Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Super 35)
Theatrical soundtracks: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDS

A group of teens spend the night in the derelict ruin of Michael Myers' family home as part of an Internet-based 'reality show'. But Myers himself is lurking on the premises, and he decimates them, one by one...

If HALLOWEEN H20: 20 YEARS LATER (1998) represented a giant step forward in the HALLOWEEN franchise, then Rick Rosenthal's tired sequel HALLOWEEN: RESURRECTION takes ten giant steps back again. The film's many problems stem from an ill-conceived script by Larry Brand and Sean Hood, which opens with a 'final' confrontation between Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis at her most haggard) and her murderous brother, before launching into a whole new storyline, one that fails to build on the promise of its illustrious predecessor. The scenario is wholly unconvincing and the characters are little more than cannon fodder for the rampaging killer, while the casting of rap artist Busta Rhymes as proprietor of an unlikely Internet website simply panders to audience gullibility (Rhymes does his best, but he's simply not a credible actor).

Rosenthal's participation marks his return to the series for the first time since HALLOWEEN II (1981), but while his earlier sequel was lively and atmospheric, 'Resurrection' is merely competent and uninspired, no more or less. Some of the murders are surprisingly grisly, but there's very little suspense and no memorable set-pieces, just a meandering plot which goes nowhere. The addition of a schoolboy character (Ryan Merriman) who helps the survivors of Michael's rampage by texting messages to them while watching events unfold online is quite painful to behold (and will eventually date the movie quite badly), and the film's only worthwhile sequence - in which a fake Michael Myers is confronted by the Real Thing - is resolved in an unbelievable manner.

Halloween H20 could have been great but ended up being a little ridiculous. Michael went on a road trip to California? Ha, ha!! Michael lives in HADDONFIELD!!! He doesn't go on road trips!! I could see him traveling to a different TOWN but C'mon! Also, his method of killing in H20 was more ""Scream"" than ""Myers."" Besides that with this film and H20 before it, they completely disregard the previous few films. What an insult to Donald Pleasence's work. I thought ""The Curse of Michael Myers,"" was excellent and perhaps the scariest of the lot. It also had a great character in Tommy Doyle and a good explanation of why Michael killed. Also, in Resurrection they claim the Myers house hadn't been lived in since Michael lived there. I guess that means the last few films never happened.
One more thing, thanks to Laurie Strode at the end of Part 2, Michael doesn't really have eyes. Did these producers remember that at the end of Resurrection and even in part 5? Michael is not alive. He's a walking zombie who's possessed with a curse.

The small plot thread about how Myers is alive in the first place is absolute ridiculous. At the end of ""H20"", Michael got his head lopped off by his own sister, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis). In this film, its explained that Michael killed one of the E.M.T.s, switched clothes with the dead tech, put the tech's body in the van (Laurie lopped the tech's head off instead of her brothers), and then walked off the scene unnoticed. That's all well and fine, until the film shows Michael strolling off into the woods with the tech's uniform on, complete with his halloween mask on and holding his knife! How can you not miss that! Curtis' role is very brief (it seems she only did ""Halloween:H20"" to try to end the series. Sadly, she failed). The kids in this film are very cardboard and the psycological feeling I got from watching the first ""Halloween"" is long gone. If your a fan of the first ""Halloween"" don't watch this one. Sometimes dead is better.",1078444800,,1486,4.719230769230769
1786299,1,B00006LPHA,"Ya know ... I know that saying about ""20/20 in hindsight,"" but this whole franchise really could have been awesome. It frustrates me to no end that ever since Michael Myers returned from his hiatus in Halloween III, every single movie has been plagued by wildly glaring problems of continuity.  The production team at Dimension has seemingly NEVER managed to conquer the simple task of making one movie lead into another ... until H2O.

When Jamie Lee returned to the franchise, I FINALLY thought ""OK, now we're getting somewhere.""  The character of Laurie Strode's son was introduced and played with a great deal of poise by Josh Hartnett (in one of his earlier roles).  Past problems aside, we FINALLY had some real substance to solidify the whole idea that Michael's motivation was to destroy his bloodline.

So what happens in the start of Resurrection?  Jamie Lee gets killed off and her son's character isn't reintroduced.  Right out the window, in the first fifteen minutes, was everything that H2O managed to accomplish.  So what were we left with?  I dunno, you tell me.  At this stage, Halloween has turned, pretty much, into the same movie as every other mid-to-late-eighties slasher.  After Resurrection, I'm absolutely convinced that this whole franchise, officially, has no creativity left and absolutely nothing new or interesting to offer.",1076284800,29,1355,5.085972850678733
1786310,2,B00006LPHA,Don't they realize that Halloween isn't fun anymore.  Plesence is dead and this was his series. They killed off Jamie Lee Curtis and now the two main characters are dead. They could have brought Jamie Strode back if they hadn't killed her which may have saved the series for a nineth which will be coming out soon but it will be a turkey. Seeing new people get killed in the eight part of a series is just plain old. It's not any good. History will have three great slashers. Freddy Michael and Jason but everything comes to an end. They fail to realize that. It's over can anyone accept that. When Halloween 9 comes out i'll see it at the movies but I know it will be bad. I guess we fans still love it anyway.,1075593600,3,711,4.227941176470588
1786311,3,B00006LPHA,"I'm a big Michael Myers fan from way back when, and I have to admit I was rather disappointed with this eighth entry in the hallowed Halloween series.  The whole concept of having six young people spend a night in Michael Myers' old house on Halloween night is brilliant albeit not quite original, but even this ""reality"" aspect of the film could have been improved upon.  Then you have a number of plot elements that exist for no apparent reason whatsoever, as the issues these raised initially are left blowing in the wind.  Worst of all is the beginning of the film, as it did much to ruin whatever good might follow in its wake once the filmmakers got to the new and refreshing presentation of everyone's favorite masked killer doing his thing.  It is hard to say what I mean without giving important plot elements away, so all I will say is that the opening scenes in this movie insult the intelligence of Halloween's core audience and then quickly proceed to spit upon and kick the very essence of what Halloween used to be about.  I think the opening climax is borne of a very bad decision, and the scene itself is almost laughably pathetic.  I daresay many loyal Halloween fans will share my dissatisfaction in this regard.
Once we finally get to the live Internet broadcast of the six young people inside Michael Myers' old house, the movie succeeds fairly well.  The webcam aspect of the cinematography gives this film a special look and feel, and the sudden appearances of Michael take on added effectiveness.  There is one particularly good moment wherein the sudden appearance of the white mask from out of the shadows has a vintage Frankenstein feel to it.  The killings are nothing special, and this Michael Myers really doesn't carry himself well or have an inkling of the presence he had in earlier movies, but at least the man is still taking care of business.  The characters in this film are a problem, though.  Most of them are nothing more than characters put there to be killed.  I never got any sense of what makes any of them tick.  Michael's knife can cut through anything, but this film never manages to even penetrate the surface of any major character.  Bianca Kajlich turns in a pretty good performance as Sara Moyer, and I thought Busta Rhymes was great and certainly entertaining as Freddie Harris, the man behind the web broadcast.  The other cast members aren't bad actors and actresses; they just had little to work with from the script.  Sara's character seemed to have some type of special sensitivity or psychic link of sorts to Michael early on, but that subplot goes nowhere.  Then there is Sara's Internet friend Decker.  The movie did need some outside person viewing the Internet broadcast and reacting to what he sees take place in the house, but Decker ends up becoming one of the most needless characters of all time.
On a more positive note, the DVD is loaded with extra goodies.  Besides the obligatory filmmaker commentary, you get several deleted scenes and three alternate endings (all of them as unimpressive as the actual ending), looks behind the scenes with Jamie Lee Curtis and the production designer, and a featurette on the head cam worn by the six young people in the house.  Best of all, you can view the webcam footage on its own with or without commentary.  This forty or so minutes of material, which includes a few moments not included in the film, actually plays better than the movie itself.  If the filmmakers would have gone even farther in the webcam direction, I think this movie could have been more enjoyable, although nothing could heal the wounds inflicted on Halloween loyalists in the opening moments of the film.",1072828800,22,3690,4.72386895475819

The movie sinks to new lows as it travels further down the toilet after its predacessor Halloween H2O.  The movie seems to be over influenced by todays genre of teen movies as it involves such teen idols as Busta (something).  This is one of the movies most fatal mistakes, along with heavy script flaws, since the movie is geared more towards the famous rapper than Micheal Myers.  My reccomendation for those who have seem the beginning phases of the series is to avoid this movie at any cost.  For those who are new to the series, buy Halloween the first story, or if you want a fast thriller movie for the night buy this movie.

Michael, I think was just as brutal in this one as he was in the first.  Great movie!  All in all I would rate II, H20, and Resurrection as the best sequels.  They also don't give much of Michaels past or explaining his reason for killing his sisters.  And there shouldnt be.  Reason being?

The plot didn't even make sense, Michael Myers whole deal was he wanted to kill off every person in his bloodline. Halloween:Resurrection (which isn't even accurate, who's being resurrected??!!) wasn't even about killing off his extended family.  Instead he's hiding in a house and picking off college students (whose screams aren't even worthy of horror movie status).

Second, I was dissapointed that Jamie Lee Curtis part was so short. They really advertised the film like she had a big part in it, but the small part she is in is great.
Tyra Banks didn't need to be in the movie, unless she was going to get topless. She was absoloutly useless in the movie....
Last, I am very angry that Buster Rymes was beating up Micheal Myers and winning. The directors must be really stupid if they think Micheal Myers fans want Buster to be the winner instead of our favorite(Myers).
The DVD does contain some decent extras. Check out the alternate endings and see how this movie almost became a chick horror flick. As [bad] as the real ending to this movie was, they picked the best of all the ones they shot.

During the broadcast, the midwest's most notorious denizen pops in for a homecoming, and much carnage ensues. While no one will win any academy awards here, the acting is more than adequate, and overall the film has enough genuine scares, cleverness and style to register as more than just another knock off. It's way  better than that. One last thing, many fans have complained that the explanation as to why Michael is still alive following his supposed decapitation at the conclusion of H20 is hokey. I've  been a  fan of the  ""Halloween"" series for most of my life, and I didn't think it was hokey. I thought it came across as exactly the sort of thing that The Shape would do. It is perfectly in keeping with the character, and I found it to be a relatively ingenious moment. If you're a fan of this series, you need to add this film  to your library.

Why he would even care seems to be a question better off unasked. Well, the new group of college-age victims gets it one by one as they poke fun of their surroundings and help urinate on what was once a horrifying horror movie franchise.
I'll say it again. Kevin Williamson was the worst thing to happen to Halloween. Once his ""Scream"" films became the national craze, every character in horror films had to have some hip thing to say.

They're promised that everything is totally genuine, but even this batch of ultra stupid teens aren't gullible enough not to realise they've been set up for a so-called scare-fest to drag in the equally gullible viewers.
I found Michael's presence in the house fairly plausible (if you can overlook the whole 'decapitated by his sister' thing at the end of H20). He apparently had been hiding away in a sealed off section under the house for some months. Actually, the bloodfest that follows wasn't murder. It was just dear Michael being territorial...
Sarcastic comments aside, it wasn't a bad movie in all. The best parts were the young computer hacker who guided the 'heroine' through the house, letting her know exactly where Michael was.
My biggest gripe is what they did to Jamie Lee Curtis' character. That they finally... actually, no. I won't give that away, in case anyone reads this who hasn't seen it yet. But the bottom line is that they should have left this series alone after H20. I personally love watching Laurie Strode marching up the road to the school, axe in hand, screaming her brother's name. To have her courageous actions in that movie reduced so much was a shame.

Michael Myers - or ""The Boogyman"" as he is called -  is what is evil within all of us, the ""shadow"". This is the idea brought up in the classroom scene, a scene that refers back to Halloween I (though it is more similar to the classroom scene in H2O). The idea of Michael as the evil within us could have turned out to something interesting, but it is very soon dropped and Michael is turned into a very uninteresting killing machine. As Busta Rhymes character, ""Freddie"", puts it: ""Michael Myers is a killer shark in baggy ass overalls who gets his kicks off of killing everything and everyone he comes across."" In other words, Michael is in this film nothing but a horror movie clich.
The plot is outright stupid. Six young persons are invited to explore the house of Michael Myers to find out why he turned bad, and everything they do is filmed and broadcasted on the internet. Unfortunately, Michael is still around and starts killing them one by one. In a room in a different house where some other young people have a party everything is watched on the internet. With this setup, the film naturally turns into a mix of Scream and The Blair Witch Project - we even get the classic Blair Witch shot with a girl looking down the camera with flash light in her face.
This film is for the most parts lacking what made Halloween I so enjoyable: good music (the theme is of course there and is still enjoyable) beautiful milieus, and lots of charm. Instead of memorable lines as ""It's totally dark in here"" and ""Hey, jerk! Speed kills"", we have dialogues like this:
(Two of the young people in the house are about to have sex, and the boy apparently gets turned on by clever girls)
- Say something smart!
- Existence precedes essance.
Ok, it's funny. But I don't think it's intended to be.

1786338,3,B00006LPHA,"Not very hyped up, but true hardcore Halloween fans like me hyped it up. Taking after the surprising ending of ""Halloween: H20"", Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) decapitated her evil brother, the white-masked serial killer Michael Myers. Because of her 'murder', she is now incarcarated in a sanitarium (ironically, Michael Myers was as well, after he killed Laurie's older sister years ago). The movie starts off amazing, with a compelling, intriguing storyline, but then it quickly falls into darkness. After the beginning part at the sanitarium, the plot moves back to Haddonfield, where it gets boring and stupid. Annoying young actors like Tara Reid's boyfriend from American Pie, the black guy from Save The Last Dance, and other mediocre, mostly from TV-actors have been selected to be in a MTV Fear-like show where they have to spend a night in the home of Michael Myers. Of course, Michael won't like having unexpected guests in his house, and has to deal with them.
The DVD almost makes up for the movie, with impressive video of 2.35:1, and audio of Dolby Digital 5.1. A DTS 5.1 would've been nice, too, but they didn't include it. The special features include deleted scenes, audio commentary, featurettes, behind-the-scenes look, and a special featurette on the ""cameras"" of Halloween: Resurrection. The title to the film, I found, to be misleading.
Overall a disappointing movie not worth much more than a rental. But me, I had to buy it to complete my Halloween DVD collection. Nothing so far has surpassed the original, but at least this keeps up the continuity between the 1st one, H20, and this one.",1053820800,3,1617,4.970479704797048
1786339,4,B00006LPHA,"From the title, one would think that HALLOWEEN: RESURRECTION deals with the resurrection of Michael Myers whom was supposedly beheaded in HALLOWEEN H20. Instead, this movie is more about an attempt at resurrecting the HALLOWEEN franchise for a new generation.

The movie starts off with a lengthy prologue that ties together the events of H2O. Laurie Stroud (Jamie Lee Curtis) didn't kill her brother, Michael Myers, in H2O. Instead, she mistakenly murdered someone else. For the past three years, she has been in a mental hospital, preparing herself for the day that Michael will appear again. Well, he does show up and as a result the greatest horror heroine of all time leaves the HALLOWEEN series for the final (probably) last time. With the old generation gone, it's time to start with a new crew. The rest of the film takes place in Myers childhood home where a group of young college students are hosting a Halloween web-cast. Most of them end up getting killed rather pointlessly in stupid fashion.

I was disappointed that Jamie Lee Curtis was written off. With her character gone, Michael Myers should have either hunted done her son or committed suicide. Therefore, even though it's not clear what HALLOWEEN 9 will bring, if the filmmakers are wise, they'll have Michael Myers hunting his nephew who is somehow involved with the Sarah of this movie. In that case, HALLOWEEN: RESURRECTION would be a decent side road in this never ending horror story. Otherwise, the film will be just another failed attempt at freshening something that died in H2O.",1053129600,,1559,4.9465648854961835

And what were Tyra Banks and Busta Rhymes doing in this movie? Busta Rhymes had some funny moments, but he had no business being in this film! With his kung fu karate chop antics and big mouth, he offered some comic relief, but little else.

1786342,2,B00006LPHA,"As a collector and an avid fan of these movies i have to admit being very dissapointed in this latest sequal.
I would have to rate this the worst in the series to date, and i feel most fans would agree with me there.
This movie fails to capture what the previous films had in atmosphere or any kind of decent plot line and the characters in this are awfully played out and just wish them all to be killed as soon as possible.
Lots of reasons could be that the film makers had a lot of production problems but that should not excuse the terrible script and annoying direction from Rick Rosenthal, who directed the much superior Halloween 2.
The opening 12 minites are fine, with Jamie Lee Curtis reprising the role as troubled Laurie, confronting Michael Myers in the psychiatric institute she has been commited to. These are the best moments of the entire film, although everything seems slightly rushed and poorly put together.
After the opening scenes, and the TV-like credits appear, the remaining plot revolves around 6 or so students going to Myers house to do live internet broadcast in the vain of MTVs 'Fear' or 'Big Brother'. Myers comes along and kills most of them.
That is the srotyline. Its the worst plot this series has ever had, in previous films Myers usually pursues a family member and dost just simply kill random people for no reason whatsoever, which i think makes this movie pointless. Its more like watching Friday The 13th.
The characters are so ... annoying i wish they were all killed from the start, and Busta Rhymes is the most annoying of them all along with some blonde girl named Jen who just repulses the viewer with her awful acting.
Another complain is the use of internet cams, which whilst maybe inventive, i found it irritating and annoying.
The ending is diabolical, and with some college kids all tuned in at a seperate house cheering on the sole survivor from the internet, this is obviously aimed at a younger audience then previous Halloween films.
The above mention scenes are farcial and plain embarrasing from a fans view, and really makes a mockery of what has been a great series.
There will be a Halloween 9, i will buy it, but i hope they go back to basics and take more time then they did on this one.",1050796800,2,2252,4.562962962962963
1786343,2,B00006LPHA,"What can be said about this chapter? First of all, this movie is not for horror fans. Instead, it's for the ones who don't see them much because they get nervous and jumpy really easily. When there is absolutely nothing on the screen to scare you, why does the music make you think there is? (Other then to try and tease you, which I never bought) It seems like the viewer is expected to be scared just because they're watching a horror movie, and this movie plays on that endlessly.
Then there's the extreme lack of originality:
It starts with the typical opening scene used to show the ""insanity"" of the killer (only then followed by the title of movie)
Then there the pointless, out of place, false scares and failed attempts at disturbing violent scenes.
A recycled script makes a character (who we thought was just recently killed) come back to save the day with amazing ability...  followed by the sequel permitting ending
Stereotypical isn't it? ""Halloween:Ressurection"" was not boring, it just didn't acheive anything. I saw right through it all and was not convinced.
Does anyone even still care for it's main theme? Does it even scare anybody? It really doesn't embellish anything here... just adds to the word ""attempt"".",1050710400,,1231,4.806603773584905

1786345,1,B00006LPHA,"One of the less scary horror movies of all time, as well as one of the worst movies in history. After we see it we understand why Jamie Lee Curtis asked to be quickly killed. She must have had it, must have been disgusted after she read the script... Now the Myers house, supposed to be haunted, or at least with a bad, deadly reputation, is used for a TV reality show - what an imagination! Stupid, in fact. Of course the (young, of course, and as unconscious as possible) participants get killed one after another, as we expected and as they had no intelligence to expect (how do they do that?). No surprise at all. So surpriseless that when it happens, we can't do nothing but say to ourselves ""Well done, Mike, go on!"" and ask for more.
Too bad there's no zero rate on the scale, because some movies deserve such a rate, and ""Halloween: Resurrection"" is among them. Let's hope there won't be no ""Resurrection 2""... Of course Carpenter, who didn't direct any sequel of his cult film, didn't get involved in this, we can understand him. Just let them bury themselves!",1049760000,3,1069,4.487179487179487
1786346,1,B00006LPHA,"I have been a total fan of all of the Halloween series for many years now, collecting the set on VHS, before the advent of DVD and now have the set also on DVD.  Because of this, I'm very familiar with the plot lines and although I have my favourites (I won't mention them here, after all, we all have different tastes right?) I would have to say that all movies in the series have their own particular merits.  I and II in the series are special (in particular I) and I quite like the III episode in many ways.  In addition, the following IV, V and VI episodes are interesting, along with the latest H2O feature.  All are good and (sometimes) bad in various places, but we love them just the same.
However, I have to say that I cannot find ANYTHING good to say about Halloween Resurrection.  It is so bad that it is embarassing!  I am in the UK where it had only a nominal cinema release (which I didn't get to see) and also no formal DVD release.  Upon getting hold of a region 1 copy I was all ready and excited to live the next chapter in the Halloween series.  All the thoughts were going through my head....how can they continue when Michael was killed in H2O...is Laurie Strodes life back on track again now.....etc.  What did I get?  I pressed play and waited.....
What occurred over the next 90 or so minutes was probably one of the worst and least frightening horror movies I have ever seen in my life.  It is so poor that it made me cringe at various points in the film.  I understand that the people behind the scenes wanted to bring Michael Myers into the 21st century, but this made the movie lose all of the charm and atmosphere that made the original so creepy and spooky.
People are saying that you have to be a REAL fan of the Halloween series to enjoy this one...I would say that it is the COMPLETE OPPOSITE!  Real fans of the series would realise immediately that this is a poorly scripted, storyless, badly acted piece. I think that to enjoy the movie in any way you would need to have no particular fondness of the original series whatsoever.",1049155200,6,2064,4.316062176165803
1786347,3,B00006LPHA,"The title ""Halloween - Resurrection"" has an ironic dimension because at face value you would think it has to do with bringing back the character of Michael Myers from the dead, since he was killed by his sister, Laurie (Jamie Leigh Curtis) at the end of ""Halloween H20: 20 Years Later.""  But actually what they are trying to revive here is the ""Halloween"" franchise.  This 2002 film is a sequel to 1998 film, which makes it the eighth film in the series, which is a bit misleading because ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"" had nothing to do with the rest of the series and movies four through six were completely ignored in the last two films (at least I think that they were) to explain the return of Laurie Strode.  This also helps to explain the return of Rick Rosenthal as director, who directed ""Halloween II,"" the original sequel in all this fun.
""Halloween - Resurrection"" offers a rather lengthy prologue, the purpose of which is to effectively reset the Michael Myers story.  The result is that I have not been so ticked off at the opening of a movie since ""Alien 3"" undid one of my all time favorite movies (""Aliens"") by the end of the title credits.  A similar affrontery is provided in this film, and, no, I do not buy the idea this is simply an homage to the beginning of ""Friday the 13th Part 2.""  Anyhow, this film ends up starting off with one foot in the grave by opening with such a complete downer.
What is prologue is past when we get to the actual story of the film.  At this point as an audience you simply need to have the same level of knowledge as the characters: what Michael Myers did in the first two ""Halloween"" films.  The initial premise of the story is the old chesnut about a group of people who agree to spend the night in a haunted house, the brainchild of Freddie Harris (Busta Rhymes).  In this case we are talking about six college students and the house in question is the Myers house in Haddonfield, Illinois, where Michael killed his sister Judith on Halloween night in 1963.  But this particular old chesnut is provided with a 21st century twist: all of those young kids on the dinner menu are going to be wired with web-cams.  There are additional cameras all over the Myers house.  This is because this entire experience is going to be shown on the Internet.
This makes ""Halloween - Resurrection"" something of a meta-film experience, because eventually we are watching the kids at the party who are watching the kids at the Myers house being sliced and diced by Michael.  Of course despite all the cameras and monitors nobody notices that anybody is being killed (those watching on the Internet just assume it is part of the show--at least at first).  But in the end, all that technology might just make it possible for one of these kids to make it out alive.  You would have thought that all this technology would make for a badly needed infusion of creativity into a slasher flick like this, but you would be mistaken.  The point here is simply to add another level of voyeurism to the experience.  The assumption is the audience can relate to this, which would explain why there are characters in this film who think having sex in this house while being watched on the Internet is a good thing.  The fact this is an above average entry in the series speaks to the general shlock of the genre more than the relative quality of this film.
Final Comment:  We understand now that Michael Meyer's driving goal from the very beginning is to kill his sisters.  He gets Judith in the beginning of ""Halloween"" and spends most of the rest of the films in the ""official"" quartet trying to get Laurie.  My assumption has always been that if he were to get to that point something significant would happen.  Apparently not...",1049068800,,3762,4.525849335302807

My personal opinion is that once Donald Pleasence passed on they should of just stopped and should of left the Halloween legacy where it is, but as you can see they continued. Although this movie did have some perks, like Jamie Lee Curtiss, they all died quickly, just like what the Halloween series will do soon if they keep on going like this.

After that insulting opening sequence, the movie drops all the threads from any previous ""Halloween"" entry and shifts the focus to a group of people picked to spend a night in the Myers home, ala Reality TV style.  The basis of the ""Halloween"" series, which is Michael killing off his bloodline, is completely ignored in favor of braindead characters, God-awful acting (Busta Rhymes, his teeth, and Tyra Banks are the main offenders), and predictable chase sequences. Sadly, this DVD also has the most extra features of the ""Halloween"" series so far.  Features include a boring commentary with Director Rick Rosenthal, three short featurettes, rightfully-so deleted scenes, and alternate endings.  Oddly, some of the more anticipated deleted scenes (home video footage of Michael Myers and Laurie Strode as children that was to run under the opening credits; alternate opening scene with Curtis; an alternate end to Tyra Banks' character) were all left out.

1786353,5,B00006LPHA,"I find it shocking how many sequels have followed the classic 78' thriller ""Halloween."" The first two films were more than enough to tell the gruesome story of serial killer Michael Myers, who murdered his sister Judith at age 6, and broke out of the asylum years later to continue his deadly spree. While the sequels were fun, they lacked logic. The plot contained more holes than swiss cheese, and the 7th film ""Halloween H20"" even went so far as to forget all the films that came before it. Such a shame when something so small yet so important ruins the pure enjoyment of a mindless film.
That said, the latest entry in the popular slasher series also manages to ignore all but the Jamie Lee Curtis installments of all the films. Who cares that Michael Myers is now so old he will probably need to use a walking cane to make it across the room. His murders are as deadly and gruesome as ever.
Add to that a top-notch cast which include Busta Rhymes, Tyra Banks, Ryan Merriman, Sean Patrick Thomas, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Bianca Kajlich, and, of course, the return of Jamie Lee Curtis, a refreshingly different plot from the previous entries, and pure suspense from start to finish, and you have one of the best sequels in the ""Halloween"" Saga.

1786369,4,B00006LPHA,"So what do filmakers do to keep the Halloween franchise going? They try new ways of exploring an all familiar theme. It can be very difficult to like this film considering there is a string of other ones (of much the sameness) to compare it to. However, if you look at this film for its own merits you will see it is actually a well directed, stylish and thrilling take on an ongoing saga.
Rick rosenthal from Halloween II is once again at the helm in this sequel. Much like H2 This film begins with some sequences that appear as a homage to H2. We are following the viewpoints of the villian as he chases Laurie strode down hospital corridors and onto the roof top for some suprising conflict resolution. In the first 12 minutes Rosenthal uses shadow, colour and sound as an affective way of building suspense. Curtis, despite giving a short performance, actaully makes the viewer wish that perhaps this sequence was a little longer as the integrity of the story owed much to the tension between the Strode character and that of Myers.
The rest of the film takes the story back to the myers house for a new take on halloween. Here are some crazy Blair witch video angles and some nasty frights to entertain the viewer, but, don't expect startling plot revelations like in the original or H2. What works here is Rosenthal juices up the Myers character by giving him much more scenes, newer ways of being viewed(points of perspective), and has the new actor playing myers develop a body gesture throughout the film that is both frightening and a little creepy, thusly, keeping with the established style of one and two. In fact Myers has been given so much personality in this film (despite being mute)it makes the(at times)bland acting of the other actors seem forgivable. Now its is interesting to note that if the deleted scenes were indeed included in the theatrical release the character developments would have been more interesting. Fortunately the DVD version has these scenes in the special features menu. If you can piece the deleted scenes back into the film you would find this a more convincing flick.
What also works in this sequel is there is clever homages to Halloween 1, 2, and H20 as Rosenthal manages to give us some action and suspense sequences remiscent of ones that seemed to work in the other Halloween films. This kind of self reflexivity is cool! Did I mention the music. It contains the familiar Carpenter music, mixed in with some violins that sound like screaming cats, still, its effective( But, I thought the orchestral version in H20 was better).Do buy this film for excellent direction and cinematography. Also buy if You want a more creepy portrayal of Myers. I would have given this film five stars if not for two reasons: 1. loses half  a star for getting rid of the films most crucial character. and 2. loses half a star for not establishing the new heorines role thoroughly. Despite this see the film for a clever and stylish thrill. Bring on another sequel!",1043193600,6,2996,4.695817490494297

This movie is about a sereial killer who is back in his hometown and this time kills 6 visitors or teenagers who were going to spend the night in his childhood home. Only one was left and she came out alive. The end was so scary. My favorite or the part that scared me the most was when Micheal Myers chopped of a blond girl's head and that head rolled from the stairs. This movie was so scary that I barely got any sleep.

The story for this one is simple Michael Myers returns to his house while a live webcating base is filming their and Michael gets a little knife happy.

Movie was edited down to 89 minutes in movie theaters in Canada and United Kingdom.
Directed by Rick Rosenthal.
  Horrible ""Halloween"" entry and sequel to Halloween H2O (1998).  The start of this 8th film, and the fourth with Jamie Lee Curtis, looked promising, but alas, her role ended too quick and the demise of the strong character of ""Laurie Strode"" is unacceptable to me.  After this, the movie becomes too ridiculous.  (Not the end of ""Laurie Strode"". Wait until 2018).

  Very predictable and did not scare me a bit.

Who the hell wants to see a bunch of annoying teenagers who can't act partying for an  hour and a half. I didn't even like the guy who played Michael Myers.  He looked to small.

1786409,3,B00006LPHA,"I have been an enormous fan of all the Halloween movies for a long time now. I first saw the original Halloween at a relatively young age, and it not only impacted me profoundly, but also scared the heck out of me. Following all the sequels, I went to see Halloween H20 in theaters on opening weekend, and although it wasn't what I wanted it to be (betraying the storyline really fried me) it gave closure and ended the series on a high-note. Needless to say, the moment I found out Halloween 8 was on the way, I was more than skeptical. My suspicions were even more aroused when the movie was not playing in any local theaters, which made me worry that this film was really going to be a stinker, but, I digress. Being the Myers' enthusiast I am and having not seen this movie, I grabbed this DVD the day it came out. It was a bittersweet moment sitting down and popping this in. On one hand, Mikey is back in action and has been sorely missed by yours truly, but on the other hand, this is a series that was supposed to end four years ago, and is now being dragged back into the never-ending sequel land. From the blatantly underwhelming opening credits, I could tell that this wasn't going to be a film of high standards, so I lowered my bar, turned my mind to Friday the 13th mode, and just swallowed it. Now, the movie gets off on the right foot. Laurie Strode is re-introduced and just as quickly dispatched ever so gracefully and dramatically. But wait, Michael Myers? Didn't he get his head lopped off in the last movie? Why yes he did, but this is a movie, and any script doctor could have filled this gap. I won't bother explaining how it happened, because if you haven't seen it yet, you probably already know what happens. Logic defies this explanation (paramedics never go onto a scene alone; why would 'the paramedic' attack Laurie in the van?).  I guess they just had to find some way to bring him back, for sequel's sake, but really, I would have settled for writing Michael off as a copy-cat killer in H20. So, after you can get over this enormous plot-hole and after Laurie Strode is finished off, the real story begins. The plot: A group of college-students are chosen to spend a night in the old Myers' house as part of an internet event being held on Halloween night. Each student gets a wealthy scholarship and even a chance to be famous. Busta Rhymes plays Freddy, the man behind all of this. Busta Rhymes really saves this movie. I know a lot of people hated his part, but I thought he did great with it. His scenes with Michael Myers were some of the most memorable since the closet scene in the original (Busta Rhymes dressed as Michael Myers got more than a few chuckles out of me). Rick Rosenthal, director of Halloween II, returns to the helm and does a stellar job of directing it. Visually, this movie is one of the high-points of the series, even the web-cam stuff came out surprisingly great. But the part that severly drags this movie down is the script. There is really no story. I could have written better than this. Also, the whole subplot of the people at the Halloween party watching the event on WebTV was obviously just put in there to fill space. You will notice some relatively big names in this movie, but before you can recognize them, they are slaughtered. Really, everyone here is just morgue meat. The DVD itself is excellent, being one of the best Dimension has ever put out. We get Director's Commentary, an ""On-The-Set"" montage with Jamie Lee Curtis, two web-cam featurettes, a tour of the set, a wealth of deleted scenes and three (count 'em, three) alternate endings (and there's even more). Whew!

So, overall, after this lengthy review, my summary is this: Halloween Resurrection is a very unnecessary addition to the Halloween series. With Donald Pleasance gone, and Laurie Strode's character dead, there is simply no story to tell anymore. I feel this movie sinking into Friday the 13th territory, where the movies are just vehicles for horny teenagers to be slaughtered (Nothing wrong with that, but Halloween was always ABOVE that). I think they would have been better off leaving H20 as the ending, and I also fear that when they actually decide to do a real finale, no one will care anymore.",1040601600,16,4253,4.536458333333333

While wholly unimaginative, ""Halloween: Resurrection"" manages to hold on to a shred of decency in its structure and ideas.  The idea of filming it a la reality-series style is amusing in style, and allows and otherwise cookie-cutter slasher film to seem different.  The kills are extremely boring, unfortunately, and it seems the writers could not come up with an extermination method better than a knife.  Impaled on gate?  Done.  ""Nailed"" to door with knives?  Done.  Stabbed?  Over-done.  Electrocution, hangings, and hand-crushes are all trotted out the same way.  While Michael Meyers can't be without his staple knife, its usage could have been more varied.
I will admit that I was surprised by some of the twists the movie brought to the fore.  The manipulation of the contestants by the producers is a nice touch adding an element of ""is this real?"" to the flick.
The opening scene, standing on its own and never addressed again, is chilling in its execution.  The character of Laurie Strode never looked so... pointless.  Jamie Lee will be missed; she brought a touch of class to all four instalments she was in.
Character development reaches a whole new low.  Every character is given so little time to develop we aren't even given a caricature of a character!  Once the killings start we are unable to tell which character is going to live until a few are knocked off.  The ..., careless people are bopped off first.  They may as well have been papier-mch people.
Otherwise, if you're looking for a mildly entertaining slasher film with comforting familiarity, check this one out.  And if you don't, you know you're going to see it just to justify complaining about it.",1040601600,,1884,4.920634920634921

The web cast, and the help that Sara gets via her palm pilot, was an ingenious touch.  Speaking of Sara, seems to me that she could possibly be a long-lost Myers family member, hopefully so as she fit in well with the story.  Is Laurie gone for good ?  Never say never in a Halloween story, but it wouldn't be impossible to bring her back.  Most of the remaining cast was just filler, with the exceptions of Tyra Banks (for obvious reasons), and Busta Rhymes, who I felt did a great job in his role.  He played it the way it should have been, as a mogul looking to get his brand noticed.

1786422,3,B00006LPHA,"HALLOWEEN: RESURRECTION (2002)
Being a horror fan, I found Halloween: Resurrection to be quite disappointing. This definitely surprised me because when it comes to movies I'm usually not too hard to please. Unfortunately, I even found it hard to enjoy this purely on an entertainment level. Its flaws were just too big to ignore.
Other than Sara (Bianca Kajlich), the characters are basically just throwaways that range from stupid to annoying to stupid and annoying. This is certainly not a good combination, even if we are used to seeing them in countless other horror flicks. You know who's going to die from the minute they appear on the screen, and being that you just don't give a damn about these characters it's hard to care when they finally do bite the knife. Michael Myers is a cool horror villain but watching him kill one annoying character after another just isn't as much fun as it sounds, it actually gets a little boring.
It's really sad what a badly edited mess this turned out to be. It's also too short, which might actually be a good thing considering the final product, but being that not much happens during the movie I would have liked it to have been a bit longer. I could almost cry over what an unworthy sequel this became. I was expecting quite a bit from it but not even my lowest expectations were met.
The acting was pretty mediocre all around, with the best coming from Bianca Kajlich and the worst from Katee Sackhoff. Now it's not that her performance was that bad, but her similarities to Tori Spelling were enough to send chills up my spine. From her looks to her acting, Katee Sackhoff could be Tori Spelling's twin, in fact, if I didn't know any better, I'd think it was Tori Spelling. Also, Tyra Banks really got on my nerves. The characters that her and Busta Rhymes play have got to be two of the worst reality show hosts ever. They never pay attention to anything that's going on which left me yelling at the screen.
Overall, Halloween: Resurrection does nothing but continue the trend of making a scary villain un-scary. Maybe the next Halloween should concentrate more on atmosphere than death scene after death scene. It's not that this can't be cool or anything, but it's just not that exciting when you've seen it a million times before. Anyway, despite its bad editing and numerous plot holes, Halloween: Resurrection is still an ok way to kill some time. It certainly looks great and has some of the best cinematography I've ever seen in a slasher flick. As a Halloween sequel it's certainly a disappointment, but if you're able to ignore its many flaws then you may just enjoy it. All I can say is better luck next time.

1786423,2,B00006LPHA,"FRIDAY THE 13TH 10. And now HALLOWEEN 8. This really isn't that bad a movie. RESURRECTION is directed by Rick Rosenthal who also directed HALLOWEEN 2. This time Michael Myers is back after breaking into the mental asylum where his sister Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) has been incarcerated for the last five years. The movie actually starts out pretty well, but sorry to say it folks, but this time around, Mikey succeeds in killing his sister. (Either Jamie Lee isn't getting too many movie offers nowadays or she got a big fat paycheck for her ""cameo""). Meanwhile at the rundown Myers house a film crew has set up a voyeuristic internet show where a group of people stay in the house on the anniversary of the murders. Little do they know; Michael is not an urban legend (duh!) and he is heading home for Halloween....
There is a lot more blood and gore (and sex) than the decidedly tame H20, but the franchise is obviously on its last legs (What can you say about a movie where rapper Busta Rhymes gets more screen time than Curtis?)and viewers should be spared the possibility of another HALLOWEEN movie. At least with the FRIDAY THE 13TH series viewers pretty much have low expectations anyway. This isn't the worst in the series (HALLOWEEN 3 easily wins that title) but you've seen it all before.

There were gasps, and even boos, as Michael Myers' head was chopped off, signaling an end (?) to his murderous rampage.  But it wasn't over, as the recap at the beginning of ""Halloween: Resurrection"" shows us.  Mikey is still alive, and wait till you see how he survived.
The opening to this film is bittersweet as Jamie Lee's Laurie Strode character has her final showdown with her evil brother.  And her final words?  Wow!  Too bad the cleverness had to end after this.
In true horror cliche fashion, you have your usual group of dopey teenagers (and one smart one) who buy into some silly gruesome scheme for either money, exposure, sex, or to fulfill their own morbid fantasies.  This time around, a media mogul played painfully by Busta Rhymes enlists curious kids to stay in Mikey's childhood home, equipped with head cams that broadcast their adventures live on the Internet.  Things turn sinister (and ultimately predictable and boring) when Mikey shows up and starts slaying them.
So, nothing new to add to the horror genre.  Perhaps the masterminds behind the series should have stopped with ""H20.""  This installment is not AS BAD as ""Jason X,"" but it's not very good either.  The actors are hollow and annoying, the dialogue is cheesy, and the promising premise is poorly-executed.  If they allow Mikey to come back (and that is still a possibility, again in true horror cliche fashion), they need to try harder to scare us.",1039910400,,1508,4.8023255813953485

Even Michael Myers doesn't seem to care about the element of surprising his victims in this new installment. He doesn't even stay hidden for very long, before he kills again, and again, and again! Halloween H20 was the perfect ending for this series. My wife and I were staring at each other at the end of Halloween Resurrection in disbelief that we actually sat through the whole movie.

I had to give it another look. I'm glad I did. The premise is that 6 kids spend Halloween night in the Myer's house for a ""Dangertainment"" reality web-cast. Viewers get to see ""only what the contestants see"" through cameras attached to their clothes. A good bit of the movie is seen in this view point, on the screen of another group, watching at a party. This is what spoiled it for me at first. Between the view and the dark, it's hard to make out some of what is happening. However, there is PLENTY of suspense, and rap star Bust-A-Rhymes is hilarious as the creator of the web cast. (Look for a scene where he unknowingly confronts Michael, dressed as Michael!) I did not like the fact that Lori Strode was finally killed, though. In H2O, she kind of filled a void left by the death of Donald Pleasence. Now that she's gone,I think it's time to put this one to rest. Jason X did a MUCH BETTER JOB of reviving the Friday The 13th series and giving it a fresh start.",1039564800,,1140,4.306976744186047

It was nice to see Jamie Lee Curtis back again (for what will most likely be the last time, *sniff!*) although it was disappointing that after all she's gone through to escape and defeat Michael, her end ultimately comes from a stupid mistake on her part. Laurie, a word of advice: when a masked guy walks through the door to your asylum room (and I mean *through* the door---crash!) and chases you up to the roof with a big giant knife, it's a fair bet he's your evil brother. You don't need to reach out trying to pull his mask off to make sure.
Moving on the the rest of the film...the web site angle, with everyone in the house wearing head cams, did make the film very visually interesting, if a bit wobbly at times. It was a different premise. The film hints around a bit that something was unusual about Sara (she screams and a bowl explodes at the web show preview) but that never really went anywhere.
I give ""Halloween: Resurrection"" 3 stars and recommend it to devoted fans of the series. If they *had* to make another one, this wasn't such a bad #8.",1039564800,,1166,4.427906976744186

1786434,3,B00006LPHA,"It is good that they ended the Laurie Strode chapter because otherwise this movie would not be worth checking into.  Halloween at this point has become a dull slasher series.  Teh last good halloween in fact was Curse of Michael Myers (#6).  H20 was complete garbage and for all intensive purposes almost kills the series.  This rejuvinates some energy but throws that away with cheap effects, bad acting, and poor characters.  There was no care at all for the moronic teens that got involved in ""Dangertainment"" and to be quite frankly they could of easily have replaced Michael Myers with some one else, throw out the first 10 minutes, and you would still have the same idea.
Now the first ten minutes that is a completely different manner.  It is these 10 minutes that makes the movie well worth watching (or watching that and then stop).  The first 10 minutes is full of true suspense and even a little drama as Laurie Strode bites the big one.
Overall the only reason this gets 3 stars is because of the first 10 minutes, other than that you have a typial slasher flick that tries to be scary but can't.  My advise is to end the series, or continue the story from 4-6, now that Laurie is dead there should be some closer there and then the series ends.  Otherwise it is MIchael slicing and dicing teens so he can hang with the likes of Jason, the Scream guy, and every other cheap horror icon out there.  Halloween is no longer scary adn needs to end (I would recomend going hokey but that would make this particular series worse, Jason can get away with that, Michael can't).",1039132800,4,1581,4.515789473684211

Her Brother Mike Meyers shows up and of course, Jamie Lee has to die, kind of like Sigourney Weaver in Alien 3.  Now if these people were SMART..., you could have made a SEVEN (Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt) type  of a movie, where Jamie Lee gets chase throughout the films and, at the very last moment right before she escapes, Mike Myers kills her and then roll credits.

Obviously, everyone would still be sleeping with not one, but both eyes open at night if they left it hanging after part one. I also think that Laurie didn't have the right part in this movie. It would have seemed more fitting for Dr. Loomis to have been in the opening scene instead of Laurie (if, of course, he were still alive.) But anyway, I do believe that the writing was poor. And the characters were introduced for probably this one movie anyway. They needed to bring back Tommy (Paul Rudd) Cause he still has the Michael's...whatever the baby is to him. The best part of this movie is probably Busta Rhyme's comic encounter inside the house. I won't spoil anything cause it really is classic and hilarious.
If you aren't familiar with the series, stay away from this one. Most fans are disgusted and the only reason I like the movie, is because that Myers kid still has that thing about him..",1037491200,2,1100,4.41871921182266

There are a few ""smart"" and good things ... in the beginning Michael cleverly frames someone else for Lauries murder yet he puts someones head in a dryer? The chopping off of heads (2 in this one) is..., and seeing Michael chop off a head - what a poor shot. THen yes in part one it was a great stalker flick but in this one he is ""hiding in the shadows"" for like 50 minutes and then just kinda pops out in front of everyone which defeats the purpose...(spoiler ahead) The house is tiny yet no one hears Michael come through the mirror? Rick Rosenthal did a poor job. The films are no longer following a family tree so I have no clue on where they are going from here - John Strode won't be back but in a coupl of years he could have a kid or two that come back to visit there never before seen grandpa in Haddonfield?

But it was a fun, enjoyable and sometimes scary horror simple flick.
It was known that this movie wasn't going to be a masterpiece, but it is a cool fun movie.
Why Jamie Lee? why?, you know what I mean. Why is she dead?.Why did the kill her?, It was the Halloween main charachter.
Well, the story is about a group of six teenagers(Sarah, Donna, Jenn, Jim, Rudy and Bill) selected to be part of a new Reality show called DANGERTEINMENT.
The six stupid teens will have to be a whole day in Michael Myers's house.
But what the don't know is that Michael is back and he's angry.
What I liked of this slasher flick was the cast. It was a really cool cast: Jamie Lee(The scream queen), Busta Rhymes(Very funny), Bian Kajlich(The new scream princess), Tyra Banks(VERY GOOD LOOKING, BUT VERY BAD ACTING), Thomas Ian Nicholas(The only normal guy from the American Pie folks), Seann Patrick Thomas(The dancer from Save the last dance) and the beautiful, funny and charmin Jenna(The blonde girl), she was so cute.
This is the best done Halloween(But not the best of all), the music is perfect, it's scary and deep.
The special effects are really cool. Michael's mask is really scary too. The kills are very well done and some of them were very clever. And the begining of the film was the best of all the Halloween movies.
Rick Rosenthall is an excellent director(He also directed Halloween 2, my favourite), he knows his job.
Resurrection is a rainy night funny to watch with friends flick. It is a great movie to eat popcorn and fans won't be disapointed.

1786452,3,B00006LPHA,"Considering this is the eighth movie in a tired movie series that has admittadly been reinvented with the recent H20 film, it does have some great bits and some bits that just ruin the film completely.
The first ten minutes just sets the film off perfectly. It is exciting and once again shows Michael Myers pursuing his sister, Laurie played once again by Jamie Lee Curtis, the best character / actress in the whole film. This time he succeeds. After the entire series more or less establishing the ongoing battle between the brother and sister and her dispatching her brother in H20, which seemed like the final time, she herself falls prey to his knife in the first ten minutes!! The ending of H20 is explained very well, with Michael crushing a cops Larynx at the crime scene and replacing his own body with his victims.
Sadly, after the first scene, it all goes downhill. We are introduced to characters we don't want to meet. Stupid, silly teenagers screaming, running round, acting stupid and telling jokes when they are aware that death is something that could be imposed at anytime. Comedy and horror just doesnt work sometimes! This film gives us a hack and slash saga with no propper storyline to go with it. Just endless killing with no lovable characters or relationships.
The plot is that a group of teenagers have an internet investigation, exploring Michaels house, that looks more like the original, rather than the disastrous effort made in part five. They all get dispatched one by one and the two remaining characters manage to survive with an unbelievable internet 'friend' telling them just where Michael is in the house. Probably the lowest point in the movie is a fight scene between Busta Rhymes and Michael, where the rapper resorts to kung fu. It just has 'pathetic' written all over it. Maybe if the film adopted a style like the fantastic British big brother style movie 'my little eye', after the Laurie scene, this would have been very scary and a much more original sequel, if it was done right.
With the Laurie storyline at a close, the future for the halloween series looks pretty bleak, with a predictable line up of teenage scream rip off sequels that manage to be worse than part three, four five and six. With Michael waking up in the morgue after being burned at his house, it just cries out 'lets make a sequel' but theres nothing worthy left to pursue.
Why this couldn't be the last Halloween film after all (if the makers were so insistant on a sequel) with Michaels body disappearing from the end crime scene and coming after Laurie at the end, i'll never know. Then she could have dispatched of him once and for all, or killed herself along with him. Does the cash incomes have anything to do with it??
Its a very average movie, that isn't the strongest or weakest halloween movie. But the first scene definately made this movie for me, and i would recommend it to anyone that enjoys the halloween series.
My main complaints were that Laurie was dispatched in such a quick and simple way, completely destroying the message of H20, and that such stupid characters filled the movie from that moment on. The Laurie v Michael storyline was the thing that attracted most fans, with that in the past, theres not much left to attract me to this series.
This is a worthy addition to the series, after it includes a great confrontation between Laurie and Michael, along with the original, part two and H20. Apart from these, ignore the rest of the series. They create rubbish and cheap tv characters with an unbelievable connection to Michael, when Jamie Lee Curtis obviously wasn't available.
H20 should have been the end. If this film's events was in reverse order with Michael really dying, then it would have been alot better. Believe me.
The Jamie Lee Curtis cameo makes this part a worthy addition and a watchable movie, and shes just in the first ten minutes. It just doesnt say much for the rest of the movie.",1036022400,,3952,4.687769784172662
1786453,2,B00006LPHA,"Okay, I'll try to be balanced here. This movie was terrible. I know a lot of people were disappointed in H20 because it is far too similar stylistically to the post-Scream slasher movies, and some because it abandons the storyline of Halloweens 4-6. However, I think that was the correct thing to do seeing as the wider audience is far more familiar with the Jamie Lee Curtis story, which showed in the box office for H2O.
So, three years later, plus an extra one because of production problems, we have Resurrection. And was it worth the wait? Absolutely not. And here's why!
The Jamie Lee Curtis cameo was the most ill-conceived idea since they killed off James T. Kirk in a cameo in Star Trek: Generations. We had 20 years and three movies of build-up to the event that was motivating this killer, and they deliver the most insulting anti-climax since the aforementioned demise of one starship captain. And what's worse, it's the best 10 minutes of this movie. I don't lay this blame entirely with one party, because what was an ill-conceived idea was then filmed very badly by Rick Rosenthal, and then edited even more slopily in post production. Jamie Lee Curtis should have used her contracted obligatory appearance for something much more  useful, like having Myers searching for her the whole movie and then she appears at the end. That would have worked much better. Besides which, Laurie's 'death' is highly ambiguous, given that she is stabbed once and falls from the roof, landing softly on the tree tops. I must admit, that is perhaps the best shot of the movie, but it doesn't totally convince you of anything really. After all, look at dear old Dr Loomis. He burned, he was thrown through a window, he was stabbed, he had a fatal heart attack, and then something incoherent happens to him at the end of H6. And you KNOW he would have been in H2O if Donald Pleasance were still alive.
Anyway, moving along... to the score, or rather, to an acceptable version of John Carpenter's classic theme (although how many more 'variations' on that I can take, I don't know). I struggled to pick out any decent new cues throughout the entire film, or to be more accurate, any cues at all! Not a good sign. They might as well have just replaced it with some of Marco Beltrami's score from Scream, as they did in H20.
Basically, there is just no point to this story. The reality TV/internet broadcast thing is two years past its sell by date, besides which it was done much better in  My Little Eye this year. It completely undermines the whole story behind the Halloween movies, whether you prefer the H1,2,4,5,6 or H1,2,H2O,8 path. After finally dispensing with his sister (until H40!) all he seems to do is a spot of housework.
And cutting past the chase to the denouement, Resurrection also has perhaps the [worst] final scene in the whole series. At least the mess at the end of H6 left you wondering what...had happened. Not Resurrection. No, sir...",1036022400,9,2956,4.671785028790787

1786455,5,B00006LPHA,"Having gone to see Halloween: Resurrection last night at the cinema, I was unsure what to expect. The Halloween movies are some of my favourite films (except part 3) and I particularly enjoyed H20 as it was very suspensful rather than gory. I have to say Resurrection definitely surpasses H20 and most of the other sequels. It has some clever elements to it, particularly the Blair Witch side of the film which makes it freaky as you are following the victims around the house.
Michael Myers' mask seemed more freaky to watch and it was clever how they explained it was the wrong guy Laurie killed at the end of H20. Myers' character changed at the beginning of the film, as he went head to head for the final time against his long suffering sister Laurie, as she tried to kill him on the roof and he manipulated her which leads to a shocking beginning and I thought it was clever of Michael Myers to do this, showing a more human side.
But anyways, besides a few corny lines and Busta Rhymes getting injured but never dying (damn it), definitely brilliant and I'll be buying the DVD.",1035590400,5,1084,4.50761421319797
1786456,1,B00006LPHA,"I have to say how disappointed I was in this the 8th installment of the Halloween series.  Halloween is by far the best horror flick ever made.  The first installment continues to scare me today, even after having first seen it in 1978.  This sequal [ruins] the whole Michael Myers series.  The whole premise of Michael Myers was that he wanted to kill his sister or relatives. ... The plot of the movie is lame and the actors are wasting their talents on a franchise that deserves much better. ... I was very much disappointed in the Halloween franchise, which was up to this point my favorite horror flick.  They would have done well enough to leave H20 as the final chapter.  Do not resurrect this one.  It is horrible!",1035417600,9,722,4.507692307692308
1786457,5,B00006LPHA,"I thought Jason X was good.  Jason X is the kind of horror movie that we can luagh at.  I'll admit, it was scary but Halloween: Resurrection was a lot better!  This movie is scary, but although the plot is a little wierd it is still good.
The saga finally goes to a new kind of plot.  Original character Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is finally dispatched in the the first 10 minutes of the movie by her insane brother.  So no longer will Micheal Myers be chasing after her or any other family members or have any conflict with Dr. Loomis (whose character was put to an end in Halloween 6) or any of the original characters except Tommy Doyle who I think they should bring back again.
The new plot is mainly about 6 college students being offered the american dream- fame and fortune.  There is a catch though- they need to spend the night at Haddonfield's most feared home.  Just take a wild guess about which house it is.  All of this is being put on a live broadcast on the internet by two people (Busta Rhymes and Tyra Banks)  Any way, the home is equiped with cameras and the college kids' objection it explore the home and where cameras one there heads and discover stuff about Micheal Myers that nobody already doesn't know about.  They mainly just check out old belongongs that belonged to the old Myers family.  Like for an example, one guy find a high chair with hand cuffs and chains on it.  What it up with that.  I was just wondering, shouldn't have all the stuff that belonged to the Myer's family get thrown out by the family that lived in that home in the sixth one? But what they don't know is that all this stuff is all planned and set up by Busta and Tyra.  But there is something it that home that home or should I say SOMEONE in that home that isn't a setup.  It's Micheal and he is off to his gory ways again.  And what makes things worse for thekids and busta is that the house is all locked up so they are kind of trapped.
Halloween Ressurection brings us what every halloween fan excepts.  I myself am more of a Friday the 13th fan but I really enjoyed this film.  The new main character Sara (Bianca Kaljich) really changed thru the story.  At first she was [timid] but at the end she nearly killed micheal with a chainsaw.  Too bad the motor in the chainsaw only lasted a few seconds.  The only thing I didn't like in this movie was that the really hot girl died.  I forget her name but Micheal shoved her back through some pointy spike down in the basement.  Anyway I still like thgis movie.

Michael swaping chothes and mask with that cop in H2O. 2.michael just giving that knife to the crazy dude in the clown mask because thats not Michael's style and not even killing him and 3.not to spoil any thing but the death of one person who was the 3rd victim in this movie was both sadening and stupid aswell as TO EASY AND SOON.

The acting is sometimes a little mediocre, and there are scenes where true ""Halloween"" fans have to wonder what the producers were thinking.

1786466,4,B00006LPHA,"Im going to give an honest review from my horror perspective. I thought the movie was done well with Rosenthals brillance. I find some of the actors having bad dialogues. I was scared to a certain extent. Maybe I was scared because maybe some things were done to make it more scarier. I loved the scene when Myers jumps through the mirror, that was totally unexpected. That is one of the reasons that it was scary. I thought H8 is reminiscent to H2 in alot of ways. Maybe that gives it a push I don't know. I found the killings being better compared to the other sequels. This change to the series is improving it. I found this movie being satisfying and fun to watch. I believe that the critics have too many things up their you know what, they always give it horrible reviews. Who cares, its the 8th Halloween movie, and the only thing that keeps this movie alive is the evil himself, Michael Myers. I say if the Halloween series keeps making respectful money compared to the other horror franchises then its likely to continue. Lets look at what happened to the other franchises like Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Friday The 13th, Hellraiser, they're all goin' down hill. Halloween is still the only franchise left that went through the stalk and slash era of the 80s. I have alot of respect for the series because they still have the boogey men qualities in the movie. This movie did much more better then Jason X. Resurrection made atleast 20 million in the Box Office. This movie made more then any sequal after H2 except H20. This movie accomplished alot even though they're many flaws that are involved with it. Im still a proud fan because Michael hasn't changed a bit.

Busta Rhymes, (who did a great acting job,) puts together an internet webcast from the Myers house. Naturally, many people end up brutally and savagely murdered. High body count for a Halloween movie, and truly wonderful murder scenes. Michael is still the evilest of the evil, and 20+ years hasn't softened him one bit.

1786471,3,B00006LPHA,"To say the 8th installment of Halloween was a disappointment is an understatement that most will agree with. I'm sure there are some fans of Halloween 3, 4, 5 and 6 who like Michael in slice and dice mode, but for those of us who enjoy Michael with some substance and realism like in the original and parts 2 and 7, we're gonna have to wait for another entry, because sadly Michael's homecoming is not all that great. The film starts out with a good, but unnecessary opening sequence that once again pins Michael against his sister Laurie Strode played by the ultra cool Jamie Lee Curtis. If only she had won the battle, the rest of the film may be as entertaining as it's opening ten minutes. Sadly, it just goes down hill from there with boring, cliched characters and dorky plots that get everyone into trouble that anyone with a half of brain in real life wouldn't have gotten themselves into. If this movie makes you long for another Scream sequel in which reality at least played in some part of the film, you are not alone. Trashy horror films like these should have been left in the 80's and early post Scream era. To believe just how tacky this movie is, you have to see it for yourself. I'd recommend renting it unless you're like me and stupid enough to buy a piece of crap just to complete a collection. There are some decent things about it. The cast is all very good even if they do play characters we've seen time and time again. Jamie's appearance does make the film have some tiny shread of credibility. And the DVD is gonna rock with tons of special features like behind the scenes, making of, deleted scenes, commentary and a really cool feature where you can switch back and forth between camera angles using the cameras the characters were strapped with in the movie. Enjoy the features and ignore the movie. That's my advice... After watching this you'll know why Michelle Williams and Josh Hartnett didn't return.",1032393600,4,1936,4.5501432664756445

Now, With this in mind, i as the viewer did not have high hopes walking into the theater. Im a movie goer who doesnt beleive in sequals (unless they are part of a series, and conclude a bigger story I.E Godfather, Scream, Star wars exe). Now all this aside, Halloween Reserection is a moderetly enjoyable film. Its potental defently shines on the giant screen of the drive in, and is natuarly the only enviroment to view this film. Unfortunetly Our drive in's carried nouthing but spiderman and the scorpion king this summer. The film starts off pretty much where the last one left off (With Ms. Curtis finaly Decapitating the beloved slice and dicer). Now did we sincerly think that was the end? Oh of coarse not. They cook up an actualy very clever story to bipass the certain ending wich gave the franchise it's final stab. I give the screen author kudos, because we know this plot twist was not planned durring the scripting of Halloween 7. How ever its cleverness is soon killed off with the death of a major character ( Yes Jamie does actualy get killed off in the first 5 minutes of the film). Leaving the rest of the film basicaly pointless. When you craft a series of films where the main objective carries from film to film (that objective, KILL SISTER), no matter how random, and unexplaned the objective is (hey any one wonder why he tried so darn hard to kill his sister for so darn long? The kid is driven), and to have this goal reached so soon in the movie, leaves the viewer with a sense of, ""Ok now what?"". And we never realy find out. The rest of the film has blood, boobs, screams, and all the other sights expected from such a film...But it just seemed so endless. The terror that made horror fans scream at the origonal 2 Halloweens as all disapeared. I thought they would go with the obvious and have Micheal seek out his nephew, but he was not mentioned in the intire film (mind you they could not pay, or get Josh Hartnet to fill the shoes again). With all the disapointments it still is a must see for the hard core halloween fans, or new commers who haven't seen the other films.

But they obviously got around that and made another sequel. The only problem that I had with this movie was the death of Jamie Lee Curtis' character Laurie Strode. After this sequel it should end because she is finally gone after this one. Yes there is still her son to go after but who cares now. If they keep at it like the Jason films these films will eventually go down rock bottom.

1786483,4,B00006LPHA,"HALLOWEEN: RESURRECTION marks the most current reincarnation of one of celluloid's most famous serial killers, Michael Myers.  Indeed, he has come home yet again, and the majority of devotees of the Samhain-possessed murderer should be pleased.
The movie begins with an energetic prologue explaining how Myers survived his previous bout with execution and displaying the present whereabouts of his sister, Laurie Strode (played effectively by Jamie Lee Curtis).  Seems Strode has been cooped up in an asylum because of her actions the last time around- but she's all too aware that her evil relation will be back soon enough.  So she remains prepared for his inevitable visit, ditching the drugs they give her and setting a trap which hopefully will put an end to the phoenix-like menace that's been around for most of her life.
Fortunately- and as can only be expected- Myers avoids the Reaper yet again, and we receive a somewhat ambiguous climactic confrontation between he and his sibling.  After that, the primary focal point of the film commences: the old Myers abode is going to be utilized for a web-based reality show.  Several college kids are recruited to spend All Hallow's Eve there, searching for clues to the madness of poor Michael.  To spice things up, the producer of the show Freddie Harris- played by Busta Rhymes- makes sure there are plenty of things for the kids to find; he even dresses as the killer, leading to one memorable, very comedic scene.  Myers eventually gives in to his genetic imperative and offs as many helpless victims as he can, following the formula set forth by John Carpenter and Debra Hill so many years ago.
What makes this HALLOWEEN- as well as the last installment- so different from the earlier ones is its total adoption of the contemporary youth-scene style; we definitely have an ""old school"" vs. ""new school"" going on here (it is a Dimension property, keep in mind).  If you are the type of Myers fan who longs for the days of Dr. Loomis (and who doesn't, of course; also, a random thought: if Dr. Hannibal Lector had been around in the early 80s, Donald Pleasance would have made a great deranged cannibal psychiatrist), you might be disappointed.  As for me, I am totally behind the whole post-SCREAM horror renaissance, I think it possesses a valid manner of presentation for today's culture- besides, there's enough of the ""old school"" in the film to keep the orthodox purists from totally dismissing the product (in fact, as anti-intellectual a concept as Jason-is-a-cyborg-in-the-future is, JASON X actually worked as a ""Scream""-like derivative).
Believe it or not, there's some deep satire going on within the flipping frames as well.  What gives RESURRECTION some added depth is its commentary on the whole reality-show zeitgeist which has permeated just about all of the media collective.  After all, are any of these ""reality"" shows really real?  Are the safety of the participants involved held in paramount respect, or is the craving for an unfettered bottom line the main religion?  Are these shows tempest pots waiting to boil over with unpalatable, horrific results?  The film addresses these issues in a superficial fashion, perhaps even in a subtextual manner in some ways (although in other ways, it's directly delivered; think of Busta Rhymes's little speech).
It wasn't a complex film.  It's not a film to be studiously examined or overly dissected (unless you work in this particular genre- if you're looking to replicate URBAN LEGENDS or I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, then this isn't necessarily a useless textbook).  It's a trip down memory lane, a jaunt down a quaint suburban street where babysitters are never safe, where a murderous creature named Michael Myers wields a kitchen knife and uses it not to prepare sustenance but to deny continuation of life.  In this context, it was a memorable piece.",1029196800,,3883,4.995348837209303
1786484,2,B00006LPHA,"Ok, first of all, so I don't sound like a hater, let me just say that I have every Halloween film on DVD (Halloween remains to be the scariest film of all time in my opinion) and that I will get this film on DVD too, but to be honest, it was more than disappointing, it down right sucked. The concept of the movie which is hardly original isn't even done in a cool unoriginal way. Everything in this movie feels completely tired, pieced together and forced. It's so bad that it makes other movies and sequels like the painfully unoriginal Urban Legends: Final Cut seem genius compared to something like this. This is a Halloween movie, we should be treated with something incredible. Halloween fans are some of the best and most loyal following a franchise that's been running for over a span of 3 decades. We deserve something at least to be proud of to spend our money on. This non scary, lame attempt, that lacks any and every quality a horror movie should have has absolutely no reason to be made other than to almost completely savage a franchise who's ups until recently out weighed the downs. The acting, despite some decent names including original Halloween heroin Jamie Lee Curtis, is god awful. The main character Sara played by Bianca Kajlich is no Scream Queen and doesn't have what it takes to take over the franchise. Her character was simply boring and she was given pathetic material which would have made even the most talented actress look terrible, but Neve Campbell she isn't. After L.L. Cool J. bringing charm to the likeable Halloween: H20, filmakers decided to bring Busta Rhymes on board for this installment. Go see the film and you'll see what a mistake it was. His character was so cliched as the token black guy that it literally made me feel sorry for all black actors who've worked hard to lose the idiotic stereotype placed on them in horror movies. He has no talent as an actor, but at least he has Tyra Banks to make him look good. Her presence in the film couldn't serve any less purpose. She makes coffee and sits on her butt through out the entire movie. I'm sure that's what she did on the set too. All the other actors in the film are ok and some quite likeable. Too bad they weren't the main cast. The story is bad enough to make you sick, the scares and / or laughs don't exist, most of the cast was terrible and the plot was predictable and boring. The only reason it gets two stars is because of the opening sequence with Jamie Lee Curtis which inspires more thrills in ten minutes than the entire film combined. It gives a great taste at what might have been had someone put the passion that went into that one scene into the entire film.",1029196800,,2682,4.464358452138493
1786485,5,B00006LPHA,"Halloween Ressurection is definately worthy of the previous sequels. Sure, Michael finally kills off his sister but isn't it about time? Now that Laurie Strode is dead the plot can finally move on. It was a good idea to have a Halloween movie that takes place in the Myers house with Michael actually living inside the house. Even though Laurie Strode is the only returning character from H20, the film is still good and audiences will be (or should be) pleased.
As far as a 9th Halloween movie, Laurie's son from H20 is still alive (or so we think). Michael is still alive even at the end of Halloween Ressurection so I'll bet that he will go after the living son of Laurie Strode from H20.",1028332800,,691,4.492063492063492

It didn't eplain enough how Jaimie Lee killed the wrong person, but it was cool. Everyone in the theatre was either screaming(girls) or cheering(guys), especially when that blonde chick was smoking a bong, lol. The only thing that bugged me is that she died in the first twenty minutes. but considering Michael has survived a bunch of deaths, she can too.

1786488,3,B00006LPHA,"I just saw Halloween: Resurrection and must say I liked it. It's pretty entertaining, it keeps you at the edge of you seat throughout the movie. I'm surprised that whole body switch thing worked for me as well. It's explained in the beginning that Jamie Lee Curtis is in a nuthouse for accidently killing a security guard that Micheal attacked and put his mask on . Of course for a Michael Myers movie it's extremely violent, perhaps the most violent of all even. What makes the movie watchable for me  was Busta Ryhmes, he's absolutely hilarious. The funniest scene will have to be when he's dressed like Micheal Myers to scare the reality show contestants and is comfronted by the real one who he of course thinks is another actor. He tells him off saying he's gonna ruin everything and actually gets him to turn around and walk away. His whole kun-fu stuff at the end is pretty funny too. The whole reality show thing is a nice touch too even if it is a little too obvious about who's gonna die and who's not. Halloween: Resurrection isn't a great movie but what Halloween movie is that isn't the first one ? It certainly is a much much better movie thatn The Curse of Michael Myers though where he would appear in someones house, kill them then appear in the back of someones car only seconds later to kill them as well. At least this one paces itself and when someone dies it takes it's time to have another slaughtered. It's sort of like Michael is at buffet where he can choose one thing and come back for more. It's the most fun he's had since being in a hospital in Halloween 2.",1027900800,,1587,4.416382252559727
1786489,4,B00006LPHA,"Halloween Resurrection may have saved the franchise.  Another disappointment (after Halloween 6 and H20) could have killed Michael Myers.  Thankfully, this film lived up to the expectations of Halloween fans.
The plot begins with the explanation of how Michael is alive.  This sets the tone for the movie, and instead of viewers waiting for Michael to show up for fourty-five minutes like in H20, he appears within the first twenty minutes.  Using Jamie Lee Curtis in the beginning of the movie made me think of Halloween 1 and 2.  The plot stays consistent in pleasing the audience with the Webcast, aside from one part when the teens enter the house, finding nothing.  The suspense rises in the end when the cat and mouse chase occurs between Michael and Sara.
A problem I had with the movie was Myers.  I found he didn't stay true to the other Michael Myers' throughout the franchise.  In the intiial pursuit of Laurie, Myers walked much too quickly.  He rushed himself.  The original Michael Myers would take his time, knowing that eventually he would come face to face with his prey.  Another other problem that I had woth this Michael was the mask.  I realize that the mask has to somewhat conform to the actor's face, but this mask didn't scare me as much as the ones in H1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 did.  Finally, this Michael didn't intrigue me.  He wasn't eerie.  He was a typical murderer.  In the past, Myers would walk, stop, and if there was another hallway or corridor beside him, he would slowly turn his head to see what was there.  This Michael didn't pull that off as well.
Though these three flaws with Myers existed, I wasn't completely dissatisfied woth the acting of this character.  The murder scenes, and the stunt scenes managed to captivate me.  I felt the best scenes that Myers did in this movie were the ones in the corridor leading to his bedroom underneath the house.
The house in this movie was done beautifully, even though the director expects us to forget the Strodes lived there only a few years ago.  I can't be certain, but it seemed like the Myers house changed for the fourth and fifth movies.  I liked this house the best, assuming it was a different one.
The acting by Jamie Lee Curtis in this movie was excellent.  As for the others, it was decent.  Many stereotypes were evident in the teens, but it didn't affect the overall movie, and it also added to the dynamics of the movie.  Busta Rhymes and Tyra Banks did a surprisingly good job in the film.
Overall, Halloween Resurrection didn't let us down.  It's an excellent movie, and in comparison to the others it ranks better than Halloween 2, 3, 5, 6 and H20.  Some may say that the plot is a bad premise for a horror movie, but it delivers everything a good horror movie should, and more.  Rick Rosenthal was a blessing for this film.  Any other director couldn't have pulled off a Halloween Reality Webcast installment.  Though minor character flaws existed, this movie should please all Halloween fans and attract new Halloween fans as well.  Let's hope with this film's success, we'll be seeing a Halloween 9 very soon.",1027814400,9,3109,4.62043795620438
1786509,2,B00006LPHA,"I can only judge this movie based on its own merits, as I haven't seen the others in the series.
Very little scared me in this movie.  From the first murder to the final ""surprise"", there is no inventiveness or suspense.  In a horror film, the terror comes not from the violence and gore, but from the unexpectedness of it, and the novelty in how it's done.  None of the victims died in novel ways, nor did they escape in novel ways.  The appearance of Michael Myers was never a shock, never a surprise, and the end of the film is as predictable as they come.
My only kudos go out to Busta Rhymes, who brought a touch of humor and originality and camp, not taking his role TOO seriously, making me laugh and scream in delight.",1027728000,,726,4.2773722627737225

1786512,4,B00006LPHA,"First, let me start off wih saying that you have to be a real hardcore Halloween fan, like I am, to love it. If you're interested in following up on this movie, than watch Halloween 1,2, and H20. Don't bother with the rest. They have nothing to do with it. If you watch those three, that will give you a basic backround of the series. Now, onto the review... (SPOILERS)
The first 10-15 min. of this film are the best. It features Jamie Lee, but ends with her death. It slowly gets exciting from there until you get to the last 30 min with Sara (Bianca Kasjlich) trying to get away from Michael by using her Palm Pilot to communicate to her friend who is watching the webcast. He types and sends messages on his palm pilot of where Michael is and which way she should go. It's just plain exciting.
The deaths are definitly above average. There are SO much better than the deaths in H20. See below for a list of deaths.
Overall, this was an above average entry into the series. Go and see it even if you're not a fan, you'll enjoy the deaths.

1786513,4,B00006LPHA,"Forget what the critics say if You're a big Halloween fan like me, were you really expecting a classic? Based on the plot and actors/actresses I sure as hell wasn't! The movie sure had it's disapontments such as some cheesy acting, but was mostly satisfiing I guess. The first fifteen minutes was great involving Jamie Lee Curtis but they were also extraeneuous. The weak part of the movie was after the 15 minute Jamie Lee Cutis cameo. Busta Rhymes who wasn't terrible had a role that did not suit his nature, none the less, the movie had a few good scares though it was a bit predicatable. Tyra Banks, Bianca Kajlich and Katee Sackoff had terrible acting. The rest of the supporting cast Thomas Ian Nichols, Sean Patrick Thomas, Luke Kirby and Daisy Mckrackin did a solid job. Michael Myers for the most part looked like his scary self, but whatever happened to his burnt hands and shot up eyes? The director Rick Rosenthal who directed Halloween 2 in 1981 (The best Halloween Sequel up to date) forgot about what happened to Michael in his own directed movie! As far as the ending is concerned It scared the whole theater but was kind of predictable.  Overall I give it three and a half stars and that is just being very fair from a diehard Halloween fan. With all this being said the bottom line is that this franchise has to somehow go back to John Carpenter's bright Ideas from the original Halloween. These sequels all these years have not made much critics exited. However critics are ignorant and have big ego's. Dam the crtics for killing this movie. It's what the fans think. In this case I noticed most fans were satisfied with this movie. Now hopefully in Halloween 9 they bring Jamie Lee Curtis back, get better acting, and get bring more suspense, also to make the movie longer, the 87 minute running time for this movie was not a smart idea.",1027296000,,1857,4.576576576576577

When the credits started and Busta Rhymes was at the top of the list, I started to reconsider my decision. I mean a rap star as part of the leading cast? I figured, this movie is gonna stink! Well, I was wrong!
The action in the movie starts right away. That's right Halloween fans, blood and gore from the beginning of the movie!  Six college students are chosen to participate in a reality internet show.  The show takes place in Michael Meyers childhood home.  The players are supposed to try to find clues as to why Meyers became a serial killer.  Busta Rhymes is incharge of this internet program.  Action is abundant throughout the whole movie! And my apologies to Busta Rhymes - He kicked some serious ...! More blood and gore than you can shake a stick at! And, in true Halloween fashion, Michael Myers takes a lickin' and keeps on tickin'! This part of the series even gives us some closure, but not too much, or there couldn't be a sequel.

I will say this one was a little better but not much.  The death scence where old and predictable.  The use of shadows and music where lackluster.  lets face it michial myers just isn't scarry anymore since the 78 and 81 movies.  It just never has gotten its flare back. I had to see it just becuse I knew it would suck plus im a film student and I went to study it.  The camera effects on the kids in the house was not a new good idea I thik it disteracs from the film.  Hollywood we don't want flashy camera filters on our horror movies.  Givn it works for some but not for this move.  It should of been shot on gritty film  (not quility)  With more lighting effects and better background music.

1786527,3,B00006LPHA,"I wonder if John Carpenter knew what he was doing when he released his classic original film 24 years ago in 1978?. I doubt it. His quiet, little movie has spawned sequel after sequel, some good, some not, and now we have come to this latest installment that jumps in on today's internet/reality craze. I wonder what he must be thinking?. As a big fan of these movies, I will say that I was both satisfied and annoyed with this latest entry. It's three years later(according to the film it is, but in reality it's been 4 years)and Michael is back. We learn thru flashbacks just how he survived his decapitation at the end of H20. It's very simple. No, he did not sew it right back on. Jamie Lee Curtis returns as Laurie Strode, who is now locked up in a sanitarium. Michael comes back to settle the score with his dear sister once and for all. Once that business is done, he sets back to his house in Haddonfield, where a bunch of college kids are rummaging thru it and broadcasting it live over the internet on Halloween night. ... Nothing in the rest of the film holds as strong as the opening. Not to say there aren't really good parts. The film is shot well, and it looks really good. The sound is sharp and crisp. Vancouver, B.C. where this was shot is a great, beautiful city, but it's not Haddonfield. The music is great. John Carpenter's classic score sounds really, really good here. It is definitley more effective here than in past sequels. The cast is pretty ordinary. Bianca Kajlich as heroine Sara, is the real stand out. My, what a beauty. ... Tyra Banks is another beauty who is wasted in this. She had no real point being here. Didn't director Rick Rosenthal have enough sense to use a name like her better?. Thomas Ian Nicholas from the ""American Pie"" films is just there as fodder. Busta Rhymes. What can I say?. I didn't mind him at first, but as the film went on he got very irritating. Sprouting inane jokes and curses all over the place, it just felt uncomfortable and out of place. Let's hope he doesn't return. Brad Loree as Michael Myers is good. ...The live cam aspect of the film starts off as something fun and promising, a la ""The Blair Witch"". But, it fastly becomes a headache. It gets in the way when we could've seen something good. Interesting idea, but it fails. There are a few homages to past films. Michael's muffled breathing is back. We haven't heard that since the original. The professor early in the film(played by director Rick Rosenthal)was named Mixler. The name of the drunk doctor in Part 2. There are a few others as well. I'm not gonna touch the ending. You can see it coming from a mile away. It ends in the traditional ""Halloween"" way. All in all, I had fun with it. There were problems, sure, but I'm willing to overlook it. Definitley better than Parts 5, 6, and the much maligned Part 3. It is useless for people to compare it to the original. Never do that. Even if it is good, your not going to like it if you compare it to the first one. H20 felt like it was made for the love of the series and for the fans. This one definitley doesn't. This one is about money. All about the money. Is it scary?. I can't answer that. Every one is going to be scared by different things. The one major problem that this movie has above all others is that you see WAY too much of Michael. It kills the effect. We've never seen as much of Michael than in this one. It definitley hurts the film. I know we want to see him, but less is better. Plus, they have returned Michael to a 'Jason' like killer. A higher body count with more rougher kills. This is not Michael. Look at the original. Oh well. At least it is better than the disgusting ""Jason X"". Once again, the score is great, Jamie Lee's moments are important, Brad Loree is a great Michael, and beautiful Bianca Kajlich is nice to watch. But please, Dimension Films and Moustapha Akkad, whatever you do for Part 9, don't send Michael into space.",1026950400,3,3944,4.374659400544959

It's just a mask,I could look scaryer if I punched myself in the face. In the first Halloween when Jamie Lee Curtis is in the closit she pulls of half of his mask and he's a normal guy until the doctor shoots him. So it's a great movie,a little cheesy but a great movie.

With the remarkable (and finite) ending of H20, we all thought, and I hoped, it was all over for Michael Myers (don't get me wrong, i love these films, but why let it go too far?). However, the capitalist in us all reminded us that any film that shows any hint at success will inevitably spawn a sequel. This is it. With a plot that is way too reminiscent of ""Blair Witch 2"" (which in turn was a huge rip-off of ""Blair Witch Project""), it is only redeemed by the acting of Busta Rhymes and Bianca Kajlich. Michael himself is reminscient of H20 and 6, but with a good mask. I will admit that the final chase scene between Myers and characters Sarah and Freddie was good. Overall, not the best film, but not the worst by far.",1026864000,,844,4.216049382716049
1786533,3,B00006LPHA,"Yes, Michael Myers returns once again in the 8th and so far final film of the original ""Halloween"" storyline, ""Halloween: Resurrection"". Resurrection continues from the new, alternate storyline created by ""H20"", the previous Michael Myers film, which had ignored Halloweens 4-6, and the unrelated Halloween 3 in order to go back to the roots of the first two films and continue the story of Laurie Strode. Laurie returns again for this final installment, played once again by Jamie Lee Curtis, but don't let her prominence on the cover art fool you. Her role in this installment is very brief and apparently meant to be her and her character's bowing out of the series for good. Once that is out of the way, this 8th film tries to create a new motivation for Michael to continue as an unstoppable killing force, probably in the hopes of 8 more films. But alas, the only motivation they could come up with was Michael going back to his old house and killing anyone who invaded it. Well, I guess that makes sense, but it's also a little too bland and uninspired. For the first time, a Michael film truly seems like nothing more than walking around killing people in the dark. That's not to say this pretty much panned film doesn't have its own creativity. The invaders of Michael's home here happen to be a bunch of college kids taking part in a horror themed reality show, sent in to wander the Myers home in search of clues to what drove Michael to kill. The ""show"" they are doing is streaming live on the internet on Halloween night, and we get to follow the events from both perspectives, as another main character (who is luckily not in any physical danger himself; they should have given him more to do I think, like in his alternate ending) watches via a laptop at a Halloween party and eventually sends text warnings to guide one of the show participants, a pretty young girl he's become internet pals with, to safety. It actually plays out pretty interesting to watch, it's just also suffers from all the superficialities of modern horror. We don't really get too attached to any of the characters, not even the female lead they are trying to make into a modern Laurie Strode, and they are all just a little too self-obsessed, as good-looking folks often are.

So, basically, ""Halloween: Resurrection"" is worth watching for popcorn entertainment value and moderately successful as such, but it's a failed attempt at breathing new life into Myers' killing spree franchise. It just doesn't add anything to Michael lore beyond taking Jamie Lee Curtis out of the picture in the very beginning. And sorry if you think that's a spoiler, but it's important to share that this movie is not a Laurie Strode picture. The characters that make up the bulk of the film aren't very likeable, though I wish the hot redhead had been in more of it. The one character we get to like is the guy who isn't even in danger at all, because he shows the most genuine personality. He's actually played by a former Disney Channel star, Ryan Merriman, whom I always thought was going to be the breakout male star from his D.C. era. Turned out it was instead Shia LaBeouf, understandably, since his acting is insanely, phenomenally impressive. Oh, and there's also two other ""actors"" that must be noted. One is Tyra Banks, whom I have never liked since seeing bits of her talk show and other films where her acting was... unsatisfying. She must not be very memorable in this one though. I swear, I can't remember a single one of her scenes well enough to comment on how well she acted in this film. The other entertainer of note is Busta Rhymes, because he plays the most obnoxious character in the film and also one who faces off against Michael a few times and fairs perhaps a little too well each time. I don't think he would have lasted long gainst the Michael of the first few films. Frankly, here we are expected to laugh at Michael a bit too much, I think, when he has his encounters with Busta Rhymes. They ARE funny, but is it good to have moments in a ""Halloween"" film where we are laughing at Michael's expense? Anyway, I can never decide whether or not I like Busta Rhymes in this movie. I don't think the humor with Michael is appropriate, and at times Busta certainly is irritating. I'm sure most Halloween fans hate him in this. Still, at times I find him very entertaining in this too. But, this just enforces my point. This film is not a great Halloween franchise film. It fails in that respect. But it is an entertaining ""horror"" film to waste a night on.

Surprisingly after the previous films' DVD releases, this one is LOADED with bonus features. Director and editor commentary (by the way, this was surprisingly directed by the director of Halloween 2), deleted and alternate scenes, behind the scenes futurities, storyboard comparisons, and even a cut of the Headcam footage into an alternate look at the film(oh, yeah, the show participants all wear head-mounted cameras). So, if you're a fan of this one, the DVD doesn't short change you. Considering the fact that H20 was supposed to be such a big deal, you'd think that one would have gotten this sort of DVD treatment. Anyway, recommended only to the hardcore Michael Myers fan or as a pure popcorn movie. It IS entertaining to say the least, but they should have left things with H20 (or Halloween 2, ha).",1026864000,,5363,4.632352941176471
1786534,1,B00006LPHA,"This movie left me with many questions to ponder:
1) Why do they glamourize serial killers in movies?
2) Why does Jamie Lee Curtis (as Micheal Myers sister) ask to her brother ""Why did you take so long to find me?"" Wouldn't a more apt question have been: ""How the heck do you live through each sequel?""
3) Why do horror movies tend to think that loud sound effects are scary? (Honestly, I think I might have a migrane)
4) Is there something special you have to do to kill Micheal Myers? I mean, really. The guy has been decapitated, burned (several times), electrocuted, stabbed, beaten up, kicked in the face and groin, fallen off buildings, shot, taken verbal abuse (am I forgetting something....please let me know)...
5) Why am I watching a movie when the two most notable names are Tyra Banks and Busta Rhymes?
6) Do we really need Busta Rhymes doing Bruce Lee moves and cussing like a sailor at Micheal Myers?
7) Why did I pay for this? I could have given it to a local charity or something.
Now my disclaimer: I like horror movies as much as the next guy or gal. I just thought that some things were overdone. Honestly, I think you can picture this movie in your mind and it might be as good, or better, than seeing it. It is that predictable and rediculous. I know that I didn't expect much from an 8th sequel to a series, but I just had to give no credit where no credit is due. Do not see this movie at the show. At least wait till it comes out on video.",1026864000,,1463,4.266187050359712
1786535,2,B00006LPHA,"When will I learn to stop going to these slasher sequels?
""Halloween: Resurrection"" is the 8th movie in the ""Halloween"" series, but only the 4th in the storyline. Make sense? No? Well, nevermind. No, let me explain. Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance starred in the first two Halloween movies as Laurie Strode (Michael Myers' sister), and Dr. Loomis, respectively. Those two films count as part of the 'official' storyline. Then, ""Halloween 3"" comes along, having nothing whatsoever to do with the Michael Myers-as-serial killer storyline.
""Halloween"" 4,5, and 6 all featured Dr. Loomis again, as he chased down Michael Myers as some sort of obsession. Then, ""Halloween:H20"" comes along as the seventh film in the series, and says: ""O.K. Please disregard the storylines in parts 4,5, and 6 - we're picking up from after part 2."" Laurie Strode was back, and her and Michael faced off in some fierce macho woman vs. man in a William Shatner mask competition. That's some ""Halloween"" lore for you. Legend has it that when creating the mask for Michael Myers, they decided to mold it off a bust of William Shatner. So basically, what we have are 7 (not counting the third part) movies about Captain Kirk stalking twenty-something imbeciles.
In 2002, 24 years after the original ""Halloween"", we are graced with part 8, ""Resurrection"". An apt title, as Mr. Myers was decapitated at the end of the last film. The explanation given for his survival from the beheading is preposterous, but then again, I'm not sure why I should be surprised. After a teenage youth spent watching all the Jason and Freddy movies on HBO, I don't know why *anything* a maniacal, knife-wielding killer does should surprise me anymore. Laurie Strode, after her own maniacal experience with an axe at the end of ""Halloween:H20"", is shown to be residing in a mental hospital. Michael Myers arrives and dispatches his sister after she had a perfect opportunity to do away with him for good. Ah, sibling rivalry - when will it end?
After he and his sister share a last kiss (I'm not joking here), Michael then proceeds to make his way home to his old house in Haddonfield, IL. It is here where I began to question how Michael gets around. Does he drive? Or does he walk? I prefer the ""walking"" theory, as it explains why he is always breathing so heavily under that mask. Also converging on Haddonfield, IL. is the brand new video company, Dangertainment, run by Busta Rhymes (the movie just keeps getting better). Actually, truth be told, it's mainly for Busta Rhymes that I'm even giving this movie 2 stars, instead of 1 (or zero, if I were able to).
Dangertainment is a company which finds eerie locales and broadcasts from them live, via the internet. The inaugural location is that of the Myers home, now quite run-down and spookily grey looking (day or night), so it evokes the right level of 'scary'. Busta then gets a handful of volunteers (ha! like you'd catch me in there) to spend the night in the house whilst the cameras roll. Of course, Michael Myers is busy chillin' at the crib when these intruders arrive at his doorstep, so he is forced to cut short his dinner of live rats (no joke) and dispense with them.
This begs the serious question: Would an entertainment company be allowed to do a broadcast from the home of a *still at-large* serial killer, on Halloween night, the very night that the psycho likes to lower the population of Haddonfield every few years? No, you say? Well, luckily for Dangertainment (and the script writers), the question was never raised.
What ensues in the rest of ""Halloween:Resurrection"" is the usual carnage and impalement that occurs in every slasher flick. I thought that the movie did not balance the humor and the horror elements very well, nor did I find the characters that compelling. I know I probably sound like I'm looking for Shakespeare in ""Halloween"", and should just be happy that they didn't pretend to kill-off Michael Myers again and then at the end surprise us by showing that he was actually still alive.
Oooops. Nevermind.",1026777600,,4060,4.793152639087019
1786536,1,B00006LPHA,"I was willing to accept most of this movie's terrible flaws.  Bad acting, stupid characters, obvious cash-ins, the ridiculous way of bringing Michael back, too much comic relief, copycat scenes of other horror films, Busta Rhymes hammy martial arts scenes, I could deal with them.
So what is it that I found totally unacceptable?  It was Laurie Strode's death.  Before I saw this movie, I heard rumors that she was going to die.  I prayed it wasn't true, but it was unfortunately confirmed within the first 15-20 minutes of this film.  Here's the story...
In 1998 Laurie Strode thought she decapitated Michael Myers, but she was wrong.  It seems he switched outfits with a paramedic before he could be loaded into the van, so Laurie ended up fighting with and killing the wrong guy.  Why didn't the paramedic just say something?  Because Michael crushed his larynx.
3 years later...
Laurie is now comitted to a mental institution after losing her mind from the aforementioned event.  She pretends to be totally still and mute, but is actually putting on an act and just waiting for Michael to show up.  Of course, he does and manages to bust into her room (thanks to the incompetent security guards).  He chases her down the hall and up the stairs to the roof.  As soon as he steps into a remote-controlled knoose, Laurie pushes the button and has him hanging upside down.  He ends up dropping the knife, which Laurie picks up and has a little chat with him.  She tells him he has failed because she is no longer afraid of him and no longer afraid to die.  She then proceeds to cut the rope, but stops when Michael starts grabbing his head like the paramedic did at the end of H20.  This leads Laurie to believe that she may be killing another innocent person, so she makes the dumb mistake of going over to Michael and trying to pull off the mask just ""to be sure"" (like she knows what his face looks like anyway).  Sure enough, it was just a trick.  Michael grabs Laurie, the rope breaks and he takes her down with him (regaining the knife in the process).  He ends up hanging on to the rope with one hand and stabbing her in the back with the other.  Laurie then kisses Michael, says ""I'll see you in Hell"", and then falls into the trees in slow motion (accompanied by some dramatic score, thus crafting a pathetic attempt at making it seem like such a good ending for her).
The only time I accept the demise of heroes and heroines is when they die trying to do good.  If Laurie had died trying to save somebody or something like that, then I would have accepted it.  But no!  Laurie Strode died because she was stupid.  What made her think she was about to kill an innocent person?  He busted down her door with his bare hands and came after her with a knife.  She should have either cut that rope or let him hang.  Also, how did Michael know the paramedic felt his head, and what was all that jive about him ""failing""?  It seems to me like HE won the battle.
I think Jamie Lee Curtis is a terrific actress, but I am very disappointed in her.  She made a very poor decision which I find to be quite insulting to the character that made her what she is today.  I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to watch another movie with her again.  It is too grim a reminder.  I have an excellent idea for the next HALLOWEEN, but due to the fact that I am an inexperienced screenwriter (still learning), I doubt I can strike a deal with the owners.  Too bad, because I would have brought Laurie back and sent her off with a bang.
P.S. Yes, I do have this movie, but only for collecting.  Guess how many times I have actually watched it.",1026777600,,3625,4.3692077727952165
1786537,1,B00006LPHA,"The whole movie was very predictable and just a typical teeny bopper date movie.

Since there has been speculation about Jamie Lee Curtis being killed I guess it's no mystery anymore, which is the first reason this better be the last Halloween movie.  They better not make another one if Jamie Lee Curtis can't be in it, because that would be wrong, she is the main character and it wouldn't be right without her in it.  Another reason is that he should've died by now, I know that in every horror movie the killer never dies, but he should've died in this one only because director's are running out of interesting ways to kill their bad guys.  So I really liked this movie, but if they plan on Halloween 9 I could change my mind very quickly.",1026691200,,765,4.404255319148936
1786539,1,B00006LPHA,"In ""Halloween 8: The Search for More Money"", Jamie Lee Curtis appears in the opening scenes as the ever-weary Laurie Strode, now a patient in a loony bin.  Apparently, through some ridiculous loophole that allows this sequel to exist, she decapitated the wrong guy at the end of ""H20"", and Michael Myers is still on the loose.  As a matter of fact, Curtis dies gracefully after 10 minutes of screen time, and if you interpret that as a spoiler, think again: that's the single most shocking or original thing you'll see in this turgid seventh sequel, and it's actually not very shocking at all.
What remains is pretty awful, too.  I suppose I went into the theater with my expectations a bit high after the well-done ""H20"", but it becomes clear that any of the killer's psychology or motivation is going to be forgotten once the number of sequels in a series gets THIS high.  Instead, we have a group of idiotic college students drafted to participate in some contest taking place inside the famed Myers house (imagine the people who stand out in Times Square while TRL is taping and you have their collective personality).  Officiating all this is Busta Rhymes and Tyra Banks, two nonactors who fare horribly here, but that's keeping in tune with the rest of the film.
Okay, sounds pretty conventional, doesn't it?  Sounds pretty lame, doesn't it?  Well, I haven't gotten to the best part yet.  Being as it's the new millennium and all, the filmmakers attempt to 'thrust Michael Myers into the 21st century' by having the students' actions broadcast live over the Internet!  So, in addition to a lot of obvious false scares and people getting impaled on sharp objects, you also get countless, jittery, grainy POV shots!  And the writers, after staying up all night watching ""The Blair Witch Project,"" thought this was a strong enough reason to resuscitate Michael Myers (and his waning franchise)?  And keeping with the whole Internet motif, the incredibly lame dialogue seems to have been churned out by a supercomputer that's probably smarter than anyone involved with this film.
Anyway, the gimmick of using different camera stock is very weak excuse for making a film that is obviously about pumping a few more bucks out of a dried-up series.  Director Rick Rosenthal (""Halloween II"") seems to have forgotten even the elementary scare tactics he utilized 20 years ago.  But despite ""Halloween 8""'s appalling lack of imagination and contempt for its audience, the filmmakers manage to do one thing right--make it really obvious that the door is open for another sequel (it's a very cheap 'scare' at the end), which, if this film is a financial success, I can only say is a deserved punishment for a public that refuses to learn from the ghosts of sequels past.",1026691200,3,2763,4.840764331210191

Yet it's a shame that Laurie Strode (the heroine from the first two movies and H20)was killed off in the first ten minutes, but I guess her time had some. Some things won't be around forever. . . unlike Michael. . .
This movie started back in 1978, and it's going after a new generation, so I really liked how Michael's history was intregrated into the story, for those who had no idea about this killing machine named Michael Myers.

1786548,1,B00006LPHA,"Have I been watching the wrong series for the past 7 movies?  Wasn't Michael only after his sister, or immediate family members?  What is the premise, purpose, behind this movie?  The true horror is that they have lost the reason behind Michael Myers' killing.  He only killed people who got in the way of his trying to kill his sister.  He only killed people who were involved with his biological family members.  His lifelong task is accomplished within the first 5 minutes of the film.  He kills his sister, the only good character of the series.  It seemed out of character for Laurie Strode to be so stupid!  She has always been a strong character & very wise.  How did she make such a stupid mistake?  Why did Michael continue to kill people after killing Laurie?  He had no reason to.  Anyone who knows anything about serial killers knows that they always have a continual motive behind their actions.  There was no motive behind this movie at all.  It made no sense, and failed to follow the complete storyline consistently.  Laurie should have been the one to vanquish Michael.  She was the heroine!  H20 was such a good movie & followed the plot line closely.  H20 was filmed well, scary, had a good soundtrack, and had good actors.  Halloween Resurrection had the worst actors, bad soundtrack, and was filmed mostly with cheap cameras seemingly to lower the budget costs.  It was the most horrible of the series.  If Michael switched bodies at the end of H20, how could the security guard try to kill Laurie in the getaway van?  Also, how could the security guard live through bursting through a windshield, being hit at full speed, rolling down a hill & being pinned between a tree and the van, and respond to Laurie when she called him Michael?  ""Halloween Desecration""  should be buried along with Michael.",1026518400,5,1820,4.6835443037974684
1786549,5,B00006LPHA,"I saw Halloween: Resurrection today and I must say I am impressed! The Halloween saga takes on a new direction after Michael confronts his sister Laurie Strodes played by the talented Jamie Lee Curtis.  Jamie has a camero appearreance for the first 10 minutes confronting her manical brother in a medical institute.  Dispite some spoilers expressed with other reviews, I won't say a word here.  Jamie Lee Curtis gives a fine performance and closes the final chapter for the character she created, Laurie Strode.  At this point, Laurie is a broken down woman who has enough.  Josh, her son is not mentioned in the movie since but his picture is displayed on the wall in Laurie's room.  Since the whole Halloween theme is for Michael to kill off his bloodline, the franchise does fail to mention what happened to Josh or Steven (the baby of Jamie Lloyd, Laurie's daughter in past films).  Laurie also never mentions Jamie, the daughter she gave up.  As a true fan of the Halloween films, I can simply dismiss this oversight. Perhaps, Laurie did not want anyone to know she was alive in Haddonfield when she fled to California as described in the previous installment, H20?  Most likely, the actor that played Josh will might return or his death will be mentioned in future sequels.
In Resuurection, we find Michael returning to his stomping grounds of Haddonfield, IL on Halloween.  At this point in the francise, Michael is known as a ""legend"", one of the nation's worst serial killers in history.  The Myers place is the town's haunted house abandonned what we are to assume from the last family that lived there (halloween 6 ).  The Myers house is equipped with internet cameras and wires for a live broadcast on Halloween night. 6 students are to explore the house with head gear equipped with cameras and lights to broadcast on the internet.  This quick money scheme as Michael goes trick or treating in the house knocking off each person in the house in the most creative and gory ways. The plot is simple and storyline is simple.  The movie gives you a feeling of clausphobia and dread. The camera angles with Michael fading in and out of the darkness is great.  The famous Halloween theme is back with a slight modification.  After all what Halloween movie would there be without that creepy music. I personally think H20 would have been more effective if the theme was used more.  Overall, I think Halloween Ressurection is a great movie. The acting is okay, some corny lines but otherwise easily overlooked as you get yourself immerge into the movie.  Some camera shots show you the characters through the eyes of the camera lense and this gives you the creepy feeling like the Blair Witch Project did for its viewers.  Some die hard fans will be upset because Michael is not going after Josh or Steven to be consisist with the whole concept of the franchise.  I can see Hollywood is trying to bring Michael to a new generation of kids with a more modern version of kids. Will the franchise get back on track with the concept of elimating his bloodline or go with the new direction like so many other sequels have done as they hit #6 or 7?  It doesnt matter, right now the series is open for it to go to any direction or combine both story lines.

You have to at least give this one an ""A"" for originality. When last seen on screen, relentless serial killer Michael Myers was decapitated by his perennial intended victim, Jamie Lee Curtis. It's long been established that Michael is some sort of unkillable boogeyman, but how could he regenerate a new head? Easy. He wasn't the one who got decapitated - Jamie Lee killed some other poor guy in a mask. Given that the poor guy who died in Michael's place was a peaceful enough fellow, the question of why he was trying to kill Jamie Lee at the end of the last installment is conveniently never raised.
Resurrection's teaser finds Jamie Lee and Michael finishing up old business at the hospital in which she's been committed since she killed the wrong guy. The movie proper finds producers Busta Rhymes and Tyra Banks recruiting a handful of college teens to spend Halloween night in Michael Myers' home, for a reality T.V. show called ""Dangertainment."" Busta knows reality is pretty boring, so he's laced the house with a few creepy toys and surprises, including himself in Michael's famous William Shatner mask and patent coveralls. Imagine his surprise - and the kids' screams - when he meets the real thing, carving a new swathe of blood and guts for a live nationwide audience...
The movie should be better than it is, but it's still pretty good. The premise is clever enough that the standard lame script doesn't matter. The cast is fine, considering they're really little more than glorified fodder for the boogeyman's knife. It's not entirely plausible (did I just say that, about a movie featuring an impossibly unkillable killer?) - beginning with the stated reason why Michael is still alive - but you'll enjoy the dizzying Blair Witch cinema verite photography of Michael's ins and outs from the shadows so much that you probably won't even notice, let alone care.",1026518400,,1959,4.868263473053892
1786553,3,B00006LPHA,"Halloween: Resurrection is the eight installment of the Halloween series and hopefully the last! It was scary the first and second time, but it just dosen't scare me anymore. First of all in H20, Michael Myers was killed. They chopped he's head off! What is it going to be a headless Myers? No. Everything is explained in the movie.
It begins with Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) in an insane asylum (which so happens to be the best part of this film). Of course she gets killed. (I knew that before I went to see the movie because the trailer and articals reveal too much!). Now Michael Myers goes back home and finds a bunch of teenagers doing a live broadcast over the internet. Now Michael Myers gets mad and is ready to kill them all.
I have one problem. Michael Myers just wanted to kill Lauire and he has. He killed his sister Judith and Lauire so their isn't any story to tell. John, who was played by Josh Hartnet, dosen't return. He said he won't return to any Halloween movie again after doing movies like ""Black Hawk Down"" and ""Pearl Harbor"". Which I wonder 'why the heck did he do ""40 Days and 40 Nights""?'.
Well the movie was ok. It really didn't scare me except for like two parts. Tyra Banks acting was horrible like usual. Maybe that's why she wasn't even in it as much (even though the advertisments make her seem like a main character, which she is not). First it was LL Cool J, now we have Busta Rhymes. Whose next R. Kelly or maybe even The Rock!!! Busta Rhymes was not as good as he was in ""Shaft"". The other people were terrible also. I don't know where they got the plot from because it wasn't a good one. I liked the way they make the camera's look like from the Blair Witch Project, but they don't really successed in making it work too good.
Halloween: The Homecoming was a better title because Michael Myers is coming back home. Michael Myers is not resurecting because he wasn't really dead, right? So Halloween: Resurrection is not a good title. Well I really don't know what else to say but it wasn't all that good as I was expecting. I thought it would of scared the pants of me, but no. It was some fun and it wasn't all too boring. Their were some good scares but not as much as it should of had. If you are not yet tired of watching a teen film about teens acting stupid and running back and forth from a killer, then you would really enjoy this film. but if you are tired of watching those horror teen flicks, like me, then maybe you won't like this one. Let's just pray that this is the last one! Come on, what else is next, Michael Myers in space?",1026432000,,2579,4.286885245901639
1786554,1,B00006LPHA,"I can now definately say that I am getting old. It seems to me that Hollywood is gearing it's flicks toward younger and younger demographics. While I'm 21 and many may think I'm crazy for saying I'm old, I feel that flicks are made now for the 12 to 17 set. Halloween:Resurrection is another example of how movies are made and marketed to the WWE generation.
This film is not at all good. It's a brutal mess of tired horror cliches. It's not scary as well. It's full of those fake scares that are predictable i.e. shadows, rats. The fake outs tire you before the real thing happens. And when Mikey finally does kill it is boring. It's just a movie that was made for this new up and comming generation who unfortunately have grown up with bloated over-hyped dull flicks.
When was the last time a horror flick scared you? The last time I can think was probably ""Hellbound:Hellraiser 2."" But going back to what I said earlier, kids in 2002 think back to ""The Blair Witch Project"" being the scariest flick they've ever seen, omiting all the late 70's early 80's horror classics.
Halloween:Resurrection is really uneven. It plays out in two parts, the begining starts with Laurie Strode in a mental hospital. Once that really boring unnecessary scene that ultimately destroys what Laurie Strode ever represented is over the flick goes into the main plot. 6 teens are invited to stay in the Myers house. What goes on inside will be broadcast over the internet.
Thats the basic plot. So what could be wrong? This is not a Michael Myers movie we are used to seeing. It has really wierd illogical moments, can you really kill someone with a camera tripod? It also sports some really boring and tired death scenes. It even recycles elements from other horror flicks, the scene in ""Jason Takes Manhattan"" where the black guy steps up to Jason and gets wrecked pretty much happens here. Also when characters say ""See you in hell"" to Mikey, you can't help think about ""A Nightmare On Elm Street 4."" And Michael has lost all of the mystique that he once had. Wasn't it scarier whe we did not know why on earth Michael did what he did? Well now we get some sort of story that he was an abused child. It's just plain foolish. Moustapha Akkad could have definately found someone more capable of writing a better script. Larry Brand's script is really weak.
The acting was not that great. The kids did illogical things like split up often. I am assuming that since they all attend (Haddonfield University) they all grew up in Haddonfield and are well aware of the Myers legend. Why would you split up inside the house?
The movie feeled really rushed, and was edited sloppily. It could have been a much better movie had they spent more time on the script, and casting. Bianca Kajlich is capable, but the scene where she screams and glass breaks was dumb. The subplot about her internet friend went nowhere as well which made no sense since he guided her around while Mikey was chasing her. That was the only good thing about this movie. Having someone not directly involved with whats going on witnessing the carnage, but like i said the subplot went no where. Another sad thing was the way Mikey dispatched his victims. Michael killed everyone Jason style and looked bored.
I will not even discuss Busta Rhymes. He took the film like the total joke that it is. He also came equipped with kung fu moves too. I know that Michael is 45 but how is he going to let Bus-a-bus beat him down?
Producers are you listening to me? Don't make a Halloween 9 like you are planning on doing. It is just beating a dead horse. If you make another Halloween, please find someone who exhibits a true passion for the characters John Carpenter created back in 78. If you look at Avi Arad who runs Marvel, he doesn't sell the rights to his properties unless the filmakers show that they are truly looking to make a good flick, and not a quick buck. You should do the same.
Halloween:Resurrection is a senseless sequel that throws away everything we thought we knew about the Halloween universe. If you are 13, you would probably think this flick was cool. If you like cheesy decapitations and impalings this flick is for you. However if you grew up on real horror flicks including the original ""Halloween"", then you are left feeling unsatisfied.
Is this the best Hollywood can come up with in the year 2002? Is the horror genre finally dead? This film sadly proves it is.",1026432000,,4431,4.560853199498118
1786555,5,B00006LPHA,"I had to travel one town over to see the movie when it opened today and it was well worth my time!  From the moment it started, the action barely let up.  I had made predictions on the plot before going in and it had enough twists in it to make sure I got quite a few of my ideas wrong, which is a wonderful suprise in a movie series that many say has outlived itself.  The acting was above average on the whole and Bianca Kajlich was wonderful!  I'll go out on a limb and say that she did a better job as a heroine in a horror movie than anyone since Jamie Lee Curtis.  I'm looking forward to seeing her career take off like a rocket after this one!  The script was good, the movie was well-made, there were plenty of surprises and squeal inducing moments and I'd go see it again in a heartbeat.",1026432000,,796,4.038216560509555
1786557,3,B00006LPHA,"I just got back from viewing Halloween: Resurrection at my local cineplex and I have to say that overall, I had a good time. I feel that the way the film explained Michael Myers' return was the best it could be done, but after the prologue, I was surprised that the next part just started immediately. After the opening, I was shocked that the credits were placed at the front as opposed to here. I think that would have let Laurie's death sink in a tad more.
The half hour or so after which set up the characters was medicore. Busta's one liners and lame attempts at comedy in this section should have hit the cutting room floor. I am referring to the scene at the front door where he pats his own back. I felt that this film also tried hard to be like Blair Witch 2 with all the characters displaying seperate viewpoints about the nature of evil and the internet.
Once the cast is pretty much killed off, I feel the movie truly lived. Once that Cherry Falls Murphy lookalike lost her head, I felt the movie was back on track and having the main girl's cyber boy helping her was like a horror version of Black Hawk Down (with helping her run this way or that way). I felt that the filmmakers lost a potentially good ending with not having the main girl and cyber boy meet at the crime scene afterwards. Sure it would be improbable, but this is the 8th Halloween film so realism is already gone. Emotionally it would have paid off more.
Busta's line about, ""Trick or treat..."" was diminished by his stuttering of the line and would have been better served by him saying it right after he hangs Michael instead. I do have to say that when he makes his surprise reentrance, I did enjoy Michael's doubletake.
I felt that the director did the best he could, just as he did the best he could with Halloween 2. He seems to find the mood that the current state of horror movies is on and preys on that. His style suited the material and I thought clever at times, like when he cuts to the overhead shot of Michael chasing the camera man, when the camera man said himself that a high angle shot is more scary. His references to the other films was also nice since he helped pave the way for the francise as well. However, when Sean Thomas threw something into Michael's eyes, I wonder if the director remembered that in his own Halloween entry prior, Michael lost his eyes? Curious.
One interesting note is since Dimension took over the series, it is odd that Halloween 6, H20 and now this is all shot pretty much with a stediecam. I know Scream was also like this and while it works, it only works by its director's committment to the material. Otherwise, to have a entire film flow around like they do makes one feel that he or she is on a rollerocoaster that is disposable compared to the feeling of Halloween 1 and many other films. I know John Carpenter used the technique as well but only when it deemed appropiate and not in the slick way it is presented to us now.
Overall, I feel the film is moderately a line over average but better than most of the crap that is pawed off as horror these days.
I still feel H20 was a proper ending to the series, but now that we have this new chapter, I say welcome home, Michael.

1786558,5,B00006LPHA,"1st off.. I was VERY worried what in the world Busta Rhymes was doing in a Halloween flick! ..I caught the 1st showing of opening day and after ending credits rolled- Busta doubters beware! HE DELIVERS and very convincingly! ...I will admit to being somewhat puzzled about the ""chains"" and human remains in the basement.. I would add this installment is very close to Part 6 in the DARKER FEEL- in summary..well worth it, satisfying and can't wait 'til the next time he comes home..",1026432000,,482,4.682352941176471
1786559,5,B00006LPHA,"Let me first just say that Jamie Lee Curtis is the greatest actress ever in horror movie history. Even though she only has a small part in the movie she did a great job. I saw the movie opening day and it was great. This movie is the scariest one of them all. Michael in no where forgiving in killing in this movie. You all know what the movie is albut, 6 studets win a contest and get to spend a night in Michael's house and he comes back. In this movie we learn about Michael a lot more and understand what he went through. I'm not gonna spoil the movie for anyone but let's just say there is going to have to be another movie after this. All the people in this movie are great especially Busta Rhymes and Bianca. Go and see this movie, you won't regret it.",1026432000,,759,4.066666666666666
1786560,4,B00006LPHA,"Ok here is a sequel with peaks & valleys, but I am HAPPY to say many, many, MANY more peaks! There are quite
a few high points in this film, and it does a helluva lot right! Let's start off with the good stuff-
Michael himself:
1st off- The mask is awesome, & that is OH SO important to me! (you can imagine my dislike for the mask in part
5 UGH) 2nd- Brad Loree. I've read in the latest FANGO that he watched all the Halloween movies to prepare for
his role as The Shape and good god does it show! My hat is off to him! He was amazing! DEAD ON! He delivered
perhaps the best Michael in 20 some odd years. Brutal. Machine like. Unstoppable. This man did his homework.
Thank you Mr. Loree, you have ALL of my respect! Michael's @ his ""head tilting, admiring his handiwork, hiding in
the shadows"" best!
Jamie Lee Curtis:
She is wonderful! Her + Myers = Magic! No question! The onscreen time that they share together, (even though
its not very long) ignites the screen. Memorable to say the least!
The Music:
I want to personally thank whomever was responsible for the decision to use not just the main theme, but to use
almost ALL of the original music! It's just about all there & sounding better than ever!
Rick Rosenthal:
He brought all of his tricks with him from part 2. There's is NO question in my mind. This man knows how to do
Halloween. Some really smart camera work & GREAT usage of the internet theme (something I was REALLY
worried about btw) makes for a VERY entertaining bit of film making! The last half an hour of the film is fast
paced & as intense as you could possibly get. Great job Mr. R! Please continue your work in the genre!
The Killings:
Brutal, bloody, fast & furious! ""The Rage"" Michael has inside of him has NEVER been more apparent. The blood
flows freely but is in no way overdone.
The Opening Scene:
For a little over a minute long opening sequence it manages to somehow tie the series together in a very pretty
package. Again, great stuff from Rosenthal.
Now the not so good-
Busta Rhymes:
While for the most part he pulls it off, there are some lines that he flubs horribly, & his fighting scenes with
Michael came off kind of Goofy at times. This is due to him making these kind of mock Bruce Lee fighting screams
during the fight. Although i'll say this, Michaels reaction to Busta's posturing is priceless! The two also share one
of the most memorable scenes in the entire series together.
The storyline:
The Laurie Strode stuff aside, this is without question one of the weakest plots of all of the Halloween films. Yet,
IMO it's still way better than the silliness of parts 5 & 6. I never dug the whole Michael is the enforcer of some
druid cult thing. The makers of those movies went out of their way to explain why Michael was evil. Why he was
evil never mattered to me. I like it better just having him as a killing machine without the backstory. As I stated
before Michael is back in TOP FORM!
The script:
Some lines in this movie are PAINFUL! I needn't quote any, you'll hear them for yourself!
All in all, a worthy entry in the series & easily one of the best sequels to date. Halloween fans will not be
disappointed by this one, although i'm certain some will find alot more things wrong with it than I have. You can't
please everyone. Once again, Michael has come home. More vicious than ever. I'm putting out the Welcome Mat
& running for my life!",1026432000,,3394,4.338050314465409

1786563,4,B00006LPHA,"First off, I am not alone when I say that I'm a true and loyal fan of the Halloween franchise.  The original shocked audiences and set the standard for the typical horror slasher film today.  It contained all the necessary ingredients to compose a stylish, effective horror film.  It contained the eerie musical score, the terrifying supsense of not knowing what was going to happen next (slasher films today are more predictable than surprising), and the creepy setting which all of these events take place.  The many sequels that followed also had success in this, but never quite measured up to the quality of the first.  And now, the highly-anticipated sequel, Halloween: Resurrection, hits theaters on July 12th. The current script reviews provide both positive and negative foreshadowings on what we may expect to be watching on the big screen soon.
One aspect of this film that has been getting mixed reviews is the plot.  Michael Myers has become a world-wide phenomenon.  This perhaps downplays his realistic significance and makes him seem more of a fantasy figure rather than a threat to his unsuspecting victims. This certainly gives Michael the advantage.  The main story is basic and simple: Several teens are offered money and possible publicity to spend the night in the infamous Myers' house during Halloween night.  Many loyal fans have argued a valid point concerning the plot.  This film seems to be ignoring the standard storyline featured in all of the predecessors in which Michael seeks revenge by killing off his bloodline.  Instead, in this film, Michael opts to chase trespassers who are invading his home.  One blood-relative, however, will be featured in this film.  Laurie Strode, played by the wonderful Jamie Lee Curtis, is back, but her presence is rumored just to be a cameo.  In the suspenseful trailer, Laurie is shown uttering the words, ""Michael, I knew you'd come home."" But other than that, why isn't Michael chasing John, Laurie's son?  Michael may be neglecting his bloodline in this film, but wouldn't you also be outraged if unknown invaders were trespassing into your home?
This movie has also been through various titles, and finally ended up with ""Halloween: Resurrection"".  I honestly believe that the previous title, ""Halloween: Homecoming"" was most appropriate to the movie.  It's perfect in regards to the plot, whereas you can slap the name 'Resurrection' onto any movie title basically.
The script review has both positive and negative aspects regarding the film.  But keep in mind, this was just the script review, and since then, there have been many reshots of the film.  Many scenes have probably been cut out, and some, maybe even improvised or added since the script was originally written.
Whether or not this movie will be a promising addition to the Halloween franchise remains to be seen.  But one thing is for sure: Loyal Halloween fans all across the globe are dying to find out, and they will on opening weekend.  And so will I.",1023667200,,2994,4.995967741935484
1786564,3,B00006LPHA,"Halloween, as stated by an earlier reviewer and many other people, had all the right elements that a horror movie should have. Actually, it set up all the right elements any horror movie after it should have contained. Even Halloween's own sequels had some of it's qualities (Scratch Halloween 3 and most of H20). Now, we must sit and wonder if Halloween Resurrection will make us Myers fans happy. Here's my opinion on that:
 The Plot: Michael Myers has finally become a pop-culture icon in his own world. And of course, people milk that for everything it's worth. Like having a internet broadcasted night in the Myers' house with a group of college kids. Whoever ""survives,"" gets a load of cash. It just so happens that Michael hears about all this, and decides to defend his house. Yeah, okay. Absolutely nothing wrong with the plot, except that it takes away from the whole reason Halloween was invented. In the original, Michael had only one intention. To get revenge on his sister, Laurie Strode. This continued throughout the sequel. And so on with Jamie Strode in parts 4 & 5, and with Jamie's son in part 6. H20 completely ignored Jamie Strode's storyline, and went back to getting Laurie herself. All about revenge! Okay, true, it's been known that Laurie Strode finally meets her demise here, but there's still a surviving family member. The script even has Laurie stating ""You will never get my son."" John Strode, played by Josh Hartnett in H20. Why skip over this complete storyline to have Michael kill off a few kids to defend his house? There is the situation that Josh Hartnett would never go back to a Halloween movie after doing such films as Pearl Harbor and Blackhawk Down.
 The Cast: I'm very happy to see Jamie Lee Curtis back! Hopefully, we're surprised and she doesn't die in the first ten minutes. But that may not happen. I'm also happy to see that Bianca Kaljich is the lead. She's always been a favorite underrated star of mine. Other nice additions are Thomas Ian Nicholas (American Pie), Tyra Banks (Coyote Ugly), and Sean Patrick Thomas (Save the Last Dance). Now, I haven't seen him act, but Busta Rhymes? I'm not going to diss this, but I'm not happy about it. Let's just hope when he spits one-lines (And we all know he will), that they're actually funny.
 The Promotional Stuff: I'm talking about the trailer and the poster and the final name for Halloween 8. Let me begin with the name: Halloween Resurrection. It was originally titled Halloween: Homecoming. That was brilliant! And worked really well with the movie's plot. But then, someone thought they were brilliant and replaced Homecoming with Resurrection. It's already been done! Hellraiser: Resurrection and the upcoming sequel to Dracula 2000 called Dracula: Resurrection. Also, I must note, Michael isn't resurrecting. He's not dead.
  On to the poster and trailer. I first saw the trailer when I caught Jason X opening weekend. I was excited to see the trailer because I'd heard it would be there. It was. But I didn't get excited. It's was too formulaic. Much like all of the other critically dissed teen horrors. The only thing that gave me chills (Like movies I want to see usually do) was the appearance of Jamie Lee looking crazy and beginning to make battle with Michael. But the other stuff (Quietness before Michael smashes through a mirror, fake scares, and no revenge storyline) didn't give me anything.
 And now, the poster. The first poster with just Michael and the silhouette of the knife was awesome. Very simple, yet yielded the Halloween mystery and tradition. Then a new poster comes out. We get Halloween H20 : The Poster : The Sequel. Seriously, it's almost identical to H20's poster, except there's silver lining and different faces plastered onto the sheet. And is that the same picture of Jamie Lee, or does she still look the same? I do think that putting their faces in the knife silhouette was a nice touch. Very good.
 I know I've dissed almost every thing to do with the movie, but I'm not hating the idea of the movie. Just the way it is being handled and such. I think I can now saying I'm very critical on the Halloween series. But in the end, I'm still going to see the movie opening weekend, and I still support the movie. Only after seeing Halloween -winces- Resurrection can I give a full opinionated review.",1023667200,3,4342,4.735449735449736

1786568,5,B00006LPHA,"The movie was a bit of a disappointment. I loved Halloween 2 (this has the same director) and this movie has some good things like Halloween 2 did (most scenes with Michael in it are good and the movie is pretty dark) but characters (or lack of good ones) ruin what could have been a very good movie. Busta Rhymes was completely useless here and wasn't needed. Sara had potentional to be a Laurie-like character but was wasted by not getting enough screentime.

The DVD itself is nice for a Halloween DVD release. With the exception of the endless re-releases for the first Halloween, most Halloween DVDs have little to nothing in the extras department. This one has a commentary and extras with cast & crew.

I feel that the movie itself was too edited. It could have benefitted from down moments like the first Halloween did with Michael stalking in the background. There were a couple moments like that in this film but not enough and the ending was a big let-down. Overall an OK movie on par with Halloweens 4-6 but not up to Halloween H20. Extras make the dvd worth owning where story and actors fail to make the movie as good as it could be.

Tyra Banks was nice in her small role, but the insertion of hip-hop was as out of place as hip-hop in a middle american small town (like Haddonfield is SUPPOSED to be). It's like having hip-hop in farming (or neighboring) communities. As I mentioned before Busta Rhymes is not a good actor. Unlike LL Cool J in H20, he just can't pull off being believable as anything but a rapper in movies.

The movie has good points however and can spook you. It has good atmosphere and Rick Rosenthal (the director) is good at keeping things dark as he did in Halloween 2. I think many fans were completely turned off by Laurie's death scene. I accepted it being that the character was in 3 previous movies and served her purpose.",1020297600,,1866,4.479411764705882

The movie about 6 young adults spending the night in the old Myers house for an audience over the internet. Well as you know Michael doesn't take kindly to people lurking around in his house. The movie also wastes no time in getting right into the action and a battle between Laurie Strode and Michael Myers.
In my humble opinion no Halloween movie will ever match the original but if you are a fan of the Halloween movies, Halloween Ressurection is worth a look. When Halloween 9 comes out I'm sure I will check that one out as well.",1017014400,,787,4.472222222222222

I'll tell you why. Because ""In the mouth of madness"" and Halloween H20 were the best of the 90's. In the mouth of madness being the better of the two, that was pure genius.
All that last summer [junk] and Urban legends belongs in a landfill.

1786576,5,B00006LPHA,"I am a huge fan of the Halloween series and i love them all apart from 3 and 5.
The killer in this movie IS Michael Myers because i have read the beginning of the final script and know what happened with his supposed decapitation at the end of Halloween H20.
It will all be explained in a series of flashbacks at the beginning of this movie.
Anyway i know this movie is gonna be great because it has Michael in it so it won't be like 3 and it couldn't possible be any worse than Halloween 5.
The title of this movie has been changed from
Halloween: The Homecoming, it is now called
Halloween: Resurrection and is now scheduled for 19 July 2002 release date.
Don't be surprised if this is put back, i think the release date over here is August 9 now.
Personally i would prefer it to come out in time for Halloween.
Don't miss this movie (or Jason X, which i downloaded and thought was great, the best friday the 13th movie) because it is gonna be AMAZING!!!!(and if it does really well then expect a Halloween 9 in a few years time).

1786578,5,B00006LPHA,"I truly love ""Halloween"" as well as all of it's sequels. Some I favor more than the others, but I still love them, and watch them over and over still to this day. As far as degrading all of its predecessors, why not focus on the fact that despite your doubts and criticisms, every single sequel had you begging for more. Halloween 5 left me waiting (literally) for 6 years for another sequel. I haven't come across any other movie that I care to see a sequel if they made it. Then I saw Halloween 6. Loved it. Didn't like the way it ended, but, I was on the edge of my seat and I left the theater with a puzzled look on my face wondering how they were gonna keep Michael alive for the sequel that was obviously coming. I wanted MORE. But 3 years would pass before I got more. In between those 3 years somewhere, I heard of the producer's cut to Halloween 5. I searched frantically for it...Finally I saw it and couldn't understand why in the world they didn't leave it that way. Why did they do a re-shoot. That would not only have left Steve Miner and friends many more directions to look for a plot, but would have left the entire world in a frenzy wanting to know where Michael was headed. What was his fate? In my opinion, the ending was ""genius"". Where did Dr. Loomis and Dr. Wynn head from there? Sure, Donald Pleasance, God rest his soul, may have died shortly thereafter, but with the right voice makeover and some shadow work, the beginning to H20 would have been a great start to a good movie. And the man known as Dr. Wynn would have been a great add-on to H20. Especially if Michael slipped into an uncontrollable rage and killed him, showing his instability, and showing that he is fed up with chasing his sister. This time he means business. Whoever said that H20 ended perfectly, I'm sorry but ""NO"". How can you say that decapitating him is justification for 20 years of fear. It was too sudden, maybe seeing him burn for good before her very eyes (again) would be better. Yeah, I know he didn't die in H2 either but, that's where you can spawn another sequel without so much controversy as to how he survived. Think about it. Instead of searching and making up ridiculous scenarios, here's a simple one: ""Hmmmmmm, he did survive one fire, maybe he survived this one too. I truly believe that directors and producers with the talent of Steve Miner, would have thought about leaving the ending sequence open in case they DID want to make another sequel. Since when has any ""Halloween"", with the exception of part 3, ended without raising a few eyebrows. Yeah, I know H20 did, but that's what I'm debating. Leaving the ending open is true Halloween style and H20 should not have been an exception. Speaking of Lindsey Wallace, where did she disappear to? Yet again, the people in charge should have gone all the way back and brought back some key players, if they were gonna do so many re-shoots. They may have been able to pull off a better plot and premise. These are my opinions. If you think about them, I'm sure we'll agree somewhere.
I'm back and wanted to edit my review becasue I read it and realized that there were a couple of other parts that I would like to emphasize.
1. For all the critics (and there are a lot) out there, believe this: ""Halloween"" has it's own style. And it was self-made. Props to Moustapha Akkad and Co. My point is, you don't go out and get superstar rappers and models to be in a film that has built a great reputation. George Lucas might as well forget about production on Episode 2 and hire Eminem to be the young Luke Skywalker and reshoot the entire movie. Get it? It just does not fit!! What was, and still is in my eyes, a spectacular horror film can now be ruined. Just like the return of Michael Jordan, his career and legend could have gone down the drain had he not had a great year. But to say the least he did live up to the expectations, however he did not succeed them. Case and point, At worst this movie must at least live up to the Halloween legend that has been set for greatness.
2. Dwelling on point one, the director and his team should have found some unknown talent and hired them to play roles of other characters of the past Halloween's. That being a second to actually finding the same person who played in the original which would have made it that much better. The original Lindsey Wallace would have been a perfect addition. Much like the nurse in part one was the same nurse at the beginning of H2O. Classic. Even though Tommy Doyle was played by another person, it worked and it fit well. The key role players made it work because the had enough history and background to make the film work. Look at it this way. Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance were what made Halloween great. When Jamie Lee was out of the picture, who did the weight shift to? Donald Pleasance. That bought time for more key players, Ellie Cornell and Danielle Harris to make a name for themselves and have their own storyline. Then when it was time for Pleasance to pass on, the weight shifted back onto Jamie Lee's shoulders, and I should say she carried it magnificently. The character of Jamie Lloyd met her demise early in part 6, but that was only fitting, due to the fact that she was not played by Danielle Harris. Had it been Danielle Harris that played Jamie, it would have been great to see where her story fit in to the puzzle she helped create. She was old enough to play the role of Jamie at the time of production, so why she didn't take the job will remain a mystery to me.",1014681600,,5543,4.366892545982575

And boy, Plesence must be turning in his grave thinking about that they are making, yet another sequal, to the series that was ended perfectly. I mean, im not a huge fan of the 90's horror scene (Its all 80's for me AKA: Freddy, Friday the 13TH) But even the ending to H20 was great. Laurie finally gets Michael, she decapitates him!!!!!! But these money hungrey stupid hollywood producers can get enough money can they!! The series was just fine the way it ended, now they have to get a rapper (Busta Rymes) and a Supper Moddle (Tyra Banks), to take the place of Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Plesence (The perfect duo!)??!!! I am anoyed at Curtis for even taking a cameo in this film. Dosen't she or anybody else in hollywood realise that Michael Myers was perfectly fine, dead and decapitated???!! I'm seeing it when it comes out...just for kicks. To see if (on the extreme off chance) it actually lives up to the series (which I don't think it will.) Lets just wait and see.

1786581,1,B00006LPHA,"I've been a follower of Halloween since the first film. I've read the reviews, and discussed the films to death, and all I can say right now is... Halloween 8 doesn't look good.
Firstly, let's clarify and correct a couple of things people have said in previous reviews... because this misinformation can sway you if you're not a hardcore follower of the series.
* Halloween H20 (Part 7) did not negate or ignore the other parts in the series, namely part 4,5 and 6. It simply switched tracks. Part 4,5 and 6 all focused on Jamie Lloyd (Michael's niece) and the Strode family in part 6. Jamie because as far as we the audience (and Michael presumably) were aware, she was the only surviving family member. And the Strode family as they were residing in Michael's house. Of course, there was also Jamie's baby in part 6... but depending on which version of Halloween 6 you watch (yes, there is a producer's cut aswell), this plot element takes you in 2 different directions.
- Of course in Halloween H20, we simply switch back to Laurie Strode, (this is not necessarily negating or ignoring the other parts)... and we learn that she simply faked her death to evade Michael.
* We don't know at this time that Michael didn't get his head cut off in part 7. Some have speculated that it would be someone else in the mask. How stupid is this? if you're trying to kill someone, where's the logic in disguising someone else as you while you ""escape""? that's not trying to kill someone is it?
- And even if it was someone else, why didn't that person speak to Laurie or remove thier mask as they stood there pinned to the tree branch by the van? They did have use of thier arms afterall.
...So now we come to Halloween 8...
Until this point, we've always had 1 or 2 characters that have been key characters to the reality of the series. We've had Loomis (Michael's doctor), Laurie (Michael's first original target), Jamie Lloyd and her baby (Remaining family) and Tommy Doyle (Kid turned Druid expert most relevant in part 6).
All these characters in thier respective films have been essential to the strength of each Halloween movie. Without them... it would just be another stupid shallow teen slasher and would not have any of the mystique of Halloween.
So what do we have to look foward to in H8? Well... considering that H20 was done is the modern PG rated non-gore low-scare teen slasher style, and that this time around we have no Loomis, Jamie or Tommy... It doesn't look good. We've got a model and a rapper I hear. Great, so it's going to be a stepping stone movie to improve the credentials of these 2 individuals. Actors make the best actors, not models or musicians.
Even with Laurie (who is *rumoured*... and I stress *rumoured* going to die early in the film), the movie is going to struggle because the entire developement of the film revolves around her actions. Afterall... Michael's one goal is to kill her, his part is a simple one where he is a pawn to the curse of thorn. H20 struggled because of this. And H8 will too.
They're going to really have to pull the cat out of the bag on this one to stop the movie from alienating it's original fans and sending the whole franchise down the gurgler.",1012521600,3,3207,4.521514629948365

1786591,3,B00006LPHA,"The original ""Halloween"" back in 1978 was without any doubt one of the greatest movies of all time. Why? Chilling atmosphere, impressive music score, great actors....it embodied everything. Now, twenty-three years later after its release, we get the 8th instalment in this immortal series. Even though I`m never and never will be tired of Michael Myers and his mindless killings, I sincerely have my doubts if this one would live up to the expectations. A number of reasons justify my preoccupations:
1.) Director Rick Rosenthal ( who previously directed Halloween 2 back in 1981) has NO idea about what Halloweens 3 to 6 were all about. He even declared that he never even saw them in his whole life. This can bring about gaps in the story-line; the same thing that happened with H20. And hard-core fans of the series won`t obviously be pleased.
2.) Jamie-Lee Curtis is back in playing Laurie Strode! That would be terrific news if it wasn`t for the fact that Laurie is killed in the first part of the movie! Why would the producers resurrect her character in H20 just to kill her again in H8? It just doesn`t make sense.
3.) The movie itself, as you`d expect, is proving to have nothing to do with the original in terms of quality. Whereas Halloween 1 successfuly managed in creating atmosphere and suspense all throughout; this one is proving to be just a ""Scream"" imitator, with the internet now playing needlessly an important and complicated part in the movie. In fact, the plot circles around a bunch of dudes holding an internet chat in the Myers` house. Were did all the simplicity of the original go?
4.) The main actors in the movie (other than Curtis), are everything rather than promising: Tyra Banks (profession model), and Busta Rhymes (profession rapper)  are going to take the lead this time `round. Of course, being a beautiful woman or a good music performer does not make you a good actor, does it? Surely, a far cry from Donald Pleasence.
I`m not ruining anyone`s enthusiasm here. As I have said, I`m a big fan of Michael and of Halloween; but there are some factors which really are everyting but satisfying. Let`s hope no one is disappointed.",1000684800,22,2165,4.757978723404255
1786592,2,B00006LPHA,"I just wanted to tell everyone how Michael Myers survived the head chop thing. ;)
I knew from the minute we saw Myers in H20 that it wasn't Michael Myers. Just look at him. You can clearly see his eyes. They made such a big deal out of his eyes in the first Halloween (and also in the pre-movie narration from Loomis in H20), about how the eyes are black, void of anything. And we CLEARLY saw his eyes in H20.
So it wasn't Michael Myers. And for the inevitable ""what about his being invincible"" argument, well, chasing people who think you're the antichrist is going to give you a huge adrenaline rush.
That's all. So stop bitching about it because he got ""decapitated."" Start bitching about it because it's a Blair Witch Project rip off that came 3 years too late and another installment to a movie series that stopped being good over 20 years ago.",999475200,4,849,4.414012738853503
