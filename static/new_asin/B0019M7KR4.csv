8274636,1,B0019M7KR4,"Absolutely the worst movie I've ever seen, and I really like David Carradine. I can't believe that he was associated with this horrible thing.",1437696000,,142,4.958333333333333
8274637,4,B0019M7KR4,The opening sequence in this cheesy ultra low budget hoot was totally ripped off in the latest Mad Max movie.,1435708800,,109,4.5
8274638,3,B0019M7KR4,This was a good thou confusing film.  The action was fast & furious; using sex to distract people from the jumpiness of the film.,1375142400,3,129,4.375
8274639,2,B0019M7KR4,OK I Just checked the Mail today and got my Package only to find out that the Movie that is Pictured above with David Carradine is not the one I got instead I got Some Dumb Chinese Martial Arts Movie.to whoever Orders this Movie be sure your getting the Right One otherwise you'll get Screwed now I have to Return Mine.,1372032000,,319,4.245901639344262
8274640,3,B0019M7KR4,It's the Fredmeister and his familiar crew doing what they do best (work the best they can with no budget or time).,1363651200,,115,4.2727272727272725
8274641,4,B0019M7KR4,This movie is a war movie with Aliens--it was in great shape as old as it is and the Price was right too. Its an action movie with some Funny parts in the movie.,1344556800,3,161,3.764705882352941
8274642,5,B0019M7KR4,"Typical David Carradine film,only problem the film print is quite soft for a DVD,
in fact my VHS tape is a lot sharper.
 Recommended though for fans of David.",1310428800,3,158,4.448275862068965
8274643,4,B0019M7KR4,"Very Good movie to have, is a Rare Collection Item.

Now it has a place in my DVD Collection Room.",1271462400,3,98,3.9
8274644,3,B0019M7KR4,"David Carradine has never let a project's budget

(or in this case, lack thereof!) stop him from

earning a paycheck. Mr. 'Kill Bill' did very

well in this likeable cheapie from the Roger

Corman American Independent studios, 'Straight-

to-Video-since-the-drive-Ins-went-the-way-of-

the-buffalo' set. Dawn Wildsmith (she was very

good in Armed Response and Future Force as well),

Sid Haig (who doubles here as Second Unit Direc-

tor!), Robert Quarry and even flat-chested Brink

Stevens pull off good performances in a movie w/

so little Special Effects that it makes Mad Max

look like A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE STUDIO RELEASE!

Carradine is always worth a look and WHAT THE

HELL has happened to WILDSMITH since the end of

eighties three-pics-in-a-row w/ Mr. Kung Fu?

(Can anybody still get me her number? Wow she

looks great in that outfit in the tent when she's

being held hostage!) Worth a watch. But not as

good as Deadly Surveillance!",1135987200,4,950,5.091503267973856
