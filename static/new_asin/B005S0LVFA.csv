8578539,5,B005S0LVFA,"I got to be an extra in this film when it filmed scenes in Sacramento, so I'm a bit biased. It is not my favorite of Siddharth's films, which is like saying it is not my favorite diamond, but working with him was a joy. He was both professional and incredibly accessible and respectful of actors and crew at all levels. And honestly, he is such a beautiful man that he could just stand there and make watching him still worthwhile. Fortunately he is also a gifted actor, writer, and director. If you watch the film, there is a scene between Siddarth and his leading lady, Priya Anand, in front of a bluish-green glass-fronted building at 300 Capital Mall.  (Priya is a talented actress, singer, and dancer, and a real sweetheart in person, by the way, and almost as pretty as Siddarth!) Behind the two leads in this scene in front of the building is a middle aged businessman  with a red/gray goatee and mustache talking on a cell phone. That's me! They had to tuck my long, red, hippy hair under the collar of my suit coat. The film uses some magical/folkloric visuals to emphasize the real-life romantic content, which might be a bit different for American viewers, though American and European filmmakers and theater productions are more and more experimenting with this type of ""magical realism,"" so this would be a good introduction. By the way, Siddarth's last name is ""Suryanarayan,"" though for  connoisseurs of Bollywood and Tollywood, that's a bit like asking what Madonna's or Cher's last name is. And, Siddarth, if you ever read this, I am deeply sorry I was not able to make that squeeling stop in my car in the scene in which you step out into traffic! Every time we (the stunt driver in the next lane and I) backed up and waited for ""Action!"" I kept thinking, ""I'm going to run over the 'Brad Pitt of India' and be hated for all time!"" I am okay that you had to cut me and my car and my whimpy stop from the final film. You're alive, and that's all that matters!",1426982400,,1976,4.4986072423398324
