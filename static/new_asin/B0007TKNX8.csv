8051502,2,B0007TKNX8,"4 DVDs.  All are interviews of Robert Dean with 3 authors.  If you're looking for photos of UFOs or science or facts they aren't here.  Discs 1-2 are an interview with Neil Freer discussing mostly Zecharia Sitchin's ideas.  Disc 3 is an interview with Michael Mannion about his book Project Mindshift.  Disc 4 is an interview with Philip Krapf about his book: A Journalist's Encounter with Aliens.  According to Krapf, he was taken aboard a large ufo stationed on the dark side of the moon where he saw 100s of people undergoing medical experiments.  He did not undergo any experiments but was chosen as a sort of deputy ambassador to help earth people prepare us for encounters with extraterrestrials and living with other species in the universe.",1417392000,3,748,4.84251968503937
