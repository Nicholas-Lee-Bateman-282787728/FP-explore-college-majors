8247611,4,B0012SANTW,"I have tried some of instructor Bernadette Giorgi's Pilates DVDs, so I thought I might enjoy this one as well, especially given that I enjoy both Pilates and ballet workouts.  This DVD is subtitled as being for ""over 50"" fitness--I'm 47, so I figured that I was close enough.  Giorgi leads a group of four background exercisers who do appear to be in their late 40s or 50s.  These women are fit and performed the routines well enough, but I found them to be oddly unsmiling and somewhat mechanical in performance during the workouts.  I was also thrown a bit by the setting, which is a large, airy space with ersatz barn doors to one side that I've seen in other fitness videos, usually cardio-type ones; this type of studio just did not seem to fit with the more relaxed vibe of this barre and Pilates routines presented here.

The Main Menu of this DVD offers the following options:  Introduction (a brief overview by Giorgi) - Form Pointers - Workout 1 - Workout 2 - Premixes - Credits.  In the Form Pointers segment (10.5 minutes), Giorgi uses one of the background exercisers to demonstrate some of the main moves used in the routines, including 1st position, 2nd position, 4th position, 5th position, and tendu.  I have described each of the additional segments in greater detail below.

WORKOUT 1
This workout is approximately 40 minutes long.  It starts with a warm-up (about 3 minutes), which consists of simple pli&eacute;s and side stretches.  Centre barre is next.  These are traditional ballet moves, although an actual ballet barre is not used.  Rather, Giorgi takes you through sets of pli&eacute;s and relev&eacute;s, working from the various ballet positions.  In-between every set, Giorgi cued two grand pli&eacute;s as a ""rest""--these began to feel somewhat tedious.  However, I enjoyed the balance work, which included develop&eacute;s to each side and combination moves.  The next section was weighted work, or centre ball.  Giorgi and friends use a weighted ball, sometimes in one hand, sometimes in both hands.  Although I actually have a small 4-pound medicine ball, I found it easier to use my 2-pound ""s-shaped"" weights, as I could use these in either one or both hands depending on the exercise.  There is about 20 minutes of Pilates matwork, and then a brief stretch concludes the workout.

WORKOUT 2
The second routine is very similar to the first, starting with almost the same warm-up.  The centre barre segment is a bit more intense here, although again, Giorgi includes the two grand pli&eacute;s between sets, which slows down the workout.  She performs full pli&eacute;s with cat stretches in-between as well as develop&eacute;s with kicks forward, a nice move requiring balance.  The center barre work is fairly short (5 minutes) and includes compound moves such as lift front with lunge, triceps push rear, side pli&eacute;s with high bicep curl, and alternating side balance (no weights).  There was a similar Pilates matwork segment (again about 20 minutes), and the short stretch including just a few moves such as Mermaid, a twist, and a heel stretch, bringing the tool workout time in at about 37 minutes.

As noted above, this DVD has several premixes.  These combine various segments of the two main workouts as follows:

ATTITUDE BARRE, 37:40 minutes
warm-up, Workouts 1 & 2, Centre Barre Work, Stretch

ATTITUDE BALL, 24:10 minutes
warm-up, Workouts 1 & 2, Center Ball Work, Stretch

ATTITUDE MAT, 31:00 minutes
warm-up, workout 1 & 2 mat work, stretch

ATTITUDE ADVANCED, 68:00 minutes
warm-up, workouts 1 & 2 all sections and stretch

Overall, I did like these routines.  There are several things that make this DVD worthwhile, including the variety of ballet moves and the premixes.  However, it could have been better--although Giorgi is a good instructor, she does not mirror cue here, and her background exercisers are unenthusiastic at best.  Furthermore, while this workout is gentle, it is also extremely low energy--it would have been nice if Giorgi had taken things up a notch.  So, I would recommend this DVD, but my final rating is limited to 3 1/2 stars.",1445731200,,4114,4.973645680819912
8247612,5,B0012SANTW,"This perfect mix of ballet, pilates, and stretching has become my favorite way to start my day. This is a total body workout, you will feel this in your core, your butt, yours legs, your tris, bis, everything! This workout certainly targets to strengthen, elongate and create that leaner body we all want. It's amazing that while getting in a really great workout, the entire time you always feel relaxed, graceful and peaceful... all the things we love about pilates and yoga. I don't know why this DVD would be targeted at women 50+, I'm 27 and I absolutely love it!",1351728000,,568,4.633663366336633
8247613,5,B0012SANTW,I love Bernadette's exercise dvd's.  I now have 3 and this one is not as easy as you may think.  You are taken through grande plie's and the ballet positions.  The only thing missing is the barre.  That would be way to taxing for these old bones!  Bernadette uses perfect form in every dvd.  I appreciate her calm voice and exact instructions.  You workout fluidly without having to listen to a lot of instructions first and get cold.  I love this woman!!!,1284163200,2,456,4.475609756097561
8247614,5,B0012SANTW,"Not realizing this was marketed for ""beyond 50"", I found this to be appropriate for someone, say in their early 40s who is eager to learn basic ballet, move in a slower, easier pace, and who doesn't mind being in the company of mature women.  The whole production is relaxed and ballet-inspired from Ms. Giorgi's soothing voice to the piano music.  If you are learning ballet, there is a option called ""Form Pointers"", like a tutorial of the most important positions that you'll be using.

There are 2 30-minute workouts that both consist of STANDING, CENTER WORK W/RESISTANCE (they used a mini weighted ball), and MAT WORK (also with resistance).  In standing work, Ms. Giorgi will lead you through plies, tendus, grand plies, and ballet foot positions.  So, know before you go.  Center work with resistance consists of multi-step moves such as a plie, bicep curl then a side bend. In mat work, it's always optional to have resistance.  Core work is the focus here by doing Pilates-based sit-ups or roll ups.  Even the stretching and warm-up feel like the workout because you continue to move in a fluid fashion with ballet or Pilates.",1274486400,2,1136,4.819587628865979
8247615,4,B0012SANTW,"This workout was somewhat different from others I've done. It has more of a ballet feel, including the terminology used and the music. I like Bernadette; she is very soft-spoken, yet really knowledgeable about selecting effective moves. She uses a 2 pound ball in some of the moves, but this is optional; most of the work comes from your own body weight. Despite the ballet moves, no barre is required. This DVD is well-chaptered; in addition to the 2 regular workouts there were premixes which made it even more useful to me. While working out with Bernadette, I felt graceful, which is very unusual. Afterward, my muscles felt stretched and strengthened, and I was much more conscious of my posture. Bernadette's encouragement is definitely empowering, and makes working out with her on this DVD something to look forward to, not dread.",1265846400,3,838,4.950354609929078
8247616,5,B0012SANTW,"I love this workout. I actually felt like an 8-year-old little girl in her first ballet class. Then the next day, my NOT 8-year-old muscles reminded me that I'd worked out. Love that! Bernadette again uses her soft velvet voice to motivate you and gently boot your behind into action. I am very happy I bought her DVDs, which I did based on other reviews, by the way.",1254355200,4,367,4.411764705882353
8247617,4,B0012SANTW,"The only reason I give this DVD 4 stars instead of 5 is because I have to be in the mood for it.  But when I'm in the mood, it rates 6 stars.

I agree with all of Amazon Fan's comments, particularly that it is somewhat similar to Element Ballet but more ""forgiving.""  However, whenever I reach for Attitude - and that's usually on a day when I'm suffering a tension headache or am just too tired for cardio - it relaxes and renews me.  After some hard work, that is.  I pop it in and start relaxing to the soft music and Bernadette's whispery, gentle instructions then suddenly realize I've broken a mild sweat and my legs are trembling.  The addition of the light weighted ball or handweight for two of the center barre segments and Pilates mat work are a nice change from the ordinary.

A word on the Pilates portions - Bernadette assumes you have a bit of background and does not give blow by blow tutorials.  Personally, I'm happy about that.  I can just flow with these routines and don't feel that I have to rigidly adhere to barked out instructions.  This is a user friendly DVD.

Another good feature is that no ballet barres or special equipment is required - not even a chair.  This might be a good choice for the home exerciser who wants to add some barre to their crosstrain regimine without making investments in equipment - and space.  Nicely done.",1233100800,13,1362,4.421686746987952
8247618,5,B0012SANTW,"Although it's advertised for women over 50 I think anyone seeking an intermediate workout can enjoy it.  The workout is similar to the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Element-Ballet-Conditioning/dp/B000WC38BO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Element: Ballet Conditioning</a>&nbsp;but a wee bit more forgiving, plus there's a little more emphasis on arm and upper body strengthening and no plyometric jumping.  The pace of the ballet and pilates exercises will benefit your aerobic conditioning because it elevates your heart rate.  There are two 40-minute workouts to choose from plus a variety of pre-mixes depending on your interest.  A separate chapter demonstrates form pointers.  Cuing is clear and the instructor always lets you know what's coming up next.  The only equipment required is a light weight ball (or 1-2 pound dumbbells) and floor mat; shoes are not required. Head-to-toe lengthening and toning, well designed, well cued, well demonstrated, nice music, pleasant instructional tone - this video has it all. I also like the little inspirational blurbs that occasionally appear on screen, and I sure hope I look as good as the demonstrators do when I hit 50!",1207958400,16,1211,5.931034482758621
