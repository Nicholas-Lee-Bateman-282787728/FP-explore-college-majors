I did go to the scene selections and chose the final scene to see if maybe the end was okay. Not really. I am not sure what was in between, but I can't think of much that would interest me on this one. I guess I should have had an idea when I looked it up here on Amazon and see the lack of any description at all. I guess that's why I went ahead with this review. Maybe it will help someone who wonders about it too. I would venture a guess and say there is no description because there is not much to describe. Sometimes even the best ideas need work. Too bad this one was left ""in construction"".",1358208000,4,725,3.87248322147651
