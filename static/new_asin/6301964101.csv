7817769,4,6301964101,"Andy Hardy's Double Life brings a shift to the Andy Hardy series. Andy (Mickey Rooney) has decided to go to college and is trying to tie up loose ends before he is off. He has decided to break it off with Polly (Ann Rutherford) though trying to be aloof ends with the two becoming engaged. Not only that, but Polly's friend (Esther Williams) uses Andy for her psychology studies and winds herself as Andy's fiancee too. Also, Andy tries to sell his old car to pay for the transportation of his new car to his town. Judge Hardy (Lewis Stone) has his own problems. He is trying to solve a case involving a little boy (Robert Blake) so he can accompany his son to his old alma mater.

Everything seems all mixed up, but it all comes out right in the end. These films were a wonderful example of what people wanted America to be. They aren't corny, but everything always seems to come out perfect and happy. However, real issues are addressed. The relationships between the characters are admirable like that of Andy and his father; their man to man talks about various problems are important pieces of the show.

The true star of the show is Mickey Rooney, an incredible talent with a youthful enthusiasm and an ageless charm.",1151712000,,1223,4.529411764705882

He loves girls, he's popular, he's funny, he's fickled...

Andy Hardy is a walking problem. He has a talent for getting in to trouble!!

But you just have to like him!!

These are the treasured movies that no one makes anymore! Which is a shame!!

As you know, Andy Hardy thinks he's so mature now. He hasn't seen Polly (Ann Rutherfurd) in ages, and he thinks he doesn't have a care in the world.

That is, until one day, when Polly calls, and invites Andy over to her house to try her new swimming pool. Andy accepts.

And then goes to his sister(Celia Parker)  for advice on what to say. He doesn't really think he is in love with Polly anymore.

She gives him some advice that will ""Chill"" any girl. So, the next day Andy is at Polly's door, ringing the doorbell.

And when he sees her again, he tells her the things that his sister Marion told him. And then he tells her he has lost all interest in girls.

Polly, upset, and angry decides to teach that boy a lesson. So she brings down her beautiful visiting guest Sheila (Esther Williams). And she goes right to Andy.

So, somehow they both get engaged to Andy. And Andy is supposed to leave for college!!! What a mess!

The girls teach Andy a lesson, but I will not tell you how, and how it ends. You must see it!

This is one of the best of the set!

This really is a great family movie, and I reccomend it HIGHLY, for and Andy Hardy fan, or anyone who simply wants to see it!",1103587200,6,1477,4.225
