8174939,5,B000LOI7M8,"This video was the most highly praised Salsa videos on the Salsa Message boards in 2001. Every message poster had nothing but praise for this video.

This video is the sequel to the popular Cool Moves 2 video. This video is packed full of moves/ routines/ demos.

They are very good value. The moves are a mix of LA, NY, Cuban steps. All the moves can be incorporated into LA or NY style. The moves produce a good flow.

The most important thing about the moves taught is that they are leadable & followerable without warning. The male can just lead a female that knows these turns without any tips or warnings.

Eric Freeman has provided a very detailed & accurate review of these videos on his site.

I would class the level as very good beginners to intermediate with some advanced . Most people would class this video as intermediate to advanced.

(Note: My grading standard is a lot higher than most as I have to provide scope for the very complex advanced moves not been taught in any video yet. By this I mean the advanced flips used in performance Salsa.)

I highly recommend these videos.",1167782400,,1097,4.51010101010101
