8511165,5,B0076T7VSC,"The author of ""A Journey in Search of Korea 's Beauty"", which is based this documentary, Bae Yong Joon, is as multifaceted as intelligent, spiritual, noble and humble, and I assure you that I consider this with all seriousness and honesty. Beyond that he is a famous public figure in East Asia, this is not the reason I will give you to read his book or watch his documentary. Fame is not necessarily a passport to the heart, and beyond into the soul of the human. In my opinion, what if it is, is the purity, nobility and kindness that someone can develop their vocation in life, as he has done, and offer this to the world as the best gifts. De that is the book that is both originated this documentary, as the documentary itself.
You who read this review will wonder why you see this documentary? Why see the beauty of an Oriental country can be interesting for me? Why South Korea and no other destination? What great saves ""A Journey in Search of Korea's Beauty ""? And I answer you, and really this is just my humble recommendation! Do it to experience what it is to witness and feel the love and devotion that someone can have him to the place where he was born and raised, their country, their roots, their history. But I also recommend you to do a general culture so overwhelmingly the improved view of the world and of human beings. You might also say that you see out of curiosity, you might want to know whether or Bae Yong Joon is such a great writer and photographer and actor. If you know his work you know what I 'm talking about.
Love and devotion to Korean traditions and culture in general, which the author professes his country are so large and profound that manages to seed it anywhere in the world, in the heart of anyone sensitive enough to afford love beyond time, distance or language.
As with the book, my motivation to see this documentary, somewhat exceeded my reason, and I tell you this because I did it, whether it were spoken in Korean and subtitled in Japanese. I assure you the love and moving spirit of art that move and motivate this project are sufficient guarantee that no language is needed to understand the documentary capture you, moves you, you can understand and enjoy it at its best. On the contrary, it represents an incredible adventure for your senses. In fact my native language is Spanish.
In this documentary you will find the same theme expressed in the book: traditions and Korean culture, kimchi and their food, the tradition of tea, hanbok, the hanji, the hanok, black lacquer, ceramics, drinks, music, Hangeul, etc. But in addition to enjoy the journey of Bae Yong Joon with his team, which find two of the videos, you will have the incredible opportunity to enjoy first-hand the journey performed for twelve bold, dreamers, and adventurers brave book readers captivated by post self initiated "" A Journey in Search of Korea 's Beauty "". Their journey covers 4 of the 6 DVDs that make up the documentary. It really is wonderful to flourish as accomplished writer 's dream in the heart of people who do not even know the author when reading his book. It is wonderful to witness the emotions expressed by these travelers from various expressions of art. It is wonderful to see how diverse these travelers yet it can be so similar that the human being when connected with that which goes beyond their own humanity.
So ... finally, think no more, confident and charming for some fortuitous reason you find yourself reading this review I have written for you sincerely. I'm going to take the liberty to quote you a thought of the book, written by its author, wisely I think expresses the purpose of the project: ""There is a dream I really wish would come true, and I am working towards it little by little. At this moment, in which I dream my own dream, I am happy to be able to dream"" (Bae Yong Joon)
Thanks, I hope you enjoy it as much as me. May God bless you.",1394496000,,3914,4.514084507042254
