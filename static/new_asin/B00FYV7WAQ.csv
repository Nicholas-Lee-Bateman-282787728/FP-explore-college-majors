One guy is so smitten by a girl he will do ANYTHING to get her attention and as he does, she falls in love with him. Kind of creepy as he stalks her facebook page, but it works out well in the end as he comes clean. Worth the money to rent. Sweet story, wish it lasted longer.",1386720000,3,372,3.844155844155844

6040251,5,B00FYV7WAQ,"""A Case of You"" is a quiet little romantic comedy for the Internet age.  It's about a struggling writer named Sam, played by Justin Long, that one day meets what he believes is the girl of his dreams in Birdie, played by Evan Rachel Wood, at his local coffee shop.  Rather than just pursue her, Sam decides to find her on Facebook and find out everything and anything that he can about her so that he could mold himself into the perfect man for her.

For me, it is the Facebook twist that makes this movie interesting as it has become increasingly easy for relative strangers to find out some very intimate things about someone without them divulging the information directly.  Ten years ago if you met someone new and they liked the same bands as you or the same authors as you then you knew you had something in common.  Now, that has all changed and instead you could just be dealing with someone that has seen your profile online.

The movie does a good job of showing Sam as a well-intentioned guy who just doesn't have a whole lot of skill with the ladies instead of putting him into the Internet stalker category.  I found myself rooting for him to come out of the shadow of the guy he created and to just be himself.

The movie has an excellent supporting cast with Vince Vaughn, Sam Rockwell,Sienna Miller, Brendan Fraser and Busy Philipps making appearances.

This is a story that has, in one way or another been told before BUT this time it is told with humor, caring and just plain love. boy meets girl, boy looks at girls facebook page and tries to model himself after what she wrote as the ideal man. The judo classes were hysterical. Justin Long has an easy sweetness that just makes you want to hug him and ditzy freebird girl Evan Rachel Wood is just too cute.

6040264,2,B00FYV7WAQ,"This movie is your cliched boy meets girl scenario,

Sam an aspiring writer (who only gets hired by production companies to write books based on pre existing movies such as teen wolf) is struggling to create his own original content and creating a name for himself besides being known as a hacker writer. One day he meets Birdie a cashier at a local coffee shop, and you guessed it he gets intrigued, interested, finds her on Facebook, stalks her on Facebook and create a character for himself based on what he thinks is the man of her dreams from the information he could find on Facebook. The only problem is she gets fired from the coffee shop so he had to find another way to communicate with her and see her in person and so he does through Facebook. They meet, talk, go for a walk and finally start dating, get to know each other better, kiss, sleep together, do hobbies together and etc... falls in love? But will she love the real him? or the person she thinks is him.

Well, the issue I had with this problem is this, lack of originality. This is your cookie cutter of a romantic movie. The lead male character breaks up with the female character 15 min to the end of the film. So convinced that she doesn't know him and only loves what she think he is. Then after finishing off his book who is based on his relationship with Birdie he realises that she's the love of his life and they should be together and just runs back to her, confronts his feelings, confronts the truth and guess what? she already knew he was basing himself off her Facebook page but she still had feelings for him awww so so sweet. *sarcasm*

The cast is lovely, the characters though not so much. Sam like every other male has commitment problems yet does not want to die alone. Those commitment problems aren't exactly explained, has he had his heart broken? has his mother leaving him and his father had anything to do with it? He was too eager to have Birdie so why be so eager to leave her behind without a second glance? after all what he did to make her like him? Why walk away? and most importantly why have low self esteem and not just present yourself as you instead of someone else? Why was he so surprised when she said she loved him? And most importantly why did she love him?

Too much questions, plot holes and thoughts come to mind. I know I know it's just a movie but Sam wasn't likeable as a character. He was too self absorbed, and too proud to admit his feelings as well as having very little confidence. Birdie on the other hand was all over the place going from one hobby to the other without having to do much work if any at all. Painting people in the street can hardly pay off your mortgage, rent, taxes, Dance classes etc... Come on! She comes across as a free spirit hippie with little to no security and worries in life. Too unrealistic.

In the end of the day, this movie wasn't funny. It was watchable but surely boring. I had no network connection and this was in my files so I watched it to waste my time and it did eventually. That should be it's only purpose.

The visuals were pretty enough and it had a vintage outlook so I guess that explains the 2 stars? Otherwise, the plot gets 0 from me.",1396224000,3,3211,4.316749585406302
6040265,4,B00FYV7WAQ,I am in this movie as a dancer. I always want the movies I act in or dance in so I like the movie,1394755200,2,97,3.0833333333333335
6040266,5,B00FYV7WAQ,I've seen many Evan Rachel Wood films and this is by far her best. Her facial expressions and mannerisms are enchanting and endearing. The romance throughout most of the movie is typical in a romantic comedy but the ending was pleasantly sweet. See it if you are a hopeless romantic.,1394150400,,283,4.68
6040267,2,B00FYV7WAQ,This movie was not good. And I really like justin long. But the story was recycled and the love interest was played out and stale. I couldn't even get through the whole movie. Big disappointment. The best part was Peter Dinklage.,1393200000,2,229,4.609756097560975
6040268,4,B00FYV7WAQ,"In A CASE OF YOU, our writer friend, Sam thinks he must get a girl. So in order to get her he pretends as though all her interests and likes are his likes and dislikes. He does so because he thinks she is totally out of her league.

When I watch Indie films and see things go wrong for a young protagonist, I often think it is a bit forced and think oh my God, why do actors to pretend this John Cera like awkwardness about them?

Justin Long has no such pretentious demeanor in his portrayal of SAM. I was laughing out loud. There are some really exclusive funny scenes with Peter Dinklage (he is absolutely brilliant in his short role, no pun) and even Sam Rockwell who I mostly can't stand. Even Brendon Frazer has a nice five minutes.

I liked the acting a lot. You have to make them believable in comedy and forced self deprecation. This is where A CASE OF YOU truly shines and comes to its own. I can't figure the low rating on imdb. This is far more real than other indie films that hollywood churned out in 2013. It also has a great point but let me not bore you into that.

If I could change something about the film I'd change the approach to the end, the last scene was somehow pulverised by an element of cliched cheesyness which most of the film entirely lacked. I'd still give it four stars.

And the actress? She's cute. Go watch!",1392422400,2,1345,4.217898832684825
6040269,3,B00FYV7WAQ,"Watchable but no conflict; lack of chemistry between leads.  Story does not explain why Justin's character would fall over himself chasing the female lead as hard as he does, nor does it explain why female lead decides she likes him.",1392076800,2,233,4.825
6040270,4,B00FYV7WAQ,"A Case of You is a romantic comedy, and as such we have to expect certain things from it. There will be a couple, there will be a misunderstanding, true love will be revealed, and despite obstacles, the couple will get together. There will even be other quirky characters along the way. A Case of You does a little too much with the latter, and not enough with the former. The overall plot is rote boy-meets-girl stuff, with the angle of Sam looking for material. That's the ""hook"" that A Case of You hangs its misunderstandings on. It's not a horrible hook as far as it goes, but despite the numerous opportunities, the film has to do something new with the material, it doesn't. On the flip side, A Case of You over-invests in packing the film with ""quirky"" characters. Individually, they're amusing; I especially love Peter Dinklage's weird creation as Birdie's co-worker. However, as a parade they detract from the focus on Sam and Birdie, which is both tiresome and shows just how empty the central ""romance"" is.

The one thing you can't take away from A Case of You is the cast. Though Long has been playing this kind of hapless, half-smarmy character for a while, everyone else feels surprisingly fresh. Evan Rachel Wood is charming as Birdie, and it's not hard to see why. We also get a fun appearance by Sam Rockwell as Sam's guitar teacher, and everyone from Brendan Frasier to Sienna Miller shows up to fill out the cast. Sam's editor is even played by Vince Vaughn. Peter Dinklage also once again proves he's one of the most talented actors working as he plays Birdie's co-worker. I'd have rather seen a film just about him. I don't know what Long and director Kat Coiro had on these actors to get them to appear, but it elevates the movie.

The film is also not terrible. I think, given the cast, that it could have and should have been better. However, what's here is executed with energy and skill. That means those who want just another romantic comedy to watch can appreciate the expected twists and turns in the Sam and Birdie story. Fans of the actors will get to see their favorites take on quirky roles. There is some pleasure to be had, therefore, even if it's not as much as the talent involved would suggest.

A Case of You (Blu-ray) is also pretty strong. The 2.40:1/1080p AVC-encoded transfer is full of rich detail. There are a lot of bright scenes that showcases nice textures, and the interior scenes of Sam and Birdie's hobbies are similarly impressive. Colors are well-saturated, and black levels stay consistent and deep. No significant digital artefacts crop up. Similarly, the DTS-HD 5.1 audio track keeps dialogue clean and clear. The surround don't get a lot of use, but there is some directionality to establish atmosphere.

The set's extras include a set of interviews with the usual suspects. They're informative and light, complimenting the movie perfectly. The film's trailer is also available. Given the homegrown nature of the script (written by Long, his brother Christian, and co-star Keir O'Donnell), a commentary would have been nice.

A Case of You is one of those films that sets itself a modest goal and achieves it. If you're looking for a simple rom-com with a lot of great actors, then this will probably fit the bill. If you want something particularly clever or original from your romantic comedies, this probably isn't the film for you. In either case, the decent A Case of You (Blu-ray) that's worth a rental to the interested.

6040271,4,B00FYV7WAQ,"""You could become the man of her dreams if you wanted to."" Sam (Long) is a struggling writer who has a crush on Birdie (Wood), the barista at the coffee place he frequents. He has no idea how to approach her until his friend brings up the idea of looking at her Facebook profile. Sam studies what he sees and becomes everything she is looking for. When she begins to fall for him Sam rethinks his choices. I am really becoming a Justin Long fan. In every movie he is in he is very easy to like and very funny. After the amazing Best Man Down movie I was looking forward to seeing this. While this wasn't as good as that one this was still very enjoyable. What could have been a generic cookie cutter romantic comedy was changed just enough to make it interesting and fun to watch. The best part was that it wasn't 100% predictable, more like 90% but still... The movie is more or less about a non-creepy (not totally at least) stalker who gets the girl by not being himself. It had the possibility of being totally creepy and borderline scary but the performances and the writing made it sweet and funny. I did like this quite a bit and recommend it. Overall, the sweetest and least creepy stalker movie I have ever seen. I give this a B+.",1391385600,,1239,4.299145299145299

8619563,3,B00FYV7WAQ,"I found A Case of You overall pretty disappointing, when compared to other movies with the same plot of a guy learning stuff about a girl he wants to get somewhere with and then pretending he's interested or even taking classes in things she's interested in, that I've seen over the years.  The one has Justin Long's character Sam, a novelization of movies author who's a bit of a sad sack loser type character, wanting to date Birdie, Evan Rachel Wood's character, the hot younger free spirited coffee shop worker, checking out her Facebook profile, and reading her posts to run into her and to know her favourite books, movies, activities and what she's into so he can fake being into those things too.

There's some small roles for recongnisable faces such as Busy Philipps, Sam Rockwell, Peter Dinklage and others too, which they are good in, but they aren't much more than cameos.  Vince Vaughn for example as Sam's agent, doesn't really do anything at all, he's wasted in just a guy in an office in other part of America somewhere making a few calls to Sam.  It's Justin's Long's character that carries the movie with all the screen time and unfortunately he's just not that interesting, and even a little boring which results in him not being that likable.  It's hard to believe that even with Sam pretending to be into the things she is, that Birdie would want to hang around him for long, let alone date him.

Sam also suddenly just becomes a jerk to Birdie out of the blue (at the art Gallery picnic) which really needed some build up scenes to explain this odd out of character behaviour.  The movie overall really could have done more with the premise of basically stalking someone and then pretending your into what they like.  It also doesn't tackle the obvious age difference between the two characters. They could have had some fun at destinations, doing activities with that.

A Case of You is watchable, but it's not something you'd bother with a second time.  Both Justin Long and Evan Rachel Wood have been in much better movies than this one.",1510358400,,2063,4.658402203856749
8619564,4,B00FYV7WAQ,"I have to disagree with a couple other reviews on here that say guys don't act like the main character, or that girls wouldn't go after guys like that.  The point of this film is that the main actress (played brilliantly by Evan Rachel Wood)  is more of a domineering type of girl, especially toward the end of the movie when she tends to take charge over their relationship.  Women like this would probably find someone successful (like the character of Sam) with whom to have a relationship.  He has a good career, and is intelligent, but needs this female, because it seems like he can't be the lead in the relationship.  He wants to do everything that she does, so he will be liked.  By the end of the film, (SPOILER) he does become himself, and confesses that he was pretending as it were, but everything seems to work out.  The acting in the movie is great, and it does have funny scenes, like the one with the guitar teacher Sam Rockwell, or the scene with Keir O'Donnell at the computer.  The movie also surprisingly has really good cameos.  Vince Vaughn, Brendan Fraser, Sienna Miller, Peter Dinklage (not really a cameo), and probably the most randomly chosen ones...Luis from Sesame Street (Emilio Delgado), the Mayor from Ghostbuters (David Margulies) and towards the end, Ralphie from ""A Christmas Story.""  The Blu-Ray has some good special features as well.  This is, however,  your typical Justin Long type movie, but I found myself more interested in the other three main characters.  Busy Phillips was really good as the girlfriend. Keir O'Donnell played a great stoner/roomate.  Finally as I said before, Evan Rachel Wood once again plays her part perfectly, and fits into the role very easily.  I would recommend this movie to anyone as a good comedy, just don't over-analyze the character of Sam, because guys like him most likely get a woman like ""Birdie.""",1488844800,,1877,4.767801857585139

8619569,2,B00FYV7WAQ,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Writer/producer Justin Long's 2013 rom-com, ""A Case of You,"" was most notably viewed at the Tribeca Film Festival and had a very limited commercial run. Some critics were very harsh in their critique of Long's comedy about Sam, a dissatisfied film novelist who falls in love with a barista he meets at a Brooklyn coffee shop. I'm not sure if I would go as far as Rodrigo Perez did in ""The Playlist"" when he condemns ""A Case of You"" as the first Facebook ""Stalker Comedy,"" but ultimately the film's premise is a thin one.

The barista in question is one ""Birdie,"" played by Evan Rachel Wood. After Birdie is fired from her job, Sam decides to seek her out but first decides to become familiar with all her Facebook hobbies. In that way, he reasons, she'll be drawn to him. A few of the bits are actually amusing, especially Justin's guitar lessons with a 90s music aficionado loser played by Sam Rockwell and Sam's agent and a literary consultant's critique of his new ""art"" novel based on his relationship with Birdie (their professional advice is that his protagonist is a narcissist which leads Sam to an epiphany that his phony way of courting Birdie is no longer working).

The problem with most of this is that Sam is too much of a loser for us to have much sympathy for him. In real life, it's the ego-infused ""bad boys"" that should interest us, as they cross the ethical line with impunity and often (unfortunately), get away with it. In contrast, Long and his co-writers ask us to laugh at ""sad sacks"" like Sam due to their ineptitude and laughing at such characters with their attendant pratfalls, do little to tickle the funny bone.

The narrative also occasionally goes too far, crossing into the realm of crude humor. Example: Roommate Eliot, who masturbates to pictures of Martha Stewart and a contemporary Carrie Fischer!

To cap things off, we learn that Birdie has realized early on what Sam has been doing but still falls for him anyway (an unlikely turn of events unless you like sentimental endings). The theme of ""A Case of You,"" is ""To thine own self be true,"" with Sam finally realizing that being somebody else ultimately does not lead to success in the courtship game. What he should have done was watched Bill Murray's masterful performance in ""Groundhog Day,"" a basic primer on the correct and incorrect way of ""getting the girl.""",1436400000,,2398,4.68646080760095
