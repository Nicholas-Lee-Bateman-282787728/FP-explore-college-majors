3176371,4,B0017ZYI6E,"I loved this series.  Have since I caught in online.  I've been looking for this on DVD in the states, but had to wait.  Then I found it on Amazon.  The seller sent this out to me very quickly.  Thanks.  The last episode's subs were off but it was good subbing thru the rest of the series.  I would order other series DVDs from this seller, have seen the list.  lol  But the series is cute & funny.  I like Mizuki, she has guts to travel so far, not telling her parents it's an all boys school just to help out Sano.  Nakasuto is cute!!  He's over the top & Kawaii.",1269043200,3,565,3.990990990990991

3176373,2,B0017ZYI6E,I recently bought this item and though I highly recommend the show I don't suggest you buy this dvd unless you are fluent in Japanese. The subs are horrible.,1254960000,3,157,4.448275862068965
3176374,5,B0017ZYI6E,"I liked ""Here Comes Mr. Jordan""; I liked ""Heaven Can Wait"".  Dream Again puts a new take on a classic.  Yes, the story is familiar.  Heaven screws up and takes a man before his time, but they can't put him back because his body has been cremated.  So, our hero ends up in the body of a million or billion yen business man.  If you've seen ""Heaven"", you may remember that someone was trying to kill our rich guy, well, someone is trying to put him out of business; but the kicker here is that his illegitimate daughter shows up on his doorstep.  And our dead buy wants to play baseball not football.

I can see why the Japanese TV industry is more lucrative than the film industry.  They throw money at TV shows.  The setting is beautiful and the acting is very good.  Sorimachi is definitely eye candy.  The only disappointment was the final episode.  The subtitling was done by someone else who did not understand English well and used the Chinese names for the characters instead of the Japanese names.  However, by the time I got to episode 10, even though I was disappointed, I was still able to enjoy the show.",1249430400,,1115,4.4068627450980395

HORRIBLE is the word, for the ""Chin-glish"" translation done too this entertaining Japanese TV series, and if the company-hired translators or even the Owner, would have done a Google before embarrassing themselves (and killing their sales) they would have REALLY found the correct way  this series should have been marketed for the American audience![...]
The Amazon seller did a good job of shipping this item too me, but there really should have been a warning posted somewhere on this page...about the ""Grammatically-Challenged"" Chinese version of the English Language you would be receiving!",1247011200,,696,5.435185185185185
3176376,3,B0017ZYI6E,"I watched this series on Mysoju.com and enjoyed it so much I had to purchase it. It is a very engaging and funny romantic comedy. Unfortunately, the DVD collection has a major flaw. For some reason, from about Episode 6 through the end, the English language subtitles are written from the Chinese audio track instead of the Japanese. This causes many of the sentences to be vastly different, often not using correct English grammar. And even the spelling of the characters' names change into Chinese names rather than Japanese ones. I very highly recommend this series but I can't recommend this collection as it is.",1246233600,3,616,4.876190476190477
3176377,4,B0017ZYI6E,"This drama is great.  It does a great job of keeping the interest of the watcher, and all the actors are enjoyable to watch.  The only complaint I have with this DVD is the timing of the English subtitles.  Sometimes they come in too late, and since they are late they leave right away, making it impossible to read what was just on the screen.  Also, I recommend that you brush up on your fast reading skills before watching this, because the dialogue has a lot of quick exchanges",1238112000,,481,4.370786516853933
3176378,5,B0017ZYI6E,"having read the manga, i thought the creators for this live version really bastardized hisaya nakajo's work. it's out of touch and flows rather stiff. but after watching it a few times, i understood the importance of delivering a live adaptation with originality and with the creators' own flair and touch. however, the live version is much too short to encompass a 23-volume work. i would love to see an expansion on it. there are way too many crazy things that happened and it's sad that you don't get to see those live.

but the cast in this series are wonderful and very talented. sano was way too emo and detached (an opposite of his character in the manga) and oguri shun did a great job portraying him in that light. toma and maki are just too cute and funny!

the only thing that really bothered me with this product overall is the translation of the last episode. it looked like it was done by a 5-year old. the english was so horrible i just stopped watching it altogether. it was also geared for the taiwanese version since the characters' names weren't changed to the original.

it's a great show to watch! i just wish japan releases (another) boxed set with english subtitles on it.",1221955200,7,1195,4.5488372093023255

Any drama boxset that is both: A) ""All region"" (as opposed to R1 for North America, etc.); and B) both Chinese and English subtitled is almost assuredly a bootleg. Don't waste your money!

8267960,5,B0017ZYI6E,"I read the entire Hana Kimi manga series before watching this series with a friend(who had also read it) and we absolutley fell in love. We found ourselves quoting and citing this thing left and right for weeks afterward. This series is hilarious and capitalizes on parodying similar types of Japanese television dramas. The series even admits right at the very begining that it's going to be a little on the silly side, but that's what gives it its appeal. My favorite part of the television series is when all the boys cheerlead on the field to Avril Lavigne's ""Girlfriend"". (Aparently, that song was a big hit in Japan too.)

  Given all of that, the series DOES differ from the book series naturally. It doesn't touch upon all the same points as it does in the book series, nor does it include all the characters and details from the manga storyline. The girls from the main school's sister academy play a different role in the tv drama than they do in the manga. So if you're looking for an exact carbon copy of the manga, you're not gonna get it. Instead, this series takes some liberties that it needed and wanted to take to adapt this to the screen.

  If you like the Hana Kimi manga, this is the series you'll want to watch. :D",1301011200,,1237,4.475555555555555

8267962,5,B0017ZYI6E,"Basically this is a Japanese series about a group of veterinary students that are required to go to the country for ""re-education"".  It is a hands-on program for college that must be done to meet the needs for veterinary school.  The students that are chosen for this program come from all different backgrounds which along with the quirky  locals make a hilarious comedy that keeps you coming back for more.  There is a little bit of everything for everyone in this series!  I just love it! The title translation is a little off though...",1281484800,,539,4.691489361702128
8267963,1,B0017ZYI6E,"Warning! For the first 3 episodes on this DVD, the Chinese company stole a Fan-Subtitlers work and used them on the DVD. After that, the subtitles were done ""in-house"" apparently, and not only is it very bad, but Chinese names were substituted for Japanese names (my guess is someone did the J-C translation first, then someone did a C-E translation from the Chinese subs)",1272326400,3,372,4.828125
