7877307,1,6304791097,"Let me start by describing a traditional La Blue Girl episode. The animation usually teeters between very good and very poor with the occasional bad continuity, animated plot holes and overall lazy details. All of this was overshadowed however by everything else the episode had to offer: long, interesting or well thought-out scenes of eroticism boasting variety per episode (sometimes it's Human on Human, some times its Monster on Human, Tentacle on Human, Martial Arts Sex, Bondage, Sex Toys and Machines... pretty much every legal fetish). Best of all, La Blue Girl wasn't the type of Hentai that combined its violence with its sexuality, or at least not with every scene; in flashbacks and story/drama related scenes, there were exceptions, but that was only when Kan Fukumoto stepped in to direct. For the most part it was good, fun perversion where you didn't have to worry about girls blowing up if a horny man-beast got ahold of them. That's another thing a typical La Blue Girl episode offered: Fun. Miko Mido is always aloof and a good combat expert, but she was always faced with zany, comedic situations thanks to her dwarf ninja pal Nin-Nin or her oversexed older sister; even when Miko was faced with danger or saving her peers from sexual assault, Miko was still a comedic character. Goofy antics, decent action and great eroticism was always delivered in an average La Blue Girl episode.
Lady Blue is NONE of the described above. Lady Blue is what happens when the production company decides to put more emphasis on what La Blue Girl lacked (consistent animation and a fully fleshed, consistent story) and remove anything and everything that makes La Blue Girl fun. The end result is an unenjoyable anime that fails to be unique as much as it fails to deliver entertainment, featured here with episodes One and Two from the four part mini-series.

First of all, the character change for Miko is drastic and harsh: Miko is changed from being a funny, sexy and solid altruistic kunoichi to an abusive, boy-obssessed, romantic who loses all focus on anything if it involves her love-at-first-sight Love Interest. Her antics with Nin-Nin are made insufferable as Nin-Nin, the usual Comic Relief Hentai Character, is made into the most competent and reliable person in the entire story. Even Fubuki-Kai gets a taste of the intolerable character change as she basically becomes the jealous friend vying for her man.

The plot in itself is something out of Romance Story Hell as it involves an ancient curse involving two lovers from the Nobunaga Period in Japan's history and a rival of Oda's power partnering with the Shikima Realm. What this means is a suppressive focus on both Miko as a romantic character and the focus on the villains of the story as well as their intersecting backstories. Never before has a La Blue Girl story been so boring and uninteresting; the flashbacks involving Kyoshiro and Sanahime are intrusive, long and have about a minute worth of sexuality thrown into a five minute long sequence. Their backstories are rendered useless anyway when we first meet Sanahime; every second you could spend sympathizing with these ancient lame-brains and THEIR romantic sub-plot and attempts at sympathy are immediately challenged when Sanahime is introduced. She leads me into what also makes this a bad side-story: the eroticism.

Sanahime is currently living her life as a sort of ghostly vampire who retains her mummy-like (apparently Elven) looks by sexually sucking the youth out of Miko's pretty, nympholeptic friends. Now first of all, that actually sounds promising: I can buy Forced Lesbian Vampirism as an interesting, somewhat new use of eroticism and for the first few seconds this fetish is introduced, it's actually easy to get behind. Unfortunately, this fetish is destroyed almost immediately after its introduced when the girls Sanahime drains instantly mummify and thusly murdered. Several problems sprout from this bad seed of a plot device:

1) If I wanted to watch a movie involving a nude, beautiful woman and vampires draining people of their life's energy, I'll watch Life Force.
2) Any sympathy Sanahime's teary backstory tries to invoke are ruined because I can't sympathize with a sexually-themed serial killer.
3) It breaks the tradition of most La Blue Girl episodes by trying to be Lesson of Darkness without any possible factor that made THAT OVA good.
4) It further hampers Miko's character when she learns that Sanahime murdered three of her friends and she spends a total of three seconds in mourning.
5) This is about as erotic as this side story gets!

Okay, sure, there's about one scene where Miko masturbates, aforementioned flashback stuff which mostly involved a minute worth of straight sex and some VERY brief tentacle sex thrown in at the end of each episode, but if you amass the erotic scenes together between the featured episodes they wouldn't reach the five minute mark! All you're getting out of these two episodes is good animation with very few animation flubs and a one-sided romance story that any human will find tiresome and not worth the trouble (unless you're an adult fan of the Twilight series). Even the action is ruined when we come to realize just how indestructible the villains are forcing Miko or Nin-Nin to fight for a few seconds before someone flees.

This is a surprisingly hard movie series to find especially on DVD, but it's not worth seeking. Even as a collector, I'm a little embarrassed to admitting having bought and owning this and I've admitted enjoying Hentai in general! If you ever wanted a Porn that hates its own Pornography, then that's the only way you'll like this; it's right up there with the last four episodes of Twin Angels or Demon Beast Invasion Purgatory. Story-heavy, short-lived eroticism with unlikable characters, long, unnecessary flashbacks.",1344643200,,5871,5.010245901639344
