6761152,3,B00OU2GO36,"This third season is better than the previous two. The characters are slightly more nuanced, as are the relationships between them. But only slightly. Where season 3 does significantly trump its predecessors is in building tension more effectively, episode by episode, evoking a heightened curiosity as to what happens next. By contemporary standards this is good but not great television.",1422835200,5,389,5.5

6761160,5,B00OU2GO36,"""The Eagle"" is a three season series of interconnected crime stories involving a special until of the Danish police whose job, much like that is ""Law and Order SVU,"" is to track then hunt down criminals whose heinous crimes like trafficking of women, children, drugs, and illegal immigrants cross Europe's borders. The team is led by Halgrim Halgrimsson, whose insight into the motives and actions of wrong-doers earn him the nickname ""The Eagle."" The other investigators on Halgrim's team include two men and two women. Ditte is the forensic expert, Mikel the computer whiz, etc.

What makes ""The Eagle"" especially appealing is the development of each character's personality and revelations about that individual's personal life. Halgrimsson is a complicated man, unable or unwilling to commit himself to a specific woman, and he is haunted by this. Likewise, in Season Two Mikel is haunted both personally and professionally by the knowledge he shot an innocent man. Ditte and her ex-husband, also a police officer, fight over custody of their children. And the writers of ""The Eagle"" are not afraid to allow the crimes the characters  are investigating  get too close to their personal lives for comfort. Thus, this is a compelling series dealing with complex people and complex contemporary problems, giving it a feel of authenticity lacking in some of my favorite US crime shows.

I purchased the three seasons of ""The Eagle,"" which is in Danish with English subtitles because I have lived in Denmark and was once fluent in Danish. This summer I will see some old classmates, and so I am trying to brush up on my Danish. It isn't enough for me to re-learn 1000 vocabulary words. I also need to hear the rhythm and flow of the language. As I have watched each show I've remembered more and more words. The syntax has become more and more familiar. I can follow the story line without the subtitles, or know when something has been translated into English without using the precise Danish words.

I have two quarrels with the show: first, it ends in Season Three. Second, there seems to be no way to block the subtitles from the video. I have yet to watch the final three episodes in the series. Frankly, I don't want it to end. I have read enough of the reviews on Google to have a general idea of how the story is ""wrapped up."" But I am holding onto them, watching each ensuing episode when I have no distractions, not so I can practice my Danish, but because I just don't want to see the series end. Luckily I own all three seasons and I intend to watch them again, and will, eventually cover the bottom of my TV screen with black construction paper so I don't have to be distracted (I hope)  by seeing the subtitles.

As a bonus for anyone wonder what the three main Scandinavian countries look like the show features breath-takingly beautiful background scenes of Copenhagen, Stockholm, and the Swedish and Norwegian countryside.",1455062400,7,2938,4.794466403162056

6761172,5,B00OU2GO36,Many may not agree with my five star rating when it does not contain explicit sex or gratuitous violence. I love international procedurals(crime/forensics)  and watched all three seasons. Each episode stands alone but has many arcs that run through all three seasons and the topics are just as relevant today. The acting is great with a strong alpha male lead both flawed and likeable. Subtitles make you pay attention unless you are fluent in Danish. One truly gets to see the European approach  and interaction when dealing with the exact same topics/ crimes as is seen in top American T.V. shows. Watch all three seasons from the first episode.,1444953600,5,647,4.926605504587156

6761174,4,B00OU2GO36,"It's really a ""Must Watch"" not only for its excellent and believable actors but also to pick up the European aversion to violence in the name of authority and even in self-defense. All authority is suspect. And the show goes out of its way to show that a Muslim can be a lovable character.",1440201600,,289,4.37037037037037
6761175,5,B00OU2GO36,Loved it.  Looking for the next one.  Beautifully done.,1439942400,,55,5.0

6761178,5,B00OU2GO36,"One of my absolute favorite crime shows. The cast is incredibly good, along with the directing, writing and videography. I only wish it hadn't stopped with three seasons. I was very disappointed when it ended.",1437436800,,209,5.0
6761179,5,B00OU2GO36,"Loved the series, the storylines, the characters. I was however, not satisfied with the resolution of the series. It didn't feel finished. Perhaps they planned to have another season. Characters were left hanging in the air but until the end, it was perfect.",1436745600,,258,5.023255813953488

6761182,4,B00OU2GO36,"I give this 4 stars because it was better than season 2, but not as good as season 1.  Season 1 was outstanding, but the others were not as good as I had hoped, though I was able to make it through all three without giving up.  It was worth $9.99 to watch, but I wouldn't pay for it on DVD.",1436054400,,290,3.737704918032787

6761186,5,B00OU2GO36,"Outstanding, one of the best among the Scandinavian offerings, which are on a class of their own. But beware of Amazon's current strategy. Set 3 is easily streamed by episode or even more cheaply if u buy series. However (big however) one soon discovers that this is #3 and knowledge of #s 1 and 2 would have come in very handy. I am currently dealing with Amazon to remedy this very issue. It appears that set 1 can be downloaded (higher price) bur set 2 has to be purchased as a DVD, Or alternatively, rely on your Public Library to purchase them. A must watch, preferably in the order they were made. I am only hoping that a 4th set is underway.",1433721600,,648,4.319672131147541
6761187,5,B00OU2GO36,"This show continued its excellence into its third season. There are many interesting cases here but by far the most interesting is the international pedophile ring that this top Danish team uncovers. It takes international cooperation among nations to police this and I found the whole operation fascinating. Our main guy, pictured, is aces on the job but always has women problems because he is a womanizer. Season Three brings with it that one of these woman is having his little girl so he is finally a father. This as you might expect affects him profoundly and for such a decisive personality out in the field he is really lost about this development. This show accepts characters as they are and the team as it is. Some die. Some fail. Some cases are profound wins. Others are Phyrric victories. This is a lot more realistic about human nature on a daily basis than your average American cop show.",1432080000,4,903,4.7215189873417724

6761191,5,B00OU2GO36,Just great,1430265600,,10,4.5
6761192,2,B00OU2GO36,"Pretty much in the genre of police procedural, with the lonely, depressed detective who cannot manage a coherent relationship with a woman but who has lots of bedding experience.  This creates the soap-opera background of a group of hot-shot detectives who work on high-visibility murders and/or political thriller plots.

I thought it was pretty soapy.",1429574400,,353,5.4

8684858,3,B00OU2GO36,"I found this disappointing. The protagonist seems so unmoored that it is impossible for me to like him as he literally floats through his life. They seem to see him as the womanizing 'eagle,' but for me he's increasingly the hit-and-run driver in people's lives. The actual crime plots range from boring to compelling. I found myself skipping a few episodes.",1525564800,,358,4.885245901639344
