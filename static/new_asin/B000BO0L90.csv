2431176,4,B000BO0L90,"SCHOOL OF LIFE is an original ABC Family television movie which aired in 2005, and, until I saw my brother's dvd copy, I had never heard of it. I popped it in, thinking that it might be an interesting movie, given that I get a kick out of watching the always entertaining Ryan Reynolds. But, like most of the reviewers here, I wasn't counting on this film reaching me on a richer, more emotional plane.

David Paymer is great as Matt Warner, the insecure, fussy middle school biology teacher who's forever lived in the shadow of his father, Stormin' Norman Warner (John Astin), himself a teacher at the same school and who had won the annual, student-voted Teacher of the Year Award for 43 years running. Now Matt has a teenage son named Dylan (Andrew Robb, who provides the film's voice-over narration) who frequents the same school, with whom Matt struggles to connect. Like most kids, Dylan is embarassed of his dad, who he thinks is a geek. When Stormin' Norman passes away, Matt promises Dylan that, this year, he'll win the Teacher of the Year trophy. That plan is immediately placed in jeopardy with the opening school day intro of new history instructor, Michael D'Angelo (Ryan Reynolds). The cool and funny D'Angelo, with his unorthodox teaching methods and a life philosophy that go beyond classroom restrictions, promptly wins over the students and earns him the honorific of ""Mr. D,"" much to Matt Warner's dismay.

The film then adopts a sit-com plot at length as Matt, jealous of Mr. D's popularity and seeing his chances for the Teacher of the Year Award circling down the drain, manically attempts to gain some dirt on the guy. What he discovers about D'Angelo, instead, shocks him and sobers him up fairly quickly, forcing him to re-evaluate not only his feelings about Mr. D but also to reassess his own life.

SCHOOL OF LIFE is a humble, little film that has a lot to offer, including a message about living life to the fullest. It'll, for sure, make you smile and chuckle, but, then, as you go deeper into the movie, it'll also make you sad as events take a gut-wrenching turn. But the bittersweet elements definitely will make it resonate more strongly within you.

SCHOOL OF LIFE, much like FOOLPROOF (2003), showcases a Ryan Reynolds with more acting gravitas. Yes, he still provides his usual brand of humorous bits and, make no mistake, he is the heart of the funny, but his comedy is elevated by his strong, underlying dramatic performance, which then takes over in the film's latter half. This blend of humor and sensitivity is what really carries the movie, because you can't really commit to the story unless you buy into Reynolds' character. Paymer, as I've said, is great as the fastidious bio teacher, although, later on, his character does end up borrowing too much from the page of Mr. D. But, good job, Paymer and Van Wilder. A decent supporting turn, also, by Kate Vernon, who plays Paymer's supporting and understanding wife.

So, yes, this film is definitely worth your backing. I've said this before somewhere else: enough credit cannot be given to movies like SCHOOL OF LIFE, which reenforces the importance of teachers as educators, nurturers, and as inspiration for our kids. You just can't underestimate the value and the impact of a caring, innovative teacher who truly tries to make a difference. As a side note, if you like SCHOOL OF LIFE, check out THE RON CLARK STORY, another inspirational movie about a teacher.",1165017600,6,3460,4.788944723618091
2431177,5,B000BO0L90,"""School of Life"" is a sweet little dramatic comedy, full of things to laugh, smile and think about.

Dylan Warner (Andrew Robb) is a pretty average but awkward junior high kid. He has his classes, he has his friends, he plays sports and he has a crush on a girl who's way too pretty and confident for him (played by Shylo Sharity) But he's different from the other kids in a couple of ways. His grandfather (John Astin) is a teacher at his school, and so is his father (David Paymer). His grampa, Stormin' Norman Warner is a warm, popular teacher, who has won the Most Popular Teacher award for decades, while his Dad, Mr Warner, is a strict, stressed and uptight teacher of biology. One sad day, his grampa dies, in the middle of accepting yet another most popular teacher award. In his grief, Mr Warner promises to win the award the next year, to honor his father, Stormin' Norman. He tries to be something the students like, but being as uptight and strict as he is, his efforts aren't that successful. The winner of the award this year is more likely to come to Michael D'Angelo (Ryan Reynolds), - ""Mr D."" to his students, his fellow teachers and even his friends. He's a history teacher: young, charismatic and fun. Most importantly of all, all students under him all get top grades in the standardized tests. Mr Warner is jealous and baffled, why does everyone like this guy so much? Mr Warner tries to outdo Mr D, tries to sabotage him, follows him home, tries to dig up dirt on him. The only thing he manages to do is get his son humiliated in front of his friends. Still, Mr Warner keeps digging, and eventually stumbles upon something Mr D has been keeping a secret, and it breaks Mr Warner's heart when he finds out just what that secret is.

I'm a sucker for films about school, I really am. This film is really well cast, has plenty of laughs, good dramatic moments, and great little messages. At my high school, there were all sorts of teachers. Some were really strict, some were easy going and lenient. I even had a sports teacher who graded you according to effort rather than on how well you played, which was really cool. But there was one thing they all had in common, even if I didn't know it all the time, they all cared and they all wanted to be heard. Seeing this film, I have a greater appreciation for what they were trying to do, even the stricter ones. You can see, through Mr Warner's characters, how strict teachers really do mean well, even if it isn't natural in their personalities to be super kid friendly. It also shows how they can play to their strengths too. I also knew a few kids who had parents teaching at their school, carefully balancing on the thin social line and I think Andrew Robb, who played Dyland Warner, captured that well.

It's warm, it's witty and just plain good. Highly recommended for lovers of drama and comedy.",1152403200,8,2871,4.464761904761905
2431178,4,B000BO0L90,"Other than the boring story line of a teacher trying to sabotage another teacher with child like tactics to win a school award for about the first 30-45 minutes it does become a much deeper movie than you expect it could become.  Ryan Reynolds delivers a much deeper performance than he is a customary to playing, but in this movie he is still able to get in his humor which still makes you like him enough to really feel for the movie.  I only give this movie a 4 because the plot could of been much more solid but if your looking for a movie that will actually make you reevaluate your actions and outlooks on life this will do it.",1141516800,2,633,4.223140495867769
2431179,5,B000BO0L90,"Ryan never plays this type in a movie. When I started to watch it I figured it wouldn't be good as he has never played anything but the ""Class Clown"". However, after only minutes into it I was hooked. He has a star performance in this movie. I now know he can play an all around role in any movie and still make you want to buy it and watch is over and over. With out giving the movie away the only thing you need to know is that it has a very strong and meaningful theme and point to the entire movie. It will change the way you think about some things and enhance others. This movie is good for all ages and will be worth what ever the cost is.",1140998400,2,646,3.9015151515151514
2431180,5,B000BO0L90,"I was very surprised I liked this movie.  The only reason I wanted to watch it is because of Ryan Reynolds.  I wish he was in more movies, I love to watch him act, he has IT.  I've seen just about every movie he's been in.  Even more, why couldn't I had a teacher like Mr. D (Reynolds) when I went to school.  The movie made me cry, which is a good bonus, everyone needs a heartfelt cry once in awhile.  Didn't think it would be any good since it was a family film, but it gives a great message.  Definitely check this movie whether your a fan of Ryan Reynolds or not.",1140739200,2,568,3.9734513274336285
2431181,5,B000BO0L90,"Like another reviewer mentioned, I was also not expecting great things from this movie. But I was completely surprised. If you ever want proof how a relatively low budget movie blow away movies with a 100 million price tag, look no further. The reason is simply extraordinarily good writing, and a good cast as well.

The movie really illustrates how important it is to live your life the best you can, while you can. It's a similar movie to, but far better than, ""Dead Poets Society"". The story focuses on a boring, socially awkward junior high biology teacher who is very unpopular with his students, and not highly respected by his son. He has also been living in the shadow of both his father (who was the most popular teacher in his school's history) and a new teacher at the school with an unorthodox style that is stealing all the student's attention. The story focuses on how this man finally breaks out on his own, and turns his life around. Whether he acts like a jerk, or becomes the hero, you will cheer him at every step.

The movie is not perfect and includes the ""nerdy guy gets the popular girl storyline"", which is a cliche you see too often in films about school life. But you really have to nitpick to find the few flaws. Its probably the best high school film ever made, and a film you won't forget anytime soon.",1140220800,18,1332,4.477366255144033
2431182,5,B000BO0L90,"It doesn't happen a lot that I'm touched by anything in a way that makes me wonder whether I should cry or feel good.

This movie im simply amazing.

A good movie has the ability to affect you. I can safely say that this movie had an enormous impact on me and made me think a lot. I realized that life is too short to fuss about petty sh**. Life every moment to the fullest, because it will never come back. And this is what the movie is about. Live your life...like there is no tomorrow. Because you never know when 'tomorrow' will come.

If you choose this movie, you're in for some crying, folks.

But you'll see life differently..",1137715200,,634,4.258333333333334

2431185,4,B000BO0L90,"Mr. D is a popular new teacher and it gets on the nerves of a veteran teacher looking to keep up with his father's legacy of getting Teacher of the Year.  The plot of the movie is a feel good story about realizing what's on the inside and loosening up a little to stay young at heart.  It's shows that old dogs can learn new tricks.  Being a teacher, it really hits home to what's important in my profession.  I like Ryan Reynolds and he plays a great Mr. D.

2431200,5,B000BO0L90,"P H E N O M E N A L  !!!!  I highly recommend this movie for people of all ages, young and old.  I would use the following words to describe it:  touching, humorous, sweet, entertaining, and thought provoking.  For those of us who have been out of High School for many years, it also provides a bit of nostalgia.  There are many life lessons included in this movie.  It's one of those movies that leaves you feeling good and thinking about how many lives we all touch during our days on this earth.  It also reminds us that teachers are human beings with all of the same emotions and ups & downs as the rest of the world.

Ryan Reynolds does a superb job as the new teacher on the block.  His expressions throughout the movie are priceless!  David Palmer is terrific as well as he desperately tries to fill the shoes of his deceased and acclaimed father.  Although I enjoyed all of the characters in the movie, these two definitely steal the show!

Through the years I have ordered many, many copies of this movie.  I like to keep a supply on hand to give as gifts to my daughter's teachers.",1363392000,2,1091,4.284313725490196
2431201,5,B000BO0L90,"A great, great movie. I first saw this on Netflix and they took it off, so I went ahead and purchased it. It is a great movie for anyone and everyone.",1362441600,,150,3.870967741935484
2431202,3,B000BO0L90,"School Of Life is a film intended for children and young teenagers.  This is plainly obvious by the jokes and storytelling we encounter in the beginning- everything's so tame and people over the age of 16 won't like this.  By that point they'll feel like they're too old to give a darn about the problems of an 8th grader (and the film makes these kids seem even younger than that- more like 5th graders).

It's about a father (played by David Paymer) that plays the role of a boring middle school teacher.  Despite his best efforts, he cannot get the students to care about his lessons.  Why?  Because the cool teacher (played by Ryan Reynolds) is apparently down the hall, and this is the classroom ALL the kids want to be in.  They want their lessons to be *fun*, simple as that.  Dressing up in costumes and bringing history to life is the best way to illustrate the ultimate history lesson and raise the attention span of any kid desperately searching for a reason to care about past events.  Speaking of history, I can hardly blame these kids for being bored out of their mind- I remember my 7th and 8th grade history lessons.  They were so boring I nearly fell asleep but I always respected the teachers who tried their hardest to make history interesting.  History honestly isn't exciting until you're much older and wiser anyway- when you're a kid you want to have fun.

Anyway, it just so happens this boring father/teacher has a son in the same grade he's teaching and surprise surprise!  The son attends the cool teachers room and gets to sit beside the girl of his dreams.  What's strange is that the girl almost immediately finds an interest in the boy without the usual humiliation and uncomfortable embarrassment that we associate with a boy trying to hit on a girl.

Unfortunately this movie itself is just really boring.  There's a surprise later on involving the cool teacher (that unfortunately a few reviewers spoil below- ugh).  It's a decent twist, but the only reason I'm giving this movie 3 stars is because the boring teacher finds himself in a series of whacky situations (such as exploding microwavable moon pies covering the front of his shirt, and the segment where he gets into a fight with his wife and finds himself driving to school late at night and falling asleep with his pajamas on in the middle of a classroom only to awake by morning surrounded by laughing kids making fun of the way he's dressed).

I suppose the cool teacher would be an inspiration to someone around 12 years old watching this movie, but School Of Life does absolutely nothing as a family movie.  Also, I feel the storyline is incomplete concerning the ""teacher of the year"" award.  You'll see what I mean.  The movie feels like it misses an important and fitting conclusion.  School Of Life is for kids.",1361232000,,2813,4.64040404040404

2431209,1,B000BO0L90,"This film is so breathtakingly idiotic, so exquisitely stupid, that the best way to convey how idiotic is to just relate the plot.
 The film is about a middle school where the reigning Teacher of the Year from time immemorial, ""Stormin' Norman"" Warner, has just croaked.  Into the breach steps Mr. D, played by Ryan Reynolds (obviously in the years before stardom, when he couldn't be choosy about scripts thrust in front of him). At an assembly, he is summoned to speak to the students and teachers.  What he has to say sounds to my jaded ears as warmed up pablum. But the students and the teachers are instantly transported into a swoon.  Only Matt Warner, ""Stormin Norman's"" son (played by the suitably geekish David Paymer), sees through this obvious charlatan. ""What's the matter with everyone?"", he thinks.
 I'm with Matt. I am instantly suspicious when anyone too cool to be in school, too fine in design, suddenly comes out of the woodwork to mesmerize the masses. Aha! I think, Matt will eventually expose this mountebank for what he is and show that the real teachers are the colorless drudges like him.
 But I am wrong.  Matt is no hero, but a contemptible Doubting Thomas, poking his finger in the wound of this Christ-like figure, refusing to realize his divinity when it is so obvious to everyone else (except you, you poor benighted viewer).  Matt becomes a figure of mockery, too wrapped up in his squalid little dream of succeeding to the mantle of Stormin Norman and becoming Teacher of the Year, to realize that Mr. D is the REAL DEAL.
 We see Mr. D in the classroom.  He is not so much a teacher as a show -- a stand-up comic, a performer. He preaches how everyone is as good as everyone else.  Although his class is supposed to be a history class, Mr. D teaches his minions that there is no such thing as history as opposed to ""herstory"" and other New Age revelations. He steals their hearts by already knowing their names without the dread ""seating chart"", and then reconfiguring the classroom into a theatre in the round, with him in the center, swiveling around in his comfy chair as he dispenses his smart alecky wisdom, pearls eagerly scooped up by his pre-pubescent charges.
 And anything goes in Mr. D's world.  Are we supposed to learn about the Civil War?  OK. Let's everyone dress in blues and grays and have a mini Civil War with guns and smoke on the school grounds while the principal looks on beaming. To add verisimilitude, let's add Mr. D as Honest Abe in stovepipe hat, leading the charge. Is the subject now Indians? Let's set a roaring bonfire in the middle of the classroom while Mr. D puts on an Indian headdress and gravely intones some deep words of wisdom. What a guy!
 Meanwhile, Matt is in a downward spiral.  He sees  Mr. D as his rival, but is met with humiliation and degradation at every turn.  And this little student and teacher community is none too subtle in doling out the humiliation.  In one scene, Matt is playing in the student faculty  baseball game, when the coach comes over -- while Matt is already in the batter's box, mind you -- and ostentatiously pulls him out, announcing that Mr. D is pinch hitting for him to the uproarious delight of the throng.  Of course, on the very first pitch Mr. D hits a prodigious home run, further entrenching him in the pantheon of the gods to his adoring fans.
 An extremely annoying part of the movie is the play-by-play repartee of two repulsive junior twits, who have commandeered a microphone and boom box and appear throughout the film as a kind of demented Greek chorus, narrating the events in their wise guy, smarmy style.  One of these two idiots is particularly obnoxious -- he has a smug look on his face that causes your forearm to start twitching violently because it wants to reach into the screen and pummel this cretin's mug into a pulp, after which the rest of you wants to  jump in and stomp the punk into a fine mulch.
 And a word about the women in this film.  Every one of them appears to have been lobotomized, from the whiny art teacher who has the hots for Mr. D, to the ditsy spinster teacher who seems to be a few French fries short of a Happy Meal, to Matt's Stepford wife.  It is enough to send you out in a panicked frenzy to get the 19th Amendment repealed.
 But I digress.  Matt eventually reaches his nadir in a scene that only someone with the IQ of a raisin would conceive.  Matt is in bed with his hot wife, played by the ravishing Kate Vernon, demonstrating his virile masculinity in his Winnie the Pooh pajamas (suspending disbelief is so hard here you are practically sweating from the effort).  But then she moans ""Mr. D!"".
 That does it.  Matt snaps. He goes out -- still in his Winnie the Pooh PJs -- and wanders the streets, heading toward the school.  He gets in the building and starts looking for dirt on Mr. D.  And he finds what he is looking for -- Mr. D's grade book, which shows him giving everyone in his class an A.  Giddily joyous, Matt plops himself into Mr. D's swivel chair, swings around a few times -- and promptly falls into a deep sleep.
 The next morning, he is discovered by the entire student body sitting in the swivel chair in his ridiculous PJs, holding Mr. D's grade book.
 At this point, in the real world Matt would be toast.  Security would be escorting him out of the building for observation, the principal and the parents would cluck about how sad it was about Matt losing his mind like that, and he would never enter the school again.  But in this alternate universe, Matt continues to stride the corridors -- still in his pajamas, mind you -- as he arrives at the principal's office to expose Mr. D's perfidy.
 But then we come to learn that the A's were legit. They were the product of a standardized test.  You can't fake a standardized test, right? So everyone really did get an A!  Mr. D was such a great teacher that everyone single one  in the class -- Clyde, the jerk; the stutterer; Matt's son's little squeeze; even the borderline mentally challenged girl in the first row -- THEY ALL GOT A's!  Never mind that you've never heard of a standardized test that is measured by a letter grade.  Never mind how Mr. D is able to get these students to ace any test when he never actually teaches them anything. Stop being so questioning -- you'll lose your buzz! It was osmosis, okay?
 Now we arrive at the crucial moment.  An epiphany! Matt is saved! He has his ""come to Jesus"" moment.  The true divinity of Mr. D is revealed to him.  He learns that Mr. D is too hip to be of this earth and pretty soon the Big Hipster in the Sky will be pulling him back.  But Matt will make sure that Mr. D. lives on!  It will be his mission in life to spread the gospel according to Mr. D!  Feel the love!
 Slowly, Matt becomes cool.  The kids warm up to him.  He dispenses warm fuzzies with a perpetual simpering grin.  He is appointed the basketball coach, though he doesn't know anything about basketball.  But so what, right?
 In Mr. D's classroom , we are introduced to Ms. Hunt, his no-nonsense replacement.  The filmmakers intend that you dislike her. They cast her with a Mrs. Trunchbull lookalike with a wart on her upper lip. Matt's son comes into the classroom late, sees her, and insolently says: ""Who are you?"" Ms. Hunt gets to work. She writes ""1929"" on the blackboard and says: ""Who can tell me what major event occurred in that year?"" No one knows. Incredulous, Ms. Hunt mouths the words ""My God, has anyone  been teaching you anything about history?""  (""Yes, yes!!"" you scream. ""At last, a real teacher! Exposing the shameless fraud that Mr. D has been."" But of course, you still just don't get it).
 These sacrilegious words cause a mutiny.  One little miss huffily tells the befuddled Ms. Hunt ""This isn't history, it's  herstory.""  Matt's son gets sassy, and Ms. Hunt instructs him to go to the principal's office. ""Gladly"", says the punk. ""Who's coming with me?"" At that point, the whole class walks out of the room.  As one angry lass walks by, she flashes the ""L for loser"" sign at the wayward Ms. Hunt.
 Once out in the hallway, Matt's son leads the marauders to Matt's classroom. ""Can we come in?""
 Does Matt say ""What the hell are all of you doing out of class. Get the hell back in your classroom?"" No. We are in Mr. D's world now. Matt is now a full-fledged Mr. D disciple. He's wearing a monk's cassock from Mr. D's prodigious wardrobe, for Chrissakes. ""Sure. Come on in!""
  We then come to the climax of the movie-- the big basketball game.  The team is morose.  Mr. D is about to kick the bucket.  But Matt is there to lift their spirits.  Cheer up! He tells them. So we lose.  Big deal. Mr. D would like that!
 Energized, the team runs to the court.  There is a teeming crowd attending this middle school event that would rival Game 7 of the NBA Finals.  The fans (comprising everyone in the universe, it seems, except Ms. Hunt) are at a fever pitch.  But over what, you ask?
 Certainly not beating the other team.  That might hurt someone's self-esteem.  No, they're into loving all God's creatures! Mr. D's potion appears to have gotten into the town's water supply. This is full-throated Mr. D time. They lustily cheer as the home team badly misses a shot.  They lustily cheer when the visitors score a shot. They lustily cheer when the home team scores, too. They are crazy.
 And the cheerleaders have captured the spirit in their newly crafted cheers.  ""It doesn't matter if you win or lose"", they chant, ""as long as you try your hardest.""
 Matt's son's little squeeze, the lead cheerleader, has a pratfall on the court, so Matt's son, a player, flops down on the floor for a little pillow talk.  They have an extended chat, while everything else stops.  We know that, because the referee finally comes over and reminds them that a game is going on.
 The idiocy is coming fast and furious now.  The clock is starting to run out (probably because of how long Matt's son and his chick were holding everything up with their puppy love).  ""What play should we run"", the players ask Coach Matt.  He doesn't have a clue. ""Uh, do the Fred Astaire play."" He grabs some thumbtacks and places them into the sole of a player's shoes. ""Who's Fred Astaire?"" says the kid.
 A hush falls on the crowd. The gym door opens. A blinding light -- did someone leave his brights on? No, we are about to receive an apparition. In walks Mr. D with a cane. He walks over to the bench and shakes Matt's hand. Nirvana.
 Eventually, everyone snaps out of their reverie.  The kid who never heard of Fred Astaire tap dances on the basketball court. This somehow mesmerizes everyone -- the opposing players, the ref, the fans.  Then with a few second left, a basketball game actually breaks out.  A couple of clumsy passes and a kid is ready to take the game winning shot.  Is the other team trying to block him?  No, they have their backs to him, watching the basket.  It's like the home team is now playing the Long John Silvers.
 The shot goes in. Bedlam! (But why, you ask, if it doesn't matter who wins?)  Mr. D disappears onscreen.
 In the final shot, Matt's son and his chickie are juniors in high school now, but don't look a day older.  Matt and Kate have two more kids and Matt is blissfully happy, keeping up Mr. D's legacy and being Teacher of the Year.

2431211,5,B000BO0L90,"First off, I am a teacher so I was initially drawn to this movie by coming across it via my Netflix streaming from my PS3. This movie is unbelievably heart-warming and sends a very strong message about living each day to the fullest. Ryan Reynolds does an incredible job portraying the cool, hip, new teacher. A must-watch for the entire family.",1323561600,2,345,4.672131147540983
2431212,5,B000BO0L90,"David Paymer. Now who would have thought he could be cast as the lead actor in a film? He's not eye candy. He's not young and vibrant. He's not Gibson or Martin or Lawrence or any other famous middle-aged actor. He's just your average guy. In ""School of Life,"" he's your average teacher struggling to be excellent. However, he lacks IT, whatever IT is to make students LOVE his class. More than anything, he wants be that great teacher with classes filled with enthusiastic students.

Across the hall is Mr. D, played to perfection by Ryan Reynolds. He IS that teacher--young, handsome, athletic, and so innovative that students LOVE him and his classes. Of course, Mr. Warner is jealous. Even his own father, as an educator, won Teacher of the Year, forty-something times during a long career.

Spoiler alert:

Mr D won't have forty-something years. He has inoperable lung cancer. So, does this become a maudlin movie, for it could, but no, Director William Dear presents a thoughtful picture of this young teacher, told with just the right attitude. David Paymer's last little speech is perfect. ""Mr. D is with us. Every teacher you've ever had is with you, sharing his knowledge."" There's more in this speech, adding the soothing, verbal medication to hurting hearts. However, I encourage the reader to see this film respectful of hard-working teachers, patient and impatient students, and major obstacles that can stop us dead.

Normally, teacher movies annoy me with their silly pretense of one class for one teacher, corrupt administrations, cruel and incompetent teachers, and criminally insane students. This time the director gets it right, even though teachers still seem to have just one class. (I do understand telescoping, that is, one class brought to inspection for simplicity's purpose.)

Mr D--what a teacher of so much more than his subject. He's a teacher, by word and example, of living a worthy life. ""School of Life"" is that rare, understated, unpromoted movie that is truly worthy of your time.",1320192000,,2017,5.008955223880597
2431213,5,B000BO0L90,I would recommend this movie for anyone looking for a family movie. Ryan Reynolds gives a superb preformance. If you enjoy Hallmark's movies you'll really enjoy this movie and other Chicken Soup for the Soul offerings.,1317081600,,218,5.083333333333333
2431214,5,B000BO0L90,"Love this cute movie.  It's a comedy, of course.  Every teacher should watch this movie.

2431218,5,B000BO0L90,"I put this on for my teenage neices expecting to be mildy entertained and we all loved it.  The story (as described by other reviewers)is a universal theme that has been done before and will again because it is so important for all of us.  Here, it is deftly managed, the story enriched with developing incident from, for example, the paper boy's accuracy, heating a moon pie, to the names (Mr D, the barely noticed basketball team name on the singlets - the Angels). There are many relationships developed in this story with consequent character growth. I particularly liked the lack of histrionics a la Dead Poet's Society and a welcome lack of soaring violins.  Instead we have deft touches such as Mr D's ""I'm spoken for"" when his relationship with a fellow teacher is budding. The strong emotional subtext is leavened with humour in Mr Warner's obsession with Mr D and his seemingly effortless gift for Life with a big L. There is no cheap play for the emotions here only the well-crafted evoking of a response to a set of characters experience when faced with the question ""How long do we have?""

 It made me think about how long I have - not that long - and how I would prefer it to be.  Those reviewers who found this movie predictable and cheesy just sounded as sour as green apples to me, and missed the meaning and skill in this little gem by a country mile.",1271203200,,1369,4.5

2431220,4,B000BO0L90,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Even though it may predictable, as some reviewers have said, I love movies that cause me to think about my mortality and remind me to not take it or people around me for granted. That's what ""School of Life"" does for me. If you want a movie that has corny humor and depth then you'll enjoy this movie also.",1176854400,,339,4.3125
2431221,5,B000BO0L90,"I had to say, I bought the movie for Ryan Reynolds; I love his work, and have seen some of his older things and quite enjoyed them. That being said, I didn't expect this level of depth from either Renolds's character or the movie in general, but you get more than you pay for. I loved it, and would suggest that everyone watch, and most will enjoy, this film.

2431222,1,B000BO0L90,"Ryan Reynolds plays a smarmy, crowd pleasing new teacher who immediately bonds with all the angelic waifs in this fairytale of a school. He wins them over by being their buddy, finds the time (and money) to kit himself out as an indian chief, and even re-inacts a civil war in the playground (complete with black powder rifles). His destiny is clear from the moment he blurts out, ""How much time do we have? Not much..."". David Paymer is the comic relief, all that's missing is the floppy shoes and clown makeup. There is also the usual puppy love sub-plot with the not so awful young actor Andrew Robb, just a shame that the plot has nowhere to go.

The entire film reeks of trite, moralistic falseness. If this were just a comedy then it wouldn't matter how silly it was (accounting for your tastes), but it tries to aim too high and preach to us the meaning of life. I'm guessing this was targeted at younger audiences by the studio, but give the kids some credit, they can spot a stinker a mile away. We just need more people to be bothered leaving honest reviews (not just the fans) to lower the feedback to a realistic score, so people don't get suckered into buying such drivel.

If you want truly decent teacher/student heartwarming stories (without the schmaltz), try ""Goodbye, Mr. Chips"" (the remake is good too), or ""Mr Holland's Opus"". For some good escapist fun I'd also recommend ""School of Rock"".",1173139200,2,1411,4.595238095238095

Actually, I don't expect any good or bad votes on this comment because I don't think anyone knows this movie exist, which is probably not a bad thing. It went straight to DVD and sold for a couple bucks (not a good sign). My brother brought this movie over while we were with some friends. We have always had good movie experiences with Ryan Reynolds so we thought we would give it a shot. That was a mistake. Well, Reynolds had some funny moments that actually saved the movie from getting a one star (""I love bowling""). But my brother was able to predict the entire movie (in detail) within the first 10 minutes. I have never seen that done before!  Honestly I don't see what genre this movie fits in with. It's cheesy enough to be played on the Disney channel, but there are some bad words tossed in that make it JUST too inappropriate for little kids.  We sat through the entire movie just to see how bad it could get, and we were not disappointed. I guess it's a comedy because the acting was funnier than the jokes.
