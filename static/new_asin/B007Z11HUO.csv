5114936,3,B007Z11HUO,"I would give four stars to the plot and acting.  Lassgard is excellent, but the plots are not up to the quality in Wallander.  They seem too contrived, especially part two.  The villain in part two had a remarkable ability to do acts without immediate detection that seem impossible without a pretty good logistics network.  (That is a tendency in Wallander and even at the end of the first The Killing (the Danish version with Sofie Grabol but here it seemed to be more pronounced.)

My biggest problem, however, is with the filming itself.  Until well into the story almost everything is filmed with very strong and harsh backlighting or in extremely dim light.  It is uncomfortable to watch and even difficult to figure out what is  happening.  This backlighting was not as prominent in Part 2, but it still was hard to watch.  The final critical moment of Part 2 was so dark I couldn't immediately figure out what had happened.

Also the DVD jacket simply lists it as being part one and part two.  They are completely different stories (other than a very minor point developed in part one which became significant in part two.  That isn't a major complaint but my wife and I watched both parts in one sitting because we thought they were basically the same story.",1387756800,,1267,4.653153153153153
5114937,5,B007Z11HUO,Another winner if you happen to like real mystery with actors that look like and act like real people. Well written and a winner.,1376956800,,129,4.416666666666667
8523235,5,B007Z11HUO,"Sebastian Bergman: Dark Secrets is a 2014 Swedish Two-Part Murder Mystery and Drama from Sveriges Television. The story line of the first part centers on the investigation of a suspicious triple suicide of three young women in a small-town mine, while the second part centers on the investigation of the murder of a notorious killer of two cognitively-challenged boys, as well as the murder of a young schoolgirl, both of whom were buried near each other in a remote field. The main character is Sebastian Bergman, a renowned criminal profiler, who has been on a downward spiral after the devastating deaths of his wife and young daughter several years earlier in Thailand, as a result of the catastrophic 2004 Indian Ocean Earthquake and Tsunami. For several years following this tragedy, he had no longer been able to actively work as a profiler. This was due to the fact that he has essentially been paralyzed by his overwhelming grief and guilt subsequent to the loss of his wife and daughter, especially because he was not able to save his daughter, who was literally swept out of his arms by the powerful Tsunami wave. While not exactly a paragon of virtue and integrity, Sebastian Bergman had enough insight to realize that he needed to restore purpose to his life, and that resuming his vocation as a police profiler, would give him the relevance and sense of self-worth that he has been lacking for so long. His former colleague, who is now the head of the Swedish National Homicide Division, was very reluctant to welcome Sebastian Bergman back into police service, and have him consult on challenging murder cases, because of his past misdeeds. However, it soon became apparent that Sebastian Bergman is still a brilliant profiler, who is highly observant, perceptive, and analytical, and who has keen instincts, along with an uncanny ability to get into the mind of the killer, and to anticipate and preempt his next move. He gradually regains the confidence of the members of the Swedish National Homicide Division, and he becomes a permanent member of their investigative team. Sebastian Bergman: Dark Secrets is characterized by great writing and plot development, as well as exceptional acting performances. The incomparable Rolf Lassgard is truly outstanding with his perfect portrayal of Sebastian Bergman, and his stellar performance reminds Swedish crime drama enthusiasts that he was the first actor to play the Henning Mankell lead character, Detective Kurt Wallander, and probably the best. Sebastian Bergman: Dark Secrets is an excellent Swedish murder mystery and drama, which is decidedly gripping, suspenseful, and entertaining, and which merits a five-star rating, along with an enthusiastic recommendation.",1505174400,,2735,5.1900452488687785

8523238,5,B007Z11HUO,Excellent!,1465084800,,10,10.0
8523239,5,B007Z11HUO,"Sebastian Bergman: The Cursed One (Volume 1) contains two 90 minute episodes that correspond to the first two books in the series by Swedish screenwriting team Hjorth and Rosenfeldt, Sebastian Bergman and The Man Who Watched Women. This dvd, Sebastian Bergman: Dark Secrets (Volume 2) contains two 90 minute episodes, though the books are not translated into English yet (11/2015).

If Ingmar Bergman and Britain's Cracker had a baby it would be Sebastian Bergman, a brilliant criminal psychologist who is an absolute walking train wreck, leaving eviscerated friends and lovers in his wake. Sebastian cannot live with the grief and guilt of losing his wife and daughter, and everyone around him suffers. At the same time it's thrilling to see him work, reading killers' psyches with an ease and clarity he never achieves on his own behalf. Rolf Lassgard plays the man perfectly, and the supporting cast is quite good. The lighting is stark and the music melancholy, very Scandinavian noir, but Sebastian's personal life is more like a telenovella.

The books are excellent too.

It's best to watch or read these in order since Sebastian's tortured backstory is worth enjoying as it unfolds.",1447891200,6,1190,5.123711340206185
