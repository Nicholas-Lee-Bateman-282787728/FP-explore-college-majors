528187,4,6302986052,"The early 1970s ... awash with nostalgia for an idealized, innocent 1950s, in an effort to flee from the burned out remnants of a once vibrant counterculture that had sadly come to ashes. But this little film didn't settle for mere comfort bathed in a golden glow -- no, it presented all the difficulties & awkwardness of young people struggling to understand & explore their own emerging sexuality. It did so not merely in physical terms, but in emotional terms as well. And all of this in the overly protective, smothering sexual mores of that time, which often did more harm than good.

The story: two friends in a New England prep school experience love & sex for the first time. It ends well for one, but goes tragically wrong for the other. It's a story that was repeated in real life countless times, yet here it seems fresh & brand new, thanks to the fine script & equally fine acting.

I know that some viewers cringe a little at some of the dialogue, but to me it's honest & meant to be a little clumsy, a little embarrassed. After all, that's how the characters felt in their first attempts at love & genuine passion. There's a tenderness & vulnerability present that's considered passe today, and more's the pity. Pamela Sue Martin & Betsy Slade are excellent as the mismatched friends, and their performances are real & touchingly bittersweet.

It's not a major film by any means ... but in the end, it stays with you, melancholy & tinged with wistful tears of both fondness & regret. Recommended!",1336521600,5,1510,4.626865671641791
528188,3,6302986052,"I'm a little confused by some other reviews claiming this was originally a made-for-TV movie.  It was not.  My mother and I watched this on the big screen when it was originally released in 1974.  We both wept at the end, which we were not expecting.  We still enjoyed the movie, though.  I don't really remember a lot of foul language, either.",1321574400,7,344,4.483870967741935

528190,5,6302986052,"I saw this film long before I knew Pamela Sue Martin or Parker Stevenson.  Stationed in Germany at the time, I saw a lot of movies (for 50 cents), and this one showed up when weekday evening.  I had no idea what to expect, and had no expectations. Needless to say, for this airborne Ranger, the ending of the film left me quite emotionally compromised.  A great film (when I was 19).  I stumbled upon it in 1980 when it showed up on TV as ""Death of Her Innocence"" but this time I watched because it stared Pamela Sue Martin and Parker Stevenson - both popular because of Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys (and I'm sure why they released the film with a new name). I didn't recognize the film until Muffy's appearance - when a lot of emotion came roaring back.  I would say that's a mighty good lasting impression.  I'm looking forward to watching for a third time with my 19 and 21 year old daughters.",1301270400,7,897,4.27810650887574
528191,5,6302986052,"I first discovered this film when CBS aired it in 1980 as ""Death of Her Innocence"" in prime time.  I've always been a fan of Pamela Sue Martin, one of the most prettiest girls of the 1970s.  At the time I already owned a VCR and I recorded it.  I was awestruck by the cinematography and I loved the film score.  So much, in fact, that I called Warner Bros in Burbank and asked if there was a soundtrack available.  And so I watched the film repeatedly as a 19 year old that year.  I could never get enough of it.

Thirty years later it has finally made its debut on DVD and even though as a DVD-R from Warner Bros Archives, I am still very pleased with the transfer and very happy to own it.  The picture quality is superb.

This film hasn't gotten much airplay on television since 1980, not even presented on TCM.  But if you're familiar with the TV broadcast version, you'll no doubt be shocked at the language that was cut from the film.  I actually prefer the ""G-rated"" version but it's a likable story with great characters.

In watching the film after so many years I can't help but appreciate the late Debralee Scott's performance each and every time she has a moment on the screen.  Someone deserves special credit for adding her to the cast.

Nora Heflin, most famous for her role in ""Born Innocent"" is among the featured girl students at Pendleton.  Karen Balkin, from ""The Children's Hour"" is also one of the students featured.

The DVD is a bit pricey but you never know when it might go out of print and then you're hunting it down a few years later and paying triple for it.  I would definitely recommend getting it.",1282953600,6,1630,4.362126245847176

7833083,1,6302986052,"Pretty horrible and sappy! It was filmed in the town I grew up in. We were so embarrassed, when it came out, that most disavowed it. So badly received by critics, it went through 3 different working titles. Maybe the microphones in every scene and the whipped cream to cover the green leaves and grass, so as to pretend it was shot during the winter, did it. To be missed!",1525046400,,372,4.328571428571428
7833084,4,6302986052,"This film isn't going to win an Oscar.  However, I saw it one late night when I was in high school and it stayed with me.  In fact, the musical score was so haunting that for years, it would drift into my head every so often, even though I had only heard it one time.  I wish Michel Legrand would release it, as it is moving and emotional.  This is one of those movies that makes you think of people you've lost touch with, be it through time and circumstance or death.  Betsy Slade gives a very good performance as the girl who too many of us don't see, especially in today's superficial society.  This is a story of friendship.  How many people are really there for you when it counts?  Although the lush academic lawns existed only for a privileged few, the nostalgia of small towns without the blight of  graffiti or strip malls is comforting, as is a world where people actually connected in reality and not under the falsehood of social media.  It is beautifully filmed.  This is what the 1950's were like for women.  It isn't Happy Days and poodle skirts.  This movie beats  Lifetime movies that present a message, and its message, sadly, is still timely.",1491782400,2,1162,4.4454976303317535

7833092,3,6302986052,"The film, ""Our Time"" is a sweet and soulful look back at the challenges and consequences of coming of age love and sex. Though its an nostalgic period piece, the messages of love, expectations and woman's reproductive rights are timeless. CAUTION: it is a three tissue viewing!",1352505600,2,277,4.914893617021277
