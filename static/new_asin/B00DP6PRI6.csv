In many cases her videos are available for free on you tube for free,  so it is a little disappointing to buy and find at times they are the same ones.  But on the other hand her videos are well organized and enjoyable to watch.  Hopefully she will make more as I will purchase.",1416009600,2,313,4.254237288135593
8595757,5,B00DP6PRI6,"I am have recently joined the raw food team.  Although I am not likely to move to 100% raw, I am working toward a 70% diet. I prefer to eat two raw meals a day as this prevents the sluggish feeling I often get from too much processed food.  Traveling makes this a challenge until I came upon this great DVD.  It takes the guess work out of what to pack, what to buy at your destination and how to prep the meals.  It was great fun introducing the easy and wonderful sweet treats to non raw foodists.  I highly recommend you take Jennifer's advice on what to take with you.  I will make one recommendation when flying - pack the blades of your blender in your checked baggage.",1386028800,6,675,4.1937984496124034
