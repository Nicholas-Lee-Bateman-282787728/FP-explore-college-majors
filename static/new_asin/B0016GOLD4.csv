8262305,4,B0016GOLD4,Kareena Kapoor is a great and versatile actress and this is very different part than she normally plays. She is certainly an actress who is willing to stretch herself and in this movie she plays a prostitute who has a difficult life. The wealthy businessman Aman is plunged into a side of India that his class normally never sees including finding himself in a difficult and potentially dangerous situation in a police station. This is a very good movie and I will watch it again.,1354060800,,480,4.658823529411765
8262306,1,B0016GOLD4,"This is an excellent movie and shows a different side of Kareena Kapoor who usually plays a love struck bimbo.  It is worth watching as it shows everyone has a background and maybe we should't judge each other the way we do.
I was very excited to add this movie to my collection but, unfortunately the DVD arrived with the DVD lose, which I understand does occur with shipping.  When I opened it the DVD had what appeared to be remnants of adhesive.  I tried to clean, but it would not come off.  Hoping the DVD would play I tried it and it skipped.  Extremely disappointed.",1333843200,,574,4.377358490566038
8262307,4,B0016GOLD4,"Chameli was a very interesting story. I give it a 3.8 out of five stars, simply because the movie goes from conversations to chases through the streets and crime very quickly, giving it a disjointed feel. The title character is a prostitute who meets a wealthy businessman, Aman (the protagonist), one night when his car breaks down in the red light district. It is about their conversations, personal stories and problems, as well as living life despite the bad things that happen. Aman see's her gritty world, as well as the complicated and dangerous aspects of her life that are more of a grey area than a clear cut good or bad (especially the relationship she has with her pimp, and the life she lives as a prostitute.
Chameli tells Aman that ""there should at least be love,"" and this outlook plays into the movie quite a bit.

It is very different from most Hindi cinema, it only has three or four songs, and only one is a major performance. Its very serious and addresses both prostitution, the death of a loved one and what you do when life really does seem to be to painful to deal with. Aman becomes a changed man because of his experiences with Chameli and does start to love again, a point left open to the viewer at the end of the film. Definately worth the watch and the DVD has good quality sound and picture (as well as a song selection menu).",1306195200,,1358,4.453815261044177
