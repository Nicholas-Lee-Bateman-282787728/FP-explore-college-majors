3965606,5,B002PNW79C,"Rupert Isaacson is a masterful and poetic writer.  His style is lucid and self-examining as he documents this journey of healing for his autistic son, Rowan, to the outer steppes of Mongolia.  I felt like I was right there with him and his group, riding through the pristine and magnificent mountain steppes, on faith alone that the powerful reindeer shamans in the high mountains, accessible only by horse, would help his son.

Of course, Rowen, as well as Rupert and his wife must overcome doubt and fear every step of the way.  Anyone, who has cared for an autistic, as I have, can relate to the monumental difficulties of finding ways to help such a person overcome their mood swings and fears, even in a controlled environment, let alone taking such a risky journey.  Love, courage and beauty abound in this true story.

This is also a testimony to the powerful lessons our autistic folk have to teach us.",1277337600,,910,4.6918238993710695
3965607,5,B002PNW79C,"This is a remarkable story that deals with the mysteries of autism.  To find a way out of the HELL that the condition of autism created for this child and his parents, the parents open themselves up to a mystical tour into Mongolia, with no guarantees to find help for their family crisis.
  This documentary opens us all up to the possibilies outside of our own constricted realities to embrase, through the journey of this child and his courageously loving parents, the mysteries that lie on the frontiers of our comfort zones.
  Can you get the gist that I love this doc/movie?",1275091200,,580,4.647058823529412
3965608,3,B002PNW79C,"Any magazine, newspaper or film daring to explore autism is ripe to start crossfire conversations; this documentary is hardly different as it follows the efforts of journalist Rupert Issacson and his psychologist/professor wife, Kristin Neff, to reach  their 5-year-old autistic son, Rowan, via a horseback journey through Mongolia. Issacson, a ethnographer who embraces alternative, ritualistic healing methods, calls upon Mongolian shamans - some of whom shepherd reindeer by day -to ""cure"" their son of, if not autism, then his debilitating tantrums and self-imposed incontinence on the toilet.

Issacson secured a $1 million book deal to finance the film before even embarking on the trip, so the movie's uplifting end seems ordained - not the kind of ground a doc should hope to claim - although the journey through Mongolia, spare but beautiful, is captured eloquently through Scott's camera. The shamans, some of whom suggest otherworldly origins for Rowan's condition - Neff's poisoned womb, a manic-depressive grandmother holding on to the boy in her afterlife - mostly appear to be workmanlike and uninspired. Their methods - plying Rowan with fluids, lightly whipping the parents, asking Neff to wash herself while facing toward America - appear dubious, and the work of the main shaman is barely captured on camera inside a darkened tent. What he does, and how he does it, remains unclear. Then he lights a cigarette, and asks them to leave. Then he proclaims that, one day, Rowan will be a shaman.

So, yes, ""The Horse Boy"" is that kind of film, subjectively objective, occasionally drifting from credulity before being filed as another document detailing the mystery of autism. Rowan, whose natural affinity for animals makes him a good candidate for the trip, is fairly delightful, if unpredictable. Issacson, the father, seems more interested in the larger implications of the journey - he speaks of the trip in terms of success or failure in ways beyond his son's health - while Neff, his wife, emerges as game-for-adventure, dutiful and pragmatic. The better half, by some margin.",1272672000,24,2098,5.238095238095238
3965609,4,B002PNW79C,"While I was originally drawn to this movie because of the focus on an autistic boy (my son is one of the 1 in 91 who are on the autism spectrum, and males are 4 times more likely than girls to be diagnosed as such), as it turns out this movie is as much about autism as it is about culture, family, and spirituality. Rupert Isaacson, a writer and former horse trainer, and wife Kristin Neff, a psychology professor, are the parents of Rowan, whose lives took a drastic turn when after planning for a trip for ""Italy"", they ended up in ""Holland"" (see my review for ""Getting Your Kid on a Gluten-Free Casein-Free Diet"" by Susan Lord). In other words, they were thrown off balance because it is not only difficult to prepare for a child with autism, but the lack of readily available information via traditional sources such as physicians is scant to nonexistent, and when information is provided it takes time to sort through what is accurate and what is not, and what applies to one's child and what does not.

While this film does get into some of the background behind Rowan's diagnosis, and shows the frequent tantrums common to autistic children, it does not discuss in any great detail the traditional care they sought in the medical community nor the alternative biomedical therapies they may have explored which are increasingly prevalent in this space due to the ill-equipped health care system to handle autism, a neurological disorder. While this might disappoint some viewers, the strengths of this movie are that it shows the relationship between father and son, depicts a family which is unified, and follows a family through Mongolia, a country little known to the West.

Midway through the movie, in the midst of singing to his son, Rupert declares: ""Well, it's true - I'm a better father because of his autism. His autism forced me to listen to what interested him beyond all else and implemented because I had no choice. I'm glad now that I had no choice. It was tough at the time, but we're on to something good here"". He later comments that ""We would not be having this amazing, crazy, adventure across Mongolia if Rowan was not autistic. It seems like a curse in some ways, but in many ways it's a real blessing."" Despite some of the drawbacks of this documentary, and actions that Rupert and Kristin took with which one might disagree, it is difficult to fight such a positive attitude.

The aspect of this film which will probably shy away some potential viewers is Rupert's pursuit of Mongolian shamen. Because the health care he and his wife pursued resulted in little progress for Rowan, Rupert sought other remedies. After speech delays, Rowan had said his first words while riding bareback on a horse, and after seeing the connection Rowan seemed to have with animals in general (Dr. Temple Grandin provides comments in the film that this is typical for individuals with autism, including herself), Rupert discovered that the one culture which integrates horses and healing is Mongolia. Whatever his initial reluctance may have been to seek such an avenue, Rupert decides to visit multiple shamen throughout the country who he later believes cured Rowan from autistic symptoms such as tantrums (not autism itself).

Kristin, however, comments that ""To be honest, I don't really believe in spirits, you know, as actual entities - I think of them more as symbolic entities. My rational mind says, 'What does all this mean?'"" She later says ""I have no idea if any of it has an effect, or if it's just maybe calling up the focus and the intention for his healing which, in itself could be quite powerful. I don't know how useful it is to think of us as normal and totally healthy and Rowan as the ill one. I think it's way more complicated than that."" Along with Dr. Temple Grandin, several other experts weigh in during a 26-minute special features ""Additional Interviews with Autism Experts"" segment following the film, and one of these individuals would agree to some extent with this latter comment, commenting that most cultures around the world have traditionally found roles in society for those with autism, whereas Western culture has traditionally stigmatized those with autism. The great, hopeful development in recent years is that Western culture is now becoming more accepting of these individuals. Well recommended film.",1272326400,26,4357,4.844295302013423

Although the movie is filled with mysticism which is slowing beginning to be explained in traditional Western medicine, he is wise enough to include plenty of comments from recognized professionals with PhD's. Those of us who have been looking all over the world and doing the impossible  to help our children do not have to feel alone any longer. Thank you for daring, for sharing your inner turmoils, and for giving many desperate families the energy to go on.

3965612,5,B002PNW79C,"I saw a screening of ""Horse Boy"" in Memphis in November 09. I had read the book and loved it. The author, Rupert Isaacson had been flown in for this event to announce the founding of a non-profit to bring horses and special needs kids (some autistic) together. The film was made while Isaacson and his wife took their autistic 6-year old son to Mongolia for, hopefully, some kind of healing for the boy. During this audacious trip, their guide arranged for nine shamans to meet the family in the open. One by one, they assess the boy and his family and perform their brand of healing on them. Interestingly, they confer among themselves and decide that a mentally unbalanced departed relative on the mother's side was tugging at the boy. A ritual had to be performed to rid them of her spirit. Fascinating conclusion. Other rituals were performed on the parents as well as the boy, and sure enough, for the first time, the boy began to play with another lad near his age, a Mongolian boy. Consequently, this other child was invited to come along on the journey, as he was the son of their guide. They proceeded in a van, then on horseback to a higher elevation much farther north into reindeer country to meet a grand shaman they'd been told about. That part of the book AND the film is quite remarkable. The parents never knew if the boy would tolerate two days on horseback, as he was prone to several tantrums per day. I highly recommend this film (and the book) to readers who want to know how far loving parents will go to help their child. Also who like to learn how healing takes place in remote places where people live by understanding the human body and emotions better than we so-called civilized folks do.",1258502400,69,1717,4.52411575562701

3965619,5,B002PNW79C,"I identify with much of what the parents and their precious son went through in this incredible, moving film.  I cried through much of it.  We too fought for our daughter for decades.  This film brought back so many of the struggles we went through to find answers for our daughter with epilepsy and high functioning Ausperger's.  And trying to help her know and believe in herself while she grew up being shunned and ""different.""  I am so grateful we listened to the advice and multiple diagnoses of our many neurologists, psychiatrists, psychologists, endocrinologists, and social workers AND took what was helpful and left the rest behind. The specialists were unable to examine our daughter as a whole.  Nor with curiosity.  They each had their own myopic view of her, insulated in their limited fields of expertise.  It was like they were looking at the tail or ears or tusks or hide or belly of an elephant and not the entire animal.  The consensus was that, although they all said she was highly gifted in math and other areas, she should be institutionalized.  I am so grateful we followed our copious research and listened to our gut.  And I am humbled by our daughter's unique spirit and courage in the face of shunning, humiliation, and endless scrutiny, examinations, and hospitalizations.  She's not a survivor of all this, she is a thriver.  She lives an independent life with a loving man and possesses wisdom, humor, and compassion beyond comprehension.

That said  my one criticism is that The Horse Boy attempts to find that swelling, feel-good, happy ending. That seemed to miss what was so obvious about this journey and documentary otherwise.

And otherwise, it is a fair representation of parenting on the spectrum. There comes a time when parents are at a critical point and they simply make a commitment to do anything for the child they love. The Isaacson's head to outer Mongolia, to seek shaman and in search for happier times. Not only do we hear the shaman diagnosis, but also half a dozen Western experts  all appropriately echoing along the journey as they seek someone, anyone, who can help them help them help their son. Inevitably, nothing goes as predicted. No one expert's opinion seems right or wrong. There is no ""cure."" And Horse Boy is not bonding with the horses. But he does bond in a way that is transformative.

The one accepting child, the new friendship, the one thing that obviously made a world of difference was the hero moment that seemed worthy of swelling music. Everything else, was appropriately sparce, plain, lacking horse-sense and just a bit wacky. But I liked it.

One day by chance they notice that their neighbor's horses has a calming effect on their young son. Rupert then searches for a place where there are horses and shamans and he comes up with the country of Mongolia. They leave their home in Texas and fly to Mongolia in search of shamanistic healing. One of the most interesting scenes in the movie is when the shamans do their healing on Rowan. They drive out the negative spirits in the boy. Rowan seems calmer and more present after the healing. The people in Mongolia are real and kind. The horses and the cinematography are stunning.  It's a beautiful heart warming movie that gives a person hope.

This isn't  extraordinary means to help their child, rather it comes across as people who have a knee jerk reaction and rather than address the problem in the readily available (and working) way by providing horse therapy; they put their unfortunate child through a terrible ordeal to gratify their need for adventure - and they document it.

It looks like child abuse to me. Way too many scenes of a distressed child. I'm always amazed at people who throw out modernity at the first sign of a crisis and head out to visit the witch doctor.  Sometimes you can have a mind so open that your brains fall out.",1427414400,4,906,4.580246913580247

Do you remember Warrendale? Shamanic Rituals do not translate well to film.

Did they trim this documentary film for the USA because it might be too controversial? Would the long version hurt some religious people's feelings?

3965706,4,B002PNW79C,"As an educator, I am always looking for materials to share with my staff to increase their knowledge and understanding of the different disabilities of the children we provide programming for.  The Horse Boy was a wonderful portrait that showed exactly how far parents will go to try to help their child with a disability--in this case, autism.

Prior to starting a family, Rupert Isaacson and his wife Kristin Neff had traveled extensively.  They were delighted to settle down and welcomed Rowan into the world.  Isaacson was a former horse trainer and Kristin was a Psychology Professor.  At age two, Rowan is diagnosed with autism.  Rupert and Kristin sought out every avenue they could to try to help Rowan.  He demonstrated rages that could last for hours, slept very little and did not respond to any of the therapies they could find.  Rupert's experinces prior to Rowan's birth had given him a broad wealth of knowledge.  He knew that animals could be comforting to children with disabilities and got Rowan on a horse.  At first it was difficult but eventually Rowan was calmed by riding.  Riding became one of the only times Rowan seemed truly calm and at ease within himself.

Rupert was desperate to help his son and brought up the idea to Kristin of taking Rowan to the shamans in Mongolia.  He believed that the shamans held healing powers that could help his son and his autism.  So, as a family, they set out to ride horses through Mongolia to visit various shamans in seach of a cure for Rowan.

The trip proves to be very difficult for Rowan who likes his stability and predictable life.  The van that they use for part of the travel becomes Rowan's ""home away from home"" and he refuses to ride the horses.  It is only when they are to go to the last shaman that they must ride the horse and Rupert works with Rowan until they can ride.  The ultimate outcome of the trip is not what the parents were hoping for although there were some positive changes in Rowan.  During the trip he is toilet trained, gains more language and becomes more social with other children.

I think the film has several aspects that are important to take into consideration:
1. Parents want to help their child with autism and may often ""try"" things that most other people consider outrageous or ineffective.  If you are not in the position of a parent with an autistic child, it is difficult to say what you would do.  Many of the therapies that are considered as alternative or not backed by medical professionals may be considered as ""out there  or just plain crazy.""  However, the parent of a child with autism knows there is no magic pill or therapy that will cure their child so they try whatever is at their disposal to try to help their child.
2. Since this is a documentary, the footage of Rowan and his tantrums is real.  For many of the staff that I had view the video, it was the first time they saw a child at home and realized that the tantrums we see at school are the same at home.  For others, it was the first time they saw a full blown tantrum and were stunned at what the parents had to do to keep Rowan safe while he tantrumed.
3. The use of animals, especially horses, has been a long time therapy for people with disabilities.  Seeing Rowan happy, smiling and calm riding the horse was very heart warming.

I think the video was well done and very informative to anyone watching.  The parents were honest in their portrayal of their son and the trials and tribulations they went through on a daily basis with him.  The choice to go to the shamans is one that I had never heard before but with a very strong spiritual belief, I think it was something they believed in and thought it was worth a try.  I did feel it was a very big trip to take with a child who demonstrated such behavioral issues and that these parents were very brave.  At times my heart went out to them and I expected them to just turn back and go home.  Rupert and Kristin showed  unbelievable strength, dedication and caring for a little boy who just could not understand or interact with the world around him.

I would recommend this video to anyone interested in children with autism!!

I watched this documentary since it had a high rating and produced for PBS. It was very difficult for me not to walk away from this documentary at first few minutes. Very disturbing to watch a child scream and cry continuously while meantime two adults trying to talk, communicate and somehow reason with that child unsuccessfully. I enjoy every single moment of my life by insuring that I feed my body the best diet and spirits so I will be able to conquer my next mountain biking trail, or hiking trail, or pumping iron, or the next big wave in the ocean... I do not worry about health since I have health, worship my health, thankful for my health and enjoy my health. Being an avid documentary junkie, I always watch health related documentaries so I can get the best knowledge that I can for my body and mind. It is not like I have not watched any documentary about individuals that suffer from some kind of mental or physical disability or discomfort, it is that I had never watched a child who suffers from something unknown which society has chosen to call it Autism while two other individuals who are his parents have to be there every moment of their lives right next to that child.

What they did, where they went, what they achieved are all in the documentary and everyone can walk away with their own take. As parents they deserve a Noble Peace Prize.

One day, as Rupert and his wife began to run out of ideas to help their son, Rupert decided to take Rowan on a horse, and Rowan opened up, calmed down and began to speak. Rowan's parents realized that Rowan had a close connection with animals and seemed to reach a sense of calm once he was around them. Rupert Issacson, the father or Rowan had been an advocate for years for indigenous people in third world countries.

They see positive result at the end of their 'journey' but honestly I don't approve it. It is based solely on superstition and I refuse to buy superstition which I equate to snake oil. Even if shamans were living next door to me, I would not do that. There is a lot of ethos in this video but nothing that really adds up to your knowledge. On the other hand, I would comment as, this is one of the examples where parents instead of using science to address the issue, use all kind of wacky methods.

It seems to me that these New Agey people would have tried things like chelation, diet changes, supplements and social butterflies before choosing medications, but if they did, they didn't show that. (I think that's an important omission). Anyway, so they decide to trek to Mongolia to engage in shamanic ritual to help their son. It seems really honest and heart felt.
