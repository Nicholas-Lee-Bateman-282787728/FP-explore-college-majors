8115271,5,B000EX4JAA,"Of all the films of Jacques Tourneur, directed after the war, this film is one of my most misunderstood. Set in the world of American footbal, the film engages in a reflection on the sport and the notion of stardom. Through the course of a champion,(superb Victor Mature), Tourneur engages in critical reflection on the American way of life, the concept of social success. A must see.",1357344000,6,384,4.746268656716418
8115272,1,B000EX4JAA,"Victor Mature once quipped, ""I'm not an actor--and I've got the movies to prove it."" This is a poor soap opera disguised as a sports picture. From its oh-so-ironic title to the wooden performances of most everyone involved, this is a dud, about a self-loathing, each-other-loathing couple who can't cope with the loss of their careers. It stops being a dud at the end, when Vic's character gives up hitting opponents on the field and starts hitting his wife to compensate--then it goes from dud to disgusting. A waste of film, and also of Lucille Ball, who has a thankless role as the team's secretary and implied slut. This is the worst type of misogyny, as the guys are degraded too.",1352851200,2,685,4.669421487603306
8115273,5,B000EX4JAA,I bought this video solely for the apperance of LIZABETH SCOTT! She is one of my favorite film noir stars of the 1940's. She does a great acting job as the pushy wife who wants it all!,1261699200,5,184,4.0
