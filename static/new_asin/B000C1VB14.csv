8173551,4,B000C1VB14,A VERY REAL AND GRITTY FILM STRAIGHT UP GANGSTA STUFF NICE BOXING AND GOOD STORY BUT THE VOLUME ON THE DVD IS HORRIBLE AND THERE ARE NO SPECIAL FEATURES,1325548800,,152,4.275862068965517
8173552,5,B000C1VB14,"This is a wonderful movie. it is so true. it shows how if you get caught up in things like this, bad stuff happens. it also says that not all people in 'the hood' are bad. the guy that owns the gym won't let them in if they involved in gangs, guns or drugs.

dont watch this if blood and gore bothers you cause there is alot of blood violence and guns in this. it also has quite a bit of cussing.

this movie definitely does not receive the credit it should. it is a wonderful movie. it shows it how stuff really is, and it might even make you think.",1148774400,,550,3.945945945945946
