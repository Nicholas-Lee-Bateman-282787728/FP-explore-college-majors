2468562,5,B000CPHA7Y,I saw this movie a long time ago in theaters. It was really really good and I'm a kid but I still thought it was great!,1178668800,3,119,3.6153846153846154
2468563,5,B000CPHA7Y,"I try to include as many spiritual movies in my reviews that I can, as long as they are consistent with traditional Christian values.  This movie goes right to the top of the list of Spiritual movies; it is how I think a Christian movie should be made.  First, it is an exciting and fascinating story in itself; a 12-year-old boy and girl pledge their love for each other, but are separated.  Will they forget their promises to each other, like most kids, or somehow find their way back to each other.

In this movie, we have an unchurched girl, Sarah, who somehow senses the Presence of God in her life.  She, like her hero Joan of Arc, clearly wants to live only in ways that are pleasing to God.  When she feels she has sinned, knowing of Confession in the Catholic Church, she turns to the local priest.  I should interject here that this priest is how a priest should be, and, indeed, he is like most all the priests I've met.  (Unlike so much media negative image of Catholic priests.)  The way he handles Sarah serves to strengthen her faith.  But, all this spiritual element is done so subtly, so naturally and without a hint of preaching, that it really is Christianity by example.  I should add that Sarah is not a confirmed Catholic, so Protestants can appreciate the story as much as anyone would.

I don't dare say anything more lest I give away the story, which is a powerful story of simple faith and trust in God.  All I have to say is that I have watched thousands of movies, many with spiritual elements, and this is by far the top in general production quality, caliber of acting, and in its story.  I have to thank Mel Gibson for showing that there is a real thirst for top-quality Christian movies.  If you watch only one spiritual movie this year, make it this one.",1172361600,31,1787,4.422018348623853
2468564,4,B000CPHA7Y,"This is a hypnotic, mesmerizing, beautifully constructed film starring Sara Simmonds. Every young person should see this movie. The story grabs your attention fom the beginning and takes you on a sweet ride. In a world of drunken and foul mouthed teens in other filmfare it is a relief to see a movie and story that unfolds with such grace and inner beauty. As a filmmaker myself I was taken by Sara's beauty since she reminds me of an actress that starred in one of my own films. Congratulations to the director and cast of this wonderful film. Cheers!",1167696000,,553,4.595959595959596
2468565,5,B000CPHA7Y,"I saw this film on the big screen and couldn't get it out of my mind for quite a while afterwards.  I bought it recently and have enjoyed viewing it again.  It offers an intriguing story of a ""good girl"" with an almost mystic inner conflict and a ""bad guy"" who is hauntingly evil.  It is one of those films that has more to reveal upon a second viewing.  I highly recommend it.",1152576000,5,377,4.123287671232877

2468569,3,B000CPHA7Y,"First of all, a movie is not a Christian movie just because they say God and quote a few scriptures.

This was more to the tune of a slow non-realistic romantic film.  I kept watching it to see when it will get good but it did hold my attention.  Didn't understand Alec's character at all.  I know he was supposed to be the evil character but he had no basis.

Predictable (unrevealed spoiler - when you watch it you'll know what I mean).",1409184000,,438,4.228915662650603

2468571,5,B000CPHA7Y,"This was not like your typical soft, gentle Christian movie.  All of those are good, but we need more like this.  When a movie is this intense and interesting, it will attract larger audiences and give better visibility to how someone can seek a sincere relationship with God in real world settings.

Developing a relationship with God is unique for everyone because everyone is unique.  This movie portrayed a great example of one girl's unique journey developing her relationship with God.",1402790400,4,491,5.0246913580246915

2468575,2,B000CPHA7Y,"I normally won't give a review or make a assessment of A Movie,feeling Everyone has Different Taste in what They Like! However,Because  I STRONGLY Disagree that this is a ""Family Film"" Let alone "" A Christian Film""  I must WARN VIEWERS! There are so Many Scenes shot in the ""Dark"" Makes it much More of a Horror Type Movie ! Plus Most of the Movies I have seen that show everything at Night do so Because They have ""poor Writing & Poor Acting!"" A Faith Based Movie with a Bomb SET to kill how many People? PLEASE PEOPLE It is Just as Bad as the first 5 Minutes! Just Because It has one Bible Verse in It ,Remember the Devil knows The ""VERSES"" In the BIBLE as well!",1377734400,2,664,4.1796875
2468576,2,B000CPHA7Y,"I really wanted to like this movie -- it sounded like an interesting premise, and previous reviews suggested that the overall message was a good one.

This movie, however, seems to be pretty hard to like.

First, the script is frankly abysmal (though it offers a few good moments).

Alec's characterization appears to essentially be an amplified cliche.  Same goes for Sarah's Mom -- in her case, I suspect that the writer/director was aiming for ""tortured soul,"" but instead he gives us ""grating loon.""  To her credit, the actress playing her seems to be doing her best with what she's got.  Sarah, too, seem like an amplified cliche.  In fact, as far as I made it, you could pretty much say that for the whole dramatis personae.

That's too bad, because these characters, in the hands of the right writer and director, could have been pretty interesting, the conflict between Sarah and Alec could have been engaging, and Sarah's stand for her convictions could have been inspiring.

The acting, too, is inconsistent.  Specifically, the guy who plays Alec is wildly unconvincing -- look up ""overacting"" in the dictionary, and you might even find his picture there.  I'm not sure that's his fault, though -- it's entirely possible he's just playing the character as directed and could perform better under a more skillful director.  However, I suspect that the blame, in this case, lies with both bad acting and bad direction.

Much of the rest of the cast (at least as far as I got), meanwhile, ranges from passable to pretty good.  The minor characters seem spotty -- some stiff and self-conscious (imagine your average high school production and you'll have it), some pretty solidly in-character and working to make the best of things.  Meanwhile, the actors playing main character Sarah, her friend (whose name I didn't catch), and major character Dave seem to be doing pretty well, given the material at hand.  Unfortunately, even they together can't make this dodo fly.

The disjointed plot doesn't help.  I realize the writer/director probably chose a not-entirely-linear timeline for effect.  I'm assuming the flashback sequences are supposed to lead us further into the story (instead of merely filling in the backstory, which could be accomplished by other means) -- and the ""vision"" scenes are obviously supposed to be important.  However, our auteur hasn't executed his timeline well enough for it to be anything but a distraction.

Generally speaking, where movies are concerned, I'm not that picky a critic.  I've seen a number of small-budget films, both religious and secular, with largely-amateur casts, that I've really enjoyed.  It doesn't take a flawless performance to impress me.  If a film mostly has its ducks in a row and tells its story effectively, I'm happy.

I rarely encounter a movie I can't at least sit through.  Unfortunately, ""Echoes of Innocence"" has proven to be one of those few.  I think I made it about 45 minutes into the picture before I just plain gave up.

Maybe it would've redeemed itself if I could've stuck it out longer -- and maybe I'll try watching it again later with a friend so we can laugh our way through the bad parts and enjoy the good parts.

Until then, though, I'm just going to have to give it a miss.

It's possible that the writer/director's heart is in the right place.  I suspect he had good intentions.  However, I suspect that, like many auteurs, he's blind to his own weaknesses.  In short, this script could benefit from the services of a merciless editor and the input of some experienced screenwriters.  As for the direction -- I'm hoping this is an early effort, and that the director will either improve with guidance or find another medium of expression.",1377648000,2,3729,4.885350318471337
2468577,1,B000CPHA7Y,"This movie was a waste of time and felt evil. I'd recommend: COURAGEOUS, FIREPROOF, WITHOUT A FATHER, OVERCOME, GRACE CARD, THE ENCOUNTER....just not this one.",1367193600,2,159,5.4
2468578,2,B000CPHA7Y,I perhaps would have liked this movie if I could have seen the entire film.  I tried to watch it three times and it stopped and would not reload each time.  Has anyone else had this problem?  It is very frustrating that most of the Prime movies either will not load or they stop and keep reloading or stop and will not reload.,1365033600,,326,4.142857142857143

2468580,2,B000CPHA7Y,I only got into a little over 15 mins of this movie and had to quit watching it. I have always trusted dove approved movies as family friendly. This movie is called faith based yet the background music and language was anything but. I just couldn't get passed it and it felt a little creepy to me. Not like any faith based movie I have ever seen. It could have got better but then it could have got worse. Disappointed in Dove....,1363564800,3,430,4.2560975609756095
2468581,5,B000CPHA7Y,I loved it PURE and SIMPLE. I was concerned that the quality might be poor but it was not. I enjoyed the purity of it.,1362700800,4,118,3.76
2468582,5,B000CPHA7Y,Echoes of Innocence is a film about a young women who admires St. Joan of Arc and who is very devout and has made a commitment to remain a virgin until she marries her true love. This is a surprisingly good film that intertwines some of the major themes of St. Joan of Arc's life into the main characters life and is sure to entertain and inspire anyone with a passion for Joan of Arc.,1361836800,2,385,4.1466666666666665
2468583,5,B000CPHA7Y,It is a good movie. Not for kids to watch but great for teens and older. It is a great movie about purity.,1359331200,4,106,3.652173913043478

This movie is one that will require you to know who Joan of Arc is, so I did have to provide background info to my teenaged grandchildren who watched this with me, but they found the storyline and action every bit as intriguing as I did.
On one hand I did have to explain some of the symbolism to them, but I do believe they would have enjoyed it just as much without my need to turn movies into teachable moments. I thought the acting was very good and the story was one that unfolded at a nice pace. I found it to be one that not only spoke to a relevant issue for today's teens, but also presented a beautiful allegory to those of us who are Christians. Frankly, I have watched it several times, and I enjoy it more with each viewing. It certainly is a very thought-provoking film and one that I would recommend to others.",1289692800,4,981,4.945454545454545
2468585,5,B000CPHA7Y,I love this movie. I was expecting it to be poor quality and not very good but I took a chance and I am glad I did. This movie was about a young girl who saved herself for this one guy for over five years and was given visions from God. I love this movie. Five stars!!!!!!!!!!!!,1265414400,5,278,3.8947368421052633
2468586,4,B000CPHA7Y,"This film has a very intense, mysterious plot with a lot of suspense. I liked it, but I'm not sure how to describe it. Sarah and Christopher pledge their love to each other as young teenagers, then Christopher is gone. Sarah, whose hero is Joan of Arc and has visions, wants to remain true to the promise she and Christopher made to one another.  Sarah has a very disturbed mother and she tries hard not to be like her in any way, and seeks spiritual guidance from a priest even though she is not Catholic. There are evil influences and distractions and temptations along the way. This film almost seemed allegorical with Sarah as the Church and Christopher as the Christ in how she attempts to stay faithful even when she has no sign Christopher will ever return. The ending is a surprise with scenes that can easily be interpreted with double meanings. On the negative side, some scenes don't flow well, such as the group of teenagers talking about taking a purity pledge and then Sarah and another girl sitting in a hall--it seems something is missing in between. And there is a very violent series of events at night, but it's so dark in the scenes it's difficult to tell what is happening. It's also never quite clear why the grandmother sits and stares and has no reactions to Sarah talking to her. Other than those minor flaws, it is a good movie and the acting is very well done. I especially liked the acting of Sarah in the school play. All in all, I would recommend this film to anyone who would like to see an unusual film with strong Christian messages.",1246406400,7,1566,4.494736842105263
2468587,2,B000CPHA7Y,"Very strange movie -- certainly not what I had expected. Was going to share with a group of ladies -- not appropriate for that. Lots of sexual overtones, not indicated on description.",1245628800,,183,4.75

8100049,1,B000CPHA7Y,It did not interest us enough to keep watching.  The quality of the picture was not good and very unfocused.  Decided to shut it off and watch something else.  It was put together like a B- rated movie at best.,1449100800,,210,4.2
8100050,4,B000CPHA7Y,"This is a tale of two young people coming of age, one of who is growing up surrounded by spiritual experiences neither understood or requested, and another who is intrigued by this first person.  They meet and form a young love for each other.  They come to realize that their affection for each other cannot be complete at this time in their lives, so they pledge to remain pure and committed to each other until the reach an age at which they can fulfill their commitment.  Shortly thereafter, circumstances separate them, and their best efforts to stay in touch eventually fail.

This innocent commitment is set in contrast to a culture that not only does not support this value, but provides redicule and isolation, and even physical abuse for those who have chosen to stand apart.  The movie present a picture where those who would be the one's defending their children's virtue compromising by saying it's okay to be part of the culture, as long as you stay ""safe,"" and the effects of such disengagement.  You see comparisons between this relationship with a few others who have tried to support each other in swimming against the social tide, but you see an example that suggests that they, too, fall in this culture.  A constant underlying theme is a portrayal of underlying spiritual battles taking place, incompletely understood by the participants and revealed through visions, Biblical passages, religious events and ceremonies, both good and evil.

A caution to some viewers would be about some of the themes in the movie:  abuse and manipulation, drug and alcohol use and physical violence (including firearms and explosives) are depicted in the tale, and some ""street language"" is included, which may place a lower limit on age appropriateness.  I would recommend a preview to see if you consider it appropriate for your younger teens.  From the Christian perspective, positive uses of the Word of God and helpful spiritual advisors are set against some of the more divisive issues may be the depictions of mysticism and spirituality.  This issue should be approached with care as the differences in belief in this area can be substantial, and have in fact caused fellowships to separate on it.  If you are not comfortable with the question of whether Christians should have intuitive insights, be drawn into trances, or actively pursue spiritual guidance, then this movie will likely trouble you.  It also includes some mystical elements and ceremonies that are peculiar to Catholic beliefs, which may challenge some as well.  Another point of concern might be around how the young couple expresses their affections toward each other, which some raise questions in some younger viewers.

Overall, the movie asks and attempts to answer a few important questions faced by our young people today:  Is it possible to truly remain pure in todays world?  Are virtues really worth the bother?  Why shouldn't you do what everyone else seems to be encouraging you to do, contrary to your beliefs?  Is spirituality and religion still as relevant today as it was in ages long ago?  Is it possible to keep a promise on based on faith despite an uncertain future?  It is also a love story cast in the way of many fairy tales, with the protagonists believing and pursuing ""happily every after"" and aided by supernatural forces, despite great odds and adversity.
